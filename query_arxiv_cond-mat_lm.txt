Title: Topolectrical circuits $-$ recent experimental advances and developments
Authors: Haydar Sahin, Mansoor B. A. Jalil, Ching Hua Lee
Abstract: Metamaterials serve as versatile platforms for demonstrating condensed matter physics and non-equilibrium phenomena, with electrical circuits emerging as a particularly compelling medium. This review highlights recent advances in the experimental circuit realizations of topological, non-Hermitian, non-linear, Floquet and other notable phenomena. Initially performed mostly with passive electrical components, topolectrical circuits have evolved to incorporate active elements such as operational amplifiers and analog multipliers that combine to form negative impedance converters, complex phase elements, high-frequency temporal modulators and self-feedback mechanisms. This review provides a summary of these contemporary studies and discusses the broader potential of electrical circuits in physics.

Title: Strong Coupling of Nanomechanical Vibrations to Individual Two-Level Systems
Authors: M. Yuksel, M. P. Maksymowych, O. A. Hitchcock, F. M. Mayor, N. R. Lee, M. I. Dykman, A. H. Safavi-Naeini, M. L. Roukes
Abstract: Atomic-scale defects behaving as two-level systems (TLSs) are crucial to the physics of modern quantum devices. Here, we study interactions between individual TLS defects and the mechanical vibrations of a nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) resonator. By applying a mechanical strain, we tune individual TLS onto resonance with the NEMS and observe strong coupling. By adjusting phonon number, we reveal the nonlinear energy levels of the hybridized system and confirm single-phonon nonlinearity. We also observe fluctuations between hybridized and bare resonance states as the TLS fluctuates between on- and off-resonance. These quintessential quantum effects emerge directly from intrinsic material properties, without requiring external electromagnetic systems or complex quantum circuits. Our work establishes a platform for exploring and manipulating TLS-phonon interactions in the single-phonon regime.

Title: Altermagnetic nanotextures revealed in bulk MnTe
Authors: Rikako Yamamoto, Luke Alexander Turnbull, Marcus Schmidt, José Claudio Corsaletti Filho, Hayden Jeffrey Binger, Marisel Di Pietro Martínez, Markus Weigand, Simone Finizio, Yurii Prots, George Matthew Ferguson, Uri Vool, Sebastian Wintz, Claire Donnelly
Abstract: With many candidate altermagnetic materials, MnTe has emerged as one of the most promising systems, with growing experimental evidence for altermagnetic phenomena. So far, the majority of measurements have been performed on thin-films, or have involved surface measurements. However, the question of altermagnetic order in the bulk system - in the absence of substrate or surface effects - remains. Here we show evidence for bulk altermagnetism in single crystal MnTe, through spectroscopic X-ray microscopy. By performing nanoscale X-ray magnetic circular dichroic (XMCD) imaging in transmission on a 200 nm thick lamella, we observe domains and magnetic textures with a spectroscopic signature characteristic of altermagnetic order, thereby confirming the intrinsic nature of altermagnetism in MnTe. Quantitative analysis of the XMCD signal reveals an excellent agreement with predicted signals, establishing that the altermagnetic order exists throughout the thickness of the lamella and confirming the intrinsic, bulk nature of the state. With these results, we demonstrate that transmission XMCD spectroscopic imaging is a robust, quantitative technique to probe altermagnetic order, providing a means to probe individual altermagnetic domains within complex configurations. This ability to investigate, and characterise altermagnetic order in bulk crystals represents an important tool for the exploration of altermagnetism across a wide range of candidate materials, of key importance for the development of future technologies.

Authors: Grace Guinan, Addison Salvador, Michelle A. Smeaton, Andrew Glaws, Hilary Egan, Brian C. Wyatt, Babak Anasori, Kevin R. Fiedler, Matthew J. Olszta, Steven R. Spurgeon
Abstract: What does materials science look like in the "Age of Artificial Intelligence?" Each materials domain-synthesis, characterization, and modeling-has a different answer to this question, motivated by unique challenges and constraints. This work focuses on the tremendous potential of autonomous characterization within electron microscopy. We present our recent advancements in developing domain-aware, multimodal models for microscopy analysis capable of describing complex atomic systems. We then address the critical gap between the theoretical promise of autonomous microscopy and its current practical limitations, showcasing recent successes while highlighting the necessary developments to achieve robust, real-world autonomy.

Title: Formation of Complex Discrete Time Crystals with Ultracold Atoms
Authors: Weronika Golletz, Krzysztof Sacha
Abstract: We study discrete time crystal formation in a system driven periodically by an oscillating atomic mirror, consisting of two distinct ultracold atomic clouds in the presence of a gravitational field. The intra-species interactions are weak and attractive, while the inter-species interactions are infinitely strong and repulsive. The clouds are arranged in a one-dimensional stack, where the bottom cloud bounces on an oscillating atomic mirror, which effectively acts as a driving force for the upper cloud due to the infinite inter-species repulsion. Using a Jastrow-like variational ansatz for the many-body wavefunction, we show that sufficiently strong attractive intra-species interactions drive each subsystem to spontaneously break discrete time translation symmetry, resulting in the formation of a complex discrete time crystal evolving with a period different than the driving period. Since the bottom cloud serves as the effective periodic driving for the upper cloud, this leads to a cascade of spontaneous symmetry breaking. With increasing intra-species interactions, we first observe a pronounced effect of spontaneous time translation symmetry breaking in the upper cloud, followed by a similar effect in the lower atomic cloud.

Title: Meta-GGA dielectric-dependent and range-separated screened hybrid functional for reliable prediction of material properties
Authors: Subrata Jana, Abhishek Bhattacharjee, Suman Mahakal, Szymon Smiga, Prasanjit Samal
Abstract: We propose a range-separated hybrid exchange-correlation functional to calculate solid-state material properties. The functional mixes Hartree-Fock exchange with the semilocal exchange of the meta-generalized gradient approximation (meta-GGA) and the fraction of Hartree-Fock exchange is determined from the dielectric function. First-principles calculations and comparison with other meta-GGA approximations show that the functional leads to reasonably good performance for the band gap and optical properties. We also show that the present functional also successfully resolves the well-known ``band gap problem'' of narrow gap Cu-based semiconductors, such as Cu3SbSe4 and Cu3AsSe4, where, in general, a considerably large band inversion energy leads to a ``false'' negative or metallic band gap for all other methods. Furthermore, reasonable accuracy for the occupied d-bands and transition energies is also obtained for bulk solids. Thus, overall, our results demonstrate the predictive power of range-separated meta-GGA hybrid functionals for quantum materials simulations.

Title: Metal-organic chemical vapor deposition of MgGeN2 films on GaN and sapphire
Authors: Chenxi Hu, Vijay Gopal Thirupakuzi Vangipuram, Christopher Chae, Ilteris K. Turan, Nichole Hoven, Walter R.L. Lambrecht, Jinwoo Hwang, Yumi Ijiri, Hongping Zhao, Kathleen Kash
Abstract: MgGeN2 films were synthesized using metal-organic chemical vapor deposition on GaN/c-sapphire templates and c-plane sapphire substrates. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy was used to estimate the cation composition ratios. To mitigate magnesium evaporation, the films were grown at pyrometer temperature 745 °C with a wafer rotation speed of 1000 rpm. Growth rates were determined by fitting energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy spectra to film thicknesses using NIST DTSA-II software. The thickness estimates determined by this method were consistent with scanning transmission electron microscopy measurements done for selected samples. Scanning electron microscopy images revealed faceted surfaces indicative of a tendency toward three-dimensional growth. X-ray diffraction spectra confirmed that the films were highly crystalline and exhibited preferential orientation in alignment with the substrate. Atomic force microscopy measurements show that film thicknesses are consistent across samples grown on both GaN templates and sapphire substrates, with typical roughnesses around 10 nm. Transmittance spectra of films grown on double-side-polished sapphire substrates yielded band gaps of 4.28 +- 0.06 eV for samples exhibiting close-to-ideal stoichiometry. Comparison of the measured spectra with ab initio calculations are in good agreement both near the band gap and at higher energies where excitation is into higher-lying bands. These findings provide insight into the growth and characterization of MgGeN2, contributing to the development of this material for potential applications in optoelectronics and power electronics.

Title: Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless Renormalization Group Flow at a Quantum Phase Transition
Authors: Matthias Thamm, Harini Radhakrishnan, Hatem Barghathi, C. M. Herdman, Arpan Biswas, Bernd Rosenow, Adrian Del Maestro
Abstract: We present a controlled numerical study of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition in the one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model at unit filling, providing evidence of the characteristic logarithmic finite-size scaling of the BKT transition. Employing density matrix renormalization group and quantum Monte Carlo simulations under periodic boundary conditions, together with a systematic finite-size scaling analysis of bipartite particle number fluctuations, we resolve boundary-induced complications that previously obscured critical scaling. We demonstrate that a suitably chosen central region under open boundaries reproduces universal RG signatures, reconciling earlier discrepancies. Finally, leveraging a non-parametric Bayesian analysis, we determine the critical interaction strength with high precision, establishing a benchmark for BKT physics in one-dimensional quantum models.

Title: Theory of interaction-induced charge order in CrSBr
Authors: Zhi-Hao Cui, Andrew J. Millis, David R. Reichman
Abstract: CrSBr is a layered van der Waals insulator with a quasi one-dimensional electronic structure and in-plane ferromagnetic order. Recent experimental work on Li-doped CrSBr reveals quasi-1D charge modulated states. In this study, we develop ab initio effective models for CrSBr to investigate these states and solve them using mean-field theory and density matrix embedding theory. The models are parametrized using density functional theory, the constrained random phase approximation, and the Rytova-Keldysh form of the long-range Coulomb interaction. Our simulations indicate the emergence of a charge density wave state characterized by cosine-like intra-chain density modulations and inter-chain phase shifts that minimize the Coulomb repulsion. Notably, at a doping level corresponding to $1/n$ electron per CrSBr unit, the most stable pattern exhibits a periodicity of $n$ cells, in agreement with experimental observations and Peierls' instability arguments. Moreover, we demonstrate that the inter-chain order is sensitive to the range of Coulomb interactions. If the interaction is hard-truncated to a short-ranged form, some localized stripe-like states are computationally favored. This work provides an ab initio framework for understanding the interplay of competing electronic and magnetic phases in CrSBr and related materials.

Title: Nonlinear contractile response of actomyosin active gels to control signals
Authors: James Clarke (1), Francis Cavanna (1), Aniket Marne (1), Anthony Davolio (1), José Alvardo (1) ((1) Center for Nonlinear Dynamics, Department of Physics, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA)
Abstract: Biological systems tightly regulate their physiological state using control signals. This includes the actomyosin cytoskeleton, a contractile active gel that consumes chemical free energy to drive many examples of cellular mechanical behavior. Upstream regulatory pathways activate or inhibit actomyosin activity. However, the contractile response of the actomyosin cytoskeleton to control signals remains poorly characterized. Here we employ reconstituted actomyosin active gels and subject them to step and pulsatile activation inputs. We find evidence for a nonlinear impulse response, which we quantify via a transfer function $\delta \varepsilon / \delta g$ that relates input free-energy pulses $\delta g$ to output strain pulses $\delta \varepsilon$. We find a scaling relation $\delta \varepsilon / \delta g \sim g^{-0.3}$. The negative sign of the exponent represents a decreased effectiveness of a contracting gel in converting energy to strain. We ascribe nonlinearity in our system to a density-dependent mechanism, which contrasts strain-stiffening nonlinear responses to external stresses. Contractile response to control signals is an essential step toward understanding how information from mechanical signaling processes flow through actomyosin networks in living, and likely also synthetic, cells.

Title: Generalized diffusion process with nonlocal interactions: Continuous time random walk model and stochastic resetting
Authors: Pece Trajanovski, Irina Petreska, Katarzyna Gorska, Ljupco Kocarev, Trifce Sandev
Abstract: A space fractional diffusion-like equation is introduced, which embodies the nonlocality in time, represented by the memory kernel and the non-locality in space. A specific example of the nonlocal term is considered in combination with three different forms of the memory kernel. To analyse the probability density function, we utilize the subordination approach. Subsequently, the corresponding continuous time random walk model is presented. Furthermore, we investigate the effects of the stochastic resetting on the dynamics of the process and we showed that in the long time limit the system approaches a nonequilibrium stationary state.

Title: Growth and characterization of single crystal cubic TaN and hexagonal Ta$_2$N films on c-plane Sapphire
Authors: Anand Ithepalli, Amit Rohan Rajapurohita, Arjan Singh, Rishabh Singh, John Wright, Farhan Rana, Valla Fatemi, Huili (Grace)Xing, Debdeep Jena
Abstract: Two single crystal phases of tantalum nitride were stabilized on c-plane sapphire using molecular beam epitaxy. The phases were identified to be $\delta$-TaN with a rocksalt cubic structure and $\gamma$-Ta$_2$N with a hexagonal structure. Atomic force microscopy scans revealed smooth surfaces for both the films with root mean square roughnesses less than 0.3 nm. Phase-purity of these films was determined by x-ray diffraction. Raman spectrum of the phase-pure $\delta$-TaN and $\gamma$-Ta$_2$N obtained will serve as a future reference to determine phase-purity of tantalum nitride films. Further, the room-temperature and low-temperature electronic transport measurements indicated that both of these phases are metallic at room temperature with resistivities of 586.2 $\mu\Omega$-cm for the 30 nm $\delta$-TaN film and 75.5 $\mu\Omega$-cm for the 38 nm $\gamma$-Ta$_2$N film and become superconducting below 3.6 K and 0.48 K respectively. The superconducting transition temperature reduces with applied magnetic field as expected. Ginzburg-Landau fitting revealed a 0 K critical magnetic field and coherence length of 18 T and 4.2 nm for the 30 nm $\delta$-TaN film and 96 mT and 59 nm for the 38 nm $\gamma$-Ta$_2$N film. These tantalum nitride films are of high interest for superconducting resonators and qubits.

Title: Colossal magnetoresistance in a quasi-two-dimensional cluster glass semiconductor
Authors: Suman Kalyan Pradhan, Weiqi Liu, Jicheng Wang, Yongli Yu, Wenxing Chen, Jinbo Yang, Yanglong Hou, Rui Wu
Abstract: With a surge of interest in spintronics, the manipulation and detection of colossal magnetoresistance in quasi-two-dimensional layered magnetic materials have become a key focus, driven by their relatively scarce occurrence compared to giant magnetoresistance and tunneling magnetoresistance. This study presents an investigation into the desired colossal magnetoresistance, achieved by introducing magnetic frustration through Te doping in quasi-two-dimensional antiferromagnet Cr2Se3 matrix. The resulting Cr0.98SeTe0.27 exhibits cluster glass-like behavior with a freezing temperature of 28 K. Magnetotransport studies reveal a significant negative magnetoresistance of up to 32%. Additionally, angle-dependent transport measurements demonstrate a magnetic field-induced transition from positive to negative resistance anisotropy, suggesting a magnetic field-driven alteration in the electronic structure of this narrow band gap semiconductor, a characteristic feature of the colossal magnetoresistance effect. This behavior is further corroborated by density functional theory calculations. This systematic investigation provides a crucial understanding of the control of colossal magnetoresistance in quasi-two-dimensional materials via competing exchange interactions.

Title: Critical scaling behavior in skyrmion host ferromagnet CrTe1.38
Authors: Suman Kalyan Pradhan, Tuhin Debnath, Rui Wu
Abstract: Materials hosting diverse topological spin textures hold significant potential for spintronic applications. In this context, CrTe1.38, a quasi-two-dimensional material, stands out due to its stable N'eel-type skyrmion phase over a wide temperature range, both with and without an applied magnetic field [APL 125, 152402 (2024)]. Thus, it is a promising candidate for investigating complex magnetic phenomena, offering valuable insights into the underlying magnetic interactions. This study investigates the critical behavior of CrTe1.38 near TC by measuring DC magnetic isotherms. A systematic analysis of these isotherms with the magnetic field applied along the easy axis allows us to determine the asymptotic critical exponents: beta = 0.314, gamma = 1.069, and delta = 4.556, where the Widom scaling law and scaling equations are verified the self-consistency and reliability. In this system, the magnetic exchange coupling J(r) is the long-range type and decays spatially at a rate slower than approximately 4.651. Most notably, a series of vertical lines in the low-field region of the initial magnetization curves below TC supports the existence of a skyrmion phase in this compound

Title: Robust Prediction of Frictional Contact Network in Near-Jamming Suspensions Employing Deep Graph Neural Networks
Authors: Armin Aminimajd, Joao Maia, Abhinendra Singh
Abstract: The viscosity of the suspension consisting of fine particles dispersed in a Newtonian liquid diverges close to the jamming packing fraction. The contact microstructure in suspensions governs this macroscopic behavior in the vicinity of jamming through a frictional contact network (FCN). FCN is composed of mechanical load-bearing contacts that lead to the emergence of rigidity near the jamming transition. The stress transmission and network topology, in turn, depend sensitively on constraints on the relative motion of the particles. Despite their significance, predicting the FCN, especially close to jamming conditions, remains challenging due to experimental and computational impediments. This study introduces a cost-effective machine learning approach to predict the FCN using a graph neural network (GNN), which inherently captures hidden features and underlying patterns in dense suspension by mapping interparticle interactions. Employing a variation of GNN called the Deep Graph Convolutional Network (DeepGCN) trained on data-driven simulations, this study demonstrates robust generalization and extrapolation capabilities, accurately predicting FCNs in systems with divergent flow parameters and phase spaces, despite each being trained exclusively on a single condition. The study covers a wide range of phase space, from semi-dilute to jammed states, spanning transient to steady states, while systematically varying parameters such as shear stress (${\sigma}_{xy}$), packing fraction(${\phi}$) and sliding and rolling friction (${{\mu}_s, {\mu}_r}$). The results of this research pave the way for innovative transferable techniques in predicting the properties of particulate systems, offering new avenues for advancement in material science and related fields.

Title: Revisiting MnSe : a Magnetic Semiconductor with Spin-Phonon coupling
Authors: Suman Kalyan Pradhan, Arnab Bera, Soham Das, Yongli Yu, Jicheng Wang, Rui Wu
Abstract: Spin-phonon interactions in 2D magnetic materials are crucial in advancing next-generation spintronic devices. Therefore, identifying new materials with significant spin-phonon interactions is of great importance. In this context, MnSe, previously recognized as an exemplary non-layered p-type semiconductor emerges in this study as an intriguing material with notable spin-phonon characteristics. The complex magnetism in pristine MnSe, primarily dominated by antiferromagnetism with a weak ferromagnetic component, gives rise to both spontaneous and conventional exchange bias effects at low temperatures. In an effort to understand this intriguing magnetism, we conducted a detailed Raman spectroscopy study, which reveals unconventional deviations from the usual phonon anharmonicity around Neel temperature (170 K), in the self-energies of the P1, P2, and P3 modes. Notably, the P1 mode is most sensitive to spin-phonon coupling, while the P2 mode is particularly responsive to the structural phase transition at 250 K. Therefore, these findings provide comprehensive insights into the phase transitions of pristine MnSe, particularly highlighting the previously unobserved interplay between its magnetic behavior and phonon dynamics.

Title: Observation of Topological Nodal-Ring Phonons in Monolayer Hexagonal Boron Nitride
Authors: Zhiyu Tao, Yani Wang, Shuyi He, Jiade Li, Siwei Xue, Zhibin Su, Jiatao Sun, Hailin Peng, Jiandong Guo, Xuetao Zhu
Abstract: Topological physics has evolved from its initial focus on fermionic systems to the exploration of bosonic systems, particularly phononic excitations in crystalline materials. Two-dimensional (2D) topological phonons emerge as promising candidates for future technological applications. Currently, experimental verification of 2D topological phonons has remained exclusively limited to graphene, a constraint that hinders their applications in phononic devices. Here, we report experimental evidence of topological phonons in monolayer hexagonal boron nitride using advanced high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy. Our high-precision measurements explicitly demonstrate two topological nodal rings in monolayer hexagonal boron nitride, protected by mirror symmetry, expanding the paradigm of 2D topological phonons beyond graphene. This research not only deepens fundamental understanding of 2D topological phonons, but also establishes a phononic device platform based on wide-bandgap insulators, crucial for advancements in electronics and photonics applications.

Title: Pseudo-Hermitian physics from dynamically coupled macrospins
Authors: Peter Connick, Shane P. Kelly, Yaroslav Tserkovnyak
Abstract: We consider two classical macrospins with dynamical (frequency-dependent) coupling, modeled by a generalized Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. We show that, in the absence of local damping, the resulting dynamics are pseudo-Hermitian. When two precessional modes hybridize near a crossing, the spectral behavior takes the form either of an anticrossing or level attraction, with the latter formalized in terms of spontaneous $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry breaking. Near equilibrium, mixing due to nondissipative interactions results in repulsion, while dissipative mixing results in attraction. In contrast, when the fluctuating degrees of freedom form a free-energy saddle point, we find that nondissipative interactions result in level attraction, while dissipative interactions produce level repulsion. Accounting for the effects of local Gilbert damping, we examine the cases in which approximate $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry breaking is still possible and determine the degree to which the qualitative spectral properties still persist.

Title: High-Velocity Magnetic Domain Wall Motion Driven by Out-of-Plane Acoustic Spin
Authors: Jiacheng Lu, Fa Chen, Yiming Shu, Yukang Wen, Hang Zou, Yuhao Liu, Xiaofei Yang, Shiheng Liang, Wei Luo, Yue Zhang
Abstract: We predict high-velocity magnetic domain wall (DW) motion driven by out-of-plane acoustic spin in surface acoustic waves (SAWs). We demonstrate that the SAW propagating at a 30-degree angle relative to the x-axis of a 128 degree Y-LiNbO3 substrate exhibits uniform spin angular momentum, which induces the DW motion at a velocity exceeding 50 m/s, significantly faster than previous DW motions at about 1 m/s velocity driven by conventional SAWs. This remarkable phenomenon highlights the potential of acoustic spin in enabling rapid DW displacement, offering an innovative approach to developing energy-efficient spintronic devices.

Title: Stochastic Gross-Pitaevskii theory for a spin-1 Bose gas: Application to superfluidity in two dimensions
Authors: Andrew P. C. Underwood, P. B. Blakie
Abstract: This paper develops and implements the stochastic projected Gross-Pitaevskii equation for spin-1 Bose gases, addressing key considerations for numerical simulations. As an application of the theory we explore equilibrium phases in a two-dimensional spin-1 gas, where quasi-long-range order emerges via a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. Our analysis includes definition of superfluid densities for both mass and spin degrees of freedom, in a manner suitable for implementation within a stochastic projected Gross-Pitaevskii equation simulation. We present a finite-temperature phase diagram for the ferromagnetic spin-1 Bose gas and identify three distinct superfluid phases: two exhibiting conventional Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless-like behavior and a novel phase that simultaneously supports independent mass and spin superflows. As temperature increases, the stability region of this novel phase shrinks. This work provides a foundation for further studies of nonequilibrium and finite-temperature phenomena in spinor Bose gases.

Title: Pinch-point Singularities in Stress-Stress Correlations Reveal Rigidity in Colloidal Gels
Authors: Albert Countryman, H. A. Vinutha, Fabiola Diaz Ruiz, Xiaoming Mao, Emanuela Del Gado, Bulbul Chakraborty
Abstract: We demonstrate that the spatial correlations of microscopic stresses in 2D model colloidal gels obtained in computer simulations can be quantitatively described by the predictions of a theory for emergent elasticity of pre-stressed solids (vector charge theory). By combining a rigidity analysis with the characterization provided by the stress correlations, we show that the theoretical predictions are able to distinguish rigid from floppy gels, and quantify that distinction in terms of the size of a pinch-point singularity emerging at large length scales, which, in the theory, directly derives from the constraints imposed by mechanical equilibrium on the internal forces. We also use the theoretical predictions to investigate the coupling between stress-transmission and rigidity, and we explore the possibility of a Debye-like screening mechanism that would modify the theory predictions below a characteristic length scale.

Title: Phonon dynamics of a bulk WSe$_2$ crystal excited by ultrashort near-infrared pulses
Authors: Itsuki Kasai, Itsuki Takagi, Kazutaka G. Nakamura
Abstract: Pump-probe reflectivity measurements have been performed on a single crystal of tungsten diselenide (WSe$_2$) using ultrashort near-infrared pulses. The behavior is well reproduced in simulations superimposing three oscillations (7.45, 7.49 and 7.7 THz) with different phases. The Fourier transform spectrum features small peaks at 4.0 and 11.5 THz along with intense peaks at around 7.5 THz.

Title: Nested Shadows of Anyons:A Framework for Identifying Topological Phases
Authors: Yun-Tak Oh, Hyun-Yong Lee
Abstract: The 1-form symmetries in two-dimensional topological systems are ``shadowed'' as global symmetries in their one-dimensional quantum transfer matrices. In this work, we introduce a distinct shadow effect arising from the pair-creation of anyons, which manifests as a local symmetry of the quantum transfer matrix. The interplay between these two shadow effects provides a powerful framework for characterizing topological phases without extensive numerical simulations. Specifically, we derive the phase diagram of the filtered toric code state and precisely identify phase boundaries using the nested shadows of anyons. Additionally, we reveal that a class of topological states host gapless edge modes protected by 1-form symmetry rather than global symmetry. Finally, we apply our approach to the three-dimensional toric code and X-cube states, uncovering a nontrivial path in phase space that connects them through a subdimensional critical point, which is highly challenging to detect numerically due to the complexity of simulating three-dimensional systems.

Title: Symmetry breaking of large-amplitude parametric oscillations in a few-layer graphene nanomechanical resonator
Authors: Chen Yang, YuBin Zhang, Heng Lu, Ce Zhang, FengNan Chen, Ying Yan, Fei Xue, Alexander Eichler, Joel Moser
Abstract: Graphene nanomechanical resonators are well suited for the study of parametric oscillations. Their large frequency tunability and their pronounced nonlinearities enable an efficient modulation of their resonant frequency. Here, we present measurements of the response of a few-layer graphene nanomechanical resonator driven by a large parametric pump at frequency $2\omega$ and a weak external drive at $\omega$, where $\omega$ is set near the mechanical resonant frequency $\omega_0$. The pump actuates the resonator beyond the threshold for large-amplitude parametric oscillations, while the drive breaks the symmetry of the parametric phase states. By increasing and decreasing a gate voltage to detune $\omega_0$ in the presence of the pump and the drive, we observe a double hysteresis in the response. The double hysteresis reveals the existence of two possible large-amplitude vibrational states whose phase difference is nearly $\pi$ radians. We deterministically prepare the resonator in either one of these states by cycling the gate voltage. We measure the stationary occupation probabilities of the two states in the presence of a white Gaussian force noise, and find that they strongly depend on the amplitude and on the phase of the external drive. Parametric oscillations with broken phase symmetry hold promise as units of binary information. Their phase states can be mapped to biased bi-modal degrees of freedom, such as Ising spins in an external magnetic field. Our work invites future studies on coupled graphene parametric resonators whose phase states may be mapped to a system of Ising spins.

Abstract: Anisotropy plays a critical role in governing the mechanical, thermal, electrical, magnetic, and optical properties of materials, influencing their behavior across diverse applications. Probing and quantifying this directional dependence is crucial for advancing materials science and biomedical research, as it provides a deeper understanding of structural orientations at the molecular level, encompassing both scientific and industrial benefits. This study introduces the "4+ Angle Polarization" widget, an innovative extension to the open-source Quasar platform (this https URL), tailored for advanced multiple-angle polarization analysis. This toolbox enables precise molecular orientation analysis of complex microspectroscopic datasets through a streamlined workflow. Using polarized Fourier transform infrared (p-FTIR) spectroscopy, we demonstrate its versatility across various sample types, including polylactic acid (PLA) organic crystals, murine cortical bone, and human osteons. By overcoming the limitations of traditional two-angle methods, the widget significantly enhances the accuracy of structural and orientational analysis. This novel analytical tool expands the potential of multiple-angle p-FTIR techniques into advanced characterization of structural anisotropy in heterogeneous systems, providing transformative insights for materials characterization, biomedical imaging and beyond.

Title: Gate-Voltage-Driven Quantum Phase Transition at $0.7 (2e^2/h)$ in Quantum Point Contacts
Authors: Jongbae Hong
Abstract: The complex gate-voltage-dependent differential conductance in quantum point contacts, shaped by entangled-state tunneling, was demonstrated through the movement of a localized spin. This spin responds to variations in side gate voltage, triggering a quantum phase transition (QPT) between symmetric and asymmetric Kondo coupling states, with the states separated by conductance regions $G \geq 0.7 G_0$ and $G \leq 0.7 G_0$, where $G_0 = 2e^2/h$, respectively. The asymmetric state has two Kondo temperatures, while the symmetric state has only one. The presence of two Kondo temperatures in the asymmetric state clarifies previously unresolved issues, such as the indeterminate Kondo temperature and anomalous behavior in the width of the zero-bias anomaly (ZBA) in the $G \leq 0.7 G_0$ region. The QPT was investigated by analyzing the gate-voltage-dependent ZBA energy, calculated using the corresponding local density of states at the site of the localized spin, obtained during the replication of the differential conductance.

Title: Machine Learning a Phosphor's Excitation Band Position
Authors: Nakyung Lee, Małgorzata Sójka, Annie La, Syna Sharma, Seán Kavanagh, Docheon Ahn, David O. Scanlon, Jakoah Brgoch
Abstract: Creating superior lanthanide-activated inorganic phosphors is pivotal for advancing energy-efficient LED lighting and backlit flat panel displays. The most fundamental property these luminescent materials must possess is effective absorption/excitation by a blue InGaN LED for practical conversion into white light. The 5$d_1$ excited state energy level of lanthanides, which determines the excitation peak position, is influenced by the inorganic host structure, including the local environment, crystal structure, and composition, making it challenging to predict in advance. This study introduces a new extreme gradient boosting machine learning method that quantitatively determines a phosphor's longest (lowest energy) excitation wavelength. We focus on the Ce$^{3+}$ 4$f$ $\rightarrow$ 5$d$ transition due to its well-defined 5$d_1$ energy level observed in excitation and diffuse reflectance spectra. The model was trained on experimental data for 357 Ce$^{3+}$ cation substitution sites sourced from literature and in-house measurements and ultimately experimentally validated through the successful synthesis of a novel, blue-excited, green-emitting phosphor: Ca$_2$SrSc$_6$O$_{12}$:Ce$^{3+}$. This compound's excitation under commercial blue LED wavelength aligned remarkably well with the model's predictions. These results highlight the transformative potential of data-driven approaches in expediting the discovery of blue-absorbing phosphors for next-generation LED lighting.

Title: Engineering MoS2-MoTe2 Heterojunctions: Enhancing Piezoresponse and Rectification
Authors: Sai Saraswathi Yarajena, Akshay K. Naik
Abstract: Piezoelectric materials play a vital role in energy harvesting, piezotronics and various self-powered sensing applications. The piezoelectric strength of 2D materials is limited by the carrier charge screening, leading to reduced open circuit voltages and poor piezotronic performances. Reducing the carrier screening in devices is a key requirement to fully utilize the potential of 2D materials for piezoelectric applications. In this work, we demonstrate that lateral heterojunction devices offer an excellent way to improve the piezoelectric open circuit voltages and rectification ratios. Because of the asymmetric contacts with Nickel (Ni) electrodes, the heterojunctions of monolayer(1L) MoS_2 and MoTe_2 form a hybrid Schottky/p-n diode. We demonstrate a rectification ratio of more than 5000 without electrostatic gating. We observed that devices with higher junction potentials exhibit piezoelectric open-circuit voltages exceeding 1V and a peak power density of 690 mW/m^2. The output characteristics reveal a trade-off between open circuit voltages and rectification ratios. These findings and the role of built-in (cut-in) voltages in energy harvesting provide valuable insights for the design of piezotronic junctions to achieve high piezoelectric output and/or rectification ratios. Design aspects of heterojunctions discussed in this manuscript can be applied to other emerging nanomaterials.

Title: Exchange Coupling Modulation in MN4-Embedded Graphene Layers (M=Mn, Fe, Co, Cu) Under Strain
Authors: Mahnaz Rezaei, Jahanfar Abouie, Fariba Nazari
Abstract: MN4-embedded graphene (MN4-G) layers, with transition metal elements M, are experimentally accessible two-dimensional (2D) materials and show great potential for stable nanoscale magnetization. In these materials, the exchange couplings between magnetic atoms are predominantly governed by Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) coupling, exhibiting an unusual prolonged decay of r to the power of minus n, where r is the M-M separation distance, and n is between 0.5 and 2. In this paper, we explore the effects of induced strain on the electronic and magnetic properties of MN4-G layers through ab-initio density functional theory. We employ a specific method to apply strain by positioning atoms from one layer within the equilibrium structure of another layer, thereby inducing strain in the form of either tension or compression. The induced strain results in an approximate plus/minus 0.4% variation in the unit-cell area of the MN4-G lattice. Our findings reveal that while the exchange coupling mechanism remains unaffected, the strength, amplitude, and decay rate of the RKKY coupling are significantly influenced by the induced strain. Notably, the CoN4-G layer exhibits a remarkable increase in the strength and oscillation amplitude of the RKKY coupling, along with a reduced decay rate. Additionally, the electronic and magnetic properties of the CuN4-G layers remain unchanged under induced strain.

Title: Experimental Observation of Topological Disclination States in Lossy Electric Circuits
Authors: Jin Liu, Wei-Wu Jin, Zhao-Fan Cai, Xin Wang, Yu-Ran Zhang, Xiaomin Wei, Wenbo Ju, Zhongmin Yang, Tao Liu
Abstract: Topological phase transitions can be remarkably induced purely by manipulating gain and loss mechanisms, offering a novel approach to engineering topological properties. Recent theoretical studies have revealed gain-loss-induced topological disclination states, along with the associated fractional charge trapped at the disclination sites. Here, we present the experimental demonstration of topological disclination states in a purely lossy electric circuit. By designing alternating lossy electric circuit networks that correspond to the disclination lattice, we observe a voltage response localized at the disclination sites and demonstrate the robustness of these states against disorder. Furthermore, we measure the charge distribution, confirming the presence of fractional charge at the disclination sites, which gives rise to the topological disclination states. Our experiment provides direct evidence of gain-loss-induced topological disclination states in electric circuits, opening new possibilities for applications in classical systems.

Title: Unveiling Crystalline Order from Glassy Behavior of Charged Rods at Very Low Salt Concentrations
Authors: Hanna Anop, Laura Dal Compare, Frederic Nallet, Achille Giacometti, Eric Grelet
Abstract: Charged colloids can form ordered structures like Wigner crystals or glasses at very low concentrations due to long-range electrostatic repulsions. Here, we combine small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) and optical experiments with simulations to investigate the phase behavior of charged rodlike colloids across a wide range of salt concentrations and packing fractions. At ultra low ionic strength and packing fractions, we reveal both experimentally and numerically a direct transition from a nematic to a crystalline smectic-B phase, previously identified as a glass state. This transition, bypassing the smectic-A intermediate phase, results from minimizing Coulomb repulsion and maximizing entropic gains due to fluctuations in the crystalline structure. This demonstrates how long-range electrostatic repulsion significantly alters the phase behavior of rod-shaped particles and highlights its key-role in driving the self-organization of anisotropic particles.

Title: Reactive sputtering of SnS thin films using sulfur plasma and a metallic tin target: achieving stoichiometry and large grains
Authors: Daiki Motai, Issei Suzuki, Taichi Nogami, Takahisa Omata
Abstract: This study presents a novel method for fabricating stoichiometric SnS thin films with large grain sizes via reactive sputtering using a metallic Sn target and sulfur plasma (S-plasma). Unlike conventional approaches that rely on toxic H2S gas, this method employs a S-plasma to enhance sulfur reactivity and mitigate sulfur deficiencies during film deposition. By optimizing the balance between the sputtering conditions of the Sn target and the supply conditions of the S-plasma, dense single-phase SnS thin films with micron-scale grain sizes were achieved at a substrate temperature of 300 degree C, achieving an in-plane Hall mobility of 13 cm2 V-1 s-1. Furthermore, crystalline SnS thin films were fabricated even on a room-temperature substrate, enabling potential applications in flexible devices with heat-sensitive substrates. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of S-plasma in advancing SnS thin film fabrication, providing a safer and more efficient route to high-performance photovoltaic materials.

Železný, A.-L. Barra, C. Faugeras, J. Volný, K. Uhlířová, L. Nádvorník, M. Veis, K. Výborný, M. Orlita
Abstract: Antiferromagnetic resonance in a bulk $\alpha$-MnTe crystal is investigated using both frequency-domain and time-domain THz spectroscopy techniques. At low temperatures, an excitation at the photon energy of 3.5 meV is observed and identified as a magnon mode through its distinctive dependence on temperature and magnetic field. This behavior is reproduced using a simplified model for antiferromagnetic resonance in an easy-plane antiferromagnet, enabling the extraction of the out-of-plane component of the single-ion magnetic anisotropy reaching (40 $\pm$ 10) $\mu$eV.

Abstract: TaRhTe$_4$ is a type-IIWeyl semimetal, exhibiting fourWeyl points in proximity to the Fermi level. In this article, we report our results of a systematic study of longitudinal magnetoresistance in TaRhTe$_4$. Our findings indicate that magnetoresistance becomes negative only when the magnetic field is applied parallel to the electric field. By rotating E (as well as B), we show that its origin is consistent with the prediction of the chiral anomaly, while the current jetting effect and weak localization could be excluded. The negative magnetoresistance persists up to room temperature, suggesting that TaRhTe4 exhibits distinctive properties within the family of Weyl semimetals.

Title: Influence of Chemistry and Topography on the Wettability of Copper
Authors: Sarah Marie Lößlein, Rolf Merz, Yerila Rodríguez-Martínez (IJL), Florian Schäfer, Philipp Grützmacher, David Horwat (IJL), Michael Kopnarski, Frank Mücklich
Abstract: To understand the complex interplay of topography and surface chemistry in wetting, fundamental studies investigating both parameters are needed. Due to the sensitivity of wetting to miniscule changes in one of the parameters it is imperative to precisely control the experimental approach. A profound understanding of their influence on wetting facilitates a tailored design of surfaces with unique functionality. We present a multi-step study: The influence of surface chemistry is analyzed by determining the adsorption of volatile carbonous species (A) and by sputter deposition of metallic copper and copper oxides on flat copper substrates (B). A precise surface topography is created by laser processing. Isotropic topography is created by ps laser processing (C), and hierarchical anisotropic line patterns are produced by direct laser interference patterning (DLIP) with different pulse durations (D). Our results reveal that the long-term wetting response of polished copper surfaces stabilizes with time despite ongoing accumulation of hydrocarbons and is dominated by this adsorption layer over the oxide state of the substrate (Cu, CuO, Cu2O). The surfaces' wetting response can be precisely tuned by tailoring the topography via laser processing. The sub-pattern morphology of primary line-like patterns showed great impact on the static contact angle, wetting anisotropy, and water adhesion. An increased roughness inside the pattern valleys combined with a minor roughness on the peaks favors air-inclusions, isotropic hydrophobicity, and low water adhesion. Increasing the aspect ratio showed to enhance air-inclusions and hydrophobicity despite increased peak roughness while time dependent wetting transitions were observed.

Title: High-Pressure Tuning of Electrical Transport in Freestanding Oxide Films
Authors: Jingxin Chen, Xiang Huang, Zhihan Qiao, Jiao Li, Jiahao Xu, Haiyang Zhang, Deyang Li, Enyang Men, Hangtian Wang, Han Zhang, Jianyu Xie, Guolin Zheng, Mingliang Tian, Qun Niu, Lin Hao
Abstract: Electrical transport of oxide films under high pressure is largely unexplored due to the absence of a universal strategy. In this work, we have developed an in-house route to investigate the electrical transport properties of oxide films under high pressures, by improving the elasticity of freestanding oxide films and the robustness of high-pressure techniques on nano-devices. As a showcase, we investigated the electrical resistivity of perovskite SrIrO3 films under high pressures, and found a pressure-driven semimetal-to-insulator transition and an insulator-to-metal transition. At the monolayer-limit, the SrIrO3 films directly transform from an insulating state to a metallic state, highlighting the intriguing interplay of dimensionality and hydrostatic pressure in correlated oxides, which can be unveiled through the universal high-pressure strategy.

Title: Unlocking Hidden Potential in Electron Holography of Non-Collinear Spin Textures
Authors: Moritz Winterott, Samir Lounis
Abstract: Due to their particle-like properties, three-dimensional (3D) spin textures have garnered significant interest, particularly for their potential applications in next-generation information storage devices. However, efficiently identifying these textures remains a major challenge. Here, we approach this problem from a new perspective. Rather than relying solely on the magnetic stray field, which vanishes in antiferromagnets, we use multiple-scattering theory to demonstrate that spin textures carry nontrivial charges due to the noncollinearity of magnetic moments. This induced charge encodes magnetic information driven by spin-mixing and spin-orbit interactions. We propose leveraging electron holography to extract this information by reconstructing phase images obtained from transmission electron microscopy (TEM). To quantify this effect, we systematically calculate and compare the contributions of both conventional and newly identified mechanisms to the phase images, considering different electronic structure parameters. Our findings mark a significant milestone in advancing the exploration and possible application of 3D spin textures in next-generation spintronic devices.

Title: The Rise of Refractory Transition-Metal Nitride Films for Advanced Electronics and Plasmonics
Authors: Jiachang Bi, Ruyi Zhang, Xiong Yao, Yanwei Cao
Abstract: The advancement of semiconductor materials has played a crucial role in the development of electronic and optical devices. However, scaling down semiconductor devices to the nanoscale has imposed limitations on device properties due to quantum effects. Hence, the search for successor materials has become a central focus in the fields of materials science and physics. Transition-metal nitrides (TMNs) are extraordinary materials known for their outstanding stability, biocompatibility, and ability to integrate with semiconductors. Over the past few decades, TMNs have been extensively employed in various fields. However, the synthesis of single-crystal TMNs has long been challenging, hindering the advancement of their high-performance electronics and plasmonics. Fortunately, progress in film deposition techniques has enabled the successful epitaxial growth of high-quality TMN films. In comparison to reported reviews, there is a scarcity of reviews on epitaxial TMN films from the perspective of materials physics and condensed matter physics, particularly at the atomic level. Therefore, this review aims to provide a brief summary of recent progress in epitaxial growth at atomic precision, emergent physical properties (superconductivity, magnetism, ferroelectricity, and plasmon), and advanced electronic and plasmonic devices associated with epitaxial TMN films.

Title: Emergent fractals in hBN-encapsulated graphene based supermoiré structures and their experimental signatures
Authors: Deepanshu Aggarwal, Rohit Narula, Sankalpa Ghosh
Abstract: Supermoiré structures (SMS), formed by overlapping moiré-patterns in van der Waals heterostructures, display complex behaviour that lacks a comprehensive low-energy theoretical description. We demonstrate that these structures can form emergent fractals under specific conditions and identify the parameter space where this occurs in hexagonal trilateral SMS. This fractality enables a reliable calculation of low-energy band counts, which are crucial for understanding both single-particle and correlation effects. Using an effective Hamiltonian that includes in- and out-of-plane lattice relaxation, we analyze SMS in hBN-encapsulated single and bilayer graphene. We prescribe methods to experimentally verify these fractals and extract their fractal dimension through angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM).

Title: Stronger femtosecond excitation causes slower electron-phonon coupling in silicon
Authors: A. B. Swain, J. Kuttruff, J. Vorberger, P. Baum
Abstract: Electron-hole pairs in semiconductors are essential for solar cells and fast electronic circuitry, but the competition between carrier transport and relaxation into heat limits the efficiency and speed. Here we use ultrafast electron diffraction with terahertz pulse compression to measure the electron-phonon decay rate in single-crystal silicon as a function of laser excitation strength. We find that the excited electrons relax slower into phonons for higher carrier densities. The electron-phonon scattering rate changes in a nonlinear way from 400 fs at ~$2 \times 10^{20} \text{ cm}^{-3}$ to 1.2 ps at ~$4 \times 10^{20} \text{ cm}^{-3}$. These results indicate that a hot electron gas quenches the scattering into phonons in a temperature-dependent way. Ultrafast electronic circuitry of silicon therefore should work faster and provide higher bandwidths at lower carrier densities.

Title: Enhanced deep-freezing magneto- and elasto-caloric effects by modifying lattice anharmonicity and electronic structures
Authors: Xiao-Ming Huang, Ying Zhao, Xiaowen Hao, Hua-You Xiang, Jin-Han Yang, Chin-Wei Wang, Wenyun Yang, Cuiping Zhang, Binru Zhao, Jie Ma, Zongbin Li, Yafei Kuang, Liang Zuo, Xin Tong, Hai-Le Yan, Qingyong Ren
Abstract: Designing the high performance magneto or elastocaloric effect in NiMnIn alloys with spin-lattice coupling in a deep freezing temperature range of 200 K to 255 K is challenging due to the limited lattice entropy change and large negative contribution of magnetic entropy change during phase transitions. In this work, we systematically study the first order magneto-structural transition in NiMnIn based alloys by in-situ microstructural characterizations, physical property measurements, and first principles calculations. A multi element alloying strategy involving Cu and Ga co doping is proposed to manipulate the phase transition. The co doping reduces the lattice anharmonicity and thermal expansion coefficient of the martensitic phase, leading to an increase in the unit cell volume change and lattice entropy change. It also modifies the electronic density of states, causing a decrease in the magnetization change .The relief of the lattice mismatch reduces hysteresis losses in the refrigeration cycle. These synergetic effects yield excellent magneto and elastocaloric effects,with the effective magnetocaloric refrigeration capacity reaching up to 182 J/kg under the magnetic field of 5 T or an adiabatic temperature change of -4 K under a low field of 1.5 T and the elastocaloric coefficient of performance to 30 or an adiabatic temperature change of -7 K with the strain of 5% at 230 K, offering a potential solution for solid-state deep-freezing refrigeration.

Title: A few-layer graphene nanomechanical resonator driven by digitally modulated video signals
Authors: Ce Zhang, Heng Lu, Chen Yang, YuBin Zhang, FengNan Chen, Ying Yan, Joel Moser
Abstract: Nanomechanical resonators driven by multifrequency signals combine the physics of mesoscopic vibrations and the technologies of radio communication. Their simplest property stems from their resonant response: they behave as filters, responding only to driving signals whose frequency range is contained within that of the mechanical response. While the response is routinely probed with a single tone drive, a multifrequency drive offers the possibility of inducing richer vibrational dynamics. In this case, all the frequency components of the drive are simultaneously transduced into vibrations with different amplitudes and phases that superimpose and interfere. Here, we employ a few-layer graphene nanomechanical resonator as a filter for broadband, digitally modulated video signals. We transduce the modulated drive into modulated vibrations, which we demodulate into a nanomechanical video. Our work reveals distinctive features in vibrations driven by a coherent, multifrequency drive unseen in vibrations actuated by single tone drives or by a force noise.

Title: Machine learning short-ranged many-body interactions in colloidal systems using descriptors based on Voronoi cells
Authors: Rinske M. Alkemade, Rastko Sknepnek, Frank Smallenburg, Laura Filion
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) strategies are opening the door to faster computer simulations, allowing us to simulate more realistic colloidal systems. Since the interactions in colloidal systems are often highly many-body, stemming from e.g. depletion and steric interactions, one of the challenges for these algorithms is capturing the many-body nature of these interactions. In this paper, we introduce a new ML-based strategy for fitting many-body interactions in colloidal systems where the many-body interaction is highly local. To this end, we develop Voronoi-based descriptors for capturing the local environment and fit the effective potential using a simple neural network. To test this algorithm, we consider a simple two-dimensional model for a colloid-polymer mixture, where the colloid-colloid interaction and colloid-polymer interactions are hard-disk like, while the polymers themselves interact as ideal gas particles. We find that a Voronoi-based description is sufficient to accurately capture the many-body nature of this system. Moreover, we find that the Pearson correlation function alone is insufficient to determine the predictive power of the network emphasizing the importance of additional metrics when assessing the quality of ML-based potentials.

Title: Deciphering competing interactions of Kitaev-Heisenberg-$Γ$ system in clusters: part II -- dynamics of Majorana fermions
Authors: Sheikh Moonsun Pervez, Saptarshi Mandal
Abstract: We perform a systematic and exact study of Majorana fermion dynamics in the Kitaev-Heisenberg-$\Gamma$ model in a few finite-size clusters increasing in size up to twelve sites. We employ exact Jordan-Wigner transformations to evaluate certain measures of Majorana fermion correlation functions, which effectively capture matter and gauge Majorana fermion dynamics in different parameter regimes. An external magnetic field is shown to produce a profound effect on gauge fermion dynamics. Depending on certain non-zero choices of other non-Kitaev interactions, it can stabilise it to its non-interacting Kitaev limit. For all the parameter regimes, gauge fermions are seen to have slower dynamics, which could help build approximate decoupling schemes for appropriate mean-field theory. The probability of Majorana fermions returning to their original starting site shows that the Kitaev model in small clusters can be used as a test bed for the quantum speed limit.

Title: Efficient and Accurate Spatial Mixing of Machine Learned Interatomic Potentials for Materials Science
Authors: Fraser Birks, Thomas D Swinburne, James R Kermode
Abstract: Machine-learned interatomic potentials offer near first-principles accuracy but are computationally expensive, limiting their application in large-scale molecular dynamics simulations. Inspired by quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics methods, we present ML-MIX, an efficient and flexible LAMMPS package for accelerating simulations by spatially mixing interatomic potentials of different complexities. Through constrained linear fitting, we show it is possible to generate a 'cheap' approximate model which closely matches an 'expensive' reference in relevant regions of configuration space. We demonstrate the capability of ML-MIX through case-studies in Si, Fe, and W-He systems, achieving up to an 11x speedup on 8,000 atom systems without sacrificing accuracy on static and dynamic quantities, including calculation of minimum energy paths and dynamical simulations of defect diffusion. For larger domain sizes, we show that the achievable speedup of ML-MIX simulations is limited only by the relative speed of the cheap potential over the expensive potential. The ease of use and flexible nature of this method will extend the practical reach of MLIPs throughout computational materials science, enabling parsimonious application to large spatial and temporal domains.

Title: Quantifying local heterogeneities in the 3D morphology of X-PVMPT battery electrodes based on FIB-SEM measurements
Authors: L. Dodell, M. Neumann, M. Osenberg, A. Hilger, G. Studer, B. Esser, I. Manke, V. Schmidt
Abstract: Organic electrode-active materials (OAMs) not only enable a variety of charge and storage mechanisms, but are also safer for the environment and of lower cost compared to materials in commonly used lithium-ion batteries. Cross-linked Poly(3)-vinyl-N-methylphenothiazine (X-PVMPT) is a p-type OAM which shows high performance and enables fast and reversible energy storage in different battery configurations. The performance of an OAM does not only depend on its molecular or polymer structure, but also on the structure of the composite electrode. The porous nanostructure of an electrode composed of X-PVMPT, a conductive carbon additive and binder is investigated by statistical image analysis, based on 3D image data obtained by focused-ion beam scanning-electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) measurements. Univariate probability distributions of relevant morphological descriptors as well as bivariate distributions of pairs of such descriptors are parametrically modelled, among others, by utilization of copulas in the latter case. These models are then used for quantifying local heterogeneities of X-PVMPT considered in this paper. Furthermore, it is shown that the nanostructure changes when traversing from bottom to top face of the electrode, which influences its performance. While the observed short transportation paths trough the solid phase are beneficial in terms of electrical conductivity, the pathways through the pore phase influencing the effective ionic diffusivity are--in comparison--rather long.

Title: Topological Invariants in Invasion Percolation
Authors: Fernando Alonso-Marroquin
Abstract: Based on bond percolation theory, a method is presented here to calculate the relationship between capillary pressure and saturation in porous media from first principles. The governing equations are formulated on the undirected graph of the pore network. The graph is a simplified mathematical object that accounts for the topology of the pore structure. Thus, the calculation is extremely computationally efficient since it is mesh-free and voxel-free. Two topological invariants are identified: The bond percolation threshold and the residual saturation. Bond percolation theory is used to obtain a closed-form pressure-saturation relation in terms of the geometry of the pores (pore throat distribution) and material parameters (contact angle and interfacial tension), universal exponents, and topological invariants, based on scaling relations.

Title: Magnetic anisotropy and magnetoelastic properties of Weyl magnetic semimetal Co2MnGa thin films
Authors: O. Chumak, A. Nabiałek, L.T. Baczewski, T. Seki, J. Wang, K. Takanashi, H. Szymczak
Abstract: The magnetic anisotropy and magnetoelastic properties of the magnetic Weyl semimetal Co2MnGa were investigated by exploiting the Co2MnGa thin films with different chemical orderings. The epitaxial layers were grown by sputtering directly on MgO (001) and the annealing temperatures after the deposition were varied, which allowed us to change the chemical ordering of Co2MnGa. We observed a clear relationship between the annealing temperature and the parameters of magnetic property. The most significant changes of both the magnetic anisotropy and the magnetoelastic properties were correlated with the appearance of the L21 ordered phase, suggesting that the emergence of magnetic Weyl semimetallic feature is the key point to vary these magnetic properties.

Title: ZrN nucleation layer provides backside ohmic contact to MBE-grown GaN nanowires
Authors: Stanislav Tiagulskyi, Roman Yatskiv, Marta Sobanka, Karol Olszewski, Zbigniew R. Zytkiewicz, Jan Grym
Abstract: Self-assembled GaN nanowires are typically grown on Si substrates with convenient nucleation layers. Light-emitting devices based on arrays of GaN nanowires require that the nucleation layer is electrically conductive and optically nontransparent to prevent the absorption of generated light in the Si substrate. This study reports the molecular beam epitaxial growth of GaN nanowires on ZrN nucleation layers sputtered on sapphire and demonstrates that ZrN provides ohmic contact to dense vertical arrays of n-type GaN nanowires. The ohmic nature of the ZrN/n-type GaN nanowire contact is evidenced by the measurement of the current-voltage characteristics of individual as-grown nanowires using nanomanipulators in a scanning electron microscope. The limitations and advantages of single-nanowire measurements are discussed, and approaches to overcome these limitations are proposed. The feasibility of this concept is demonstrated by the measurement of single nanowire with a p-n junction, exhibiting highly rectifying characteristics.

Title: Bayesian optimization to infer parameters in viscoelasticity
Authors: Isaac Y. Miranda-Valdez, Tero Mäkinen, Juha Koivisto, Mikko J. Alava
Abstract: Inferring viscoelasticity parameters is a key challenge that often leads to non-unique solutions when fitting rheological data. In this context, we propose a machine learning approach that utilizes Bayesian optimization for parameter inference during curve-fitting processes. To fit a viscoelastic model to rheological data, the Bayesian optimization maps the parameter values to a given error function. It then exploits the mapped space to identify parameter combinations that minimize the error. We compare the Bayesian optimization results to traditional fitting routines and demonstrate that our approach finds the fitting parameters in a less or similar number of iterations. Furthermore, it also creates a "white-box" and supervised framework for parameter estimation in linear viscoelasticity modeling.

Title: Origin of Enhanced Performance when Mn-Rich Rocksalt Cathodes transform to $δ$-DRX
Authors: Shashwat Anand, Tara P. Mishra, Peichen Zhong, Yunyeong Choi, KyuJung Jun, Tucker Holstun, Gerbrand Ceder
Abstract: Most Mn-rich cathodes are known to undergo phase transformation into structures resembling spinel-like ordering upon electrochemical cycling. Recently, the irreversible transformation of Ti-containing Mn-rich disordered rock-salt cathodes into a phase -- named $\delta$ -- with nanoscale spinel-like domains has been shown to increase energy density, capacity retention, and rate capability. However, the nature of the boundaries between domains and their relationship with composition and electrochemistry are not well understood. In this work, we discuss how the transformation into the multi-domain structure results in eight variants of Spinel domains, which is crucial for explaining the nanoscale domain formation in the $\delta$-phase. We study the energetics of crystallographically unique boundaries and the possibility of Li-percolation across them with a fine-tuned CHGNet machine learning interatomic potential. Energetics of $16d$ vacancies reveal a strong affinity to segregate to the boundaries, thereby opening Li-pathways at the boundary to enhance long-range Li-percolation in the $\delta$ structure. Defect calculations of the relatively low-mobility Ti show how it can influence the extent of Spinel ordering, domain morphology and size significantly; leading to guidelines for engineering electrochemical performance through changes in composition.

Title: From pure to mixed: Altermagnets as intrinsic symmetry-breaking indicators
Authors: Aline Ramires
Abstract: We propose using altermagnetic phases as intrinsic symmetry-breaking indicators. The transmutation of pure into mixed altermagnets in the presence of spin-orbit coupling and the concomitant development of an anomalous Hall response can be associated with the breaking of specific lattice symmetries by external fields or the development of subleading order parameters. We introduce the basic ideas in the context of RuO$_2$ and discuss the case of surface magnetism in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$. Our study suggests that if Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ hosts a pure altermagnet on its surface, the onset of specific superconducting states could transmute this altermagnet from pure to mixed and account for the apparent onset of time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB) at the superconducting transition temperature, without necessarily ascribing TRSB to the superconducting state. Further investigation of this unusual scenario could provide essential steps toward a more coherent picture of the phenomenology of this material.

Title: Embodying mechano-fluidic memory in soft machines to program behaviors upon interactions
Authors: Alberto Comoretto, Tanaya Mandke, Johannes T.B. Overvelde
Abstract: Soft machines display shape adaptation to external circumstances due to their intrinsic compliance. To achieve increasingly more responsive behaviors upon interactions without relying on centralized computation, embodying memory directly in the machines' structure is crucial. Here, we harness the bistability of elastic shells to alter the fluidic properties of an enclosed cavity, thereby switching between stable frequency states of a locomoting self-oscillating machine. To program these memory states upon interactions, we develop fluidic circuits surrounding the bistable shell, with soft tubes that kink and unkink when externally touched. We implement circuits for both long-term and short-term memory in a soft machine that switches behaviors in response to a human user and that autonomously changes direction after detecting a wall. By harnessing only geometry and elasticity, embodying memory allows physical structures without a central brain to exhibit autonomous feats that are typically reserved for computer-based robotic systems.

Title: Theory of Electro-Ionic Perturbations at Supported Electrocatalyst Nanoparticles
Authors: Yufan Zhang, Tobias Binninger, Jun Huang, Michael Eikerling
Abstract: Nanoscopic heterogeneities in composition and structure are quintessential for the properties of electrocatalyst materials. Here, we present a semiclassical model to study the electrochemical properties of supported electrocatalyst nanoparticles (NP). The model captures the correlated electronic and ionic equilibration across NP, support, and electrolyte. It reveals peculiar trends in surface charging of the supported NP, validated by comparison with first-principles calculations. Support-induced perturbations in electronic and ionic charge densities at the NP's active surface manifest as distinct potentials of zero local electronic and ionic charges that could differ by more than 0.5 V in the studied system.

Title: Enhanced Efficiency in Shear-Loaded Brownian Gyrators
Authors: Iman Abdoli, Abhinav Sharma, Hartmut Löwen
Abstract: A Brownian gyrator is a system in which a particle experiences thermal noise from two distinct heat baths. This nonequilibrium setup inherently generates a nonzero torque, leading to gyrating motion around a potential energy minimum. As a minimal model for a heat engine, the Brownian gyrator provides valuable insights into energy conversion and nonequilibrium dynamics. Here, we investigate the effect of an externally imposed shear flow on a Brownian gyrator, treating it as a mechanical load. The shear flow introduces a tunable mechanism that allows the system to operate either as a heat engine, extracting work from the temperature gradient, or as a refrigerator, transferring heat from the colder to the hotter bath. Focusing on the heat engine regime, we analytically derive the steady-state probability distribution to compute the average torque exerted by the gyrator and quantify the mechanical power extracted from the shear. Our results show a remarkable increase in efficiency compared to the standard Brownian gyrator without shear, approaching Carnot efficiency at maximum power. Surprisingly, we also find that while the system can operate efficiently as a heat engine, it may become unstable before reaching the stall condition, highlighting a fundamental trade-off between efficiency and stability in shear-driven microscopic engines.

Title: Thermalization in a simple spin-chain model
Authors: Peter Reimann, Christian Eidecker-Dunkel
Abstract: We consider the common spin-1/2 XX-model in one dimension with open boundary conditions and a large but finite number of spins. The system is in thermal equilibrium at times t<0, and is subject to a weak local perturbation (quantum quench) at t=0. Focusing mainly on single-spin perturbations and observables, we show that the system re-thermalizes for sufficiently large times t>0 without invoking any unproven assumptions besides the basic laws of quantum mechanics. Moreover, the time-dependent relaxation behavior is obtained in quantitative detail and is found to exhibit a wealth of interesting features.

Title: U(1) Dirac quantum spin liquid candidate in triangular-lattice antiferromagnet CeMgAl$_{11}$O$_{19}$
Authors: Yantao Cao, Akihiro Koda, M. D. Le, V. Pomjakushin, Benqiong Liu, Zhendong Fu, Zhiwei Li, Jinkui Zhao, Zhaoming Tian, Hanjie Guo
Abstract: Quantum spin liquid represents an intriguing state where electron spins are highly entangled yet spin fluctuation persists even at 0 K. Recently, the hexaaluminates \textit{R}MgAl$_{11}$O$_{19}$ (\textit{R} = rare earth) have been proposed to be a platform for realizing the quantum spin liquid state with dominant Ising anisotropic correlations. Here, we report detailed low-temperature magnetic susceptibility, muon spin relaxation, and thermodynamic studies on the CeMgAl$_{11}$O$_{19}$ single crystal. Ising anisotropy is revealed by magnetic susceptibility measurements. Muon spin relaxation and ac susceptibility measurements rule out any long-range magnetic ordering or spin freezing down to 50 mK despite the onset of spin correlations below $\sim$0.8 K. Instead, the spins keep fluctuating at a rate of 1.0(2) MHz at 50 mK. Specific heat results indicate a gapless excitation with a power-law dependence on temperature, $C_m(T) \propto T^{\alpha}$. The quasi-quadratic temperature dependence with $\alpha$ = 2.28(4) in zero field and linear temperature dependence in 0.25 T support the possible realization of the U(1) Dirac quantum spin liquid state.

Title: Majorana sweet spots in 3-site Kitaev chains
Authors: Rodrigo A. Dourado, Martin Leijnse, Rubén Seoane Souto
Abstract: Minimal Kitaev chains, composed of two quantum dots (QDs) connected via a superconductor, have emerged as an attractive platform to realize Majorana bound states (MBSs). These excitations exist when the ground state is degenerate. The additional requirement of isolating the MBS wavefunctions further restricts the parameter space to discrete sweet spots. While scaling up to Kitaev chains with more than two sites has the potential to improve the stability of the MBSs, longer chains offer more features to optimize, including the MBS localization length and the excitation gap. In this work, we theoretically investigate 3-site Kitaev chains and show that there are three different types of sweet spots, obtained by maximizing distinct MBS properties: genuine 3-site sweet spots with well-localized MBSs at the ends, effective 2-site sweet spots, where the middle site acts as a barrier, and sweet spots with delocalized MBSs that overlap in the middle of the chain. These three cases feature different degrees of robustness against perturbations, with the genuine 3-site being the most stable. We analyze the energy spectrum, transport, and microwave absorption associated with these three cases, showing how to distinguish them.

Title: Spin and pair density waves in 2D altermagnetic metals
Authors: Nikolaos Parthenios, Pietro M. Bonetti, Rafael González-Hernández, Warlley H. Campos, Libor Šmejkal, Laura Classen
Abstract: Altermagnetism, a recently proposed and experimentally confirmed class of magnetic order, features collinear compensated magnetism with unconventional d-, g-, or i-wave spin order. Here, we show that in a metallic 2D d-wave altermagnet with combined two-fold spin and four-fold lattice rotational symmetry $[C_2||C_4]$, secondary instabilities can arise. Using an unbiased functional renormalization group approach, we analyze the weak-coupling instabilities of a 2D Hubbard model with a preexisting altermagnetic order inspired by our ab initio electronic structure calculations of realistic material candidates from V$_2$X$_2$O (X = Te, Se) family. We identify two distinct spin density wave (SDW) states that break the underlying altermagnetic $[C_2||C_4]$ symmetry. Additionally, we find spin-fluctuation-induced instabilities leading to a singlet d-wave superconducting state and an unconventional commensurate pair density wave (PDW) state with extended s-wave and spin-triplet symmetry. We establish a general criterion for the unusual exchange statistics for these pair density waves and characterize their excitation spectrum, which exhibits Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces or nodal points depending on the gap size.

Title: Time-Reversal Mirror inside a granular suspension: a way of measuring the ultrasound diffusion coefficient
Authors: Y. Abraham, B. A. van Tiggelen, N. Benech, C. Negreira, X. Jia, A. Tourin
Abstract: We demonstrate that the diffusion coefficient, $D$, for ultrasound propagating in a multiple scattering medium, such as a dense granular suspension, can be measured using a time reversal experiment. This requires an unprecedented experimental setup in which a piezoelectric transducer, acting as a Time-Reversal Mirror (TRM), is embedded within the granular suspension at a depth much larger than the scattering mean free path, while an array of transducers is placed in the far field of the scattering sample. A single element of the array emits a short pulse and the TRM records the resulting ultrasonic field, which consists of a ballistic coherent wave followed by a coda wave. When the entire coda wave is time-reversed and re-emitted from the TRM, it is observed to refocus on the original source, with a focal spot size that decreases with the inverse depth of the TRM, characteristic of a diffusive regime. Time-reversal of short windows selected at different times $t$ in the coda wave reveals a focal spot size that decreases as the inverse square root of time, i.e., $1 / \sqrt{Dt}$. By fitting the predictions of a microscopic diffusion theory to our experimental data, we are able to accurately measure the diffusion coefficient in the granular suspension. Remarkably, this method does not require ensemble averaging due to stability of time-reversal against statistical fluctuations.

Title: Quantum geometric moment encodes stacking order of moiré matter
Authors: Surat Layek, Subhajit Sinha, Atasi Chakraborty, Ayshi Mukherjee, Heena Agarwal, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Amit Agarwal, Mandar M. Deshmukh
Abstract: Exploring the topological characteristics of electronic bands is essential in condensed matter physics. Moiré materials featuring flat bands provide a versatile platform for engineering band topology and correlation effects. In moiré materials that break either time-reversal symmetry or inversion symmetry or both, electronic bands exhibit Berry curvature hotspots. Different stacking orders in these materials result in varied Berry curvature distributions within the flat bands, even when the band dispersion remains similar. However, experimental studies probing the impact of stacking order on the quantum geometric quantities are lacking. 1.4$^\circ$ twisted double bilayer graphene (TDBG) facilitates two distinct stacking orders (AB-AB, AB-BA) and forms an inversion broken \moire superlattice with electrically tunable flat bands. The valley Chern numbers of the flat bands depend on the stacking order, and the nonlinear Hall (NLH) effect distinguishes the differences in Berry curvature dipole (BCD), the first moment of Berry curvature. The BCD exhibits antisymmetric behavior, flipping its sign with the polarity of the perpendicular electric field in AB-AB TDBG, while it displays a symmetric behavior, maintaining the same sign regardless of the electric field's polarity in AB-BA TDBG. This approach electronically detects stacking-induced quantum geometry, while opening a pathway to quantum geometry engineering and detection.

Title: Tunable Josephson diode effect in singlet superconductor-altermagnet-triplet superconductor junctions
Authors: Lovy Sharma, Manisha Thakurathi
Abstract: Recently discovered phase of collinear magnet called, altermagnet breaks time reversal symmetry (TRS), exhibits momentum-dependent spin-splitting of band structure with zero net magnetization. In this work, we theoretically investigate the Josephson junction (JJ) of spin singlet superconductor (SC)/altermagnet/spin triplet SC and demonstrate that it manifests field free Josephson diode effect (JDE). We illustrate that there are four key requisites to have JDE in such JJs, namely, broken TRS, left and right SC in the JJ shall be non-identical, presence of spin orbit interaction, and anisotropy in spin polarization at the Fermi surface or anisotropy in pair potential of the SC. It has also been shown that by applying a gate potential in the altermagnetic regime, one can not only reverse the sign of efficiency but also modulate its magnitude. Our system can be used as a superconducting rectifier that can be tuned efficiently using gate voltage and system parameters without having external magnetic field.

Title: How to choose efficiently the size of the Bethe-Salpeter Equation Hamiltonian for accurate exciton calculations on supercells
Authors: Rafael R. Del Grande, David A. Strubbe
Abstract: The Bethe-Salpeter Equation (BSE) is the workhorse method to study excitons in materials. The size of the BSE Hamiltonian, that is how many valence to conduction band transitions are considered in those calculations, needs to be chosen to be sufficiently large to converge excitons' energies and wavefunctions but should be minimized to make calculations tractable, as BSE calculations scale with the number of atoms as $ (N_{\rm{atoms}}^6)$. In particular, in the case of supercell (SC) calculations composed of $N_{\rm{rep}}$ replicas of the primitive cell (PC), a natural choice to build this BSE Hamiltonian is to include all transitions from PC calculations by zone folding. However, this greatly increases the size of the BSE Hamiltonian, as the number of matrix elements in it is $(N_k N_c N_v)^2$, where $N_k$ is the number of $k$-points, and $N_{c(v)}$ is the number of conduction (valence) states. The number of $k$-points decreases by a factor $N_{\rm{rep}}$ but both the number of conduction and valence states increase by the same factor, therefore the BSE Hamiltonian increases by a factor $N_{\rm{rep}}^2$, making exactly corresponding calculations prohibitive. Here we provide an analysis to decide how many transitions are necessary to achieve comparable results. With our method, we show that to converge with an energy tolerance of 0.1 eV the first exciton binding energy of a LiF SC composed of 64 PCs, we only need 12\% of the valence to conduction transitions that are given by zone folding. We also show that exciton energies are much harder to converge than Random Phase Approximation transition energies, underscoring the necessity of careful convergence studies. The procedure in our work helps in evaluating excitonic properties in large SC calculations such as defects, self-trapped excitons, polarons, and interfaces.

Title: Rewards-based image analysis in microscopy
Authors: Kamyar Barakati, Yu Liu, Utkarsh Pratiush, Boris N. Slautin, Sergei V. Kalinin
Abstract: Analyzing imaging and hyperspectral data is crucial across scientific fields, including biology, medicine, chemistry, and physics. The primary goal is to transform high-resolution or high-dimensional data into an interpretable format to generate actionable insights, aiding decision-making and advancing knowledge. Currently, this task relies on complex, human-designed workflows comprising iterative steps such as denoising, spatial sampling, keypoint detection, feature generation, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and physics-based deconvolutions. The introduction of machine learning over the past decade has accelerated tasks like image segmentation and object detection via supervised learning, and dimensionality reduction via unsupervised methods. However, both classical and NN-based approaches still require human input, whether for hyperparameter tuning, data labeling, or both. The growing use of automated imaging tools, from atomically resolved imaging to biological applications, demands unsupervised methods that optimize data representation for human decision-making or autonomous experimentation. Here, we discuss advances in reward-based workflows, which adopt expert decision-making principles and demonstrate strong transfer learning across diverse tasks. We represent image analysis as a decision-making process over possible operations and identify desiderata and their mappings to classical decision-making frameworks. Reward-driven workflows enable a shift from supervised, black-box models sensitive to distribution shifts to explainable, unsupervised, and robust optimization in image analysis. They can function as wrappers over classical and DCNN-based methods, making them applicable to both unsupervised and supervised workflows (e.g., classification, regression for structure-property mapping) across imaging and hyperspectral data.

Title: Optimal neutralization of negative space charges in photon-enhanced thermionic emission devices under bidirectional discharge
Authors: Xinqiao Lin, Zhiqiang Fan, Shunjie Zhang, Xiaohang Chen, Zhimin Yang, Jincan Chen, Shanhe Su
Abstract: In this study, we innovatively modeled photon-enhanced thermionic emission (PETE) devices, incorporating positive ion injection and bidirectional discharge's effects on the space charge barrier simultaneously. Compared to previous models, our model allows the positive ion distribution function to be compatible with scenarios in which the anode motive is either higher or lower than the cathode motive, and also adapts to significant anode discharge. Through numerical simulations and parametric analyses, we found that: (1) As the ratio of the positive ion increases, the capability for space charge neutralization becomes stronger. (2) The lower the electron affinity is, the smaller the ratio of positive ions are required. (3) When the anode temperature is higher or the anode work function is lower, the impact of reverse discharge on the net current density is more pronounced. Conversely, when the anode temperature is higher or the anode work function is greater, the ratio of positive ions required to achieve complete space charge neutralization increases. This study further elucidates the mechanisms and characteristics of space charge neutralization effects in PETE devices, providing a theoretical foundation for optimizing their design. Additionally, the accompanying theory and algorithm possess the potential to spark innovative research across diverse fields.

Title: Applications of Statistical Field Theory in Deep Learning
Authors: Zohar Ringel, Noa Rubin, Edo Mor, Moritz Helias, Inbar Seroussi
Abstract: Deep learning algorithms have made incredible strides in the past decade yet due to the complexity of these algorithms, the science of deep learning remains in its early stages. Being an experimentally driven field, it is natural to seek a theory of deep learning within the physics paradigm. As deep learning is largely about learning functions and distributions over functions, statistical field theory, a rich and versatile toolbox for tackling complex distributions over functions (fields) is an obvious choice of formalism. Research efforts carried out in the past few years have demonstrated the ability of field theory to provide useful insights on generalization, implicit bias, and feature learning effects. Here we provide a pedagogical review of this emerging line of research.

Title: Gauging the complex SYK model
Authors: Ziruo Zhang, Cheng Peng
Abstract: Motivated by SYK-like models describing near-BPS black holes in string/M-theory, we consider gauging the U$(1)$ symmetry of the complex SYK model in the presence of a Wilson line with charge $k$. At a fixed background gauge field, solutions to the Schwinger-Dyson equations display vastly different properties from those at a fixed real chemical potential. In the partition function and the two-point function, the integral over the gauge field is performed either directly or via a large $N$ saddle point approximation, and both results are consistent with exact diagonalization data. From the behaviour of the two-point function at large $N$, we deduce that the conformal symmetry at low energies is preserved at fixed $\kappa = k/N = 0$, but broken at $\kappa\neq 0$. In addition, we find that there is maximal chaos for all $k$.

Title: Optimal Symbolic Construction of Matrix Product Operators and Tree Tensor Network Operators
Authors: Hazar Çakır, Richard M. Milbradt, Christian B. Mendl
Abstract: This research introduces an improved framework for constructing matrix product operators (MPOs) and tree tensor network operators (TTNOs), crucial tools in quantum simulations. A given (Hamiltonian) operator typically has a known symbolic "sum of operator strings" form that can be translated into a tensor network structure. Combining the existing bipartite-graph-based approach and a newly introduced symbolic Gaussian elimination preprocessing step, our proposed method improves upon earlier algorithms in cases when Hamiltonian terms share the same prefactors. We test the performance of our method against established ones for benchmarking purposes. Finally, we apply our methodology to the model of a cavity filled with molecules in a solvent. This open quantum system is cast into the hierarchical equation of motion (HEOM) setting to obtain an effective Hamiltonian. Construction of the corresponding TTNO demonstrates a sub-linear increase of the maximum bond dimension.

Title: Symmetries of Living Systems: Symmetry Fibrations and Synchronization in Biological Networks
Authors: Hernan A. Makse, Paolo Boldi, Francesco Sorrentino, Ian Stewart
Abstract: A symmetry is a `change without change'. As simple as it sounds, this concept is the fundamental cornerstone that unifies all branches of theoretical physics. Virtually all physical laws -- ranging from classical mechanics and electrodynamics to relativity, quantum mechanics, and the standard model -- can be expressed in terms of symmetry invariances. In this book, we explore whether the same principle can also explain the emergent laws of biological systems. We introduce a new geometry for biological networks and AI architectures, drawing inspiration from the mystic genius of Grothendieck's fibrations in category theory. We attempt to bridge the gap between physics and biology using symmetries but with a twist. The traditional symmetry groups of physics are global and too rigid to describe biology. Instead, the novel notion of symmetry fibration is local, flexible, and adaptable to evolutionary pressures, providing the right framework for understanding biological complexity. In other words, this more general symmetry invariance is necessary and sufficient to ensure that a given biological network configuration can support a synchronized function. In this book, we review the theoretical progress over the last decades from mathematics, physics, computer science, dynamical systems, and graph theory that has led to the discovery of symmetry fibrations in biological networks. These symmetries act as organizing principles for biological networks. They serve as effective tools for describing the structure of these networks, blending geometry and topology. Fibrations explain how structure dictates function across various biological domains, including the transcriptome, proteome, metabolome, and connectome. Additionally, they facilitate a reduction in the dimensionality of the network, simplifying it into its fundamental building blocks for biological computation.

Title: Work Statistics via Real-Time Effective Field Theory: Application to Work Extraction from Thermal Bath with Qubit Coupling
Authors: Jhh-Jing Hong, Feng-Li Lin
Abstract: Quantum thermal states are known to be passive, as required by the second law of thermodynamics. This paper studies the possible work extraction via coupling the thermal bath to a qubit of either spin, fermion, or topological types, which acts as a quantum thermal state at different temperatures. The amount of work extraction is derived from the work statistics under a cyclic nonequilibrium process. Though the work statistics of many-body systems are known to be challenging to calculate explicitly, we propose an effective field theory approach to tackle this problem by assuming the externally driven source to couple to a specific quasiparticle operator of the thermal state. We show that the work statistics can be expressed succinctly in terms of this quasiparticle's thermal spectral function. We obtain the non-perturbative work distribution function (WDF) for the pure thermal bath without the qubit coupling. With qubit coupling, we get the second-order WDF, from which the physical regime of work extraction can be pinned down precisely to help devise quantum engines.

Title: Efficient optimization of neural network backflow for ab-initio quantum chemistry
Authors: An-Jun Liu, Bryan K. Clark
Abstract: The ground state of second-quantized quantum chemistry Hamiltonians is key to determining molecular properties. Neural quantum states (NQS) offer flexible and expressive wavefunction ansatze for this task but face two main challenges: highly peaked ground-state wavefunctions hinder efficient sampling, and local energy evaluations scale quartically with system size, incurring significant computational costs. In this work, we develop algorithmic improvements for optimizing these wave-functions which includes compact subspace construction, truncated local energy evaluations, improved stochastic sampling, and physics-informed modifications. We apply these improvements to the neural network backflow (NNBF) ansatz finding that they lead to improved accuracy and scalability. Using these techniques, we find NNBF surpasses traditional methods like CCSD and CCSD(T), outperform existing NQS approaches, and achieve competitive energies compared to state-of-the-art quantum chemistry methods such as HCI, ASCI, and FCIQMC. An ablation study highlights the contribution of each enhancement, showing significant gains in energy accuracy and computational efficiency. We also examine the dependence of NNBF expressiveness on the inverse participation ratio (IPR), observing that more delocalized states are generally harder to approximate.

Title: Physics-Aware Inverse Design for Nanowire Single-Photon Avalanche Detectors via Deep Learning
Authors: Boyang Zhang, Zhe Li, Zhongju Wang, Yang Yu, Hark Hoe Tan, Chennupati Jagadish, Daoyi Dong, Lan Fu
Abstract: Single-photon avalanche detectors (SPADs) have enabled various applications in emerging photonic quantum information technologies in recent years. However, despite many efforts to improve SPAD's performance, the design of SPADs remained largely an iterative and time-consuming process where a designer makes educated guesses of a device structure based on empirical reasoning and solves the semiconductor drift-diffusion model for it. In contrast, the inverse problem, i.e., directly inferring a structure needed to achieve desired performance, which is of ultimate interest to designers, remains an unsolved problem. We propose a novel physics-aware inverse design workflow for SPADs using a deep learning model and demonstrate it with an example of finding the key parameters of semiconductor nanowires constituting the unit cell of an SPAD, given target photon detection efficiency. Our inverse design workflow is not restricted to the case demonstrated and can be applied to design conventional planar structure-based SPADs, photodetectors, and solar cells.

Title: Zipping many-body quantum states: a scalable approach to diagonal entropy
Authors: Yu-Hsueh Chen, Tarun Grover
Abstract: The outcomes of projective measurements on a quantum many-body system in a chosen basis are inherently probabilistic. The Shannon entropy of this probability distribution (the "diagonal entropy") often reveals universal features, such as the existence of a quantum phase transition. A brute-force tomographic approach to estimating this entropy scales exponentially with the system size. Here, we explore using the Lempel-Ziv lossless image compression algorithm as an efficient, scalable alternative, readily implementable in a quantum gas microscope or programmable quantum devices. We test this approach on several examples: one-dimensional quantum Ising model, and two-dimensional states that display conventional symmetry breaking due to quantum fluctuations, or strong-to-weak symmetry-breaking due to local decoherence. We also employ the diagonal mixed state to put constraints on the phase boundaries of our models. In all examples, the compression method accurately recovers the entropy density while requiring at most polynomially many images. We also analyze the singular part of the diagonal entropy density using renormalization group on a replicated action. In the 1+1-D quantum Ising model, we find that it scales as $|t| \log|t|$, where $t$ is the deviation from the critical point, while in a 2+1-D state with amplitudes proportional to the Boltzmann weight of the 2D Ising model, it follows a $t^2 \log|t|$ scaling.

Title: Scalable Low-overhead Superconducting Non-local Coupler with Exponentially Enhanced Connectivity
Authors: Haonan Xiong, Jiahui Wang, Juan Song, Jize Yang, Zenghui Bao, Yan Li, Zhen-Yu Mi, Hongyi Zhang, Hai-Feng Yu, Yipu Song, Luming Duan
Abstract: Quantum error correction codes with non-local connections such as quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) incur lower overhead and outperform surface codes on large-scale devices. These codes are not applicable on current superconducting devices with nearest-neighbor connections. To rectify the deficiency in connectivity of superconducting circuit system, we experimentally demonstrate a convenient on-chip coupler of centimeters long and propose an extra coupler layer to map the qubit array to a binary-tree connecting graph. This mapping layout reduces the average qubit entangling distance from O(N) to O(logN), demonstrating an exponentially enhanced connectivity with eliminated crosstalk. The entangling gate with the coupler is performed between two fluxonium qubits, reaching a fidelity of 99.37 % while the system static ZZ rate remains as low as 144 Hz without active cancellation or circuit parameter targeting. With the scalable binary tree structure and high-fidelity non-local entanglement, novel quantum algorithms can be implemented on the superconducting qubit system, positioning it as a strong competitor to other physics systems regarding circuit connectivity.

Title: Parallel spatial photonic Ising machine using spatial multiplexing for accelerating combinatorial optimization
Authors: Suguru Shimomura, Jun Tanida, Yusuke Ogura
Abstract: A spatial photonic Ising machine (SPIM) handles large-scale combinatorial optimization problems owing to optical processing with spatial parallelism. However, iterative feedback in the search for optimal solutions limits processing speed even though the Ising Hamiltonian is computed optically. We propose a parallel spatial photonic Ising machine (pSPIM) utilizing spatial multiplexing to search for an optimal solution efficiently. By employing grating patterns and encoding multiple sets of Ising spins in a phase distribution, several Ising Hamiltonians are computed simultaneously. We demonstrated that Max-Cut problems requiring 100 Ising spins are solved faster as the number of processing units increases. In addition, combining the multicomponent model with parallel processing allows for efficient searching for optimal solutions to problems represented by using interaction matrixes with a rank greater than one. The pSPIM achieves high-speed searching of optimal solutions of large-scale combinatorial optimization problems.

Title: Variational representation and estimates for the free energy of a quenched charged polymer model
Authors: Julien Poisat (CEREMADE)
Abstract: Random walks with a disordered self-interaction potential may be used to model charged polymers. In this paper we consider a one-dimensional and directed version of the charged polymer model that was introduced by Derrida, Griffiths and Higgs. We prove new results for the associated quenched free energy, including a variational formula based on a quenched large deviation principle established by Birkner, Greven and den Hollander. We also take the occasion to (i) provide detailed proofs for state-of-the-art results pointing towards the existence of a freezing transition and (ii) proceed with minor corrections for two results previously obtained by the present author with Caravenna, den Hollander and P{é}tr{é}lis for the undirected model.

Title: The Ising model as a window on quantum gravity with matter
Authors: Romuald A. Janik
Abstract: We argue that the Ising model CFT can be used to obtain some clear insights into 3D (quantum) gravity with matter. We review arguments for the existence of its holographic description, and concentrate on the time dependence of perturbations of the theory at high temperature, which would correspond to throwing matter into a black hole in the dual picture. Apart from an expected QNM-like exponential damping, we observe a plateau, a burst and a subsequent re-emergence of the whole signal, the latter being apparently at odds with a black hole interpretation. We provide an explanation of this phenomenon in terms of the properties of bulk matter fields and the fact that the geometry/metric is not fundamental but a derived quantity in the Chern-Simons formulation of 3D gravity. This allows for evading the black hole information paradox in the present context.

Title: Thermodynamics of Hamiltonian anyons with applications to quantum heat engines
Authors: Joe Dunlop, Álvaro Tejero, Michalis Skotiniotis, Daniel Manzano
Abstract: The behavior of a collection of identical particles is intimately linked to the symmetries of their wavefunction under particle exchange. Topological anyons, arising as quasiparticles in low-dimensional systems, interpolate between bosons and fermions, picking up a complex phase when exchanged. Recent research has demonstrated that similar statistical behavior can arise with mixtures of bosonic and fermionic pairs, offering theoretical and experimental simplicity. We introduce an alternative implementation of such statistical anyons, based on promoting or suppressing the population of symmetric states via a symmetry generating Hamiltonian. The scheme has numerous advantages: anyonic statistics emerge in a single particle pair, extending straightforwardly to larger systems; the statistical properties can be dynamically adjusted; and the setup can be simulated efficiently. We show how exchange symmetry can be exploited to improve the performance of heat engines, and demonstrate a reversible work extraction cycle in which bosonization and fermionization replace compression and expansion strokes. Additionally, we investigate emergent thermal properties, including critical phenomena, in large statistical anyon systems.

Abstract: Optical biosensors based on micro-/nano-fibers are highly valuable for probing and monitoring liquid environments and bioactivity. Most of current optical biosensors, however, are still based on glass, semiconductors, or metallic materials, which might be not fully suited for biologically-relevant environments. Here, we introduce biocompatible and flexible microfibers from Lotus silk as micro-environmental monitors that exhibit waveguiding of intrinsic fluorescence as well as of coupled light. These features make single-filament monitors excellent building blocks for a variety of sensing functions, including pH-probing and detection of bacterial activity. These results pave the way for the development of new and entirely eco-friendly, potentially multiplexed biosensing platforms.

Title: 2064 global population crisis scenario predicted by the most general dynamic model
Authors: Alessio Zaccone, Kostya Trachenko
Abstract: There is currently no consensus on how the global population will evolve in the next decades and in the next century. Currently, none of the known mathematical population-dynamic models can reproduce all these four types of functions as its solutions. This is of course a great impediment on the way towards forecasting trends in global population growth, which is an ever more urgent exercise in an era dominated by substantial climate and ecological threats. In this paper, we remedy to this situation by reporting on a population dynamic model, a single nonlinear differential equation adapted from the physics of disordered systems, which is able to mathematically describe all the various regimes encountered in the global population recorded as a function of time, over the past 12000 years until now. Regimes of simple exponential growth (Malthus), logistic (Verhulst) plateaus as well as stretched-exponential and compressed-exponential growth regimes are all reliably described by this mathematical equation in its various limits. In particular, two different scenarios are predicted. In one of them, which assumes that the future evolution would continue along a similar pattern as the past decades (hence without any major global ecological crisis affecting the resource exploitation), a von Foerster-type doomsday scenario with a sudden rise of the global population to unsustainable levels could appear as early as 2078. In the opposite scenario, if a global ecological crisis were to set in today, affecting the ability to exploit resources, given the current estimates of the Earth's carrying capacity, the global population is forecasted to reduce by half by 2064. Furthermore, the proposed dynamic model provides with a new aggregated parameter (K, in the model) that can be monitored and controlled so as to avoid the doomsday scenarios.

Title: Path integral spin dynamics with exchange and external field
Authors: Thomas Nussle, Stam Nicolis, Iason Sofos, Joseph Barker
Abstract: In this work, we propose a path integral-inspired formalism for computing the quantum thermal expectation values of spins, when subject to magnetic fields that can be time-dependent and can accommodate the presence of Heisenberg exchange interactions between the spins. This generalises the formalism presented in our previous work [Phys. Rev. Research 5, 043075 (2023)] and paves the way towards the realisation of large-scale atomistic simulations, for which this method should reveal its true efficiency gains, when compared to exact quantum methods. We compare our results with exact/numerical diagonalisation methods, where possible, to confirm the range of accuracy of our model.

Title: Design of Resistive Frequency Selective Surface based Radar Absorbing Structure-A Deep Learning Approach
Authors: Vijay Kumar Sutrakar, Nikhil Morge, Anjana PK, Abhilash PV
Abstract: In this paper, deep learning-based approach for the design of radar absorbing structure using resistive frequency selective surface is proposed. In the present design, reflection coefficient is used as input of deep learning model and the Jerusalem cross based unit cell dimensions is predicted as outcome. Sequential neural network based deep learning model with adaptive moment estimation optimizer is used for designing multi frequency band absorbers. The model is used for designing radar absorber from L to Ka band depending on unit cell parameters and thickness. The outcome of deep learning model is further compared with full-wave simulation software and an excellent match is obtained. The proposed model can be used for the low-cost design of various radar absorbing structures using a single unit cell and thickness across the band of frequencies.

Title: Oddities in the Entanglement Scaling of the Quantum Six-Vertex Model
Authors: Sunny Pradhan, Jesús Cobos, Enrique Rico, Germán Sierra
Abstract: We investigate the entanglement properties of the Quantum Six-Vertex Model on a cylinder, focusing on the Shannon-Renyi entropy in the limit of Renyi order $n = \infty$. This entropy, calculated from the ground state amplitudes of the equivalent XXZ spin-1/2 chain, allows us to determine the Renyi entanglement entropy of the corresponding Rokhsar-Kivelson wavefunctions, which describe the ground states of certain conformal quantum critical points. Our analysis reveals a novel logarithmic correction to the expected entanglement scaling when the system size is odd. This anomaly arises from the geometric frustration of spin configurations imposed by periodic boundary conditions on odd-sized chains. We demonstrate that the scaling prefactor of this logarithmic term is directly related to the compactification radius of the low-energy bosonic field theory description, or equivalently, the Luttinger parameter. Thus, this correction provides a direct probe of the underlying Conformal Field Theory (CFT) describing the critical point. Our findings highlight the crucial role of system size parity in determining the entanglement properties of this model and offer insights into the interplay between geometry, frustration, and criticality.

Title: Proper Effective Temperature and Order Parameters in Relativistic Non-Equilibrium Steady States
Authors: Shin Nakamura, Fuminori Okabayashi
Abstract: We examine the concept of temperature in non-equilibrium steady states. Using the D3-D5 model of gauge/gravity duality, we investigate spontaneous symmetry breaking in a relativistic (2+1)-dimensional defect moving at constant velocity within a (3+1)-dimensional heat bath. We find that the dependence of the order parameter on both the heat bath temperature and the defect velocity can be captured by a single variable -- the proper effective temperature -- for the moving defect. Our results suggest that the proper effective temperature is an essential parameter for a class of relativistic non-equilibrium steady states.

Abstract: Anderson localization physics features three fundamental types of eigenstates: extended, localized, and critical. Confirming the presence of critical states necessitates either advancing the analysis to the thermodynamic limit or identifying a universal mechanism which can determine rigorously these states. Here we report the unambiguous experimental realization of critical states, governed by a rigorous mechanism for exact quantum critical states, and further observe a generalized mechanism that quasiperiodic zeros in hopping couplings protect the critical states. Leveraging a superconducting quantum processor with up to 56 qubits, we implement a programmable mosaic model with tunable couplings and on-site potentials. By measuring time-evolved observables, we identify both delocalized dynamics and incommensurately distributed zeros in the couplings, which are the defining features of the critical states. We map the localized-to-critical phase transition and demonstrate that critical states persist until quasiperiodic zeros are removed by strong long-range couplings, confirming the generalized mechanism. Finally, we resolve the energy-dependent transition between localized and critical states, revealing the presence of anomalous mobility edges.

Title: Spatial mapping of intrinsic and readout nonlinearities in a strongly-driven micromechanical membrane
Authors: Timo Sommer, Agnes Zinth, Aditya, Menno Poot
Abstract: Recently, it was shown that strongly driven micromechanical resonators show mode shapes that strongly differ from the eigenmodes. This raises the question of the origin of this nonlinear behavior. We measure the spatial dependence of the nonlinearities of high-stress micromechanical membranes. The mechanical nonlinearity is determined from the frequency response and is found to be independent of the probing location. It is the phase of the response that is instrumental in extracting that intrinsic nonlinearity. Our interferometric readout results in high-harmonics generation. These harmonics have a clear spatial profile that shows ring-like patterns resembling previous reports. These patterns are reproduced by a model of the displacement-dependent reflection signal in combination with motion amplitudes of the same order as the probing wavelength.

Title: Enhancing the Scalability and Applicability of Kohn-Sham Hamiltonians for Molecular Systems
Authors: Yunyang Li, Zaishuo Xia, Lin Huang, Xinran Wei, Han Yang, Sam Harshe, Zun Wang, Chang Liu, Jia Zhang, Bin Shao, Mark B. Gerstein
Abstract: Density Functional Theory (DFT) is a pivotal method within quantum chemistry and materials science, with its core involving the construction and solution of the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian. Despite its importance, the application of DFT is frequently limited by the substantial computational resources required to construct the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian. In response to these limitations, current research has employed deep-learning models to efficiently predict molecular and solid Hamiltonians, with roto-translational symmetries encoded in their neural networks. However, the scalability of prior models may be problematic when applied to large molecules, resulting in non-physical predictions of ground-state properties. In this study, we generate a substantially larger training set (PubChemQH) than used previously and use it to create a scalable model for DFT calculations with physical accuracy. For our model, we introduce a loss function derived from physical principles, which we call Wavefunction Alignment Loss (WALoss). WALoss involves performing a basis change on the predicted Hamiltonian to align it with the observed one; thus, the resulting differences can serve as a surrogate for orbital energy differences, allowing models to make better predictions for molecular orbitals and total energies than previously possible. WALoss also substantially accelerates self-consistent-field (SCF) DFT calculations. Here, we show it achieves a reduction in total energy prediction error by a factor of 1347 and an SCF calculation speed-up by a factor of 18%. These substantial improvements set new benchmarks for achieving accurate and applicable predictions in larger molecular systems.

Title: U-Net 3+ for Anomalous Diffusion Analysis enhanced with Mixture Estimates (U-AnD-ME) in particle-tracking data
Authors: Solomon Asghar, Ran Ni, Giorgio Volpe
Abstract: Biophysical processes within living systems rely on encounters and interactions between molecules in complex environments such as cells. They are often described by anomalous diffusion transport. Recent advances in single-molecule microscopy and particle-tracking techniques have yielded an abundance of data in the form of videos and trajectories that contain critical information about these biologically significant processes. However, standard approaches for characterizing anomalous diffusion from these measurements often struggle in cases of practical interest, e.g. due to short, noisy trajectories. Fully exploiting this data therefore requires the development of advanced analysis methods -- a core goal at the heart of the recent international Anomalous Diffusion Challenges. Here, we introduce a novel machine-learning framework, U-net 3+ for Anomalous Diffusion analysis enhanced with Mixture Estimates (U-AnD-ME), that applies a U-Net 3+ based neural network alongside Gaussian mixture models to enable highly accurate characterisation of single-particle tracking data. In the 2024 Anomalous Diffusion Challenge, U-AnD-ME outperformed all other participating methods for the analysis of two-dimensional anomalous diffusion trajectories at both single-trajectory and ensemble levels. Using a large dataset inspired by the Challenge, we further characterize the performance of U-AnD-ME in segmenting trajectories and inferring anomalous diffusion properties.

Title: Chiral vortical conductivities and the moment of inertia of a rigidly rotating Fermi gas
Authors: M. Abedlou Ahadi, N. Sadooghi
Abstract: We determine the chiral vortical conductivities, as well as the orbital and spin moment of inertia of a charged, chiral, and rigidly rotating free Fermi gas. To this purpose, we begin by calculating the vacuum expectation values of a vector and axial vector current using the free fermion propagator in this medium. This propagator is derived by employing the Fock-Schwinger method based on the solutions of the Dirac equation in the presence of rotation and finite axial chemical potential. We present a complete derivation of these solutions. We demonstrate that in the first approximation, the chiral vortical conductivity associated with the vector current is proportional to the product of the vector and axial chemical potentials. In contrast, the chiral vortical conductivity related to the axial vector current depends on the temperature, the vector, and the axial vector chemical potential squares. We use the relation between the axial vector current and the angular momentum density associated with spin to determine the spin and the orbital moment of inertia of a rigidly rotating Fermi gas in a charged and chirally imbalanced medium separately. In addition, we compute the total moment of inertia by utilizing the methods presented in the first part of the paper and show that the orbital moment of inertia of a free fermion gas vanishes.

Title: Dynamical cluster-based optimization of tensor network algorithms for quantum circuit simulations
Authors: Andrea De Girolamo, Paolo Facchi, Peter Rabl, Saverio Pascazio, Cosmo Lupo, Giuseppe Magnifico
Abstract: We optimize Matrix-Product State (MPS)-based algorithms for simulating quantum circuits with finite fidelity, specifically the Time-Evolving Block Decimation (TEBD) and the Density-Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithms, by exploiting the irregular arrangement of entangling operations in circuits. We introduce a variation of the standard TEBD algorithm, we termed "cluster-TEBD", which dynamically arranges qubits into entanglement clusters, enabling the exact contraction of multiple circuit layers in a single time step. Moreover, we enhance the DMRG algorithm by introducing an adaptive protocol which analyzes the entanglement distribution within each circuit section to be contracted, dynamically adjusting the qubit grouping at each iteration. We analyze the performances of these enhanced algorithms in simulating both stabilizer and non-stabilizer random circuits, with up to $1000$ qubits and $100$ layers of Clifford and non-Clifford gates, and in simulating Shor's quantum algorithm with tens of thousands of layers. Our findings show that, even with reasonable computational resources per task, cluster-based approaches can significantly speed up simulations of large-sized quantum circuits and improve the fidelity of the final states.

Title: Operando XPS in Reactive Plasmas: The Importance of The Wall Reactions
Authors: J. Trey Diulus, Ashley R. Head, Jorge Anibal Boscoboinik, Andrei Kolmakov
Abstract: Advancements in differential pumping and electron optics over the past few decades have enabled x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements at (near-)ambient pressures, bridging the pressure gap for characterizing realistic sample chemistries. Recently, we demonstrated the capabilities of an ambient pressure XPS (APXPS) setup for in-situ plasma environment measurements, allowing plasma-surface interactions to be studied in operando rather than using the traditional before-and-after analysis approach. This new plasma-XPS technique facilitates the identification of reaction intermediates critical for understanding plasma-assisted surface processes relevant to semiconductor nanomanufacturing, such as physical vapor deposition, etching, atomic layer deposition, etc. In this report, we apply the plasma-XPS approach to monitor real-time surface chemical changes on a model Ag(111) single crystal exposed to oxidizing and reducing plasmas. We correlate surface-sensitive data with concurrent gas-phase XPS measurements and residual gas mass-spectra analysis of species generated during plasma exposure, highlighting the significant role of plasma-induced chamber wall reactions. Ultimately, we demonstrate that plasma-XPS provides comprehensive insights into both surface and gas-phase chemistry, establishing it as a versatile and dynamic characterization tool with broad applications in microelectronics research.

Title: Epitaxial high-K AlBN barrier GaN HEMTs
Authors: Chandrashekhar Savant, Thai-Son Nguyen, Kazuki Nomoto, Saurabh Vishwakarma, Siyuan Ma, Akshey Dhar, Yu-Hsin Chen, Joseph Casamento, David J. Smith, Huili Grace Xing, Debdeep Jena
Abstract: We report a polarization-induced 2D electron gas (2DEG) at an epitaxial AlBN/GaN heterojunction grown on a SiC substrate. Using this 2DEG in a long conducting channel, we realize ultra-thin barrier AlBN/GaN high electron mobility transistors that exhibit current densities of more than 0.25 A/mm, clean current saturation, a low pinch-off voltage of -0.43 V, and a peak transconductance of 0.14 S/mm. Transistor performance in this preliminary realization is limited by the contact resistance. Capacitance-voltage measurements reveal that introducing 7 % B in the epitaxial AlBN barrier on GaN boosts the relative dielectric constant of AlBN to 16, higher than the AlN dielectric constant of 9. Epitaxial high-K barrier AlBN/GaN HEMTs can thus extend performance beyond the capabilities of current GaN transistors.

Title: Thresholdless nonlinearity-induced edge solitons in trimer arrays
Authors: Magnus Johansson
Abstract: We consider a one-dimensional discrete nonlinear Schrödinger (DNLS) model with Kerr-type on-site nonlinearity, where the nearest-neighbor coupling constants take two different values ordered in a three-periodic sequence. The existence of localized edge states in the linear limit (Su-Schrieffer-Heeger trimer, SSH3) is known to depend on the precise location of the edge. Here, we show that for a termination that does not support linear edge states, an arbitrarily weak on-site nonlinearity will induce an edge mode with asymptotic exponential localization, bifurcating from a linear band edge. Close to the gap edge, the shape of the mode can be analytically described in a continuum approximation as one half of a standard gap soliton. The linear stability properties of nonlinear edge modes are also discussed.

Title: Measurements of extreme first passage times in photon transport
Authors: Aileen N. Carroll-Godfrey, Eric I. Corwin
Abstract: Photon transport through turbid media has typically been modeled through diffusion or telegraph equations. These models describe behavior of the average, or typical, photon with remarkable accuracy, however, we show here that they fail to capture the Extreme First Passage Times (EFPTs) of photon transport. By sending ultra-fast bursts of photons through a scattering medium and timing the arrival of the first passage photon, we measure the distribution of these EFPTs of photons in a random environment. Our measured EFPTs differ from those predicted by both the diffusion approximation and telegraph equation. Instead, we observe the EFPT as the time expected for light to travel through an index-averaged medium. These results reveal flaws in both models and invite a re-examining of their underlying assumptions.

Title: The chiral SYK model in three-dimensional holography
Authors: Alexander Altland, Dmitry Bagrets, Nele Callebaut, Konstantin Weisenberger
Abstract: A celebrated realization of the holographic principle posits an approximate duality between the $(0+1)$-dimensional quantum mechanical SYK model and two-dimensional Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity, mediated by the Schwarzian action as an effective low energy theory common to both systems. We here propose a generalization of this correspondence to one dimension higher. Starting from different microscopic realizations of effectively chiral $(1+1)$-dimensional generalizations of the SYK model, we derive a reduction to the Alekseev-Shatashvilli (AS)-action, a minimal extension of the Schwarzian action which has been proposed as the effective boundary action of three-dimensional gravity. In the bulk, we show how the same action describes fluctuations around the Euclidean BTZ black hole configuration, the dominant stationary solution of three-dimensional gravity. These two constructions allow us to match bulk and boundary coupling constants, and to compute observables. Specifically, we apply semiclassical techniques inspired by condensed matter physics to the computation of out-of-time-order correlation functions (OTOCs), demonstrating maximal chaos in the chiral SYK chain and its gravity dual.

Title: Towards a robust approach to infer causality in molecular systems satisfying detailed balance
Authors: Vittorio Del Tatto, Debarshi Banerjee, Ali Hassanali, Alessandro Laio
Abstract: The ability to distinguish between correlation and causation of variables in molecular systems remains an interesting and open area of investigation. In this work, we probe causality in a molecular system using two independent computational methods that infer the causal direction through the language of information transfer. Specifically, we demonstrate that a molecular dynamics simulation involving a single Tryptophan in liquid water displays asymmetric information transfer between specific collective variables, such as solute and solvent coordinates. Analyzing a discrete Markov-state and Langevin dynamics on a 2D free energy surface, we show that the same kind of asymmetries can emerge even in extremely simple systems, undergoing equilibrium and time-reversible dynamics. We use these model systems to rationalize the unidirectional information transfer in the molecular system in terms of asymmetries in the underlying free energy landscape and/or relaxation dynamics of the relevant coordinates. Finally, we propose a computational experiment that allows one to decide if an asymmetric information transfer between two variables corresponds to a genuine causal link.

Title: Work and heat exchanged during sudden quenches of strongly coupled quantum systems
Authors: Zohreh Davoudi, Christopher Jarzynski, Niklas Mueller, Greeshma Oruganti, Connor Powers, Nicole Yunger Halpern
Abstract: How should one define thermodynamic quantities (internal energy, work, heat, etc.) for quantum systems coupled to their environments strongly? We examine three (classically equivalent) definitions of a quantum system's internal energy under strong-coupling conditions. Each internal-energy definition implies a definition of work and a definition of heat. Our study focuses on quenches, common processes in which the Hamiltonian changes abruptly. In these processes, the first law of thermodynamics holds for each set of definitions by construction. However, we prove that only two sets obey the second law. We illustrate our findings using a simple spin model. Our results guide studies of thermodynamic quantities in strongly coupled quantum systems.

Title: Renormalized density matrix downfolding: A rigorous framework in learning emergent models from ab initio many-body calculations
Authors: Yueqing Chang, Sonali Joshi, Lucas K. Wagner
Abstract: We present a generalized framework, renormalized density matrix downfolding (RDMD), to derive systematically improvable, highly accurate, and nonperturbative effective models from ab initio calculations. This framework moves beyond the common role of ab initio calculations as calculating the parameters of a proposed Hamiltonian. Instead, RDMD provides the capability to decide whether a given effective Hilbert space can be identified from the ab initio data and assess the relative quality of ansatz Hamiltonians. Any method of ab initio solution can be used as a data source, and as the ab initio solutions improve, the resultant model also improves. We demonstrate the framework in an application to the downfolding of a hydrogen chain to a spin model, in which we find the interatomic separations for which a nonperturbative mapping can be made even in the strong coupling regime where standard methods fail, and compute a renormalized spin model Hamiltonian that quantitatively reproduces the ab initio dynamics.

Title: Micellization in active matter of asymmetric self-propelled particles: Experiments
Authors: Anastasia A. Molodtsova, Mikhail K. Buzakov, Oleg I. Burmistrov, Alina D. Rozenblit, Vyacheslav A. Smirnov, Daria V. Sennikova, Vadim A. Porvatov, Ekaterina M. Puhtina, Alexey A. Dmitriev, Nikita A. Olekhno
Abstract: Active matter composed of self-propelled particles features fascinating self-organization phenomena, spanning from motility-induced phase separation to phototaxis to topological excitations depending on the nature and parameters of the system. In the present paper, we consider micelle formation by active particles with a broken symmetry having a circular back and a sharpened nose toward which the particles accelerate. As we demonstrate in experiments with robotic swarms, such particles can either remain in the isotropic phase or form micelles depending on the location of their center of inertia, in accordance with a recent theoretical proposal [T. Kruglov, A. Borisov, Particles 2021, 2 (2021)]. Such a behavior is observed for both non-chiral particles moving linearly and placed in a parabolic potential and for chiral particles moving along circular trajectories on a flat surface. By performing experiments with single robots and two-robot collisions, we unveil that the observed emergence of micellization associated with shifting robots' center of inertia towards their noses is governed by at least two-particle effects, in particular, by a difference in the formation of stable two-robot clusters. Finally, we consider the dependence of micelle lifetime and formation probability as well as two-robot collisions on friction between the lateral surfaces of the robots. Crucially, the predicted micellization does not involve any solvation shells that give rise to the micellization of surfactants but is instead driven by an interplay of activity and particle shape asymmetry.

Title: Deciphering competing interactions of Kitaev-Heisenberg-$Γ$ system in clusters: part I -- static properties
Authors: Sheikh Moonsun Pervez, Saptarshi Mandal
Abstract: Recently, the Kitaev-Heisenberg-$\Gamma$ system has been used to explore various aspects of Kitaev spin liquid physics. Here, we consider a few small clusters of up to twelve sites and study them in detail to unravel many interesting findings due to the competition between all possible signs and various magnitudes of these interactions under the influence of an external magnetic field. When Heisenberg interaction is taken anti-ferromagnetic, one obtains plateaus in correlation functions where, surprisingly, the exact groundstate reduces to the eigenstate of Heisenberg interaction as well. On the other hand, for ferromagnetic Heisenberg interaction, its competition with Kitaev interaction results in non-monotonicity in the correlation functions. We discuss, in detail, the competing effects on low energy spectrum, flux operator, magnetization, susceptibility, and specific heat. Finally, we discuss how our findings could be helpful to explain some of the recent experimental and theoretical findings in materials with Kitaev interactions.

Title: High-chirality Weyl nodes in hexagonal ReO$_3$
Authors: Siyu Chen, Robert-Jan Slager, Bartomeu Monserrat, Adrien Bouhon
Abstract: The formation of two-band nodal points in gapless topological phases, referred to as conventional Weyl nodes, relies solely on translational symmetry. However, when coupled with other spatial and spatio-temporal symmetries, unconventional Weyl nodes with high degeneracy, pronounced chirality, and complementary quaternion charges can manifest. In this work, we identify ReO3 as an ideal unconventional Weyl semimetal in which rotation and screw symmetries as well as their combination with time-reversal symmetry play a crucial role. To show this, we first revisit in detail the algebraic determination of the chirality of Weyl nodes from the spinful irreducible representations of the occupied and unoccupied bands, and then combine it with the complementary C2T-symmetry-protected patch Euler class and non-Abelian frame charges that indicates the pinning of the Weyl nodes on C2T-invariant planes. Supporting our findings with first-principles calculations, we furthermore reveal very clear Fermi arc signatures of the high-chirality Weyl nodes at the Fermi level for different surface orientations. We finally investigate the effect of strain upon which the robustness of Weyl nodes clearly demonstrates their Chern (i.e. chirality conservation) and quaternionic (i.e. symmetry-plane pinning) topological nature.

Title: Auxiliary master equation approach to the Anderson-Holstein impurity problem out of equilibrium
Authors: D. Werner, R. Žitko, E. Arrigoni
Abstract: We introduce a method based on auxiliary master equation for solving the problem of an impurity with local electron-electron and electron-phonon interaction embedded between two conduction leads with a finite bias voltage. The Anderson-Holstein Hamiltonian is transformed to a corresponding Lindblad equation with a reduced set of sites providing an optimal approximation of the hybridization function. The problem is solved in the superfermion representation using configuration interaction for fermions and bosons. The phonon basis is shifted and rotated with the intention of permitting a low phonon basis cutoff even in the strong-coupling regime. We benchmark this approach with the numerical renormalization group in equilibrium, finding excellent agreement. We observe, however, that the rotation brings no advantage beyond the bare shift. This is even more apparent out of equilibrium, where issues in convergence with respect to the size of the phononic Hilbert space occur only in the rotated basis. As an application of the method, we explore the evolution of the phononic peak in the differential conductance spectra with changing phonon frequency.

Title: Strong non-linear response of strange metals
Authors: Serhii Kryhin, Subir Sachdev, Pavel A. Volkov
Abstract: We show that nonlinear transport responses in strange metals are strong, larger by a factor of $E_F/T$ than in Fermi liquids. Within the two-dimensional Yukawa-Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model of a Fermi surface with a spatially random coupling to a critical scalar, the third order conductivity is found to diverge as $1/T$ at low $T$, indicating the existence of a voltage-temperature scaling regime in the conductance. Its frequency and orientation dependence contains information on relaxation times of heat and electron distribution deformations, providing a new set of tools to characterize strange metals.

Title: Fidelity and criticality in the nonreciprocal Aubry-Andr{é}-Harper model
Authors: Chen-Chang Zeng, Zhen Cai, Guang-Heng Wang, Gaoyong Sun
Abstract: We study the critical behaviors of the ground and first excited states in the one-dimensional nonreciprocal Aubry-Andr{é}-Harper model using both the self-normal and biorthogonal fidelity susceptibilities. We demonstrate that fidelity susceptibility serves as a probe for the phase transition in the nonreciprocal AAH model. For ground states, characterized by real eigenenergies across the entire regime, both fidelity susceptibilities near the critical points scale as $N^{2}$, akin to the Hermitian AAH model. However, for the first-excited states, the fidelity susceptibilities exhibit distinct scaling laws, contingent upon whether the lattice consists of even or odd sites. For even lattices, both the self-normal and biorthogonal fidelity susceptibilities near the critical points continue to scale as $N^{2}$. In contrast, for odd lattices, the biorthogonal fidelity susceptibilities diverge, while the self-normal fidelity susceptibilities exhibit linear behavior, indicating a novel scaling law.

Title: Topological spin-torque diode effect in skyrmion-based magnetic tunnel junctions
Authors: Bin Fang, Riccardo Tomasello, Yuxuan Wu, Aitian Chen, Shuhui Liu, Baoshun Zhang, Emily Darwin, Hans J Hug, Mario Carpentieri, Wanjun Jiang, Xixiang Zhang, Giovanni Finocchio, Zhongming Zeng
Abstract: The growing market and massive use of Internet of Things nodes is placing unprecedented demands of energy efficient hardware for edge computing and microwave devices. In particular, magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs), as main building blocks of spintronic microwave technology, can offer a path for the development of compact and high-performance microwave detectors. On the other hand, the fascinating field of skyrmionics is bridging together concepts from topology and spintronics. Here, we show the proof of concept of the direct electrical excitation and detection of the dynamics of a topological protected magnetic texture, i.e. skyrmion at room temperature and for a wide region of applied fields, including the zero field case. This topological spin torque diode is realized with an MTJ on top of a skyrmionic material. Quantitative Magnetic Force Microscopy measurements are employed to confirm the existence of a single skyrmion in the MTJ free layer. Spin torque diode electrical measurements show the electrical excitation via spin transfer torque (STT) of a skyrmion resonant mode with frequencies near 4 GHz and a selectivity one order of magnitude smaller than the uniform modes excited in the same device. Micromagnetic simulations identify these dynamics with the excitation of the breathing mode and point out the role of thickness dependent magnetic parameters (magnetic anisotropy field and Dzyaloshinkii Moriya interaction) in both stabilizing and exciting the magnetic skyrmions. This work marks a milestone for the development of topological spin torque diodes.

Title: Giant Impurity Effects on Charge Loop Current Order States in Kagome Metals
Authors: Seigo Nakazawa, Rina Tazai, Youichi Yamakawa, Seiichiro Onari, Hiroshi Kontani
Abstract: The exotic electronic states in the charge loop current (cLC) phase, in which the permanent charge current breaks the time-reversal symmetry, have been attracting increasing attention in recently discovered kagome metals AV3Sb5 (A = Cs, Rb, K). Interestingly, the cLC state is sensitively controlled by applying a small magnetic field as well as a tiny uniaxial strain. In addition, many experiments indicate that the cLC state is sensitive to the small number of impurities. To understand the impurity effects on the cLC electronic states accurately, we analyze the giant unit-cell (up to 1200 sites) kagome lattice model with single impurity potential. The loop current is found to be strongly suppressed within the current correlation length $\xi_J$ centered on the impurity site, where $\xi_J$ increases as the cLC order parameter $\eta$ decreases. (The cLC order is the pure imaginary hopping integral modulation $\delta t_{i,j}=\pm i\eta$.) In addition, both the uniform orbital magnetization $M_{orb}$ and the anomalous Hall conductivity $\sigma_{xy}$ are drastically suppressed by dilute impurities. Especially, the suppression ratio $R=-\Delta M_{orb}/M_{orb}^0$ can exceed 50% with the introduction of 1% impurities. Unexpectedly, the ratio $R$ is qualitatively insensitive to $\eta$, in highly contrast to a naive expectation that $R$ is proportional to the current suppression area $\pi \xi_J^2$. The resulting giant impurity effect of $M_{orb}$ would originates from the nonlocal contribution of the itinerant circulation of electrons. The present study gives a natural explanation of why the cLC electronic states in kagome metals are sensitive to dilute impurities.

Title: Fermion-fermion interaction driven phase transitions in rhombohedral trilayer graphene
Authors: Qiao-Chu Zhang, Jing Wang
Abstract: The effects of short-range fermion-fermion interactions on the low-energy properties of rhombohedral trilayer graphene are comprehensively investigated using the momentum-shell renormalization group method. We take into account all one-loop corrections and establish the energy-dependent coupled evolutions of independent fermionic couplings that carry the physical information stemming from the interplay of various fermion-fermion interactions. With detailed numerical analysis, we observe that the ferocious competition among all fermion-fermion interactions can drive fermionic couplings to four distinct fixed points, dubbed $\textrm{FP}_{1}$, $\textrm{FP}_{2}$, $\textrm{FP}_{3}$, and $\textrm{FP}_{4}$, in the interaction-parameter space. These fixed points primarily dictate the fate of the system in the low-energy regime and are always associated with some instabilities characterized by specific symmetry breakings, leading to certain phase transitions. To determine the favorable states arising from the potential phase transitions, we introduce a number of fermion-bilinear source terms to characterize the underlying candidate states. By comparing their related susceptibilities, we find that the dominant states correspond to spin-singlet superconductivity, spin-triplet pair-density-waves, and spin-triplet superconductivity for fixed points $\textrm{FP}_{1,3}$, $\textrm{FP}_{2}$, and $\textrm{FP}_{4}$, respectively. These provide valuable insights into the low-energy properties of rhombohedral trilayer graphene and analogous materials.

Title: Upper bounds on the highest phonon frequency and superconducting temperature from fundamental physical constants
Authors: K. Trachenko, B. Monserrat, M. Hutcheon, C. J. Pickard
Abstract: Fundamental physical constants govern key effects in high-energy particle physics and astrophysics, including the stability of particles, nuclear reactions, formation and evolution of stars, synthesis of heavy nuclei and emergence of stable molecular structures. Here, we show that fundamental constants also set an upper bound for the frequency of phonons in condensed matter phases, or how rapidly an atom can vibrate. This bound is in agreement with \textit{ab initio} simulations of atomic hydrogen and high-temperature hydride superconductors, and implies an upper limit to the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ in condensed matter. Fundamental constants set this limit to the order of 10$^2-10^3$ K. This range is consistent with our calculations of $T_c$ from optimal Eliashberg functions. As a corollary, we observe that the very existence of the current research of finding $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ at and above $300$ K is due to the observed values of fundamental constants. We finally discuss how fundamental constants affect the observability and operation of other effects and phenomena including phase transitions.

Title: Kinetics of Quantum Reaction-Diffusion systems
Authors: Federico Gerbino, Igor Lesanovsky, Gabriele Perfetto
Abstract: We discuss many-body fermionic and bosonic systems subject to dissipative particle losses in arbitrary spatial dimensions $d$, within the Keldysh path-integral formulation of the quantum master equation. This open quantum dynamics represents a generalisation of classical reaction-diffusion dynamics to the quantum realm. We first show how initial conditions can be introduced in the Keldysh path integral via boundary terms. We then study binary annihilation reactions $A+A\to\emptyset$, for which we derive a Boltzmann-like kinetic equation. The ensuing algebraic decay in time for the particle density depends on the particle statistics. In order to model possible experimental implementations with cold atoms, for fermions in $d=1$ we further discuss inhomogeneous cases involving the presence of a trapping potential. In this context, we quantify the irreversibility of the dynamics studying the time evolution of the system entropy for different quenches of the trapping potential. We find that the system entropy features algebraic decay for confining quenches, while it saturates in deconfined scenarios.

Title: Mott insulators appearing at thickness period corresponding to nesting in CaRuO_3
Authors: M. Sakoda, H. Nobukane, S. Shimoda, K. Ichimura
Abstract: The typical material bismuth shows a several-fold change in electrical resistivity at 4 K over a 400 Å film thickness period. In 2021, we discovered a novel size effect with a period of 25 Å on strongly correlated compound CaRuO_3. The change in film thickness of only one nanometer leads to an increase in electrical resistivity at 4 K by a factor of several billion. However, the excitation energy of 2.4 eV on insulating CaRuO_3 is too large to explain the mechanism by conventional quantum well. In this study, we clarify that the increases in electrical resistivity are accompanied by lattice expansion and caused by the Mott transitions. We measured in-plane X-ray diffraction on CaRuO_3 films and found a 24.8 Å periodic thickness oscillation of the lattice spacing d_{(004)}. We determined the nesting vector from the Fermi surface and revealed the spin density wave with a period equivalent to the size effect. We concluded that the antiferromagnetic correlation appearing in the boundary conditions triggers the periodic Mott insulators depending on the film thickness.

Title: Evidence for simple "arrow of time functions" in closed chaotic quantum systems
Authors: Merlin Füllgraf, Jiaozi Wang, Jochen Gemmer
Abstract: Through an explicit construction, we assign to any infinite temperature autocorrelation function $C(t)$ a set of functions $\alpha^n(t)$. The construction of $\alpha^n(t)$ from $C(t)$ requires the first $2n$ temporal derivatives of $C(t)$ at times $0$ and $t$. Our focus is on $\alpha^n(t)$ that (almost) monotonously decrease, we call these ``arrows of time functions" (AOTFs). For autocorrelation functions of few body observables we numerically observe the following: An AOTF featuring a low $n$ may always be found unless the the system is in or close to a nonchaotic regime with respect to a variation of some system parameter. All $\alpha^n(t)$ put upper bounds to the respective autocorrelation functions, i.e. $\alpha^n(t) \geq C^2(t)$. Thus the implication of the existence of an AOTF is comparable to that of the H-Theorem, as it indicates a directed approach to equilibrium. We furthermore argue that our numerical finding may to some extent be traced back to the operator growth hypothesis. This argument is laid out in the framework of the so-called recursion method.

Title: Spin excitations in bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ superconductors with the interlayer pairing
Authors: Meiyu Lu, Tao Zhou
Abstract: Prompted by the recent discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure, this study delves into a theoretical investigation of spin excitations within this intriguing material. Through self-consistent mean-field calculations, we propose that superconductivity in this compound is primarily driven by interlayer pairing mechanisms. This interlayer pairing results in an effective $s_\pm$ pairing gap, with the sign of the pairing gap varying across different Fermi pockets. In the superconducting state, our analysis reveals a striking absence of a spin resonance mode. Moreover, we reveal a spectrum of energy-dependent incommensurate spin excitations. The observed incommensurate structures are elegantly explained by the nesting effect of energy contours, providing a coherent and comprehensive account of experimental observations. The implications of these spin excitations in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ are profound, offering critical insights into the superconducting mechanism at play. Our results not only contribute to the understanding of this novel superconductor but also pave the way for further research into the interplay between spin dynamics and unconventional superconductivity in layered materials.

Abstract: Multifractal analysis is a powerful tool for characterizing the localization properties of wave functions. Despite its utility, this tool has been predominantly applied to disordered Hermitian systems. Multifractal statistics associated with the non-Hermitian skin effect remain largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that the tree geometry induces multifractal statistics for the single-particle skin states on the Cayley tree by deriving the analytical expression of multifractal dimensions. This sharply contrasts with the absence of multifractal properties for conventional single-particle skin effects in crystalline lattices. Our work uncovers the unique feature of the skin effect on the Cayley tree and provides a novel mechanism for inducing multifractality in open quantum systems without disorder.

Title: Energy-efficient field-free unconventional spin-orbit torque magnetization switching dynamics in van der Waals heterostructures
Authors: Lalit Pandey, Bing Zhao, Karma Tenzin, Roselle Ngaloy, Veronika Lamparská, Himanshu Bangar, Aya Ali, Mahmoud Abdel-Hafiez, Gaojie Zhang, Hao Wu, Haixin Chang, Lars Sjöström, Prasanna Rout, Jagoda Sławińska, Saroj P. Dash
Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure of two-dimensional (2D) quantum materials offers a promising platform for efficient control of magnetization dynamics for non-volatile spin-based devices. However, energy-efficient field-free spin-orbit torque (SOT) switching and spin dynamics experiments to understand the basic SOT phenomena in all-2D vdW heterostructures are so far lacking. Here, we demonstrate energy-efficient field-free spin-orbit torque (SOT) switching and tunable magnetization dynamics in a vdW heterostructure comprising out-of-plane magnet Fe3GaTe2 and topological Weyl semimetal TaIrTe4. We measured the non-linear second harmonic Hall signal in TaIrTe4 /Fe3GaTe2 devices to evaluate the SOT-induced magnetization dynamics, which is characterized by a large and tunable out-of-plane damping-like torque. Energy-efficient and deterministic field-free SOT magnetization switching is achieved at room temperature with a very low current density. First-principles calculations unveil the origin of the unconventional charge-spin conversion phenomena, considering the crystal symmetry and electronic structure of TaIrTe4. These results establish that all-vdW heterostructures provide a promising route to energy-efficient, field-free, and tunable SOT-based spintronic devices.

Title: Group Conductivity and Nonadiabatic Born Effective Charges of Disordered Metals, Warm Dense Matter, and Hot Dense Plasma
Authors: Vidushi Sharma, Alexander J. White
Abstract: The average ionization state is a critical parameter in plasma models for charged particle transport, equation of state, and optical response. The dynamical or nonadiabatic Born effective charge (NBEC), calculated via first principles time-dependent density functional theory, provides exact ionic partitioning of bulk electron response for both metallic and insulating materials. The NBEC can be trivially transformed into a ''group conductivity," that is, the electron conductivity ascribed to a subset of ions. We show that for disordered metallic systems, such as warm dense matter (WDM) and hot dense plasma, the static limit of the NBEC is different from the average ionization state, but that the ionization state can be extracted from the group conductivity even in mixed systems. We demonstrate this approach using a set of archetypical examples, including cold and warm aluminium, low- and high- density WDM carbon, and a WDM carbon-beryllium-hydrogen mixture.

Title: Low-energy critical behavior in two-dimensional tilted semi-Dirac semimetals driven by fermion-fermion interactions
Authors: Wen Liu, Wen-Hao Bian, Xiao-Zhuo Chu, Jing Wang
Abstract: Employing the renormalization group approach, we carefully investigate the critical behavior of two-dimensional tilted semi-Dirac semimetals induced by the fermion-fermion interactions in the low-energy regime. After incorporating all one-loop corrections, we Employing the renormalization group approach, we carefully investigate the critical behavior of two-dimensional tilted semi-Dirac semimetals induced by the fermion-fermion interactions in the low-energy regime. After incorporating all one-loop corrections, we derive the coupled RG equations of all related parameters and introduce two distinct strategies, named as Strategy I and Strategy II, to describe different scenarios. A detailed numerical analysis yields several interesting behavior in the low-energy limit. At first, we notice that the fermion-fermion interactions either vanish or diverge in the Strategy I, depending on the initial values of the tilting parameter and the fermionic couplings, whereas these interactions in the Strategy II always diverge at a certain critical energy scale, which is associated with the initial conditions. Next, the microstructural parameter $\alpha$ and the fermion velocity $v_F$ in the Strategy I share the similar behavior with their Strategy II counterparts. It is observed that fermion-fermion interactions lead to an increase in $\alpha$ while driving a decrease in $v_F$. Furthermore, the system can either be attracted by the Gaussian fixed point (GFP) or certain relatively fixed point (RFP) in the Strategy I. However, it always flow towards the RFP in the Strategy II at the lowest-energy limit. These results would provide helpful insights into the studies on observable quantities and phase transitions in the two-dimensional tilted semi-Dirac semimetals and the analogous semimetals.

Title: Measurement resolution enhanced coherence for lattice fermions
Authors: H. M. Hurst, Yik Haw Teoh, I. B. Spielman
Abstract: Weak measurement enables the extraction of targeted information from a quantum system while minimizing decoherence due to measurement backaction. However, in many-body quantum systems backaction can have unexpected effects on wavefunction collapse. We theoretically study a minimal many-particle model consisting of weakly measured non-interacting fermions in a one dimensional lattice. Repeated measurement of on-site occupation number with single-site resolution stochastically drives the system toward a Fock state, regardless of the initial state. This need not be the case for measurements that do not, even in principle, have single-site spatial resolution. We numerically show for systems with up to 16 sites that decreasing the spatial resolution strongly affects both the rate of stochastic evolution for each quantum trajectory and the allowed final states. The full Hilbert space can be partitioned into backaction-free subspaces (BFSs) the elements of which are indistinguishable to these measurements. Repeated measurements will drive any initial state into a single BFS, leading to a steady state that is a fixed point of the measurement process. We exactly calculate the properties of these BFSs for systems up to 32 sites and find that even for moderate reductions in measurement resolution they yield non-trivial steady state entanglement and coherence.

Title: Nonreciprocal electrical transport in linear systems with balanced gain and loss in the bulk
Authors: Rupak Bag, Dibyendu Roy
Abstract: We investigate electrical transport in a quantum wire of $N$ sites connected to an equal number $(N_i/2)$ of sources and drains of charges in bulk. Each source and drain injects and extracts charges at the same rate, respectively. We show that the linear-response electrical current is nonreciprocal in such a system when the arrangement of sources and drains breaks the system's parity. We prove that inelastic scattering is essential for nonreciprocity in this system. For this, we invoke a master equation description of classical charge transport in a similar system. The nonreciprocal current in quantum wire matches that in the classical model for $N_i/N \sim 1$, generating a finite scattering length much smaller than the length of the wire. The nonreciprocity in the quantum wire oscillates with wire length when $N_i/N \ll 1$, and it can vanish at specific lengths.

Title: Shape of a membrane on a liquid interface with arbitrary curvatures
Authors: Zachariah S. Schrecengost, Seif Hejazine, Jordan V. Barrett, Vincent Démery, Joseph D. Paulsen
Abstract: We study the deformation of a liquid interface with arbitrary principal curvatures by a flat circular sheet. We use the membrane limit, where the sheet is inextensible yet free to bend and compress, and restrict ourselves to small slopes. We find that the sheet takes a cylindrical shape on interfaces with negative Gaussian curvature. On interfaces with positive Gaussian curvature, an inner region still adopts a cylindrical shape while the outer region is under azimuthal compression. Our predictions are confirmed by numerical energy minimization. Finally, we compute the energy of placing the sheet on the curved interface and find that it is much lower for positive Gaussian curvatures than for negative ones, that is, peaks and valleys are covered more efficiently than saddles.

Title: Magnetization texture imprints produced by flux avalanches in ferromagnet/insulator/superconductor heterostructures
Authors: Rovan F. Lopes, Milton A. Tumelero, Clodoaldo I. L. de Araujo, Antonio M. H. de Andrade, Fabiano Mesquita, Danusa Carmo, F. Colauto, W.A. Ortiz, P. Pureur
Abstract: The magnetic textures generated by a perpendicularly applied magnetic field at the ferromagnetic layer of $Co/Al_{2}O_{3}/Nb$ thin film heterostructures are investigated using magneto-optical imaging and micromagnetic simulations. It is observed that the stray field caused by flux avalanches in the superconducting layer prints out a non-trivial in-plane texture in the cobalt layer, which remains stable up to temperatures much above the Nb critical temperature. These textures mimic quite closely the dendritic thermomagnetic flux avalanches that penetrate the Nb layer from its edges. For low cobalt thickness, the filamentary magnetic textures occur in pairs with opposite polarity. The previous in-plane magnetization determines the relative location of the magnetic filaments with respect to the avalanche position. Micromagnetic simulations solving the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation confirm the interpretation given for the experimental findings.

Title: Kitaev model on Hurwitz hyperbolic tilings: A non-Abelian gapped chiral spin liquid
Authors: Rémy Mosseri, Yasir Iqbal, Roger Vogeler, Julien Vidal
Abstract: We study the Kitaev model on the trivalent heptagonal Hurwitz hyperbolic tiling. The presence of odd-length loops in the tiling is responsible for a spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking. Interestingly, at the isotropic point, the two degenerate ground states (Kramers pair) are shown to be gapped chiral spin liquids and the elementary excitations are non-Abelian Ising anyons.

Title: Re-entrant topological order in strongly correlated nanowire due to Rashba spin-orbit coupling
Authors: Kaushal Kumar Kesharpu, Evgenii A. Kochetov, Alvaro Ferraz
Abstract: The effect of the Rashba spin orbit coupling (RSOC) on the topological properties of the one-dimensional (1D) extended $s$-wave superconducting Hamiltonian, in the presence of strong electron-electron correlation, is investigated. It is found that a non-zero RSOC increases the periodicity of the effective Hamiltonian, which results in the folding of the Brillouin zone (BZ), and consequently in the emergence of an energy gap at the boundary of the BZ. Essentially the initial single band is divided into number of sub-bands. If the chemical potential lies inside the energy gaps (sub-bands) then the phase is topologically trivial (non trivial). This is the origin of re-entrant nature of the existent topological properties. The emergence of sub-bands allows us to drive the system in and out of the topological phase by the proper tuning of the chemical potential. A heterostructure involving van der Waals materials and a 1D Moire pattern for an investigation of the predicted effect has also been proposed. We also discuss how in-plane magnetic field can be used to control the RSOC coupling and induced periodicity in depleted InAs nanowire in which evidence of strong electron-electron correlation has been found.

Title: Near-field refractometry of van der Waals crystals
Authors: Martin Nørgaard, Torgom Yezekyan, Stefan Rolfs, Christian Frydendahl, N. Asger Mortensen, Vladimir A. Zenin
Abstract: Common techniques for measuring refractive indices, such as ellipsometry and goniometry, are ineffective for van der Waals crystal flakes because of their high anisotropy and small, micron-scale, lateral size. To address this, we employ near-field optical microscopy to analyze the guided optical modes within these crystals. By probing these modes in MoS$_2$ flakes with subwavelength spatial resolution at a wavelength of $1570\,\mathrm{nm}$, we determine both the in-plane and out-of-plane permittivity components of MoS$_2$ as $16.11$ and $6.25$, respectively, with a relative uncertainty below $1\%$, while overcoming the limitations of traditional methods.

Title: Mean first-passage time at the origin of a run-and-tumble particle with periodic forces
Authors: Pascal Grange, Linglong Yuan
Abstract: We consider a run-and-tumble particle on a half-line with an absorbing target at the origin. The particle has an internal velocity state that switches between two opposite values at Poisson-distributed times. The position of the particle evolves according to an overdamped Langevin dynamics with a spatially-periodic force field such that every point in a given period interval is accessible to the particle. The survival probability of the particle satisfies a backward Fokker--Planck equation, whose Laplace transform yields systems of equations for the moments of the first-passage time of the particle at the origin. The mean first-passage time has already been calculated assuming that the particle exits the system almost surely. We calculate the probability that the particle reaches the origin in a finite time, given its initial position and velocity. We obtain an integral condition on the force, under which the particle has a non-zero survival probability. The conditional average of the first-passage time at the origin over the trajectories that reach the origin) is obtained in closed form. As an application, we consider a piecewise-constant force field that alternates periodically between two opposite values. In the limit where the period is short compared to the mean free path of the particle, the mean first-return time to the origin coincides with the value obtained in the case of an effective constant drift, which we calculate explicitly.

Title: Electrodynamics of Vortices in Quasi-2D Scalar Bose-Einstein Condensates
Authors: Seong-Ho Shinn, Adolfo del Campo
Abstract: In two spatial dimensions, vortex-vortex interactions approximately vary with the logarithm of the inter-vortex distance, making it possible to describe an ensemble of vortices as a Coulomb gas. We introduce a duality between vortices in a quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) scalar Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) and effective Maxwell's electrodynamics. Specifically, we address the general scenario of inhomogeneous, time-dependent BEC number density with dissipation or rotation. Starting from the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE), which describes the mean-field dynamics of a quasi-2D scalar BEC without dissipation, we show how to map vortices in a quasi-2D scalar BEC to 2D electrodynamics beyond the point-vortex approximation, even when dissipation is present or in a rotating system. The physical meaning of this duality is discussed.

Title: Hallmarks of Deception in Asset-Exchange Models
Authors: Kristian Blom, Dmitrii E. Makarov, Aljaž Godec
Abstract: We investigate the transient and steady-state dynamics of the Bennati-Dragulescu-Yakovenko money game in the presence of probabilistic cheaters, who can misrepresent their financial status by claiming to have no money. We derive the steady-state wealth distribution per player analytically, and show how the presence of hidden cheaters can be inferred from the relative variance of wealth per player. In scenarios with a finite number of cheaters amidst an infinite pool of honest players, we identify a critical probability of cheating at which the total wealth owned by the cheaters experiences a second-order discontinuity. Below this point, the transition probability to lose money is larger than the probability to gain; conversely, above this point, the direction is reversed. We further establish a threshold cheating probability at which cheaters collectively possess half of the total wealth in the game. Lastly, we provide bounds on the rate at which both cheaters and honest players can gain or lose wealth, contributing to a deeper understanding of deception in asset exchange models.

Title: Non-Hermitian delocalization in 1D via emergent compactness
Authors: Liang-Hong Mo, Zhenyu Xiao, Roderich Moessner, Hongzheng Zhao
Abstract: Potential disorder in 1D leads to Anderson localization of the entire spectrum. Upon sacrificing hermiticity by adding non-reciprocal hopping, the non-Hermitian skin effect competes with localization. We find another route for delocalization, which involves imaginary potential disorder. While an entirely random potential generally still leads to localization, imposing minimal spatial structure to the disorder can protect delocalization: it endows the concomitant transfer matrix with an SU(2) structure, whose compactness in turn translates into an infinite localization length. The fraction of delocalized states can be tuned by the choice of boundary conditions.

Title: Metallic collinear antiferromagnets with mirror-symmetric and asymmetric spin-splittings
Authors: Vladimir A. Zyuzin
Abstract: In this paper we theoretically describe a distinct class of two-dimensional Néel ordered metallic antiferromagnets on a honeycomb-like lattice in which the two sublattices are connected only by a combination of time-reversal and mirror symmetry operations. As a result of this symmetry, conducting fermions have antiferromagnetic spin-splitting consistent with the symmetry, the mirror-symmetric spin-splitting. It is shown that the anomalous spin Hall effect is expected in such systems. We also consider a system in which there are no symmetries between the sublattices and obtain asymmetric spin-splitting. Such systems are expected to have the anomalous Hall effect.

Title: Brownian motion at various length scales with hydrodynamic and direct interactions
Authors: Jeffrey C. Everts, Robert Hołyst, Karol Makuch
Abstract: Brownian motion is essential for describing diffusion in systems ranging from simple to complex liquids. Unlike simple liquids, which consist of only a solvent, complex liquids, such as colloidal suspensions or the cytoplasm of a cell, are mixtures of various constituents with different shapes and sizes. Describing Brownian motion in such multiscale systems is extremely challenging because direct and many-body hydrodynamic interactions (and their interplay) play a pivotal role. Diffusion of small particles is mainly governed by a low viscous character of the solution, whereas large particles experience a highly viscous flow of the complex liquid on the macro scale. A quantity that encodes hydrodynamics on both length scales is the wave-vector-dependent viscosity. Assuming this quantity to be known -- in contrast to most studies in which the solvent shear viscosity is given -- provides a new perspective on studying the diffusivity of a tracer, especially in situations where the tracer size can vary by several orders of magnitude. Here, we start systematic studies of exact formal microscopic expressions for the short- and long-time self-diffusion coefficients of a single probe particle in a complex liquid in terms of short-ranged hydrodynamic response kernels. We study Brownian motion as a function of the probe size, contrasting most theories that focus on self-diffusion as a function of the crowder volume fraction. We discuss the limits of small and large probe sizes for various levels of approximations in our theory, and discuss the current successes and shortcomings of our approach.

Title: Ultrafast Chirality-dependent Dynamics from Helicity-resolved Transient Absorption Spectroscopy
Authors: Xiu Zhang, Lu Zhang, Junzhi Zhu, Tingxiao Qin, Haiyun Huang, Baixu Xiang, Haiyun Liu, Qihua Xiong
Abstract: Chirality, a pervasive phenomenon in nature, is widely studied across diverse fields including the origins of life, chemical catalysis, drug discovery, and physical optoelectronics. The investigations of natural chiral materials have been constrained by their intrinsically weak chiral effects. Recently, significant progress has been made in the fabrication and assembly of low-dimensional micro and nanoscale chiral materials and their architectures, leading to the discovery of novel optoelectronic phenomena such as circularly polarized light emission, spin and charge flip, advocating great potential for applications in quantum information, quantum computing, and biosensing. Despite these advancements, the fundamental mechanisms underlying the generation, propagation, and amplification of chirality in low-dimensional chiral materials and architectures remain largely unexplored. To tackle these challenges, we focus on employing ultrafast spectroscopy to investigate the dynamics of chirality evolution, with the aim of attaining a more profound understanding of the microscopic mechanisms governing chirality generation and amplification. This review thus provides a comprehensive overview of the chiral micro-/nano-materials, including two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), chiral halide perovskites, and chiral metasurfaces, with a particular emphasis on the physical mechanism. This review further explores the advancements made by ultrafast chiral spectroscopy research, thereby paving the way for innovative devices in chiral photonics and optoelectronics.

Title: Global symmetries of quantum lattice models under non-invertible dualities
Authors: Weiguang Cao, Yuan Miao, Masahito Yamazaki
Abstract: Non-invertible dualities/symmetries have become an important tool in the study of quantum field theories and quantum lattice models in recent years. One of the most studied examples is non-invertible dualities obtained by gauging a discrete group. When the physical system has more global symmetries than the gauged symmetry, it has not been thoroughly investigated how those global symmetries transform under non-invertible duality. In this paper, we study the change of global symmetries under non-invertible duality of gauging a discrete group $G$ in the context of (1+1)-dimensional quantum lattice models. We obtain the global symmetries of the dual model by focusing on different Hilbert space sectors determined by the $\mathrm{Rep}(G)$ symmetry. We provide general conjectures of global symmetries of the dual model forming an algebraic ring of the double cosets. We present concrete examples of the XXZ models and the duals, providing strong evidence for the conjectures.

Title: Duality breaking, mobility edges, and the connection between topological Aubry-André and quantum Hall insulators in atomic wires with fermions
Authors: Bar Alluf, C. A. R. Sa de Melo
Abstract: It is well known that the Aubry-Andr{é} model lacks mobility edges due to its energy-independent self-duality but may exhibit edge states. When duality is broken, we show that mobility regions arise and non-trivial topological phases emerge. By varying the degree of duality breaking, we identify mobility regions and establish a connection between Aubry-Andr{é} atomic wires with fermions and quantum Hall systems for a family of Hamiltonians that depends on the relative phase of laser fields, viewed as a synthetic dimension. Depending on the filling factor and the degree of duality breaking, we find three classes of non-trivial phases: conventional topological insulator, conventional topological Aubry-Andr{é} insulator, and unconventional (hybrid) topological Aubry-Andr{é} insulator. Finally, we discuss appropriate Chern numbers that illustrate the classification of topological phases of localized fermions in atomic wires.

Title: Ab initio modeling of single-photon detection in superconducting nanowires
Authors: Alejandro Simon, Reed Foster, Mihir Sahoo, James Shi, Emma Batson, Francesca Incalza, Matteo Castellani, Owen Medeiros, Christoph Heil, Karl K. Berggren
Abstract: Quasiparticle and phonon dynamics are central to the operation of many superconducting devices. Using a kinetic equation approach and Density Functional Theory, we model the nonequilibrium quasiparticle and phonon dynamics of a thin superconducting film under optical irradiation ab initio. We extend this model to develop a theory for the detection of single photons in superconducting nanowires. In doing so, we create a framework for exploring new superconducting materials for enhanced device performance beyond the state-of-the-art. In contrast to previous models of superconducting devices, our ab initio approach is capable of making predictions of device performance without experimental input and thus can be used to accelerate progress in device development. Our methods effectively integrate ab initio materials modeling with nonequilibrium theory of superconductivity to perform practical modeling of superconducting devices, providing a comprehensive approach that connects fundamental theory with device-level applications. Although we focus in this study on superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors, these methods are general, and they can be extended to model other superconducting devices, including transition-edge sensors, microwave resonators, and superconducting qubits.

Abstract: Research has demonstrated that zeolite nucleation and growth can be controlled by fine-tuning chemical composition, temperature, and pressure, resulting in structures with diverse porosities and functionalities. Nevertheless, current energy delivery methods lack the finesse required to operate on the femto- and picosecond timescales of silica polymerisation and depolymerisation, limiting their ability to direct synthesis with high precision. To overcome this limitation, we introduce an ultrafast laser synthesis technique capable of delivering energy at these timescales with unprecedented spatiotemporal precision. Unlike conventional or emerging approaches, this method bypasses the need for specific temperature and pressure settings, as nucleation and growth are governed by dynamic phenomena arising from nonlinear light-matter interactions, such as convective flows, cavitation bubbles, plasma formation, and shock waves. These processes can be initiated, paused, and resumed within fractions of a second, effectively freezing structures at any stage of self-assembly. Using this approach, we traced the entire nucleation and growth pathway of laser-synthesized TPA-silicate-1 zeolites, from early oligomer formation to fully developed crystals. The unprecedented spatiotemporal control of this technique unlocks new avenues for manipulating reaction pathways and exploring the vast configurational space of zeolites.

Title: A universal route from avalanches in mean-field models with random fields to stochastic Poisson branching events
Authors: Jordi Baró, Álvaro Corral
Abstract: Avalanches in mean-field models can be mapped to memoryless branching processes defining a universality class. We present a reduced expression mapping a broad family of critical and subcriticial avalanches in mean-field models at the thermodynamic limit to rooted trees in a memoryless Poisson branching processes with random occurrence times. We derive the exact mapping for the athermal random field Ising model and the democratic fiber bundle model, where avalanche statistics progress towards criticality, and as an approximation for the self-organized criticality in slip mean-field theory. Avalanche dynamics and statistics in the three models differ only on the evolution of the field density, interaction strength, and the product of both terms determining the branching number.

Title: Atom identification in bilayer moire materials with Gomb-Net
Authors: Austin C. Houston, Sumner B. Harris, Hao Wang, Yu-Chuan Lin, David B. Geohegan, Kai Xiao, Gerd Duscher
Abstract: Moire patterns in van der Waals bilayer materials complicate the analysis of atomic-resolution images, hindering the atomic-scale insight typically attainable with scanning transmission electron microscopy. Here, we report a method to detect the positions and identities of atoms in each of the individual layers that compose twisted bilayer heterostructures. We developed a deep learning model, Gomb-Net, which identifies the coordinates and atomic species in each layer, effectively deconvoluting the moire pattern. This enables layer-specific mapping of quantities like strain and dopant distributions, unlike other commonly used segmentation models which struggle with moire-induced complexity. Using this approach, we explored the Se atom substitutional site distribution in a twisted fractional Janus WS2-WS2(1-x)Se2x heterostructure and found that layer-specific implantation sites are unaffected by the moire pattern's local energetic or electronic modulation. This advancement enables atom identification within material regimes where it was not possible before, opening new insights into previously inaccessible material physics.

Title: Behavior of Ising spins and ecological oscillators on dynamically rewired small world networks
Authors: Davi Arrais Nobre, Karen C. Abbott, Jonathan Machta, Alan Hastings
Abstract: Many ecological populations are known to display a cyclic behavior with period 2. Previous work has shown that when a metapopulation (group of coupled populations) with such dynamics is allowed to interact via nearest neighbor dispersal in two dimensions, it undergoes a phase transition from disordered (spatially asynchronous) to ordered (spatially synchronous) that falls under the 2-D Ising universality class. While nearest neighbor dispersal may satisfactorily describe how most individuals migrate between habitats, we should expect a small fraction of individuals to venture on a journey to further locations. We model this behavior by considering ecological oscillators on dynamically rewired small-world networks, in which at each time step a fraction $p$ of the nearest neighbor interactions is replaced by a new interaction with a random node on the network. We measure how this connectivity change affects the critical point for synchronizing ecological oscillators. Our results indicate that increasing the amount of long-range interaction (increasing $p$) favors the ordered regime, but the presence of memory in ecological oscillators leads to quantitative differences in how much long-range dispersal is needed to order the network, relative to an analogous network of Ising spins. We also show that, even for very small values of $p$, the phase transition falls into the mean-field universality class, and argue that ecosystems where dispersal can occasionally happen across the system's length scale will display a phase transition in the mean-field universality class.

Title: Quantum critical electro-optic and piezo-electric nonlinearities
Authors: Christopher P. Anderson, Giovanni Scuri, Aaron Chan, Sungjun Eun, Alexander D. White, Geun Ho Ahn, Christine Jilly, Amir Safavi-Naeini, Kasper Van Gasse, Lu Li, Jelena Vučković
Abstract: Electro-optics, the tuning of optical properties of materials with electric fields, is key to a multitude of quantum and classical photonics applications. However, a major obstacle preventing many emerging use cases is inefficient modulation in cryogenic environments, as traditional tuning mechanisms degrade at low temperatures. Guided by the connection between phase transitions and nonlinearity, we identify the quantum paraelectric perovskite SrTiO$_3$ (STO) as the strongest cryogenic electro-optic photonic material. As a result of the unique quantum paraelectric phase of STO, we demonstrate a dynamically tunable linear Pockels coefficient ($r_{33}$) exceeding 500 pm/V at $T=5$ K, and study its full temperature and bias dependence. We also measure an enhanced piezo-electric coefficient ($d_{33}$) above 90 pC/N. Both of these coefficients exceed all previously reported values for cryogenic materials, including lithium niobate ($r_{33}\approx24$ pm/V) and barium titanate ($r_{42}\approx170$ pm/V). Furthermore, by tuning STO towards \textit{quantum criticality} with oxygen isotope substitution we more than double the optical and piezo-electric nonlinearities, demonstrating a linear Pockels coefficient above 1100 pm/V. Our results probe the link between quantum phase transitions, dielectric susceptibility, and optical nonlinearities, unlocking opportunities in cryogenic optical and mechanical systems, and provide a framework for discovering new nonlinear materials.

Authors: Daniel Werner, Enrico Arrigoni
Abstract: We present a functional interpolation approach within the auxiliary master equation framework to efficiently and accurately solve correlated impurity problems in nonequilibrium dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT). By leveraging a near-exact auxiliary bath representation, the method estimates corrections via interpolation over a few bath realisations, significantly reducing computational cost and increasing accuracy. We illustrate the approach on the Anderson impurity model and on the Hubbard model within DMFT, capturing equilibrium and long-lived photodoped states.

Abstract: Following electronic processes in molecules and materials at the level of the quantum mechanical electron wavefunction with angstrom-level spatial resolution and with full access to its femtosecond temporal dynamics is at the heart of ultrafast condensed matter physics. A breakthrough invention allowing experimental access to electron wavefunctions was the reconstruction of molecular orbitals from angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy data in 2009, termed photoemission orbital tomography (POT). This invention puts ultrafast three-dimensional (3D) POT in reach, with many new prospects for the study of ultrafast light-matter interaction, femtochemistry and photo-induced phase transitions. Here, we develop a synergistic experimental-algorithmic approach to realize the first 3D-POT experiment using a short-pulse extreme ultraviolet light source. We combine a new variant of photoelectron spectroscopy, namely ultrafast momentum microscopy, with a table-top spectrally-tunable high-harmonic generation light source and a tailored algorithm for efficient 3D reconstruction from sparse, undersampled data. This combination dramatically speeds up the experimental data acquisition, while at the same time reducing the sampling requirements to achieve complete 3D information. We demonstrate the power of this approach by full 3D imaging of the frontier orbitals of a prototypical organic semiconductor absorbed on pristine Ag(110).

Title: Global Anomalies on the Hilbert Space
Authors: Diego Delmastro, Davide Gaiotto, Jaume Gomis
Abstract: We show that certain global anomalies can be detected in an elementary fashion by analyzing the way the symmetry algebra is realized on the torus Hilbert space of the anomalous theory. Distinct anomalous behaviours imprinted in the Hilbert space are identified with the distinct cohomology "layers" that appear in the classification of anomalies in terms of cobordism groups. We illustrate the manifestation of the layers in the Hilbert for a variety of anomalous symmetries and spacetime dimensions, including time-reversal symmetry, and both in systems of fermions and in anomalous topological quantum field theories (TQFTs) in 2+1d. We argue that anomalies can imply an exact bose-fermi degeneracy in the Hilbert space, thus revealing a supersymmetric spectrum of states; we provide a sharp characterization of when this phenomenon occurs and give nontrivial examples in various dimensions, including in strongly coupled QFTs. Unraveling the anomalies of TQFTs leads us to develop the construction of the Hilbert spaces, the action of operators and the modular data in spin TQFTs, material that can be read on its own.

Abstract: We propose a definition of wavefunction "branchings": quantum superpositions which can't be feasibly distinguished from the corresponding mixed state, even under time evolution. Our definition is largely independent of interpretations, requiring only that it takes many more local gates to swap branches than to distinguish them. We give several examples of states admitting such branch decompositions. Under our definition, we argue that attempts to get relative-phase information between branches will fail without frequent active error correction, that branches are effectively the opposite of good error-correcting codes, that branches effectively only grow further apart in time under natural evolution, that branches tend to absorb spatial entanglement, that branching is stronger in the presence of conserved quantities, and that branching implies effective irreversibility. Identifying these branch decompositions in many-body quantum states could shed light on the emergence of classicality, provide a metric for experimental tests at the quantum/ classical boundary, and allow for longer numerical time evolution simulations. We see this work as a generalization of the basic ideas of environmentally-induced decoherence to situations with no clear system/ environment split.

Title: Schwinger-Keldysh nonperturbative field theory of open quantum systems beyond the Markovian regime: Application to spin-boson and spin-chain-boson models
Authors: Felipe Reyes-Osorio, Federico Garcia-Gaitan, David J. Strachan, Petr Plechac, Stephen R. Clark, Branislav K. Nikolic
Abstract: Open quantum systems with many interacting degrees of freedom pose a formidable challenge for presently available theoretical methods, especially when dissipative environment imposes non-Markovian dynamics on them with memory effects and revival of genuine quantum properties. Even the archetypical spin-boson model, where a single spin-1/2 interacts with an infinite bosonic bath, requires switching between methods for different choice of system and bath parameters. Here, we construct a field-theoretic framework as a single methodology that can handle many mutually interacting quantum spins of arbitrary value S, spatial dimensionality, system-bath coupling, bath temperature and spectral properties of the bath. Our framework combines Schwinger-Keldysh field theory (SKFT) with two-particle irreducible (2PI) action resumming a class of Feynman diagrams to an infinite order originating from 1/N expansion, where N is the number of Schwinger bosons to which the spin is mapped. Remarkably, the SKFT+2PI approach closely tracks numerically exact benchmarks for spin-boson in the non-Markovian regime obtained from hierarchical equations of motion or tensor network methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability of our SKFT+2PI framework to compute two-spin correlators of an antiferromagnetic quantum spin chain whose edge spins are coupled to a set of three bosonic baths (one for each spin component) at different temperatures. The favorable numerical cost of solving integro-differential equations produced by SKFT+2PI framework with increasing number of spins, time steps or spatial dimensionality makes it a promising route for simulation of driven-dissipative systems in quantum computing or quantum magnonics and quantum spintronics in the presence of a single or multiple dissipative environments.

Title: Quantum caloric effects
Authors: Clebson Cruz, J. S. Amaral, Mario Reis
Abstract: Quantum thermodynamics aims to explore quantum features to enhance energy conversion beyond classical limits. While significant progress has been made, the understanding of caloric potentials in quantum systems remains incomplete. In this context, this study focuses on deriving general expressions for these caloric potentials, by developing a quantum Maxwell relationship obtained from a thermal average form of the Ehrenfest theorem. Our results recover the classical cases and also reveal that the isothermal entropy change can be related to genuine quantum correlations in the system. Thus, this work aims to contribute to the understanding of the caloric behavior of quantum systems and their potential implication in caloric devices.

Title: Emergence of the Gibbs ensemble as a steady state in Lindbladian dynamics
Authors: Shi-Kang Sun, Shu Chen
Abstract: We explicitly construct unique non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) of Lindblad master equation characterized by a Gibbs ensemble $\rho_{\text{NESS}} \propto e^{-\beta \tilde{H}}$, where the effective hamiltonian $\tilde{H}$ is an element in the center of the commutant algebra $\mathcal{C}$ of the original hamiltonian. Specifically, if $\mathcal{C}$ is Abelian, then $\tilde{H}$ consists only of $U(1)$ conserved charges of the original Hamiltonian. When the original Hamiltonian has multiple charges, it is possible to couple them with bathes at different temperature respectively, but still leads to an equilibrium state. Multiple steady states arise if the number of bathes is less than the number of charges. To access the Gibbs NESS, the jump operators need to be properly chosen to fulfill quantum detailed balance condition (qDBC). These jump operators are ladder operators for $\tilde{H}$ and jump process they generate form a vertex-weighted directed acyclic graph (wDAG). By studying the XX model and Fredkin model, we showcase how the Gibbs state emerges as an equilibrium steady state.

Title: Non-Gaussian generalized two-mode squeezing: applications to two-ensemble spin squeezing and beyond
Authors: Mikhail Mamaev, Martin Koppenhöfer, Andrew Pocklington, Aashish A. Clerk
Abstract: Bosonic two-mode squeezed states are paradigmatic entangled Gaussian states that have wide utility in quantum information and metrology. Here, we show that the basic structure of these states can be generalized to arbitrary bipartite quantum systems in a manner that allows simultaneous, Heisenberg-limited estimation of two independent parameters for finite-dimensional systems. Further, we show that these general states can always be stabilized by a relatively simple Markovian dissipative process. In the specific case where the two subsystems are ensembles of two-level atoms or spins, our generalized states define a notion of two-mode spin squeezing that is valid beyond the Gaussian limit and that enables true multi-parameter estimation. We discuss how generalized Ramsey measurements allow one to reach the two-parameter quantum Cramer-Rao bound, and how the dissipative preparation scheme is compatible with current experiments.

Title: Remote Entangling Gates for Spin Qubits in Quantum Dots using a Charge-Sensitive Superconducting Coupler
Authors: Harry Hanlim Kang, Ilan T. Rosen, Max Hays, Jeffrey A. Grover, William D. Oliver
Abstract: We propose a method to realize microwave-activated CZ gates between two remote spin qubits in quantum dots using a charge-sensitive superconducting coupler. The qubits are longitudinally coupled to the coupler, so that the transition frequency of the coupler depends on the logical qubit states; a capacitive network model using first-quantized charge operators is developed to illustrate this. Driving the coupler transition then implements a conditional phase shift on the qubits. Two pulsing schemes are investigated: a rapid, off-resonant pulse with constant amplitude, and a pulse with envelope engineering that incorporates dynamical decoupling to mitigate charge noise. We develop non-Markovian time-domain simulations to accurately model gate performance in the presence of $1/f^\beta$ charge noise. Simulation results indicate that a CZ gate fidelity exceeding 90% is possible with realistic parameters and noise models.

Title: Thermal spectrometer for superconducting circuits
Authors: Christoforus Dimas Satrya, Yu-Cheng Chang, Aleksandr S. Strelnikov, Rishabh Upadhyay, Ilari K. Makinen, Joonas T. Peltonen, Bayan Karimi, Jukka P. Pekola
Abstract: Superconducting circuits provide a versatile and controllable platform for studies of fundamental quantum phenomena as well as for quantum technology applications. A conventional technique to read out the state of a quantum circuit or to characterize its properties is based on RF measurement schemes. Here we demonstrate a simple DC measurement of a thermal spectrometer to investigate properties of a superconducting circuit, in this proof-of-concept experiment a coplanar waveguide resonator. A fraction of the microwave photons in the resonator is absorbed by an on-chip bolometer, resulting in a measurable temperature rise. By monitoring the DC signal of the thermometer due to this process, we are able to determine the resonance frequency and the lineshape (quality factor) of the resonator. The demonstrated scheme, which is a simple DC measurement, offers a wide frequency band potentially reaching up to 200 GHz, far exceeding that of the typical RF spectrometer. Moreover, the thermal measurement yields a highly frequency independent reference level of the Lorentzian absorption signal. In the low power regime, the measurement is fully calibration-free. Our technique offers an alternative spectrometer for quantum circuits.

Title: Perturbative Framework for Engineering Arbitrary Floquet Hamiltonian
Authors: Yingdan Xu, Lingzhen Guo
Abstract: We develop a systematic perturbative framework to engineer an arbitrary target Hamiltonian in the Floquet phase space of a periodically driven oscillator based on Floquet-Magnus expansion. The high-order errors in the engineered Floquet Hamiltonian are mitigated by adding high-order driving potentials perturbatively. We introduce a transformation method that allows us to obtain an analytical expression of the leading-order correction drive for engineering a target Hamiltonian with discrete rotational and chiral symmetries in phase space. We also provide a numerically efficient procedure to calculate high-order correction drives and apply it to engineer the target Hamiltonian with degenerate eigenstates of multi-component cat states that are important for fault-tolerant hardware-efficiency bosonic quantum computation.

Title: A cohomology-based Gromov-Hausdorff metric approach for quantifying molecular similarity
Authors: JunJie Wee, Xue Gong, Wilderich Tuschmann, Kelin Xia
Abstract: We introduce, for the first time, a cohomology-based Gromov-Hausdorff ultrametric method to analyze 1-dimensional and higher-dimensional (co)homology groups, focusing on loops, voids, and higher-dimensional cavity structures in simplicial complexes, to address typical clustering questions arising in molecular data analysis. The Gromov-Hausdorff distance quantifies the dissimilarity between two metric spaces. In this framework, molecules are represented as simplicial complexes, and their cohomology vector spaces are computed to capture intrinsic topological invariants encoding loop and cavity structures. These vector spaces are equipped with a suitable distance measure, enabling the computation of the Gromov-Hausdorff ultrametric to evaluate structural dissimilarities. We demonstrate the methodology using organic-inorganic halide perovskite (OIHP) structures. The results highlight the effectiveness of this approach in clustering various molecular structures. By incorporating geometric information, our method provides deeper insights compared to traditional persistent homology techniques.

Title: Multi-scale physics of cryogenic liquid helium-4: Inverse coarse-graining properties of smoothed particle hydrodynamics
Authors: Satori Tsuzuki
Abstract: Our recent numerical studies on cryogenic liquid helium-4 strongly indicate the features of multiscale physics that can be identified using the Landau's two-fluid model. This study presents the possibility that two-fluid models based on classical and quantum hydrodynamics have a relationship between the scale transformation using filtering in large eddy simulations (LES) and the inverse scale transformation using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). We show that the spin angular momentum conservation term, which we previously introduced into the two-fluid model as a quantum mechanical correction, formally corresponds to the subgrid-scale (SGS) model, which can be derived from the scale transformation of the two-fluid model from quantum to classical hydrodynamics. Our theoretical analysis shows that solving the two-fluid model based on classical hydrodynamics using SPH can reproduce the microscopic fluctuations even at the macroscopic scale because the truncation errors owing to the smoothing kernel approximation can substitute the microscopic fluctuations. In particular, the fluctuations can be amplified according to the size of the kernel radius at the macroscopic scale. Our further theoretical analysis shows that the Condiff viscosity model can serve as an SGS model and incorporate the quantum vortex interactions into the two-fluid model. Our results and discussion provide new insights into the microscopic composition of the cryogenic liquid helium-4 within a multiscale framework. First, a normal fluid can be a mixture of inviscid and viscous fluid particles. Second, a flow identified as a normal fluid on the microscopic scale because of the presence of molecular viscosity is still classified as an inviscid fluid on the hydrodynamic scale because its viscosity is insufficient to produce eddy viscosity.

Title: Phase Transitions in Nonreciprocal Driven-Dissipative Condensates
Authors: Ron Belyansky, Cheyne Weis, Ryo Hanai, Peter B. Littlewood, Aashish A. Clerk
Abstract: We investigate the influence of boundaries and spatial nonreciprocity on nonequilibrium driven-dissipative phase transitions. We focus on a one-dimensional lattice of nonlinear bosons described by a Lindblad master equation, where the interplay between coherent and incoherent dynamics generates nonreciprocal interactions between sites. Using a mean-field approach, we analyze the phase diagram under both periodic and open boundary conditions. For periodic boundaries, the system always forms a condensate at nonzero momentum and frequency, resulting in a time-dependent traveling wave pattern. In contrast, open boundaries reveal a far richer phase diagram, featuring multiple static and dynamical phases, as well as exotic phase transitions, including the spontaneous breaking of particle-hole symmetry associated with a critical exceptional point and phases with distinct bulk and edge behavior. Our model avoids post-selection or unphysical non-Hermitian Hamiltonians and is experimentally realizable in platforms such as superconducting circuits.

Title: Resonant Energy Transfer and Collectively Driven Emitters in Waveguide QED
Authors: Cornelis Jacobus van Diepen, Vasiliki Angelopoulou, Oliver August Dall'Alba Sandberg, Alexey Tiranov, Ying Wang, Sven Scholz, Arne Ludwig, Anders Søndberg Sørensen, Peter Lodahl
Abstract: Waveguide quantum electrodynamics (QED) has opened a new frontier in quantum optics, which enables the radiative coupling of distantly located emitters via the spatially extended waveguide mode. This coupling leads to modified emission dynamics and previous work has reported the observation of increased intensity correlations (an antidip) when probing the resonance response of multiple emitters. However, the interference between independent emitters has been shown to lead to a similar response. Here, we directly observe resonant energy transfer between two distant quantum emitters by recording an antidip in the intensity correlations, $g^{(2)}(\tau)$, while driving only one of the emitters. Under the condition that only a single emitter is driven, the antidip in photon coincidences is a distinctive signature of emitter-emitter coupling, which enables the transfer of energy from the driven to the undriven emitter. Interestingly, the observed mechanism is a long-range and waveguide-engineered version of resonant Förster transfer, which is responsible for the transport of energy between chlorophylls in the photosynthesis. Building on the established coupling, we demonstrate collective driving of the coupled emitter pair. Specifically, we control the relative driving phase and amplitude of the emitters and apply this collective excitation scheme to selectively populate the long-lived subradiant state. This results in suppressed emission, i.e. the peculiar situation where driving two emitters as opposed to one effectively reduces the probability of photon emission. Our work presents novel emission regimes and excitation schemes for a multi-emitter waveguide QED system. These can be exploited to deterministically generate emitter-emitter entanglement and advanced photonic states providing robustness against losses for photonic quantum computation and quantum communication.
