Title: On the role of Electronic Doorway States in the Secondary Electron Emission from Solids
Authors: Anna Niggas, Maosheng Hao, Peter Richter, Florian Simperl, Felix Blödorn, M Cap, Johannes Kero, D Hofmann, Alessandra Bellissimo, Joachim Burgdörfer, Thomas Seyller, Richard A Wilhelm, Florian Libisch, Wolfgang S M Werner
Abstract: We investigate the phenomenon of secondary low-energy electron emission from graphene and graphite. By applying a coincidence detection of the primary scattered and an emitted secondary electron, we disentangle specific features otherwise hidden in the essentially featureless secondary electron spectrum. Hand-in-hand with density functional theory calculations, we show that this slow electron emission is governed not only by the density of states in the occupied and unoccupied band structure but is also modulated by the coupling of levels above the vacuum energy to free-vacuum states. This implies electronic doorway states which facilitate efficient propagation of electrons from the solid to vacuum, some of which only open for samples with more than 5 layers.

Title: Effects of disorder on the quantum transport properties in topologically nontrivial metal PbTaSe$_{2}$
Authors: Longfei Sun, Yue Sun, Qiang Hou, R. Sankar, R. Kalaivanan, Xiaofeng Xu, Zhixiang Shi, Tsuyoshi Tamegai
Abstract: Weak antilocalization (WAL), an increase in the electrical conductivity at low temperatures associated with the suppression of electron localization due to quantum interference effects, is often observed in topological materials. In this study, we report the observation of WAL in topologically nontrivial metal PbTaSe$_{2}$ at low temperatures. In the pristine sample, we identified the presence of WAL, which is attributed to the topologically protected backscattering. In order to investigate the influence of disorder on the WAL, we successively introduced controlled amounts of disorder by H$^{+}$-irradiation. As disorder increases, the dip-like magnetoresistance caused by WAL changes to a linear magnetoresistance(MR), and eventually to a quadratic MR as the electronic system becomes highly localized. This research unveils the significance of disorder in shaping the quantum transport characteristics of topological materials.

Title: Boundary operator expansion and extraordinary phase transition in the tricritical O(N) model
Authors: Xinyu Sun, Shao-Kai Jian
Abstract: We study the boundary extraordinary transition of a 3D tricritical $O(N)$ model. We first compute the mean-field Green's function with a general coupling of $|\vec \phi|^{2n}$ (with $n=3$ corresponding to the tricritical point) at the extraordinary phase transition. Then, by employing the technique of layer susceptibility, we solve the boundary operator expansion using the $\epsilon=3 - d$ expansion. Based on these results, we demonstrate that the tricritical point exhibits an extraordinary transition characterized by an ordered boundary for any $N$. This provides the first nontrivial example of continuous symmetry breaking in 2D dimensions in the context of boundary criticality.

Title: Diabatic error and propagation of Majorana zero modes in interacting quantum dots systems
Authors: Bradraj Pandey, Gaurav Kumar Gupta, Gonzalo Alvarez, Satoshi Okamoto, Elbio Dagotto
Abstract: Motivated by recent experimental progress in realizing Majorana zero modes (MZMs) using quantum dot systems, we investigate the diabatic errors associated with the movement of those MZMs. The movement is achieved by tuning time-dependent gate potentials applied to individual quantum dots, effectively creating a moving potential wall. To probe the optimized movement of MZMs, we calculate the experimentally accessible local density-of-states and time-dependent fidelity using many-body time-dependent numerical methods. Our analysis reveals that an optimal potential wall height is crucial to preserve the well-localized nature of the MZM during its movement. Moreover, for the first time, we analyze diabatic errors in realistic quantum-dot systems, incorporating the effects of repulsive Coulomb interactions and disorder in both hopping and pairing terms. Additionally, we provide a comparative study of diabatic errors arising from the simultaneous versus sequential tuning of multiple gates during the MZMs movement. Finally, we estimate the time scale required for MZM transfer in a six-quantum-dot system, demonstrating that MZM movement is feasible and can be completed well within the qubit's operational lifetime in practical quantum-dot setups.

Title: Electrostatics and viscosity are strongly linked in concentrated antibody solutions
Authors: Fabrizio Camerin, Marco Polimeni, Anna Stradner, Emanuela Zaccarelli, Peter Schurtenberger
Abstract: Monoclonal antibodies are among the most promising therapeutic agents in modern medicine, yet their formulation into high-concentration solutions for subcutaneous self-administration poses a major challenge. A key obstacle is the marked increase in viscosity often observed under these conditions. To gain deeper insights into this phenomenon, coarse-grained models derived from soft matter physics have been widely employed. However, these models have yet to be fully leveraged for analyzing the rheological collective properties of such systems. In this study, using molecular dynamics simulations, we directly compute the antibody solution viscosity by starting from commonly used models in which electrostatic interactions are treated through effective screened Coulomb potentials. We demonstrate that this approach fails to reproduce experimental evidence and we show, by analyzing stress correlations in the system, that it is necessary to treat the heterogeneously charged domains explicitly, also including counterions and salt ions, and to properly account for the long-ranged nature of Coulomb interactions. By thoroughly analyzing the microscopic structure of the system, we further reveal the presence of transient strongly correlated antibodies which would not be present if charges were treated implicitly, thus pointing to a prominent role of electrostatics in determining the increase in viscosity at high concentrations. By taking advantage of our realistic treatment, new approaches can be devised to ensure that antibody solutions exhibit the desired characteristics for their intended broad use and effective deployment.

Title: Skyrmionium Dynamics and Stability on One Dimensional Anisotropy Patterns
Authors: J. C. Bellizotti Souza, N. P. Vizarim, C. J. O. Reichhardt, C. Reichhardt, P. A. Venegas
Abstract: We examine a skyrmionium driven over a periodic anisotropy pattern, which consists of disorder free regions and disordered regions. For small defect densities, the skyrmionium flows for an extended range of currents, and there is a critical current above which it transforms into a skyrmion. For increased amounts of quenched disorder, the current needed for the skyrmionium to transform into a skyrmion decreases, and there is a critical disorder density above which a moving skyrmionium is not stable. In the moving state, the skyrmionium to skyrmion transformation leads to a drop in the velocity and the onset of a finite skyrmion Hall angle. We also find a reentrance effect in which the pinned skyrmionium transforms into a skyrmion just above depinning, restabilizes into skyrmionium at larger drives, and becomes unstable again at large currents. We also show that adding a transverse shaking drive can increase the lifetime of a moving skyrmionium by reducing the effect of the pinning in the direction of the drive.

Title: Dynamics of Supersolid state: normal fluid, superfluid, and supersolid velocities
Authors: Wayne M. Saslow
Abstract: Landau's excitation-based argument for superfluids -- that at temperature $T=0$ the normal fluid density $\rho_{n}$ is zero -- should also apply to supersolids. Further, for a total mass density $\rho$, Leggett argues that the superfluid fraction $\rho_{s}/\rho<1$. These arguments imply that there is a missing mass. We attribute this to a supersolid density $\rho_{L}$, with $\rho_{L}\equiv \rho-\rho_{s}-\rho_{n}$, and a momentum-bearing supersolid velocity $v_{Li}$. Using Onsager's irreversible thermodynamics we derive the macroscopic dynamical equations for this system. We find that $v_{Li}$ is subject to the force of elasticity, to the negative gradient of the chemical potential per mass $\mu$ (as for the superfluid velocity $v_{si}$), and to drag against the normal fluid (leading to the interpretation of $L$ as lattice). Thus both the superfluid and supersolid components are associated with the ground state. The normal modes for such a system have a crossover in frequency, above which the normal fluid velocity $v_{ni}$ is an independent variable and below which it is locked to $v_{Li}$. For an isotropic lattice we study both the transverse response and longitudinal response. The ring geometry for atomic gas supersolid states may provide a geometry for testing these predictions.

Title: Observation of anisotropic dispersive dark exciton dynamics in CrSBr
Authors: J. Sears, W. He, Y. Shen, M. Lajer, J. W. Villanova, T. Berlijn, F. Yakhou-Harris, N. B. Brookes, D. G. Chica, X. Roy, E. Baldini, V. Bisogni, S. Johnston, M. Mitrano, M. P. M. Dean
Abstract: Many-body excitons in CrSBr are attracting intense interest in view of their highly anisotropic magneto-optical coupling and their potential for novel optical interfaces within spintronic and magnonic devices. Characterizing the orbital character and propagation of these electronic excitations is crucial for understanding and controlling their behavior; however, this information is challenging to access. Ultra-high resolution resonant inelastic x-ray scattering is a momentum-resolved technique that can address these crucial questions. We present measurements collected at the Cr $L_3$-edge which show a rich spectrum of excitations with a variety of spin-orbital characters. While most of these excitations appear to be localized, the dispersion of the lowest energy dark exciton indicates that it is able to propagate along both the $a$ and $b$ directions within the planes of the crystal. This two-dimensional character is surprising as it contrasts with electrical conductivity and the behavior of the bright exciton, both of which are strongly one-dimensional. The discovery of this propagating dark exciton highlights an unusual coexistence of one- and two-dimensional electronic behaviors in CrSBr.

Title: Resolving the Electron Plume within a Scanning Electron Microscope
Authors: Francis M. Alcorn, Christopher Perez, Eric J. Smoll, Lauren Hoang, Frederick Nitta, Andrew J. Mannix, A. Alec Talin, Craig Y. Nakakura, David W. Chandler, Suhas Kumar
Abstract: Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), a century-old technique, is today a ubiquitous method of imaging the surface of nanostructures. However, most SEM detectors simply count the number of secondary electrons from a material of interest, and thereby overlook the rich material information contained within them. Here, by simple modifications to a standard SEM tool, we resolve the momentum and energy information of secondary electrons by directly imaging the electron plume generated by the electron beam of the SEM. Leveraging these spectroscopic imaging capabilities, our technique is able to image lateral electric fields across a prototypical silicon p-n junctions and to distinguish differently doped regions, even when buried beyond depths typically accessible by SEM. Intriguingly, the sub-surface sensitivity of this technique reveals unexpectedly strong surface band bending within nominally passivated semiconductor structures, providing useful insights for complex layered component designs, in which interfacial dynamics dictate device operation. These capabilities for non-invasive, multi-modal probing of complicated electronic components are crucial in today's electronic manufacturing but is largely inaccessible even with sophisticated techniques. These results show that seemingly simple SEM can be extended to probe complex and useful material properties.

Title: Anomalous Ultrafast Thermalization of Photoexcited Carriers in Two-Dimensional Materials Induced by Orbital Coupling
Authors: Zhuoqun Wen, Haiyu Zhu, Wenhao Liu, Zhi Wang, Wen Xiong, Xingzhan Wei
Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of photoexcited carriers is essential for advancing photoelectronic device design. Photon absorption generates electron-hole pairs, and subsequent scatterings can induce ultrafast thermalization within a picosecond, forming a quasi-equilibrium distribution with overheated electrons. The high-energy tail of this distribution enables carriers to overcome energy barriers, thereby enhancing quantum efficiency--a phenomenon known as photo-thermionic emission (PTE). Despite its importance, the onset and mechanisms of PTE remain under debate. Using real-time time-dependent density functional theory (rt-TDDFT), we investigate ultrafast carrier thermalization in two-dimensional materials graphene and PtTe2, and the results reveal distinct differences. In graphene, both electrons and holes thermalize into Fermi-Dirac distributions with good agreement to experiment, while PtTe2 exhibits anomalous high-energy tails for both electrons and holes, deviating significantly from Fermi-Dirac behavior. We attribute this anomaly to differences in orbital coupling between the two materials, from which we derive design principles for identifying optimal PTE candidates and, ultimately, improving photodetector performance.

Title: Heat Conduction and Thermal Switching Performance of Surface Plasmon Polaritons in Ag2Se Quantum Dot Composite Polymer Film
Authors: Congliang Huang, Changkang Du, Qiangqiang Huang, Xiaodong Wang
Abstract: To stabilize the working temperature of an equipment, a solid-state thermal resistor is usually a requisite, which could adjust its heat conductance continuously according to the temperature. In this work, the thermal conductivity and the thermal switching performances of surface plasmon polaritons in the polymer films filled with Ag2Se quantum dots (QDs) were theoretically analyzed, and a theoretical model was also derived to reveal the dependence of the thermal conductivity on the temperature and the structure of a composite film, which is verified to be effective by numerical calculations. It shows that the thermal conductivity will decrease following ~t-3exp({\zeta}/Td) rule under the thin film limit, here t, d and T are film thickness, diameter of QDs and temperature, respectively, and {\zeta} is a constant. A high thermal conductivity could be only realized at a device with a size lager than millimeter scale, due to the need of avoiding boundary scatterings of surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs). At the millimeter scale, the thermal conductivity could be reduced by 100 times by increasing temperature from 300 to 400 K, which suggests a very high thermal switching ratio almost in all kinds of solid-state thermal resistor. This study brings new insights in designing thermal resistor and understanding heat conduction in films by adjusting its structures.

Title: Strong Low Degree Hardness for Stable Local Optima in Spin Glasses
Authors: Brice Huang, Mark Sellke
Abstract: It is a folklore belief in the theory of spin glasses and disordered systems that out-of-equilibrium dynamics fail to find stable local optima exhibiting e.g. local strict convexity on physical time-scales. In the context of the Sherrington--Kirkpatrick spin glass, Behrens-Arpino-Kivva-Zdeborová and Minzer-Sah-Sawhney have recently conjectured that this obstruction may be inherent to all efficient algorithms, despite the existence of exponentially many such optima throughout the landscape. We prove this search problem exhibits strong low degree hardness for polynomial algorithms of degree $D\leq o(N)$: any such algorithm has probability $o(1)$ to output a stable local optimum. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result to prove that even constant-degree polynomials have probability $o(1)$ to solve a random search problem without planted structure. To prove this, we develop a general-purpose enhancement of the ensemble overlap gap property, and as a byproduct improve previous results on spin glass optimization, maximum independent set, random $k$-SAT, and the Ising perceptron to strong low degree hardness. Finally for spherical spin glasses with no external field, we prove that Langevin dynamics does not find stable local optima within dimension-free time.

Title: Flux-Driven Circular Current in a Non-Hermitian Dimerized Aharonov-Bohm Ring: Impact of Physical Gain and Loss
Authors: Souvik Roy, Santanu K. Maiti
Abstract: In the present work, we explore magnetic response of a dimerized ring subjected to Aharonov-Bohm (AB) flux and environmental interactions. Specifically, we introduce an imaginary site potential on the odd lattice sites to represent physical gain and loss, while the even lattice sites remain unperturbed. We investigate the induced current resulting from the AB flux in both real and imaginary eigenspaces, aiming to enhance this current significantly by adjusting the gain/loss parameter ($d$). Our analysis focuses on how exceptional points in the real and imaginary eigenenergy spaces contribute to notable increases in current at specific $d$ values, and the emergence of purely real current when the imaginary current vanishes. We focus on how the converging and diverging nature of the energy spectrum leads to gradual increases and decreases in the current. Additionally, we study the interplay between the correlations of dimerized hopping integrals and the gain-loss parameter, which affects the current and highlights key features associated with these physical parameters. Furthermore, we consider how system size impacts our findings. These investigations may reveal unconventional characteristics in various loop configurations, potentially paving the way for new research directions.

Title: Frequency-dependent specific heat in quantum supercooled liquids: A mode-coupling study
Authors: Ankita Das, Eran Rabani, Kunimasa Miyazaki, Upendra Harbola
Abstract: Frequency-dependence of specific heat in supercooled hard sphere liquid is computed using quantum mode-coupling theory (QMCT). Mode-coupling equations are solved using recently proposed perturbative method that allows to study relaxation in the moderate quantum regime where quantum effects assist liquid to glass transition. Zwanzig's formulation is used to compute the frequency-dependent specific heat in supercooled state using dynamical information from QMCT. Specific heat shows strong variation as the quantumness of the liquid is changed, which becomes more significant as density is increased. It is found that, near the transition point, different dynamical modes contribute to the specific heat in the classical and the quantum liquids.

Title: Tagged particle dynamics in supercooled quantum liquid
Authors: Ankita Das, Gopika Krishnan, Eran Rabani, Upendra Harbola
Abstract: We analyze dynamics of quantum supercooled liquids in terms of tagged particle dynamics. Unlike the classical case, uncertainty in the position of a particle in quantum liquid leads to qualitative changes. We demonstrate these effects in the dynamics of the first two moments of displacements, namely, the mean-squared displacement, $\langle \Delta r^2(t)\rangle$, and $\langle \Delta r^4(t)\rangle$. Results are presented for a hard sphere liquid using mode-coupling theory (MCT) formulation and simulation on a binary Lennard-Jones liquid. As the quantumness (controlled by the de-Broglie thermal wavelength) is increased, a non-zero value of the moments at zero time leads to significant deviations from the classical behavior in the initial dynamics. Initial displacement shows ballistic behavior $\langle \Delta r^2(t)\rangle\sim t^2$, but, as a result of large uncertainty in the position, the dynamical effects become weaker with increasing quantumness over this time scale.

Title: Probing electric field tunable multiband superconductivity in alternating twisted quadralayer graphene
Authors: Le Liu, Yu Hong, Chengping Zhang, Jundong Zhu, Jingwei Dong, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Luojun Du, Dongxia Shi, Kam Tuen Law, Wei Yang, Guangyu Zhang
Abstract: Alternating twisted multilayer graphene presents a compelling multiband system for exploring superconductivity. Here we investigate robust superconductivity in alternating twisted quadralayer graphene, elucidating carrier contributions from both flat and dispersive bands. The superconductivity is robust, with a strong electrical field tunability, a maximum BKT transition temperature of 1.6 K, and high critical magnetic fields beyond the Pauli limit. We disentangle the carrier density of Dirac bands and flat bands from the Landau fan diagram. Moreover, we could estimate the flatband Fermi velocity from the obtained high critical current near half filling when superconductivity is killed at finite magnetic fields, and further quantify the superfluid stiffness from the low critical current in the superconducting regime. Our results exhibit the electric field tunable coupling strength within the superconducting phase, revealing unconventional properties with vanishing Fermi velocity and large superfluid stiffness. These phenomena, attributed to substantial quantum metric contributions, offer new insights into the mechanisms underlying unconventional superconductivity in moire systems.

Title: Fermion as a non-local particle-hole excitation
Authors: Alok Kushwaha, Rishi Paresh Joshi, Girish Sampath Setlur
Abstract: We show that the fermion, in the context of a system that comprises many such entities - which, by virtue of the Pauli exclusion principle, possesses a Fermi surface at zero temperature - may itself be thought of as a collection of non-local particle-hole excitations across this Fermi surface. This result is purely kinematical and completely general - not being restricted to any specific dimension, applicable to both continuum and lattice systems. There is also no implication that it is applicable only to low-energy phenomena close to the Fermi surface. We are able to derive the full single-particle dynamical Green function of this fermion at finite temperature by viewing it as a collection of these non-local particle-hole excitations. The Green function of the fermion then manifests itself as a solution to a first-order differential equation in a parameter that controls the number of particle-hole pairs across the Fermi surface, and this equation itself reveals variable coefficients that may be identified with a Bose-Einstein distribution - implying that there is a sense in which the non-local particle-hole excitations have bosonic qualities while not being exact bosons at the level of operators. We also recall the definition of the non-local particle-hole operator that may be used to diagonalize the kinetic energy of free fermions of the sort mentioned above. Number-conserving products of creation and annihilation operators of fermions are expressible as a (rather complicated) combination of these non-local particle-hole operators.

Title: Density Functional Leveraged Tight-binding Insights into Inorganic Halide Perovskites
Authors: Misbah Shaheen, Sheharyar Pervez
Abstract: Compared to first principles studies like DFT (physically accurate, computationally expensive), the TB approach allows the disentanglement of the region of interest, to wit the fermi level. This allows the creation of simplified, highly interpretable models that give chemically grounded insights. In this paper we employ a Wannierized TB approach to tune the bandgap and electronic structure via anion exchange and investigate its impact on the orbital interactives of inorganic lead halide perovskites. Further adjustment of the hopping norm and maximum distance leads to a reduced TB model which regenerates the broad features of the band structure with a fraction of the parameters, thereby making the model simpler and highly interpretable. We observe that due to the asymmetry of the unit cell and the delocalized nature of its orbitals, CsPbBrI2 follows a many-small hopping scheme different in character from the few-big strategy taken by the other perovskites. Finally we leverage the TB model to study the electronic and thermal transport properties of these materials. These insight enable the identification of optimal doping strategies that could enhance thermoelectric performance by improving carrier mobility or optimizing the Seebeck coefficient.

Title: High-pressure growth effect on the properties of high-Tc iron-based superconductors: A short review
Authors: Priya Singh, Manasa Manasa, Mohammad Azam, Shiv J. Singh
Abstract: The high-pressure growth technique is a vital approach that facilitates the stabilization of new phases and allows for meticulous control of structural parameters, which significantly impact electronic and magnetic properties. We present a short review of our ongoing investigations into various families of iron-based superconductors (IBS), employing the high-gas pressure and high-temperature synthesis (HP-HTS) method. This technique is capable of producing the gas pressures up to 1.8 GPa and a heating temperature of up to 1700 °C through a three-zone furnace within a cylindrical chamber. Different kinds of IBS samples are prepared using HPHTS and characterized through various measurements to reach the final conclusions. The results demonstrate that the high-pressure growth technique significantly enhances the properties of IBS, including the transition temperature, critical current density, and pinning force. In addition, the quality of the samples and their density are improved through the intergrain connections. Furthermore, the comprehensive evaluations and investigations prove that a growth pressure of 0.5 GPa is sufficient for producing high-quality IBS bulks under the optimized synthesis conditions.

Title: Chiral supersolid and dissipative time crystal in Rydberg-dressed Bose-Einstein condensates with Raman-induced spin-orbit coupling
Authors: Xianghua Su, Xiping Fu, Yang He, Ying Shang, Kaiyuan Ji, Linghua Wen
Abstract: Spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is one of the key factors that affect the chiral symmetry of matter by causing the spatial symmetry breaking of the system. We find that Raman-induced SOC can induce a chiral supersolid phase with a helical antiskyrmion lattice in balanced Rydberg-dressed two-component Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) in a harmonic trap by modulating the Raman coupling strength, strong contrast with the mirror symmetric supersolid phase containing skyrmion-antiskyrmion lattice pair for the case of Rashba SOC. Two ground-state phase diagrams are presented as a function of the Rydberg interaction strength and the SOC strength, as well as that of the Rydberg interaction strength and the Raman coupling strength, respectively. It is shown that the interplay among Raman-induced SOC, soft-core long-range Rydberg interactions, and contact interactions favors rich ground-state structures including half-quantum vortex phase, stripe supersolid phase, toroidal stripe phase with a central Anderson-Toulouse coreless vortex, checkerboard supersolid phase, mirror symmetric supersolid phase, chiral supersolid phase and standing-wave supersolid phase. In addition, the effects of rotation and in-plane quadrupole magnetic field on the ground state of the system are analyzed. In these two cases, the chiral supersolid phase is broken and the ground state tends to form a miscible phase. Furthermore, the stability and superfluid properties of the two-component BECs with Raman-induced SOC and Rydberg interactions in free space are revealed by solving the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation. Finally, we demonstrate that when the initial state is a chiral supersolid phase the rotating harmonic trapped system sustains dissipative continuous time crystal by studying the rotational dynamic behaviors of the system.

Title: Scaling Analysis and Renormalization Group on the Mobility Edge in the Quantum Random Energy Model
Authors: Federico Balducci, Giacomo Bracci Testasecca, Jacopo Niedda, Antonello Scardicchio, Carlo Vanoni
Abstract: Building on recent progress in the study of Anderson and many-body localization via the renormalization group (RG), we examine the scaling theory of localization in the quantum Random Energy Model (QREM). The QREM is known to undergo a localization-delocalization transition at finite energy density, while remaining fully ergodic at the center of the spectrum. At zero energy density, we show that RG trajectories consistently flow toward the ergodic phase, and are characterized by an unconventional scaling of the fractal dimension near the ergodic fixed point. When the disorder amplitude is rescaled, as suggested by the forward scattering approximation approach, a localization transition emerges also at the center of the spectrum, with properties analogous to the Anderson transition on expander graphs. At finite energy density, a localization transition takes place without disorder rescaling, and yet it exhibits a scaling behavior analogous to the one observed on expander graphs. The universality class of the model remains unchanged under the rescaling of the disorder, reflecting the independence of the RG from microscopic details. Our findings demonstrate the robustness of the scaling behavior of random graphs and offer new insights into the many-body localization transition.

Title: The Layer Hall Effect without External Electric Field
Authors: Yulei Han, Yunpeng Guo, Zeyu Li, Zhenhua Qiao
Abstract: The layer Hall effect is an intriguing phenomenon observed in magnetic topological layered materials, where the Hall response arises from the opposite deflection of electrons on top and bottom layers. To realize layer Hall effect, space-time $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry is typically broken by applying an external electric field. In this work, we propose a new mechanism to realize the layer Hall effect by introducing inequivalent exchange fields on both surfaces of a topological insulator thin film, in the absence of an electric field. This approach yields a distinct Hall response compared to the conventional electric-field-induced layer Hall effect, particularly with respect to the Fermi level. Taking the topological insulator Sb$_2$Te$_3$ as a concrete example, we demonstrate the feasibility of inducing the layer Hall effect only by coupling the top and bottom surfaces of Sb$_2$Te$_3$ with different magnetic insulators. Notably, we show that both built-in electric-field-induced and inequivalent exchange-fields-induced layer Hall effects can be achieved by tuning the stacking order between Sb$_2$Te$_3$ and the magnetic layers. Given the well-established experimental techniques for fabricating topological insulator thin films, our work offers a viable pathway for realizing layer Hall effect without external electric field.

Title: Self-assembly of chromatic patchy particles with tetrahedrally arranged patches
Authors: Dariusz Tarasewicz, Edyta Raczyłło, Wojciech Rżysko, Łukasz Baran
Abstract: The achievement of selectivity in the formation of cubic diamond is challenging due to the emergence of competing phases such as its hexagonal polymorph or clathrates possessing similar free energy. Although both polymorphs exhibit a complete photonic bandgap, the cubic diamond exhibits it at lower frequencies than the hexagonal counterpart, positioning him as a promising candidate for photonic this http URL, we demonstrate that the 1:1 mixture of identical patchy particles cannot selectively form the cubic diamond polymorph due to the frustrations present in the system that are manifested in the primary adsorption layer and propagate as the film grows. We provide a plausible} explanation why the binary system under confinement, resembling interactions between the complementary DNA bases cannot yield the selectivity in the formation of cubic diamond crystals which is based on the similarities to the antiferromagnetic systems. We always observe the mixture of both hexagonal and cubic diamonds, however, the formation of such stacking hybrids is observed for a wider range of patch sizes compared to the one-component system.

Title: Correlation effects in two-dimensional MX_2 and MA_2Z_4 (M= Nb, Ta; X= S, Se, Te; A=Si, Ge; Z=N, P) cold metals: Implications for device applications
Authors: W. Beida, E. Sasioglu, M. Tas, C. Friedrich, S. Blugel, I. Mertig, I. Galanakis
Abstract: Cold metals, characterized by their distinctive band structures, hold promise for innovative electronic devices such as tunnel diodes with negative differential resistance (NDR) effect and field-effect transistors (FETs) with sub-60 mV/dec subthreshold swing (SS). In this study, we employ the GW approximation and HSE06 hybrid functional to investigate the correlation effects on the electronic band structure of two-dimensional (2D) cold metallic materials, specifically focusing on MX_2 and MA_2Z_4 (M=Nb, Ta; X=S, Se, Te; A=Si, Ge; Z= N, P) compounds in 1H structure. These materials exhibit a unique band structure with an isolated metallic band around the Fermi energy, denoted as W_m, as well as two energy gaps: the internal gap E^I_g below the Fermi level and the external gap E^E_g above the Fermi level. These three electronic structure parameters play a decisive role in determining the current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of tunnel diodes, the nature of the NDR effect, and the transfer characteristics and SS value of FETs. Our calculations reveal that both GW and HSE06 methods yield consistent electronic structure properties for all studied compounds. We observed a consistent increase in both internal and external band gaps, as well as metallic bandwidths, across all pn-type cold metal systems. Notably, the internal band gap E^I_g exhibits the most substantial enhancement, highlighting the sensitivity of these materials to correlation effects. In contrast, the changes in the metallic bandwidth W_m and external band gap E^E_g are relatively modest. These findings offer valuable insights for designing and optimizing cold metal-based devices. Materials like NbSi_2N_4, NbGe_2N_4, and TaSi_2N_4 show particular promise for high-performance NDR tunnel diodes and sub-60 mV/dec SS FETs.

Title: Fermi Level and Light Driven Defect Generation in Silicon Solar Cells
Authors: Andrew Diggs, Zitong Zhao, Adam Goga, Zachary Crawford, Gergely T. Zimanyi
Abstract: Hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) has had a long standing role as a passivating dielectric for c-Si, often utilized in the early development of ICs and more recently for Si solar cells. Although it has been studied for more than 60 years, several questions about the material properties remain open, including light-induced degradation and the Fermi level dependence on the mobility of hydrogen. Here we study the origin of these phenomenon using electronic structure based calculations. First, we use density functional theory (DFT) and the nudged elastic band (NEB) method to examine defect generation via Si-H bond breaking in p-type, intrinsic, and n-type a-Si:H. We find that the energy barrier controlling this defect generation, shows the same asymmetric reduction of $\sim 0.3$ eV for p-type and $\sim 0.1$ eV for n-type, observed in experimental studies. We then develop a model based on the local Coulomb interactions at the transition state, which provides compelling evidence that the asymmetry results from the emergence of a high energy donor state created by the interstitial H. Finally, we repeat our Si-H bond breaking analysis, combining NEB with constrained density functional perturbation theory (c-DFPT) to simulate defect generation dynamics in illuminated a-Si:H. Here we find that e-p pair results in a combined effect that reduces the barrier by $\sim 0.4$, in close agreement with experimental observations.

Title: The role of antisymmetric orbitals and electron-electron interactions on the two-particle spin and valley blockade in graphene double quantum dots
Authors: Samuel Möller, Luca Banszerus, Katrin Hecker, Hubert Dulisch, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Christian Volk, Christoph Stampfer
Abstract: We report on an experimental study of spin and valley blockade in two-electron bilayer graphene (BLG) double quantum dots (DQDs) and explore the limits set by asymmetric orbitals and electronelectron interactions. The results obtained from magnetotransport measurements on two-electron BLG DQDs, where the resonant tunneling transport involves both orbital symmetric and antisymmetric two-particle states, show a rich level spectrum. We observe a magnetic field tunable spin and valley blockade, which is limited by the orbital splitting, the strength of the electron-electron interaction and the difference in the valley g-factors between the symmetric and antisymmetric twoparticle orbital states. Our conclusions are supported by simulations based on rate equations, which allow the identification of prominent interdot transitions associated with the transition from single to two-particle states observed in the experiment.

Abstract: Kesterite is a leading candidate among inorganic thin-film photovoltaic technologies, offering sustainable and environmentally friendly solutions without reliance on critical raw materials. This study investigates the performance of CZTSSe-based kesterite solar cells using SCAPS-1D simulations. Four device configurations are analyzed by integrating the CZTSSe absorber layer with buffer materials, including CdS, SnS2, IGZO, and ZnSe, selected based on their energy band alignment. Moreover, key parameters influencing device efficiency, such as absorber defect density, buffer layer thickness, and the donor and defect densities of the buffer materials, are systematically examined. The thickness of the absorber layer and acceptor density are optimized, considering practical manufacturing constraints. Following optimization, the i-ZnO/SnS2/CZTSSe/Au configuration achieves a notable efficiency of 28.38%, with a VOC of 0.83 V, a JSC of 39.93 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 85.4%. Furthermore, the stability of the optimized structures is evaluated under varying conditions, including resistances, temperature, generation and recombination dynamics, as well as JV and QE characteristics. These findings provide valuable insights for advancing the efficiency and stability of CZTSSe solar cells, contributing to the development of sustainable photovoltaic technologies.

Title: Theoretical Basis for Classifying Hyperuniform States of Two-Component Systems
Authors: Hiroshi Frusawa
Abstract: Hyperuniform states of matter exhibit unusual suppression of density fluctuations at large scales, contrasting sharply with typical disordered configurations. Various types of hyperuniformity emerge in multicomponent disordered systems, significantly enhancing their functional properties for advanced applications. This paper focuses on developing a theoretical framework for two-component hyperuniform systems. We provide a robust theoretical basis to identify novel conditions on structure factors for a variety of hyperuniform binary mixtures, classifying them into five distinct types with seven unique states. Our findings also offer valuable guidelines for designing multihyperuniform materials where each component preserves hyperuniformity, added to the overall hyperuniformity.

Title: Fatigue-free ferroelectricity in Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 ultrathin films via interfacial design
Authors: Chao Zhou, Yanpeng Feng, Liyang Ma, Haoliang Huang, Yangyang Si, Hailin Wang, Sizhe Huang, Jingxuan Li, Chang-Yang Kuo, Sujit Das, Yunlong Tang, Shi Liu, Zuhuang Chen
Abstract: Due to traits of CMOS compatibility and scalability, HfO2-based ferroelectrics are promising candidates for next-generation memory devices. However, their commercialization has been greatly hindered by reliability issues, with fatigue being a major impediment. We report the fatigue-free behavior in interface-designed Hf0.5Zr0.5O2-based heterostructures. A coherent CeO2-x/Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 heterointerface is constructed, wherein CeO2-x acts as an oxygen sponge, capable of reversibly accepting and releasing oxygen vacancies. This design effectively alleviates defect aggregation at the electrode-ferroelectric interface, enabling improved switching characteristics. Further, a symmetric capacitor architecture is designed to minimize the imprint, thereby suppressing the cycling-induced oriented defect drift. The two-pronged technique mitigates oxygen-voltammetry-generated chemical/energy fluctuations, suppressing the formation of paraelectric phase and polarization degradation. The design ensures a fatigue-free feature exceeding 10^11 switching cycles and an endurance lifetime surpassing 10^12 cycles for Hf0.5Zr0.5O2-based capacitors, along with excellent temperature stability and retention. These findings pave the way for developing ultra-stable hafnia-based ferroelectric devices.

Title: Hierarchy-Boosted Funnel Learning for Identifying Semiconductors with Ultralow Lattice Thermal Conductivity
Authors: Mengfan Wu, Shenshen Yan, Jie Ren
Abstract: Data-driven machine learning (ML) has demonstrated tremendous potential in material property predictions. However, the scarcity of materials data with costly property labels in the vast chemical space presents a significant challenge for ML in efficiently predicting properties and uncovering structure-property relationships. Here, we propose a novel hierarchy-boosted funnel learning (HiBoFL) framework, which is successfully applied to identify semiconductors with ultralow lattice thermal conductivity ($\kappa_\mathrm{L}$). By training on only a few hundred materials targeted by unsupervised learning from a pool of hundreds of thousands, we achieve efficient and interpretable supervised predictions of ultralow $\kappa_\mathrm{L}$, thereby circumventing large-scale brute-force calculations without clear objectives. As a result, we provide a list of candidates with ultralow $\kappa_\mathrm{L}$ for potential thermoelectric applications and discover a new factor that significantly influences structural anharmonicity. This study offers a novel practical pathway for accelerating the discovery of functional materials.

Title: Anomalous Molecular Weight Dependence Reveals the Origin of Mechanical Enhancement in Polymer Nanocomposite
Authors: Tae Yeon Kong, So Youn Kim
Abstract: Polymers at the interface exhibit frustrated chain conformation distinct from the bulk, impacting particle dispersion and properties of polymer nanocomposites (PNCs). Utilizing bimodal molecular weight (MW) PNCs, we observed unusual chain elongation of interfacial polymers, which promotes networked structures at low particle loadings. Paradoxically, reducing the average MW in bimodal PNCs significantly enhances the shear modulus by up to 103 times, challenging the conventional preference for higher MW in property enhancement. The mechanical reinforcement, aided by stretched chains, manifests when the short chain is substantially shorter than the long chain (Rg ratio >~2), indicating a universal stretching factor of 2.3.

Title: Switching Graphitic Polytypes in Elastically Coupled Islands
Authors: Nirmal Roy, Simon Salleh Atri, Yoav Sharaby, Noam Raab, Youngki Yeo, Watanabe Kenji, Takashi Taniguchi, Moshe Ben Shalom
Abstract: Van der Waals polytypes are commensurate configurations of two-dimensional layers with discrete crystalline symmetries and distinct stacking-dependent properties. In graphitic polytypes, the different stacking arrangements of graphene sheets exhibit rich electronic phases, such as intrinsic electric polarizations, orbital magnetizations, superconductivity, and anomalous fractional Hall states. Switching between these metastable periodic configurations by controlling interlayer shifts unlocks intriguing multiferroic responses. Here, we report super-lubricant arrays of polytypes (SLAP) devices, with nanometer-scale islands of Bernal polytypes that switch into Rhombohedral crystals and vice versa under a shear force as low as 6 nano-Newtons. We assemble these four-layer SLAP structures by aligning a pair of graphene bilayers above and under circular cavities in a misaligned spacer layer. Using local current measurements, we detect the shifts between the active bilayers and reveal long-range elastic relaxations outside the cavities that enable efficient nucleation and spontaneous sliding of stacking dislocation inside the islands. We demonstrate configurable, deterministic, and robust polytype switching by confining these boundary strips in narrow cavity channels that connect the islands. Such controlled switching between elastically-coupled single-crystalline islands is appealing for novel multiferroic SlideTronic applications.

Title: Symmetry-breaking induced transition among net-zero-magnetization magnets
Authors: San-Dong Guo, Xiao-Shu Guo, Guangzhao Wang
Abstract: Net-zero-magnetization magnets have garnered intensive research attention due to their ultradense and ultrafast potential. In terms of the symmetric classification of connecting magnetic atoms with opposite spin polarization, the net-zero-magnetization magnets mainly include $PT$-antiferromagnet (the joint symmetry ($PT$) of space inversion symmetry ($P$) and time-reversal symmetry ($T$)), altermagnet and fully-compensated ferrimagnet. Studying transitions among net-zero-magnetization magnets is essentially the research on symmetry breaking, which can also clearly reveal the transformation of spin-splitting symmetry. Symmetry breaking can be achieved through methods such as Janus engineering, isovalent alloying, and external electric field. Here, we start from a parent $PT$-antiferromagnet that simultaneously possesses both $P$ and rotational/mirror symmetries to induce altermagnet and fully-compensated ferrimagnet. Based on first-principles calculations, the proposed transitions can be verified in $PT$-antiferromagnet $\mathrm{CrC_2S_6}$ monolayer. By Janus engineering and isovalent alloying, $\mathrm{CrC_2S_6}$ can change into altermagnetic $\mathrm{CrC_2S_3Se_3}$ and fully-compensated ferrimagnetic $\mathrm{CrMoC_2S_6}$. The $\mathrm{CrC_2S_3Se_3}$ can also become fully-compensated ferrimagnetic $\mathrm{CrMoC_2S_3Se_3}$ by isovalent alloying. Our work provides a clear and intuitive example to explain the transitions among net-zero-magnetization magnets, which can inspire more research on net-zero-magnetization magnets.

Title: Comparison of NiFeCr and NiFe in ferromagnetic Josephson junctions
Authors: Joshua Willard, Swapna Sindhu Mishra, Robert M. Klaes, Nicholas J. Emtage, Reza Loloee, Norman O. Birge
Abstract: Josephson junctions containing ferromagnetic materials are under consideration for applications in digital superconducting logic and memory. Some memory applications rely on the ability to reverse the magnetization direction of a "soft" magnetic layer within the junction using a small local magnetic field generated on the chip. It is crucial, therefore, to find a suitable soft magnetic material with a low switching field and low switching energy. A popular magnetic material for such applications is Ni$_{80}$Fe$_{20}$, also known as Permalloy, however Permalloy has a rather large magnetization, leading to large magnetic switching energies. In this work we explore Cr-doped Permalloy, specifically Ni$_{73}$Fe$_{18}$Cr$_{9}$, which has a saturation magnetization just under two-thirds that of Permalloy. Josephson junctions containing this NiFeCr alloy undergo a 0-$\pi$ transition at a NiFeCr thickness of 2.3 nm, and the critical supercurrent decays in the alloy over a short characteristic length of 0.36 nm. Switching fields of a few millitesla are promising, but the short decay length and overall small values of the critical current in the Josephson junctions may preclude the use of NiFeCr in current cryogenic memory technologies.

Title: Striped twisted state in the orientational epitaxy on quasicrystals
Authors: Nicola Manini, Mario Forzanini, Sebastiano Pagano, Marco Bellagente, Martino Colombo, Dario Bertazioli, Tommaso Salvalaggio, Andrea Vanossi, Davide Vanossi, Emanuele Panizon, Erio Tosatti, Giuseppe E. Santoro
Abstract: The optimal "twisted" geometry of a crystalline layer on a crystal is long known, but that on a quasicrystal is still unknown and open. We predict analytically that the layer equilibrium configuration will generally exhibit a nonzero misfit angle. The theory perfectly agrees with numerical optimization of a colloid monolayer on a quasiperiodic decagonal optical lattice. Strikingly different from crystal-on-crystal epitaxy, the structure of the novel emerging twisted state exhibits an unexpected stripe pattern. Its high anisotropy should reflect on the tribomechanical properties of this unconventional interface.

Title: Flat Band and Many-body Gap in Chirally Twisted Triple Bilayer Graphene
Authors: Wenlu Lin, Wenxuan Wang, Shimin Cao, Miao Liang, Lili Zhao, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Jinhua Gao, Jianhao Chen, Xiaobo Lu, Yang Liu
Abstract: We experimentally investigate the band structures of chirally twisted triple bilayer graphene. The new kind of moiré structure, formed by three pieces of helically stacked Bernal bilayer graphene, has flat bands at charge neutral point based on the continuum approximation. We experimentally confirm the existence of flat bands and directly acquire the gap in-between flat bands as well as between the flat bands and dispersive bands from the capacitance measurements. We discover a finite gap even at zero perpendicular electric field, possibly induced by the Coulomb interaction and ferromagnetism. Our quantitative study not only provides solid evidence for the flat-band and interesting physics, but also introduces a quantitative approach to explore phenomena of similar moiré systems.

Title: Angle-dependent resonant dynamics of stripes and skyrmions in Re/Co/Pt multilayers
Authors: Sukanta Kumar Jena, Kilian Lenz, Mateusz Zelent, Mathieu Moalic, Artem Lynnyk, Aleksiej Pietruczik, Paweł Aleszkiewicz, Ewelina Milińska, Jürgen Lindner, Andrzej Wawro
Abstract: The dynamic behavior and stabilization of skyrmions in magnetic multilayers are critical for advancing spintronic and magnonic technologies. In our study, we investigate the static and dynamic properties of $[Re/Co(d_{Co})/Pt]_{20}$ multilayers with varying Co thicknesses $(6\text{-}24 \, \text{Å})$, showcasing a transition from out-of-plane to in-plane magnetic anisotropy. Magnetization reversal leads to a transformation from labyrinth domains to skyrmion bubbles due to the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (iDMI). Using angle-dependent imaging at remanence, we confirm that skyrmions can be stabilized without an external magnetic field at specific polar angles, with the stabilization angle increasing alongside Co thickness. Ferromagnetic resonance spectroscopy reveals four distinct resonant modes, including low-frequency $(2\text{-}18\text{GHz})$, high-frequency $(20\text{-}35 \, \text{GHz})$ modes, depending on the magnetization texture. The frequency range of these modes narrows with decreasing effective anisotropy and iDMI strength decreases in thicker Co layers in perpendicular configurations. Moreover, we observe a decrease in effective Gilbert damping with increasing Co thickness, highlighting the potential for efficient energy dissipation. These findings link between material properties and skyrmion dynamics directly and demonstrate tunable resonant modes for magnonic devices. By addressing both static and dynamic aspects, our work advances the development of next-generation spintronic and magnonic applications.

Title: Correlated electronic structures and unconventional superconductivity in bilayer nickelate heterostructures
Authors: Changming Yue, Jian-Jian Miao, Haoliang Huang, Yichen Hua, Peng Li, Yueying Li, Guangdi Zhou, Wei Lv, Qishuo Yang, Hongyi Sun, Yu-Jie Sun, Junhao Lin, Qi-Kun Xue, Zhuoyu Chen, Wei-Qiang Chen
Abstract: The recent discovery of ambient-pressure superconductivity in thin-film bilayer nickelates opens new possibilities for investigating electronic structures in this new class of high-transition temperature ($\bm{T_\mathrm{C}}$) superconductors. Here, we construct a realistic multi-orbital Hubbard model for the thin-film system based on structural parameters integrating scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) measurements and ab initio calculations. The interaction parameters are calculated with the constrained random phase approximation (cRPA). The on-site Coulomb repulsive $\bm{U}$ and electron filling $\bm{n}$ dependencies of the correlated electronic structure are investigated based on density functional theory (DFT) plus cluster dynamical mean-field theory (CDMFT) methods. The fermi surface topology is substantially changed by $\bm{U}$ around the cRPA value, suggesting the indispensable role of correlation effects. A modified random-phase-approximation (RPA) approach, using $\bm{U=3.5}$ and $\bm{n = 1.3}$, yields a pronounced $\bm{s^{\pm}}$-wave pairing instability, due to the strong spin fluctuations originated from Fermi surface nesting between bands with predominantly $\bm{d_{z^{2}}}$ characters. Our findings may explain the similar onset $\bm{T_\mathrm{C}}$ comparing pressured bulks and strained thin films of the bilayer nickelates.

Title: Intraband motion impact to the polarization dynamics in 2D semiconductors
Authors: A.O. Slobodeniuk, T. Novotný
Abstract: We consider the generation of microscopic polarization in two-dimensional semiconductors under intense optical fields in the nonresonant regime. We demonstrate that the intraband motion of quasiparticles, driven by the electric field of the laser pulse, contributes substantially to the system's polarization. The effects of intraband motion are analyzed using the semiconductor Bloch equations. We propose a method for solving these equations by considering them in a reference frame moving along the trajectories of the quasiparticles in momentum space. We demonstrate the developed technique on transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers irradiated by strong circularly polarized infrared light. The solution is provided in the form of a power series expansion by a small parameter that naturally emerges in the system. The implications of the results are examined, and the limitations of the approach are discussed.

Title: Broadband transient full-Stokes luminescence spectroscopy with high sensitivity
Authors: Antti-Pekka M. Reponen, Marcel Mattes, Zachary A. VanOrman, Lilian Estaque, Grégory Pieters, Sascha Feldmann
Abstract: Materials emitting circularly polarized light (CPL) are highly sought after for applications ranging from efficient displays to quantum information technologies. Established methods for time-resolved CPL characterization have significant limitations, preventing in-depth photophysical insight necessary for materials development. We have designed and built a high-sensitivity (noise level 10^-4), broadband (ca. 400-900 nm), transient (ns resolution, ms range) full-Stokes (CPL and linear polarizations) spectroscopy setup. We demonstrate its broad applicability by measuring compounds with low dissymmetry factors across various timescales, as well as tracking the temporal evolution of linear polarization components alongside associated CPL artefacts. We have written open-source software and used stock optical components to make transient CPL spectroscopy practically accessible to a wide audience, enabling the study of chiral materials in numerous diverse applications.

Title: Coupled Oscillators and Dielectric Function
Authors: T. Das, C. A. Ullrich, U. D. Jentschura
Abstract: A generalized Sellmeier model, also referred to as the Lorentz-Dirac model, has been used for the description of the dielectric function of a number of technologically important materials in the literature. This model represents the frequency-dependent dielectric function as a sum over Green functions of classical damped harmonic oscillators, much in analogy with the functional form used for the dynamic polarizability of an atom, but with one important addition, namely, a complex-valued oscillator strength in the numerator. Here, we show that this generalized functional form can be justified based on the response function of coupled damped oscillators. The encountered analogies suggest an explanation for the generally observed success of the Lorentz--Dirac model in describing the dielectric function of crystals of consummate technological significance.

Title: Towards understanding structure-function relationships in random fiber networks
Authors: Peerasait Prachaseree, Emma Lejeune
Abstract: Random fiber networks form the structural foundation of numerous biological tissues and engineered materials, from living tissue in the human body to everyday materials like fabric and paper. From a mechanics perspective, understanding the structure-function relationships of random fiber networks is particularly interesting because when external force is applied to these networks, only a small subset of fibers will actually carry the majority of the load. Specifically, these load-bearing fibers propagate through the network to form load paths, also called force chains. However, the relationship between fiber network geometric structure, force chains, and the overall mechanical behavior of random fiber network structures remains poorly understood. To this end, we implement a finite element model of random fiber networks with geometrically exact beam elements, and use this model to explore random fiber network mechanical behavior. Our focus is twofold. First, we explore the mechanical behavior of single fiber chains and random fiber networks. Second, we propose and validate an interpretable analytical approach to predicting fiber network mechanics from structural information alone. Key findings include insight into the critical strain-stiffening transition point for single fiber chains and fiber networks, and a connection between force chains and the distance-weighted graph shortest paths that arise by treating fiber networks as spatial graph structures. This work marks an important step towards mapping the structure-function relationships of random fiber networks undergoing large deformations. Additionally, with our code distributed under open-source licenses, we hope that future researchers can directly build on our work to address related problems beyond the scope defined here.

Title: On the origin of heating-induced stiffening and enthalpic reinforcement in elastomeric nanocomposites
Authors: Pierre Kawak, Harshad Bhapkar, David S. Simmons
Abstract: Despite a century of use, the mechanism of nanoparticle-driven mechanical reinforcement of elastomers is unresolved. A major hypothesis attributes it to glassy interparticle bridges, supported by an observed inversion of the variation of the modulus E(T) on heating -- from entropic stiffening in elastomers to enthalpic softening in nanocomposites. Here, molecular simulations reveal that this instead arises from a bulk-modulus mediated competition between elastomer and nanoparticulate networks over preferred nonequilibrium densities under deformation. A theory accounting for softening of the bulk modulus on heating quantitatively predicts the simulated E(T) inversion, suggesting that reinforcement is driven by a volume-competition mechanism unique to co-continuous systems of soft and rigid networks.

Title: Simulating spin$\unicode{x2013}$orbit coupled Bose$\unicode{x2013}$Einstein condensates: a concise overview for non-experts
Authors: Dylan R. Pollard
Abstract: Cold ensembles of bosons are a useful platform for studying many-body quantum states present in quantum technologies, and simulations of these systems are convenient for streamlining design of such technologies. This paper provides an overview of spin$\unicode{x2013}$orbit coupled Bose$\unicode{x2013}$Einstein condensates (SOC BECs), along with an overview of simulation methods and a case study on a novel "microemulsion" phase. These SOC-BECs are further described in the context of coherent states quantum field theory, utilizing the complex Langevin sampling scheme as a numerical algorithm. This approach for studying SOC BECs is a versatile and powerful alternative to particle-based methods and has promise for simulating other bosonic quantum states.

Title: Large Anomalous Hall Effect in a Noncoplanar Magnetic Heterostructure

Abstract: The anomalous Hall effect (AHE) occurs in magnetic systems and also unexpectedly in non-magnetic materials adjacent to magnetic insulators via the heterointerface interactions. However, the AHE in heterostructures induced by magnetic proximity effect remains quite weak, restricting their practical device applications. Here, we report a large intrinsic AHE with a resistivity of 142 n{\Omega} cm at 5 K in noncoplanar magnetic heterostructures of Cr5Te6/Pt. This is the record-high AHE value among all the magnetic insulators/heavy metal heterostructures. A reversal of the AHE signal occurs due to the reconstruction of Berry curvature at the Fermi surface, which is verified by the first-principles calculations. Topological spin textures at the interface are directly visualized via high-magnetic-field magnetic force microscopy, which accounts for the large AHE, as confirmed by the atomic simulations. These findings open a new avenue for exploring large anomalous Hall response in heterointerfaces and facilitate the potential applications in topological spintronic devices.

Title: Unveiling the hidden weak universality of the ZGB model
Authors: Henrique Almeida Fernandes, Roberto da Silva
Abstract: In this work, we revisited the Ziff-Gullari-Barshad (ZGB) model in order to investigate its critical behavior when carbon monoxide (CO) molecules are allowed to desorb from the catalytic surface. As shown by several authors, when this kind of desorption takes place, the first-order phase transition of the standard model disappears, and an Ising-like critical point is found for a very small value of the desorption rate. However, our time-dependent Monte Carlo simulations reveal that, instead of a single critical point, there exists a critical line that encompasses multiple universality classes, passing through the three- and four-state Potts points, as well as, the Ising one, resulting in an unprecedented critical line of weak universality.

Title: Couplings between Photons and Ensemble of Emitters in a High-$Q$ Cavity at Mesoscopic Excitation Levels
Authors: Chenjiang Qian, Viviana Villafañe, Pedro Soubelet, Andreas V. Stier, Jonathan J. Finley
Abstract: We investigate the coupling between an ensemble of individual emitters and multiple photons in a high-$Q$ cavity at the mesoscopic excitation level. The master equation theory is used to calculate the emission spectrum of the cavity QED system. The increasing excitation level not only pumps the system to the high-energy multi-emitter-photon states, but also introduces the pump-induced dephasing that suppresses the coherent energy exchange (coupling) between photons and emitters. When the emitter lifetime exceeds a threshold, we observe the mesoscopic excitation level i.e., the system is pumped to high energy states whilst the coherent couplings between these states are not yet suppressed. The mesoscopic excitation enables the couplings between multi-emitter-photon states, and thereby, paves the way to building quantum photonic devices based on multiple photons and nonlinear effects.

Title: Theory of Order-Disorder Phase Transitions Induced by Fluctuations Based on Network Models
Authors: Yonglong Ding
Abstract: Both quantum phase transitions and thermodynamic phase transitions are probably induced by fluctuations, yet the specific mechanism through which fluctuations cause phase transitions remains unclear in existing theories. This paper summarizes different phases into combinations of three types of network structures based on lattice models transformed into network models and the principle of maximum entropy. These three network structures correspond to ordered, boundary, and disordered conditions, respectively. By utilizing the transformation relationships satisfied by these three network structures and classical probability, this work derive the high-order detailed balance relationships satisfied by strongly correlated systems. Using the high-order detailed balance formula, this work obtain the weights of the maximum entropy network structures in general cases. Consequently, I clearly describe the process of ordered-disordered phase transitions based on fluctuations and provide critical exponents and phase transition points. Finally, I verify this theory using the Ising model in different dimensions, the frustration scenario of the triangular lattice antiferromagnetic Ising model, and the expectation of ground-state energy in the two-dimensional Edwards-Anderson model.

Title: Exact density profile in a tight-binding chain with dephasing noise
Authors: Taiki Ishiyama, Fujimoto Kazuya, Tomohiro Sasamoto
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the many-body dynamics of a tight-binding chain with dephasing noise on the infinite interval. We obtain the exact solution of an average particle-density profile for the domain wall and the alternating initial conditions via the Bethe ansatz, analytically deriving the asymptotic expressions for the long time dynamics. For the domain wall initial condition, we obtain the scaling form of the average density, elucidating that the diffusive transport always emerges in the long time dynamics if the strength of the dephasing, no matter how small, is positive. For the alternating initial condition, our exact solution leads to the fact that the average density displays oscillatory decay or over-damped decay depending on the strength of the dissipation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the asymptotic forms approach those of the symmetric simple exclusion process, identifying corrections from it.

Title: Switching spin filling sequence in a bilayer graphene quantum dot through trigonal warping
Authors: Guo-Quan Qin, Fang-Ming Jing, Tian-Yue Hao, Shun-Li Jiang, Zhuo-Zhi Zhang, Gang Cao, Xiang-Xiang Song, Guo-Ping Guo
Abstract: We demonstrate a switchable electron shell structure in a bilayer graphene quantum dot by manipulating the trigonal warping effect upon electrical gating. Under a small perpendicular electric field, the lowest s-shell is sequentially filled with two spin-up and two spin-down electrons of opposite valleys. When increasing the electric field, an additional three-fold minivalley degeneracy is generated so that the s-shell can be filled with 12 electrons with the first/last 6 electrons having the same spin polarization. The switched spin filling sequence demonstrates the possibility of using the trigonal warping effect to electrically access and manipulate the spin degree of freedom in bilayer graphene.

Title: Interfacial Free Energy as the Key to the Pressure-Induced Deceleration of Ice Nucleation
Authors: Jorge R. Espinosa, Alberto Zaragoza, Pablo Rosales-Peláez, Caridad Navarro, Chantal Valeriani, Carlos Vega, Eduardo Sanz
Abstract: The avoidance of water freezing is the holy grail in the cryopreservation of biological samples, food, and organs. Fast cooling rates are used to beat ice nucleation and avoid cell damage. This strategy can be enhanced by applying high pressures to decrease the nucleation rate, but the physics behind this procedure has not been fully understood yet. We perform computer experiments to investigate ice nucleation at high pressures consisting in embedding ice seeds in supercooled water. We find that the slowing down of the nucleation rate is mainly due to an increase of the ice I-water interfacial free energy with pressure. Our work also clarifies the molecular mechanism of ice nucleation for a wide pressure range. This study is not only relevant to cryopreservation, but also to water amorphization and climate change modeling.

Title: Observation of magnetic skyrmion lattice in Cr$_{0.82}$Mn$_{0.18}$Ge by small-angle neutron scattering
Authors: Victor Ukleev, Tapas Samanta, Oleg I. Utesov, Jonathan S. White, Luana Caron
Abstract: Incommensurate magnetic phases in chiral cubic crystals are an established source of topological spin textures such as skyrmion and hedgehog lattices, with potential applications in spintronics and information storage. We report a comprehensive small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) study on the $B20$-type chiral magnet Cr$_{0.82}$Mn$_{0.18}$Ge, exploring its magnetic phase diagram and confirming the stabilization of a skyrmion lattice under low magnetic fields. Our results reveal a helical ground state with a decreasing pitch from 40 nm to 35 nm upon cooling, and a skyrmion phase stable in applied magnetic fields of 10-30 mT, and over an unusually wide temperature range for chiral magnets of 6 K ($\sim T_\textrm{C}/2 < T < T_\textrm{C}$, $T_\textrm{C}=13$ K). The skyrmion lattice forms a standard two-dimensional hexagonal coordination that can be trained into a single domain, distinguishing it from the three-dimensional hedgehog lattice observed in MnGe-based systems. Additionally, we demonstrate the persistence of a metastable SkL at 2 K, even at zero field. These findings advance our understanding of magnetic textures in Cr-based $B20$ compounds, highlighting Cr$_{0.82}$Mn$_{0.18}$Ge~as a promising material for further exploration in topological magnetism.

Title: Effects of the built-in electric field on free and bound excitons in a polar GaN/AlGaN/GaN based heterostructure
Authors: Loïc Méchin, François Médard, Joël Leymarie, Sophie Bouchoule, Blandine Alloing, Jesùs Zuñiga-Pérez, Pierre Disseix
Abstract: Low-temperature luminescence spectra reveal the presence of two independant populations of GaN excitons within a $\mathrm{GaN/AlGaN/GaN/Al_2O_3}$ heterostructure in which a thick (1.5 $\mathrm{\mu m}$) AlGaN layer separates a thin (150 nm) top GaN layer and a thick (3.5 $\mathrm{\mu m}$) bottom GaN layer grown on sapphire. The presence of these two spectrally-distinct families of excitons in each GaN layer of the heterostructure is demonstrated using three different experimental methods: (i) low-power $\mathrm{\mu}$-photoluminescence ($\mathrm{\mu PL}$) using laser excitation sources with wavelengths above and below the AlGaN bandgap, (ii) $\mathrm{\mu PL}$ as a function of optically injected free carrier density, and (iii) quantitative numerical simulation of the $\mathrm{\mu}$-Reflectivity ($\mathrm{\mu R}$). One major impact of the built-in electric field is the reduction of the excitonic lifetime in the GaN surface layer, which transitions from less than 10 ps in the presence of the built-in electric field to the bulk lifetime (90 ps) when the field is screened. This increase in the excitonic lifetime is related to the modification of the band structure in the presence of optically injected free carriers. The effect of these lifetime variations on the luminescence spectra is analyzed. Lastly, we provide an estimate of the Mott density in GaN as $n_{\mathrm{Mott}} = 4\times 10^{17}\, \mathrm{cm^{-3}}$ at 130 K, consistent with values reported in the literature and accounting for the free carrier density required to screen the electric field.

Abstract: For semiconductor device fabrication, Pulsed Laser Annealing (PLA) offers significant advantages over conventional thermal processes. Notably, it can provide ultrafast (~ns) and high temperature profiles ($>1000^\circ$C). When the maximum temperature exceeds the melting point, a solid-liquid phase transition is observed, immediately followed by rapid recrystallization. This unique annealing mechanism gives raises questions about dopant diffusion and residual defects, in not only in the recrystallized region, but also just below it. As power devices require micrometer-sized junctions, high laser energy densities are needed, which were proved to promote the incorporation of complex impurities from the surface and the creation of defects at the liquid/solid interface. This paper reports on the impact of laser annealing at high energy densities (up to 8.0 J/cm$^2$) on the leakage current, using Schottky and PN diodes, and DLTS measurements. Various laser annealing conditions were used: energy densities between 1.7 and 8.0 J/cm$^2$ with 1 to 10 pulses. Our results suggest that the liquid and solid solubility of vacancies in silicon are fixed by the maximum temperature reached, so to the energy density. Increasing the number of laser pulses allows, not only to reach this maximum vacancy concentration but also to promote their diffusion towards the surface. Concomitantly, the in-diffusion of complex impurities inside the melted region allows the coupling between both defect types to create trap centers, responsible for the degradation of the leakage current.

Title: Species interconversion of deformable particles yields transient phase separation
Authors: Yiwei Zhang, Alessandro Manacorda, Étienne Fodor
Abstract: We consider a dense assembly of repulsive particles whose fluctuating sizes are subject to a landscape that defines three species: particles with finite size, either of type $A$ or of type $B$, and point particles $\varnothing$. We show that the nonequilibrium synchronization of sizes systematically leads to a homogeneous configuration associated with the survival of a single species. Remarkably, the relaxation towards such a configuration features a transient phase separation. By delineating and analyzing the dominant kinetic factors at play during relaxation, we recapitulate the phase diagram of species survival in terms of the parameters of the size landscape. Finally, we obtain a hydrodynamic mapping to equilibrium by coarse-graining the microscopic dynamics, which leads to predicting the nature of the transitions between various regimes where distinct species survive.

Title: Epitaxial thin films of pyrochlore iridates: a forward looking approach
Authors: Araceli Gutiérrez-Llorente
Abstract: Topological quantum materials that show strongly correlated electrons as well as topological order, for which spin-orbit coupling is a key ingredient, exhibit novel states of matter. One such example is the family of pyrochlore iridates, featuring strong spin-orbital coupling, strong electron interactions as well as geometric frustration, making them an ideal platform to study novel topological phases. High-quality epitaxial pyrochlore iridate films, although challenging to produce, provide a pathway to explore unconventional behaviours and unravel the intrinsic properties of these largely unexplored materials. Additionally, designing interfaces with specific properties is crucial to create multilayered devices that can achieve significant technological breakthroughs using topological states of these materials. This article reviews experimental work on epitaxial pyrochlore iridate thin films, discussing evidence of topological phases found in them. Future research directions are outlined, which include exploring the rich tunability offered by chemical doping, especially when combined with the design of epitaxial heterostructures.

Title: Nonvolatile Magnonics in Bilayer Magnetic Insulators
Authors: Jinyang Ni, Zhenlong Zhang, Jinlian Lu, Quanchao Du, Zhijun Jiang, Laurent Bellaiche
Abstract: Nonvolatile control of spin order or spin excitations offers a promising avenue for advancing spintronics; however, practical implementation remains challenging. In this letter, we propose a general framework to realize electrical control of magnons in 2D magnetic insulators. We demonstrate that in bilayer ferromagnetic insulators with strong spin-layer coupling, electric field Ez can effectively manipulate the spin exchange interactions between the layers, enabling nonvolatile control of the corresponding magnons. Notably, in this bilayer, Ez can induce nonzero Berry curvature and orbital moments of magnons, the chirality of which are coupled to the direction of Ez. This coupling facilitates Ez manipulate the corresponding magnon valley and orbital Hall currents. Furthermore, such bilayers can be easily engineered, as demonstrated by our density-functional-theory calculations on Janus bilayer Cr-based ferromagnets. Our work provides an important step toward realizing nonvolatile magnonics and paves a promising way for future magnetoelectric coupling devices.

Title: Beyond being free: glassy dynamics of SrTiO$_3$-based two-dimensional electron gas
Authors: Jyotirmay Maity, Shashank Kumar Ojha, Prithwijit Mandal, Manav Beniwal, Nandana Bhattacharya, Andrei Gloskovskii, Christoph Schlueter, Srimanta Middey
Abstract: Electron glasses offer a convenient laboratory platform to study glassy dynamics. Traditionally, the interplay between long-range Coulomb interactions and disorder is deemed instrumental in stabilizing the electron glass phase. Existing experimental studies on electron glass have focused on doped semiconductors, strongly correlated systems, granular systems, etc., all of which are far from the well-delocalized limit. In this work, we expand the study of electron glasses to a well-known quantum paraelectric SrTiO$_3$ (STO) and unveil a new scenario: how naturally occurring ferroelastic twin walls of STO could result in glassy electrons, even in a metallic state. We show that the emergent two-dimensional electron gas at the $\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$/STO interface exhibits long-lasting temporal relaxations in resistance and memory effects at low temperatures, which are hallmarks of glassiness. We also demonstrate that the glass-like relaxations could be further tuned by application of an electric field. This implies that the observed glassy dynamics is connected with the development of polarity near the structural twin walls of STO and the complex interactions among them, arising from the coupling between ferroelastic and ferroelectric orders. The observation of this glassy metal phase not only extends the concept of electron glasses to metallic systems with multiple order parameters but also contributes to the growing understanding of the fascinating and diverse physical phenomena that emerge near the quantum critical point.

Title: Review and analysis of thermophysical properties of a sulfuric acid-water electrolyte
Authors: Laura Oca, Jose Miguel Campillo, Mounir M. Bou-Ali
Abstract: In this work, we have performed a critical review of the thermophysical properties of sulfuric acid-water mixtures. The thermophysical properties analyzed are density, viscosity, refraction index, thermal expansion coefficient, and mass expansion coefficient. The density of the sulfuric acid-water mixture has been measured for different mass fractions, w = 0.1-0.4, over a broad temperatura range, T = 273.15-333.15 K. A new parametrization of the density has been performed using a least-squares method. In this parametrization, the number of coefficients has been reduced with respect to previous works. Moreover, this new equation has been analyzed in an extended region of temperature and concentration in the following ranges: w = 0-0.1 and T = 233.15-373.15 K. The coefficients of thermal and mass expansion have also been calculated experimentally, and a linear relation of the density has been determined as a function of the variations in temperature and concentration. In addition, viscosity and refraction index measurements have been performed at 298.15 and 293.15 K, respectively. Our results have been checked against measurements in the literature (review) and show good correspondence.

Title: Coarse-graining dense, deformable active particles
Authors: Mehrana R. Nejad, Julia M Yeomans
Abstract: We coarse-grain a model of closely-packed ellipses that can vary their aspect ratio to derive continuum equations for materials comprising confluent deformable particles such as epithelial cell layers. We show that contractile nearest neighbour interactions between ellipses can lead to their elongation and nematic ordering. Adding flows resulting from active hydrodynamic stresses produced by the particles also affects the aspect ratio and can result in active turbulence. Our results, which agree well with multi-phase field simulations of deformable isotropic cells, provide a bridge between models which explicitly resolve cells and continuum theories of active matter.

Title: From Solution to Surface: Persistence of the Diradical Character of a Diindenoanthracene Derivative on a Metallic Substrate
Authors: Jeremy Hieulle, Carlos Garcia Fernandez, Niklas Friedrich, Alessio Vegliante, Sofia Sanz, Daniel Sanchez-Portal, Michael M. Haley, Juan Casado, Thomas Frederiksen, Jose Ignacio Pascual
Abstract: Organic diradicals are envisioned as elementary building blocks for designing a new generation of spintronic devices and have been used in constructing prototypical field effect transistors and non-linear optical devices. Open-shell systems, however, are also reactive, thus requiring design strategies to protect their radical character from the environment, especially when they are embedded into solid-state devices. Here, we report the persistence on a metallic surface of the diradical character of a diindeno[b,i]anthracene (DIAn) core protected by bulky end-groups. Our scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements on single-molecules detected singlet-triplet excitations that were absent for DIAn species packed in assembled structures. Density functional theory simulations unravel that molecular geometry on the metal substrate can crucially modify the value of the single-triplet gap via the delocalization of the radical sites. The persistence of the diradical character over metallic substrates is a promising finding for integrating radical-based materials in functional devices.

Title: Theoretical characterization of NV-like defects in 4H-SiC using ADAQ with the SCAN and r2SCAN meta-GGA functionals
Authors: Ghulam Abbas, Oscar Bulancea-Lindvall, Joel Davidsson, Rickard Armiento, Igor A. Abrikosov
Abstract: Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT) is widely used for screening color centers in semiconductors. While the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional is efficient, it often lacks precision in describing defects. The Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE) functional is more accurate but computationally expensive, making it impractical for large-scale screening. However, third-rung functionals of "Jacob's ladder" remain largely under explored in this context. This study evaluates the Strongly Constrained and Appropriately Normed (SCAN) family of meta-GGA functionals as potential alternatives to PBE for characterizing NV-like color centers in 4H-SiC using the Automatic Defect Analysis and Qualification (ADAQ) framework. We examine nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, sulfur, and chlorine vacancies in 4H-SiC, focusing on applications in quantum technology. Our results show that SCAN and r2SCAN achieve greater accuracy than PBE, approaching HSE's precision at a lower computational cost. This suggests that the SCAN family offers a practical improvement for screening new color centers, with computational demands similar to PBE.

Title: Feedback cooling of fermionic atoms in optical lattices
Authors: Wenhua Zhao, Ling-Na Wu, Francesco Petiziol, André Eckardt
Abstract: We discuss the preparation of topological insulator states with fermionic ultracold atoms in optical lattices by means of measurement-based Markovian feedback control. The designed measurement and feedback operators induce an effective dissipative channel that stabilizes the desired insulator state, either in an exact way or approximately in the case where additional experimental constraints are assumed. %taken into account. Successful state preparation is demonstrated in one-dimensional insulators as well as for Haldane's Chern insulator, by calculating the fidelity between the target ground state and the steady state of the feedback-modified master equation. The fidelity is obtained via time evolution of the system with moderate sizes. For larger 2D systems, we compare the mean occupation of the single-particle eigenstates for the ground and steady state computed through mean-field kinetic equations.

Title: Bond Disordered Antiferromagnetic Quantum Spin Chains with Long Range Interactions
Authors: Stefan Kettemann
Abstract: We introduce and implement a reformulation of the strong disorder renormalization group (SDRG) in real space, which is well suited to study bond disordered power law long range coupled, antiferromagnetic quantum spin chains. We derive the distribution function of couplings $J$ with corrections to the previously derived strong disorder fixed point distribution, which depend on power exponent $\alpha$ and coupling anisotropy $\gamma.$ As a consequence, the low temperature magnetic susceptibility is found to diverge with an anomalous power law. The distribution of singlet lengths is found to decay more slowly than obtained previously, with severe consequences for physical properties. The entanglement entropy of a subsystem of length $n$ is thereby found to increase with a power law, rather than logarithmically, corresponding to a subvolume law for sufficiently large $\alpha$. We argue that volume law entanglement entropy can appear due to the emergence of rainbow states. A formula for $\alpha_c$ below which such rainbow states emerge is given.

Title: Phenomenological model of crack patterns in thin colloidal films undergoing desiccation
Authors: Yuri Yu. Tarasevich, Andrei V. Eserkepov, Irina V. Vodolazskaya, Avik P. Chatterjee
Abstract: A number of geometric and topological properties of samples of crack-template based conductive films are examined to assess the degree to which Voronoi diagrams can successfully model structure and conductivity in such networks. Our analysis suggests that although Poisson--Voronoi diagrams are only partially successful in modeling structural features of real-world crack patterns formed in films undergoing desiccation, such diagrams can nevertheless be useful in situations where topological characteristics are more important than geometric ones. A phenomenological model is proposed that is more accurate at capturing features of the real-world crack patterns.

Title: Nonequilibrium effects in spin-torque oscillators
Authors: Pieter M. Gunnink, Tim Ludwig, Alexander Shnirman, Rembert A. Duine
Abstract: One of the cornerstones of spintronics is the application of a spin-transfer torque to a nanomagnet, driving the magnetization of the nanomagnet into a steady-state precession and realizing a spin-torque oscillator. Such a steady state, sustained by a balance between driving and dissipation, could be a textbook example for a nonequilibrium situation. Nevertheless, most theoretical descriptions of spin-torque oscillators simply assume local equilibrium. Here, based on a simple model, we investigate the relevance of nonequilibrium effects in spin-torque oscillators. We use a nonequilibrium Keldysh description, which allows us to treat the effects of spin relaxation, and find that, in the absence of spin relaxation, persistent precessions of the magnetization are not allowed, if magnetic anisotropies are absent. However, introducing spin relaxation enables persistent precessions, where the strength of the spin relaxation has quantitative and qualitative effects on the magnetization dynamics. In the presence of magnetic anisotropy, we find that persistent precessions are allowed even if spin relaxation is absent, but spin relaxation causes a nonlinear relation between the oscillator power and the applied voltage bias. Finally, we consider an alternative spin relaxation mechanism and study the resulting magnetization precessions, highlighting the importance of understanding the exact nature of the relaxation in nanomagnets.

Title: Capillary Pressure-Saturation relation derived from the Pore Morphology Method
Authors: Fernando Alonso-Marroquin, Martin P. Andersson
Abstract: A computationally efficient method to calculate the capillary pressure-saturation relations of immiscible multiphase flow on two-dimensional pore morphologies is presented here. The method is an extension of the Pore Morphology Method that includes wetting angle and trapped mechanism of the displaced fluid, and calculation of material properties by density functional theory. After validating the method with micro-chip fluid injection experiments, the method is used to relate pore morphology to capillary pressure-saturation relation using square-lattice pore morphologies. Because the method uses only morphological binary operations, it is more efficient than well-established high-resolution voxel dynamics methods such as Lattice Boltzmann Methods and Level-set computational fluid dynamics. Apart from pore morphology, only the material parameters related to contact angle (wettability) and interfacial tension are required to connect the pore-saturation relation and pore throat distribution. We investigate the effect on interfacial tension, wettability, sample size, and pore throat distribution on entry pressure and residual saturation.

Title: Simulating the Hubbard Model with Equivariant Normalizing Flows
Authors: Dominic Schuh, Janik Kreit, Evan Berkowitz, Lena Funcke, Thomas Luu, Kim A. Nicoli, Marcel Rodekamp
Abstract: Generative models, particularly normalizing flows, have shown exceptional performance in learning probability distributions across various domains of physics, including statistical mechanics, collider physics, and lattice field theory. In the context of lattice field theory, normalizing flows have been successfully applied to accurately learn the Boltzmann distribution, enabling a range of tasks such as direct estimation of thermodynamic observables and sampling independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) configurations. In this work, we present a proof-of-concept demonstration that normalizing flows can be used to learn the Boltzmann distribution for the Hubbard model. This model is widely employed to study the electronic structure of graphene and other carbon nanomaterials. State-of-the-art numerical simulations of the Hubbard model, such as those based on Hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) methods, often suffer from ergodicity issues, potentially leading to biased estimates of physical observables. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that leveraging i.i.d.\ sampling from the normalizing flow effectively addresses these issues.

Title: Million-atom simulation of the set process in phase change memories at the real device scale
Authors: Omar Abou El Kheir, Marco Bernasconi
Abstract: Phase change materials are exploited in several enabling technologies such as storage class memories, neuromorphic devices and memories embedded in microcontrollers. A key functional property for these applications is the fast crystal nucleation and growth in the supercool liquid phase. Over the last decade, atomistic simulations based on density functional theory (DFT) have provided crucial insights on the early stage of this process. These simulations are, however, restricted to a few hundred atoms for at most a few ns. More recently, the scope of the DFT simulations have been greatly extended by leveraging on machine learning techniques. In this paper, we show that the exploitation of a recently devised neural network potential for the prototypical phase change compound Ge$_2$Sb$_2$Te$_5$, allows simulating the crystallization process in a multimillion atom model at the length and time scales of the real memory devices. The simulations provide a vivid atomistic picture of the subtle interplay between crystal nucleation and crystal growth from the crystal/amorphous rim. Moreover, the simulations have allowed quantifying the distribution of point defects controlling electronic transport, in a very large crystallite grown at the real conditions of the set process of the device.

Title: BKT transitions of the XY and six-state clock models on the various two-dimensional lattices
Authors: Yutaka Okabe, Hiromi Otsuka
Abstract: In a two-dimensional (2D) spin system, the XY model, characterized by planar rotational symmetry, exhibits a unique phenomenon known as the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition. In contrast, the clock model, which introduces discrete rotational symmetry, exhibits the BKT transition at two different temperatures due to this discreteness. In this study, we numerically investigate the BKT transition for XY and six-state clock models over various two-dimensional lattices. We employ two primary methods: the Monte Carlo method, which analyzes the size dependence of the ratio of the correlation functions for two different distances, and a machine-learning approach to classify the different phases -- namely, the low-temperature ordered phase, the intermediate BKT phase, and the high-temperature disordered phase. We identify the BKT transition temperatures for the XY and six-state models on honeycomb, kagome, and diced lattices. Combined with the previously calculated data for the triangular lattice, we then compare these values with the second-order phase transition temperatures of the 2D Ising model, for which exact solutions are known. Our results indicate that the ratio of the BKT transition temperatures for each lattice relative to the Ising model transition temperatures are close, although the values are not universal.

Title: Correlation stabilized ferromagnetic MnRuAs with distorted kagome lattice
Authors: Anusree C V, Andrzej Ptok, Paweł Sobieszczyk, G. Vaitheeswaran, V. Kanchana
Abstract: We present an in-depth analysis of MnRuAs, a compound crystallizing in the P$\bar{6}$2m symmetry with a distorted kagome lattice, revealing its distinctive structural, magnetic, and electronic properties through state-of-the-art ab initio calculations. By incorporating strong correlation effects using the DFT+U approach, we demonstrate the stabilization of MnRuAs, transforming its inherent dynamical instability into a robust ferromagnetic state with significant coupling along the $c$ axis. The calculated magnon dispersion reveals a parabolic profile with a minimum at the $\Gamma$ point, indicative of ferromagnetic behavior. Furthermore, MnRuAs exhibits intriguing electronic properties, including quasi-one-dimensional Fermi surface and the formation of nodal sphere. Our study also delves into the electronic surface states and constant energy contours, offering valuable insights into the complex physics of this material.

Authors: Philipp Lunt, Paul Hill, Johannes Reiter, Philipp M. Preiss, Maciej Gałka, Selim Jochim
Abstract: We engineer angular momentum eigenstates of a single atom by using a novel all-optical approach based on the interference of Laguerre-Gaussian beams. We confirm the imprint of angular momentum by measuring the two-dimensional density distribution and by performing Ramsey spectroscopy in a slightly anisotropic trap, which additionally reveals the sense of rotation. This article provides the experimental details on the quantum state control of angular momentum eigenstates reported in P. Lunt et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 253401 (2024).

Title: Magnetic field-controlled nanoscale spin-wave vertical directional coupler
Authors: Krzysztof Szulc, Maciej Krawczyk
Abstract: The directional coupler is a fundamental element of wave-based circuits. The state of the art for the spin-wave directional couplers consists mostly of macroscopic waveguides or two-dimensional planar systems. In this Letter, we present the design of the nanoscale spin-wave vertical directional coupler with a very high efficiency exceeding 99.5%. We demonstrate that the operation of the coupler can be controlled by the magnitude of the external magnetic field. Moreover, it can perform multiplexing and demultiplexing of the spin-wave signal. Such a device ought to become an essential element of the three-dimensional magnonic circuits.

Title: Nonreciprocal charge transport in polar Dirac metals with tunable spin-valley coupling
Authors: M. Kondo, M. Kimata, M. Ochi, T. Kaneko, K. Kuroki, K. Sudo, S. Sakaguchi, H. Murakawa, N. Hanasaki, H. Sakai
Abstract: Nonreciprocal charge transport in solids, where resistance is different between rightward and leftward currents, is a key function of rectifying devices in the modern electronics, as exemplified by $p$-$n$ semiconductor junctions. Recently, this was also demonstrated in noncentrosymmetric materials in magnetic fields, since their band structure exhibits spin polarization coupled to the position of momentum space due to the antisymmetric spin-orbit coupling. To enhance the magnitude of nonreciprocal effect, it is essential to tune such spin-momentum coupling, which has been hampered in the conventional materials owing to the difficulty in controlling the broken inversion symmetry built into the lattice and interfacial structures. Here we report large nonreciprocal resistivity in layered polar metal BaMn$X_2$ ($X$=Sb, Bi), where the spin-polarized Dirac dispersion depends on the in-plane polarization tunable by chemical substitution of the $X$ site. For $X$=Sb with a pair of single-type valleys, the nonreciprocal resistivity increases monotonically with decreasing temperature, while for $X$=Bi with multiple types of valleys it is reduced by about an order of magnitude and exhibits a peak at a low temperature. Theoretical calculations indicate that the nonreciprocal resistivity is sensitive not only to the spin-momentum (spin-valley) coupling, but also to the Fermi energy and the Dirac dispersion. The observed significant variation of nonreciprocal transport in the same series of materials might be of great use in the design of junction-free rectifying devices and circuits.

Title: Study of gold and bismuth electrical contacts to a MoS$_{2}$ monolayer
Authors: Agata Zielińska, Joanna Prażmowska-Czajka, Mateusz Dyksik, Jonathan Eroms, Dieter Weiss, Regina Paszkiewicz, Mariusz Ciorga
Abstract: Semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) present new possibilities for designing novel electronic devices. An efficient contacting scheme is required to take advantage of exceptional opto-electronic properties of TMDCs in future electronic devices. This is however challenging for TMDCs, mostly due to the typically high Schottky barrier formed between a metal and a semiconductor. Here we investigate different approaches for contacting MoS$_{2}$, utilizing both metallic gold and semimetallic bismuth as contact materials. The collected I-V characteristics of Bi-contacted devices are compared with the performance of traditional gold contacts. The method of AFM ironing, which we used to enhance the parameters of gold contacts, is also described. Additionally, we show preliminary results regarding an optical response for both types of samples.

Title: Quantum oscillations in the heat capacity of Kondo insulator YbB12

Abstract: We observe the magnetic quantum oscillation in the heat capacity of the Kondo insulator YbB$_{12}$. The frequency of these oscillations $F = 670$ T, aligns with findings from magnetoresistance and torque magnetometry experiments for $\mu_0 H > 35$ T in the Kondo insulating phase. Remarkably, the quantum oscillation amplitudes in the heat capacity are substantial, with $\Delta \tilde{C}/T \approx$ 0.5 $\rm{mJ}$ $\rm{mol^{-1}K^{-2}}$ at 0.8 K, accounting for 13$\%$ of the known linear heat capacity coefficient $\gamma$. Double-peak structures of quantum-oscillation amplitudes due to the distribution function of fermions were identified and used to determine the value of the effective mass from the heat capacity, which agrees well with that from torque magnetometry. These observations support charge-neutral fermions contributing to the quantum oscillations in YbB$_{12}$.

Title: Micromagnetic formalism for magnetic multipoles
Authors: Myoung-Woo Yoo, Axel Hoffmann
Abstract: Cluster magnetic multipoles are order parameters that describe the symmetry of spin arrangements in magnetic materials. High-order multipoles are particularly important in non-collinear antiferromagnets, where they determine key physical properties such as the anomalous Hall effect and the magneto-optical Kerr effect. Although non-uniform multipole states have been observed at the micrometer scale, their mesoscopic properties remain largely unexplored. In this work, we develop a general micromagnetic formalism for cluster magnetic multipoles, enabling the study of the spin dynamics in non-uniform multipole systems. As an example, we apply this formalism to investigate magnetic-octupole domain-wall dynamics in the non-collinear antiferromagnet Mn3Sn. Our results capture key features of domain-wall motion, including deformation and the emergence of effective inertial mass. This study provides a general framework for studying the dynamics of high-order cluster magnetic multipoles, which is essential for determining the mesoscopic physical properties of non-collinear magnetic materials.

Title: Cells around the corner
Authors: Aniruddh Murali, Prasoon Awasthi, Kirsten Endresen, Arkadiusz Goszczak, Francesca Serra
Abstract: The study of spindle-like cells as nematic liquid crystals has led to remarkable insights in the understanding of tissue organization and morphogenesis. In the characterization of this anomalous liquid crystal material, we focus on the energetic cost of splay and bend deformations, in order to determine the elastic anisotropy of the material, i.e. the ratio of the elastic constants associated with splay and bend. We explore the behavior of monolayers of cells in proximity to corners, where cells arrange in splay or bend configuration, strongly dependent on the amplitude of the wedge angle. The angle at which splay and bend deformations are equally likely is determined by the ratio between splay and bend elastic constants. We also show that the splay and bend deformations under confinement can be well approximated using equilibrium liquid crystal theory and statistical mechanics. Finally, our data suggest that for fibroblast cells the common approximation of equal bend and splay constant is valid.

Title: Influence of carrier density and disorder on the Quantum Hall plateau widths in epitaxial graphene
Authors: Ignacio Figueruelo-Campanero, Yuriko Baba, Alejandro Jimeno-Pozo, Julia García-Pérez, Elvira M. González, Rodolfo Miranda, Francisco Guinea, Enrique Cánovas, Daniel Granados, Pierre Pantaleón, Pablo Burset, Mariela Menghini
Abstract: Since its discovery, graphene has been one of the most prominent 2D materials due to its unique properties and broad range of possible applications. In particular, the half-integer Quantum Hall Effect (HI-QHE) characterized by the quantization of Hall resistivity as a function of applied magnetic field, offers opportunities for advancements in quantum metrology and the understanding of topological quantum states in this 2D material. While the role of disorder in stabilizing quantum Hall plateaus (QHPs) is widely recognized, the precise interplay between the plateaus width, disorder, mobility and carrier density remains less explored. In this work, we investigate the width of the $\nu=6$ QHP in epitaxial graphene Hall bars, focusing on two distinct regions of the device with markedly different electronic mobilities. Depending on the storage conditions, it is possible to modify the carrier density of graphene QHE devices and consequently increase or reduce the mobility. Our experiments reveal mobility variations of up to 200$\%$ from their initial value. In particular, the sample storage time and ambient conditions cause also noticeable changes in the positions and extension of the QHPs. Our results show that the QHP extension for $\nu=6$ differs significantly between the two regions, influenced by both mobility and disorder, rather than solely by carrier density. Transport simulations based on the Landauer-Büttiker formalism with Anderson disorder in a scaled model reveal the critical role of impurities in shaping graphene transport properties defining the extension of the QHPs. This study provides valuable insights into the interplay between mobility, disorder, and quantum transport in graphene systems.

Title: Magnetic phases of the periodic Anderson model in two dimensions
Authors: Imre Hagymási
Abstract: We investigate the ground-state properties of the periodic Anderson model on the square lattice across various band fillings. Employing the infinite projected entangled-pair states (iPEPS) technique, we can determine the magnetic ground states accurately and compare them to mean-field predictions to highlight the effects of quantum fluctuations. At half-filling, we analyze the transition between the antiferromagnetic and paramagnetic (Kondo singlet) phases as a function of hybridization and $f$-level energy, finding excellent agreement with existing quantum Monte Carlo studies in the case of hybridization. For $n = 1.5$ electrons per site, we identify a novel correlated antiferromagnetic diagonal stripe phase as the ground state, which competes with its ferromagnetic partner state.

Title: Kinesin-driven de-mixing of cytoskeleton composites drives emergent mechanical properties
Authors: Janet Sheung, Christopher Gunter, Katarina Matic, Mehrzad Sasanpour, Jennifer L. Ross, Parag Katira, Megan T. Valentine, Rae M. Robertson-Anderson
Abstract: The cytoskeleton is an active composite of filamentous proteins that dictates diverse mechanical properties and processes in eukaryotic cells by generating forces and autonomously restructuring itself. Enzymatic motors that act on the comprising filaments play key roles in this activity, driving spatiotemporally heterogeneous mechanical responses that are critical to cellular multifunctionality, but also render mechanical characterization challenging. Here, we couple optical tweezers microrheology and fluorescence microscopy with simulations and mathematical modeling to robustly characterize the mechanics of active composites of actin filaments and microtubules restructured by kinesin motors. We discover that composites exhibit a rich ensemble of force response behaviors, elastic, yielding, and stiffening, with their propensity and properties tuned by motor concentration and strain rate. Moreover, intermediate kinesin concentrations elicit emergent mechanical stiffness and resistance while higher and lower concentrations exhibit softer, more viscous dissipation. We further show that composites transition from well-mixed interpenetrating double-networks of actin and microtubules to de-mixed states of microtubule-rich aggregates surrounded by relatively undisturbed actin phases. It is this de-mixing that leads to the emergent mechanical response, offering an alternate route that composites can leverage to achieve enhanced stiffness through coupling of structure and mechanics.

Title: The shape of cleaved tethered membranes
Authors: A.D. Chen, M.C. Gandikota, A. Cacciuto
Abstract: A remarkable property of flexible self-avoiding elastic surfaces (membranes) is that they remain flat at all temperatures, even in the absence of a bending rigidity or in the presence of active fluctuations. Here, we report numerical results of these surfaces wherein we alter their topology by systematically cleaving internal bonds. While it is known that a random removal of membrane bonds does not disrupt the overall extended shape of the membrane, we find that cleaving an elastic surface with longitudinal parallel cuts leads to its systematic collapse into a number of complex morphologies that can be controlled by altering the number and length of the inserted cuts. For the simpler case of membranes with bending rigidity but in the absence of self-avoidance, we find that the radius of gyration of the surface as a function of number of cuts is represented by a universal master curve when the variables are appropriately rescaled.

Title: From Fiber to Fabric: Designing the Mechanics of Machine Knitting
Authors: Cosima du Pasquier, Sehui Jeong, Pan Liu, Susan Williams, Allison M. Okamura, Skylar Tibbits, Tian Chen
Abstract: Knit fabrics are mechanically durable and tough while sufficiently flexible to conform to curved substrates such as the human body. Recent advancements in industrial knitting enable unprecedented control over the pattern design and functionality of next generation knit fabrics. However, the ability to leverage this granular control to predict and tune the mechanical behavior of these fabrics remains limited due to their complex hierarchical and entangled microstructure. This study establishes a comprehensive experimental and numerical framework to characterize and model the mechanical properties of industrial knitted fabrics. By integrating precise experiments, finite element modeling, and a strain energy-based homogenization approach, we provide an accurate demonstration of how stitch length, pattern, and yarn material govern the anisotropic mechanical response of knitted fabrics. In doing so, we establish clear quantitative links between these parameters and key material properties, including stiffness and anisotropy, that emerge directly from our energy-based model. Recognizing that industrial knitting systems can produce fabrics with spatially varying parameters, we extend our framework to predict heterogeneous knits. We show that material transitions have minimal impact on the fabric's overall mechanical response, so heterogeneous fabrics can be modeled with our framework as patchworks of homogeneous samples. We design the first industrially knit sleeve explicitly optimized for both fit and function, using heterogeneous patterns that conform to target arm musculature and ensure uniform stress distribution. This work bridges the gap between computational modeling and scalable manufacturing, unlocking new possibilities for wearable devices, assistive textiles, and functional applications.

Authors: Adam Burgess, Erik Gauger
Abstract: We study exciton quantum transfer along a molecular chain whilst accounting for the effects of permanent dipoles that are induced by charge displacements in the molecular orbitals. These effects are typically neglected as they do not arise in atomic quantum optics; however, they can play an important role in molecular systems. We also consider novel collective photon-assisted transport and compare it against the scaling of phonon-assisted transport in chains featuring permanent dipoles, and determine a linear scaling with the number of dipoles, akin to single-excitation superradiance. We further demonstrate how permanent dipoles, dipoles can preferentially arrange energy eigenstates to support excitation transport. Finally, we show how permanent dipoles can enhance the ability of the molecular chain to support excitation transport compared to that of systems that do not possess permanent dipoles across a range of environmental and system configurations.

Title: Mechanics and Design of Metastructured Auxetic Patches with Bio-inspired Materials
Authors: Yingbin Chen, Milad Arzani, Xuan Mu, Sophia Jin, Shaoping Xiao
Abstract: Metastructured auxetic patches, characterized by negative Poisson's ratios, offer unique mechanical properties that closely resemble the behavior of human tissues and organs. As a result, these patches have gained significant attention for their potential applications in organ repair and tissue regeneration. This study focuses on neural networks-based computational modeling of auxetic patches with a sinusoidal metastructure fabricated from silk fibroin, a bio-inspired material known for its biocompatibility and strength. The primary objective of this research is to introduce a novel, data-driven framework for patch design. To achieve this, we conducted experimental fabrication and mechanical testing to determine material properties and validate the corresponding finite element models. Finite element simulations were then employed to generate the necessary data, while greedy sampling, an active learning technique, was utilized to reduce the computational cost associated with data labeling. Two neural networks were trained to accurately predict Poisson's ratios and stresses for strains up to 15\%, respectively. Both models achieved $R^2$ scores exceeding 0.995, which indicates highly reliable predictions. Building on this, we developed a neural network-based design model capable of tailoring patch designs to achieve specific mechanical properties. This model demonstrated superior performance when compared to traditional optimization methods, such as genetic algorithms, by providing more efficient and precise design solutions. The proposed framework represents a significant advancement in the design of bio-inspired metastructures for medical applications, paving the way for future innovations in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.

Title: Soft Error Rate in Space: A Unified Analytical Approach
Authors: G. I. Zebrev, N. N. Samotaev, R. G. Useinov, A. A. Mateiko, A. S. Rodin
Abstract: A new physics-based model for analytical calculation of Soft Error Rate (SER) in digital memory circuits under the influence of heavy ions in space orbits is proposed. This method is based on parameters that are uniquely determined from the results of ground tests under nor-mal ion incidence. It is shown that preliminary averaging over the total solid angle within the standard inverse cosine model allows one to take into account the effect of isotropic flow, which increases the effective SER. The model includes the ability to estimate the contribution to SER of the low LET spectrum region, which is very important for modern ICs with low Single Event Upset tolerance.

Title: A plastic damage model with mixed isotropic-kinematic hardening for low-cycle fatigue in 7020 aluminum
Authors: Alireza Daneshyar, Dorina Siebert, Christina Radlbeck, Stefan Kollmannsberger
Abstract: The paper at hand presents an in-depth investigation into the fatigue behavior of the high-strength aluminum alloy EN AW-7020 T6 using both experimental and numerical approaches. Two types of specimens are investigated: a dog-bone specimen subjected to cyclic loading in a symmetric strain-controlled regime, and a compact tension specimen subjected to repeated loading and unloading, which leads to damage growth from the notch tip. Experimental data from these tests are used to identify the different phases of fatigue. Subsequently, a plastic-damage model is developed, incorporating J2 plasticity with Chaboche-type mixed isotropic-kinematic hardening. A detailed investigation reveals that the Chaboche model must be blended with a suitable isotropic hardening and combined with a proper damage growth model to accurately describe cyclic fatigue including large plastic strains up to failure. Multiple back-stress components with independent properties are superimposed, and exponential isotropic hardening with saturation effects is introduced to improve alignment with experimental results. For damage, different stress splits are tested, with the deviatoric/volumetric split proving successful in reproducing the desired degradation in peak stress and stiffness. A nonlinear activation function is introduced to ensure smooth transitions between tension and compression. Two damage indices, one for the deviatoric part and one for the volumetric part, are defined, each of which is governed by a distinct trilinear damage growth function. The governing differential equation of the problem is regularized by higher-order gradient terms to address the ill-posedness induced by softening. Finally, the plasticity model is calibrated using finite element simulations of the dog-bone test and subsequently applied to the cyclic loading of the compact tension specimen.

Title: Exploring dynamical quantum phase transition from pure states to mixed states through generalized Su-Schrieffer-Heeger models
Authors: Kaiyuan Cao, Jian Wang
Abstract: We investigate dynamic quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) in both pure and mixed states within the framework of the generalized SSH model, specifically analyzing the SSH-3 and SSH-4 models, which exhibit different symmetries. We find that the SSH-3 model, characterized by a chiral-like point symmetry rather than true chiral symmetry, supports robust localized edge states associated with its topological properties. Our results show that DQPTs for pure states occur following a quench that crosses the topological transition, even with an open energy band gap. For mixed states, DQPT behavior is consistent at low temperatures, but significant changes are observed at high temperatures, resulting in the emergence of multiple critical times. In contrast, the SSH-4 model, which possesses chiral symmetry, allows for the analysis of two distinct energy spectrum configurations. We conclude that the occurrence of DQPTs for pure states in the SSH-4 model necessitates a quench from an initial state without a band gap while crossing the critical point of the topological transition, whereas DQPTs are absent for mixed states at elevated temperatures.

Title: Interaction-Induced Second-Order Skin Effect
Authors: Wen-Zheng Ling, Zhao-Fan Cai, Tao Liu
Abstract: In contrast to the conventional (first-order) non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) in a $d$-dimensional system with linear size $L$, the $n$th-order (higher-order) NHSE is characterized by skin modes localized at lower-dimensional boundaries of dimension $(d-n)$. The total number of these modes scales linearly with the system size $L$. Significant progress has been made in understanding higher-order NHSE in non-interacting systems. In this work, we demonstrate the many-body interaction induced second-order skin effect in a two-dimensional non-Hermitian bosonic system. Specifically, we construct a non-Hermitian square lattice that incorporates nonreciprocal single-boson hopping, onsite many-body interactions and two-boson pairing hopping. In the absence of interactions, no second-order NHSE is observed. However, with the inclusion of interactions, we identify interaction-induced skin modes for in-gap doublon states (i.e., bound pairs of bosons) localized at the corners of the lattice, while the bulk doublon states remain extended. These corner-localized skin modes arise from the interplay between interaction-induced edge states, localized along one-dimensional boundaries, and the nonreciprocal hopping along these boundaries. Furthermore, the number of corner skin modes scales linearly with the system size, confirming the presence of second-order NHSE in this interacting system. Our findings introduce a novel approach to realizing higher-order skin effects by leveraging interactions.

Title: Black-box optimization and quantum annealing for filtering out mislabeled training instances
Authors: Makoto Otsuka, Kento Kodama, Keisuke Morita, Masayuki Ohzeki
Abstract: This study proposes an approach for removing mislabeled instances from contaminated training datasets by combining surrogate model-based black-box optimization (BBO) with postprocessing and quantum annealing. Mislabeled training instances, a common issue in real-world datasets, often degrade model generalization, necessitating robust and efficient noise-removal strategies. The proposed method evaluates filtered training subsets based on validation loss, iteratively refines loss estimates through surrogate model-based BBO with postprocessing, and leverages quantum annealing to efficiently sample diverse training subsets with low validation error. Experiments on a noisy majority bit task demonstrate the method's ability to prioritize the removal of high-risk mislabeled instances. Integrating D-Wave's clique sampler running on a physical quantum annealer achieves faster optimization and higher-quality training subsets compared to OpenJij's simulated quantum annealing sampler or Neal's simulated annealing sampler, offering a scalable framework for enhancing dataset quality. This work highlights the effectiveness of the proposed method for supervised learning tasks, with future directions including its application to unsupervised learning, real-world datasets, and large-scale implementations.

Title: Relativistic model of spontaneous wave-function localization induced by nonHermitian colored noise
Authors: Pei Wang
Abstract: We propose a relativistic model of spontaneous wave-function collapse, based on a random nonHermitian action where the fermion density operator is coupled to a universal colored noise. Upon quantization, the wave function obeys a nonlinear stochastic differential equation that respects statistical Lorentz symmetry. The localization mechanism is driven by the colored noise, derived from the d'Alembert equation using generalized stochastic calculus in 1+3-dimensional spacetime. We analytically determine the noise-induced localization length, which decreases as the size of the observable universe increases.

Title: Combined effect of incentives and coupling in multigames in two-layer networks
Authors: Luo-Luo Jiang, Yi-Ming Li, Wen-Jing Li, Attila Szolnoki
Abstract: The lack of cooperation can easily result in inequality among members of a society, which provides an increasing gap between individual incomes. To tackle this issue, we introduce an incentive mechanism based on individual strategies and incomes, wherein a portion of the income from defectors is allocated to reward low-income cooperators, aiming to enhance cooperation by improving the equitable distribution of wealth across the entire population. Moreover, previous research has typically employed network structures or game mechanisms characterized by homogeneity. In this study, we present a network framework that more accurately reflects real-world conditions, where agents are engaged in multiple games, including prisoner's dilemma games in the top-layer and public good games in the down-layer networks. Within this framework, we introduce the concept of ``external coupling'' which connects agents across different networks as acquaintances, thereby facilitating access to shared datasets. Our results indicate that the combined positive effects of external coupling and incentive mechanism lead to optimal cooperation rates and lower Gini coefficients, demonstrating a negative correlation between cooperation and inequality. From a micro-level perspective, this phenomenon primarily arises from the regular network, whereas suboptimal outcomes are observed within the scale-free network. These observations help to give a deeper insight into the interplay between cooperation and wealth disparity in evolutionary games in large populations.

Title: Revealing Point Group Symmetry of Rare-earth Dopants via Polarization-resolved Single-particle Microspectroscopy
Authors: Peng Li, Yaxin Guo, Yaoxu Yan, Fu Liu, Yanpeng Zhang, Feng Yun, Rongqian Wu, Yi Lyu, Feng Li
Abstract: The local point group symmetry of luminescent centers, such as defects, impurities, and dopant ions within a crystal, dictates their optical transition properties. While conventional low-temperature spectroscopy quantifies point group symmetry by enumerating the splitting of optical transitions, it fails to capture vectorial symmetry information, such as the orientation of symmetry axes. Here, we establish a quantitative link between point group symmetry, crystal symmetry, optical transition dipole orientation, and polarized luminescence in rare-earth-doped single-particle crystals using computational electromagnetism. Combined with room-temperature single-particle polarization spectroscopy, we resolve the magnetic dipole orientations from individual optical transition of dopant ions in single microcrystal, enabling precise identification of point group symmetry and its axes. We observe single-particle chirality arising from spontaneous symmetry breaking of intrinsically chiral space group during crystallization. Based on point group and crystal symmetries, we present a practical scheme to optical sensing the 3D orientation of rare-earth-doped single particles in dynamic environments by using two arbitrarily transition bands from single-view polarization spectra. Our computational electromagnetism framework not only elucidates polarized luminescence but also provides insights into optimizing dipole orientation-dependent energy transfer for designing ultra-bright rare-earth-doped nanocrystals, such as Förster resonance energy transfer, and can interpret enhanced linear polarization in extreme optical phenomena like stimulated emission, superradiance, and superfluorescence following dipole-coherent radiation in single emitters.

Title: Competing Effects of Local Solvation Structures on Chemical Shift Changes of Liquid Electrolyte
Authors: Qi You, Yan Sun, Feng Wang, Jun Cheng, Fujie Tang
Abstract: Understanding the solvation structure of electrolytes is critical for optimizing the electrochemical performance of rechargeable batteries, as it directly influences properties such as ionic conductivity, viscosity, and electrochemical stability. The highly complex structures and strong interactions in high-concentration electrolytes make accurate modeling and interpretation of their ``structure-property" relationships even more challenging with spectroscopic methods. In this study, we present a machine learning-based approach to predict dynamic $^7$Li NMR chemical shifts in LiFSI/DME electrolyte solutions. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive structural analysis to interpret the observed chemical shift behavior in our experiments, particularly the abrupt changes in $^7$Li chemical shifts at high concentrations. Using advanced modeling techniques, we quantitatively establish the relationship between molecular structure and NMR spectra, offering critical insights into solvation structure assignments. Our findings reveal the coexistence of two competing local solvation structures that shift in dominance as electrolyte concentration approaches the concentrated limit, leading to anomalous reverse of $^7$Li NMR chemical shift in our experiment. This work provides a detailed molecular-level understanding of the intricate solvation structures probed by NMR spectroscopy, leading the way for enhanced electrolyte design.

Title: Momentum coupling of classical atoms
Authors: Andras Suto
Abstract: A new method, dual-space cluster expansion, is proposed to study classical phases transitions in the continuum. It relies on replacing the particle positions as integration variables by the momenta of the relative displacements of particle pairs. Due to the requirement that the particles must be static, coupling via the momenta partitions the set of particles into a set of clusters, and transforms the partition function into a sum over the different cluster decompositions. This allows us to derive a formula for the density that finite clusters can carry in the infinite system. In a simplified example, we then demonstrate that in two and higher dimensions this density has a threshold, beyond which the particles form infinite clusters. The transition is accompanied by a singularity in the free energy. We also show that infinite clusters are always present in condensed phases, most likely submacroscopic in liquids and macroscopic in crystals.

Title: Machine Learning-Enhanced Characterisation of Structured Spectral Densities: Leveraging the Reaction Coordinate Mapping
Authors: Jessica Barr, Alessandro Ferraro, Mauro Paternostro, Giorgio Zicari
Abstract: Spectral densities encode essential information about system-environment interactions in open-quantum systems, playing a pivotal role in shaping the system's dynamics. In this work, we leverage machine learning techniques to reconstruct key environmental features, going beyond the weak-coupling regime by simulating the system's dynamics using the reaction coordinate mapping. For a dissipative spin-boson model with a structured spectral density expressed as a sum of Lorentzian peaks, we demonstrate that the time evolution of a system observable can be used by a neural network to classify the spectral density as comprising one, two, or three Lorentzian peaks and accurately predict their central frequency.

Title: Chemical potential and variable number of particles control the quantum state: Quantum oscillators as a showcase
Authors: Benedikt M. Reible, Ana Djurdjevac, Luigi Delle Site
Abstract: Despite their simplicity, quantum harmonic oscillators are ubiquitous in the modeling of physical systems. They are able to capture universal properties that serve as reference for the more complex systems found in nature. In this spirit, we apply a model of a Hamiltonian for open quantum systems in equilibrium with a particle reservoir to ensembles of quantum oscillators. By treating (i) a dilute gas of vibrating particles and (ii) a chain of coupled oscillators as showcases, we demonstrate that the property of varying number of particles leads to a mandatory condition on the energy of the system. In particular, the chemical potential plays the role of a parameter of control that can externally manipulate the spectrum of a system and the corresponding accessible quantum states.

Title: Zero-temperature phase-flip rate in a biased parametric oscillator
Authors: Daniel K. J. Boneß, Mark I. Dykman, Wolfgang Belzig
Abstract: A parametrically driven oscillator has two stable vibrational states at half the modulation frequency. The states have opposite phase and equal amplitudes. An extra drive at half the modulation frequency provides an effective bias that lifts the state symmetry. Quantum fluctuations lead to switching between the states, i.e., to phase-flip transitions. We develop a semiclassical approach that allows us to find the dependence of the switching rates on the amplitude of the bias and the parameters of the modulating field. We find that the rate of switching from a ''shallow'' state can become anomalously small at certain parameter values, leading to an efficient localization in this state. This is a consequence of the change of the topology of the oscillator phase trajectories. The results pave the way for implementing nonreciprocal quantum Ising systems based on parametric oscillators.

Title: MOCVD growth and band offsets of \k{appa}-phase Ga2O3 on sapphire, GaN, AlN and YSZ substrates
Authors: A F M Anhar Uddin Bhuiyan, Zixuan Feng, Hsien-Lien Huang, Lingyu Meng, Jinwoo Hwang, Hongping Zhao
Abstract: Epitaxial growth of \k{appa}-phase Ga2O3 thin films are investigated on c-plane sapphire, GaN- and AlNon-sapphire, and (100) oriented yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) substrates via metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). The structural and surface morphological properties are investigated by comprehensive material characterization. Phase pure \k{appa}-Ga2O3 films are successfully grown on GaN-, AlN-on sapphire, and YSZ substrates through a systematical tuning of the growth parameters including the precursor molar flow rates, chamber pressure and growth temperature, whereas the growth on c-sapphire substrates leads to a mixture of \b{eta}- and \k{appa}polymorphs of Ga2O3 under the investigated growth conditions. The influence of the crystalline structure, surface morphology and roughness of \k{appa}-Ga2O3 films grown on different substrates are investigated as a function of precursor flow rate. High resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HR-STEM) imaging of \k{appa}-Ga2O3 films reveals abrupt interfaces between the epitaxial film and the sapphire, GaN and YSZ substrates. The growth of single crystal orthorhombic \k{appa}Ga2O3 films is confirmed by analyzing the STEM nano-diffraction pattern. The chemical composition, surface stoichiometry, and the bandgap energies of \k{appa}-Ga2O3 thin films grown on different substrates are studied by high resolution x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements. The type-II (staggered) band alignments at three interfaces between \k{appa}-Ga2O3 and c-sapphire, AlN, and YSZ substrates are determined by XPS, with the exception of \k{appa}-Ga2O3/GaN interface, which shows type I (straddling) band alignment.

Title: In-situ MOCVD Growth and Band Offsets of Al$_2$O$_3$ Dielectric on $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ and $\beta$-(Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$)$_2$O$_3$ thin films
Authors: A F M Anhar Uddin Bhuiyan, Lingyu Meng, Hsien-Lien Huang, Jinwoo Hwang, Hongping Zhao
Abstract: The in-situ metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) growth of Al$_2$O$_3$ dielectrics on $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ and $\beta$-(Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$)$_2$O$_3$ films is investigated as a function of crystal orientations and Al compositions of $\beta$-(Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$)$_2$O$_3$ films. The interface and film qualities of Al$_2$O$_3$ dielectrics are evaluated by high resolution X-ray diffraction (HR-XRD) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (HR-STEM) imaging, which indicate the growth of high quality amorphous Al$_2$O$_3$ dielectrics with abrupt interfaces on (010), (100) and (-201) oriented $\beta$-(Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$)$_2$O$_3$ films. The surface stoichiometries of Al$_2$O$_3$ deposited on all orientations of $\beta$-(Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$)$_2$O$_3$ are found to be well maintained with a bandgap energy of 6.91 eV as evaluated by high resolution x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, which is consistent with the atomic layer deposited (ALD) Al$_2$O$_3$ dielectrics. The evolution of band offsets at both in-situ MOCVD and ex-situ ALD deposited Al$_2$O$_3$/$\beta$-(Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$)$_2$O$_3$ are determined as a function of Al composition, indicating the influence of the deposition method, orientation, and Al composition of $\beta$-(Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$)$_2$O$_3$ films on resulting band alignments. Type II band alignments are determined at the MOCVD grown Al$_2$O$_3$/$\beta$-(Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$)$_2$O$_3$ interfaces for (010) and (100) orientations, whereas type I band alignments with relatively lower conduction band offsets are observed along (-201) orientation. Results from this work revealed that the in-situ MOCVD deposited high quality Al$_2$O$_3$ dielectrics with sharp interfaces can be considered as a viable alternative of commonly used ex-situ deposited (ALD) Al$_2$O$_3$ for developing high performance $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ and $\beta$-(Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$)$_2$O$_3$ based devices.

Title: Phase diagram and elementary excitations of strongly interacting droplets with non-local interactions
Authors: Maciej Łebek, Jakub Kopyciński, Wojciech Górecki, Rafał Ołdziejewski, Krzysztof Pawłowski
Abstract: A one-dimensional bosonic gas with strong contact repulsion and attractive non-local interactions may form a quantum droplet with a flat-top density profile. We focus on a system in the Tonks-Girardeau limit of infinitely strong contact repulsion. We show that the main system features are the same for a broad class of non-local interaction potentials. Then, we focus on a limiting case, the one of slowly varying density profiles, to find approximate formulas for the surface and bulk energies of a droplet. We further characterise the system by numerically finding the excitation spectrum. It consists of two families: phononic-like excitations inside droplets and scattering modes. Analysis within the linearised regime is supplemented with the full, nonlinear dynamics of small perturbations.

Title: Detecting charge transfer at defects in 2D materials with electron ptychography
Authors: Christoph Hofer, Jacob Madsen, Toma Susi, Timothy J. Pennycook
Abstract: Electronic charge transfer at the atomic scale can reveal fundamental information about chemical bonding, but is far more challenging to directly image than the atomic structure. The charge density is dominated by the atomic nuclei, with bonding causing only a small perturbation. Thus detecting any change due to bonding requires a higher level of sensitivity than imaging structure and the overall charge density. Here we achieve the sensitivity required to detect charge transfer in both pristine and defected monolayer WS\textsubscript{2} using the high dose efficiency of electron ptychography and its ability to correct for lens aberrations. Excellent agreement is achieved with first-principles image simulations including where thermal diffuse scattering is explicitly modeled via finite-temperature molecular dynamics based on density functional theory. The focused-probe ptychography configuration we use also provides the important ability to concurrently collect the annular dark-field signal, which can be unambiguously interpreted in terms of the atomic structure and chemical identity of the atoms, independently of the charge transfer. Our results demonstrate both the power of ptychographic reconstructions and the importance of quantitatively accurate simulations to aid their interpretation.

Title: Metalorganic Chemical Vapor Deposition of \b{eta}-(AlxGa1-x)2O3 thin films on (001) \b{eta}-Ga2O3 substrates
Authors: A. F. M. Anhar Uddin Bhuiyan, Lingyu Meng, Hsien-Lien Huang, Jith Sarker, Chris Chae, Baishakhi Mazumder, Jinwoo Hwang, Hongping Zhao
Abstract: Phase pure \b{eta}-(AlxGa1-x)2O3 thin films are grown on (001) oriented \b{eta}-Ga2O3 substrates via metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). By systematically tuning the precursor molar flow rates, the epitaxial growth of coherently strained \b{eta}-(AlxGa1-x)2O3 films are demonstrated with up to 25% Al compositions as evaluated by high resolution x-ray diffraction (XRD). The asymmetrical reciprocal space mapping confirms the growth of coherent \b{eta}-(AlxGa1-x)2O3 films (x < 25%) on (001) \b{eta}-Ga2O3 substrates. While the films show smooth surface morphologies, the alloy inhomogeneity with local segregation of Al along (-201) plane is observed from atomic resolution STEM imaging, resulting in wavy and inhomogeneous interfaces in \b{eta}-(AlxGa1-x)2O3/\b{eta}-Ga2O3 superlattice structure. Room temperature Raman spectra of \b{eta}-(AlxGa1-x)2O3 films show similar characteristics peaks as (001) \b{eta}-Ga2O3 substrate without obvious Raman shifts for films with different Al compositions. Atom probe tomography (APT) was used to investigate the atomic level structural chemistry with increasing Al content in the \b{eta}-(AlxGa1-x)2O3 films. A monotonous increase in chemical heterogeneity is observed from the in-plane Al/Ga distributions which was further confirmed via statistical frequency distribution analysis (FDA). Although the films exhibit alloy fluctuations, n-type doping with good electrical properties are demonstrated for films with various Al compositions. The determined valence and conduction band offsets at \b{eta}-(AlxGa1-x)2O3/\b{eta}-Ga2O3 heterojunctions using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) reveal the formation of type-II (staggered) band alignment.

Title: Extend the random-walk shielding-potential viscosity model to hot temperature regime
Authors: Yuqing Cheng, Xingyu Gao, Qiong Li, Yu Liu, Haifeng Song, Haifeng Liu
Abstract: The transport properties of matter have been widely investigated. In particular, shear viscosity over a wide parameter space is crucial for various applications, such as designing inertial confinement fusion (ICF) targets and determining the Rayleigh-Taylor instability. In this work, an extended random-walk shielding-potential viscosity model (ext-RWSP-VM) based on the statistics of random-walk ions and the Debye shielding effect is proposed to elevate the temperature limit of RWSP-VM [Phys. Rev. E 106, 014142] in evaluating the shear viscosity of one component plasma. In the extended model, we reconsider the collision distance that is introduced by hard-sphere concept, hence, it is applicable in wide temperature regime rather than a narrower one in which RWSP-VM is applicable. The results of H, C, Al, Fe, Ge, W, and U show that the extended model provides a systematic way to calculate the shear viscosity of arbitrary one component plasma at the densities from about 0.1 to 10 times the normal density (the density at room temperature and 1 standard atmosphere). This work will help to develop viscosity model in wide regime when combined with our previous low temperature viscosity model [AIP Adv. 11, 015043].

Title: Unidirectional superconductivity and superconducting diode effect induced by dissipation
Authors: Akito Daido, Youichi Yanase
Abstract: A general principle of condensed matter physics prohibits the electric current in equilibrium. This prevents a zero-resistance state realized solely under a finite electric current, namely unidirectional superconductivity. In this paper, we propose a setup to realize the unidirectional superconductivity as a nonequilibrium steady state. We focus on the in-plane transport of atomically thin bilayer superconductors lacking the in-plane inversion symmetry and introduce dissipation by applying the out-of-plane electric field and current. By analyzing the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations, we show that locally stable steady-state solutions appear only under the in-plane supercurrent when the out-of-plane electric field exceeds a threshold value. Our system also realizes the dissipation-induced superconducting diode effect up to 100% efficiency by purely electric means.

Title: Inverse design of self-folding 3D shells
Authors: Diogo E. P. Pinto, Nuno A. M. Araújo, Petr Šulc, John Russo
Abstract: Self-folding is an emerging paradigm for the inverse design of three-dimensional structures. While most efforts have concentrated on the shape of the net, our approach introduces a new design dimension-bond specificity between the edges. We transform this design process into a Boolean Satisfiability problem to derive solutions for various target structures. This method significantly enhances the yield of the folding process. Furthermore, by linearly combining independent solutions, we achieve designs for shape-shifting nets wherein the dominant structure evolves with varying external conditions. This approach is demonstrated through coarse-grained simulations on two examples of triangular and square nets capable of folding into multiple target shapes.

Title: Uniaxial zero thermal expansion in low-cost Mn2OBO3 from 3.5 to 1250 K
Authors: Chi-Hung Lee, Cheng-Yen Lin, Guan-Yu Chen
Abstract: Unique zero thermal expansion (ZTE) materials are valuable for use in precision instruments, including electronics, aerospace parts, and engines. However, most ZTE materials have a temperature range less than 1000 K under which they do not expand. In this study, we present a uniaxial ZTE in the low-cost Mn2OBO3 with a thermal expansion coefficient of $\alpha$= -4(1)$\times$10^(-7) K-1 along the X1 principal axis from 3.5 to 1250 K. The monoclinic structure of Mn2OBO3 remains stable over the entire temperature range in ambient conditions. Considerable thermal contraction on the BO3 trigonal planar and thermal expansion on the MnO6 octahedra combine to produce uniaxial ZTE. Temperature-dependent Raman scattering reveals anharmonic low-frequency modes associated with MnO6 Rigid Unit Modes (RUMs), which likely play a critical role in driving thermal contraction in the BO3 trigonal planar. No charge order-disorder transition, which could cause thermal contraction, was observed up to 1250 K.

Title: Designing topology and fractionalization in narrow gap semiconductor films via electrostatic engineering
Authors: Tixuan Tan, Aidan P. Reddy, Liang Fu, Trithep Devakul
Abstract: We show that topological flat minibands can be engineered in a class of narrow gap semiconductor films using only an external electrostatic superlattice potential. We demonstrate that, for realistic material parameters, these bands are capable of hosting correlated topological phases such as integer and fractional quantum anomalous Hall states and composite Fermi liquid phases at zero magnetic field. Our results provide a path towards the realization of fractionalized topological states in a broad range of materials.

Title: Fluctuating hydrodynamics of active particles interacting via taxis and quorum sensing: static and dynamics
Authors: Alberto Dinelli, Jérémy O'Byrne, Julien Tailleur
Abstract: In this article we derive and test the fluctuating hydrodynamic description of active particles interacting via taxis and quorum sensing, both for mono-disperse systems and for mixtures of co-existing species of active particles. We compute the average steady-state density profile in the presence of spatial motility regulation, as well as the structure factor and intermediate scattering function for interacting systems. By comparing our predictions to microscopic numerical simulations, we show that our fluctuating hydrodynamics correctly predicts the large-scale static and dynamical properties of the system. We also discuss how the theory breaks down when structures emerge at scales smaller or comparable to the persistence length of the particles. When the density field is the unique hydrodynamic mode of the system, we show that active Brownian particles, run-and-tumble particles and active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particles, interacting via quorum-sensing or chemotactic interactions, display undistinguishable large-scale properties. This form of universality implies an interesting robustness of the predicted physics but also that large-scale observations of patterns are insufficient to assess their microscopic origins. In particular, our results predict that chemotaxis-induced and motility-induced phase separation should share strong qualitative similarities at the macroscopic scale.

Title: Design of 2D Skyrmionic Metamaterial Through Controlled Assembly
Authors: Qichen Xu, Zhuanglin Shen, Alexander Edström, I. P. Miranda, Zhiwei Lu, Anders Bergman, Danny Thonig, Wanjian Yin, Olle Eriksson, Anna Delin
Abstract: Despite extensive research on magnetic skyrmions and antiskyrmions, a significant challenge remains in crafting nontrivial high-order skyrmionic textures with varying, or even tailor-made, topologies. We address this challenge, by focusing on a construction pathway of skyrmionic metamaterials within a monolayer thin film and suggest several skyrmionic metamaterials that are surprisingly stable, i.e., long-lived, due to a self-stabilization mechanism. This makes these new textures promising for applications. Central to our approach is the concept of 'simulated controlled assembly', in short, a protocol inspired by 'click chemistry' that allows for positioning topological magnetic structures where one likes, and then allowing for energy minimization to elucidate the stability. Utilizing high-throughput atomistic-spin-dynamic simulations alongside state-of-the-art AI-driven tools, we have isolated skyrmions (topological charge Q=1), antiskyrmions (Q=-1), and skyrmionium (Q=0). These entities serve as foundational 'skyrmionic building blocks' to form the here reported intricate textures. In this work, two key contributions are introduced to the field of skyrmionic systems. First, we present a a novel combination of atomistic spin dynamics simulations and controlled assembly protocols for the stabilization and investigation of new topological magnets. Second, using the aforementioned methods we report on the discovery of skyrmionic metamaterials.

Authors: Mathieu Ouellet, Dani S. Bassett, Lee C. Bassett, Kieran A. Murphy, Shubhankar P. Patankar
Abstract: Prions are misfolded proteins that transmit their structural arrangement to neighboring proteins. In biological systems, prion dynamics can produce a variety of complex functional outcomes. Yet, an understanding of prionic causes has been hampered by the fact that few computational models exist that allow for experimental design, hypothesis testing, and control. Here, we identify essential prionic properties and present a biologically inspired model of prions using simple mechanical structures capable of undergoing complex conformational change. We demonstrate the utility of our approach by designing a prototypical mechanical prion and validating its properties experimentally. Our work provides a design framework for harnessing and manipulating prionic properties in natural and artificial systems.

Title: Realization of a Laughlin state of two rapidly rotating fermions
Authors: Philipp Lunt, Paul Hill, Johannes Reiter, Philipp M. Preiss, Maciej Gałka, Selim Jochim
Abstract: We realize a Laughlin state of two rapidly rotating fermionic atoms in an optical tweezer. By utilizing a single atom and spin resolved imaging technique, we sample the Laughlin wavefunction, thereby revealing its distinctive features, including a vortex distribution in the relative motion, correlations in the particles' relative angle, and suppression of the inter-particle interactions. Our work lays the foundation for atom-by-atom assembly of fractional quantum Hall states in rotating atomic gases.

Title: Residual entropy from temperature incremental Monte Carlo method
Authors: Zenan Dai, Xiao Yan Xu
Abstract: Residual entropy, reflecting the degrees of freedom in a system at absolute zero temperature, is important for understanding quantum and classical ground states. Despite its key role in explaining low-temperature phenomena and ground state degeneracy, accurately measuring residual entropy remains a difficult task due to computational challenges. In this Letter, we introduce the Temperature Incremental Monte Carlo (TIMC) method, our new approach to solve these challenges. The TIMC method incrementally calculates the partition function ratio of neighboring temperatures within Monte Carlo simulations, enabling precise entropy calculations and revealing many other temperature-dependent properties in a single computational sweep of temperatures. We have thoroughly tested TIMC on several complex systems, such as the frustrated antiferromagnetic Ising model on both C60 and 2D triangular lattices, the Newman-Moore glassy model, and a 2D quantum transverse field Ising model. Notably, our method overcomes the difficulties encountered in partition function measurements when mapping $d$-dimensional quantum models to $d+1$-dimensional classical counterparts. These difficulties arise from the singular interactions that emerge in the small $\Delta_\tau$ limit during the quantum-to-classical mapping procedure. The TIMC method enables precise entropy calculations across the entire temperature range, as demonstrated in our studies of frustrated spin models, glassy phases, and phases exhibiting spontaneous symmetry breaking. This method's capability in calculating residual entropy could provide new insights when applied to systems lacking analytical solutions.

Title: Room temperature quantum emitters in van der Waals {\alpha}-MoO3
Authors: Jeonghan Lee, Haiyuan Wang, Keun-Yeol Park, Soonsang Huh, Donghan Kim, Mihyang Yu, Changyoung Kim, Kristian Sommer Thygesen, Jieun Lee
Abstract: Quantum emitters in solid-state materials are highly promising building blocks for quantum information processing and communication science. Recently, single-photon emission from van der Waals materials has been reported in transition metal dichalcogenides and hexagonal boron nitride, exhibiting the potential to realize photonic quantum technologies in two-dimensional materials. Here, we report the generation of room temperature single-photon emission from exfoliated and thermally annealed single crystals of van der Waals {\alpha}-MoO3. The second-order correlation function measurement displays a clear photon antibunching, while the luminescence intensity exceeds 0.4 Mcts/s and remains stable under laser excitation. The theoretical calculation suggests that an oxygen vacancy defect is a possible candidate for the observed emitters. Together with photostability and brightness, quantum emitters in {\alpha}-MoO3 provide a new avenue to realize photon-based quantum information science in van der Waals materials.

Title: A minimal model of inelastic tunneling of vibrating magnetic molecules on superconducting substrates
Authors: Athanasios Koliogiorgos, Richard Korytár
Abstract: We present an efficient method of calculating the vibrational spectrum of a magnetic molecule adsorbed on a superconductor, directly related to the first derivative of the tunneling $IV$ curve. The work is motivated by a recent scanning-tunneling spectroscopy of lead phthalocyanine on superconducting Pb(100), showing a wealth of vibrational excitations, the number of which highly exceeds molecular vibrations typically encountered on normal metals. We design a minimal model which represents the inelastic transitions by the spectral function of a frontier orbital of the molecule in isolation. The model allows for an exact solution; otherwise the full correlated superconducting problem would be hard to treat. The model parameters are supplied from an ab-initio calculation, where the presence of the surface on the deformation of molecular geometry can be taken into account. The spectral function of the highest-occupied molecular orbital of the anionic PbPc$^{1-}$ shows the best agreement with the experimental reference among other molecular charge states and orbitals. The method allows to include multiple vibrational transitions straightforwardly.

Title: Giant High-order Nonlinear and Nonreciprocal Electrical Transports Induced by Valley Flipping in Bernal Bilayer Graphene
Authors: Yuelin Shao, Xi Dai
Abstract: We investigate the electrical transport properties of the mini-valley polarized state proposed recently in slightly doped Bernal Bilayer Graphene (BLG) in large electric displacement fields. By minimizing the Hartree-Fock energy functional, we first confirm the appearance of mini-valley polarized phase. At the low carrier doping regime, the 1-pocket state will be stabilized where only one of the trigonal-wrapping-induced Fermi pockets near the atomic-valley center is filled. Then we study the electrical transport of the 1-pocket state by solving the Boltzmann equation. We find that the valley polarization could be easily flopped by an in-plane electrical field, which will lead to hysteresis loop in the direct current (DC) $I-V$ curves. Such irreversible current responses in the DC limit will directly induce strong nonlinear and nonreciprocal alternating current (AC) responses, which has been already observed in the recent experiments on BLG.

Title: Field tuning Kitaev systems for spin fractionalization and topological order
Authors: Jagannath Das, Sarbajaya Kundu, Aman Kumar, Vikram Tripathi
Abstract: The honeycomb Kitaev model describes a $Z_2$ spin liquid with topological order and fractionalized excitations consisting of gapped $\pi$-fluxes and free Majorana fermions. Competing interactions, even when not very strong, are known to destabilize the Kitaev spin liquid. Magnetic fields are a convenient parameter for tuning between different phases of the Kitaev systems, and have even been investigated for potentially counteracting the effects of other destabilizing interactions leading to a revival of the topological phase. Here we review the progress in understanding the effects of magnetic fields on some of the perturbed Kitaev systems, particularly on fractionalization and topological order.

Title: Emergent polar order in non-polar mixtures with non-reciprocal interactions
Authors: Giulia Pisegna, Suropriya Saha, Ramin Golestanian
Abstract: Phenomenological rules that govern the collective behaviour of complex physical systems are powerful tools because they can make concrete predictions about their universality class based on generic considerations, such as symmetries, conservation laws, and dimensionality. While in most cases such considerations are manifestly ingrained in the constituents, novel phenomenology can emerge when composite units associated with emergent symmetries dominate the behaviour of the system. We study a generic class of active matter systems with non-reciprocal interactions and demonstrate the existence of true long-range polar order in two dimensions and above, both at the linear level and by including all relevant nonlinearities in the Renormalization Group sense. We achieve this by uncovering a mapping of our scalar active mixture theory to the Toner-Tu theory of dry polar active matter by employing a suitably defined polar order parameter. We then demonstrate that the complete effective field theory -- which includes all the soft modes and the relevant nonlinear terms -- belongs to the (Burgers-) Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class. This classification allows us to prove the stability of the emergent polar long-range order in scalar non-reciprocal mixtures in two dimensions, and hence a conclusive violation of the Mermin-Wagner theorem.

Title: A Minkowski space embedding to understand Markov models dynamics
Authors: David Andrieux
Abstract: To describe the behavior of Markov models as parameters are varied, I show how to embed the space of Markov models within a Minkowski space. This embedding maintains the inherent distance between different instances of the model. The coordinates of this embedding emerge from the symmetrized Kullback-Leibler divergence and are expressed in terms of thermodynamic quantities, organizing the Minkowski space into equilibrium and nonequilibrium components. With this approach, we can visualize models' behaviors and gain a thermodynamic interpretation of information geometric concepts, even in far-from-equilibrium scenarios. I illustrate this approach using an analytically solvable molecular motor model.

Title: Dirac spin liquid as an "unnecessary" quantum critical point on square lattice antiferromagnets
Authors: Yunchao Zhang, Xue-Yang Song, T. Senthil
Abstract: Quantum spin liquids are exotic phases of quantum matter especially pertinent to many modern condensed matter systems. Dirac spin liquids (DSLs) are a class of gapless quantum spin liquids that do not have a quasi-particle description and are potentially realized in a wide variety of spin $1/2$ magnetic systems on $2d$ lattices. In particular, the DSL in square lattice spin-$1/2$ magnets is described at low energies by $(2+1)d$ quantum electrodynamics with $N_f=4$ flavors of massless Dirac fermions minimally coupled to an emergent $U(1)$ gauge field. The existence of a relevant, symmetry-allowed monopole perturbation renders the DSL on the square lattice intrinsically unstable. We argue that the DSL describes a stable continuous phase transition within the familiar Neel phase (or within the Valence Bond Solid (VBS) phase). In other words, the DSL is an "unnecessary" quantum critical point within a single phase of matter. Our result offers a novel view of the square lattice DSL in that the critical spin liquid can exist within either the Neel or VBS state itself, and does not require leaving these conventional states.

Title: Preparation and readout of Majorana qubits in magnet-superconductor hybrid systems
Authors: Dan Crawford, Roland Wiesendanger, Stephan Rachel
Abstract: Initializing the ground state of a quantum bit (qubit) based on Majorana zero modes is one of the most pressing issues for future topological quantum computers. We explore a protocol for initializing such topological qubits based on magnet-superconductor hybrid networks by coupling magnetic chains to a single molecule magnet. The parity of the Majorana state is converted to the presence or absence of a Yu-Shiba-Rusinov state at the molecule. The coupling can be activated by switching the spin state of the molecule, allowing the ground-state parity of the chain to be controlled. We demonstrate that initialization with either parity for a Majorana qubit can be achieved. We then introduce the augmented Majorana qubit, which includes the state of the molecule in the definition of the logical qubit. Using this definition we can initialize a qubit without high-precision timing.

Title: Toward thermoelectric characterization of (nano)materials by in situ transmission electron microscopy
Authors: Simon Hettler, Mohammad Furqan, Andres Sotelo, Raul Arenal
Abstract: We explore the possibility to perform an in-situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) thermoelectric characterization of materials. A differential heating element on a custom in-situ TEM microchip allows to generate a temperature gradient across the studied materials, which are simultaneously measured electrically. A thermovoltage was induced in all studied devices, whose sign corresponds to the sign of the Seebeck coefficient of the tested materials. The results indicate that in-situ thermoelectric TEM studies can help to profoundly understand fundamental aspects of thermoelectricity, which is exemplary demonstrated by tracking the thermovoltage during in-situ crystallization of an amorphous Ge thin film. We propose an improved in-situ TEM microchip design, which should facilitate a full quantitative measurement of the induced temperature gradient, the electrical and thermal conductivities, as well as the Seebeck coefficient. The benefit of the in-situ approach is the possibility to directly correlate the thermoelectric properties with the structure and chemical composition of the entire studied device down to the atomic level, including grain boundaries, dopants or crystal defects, and to trace its dynamic evolution upon heating or during the application of electrical currents

Title: InAs on Insulator: A New Platform for Cryogenic Hybrid Superconducting Electronics
Authors: Alessandro Paghi, Giacomo Trupiano, Giorgio De Simoni, Omer Arif, Lucia Sorba, Francesco Giazotto
Abstract: Superconducting circuits based on hybrid InAs Josephson Junctions (JJs) play a starring role in the design of fast and ultra-low power consumption solid-state quantum electronics and exploring novel physical phenomena. Conventionally, 3D substrates, 2D quantum wells (QWs), and 1D nanowires (NWs) made of InAs are employed to create superconducting circuits with hybrid JJs. Each platform has its advantages and disadvantages. Here, we proposed the InAs-on-insulator (InAsOI) as a groundbreaking platform for developing superconducting electronics. An epilayer of semiconducting InAs with different electron densities was grown onto an InAlAs metamorphic buffer layer, efficiently used as a cryogenic insulator to decouple adjacent devices electrically. JJs with various lengths and widths were fabricated employing Al as a superconductor and InAs with different electron densities. We achieved a switching current density of 7.3 uA/um, a critical voltage of 50-to-80 uV, and a critical temperature equal to that of the superconductor used. For all the JJs, the switching current follows a characteristic Fraunhofer pattern with an out-of-plane magnetic field. These achievements enable the use of InAsOI to design and fabricate surface-exposed Josephson Field Effect Transistors with high critical current densities and superior gating properties.

Title: Quadrupolar resonance spectroscopy of individual nuclei using a room-temperature quantum sensor
Authors: S. Alex Breitweiser, Mathieu Ouellet, Tzu-Yung Huang, Tim H. Taminiau, Lee C. Bassett
Abstract: Nuclear quadrupolar resonance (NQR) spectroscopy reveals chemical bonding patterns in materials and molecules through the unique coupling between nuclear spins and local fields. However, traditional NQR techniques require macroscopic ensembles of nuclei to yield a detectable signal, which precludes the study of individual molecules and obscures molecule-to-molecule variations due to local perturbations or deformations. Optically active electronic spin qubits, such as the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond, facilitate the detection and control of individual nuclei through their local magnetic couplings. Here, we use NV centers to perform NQR spectroscopy on their associated nitrogen-14 ($^{14}$N) nuclei at room temperature. In mapping the nuclear quadrupolar Hamiltonian, we resolve minute variations between individual nuclei. The measurements further reveal correlations between the parameters in the NV center's electronic spin Hamiltonian and the $^{14}$N quadropolar Hamiltonian, as well as a previously unreported Hamiltonian term that results from symmetry breaking. We further design pulse sequences to initialize, readout, and control the quantum evolution of the $^{14}$N nuclear state using the nuclear quadrupolar Hamiltonian.

Title: Are queries and keys always relevant? A case study on Transformer wave functions
Authors: Riccardo Rende, Luciano Loris Viteritti
Abstract: The dot product attention mechanism, originally designed for natural language processing tasks, is a cornerstone of modern Transformers. It adeptly captures semantic relationships between word pairs in sentences by computing a similarity overlap between queries and keys. In this work, we explore the suitability of Transformers, focusing on their attention mechanisms, in the specific domain of the parametrization of variational wave functions to approximate ground states of quantum many-body spin Hamiltonians. Specifically, we perform numerical simulations on the two-dimensional $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model, a common benchmark in the field of quantum many-body systems on lattice. By comparing the performance of standard attention mechanisms with a simplified version that excludes queries and keys, relying solely on positions, we achieve competitive results while reducing computational cost and parameter usage. Furthermore, through the analysis of the attention maps generated by standard attention mechanisms, we show that the attention weights become effectively input-independent at the end of the optimization. We support the numerical results with analytical calculations, providing physical insights of why queries and keys should be, in principle, omitted from the attention mechanism when studying large systems.

Title: Driven-Dissipative Dynamics of Ultracold Atoms Trapped in an Array of Harmonic Potentials
Authors: Roland Cristopher F. Caballar
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of a gas of ultracold atoms that are trapped in an array of harmonic potentials and that interacts with a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) that acts as a reservoir of Bogoliubov excitations. The ground and excited energy levels of these trapped ultracold atoms are coupled to each other via detuned Raman lasers with corresponding Rabi frequencies. Once excited via the Raman lasers, these trapped ultracold atoms then return to their ground energy levels, but not necessarily to their original trap locations, by emitting Bogoliubov excitations into the BEC. This combination of driving via Raman lasers to excited energy levels and dissipation via interaction with the BEC resulting in emission of Bogoliubov excitations into it will result in the trapped ultracold atoms approaching a steady state, whereby the expectation value of the number of trapped ultracold atoms in each harmonic trap of the array will attain a constant value over time. One can then use this system to prepare states that require a definite number of atoms in a particular energy level, such as BECs and atom lasers used for atom interferometry and for tests of the foundations of quantum mechanics.

Title: Entangelment Entropy on Generalized Brillouin Zone
Authors: Zhenghao Yang, Chaoze Lu, Xiancong Lu
Abstract: We investigate the entanglement properties of non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model from the perspective of the Generalized Brillouin Zone (GBZ). The non-Bloch entanglement entropy is defined on a quasi-reciprocal lattice, obtained by performing an ordinary Fourier transformation on the non-Bloch Hamiltonian. We demonstrate that the broken bulk-boundary correspondence is recovered in terms of the non-Bloch entanglement entropy. When the GBZ is circular, we show that the non-Bloch entanglement entropy is well-defined (real and positive-definite) in large parameter regions, except close to the exceptional points (EPs). In the critical region, we found that each Fermi point contributes precisely 1 to the central charge $c$ of the logarithmic scaling. At the EP, the central charge becomes negative due to the presence of the exceptional bound state. For the case of non-circular GBZ, long-range hopping emerges in the quasi-reciprocal lattice, and the von Neumann entropy on the GBZ is no longer real. However, the non-Bloch edge entanglement entropy remains real, which serves as a reliable topological indicator and respects the bulk-boundary correspondence. We compute the topological phase diagram, and reveal the critical behavior along the exceptional phase boundaries.

Title: Corner Charge Fluctuation as an Observable for Quantum Geometry and Entanglement in Two-dimensional Insulators
Authors: Pok Man Tam, Jonah Herzog-Arbeitman, Jiabin Yu
Abstract: Measuring bipartite fluctuations of a conserved charge, such as the particle number, is a powerful approach to understanding quantum systems. When the measured region has sharp corners, the bipartite fluctuation receives an additional contribution known to exhibit a universal angle-dependence in 2D isotropic and uniform systems. Here we establish that, for generic lattice systems of interacting particles, the corner charge fluctuation is directly related to quantum geometry. We first provide a practical scheme to isolate the corner contribution on lattices, and analytically prove that its angle-dependence in the small-angle limit measures exclusively the integrated quantum metric. A model of a compact obstructed atomic insulator is introduced to illustrate this effect analytically, while numerical verification for various Chern insulator models further demonstrate the experimental relevance of the corner charge fluctuation in a finite-size quantum simulator as a probe of quantum geometry. Last but not least, for free fermions, we unveil an intimate connection between quantum geometry and quantum information through the lens of corner entanglement entropies.

Title: Supersolidity of polariton condensates in photonic crystal waveguides
Authors: Davide Nigro, Dimitrios Trypogeorgos, Antonio Gianfrate, Daniele Sanvitto, Iacopo Carusotto, Dario Gerace
Abstract: Condensation of exciton-polaritons has been recently observed in one-dimensional photonic crystal waveguides, exploiting the interplay of long-lived gap confined eigenmodes and negative mass polariton branches. Here we focus on the theoretical emergence of a second emission threshold, in addition to the one associated with condensation at zero-momentum, due to the nonlinear polariton scattering from the condensate into finite momentum eigenmodes. The physics of this spatially modulated condensate is related to a spontaneous breaking of both phase and translational symmetries simultaneously, bearing strong similarities with the highly sought supersolid phase in Helium and ultracold atomic gases but with a novel mechanism typical of the driven-dissipative scenario. We then propose clear-cut and unequivocal experimental signatures that would allow to identify supersolidity phenomena in polariton condensates

Title: Real-space d-wave superconductivity from weak attraction
Authors: Pavel Kornilovitch
Abstract: It is shown that even a weak out-of-plane attraction, V -> 0, can form real-space pairs in the body-centered tetragonal lattice despite the presence of a Hubbard repulsion and a fully developed three-dimensional kinetic energy. In the hole channel, the pairs have d orbital symmetry which, following Bolgoliubov's argument, translates into a d-symmetric macroscopic superconducting order parameter. The findings help us to understand key features of La_{2-x}Sr_xCuO_4 and further support the real-space mechanism of superconductivity in cuprates. The rules of real-space superconductivity are formulated at the end.

Abstract: This study investigates the critical role of buffer layers in enhancing the efficiency of thin-film CdTe solar cells. We explore non-toxic buffer materials, specifically ZnSe, ZnMgO, 3C-SiC, and WS2, as potential replacements for the traditional Cd-based CdS buffer layer. Our analysis includes a thorough evaluation of the electrical and optical performance of these buffer materials in conjunction with CdTe absorbers. We optimize the thickness of both the buffer and absorber layers to achieve the best performance. Additionally, we examine the impact of defect density variations in the buffer materials and their corresponding temperature effects. Among the tested materials, ZnSe and ZnMgO demonstrate the highest potential, achieving power conversion efficiencies of 20.74% and 20.73%, respectively.

Title: Dirac fermions in the altermagnet Ce4Sb3
Authors: Xue He, Shihao Zhang
Abstract: Altermagnetism exhibits zero net magnetization and spin-splitting electronic structure. The interplay between altermagnetism and topological physics becomes an important topic in the condensed matter physics. In this letter, we propose that the altermagnet Ce4Sb3 hosts Dirac fermions through first-principles calculations and tight-binding model analysis. When subjected to external magnetic field, the altermagnet Ce4Sb3 change from altermagnetic state to ferromagnetic state. Accompanied with magnetic order transition, the four-fold degenerate Dirac points are transited into sextuple degenerate points. Especially, spin-orbital coupling effect has little influence about the Dirac fermions. The topological phases in the altermagnetic state may hold the exotic spin-splitter torque and remarkable nonlinear transport effect. Our work paves the way for exploring the interplay between altermagnetism and non-trivial topological phase.

Title: Many-body localization crossover is sharper in quasiperiodic spin chains
Authors: Pedro R. Nicácio Falcão, Adith Sai Aramthottil, Piotr Sierant, Jakub Zakrzewski
Abstract: Due to a phenomenon of many-body localization (MBL), the strong disorder may significantly slow down or even completely hinder the thermalization of quantum many-body systems. A sufficiently deep quasiperiodic potential may also inhibit thermalization. In this work, we numerically demonstrate direct differences in the behavior of standard ergodicity-breaking indicators at the MBL crossover in random and quasiperiodic systems. Our key finding is the exponential increase in the sharpness of the MBL crossover with system size for quasiperiodic systems, a trend that is only linear in disordered systems. The strong tendency towards a non-analytic behavior in quasiperiodic systems is consistent with the existence of dynamical regimes with sharply defined boundaries or an MBL phase transition. It highlights the importance of quasiperiodic systems for our understanding of many-body dynamics.

Title: Superconductivity of bipolarons from quadratic electron-phonon interaction
Authors: Zhongjin Zhang, Anatoly Kuklov, Nikolay Prokof'ev, Boris Svistunov
Abstract: In systems with linear electron-phonon interaction (EPI), bound states of polarons, or bipolarons, form by gaining energy from the lattice deformation. The quadratic EPI case is fundamentally different: bipolarons form because electrons lose less energy when the total charge density is "compacted". As the coupling constant is increased, the bipolarons first appear as extended (but finite radius) soliton-type states. They subsequently decrease in radius until their size reaches the inter-atomic scale. We present the first numerically exact solution of the bipolaron problem from quadratic EPI in the presence of both on-site Hubbard and long-range Coulomb repulsion, and compute estimates of the largest superconducting transition temperature within the bipolaron mechanism. We find that $T_c/\Omega$ ratios, where $\Omega$ is the optical phonon frequency, can be several times larger than what one may expect from the linear EPI provided the phonon frequency is increased by orders of magnitude on occupied sites. Electron-electron repulsion can be tolerated at the expense of stronger EPI and the most detrimental effect comes from the Coulomb potential because it easily eliminates extended soliton states.

Title: Effects of heating strategies and ballistic transport on the transient thermal conduction in 3D FinFETs
Authors: Chuang Zhang, Ziyang Xin, Qin Lou, Hong Liang
Abstract: Efficiently capturing the three-dimensional spatiotemporal distributions of temperature is of great significance for alleviating hotspot issues in 3D FinFETs. However, most previous thermal simulations mainly focused on the steady-state problem with continuous heating. Few studies are conducted for the transient thermal conduction in 3D FinFETs with non-continuous heating, which is actually closer to the reality. To investigate the effects of heating strategies on the transient micro/nano scale thermal conduction in 3D FinFETs, three heating strategies are considered, including `Continuous', `Intermittent' and `Alternating' heating. A comparison is made between the phonon BTE solutions and the data predicted by the macroscopic diffusion equation, where the effect of boundary scattering on phonon transport is added into the effective thermal conductivity. Numerical results show that it is not easy to accurately capture the heat conduction in 3D FinFETs by the macroscopic diffusion equation, especially near the hotspot areas where ballistic phonon transport dominates and the temperature diffusion is no longer valid. Different heating strategies have great influence on the peak temperature rise and transient thermal dissipation process. Compared to `Intermittent' or `Continuous' heating, the temperature variance of `Alternating' heating is smaller.

Abstract: Emergence of universal collective behaviour from interactions within a sufficiently large group of elementary constituents is a fundamental scientific paradigm. In physics, correlations in fluctuating microscopic observables can provide key information about collective states of matter such as deconfined quark-gluon plasma in heavy-ion collisions or expanding quantum degenerate gases. Mesoscopic colliders, through shot-noise measurements, have provided smoking-gun evidence on the nature of exotic electronic excitations such as fractional charges, levitons and anyon statistics. Yet, bridging the gap between two-particle collisions and the emergence of collectivity as the number of interacting particles increases remains a challenging task at the microscopic level. Here we demonstrate all-body correlations in the partitioning of electron droplets containing up to N = 5 electrons, driven by a moving potential well through a Y-junction in a semiconductor device. Analyzing the partitioning data using high-order multivariate cumulants and finite-size scaling towards the thermodynamic limit reveals distinctive fingerprints of a strongly-correlated Coulomb liquid. These fingerprints agree well with a universal limit where the partitioning of a droplet is predicted by a single collective variable. Our electron-droplet collider provides critical insight into the interplay of confinement and interaction effects in small electron systems and highlights a new way to study engineered states of matter.

Title: Crystal-field magnetostriction of the spin ice under ultrahigh magnetic fields
Authors: Nan Tang, Masaki Gen, Martin Rotter, Huiyuan Man, Kazuyuki Matsuhira, Akira Matsuo, Koichi Kindo, Akihiko Ikeda, Yasuhiro H. Matsuda, Philipp Gegenwart, Satoru Nakatsuji, Yoshimitsu Kohama
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of the magnetoelastic properties of the Ising pyrochlore oxide Ho$_{2}$Ti$_{2}$O$_{7}$, known as spin ice, by means of high-field magnetostriction measurements and numerical calculations. When a magnetic field is applied along the crystallographic <111> axis, the longitudinal magnetostriction exhibits a broad maximum in the low-field regime around 30 T, followed by a dramatic lattice contraction due to crystal-field (CF) level crossing at $B_{\rm cf} \sim 65$ T. The transverse magnetostriction exhibits a contrasting behavior, highlighting the anisotropic nature of the CF striction. We identify distinct timescales of spin dynamics and CF-phonon dynamics by applying a magnetic field with different field-sweep rates. Our mean-field calculations, based on a point-charge model, successfully reproduce the overall magnetostriction behavior, revealing the competition between the exchange striction and CF striction. A signature of the CF level crossing is also observed through adiabatic magnetocaloric-effect measurements, consistent with our magnetostriction data.

Title: Pairing tendencies in the doped Kitaev-Heisenberg model
Authors: Pontus Laurell, Bradraj Pandey, Gábor B. Halász, Satoshi Okamoto, Gonzalo Alvarez, Elbio Dagotto
Abstract: We study the impact of hole-doping on the Kitaev-Heisenberg model on the honeycomb lattice. We investigate the pairing tendencies and correlation functions in the framework of a $t-J-K$ model using density matrix renormalization group calculations on three-leg cylinders. In the case of the pure Kitaev model, which realizes a quantum spin-liquid phase at half-filling, we find that binding of two holes only occurs at low values of the hopping, where the holes are slow. We have theoretically verified that pair formation occurs in the limit of immobile holes, where the pure Kitaev model remains exactly solvable. When we instead fix the hopping at an intermediate, more realistic, value, and vary the Heisenberg and Kitaev interaction strengths, we find pairing tendencies only in the Néel phase. This is in contrast to prior mean-field calculations, highlighting the importance of accounting for the kinetic energy of dopants in generalized Kitaev models. Interestingly, we also find signatures of pair-density wave formation over the studied range of model parameters, namely a periodic modulation of the charge density as well as the spin-spin and pair-pair correlations in real space. Moreover, we present a comparative study of the different correlations as a function of doping. We finally discuss the potential for experimentally observing the studied physics in quantum materials and heterostructures.

Title: Typicality, entropy and the generalization of statistical mechanics
Authors: Bernat Corominas-Murtra, Rudolf Hanel, Petr Jizba
Abstract: When at equilibrium, large-scale systems obey conventional thermodynamics because they belong to microscopic configurations (or states) that are typical. Crucially, the typical states usually represent only a small fraction of the total number of possible states, and yet the characterization of the set of typical states -- the typical set -- alone is sufficient to describe the macroscopic behavior of a given system. Consequently, the concept of typicality, and the associated Asymptotic Equipartition Property allow for a drastic reduction of the degrees of freedom needed for system's statistical description. The mathematical rationale for such a simplification in the description is due to the phenomenon of concentration of measure. The later emerges for equilibrium configurations thanks to very strict constraints on the underlying dynamics, such as weekly interacting and (almost) independent system constituents. The question naturally arises as to whether the concentration of measure and related typicality considerations can be extended and applied to more general complex systems, and if so, what mathematical structure can be expected in the ensuing generalized thermodynamics. In this paper we illustrate the relevance of the concept of typicality in the toy model context of the "thermalized" coin and show how this leads naturally to Shannon entropy. We also show an intriguing connection: The characterization of typical sets in terms of Renyi and Tsallis entropies naturally leads to the free energy and partition function, respectively, and makes their relationship explicit. Finally, we propose potential ways to generalize the concept of typicality to systems where the standard microscopic assumptions do not hold.

Title: Sub-cycle Nanotip Field Emission of Electrons Driven by Air Plasma Generated THz Pulses
Authors: Benjamin Colmey, Rodrigo T. Paulino, Gaspard Beaufort, David G. Cooke
Abstract: Terahertz pulses generated by two-color laser plasmas have reported peak field strengths exceeding MV/cm, and when illuminating metal nanotips the near-field enhancement at the tip apex should result in extremely high bunch charges and electron energies via sub-cycle cold field emission. Here, electron emission from tungsten nanotips driven by THz pulses generated by a long filament air-plasma are reported. Electron energies up to 1.1 keV and bunch charges up to 2x$10^5$ electrons per pulse were detected, well below values expected for peak field calculated via the time averaged Poynting vector. Investigations revealed a failure in the use of the time-averaged Poynting vector when applied to long filament THz pulses, due to spatio-temporal restructuring of the THz pulse in the focus. Accounting for this restructuring significantly reduces the field strength to approximately 160 ~kV/cm, consistent with the observed electron bunch charges, peak energies and their dependence on the tip position in the THz focus. Despite these findings, our results surpass previous THz plasma-driven electron generation by an order of magnitude in both electron energy and bunch charge and a path to increasing these by an additional order of magnitude by modification of the THz optics is proposed.

Title: Correlation stabilized anomalous Hall crystal in bilayer graphene
Authors: Zhongqing Guo, Jianpeng Liu
Abstract: When the charge density is sufficiently low, interacting two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) would undergo a phase transition from homogeneous Fermi liquid to an electronic crystal state, known as Wigner crystal. Besides conventional 2DEG, various topological fermionic excitations may also be realized in 2D materials. For example, ``high-order" Dirac fermions exhibiting nontrivial Berry phases may approximately characterize the low-energy excitations in rhombohedral multilayer graphene (RMG). In this work, we develop a beyond-mean-field theoretical framework to study the interacting ground states and single-particle excitations in slightly charge-doped RMG under vertical electric field. We find that transitions from Fermi liquid to trivial Wigner-crystal states would occur at critical carrier density $\sim 10^{10}\,\textrm{cm}^{-2}$ for all $n$-layer RMG (with $n=2, 3, 4, 5, 6$) which are approximately described by $n$-order Dirac-fermion models. Most saliently, using a more realistic modeling of bilayer graphene including trigonal warping effects, we find that an anomalous Hall crystal state with spontaneous quantized anomalous Hall conductivity would emerge when the carrier density is below $\sim 1\times 10^{11}\,\text{cm}^{-2}$, and it becomes the unique ground state over trivial Wigner crystal when the density is further lower. Counter intuitively, such topological anomalous Hall crystal becomes more stable than the trivial Wigner crystal due to the lower correlation energy gained from dynamical charge fluctuations, which is beyond mean-field description. Our work suggests that slightly carrier-doped bilayer graphene is one of the most promising candidates to realize anomalous Hall crystal. Moreover, the method developed in this work can be readily applied to other interacting 2D systems including moiré superlattices.

Title: Disorder effects in a model of competing superconducting and charge-density wave orders in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$
Authors: Dror Orgad
Abstract: There is evidence for competition between superconductivity and short-range charge-density wave order in a number of cuprate compounds and especially in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$. Here, we use a non-linear sigma model of such competition to study the effects of spatially correlated disorder in the chain layers and delta-correlated disorder in the CuO$_2$ layers. The first is relevant to the oxygen ortho structure and the latter may be induced by electron irradiation. We find that reducing the correlation length of the potential on the chain layers decreases the size of the charge-density wave structure factor but has little effect on its temperature dependence, as observed experimentally. At the same time, the charge-density wave correlation length decreases more than is seen in the experiment. The temperature at which the structure factor peaks coincides with $T_c$ and both decrease when disorder is introduced into the CuO$_2$ planes. Strengthening this disorder reduces the magnitude of the structure factor and eventually turns it into a monotonic function of the temperature. This occurs despite an increase in the local magnitude of the charge-density wave order.

Title: Hammerstein equations for sparse random matrices
Authors: Pawat Akara-pipattana, Oleg Evnin
Abstract: Finding eigenvalue distributions for a number of sparse random matrix ensembles can be reduced to solving nonlinear integral equations of the Hammerstein type. While a systematic mathematical theory of such equations exists, it has not been previously applied to sparse matrix problems. We close this gap in the literature by showing how one can employ numerical solutions of Hammerstein equations to accurately recover the spectra of adjacency matrices and Laplacians of random graphs. While our treatment focuses on random graphs for concreteness, the methodology has broad applications to more general sparse random matrices.

Title: Topological orbital Hall effect caused by skyrmions and antiferromagnetic skyrmions
Authors: Börge Göbel, Lennart Schimpf, Ingrid Mertig
Abstract: The topological Hall effect is a hallmark of topologically non-trivial magnetic textures such as magnetic skyrmions. It quantifies the transverse electric current that is generated once an electric field is applied and occurs as a consequence of the emergent magnetic field of the skyrmion. Likewise, an orbital magnetization is generated. Here we show that the charge currents are orbital polarized even though the conduction electrons couple to the skyrmion texture via their spin. The topological Hall effect is accompanied by a topological orbital Hall effect even for s electrons without spin-orbit coupling. As we show, antiferromagnetic skyrmions and antiferromagnetic bimerons that have a compensated emergent field, exhibit a topological orbital Hall conductivity that is not accompanied by charge transport and can be orders of magnitude larger than the topological spin Hall conductivity. Skyrmionic textures serve as generators of orbital currents that can transport information and give rise to considerable orbital torques.

Title: Thickness dependence of the mechanical properties of piezoelectric high-$Q_m$ nanomechanical resonators made from aluminium nitride
Authors: Anastasiia Ciers, Alexander Jung, Joachim Ciers, Laurentius Radit Nindito, Hannes Pfeifer, Armin Dadgar, Jürgen Bläsing, André Strittmatter, Witlef Wieczorek
Abstract: Nanomechanical resonators with high quality factors (\Qm{}) enable mechanics-based quantum technologies, in particular quantum sensing and quantum transduction. High-\Qm{} nanomechanical resonators in the kHz to MHz frequency range can be realized in tensile-strained thin films that allow the use of dissipation dilution techniques to drastically increase \Qm{}. In our work, we study the material properties of tensile-strained piezoelectric films made from aluminium nitride (AlN). We characterize crystalline AlN films with a thickness ranging from \SI{45}{\nano\meter} to \SI{295}{\nano\meter}, which are directly grown on Si(111) by metal-organic vapour-phase epitaxy. We report on the crystal quality and surface roughness, the piezoelectric response, and the residual and released stress of the AlN thin films. Importantly, we determine the intrinsic quality factor of the films at room temperature in high vacuum. We fabricate and characterize AlN nanomechanical resonators that exploit dissipation dilution to enhance the intrinsic quality factor by utilizing the tensile strain in the film. We find that AlN nanomechanical resonators below \SI{200}{\nano\meter} thickness exhibit the highest \Qf{}-product, on the order of $10^{12}$\,Hz. We discuss possible strategies to optimize the material growth that should lead to devices that reach even higher \Qf{}-products. This will pave the way for future advancements of optoelectromechanical quantum devices made from tensile-strained piezoelectric AlN.

Title: Effect of Biaxial Strain on Cation Octahedral Rotations and Magnetic Structure of the Antiperovskite Mn$_{3}$GaN
Authors: Roman Malyshev, Ingeborg-Helene Svenum, Sverre M. Selbach, Thomas Tybell
Abstract: Density functional theory is used to study the effect of compressive and tensile biaxial strain on Mn$_{3}$GaN. Mn$_{3}$GaN is a non-collinear antiferromagnetic antiperovskite with a similar structure to that of an ideal cubic oxide perovskite, but with cations at the octahedral sites while the anion, nitrogen, is found at the B site. The present study explores the response of Mn$_{3}$GaN to (001) strain, considering biaxial strain levels ranging from -5% to 5%. It is found that the electron structure is insensitive to tensile strain. The study supports previous results in that a spin-canted antiferromagnetic order emerges due to tensile strain, inducing net magnetization. Compressive strain collapses the non-collinear antiferromagnetic spin structure and induces a ferrimagnetic order at -2% strain. Notably, in contrast with oxide perovskites, Mn$_{3}$GaN does not respond to strain by octahedral tilt, but rather by intraband redistributions of charge between Mn $d$ states. Despite the similar structure to oxide perovskites, the bonds between the B site anion and octahedral site cations in Mn$_{3}$GaN bonds are less rigid, such that strain is instead accommodated by a change in bond length rather than a change in bond angles.

Title: In-Situ Manipulation of Superconducting Properties via Ultrasonic Excitation
Authors: Biswajit Dutta, A. Banerjee
Abstract: We demonstrate in-situ manipulation of the critical temperature ($T_S$) and upper critical field ($H_{C2}$) of conventional and unconventional superconductors via ultrasonic excitation. Using an AC susceptibility measurements, we observed a reduction in $T_S$ with increasing amplitude of the applied ultrasonic waves. This reduction exhibits a power law dependence on the excitation voltage, suggesting a non-linear coupling between the ultrasonic waves and the superconducting order parameter. Analogous behavior was observed in cuprate superconductors, hinting at a possible link between the modified superconducting properties and the modulation of the antiferromagnetic network by ultrasonic excitation. Measurements on a paramagnetic material (Gd$_2$O$_3$) with quenched orbital angular momentum (L\,=\,0) revealed no change in magnetization even at extreme ultrasonic excitation amplitudes. This highlights the role of spin-orbit coupling in the observed effects and rules out the possibility of local temperature increases affecting the measurements. To further confirm this, we conducted auxiliary experiments where a Cernox temperature sensor was subjected to ultrasonic excitation, and the resulting temperature difference relative to a reference Cernox was recorded. Simultaneously, the power difference was measured to assess the impact of ultrasonic heating. This analysis revealed that localized heating effects become dominant above an ultrasonic amplitude of 10 V$_{pp}$.

Title: Swelling and evaporation determine surface morphology of grafted hydrogel thin films
Authors: Caroline Kopecz-Muller (ESPCI Paris, IPGG, LOMA), Clémence Gaunand (ESPCI Paris), Yvette Tran (SIMM, SU), Matthieu Labousse (ESPCI Paris), Elie Raphael, Thomas Salez (LOMA), Finn Box (IPGG), Joshua D Mcgraw (IPGG)
Abstract: We experimentally study the formation of surface patterns in grafted hydrogel films of nanometer-to-micrometer thicknesses during imbibition-driven swelling followed by evaporation-driven shrinking. Creases are known to form at the hydrogel surface during swelling; the wavelength of the creasing pattern is proportional to the initial thickness of the hydrogel film with a logarithmic correction that depends on microscopic properties of the hydrogel. We find that, although the characteristic wavelength of the pattern is determined during swelling, the surface morphology can be significantly influenced by evaporation-induced shrinking. We observe that the elastocapillary length based on swollen mechanical properties gives a threshold thickness for a surface pattern formation, and consequently an important change in morphology.

Title: Unveiling the Face-Dependent Ice Growth Kinetics: Insights from Molecular Dynamics on the Basal and Prism Surfaces
Authors: Jihong Shi, Maxwell Fulford, Matteo Salvalaglio, Carla Molteni
Abstract: Ice nucleation and growth are critical in many fields, including atmospheric science, cryobiology, and aviation. However, understanding the detailed mechanisms of ice crystal growth remains challenging. In this work, crystallization at the ice/quasi-liquid layer (QLL) interface of the basal and primary prism (prism1) surfaces of hexagonal ice (Ih) was investigated using molecular dynamics simulations across a wide range of temperatures for the TIP4P/Ice model, with comparisons to the mW coarse-grained model. Together with elucidating the temperature-dependent mechanisms of crystallization, face-specific growth rates were systematically estimated. While the prism surface generally exhibits faster growth rates than the basal surface, a temperature-dependent crossover in growth rates between the basal and prism surfaces is observed in TIP4P/Ice simulations, which correlates with crossovers in QLL thickness and properties and with the well-known column to platelets transition in ice-crystal habits at low vapor pressure. This observation helps decode the complex dependence between crystal morphology and temperature in ice crystals.

Title: Spatiotemporal pattern formation of membranes induced by surface molecular binding/unbinding
Authors: Hiroshi Noguchi
Abstract: Nonequilibrium membrane pattern formation is studied using meshless membrane simulation. We consider that molecules bind to either surface of a bilayer membrane and move to the opposite leaflet by flip--flop. When binding does not modify the membrane properties and the transfer rates among the three states are cyclically symmetric, the membrane exhibits spiral-wave and homogeneous-cycling modes at high and low binding rates, respectively, as in an off-lattice cyclic Potts model. When binding changes the membrane spontaneous curvature, these spatiotemporal dynamics are coupled with microphase separation. When two symmetric membrane surfaces are in thermal equilibrium, the membrane domains form 4.8.8 tiling patterns in addition to stripe and spot patterns. In nonequilibrium conditions, moving biphasic domains and time-irreversible fluctuating patterns appear. The domains move ballistically or diffusively depending on the conditions.

Title: Exploring the properties of quantum scars in a toy model
Authors: Sudip Sinha, S. Sinha
Abstract: We introduce the concept of ergodicity and explore its deviation caused by quantum scars in an isolated quantum system, employing a pedagogical approach based on a toy model. Quantum scars, originally identified as traces of classically unstable orbits in certain wavefunctions of chaotic systems, have recently regained interest for their role in non-ergodic dynamics, as they retain memory of their initial states. We elucidate these features of quantum scars within the same framework of this toy model. The integrable part of the model consists of two large spins, with a classical counterpart, which we combine with a random matrix to induce ergodic behavior. Scarred states can be selectively generated from the integrable spin Hamiltonian by protecting them from the ergodic states using a projector method. Deformed projectors mimic the `quantum leakage' of scarred states, enabling tunable mixing with ergodic states and thereby controlling the degree of scarring. In this simple model, we investigate various properties of quantum scarring and shed light on different aspects of many-body quantum scars observed in more complex quantum systems. Notably, the underlying classicality can be revealed through the entanglement spectrum and the dynamics of `out-of-time-ordered correlators'.

Title: Stripe Antiferromagnetic Ground-State Configuration of FeSe Revealed by Density Functional Theory
Authors: Luke Myers, Nigel Hew, Shun-Li Shang, Zi-Kui Liu
Abstract: The magnetic ground-state configuration of iron selenide FeSe has been a topic of debate, with experimental evidence suggesting the stripe spin fluctuations as predominant at low temperatures, while density functional theory (DFT) calculations using exchange-correlation (XC) functional of the Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA) have historically predicted the antiferromagnetic (AFM) dimer configuration. In this study, we utilize the $\text{r}^{2}\text{SCAN}$ functional, a variant of the Strongly Constrained and Appropriately Normed (SCAN) meta-GGA, to investigate the magnetic configurations of FeSe. It is found that $\text{r}^{2}\text{SCAN}$ predicts a stripe-AFM ground-state configuration with an anti-parallel spin alignment between layers. The energy difference between the parallel and anti-parallel inter-planar spin alignments is approximately 1.7 meV/atom, predicting a significant but previously unreported interlayer spin coupling not yet observed by experiments. The present study underscores the importance of accurate XC functionals, such as $\text{r}^{2}\text{SCAN}$, in predicting the magnetic ground-state configuration of complex materials like FeSe, highlighting its potential to predict magnetic interactions more reliably than traditional GGA functionals by adhering to exact constraints.

Title: Emergence of a Bandgap in Nano-Scale Graphite: A Computational and Experimental Study

Abstract: Bandgaps in layered materials are critical for enabling functionalities such as tunable photodetection, efficient energy conversion, and nonlinear optical responses, which are essential for next-generation photonic and quantum devices. Gap engineering could form heterostructures with complementary materials like transition metal dichalcogenides or perovskites for multi-functional devices. Graphite, conventionally regarded as a gapless material, exhibits a bandgap of ~100 meV in nano-scale patterned highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG), as revealed by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and Raman measurements. Our state-of-the-art calculations, incorporating photoemission matrix element effects, predict this bandgap with remarkable accuracy and attribute it to mechanical distortions introduced during patterning. This work bridges theory and experiment, providing the direct evidence of a tunable bandgap in HOPG. Beyond its fundamental significance, this finding opens new possibilities for designing materials with tailored electronic properties, enabling advancements in terahertz devices and optoelectronics.

Title: $\mu$SR evidence of a marked exchange interaction effect on the local spin dynamics of Tb-based molecular nanomagnets
Authors: Muhammad Maikudi Isah, Lorenzo Sorace, Alessandro Lascialfari, Paolo Arosio, Zaher Salman, André Moreira Nogueira, Giordano Poneti, Manuel Mariani, Samuele Sanna
Abstract: We report on the spin dynamics of two Terbium-based molecular nanomagnets, Tb-SQ and Tb-Trp, investigated by means of longitudinal muon spin relaxation ($\mu$SR) measurements as a function of applied field, flanked by AC susceptibility characterization. In the two molecules Tb(III) magnetic ion has an isotructural coordination sphere, but in the former the Tb(III) is coordinated by an organic paramagnetic ligand (SQ), while the latter is coordinated by a diamagnetic one (Trp). Thus Tb-SQ presents an exchange interaction between the Tb(III) ion and a radical while Tb-Trp does not. Both the samples exhibit a muon spin-lattice relaxation rate $\lambda_1(T, B_L)$ peak in the temperature range 10-25 K at all applied longitudinal magnetic fields $B_L = 50, 150, 300$ mT. In Tb-SQ, $\lambda_1(T, B_L)$ displays a BPP-like behavior led by three different correlations times: the first, dominating for $T\geq15K$, follows a thermally activated law $\tau_c =\tau_0 \exp(\sigma_A / k_B T)$ with energy barrier $\sigma_A/k_B$, while the second and third ones, dominating respectively for $8<T<15$ K and $T<8$ K, follow a power-law-like behavior $\tau_c = c_0 T^{-\alpha}$ with two different values of $c_0$ and $\alpha$. On the other hand, the temperature and field behavior of $\lambda_1(T, B_L)$ in Tb-Trp strongly deviates from a BPP law, displaying a strongly anomalous character. Our results indicate that, in the absence of an exchange interaction and maintaining all the other relevant interactions constants, the local spin dynamics of single ion magnets strongly differ from the one observed in the presence of such interaction. The combination of $\mu$SR and AC susceptibility allows us to disentangle the different Orbach, Raman and direct mechanisms which are the key ingredients that control the spin dynamics in Tb-SQ, and evidence the potentiality of $\mu$SR in elucidating complex spin dynamics.

Title: LPCVD Grown Si-Doped $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ Films with Promising Electron Mobilities
Authors: Saleh Ahmed Khan, Ahmed Ibreljic, Stephen Margiotta, A F M Anhar Uddin Bhuiyan
Abstract: We systematically investigated the growth of Si-doped $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ films using LPCVD system, achieving high electron mobilities of 162 cm$^2$/V.s and 149 cm$^2$/V.s at carrier concentrations of $1.51 \times 10^{17}$ cm$^{-3}$ and $1.15 \times 10^{17}$ cm$^{-3}$, respectively, for homoepitaxial (010) $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ films grown on $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ substrates and heteroepitaxial (-201) $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ films grown on off-axis c-sapphire substrates with 6° miscut, representing the highest mobilities reported for LPCVD-grown $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ materials. Carrier concentrations were precisely tuned by varying SiCl$_4$ flow rates at a growth temperature of 1000°C, resulting in concentrations ranging from $1.15 \times 10^{17}$ to $1.19 \times 10^{19}$ cm$^{-3}$, as confirmed by both Hall and C-V measurements. The films exhibited high crystalline quality, confirmed by high-resolution XRD and Raman spectroscopy, indicating phase purity and structural integrity. Surface morphologies characterized by FESEM and AFM imaging showed a strong correlation between carrier concentrations and surface smoothness, with lower concentrations resulting in reduced RMS roughness. SIMS analysis revealed uniform Si incorporation, with low carbon, hydrogen, and chlorine impurities below detection limits, indicating high purity of the films. A high low-temperature peak mobility exceeding 843 cm$^2$/V$\cdot$s was achieved for (-201) $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ films at 80 K, highlighting the high purity and low compensation of these films. These findings emphasize the potential of LPCVD growth system for producing high-purity $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ films with thickness ranging between ~2.3-11.7 $\mu$m and faster growth rates (~4.7-17 $\mu$m/hr), promising transport properties, controllable doping, and scalability for developing high power vertical devices.

Title: Electronic Structure, mass fluctuation, and Localized Bond Properties of two-dimensional double-layer transition metal chalcogenide MX$_2$ (M = Mo, W; X = S, Se, Te) Calculated Based on Density Functional Theory and BBC model
Authors: Yaorui Tan, Maolin Bo
Abstract: This study systematically investigates the electronic structure and bonding properties of two-dimensional bilayer transition metal chalcogenides MX$_2$ (M = Mo, W; X = S, Se, Te) using density functional theory calculations. Through the analysis of band gaps, deformation bond energies, and non-Hermitian bonding characteristics of various MX$_2$ compounds, the electronic properties and chemical bonding features are comprehensively examined. The findings demonstrate that charge transfer plays a critical role in electron mass fluctuation, with the incorporation of topological geometric analysis confirming the influence of mass changes on atomic bonding and electronic states. Furthermore, Heterojunctions between distinct atomic layers are shown to effectively modulate the band gap of two-dimensional bilayer transition metal chalcogenides. This work establishes a theoretical foundation for advancing the application of these materials.

Title: Thermodynamic favourability of 1T phase over 1H phase in group III metal monochalcogenide zigzag nanoribbons
Authors: Emin Aliyev, Arash Mobaraki, Hâldun Sevinçli, Seymur Jahangirov
Abstract: Owing to the promising optoelectric and thermoelectric properties of two-dimensional (2D) group III-VI materials (MXs), their nanoribbons (NRs) have attracted notable attention as an emerging class of quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) nanostructures. Due to the fact that the most stable 2D monolayer polymorph of MXs is the 1H phase, to date, existing studies in the literature have predominantly focused on the NRs formed from 1H phase MXs. Nevertheless, NRs of the 1T phase have received little to no attention. Employing ab initio simulations based on density functional theory, we systematically compared the thermodynamic stability of hydrogen passivated and unpassivated 1T and 1H ZNRs of GaS, GaSe, and InSe. Our results reveal that 1T phase MX ZNRs are thermodynamically favorable at widths up to 34 nm, a range that is realizable through contemporary experimental fabrication techniques. Furthermore, unlike metallic 1H ZNRs, 1T ZNRs remain semiconductor and retain a Mexican-hat-shaped top valence band without any built-in potential between the edges. Complementarily, hydrogenation energies of 1T InSe ZNRs are positive, and due to the edge-localized states, the 1T unpassivated ZNRs possess nearly flat top valence bands. Our findings serve as a compass for subsequent synthesis pathways of group III-VI NRs.

Title: Study the quantum resolution sizes and atomic bonding states of two-dimensional tin monoxide
Authors: Yu Wang, Yunhu Zhu, Yixin Li, Maolin Bo
Abstract: Understanding the interatomic bonding and electronic properties of two-dimensional (2D) materials is crucial for preparing high-performance 2D semiconductor materials. We have calculated the band structure, electronic properties, and bonding characteristics of SnO in 2D materials by using density functional theory (DFT) and combining bond energy and bond charge models. Atomic bonding analysis enables us to deeply and meticulously analyze the interatomic bonding and charge transfer in the layered structure of SnO. This study greatly enhances our understanding of the local bonding state on the surface of 2D structural materials. In addition, we use the renormalization method to operate energy to determine the wave function at different quantum resolutions. This is of great significance for describing the size and phase transition of nanomaterials.

Title: Maximum power Stirling-like heat engine with a harmonically confined Brownian particle
Authors: Irene Prieto-Rodríguez, Antonio Prados, Carlos A. Plata
Abstract: Heat engines transform thermal energy into useful work, operating in a cyclic manner. For centuries, they have played a key role in industrial and technological development. Historically, only gases and liquids have been used as working substances, but the technical advances achieved over the past decades allow for expanding the experimental possibilities and designing engines operating with a single particle. In this case, the system of interest cannot be addressed at a macroscopic level and their study is framed in the field of stochastic thermodynamics. In the present work, we study mesoscopic heat engines built with a Brownian particle submitted to harmonic confinement and immersed in a fluid acting as a thermal bath. We design a Stirling-like heat engine, composed of two isothermal and two isochoric branches, by controlling both the stiffness of the harmonic trap and the temperature of the bath. Specifically, we focus on the irreversible, non quasi-static, case -- whose finite duration enables the engine to deliver a non-zero output power. This is a crucial aspect, which enables the optimisation of the thermodynamic cycle by maximising the delivered power -- thereby addressing a key goal at the practical level. The optimal driving protocols are obtained by using both variational calculus and optimal control theory tools. Also, we numerically explore the dependence of the maximum output power and the corresponding efficiency on the system parameters.

Title: Quantized Hall conductivity in monolayer 1T^{\prime}-MoS_2
Authors: Mohammad Mortezaei Nobahari, Mahmood Rezaei Roknabadi
Abstract: 1T$^{\prime}$ phase of the monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides has recently attracted attention for its potential in nanoelectronic applications. This study proves the topological behavior of this material using spin texture, Berry curvature, and Hall conductivity using linear response theory. The spin texture in momentum space reveals a helical spin configuration with spin-momentum locking. Berry curvature distributions around the Dirac points highlight the influence of $\alpha$ parameter demonstrating a topological phase transition in 1T$^\prime$-MoS$_2$. For $\alpha<1$ the spin-resolved Hall conductivity dominates, corresponding to a quantum spin Hall insulator (QSHI) phase, while for $\alpha>1$, valley-resolved Hall conductivity prevails, indicating a transition to a band insulator (BI) phase. Further analysis explores the spin-valley-resolved Hall conductivity and Chern numbers across varying values of $\alpha$, $V$, and Fermi energy, uncovering regions of trivial topological phases (TTP) and the role of the edge modes. Finally, the Nernst coefficients (spin, valley, and total) are investigated at room temperature, revealing significant spin and valley-dependent transport properties. The zero total Nernst coefficient across energy ranges suggests strong cancellation between spin and valley contributions, providing insights into the material's potential for thermoelectric applications and spintronic devices

Title: Unraveling the temperature-dependent spin-polarized electron transport in iron via spin-wave Doppler shift
Authors: José Solano, Quentin Rossi, Jerome Robert, Marc Lenertz, Yves Henry, Benoit Gobaut, David Halley, Mattieu Bailleul
Abstract: An electric current flowing in a ferromagnetic metal carries spin angular momentum, i.e. it is spin-polarized. Here, we measure the spin-wave Doppler shift induced by the transfer of angular momentum from the diffusive spin-polarized electric current onto coherent spin waves in epitaxial MgO/Fe/MgO thin films. We follow this Doppler shift as function of the temperature and determine that the degree of spin-polarization of the current increases from 77$\%$ to 86$\%$ when cooling the device from 303K down to 10K. Interpreting these measurements within the two-current model, we separate the contributions from electron-surface, electron-phonon and electron-magnon scatterings to the spin-dependent resistivity of Fe.

Title: Striped Spin Density Wave in a Graphene/Black Phosphorous Heterostructure
Authors: Dolev Haddad, H.A. Fertig, Efrat Shimshoni
Abstract: A bilayer formed by stacking two distinct materials creates a moiré lattice, which can serve as a platform for novel electronic phases. In this work we study a unique example of such a system: the graphene-black phosphorus heterostructure (G/BP), which has been suggested to have an intricate band structure. Most notably, the valence band hosts a quasi-one-dimensional region in the Brillouin zone of high density of states, suggesting that various many-body electronic phases are likely to emerge. We derive an effective tight-binding model that reproduces this band structure, and explore the emergent broken-symmetry phases when interactions are introduced. Employing a mean-field analysis, we find that the favored ground-state exhibits a striped spin density wave (SDW) order, characterized by either one of two-fold degenerate wave-vectors that are tunable by gating. Further exploring the phase-diagram controlled by gate voltage and the interaction strength, we find that the SDW-ordered state undergoes a metal to insulator transition via an intermediate metallic phase which supports striped SDW correlations. Possible experimental signatures are discussed, in particular a highly anisotropic dispersion of the collective excitations which should be manifested in electric and thermal transport.

Title: Generalized Onsager's Relation in Magnon Hall Effect and Its Implication
Authors: Jikun Zhou, Yang Gao, Qian Niu
Abstract: By analyzing the spin-group symmetry of magnons, we establish two generalized Onsager's relations in the magnon Hall effect, which reveals the rich and complicated structures of the magnon Berry curvature in the parameter space of different types of the exchange coupling. As an important consequence, we find that the isotropic exchange coupling is equally important as the DzyaloshinskiiMoriya (DM) interaction in determining the magnon Hall effect, and it can transform to the latter under proper gauge transformation. Moreover, the diagonal and off-diagonal part of the symmetric anisotropic exchange coupling together can support the magnon Hall effect without the DM interaction. Both features are exemplified in ferromagnetic honeycomb lattices. Our work lays the ground for decoding the coupling between magnon transport and different types of exchange interactions.

Title: Time-reversal symmetry breaking fractional quantum spin Hall insulator in moir\'e MoTe2
Authors: Kaifei Kang, Yichen Qiu, Bowen Shen, Kihong Lee, Zhengchao Xia, Yihang Zeng, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Jie Shan, Kin Fai Mak
Abstract: Twisted bilayer transition metal dichalcogenide semiconductors, which support flat Chern bands with enhanced interaction effects, realize a platform for fractional Chern insulators and fractional quantum spin Hall (FQSH) insulators. A recent experiment has reported the emergence of a FQSH insulator protected by spin-Sz conservation at a moiré lattice filling factor {\nu}=3 in 2.1-degree twisted bilayer MoTe2. Theoretical studies have proposed both time-reversal symmetric and asymmetric ground states as possible candidates for the observed FQSH insulator, but the nature of the state remains unexplored. Here we report the observation of spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking at generic fillings in 2.1-degree twisted bilayer MoTe2 from {\nu}<1 all the way to {\nu}>6 except at {\nu}=2, 4, and 6. Although zero Hall response is observed at {\nu}=3 for magnetic fields higher than 20 mT, a finite anomalous Hall response accompanied by a magnetic hysteresis is observed at lower magnetic fields, demonstrating spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking. Our work shows the tendency towards ferromagnetism by doping the first three pairs of conjugate Chern bands in the material; it also sheds light on the nature of the FQSH insulator at {\nu}=3.

Title: Learning by Confusion: The Phase Diagram of the Holstein Model
Authors: George Issa, Owen Bradley, Ehsan Khatami, Richard Scalettar
Abstract: We employ the "learning by confusion" technique, an unsupervised machine learning approach for detecting phase transitions, to analyze quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the two-dimensional Holstein model--a fundamental model for electron-phonon interactions on a lattice. Utilizing a convolutional neural network, we conduct a series of binary classification tasks to identify Holstein critical points based on the neural network's learning accuracy. We further evaluate the effectiveness of various training datasets, including snapshots of phonon fields and other measurements resolved in imaginary time, for predicting distinct phase transitions and crossovers. Our results culminate in the construction of the finite-temperature phase diagram of the Holstein model.

Title: Direct measurement of the longitudinal exciton dispersion in hBN by resonant inelastic x-ray scattering
Authors: Alessandro Nicolaou, Kari Ruotsalainen, Laura Susana, Victor Porée, Luiz Galvao Tizei, Jaakko Koskelo, Takashi Taniguchi, Kenji Watanabe, Alberto Zobelli, Matteo Gatti
Abstract: We report resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) measurements on the prototypical hexagonal boron nitride hBN layered compound. The RIXS results at the B and N K edges have been combined with electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) experiments and ab initio calculations within the framework of the Bethe-Salpeter equation of many-body perturbation theory. By means of this tight interplay of different spectroscopies, the lowest longitudinal exciton of hBN has been identified. Moreover, its qualitatively different dispersions along the $\Gamma$K and the $\Gamma$M directions of the Brillouin zone have been determined. Our study advocates soft X-ray RIXS and EELS to be a promising combination to investigate electronic excitations in materials.

Title: Charge transport limited by nonlocal electron-phonon interaction. I. Hierarchical equations of motion approach
Authors: Veljko Janković
Abstract: Studying charge transport in models with nonlocal carrier-phonon interaction is difficult because it requires finite-temperature real-time correlation functions of mixed carrier-phonon operators. Focusing on models with discrete undamped phonon modes, we show that such correlation functions can be retrieved from the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM), although phonons have been integrated out. Our procedure relies on the explicit expression of HEOM auxiliaries in terms of phonon creation and annihilation operators. It reveals that the auxiliaries describe multiphonon-assisted carrier transitions induced by genuine many-phonon correlations, from which lower-order correlations are subtracted according to the finite-temperature Wick's theorem. Applying the procedure to our recently developed momentum-space HEOM method featuring a specific hierarchy closing, we compute the numerically exact dynamical mobility of a carrier within the one-dimensional Peierls model. The carrier mobility at moderate temperatures decreases with increasing interaction, whereas high temperatures see the opposite trend, reflecting the prevalence of the phonon-assisted current over the purely electronic band current. The pronounced finite-size effects and HEOM instabilities delimit the range of applicability of our approach to moderate interactions, moderate to high temperatures, and not too fast phonons. Importantly, this range comprises the values relevant for charge transport in crystalline organic semiconductors, and we present and discuss the corresponding numerically exact results in a companion paper (arXiv:2501.05055).

Title: Charge transport limited by nonlocal electron-phonon interaction. II. Numerically exact quantum dynamics in the slow-phonon regime
Authors: Veljko Janković
Abstract: Transport of charge carriers in mechanically soft semiconductors is mainly limited by their interaction with slow intermolecular phonons. Carrier motion exhibits a crossover from superdiffusive to subdiffusive, producing a distinct low-frequency peak in the dynamical-mobility profile. These features can be understood within approaches relying on the timescale separation between carrier and phonon dynamics, such as the transient localization scenario (TLS). However, recovering them from fully quantum dynamics has proved elusive. Using the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM)-based approach exposed in a companion paper (arXiv:2501.05054), we study carrier transport in the one-dimensional Peierls model near the adiabatic limit. We find that the TLS approximates HEOM dynamics very well at higher temperatures and for stronger interactions. Then, the transport is predominantly phonon-assisted, and turns diffusive from the subdiffusive side well before one phonon period. In contrast, the band current dominates at moderate temperatures and interactions, relevant for transport in realistic materials. We then conclude that the super-to-subdiffusive crossover is transient, so that the diffusive motion sets in from the superdiffusive side after a couple of phonon periods. The low-frequency dynamical mobility then additionally exhibits a dip at approximately one phonon frequency, and the zero-frequency peak. Our findings in this moderate regime show limitations of the TLS, and support the results of the most advanced quantum-classical simulations. We expect that the qualitative differences between HEOM and TLS dynamics would diminish for a more realistic phonon density of states.

Title: A Thermodynamic Theory of Proximity Ferroelectricity
Authors: Eugene A. Eliseev, Anna N. Morozovska, Jon-Paul Maria, Long-Qing Chen, Venkatraman Gopalan
Abstract: Proximity ferroelectricity has recently been reported as a new design paradigm for inducing ferroelectricity, where a non-ferroelectric polar material becomes a ferroelectric by interfacing with a thin ferroelectric layer. Strongly polar materials, such as AlN and ZnO, which were previously unswitchable with an external field below their dielectric breakdown fields, can now be switched with practical coercive fields when they are in intimate proximity to a switchable ferroelectric. Here, we develop a general Landau-Ginzburg theory of proximity ferroelectricity in multilayers of non-ferroelectrics and ferroelectrics to analyze their switchability and coercive fields. The theory predicts regimes of both "proximity switching" where the multilayers collectively switch, as well as "proximity suppression" where they collectively do not switch. The mechanism of the proximity ferroelectricity is an internal electric field determined by the polarization of the layers and their relative thickness in a self-consistent manner that renormalizes the double-well ferroelectric potential to lower the steepness of the switching barrier. Further reduction in the coercive field emerges from charged defects in the bulk that act as nucleation centers. The application of the theory to proximity ferroelectricity in Alx-1ScxN/AlN and Zn1-xMgxO/ZnO bilayers is demonstrated. The theory further predicts that multilayers of dielectric/ferroelectric and paraelectric/ferroelectric layers can potentially result in induced ferroelectricity in the dielectric or paraelectric layers, resulting in the entire stack being switched, an exciting avenue for new discoveries. This thawing of "frozen ferroelectrics", paraelectrics and potentially dielectrics, promises a large class of new ferroelectrics with exciting prospects for previously unrealizable domain-patterned optoelectronic and memory technologies.

Title: Boundary states of a bulk gapped ground state in $2$-d quantum spin systems
Authors: Yoshiko Ogata
Abstract: We introduce a natural mathematical definition of boundary states of a bulk gapped ground state, in the operator algebraic framework of $2$-d quantum spin systems. With approximate Haag duality at the boundary, we derive a $C^*$-tensor category $\tilde{\mathcal{M}}$ out of such boundary state. Under a non-triviality condition of the braiding in the bulk, we show that the Drinfeld center (with an asymptotic constraint) of $\tilde{\mathcal{M}}$ is equivalent to the bulk braided $C^*$-tensor category derived in [14].

Title: Macroproperties vs. Microstates in the Classical Simulation of Critical Phenomena in Quench Dynamics of 1D Ising Models
Authors: Anupam Mitra, Tameem Albash, Philip Daniel Blocher, Jun Takahashi, Akimasa Miyake, Grant W. Biedermann, Ivan H. Deutsch
Abstract: We study the tractability of classically simulating critical phenomena in the quench dynamics of one-dimensional transverse field Ising models (TFIMs) using highly truncated matrix product states (MPS). We focus on two paradigmatic examples: a dynamical quantum phase transition (DQPT) that occurs in nonintegrable long-range TFIMs, and the infinite-time correlation length of the integrable nearest-neighbor TFIM when quenched to the critical point. For the DQPT, we show that the order parameters can be efficiently simulated with surprisingly heavy truncation of the MPS bond dimension. This can be used to reliably extract critical properties of the phase transition, including critical exponents, even when the full many-body state is not simulated with high fidelity. The long-time correlation length near the critical point is more sensitive to the full many-body state fidelity, and generally requires a large bond dimension MPS. Nonetheless, we find that this can still be efficiently simulated with strongly truncated MPS because it can be extracted from the short-time behavior of the dynamics where entanglement is low. Our results demonstrate that while accurate calculation of the full many-body state (microstate) is typically intractable due to the volume-law growth of entanglement, a precise specification of an exact microstate may not be required when simulating phases of matter of many-body systems (macrostates). We also study the tractability of simulation using truncated MPS based on quantum chaos and equilibration in the models. We find a counterintuitive inverse relationship, whereby local expectation values are most easily approximated for chaotic systems whose exact many-body state is most intractable.

Title: Beyond the Power Law: Estimation, Goodness-of-Fit, and a Semiparametric Extension in Complex Networks
Authors: Nixon Jerez-Lillo, Francisco A. Rodrigues, Paulo H. Ferreira, Pedro L. Ramos
Abstract: Scale-free networks play a fundamental role in the study of complex networks and various applied fields due to their ability to model a wide range of real-world systems. A key characteristic of these networks is their degree distribution, which often follows a power-law distribution, where the probability mass function is proportional to $x^{-\alpha}$, with $\alpha$ typically ranging between $2 < \alpha < 3$. In this paper, we introduce Bayesian inference methods to obtain more accurate estimates than those obtained using traditional methods, which often yield biased estimates, and precise credible intervals. Through a simulation study, we demonstrate that our approach provides nearly unbiased estimates for the scaling parameter, enhancing the reliability of inferences. We also evaluate new goodness-of-fit tests to improve the effectiveness of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, commonly used for this purpose. Our findings show that the Watson test offers superior power while maintaining a controlled type I error rate, enabling us to better determine whether data adheres to a power-law distribution. Finally, we propose a piecewise extension of this model to provide greater flexibility, evaluating the estimation and its goodness-of-fit features as well. In the complex networks field, this extension allows us to model the full degree distribution, instead of just focusing on the tail, as is commonly done. We demonstrate the utility of these novel methods through applications to two real-world datasets, showcasing their practical relevance and potential to advance the analysis of power-law behavior.

Title: Coexistence of uniform and oscillatory states resulting from nonreciprocity and conservation laws
Authors: Daniel Greve, Giorgio Lovato, Tobias Frohoff-Hülsmann, Uwe Thiele
Abstract: Employing a two-species Cahn-Hilliard model with nonreciprocal interactions we show that the interplay of nonreciprocity and conservation laws results in the robust coexistence of uniform stationary and oscillatory phases as well as of uniform and crystalline phases. For nonequilibrium models with a spurious gradient dynamics structure such coexistencies between two or more nonequilibrium phases and resulting phase diagrams can nevertheless be predicted by a Maxwell double-tangent construction. This includes phases with sustained regular or irregular out-of-equilibrium dynamics as further corroborated by bifurcation studies and time simulations.

Title: Mean field coupled dynamical systems: Bifurcations and phase transitions
Authors: Wael Bahsoun, Carlangelo Liverani
Abstract: We develop a bifurcation theory for infinite dimensional systems satisfying abstract hypotheses that are tailored for applications to mean field coupled chaotic maps. Our abstract theory can be applied to many cases, from globally coupled expanding maps to globally coupled Axiom A diffeomorphisms. To illustrate the range of applicability, we analyze an explicit example consisting of globally coupled Anosov diffeomorphisms. For such an example, we classify all the invariant measures as the coupling strength varies; we show which invariant measures are physical, and we prove that the existence of multiple invariant physical measures is a purely infinite dimensional phenomenon, i.e., the model exhibits phase transitions in the sense of statistical mechanics.

Title: Automation of Quantum Dot Measurement Analysis via Explainable Machine Learning
Authors: Daniel Schug, Tyler J. Kovach, M. A. Wolfe, Jared Benson, Sanghyeok Park, J. P. Dodson, J. Corrigan, M. A. Eriksson, Justyna P. Zwolak
Abstract: The rapid development of quantum dot (QD) devices for quantum computing has necessitated more efficient and automated methods for device characterization and tuning. This work demonstrates the feasibility and advantages of applying explainable machine learning techniques to the analysis of quantum dot measurements, paving the way for further advances in automated and transparent QD device tuning. Many of the measurements acquired during the tuning process come in the form of images that need to be properly analyzed to guide the subsequent tuning steps. By design, features present in such images capture certain behaviors or states of the measured QD devices. When considered carefully, such features can aid the control and calibration of QD devices. An important example of such images are so-called $\textit{triangle plots}$, which visually represent current flow and reveal characteristics important for QD device calibration. While image-based classification tools, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), can be used to verify whether a given measurement is $\textit{good}$ and thus warrants the initiation of the next phase of tuning, they do not provide any insights into how the device should be adjusted in the case of $\textit{bad}$ images. This is because CNNs sacrifice prediction and model intelligibility for high accuracy. To ameliorate this trade-off, a recent study introduced an image vectorization approach that relies on the Gabor wavelet transform (Schug $\textit{et al.}$ 2024 $\textit{Proc. XAI4Sci: Explainable Machine Learning for Sciences Workshop (AAAI 2024) (Vancouver, Canada)}$ pp 1-6). Here we propose an alternative vectorization method that involves mathematical modeling of synthetic triangles to mimic the experimental data. Using explainable boosting machines, we show that this new method offers superior explainability of model prediction without sacrificing accuracy.

Title: Minimal Autocorrelation in Hybrid Monte Carlo simulations using Exact Fourier Acceleration
Authors: Johann Ostmeyer, Pavel Buividovich
Abstract: The hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm is a ubiquitous method in computational physics with applications ranging from condensed matter to lattice QCD and beyond. However, HMC simulations often suffer from long autocorrelation times, severely reducing their efficiency. In this work two of the main sources of autocorrelations are identified and eliminated. The first source is the sampling of the canonical momenta from a sub-optimal normal distribution, the second is a badly chosen trajectory length. Analytic solutions to both problems are presented and implemented in the exact Fourier acceleration (EFA) method. It completely removes autocorrelations for near-harmonic potentials and consistently yields (close-to-) optimal results for numerical simulations of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger and the Ising models as well as in lattice gauge theory, in some cases reducing the autocorrelation by multiple orders of magnitude. EFA is advantageous for and easily applicable to any HMC simulation of an action that includes a quadratic part.

Title: Exact lattice bosonization of finite N matrix quantum mechanics and c = 1
Authors: Gautam Mandal, Ajay Mohan
Abstract: We describe a new exact lattice bosonization of matrix quantum mechanics (equivalently of non-relativistic fermions) that is valid for arbitrary rank N of the matrix, based on an exact operator bosonization introduced earlier in [1]. The trace identities are automatically incorporated in this formalism. The finite number N of fermions is reflected in the finite number N of bosonic oscillators, or equivalently to the finite number N of lattice points. The fermion Hamiltonian is exactly mappable to a bosonic Hamiltonian. At large N, the latter becomes local and corresponds to the lattice version of a relativistic boson Hamiltonian, with a lattice spacing of order 1/N. The finite lattice spacing leads to a finite entanglement entropy (EE) of the bosonic theory, which reproduces the finite EE of the fermionic theory. Such a description is not available in the standard bosonization in terms of fermion density fluctuations on the Fermi surface, which does not have a built-in short distance cut-off (see, however, [2]). The bosonic lattice is equipped with a geometry determined by the matrix potential or equivalently by the shape of the Fermi surface. Our bosonization also works in the double scaled c=1 model, where the bosonic EE again turns out to be finite, with the short distance cut-off turning as g_s l_s, and reproduces the matrix result. Once again, such a short distance cut-off cannot appear in the conventional dual of c=1 in terms of the 2D string ``tachyon'', where the expected short distance scale is l_s. This indicates our bosonization as a possibly different dual description to the c=1 matrix model appropriate for ``local physics'' like quantum entanglement, by contrast with the conventional duality to the eigenvalue density which works well for asymptotic observables like S-matrices. We briefly discuss possible relation of our bosonization to D0 branes.

Title: Laser-scanning of induction-melted Al alloys: are they representative of additively manufactured ones?
Authors: Zhaoxuan Ge, Sebastian Calderon, S. Mohadeseh Taheri-Mousavi
Abstract: The bottleneck of alloy design for powder-based additive manufacturing (AM) resides in customized powder production - an expensive and time-consuming process hindering the rapid closed-loop design iterations. This study analyzed an expedited experimental workflow, i.e., multipath laser scanning of induction-melted samples, to mimic rapid solidification of AM to serve as an alternative approach to down-select from the design space. Using Al-Ni-Zr-Er model alloy, comprehensive multi-scale characterizations were performed to compare microstructural features between laser-scanned and laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) samples. Although demonstrating a difference in melt pool geometries, the microstructures in scanning electron microscopy (SEM)- and transmission electron microscopy (TEM)- scale demonstrate a high degree of similarity, in terms of microstructure morphology, grain size, presence of precipitates, and phase distribution. The mechanical performance was evaluated by microhardness tests. The results revealed a 20% reduction in laser-scanned samples compared to LPBF samples, attributed to the thermal history and potential differences in phase fractions. The decreasing trend was also observed in the benchmark alloy showing a 10% absolute error with respect to the model alloy. This study underscores the potential of this workflow to accelerate alloy design in AM by circumventing customized powder production and encourages further exploration across diverse materials and processing parameters.

Title: Molecular Nanomagnet $\text{Cu}^\text{II}\text{Ni}^\text{II}\text{Cu}^\text{II}$ as Resource for Bipartite and Tripartite Quantum Entanglement and Coherence
Authors: Azadeh Ghannadan, Hamid Arian Zad, Saeed Haddadi, Jozef Strečka, Zhirayr Adamyan, Vadim Ohanyan
Abstract: We investigate key quantum characteristics of the mixed spin-(1/2,1,1/2) Heisenberg trimer under the influence of an external magnetic field. Specifically, we analyze the distributions of bipartite and tripartite entanglement quantified through the respective negativities, and the $l_1$-norm of coherence with the help of rigorous analytical and numerical methods. Our findings suggest that the heterotrinuclear molecular nanomagnet $[\{\text{Cu}^\text{II}\text{L}\}_2\text{Ni}^\text{II}(\text{H}_2\text{O})_2](\text{ClO}_4)_{2} . 3\text{H}_2\text{O}$, which represents an experimental realization of the mixed spin-(1/2,1,1/2) Heisenberg trimer, exhibits a significant bipartite entanglement between $\text{Cu}^\text{II}$ and $\text{Ni}^\text{II}$ magnetic ions along with robust tripartite entanglement among all three constituent $\text{Cu}^\text{II}\text{Ni}^\text{II}\text{Cu}^\text{II}$ magnetic ions. The significant bipartite and tripartite entanglement persists even at relatively high temperatures up to $37\,\text{K}$ and magnetic fields up to $46\,\text{T}$, whereby the coherence is maintained even at elevated temperatures. {It is evidenced that the aforementioned molecular complex with the magnetic core $\text{Cu}^\text{II}\text{Ni}^\text{II}\text{Cu}^\text{II}$ provides an intriguing quantum resource, which exhibits a star-shaped state within the singlet eigenstate at low magnetic fields and W-like state within the triplet eigenstate at moderate magnetic fields.

Title: Encoded probabilistic imaginary-time evolution on a trapped-ion quantum computer for ground and excited states of spin qubits
Authors: Hirofumi Nishi, Yuki Takei, Taichi Kosugi, Shunsuke Mieda, Yutaka Natsume, Takeshi Aoyagi, Yu-ichiro Matsushita
Abstract: In this study, we employed a quantum computer to solve a low-energy effective Hamiltonian for spin defects in diamond (so-called NV centre) and wurtzite-type aluminium nitride, which are anticipated to be qubits. The probabilistic imaginary-time evolution (PITE) method, designed for use in a fault-tolerant quantum computer (FTQC) era, was employed to calculate the ground and excited states of the spin singlet state, as represented by the effective Hamiltonian. It is difficult to compute the spin singlet state correctly using density functional theory (DFT), which should be described by multiple Slater determinants. To mitigate the effects of quantum errors inherent in current quantum computers, we implemented a $[[ n+2,n,2 ]]$ quantum error detection (QED) code called the Iceberg code. Despite the inevitable destruction of the encoded state resulting from the measurement of the ancilla qubit at each PITE step, we were able to successfully re-encode and recover the logical success state. In the implementation of the PITE, it was observed that the effective Hamiltonian comprises large components of the diagonal part and a relatively small non-diagonal part, which is frequently the case with quantum chemistry calculations. An efficient implementation of Hamiltonian simulations, in which the diagonal components dominate, was developed on a quantum computer based on the second-order Trotter-Suzuki decomposition. This is the first instance of an encoded PITE circuit being executed on a trapped-ion quantum computer. Our results demonstrate that QED effectively reduces quantum errors and that we successfully obtained both the ground and excited states of the spin singlet state. Our demonstration clearly manifests that Zr$_{\rm Al}$V$_{\rm N}$, Ti$_{\rm Al}$V$_{\rm N}$, and Hf$_{\rm Al}$V$_{\rm N}$ defects have a high potential as spin qubits for quantum sensors.

Title: Multipartite Entanglement and Quantum Sensing in a Spin-5/2 Heisenberg Molecular Iron(III) Triangle
Authors: Hamid Arian Zad, Jozef Strečka, Winfried Plass
Abstract: This study provides insights into the static and dynamic quantum properties of the trinuclear high-spin iron(III) molecular complex $[\mathrm{Fe}_3\mathrm{Cl}_3(\mathrm{saltag^\mathrm{Br}})(\mathrm{py})_6]\mathrm{ClO}_4$ to be further abbreviated as Fe$_3$. Using exact diagonalization of a spin-5/2 Heisenberg triangle in a magnetic field, we model the corresponding quantum behavior of the molecular compound Fe$_3$. Our rigorous analysis employs various key metrics to explore a rich quantum behavior of this molecular compound. At sufficiently low temperatures, the bipartite negativity reveals that the pairwise entanglement between any pair of iron(III) magnetic ions of the molecular complex Fe$_3$ can be significantly enhanced by a small magnetic field. This enhancement is followed by unconventional step-like changes characterized by a sequence of plateaus and sudden downturns as the magnetic field further increases. A qualitatively similar behavior is also observed in the genuine tripartite entanglement among all three iron(III) magnetic ions in the trinuclear complex Fe$_3$. Notably, the bipartite and tripartite entanglement persist in the molecular complex Fe$_3$ up to moderate temperatures of approximately 30~K and 70~K, respectively. Additionally, we demonstrate the achievement of quantum-enhanced sensitivity by initializing the molecular complex Fe$_3$ in Dicke states. Finally, we investigated a quantum-sensing protocol by applying a local magnetic field specifically to one iron(III) magnetic ion of the molecular compound Fe$_3$ and performing readout sequentially on one of two remaining iron(III) magnetic ions.

Title: Emergence of capillary waves in miscible co-flowing fluids
Authors: Alessandro Carbonaro, Giovanni Savorana, Luca Cipelletti, Rama Govindarajan, Domenico Truzzolillo
Abstract: We show that capillary waves can exist at the the boundary between miscible co-flowing fluids. We unveil that the interplay between transient interfacial stresses and confinement drives the progressive transition from the well-known inertial regime, characterized by a frequency independent wavenumber, $k\sim\omega^{0}$, to a capillary wave scaling, $k\sim\omega^{2/3}$, unexpected for miscible fluids. This allows us to measure the effective interfacial tension between miscible fluids and its rapid decay on time scales never probed so far, which we rationalize with a model going beyond square-gradient theories. Our work potentially opens a new avenue to measure transient interfacial tensions at the millisecond scale in a controlled manner.

Title: NETS: A Non-Equilibrium Transport Sampler
Authors: Michael S. Albergo, Eric Vanden-Eijnden
Abstract: We propose an algorithm, termed the Non-Equilibrium Transport Sampler (NETS), to sample from unnormalized probability distributions. NETS can be viewed as a variant of annealed importance sampling (AIS) based on Jarzynski's equality, in which the stochastic differential equation used to perform the non-equilibrium sampling is augmented with an additional learned drift term that lowers the impact of the unbiasing weights used in AIS. We show that this drift is the minimizer of a variety of objective functions, which can all be estimated in an unbiased fashion without backpropagating through solutions of the stochastic differential equations governing the sampling. We also prove that some these objectives control the Kullback-Leibler divergence of the estimated distribution from its target. NETS is shown to be unbiased and, in addition, has a tunable diffusion coefficient which can be adjusted post-training to maximize the effective sample size. We demonstrate the efficacy of the method on standard benchmarks, high-dimensional Gaussian mixture distributions, and a model from statistical lattice field theory, for which it surpasses the performances of related work and existing baselines.

Title: From Landau two-fluid model to de Sitter Universe
Authors: G.E. Volovik
Abstract: The condensed matter analogs are useful for consideration of the phenomena related to the quantum vacuum. This is because in condensed matter we know physics both in the infrared and in the ultraviolet limits, while in particle physics and gravity the physics at trans-Planckian scale is unknown. One of the corner stones of the connections between the non-relativistic condensed matter and the modern relativistic theories is the two-fluid hydrodynamics of superfluid helium. The dynamics and thermodynamics of the de Sitter state of the expansion of the Universe bear some features of the multi-fluid system. There are actually three components: the quantum vacuum, the gravitational component and relativistic matter. The expanding de Sitter vacuum serves as the thermal bath with local temperature, which is twice the Gibbons-Hawking temperature related to the cosmological horizon. This local temperature leads to the heating of matter component and the gravitational component. The latter behaves as Zel'dovich stiff matter and represents the dark matter. In equilibrium and in the absence of the conventional matter the positive partial pressure of dark matter compensates the negative partial pressure of quantum vacuum. That is why in the full equilibrium the total pressure is zero. This is similar to the superfluid and normal components in superfluids, which together produce the zero pressure of the liquid in the absence of environment. If one assumes that in dynamics, the gravitational dark matter behaves as the real Zel'dovich stiff matter, one obtains that both components experience the power law decay due to the energy exchange between these components. Then it follows that their values at present time have the correct order of magnitude. We also consider the other problems through the prism of condensed matter physics, including the black holes and Planck constant.

Title: Information Scrambling with Higher-Form Fields
Authors: Karunava Sil, Sourav Maji, Stavros Christodoulou, Abhishek Chowdhury
Abstract: The late time behaviour of OTOCs involving generic non-conserved local operators show exponential decay in chaotic many body systems. However, it has been recently observed that for certain holographic theories, the OTOC involving the $U(1)$ conserved current for a gauge field instead varies diffusively at late times. The present work generalizes this observation to conserved currents corresponding to higher-form symmetries that belong to a wider class of symmetries known as generalized symmetries. We started by computing the late time behaviour of OTOCs involving $U(1)$ current operators in five dimensional AdS-Schwarzschild black hole geometry for the 2-form antisymmetric $B$-fields. The bulk solution for the $B$-field exhibits logarithmic divergences near the asymptotic AdS boundary which can be regularized by introducing a double trace deformation in the boundary CFT. Finally, we consider the more general case with antisymmetric $p$-form fields in arbitrary dimensions. In the scattering approach, the boundary OTOC can be written as an inner product between asymptotic 'in' and 'out' states which in our case is equivalent to computing the inner product between two bulk fields with and without a shockwave background. We observe that the late time OTOCs have power law tails which seems to be a universal feature of the higher-form fields with $U(1)$ charge conservation.

Title: Decoupling Thermal Properties in Multilayer Systems for Advanced Thermoreflectance Techniques
Authors: Tao Chen, Puqing Jiang
Abstract: Thermoreflectance techniques, including time-domain thermoreflectance (TDTR), frequency-domain thermoreflectance (FDTR), and the square-pulsed source (SPS) method, are powerful tools for characterizing the thermal properties of bulk and thin-film materials. However, accurately interpreting their signals remains challenging due to intricate interdependencies among experimental variables. This study introduces a systematic framework based on singular value decomposition (SVD) to decouple these interdependent parameters and enhance the reliability of thermal property extraction. By applying SVD to the sensitivity matrix, we identify key parameter combinations and establish essential dimensionless numbers that govern thermoreflectance signals. The framework is applied to a GaN/Si heterostructure, where the performance of TDTR, FDTR, and SPS is evaluated and compared. The results demonstrate a high degree of consistency across all three techniques. Notably, with the intricate relationships of parameters unraveled, TDTR, FDTR, and SPS demonstrate significant potential to simultaneously and accurately extract five to seven key thermal properties, including thermal conductivity, heat capacity, and interfacial thermal conductance of the GaN/Si multilayer system. This framework not only improves the precision of thermoreflectance measurements but also lays a foundation for advanced thermal metrology in research and industrial applications.

Title: Fractional quantum Hall effect in higher dimensions
Authors: Abhishek Agarwal, Dimitra Karabali, V.P. Nair
Abstract: Generalizing from previous work on the integer quantum Hall effect, we construct the effective action for the analog of Laughlin states for the fractional quantum Hall effect in higher dimensions. The formalism is a generalization of the parton picture used in two spatial dimensions, the crucial ingredient being the cancellation of anomalies for the gauge fields binding the partons together. Some subtleties which exist even in two dimensions are pointed out. The effective action is obtained from a combination of the Dolbeault and Dirac index theorems. We also present expressions for some transport coefficients such as Hall conductivity and Hall viscosity for the fractional states.

Title: Young Researchers School 2024 Maynooth: Lectures on CFT, BCFT and DCFT
Authors: Christian Northe
Abstract: These notes were presented at the Young Researchers School (YRS) in Maynooth in April 2024 and provide an introduction to Conformal Field Theory CFT, Boundary Conformal Field Theory (BCFT) and Defect Conformal Field Theory (DCFT). This class is mostly self-contained and includes exercises with solutions. The first part of these notes is concerned with the basics of CFT, and was taught by the author during the pre-school for the YRS 2024. Here the aim is to convey the notion of conformal families, their fusion and the construction of partition functions. The second part of these notes is dedicated to boundaries and defects in CFT and was presented by the author at the main school. As far as boundaries are concerned, emphasis is placed on boundary operators and their state spaces, as well as the boundary state formalism with the Cardy constraint. Topological defects are discussed in analogy, i.e. defect state spaces and the relevant consistency constraint are derived. Verlinde lines are constructed as their simplest solution and their properties are inspected.

Title: A cohomology-based Gromov-Hausdorff metric approach for quantifying molecular similarity
Authors: JunJie Wee, Xue Gong, Wilderich Tuschmann, Kelin Xia
Abstract: We introduce, for the first time, a cohomology-based Gromov-Hausdorff ultrametric method to analyze 1-dimensional and higher-dimensional (co)homology groups, focusing on loops, voids, and higher-dimensional cavity structures in simplicial complexes, to address typical clustering questions arising in molecular data analysis. The Gromov-Hausdorff distance quantifies the dissimilarity between two metric spaces. In this framework, molecules are represented as simplicial complexes, and their cohomology vector spaces are computed to capture intrinsic topological invariants encoding loop and cavity structures. These vector spaces are equipped with a suitable distance measure, enabling the computation of the Gromov-Hausdorff ultrametric to evaluate structural dissimilarities. We demonstrate the methodology using organic-inorganic halide perovskite (OIHP) structures. The results highlight the effectiveness of this approach in clustering various molecular structures. By incorporating geometric information, our method provides deeper insights compared to traditional persistent homology techniques.

Title: Near-optimal shattering in the Ising pure p-spin and rarity of solutions returned by stable algorithms
Authors: Ahmed El Alaoui
Abstract: We show that in the Ising pure $p$-spin model of spin glasses, shattering takes place at all inverse temperatures $\beta \in (\sqrt{(2 \log p)/p}, \sqrt{2\log 2})$ when $p$ is sufficiently large as a function of $\beta$. Of special interest is the lower boundary of this interval which matches the large $p$ asymptotics of the inverse temperature marking the hypothetical dynamical transition predicted in statistical physics. We show this as a consequence of a `soft' version of the overlap gap property which asserts the existence of a distance gap of points of typical energy from a typical sample from the Gibbs measure. We further show that this latter property implies that stable algorithms seeking to return a point of at least typical energy are confined to an exponentially rare subset of that super-level set, provided that their success probability is not vanishingly small.

Title: Lifshitz tail states in non-Hermitian disordered photonic lattices
Authors: Stefano Longhi
Abstract: In lattices with uncorrelated on-site potential disorder, Anderson localization near the band edges can exhibit anomalously weak localization in the form of Lifshitz tail states. These states correspond to clusters of contiguous sites with nearly identical on-site energies, allowing excitations to extend significantly beyond the characteristic localization length determined by the inverse of Lyapunov exponent. Since Lifshitz tail states are rare events, with an exponentially small density of states, they are typically considered of limited practical importance. In this work, we demonstrate that when Anderson localization is induced by disorder in an imaginary on-site potential, Lifshitz tail states can dominate the system's dynamics and become experimentally observable. This phenomenon is illustrated through the Anderson-Bernoulli model in a non-Hermitian photonic lattice, shedding light on the unique interplay between disorder and non-Hermiticity in such systems

Abstract: Deformed droplets are ubiquitous in various industrial applications, such as inkjet printing, lab-on-a-chip devices, and spray cooling, and can fundamentally affect the involved applications both favorably and unfavorably. Here, we employ many-body dissipative particle dynamics to investigate the oscillations of water droplets on a harmonically and horizontally vibrating, solid substrate. Three distinct scenarios of oscillations as a response to the substrate vibrations have been identified. The first scenario reflects a common situation where the droplet can follow the substrate vibrations. In the other two scenarios, favored in the case of hydrophilic substrates, droplet oscillations generate high shear rates that ultimately lead to droplet breakup. Leveraging our simulation model, the properties of the droplet and the mechanisms related to the oscillations are analyzed with a molecular-level resolution, while results are also put in the perspective of experiment. Our study suggests that the three scenarios can be distinguished by the contact-surface velocity of the oscillating droplet, with threshold velocities influenced by the substrate's wettability. Moreover, the mean magnitude of the particle velocity at the contact surface plays a key role in determining the three oscillation phases, suggesting that the capillary number of the oscillating droplet governs the phase behavior. Thus, our approach aims to optimize droplet oscillations and deformations on solid substrates, which have direct implications for technological applications.

Title: Dissipation alters modes of information encoding in small quantum reservoirs near criticality
Authors: Krai Cheamsawat, Thiparat Chotibut
Abstract: Quantum reservoir computing (QRC) has emerged as a promising paradigm for harnessing near-term quantum devices to tackle temporal machine learning tasks. Yet identifying the mechanisms that underlie enhanced performance remains challenging, particularly in many-body open systems where nonlinear interactions and dissipation intertwine in complex ways. Here, we investigate a minimal model of a driven-dissipative quantum reservoir described by two coupled Kerr-nonlinear oscillators, an experimentally realizable platform that features controllable coupling, intrinsic nonlinearity, and tunable photon loss. Using Partial Information Decomposition (PID), we examine how different dynamical regimes encode input drive signals in terms of redundancy (information shared by each oscillator) and synergy (information accessible only through their joint observation). Our key results show that, near a critical point marking a dynamical bifurcation, the system transitions from predominantly redundant to synergistic encoding. We further demonstrate that synergy amplifies short-term responsiveness, thereby enhancing immediate memory retention, whereas strong dissipation leads to more redundant encoding that supports long-term memory retention. These findings elucidate how the interplay of instability and dissipation shapes information processing in small quantum systems, providing a fine-grained, information-theoretic perspective for analyzing and designing QRC platforms.

Abstract: Despite the extensive use of electrochemiluminescence in sensing applications, its potential in lighting and display technology has been constrained by the low luminance and short operational lifetime of electrochemiluminescence devices (ECLDs). Here, we demonstrate a substantial enhancement in the luminance, efficiency, and operational longevity of ECLDs by introducing electrochemically induced hyperfluorescence (ECiHF) via electrogeneration of charge-transfer (CT) excimers and subsequent energy transfer to fluorescent acceptors. By assuming a double-decker arrangement of the electron donor and acceptor groups, the molecule TpAT-tFFO supports solution-state thermally activated delayed fluorescence from a CT excimer state and efficient energy transfer to the rubrene dye TBRb. Optimized ECLDs based on this material combination achieve an unprecedented luminance of 6,220 cd/m2 and their operational lifetime (LT50) at an initial luminance of 100 cd/m2 exceeds 20 minutes, more than 10-fold longer than other ECLDs with meaningful efficiency or brightness. We identify energy level alignment between the excimer and the emitter as a crucial factor for efficient ECiHF. In mixtures with energy gaps > 0.5 eV, electron transfer results in reduced performance and renders the operation strongly dependent on applied voltage and frequency. By contrast, spectroelectrochemical analysis reveals that devices with favorable energy level alignment operate on a pure excimer mechanism across a wide range of frequencies. These findings highlight the innovative potential of ECiHF in improving the performance of ECLD, which can be widely applied in future commercial lighting solutions.

Title: Mean-Field Dynamics of the Bose-Hubbard Model in High Dimension
Authors: Denis Périce, Shahnaz Farhat, Sören Petrat
Abstract: The Bose-Hubbard model effectively describes bosons on a lattice with on-site interactions and nearest-neighbour hopping, serving as a foundational framework for understanding strong particle interactions and the superfluid to Mott insulator transition. This paper aims to rigorously establish the validity of a mean-field approximation for the dynamics of quantum systems in high dimension, using the Bose--Hubbard model on a square lattice as a case study. We prove a trace norm estimate between the one-lattice-site reduced density of the Schrödinger dynamics and the mean-field dynamics in the limit of large dimension. Here, the mean-field approximation is in the hopping amplitude and not in the interaction, leading to a very rich and non-trivial mean-field equation. This mean-field equation does not only describe the condensate, as is the case when the mean-field description comes from a large particle number limit averaging out the interaction, but it allows for a phase transition to a Mott insulator since it contains the full non-trivial interaction. Our work is a rigorous justification of a simple case of the highly successful dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) for bosons, which somewhat surprisingly yields many qualitatively correct results in three dimensions.
