Title: Surface transport and barrier effects in metal halide perovskites explored by bias polarity switching
Authors: Marian Betusiak, Roman Grill, Eduard Belas, Petr Praus, Mykola Brynza, Mahshid Ahmadi, Jonghee Yang, Artem Musiienko
Abstract: Surface transport and barrier effects in metal halide perovskites explored by bias polarity switching. By bias polarity switching we experimentally proved that free and trapped holes accumulate beneath the contact barrier. Further investigation proved that the duration of bias pulse changes surface properties that surprisingly affect only free holes. Temperature dependence of accumulated hole dissipation revealed two activation energies 150meV the height of the barrier and 770meV corresponding to a yet unknown process.

Title: Variational wavefunctions for fractional topological insulators
Authors: Glenn Wagner, Titus Neupert
Abstract: Twisted transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) host bands with opposite Chern number for the two spin species and could thus be host for fractional topological insulator states. In multicomponent quantum Hall systems, where the spins have equal Chern number, the resulting topological liquid states can be well modeled by trial wavefunctions such as the Halperin $(lmn)$ wavefunctions. These wavefunctions are exact zero energy states of certain short-range (pseudopotential) Hamiltonians. However, we show that such a construction fails in the case where the Chern numbers of the two spins are opposite, since the electrons with opposite Chern number cannot avoid one another. This underlines the importance of suppressing the short-range interspin Coulomb repulsion in order to realize fractional topological insulators in twisted TMDs. We introduce a trial wavefunction for the opposite Chern number Landau levels for filling factor $\nu=\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{3}$ in terms of pairing of composite fermions and show that it has good overlaps with the exact diagonalization ground state when the short-range Coulomb repulsion is sufficiently softened.

Title: Probing the Quantized Berry Phases in 1H-NbSe$_2$ Using Scanning Tunneling Microscopy
Authors: Dumitru Călugăru, Yi Jiang, Haojie Guo, Sandra Sajan, Yongsong Wang, Haoyu Hu, Jiabin Yu, B. Andrei Bernevig, Fernando de Juan, Miguel M. Ugeda
Abstract: Topologically trivial insulators are classified into two primary categories: unobstructed and obstructed atomic insulators. While both types can be described by exponentially localized Wannier orbitals, a defining feature of obstructed atomic insulators is that the centers of charge of these orbitals are positioned at empty sites within the unit cell, rather than on atoms. Despite extensive theoretical predictions, the unambiguous and quantitative experimental identification of an obstructed atomic phase has remained elusive. In this work, we present the first direct experimental evidence of such a phase in 1H-NbSe$_2$. We develop a novel method to extract the inter-orbital correlation functions from the local spectral function probed by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), leveraging the orbital wave functions obtained from ab initio calculations. Applying this technique to STM images, we determine the inter-orbital correlation functions for the atomic band of 1H-NbSe$_2$ that crosses the Fermi level. Our results show that this band realizes an optimally compact obstructed atomic phase, providing the first unambiguous experimental identification of such a phase. Our approach of deconvolving the STM signal using ab initio orbital wave functions is broadly applicable to other material platforms, offering a powerful tool for exploring other electronic phases.

Title: Generative diffusion model with inverse renormalization group flows
Authors: Kanta Masuki, Yuto Ashida
Abstract: Diffusion models represent a class of generative models that produce data by denoising a sample corrupted by white noise. Despite the success of diffusion models in computer vision, audio synthesis, and point cloud generation, so far they overlook inherent multiscale structures in data and have a slow generation process due to many iteration steps. In physics, the renormalization group offers a fundamental framework for linking different scales and giving an accurate coarse-grained model. Here we introduce a renormalization group-based diffusion model that leverages multiscale nature of data distributions for realizing a high-quality data generation. In the spirit of renormalization group procedures, we define a flow equation that progressively erases data information from fine-scale details to coarse-grained structures. Through reversing the renormalization group flows, our model is able to generate high-quality samples in a coarse-to-fine manner. We validate the versatility of the model through applications to protein structure prediction and image generation. Our model consistently outperforms conventional diffusion models across standard evaluation metrics, enhancing sample quality and/or accelerating sampling speed by an order of magnitude. The proposed method alleviates the need for data-dependent tuning of hyperparameters in the generative diffusion models, showing promise for systematically increasing sample efficiency based on the concept of the renormalization group.

Title: Goldstone mode of the broken helix in U(1) magnet EuIn2As2
Authors: Alex Liebman-Pelaez, Samuel J. Garratt, Veronika Sunko, Yue Sun, Jian R. Soh, Dharmalingam Prabhakaran, Andrew T. Boothroyd, Joseph Orenstein
Abstract: Goldstone modes acquire a frequency gap in the presence of perturbations that break the underlying continuous symmetry. Here, we study the response of a spin-based Goldstone mode to strain and magnetic field in the broken helix, a multi-$\textbf{Q}$ phase of EuIn$_2$As$_2$. Optical polarimetry with spatial and temporal resolution allows us to access information about both the structure and frequency of optically excited spin-wave modes under different strain conditions. We observe nearly uniform spin precession characteristic of a Goldstone mode only when magnetic field dominates over strain. In this regime, the frequency depends linearly on the applied field. A symmetry analysis for predicting the mode frequency near zero field demonstrates that the observed scaling is of the lowest allowed order. This work thus demonstrates the connections between magnetic symmetries and the frequency dependence of the Goldstone mode in an external field, and illustrates the power of our technique for studying the dynamics of complex magnets.

Title: Spectral properties from an efficient analytical representation of the $GW$ self-energy within a multipole approximation
Authors: Dario A. Leon, Kristian Berland, Claudia Cardoso
Abstract: We propose an efficient analytical representation of the frequency-dependent $GW$ self-energy $\Sigma$ via a multipole approximation (MPA-$\Sigma$). The multipole-Padé model for the self-energy is interpolated from a small set of numerical evaluations of $\Sigma$ in the complex frequency plane, similarly to the previously multipole representation developed for the screened Coulomb interaction (MPA-$W$) [Phys. Rev. B \textbf{104}, 115157 (2021)]. We show that, likewise MPA-$W$, an appropriate choice of frequency sampling in MPA-$\Sigma$ is critical to guarantee computational efficiency and high accuracy. The combined MPA-$W$ and MPA-$\Sigma$ scheme considerably reduces the cost of full-frequency self-energy calculations, especially for spectral band structures over a wide energy range. Crucially, MPA-$\Sigma$ enables a multipole representation for the interacting Green's function $G$ (MPA-$G$), providing a straightforward evaluation of all the spectral properties, and a more general way to define the renormalization factor $Z$. We validate the MPA-$\Sigma$ and MPA-$G$ approaches for diverse systems: bulk Si, Na and Cu, monolayer MoS$_2$, the NaCl ion-pair and the F$_2$ molecule. Moreover, we introduce toy MPA-$\Sigma$/$G$ models to examine the quasiparticle picture in different regimens of weak and strong correlation. With these models, we expose limitations in defining $Z$ from the local derivative of $\Sigma$.

Title: Landauer resistivity dipole at one dimensional defect revealed via near-field photocurrent nanoscopy
Authors: Francesca Falorsi, Marco Dembecki, Christian Eckel, Monica Kolek Martinez de Azagra, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Martin Statz, R. Thomas Weitz
Abstract: The fundamental question how to describe Ohmic resistance at the nanoscale has been answered by Landauer in his seminal picture of the so-called Landauer resistivity dipole. This picture has been theoretically well understood, however experimentally there are only few studies due to the need for a non-invasive local probe. Here we use the nanometer lateral resolution of near-field photocurrent imaging to thoroughly characterize a buried monolayer - bilayer graphene interface as an ideal one dimensional defect for the Landauer resistivity dipole. Via systematic tuning of the overall charge carrier density and the current flow we are able to detect the formation of Landauer resistivity dipoles due to charge carrier accumulation around the one dimensional defects. We found that, for Fermi energy values near the charge neutrality point (i.e. at low hole or electron doping), the photocurrent exhibits the same polarity as the applied source-drain voltage, which is consistent with changes in carrier concentration induced by the Landauer resistivity dipoles. This signature is no longer evident at higher charge carrier density in agreement with the performed numerical calculations. Photocurrent nanoscopy can thus serve as non-invasive technique to study local dissipation at hidden interfaces.

Title: Correlation between structural and magnetic properties of epitaxial YIG films by pulsed laser deposition
Authors: José Diogo Costa, N. Claessens, Giacomo Talmelli, Davide Tierno, F. Amar, Thibaut Devolder, Matthijn Dekkers, Florin Ciubotaru, Christoph Adelmann
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the relationships between film growth conditions, crystalline microstructure, and magnetic properties of epitaxial Yttrium Iron Garnet (Y$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$, YIG) thin films, deposited on Gallium Gadolinium Garnet (Ga$_3$Gd$_5$O$_{12}$, GGG). A direct correlation was observed between the residual epitaxial strain, bulk magnetic properties like saturation magnetization and magnetic damping), and the performance of spin-wave transmission devices based on these films. This correlation offers a pathway for a simplified, rapid assessment of YIG film quality, avoiding the need for complex time-consuming characterization techniques. In addition, we report a comprehensive investigation into the influence of pulsed-laser deposition parameters, including deposition temperature, pressure, laser fluence, frequency, and annealing conditions. Through systematic deposition optimization, state-of-the-art YIG films exhibiting ultralow magnetic damping could be obtained, which is critical for high-performance spintronic applications.

Title: Strain distribution in zincblende and wurtzite GaAs nanowires bent by a one-sided (In, Al)As stressor shell: consequences for torsion, chirality, and piezoelectricity
Authors: Yiannis Hadjimichael, Oliver Brandt, Christian Merdon, Costanza Manganelli, Patricio Farrell
Abstract: We present a finite-strain model that is capable of describing the large deformations in bent nanowire heterostructures. The model incorporates a nonlinear strain formulation derived from the first Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor, coupled with an energy functional that effectively captures the lattice-mismatch-induced strain field. We use the finite element method to solve the resulting partial differential equations and extract cross-sectional maps of the full strain tensor for both zincblende and wurtzite nanowires with lattice-mismatched core and one-sided stressor shell. In either case, we show that the bending is essentially exclusively determined by $\varepsilon_{zz}$. However, the distinct difference in shear strain has important consequences with regard to both the mechanical deformation and the existence of transverse piezoelectric fields in the nanowires.

Title: Flux channeling induced nano-confinement and enhancement of microwaves imaged by Rabi oscillation mapping
Authors: Jeffrey Rable, Jyotirmay Dwivedi, Nitin Samarth, Paul Stevenson, Arun Bansil, Swastik Kar
Abstract: With rapid advances in qubit technologies, techniques for localizing, modulating, and measuring RF fields and their impact on qubit performance are of the utmost importance. Here, we demonstrate that flux-channeling from a permalloy nanowire can be used to achieve localized spatial modulation of an RF field and that the modulated field can be mapped with high resolution using the Rabi oscillations of an NV center. Rabi maps reveal ~100 mm wavelength microwaves concentrated in sub-300 nm-scale regions with up to ~16$\times$ power enhancement. This modulation is robust over a 20 dBm power range and has no adverse impact on NV $T_2$ coherence time. Micromagnetic simulations confirm that the modulated field results from the nanowire's stray field through its constructive/destructive interference with the incident RF field. Our findings provide a new pathway for controlling qubits, amplifying RF signals, and mapping local fields in various on-chip RF technologies.

Title: Predicting Fundamental Gaps of Chromium-Based 2D Materials Using GW Methods
Authors: Miroslav Kolos, František Karlický
Abstract: Precise and accurate predictions of the two-dimensional (2D) material's fundamental gap are crucial for next-generation flexible electronic and photonic devices. We, therefore, evaluated the predictivity of the GW approach in its several variants built on various density functional theory (DFT) inputs. We identified reasons for significant discrepancies between generalized gradient approximation and hybrid DFT results for intricate cases of 2D materials containing chromium and evaluated the diverse behavior of subsequent quasiparticle corrections. We examined the impact of omitted vertex corrections using the more computationally intensive quasiparticle self-consistent QPGW and partially self-consistent QPGW$_0$ methodologies. We observed consistent trends across Cr-based and other 2D materials compared by advanced GW calculations, suggesting that single-shot G$_0$W$_0$@PBE can provide reasonable estimates of fundamental gaps when applied with caution. While this approach shows promise for a variety of 2D materials, including complicated antiferromagnetic chromium-based transition metal carbides (MXenes), further research is required to validate its reliability for strongly correlated systems. In contrast, the G$_0$W$_0$@HSE06 approach may strongly overestimate gaps in some cases.

Title: Transparent Correlated Metallic Perovskites with Conducive Chemical Disorder

Sinnott, Vincent Crespi, Venkatraman Gopalan, Roman Engel-Herbert, John T. Heron, Jon-Paul Maria
Abstract: This manuscript presents a working model linking chemical disorder and transport properties in correlated-electron perovskites with high-entropy formulations and a framework to actively design them. We demonstrate this new learning in epitaxial Sr$x$(Ti,Cr,Nb,Mo,W)O$3$ thin films that exhibit exceptional crystalline fidelity despite a diverse chemical formulation where most B-site species are highly misfit with respect to valence and radius. X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy confirm a unique combination of chemical disorder and structural perfection in thick epitaxial layers. This combination produces significant electron correlation, low electrical resistivity, and an optical transparency window that surpasses that of constituent end-members, with a flattened frequency- and temperature-dependent response. We address the computational challenges of modeling such systems and investigate short-range ordering using cluster expansion. These results showcase that unusual d-metal combinations access an expanded property design space that is predictable using end-member characteristics--though unavailable to them--thus offering performance advances in optical, spintronic, and quantum devices.

Title: Nonflat bands and chiral symmetry in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene
Authors: Miguel Sánchez Sánchez, José González, Tobias Stauber
Abstract: In this work, we derive effective theories for magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) based on the mean-field normal state at charge neutrality of a tight-binding model, thereby including the renormalizations coming from integrating out high-energy modes. In these models, the flat bands display a sizable increase of the bandwidth, and the corresponding wavefunctions flow towards the limit of perfect particle-hole symmetry and sublattice polarization. We further represent the flat bands in the 'vortex Chern' basis and also discuss the implications on the dynamics regarding the 'flat' and 'chiral' symmetries of MATBG, as manifested in the symmetry-broken states at neutrality.

Title: Anomalous and Planar Hall Effects in Cobalt-Holmium Thin Films Near Magnetic Sublattice Compensation
Authors: Ramesh C Budhani, Rajeev Nepal, Vinay Sharma, Jerzy Sadowski
Abstract: Metallic amorphous ferrimagnets derived from alloying 3d transition metals with 4f electron rare earths host fascinating effects of compensation between the 3d and 4f magnetic sublattices. Here, a detailed study of anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR), planar Hall effect (PHE) and anomalous Hall effect (AHE) are reported on a series of CoHo thin films over a wide field temperature phase space. Close to magnetic compensation temperature, the AHE loops show a double sign reversal and signatures of spin flop transition at higher fields. The AMR and PHE also display strong deviations from the classical angular dependence seen in soft ferromagnets like permalloy as the angle between in-plane current and magnetic field is scanned from 0 to 360 degrees. It is argued that the non zero orbital angular momentum of Ho ions in the lattice and stabilization of bubble domains below magnetic saturation may be responsible for such features. Direct imaging of magnetic textures with X ray photoelectron microscopy shows formation of stripe domain patterns in the regime of sublattice compensation. Such stripes are likely to transform into magnetic bubbles before full saturation is reached in a large magnetic field.

Title: Absence of diode effect in chiral type-I superconductor NbGe2

Abstract: Symmetry elegantly governs the fundamental properties and derived functionalities of condensed matter. For instance, realizing the superconducting diode effect (SDE) demands breaking space-inversion and time-reversal symmetries simultaneously. Although the SDE is widely observed in various platforms, its underlying mechanism remains debated, particularly regarding the role of vortices. Here, we systematically investigate the nonreciprocal transport in the chiral type-I superconductor NbGe2. Moreover, we induce type-II superconductivity with elevated superconducting critical temperature on the artificial surface by focused ion beam irradiation, enabling control over vortex dynamics in NbGe2 devices. Strikingly, we observe negligible diode efficiency (Q < 2%) at low magnetic fields, which rises significantly to Q ~ 50% at high magnetic fields, coinciding with an abrupt increase in vortex creep rate when the superconductivity of NbGe2 bulk is suppressed. These results unambiguously highlight the critical role of vortex dynamics in the SDE, in addition to the established symmetry rules.

Title: Measuring multisubunit mechanics of geometrically-programmed colloidal assemblies via cryo-EM multi-body refinement
Authors: Thomas E. Videbæk, Daichi Hayakawa, Michael F. Hagan, Gregory M. Grason, Seth Fraden, W. Benjamin Rogers
Abstract: Programmable self-assembly has recently enabled the creation of complex structures through precise control of the interparticle interactions and the particle geometries. Targeting ever more structurally complex, dynamic, and functional assemblies necessitates going beyond the design of the structure itself, to the measurement and control of the local flexibility of the inter-subunit connections and its impact on the collective mechanics of the entire assembly. In this study, we demonstrate a method to infer the mechanical properties of multisubunit assemblies using cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and RELION's multi-body refinement. Specifically, we analyze the fluctuations of pairs of DNA-origami subunits that self-assemble into tubules. By measuring the fluctuations of dimers using cryo-EM, we extract mechanical properties such as the bending modulus and interparticle spring constant. These properties are then applied to elastic models to predict assembly outcomes, which align well with experimental observations. This approach not only provides a deeper understanding of nanoparticle mechanics, but also opens new pathways to refining subunit designs to achieve precise assembly behavior. This methodology could have broader applications in the study of nanomaterials, including protein assemblies, where understanding the interplay of mechanical properties and subunit geometry is essential for controlling complex self-assembled structures.

Title: Dispersive dark excitons in van der Waals ferromagnet CrI3

Abstract: Spin-flip dark excitons are optical-dipole-forbidden quasiparticles with remarkable potential in optoelectronics, especially when they are realized within cleavable van der Waals materials. Despite this potential, dark excitons have not yet been definitively identified in ferromagnetic van der Waals materials. Here, we report two dark excitons in a model ferromagnetic material CrI3 using high-resolution resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) and show that they feature narrower linewidths compared to the bright excitons previously reported in this material. These excitons are shown to have spin-flip character, to disperse as a function of momentum, and to change through the ferromagnetic transition temperature. Given the versatility of van der Waals materials, these excitons hold promise for new types of magneto-optical functionality.

Title: Photoemission evidence for multi-orbital hole-doping in superconducting La2.85Pr0.15Ni2O7/SrLaAlO4 interfaces
Authors: Peng Li, Guangdi Zhou, Wei Lv, Yueying Li, Changming Yue, Haoliang Huang, Lizhi Xu, Jianchang Shen, Yu Miao, Wenhua Song, Zihao Nie, Yaqi Chen, Heng Wang, Weiqiang Chen, Yaobo Huang, Zhen-Hua Chen, Tian Qian, Junhao Lin, Junfeng He, Yu-Jie Sun, Zhuoyu Chen, Qi-Kun Xue
Abstract: Bilayer nickelate thin film superconductors discovered under ambient pressure enable vast possibilities for investigating electronic structures of the superconducting state. Here, we report angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements of heterointerfaces between 1, 2, and 3 unit-cell epitaxial La2.85Pr0.15Ni2O7 films and SrLaAlO4 substates, through pure-oxygen in situ sample transportation. Evidence obtained using photons with distinct probing depths shows that conduction is localized primarily at the first unit cell near the interface. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), together with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), indicates that interfacial Sr diffusion and pronounced oxygen 2p hybridization gradient may collectively account for the interfacial confinement of conduction. Fermi surface maps reveal hole doping compared to non-superconducting ambient-pressure bulk crystals. Measurements of dispersive band structures suggest the contributions from both Ni dx2-y2 and dz2 orbitals at the Fermi level. Density functional theory (DFT) + U calculations capture qualitative features of the ARPES results, consistent with a hole-doped scenario. These findings constrain theoretical models of the superconducting mechanism and suggest pathways for enhancing superconductivity in nickelates under ambient pressure.

Title: Machine Learning Relationships between Nanoporous Structures and Electrochemical Performance in MOF Supercapacitors
Authors: Zhenxiang Wang, Taizheng Wu, Liang Zeng, Jiaxing Peng, Ding Yu, Ming Gao, Guang Feng
Abstract: The development of supercapacitors is impeded by the unclear relationships between nanoporous electrode structures and electrochemical performance, primarily due to challenges in decoupling the complex interdependencies of various structural descriptors. While machine learning (ML) techniques offer a promising solution, their application is hindered by the lack of large, unified databases. Herein, we use constant-potential molecular simulation to construct a unified supercapacitor database with hundreds of metal-organic framework (MOF) electrodes. Leveraging this database, well-trained decision-tree-based ML models achieve fast, accurate, and interpretable predictions of capacitance and charging rate, experimentally validated by a representative case. SHAP analyses reveal that specific surface area (SSA) governs gravimetric capacitance while pore size effects are minimal, attributed to the strong dependence of electrode-ion coordination on SSA rather than pore size. SSA and porosity, respectively, dominate volumetric capacitance in 1D-pore and 3D-pore MOFs, pinnacling the indispensable effects of pore dimensionality. Meanwhile, porosity is found to be the most decisive factor in the charging rate for both 1D-pore and 3D-pore MOFs. Especially for 3D-pore MOFs, an exponential increase with porosity is observed in both ionic conductance and in-pore ion diffusion coefficient, ascribed to loosened ion packing. These findings provide profound insights for the design of high-performance supercapacitor electrodes.

Title: At low temperatures, glass-forming liquids relax in a simple way
Authors: Francesco Rusciano, Raffaele Pastore, Francesco Greco, Walter Kob
Abstract: Glass-forming liquids have only a modest tendency to crystallize and hence their dynamics can be studied even below the melting temperature. The relaxation dynamics of most of these liquids shows at a temperature $T_c$, somewhat above the glass-transition temperature $T_g$, a crossover, which indicates the conjunction of two different dynamical regimes. For temperatures slightly above $T_c$, experiments and computer simulations have extensively probed this dynamics on the particle level and identified several universal scaling laws that are often compatible with theoretical predictions. Using large scale computer simulations we extend these studies to temperatures below $T_c$ and find that the relaxation mechanism is qualitatively different from the one found at higher temperatures. We identify new scaling laws that allow to give a simple description of the relaxation dynamics at very low $T$s. Specifically we reveal that the cage-escape process is related to rare but large particle displacements that give rise to a distinctive sub-diffusive power-law in the time correlation functions. This insight helps to advance our understanding on the relaxation dynamics of glass-forming systems at temperatures that are close to the experimental glass transition.

Title: Tuning topologically nontrivial states in the BHT-Ni metal organic framework
Authors: Nafiseh Falsafi, Saeed H. Abedinpour, Fariba Nazari, Francesc Illas
Abstract: Using first principles calculations, we have demonstrated the creation of multiple quantum states, in the experimentally accessible metal organic framework BHT-Ni. Specifically, quantum spin Hall and quantum anomalous Hall states are induced by two and four electron doping, respectively. The geometrical symmetry breaking, is also investigated. For a low electron doping concentration of two electrons per unit cell, the Fermi energy shifts to a nontrivial band gap, between Dirac bands and a quantized spin Hall conductivity is predicted. Subsequently in a high electron doping concentration, Anomalous Hall conductivity with a quantized value was observed. In addition, for centrosymmetric (trans-like) and non-centrosymmetric (cis-like) structures, we found that the trans-like structure preserves quantum spin Hall and quantized spin Hall conductivity. In contrast, in the cis-like structure, space inversion symmetry breaking leads to the appearance of valley Hall effect and the disappearance of spin Hall conductivity.

Title: Rapid, Comprehensive Search of Crystalline Phases from X-ray Diffraction in Seconds via GPU-Accelerated Bayesian Variational Inference
Authors: Ryo Murakami, Kenji Nagata, Yoshitaka Matsushita, Masahiko Demura
Abstract: In analysis of X-ray diffraction data, identifying the crystalline phase is important for interpreting the material. The typical method is identifying the crystalline phase from the coincidence of the main diffraction peaks. This method identifies crystalline phases by matching them as individual crystalline phases rather than as combinations of crystalline phases, in the same way as the greedy method. If multiple candidates are obtained, the researcher must subjectively select the crystalline phases. Thus, the identification results depend on the researcher's experience and knowledge of materials science. To solve this problem, we have developed a Bayesian estimation method to identify the combination of crystalline phases, taking the entire profile into account. This method estimates the Bayesian posterior probability of crystalline phase combinations by performing an approximate exhaustive search of all possible combinations. It is a method for identifying crystalline phases that takes into account all peak shapes and phase combinations. However, it takes a few hours to obtain the analysis results. The aim of this study is to develop a Bayesian method for crystalline phase identification that can provide results in seconds, which is a practical calculation time. We introduce variational sparse estimation and GPU computing. Our method is able to provide results within 10 seconds even when analysing $2^{50}$ candidate crystalline phase combinations. Furthermore, the crystalline phases identified by our method are consistent with the results of previous studies that used a high-precision algorithm.

Title: Optical conductivity of the topologically-nontrivial MXenes, Mo$_2$HfC$_2$O$_2$ and W$_2$HfC$_2$O$_2$: first-principles calculation and effective model analysis
Authors: Tetsuro Habe
Abstract: The optical conductivity and the relevant electronic excitation processes are investigated in topologically-nontrivial MXenes, Mo$_2$HfC$_2$O$_2$ and W$_2$HfC$_2$O$_2$, utilizing first-principles calculation and effective model analysis. The numerical calculation based on the first-principles band structure reveals the presence of several characteristic features in the spectrum of optical conductivity as a function of photon energy. The drastic dependence on the photon polarization angle is also presented in terms of apparent features. In this paper, an effective model is also generated referring to the crystal symmetries and applied to reveal the microscopic origin of the characteristics. Then, it is shown that some features are strongly related to parity inversion between the conduction and valence bands, the key signature in electronic structures of topologically nontrivial insulators.

Title: Magnetically induced deformation of isotropic magneto-active elastomers and its relation to the magnetorheological effect
Authors: Mehran Roghani, Dirk Romeis, Gašper Glavan, Inna A. Belyaeva, Mikhail Shamonin, Marina Saphiannikova
Abstract: Can isotropic Magneto-Active Elastomers (MAEs) undergo giant magnetically induced deformations and exhibit huge magnetorheological effects simultaneously? In this experimental and theoretical study, we reveal how the macroscopic deformation of MAEs relates to the process of particle restructuring caused by application of a magnetic field. For this purpose, MAE cylinders with different aspect ratios and particle loadings are studied in uniform magnetic fields. The axial deformations of the cylinders are acquired using an optical camera. A unified mean-field model proposed in previous studies is adapted to describe the transition of initially isotropic cylinders into transversely isotropic ones. This mechanical transition is caused by the rearrangement of particles into dense columnar structures aligned with the field and is believed to result in a huge magnetorheological effect. Our model however predicts less than three-fold increase in elastic moduli when evaluated along the field direction. This prediction is based on a careful examination of the shear moduli of studied MAEs and the columnar structures. A weak magnetorheological effect explains significant axial deformations measured in the field direction. A strong magnetorheological effect would hinder axial deformations due to an increase in modulus by several orders of magnitude. Not only are the moduli and macroscopic deformations influenced by microstructure evolution, but so is the magnetization of particles, which increases as they rearrange into dense columns. With this study, we show that the unified mean-field model provides quantitative access to hidden material properties such as magnetization and stiffness in MAE samples with different shapes and evolving microstructures.

Title: Detection and control of electronic orbital magnetism by spin waves in honeycomb ferromagnets
Authors: Lichuan Zhang, Lu Zhang, Dongwook Go, Chengwang Niu, Wulf Wulfheke, Peng Li, Yuanping Chen, Yuriy Mokrousov, Lizhi Zhang
Abstract: Exploring and manipulating the orbital degrees of freedom in solids has become a fascinating research topic in modern magnetism. Here, we demonstrate that spin waves can provide a way to control electronic orbital magnetism by the mechanism of scalar spin chirality, allowing for experimental detection using techniques such as the magneto-optical Kerr effect and scanning transmission electron microscopy. By applying linear spin wave theory, we uncover that electronic magnon-driven orbital magnetization is extremely sensitive to the character of the magnonic excitations. Furthermore, we show that both the induced electronic orbital magnetism and the Nernst transport properties of the orbital angular momentum can be regulated by the strength of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, Kitaev interaction, as well as the direction and magnitude of the external magnetic field. We argue that magnon-mediated electronic orbital magnetism presents an emergent variable which has to be taken into account when considering the physics of coupling magnonic excitiations to phonons and light.

Title: Edge-Dependent Step-Flow Growth Mechanism in $\beta$-Ga$_{2}$O$_{3}$ (100) Facet at the Atomic Level
Authors: Qi Li, Junlei Zhao, Na Lin, Xiufeng Cheng, Xian Zhao, Zhaojun Liu, Zhitai Jia, Mengyuan Hua
Abstract: Homoepitaxial step-flow growth of high-quality $\beta$-Ga$_{2}$O$_{3}$ thin films is essential for the advancement of high-performance Ga$_{2}$O$_{3}$-based devices. In this work, the step-flow growth mechanism of $\beta$-Ga$_{2}$O$_{3}$ (100) facet is explored by machine-learning molecular dynamics simulations and density functional theory calculations. Our results reveal that Ga adatoms and Ga-O adatom pairs, with their high mobility, are the primary atomic species responsible for efficient surface migration on the (100) facet. The asymmetric monoclinic structure of $\beta$-Ga$_{2}$O$_{3}$ induces a distinct two-stage Ehrlich-Schwoebel barrier for Ga adatoms at the [00$\overline{1}$] step edge, contributing to the suppression of double-step and hillock formation. Furthermore, a miscut towards [00$\overline{1}$] does not induce the nucleation of stable twin boundaries, whereas a miscut towards [001] leads to the spontaneous formation of twin boundaries. This research provides meaningful insights not only for high-quality $\beta$-Ga$_{2}$O$_{3}$ homoepitaxy but also the step-flow growth mechanism of other similar systems.

Abstract: To enhance the activity of photocatalysts for hydrogen production and CO2 conversion, noble metal cocatalysts as electron traps and/or acceptors such as platinum or gold are usually utilized. This study hypothesizes that mixing elements with heterogeneous electronic configurations and diverse electronegativities can provide both acceptor and donor sites of electrons to avoid using cocatalysts. This hypothesis was examined in high-entropy oxides (HEOs), which show high flexibility for atomic-scale compositional changes by keeping their single-or dual-phase structure. A new highentropy oxide was designed and synthesized by mixing elements with an empty d orbital (titanium, zirconium, niobium and tantalum) and a fully occupied d orbital (gallium). The oxide, synthesized by high-pressure torsion followed by calcination, had two phases (88 wt% orthorhombic (Pbcn) and 12 wt% monoclinic (I2/m)) with an overall composition of TiZrNbTaGaO10.5. It exhibited UV and visible light absorbance with a low bandgap of 2.5 eV, low radiative electron-hole recombination and oxygen vacancy generation due to mixed valences of cations. It successfully acted as a photocatalyst for CO and CH4 production from CO2 conversion and hydrogen production from water splitting without cocatalyst addition. These findings confirm that introducing heterogeneous electronic configurations and electronegativities can be considered as a design criterion to avoid the need to use cocatalysts.

Title: AR-SFQ: Asynchronous Reset Library Using {\alpha}-Cell Design
Authors: Yasemin Kopur, Beyza Zeynep Ucpinar, Mustafa Altay Karamuftuoglu, Sasan Razmkhah, Massoud Pedram
Abstract: Rapid Single Flux Quantum (RSFQ) circuits are the most evolved superconductor logic family. However, the need to clock each cell and the deep pipeline causes a complex clock network with a large skew. This results in lower throughput and high latency in RSFQ. This work introduces an asynchronous RSFQ cell library that incorporates the {\alpha}-cell, enabling bidirectional signal paths in RSFQ circuits. The {\alpha}-cell mitigates the need for a large clock network by allowing reverse signal flow, minimizing routing, and enabling compact circuit designs. We demonstrate the library's reliability and efficiency by analog simulations and using in-house optimization tools. The asynchronous reset RSFQ (AR-SFQ) will enable efficient implementation of scalable, high-performance computing frameworks, such as state machines, neuromorphic computing, and higher fan-in circuits.

Title: Tunable spin and orbital torques in Cu-based magnetic heterostructures
Authors: Silvia Damerio, Can O. Avci
Abstract: Current-induced torques originating from earth-abundant 3d elements offer a promising avenue for low-cost and sustainable spintronic memory and logic applications. Recently, orbital currents -- transverse orbital angular momentum flow in response to an electric field -- have been in the spotlight since they allow current-induced torque generation from 3d transition metals. Here, we report a comprehensive study of the current-induced spin and orbital torques in Cu-based magnetic heterostructures. We show that high torque efficiencies can be achieved in engineered Ni$_{80}$Fe$_{20}$/Cu bilayers where Cu is naturally oxidized, exceeding the ones found in the archetypical Co/Pt. Furthermore, we demonstrate sign and amplitude control of the damping-like torque by manipulating the oxidation state of Cu via solid-state gating. Our findings provide insights into the interplay between charge, spin, and orbital transport in Cu-based heterostructures and open the door to the development of gate-tunable spin-orbitronic devices.

Title: Unpolarized prethermal discrete time crystal
Authors: Takeru Yokota, Tatsuhiko N. Ikeda
Abstract: Prethermal discrete time crystals (DTCs) are a class of nonequilibrium phases of matter that exhibit robust subharmonic responses to periodic driving without requiring disorder. Prior realizations of prethermal DTCs have relied on the presence of either spontaneous or induced finite polarization. Here, we introduce a new class of prethermal DTCs termed unpolarized prethermal discrete time crystals (UPDTCs) that do not require finite polarization. By studying a spin model of periodically driven trapped ions, we show that robust period-doubled dynamics can persist in the autocorrelation function of the staggered magnetization for paramagnetic initial states, even when the staggered magnetization itself vanishes. The key insight is that quantum fluctuations alone are sufficient to reveal coherent DTC-like dynamics. We demonstrate that UPDTCs are exponentially long-lived in the high-frequency driving regime, consistent with Floquet prethermalization. Our results expand the known phenomenology of prethermal time crystals and underscore the role of quantum effects in stabilizing novel nonequilibrium phases. We propose an experimental protocol to observe UPDTCs in trapped-ion simulators.

Title: Very soft microgels at the interface behave and flow as Hertzian-like spheres
Authors: José Ruiz-Franco, Tom Höfken, Maximilian M. Schmidt, Steffen Bochenek, Emanuela Zaccarelli, Andrea Scotti
Abstract: Soft pair potentials predict a reentrant liquid phase for high concentrations, a behavior not observed experimentally. Here, very soft microgels confined at an oil-water interface are used as a model system of particles interacting via a soft potential in two dimensions (2D). Interfacial rheology measurements demonstrate the existence of different flow regimes that depend on the compression of the monolayer. Such a compression also leads to a non-monotonic variation of the elastic moduli and of the yield stress of the monolayer. These results, together with the equilibrium phase behavior of the monolayer, are reproduced in molecular dynamics simulations of a 2D system of particles interacting with a Hertzian-like potential. Remarkably, due to the non-monotonic variation of the elastic moduli, we observe \textit{isoelastic} points where the monolayer shows the same stiffness at very different concentrations. These points are the experimental manifestation of the predicted reentrant liquid phase.

Title: From Complexification to Self-Similarity: New Aspects of Quantum Criticality
Authors: Yang Liu, Erhai Zhao, Haiyuan Zou
Abstract: Quantum phase transitions are a fascinating area of condensed matter physics. The extension through complexification not only broadens the scope of this field but also offers a new framework for understanding criticality and its statistical implications. This mini review provides a concise overview of recent developments in complexification, primarily covering finite temperature and equilibrium quantum phase transitions, as well as their connection with dynamical quantum phase transitions and non-Hermitian physics, with a particular focus on the significance of Fisher zeros. Starting from the newly discovered self-similarity phenomenon associated with complex partition functions, we further discuss research on self-similar systems briefly. Finally, we offer a perspective on these aspects.

Title: Detecting Many-Body Scars from Fisher Zeros
Authors: Yuchen Meng, Songtai Lv, Yang Liu, Zefan Tan, Erhai Zhao, Haiyuan Zou
Abstract: The far-from-equilibrium dynamics of interacting quantum systems still defy precise understanding. One example is the so-called quantum many-body scars (QMBSs), where a set of energy eigenstates evade thermalization to give rise to long-lived oscillations. Despite the success of viewing scars from the perspectives of symmetry, commutant algebra and quasiparticles, it remains a challenge to elucidate the mechanism underlying all QMBS and to distinguish them from other forms of ergodicity breaking. In this work, we introduce an alternative route to detect and diagnose QMBS based on Fisher zeros, i.e. the patterns of zeros of the analytically continued partition function $Z$ on the complex $\beta$ (inverse temperature) plane. For systems with scars, a continuous line of Fisher zeros will appear off the imaginary $\beta$ axis and extend upward, separating the $\beta$ plane into regions with distinctive thermalization behaviors. This conjecture is motivated from interpreting the complex $Z$ as the survival amplitude of the thermofield double state, and it is validated by analyzing two models with QMBS, the $\bar{P}X\bar{P}$ model and the Ising chain in external fields. These models also illustrate another scenario of ergodicity breaking, where lines of Fisher zeros repeatedly intersect the imaginary $\beta$ axis. This ``statistical mechanics" approach places QMBS within the same framework of thermal and dynamical phase transitions. It has the advantage of easily spotting the emergence of scars without exhaustively examining each individual quantum state.

Title: Atom-Molecule Superradiance and Entanglement with Cavity-Mediated Three-Body Interactions
Authors: Yun Chen, Yuqi Wang, Jingjun You, Yingqi Liu, Su Yi, Yuangang Deng
Abstract: Ultracold atoms coupled to optical cavities offer a powerful platform for studying strongly correlated many-body physics. Here, we propose an experimental scheme for creating biatomic molecules via cavity-enhanced photoassociation from an atomic condensate. This setup realizes long-range three-body interactions mediated by tripartite cavity-atom-molecule coupling. Beyond a critical pump strength, a self-organized square lattice phase for molecular condensate emerges, resulting in hybrid atom-molecule superradiance with spontaneous $U(1)$ symmetry breaking. Distinct from previously observed ultracold bosonic (fermionic) atomic superradiance, our findings demonstrate bosonic enhancement characterized by a cubic scaling of steady-state photon number with total atom number. Additionally, strong photon-matter entanglement is shown to effectively characterize superradiant quantum phase transition. Our findings deepen the understanding of quantum superchemistry and exotic many-body nonequilibrium dynamics in cavity-coupled quantum gases.

Title: Transfer learning of many-body electronic correlation entropy from local measurements
Authors: Faluke Aikebaier, Teemu Ojanen, Jose L. Lado
Abstract: The characterization of quantum correlations in many-body systems is instrumental to understanding the nature of emergent phenomena in quantum materials. The correlation entropy serves as a key metric for assessing the complexity of a quantum many-body state in interacting electronic systems. However, its determination requires the measurement of all single-particle correlators across a macroscopic sample, which can be impractical. Machine learning methods have been shown to allow learning the correlation entropy from a reduced set of measurements, yet these methods assume that the targeted system is contained in the set of training Hamiltonians. Here we show that a transfer learning strategy enables correlation entropy learning from a reduced set of measurements in families of Hamiltonians never considered in the training set. We demonstrate this transfer learning methodology in a wide variety of interacting models including local and non-local attractive and repulsive many-body interactions, long-range hopping, doping, magnetic field, and spin-orbit coupling. Furthermore, we show how this transfer learning methodology allows detecting quantum many-body phases never observed during their training set without prior knowledge about them. Our results demonstrate that correlation entropy learning can be potentially performed experimentally without requiring training in the experimentally realized Hamiltonian.

Title: Which chromium-sulfur compounds exist as 2D material?
Authors: Affan Safeer, Mahdi Ghorbani-Asl, Wouter Jolie, Arkady V. Krasheninnikov, Thomas Michely, Jeison Fischer
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) chromium-sulfides are synthesized by molecular beam epitaxy using graphene as a substrate. Structure characterization by employing scanning tunneling microscopy and low energy electron diffraction indicates that there are two 2D phases, Cr$_2$S$_3$-2D and Cr$_{2\frac{2}{3}}$S$_4$-2D, which have not been reported before. Cr$_{2\frac{2}{3}}$S$_4$-2D is related to bulk Cr$_5$S$_6$, but thinner than a bulk unit cell. For Cr$_2$S$_3$-2D, an even thinner material, no bulk counterpart exists. Both 2D materials are found to be structurally stable under ambient conditions and exhibit interesting electronic properties. Extensive first-principles calculations provide further insight into the electronic structure of these systems and indicate that they should be magnetic. Surprisingly, CrS$_2$ recently reported from density functional theory calculations and experiments could not be fabricated.

Title: Distinct terahertz third-harmonic generation of many-body excitonic states
Authors: Changqing Zhu, Anneke Reinold, Patrick Pilch, Sergey Kovalev, Julian Heckötter, Doris Reiter, Manfred Bayer, Marc Assmann, Zhe Wang
Abstract: The dynamics of an electron-hole plasma governed by strong Coulomb interaction is a challenging many-body this http URL report on experimental realization of electron-hole many-body states in the picosecond time scale, with tunable densities in a representative semiconductor Cu$_2$O. By using time-resolved optical-pump terahertz third-harmonic-generation spectroscopy, we study the nonlinear terahertz dynamical characteristics of the many-body electron-hole states. We find not only efficient and nonperturbative terahertz third-harmonic yield associated with the excitonic formation, but also a nonmonotonic dependence of the excitonic nonlinear response on the electron-hole density, reflecting the exciton dissociation at high charge density. Our results provide an efficient excitonic sensing of the far-from-equilibrium electron-hole many-body states.

Title: Ferroelectricity in layered bismuth oxide down to 1 nanometer

Abstract: Atomic-scale ferroelectrics are of great interest for high-density electronics, particularly field-effect transistors, low-power logic, and nonvolatile memories. We devised a film with a layered structure of bismuth oxide that can stabilize the ferroelectric state down to 1 nanometer through samarium bondage. This film can be grown on a variety of substrates with a cost-effective chemical solution deposition. We observed a standard ferroelectric hysteresis loop down to a thickness of ~1 nanometer. The thin films with thicknesses that range from 1 to 4.56 nanometers possess a relatively large remanent polarization from 17 to 50 microcoulombs per square centimeter. We verified the structure with first-principles calculations, which also pointed to the material being a lone pair-driven ferroelectric material. The structure design of the ultrathin ferroelectric films has great potential for the manufacturing of atomic-scale electronic devices.

Title: Plasmon-sound hybridization in ionic crystals
Authors: Jakob Rappolt, Andreas Rückriegel, Peter Kopietz
Abstract: We study the hybridization between plasmons, phonons, and electronic sound in ionic crystals using the Debye model, where the ionic background is modeled as a homogeneous, isotropic, elastic medium. We explicitly obtain the energies and the damping of the hybrid plasmon-sound modes in the hydrodynamic regime and calculate the corresponding dynamic structure factor. We show that the direct Coulomb interaction between the ions is essential to obtain a collective sound mode with linear dispersion.

Title: Bridging conformal field theory and parton approaches to SU(n)_k chiral spin liquids
Authors: Tong Liu, Ying-Hai Wu, Hong-Hao Tu, Tao Xiang
Abstract: We employ the SU(n)_k Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) model in conformal field theory to construct lattice wave functions in both one and two dimensions. It is unveiled that these wave functions can be reinterpreted as parton states, which enables efficient conversion to matrix product states such that many physical properties can be evaluated directly. In one dimension, these wave functions describe critical spin chains whose universality classes are in one-to-one correspondence with the WZW models used in the construction. In two dimensions, our constructions yield model wave functions for chiral spin liquids, and we show how to find all topological sectors of them in a systematic way. Using the null vectors of Kac-Moody algebras, parent Hamiltonians of the SU(3)_k series are derived. The SU(3)_k chiral spin liquids are lattice analogs of non-Abelian spin-singlet fractional quantum Hall states, and the k = 2 member hosts Fibonacci anyons.

Title: Critical relaxational dynamics at the continuous transitions of three-dimensional spin models with ${\mathbb Z}_2$ gauge symmetry
Authors: Claudio Bonati, Andrea Pelissetto, Ettore Vicari
Abstract: We characterize the dynamic universality classes of a relaxational dynamics under equilibrium conditions at the continuous transitions of three-dimensional (3D) spin systems with a ${\mathbb Z}_2$-gauge symmetry. In particular, we consider the pure lattice ${\mathbb Z}_2$-gauge model and the lattice ${\mathbb Z}_2$-gauge XY model, which present various types of transitions: topological transitions without a local order parameter and transitions characterized by both gauge-invariant and non-gauge-invariant XY order parameters. We consider a standard relaxational (locally reversible) Metropolis dynamics and determine the dynamic critical exponent $z$ that characterizes the critical slowing down of the dynamics as the continuous transition is approached. At the topological ${\mathbb Z}_2$-gauge transitions we find $z=2.55(6)$. Therefore, the dynamics is significantly slower than in Ising systems -- $z\approx 2.02$ for the 3D Ising universality class -- although 3D ${\mathbb Z}_2$-gauge systems and Ising systems have the same static critical behavior because of duality. As for the nontopological transitions in the 3D ${\mathbb Z}_2$-gauge XY model, we find that their critical dynamics belong to the same dynamic universality class as the relaxational dynamics in ungauged XY systems, independently of the gauge-invariant or nongauge-invariant nature of the order parameter at the transition.

Title: A simple model of a sequence-reading diffusion: non-self-averaging and self-averaging properties
Authors: Silvio Kalaj, Enzo Marinari, Gleb Oshanin, Luca Peliti
Abstract: Motivated by a question about the sensitivity of knots' diffusive motion to the actual sequence of nucleotides placed on a given DNA, here we study a simple model of a sequence-reading diffusion on a stretched chain with a frozen sequence of "letters" $A$ and $B$, having different interaction energies. The chain contains a single distortion - a hernia - which brings the two letters at its bottom together such that they interact. Due to interactions with the solvent, the hernia performs a random hopping motion along the chain with the transition rates dependent on its actual position. Our two focal questions are a) the dependence of various transport properties on the letters' interaction energy and b) whether these properties are self-averaging with respect to different realizations of sequences. We show that the current through a finite interval, the resistance of this interval and the splitting probabilities on this interval lack self-averaging. On the contrary, the mean first-passage time through a finite interval with $N$ sites and the diffusion coefficient in a periodic chain are self-averaging in the limit $N \to \infty$. Concurrently, two latter properties exhibit sample-to-sample fluctuations for finite $N$, as evidenced by numerical simulations.

Title: Theoretical Models for Tension-Dependent DNA Looping Time
Authors: Wout Laeremans, Wouter G Ellenbroek
Abstract: The influence of tension on DNA looping has been studied both experimentally and theoretically in the past. However, different theoretical models have yielded different predictions, leaving uncertainty about their validity. We briefly review the predictions of those models and propose a novel model that demonstrates exceptional agreement with simulations for long semiflexible chains. Additionally, we elucidate the relationship between our result and that of the previously proposed two-state model, highlighting the distinct interpretative approach that underpins our framework. Our findings offer predictive insights that pave the way for future experimental validation.

Title: Exploring the wettability of liquid iron on refractory oxides with sessile drop technique and density-functional derived Hamaker constants
Authors: Sudhanshu Kuthe, Mathias Boström, Wen Chen, Björn Glaser, Clas Persson
Abstract: The macroscopic interactions of liquid iron and solid oxides, such as alumina, calcia, magnesia, silica, and zirconia manifest the behavior and efficiency of high-temperature metallurgical processes. The oxides serve dual roles, both as components of refractory materials in submerged entry nozzles and also as significant constituents of non-metallic inclusions in the melt. It is therefore crucial to understand the physicochemical interplay between the liquid and the oxides in order to address the nozzle clogging challenges, and thereby optimize cast iron and steel production. This paper presents a methodology for describing these interactions by combining the materials' dielectric responses, computed within the density functional theory, with the Casimir-Lifshitz dispersion forces to generate the Hamaker constants. The approach provides a comprehensive understanding of the wettability of iron against these refractory oxides, revealing the complex relation between molecular and macroscopic properties. Our theoretically determined crystalline structures are confirmed by room-temperature X-ray diffraction, and the contact angles of liquid iron on the oxides are validated with a sessile drop system at the temperature 1823 K. For comparison, we also present the wettability of the oxides by a liquid tin-bismuth alloy. The findings are essential in advancing the fundamental understanding of interfacial interactions in metallurgical science, and are also pivotal in driving the development of more efficient and reliable steelmaking processes.

Title: Polarons in atomic gases and two-dimensional semiconductors
Authors: Pietro Massignan, Richard Schmidt, Grigori E. Astrakharchik, Ataç İmamoglu, Martin Zwierlein, Jan J. Arlt, Georg M. Bruun
Abstract: In this work we provide a comprehensive review of theoretical and experimental studies of the properties of polarons formed by mobile impurities strongly interacting with quantum many-body systems. We present a unified perspective on the universal concepts and theoretical techniques used to characterize polarons in two distinct platforms, ultracold atomic gases and atomically-thin transition metal dichalcogenides, which are linked by many deep parallels. We review polarons in both fermionic and bosonic environments, highlighting their similarities and differences including the intricate interplay between few- and many-body physics. Various kinds of polarons with long-range interactions or in magnetic backgrounds are discussed, and the theoretical and experimental progress towards understanding interactions between polarons is described. We outline how polaron physics, regarded as the low density limit of quantum mixtures, provides fundamental insights regarding the phase diagram of complex condensed matter systems. Furthermore, we describe how polarons may serve as quantum sensors of many-body physics in complex environments. Our work highlights the open problems, identifies new research directions and provides a comprehensive framework for this rapidly evolving research field.

Title: Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless region and magnetization plateaus in easy-axis triangular weak-dimer antiferromaget K$_2$Co$_2$(SeO$_3$)$_3$
Authors: Ying Fu, Han Ge, Jian Chen, Jie Xiao, Yi Tan, Le Wang, Junfeng Wang, Chao Dong, Zhe Qu, Miao He, Chuanying Xi, Langsheng Ling, Bin Xi, Jia-Wei Mei
Abstract: We investigate the magnetic phase diagram of the bilayer triangular antiferromagnet K$_2$Co$_2$(SeO$_3$)$_3$, unveiling a rich interplay between geometric frustration, bilayer coupling, and symmetry-driven phenomena. High-field magnetization measurements reveal fractional magnetization plateaus at 1/3, 1/2, 2/3, and 5/6 of the saturation magnetization. To elucidate the experimental magnetic phase diagram at low fields, we propose that K$_2$Co$_2$(SeO$_3$)$_3$ can be described as an easy-axis triangular weak-dimer antiferromagnet. We emphasize the critical role of the emergent $U(1) \otimes S_3$ symmetry, where $S_3 = \mathbb{Z}_3 \otimes \mathbb{Z}_2^d$, in determining the magnetic phases at low fields. The remarkable agreement between the experimental and theoretical phase diagrams suggests that the phase transitions are governed by this symmetry. Notably, our combined experimental and theoretical results identify a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) phase region at finite fields. These findings provide new insights into the phase structure of frustrated magnets and establish K$_2$Co$_2$(SeO$_3$)$_3$ as a compelling platform for exploring unconventional quantum phenomena in $U(1) \otimes S_3$ systems.

Title: Advancements and Challenges in Sintering Cr4+:YAG Ceramics: A Comprehensive Review on Transparent Ceramic Technology for Q-switched Lasers
Authors: Mykhailo Chaika
Abstract: The resent progress in the technology of transparent ceramics extends the application of CW and pulsed lasers. The parameters of the transparent ceramics are comparable with the single crystals both for active elements (Nd:YAG, Yb:YAG, etc.) and passive Q-switchers such as Cr4+:YAG. Despite the reaching of considerable progress, the sintering of Cr4+:YAG remains a challenge up to now. Up to the present the influence of the CaO, MgO and Cr2O3 additives on the sintering process is poorly understander. Moreover, there is an absence of the unified model of Cr4+ ions formations in YAG ceramics. This factor limits the progress in the development of Cr4+:YAG ceramics. This review focused on the influence of the single additives and their combinations on the sintering trajectory of tetravalent chromium - doped YAG ceramics and the Cr4+ ions formation.

Title: Optimal paths and dynamical symmetry breaking in the current fluctuations of driven diffusive media
Authors: Pablo I. Hurtado
Abstract: Large deviation theory provides a framework to understand macroscopic fluctuations and collective phenomena in many-body nonequilibrium systems in terms of microscopic dynamics. In these lecture notes we discuss the large deviation statistics of the current, a central observable out of equilibrium, using mostly macroscopic fluctuation theory (MFT) but also microscopic spectral methods. Special emphasis is put on describing the optimal path leading to a rare fluctuation, as well as on different dynamical symmetry breaking phenomena that appear at the fluctuating level. We start with an overview of trajectory statistics in driven diffusive systems as described by MFT. We discuss the additivity principle, a simplifying conjecture to compute the current distribution in one-dimensional nonequilibrium systems, and extend this idea to higher dimensions, where the nonlocal structure of the optimal current vector field becomes crucial. Next we explore dynamical phase transitions (DPTs) in current fluctuations, which manifest as symmetry-breaking events in trajectory statistics. These include particle-hole symmetry-breaking DPTs in open channels, for which we work out a Landau-like theory as well as the joint statistics of the current and the order parameter. Time-translation symmetry-breaking DPTs in periodic systems are also discussed, where coherent traveling condensates emerge to facilitate current deviations. We also discuss the microscopic spectral mechanism leading to these DPTs, which is linked to an emerging degeneracy of the leading eigenspace. Using this spectral perspective, we find the signatures of the recently discovered time-crystal phases of matter in traveling-wave DPTs, and use Doob's transform to propose a packing-field mechanism to create programmable time-crystals in driven systems. Finally, we address open challenges and future directions in this rapidly evolving field.

Title: Supersolid dipolar phases in planar geometry: effects of tilted polarization
Authors: Daniel Lima, Matheus Grossklags, Vinicius Zampronio, Fabio Cinti, Alejandro Mendoza-Coto
Abstract: The behavior of dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates in planar geometries is investigated, focusing on the effects of the polarization orientation. While perpendicular polarization produces a phase diagram with hexagonal, stripes, and honeycomb phases ending at a single critical point, the presence of an in-plane polarization component transforms the critical point into three critical lines, separating two phases at a time and changing radically the appearance of the phase diagram. All transition lines contain first- and second-order regions, while the phase diagram itself shows a resemblance with those displayed by quasi-one-dimensional dipolar systems. Finally, we investigate the effect of introducing an in-plane polarization on the structural properties of the phases and determine the superfluid fraction. Our results show that this process induces an axial deformation on the hexagonal and honeycomb phases, resulting in an anisotropic behavior in the long distance properties of the system like superfluidity. We expect that the rich phenomenology observed provides motivation for new experiments and theoretical works.

Title: Aging of colloidal gels in microgravity
Authors: Swagata S. Datta, Waad Paliwal, Eric R. Weeks
Abstract: We study the aging of colloidal gels using light microscopy movies of depletion gels from the International Space Station. Under such microgravity conditions, we observe a slowdown in particle dynamics consistent with gel aging. Stronger attractive forces promote the formation of thicker gel strands over time. The samples are bidisperse, composed of particles with a size ratio 1.2. Larger particles experience stronger depletion forces, which lead to a large first-neighbor peak in the pair correlation function $g(r)$ due to the prevalence of large-large particle contacts. As the gel ages, small mobile particles are incorporated into the gel structure. The changes in gel structure correlate with a slow power-law decay in particle motion, observed over nearly two orders of magnitude of time scales in microgravity experiments. Additionally, through complementary ground-based experiments, we compare two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) images of depletion colloidal gels. While microgravity gel data are limited to 2D projections, ground-based data establish a correspondence between the 2D and 3D $g(r)$ peak heights. Our results provide new insights into how colloidal gels age in the absence of gravitational collapse.

Title: Active particle in a very thin interfacial droplet
Authors: Airi N. Kato, Kaili Xie, Benjamin Gorin, Jean-Michel Rampnoux, Hamid Kellay
Abstract: A single light-driven Janus particle confined in a very thin oil droplet at an air--water interface displays intriguing dynamics. While laser activation induces rapid horizontal motion (1mm/s--1cm/s) by thermal Marangoni flow, the particle exhibits unexpected periodic circular motions or intermittent irregular motions. We show that the periodic trajectories are the result of a coupling between the self-propulsion of the particle and the spatiotemporal droplet thickness changes. We propose a simple model where the properties of the active particle trajectories are governed by capillary forces and torques due to the confinement of the particle in the thin droplet.

Title: Stacking disorder in novel ABAC-stacked brochantite

Abstract: In geometrically frustrated magnetic systems, weak interactions or slight changes to the structure can tip the delicate balance of exchange interactions, sending the system into a different ground state. Brochantite, Cu$_4$SO$_4$(OH)$_6$, has a copper sublattice composed of distorted triangles, making it a likely host for frustrated magnetism, but exhibits stacking disorder. The lack of synthetic single crystals has limited research on the magnetism in brochantite to powders and natural mineral crystals. We grew crystals which we find to be a new polytype with a tendency toward ABAC stacking and some anion disorder, alongside the expected stacking disorder. Comparison to previous results on natural mineral specimens suggests that cation disorder is more deleterious to the magnetism than anion and stacking disorder. Our specific heat data suggest a double transition on cooling into the magnetically ordered state.

Title: Approaching optimal microwave-acoustic transduction on lithium niobate using SQUID arrays
Authors: A. Hugot, Q. Greffe, G. Julie, E. Eyraud, F. Balestro, J. J. Viennot
Abstract: Electronic devices exploiting acoustic vibrations are ubiquitous in classical and quantum technologies. Central to these devices is the transducer, which enables the exchange of signals between electrical and acoustic networks. Among the various transduction mechanisms, piezoelectricity remains the most widely used. However, conventional piezoelectric transducers are limited to either small efficiencies or narrow bandwidths and they typically operate at fixed frequency. These limitations restrict their utility in many applications. Here we propose and demonstrate a robust strategy to realize piezoelectric microwave-acoustic transduction close to the maximal efficiency-bandwidth product of lithium niobate. We use SQUID arrays to transform the large complex impedance of wide-band interdigital transducers into 50 $\Omega$ and demonstrate unprecedented efficiency$\times$bandwidth $\approx$ 440 MHz, with a maximum efficiency of 62% at 5.7 GHz. Moreover, leveraging the flux dependence of SQUIDs, we realize transducers with in-situ tunability across nearly an octave around 5.5 GHz. Our transducer can be readily connected to other superconducting quantum devices, with applications in microwave-to-optics conversion schemes, quantum-limited phonon detection, or acoustic spectroscopy in the 4-8 GHz band.

Title: Weak electronic correlations in the cobalt oxychalcogenide superconductor Na2CoSe2O
Authors: Zhenchao Wu, Yingying Cao, Hong-Gang Luo, Yi-feng Yang
Abstract: Motivated by the newly discovered Co-based superconductor Na2CoSe2O, we performed systematic calculations of its electronic band structures using the density functional theory (DFT) plus the dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) approaches. Our comparative studies reveal weakly correlated and itinerant nature of the Co-3d electrons and show no sign of fluctuating local moments as expected in many other unconventional superconductors, although the Co eg orbitals are close to half filling. These suggest that Na2CoSe2O is a normal paramagnetic metal and its superconductivity might not be of strongly correlated nature, contrary to the initial speculation. We suggest future investigations of electron-phonon interactions to clarify its pairing mechanism.

Title: Annealing-Induced Magnetic Modulation in Co- and Y-doped CeO2: Insights from Experiments and DFT
Authors: Hemant Arora, Atul Bandyopadhyay, Arup Samanta
Abstract: The potential applications of dilute magnetic oxides (DMOs) in magneto-optic and spintronic devices have attracted significant attention, although understanding their magnetic behavior is complex due to intricate interactions of intrinsic defects. The present study aims to investigate the effect of different annealing environments on the magnetic properties of polycrystalline transition metal cation (Co and Y) doped CeO2 DMO with a 5% doping concentration of transition metal (TM). The objective is to investigate the defect interactions within the lattice through a comprehensive investigation involving structural characterizations, magnetic measurements, and first principle calculations. The results show that the Ar/H2 annealing environment induced more oxygen vacancies than air-annealed samples. Consequently, field-dependent magnetization measurements revealed above-room-temperature ferromagnetism (RTFM) in both un-doped and TM-doped CeO2. The ferromagnetic (FM) properties of CeO2 resulted from carrier-trapped vacancy centers facilitating exchange interactions between the spins of magnetic ions. The Langevin field profile indicated that TM-doped CeO2 formed more bound magnetic polarons (BMPs) during annealing in an Ar/H2 environment, which contributed to the enhanced ferromagnetism. Similarly, enhancement in the magnetic properties with increasing oxygen vacancies is observed through first principle calculations. This suggests the potential for optimizing the magnetic properties of DMOs through controlled annealing processes.

Abstract: Well-mixed chemical reaction networks (CRNs) contain many distinct chemical species with copy numbers that fluctuate in correlated ways. While those correlations are typically monitored via Monte Carlo sampling of stochastic trajectories, there is interest in systematically approximating the joint distribution over the exponentially large number of possible microstates using tensor networks or tensor trains. We exploit the tensor network strategy to determine when the steady state of a seven-species gene toggle switch CRN model supports bistability as a function of two decomposition rates, both parameters of the kinetic model. We highlight how the tensor network solution captures the effects of stochastic fluctuations, going beyond mean field and indeed deviating meaningfully from a mean-field analysis. The work furthermore develops and demonstrates several technical advances that will allow steady-states of broad classes of CRNs to be computed in a manner conducive to parameter exploration. We show that the steady-state distributions can be computed via the ordinary density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm despite having a non-Hermitian rate operator with a small spectral gap, we illustrate how that steady-state distribution can be efficiently projected to an order parameter that identifies bimodality, and we employ excited-state DMRG to calculate a relaxation timescale for the bistability.

Title: Geometric effects in the Dyakonov-Shur theory of Teraherz photodetection
Authors: Riccardo Riolo, Marco Polini, Riccardo Mannella, Andrea Tomadin
Abstract: Nonlinear resonances of plasma waves in field-effect transitors enable a well-known photodetection mechanism, first introduced by Dyakonov and Shur in the Nineties, especially suited to the Terahertz (THz) frequency range. Theoretical analyses of the mechanism always assume that the gate of the transistor, which is coupled to the antenna receiving the THz signal, is as long as the channel itself, at odds with typical experimental devices, where short gates are usually employed, e.g. due to fabrication constraints. In this work we overcome this limitation and provide a complete theory of Dyakonov--Shur photodetection in the presence of short gates. We develop our theory in such a general fashion that allows us to also treat the case in which multiple gates are present. We find that a sub-optimal positioning of the gates can substantially decrease the detection efficiency of the device and provide a compact analytical formula to quickly estimate the optimal gate position.

Title: Mixed anion control of enhanced negative thermal expansion in the oxysulfide of PbTiO3

Abstract: The rare physical property of negative thermal expansion (NTE) is intriguing because materials with large NTE over a wide temperature range can serve as high-performance thermal expansion compensators. However, applications of NTE are hindered by the fact that most of the available NTE materials show small magnitudes of NTE, and/or NTE occurs only in a narrow temperature range. Herein, for the first time, we investigated the effect of anion substitution instead of general Pb/Ti-site substitutions on the thermal expansion properties of a typical ferroelectric NTE material, PbTiO3. Intriguingly, the substitution of S for O in PbTiO3 further increases the tetragonality of PbTiO3. Consequently, an unusually enhanced NTE with an average volumetric coefficient of thermal expansion $\bar{\alpha}_V$ = -2.50 $\times$ 10$^{-5}$/K was achieved over a wide temperature range (300 -- 790 K), which is contrasted to that of pristine PbTiO3 ($\bar{\alpha}_V$ = -1.99 $\times$ 10$^{-5}$/K RT -- 763 K). The intensified NTE is attributed to the enhanced hybridization between Pb/Ti and O/S atoms by the substitution of S, as evidenced by our theoretical investigations. We therefore demonstrate a new technique for introducing mixed anions to achieve large NTE over a wide temperature range in PbTiO3-based ferroelectrics.

Title: Magnetic injection photocurrents in valley polarized states of twisted bilayer graphene
Authors: Fernando Peñaranda, Héctor Ochoa, Fernando de Juan
Abstract: Magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene displays a complex phase diagram as a function of flat band filling, featuring compressibility cascade transitions and a variety of competing ground states with broken spin, valley and point group symmetries. Recent THz photocurrent spectroscopy experiments have shown a dependence on the filling which is not consistent with the simplest cascade picture of sequential filling of equivalent flat bands. In this work, we show that when time-reversal symmetry is broken due to valley polarization, a magnetic injection photocurrent develops which can be used to distinguish different spin-valley polarization scenarios. Using the topological heavy fermion model we compute both shift and injection currents as a function of filling and argue that current experiments can be used to determine the spontaneous valley polarization.

Title: Large moir\'{e} superstructure of stacked incommensurate charge density waves

Abstract: Recent advances in van der Waals heterostructures have opened the new frontier of moiré physics, whereby tuning the interlayer twist angle or adjusting lattice parameter mismatch have led to a plethora of exotic phenomena such as unconventional superconductivity and fractional quantum spin Hall effect. We extend the concept of moiré engineering to materials that host incommensurate orders, where we discovered a long-period, thermally-hysteretic moiré superlattice in a layered charge density wave (CDW) compound, EuTe$_\text{4}$. Using high-momentum-resolution X-ray diffraction performed on ultrathin flakes, we found two coexisting, incommensurate CDWs with slightly mismatched in-plane wavevectors. The interaction between these two CDWs leads to their joint commensuration with the high-symmetry lattice as well as a large moiré superstructure with an in-plane period of 13.6~nm. Due to different out-of-plane orders of the incommensurate CDWs, the moiré superstructure exhibits a clear thermal hysteresis, accounting for the large hysteresis observed in electrical resistivity and numerous metastable states induced by light or electrical pulses. Our findings pave the way for a new development in moiré engineering based on an incommensurate lattice. They further highlight the important role of interlayer ordering in determining the macroscopic properties of these stacked incommensurate structures.

Title: Hybridization between surface flat bands and bulk bands in the topological nodal-line semimetal Sn$_{0.15}$NbSe$_{1.75}$ probed via soft-point-contact spectroscopy
Authors: K. Kumarasinghe, C. Dissanayake, R. Munir, M. Tomlinson, Y. Nakajima
Abstract: We report a detailed study of soft-point-contact spectroscopy of the superconducting topological nodal-line semimetal Sn$_{0.15}$NbSe$_{1.75}$ with the superconducting transition temperature $T_{c}=9.5$ K. In the normal state, we observe prominent asymmetric double peaks in the differential conductance $dI/dV$. The asymmetric $dI/dV$ curves are attributed to Fano resonance, quantum interference between two distinct tunneling paths of transmitting electrons into flat energy bands and dispersive bands. A phenomenological double Fano resonance model reveals the hybridization between these bands below the hybridization temperature $T_{\mathrm{hyb}}=23$ K. This hybridization drives an opening of a pseudogap below a characteristic temperature $T_{\mathrm{PG}}=6.8$ K. In the superconducting state, we observe an unusual upper critical field that increases linearly with decreasing temperatures from $0.4T_{c}$ to $0.01T_{c}$, suggestive of a possible exotic superconducting state. Our results suggest the presence of surface flat energy bands that stem from nontrivial topological nature of nodal lines in the bulk band structure and the hybridization between the surface flat bands and bulk bands in Sn$_{0.15}$NbSe$_{1.75}$.

Title: Exact Parent Hamiltonians for All Landau Level States in a Half-flux Lattice
Authors: Xin Shen, Guangyue Ji, Jinjie Zhang, David E. Palomino, Bruno Mera, Tomoki Ozawa, Jie Wang
Abstract: Realizing topological flat bands with tailored single-particle Hilbert spaces is a critical step toward exploring many-body phases, such as those featuring anyonic excitations. One prominent example is the Kapit-Mueller model, a variant of the Harper-Hofstadter model that stabilizes lattice analogs of the lowest Landau level states. The Kapit-Mueller model is constructed based on the Poisson summation rule, an exact lattice sum rule for coherent states. In this work, we consider higher Landau-level generalizations of the Poisson summation rule, from which we derive families of parent Hamiltonians on a half-flux lattice which have exact flat bands whose flatband wavefunctions are lattice version of higher Landau level states. Focusing on generic Bravais lattices with only translation and inversion symmetries, we discuss how these symmetries enforced gaplessness and singular points for odd Landau level series, and how to achieve fully gapped parent Hamiltonians by mixing even and odd series. Our model points to a large class of tight-binding models with suitable energetic and quantum geometries that are potentially useful for realizing non-Abelian fractionalized states when interactions are included. The model exhibits fast decay hopping amplitudes, making it potentially realizable with neutral atoms in optical lattices.

Title: Improvement of Data Analytics Techniques in Reflection High Energy Electron Diffraction to Enable Machine Learning
Authors: Patrick T. Gemperline, Rajendra Paudel, Rama K. Vasudevan, Ryan B. Comes
Abstract: Perovskite oxides such as LaFeO$_3$ are a well-studied family of materials that possess a wide range of useful and novel properties. Successfully synthesizing perovskite oxide samples usually requires a significant number of growth attempts and a detailed film characterization on each sample to find the optimal growth window of a material. The most common real-time \textit{in situ} diagnostic technique available during molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) synthesis is reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED). Conventional use of RHEED allows a highly experienced operator to determine growth rate by monitoring intensity osciallations and make some qualitative observations during growth, such as recognizing the sample has become amorphous or recognizing that large islands have formed on the surface. However, due to a lack of theoretical understanding of the diffraction patterns, finer, more precise levels of observations are challenging. To address these limitations, we implement new data analytics techniques in the growth of three LaFeO$_3$ samples on Nb-doped SrTiO$_3$ by MBE. These techniques improve our ability to perform unsupervised machine learning using principal component analysis (PCA) and k-means clustering by using drift correction to overcome sample or stage motion during growth and intensity transformations that highlight more subtle features in the images such as Kikuchi bands. With this approach, we enable the first demonstration of PCA and k-means across multiple samples, allowing for quantitative comparison of RHEED videos for two LaFeO$_3$ film samples. These capabilities set the stage for real-time processing of RHEED data during growth to enable machine learning-accelerated film synthesis.

Title: Active contacts create controllable friction
Authors: Rohan Shah, Nick Gravish
Abstract: Sliding friction between two dry surfaces is reasonably described by the speed-independent Amonton-Coulomb friction force law. However, there are many situations where the frictional contact points between two surfaces are "active" and may not all be moving at the same relative speed. In this work we study the sliding friction properties of a system with multiple active contacts each with independent and controllable speed. We demonstrate that multiple active contacts can produce controllable speed-dependent sliding friction forces, despite each individual contact exhibiting a speed-independent friction. We study in experiment a rotating carousel with ten speed-controlled wheels in frictional contact with the ground. We first vary the contact speeds and demonstrate that the equilibrium system speed is the median of the active contact speeds. Next we directly measure the ground reaction forces and observe how the contact speeds can control the force-speed curve of the system. In the final experiments we demonstrate how control of the force-speed curve can create sliding friction with a controllable effective viscosity and controllable sliding friction coefficient. Surprisingly, we are able to demonstrate that frictional contacts can create near frictionless sliding with appropriate force-speed control. By revealing how active contacts can shape the force-speed behavior of dry sliding friction systems we can better understand animal and robot locomotion, and furthermore open up opportunities for new engineered surfaces to control sliding friction.

Title: Higher Representations and Quark Confinement
Authors: Finn Gagliano, Andrea Grigoletto, Kantaro Ohmori
Abstract: The concept of a (de)confined phase in QFT is well-defined in the presence of $1$-form symmetries and their spontaneous symmetry breaking. However, in scenarios where such symmetries are absent, confinement is not a well-defined phase property. In this work, we propose that, when restricting to a specific submanifold of the parameter space - namely at zero temperature and fixed quark mass - the confined and color-superconducting (CSC) phases of scalar QCD can be distinguished through the different organization of their spectra, as seen from the perspective of the baryon symmetry. The analysis is performed in terms of an appropriate higher-categorical representation theory, recently developed for generalized symmetries. Consistent with expectations, we find that the confined phase permits only particles with integer baryon charges, while the CSC phase is characterized by the coexistence of bare quarks and vortices, exhibiting a non-trivial Aharonov-Bohm effect between these excitations.

Title: Thermodynamics of the Page curve in Markovian open quantum systems
Authors: Jonas Glatthard
Abstract: Typically, the von Neumann entropy of a subsystem increases until it plateaus at the thermal value. Under some circumstances, however, the intermediate value can dwarf the final value, even if the subsystem starts in a pure state. A famous example in the context of the black hole information paradox is the entropy of the Hawking radiation, where this behaviour is dubbed the Page curve. More generally, this is the case for excited systems weakly coupled to cold reservoirs. Here we study the entropy dynamics for Lindbladian evolution, i.e. open quantum systems in weak contact with Markovian reservoirs. This allows us to study the non-equilibrium thermodynamics of the subsystem entropy decrease and link it to Landauer's principle: the entropy decrease must be accompanied by a heat flow out of the system. We give an analytic expression of the entanglement dynamics for a decaying excitation in a two-level system and study it under equilibration of a localised oscillator. In both cases the Page time occurs when half the initial energy has left the system.

Title: Physics-Aware POD-Based Learning for Ab initio QEM-Galerkin Simulations of Periodic Nanostructures
Authors: Martin Veresko, Yu Liu, Daqing Hou, Ming-Cheng Cheng
Abstract: Quantum nanostructures offer crucial applications in electronics, photonics, materials, drugs, etc. For accurate design and analysis of nanostructures and materials, simulations of the Schrodinger or Schrodinger-like equation are always needed. For large nanostructures, these eigenvalue problems can be computationally intensive. One effective solution is a learning method via Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD), together with ab initio Galerkin projection of the Schrodinger equation. POD-Galerkin projects the problem onto a reduced-order space with the POD basis representing electron wave functions (WFs) guided by the first principles in simulations. To minimize training effort and enhance robustness of POD-Galerkin in larger structures, the quantum element method (QEM) was proposed previously, which partitions nanostructures into generic quantum elements. Larger nanostructures can then be constructed by the trained generic quantum elements, each of which is represented by its POD-Galerkin model. This work investigates QEM-Galerkin thoroughly in multi-element quantum-dot (QD) structures on approaches to further improve training effectiveness and simulation accuracy and efficiency for QEM-Galerkin. To further improve computing speed, POD and Fourier bases for periodic potentials are also examined in QEM-Galerkin simulations. Results indicate that, considering efficiency and accuracy, the POD potential basis is superior to the Fourier potential basis even for periodic potentials. Overall, QEM-Galerkin offers more than a 2-order speedup in computation over direct numerical simulation for multi-element QD structures, and more improvement is observed in a structure comprising more elements.

Title: High-frequency readout free from transmon multi-excitation resonances
Authors: Pavel D. Kurilovich, Thomas Connolly, Charlotte G. L. Bøttcher, Daniel K. Weiss, Sumeru Hazra, Vidul R. Joshi, Andy Z. Ding, Heekun Nho, Spencer Diamond, Vladislav D. Kurilovich, Wei Dai, Valla Fatemi, Luigi Frunzio, Leonid I. Glazman, Michel H. Devoret
Abstract: Quantum computation will rely on quantum error correction to counteract decoherence. Successfully implementing an error correction protocol requires the fidelity of qubit operations to be well-above error correction thresholds. In superconducting quantum computers, measurement of the qubit state remains the lowest-fidelity operation. For the transmon, a prototypical superconducting qubit, measurement is carried out by scattering a microwave tone off the qubit. Conventionally, the frequency of this tone is of the same order as the transmon frequency. The measurement fidelity in this approach is limited by multi-excitation resonances in the transmon spectrum which are activated at high readout power. These resonances excite the qubit outside of the computational basis, violating the desired quantum non-demolition character of the measurement. Here, we find that strongly detuning the readout frequency from that of the transmon exponentially suppresses the strength of spurious multi-excitation resonances. By increasing the readout frequency up to twelve times the transmon frequency, we achieve a quantum non-demolition measurement fidelity of 99.93% with a residual probability of leakage to non-computational states of only 0.02%.

Title: Singular Spectrum Analysis of Time-series Data from Time-dependent density-functional theory in Real-time
Authors: Naoki Tani, Satoru S. Kano, Yasunari Zempo
Abstract: This paper introduces a spectral analysis of time-seires data derived from real-time time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) using Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA). TDDFT is a robust method for obtaining molecular excited states and optical spectra by tracking the time evolution of dynamical dipole moments. However, the spectral resolution can be compromised when Fourier transformation's total time duration is insufficient. SSA enabled the extraction of specific oscillation components from the time-series data, facilitating the generation of higher-precision spectra. Even with relatively short time-series dataset, the predictive extension of SSA yielded high-resolution spectra, demonstrating substantial agreement with results obtained through conventional methods. The efficacy of this approach was validated for several small molecules, including ethylene, benzene, and others. SSA's ability to conduct detailed spectral anasysis in specific energy regions enhance spectral resolution and facilitates the clarification of oscillation components within these regions. Real-time TDDFT combined with SSA provides a new analytical method for analyzing the optical properties of molecules, significantly improving the accuracy of the analysis of emission and absorption spectra analysis. This method is expected to have various applications.

Title: Variational method for $\mathbb{Z}_K$ wavefunctions in spin-$J$ PXP model
Authors: Zhigang Hu, Biao Wu
Abstract: We investigate the approach of time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) for the one-dimensional spin-$J$ PXP model with detuning, which is relevant for programmable Rydberg atom arrays. The variational manifold is chosen as the minimally entangled $\mathbb{Z}_K$ matrix-product-states (MPS). We demonstrate that variational dynamics and variational error can be expressed as rapidly convergent series in the thermodynamic limit. In particular, for $J=1/2$ and the limiting case $J\rightarrow \infty$, the TDVP results become exact and significantly simplified.

Title: Slowly decaying strain solitons in nonlinear viscoelastic waveguides
Authors: F. E. Garbuzov, Y. M. Beltukov
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the modeling of longitudinal strain waves in a rod composed of a nonlinear viscoelastic material characterized by frequency-dependent second- and third-order elastic constants. We demonstrate that long waves in such a material can be effectively described by a damped Boussinesq-type equation for the longitudinal strain, incorporating dissipation through retarded operators. Using the existing theory of solitary wave solutions in nearly integrable systems, we derive a slowly-decaying strain soliton solution to this equation. The derived soliton characteristics are shown to be in a good agreement with results from full 3D simulations. We demonstrate the importance of taking into account the frequency dependence of third-order elastic constants for the description of strain solitons.

Title: Chiral Dissociation of Bound Photon Pairs for a Non-Hermitian Skin Effect
Authors: Jiaming Shi, Alexander N. Poddubny
Abstract: We theoretically study the bound states of interacting photons propagating in a waveguide chirally coupled to an array of atoms. We demonstrate that the bound photon pairs can concentrate at the edge of the array and link this to the non-Hermitian skin effect. Unlike tight-binding non-Hermitian setups, the bound states in the waveguide-coupled array exhibit infinite radiative lifetimes when the array has an infinite size. However, in a finite array, non-Hermiticity and localization of bound pairs emerge due to their chiral dissociation into scattering states. Counterintuitively, when the photons are preferentially emitted to the right, the bound pairs are localized at the left edge of the array and vice versa.

Title: The quantum relative entropy of the Schwarzschild black-hole and the area law
Authors: Ginestra Bianconi
Abstract: The area law obeyed by the thermodynamic entropy of black holes is one of the fundamental results relating gravity to statistical mechanics. In this work we provide a derivation of the area law for the quantum relative entropy of the Schwarzschild black-hole for arbitrary Schwarzschild radius. The quantum relative entropy between the metric of the manifold and the metric induced by the geometry and the matter field has been proposed in G. Bianconi ``Gravity from entropy" (2024) as the action for entropic quantum gravity leading to modified Einstein equations. The quantum relative entropy generalizes Araki entropy and treats the metrics between zero-forms, one-forms, and two-forms as quantum operators. Although the Schwarzschild metric is not an exact solution of the modified Einstein equations of the entropic quantum gravity, it is an approximate solution valid in the low coupling limit. Here we show that the quantum relative entropy associated to the Schwarzschild metric obeys the area law for large Schwarzschild radius. We provide a full statistical mechanics interpretation of the results.

Title: From Weyl Anomaly to Defect Supersymmetric R\'enyi Entropy and Casimir Energy
Authors: Zi-Xiao Huang, Ma-Ke Yuan, Yang Zhou
Abstract: We present a closed-form expression for the contribution of surface defects to the supersymmetric Rényi entropy in six-dimensional $(2,0)$ theories. Our results show that this defect contribution is a linear function of $1/n$ and is directly proportional to $2b-d_2$, where $b$ and $d_2$ are the surface defect Weyl anomaly coefficients. We also derive a closed-form expression for the defect contribution to the supersymmetric Casimir energy, which simplifies to $-d_2$ (up to a proportionality constant) in the chiral algebra limit.

Title: Unifying quantum stochastic methods using Wick's theorem on the Keldysh contour
Authors: Vasco Cavina, Antonio D'Abbruzzo, Vittorio Giovannetti
Abstract: We present a new method based on the Keldysh formalism to derive stochastic master equations for the non-Markovian evolution of a quantum system coupled to a Gaussian environment. Using this approach, we develop a compact expression for the propagator of the system's dynamics, naturally formulated on the Keldysh contour. This expression is shown to be equivalent to other formulations, such as the stochastic von Neumann equation (SVNE). A key advantage of our method is its flexibility, as it can be easily adapted to account for initial system-bath correlations, and its simplicity, as it does not rely on path integration techniques or superoperator representations, unlike previous approaches. The insight offered by our technique allows us to make some considerations on the nature of the noises appearing in the SVNE. We prove that the solution of the SVNE can be written in terms of a single physical noise without loss of information. We then envision a semiclassical scenario in which such noise can be interpreted in terms of an initial measurement process on the environment.

Abstract: Approximating the ground state of many-body systems is a key computational bottleneck underlying important applications in physics and chemistry. It has long been viewed as a promising application for quantum computers. The most widely known quantum algorithm for ground state approximation, quantum phase estimation, is out of reach of current quantum processors due to its high circuit-depths. Quantum diagonalization algorithms based on subspaces represent alternatives to phase estimation, which are feasible for pre-fault-tolerant and early-fault-tolerant quantum computers. Here, we introduce a quantum diagonalization algorithm which combines two key ideas on quantum subspaces: a classical diagonalization based on quantum samples, and subspaces constructed with quantum Krylov states. We prove that our algorithm converges in polynomial time under the working assumptions of Krylov quantum diagonalization and sparseness of the ground state. We then show numerical investigations of lattice Hamiltonians, which indicate that our method can outperform existing Krylov quantum diagonalization in the presence of shot noise, making our approach well-suited for near-term quantum devices. Finally, we carry out the largest ground-state quantum simulation of the single-impurity Anderson model on a system with $41$ bath sites, using $85$ qubits and up to $6 \cdot 10^3$ two-qubit gates on a Heron quantum processor, showing excellent agreement with density matrix renormalization group calculations.

Title: Bidirectional microwave-optical conversion using an integrated barium-titanate transducer
Authors: Charles Möhl, Annina Riedhauser, Max Glantschnig, Daniele Caimi, Ute Drechsler, Antonis Olziersky, Deividas Sabonis, David Indolese, Thomas Karg, Paul Seidler
Abstract: Efficient, low-noise, high-bandwidth transduction between optical and microwave photons is key to long-range quantum communication between distant superconducting quantum processors. Recent demonstrations of microwave-optical tranduction using the broadband direct electro-optic (Pockels) effect in optical thin films made of AlN or LiNbO$_3$ have shown promise. Due to the quadratic scaling of transduction efficiency with the electro-optic coefficient, material classes with stronger Pockels effects, such as the perovskite titanates BaTiO$_3$ or SrTiO$_3$, may unlock new performance regimes for future transducers. However, these materials require adapted designs and fabrication approaches due to their nonlinear and, in some cases, hysteretic electro-optic response, as well as limited process compatibility. Here, we engineer an on-chip, triply resonant transducer comprising low-loss BaTiO$_3$-on-SiO$_2$ waveguides monolithically integrated with a superconducting microwave resonator made of Nb. Exploiting the bias-induced Pockels effect of BaTiO$_3$, we demonstrate bidirectional microwave-optical transduction at millikelvin temperatures and total off-chip efficiencies reaching $1\times10^{-6}$ in pulsed operation. We establish a device concept permitting in-situ poling of the ferroelectric material without introducing excess microwave loss and tuning of the optical system without sacrificing microwave-optical overlap. Using a fully subtractive process, we fabricate Nb air bridges for crossings of conductors and both air- and oxide-clad optical waveguides. We investigate optically-induced heating through pulsed optical pumping, revealing fast thermalization and quasiparticle resilience of the microwave resonator. Our transducer concept is applicable to other materials with a large bias-induced Pockels effect and paves the way for efficient, low-power quantum interconnects.

Title: Selective and Collective Actuation in Active Solids
Authors: P. Baconnier, D. Shohat, C. Hernandèz, C. Coulais, V. Démery, G. Düring, O. Dauchot
Abstract: Active solids consist of elastically coupled out-of-equilibrium units performing work. They are central to autonomous processes, such as locomotion, self-oscillations and rectification, in biological systems,designer materials and robotics. Yet, the feedback mechanism between elastic and active forces, and the possible emergence of collective behaviours in a mechanically stable elastic solid remains elusive. Here we introduce a minimal realization of an active elastic solid, in which we characterize the emergence of selective and collective actuation and fully map out the interplay between activity, elasticity and geometry. Polar active agents exert forces on the nodes of a two dimensional elastic lattice. The resulting displacement field nonlinearly reorients the active agents. For large enough coupling, a collective oscillation of the lattice nodes around their equilibrium position emerges. Only a few elastic modes are actuated and, crucially, they are not necessarily the lowest energy ones. Combining experiments with the numerical and theoretical analysis of an agents model, we unveil the bifurcation scenario and the selection mechanism by which the collective actuation takes place. Our findings may provide a new mechanism for oscillatory dynamics in biological tissues and specifically confluent cell monolayers. The present selection mechanism may also be advantageous in providing meta-materials, with bona fide autonomy.

Title: Statistics of the non-zero eigenvalues and singular values of low-rank random matrices with non-negative entries
Authors: Mark J. Crumpton, Yan V. Fyodorov, Pierpaolo Vivo
Abstract: We compute analytically the probability distribution and moments of the sum and product of the non-zero eigenvalues and singular values of random matrices with (i) non-negative entries, (ii) fixed rank, and (iii) prescribed sums of the entries in each row. Applications of such matrices are discussed in the context of Markov chains, economics and social networks to name a few. All results are valid at finite matrix size and are given in terms of the statistics of vectors of general Dirichlet random variables. Analytical results are corroborated by numerical simulations throughout with excellent agreement.

Title: Topological origin of non-Hermitian skin effect in higher dimensions and uniform spectra
Authors: Haiping Hu
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect is an iconic phenomenon characterized by the aggregation of eigenstates near the system boundaries in non-Hermitian systems. While extensively studied in one dimension, understanding the skin effect and extending the non-Bloch band theory to higher dimensions encounters a formidable challenge, primarily due to infinite lattice geometries or open boundary conditions. This work adopts a point-gap perspective and unveils that non-Hermitian skin effect in all spatial dimensions originates from point gaps. We introduce the concept of uniform spectra and reveal that regardless of lattice geometry, their energy spectra are universally given by the uniform spectra, even though their manifestations of skin modes may differ. Building on the uniform spectra, we demonstrate how to account for the skin effect with generic lattice cuts and establish the connections of skin modes across different geometric shapes via momentum-basis transformations. Our findings highlight the pivotal roles point gaps play, offering a unified understanding of the topological origin of non-Hermitian skin effect in all dimensions.

Title: Thermodynamic nature of irreversibility in active matter
Authors: Lennart Dabelow, Ralf Eichhorn
Abstract: Active matter describes systems whose constituents convert energy from their surroundings into directed motion, such as bacteria or catalytic colloids. We establish a thermodynamic law for dilute suspensions of interacting active particles in the form of a remarkable direct link between their dynamics and thermodynamics: The rate at which irreversibility is built up in the non-equilibrium steady state is a state function of the thermodynamic system parameters, namely the number of particles, the temperature and, as a distinctive characteristic of active matter, the swim pressure. Like in the famous fluctuation theorems of stochastic thermodynamics, irreversibility is a dynamical measure that quantifies the amount by which microscopic particle trajectories break time-reversal symmetry, without reference to the typically unobservable processes underlying self-propulsion. We derive the result for the paradigmatic model of active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particles with short-ranged repulsive interactions. Based on numerical simulations and heuristic arguments, we furthermore present a refined relation whose validity extends from the dilute into the phase-separated (MIPS) regime.

Title: Fate of Bosonic Topological Edge Modes in the Presence of Many-Body Interactions
Authors: Niclas Heinsdorf, Darshan G. Joshi, Hosho Katsura, Andreas P. Schnyder
Abstract: Many magnetic materials are predicted to exhibit bosonic topological edge modes in their excitation spectra, because of the nontrivial topology of their magnon, triplon, or other quasi-particle band structures. However, there is a discrepancy between theory prediction and experimental observation, which suggests some underlying mechanism that intrinsically suppresses the expected experimental signatures, like the thermal Hall current. Many-body interactions that are not accounted for in the non-interacting quasi-particle picture are most often identified as the reason for the absence of the topological edge modes. Here we report persistent bosonic edge modes at the boundaries of a ladder quantum paramagnet with gapped triplon excitations in the presence of the full many-body interaction. We use tensor network methods to resolve topological edge modes in the time-dependent spin-spin correlations and the dynamical structure factor, which is directly accessible experimentally. We further show that signatures of these edge modes survive even when the non-interacting quasi-particle theory breaks down, discuss the topological phase diagram of the model, demonstrate the fractionalization of its low-lying excitations, and propose potential material candidates.

Title: On the engineering of higher-order Van Hove singularities in two dimensions
Authors: Anirudh Chandrasekaran, Luke C. Rhodes, Edgar Abarca Morales, Carolina A. Marques, Phil D.C. King, Peter Wahl, Joseph J. Betouras
Abstract: The properties of correlated electron materials are often intricately linked to Van Hove singularities (VHS) in the vicinity of the Fermi energy. The class of these VHS is of great importance, with higher-order ones -- with power-law divergence in the density of states -- leaving frequently distinct signatures in physical properties. We use a new theoretical method to detect and analyse higher-order VHS (HOVHS) in two-dimensional materials and apply it to the electronic structure of the surface layer of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$. We then constrain a low energy model of the VHS of the surface layer of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ against angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and quasiparticle interference data to analyse the VHS near the Fermi level. We show how these VHS can be engineered into HOVHS.

Authors: Isidora Araya Day, Kostas Vilkelis, Antonio L. R. Manesco, A. Mert Bozkurt, Valla Fatemi, Anton R. Akhmerov
Abstract: We demonstrate that Andreev modes that propagate along a transparent Josephson junction have a perfect transmission at the point where three junctions meet. The chirality and the number of quantized transmission channels is determined by the topology of the Fermi surface and the vorticity of the superconducting phase differences at the trijunction. We explain this chiral adiabatic transmission (CAT) as a consequence of the adiabatic evolution of the scattering modes both in momentum and real space. The dispersion relation of the junction then separates the scattering trajectories by introducing inaccesible regions of phase space. We expect that CAT is observable in nonlocal conductance and thermal transport measurements. Furthermore, because it does not rely on particle-hole symmetry, CAT is also possible to observe directly in metamaterials.

Title: Competing structures in a minimal double-well potential model of condensed matter
Authors: Julyan H. E. Cartwright, Bruno Escribano, Sándalo Roldán-Vargas, C. Ignacio Sainz-Díaz
Abstract: The microscopic structure of several amorphous substances often reveals complex patterns such as medium- or long-range order, spatial heterogeneity, and even local polycrystallinity. To capture all these features, models usually incorporate a refined description of the particle interaction that includes an ad hoc design of the inside of the system constituents, and use temperature as a control parameter. We show that all these features can emerge from a minimal athermal two-dimensional model where particles interact isotropically by a double-well potential, which includes an excluded volume and a maximum coordination number. The rich variety of structural patterns shown by this simple geometrical model apply to a wide range of real systems including water, silicon, and different amorphous materials.

Title: Evidence of enhanced thermopower from emergent local moments in flatbands of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene
Authors: Ayan Ghosh, Souvik Chakraborty, Ranit Dutta, Adhip Agarwala, K. Watanabe, T. Taniguchi, Sumilan Banerjee, Nandini Trivedi, Subroto Mukerjee, Anindya Das
Abstract: Recent experiments on magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBLG) indicate an unusual coexistence of heavy and light electrons, a characteristic of heavy-fermion physics. But a global transport measurement showing clear signatures of strong correlations like local moments (LM) arising from the flatbands is missing. Utilizing thermopower ($V_{Th}$) as a sensitive probe for measuring entropy ($S$), we have extensively studied $V_{Th}$ of MATBLG with filling ($\nu$), temperature ($T$) and magnetic field ($B$), and unveiled the presence of LM through their impact on $S$. While at high $T$, the behavior of $V_{Th}$ and resistance ($R$) are related by the Mott formula, it deviates at lower $T$. Below 120K apart from the Dirac point and full band filling, the resistance exhibits prominent peaks at integer fillings. The $V_{Th}$ however, remains featureless and symmetric across the DP with opposite signs. This disparity implies the dominance of different kinds of carriers in $V_{Th}$ and $R$. The $V_{Th}$ has additional sign changes at $\nu_{cross} \sim \pm 1$. The locations of $\nu_{cross}$ do not change with temperature from $5-60K$. For heavy and light band electrons, it can be shown that the doping profile of the $V_{Th}$, and hence $\nu_{cross}$ is highly sensitive to $T$, and therefore solely the contribution from band electrons does not explain the $V_{Th}$ data. Our data is consistent with the dominant contribution arising from the $S$ of the LMs. Additionally, we have investigated the effect of $B$ on the $V_{Th}$, both $B_{\parallel}$ and $B_{\perp}$ showing 30 and 50$\%$ reduction, respectively, and can be attributed to the partial polarization of the LMs (spin/valley), resulting in decreased $S$. Our $V_{Th}$ results highlight the contribution from LMs arising from flatbands, distinct from the band contributions of heavy and light fermions to the resistivity in MATBLG.

Title: Mean Field Decoupling of Single Impurity Anderson Model through Auxiliary Majorana Fermions
Authors: Irakli Titvinidze, Julian Stobbe, Alexey N. Rubtsov, Georg Rohringer
Abstract: We present a method to study the time evolution of the single impurity Anderson model which exploits a mean field decoupling of the interacting impurity and the non-interacting bath (in form of a chain). This is achieved by the introduction of a pair of auxiliary Majorana fermions between the impurity and the chain. After decoupling, we obtain a self-consistent set of equations for the impurity and chain. First, we study the behavior of the system in equilibrium at zero temperature. We obtain a phase transition as a function of the interaction at the impurity and the coupling between the impurity and the chain between the Kondo regime, where the mean field parameters are zero and, hence, we have a well-defined spin at the impurity, to a phase where mean field parameters acquire finite values leading to a screening of the impurity spin by conduction bath electrons. In the latter case, we observe charge and spin fluctuations at the impurity site. Starting from this equilibrium ground state at zero temperature we quench in the interaction strength at the impurity and/or the hybridization strength between the impurity and the chain and study the time evolution of the system. We find that for quenches to weak to intermediate coupling the system converges to the equilibrium state defined by the final set of parameters after the quench. We analyze the oscillation frequency and as well as the thermalization rate during this quench. A quench to a strong interaction value results in persistent oscillations and a trapping of the system in a non-thermal state. We speculate that these two regimes of different long-time behavior are separated by a dynamical phase transition.

Title: Peculiar magnetism and magneto-transport properties in a non-centrosymmetric self-intercalated van der Waals ferromagnet Cr5Te8
Authors: BBanik Rai, Sandip Kumar Kuila, Rana Saha, Sankalpa Hazra, Chandan De, Jyotirmoy Sau, Venkatraman Gopalan, Partha Pratim Jana, Stuart S. P. Parkin, Nitesh Kumar
Abstract: Trigonal Cr5Te8, a self-intercalated van der Waals ferromagnet with an out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy, has long been known to crystallize in a centrosymmetric structure. However, optical second harmonic generation experiments, together with comprehensive structural analysis, indicate that this compound rather adopts a non-centrosymmetric structure. Lorentz transmission electron microscopy reveals the presence of Néel-type skyrmions, consistent with its non-centrosymmetric structure. A large anomalous Hall conductivity of 102 ohm^-1cm^-1 at low temperature stems from intrinsic origin, which is larger than any previously reported values in the bulk Cr-Te system. Notably, spontaneous topological Hall resistivity arising from the skyrmionic phase has been observed. Our findings not only elucidate the unique magnetic and magneto-transport properties of non-centrosymmetric trigonal Cr5Te8, but also open new avenues for investigating the effects of broken inversion symmetry on material properties and their potential applications.

Title: Stoner ferromagnetism in low-angle twisted bilayer graphene at three-quarters filling
Authors: Kevin J. U. Vidarte, Felipe Pérez Riffo, Eric Suárez Morell, Caio Lewenkopf
Abstract: We present a theoretical investigation of the magnetic properties exhibited by twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) systems with small twist angles, where the appearance of flat minibands strongly enhances electron-electron interaction effects. We show that, at three-quarters filling of the conduction miniband, the Stoner mechanism induces a ferromagnetic polarization in the AA-stacking regions, which aligns with recent experimental observations. Our approach models the electronic properties by a tight-binding Hamiltonian combined with a Hubbard mean-field interaction term. We employ a real-space recursion technique to self-consistently calculate the system's local density of states and use our method to investigate the magnetic properties of small-angle TBG at three-quarters filling. The recursion method's $O({\cal N})$ efficiency makes it possible to address extremely large superlattices through a full real-space approach. We validate our procedure by comparing it with mean-field momentum-space calculations from the literature, which identify a magnetic phase in charge-neutral TBGs.

Title: Nucleation transitions in polycontextural networks toward consensus
Authors: Johannes Falk, Edwin Eichler, Katja Windt, Marc-Thorsten Hütt
Abstract: Recently, we proposed polycontextural networks as a model of evolving systems of interacting beliefs. Here, we present an analysis of the phase transition as well as the scaling properties. The model contains interacting agents that strive for consensus, each with only subjective perception. Depending on a parameter that governs how responsive the agents are to changing their belief systems the model exhibits a phase transition that mediates between an active phase where the agents constantly change their beliefs and a frozen phase, where almost no changes appear. We observe the build-up of convention-aligned clusters only in the intermediate regime of diverging susceptibility. Here, we analyze in detail the behavior of polycontextural networks close to this transition. We provide an analytical estimate of the critical point and show that the scaling properties and the space-time structure of these clusters show self-similar behavior. Our results not only contribute to a better understanding of the emergence of consensus in systems of distributed beliefs but also show that polycontextural networks are models, motivated by social systems, where susceptibility -- the sensitivity to change own beliefs -- drives the growth of consensus clusters.

Title: Free energy equivalence between mean-field models and nonsparsely diluted mean-field models
Authors: Manaka Okuyama, Masayuki Ohzeki
Abstract: We studied nonsparsely diluted mean-field models that differ from sparsely diluted mean-field models, such as the Viana--Bray model. When the existence probability of each edge follows a Bernoulli distribution, we rigorously prove that the free energy of nonsparsely diluted mean-field models with appropriate parameterization coincides exactly with that of the corresponding mean-field models in ferromagnetic and spin-glass models composed of any discrete spin $S$ in the thermodynamic limit. Our results is a broad generalization of the result of a previous study [Bovier and Gayrard, J. Stat. Phys. 72, 643 (1993)], where the densely diluted mean-field ferromagnetic Ising model (diluted Curie--Weiss model) with appropriate parameterization was analyzed rigorously, and it was proven that its free energy was exactly equivalent to that of the corresponding mean-field model (Curie--Weiss model).

Title: Density matrix renormalization group study of quantum-geometry-facilitated pair density wave order
Authors: Hao-Xin Wang, Wen Huang
Abstract: Understanding the formation of novel pair density waves (PDWs) in strongly correlated electronic systems remains challenging. Recent mean-field studies suggest that PDW phases may arise in strong-coupling multiband superconductors by virtue of the quantum geometric properties of paired electrons. However, scrutiny through sophisticated many-body calculations has been lacking. Employing large-scale density matrix renormalization group calculations, we obtain in the strong-coupling regime the phase diagram as a function of doping concentration and a tuning interaction parameter for a simple two-orbital model that incorporates quantum geometric effects. The phase diagram reveals a robust PDW phase spanning a broad range of parameters, characterized by a Luttinger parameter $K_{sc} \sim 0.3$ and the absence of coexisting competing spin or charge density wave orders. The observed pairing field configuration aligns with the phenomenological understanding that quantum geometry can promote PDW formation. Our study provides the most compelling numerical evidence to date for quantum-geometry-facilitated intrinsic PDW order in strongly correlated systems, paving the way for further exploration of novel PDW orders and quantum geometric effects in such systems.

Title: Exact Fisher zeros and thermofield dynamics across a quantum critical point
Authors: Yang Liu, Songtai Lv, Yuchen Meng, Zefan Tan, Erhai Zhao, Haiyuan Zou
Abstract: By setting the inverse temperature $\beta$ loose to occupy the complex plane, Fisher showed that the zeros of the complex partition function $Z$, if approaching the real $\beta$ axis, reveal a thermodynamic phase transition. More recently, Fisher zeros were used to mark the dynamical phase transition in quench dynamics. It remains unclear, however, how Fisher zeros can be employed to better understand quantum phase transitions or the non-unitary dynamics of open quantum systems. Here we answer this question by a comprehensive analysis of the analytically continued one-dimensional transverse field Ising model. We exhaust all the Fisher zeros to show that in the thermodynamic limit they congregate into a remarkably simple pattern in the form of continuous open or closed lines. These Fisher lines evolve smoothly as the coupling constant is tuned, and a qualitative change identifies the quantum critical point. By exploiting the connection between $Z$ and the thermofield double states, we obtain analytical expressions for the short- and long-time dynamics of the survival amplitude, including its scaling behavior at the quantum critical point. We point out $Z$ can be realized and probed in monitored quantum circuits. The exact analytical results are corroborated by the numerical tensor renormalization group. We further show that similar patterns of Fisher zeros also emerge in other spin models. Therefore, the approach outlined may serve as a powerful tool for interacting quantum systems.

Title: Cryogenic Behavior of High-Permittivity Gate Dielectrics: The Impact of the Atomic Layer Deposition Temperature and the Lithographic Patterning Method
Authors: Alessandro Paghi, Sebastiano Battisti, Simone Tortorella, Giorgio De Simoni, Francesco Giazotto
Abstract: Dielectrics featuring a high relative permittivity, i.e., high-k dielectrics, have become the standard insulators in gate architectures, enhancing the electrical performance of both room temperature and cryogenic electronics. This study delves into the cryogenic (3 K) performance of high-k dielectrics commonly used as gate insulators. We fabricated Al2O3 and HfO2 layers via Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) and we extrapolated relative permittivity (k) and dielectric strength (E_BD) from AC (100 Hz to 100 kHz) and DC measurements on metal-insulator-metal capacitors. Our findings reveal a strong dependence of HfO2 cryogenic performance on the ALD growth temperature, while the latter shows a negligible impact on Al2O3. We estimated a ~9 % and ~14 % reduction of the relative permittivity of HfO2 and Al2O3, respectively, from 300 K to 3 K. Additionally, we designed and fabricated Al2O3/HfO2 bilayers and we checked their properties at cryogenic temperatures. The study also investigates the impact of the patterning method, namely, UV or electron-beam lithography (acceleration voltage of 10, 20, or 30 kV), on the high-k dielectric properties.

Title: Supersolidity in Rydberg tweezer arrays
Authors: Lukas Homeier, Simon Hollerith, Sebastian Geier, Neng-Chun Chiu, Antoine Browaeys, Lode Pollet
Abstract: Rydberg tweezer arrays provide a versatile platform to explore quantum magnets with dipolar XY or van-der-Waals Ising ZZ interactions. Here, we propose a scheme combining dipolar and van-der-Waals interactions between two Rydberg states, where the amplitude of the latter can be greater than that of the former, realizing an extended Hubbard model with long-range tunnelings in optical tweezer arrays. On the triangular lattice with repulsive interactions, we predict the existence of a robust supersolid phase with a critical entropy per particle $S/N \approx 0.19$ accessible in current Rydberg tweezer experiments supported by large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations. We further demonstrate the experimental feasibility by identifying pairs of Rydberg states in ${}^{87}$Rb realizing the required interactions. Such a lattice supersolid is long-lived, found over a wide parameter range in an isotropic and flat two-dimensional geometry, and can be realized for 100s of particles allowing one to directly probe the defect-induced picture of supersolids. Its thermodynamical and dynamical properties can hence be studied at a far larger scale than hitherto possible.

Title: Rotations, Negative Eigenvalues, and Newton Method in Tensor Network Renormalization Group
Authors: Nikolay Ebel, Tom Kennedy, Slava Rychkov
Abstract: In the tensor network approach to statistical physics, properties of the critical point of a 2D lattice model are encoded by a four-legged tensor which is a fixed point of an RG map. The traditional way to find the fixed point tensor consists in iterating the RG map after having tuned the temperature to criticality. Here we develop a different and more direct technique, which solves the fixed point equation via the Newton method. This is challenging due to the existence of marginal deformations -- linear transformations of the coordinate frame, which parametrize a two-dimensional family of fixed points. We address this challenge by including a 90 degree rotation into the RG map. This flips the sign of the problematic marginal eigenvalues, rendering the fixed point isolated and accessible via the Newton method. We demonstrate the power of this technique via explicit computations for the 2D Ising and 3-state Potts models. Using the Gilt-TNR algorithm at bond dimension $\chi=30$, we find the fixed point tensors with $10^{-9}$ accuracy, much higher than what was previously achieved.

Title: Quantum transport under oscillatory drive with disordered amplitude
Authors: Vatsana Tiwari, Sushanta Dattagupta, Devendra Singh Bhakuni, Auditya Sharma
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of non-interacting particles in a one-dimensional tight-binding chain in the presence of an electric field with random amplitude drawn from a Gaussian distribution, and explicitly focus on the nature of quantum transport. We derive an exact expression for the probability propagator and the mean-squared displacement in the clean limit and generalize it for the disordered case using the Liouville operator method. Our analysis reveals that in the presence a random static field, the system follows diffusive transport; however, an increase in the field strength causes a suppression in the transport and thus results in disorder-induced localization. We further extend the analysis for a time-dependent disordered electric field and show that the dynamics of mean-squared-displacement deviates from the parabolic path as the field strength increases, unlike the clean limit where ballistic transport occurs.

Title: Engineering a Josephson junction chain for the simulation of the clock model
Authors: Matteo M. Wauters, Lorenzo Maffi, Michele Burrello
Abstract: The continuous improvement of fabrication techniques and high-quality semiconductor-superconductor interfaces allowed for unprecedented tunability of Josephson junction arrays (JJA), making them a promising candidate for analog quantum simulations of many-body phenomena. While most experimental proposals so far focused on quantum simulations of ensembles of two-level systems, the possibility of tuning the current-phase relation beyond the sinusoidal regime paves the way for studying statistical physics models with larger local Hilbert spaces. Here, we investigate a particular JJA architecture that can be mapped into a $\mathbb{Z}_3$ clock model. Through matrix-product-states simulations and bosonization analysis, we show that few experimentally accessible control parameters allow for the exploration of the rich phase diagrams of the associated low-energy field theories. Our results expand the horizon for analog quantum simulations with JJAs towards models that can not be efficiently captured with qubit architectures.

Title: Altermagnetism Classification
Authors: Sang-Wook Cheong, Fei-Ting Huang
Abstract: Altermagnets are defined as magnetic states with fully compensated spin angular momenta (spins) and broken PT (P: parity, T: time reversal, PT: parity times time reversal) symmetry. We classify three kinds of altermagnets: M-type: broken T symmetry and nonzero net magnetic moments, S-type: broken T symmetry and zero net magnetic moments, and A-type: unbroken T and broken P symmetries. Furthermore, strong altermagnets have spin split bands through exchange coupling in the non-relativistic limit, i.e., for zero spin-orbit coupling (SOC), and weak altermagnets has spin split bands only with non-zero SOC. These strong vs. weak altermagnets can be identified from the total number of symmetric orthogonal spin rotation operations. These classifications of altermagnets will be an essential guidance for the future research on altermagnetism.

Title: Spin Quenching and Transport by Hidden Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya Interactions
Authors: Xiyin Ye, Qirui Cui, Weiwei Lin, Tao Yu
Abstract: Explicit interactions, \textit{e.g.}, dipolar and exchange couplings, usually govern magnetization dynamics. Some interactions may be hidden from the global crystal symmetry. We report that in a large class of \textit{uniaxial} antiferromagnets, a \textit{hidden} Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction with retaining global inversion symmetry quenches the spin of magnon along the Néel vector ${\bf n}$, thus forbidding its angular-momentum flow. Some magnon spins, termed ``nodal" and ``corner" spins, survive when they distribute \textit{singularly} at the hot spots, i.e., high-symmetric degeneracy points in the Brillouin zone, and are protected by crystal symmetries. The biased magnetic field along ${\bf n}$ broadens such distributions, allowing bulk spin transport with unique signatures in the magnetic field and temperature dependencies. This explains recent experiments and highlights the role of hidden interaction.

Title: Resonant inelastic x-ray scattering spectra of spinon, doublon, and quarton excitations of a spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg trimer chain
Authors: Junli Li, Jun-Qing Cheng, Trinanjan Datta, Dao-Xin Yao
Abstract: We investigate the excitation spectra of a spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg trimer spin chain by employing a combination of numerical and theoretical techniques. Utilizing the Krylov-space correction-vector method in density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), we calculate both the direct and indirect resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) spectra for the trimer spin chain. To interpret the observed features in the RIXS spectra, we perform a theoretical perturbative analysis to compute the energy dispersions which are then utilized to determine the density of states (DOS) for both the single-particle and the two-particle excitation spectra. Our results show that the single-particle continua of the direct RIXS spectrum align with the energy levels observed in the DOS spectra of spinon, doublon, and quarton excitations. Furthermore, the two-particle continua are revealed in the indirect RIXS process, where all possible single particle excitations combine to form the various two-particle excitations of the trimer spin chain. Based on our calculations, we propose the RIXS mechanism of generating the fractionalized (spinon) and collective (doublon and quarton) excitations in the trimer spin chain at both the $L$-edge and the $K$-edge, including discussing the interplay of these excitations in the RIXS spectrum for various trimer coupling strength. The computed energy range of the excitations suggest the possibility of experimental detection at both the $L$-edge and the $K$-edge within the current capabilities of RIXS instrumentation resolution.

Title: Fr\"ohlich versus Bose-Einstein Condensation in Pumped Bosonic Systems
Authors: Wenhao Xu, Andrey A. Bagrov, Farhan T. Chowdhury, Luke D. Smith, Daniel R. Kattnig, Hilbert J. Kappen, Mikhail I. Katsnelson
Abstract: Magnon-condensation, which emerges in pumped bosonic systems at room temperature, continues to garner great interest for its long-lived coherence. While traditionally formulated in terms of Bose-Einstein condensation, which typically occurs at ultra-low temperatures, it could potentially also be explained by Fröhlich-condensation, a hypothesis of Bose-Einstein-like condensation in living systems at ambient temperatures. This prompts general questions relating to fundamental differences between coherence phenomena in open and isolated quantum systems. To that end, we introduce a simple model of bosonic condensation in an open quantum system (OQS) formulation, wherein bosons dissipatively interact with an oscillator (phonon) bath. Our derived equations of motion for expected boson occupations turns out to be similar in form to the rate equations governing Fröhlich-condensation. Provided that specific system parameters result in correlations that amplify or diminish the condensation effects, we thereby posit that our treatment offers a better description of high-temperature condensation compared to traditional formulations obtained using equilibrium thermodynamics. By comparing our OQS derivation with the original uncorrelated and previous semi-classical rate equations, we furthermore highlight how both classical anti-correlations and quantum correlations alter the bosonic occupation distribution.

Title: Broken Lorentz symmetry and violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law in topological insulators
Authors: Feng Liu, A. Daria Dumitriu-I., Alessandro Principi
Abstract: We study a two-dimensional topological insulator in the presence of a static non-uniform gravitational field, which mimics the variations in the temperature distribution. We derive an effective boundary free energy functional for the gravitational field and show that, in contrast to the case of massive Dirac fermions, the addition of a Newtonian mass term significantly modifies the quantum anomalous behavior of the system. A non-zero bulk thermal current appears, which violates the Wiedemann-Franz law. The systematic approach we develop to calculate the contribution of edge states to thermal Hall conductivity and energy magnetization can easily be extended to other models.

Title: Markov-type state models to describe non-Markovian dynamics
Authors: Sofia Sartore, Franziska Teichmann, Gerhard Stock
Abstract: When clustering molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories into a few metastable conformational states, the Markov state models (MSMs) assumption of timescale separation between fast intrastate fluctuations and rarely occurring interstate transitions is often not valid. Hence, the naive estimation of the macrostate transition matrix via simply counting transitions between the states leads to significantly too short implied timescales and thus to too fast population decays. In this work, we discuss advanced approaches to estimate the transition matrix. Assuming that Markovianity is at least given at the microstate level, we consider the Laplace-transform based method by Hummer and Szabo, as well as a direct microstate-to-macrostate projection, which by design yields correct macrostate population dynamics. Alternatively, we study the recently proposed quasi-MSM ansatz of Huang and coworkers to solve a generalized master equations, as well as a hybrid method that employs MD at short times and MSM at long times. Adopting a one-dimensional toy model and an all-atom folding trajectory of HP35, we discuss the virtues and shortcomings of the various approaches.

Title: The impact of strain on the GeV-color center in diamond
Authors: Thijs G.I. van Wijk, E. Aylin Melan, Rani Mary Joy, Emerick Y. Guillaume, Paulius Pobedinskas, Ken Haenen, Danny E. P. Vanpoucke
Abstract: Color centers in diamond, such as the GeV center, are promising candidates for quantum-based applications. Here, we investigate the impact of strain on the zero-phonon line (ZPL) position of GeV$^0$. Both hydrostatic and linear strain are modeled using density functional theory for GeV$^0$ concentrations of $1.61$ \% down to $0.10$ \%. We present qualitative and quantitative differences between the two strain types: for hydrostatic tensile and compressive strain, red-and blue-shifted ZPL positions are expected, respectively, with a linear relation between the ZPL shift and the experienced stress. By calculating the ZPL shift for varying GeV$^0$ concentrations, a shift of $0.15$ nm/GPa ($0.38$ meV/GPa) is obtained at experimentally relevant concentrations using a hybrid functional. In contrast, only red-shifted ZPL are found for tensile and compressive linear strain along the $\langle100\rangle$ direction. The calculated ZPL shift exceeds that of hydrostatic strain by at least one order of magnitude, with a significant difference between tensile and compressive strains: $3.2$ and $4.8$ nm/GPa ($8.1$ and $11.7$ meV/GPa), respectively. In addition, a peak broadening is expected due to the lifted degeneracy of the GeV$^0$ $e_g$ state, calculated to be about $6$ meV/GPa. These calculated results are placed in perspective with experimental observations, showing values of ZPL shifts and splittings of comparable magnitude.

Title: Mathematical analysis of a flux-jump model in superconductivity
Authors: Jean-Guy Caputo, Nathan Rouxelin
Abstract: We analyzed mathematically a model describing flux jumps in superconductivity in a 1D configuration. Three effects occur from fastest to slowest: Joule heating, magnetic relaxation and temperature diffusion. Adimensionalising the equations showed that magnetic field fronts penetrate the material as inhomogeneous Burgers fronts. An additional nonlinear term affects the magnetic field and is responsible for flux jumps. We considered a medium temperature for which the heat capacity of a sample can be assumed constant and a low temperature where heat capacity depends on temperature causing a nonlinear temperature evolution. We found that flux jumps occur for pulses of duration close to the magnetic relaxation time and mostly at low temperature. Flux trapping is maximal for medium amplitude long duration pulses and low to medium temperatures.

Title: Multiplicative Chern insulator
Authors: Archi Banerjee, Ashley M. Cook
Abstract: We study multiplicative Chern insulators (MCIs) as canonical examples of multiplicative topological phases of matter. Constructing the MCI Bloch Hamiltonian as a symmetry-protected tensor product of two topologically non-trivial parent Chern insulators (CIs), we study two-dimensional (2D) MCIs and introduce 3D mixed MCIs, constructed by requiring the two 2D parent Hamiltonians share only one momentum component. We study the 2D MCI response to time reversal symmetric flux insertion, observing a $4\pi$ Aharonov-Bohm effect, relating these topological states to fractional quantum Hall states via the effective field theory of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect. As part of this response, we observe evidence of quantisation of a proposed topological invariant for compactified many-body states, to a rational number, suggesting higher-dimensional topology may also be relevant. Finally, we study effects of bulk perturbations breaking the symmetry-protected tensor product structure of the child Hamiltonian, finding the MCI evolves adiabatically into a topological skyrmion phase.

Title: Robustness of quantum many-body scars in the presence of Markovian bath
Authors: Xiang-Ping Jiang, Mingdi Xu, Xuanpu Yang, Hongsheng Hou, Yucheng Wang, Lei Pan
Abstract: A generic closed quantum many-body system will inevitably tend to thermalization, whose local information encoded in the initial state eventually scrambles into the full space, known as quantum ergodicity. A paradigmatic exception in closed quantum systems for strong ergodicity breaking is known as many-body localization, where strong disorder-induced localization prevents the occurrence of thermalization. It is generally recognized that a localized quantum system would be delocalized under dissipation induced by the environment. However, this consequence recently has received challenges where an exotic dissipation-induced localization mechanism is proposed, and transitions between localized and extended phases are found. In this Letter, we promote this mechanism to systems for weak ergodicity breaking hosting quantum many-body scars (QMBS). We find that the system relaxes to a steady state dominated by QMBS, and the dissipative dynamics exhibit dynamic revivals by suitably preparing an initial state. We point out an experimental realization of the controlled dissipation with a cold atomic setup. This makes the signature of ergodicity breaking visible over dissipative dynamics and offers potential possibilities for experimentally preparing stable QMBS with associated coherent dynamics.

Title: How quantum selection rules influence the magneto-optical effects of driven, ultrafast magnetization dynamics
Authors: Mohamed F. Elhanoty, Olle Eriksson, Chin Shen Ong, Oscar Grånäs
Abstract: Ultrafast magnetization dynamics driven by ultrashort pump lasers is typically explained by changes in electronic populations and scattering pathways of excited conduction electrons. This conventional approach overlooks the fundamental role of quantum mechanical selection rules, governing transitions from core states to the conduction band, that forms the key method of the probing step in these experiments. By employing fully ab initio time-dependent density functional theory, we reveal that these selection rules profoundly influence the interpretation of ultrafast spin dynamics at specific probe energies. Our analysis for hcp Co and fcc Ni at the M edge demonstrates that the transient dynamics, as revealed in pump-probe experiments, arise from a complex interplay of optical excitations of the M shell. Taking into account the selection rules and conduction electron spin flips, this leads to highly energy-dependent dynamics. These findings address longstanding discrepancies in experimental TMOKE measurements and show that only through meticulous consideration of matrix elements at the probe stage, can one ensure that magnetization dynamics is revealed in its true nature, instead of being muddled by artifacts arising from the choice of probe energy.

Title: Observation of Jones-Roberts solitons in a paraxial quantum fluid of light
Authors: Myrann Baker-Rasooli, Tangui Aladjidi, Nils A.Krause, Ashton S. Bradley, Quentin Glorieux
Abstract: We investigate the formation and dynamics of Jones-Roberts solitons in a smoothly inhomogeneous quantum fluid. To do so, we create a superfluid of light using paraxial, near-resonant laser beam propagating through a hot rubidium vapor. We excite a bounded vortex-antivortex dipole in the superfluid and observe its transition to a rarefaction pulse and back, in agreement with the seminal predictions of Jones and Roberts. Employing an analogy with ray optics, we calculate the trajectory of the interacting vortices, deriving an effective refractive index from the inhomogeneous fluid density. Finally, we examine analytically and experimentally the superfluid velocity correlations, observing a transfer of coherence from incompressible to compressible velocity of the quantum fluid, a direct signature of the dynamical conversion between vortices and rarefaction pulse.

Title: Ion correlations explain kinetic selectivity in diffusion-limited solid state synthesis reactions
Authors: Vir Karan, Max C. Gallant, Yuxing Fei, Gerbrand Ceder, Kristin A. Persson
Abstract: Establishing viable solid-state synthesis pathways for novel inorganic materials remains a major challenge in materials science. Previous pathway design methods using pair-wise reaction approaches have navigated the thermodynamic landscape with first-principles data but lack kinetic information, limiting their effectiveness. This gap leads to suboptimal precursor selection and predictions, especially for reactions forming competing phases with similar formation energies, where ion diffusion is a critical influence. Here, we demonstrate an inorganic synthesis framework by incorporating machine learning-derived transport properties through "liquid-like" product layers into a thermodynamic cellular reaction model. In the Ba-Ti-O system, known for its competitive polymorphism, we obtain accurate predictions of phase formation with varying BaO:TiO2 ratios as a function of time and temperature. We find that diffusion-thermodynamic interplay governs phase compositions, with cross-ion transport coefficients critical for predicting diffusion-limited selectivity. This work bridges length and time scales by integrating solid-state reaction kinetics with first-principles thermodynamics and spatial reactivity.

Abstract: We theoretically study the intrinsic spin Hall effect in PT symmetric, spin-orbit coupled quantum gases confined in an optical lattice. The interplay of the PT symmetry and the spin-orbit coupling leads to a doubly degenerate non-interacting band structure in which the spin polarization and the Berry curvature of any Bloch state are opposite to those of its degenerate partner. Using experimentally available systems as examples, we show that such a system with a two-component Fermi gas exhibits an intrinsic spin Hall effect akin to that found in the context of electronic materials. For a two-component Bose gas, however, an unconventional spin Hall effect emerges in which the spin polarization and the currents are coplanar and the spin Hall conductivity displays a characteristic anisotropy. We propose to detect such an unconventional spin Hall effect in harmonically trapped systems using dipole oscillations and perform extensive numerical simulations to validate the proposal. Our work paves the way for quantum simulation of the solid-state intrinsic spin Hall effect and experimental explorations of unconventional spin Hall effects in quantum gases.

Title: Identification of mechanisms of magnetic transitions using an efficient method for converging on first order saddle points
Authors: Hendrik Schrautzer, Moritz Sallermann, Pavel F. Bessarab, Hannes Jónsson
Abstract: A method for locating first order saddle points on the energy surface of a magnetic system is described and several applications presented where the mechanism of various magnetic transitions is identified. The starting point for the iterative search algorithm can be anywhere, even close to a local energy minimum representing an initial state of the system, and the final state need not be specified. Convergence on a saddle point is obtained by inverting the component of the gradient along the minimum mode, thereby effectively transforming the neighbourhood of the saddle point to that of a local minimum. The method requires only the lowest two eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors of the Hessian of the system's energy and they are found using a quasi-Newton limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno solver for the minimization of the Rayleigh quotient without explicit evaluation of the Hessian. The method is applicable to large systems as the computational effort scales linearly with system size. Applications are presented to transitions in systems that reveal significant complexity of co-existing magnetic states, such as skyrmions, skyrmion bags, skyrmion tubes, chiral bobbers, and globules. When combined with rate theory within the harmonic approximation, the method can be used for simulations of the long timescale dynamics of complex magnetic systems characterized by multiple metastable states.

Title: Energy-filtered quantum states and the emergence of non-local correlations
Authors: Gianluca Morettini, Luca Capizzi, Maurizio Fagotti, Leonardo Mazza
Abstract: Energy-filtered quantum states are promising candidates for efficiently simulating thermal states. We explore a protocol designed to transition a product state into an eigenstate located in the middle of the spectrum; this is achieved by gradually reducing its energy variance, which allows us to comprehensively understand the crossover phenomenon and the subsequent convergence towards thermal behavior. We introduce and discuss three energy-filtering regimes (short, medium and long), and we interpret them as stages of thermalization. We show that the properties of the filtered states are locally indistinguishable from those of time-averaged density matrices, routinely employed in the theory of thermalization. On the other hand, unexpected non-local quantum correlations are generated in the medium regimes and are witnessed by the Rényi entanglement entropies of subsystems, which we compute via replica methods. Specifically, two-point correlation functions break cluster decomposition and the entanglement entropy of large regions scales as the logarithm of the volume during the medium filter time.

Title: Dataset-Free Weight-Initialization on Restricted Boltzmann Machine
Authors: Muneki Yasuda, Ryosuke Maeno, Chako Takahashi
Abstract: In feed-forward neural networks, dataset-free weight-initialization methods such as LeCun, Xavier (or Glorot), and He initializations have been developed. These methods randomly determine the initial values of weight parameters based on specific distributions (e.g., Gaussian or uniform distributions) without using training datasets. To the best of the authors' knowledge, such a dataset-free weight-initialization method is yet to be developed for restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs), which are probabilistic neural networks consisting of two layers. In this study, we derive a dataset-free weight-initialization method for Bernoulli--Bernoulli RBMs based on statistical mechanical analysis. In the proposed weight-initialization method, the weight parameters are drawn from a Gaussian distribution with zero mean. The standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution is optimized based on our hypothesis that a standard deviation providing a larger layer correlation (LC) between the two layers improves the learning efficiency. The expression of the LC is derived based on a statistical mechanical analysis. The optimal value of the standard deviation corresponds to the maximum point of the LC. The proposed weight-initialization method is identical to Xavier initialization in a specific case (i.e., when the sizes of the two layers are the same, the random variables of the layers are $\{-1,1\}$-binary, and all bias parameters are zero). The validity of the proposed weight-initialization method is demonstrated in numerical experiments using a toy and real-world datasets.

Title: Emergence of capillary waves in miscible co-flowing fluids
Authors: Alessandro Carbonaro, Giovanni Savorana, Luca Cipelletti, Rama Govindarajan, Domenico Truzzolillo
Abstract: We show that capillary waves can exist at the the boundary between miscible co-flowing fluids. We unveil that the interplay between transient interfacial stresses and confinement drives the progressive transition from the well-known inertial regime, characterized by a frequency independent wavenumber, $k\sim\omega^{0}$, to a capillary wave scaling, $k\sim\omega^{2/3}$, unexpected for miscible fluids. This allows us to measure the effective interfacial tension between miscible fluids and its rapid decay on time scales never probed so far, which we rationalize with a model going beyond square-gradient theories. Our work potentially opens a new avenue to measure transient interfacial tensions at the millisecond scale in a controlled manner.

Title: Thermal Bootstrap of Matrix Quantum Mechanics
Authors: Minjae Cho, Barak Gabai, Joshua Sandor, Xi Yin
Abstract: We implement a bootstrap method that combines Schwinger-Dyson equations, thermal inequalities, and semidefinite relaxations of matrix logarithm in the ungauged one-matrix quantum mechanics, at finite rank N as well as in the large N limit, and determine finite temperature observables that interpolate between available analytic results in the low and high temperature limits respectively. We also obtain bootstrap bounds on thermal phase transition as well as preliminary results in the ungauged two-matrix quantum mechanics.

Title: High-Q cavity coupled to a high permittivity dielectric resonator for sensing applications
Authors: Shahnam Gorgi Zadeh, Alberto Ghirri, Sergio Pagano, Simone Tocci, Claudio Gatti, Antonio Cassinese
Abstract: The use of high quality factor resonators is of undoubted interest for high precision measurements and for applications in quantum technologies. Novel types of microwave sensors can be realized by coupling a first resonator acting as a stable frequency reference with a second resonator that is sensitive to a particular physical quantity. Here we report on a coupled cavity configuration in which a high $Q$-factor elliptical TESLA-shaped superconducting cavity is coupled with a high permittivity ($\varepsilon_\mathrm{r}$) SrTiO$_3$ puck, whose resonant frequency varies as a function of temperature due to the temperature dependence of the permittivity that reaches values higher than 30000 below 1 K. Extensive electromagnetic simulations are used to test different coupling configurations, showing great versatility to tune the coupling in the weak or strong regime, depending on the puck's position within the cavity. Moreover, for the coupled system, they allow one to investigate the dependence of the zero transmission frequency value on changes of the permittivity $\varepsilon_\mathrm{r}$, obtaining a maximum value of 2.8 MHz per unit change of $\varepsilon_\mathrm{r}$, for $\varepsilon_\mathrm{r} \approx 230$. Finally, we discuss a specific application of the coupled system as a bolometer in different temperature ranges.

Title: Geometric Floquet theory
Authors: Paul M. Schindler, Marin Bukov
Abstract: We derive Floquet theory from quantum geometry. We identify quasienergy folding as a consequence of a broken gauge group of the adiabatic gauge potential $U(1){\mapsto}\mathbb{Z}$. Fixing instead the gauge freedom using the parallel-transport gauge uniquely decomposes Floquet dynamics into a purely geometric and a purely dynamical evolution. The dynamical average-energy operator provides an unambiguous sorting of the quasienergy spectrum, identifying a unique Floquet ground state and suggesting a way to define the filling of Floquet-Bloch bands. We exemplify the features of geometric Floquet theory using an exactly solvable XY model and a non-integrable kicked Ising chain. We elucidate the geometric origin of inherently nonequilibrium effects, like the $\pi$-quasienergy gap in discrete time crystals or $\pi$-edge modes in anomalous Floquet topological insulators. The spectrum of the average-energy operator is a susceptible indicator for both heating and spatiotemporal symmetry-breaking transitions. Last, we demonstrate that the periodic lab frame Hamiltonian generates transitionless counterdiabatic driving for Floquet eigenstates. This work directly bridges seemingly unrelated areas of nonequilibrium physics.

Title: Threetangle in the XY-model class with a non-integrable field background
Authors: Jörg Neveling, Andreas Osterloh
Abstract: The square root of the threetangle is calculated for the transverse XY-model with an integrability-breaking in-plane field component. To be in a regime of quasi-solvability of the convex roof, here we concentrate here on a 4-site model Hamiltonian. In general, the field and hence a mixing of the odd/even sectors, has a detrimental effect on the threetangle, as expected. Only in a particular spot of models with no or weak inhomogeneity $\gamma$ does a finite value of the tangle prevail in a broad maximum region of the field strength $h\approx 0.3\pm 0.1$. There, the threetangle is basically independent of the non-zero angle $\alpha$. This system could be experimentally used as a quasi-pure source of threetangled states or as an entanglement triggered switch depending on the experimental error in the field orientation.

Title: Effective field theory of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect
Authors: Vinay Patil, Rafael Flores-Calderón, Ashley M. Cook
Abstract: Motivated by phenomenology of myriad recently-identified topologically non-trivial phases of matter, we introduce effective field theories (EFTs) for the quantum skyrmion Hall effect (QSkHE). We employ a single, unifying generalisation for this purpose: in essence, a lowest Landau level projection defining a non-commutative, fuzzy sphere with position coordinates proportional to SU(2) generators of matrix representation size $N\times N$, may host an intrinsically 2+1 dimensional, topologically non-trivial many-body state for small $N$ as well as large $N$. That is, isospin degrees of freedom associated with a matrix Lie algebra with $N \times N$ generators potentially encode some finite number of spatial dimensions for $N\ge 2$, a regime in which isospin has previously been treated as a label. This statement extends to more general $p$-branes subjected to severe fuzzification as well as membranes. As a consequence of this generalisation, systems with $d$ Cartesian spatial coordinates and isospin degrees of freedom encoding an additional $\delta$ fuzzy coset space coordinates can realise topologically non-trivial states of intrinsic dimensionality up to $d$+$\delta$+1. We therefore identify gauge theories with extra fuzzy dimensions generalised to retain dependence upon gauge fields over fuzzy coset spaces even for severe fuzzification (small $N$), as EFTs for the QSkHE. We furthermore generalise these EFTs to space manifolds with local product structure exploiting the dimensional hierarchy of (fuzzy) spheres. For this purpose, we introduce methods of anisotropic fuzzification and propose formulating topological invariants on fuzzy coset spaces as artifacts of projecting matrix Lie algebras to occupied subspaces. Importantly, we focus on phenomenology indicating the 2+1 D SU(2) gauge theory should be generalised using this machinery, and serves as a minimal EFT of the QSkHE.

Title: Asymptotics of the Humbert functions $\Psi_1$ and $\Psi_2$
Authors: Peng-Cheng Hang, Malte Henkel, Min-Jie Luo
Abstract: A compilation of new results on the asymptotic behaviour of the Humbert functions $\Psi_1$ and $\Psi_2$, and also on the Appell function $F_2$, is presented. As a by-product, we confirm a conjectured limit which appeared recently in the study of the $1D$ Glauber-Ising model. We also propose two elementary asymptotic methods and confirm through some illustrative examples that both methods have great potential and can be applied to a large class of problems of asymptotic analysis. Finally, some directions of future research are pointed out in order to suggest ideas for further study.
