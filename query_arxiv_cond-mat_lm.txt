Title: Scaling Properties of Avalanche Activity in the Two-Dimensional Abelian Sandpile Model
Authors: Anubhav Ganguly
Abstract: We study the scaling properties of avalanche activity in the two-dimensional Abelian sandpile model. Instead of the conventional avalanche size distribution, we analyze the site activity distribution, which measures how often a site participates in avalanches when grains are added across the lattice. Using numerical simulations for system sizes up to \(L = 160\), averaged over \(10^4\) configurations, we determine the probability distribution \(P(A, L)\) of site activities. The results show that \(P(A, L)\) follows a finite-size scaling form \[ P(A, L) \sim L^{-2} F\Big(\frac{A}{L^2}\Big). \] For small values \(A \ll L^2\) the scaling function behaves as \[ F(u) \sim u^{-1/2}, \quad \text{corresponding to} \quad P(A) \sim \frac{1}{L}, \] while for large activities \(A \sim O(L^2)\) the distribution decays as \[ F(u) \sim \exp\big(-c_3 u - c_4 u^2\big). \] The crossover between these two regimes occurs at \[ A^* \sim 0.1 \, L^2, \] marking the threshold between typical and highly excitable sites. This characterization of local avalanche activity provides complementary information to the usual avalanche size statistics, highlighting how local regions serve as frequent conduits for critical dynamics. These results may help connect sandpile models to real-world self-organized critical systems where only partial local activity can be observed.

Title: Ensemble-Based Data Assimilation for Material Model Characterization in High-Velocity Impact
Authors: Rong Jin, Guangyao Wang, Xingsheng Sun
Abstract: High-fidelity simulations are essential for understanding and predicting the behavior of materials under high-velocity impact (HVI) in both fundamental research and practical applications. However, their accuracy relies on material models and parameters that are traditionally obtained through manual fitting to multiple time- and labor-intensive experiments. This study presents an ensemble-based data assimilation (DA) framework to automatically and simultaneously calibrate plasticity, fracture, and equation of state (EOS) parameters from a single HVI test. The framework integrates Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics for HVI simulations, the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) for parameter refinement, and adaptive covariance inflation to mitigate uncertainty underestimation. The approach is demonstrated using synthetic back-face deflection data from an AZ31B magnesium plate to identify Johnson-Cook plasticity/fracture and Mie-Gruneisen EOS parameters. Test cases with biased initial guesses and limited data show the EnKF-based framework accurately recovers sensitive parameters in few iterations, indicated by a convergent ensemble standard deviation. Conversely, insensitive parameters converge to incorrect values with persistently large standard deviations. Limited observational data can still achieve convergence but requires more iterations. Under extreme prior bias, sensitive parameters may exhibit a drift-then-stall behavior with small residual biases. In practice, the ensemble standard deviation thus provides a diagnostic tool to assess parameter sensitivity and calibration accuracy. This study demonstrates the proposed DA framework is a robust and efficient tool for HVI material model characterization.

Title: Conformal Data for the O(3) Wilson-Fisher CFT from Fuzzy Sphere Realization of Quantum Rotor Model
Authors: Arjun Dey, Loic Herviou, Christopher Mudry, Andreas Martin Läuchli
Abstract: We present a model for strongly interacting fermions with internal O(3) symmetry on the fuzzy-sphere that (i) preserves the rotational symmetry of the fuzzy sphere and (ii) undergoes a quantum phase transition in the (2+1)-dimensional O(3) Wilson-Fisher universality class. Using exact diagonalization (ED) and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), we locate the quantum critical point via conformal perturbation theory and obtain scaling dimensions from finite-size spectra. We identify 24 primary operators and determine some of their operator product expansion coefficients through first-order conformal perturbation theory. The results are benchmarked against conformal bootstrap and large quantum-number expansions and reveal a weakly irrelevant operator that plays a role in dimerized antiferromagnets. Our work establishes the fuzzy sphere as a general framework for quantitatively accessing conformal data in non-Abelian conformal field theories (CFTs).

Title: Emergent Network of Josephson Junctions in a Kagome Superconductor
Authors: Tycho J. Blom, Matthijs Rog, Marieke Altena, Andrea Capa Salinas, Stephen D. Wilson, Chuan Li, Kaveh Lahabi
Abstract: Materials with a Kagome lattice are intensely studied because they host novel, exotic states that combine strong correlations and electronic topology. The AV3Sb5 (A = K, Rb, Cs) group, in particular, is of major interest due to its combination of charge density waves, unconventional superconductivity, and indications of time-reversal symmetry breaking and electronic nematicity. Recently, critical current oscillations in an external magnetic field were observed in an unstructured flake of CsV3Sb5 at low current densities. In this work, we unequivocally show that the origin of these oscillations is a network of Josephson junctions intrinsic to the flake that emerges below its critical temperature. Under radio-frequency radiation, we observe perfectly quantized, integer Shapiro steps. The sensitivity of the step height to the contact placement indicates a rich and complex network of junctions. By performing interference studies along multiple field directions, we demonstrate that the observed interference effects are a result of geometrically small junctions and filamentary supercurrent flow. Upon microstructuring the flake, prominent features of the interference pattern are fully preserved, illustrating the localized nature of these flakes and their stability to thermal cycles. These results pave the way for determining the exact nature of superconductivity in the AV3Sb5 family.

The effect of the quantizing magnetic field orientation on electron-electron scattering processes is ectablished.

Title: Dipole Alignment and Layered Flow Structure in Pressure-Driven Water Transport through MoS$_{2}$ Membranes
Authors: João Victor Lemos Vale, Lucas Cesena, Bruno H. S. Mendonça, Elizane E. de Moraes
Abstract: Efficient water transport through nanostructure membranes is essential for advancing filtration and desalination technologies. In this study, we investigate the flow of water through molybdenum disulfide (MoS$_{2}$) nanopores of varying diameters using molecular dynamics simulations. The results demonstrate that both pore size and atomic edge composition play crucial roles in regulating water flux, molecular organization, and dipole orientation. Larger pores facilitate the formation of layered water structures and promote edge-accelerated flow, driven by strong electrostatic interactions between water molecules and exposed molybdenum atoms. In narrower pores, confinement and asymmetric edge chemistry induce the ordered alignment of dipoles, thereby enhancing directional transport. Velocity and density maps reveal that pore edges act as active zones, concentrating flow and reducing resistance. These findings highlight the significance of pore geometry, surface chemistry, and molecular dynamics in influencing water behavior within MoS$_{2}$ membranes, providing valuable insights for the design of advanced nanofluidic and water purification systems.

Title: Thermoelectric effect at the quantum Hall-superconductor interface
Authors: Jordan T. McCourt, John Chiles, Chun-Chia Chen, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Tanaguchi, Francois Amet, Gleb Finkelstein
Abstract: The interfaces of quantum Hall insulators with superconductors have emerged as a promising platform to realise interesting physics that may be relevant for topologically protected quantum computing. However, these interfaces can host other effects which obscure the detection of the desired excitations. Here we present measurements of the thermoelectric effect at the quantum Hall-superconductor interface. We explain the heat transport by considering the formation of a hotspot at the interface, which results in a non-equilibrium distribution of electrons that can propagate across the superconductor through vortex cores. The observed thermoelectric effect results in a voltage which changes sign on quantum Hall plateaus and responds to the rearrangement of vortices in the wire. These observations highlight the complex interplay of thermal and charge phenomena at the quantum Hall -- superconductor interfaces and should be considered when interpreting transport measurements in similar systems.

Title: Rotation of crystal seed during early stages of growth reveals the anisotropy of glass matrix
Authors: R. Thapa, E. Mustermann, H. Jain, V. Dierolf, M. E. McKenzie
Abstract: Rotation of crystal seed during the early stages of growth in a glass matrix has been observed due to some torque, contradicting the expectations from the isotropic, uniform structure of the surrounding amorphous matrix. We establish an atomistic origin of this new phenomenon from molecular dynamics simulations using LiNbO3 and LiNbO3-SiO2 glasses as model systems. Effectively, it arises due to non-uniform forces on the seed from the surrounding glass, which appears inhomogeneous and anisotropic on the scale of glass-crystal interface. The seeded crystal growth (SCG) at higher temperatures amplifies this effect due to enhanced atomic dynamics. Silica, when added to LiNbO3 glass, reduces the crystal growth rate due to increased viscosity and restricted atomic mobility across the growth interface, but has minimal effect on the crystal rotation. These findings challenge a general assumption that glass is an isotropic material, especially during the early stage of its crystallization, and provide insights for tailoring the microstructure of widely used glass-ceramics.

Title: Stable High-Order Vortices in Spin-Orbit-Coupled Spin-1 Bose-Einstein Condensates
Authors: Xin-Feng Zhang, Huan-Bo Luo, Josep Batle, Bin Liu, Yongyao Li
Abstract: The present contribution explores phase transitions that occur in the ground state (GS) of spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) with spin-orbit coupling (SOC) under the action of gradient magnetic fields. By solving the corresponding linearized system in an exact fashion, we identify the conditions under which the GS phase transitions occur, thus transforming excited states into GS. The study of the full nonlinear system, including both density-density and spin-spin interactions, is numerically analyzed. For the case of repulsive spin-spin interactions, the results resemble the linear case, while attractive spin-spin interactions lead to the formation of mixed-states near the GS phase-transition points. Additionally, higher-order vortex solitons are found to be stable even in the nonlinear regime. These findings demonstrate that arbitrary winding numbers can be achieved as corresponding to stable GS and thus contributing to the understanding of topological properties in SOC BECs.

Title: Spin Hall effect in the high-resistivity high-entropy alloy AlCrMoW
Authors: Jyoti Yadav, Felix Janus, Tiago de Oliveira Schneider, Shalini Sharma, Daniel Schröter, Markus Meinert
Abstract: We study thin films of the high-entropy alloy system Al$_{x}$(CrMoW)$_{1-x}$, grown on Ta seed layers by magnetron co-sputtering. Between $x=0.2$ and $x=0.6$, a resistivity larger than 100$\mu\Omega$cm is achieved, with a peak of 180$\mu\Omega$cm at $x=0.5$. Around the stoichiometric composition AlCrMoW, the alloy forms a bcc solid solution. The harmonic Hall method was used to characterize the spin Hall angle of the alloy series, where a maximum spin Hall angle of $\theta = -0.12 \pm 0.01$ is observed for $x=0.25$. The implied spin Hall conductivity is $\sigma_\mathrm{SH} \approx -72\,000 \, \hbar/(2e)$\,S/m. The experimental results show excellent agreement with density functional theory calculations, which show similar trends and values. The results demonstrate that high-entropy alloys with a main-group element component can form a simple crystal structure and show high resistivity. This suggests that a whole new class of materials for spin Hall device engineering is available with simple methods.

Title: Raman Digital Twin of Monolayer Janus Transition Metal Dichalcogenides
Authors: Johnathan Kowalski, Liangbo Liang
Abstract: Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are a key class of two-dimensional (2D) materials with broad technological potential. Their Janus counterparts exhibit unique properties due to broken out-of-plane symmetry and further enrich the functionalities of TMDs. However, experimental synthesis and identification of Janus TMDs remain challenging. It is thus highly desirable to have a rapid, simple, and in situ characterization technique to monitor, in real time, the conversion process from the parent to Janus structure. Raman spectroscopy stands out for such a task as it is a powerful, non-destructive, and very commonly used tool to characterize 2D materials both in situ and ex situ. To realize the full potential of Raman spectroscopy on rapid characterization of Janus TMDs, we present a computational "Raman digital twin" library for various monolayer Janus TMDs in both 2H and Td phases. We focus on group-6 TMDs: MoS$_2$, WS$_2$, MoSe$_2$, WSe$_2$, MoTe$_2$, WTe$_2$ and their Janus variants: MoSSe, MoSTe, MoSeTe, WSSe, WSTe, and WSeTe. Using first-principles density functional theory (DFT), we calculate their vibrational properties and predict distinct Raman fingerprints. These phonon and Raman signatures reflect each material's structural symmetry and atomic composition, enabling clear identification via Raman spectroscopy. Our theoretical work supports experimental efforts by providing benchmarks for material identification, structural analysis, and quality control. The computational library expedites the discovery and development of Janus 2D materials, facilitating tighter integration between theoretical predictions and experimental validation.

Title: Predicting Crystal Structures and Ionic Conductivity in Li$_{3}$YCl$_{6-x}$Br$_{x}$ Halide Solid Electrolytes Using a Fine-Tuned Machine Learning Interatomic Potential
Authors: Jonas Böhm, Aurélie Champagne
Abstract: This work demonstrates the effectiveness of fine-tuning the CHGNet universal machine learning interatomic potential (uMLIP) to investigate ionic transport mechanisms in ternary halide solid electrolytes of the Li$_{3}$YCl$_{6-x}$Br$_{x}$ family (x = 0 to 6), which are promising candidates for solid-state battery applications. We present a strategy for generating ordered structural models from experimentally derived disordered Li$_{3}$YCl$_{6}$ (LYC) and Li$_{3}$YBr$_{6}$ (LYB) structures. These serve as initial configurations for an iterative fine-tuning workflow that couples molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with static density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The fine-tuning process and the resulting improvements in predictive accuracy are benchmarked across energy predictions, structure optimizations, and diffusion coefficient calculations. Finally, we analyze the influence of composition (varied x) on the predicted ionic conductivity in Li$_{3}$YCl$_{6-x}$Br$_{x}$, demonstrating the robustness of our approach for modeling transport properties in complex solid electrolytes.

Title: Polymer Topology and the Depletion Interaction
Authors: Mauro L. Mugnai
Abstract: Using a theoretical model we show that ideal ring polymers are stronger depletants than ideal linear polymers of equal radii of gyration, but not of equal hydrodynamic radii. The difference in the depletion-induced force profile is largely controlled by the thickness of the depletion layer. Theory suggests that this thickness is equal to the average extent of a polymer along the direction perpendicular to the surfaces of the colloids. Within the limits of finite-size effects, Molecular Dynamics simulations support this conclusion.

Title: Hydration Free Energies of Linear Alkanes: Evaluating and Correcting Classical Force Field Predictions with Different Water Models
Authors: Yalda Ramezani, Sumit Sharma
Abstract: Common force fields tend to overestimate the hydration free energies of hydrophobic solutes, leading to an exaggerated hydrophobic effect. We compute the hydration free energies of linear alkanes from methane to eicosane (C$_{20}$H$_{42}$) using free energy perturbation with various three-site (SPC/E, OPC3) and four-site (TIP4P/2005, OPC) water models and the TraPPE-UA force field for alkanes. All water models overestimate the hydration free energies, though the four-site models perform better than the three-site ones. By utilizing cavity free energies, we reparameterize the alkane--water well depth to bring simulation results in agreement with experimental and group-contribution estimates. We find that the General Amber Force Field (GAFF) combined with TIP4P/2005 water provides closer estimates of the hydration free energy. The HH alkane model (a reparameterized TraPPE-UA force field) with TIP4P/2005 reproduces experimental hydration free energies. We also show that applying a shifted Lennard--Jones potential leads to systematic deviations in the hydration free energy estimates.

Title: Two-dimensional superconducting diode effect in topological insulator/superconductor heterostructure
Authors: Soma Nagahama, Yuki Sato, Minoru Kawamura, Ilya Belopolski, Ryutaro Yoshimi, Atsushi Tsukazaki, Naoya Kanazawa, Kei S Takahashi, Masashi Kawasaki, Yoshinori Tokura
Abstract: The superconducting diode effect (SDE) is characterized by the nonreciprocity of Cooper-pair motion with respect to current direction. In three-dimensional (3D) materials, SDE results in a critical current that varies with direction, making the effect distinctly observable: the material exhibits superconductivity in one direction while behaving as a resistive metal in the opposite direction. However, in genuinely two-dimensional (2D) materials, the critical current density is theoretically zero, leaving the manifestation of SDE in the 2D limit an intriguing challenge. Here, we present the observation of SDE in a heterostructure composed of the topological insulator Bi$_2$Te$_3$ and the iron based superconductor Fe(Se,Te) $-$a candidate for topological superconductor$-$ where superconductivity is confined to the 2D limit. The observed I-V characteristics reveal nonreciprocity in the vortex-creep regime, where finite voltages arise due to the two-dimensional nature of superconductivity. Furthermore, our 2D film demonstrates abrupt voltage jumps, influenced by both the current flow direction and the transverse magnetic field direction. This behavior resembles that of 3D materials but, in this case, is driven by the vortex-flow instability, as illustrated by voltage controlled S-shaped I-V curves. These results underscore the pivotal role of vortex dynamics in SDE and provide new insights into the interplay between symmetry breaking and two-dimensionality in topological insulator/superconductor systems.

Title: Combined effects of particle geometry and applied vibrations on the mechanics and strength of entangled materials
Authors: Saeed Pezeshki, Francois Barthelat
Abstract: Entangled materials offer attractive structural features including tensile strength and large deformations, combined with infinite assembly and disassembly capabilities. How the geometry of individual particles governs entanglement, and in turn translates into macroscopic structural properties, provides a rich landscape in terms of mechanics and offers intriguing possibilities in terms of structural design. Despite this potential, there are major knowledge gaps on the entanglement mechanisms and how they can generate strength. In particular, vibrations are known to have strong effects on entanglement and disentanglement but the exact mechanisms underlying these observations are unknown. In this report we present tensile tests and discrete element method (DEM) simulations on bundles of entangled staple-like particles that capture the combined effects of particle geometry and vibrations on local entanglement, tensile force chains and strength. We show that standard steel staples with $\theta = 90^\circ$ crown-leg angle initially entangle better than $\theta = 20^\circ$ modified staples because of their more "open" geometry. However, as vibrations are applied entanglement increase faster in $\theta = 20^\circ$ bundles, so that they develop strong and stable tensile force chains, producing bundles which are almost ten times stronger than $\theta = 90^\circ$ bundles. Both tensile strength and entanglement density increase with vibrations and also with deformations, up to a steady state value. At that point the rate of entanglement equals the rate of disentanglement, and each of these rates remains relatively high. Finally, we show that vibration can be used as a manipulation strategy to either entangle or disentangle staple-like entangled granular materials, with confinement playing a significant role in determining whether vibration promotes entanglement or disentanglement.

Title: Nitrogen-Triggered Amorphization Enables High-Performance Solid-State Electrolytes
Authors: Bolong Hong, Lei Gao, Bingkai Zhang, Pengfei Nan, Ruishan Zhang, Yuhang Li, Zhihao Lei, Ming Liu, Jing Wu, Longbang Di, Haijin Ni, Songbai Han, Jinlong Zhu
Abstract: Amorphous solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) hold great promise for advancing the application of all-solid-state batteries (ASSBs), owing to their favorable ionic conductivity, structural tunability, and promising electrochemical performance. However, the absence of universal design principles for amorphous SSEs limits their development. By fundamentally re-evaluating the amorphization-forming ability of amorphous SSE systems, this study establishes a nitrogen-driven universal strategy to convert diverse metal chlorides into amorphous xLi3N-MCly (0.3 < 3x < 1.9; M denotes a metal element; 2 < y < 5) SSE. Nitrogen synergistically disrupts crystalline order via distorted coordination polyhedra and N-bridged networks, while dynamic bond reorganization enables rapid Li+ migration, achieving ionic conductivity of 2.02 mS cm-1 for 0.533Li3N-HfCl4 at 25 °C. Structural-property relationships reveal that high charge density and bridging capability of N3- enhance network disorder, shorten metal coordinating atom distances, and optimize Li+ diffusion pathway connectivity. ASSBs employing 0.533Li3N-HfCl4 retain 81.87% capacity after 2000 cycles at 1000 mA g-1 with high cathode loading (6.24 mg cm-2), demonstrating engineering viability. This work provides a paradigm for rational design of high-performance amorphous SSEs.

Title: Relationship among Structural, Disordered, Magnetism and Band Topology in MnSb2Te4(Sb2Te3)n Family
Authors: Ming Xi, Yuchong Zhang, Wenju Zhou, Famin Chen, Donghan Jia, Huiyang Gou, Tian Qian, Hechang Lei
Abstract: Interplay between topology and magnetism induces various exotic quantum phenomena, with magnetic topological insulators (MTIs) serving as a prominent example due to their ability to host the quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE). However, the realization of QAHE at higher temperature approaching magnetic-transition-temperature remains a significant challenge, primarily due to the scarcity of suitable material platforms and limited understanding of the intricate relationships between band topology, magnetism, and defects. Here, we report a comprehensive investigation of MnSb2Te4(Sb2Te3)n (n = 0 - 5) single crystals, including the discovery of novel MnSb8Te13 pure phase. Experimental measurements confirm that MnSb8Te13 exhibits ferromagnetism and features topologically nontrivial electronic structures, characterized by a Dirac point located further from the conduction band and a possible larger bulk gap compared to MnBi2Te4(Bi2Te3)n (n = 0 - 3). Moreover, we systematically analyze the relationship between structure, magnetism, topology, and disorder within Mn(Sb, Bi)2Te4((Sb, Bi)2Te3)n family. Present work will shed light on the exploration of potential platforms capable of achieving QAHE near magnetic transition temperature, offering new directions for advancing topological quantum materials.

Title: Ambient-Stable Transfer-Free Graphdiyne Wafers with Superhigh Hole Mobility at Room Temperature
Authors: Beining Ma, Jianyuan Qi, Xinghai Shen
Abstract: Graphdiyne (GDY) is recognized as a compelling candidate for the fabrication of next-generation high-speed low-energy electronic devices due to its inherent p-type semiconductor characteristics. However, the development of GDY for applications in field-effect transistors (FETs), complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS), and logic devices remains constrained by the relatively low carrier mobility reported in current experimental studies. Herein, the synthesis of layer-controlled hydrogen-substituted graphdiyne (HsGDY) films directly on silicon substrates under a supercritical CO2 atmosphere is reported, along with the fabrication of these films into HsGDY-based FETs. The transfer-free growth strategy eliminates performance degradation caused by post-synthesis transfer processes. The resulting HsGDY FETs exhibit a remarkable hole mobility of up to 3800 cm2 V-1 s-1 at room-temperature, which is an order of magnitude higher than that of most p-type semiconductors. The synthesis of transfer-free HsGDY wafers provides a new strategy for resolving the carrier mobility mismatch between p-channel and n-channel two-dimensional metal-oxide-semiconductor devices.

Title: Multiscale Magnetic Correlations in La2Mn2-xNixO6: Role of Crystal Structure in Double Perovskites
Authors: A. K. Bera, K. S. Chikara, B. Saha, S. M. Yusuf, Mohd. Nasir, S. Sen
Abstract: The magnetic correlations in double perovskites La2Mn2-xNixO6 (x = 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.25 and 1.5) have been systematically investigated across macroscopic, mesoscopic, and microscopic length scales using temperature-dependent bulk DC magnetization, neutron depolarization, and neutron powder diffraction measurements, respectivitly. The magnetic properties evolve from a long-range ferromagnetic (FM) order to a cluster ferromagnetic or spin-glass (FM or SG) behavior as the Ni concentration increases. This evolution is directly linked to changes in the crystal structure, transitioning from pure orthorhombic (x=0.5) to mixed orthorhombic and monoclinic (x=0.75-1.0), and eventually to mixed trigonal and monoclinic symmetries (x=1.25-1.5). Ni substitution enhances the magnetic ordering temperature from 170 K (x=0.5) to 280 K (x=1.0), but this is accompanied by a reduction in both magnetization and ordered magnetic moment. Beyond x=1.0, any long-range magnetic ordering is absent. Additionally, all compositions exhibit a reentrant spin-glass-like phase at low temperatures (below about 50 K). Neutron diffraction analysis confirms that long-range FM order occurs only in the orthorhombic phase, while the monoclinic and trigonal phases lack such magnetic ordering. The temperature-dependent magnetic correlations are closely connected to variations in crystal structural parameters, including lattice constants and unit cell volume. The electrical conductivity behavior, following the variable range hopping (VRH) model, highlights the role of multivalence Mn and Ni ions on the electrical properties. This study elucidates the microscopic mechanisms behind the tunable magnetic and electrical properties of La2Mn2-xNixO6, offering valuable insights for the design of advanced materials for spintronic applications.

Title: Quantum many-body analysis of a spin-2 bosons with two-body inelastic decay
Authors: Takeshi Takahashi, Hiroki Saito
Abstract: Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) of $^{87}\textrm{Rb}$ atoms with a hyperfine spin of 2 are open quantum systems, where the atoms are lost through two-body inelastic collisions. In this dissipation process, a collision channel with total spin of 4 is forbidden by angular momentum conservation, which results in magnetization of the atoms remaining in the condensate. Here, we investigate the quantum many-body properties of spin-2 bosons that undergo two-body atomic loss. We show that the system finally reaches a steady state, which is a mixture of the states with maximum total spins. In addition, we find that a non-classical steady state can be obtained by quenching the quadratic Zeeman coefficient.

Title: Interplay of choice and topology in percolation on mediation-driven attachment networks
Authors: Nilomber Roy, M. M. B. Sheraj, M. K. Hassan
Abstract: We investigate bond percolation on mediation-driven attachment (MDA) networks under the generalized Achlioptas process, where $M>1$ candidate bonds are sampled and the one that minimizes the resulting cluster size is selected the best-of-$M$ rule. This framework offers a systematic approach to investigate how network topology and choice mechanisms jointly shape percolation behavior. We analyze the effects of the degree exponent $\omega$ and the choice parameter $M$ on the critical point $t_c$ and the critical exponents ($\beta,\alpha,\gamma$), which define universality classes and obey the Rushbrooke inequality $\alpha + 2\beta + \gamma \geq 2$. Using entropy, the order parameter, and their derivatives (representing specific heat and susceptibility respectively), we show that both $t_c$ and the universality class depend only weakly on $\omega$ but strongly on $M$, while the Rushbrooke inequality remains valid throughout. For $M=2$, the order parameter varies continuously without a clear order-disorder transition. By contrast, $M=3$ and $M=4$ display explosive percolation that still corresponds to a continuous phase transition, with $M=4$ producing a significantly sharper and clearer order-disorder transition. This sharpening is traced to an enhanced powder-keg effect at larger $M$, underscoring the entropic origin of explosive percolation.

Title: Hybrid Quantum Systems: Coupling Single-Molecule Magnet Qudits with Industrial Silicon Spin Qubits
Authors: Daniel Schroller, Daniel Sitter, Thomas Koch, Viktor Adam, Noah Glaeser, Clement Godfrin, Stefan Kubicek, Julien Jussot, Roger Loo, Yosuke Shimura, Danny Wan, Yaorong Chen, Mario Ruben, Kristiaan De Greve, Wolfgang Wernsdorfer
Abstract: Molecular spin qudits offer an attractive platform for quantum memory, combining long coherence times with rich multi-level spin structures. Terbium bis(phthalocyaninato) (TbPc$_2$) exemplifies such systems, with demonstrated quantum control and chemical reproducibility. In hybrid quantum architectures, TbPc$_2$ can act as the primary memory element, with semiconductor qubits providing scalable readout and coupling. Here we present a step toward such a hybrid system: using an industrially manufactured silicon metal-oxide-semiconductor (SiMOS) spin qubit to detect electronic spin transitions of an ensemble of TbPc$_2$ molecules. The readout is based on a compact and robust protocol that applies a microwave pulse while all gate voltages defining the qubit are held at a fixed operating point. This protocol, which combines simultaneous Rapid adiabatic Passage and Spin- Selective tunneling (RPSS), enables high-contrast resonance detection and avoids repeated $\pi$-pulse recalibration common in decoupling schemes. By demonstrating ensemble detection, we establish a foundation for integrating molecular quantum memories with industrial qubit platforms and mark an important step toward single-molecule hybrid quantum technologies.

Title: Manipulating the metal-insulator transitions in correlated vanadium dioxide through bandwidth and band-filling control
Authors: Xiaohui Yao, Jiahui Ji, Xuanchi Zhou
Abstract: The metal-insulator transition (MIT) in correlated oxide systems opens up a new paradigm to trigger the abruption in multiple physical functionalities, enabling the possibility in unlocking exotic quantum states beyond conventional phase diagram. Nevertheless, the critical challenge for practical device implementation lies in achieving the precise control over the MIT behavior of correlated system across a broad temperature range, ensuring the operational adaptability in diverse environments. Herein, correlated vanadium dioxide (VO2) serves as a model system to demonstrate effective modulations on the MIT functionality through bandwidth and band-filling control. Leveraging the lattice mismatching between RuO2 buffer layer and TiO2 substrate, the in-plane tensile strain states in VO2 films can be continuously adjusted by simply altering the thickness of buffer layer, leading to a tunable MIT property over a wide range exceeding 20 K. Beyond that, proton evolution is unveiled to drive the structural transformation of VO2, with a pronounced strain dependence, which is accompanied by hydrogenation-triggered collective carrier delocalization through hydrogen-related band filling in t2g band. The present work establishes an enticing platform for tailoring the MIT properties in correlated electron systems, paving the way for the rational design in exotic electronic phases and physical phenomena.

Title: Atomic bonding in equilibrium single-component melts. The cases of arsenic, antimony and bismuth
Authors: Artem A. Tsygankov, Bulat N. Galimzyanov, Anatolii V. Mokshin
Abstract: In liquid pnictogens, quasi-stable structures can be formed near melting temperature. The nature of their stability does not have the unified point of view. In the present work, the task of determining the degree of atomic bonding in these structures is solved using the Crystal Orbital Hamilton Population (COHP) method. The original results of ab-initio simulation of arsenic, antimony and bismuth melts near their melting temperatures are used. It is shown that the features of the electron interaction at the level of $p$-orbitals determine the characteristic bond lengths and angles between atoms. It has been established that the stability of structures decreases according to a power law with an increase in the atomic mass of a chemical element and the number of atoms in the structure. The obtained results clarify the understanding the mechanisms of formation of quasi-stable structures in pnictogen melts from first principles.

Title: Scaling of Magnetic Domain Walls in Perpendicular Magnetic Anisotropy Systems
Authors: Guowen Gong, Changmin Xiong, Lijun Zhu
Abstract: Magnetic domain walls play a critical role in the nanoscale evolution of magnetic devices. Despite the early efforts, a complete understanding of the micromagnetic evolution of the width and the type of magnetic domain walls has still remained missing. Here, we report a combined analytical and micromagnetic simulation study and establish the scaling of the magnetic domains as a function of the exchange stiffness (A), uniaxial perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (Ku), saturation magnetization (Ms), and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), and shape anisotropy of the magnetic device. We find that the width of both Bloch and Neel walls scales excellently with the analytical prediction. The DMI is found to have little influence on the domain wall width but strongly affect the type of the domain wall. The domain wall has a Bloch configuration at zero DMI and gradually transitions to Neel configuration upon increase of the DMI. The shape anisotropy of the magnetic domain wall also affects the domain wall width. These results have established a comprehensive, conclusive understanding of the magnetic domain walls within spintronics devices.

Abstract: We studied single-particle Anderson localization in ensembles of graphs that correspond to chiral and Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) symmetry classes. For a random biregular bipartite graph with chiral symmetry, the density of states was found using the cavity approach. Calculating the fractal dimension shows the effects of disordered zero modes. For Bogoliubov-de Gennes ensembles with an underlying random regular graph (RRG), the density of states was calculated both numerically and analytically. The ensembles BdG-RRG with symmetry-conserving diagonal disorder in the delocalized phase have a smaller fractal dimension compared to the usual RRG.

Title: Vortex matter and strong pinning in underdoped PrFeAs(O,F) with atomic-sized defects
Authors: Andrey V. Sadakov, Vladimir A. Vlasenko, A.Yu. Levakhova, I.V. Zhuvagin, E.M. Fomina, V.A. Prudkoglyad, A.Y. Tsvetkov, A.S. Usoltsev, N. D. Zhigadlo
Abstract: We present a comprehensive investigation of the field-dependent critical current density and pinning force, combined with a detailed analysis of the nanostructural defect landscape in single crystal of underdoped PrFeAs(O,F) superconductor. Our study demonstrates that for both in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic field orientations critical current density exhibits a strong pinning regime in intermediate fields across the entire temperature range. The dominant contribution to pinning originates from oxygen-to-fluorine substitutional defects, oxygen vacancies, which all act as point defects via a quasiparticle mean free path fluctuation mechanism. Scanning transmission electron microscope studies did not reveal any volume or surface defect types within the lattice.

Title: A continued fraction approximation for the effective elasticity tensor of two-dimensional polycrystals as a function of the crystal elasticity tensor
Authors: Graeme W. Milton
Abstract: For two-dimensional polycrystals the effective elasticity tensor $C_*$ as a function $C_*(C_0)$ of the elasticity tensor $C_0$ of the constituent crystal is considered. It is shown that this function can be approximated by one with a continued fraction expansion resembling that associated with a class of microstructure known as sequential laminates. These are hierarchical microstructures defined inductively. Rank 0 sequential laminates are simply rotations of the pure crystal. Rank $j$ sequential laminates are obtained by laminating together, on a length scale much larger that the existing microstructure and with interfaces perpendicular to some direction $n_j$, rank $j-1$ sequential laminates with a rotation of the pure crystal. The continued fraction approximation for arbitrary polycrystal microstructures typically takes a more general form than that of sequential laminates, but has some free parameters. It is an open question as to whether these free parameters can always be adjusted so the continued fraction approximation matches exactly that of a sequential laminate. If so, one would have established that the elastic response of two-dimensional polycrystals can always be mimicked by that of sequential laminates. Our analysis carries over to the more general case where the strain is replaced by a field $E(x)$ that is the gradient of a vector potential $u(x)$, i.e. $E=\nabla u$ and the stress is replaced by a matrix valued field $J(x)$ that need not be symmetric but has zero divergence $\nabla\cdot J=0$. The tensor $L(x)$ entering the constitutive relation $J=L E$ is locally a rotation of the tensor $L_0$ of the pure crystal that need not have any special symmetries and has 16 independent tensor elements.

Title: Defect-driven incoherent skin localization
Authors: Emmanouil T. Kokkinakis, Konstantinos G. Makris, Eleftherios N. Economou
Abstract: The process of dephasing during wave evolution has traditionally been viewed as an obstacle to localization, leading to diffusion even in strongly disordered Hermitian lattices. In contrast, here we demonstrate how the interplay of dephasing with non-Hermitian defects can be harnessed to engineer wave localization. Specifically, we identify a novel dynamical localization phenomenon characterized by wavefunction accumulation at the lattice's boundary due solely to dephasing, despite globally reciprocal couplings. Furthermore, we study the incoherent skin effect arising from coupling asymmetry, and investigate the interplay between these antagonistic localization mechanisms. By reframing dephasing from a hindrance into a tool, this study overturns established paradigms of wave localization and paves the way for novel approaches to controlling localization phenomena in non-Hermitian physics.

Title: Roles of Electrically Excited Magnons in Unidirectional Magnetoresistance of Metallic Magnetic Bilayers
Authors: Shashank Gupta, Steven S.-L. Zhang
Abstract: Unidirectional magnetoresistance (UMR) in metallic bilayers arises from nonlinear spin-charge transport mediated by broken time-reversal and inversion symmetries, yet the role of magnons remains unsettled. We develop a theoretical framework that incorporates coupled electron-magnon dynamics, revealing cross diffusion and spin-angular-momentum transfer between the two subsystems, which renormalize the characteristic electron and magnon spin-diffusion lengths. We show that nonequilibrium magnons, indirectly excited by the electric field, can suppress UMR by absorbing spin angular momentum from conduction electrons. We also analyze the magnetic-field, thickness, and temperature dependencies and identify distinct features that constitute experimental fingerprints of magnonic contributions to UMR in metallic bilayers, providing qualitative to semiquantitative guidance for elucidating the underlying physical mechanisms.

Title: Atomic-Scale Origins of Oxidation Resistance in Amorphous Boron Nitride

Abstract: Amorphous boron nitride (\textrm{$\alpha$}-BN) is a promising ultrathin barrier for nanoelectronics, yet the atomistic mechanisms governing its chemical stability remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate the structure-property relationship that dictates the oxidation of \textrm{$\alpha$}-BN using a combination of machine-learning molecular dynamics simulations and angle-resolved X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The simulations reveal that the film structure, controlled by synthesis conditions, is the critical factor determining oxidation resistance. Dense, chemically ordered networks with a high fraction of B-N bonds effectively resist oxidation by confining it to the surface, whereas porous, defect-rich structures with abundant homonuclear B-B and N-N bonds permit oxygen penetration and undergo extensive bulk degradation. These computational findings are consistent with experimental trends observed in \textrm{$\alpha$}-BN films grown by chemical vapour deposition. XPS analysis shows that a film grown at a higher temperature develops a more ordered structure with a B/N ratio nearer to stoichiometric and exhibits superior resistance to surface oxidation compared to its more defective, lower-temperature counterpart. Together, these results demonstrate that the oxidation resistance of \textrm{$\alpha$}-BN is a tunable property directly linked to its atomic-scale morphology, providing a clear framework for engineering chemically robust dielectric barriers for future nanoelectronic applications.

Title: Osmotic forces modify lipid membrane fluctuations
Authors: Amaresh Sahu
Abstract: In hydrodynamic descriptions of lipid bilayers, the membrane is often approximated as being impermeable to the surrounding, solute-containing fluid. However, biological and in vitro lipid membranes are influenced by their permeability and the resultant osmotic forces -- whose effects remain poorly understood. Here, we study the dynamics of a fluctuating, planar lipid membrane that is ideally selective: fluid can pass through it, while the electrically-neutral solutes cannot. We find that the canonical membrane relaxation mode, in which internal membrane forces are balanced by fluid drag, no longer exists over all wavenumbers. Rather, this mode only exists when it is slower than solute diffusion -- corresponding to a finite range of wavenumbers. The well-known equipartition result quantifying the size of membrane undulations due to thermal perturbations is consequently limited in its validity to the aforementioned range. Moreover, this range shrinks as the membrane surface tension is increased, and above a critical tension the membrane mode vanishes. Our findings are relevant when interpreting experimental measurements of membrane fluctuations, especially in vesicles at moderate to high tensions.

Title: Ferromagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy on the Kagome Magnet MgMn$_6$Sn$_6$
Authors: Riju Pal, Kakan Deb, Nitesh Kumar, Bernd Büchner, Alexey Alfonsov, Vladislav Kataev
Abstract: MgMn$_6$Sn$_6$ is the itinerant ferromagnet on the kagome lattice with high ordering temperature featuring complex electronic properties due to the nontrivial topological electronic band structure, where the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) plays a crucial role. Here, we report a detailed ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) spectroscopic study of MgMn$_6$Sn$_6$ aimed to elucidate and quantify the intrinsic magnetocrystalline anisotropy that is responsible for the alignment of the Mn magnetic moments in the kagome plane. By analyzing the frequency, magnetic field, and temperature dependences of the FMR modes, we have quantified the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy density that reaches the value of approximately $ 3.5\cdot 10^6$ erg/cm$^3$ at $T = 3$ K and reduces to about $1\cdot 10^6$ erg/cm$^3$ at $T = 300$ K. The revealed significantly strong magnetic anisotropy suggests a sizable contribution of the orbital magnetic moment to the spin magnetic moment of Mn, supporting the scenario of the essential role of SOC for the nontrivial electronic properties of MgMn$_6$Sn$_6$.

Title: Controllable Domain Wall Memories with Magnetic Topological Insulator
Authors: Arifa Hoque, Sanjukta Bhanja
Abstract: Domain wall memories have undergone several changes over the years for faster shift, read, and write operations; however, fundamental issues persist due to creating pinning sites topographically along the nanowire. The deformity in notches creates non-uniform pinning strength, leading to multiple faults during shift operation. This study proposes a novel approach to address these challenges and gain greater control over domain manipulation for advanced applications in Boolean and non-Boolean paradigms. Utilizing the magnetic topological insulator (MTI) can create pinning sites without potentially faulty topographical notches made through complex lithography. Moreover, applying an external current enables precise control over the pinning potentials at these sites. Micromagnetic simulations validate the effectiveness of MTI-based pinning sites, showcasing their potential for future applications. Our approach introduces an alternative method for creating pinning sites by cross-architecture of ferromagnetic nanowires and MTI nanobars, inducing exchange interaction at their intersection points. This method offers simplicity of fabrication and enables control over the pinning strength by external current.

Title: Breakdown of the Wiedemann-Franz law in an interacting quantum Hall metamaterial
Authors: Patrice Roche, Carles Altimiras, François D. Parmentier, Olivier Maillet
Abstract: Quantum heat transport by electrons in ballistic channels is usually well-described in the Landauer-Büttiker framework, which fails when introducing strong Coulomb interactions. We theoretically show that a chain of small metallic dots where charge cannot accumulate, connected by chiral ballistic channels, conducts heat better than charge. We relate this feature to the competition between heat diffusion by neutral excitations and Coulomb interactions in the chain, which defines a temperature gradient over a finite characteristic length. We show that the Lorenz ratio can be arbitrarily large, scaling as the square root of the chain's length, which suggests new approaches for heat manipulation in mesoscopic systems.

Title: Electric Polarization-Driven Modulation of Fe Adatoms on Ferroelectric $α$-In$_2$Se$_3$
Authors: Monirul Shaikh, Aleksander L. Wysocki
Abstract: The interplay among structural, electronic, and magnetic properties of Fe adatoms on the surface of two-dimensional ferroelectric {\alpha}-In$_2$Se$_3$ is investigated using first-principles electronic structure calculations, with a focus on how these properties are modulated by the direction of the electric polarization of the substrate. We identify two competing adsorption sites for Fe adatoms, whose relative stability depends on the adatom concentration and can be reversed by switching the electric polarization of {\alpha}-In$_2$Se$_3$. The calculated energy barrier for thermally activated hopping between these sites is approximately 0.4 eV, corresponding to a blocking temperature of around 100 K. The hybridization between Fe and In$_2$Se$_3$ orbitals strongly depends on the adsorption site and polarization direction, driven by variations in the local adatom geometry. As a result, the electronic configuration of adatom, magnetic moment, and magnetic anisotropy exhibit a pronounced site dependence and can be effectively modulated by switching the electric polarization of the In$_2$Se$_3$ layer. In particular, at higher adatom concentrations, an exceptionally large perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, exceeding 200 meV per Fe atom, emerges for one polarization direction, but is largely diminished when the polarization is reversed. These findings indicate that ferroelectric substrates offer a promising route for voltage-controlled tuning of magnetic adatom properties via reversible polarization switching.

Title: Proof of the exact diffusion constant via first passage time in quasi-periodic potentials
Authors: Ming Gong
Abstract: Brownian motion in terms of Lifson and Jackson (LJ) formula has been widely explored in periodic systems and it has been believed for a long time that the LJ formula only applies to periodic potentials. Recently we show that for the following Brownian motion $\gamma \dot{x} = -U'(x) + \xi$, where $U(x)$ is the quasi-periodic potential, the effective diffusion constant can still be described by the LJ formula $D^* = D/(\langle \exp(\beta U)\rangle \langle \exp(-\beta U)\rangle)$, where the average is redefined as $\langle \exp(\beta U)\rangle = \lim_{L\rightarrow \infty} L^{-1} \int_0^L \exp(\beta U(x))dx$. In this manuscript we prove this result exactly using the mean first passage time $\tau(x)$, with boundary conditions $\tau(\pm L) = 0$, and show that the effective diffusion constant can be determined using $D^* =\lim_{L \rightarrow \infty} L^2/(2\tau(0))$, where $\pm L$ is the two positions of the absorbing boundary. We exactly solve the equation of motion of $\tau(x)$ and obtain the above result with the aid of Jacobi-Anger expansion method. Our result can be generalized to the other potentials and even higher dimensions, which can greatly broaden our understanding of Brownian motion in more general circumstances. The requirement for a well-defined effective diffusion constant $D^*$ in more general potentials is also discussed.

Title: Growth control of highly textured Bi2Te3 thin films by pulsed laser deposition
Authors: Damian Brzozowski, Yu Liu, Karola Neeleman, Magnus Nord, Ingrid G. Hallsteinsen
Abstract: Two-dimensional materials have attracted growing interest due to their unique electronic properties and potential applications in spintronics. Interfacing strongly spin-orbit-coupled chalcogenides with functional oxides such as perovskites has a particularly high potential. In this work, highly textured Bi2Te3 thin films were deposited on (111) oriented SrTiO3 by pulsed laser deposition. We show that, by careful selection of the temperature and pressure of growth, the film's stoichiometry can be manipulated between direct stoichiometry transfer from the target and tellurium-deficient phases. Optimized pulsed laser deposition enables the growth of films with coalesced, faceted grains with grain sizes reaching up to 430 nm, while preserving crystalline quality comparable to that of molecular-beam-epitaxy-grown films. We show striking differences arising from tuning the laser's pulsing frequency and fluence, which lead to changes in surface roughness, the film's porosity, and grain boundaries, as well as grain shape. Analysis of cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy images reveals a sharp substrate-film interface without atomic intermixing and without the formation of amorphous intermediate layers. The results demonstrate that pulsed laser deposition is a viable method for producing high-quality Bi2Te3 thin films and opens the door to the integration of chalcogenides with perovskites with this growth technique.

Title: Anisotropic Strain Engineering in La0.7Sr0.3MnO3/LaFeO3 Superlattice: Structural Relaxation and Domain Formation
Authors: Yu Liu, Thea Marie Dale, Emma van der Minne, Susanne Boucher, Romar Avila, Christoph Klewe, Gertjan Koster, Magnus Nord, Mari-Ann Einarsrud, Ingrid Hallsteinsen
Abstract: Anisotropic strain engineering in epitaxial oxide films provides new opportunities to control the antiferromagnetic and structural properties crucial for advancements of antiferromagnetic spintronics. Here we report on a (La0.7Sr0.3MnO3/LaFeO3)4 superlattice grown on (101)o DyScO3 substrate which imposes significant anisotropic in-plane strain. Reciprocal space mapping reveals selective strain relaxation along the tensile in-plane [010]o axis, while compression along the perpendicular in-plane [-101]o axis remains strained. Scanning precession electron diffraction and higher-order Laue zone analysis show that the relaxation is accommodated by structural domain formation in the LaFeO3 layers, initiating from the second bilayer and propagating out-of-plane. These domains minimise structural defects and correlate with the substrate step edges. X-ray magnetic dichroism measurements reveal bulk-like in-plane antiferromagnetic order with polydomain signature as previously reported. Our findings reveal the presence of structural domains coexisting with antiferromagnetic polydomain states, showing a strain-domain-magnetism relationship that provides insights for applications of strain engineering in spintronics applications.

Title: Resolving the Structural Duality of Graphene Grain Boundaries

Abstract: Grain boundaries (GBs) are ubiquitous in large-scale graphene samples, playing a crucial role in their overall performance. Due to their complexity, they are usually investigated as model structures, under the assumption of a fully relaxed interface. Here, we present cantilever-based non-contact atomic force microscopy (ncAFM) as a suitable technique to resolve, atom by atom, the complete structure of these linear defects. Our experimental findings reveal a richer scenario than expected, with the coexistence of energetically stable and metastable graphene GBs. Although both GBs are structurally composed of pentagonal and heptagonal like rings, they can be differentiated by the irregular geometric shapes present in the metastable boundaries. Theoretical modeling and simulated ncAFM images, accounting for the experimental data, show that metastable GBs form under compressive uniaxial strain and exhibit vertical corrugation, whereas stable GBs remain in a fully relaxed, flat configuration. By locally introducing energy with the AFM tip, we show the possibility to manipulate the metastable GBs, driving them toward their minimum energy configuration. Notably, our high-resolution ncAFM images reveal a clear dichotomy: while the structural distortions of metastable grain boundaries are confined to just a few atoms, their impact on graphene's properties extends over significantly larger length scales.

Title: Constructing a Nanopipette-based DNA Electro-Mechanical Device
Authors: Cengiz J. Khan, Oliver J. Irving, Rand A. Al-Waqfi, Giorgio Ferrari, Tim Albrecht
Abstract: Solid-state nanopore and nanopipette sensors are powerful devices for the detection, quantification and structural analysis of biopolymers such as DNA and proteins, especially in carrier-enhanced resistive-pulse sensing. However, hundreds of different molecules typically need to be sampled from solution and analysed to obtain statistically robust information. This limits the applicability of such sensors and complicates associated workflows. Here, we present a new strategy to trap DNA structures in the sensing region of a nanopipette through end functionalisation and nanoparticle capping. We develop a robust set of descriptors to characterise the insertion and presence of nanoparticle-DNA constructs in the nanopipette tip and, furthermore, show that they remain mobile and responsive to external electric fields over extended periods of time. This allows for repeated readout of the same DNA structure and could enable new applications for such sensors, for example in flow and in confined environments.

Title: A ferroelectric junction transistor memory made from switchable van der Waals p-n heterojunctions

Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) p-n heterojunctions are important building blocks for advanced electronics and optoelectronics, in which high-quality heterojunctions essentially determine device performances or functionalities. Creating tunable depletion regions with substantially suppressed leakage currents presents huge challenges, but is crucial for heterojunction applications. Here, by using band-aligned p-type SnSe and n-type ferroelectric {\alpha}-In2Se3 as a model, we report near-ideal multifunctional vdW p-n heterojunctions with small reverse leakage currents (0.1 pA) and a desired diode ideality factor (1.95). As-fabricated junction transistors exhibit superior performance, such as a high on/off ratio of over 105. Importantly, we realize ferroelectric-tuned band alignment with a giant barrier modulation of 900 meV. Based on such tunable heterojunctions, we propose and demonstrate a fundamental different device termed ferroelectric junction field-effect transistor memory, which shows large memory windows (1.8 V), ultrafast speed (100 ns), high operation temperature (393 K), and low cycle-to-cycle variation (2 %). Additionally, the reliable synaptic characteristics of these memory devices promise low-power neuromorphic computing. Our work provides a new device platform with switchable memory heterojunctions, applicable to high performance brain-inspired electronics and optoelectronics.

Title: Time domain braiding of anyons revealed through a nonequilibrium fluctuation dissipation theorem
Authors: Ines Safi
Abstract: We derive a novel fluctuation--dissipation theorem (FDT) valid for nonequilibrium initial states that imprint the braiding of anyons in the time domain. The derivation is carried out within the Unifying Nonequilibrium Perturbative Theory (UNEPT), which applies to both standard reservoir geometries and configurations with one or two quantum point contacts (QPCs) injecting dilute anyonic fluxes. Based on this FDT, we propose complementary methods to determine the time-domain braiding phase. The first method relates the DC backscattering noise to the integral of the current with respect to DC drives, while the second connects the AC current phase shift to the DC noise. The latter provides a particularly robust probe of the statistical angle $\theta$, offering an intrinsic calibration and cancelling certain nonuniversal renormalization effects. Specializing to a thermalized Tomonaga--Luttinger liquid (TLL), we further show that in the quantum regime the phase shift enables a direct determination of the scaling dimension $\delta$ when $\delta > 1/2$. These results define experimentally accessible schemes to extract either $\theta$ or $\delta$ in minimal single-QPC setups, without relying on interferometry or cross-correlation measurements.

Title: Supercurrent interference and its transfer in a kagome superconductor
Authors: Heng Wu, Houssam el Mrabet Haje, Michiel Dubbelman, Brenden R. Ortiz, Stephen D. Wilson, Mazhar N. Ali, Yaojia Wang
Abstract: Superconductivity represents a macroscopic quantum state notable for its rich manifestations of electronic coherence and collective behavior. Kagome materials AV3Sb5 (A= K, Cs, Rb) possess cascade intertwined quantum phases including superconductivity, symmetry-breaking charge orders, nematic orders and topological states, making them attractive materials for exploring exotic superconducting states. However, the superconducting properties and the Cooper pairing behaviors have not been fully explored and understood. In this work, by studying both the magnetoresistance and critical current behaviors in KV3Sb5 ring and pristine flakes, we reveal the charge 2e paring in KV3Sb5 although anomalous oscillations with smaller periodicity were observed, and report the intrinsic superconducting phase coherence in KV3Sb5 flakes. The former is demonstrated by the careful verification of the Little-Parks oscillations in differential resistance colormaps, and the latter indicates the existence of superconducting domains in KV3Sb5. Moreover, we observed a special phenomenon: the transfer of supercurrent interference patterns between the superconducting ring and the superconducting flake, which demonstrates the global critical current effect of the superconducting phase coherence. These findings provide new insights into the Cooper pairing behaviors in KV3Sb5 and highlight the importance of global effect of superconducting phase coherence in the understanding of the superconducting behaviors.

Title: Near room temperature magnetoelectric response and tunable magnetic anisotropy in the two-dimensional magnet 1T-CrTe2
Authors: Fengping Li, Bheema Lingam Chittari, Chao Lei, Jeil Jung
Abstract: Magnets with controllable magnetization and high critical temperature are essential for practical spintronics devices, among which the two-dimensional 1T-CrTe2 stands out because of its high experimental critical temperature up to about 300K down to the single layer limit. By using ab initio density functional theory, we investigate the magnetic properties of monolayer and bilayer 1T-CrTe2 and demonstrate that the magnetic properties, such as the magnetocrystalline anisotropy, critical Curie temperature and magnetizations, can be influenced by strain or electric fields.

Title: Breaking the Sabatier Principle by Dynamic Adsorption-Desorption Decoupling in Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution
Authors: Zi-Xuan Yang, Lei Li, Tao Huang, Hui Wan, X.S. Wang, Gui-Fang Huang, Wangyu Hu, Wei-Qing Huang
Abstract: The Sabatier principle establishes a fundamental trade-off in heterogeneous this http URL the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), this trade-off is manifested by the coupling of Volmer step, which requires strong hydrogen adsorption, with the Heyrovsky/Tafel step, which favors facile desorption, thus giving rise to the classical volcano relationship and limiting activity even at $\Delta G=0$. Here, we demonstrate a ferroelectric platform with dynamic tunability -- monolayer GeS$_2$ decorated with transition metal atoms as a proof-of-concept -- where polarization-driven surface electronic reconstruction enables real-time modulation of intermediate binding strength, thereby breaking the Sabatier constraint. Reversible control of hydrogen adsorption allows strong H binding to accelerate the Volmer step, followed by weakened adsorption to promote the Heyrovsky/Tafel this http URL dynamic adsorption-desorption decoupling not only surpasses the volcano limit to achieve unprecedented HER activity, but also establishes a general paradigm for designing adaptive electrocatalysts capable of reconfiguring under operating conditions.

Title: RKKY interaction in Weyl semimetal nanowires
Authors: Rohit Mukherjee, Asutosh Dubey
Abstract: We investigate the effective couplings induced between localized impurities on the surface of a Weyl semimetal (WSM) nanowire within the framework of Ruderman--Kittel--Kasuya--Yosida (RKKY) theory. The itinerant electrons from the chiral Fermi arc surface states mediate impurity-impurity interaction at low energies. As a result, the spin-momentum locking naturally plays a central role in shaping the spin-spin correlations. We show that the dominant interaction channels have distinct origins: while the azimuthal coupling, $J_{\phi\phi}$ term arises exclusively from Fermi arc states with identical spin polarization, the couplings $J_{\mu\nu}$ ($\mu,\nu = z,r$) are governed by Fermi arc states with opposite spin polarizations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that purely surface-mediated contributions exhibit different scaling behavior compared to those involving Fermi arcs and low-energy bulk states. We systematically untangle the contributions from bulk and surface states to the RKKY couplings, using analytical and numerical methods. Our results establish WSM nanowires as a versatile platform for engineering and simulating a broad class of spin models.

Title: Weak-anti-localization-to-spin-dependent scattering at a proximity-magnetized heavy metal interface
Authors: Hisakazu Matsuki, Guang Yang, Jiahui Xu, Vitaly N. Golovach, Yu He, Jiaxu Li, Alberto Hijano, Niladri Banerjee, Iuliia Alekhina, Nadia Stelmashenko, F. Sebastian Bergeret, Jason W. A. Robinson
Abstract: A change in a materials electrical resistance with magnetic field (magnetoresistance) results from quantum interference effects and, or spin-dependent transport, depending on materials properties and dimensionality. In disordered conductors, electron interference leads to weak localization or anti-localization; in contrast, ferromagnetic conductors support spin-dependent scattering, leading to giant magnetoresistance (GMR). By varying the thickness of Au between 4 and 28 nm in a EuS/Au/EuS spin-switches, we observe a crossover from weak anti-localization to interfacial GMR. The crossover is related to a magnetic proximity effect in Au due to electron scattering at the insulating EuS interface. The proximity-induced exchange field in Au suppresses weak anti-localization, consistent with Maekawa-Fukuyama theory. With increasing Au thickness, GMR emerges along with spin Hall magnetoresistance. These findings demonstrate spin transport governed by interfacial exchange fields, building a framework for spintronic functionality without metallic magnetism.

Title: Topology and Martensitic Phase Transformations
Authors: M. Yin, D. D. Vvedensky
Abstract: Triply periodic minimal surfaces (TPMS) are discovered to conform to surfaces of given charge density distributions embedded in crystals [Z. Kristallogr. \textbf{170}, 138 (1985)]. Based on our previous work [Phys. Rev. Mater. \textbf{9}, 073802 (2025)], we discovered that crystals can have surfaces of a given charge density converging to TPMS. We also discovered that end states connected by a martensitic phase transformation should have their corresponding TPMS being topologically equivalent. In this work, we gave an explanation for the topological continuity of a martensitic phase transformation and studied how TPMS indicate whether a non-magnetic crystal can undergo a martensitic phase transformation or not.

Title: Non-unitary Time Evolution via the Chebyshev Expansion Method
Authors: Áron Holló, Dániel Varjas, Cosma Fulga, László Oroszlány, Viktor Könye
Abstract: The Chebyshev expansion method is a well-established technique for computing the time evolution of quantum states, particularly in Hermitian systems with a bounded spectrum. Here, we show that the applicability of the Chebyshev expansion method extends well beyond this constraint: It remains valid across the entire complex plane and is thus suitable for arbitrary non-Hermitian matrices. We identify that numerical rounding errors are the primary source of errors encountered when applying the method outside the conventional spectral bounds, and they are not caused by fundamental limitations. By carefully selecting the spectral radius and the time step, we show how these errors can be effectively suppressed, enabling accurate time evolution calculations in non-Hermitian systems. We derive an analytic upper bound for the rounding error, which serves as a practical guideline for selecting time steps in numerical simulations. As an application, we illustrate the performance of the method by computing the time evolution of wave packets in the Hatano-Nelson model.

Title: Near-room-temperature antiferromagnetism in Janus Fe$X$F ($X$ = O, S) monolayers
Authors: Xixiang Zhang, Busheng Wang, Yanfeng Ge, Yong Liu, Wenhui Wan
Abstract: Inspired by the recently synthesized hexagonal layered phase of FeF$_2$, we studied the magnetic properties of the 1T-FeF$_2$ monolayer and its Janus Fe$X$F ($X$ = O, S) derivatives by first-principles calculations. Our results confirm that these materials are antiferromagnetic semiconductors, and that anion substitution effectively tunes their material properties: the band gap shifts from 3.37 eV (direct, FeF$_2$) to 2.35 eV (direct, FeOF) and 1.13 eV (indirect, FeSF); the magnetic moment of Fe ions increases; and the Néel temperature ($T_N$) rises dramatically to 248 K (FeSF) and 207 K (FeOF). Janus structures exhibit enhanced magnetic moment and direct AFM coupling. Under compression, $T_N$ is further optimized to 274 K ($-2$\% strain, FeSF) and 244 K ($-5$\% strain, FeOF). Both Janus materials retain their semiconducting nature and direction of easy magnetization axis under $\pm5$\% strain. This study validates the Janus structure as a viable approach to enhance 2D antiferromagnetism and highlights Fe-based oxyhalides as promising spintronic materials.

Title: Integrable Model of a Superconductor with non-Fermi liquid and Mott Phases
Authors: Santhosh M, Jorge Dukelsky, Gerardo Ortiz
Abstract: We present and analyze an exactly solvable interacting fermionic pairing model, which features interactions that entangle states at momenta $\mathbf{k}$ and $-\mathbf{k}$. These interactions give rise to novel correlated ground states, leading to a rich phase diagram that includes superconducting, multiple metallic, and Mott-insulating phases. At finite interaction strengths, we observe the emergence of multiple many-body Fermi surfaces, which violate Luttinger's theorem and challenge the conventional Landau-Fermi liquid paradigm. A distinguishing feature of our model is that it remains quantum integrable, even with the addition of pairing interactions of various symmetries, setting it apart from the Hatsugai-Kohmoto model. Our results provide an analytically tractable framework for studying strong correlation effects that give rise to fractionalized excitations and unconventional superconductivity, offering valuable insights into a broad class of integrable many-body systems.

Abstract: Ultrasonic wave propagation across material surfaces reveals essential information about the materials' elastic behavior. The elastodynamic response of the surface is characterized by the Green's function that fully captures all its direction-dependent and frequency-dependent features. Here we present the first direct experimental visualization of the Green's function, including all its complex details resulting from elastic anisotropy. We achieve this visualization using a dedicated modification of transient grating spectroscopy (TGS), which is a method otherwise well established for measuring Rayleigh-type surface acoustic waves. To overcome the limitations of conventional TGS, we explore near-field thermoacoustic phenomena occurring within TGS experiments. We reveal that, along with the transient standing-wave patterns that diminish within hundreds of nanoseconds, there also emerge ultra-transient oscillations with lifetimes at least an order of magnitude shorter. These ultra-transient effects enable capturing the surface acoustic response with exceptional detail, and the resulting experimental angular dispersion maps strikingly replicate the theoretical Green's functions. By utilizing this feature, ultra-transient grating spectroscopy (UTGS) becomes a powerful new tool for detailed contactless characterization of anisotropic solids, opening new pathways for studying single-crystalline materials utilized in diverse modern application fields, including solid-state cooling via the elastocaloric effect, magnetoelastic devices, or nanoscale electromechanical systems.

Title: Revisiting YH$_9$ Superconductivity and Predicting High-T$_c$ in GdYH$_5$
Authors: M. A. Rastkhadiv
Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity in $\mathrm{YH_{9}}$ with a critical temperature of approximately $T_c\sim 243 \ K$ has opened a new window toward room temperature superconductivity. In this work, we employ the lowest order constrained variational method to investigate the thermodynamic and magnetic properties of the $\mathrm{YH_{9}}$ structure, obtaining results in good agreement with experimental data. % Based on the robustness of the LOCV approach for describing high-$T_c$ superconductors, we further extend our analysis to the gadolinium-yttrium-hydrogen system across various stoichiometries. The key finding of this study is the prediction of a superconducting phase transition at $T_c = 223.2~\mathrm{K}$ for $\mathrm{GdYH_{5}}$ under a critical pressure of approximately $157~\mathrm{GPa}$. This compound crystallizes in a tetragonal structure with space group $P4/mmm$. Moreover, the calculated gap ratio confirms that $\mathrm{GdYH_{5}}$ is a type-II superconductor with a critical current density suitable for potential industrial applications.

Title: Approach to zigzag and checkerboard patterns in spatially extended systems
Authors: Manoj C. Warambhe, Prashant M. Gade
Abstract: Zigzag patterns in one dimension or checkerboard patterns in two dimensions occur in a variety of pattern-forming systems. We introduce an order parameter `phase defect' to identify this transition and help to recognize the associated universality class on a discrete lattice. In one dimension, if $x_{i}(t)$ is a variable value at site $i$ at time $t$. We assign spin $s_i(t)=1$ for $x_{i}(t)>x_{i-1}(t)$, $s_i(t)=-1$ if $x_{i}(t)<x_{i-1}(t)$, and $s_i(t)=0$ if $x_{i}(t)=x_{i-1}(t)$. The phase defect $D(t)$ is defined as $D(t)={\frac{\sum_{i=1}^N \vert s_i(t)+s_{i-1}(t)\vert} {2N}}$ for a lattice of $N$ sites with periodic boundary conditions. It is zero for a zigzag pattern. In two dimensions, $D(t)$ is the sum of row-wise as well as column-wise phase defects and is zero for the checkerboard pattern. The persistence $P(t)$ is the fraction of sites whose spin value did not change even once till time $t$. We find that $D(t)\sim t^{-\delta}$ and $P(t)\sim t^{-\theta}$ for the parameter range over which the zigzag or checkerboard pattern is realized. We observe that $\delta=0.5$ and $\theta=3/8$ for 1-d coupled logistic maps or Gauss maps, and $\theta=0.22$ and $\delta=0.45$ in 2-d logistic or Gauss maps. The exponent $\theta$ matches with the persistence exponent at zero temperature for the Ising model, and $\delta$ matches with the exponent for the Ising model at the critical temperature. This power-law decay is observed over a range of parameter values and not just critical point.

Abstract: The growth of two-dimensional epitaxial materials on industrially relevant substrates is critical for enabling their scalable synthesis and integration into next-generation technologies. Here we present a comprehensive study of the molecular beam epitaxial growth of gallium selenide on 2-inch c-plane sapphire substrates. Using in-situ reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED), in-situ Raman spectroscopy, optical and scanning electron microscopies, we construct a diagram of the gallium selenide growth modes as a function of substrate temperature (530-650 °C) and Se/Ga flux ratio (5-110). The growth mode diagram reveals distinct regimes, including the growth of layered post-transition metal monochalcogenide GaSe with an unstrained in-plane lattice constant of 0.371$\pm$0.001 nm and a partial epitaxial alignment on sapphire. This work demonstrates a RHEED-based pathway for synthesizing gallium selenide of specific phase and morphology, and the construction of a phase diagram for high vapor pressure III-VI compounds that can be applied to a wide range of other metal chalcogenide materials.

Title: Fluidity and morphological stability of an amorphous thin film with radiation-induced defect kinetics
Authors: Tyler P. Evans, Eden Heyen
Abstract: It is common to model ion-irradiated amorphous thin films as if they were highly viscous fluids. In such models, one is frequently concerned with the ion-enhanced fluidity, a measure of the ability of the free interface to relax surface energy. Motivated by usual fluid dynamics problems, the ion-enhanced fluidity is near-universally treated as a constant throughout the amorphous layer. However, for an irradiated thin film, the fluidity is ultimately caused by radiation-induced defect kinetics within the film, leading to regions with greater or lesser fluidity, and sensitive dependence on ion energy, species, flux, irradiation angle, temperature, and other experimental parameters. Here, we develop and analyze a model of radiation-induced defect kinetics coupled to the continuum equations of a viscous thin film. Using realistic parameter values, we show that defect kinetics can meaningfully alter theoretical predictions of surface relaxation and ion-enhanced fluidity. Implications for aligning theoretical and experimental work, especially for surface nano-patterning of silicon induced by low-energy argon irradiation, are discussed.

Title: Spectral properties of a Non-Hermitian extension of the diluted Wishart ensemble
Authors: Isaac Pérez Castillo, Edgar Guzmán-González
Abstract: We develop a theoretical framework based on the cavity and replica methods to analyze the spectral properties of sparse asymmetric correlation matrices of the form $\boldsymbol{F} = (\boldsymbol{X}\boldsymbol{Y}^\top + \omega \boldsymbol{Y}\boldsymbol{X}^\top)/2T$, where $\boldsymbol{X}$ and $\boldsymbol{Y}$ are adjacency matrices of weighted Erdős--Rényi random graphs. We examine how the spectral density evolves as the asymmetry parameter $\omega$ varies from $0 < \omega < 1$ (nearly symmetric matrices) to $-1 < \omega \le 0$ (nearly antisymmetric matrices). Analytical predictions are validated through exact numerical diagonalization, showing excellent agreement with theoretical results in the thermodynamic limit.

Title: Electron-hole liquid in biological tissues under ultra high dose rate ionizing radiation
Authors: Diana Shvydka, Victor Karpov
Abstract: We develop a quantitative model of ionization processes in biological tissues under Ultra High Dose Rate (UHDR) radiation. The underlying conjecture is that of electron-hole liquid (EHL) forming in water based substances of biological tissues. Unlike the earlier known EHL in semiconductor crystals, the charge carriers here are low mobile due to strong interactions with the background (solvated electrons, etc.); hence, EHL resembling ionic melts. Similar to all ionic systems, the Coulomb coupling makes that EHL energetically favorable that leads to recombination barriers suppressing subsequent structural transformations. In particular, generation of secondary reactive species in such EHL becomes limited translating into reduction of biological damages and tissue sparing effect. We show how these processes are sensitive to the tissue quality and frequency dispersion of the dielectric permittivity. Equations for dose and dose rate defining the sparing thresholds are derived.

Title: Emerging Ferroelectric Domains: Stacking and Rotational Landscape of MoS2 Moire Bilayers
Authors: Anikeya Aditya, Ayu Irie, Nabankur Dasgupta, Rajiv K. Kalia, Aiichiro Nakano, Priya Vashishta
Abstract: The structures and properties of moire patterns in twisted bilayers of two-dimensional (2D) materials are known to depend sensitively on twist angle, yet their dependence on stacking order remains comparatively underexplored. In this study, we use molecular dynamics simulations to systematically investigate the combined effects of stacking order and rotation in MoS2 bilayers. Beginning from five well-established high-symmetry bilayer stackings, we apply twist angles between 1 and 120 to the top layer, revealing a variety of relaxed moire structures. Our results show that the initial stacking significantly influences the moire domain configurations that emerge at a given twist angle. While all five stacking orders are metastable without twist, they form two moire-equivalent classes- AA/AB and AA',A'B,AB', i.e., for a given twist angle, structures within each class relax to the same moire configuration. Specifically, initial AA and AB stackings give rise to triangular ferroelectric domains near 0+/-3, while AA', A'B, and AB' stackings produce triangular ferroelectric domains near 60+/-3. At precisely 60 and 120 twists, the bilayers relax to into pure high-symmetry stackings, highlighting the rotational relationships between these configurations and explaining the shift of 60 in the ferroelectric rotational range. These findings demonstrate the critical role of stacking order in governing the rich moire landscapes accessible in twistronic systems.

Title: Quantifying Charge Noise Sources in Quantum Dot Spin Qubits via Impedance Spectroscopy, DLTS, and C-V Analysis
Authors: Tyafur Rahman Pathan, Daryoosh Vashaee
Abstract: The coherence and fidelity of quantum dot (QD) spin qubits are fundamentally limited by charge noise arising from electrically active trap states at oxide interfaces, heterostructure boundaries, and within the bulk semiconductor. These traps introduce electrostatic fluctuations that couple to the qubit via spin-orbit interactions or charge-sensitive confinement potentials, leading to dephasing and gate errors. In this work, we present a general trap characterization framework for identifying and quantifying the spectral signatures of these trap states using AC impedance spectroscopy, deep-level transient spectroscopy (DLTS), and conventional capacitance-voltage (C-V) analysis. While our case study focuses on strained Ge/SiGe quantum well heterostructures, the approach is broadly applicable to other material systems and qubit types. We demonstrate that each class of traps (oxide interface, quantum well interface, and bulk) exhibits distinct fingerprints across frequency- and time-domain measurements. Oxide traps dominate the low-frequency conductance peaks and appear strongly in Nyquist and transient spectra. QW interface traps, despite being nearly invisible at low densities in conventional C-V and AC impedance analysis, are clearly resolved through multi-exponential decay signatures in time-domain response. Bulk traps contribute to high-frequency admittance and steady-state leakage currents. By correlating each trap type to its characteristic time constant, spatial location, and spectral impact, we provide a diagnostic toolset for disentangling noise sources that degrade qubit performance. This unified methodology bridges traditional defect metrology with emerging qubit noise analysis and enables material- and process-level strategies for coherence optimization in scalable quantum devices.

Zumbühl, Long Ju
Abstract: Spin-polarized superconductors offer a rare platform for studying electronic correlations, but few candidate systems have been experimentally confirmed to date. Here, we report the observation of a spin-polarized superconducting state, denoted SC5, in WSe2-proximitized rhombohedral trilayer graphene. At in-plane magnetic field B|| = 0 T, SC5 has a critical temperature of 68 mK and an out-of-plane critical magnetic field of only 12 mT. Surprisingly, these values are significantly enhanced as B|| increases, and the superconductivity persists to B|| = 8.8 T. This value corresponds to a record-high Pauli-limit violation ratio of at least 80 among all superconductors, while the true critical field is beyond the limit of our instrument. We conclude that SC5 experiences a canting crossover from Ising-type to spin-polarized superconductor with increased B||.

Title: Spatial Correlation of Superconducting and Pseudogap Dynamics in a Bi-based Cuprate
Authors: T. Shimizu, T. Kurosawa, S. Tsuchiya, K. Yamane, R. Morita, M. Oda, Y. Toda
Abstract: Understanding the interplay between superconductivity and the pseudogap phase is essential for elucidating the mechanism of high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates. Here we provide direct spatial evidence that these two states are locally and intrinsically correlated. Using spatially and temporally resolved measurements of photoinduced quasiparticle dynamics in optimally doped Bi$_2$Sr$_{1.7}$La$_{0.3}$CuO$_{6+\delta}$ (La-Bi2201), we reveal micrometer-scale spatial contrasts in the transient reflectivity that arise from local variations in the threshold fluence required to disrupt either the superconducting or pseudogap state. The superconducting response remains spatially uniform, whereas the pseudogap exhibits intrinsic inhomogeneity, yet the spatial variations of their threshold fluences closely track each other, establishing a robust local correlation between the two. These results introduce a bulk-sensitive ultrafast optical methodology for visualizing hidden spatial correlations in correlated materials and provide new benchmarks for understanding the intertwined phases in cuprates.

Title: Two-dimensional flat-bands in Moire-diamonds
Authors: Yalan Wei, Shifang Li, Yuke Song, Chaoyu He
Abstract: The discovery of flat-bands in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene has underscored the potential of moire engineering for correlated states, but such phases are notoriously difficult to realize and highly fragile against perturbations. Here, we propose an alternative route to flat-bands by introducing sp3 hybridization in twisted graphite. Instead of relying on fine-tuned magic angles, our approach identifies flat-band states at relatively large twist angles with short moire periods. In this regime, sp3-induced reconstructions generate electronic states that, once formed, are locked by substantial energy barriers, rendering them robust against external perturbations. Using twisted graphite as a prototype, we uncover a series moire-diamond that host two-dimensional flat conduction of valence bands, where carriers are localized within specific momentum planes but remain dispersive along orthogonal directions. The emergence of dimensional flat-bands opens a new platform for flat-band-driven correlated physics and suggests opportunities for designing quantum materials with highly directional electronic functionalities.

Title: Delayed 1T to 2H Phase Transition Upon Electrochemical Delithiation of LiMoS2
Authors: Yerin Hong, Juhwan Lim, Jinhong Min, Nishkarsh Agarwal, Robert Hovden, Ageeth A. Bol, Yiyang Li
Abstract: Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is a widely studied layered material for electronic, optical, and catalytic applications. It can host lithium ions between the van der Waals layers, which triggers a phase transition between the semiconducting 2H phase and metallic 1T phase. While lithium insertion triggers a phase transition to the 1T phase, the phase behavior upon electrochemical lithium removal is not resolved. In this work, we conduct single-flake electrochemical (de)lithiation of MoS2 using microelectrode arrays. Through both electrochemical voltage analysis and correlative Raman spectroscopy, we show that an electrochemically cycled and delithiated MoS2 flake initially remains in the 1T phase. However, over the course of several days, it transitions back into the thermodynamically stable 2H phase. This result resolves the phase transformation pathway upon delithiation and showcases the ability to electrochemically synthesize the metastable 1T-MoS2 phase.

Title: Generalized quantum limits of electrical contact resistance and thermal boundary resistance
Authors: Alice Ho, Jashan Singhal, Deji Akinwande, Huili Grace Xing, Debdeep Jena
Abstract: The importance of electrical contact resistance and thermal boundary resistance has increased dramatically as devices are scaled to atomic limits. The use of a rich range of materials with various bandstructures (e.g. parabolic, conical), and in geometries exploiting various dimensionalities (e.g. 1D wires, 2D sheets, and 3D bulk) will increase in the future. Here we derive a single general expression for the quantum limit of electrical contact resistivity for various bandstructures and all dimensions. A corresponding result for the quantum limit of thermal boundary resistance is also derived. These results will be useful to quantitatively co-design, benchmark, and guide the lowering of electrical and thermal boundary resistances for energy efficient devices.

Title: Impact of elastic inhomogeneity on collective dynamical properties investigated by field theoretical description in real space
Authors: Cunyuan Jiang
Abstract: Interpreting the vibrational properties of amorphous solids beyond Debye's theory is challenging due to the presence of inhomogeneity on the mesoscopic scale. In this work, we model this inhomogeneity by real-space fluctuating elasticity with a spatially correlated distribution and calculate the dynamical properties using an exact real-space field theoretical approach. Our results clarify that the excess low-frequency density of states (DOS) originates from a selective scattering effect (stronger scattering of short wavelengths) induced by elastic inhomogeneity. The visualization of the local DOS in real space reveals the existence of anomalous modes, highly excited spots, at low frequencies. The findings regarding these highly excited spots and the selectivity of the correlation length were missed in previous perturbative field approaches in wave-vector space, and they align with recent progress from particle-level simulations and experiments. These results provide concrete insights into the low-frequency vibrational anomaly of amorphous solids from the perspective of simple elastic inhomogeneity.

Title: Phase-sensitive evidence for 2x2 pair density wave in a kagome superconductor

Abstract: The pair-density-wave (PDW) exhibits periodic amplitude and sign modulations of the superconducting order parameter. Such a pairing state has been proposed to be sensitive to nonmagnetic scattering. In this work, we observe the nonmagnetic PDW-breaking effect in a kagome superconductor, using scanning tunneling microscopy. We observe 2x2 PDW induced by the coupling between charge order and superconductivity. The global PDW is substantially suppressed upon doping the kagome lattice with dilute isovalent nonmagnetic impurities, whereas the charge order and uniform superconductivity remain robust. Spatial correlation analysis further confirms that PDW is distinctly suppressed near dopants. We attribute the PDW suppression to a nonmagnetic PDW breaking effect, arising from phase sign modulation of PDW in the kagome d-orbital hosting Bogoliubov Fermi states.

Title: Collinear, incommensurate antiferromagnetism in van der Waals magnet alpha-UTe3
Authors: H. Sakai, C. Tabata, K. Kaneko, Y. Tokiwa, T. Kitazawa, S. Kambe, Y. Tokunaga, Y. Haga
Abstract: alpha-UTe3, a van der Waals (vdW) actinide compound with a monoclinic ZrSe3-type structure, is a narrow-gap semiconductor with 5f moments. 125Te NMR reveals strongly anisotropic, layer-confined spin fluctuations below about 20 K, with the a-axis component enhanced, and a signal wipeout at the antiferromagnetic (AFM) transition at TN = 5 K. Single-crystal neutron diffraction finds q approx. (0.17, 0.5, 0) and a longitudinal sinusoidal modulation of a-axis moments (amplitude about 0.8 muB) with AFM stacking along b. A CEF singlet-singlet induced-moment framework accounts for the easy-axis anisotropy, the small heat-capacity anomaly at TN, the reduced ordered moment, and the exchange-driven selection of q in this localized 5f vdW magnet, establishing a constrained exchange geometry stabilizing this in-plane incommensurate state.

Title: Frenkel anomaly on co-ordination numbers in liquid CO2 at 100 and 1000 bar studied by Monte Carlo simulation using Kihara potential model
Authors: Koji Kobashi
Abstract: An issue concerning the Frenkel line of liquid CO2 is that its location has not been unequivocally determined. So far, reliable Frenkel lines were identified from velocity autocorrelation functions (VAFs) computed by Molecular Dynamic simulations; however VAFs cannot be directly verified experimentally. By contrast, the co-ordination numbers (CNs) can be measured experimentally by X-ray and neutron scattering or computed by Monte Carlo (MC) simulation, and thus provide an alternative means of determining the location of the Frenkel line. In the present study, the CNs were computed by MC simulation using the Kihara potential, and the Frenkel anomalies were identified at {P = 100 bar, T = 260 K}, in good agreement with previous results based on VAFs, and at {P = 1000 bar, T = 370 K}, which deviates significantly from them.

Title: Entropy Engineering-Regulated Electron-Phonon Coupling for Highly Efficient Photoluminescence in Se-doped WS2
Authors: Chi Zhang, Quan Shen, Mengmeng Zhang, Zhiming Deng, Taishen Wu, Xuying Zhong, Gang Ouyang, Dongsheng Tang, Qi Zheng, Jiansheng Dong, Weichang Zhou
Abstract: The limited quantum yield of strained monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides grown by vapor-phase methods and during transfer-based stacking poses a fundamental challenge for their optoelectronic applications. Here, we introduce the concept of "entropy engineering" as a transformative strategy to selectively enhance light-matter interactions through controlled electron-phonon coupling. We unveil how tailored entropy introduced via precise selenium doping or interfacial van der Waals proximity can significantly amplify radiative recombination from momentum-dark excitons in WS2 monolayers. Notably, we discover that slight selenium doping drastically enhances the photoluminescence (PL) of WS2 under strain. While both undoped and heavily doped WS2 suffer from strong PL quenching owing to the direct-to-indirect bandgap transition, lightly Se-doped samples exhibit an order-of-magnitude increase in emission intensity. This counterintuitive boost is traced to doping-induced structural disorder, which intensifies electron-phonon interactions and unlocks efficient phonon-assisted emission from otherwise non-radiative indirect excitons. Moreover, we demonstrate that van der Waals coupling to adjacent Se-doped layers can impart interfacial entropy and further augment PL via proximity effects. Our work highlights entropy engineering via controlled doping as a powerful strategy for activating high-efficiency light emission in atomically thin semiconductors.

Title: Local-Antisymmetric Flat Band and Coexisting Correlated stripe charge orders in WSe2-Modulated Twisted Bilayer Graphene
Authors: Chi Zhang, Shihao Zhang, Mengmeng Zhang, Lin He, Qi Zheng
Abstract: Insulating, atomically flat transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) like WSe2 are ideal substrates for probing intrinsic graphene properties. Conventionally, their influence on graphene's band structure is assumed negligible, particularly when small moire patterns form. Combining scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy and theoretical analysis, we reveal that the atomic registry in graphene/WSe2 heterostructures profoundly modulates the electronic structure of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG). At special graphene/WSe2 twist angles, an incommensurate moire superlattice hosts three distinct atomic stacking configurations (A, B, X types). These induce position-dependent potentials that asymmetrically shift MATBG's flat bands, transforming them from hole-side to electron-side asymmetric within a single AA-stacked region. This symmetry breaking enables the unprecedented coexistence of orthogonal stripe charge orders in the correlated regime-a phenomenon previously considered mutually exclusive due to Coulomb repulsion. This band modulation arises from the synergistic effects of the graphene/WSe2 interfacial atomic registry and heterostrain within the MATBG, exhibiting multi-field tunability. Our work establishes interfacial atomic registry as a critical, previously overlooked tuning parameter for flat-band physics, opening avenues to engineer correlated quantum states in van der Waals heterostructures.

Abstract: Relaxor ferroelectric thin films are recognized for their ultrahigh power density, rendering them highly promising for energy storage applications in electrical and electronic systems. However, achieving high energy storage performance with chemically homogeneous, environmentally friendly and compositionally stable materials remains challenging. In this work, we present a design of dielectrics with high energy storage performance via an in-plane polar domains incorporating polar nanoregions mechanism. Guided by phase-field simulations, we synthesized La/Si co-doping BaTiO3 solid-solution thin films with high chemical homogeneity to realize high energy storage performance. Given that, we achieve a high energy density of 203.7J/cm3 and an energy efficiency of approximately 80% at an electric field of 6.15MV/cm. This mechanism holds significant promise for the design of next-generation high-performance dielectric materials for energy storage and other advanced functional materials.

Title: Thin-film flows of granular suspensions on a solid surface
Authors: Alice Pelosse, Elisabeth Guazzelli, Matthieu Roché
Abstract: This review article examines the complex dynamics of thin-film flows of granular suspensions spreading over rigid solid substrates with free air interfaces. Such systems feature an involved coupling of the free-surface dynamics with the flow and microstructure of the suspension. In particular, we develop two canonical thin-film situations: drop spreading and dip-coating. In drop spreading, confinement of the particulate phase near the advancing contact line alters both the spreading rate and the interface shape. In dip-coating, understanding the entrainment of fluid and particles becomes challenging as the film thickness approaches the particle size.

Title: Spinon band flattening by its emergent gauge field in quantum kagome ice
Authors: Masafumi Udagawa, Roderich Moessner
Abstract: Fractional excitations provide a key to identifying sought-after topological quantum spin liquid states in realistic materials. Their single-particle dynamics already presents a challenging many-body problem on account of the coupling to their emergent gauge field. Here, we study the spinon excitations of kagome ice, realized at the $2/3$ magnetization plateau of spin ice, by combining up-to-$63$-site exact diagonalization with an analytical state graph mapping. We find a macroscopically degenerate mode in the spinon spectrum. It originates from the destructive interference due to the interaction with surrounding gauge fields, a form of many-body caging. We explicitly construct, and count, the concomitant many-body wave functions. Finally, we discuss the possible role of these flat modes in the magnetization process of kagome antiferromagnets, in particular with regard to the asymmetric termination of the kagome ice magnetisation plateau.

Title: Should it really be that hard to model the chirality induced spin selectivity effect?
Authors: J. Fransson
Abstract: The chirality induced spin selectivity effect remains a challenge to capture with theoretical modeling. While at least a decade was spent on independent electron models, which completely fail to reproduce the experimental results, the lesson to be drawn out of these efforts is that a correct modeling of the effect has to include interactions among the electrons. In the discussion of the phenomenon ones inevitably encounters the Onsager reciprocity and time-reversal symmetry, and questions whether the observations violate these fundamental concepts, or whether we have not been able to identify what it is that make those concepts redundant in this context. The experimental fact is that electrons spin-polarize by one or another reason, when traversing chiral molecules. The set-ups are simple enough to enable effective modeling, however, overcoming the grand failures of the theoretical efforts, thus far, and formulating a theory which is founded on microscopic modeling appears to be a challenge. A discussion of the importance of electron correlations is outlined, pointing to possible spontaneous breaking of time-reversal symmetry and Onsager reciprocity.

Title: Optimizing Cross-Domain Transfer for Universal Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials
Authors: Jaesun Kim, Jinmu You, Yutack Park, Yunsung Lim, Yujin Kang, Jisu Kim, Haekwan Jeon, Deokgi Hong, Seung Yul Lee, Saerom Choi, Yongdeok Kim, Jae W. Lee, Seungwu Han
Abstract: Accurate yet transferable machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are essential for accelerating materials and chemical discovery. However, most universal MLIPs overfit to narrow datasets or computational protocols, limiting their reliability across chemical and functional domains. We introduce a transferable multi-domain training strategy that jointly optimizes universal and task-specific parameters through selective regularization, coupled with a domain-bridging set (DBS) that aligns potential-energy surfaces across datasets. Systematic ablation experiments show that small DBS fractions (0.1%) and targeted regularization synergistically enhance out-of-distribution generalization while preserving in-domain fidelity. Trained on fifteen open databases spanning molecules, crystals, and surfaces, our model, SevenNet-Omni, achieves state-of-the-art cross-domain accuracy, including adsorption-energy errors below 0.06 eV on metallic surfaces and 0.1 eV on metal-organic frameworks. Despite containing only 0.5% r$^2$SCAN data, SevenNet-Omni reproduces high-fidelity r$^2$SCAN energetics, demonstrating effective cross-functional transfer from large PBE datasets. This framework offers a scalable route toward universal, transferable MLIPs that bridge quantum-mechanical fidelities and chemical domains.

Title: Spreading fronts: numerical simulations on discrete models and continuous equations
Authors: J. M. Marcos
Abstract: Out-of-equilibrium systems, inherently complex and challenging to understand, are prevalent across various disciplines, including physics where they arise in contexts such as fluid dynamics. In particular, critical out-of-equilibrium systems combine this complexity with the scaling laws and universality classes observed in critical phenomena, with kinetic surface roughening, the study of how a flat surface becomes progressively rougher over time, serving as a prime example. This behavior manifests in a wide variety of contexts, including metal corrosion, cell proliferation, and, notably, the growth of thin films, which can emerge as a result of wetting processes. In this thesis, we conduct extensive numerical simulations to study critical fluctuations and identify universal features of several rough interfaces, generated by simulating discrete models of thin film growth and by performing direct numerical integration of continuum equations. To explore the universal behavior of these interfaces, we identify the critical exponents that characterize the spatio-temporal fluctuations of the front. Additionally, we analyze the dynamics of thin films across different physical scenarios to deepen our understanding of their behavior in out-of-equilibrium conditions, especially in the case where these films are formed by the action of an external force such as Surface Acoustic Waves.

Title: Superconducting spin valve effect in Fe/Si$_3$N$_4$/Pb/Si$_3$N$_4$/Fe heterostructures
Authors: A. A. Kamashev, N. N. Garif'yanov, A. A. Validov, A. S. Osin, Ya. V. Fominov, I. A. Garifullin
Abstract: The structures of the superconducting spin valve (SSV) Fe/\allowbreak Si$_3$N$_4$/\allowbreak Pb/\allowbreak Si$_3$N$_4$/\allowbreak Fe (where Si$_3$N$_4$ is a dielectric insulating layer of controlled thickness) were investigated. The dependence of the magnitude of the SSV effect on the thicknesses of the superconducting (S) and insulating (I) layers was studied. Optimization of the S and I layer thicknesses enabled a complete switching between the normal and superconducting states when the mutual orientation of the magnetizations of the ferromagnetic (F) layers changed from antiparallel to parallel. A maximal SSV effect value of 0.36\,K was achieved in an external magnetic field of 1\,kOe. These results demonstrate that SSV structures with tunable S/F interface transparency controlled by insulating interlayers are promising for achieving a significant magnitude of the effect. This opens new avenues for the development of such systems and their potential applications in spintronic devices.

Title: Behavior of passive polymeric tracers of different topologies in a dilute bath of active Brownian particles
Authors: Ramanand Singh Yadav, Ralf Metzler, Rajarshi Chakrabarti
Abstract: Using computer simulations in two dimensions we investigate the dynamics and structure of passive polymeric tracer with different topologies immersed in a low-density active particle bath. One of the key observations is that polymer exhibit faster dynamics compared to passive colloidal particles at high activity, for the same particle density, in both linear and star polymer topologies. This enhanced motion is attributed to the accumulation of active particles, which induces prolonged and persistent movement of the polymer. Further analysis reveals that star polymers exhibit more complex and intriguing behavior than their linear counterparts. Notably, the accumulation of active particles promotes the pairing of arms in star polymers. For instance, a three-armed star polymer adopts a conformation similar to a linear polymer with two-arms due to this pairing as a result, at high activity, the dynamics of both the polymers converge. Finally, we explore the dynamics of a linear polymer with the same total number of beads as the star polymer. Interestingly, at high activity -- where arm pairing in the star polymer is significant -- the star polymer demonstrates faster dynamics than the linear polymer, despite having the identical number of beads. These findings contribute to a broader understanding of the interactions between active and passive components of varying topologies in dilute systems and highlight their potential for innovative applications ranging from materials science to biomedicine.

Authors: Max Tymczyszyn, Edward McCann
Abstract: We present example four-band Hermitian tight-binding Bogoliubov-de-Gennes (BdG) Hamiltonians and Kramer's degenerate Hamiltonians in one dimension. Starting from a generalized Rice-Mele model, we incorporate superconducting terms to obtain a four-band BdG Hamiltonian with intrinsic charge-conjugation symmetry, and constrain it using symmorphic or nonsymmorphic time-reversal symmetries. In position space we find that each form of time-reversal symmetry, when applied to random BdG matrices, results in a unique block diagonalization of the Hamiltonian when translational symmetry is also enforced. We provide representative models in all relevant symmorphic symmetry classes, including the non-superconducting CII class. For nonsymmorphic time-reversal symmetry, we identify a $\mathbb{Z}_4$ topological index with two phases supporting Majorana zero modes and two without, and study disorder effects in the presence of topological solitons. We further generalize a winding-number method, previously applied only to $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariants without Kramer's degeneracy, to compute indices for both the $\mathbb{Z}_4$ model and a non-superconducting AII model with nonsymmorphic chiral symmetry and Kramer's degeneracy. We propose topolectric circuit implementations of the charge-density-wave and $\mathbb{Z}_4$ models which agree with the topological calculations. Finally, we show that, in one dimension, nonsymmorphic unitary symmetries do not produce new topological classifications beyond $\mathbb{Z}$ or $\mathbb{Z}_2$ indices.

Title: Electron-phonon coupling in magnetic materials using the local spin density approximation
Authors: Á. A. Carrasco Álvarez, M. Giantomassi, J. Lihm, G. E. Allemand, M. Mignolet, M. Verstraete, S. Poncé
Abstract: Magnetic materials are crucial for manipulating electron spin and magnetic fields, enabling applications in data storage, spintronics, charge transport, and energy conversion, while also providing insight into fundamental quantum phenomena. In numerous applications, the interaction between electrons and lattice vibrations, known as electron-phonon coupling, can be of significant importance. In that regard, we extend the EPW package to be able to interpolate the electron-phonon matrix elements combining perturbation theory and maximally localized Wannier functions. This allows to use dense momentum grids at a reasonable computational cost when computing electron-phonon-related quantities and physical properties. We validate our implementation considering ferromagnetic iron and nickel, where we explore the absence of phonon-driven superconductivity, finding that superconductivity is intrinsically suppressed. Furthermore, we evaluate the carrier resistivity at finite temperatures for both systems, considering the role of the magnetic phase in carrier transport. Our findings indicate that in the case of Fe, the primary contributor to resistivity is electron-phonon scattering. In contrast, for Ni, electron-phonon scattering constitutes less than one-third of the resistivity, underscoring a fundamental difference in the transport properties of the two systems.

Title: Nonequilibrium spin-splitter effect in altermagnet superconductor hybrids
Authors: Tim Kokkeler, Tero T. Heikkilä, F. Sebastian Bergeret
Abstract: We study the nonequilibrium spin-splitter effect in superconducting altermagnets and superconductor altermagnet hybrids by computing the alternating spin current and edge the spin density in the presence of an alternating electric field. We show that while in the normal state the effect is not sensitive to the field frequency, in the superconducting state, there is a strong effect for frequencies on the scale of $\Delta_0$ or lower. We contrast the effect to the spin accumulation induced by the spin-Hall effect, by showing that for the altermagnet spin-splitter effect the out-of-phase spin density does not diverge in the adiabatic limit. This difference is attributed to the absence of any equilibrium spin-splitter effect in altermagnets. In fact, the out-of-phase component vanishes below the gap excitation frequency $2\Delta_0$, because below this frequency the absence of dissipation and the behavior of the system under time-reversal directly determine the relative phase between the charge current, spin current, and spin accumulation. The nonequilibrium effect can be tuned by external parameters like temperature. In fact, it has a nonmonotonic temperature dependence, taking its largest value for temperatures around $0.8T_{c}$. The value at this temperature can be significantly larger than the normal state spin density or the low temperature spin density. Thus, besides using the nonequilibrium spin-splitter effect to identify altermagnets, its tunability makes it also suitable for applications.

Title: Deterministic Switching in Altermagnets via Asymmetric Sublattice Spin Current
Authors: Sayan Sarkar, Sunit Das, Amit Agarwal
Abstract: We demonstrate a deterministic switching mechanism in collinear altermagnets driven by asymmetric sublattice spin currents. Unlike conventional antiferromagnets, where combined parity-time-reversal symmetry enforces purely staggered sublattice spin torques, altermagnets host symmetry-protected nonrelativistic spin splitting that produces unequal torques on the two sublattices. Using doped FeSb$_2$ as a representative $d$-wave altermagnet, our Landau--Lifshitz--Gilbert simulations show that these torques enable magnetic-field-free and deterministic 180$^\circ$ Néel vector reversal over picosecond timescale. The mechanism is generic to even-parity altermagnets and remains effective even in centrosymmetric, weak spin-orbit coupled systems, where the Néel spin-orbit torque mechanism fails. Our results establish an experimentally accessible mechanism for switching of altermagnetic order, opening pathways for realizing ultrafast, low-power altermagnet spintronic devices.

Title: Host-atom-driven transformation of a honeycomb oxide into a dodecagonal quasicrystal
Authors: Martin Haller, Julia Hewelt, V. Y. M. Rajesh Chirala, Loi Vinh Tran, Ankur Bhide, Muriel Wegner, Stefan Förster, Wolf Widdra
Abstract: Dodecagonal oxide quasicrystals (OQCs) have so far been limited to a few elemental systems, with no general formation mechanism established. Here, we demonstrate a versatile approach to OQC formation via a host-atom-induced transformation of a metal-oxide honeycomb (HC) network. Adsorption of Ba, Sr, or Eu onto the HC layer triggers its reorganization into a dodecagonal tiling, as revealed by low-energy electron diffraction and scanning tunneling microscopy. Full conversion occurs when 73% of the honeycomb rings are occupied. Kelvin probe and UV photoelectron spectroscopy show a linear decrease in work function with increasing host coverage, followed by a sharp increase upon quasicrystal formation due to reduced host dipoles. This transformation mechanism enables the fabrication of structurally precise OQCs, including a new Eu-Ti-O phase that extends the field to lanthanide quasicrystals, forming a 2D grid of localized magnetic moments. The method offers a general route to explore lattice-matched substrates for epitaxial growth and may be adapted to other 2D honeycomb materials - such as graphene, hexagonal ice, and silica - paving the way for engineered aperiodic systems beyond transition metal oxides.

Title: A minimal and universal representation of fermionic wavefunctions (fermions = bosons + one)
Authors: Liang Fu
Abstract: Representing fermionic wavefunctions efficiently is a central problem in quantum physics, chemistry and materials science. In this work, we introduce a universal and exact representation of continuous antisymmetric functions by lifting them to continuous symmetric functions defined on an enlarged space. Building on this lifting, we obtain a \emph{parity-graded representation} of fermionic wavefunctions, expressed in terms of symmetric feature variables that encode particle configuration and antisymmetric feature variables that encode exchange statistics. This representation is both exact and minimal: the number of required features scales as $D\sim N^d$ ($d$ is spatial dimension) or $D\sim N$ depending on the symmetric feature maps employed. Our results provide a rigorous mathematical foundation for efficient representations of fermionic wavefunctions and enable scalable and systematically improvable neural network solvers for many-electron systems.

Title: Intermediate chiral edge states in quantum Hall Josephson junctions
Authors: Partha Sarathi Banerjee, Rahul Marathe, Sankalpa Ghosh
Abstract: A transfer-matrix-based theoretical framework is developed to study transport in superconductor-quantum Hall-Superconductor (SQHS) Josephson junctions modulated by local potential barriers in the quantum-Hall regime. The method allows one to evaluate the change in the conductivity of such SQHS Josephson junctions contributed by the intermediate chiral edge states (ICES) induced by these local potential barriers at their electrostatic boundaries at specific electron filling-fractions. It is particularly demonstrated how these ICES created at different Landau levels (LL) overlap with each other through intra- and inter-LL ICES mixing with the change in strength and width of the potential barriers. This results in different mechanisms for forming Landau bands when an array of such potential barriers are present. It is also demonstrated that our theoretical framework can be extended to study the lattice effect in a bounded domain in such SQHS Josephson junctions by simultaneously submitting the normal region to a transverse magnetic field and periodic potential.

Title: Nonanaliticities and ergodicity breaking in noninteracting many-body dynamics via stochastic resetting and global measurements
Authors: David Soldner, Igor Lesanovsky, Gabriele Perfetto
Abstract: Stochastic resetting generates nonequilibrium steady states by interspersing unitary quantum dynamics with resets at random times. When the state to which the system is reset is chosen conditionally on the outcome of a global and spatially resolved measurement, the steady state can feature collective behavior similar to what is typically observed at phase transitions. Here we investigate such conditional reset protocol in a system of noninteracting spins, where the reset state is chosen as a magnetization eigenstate, that is selected (conditioned) on the outcome of a previous magnetization measurement. The stationary states that emerge from this protocol are characterized by the density of spins in a given magnetization eigenstate, which is the analogue of the order parameter. The resulting stationary phase diagram features multiple nonanalytic points. They are of first-order type for half-integer spin, while multicritical behavior, signalled by both first and second-order discontinuities, is found for integer spin. We also show that the associated dynamics is nonergodic, i.e., which stationary state the system ultimately assumes is determined be the initial state. Interestingly, the mechanism underlying these phenomena does not rely on interactions, but the emergent nonlinear behavior is solely a consequence of correlations induced by the measurement.

Title: Efficient and accurate tensor network algorithm for Anderson impurity problems
Authors: Zhijie Sun, Zhenyu Li, Chu Guo
Abstract: The Anderson impurity model (AIM) is of fundamental importance in condensed matter physics to study strongly correlated effects. However, accurately solving its long-time dynamics still remains a great numerical challenge. An emergent and rapidly developing numerical strategy to solve the AIM is to represent the Feynman-Vernon influence functional (IF), which encodes all the bath effects on the impurity dynamics, as a matrix product state (MPS) in the temporal domain. The computational cost of this strategy is basically determined by the bond dimension $\chi$ of the temporal MPS. In this work, we propose an efficient and accurate method which, when the hybridization function in the IF can be approximated as the summation of $n$ exponential functions, can systematically build the IF as a MPS by multiplying $O(n)$ small MPSs, each with bond dimension $2$. Our method gives a worst case scaling of $\chi$ as $2^{8n}$ and $2^{2n}$ for real- and imaginary-time evolution respectively. We demonstrate the performance of our method for two commonly used bath spectral functions, where we show that the actually required $\chi$s are much smaller than the worst case.

Abstract: We illustrate ion-beam engineering of MoO3 Ag Au multilayer plasmonic substrates to improve SERS performance, We illustrate ion-beam engineering of MoO3-Ag-Au multilayer plasmonic substrates to improve SERS performance. Orthorhombic {\alpha}-MoO3 microflakes were produced via chemical vapour deposition (CVD) on Si-SiO2 substrates. Thin films of Ag (5 nm) and Au (5 nm) were thermally evaporated onto the MoO3 flakes, and the samples were subjected to 100 MeV Ag8+ swift heavy ion irradiation at fluences of 3e11 and 3e12 ions cm-2. Irradiation causes dewetting of metal films, prompting structural and morphological changes that result in the formation of dispersed Ag-Au nanoparticles, enhanced surface roughness, and defect generation within the MoO3 lattice. X-ray diffraction (XRD) verifies the {\alpha}-MoO3 phase; field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) elucidates nanoparticle formation and surface reorganisation; Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) disclose vibrational alterations and binding-energy shifts in Mo 3d, indicative of oxygen vacancies (V_O) and partial reduction of Mo. SERS measurements of molecular probes demonstrate significantly increased Raman intensities following ion irradiation.

Title: Effects of strain on the stability of the metallic rutile and insulating M1 phases of vanadium dioxide
Authors: Peter Mlkvik, Lena Geistlich, Nicola A. Spaldin, Claude Ederer
Abstract: We present a systematic density-functional theory study of the effects of strain on the structural and electronic properties in vanadium dioxide (VO$_2$), with particular emphasis on its effect on the relative stability of the metallic rutile and the insulating monoclinic M1 phases. We consider various strain conditions that can be related to epitaxial strain present in VO$_2$ films grown on different lattice planes. Our calculations confirm the dominant role of $c$ axis strain, i.e., along the direction of the V-V dimerization in the M1 phase. Our analysis suggests that this effect stems primarily from the weakening of the lattice stiffness, with the hopping along the $c$ axis playing a minor role. We also confirm that, in strain scenarios that deform the basal plane, the $c$ axis strain still has a dominant effect on the phase stability.

Title: Spinons, solitons and random singlets in the spin-chain compound copper benzoate
Authors: Ying Chen, Guijing Duan, Yuejiu Zhao, Ning Xi, Bingying Pan, Xiaoyu Xu, Zhanlong Wu, Kefan Du, Shuo Li, Ze Hu, Rui Bian, Xiaoqun Wang, Wei Li, Long Zhang, Yi Cui, Shiyan Li, Rong Yu, Weiqiang Yu
Abstract: The $S=1/2$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain is a paradigmatic quantum system hosting exotic excitations such as spinons and solitons, and forming random singlet state in the presence of quenched disorder. Realizing and distinguishing these excitations in a single material remains a significant challenge. Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) on a high-quality single crystal of copper benzoate, we identify and characterize all three excitation types by tuning the magnetic field at ultra-low temperatures. At a low field of 0.2 T, a temperature-independent spin-lattice relaxation rate ($1/T_1$) over more than a decade confirms the presence of spinons. Below 0.4 K, an additional relaxation channel emerges, characterized by $1/T_1 \propto T$ and a spectral weight growing as $-\ln(T/T_0)$, signaling a random-singlet ground state induced by weak quenched disorder. At fields above 0.5 T, a field-induced spin gap $\Delta \propto H^{2/3}$ observed in both $1/T_1$ and the Knight shift signifies soliton excitations. Our results establish copper benzoate as a unique experimental platform for studying one-dimensional quantum integrability and the interplay of disorder and correlations.

Title: Disorder to Order Transition in 1D Nonreciprocal Cahn-Hilliard Model
Authors: Navdeep Rana, Ramin Golestanian
Abstract: We extensively study the phenomenology of one dimensional Nonreciprocal Cahn Hilliard model for varying nonreciprocity $(\alpha)$ and different boundary conditions. At small $\alpha$, a perturbed uniform state evolves to a defect laden configuration that lacks global polar order. Defects are the sources and sinks of travelling waves and nonreciprocity selects defects with a unique wave number that increases monotonically with $\alpha_c$. A critical threshold $\alpha_c$ marks the onset of a transition to states with finite global polar order. For periodic boundaries, above $\alpha_c$, the system shows travelling waves that are completely ordered. In contrast, travelling waves are incompatible with Dirichlet and Neumann boundaries. Instead, for $\alpha \gtrsim \alpha_c$, we find fluctuating domains that show intermittent polar order and at large $\alpha$, the system partitions into two domains with opposite polar order.

Title: Ab-initio calculation of magnetic exchange interactions using the spin-spiral method in VASP: Self-consistent versus magnetic force theorem approaches
Authors: Umit Dogan Daglum, Maria Stamenova, Ersoy Sasioglu, Stefano Sanvito
Abstract: We present an ab initio investigation of magnetic exchange interactions using the spin-spiral method implemented in the VASP code, with a comparative analysis of the self-consistent (SC) and magnetic force theorem (MFT) approaches. Using representative 3d ferromagnets (Fe, Co, Ni) and Mn-based full Heusler compounds, we compute magnon dispersion relations directly from spin-spiral total energies and extract real-space Heisenberg exchange parameters via Fourier transformation. Curie temperatures are subsequently estimated within both the mean-field and random-phase approximations. The SC spin-spiral calculations yield exchange parameters and magnon spectra in excellent agreement with previous theoretical data, confirming their quantitative reliability across different classes of magnetic systems. In contrast, the MFT approach exhibits systematic quantitative deviations: it overestimates spin-spiral energies and exchange couplings in high-moment systems such as bcc Fe and the Mn-based Heuslers, while underestimating them in low-moment fcc Ni. The magnitude of these discrepancies increases strongly with magnetic moment size, exceeding several hundred percent in the high-moment compounds. These findings underscore the decisive role of self-consistency in accurately determining magnetic exchange parameters and provide practical guidance for future first-principles studies of spin interactions and excitations using the spin-spiral technique.

Title: Flux confinement-deconfinement transition of dimer-loop models on three-dimensional bipartite lattices
Authors: Souvik Kundu, Kedar Damle
Abstract: Motivated by recent work that mapped the low-temperature properties of a class of frustrated spin $S=1$ kagome antiferromagnets with competing exchange and single-ion anisotropies to the fully-packed limit (with each vertex touched by exactly one dimer or nontrivial loop) of a system of dimers and nontrivial (length $s > 2$) loops on the honeycomb lattice, we study this fully-packed dimer-loop model on the three-dimensional bipartite cubic and diamond lattices as a function of $w$, the relative fugacity of dimers. We find that the $w \rightarrow 0$ O($1$) loop-model limit is separated from the $w \rightarrow \infty$ dimer limit by a geometric phase transition at a nonzero finite critical fugacity $w_c$: The $w>w_c$ phase has short loops with an exponentially decaying loop-size distribution, while the $w<w_c$ phase is dominated by large loops whose loop-size distribution is governed by universal properties of the critical O($1$) loop soup. This transition separates two {\em distinct} Coulomb liquid phases of the system: Both phases admit a description in terms of a fluctuating divergence-free polarization field $P_{\mu}(\mathbf{r})$ on links of the lattice and are characterized by dipolar correlations at long distances. The transition at $w_c$ is a flux confinement-deconfinement transition. Equivalently, and independent of boundary conditions, half-integer test charges $q=\pm 1/2$ are confined for $w>w_c$, but become deconfined in the small-$w$ phase. Although both phases are unstable to a nonzero fugacity for the charge $\pm 1/2$ excitations, the destruction of the $w >w_c$ Coulomb liquid is characterized by an interesting slow crossover, since test charges with $q=\pm 1/2$ are confined in this phase.

Title: Deterministic hBN bubbles as a versatile platform for studies on single-photon emitters
Authors: Piotr Tatarczak, Tomasz Fąs, Jan Pawłowski, Aleksandra Krystyna Dąbrowska, Jan Suffczyński, Piotr Wróbel, Andrzej Wysmołek, Johannes Binder
Abstract: Single-photon emitters (SPEs) in two-dimensional materials are highly promising candidates for quantum technologies. SPEs in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have been widely investigated, but mostly in exfoliated or powder samples that require an activation process, making it difficult to compare studies and reproduce results. Here, we address this problem and propose a platform based on large-area metaloraganic vapour phase epitaxy (MOVPE)-grown hBN, which combines reproducibility and scalability with the ability to readily host SPEs without activation. Through the creation of bubbles via electron-beam irradiation, we achieve additional functionalities, including an interference-mediated enhancement of emission by approximately 100-200\%, dedicated structures that allow the relocation of individual emitters across different systems, and the opportunity to investigate strain-induced effects. Moreover, in contrast to other gas-filled bubbles that deflate at low temperatures, our bubbles remain stable under cryogenic conditions, allowing studies as a function of temperature. To improve the control over the shape and position of bubbles, we demonstrate a~mask-based method that enables deterministic control over bubble formation. The presented hBN bubbles constitute a versatile platform for reproducible studies of hBN-based emitters, providing a reliable insight into their nature and properties.

Title: Strain-induced multiferroicity in Cr1/3NbS2
Authors: Y. Sun, Y. Ahn, D. Sapkota, H. S. Arachchige, R. Xue, S. Mozaffari, D. G. Mandrus, L. Zhao, J. Orenstein, V. Sunko
Abstract: Multiferroic materials, in which electric polarization and magnetic order coexist and couple, offer rich opportunities for both fundamental discovery and technology. However, multiferroicity remains rare due to conflicting electronic requirements for ferroelectricity and magnetism. One route to circumvent this challenge is to exploit the noncollinear ordering of spin cycloids, whose symmetry permits the emergence of polar order. In this work, we introduce another pathway to multiferroic order in which strain generates polarization in materials that host nonpolar spin spirals. To demonstrate this phenomenon, we chose the spin spiral in the well-studied helimagnet Cr1/3NbS2. To detect the induced polarization, we introduce the technique of magnetoelectric birefringence (MEB), an optical probe that enables spatially-resolved and unambiguous detection of polar order. By combining MEB imaging with strain engineering, we confirm the onset of a polar vector at the magnetic transition, establishing strained Cr1/3NbS2 as a type-II multiferroic.

Title: Finite-temperature phase diagram and collective modes of coherently coupled Bose mixtures
Authors: Sunilkumar V, Rajat, Sandeep Gautam, Arko Roy
Abstract: We investigate the ferromagnetic-paramagnetic phase transition in coherently (Rabi) coupled Bose-Einstein condensates at zero and finite temperatures, exploring different routes to the transition by tuning the Rabi coupling or increasing the temperature at a fixed coupling. Using the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov theory within the Popov approximation, we map out the finite-temperature phase diagram of a three-dimensional homogeneous condensate and identify the critical line through the softening of the spin gap. Magnetization and the spin dispersion branch reveal the progressive suppression of the ferromagnetic order with increasing temperature. In quasi-one-dimensional harmonic traps, the transition, driven by Rabi coupling, is inferred through the softening of the spin breathing mode with its minimum shifting to lower coupling values with increasing temperature. Notably, the thermally driven transition causes monotonic hardening of all the spin modes. For both coupling and temperature-driven transition, the hybridized density modes in the ferromagnetic phase acquire more density character while approaching the critical point.

Title: Spinon Mediation of Witness-Spin Dynamics and Ground State in Herbertsmithite

Abstract: The kagome lattice of spin-1/2 Cu atoms in herbertsmithite (ZnCu3(OH)6Cl2) may sustain a quantum spin liquid (QSL) state with spinon quasiparticles. Each kagome plane is separated from its homologues by a layer of spinless Zn atoms. Providentially, however, some spin-1/2 Cu atoms substitute randomly onto these inter-kagome Zn sites. We reconceptualize these 'impurity' atoms as quantum 'witness-spins', an exceptional new interrogative of the conjectured Z2-gauge-symmetric QSL state. Thus we introduce spin-noise spectroscopy to explore herbertsmithite witness-spin dynamics for QSL studies. It reveals the existence, slowing and intensification of spin noise, prefatory to a sharp transition at T* {\approx} 260 mK. Below T* the spin-noise power spectral density S_M({\omega},T) {\propto} {\omega}^{-{\alpha}(T)} stabilizes at {\alpha} {\approx} 1; the spin noise variance {\sigma}_M^2(T) diminishes precipitously; the ultra-low-field magnetic susceptibility {\chi}(T) undergoes a sharp transition into a phase exhibiting an Edwards-Anderson order-parameter and ultra-slow spin-state relaxation. A Z2 QSL theory of spinon-mediated witness-spin interactions corresponds best to all these experimental observations, predicting slowing and intensification of witness-spin fluctuations and noise spectrum S_M({\omega},T) with cooling, with a transition into a unique spinon-mediated phase signified by rapidly diminishing spin noise, with S_M({\omega},T) {\propto} {\omega}^{-1}, a sharp cusp in the DC magnetic susceptibility {\chi}(T), and the appearance of an Edwards-Anderson order-parameter. We rule out numerous other mechanisms for these effects, so that only spinon-mediation by either a Z2 or U(1) QSL is consistent with all present herbertsmithite empirics, with the former model providing a closer match to data.

Title: Chirality reversal at finite magnetic impurity strength and local signatures of a topological phase transition
Authors: Ruiqi Xu, Arnab Seth, Itamar Kimchi
Abstract: We study the honeycomb lattice with a single magnetic impurity modeled by adding imaginary next-nearest-neighbor hopping ih on a single hexagon. This Haldane defect gives a topological mass term to the gapless Dirac cones and generates chirality. For a small density of defects Neehus et al [arXiv:2405.19289] found that the system's chirality reverses at a critical hc ~ 0.95 associated with an unexpected tri-critical point of Dirac fermions at zero defect density. We investigate this zero-density limit by analyzing a single defect and computing two experimentally relevant measures of chirality: (1) orbital magnetization via local Chern marker, a bulk probe of all occupied states; and (2) electronic currents of low-energy states. Both probes show a chirality reversal at a critical hc ~ 0.9--1. Motivated by this consistency we propose a defect-scale toy model whose low energy states reverse their chirality at hc' ~ 0.87. Remarkably, the same pair of zero energy bound states also generate the critical point hc in the full impurity projected T-matrix. Our results show how the chirality reversal produced by an impurity can be observed either in local probes or in the global topology and suggest a possible role of the microscopic defect structure at the critical point.

Title: Comparing Symmetrized Determinant Neural Quantum States for the Hubbard Model
Authors: Louis Sharma, Ahmedeo Shokry, Rajah Nutakki, Olivier Simard, Michel Ferrero, Filippo Vicentini
Abstract: Accurate simulations of the Hubbard model are crucial to understanding strongly correlated phenomena, where small energy differences between competing orders demand high numerical precision. In this work, Neural Quantum States are used to probe the strongly coupled and underdoped regime of the square-lattice Hubbard model. We systematically compare the Hidden Fermion Determinant State and the Jastrow-Backflow ansatz, parametrized by a Vision Transformer, finding that in practice, their accuracy is similar. We also test different symmetrization strategies, finding that output averaging yields the lowest energies, though it becomes costly for larger system sizes. On cylindrical systems, we consistently observe filled stripes. On the torus, our calculations display features consistent with a doped Mott insulator, including antiferromagnetic correlations and suppressed density fluctuations. Our results demonstrate both the promise and current challenges of neural quantum states for correlated fermions.

Wells (1), Rodrigo Ledesma-Aguilar (1) ((1) Institute for Multiscale Thermofluids, School of Engineering, The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK, (2) Department of Materials, Loughborough University, Loughborough, UK)
Abstract: Kinetic frictional forces resisting droplet motion often appear to be separate to surface wettability and adhesive forces. Here we show that such friction arises from a simple combination of the contact angle hysteresis and adhesive force. We show theoretically, and confirm using tilt angle experiments of droplets on liquid-like surfaces, the dependence of the coefficient of droplet-on-solid kinetic friction on system parameters. We also show that a molecular kinetic-type model can describe the observed non-linear velocity-force relationship. Our findings provide a fundamental understanding of the relationship between droplet-on-solid friction, and wettability and liquid adhesion.

Title: Assessment of different loss functions for fitting equivalent circuit models to electrochemical impedance spectroscopy data

Abstract: Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data is typically modeled using an equivalent circuit model (ECM), with parameters obtained by minimizing a loss function via nonlinear least squares fitting. This paper introduces two new loss functions, log-B and log-BW, derived from the Bode representation of EIS. Using a large dataset of generated EIS data, the performance of proposed loss functions was evaluated alongside existing ones in terms of R2 scores, chi-squared, computational efficiency, and the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) between the predicted component values and the original values. Statistical comparisons revealed that the choice of loss function impacts convergence, computational efficiency, quality of fit, and MAPE. Our analysis showed that X2 loss function (squared sum of residuals with proportional weighting) achieved the highest performance across multiple quality of fit metrics, making it the preferred choice when the quality of fit is the primary goal. On the other hand, log-B offered a slightly lower quality of fit while being approximately 1.4 times faster and producing lower MAPE for most circuit components, making log-B as a strong alternative. This is a critical factor for large-scale least squares fitting in data-driven applications, such as training machine learning models on extensive datasets or iterations.

Title: A physics-aware deep learning model for shear band formation around collapsing pores in shocked reactive materials
Authors: Xinlun Cheng, Bingzhe Chen, Joseph Choi, Yen T. Nguyen, Pradeep Seshadri, Mayank Verma, H. S. Udaykumar, Stephen Baek
Abstract: Modeling shock-to-detonation phenomena in energetic materials (EMs) requires capturing complex physical processes such as strong shocks, rapid changes in microstructural morphology, and nonlinear dynamics of chemical reaction fronts. These processes participate in energy localization at hotspots, which initiate chemical energy release leading to detonation. This study addresses the formation of hotspots in crystalline EMs subjected to weak-to-moderate shock loading, which, despite its critical relevance to the safe storage and handling of EMs, remains underexplored compared to the well-studied strong shock conditions. To overcome the computational challenges associated with direct numerical simulations, we advance the Physics-Aware Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network (PARCv2), which has been shown to be capable of predicting strong shock responses in EMs. We improved the architecture of PARCv2 to rapidly predict shear localizations and plastic heating, which play important roles in the weak-to-moderate shock regime. PARCv2 is benchmarked against two widely used physics-informed models, namely, Fourier neural operator and neural ordinary differential equation; we demonstrate its superior performance in capturing the spatiotemporal dynamics of shear band formation. While all models exhibit certain failure modes, our findings underscore the importance of domain-specific considerations in developing robust AI-accelerated simulation tools for reactive materials.

Title: Vari-Cool: a non-unitary quantum variational protocol for simulated cooling
Authors: Jeffrey Z. Song, Gilad Kishony, Erez Berg, Mark S. Rudner
Abstract: We introduce a variational approach for preparing low energy states of arbitrary target Hamiltonians. The protocol is defined in terms of a repeated cycle consisting of p layers of unitary gates applied to the system and ancilla "bath" qubits, followed by reset of the bath qubits. The gate parameters within each cycle are optimized such that the steady state achieved after many cycles has a low energy expectation value with respect to the target Hamiltonian, and that the energy converges toward the steady state value in as few cycles as possible. We illustrate the protocol for the transverse field Ising model, and study its systematic behaviors with respect to system size, model parameters, and noise using tensor network based classical simulations. We then experimentally demonstrate its operation on IBM's ibm_kingston quantum processor for up to 28 system qubits coupled to 14 bath sites. Classical training on small system sizes and with few unitary layers per cycle gives robust results that transfer well to larger system sizes and to noisy hardware.

Title: Combined Representation and Generation with Diffusive State Predictive Information Bottleneck
Authors: Richard John, Yunrui Qiu, Lukas Herron, Pratyush Tiwary
Abstract: Generative modeling becomes increasingly data-intensive in high-dimensional spaces. In molecular science, where data collection is expensive and important events are rare, compression to lower-dimensional manifolds is especially important for various downstream tasks, including generation. We combine a time-lagged information bottleneck designed to characterize molecular important representations and a diffusion model in one joint training objective. The resulting protocol, which we term Diffusive State Predictive Information Bottleneck (D-SPIB), enables the balancing of representation learning and generation aims in one flexible architecture. Additionally, the model is capable of combining temperature information from different molecular simulation trajectories to learn a coherent and useful internal representation of thermodynamics. We benchmark D-SPIB on multiple molecular tasks and showcase its potential for exploring physical conditions outside the training set.

Title: Real-time dynamics with bead-Fourier path integrals. II. Bead-Fourier RPMD
Authors: Nathan London, Mohammad R. Momeni
Abstract: Feynman path integrals (PIs) have found many uses in approximate quantum dynamics methods that are able to efficiently calculate real-time quantum correlation functions. The PIs typically take the form of discrete imaginary time slices over a closed path, where the slices form the ``beads'' of a ring polymer (RP) necklace. Some methods, such as centroid molecular dynamics (CMD), use the RP to generate an effective potential for the dynamics, while others, like RP molecular dynamics (RPMD), directly utilize the RP in real-time dynamics in order to incorporate quantum effects. The standard, discretized bead forms of CMD and RPMD can require a large number of RP beads to provide accurate results for systems where quantum effects are strong, such as at low temperatures. In Paper I, we introduced the bead-Fourier (BF) CMD method, where we utilized the inclusion of a Fourier sine series to reduce the number of beads needed to converge the CMD effective potential up to eightfold. In this work, we extend RPMD to incorporate BF-PIs in the form of BF-RPMD. We study a number of different implementations of the method through the calculation of correlation functions for both linear and non-linear operators. The effectiveness of the BF-RPMD method is sensitive to both the system and form of the operators being studied, but we show that this method is able to produce results on par with standard RPMD, with at worst twofold and up to eightfold reduction in the number of beads by including two to three Fourier components.

Title: Random State Approach to Quantum Computation of Electronic-Structure Properties
Authors: Yiran Bai, Feng Xiong, Xueheng Kuang
Abstract: Classical computation of electronic properties in large-scale materials remains challenging. Quantum computation has the potential to offer advantages in memory footprint and computational scaling. However, general and practical quantum algorithms for simulating large-scale materials are still lacking. We propose and implement random-state quantum algorithms to calculate electronic-structure properties of real materials. Using a random state circuit with only a few qubits, we employ real-time evolution with first-order Trotter decomposition and Hadamard test to obtain electronic density of states, and we develop a modified quantum phase estimation algorithm to calculate real-space local density of states via direct quantum measurements. Furthermore, we validate these algorithms by numerically computing the density of states and spatial distributions of electronic states in graphene, twisted bilayer graphene quasicrystals, and fractal lattices, covering system sizes from hundreds to thousands of atoms. Our results manifest that the random-state quantum algorithms provide a general and qubit-efficient route to simulating electronic properties of large-scale periodic and aperiodic materials on quantum computers.

Title: The effect of magnetic fields on vertex reconstructed muon-spin spectroscopy
Authors: Pascal Isenring, Zaher Salman
Abstract: The use of a Si pixel-based particle tracking scheme in muSR will, among others, allow measurements using a ten-fold increased stopped muons rate and samples ten times smaller than currently possible. Here we present simulation results to assess the effects of magnetic fields on two spectrometer configurations using a two-layered tracking scheme for the incoming and outgoing particles. At a low magnetic field of up to ~50 mT, the tracking and reconstruction accuracy is only minimally influenced. Beyond a magnetic field of ~80 mT the tracking capabilities diminish significantly. Operating a two-layered scheme using small magnetic fields hence does not require adaptations. Only at large magnetic fields, a tracking scheme that makes use of an accurate field map or the use of at least three layers must be employed to achieve reliable particle tracking.

Title: Material combination optimization for brazed ceramic-metal composites using Artificial Intelligence
Authors: Sunita Khod, Vinay Kamma, Ravi Kumar Verma, Mayank Goswami
Abstract: This study proposes an Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven methodology for predicting a combination of brazed ceramic-metal composite materials. Multiple machine learning (ML) algorithms are compared with the deep learning (DL) model. The developed models are tested using k-fold validation. Nine different input-output feature configurations are evaluated to assess the model performance. The input-output feature comprises material properties, namely, the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) and molecular mass of brazed ceramic-metal composite materials obtained from literature and the strength parameter (average Von Mises Stress (VMS)) estimated from Finite Element Method (FEM) simulation for joint assembly structure. A multi-output model, Autoencoder (AE), has also been developed and tested to predict various features. The ML model, namely the polynomial regression (PR), outperforms the other ML/DL models with a Mean square Error (MSE) of 0.01 for the test data. The autoencoder model with a 32-16-32 structure outperforms LR, PR, RF, and ANN with an MSE of 0.04% for the prediction of unseen data. The developed multi-output model accurately predicts all the features (single and multiple), while PR fails to accurately predict multi-output features of low importance. The developed AE model predicts the different material properties with an average error of ~0.16-3.78% with literature-reported values.

Title: Harvesting chemical power from cyclic environments
Authors: Pranay Jaiswal, Ivar S. Haugerud, Hidde D. Vuijk, Christoph A. Weber
Abstract: Life relies on a sophisticated metabolic molecular machinery that turns over high-energy molecules to evolve complex macromolecules and assemblies. At the molecular origin of life, such machinery was absent, implying the need for simple yet robust physical mechanisms to harvest energy from the environment and perform chemical work or produce chemical power. However, the mechanisms involved in harvesting energy from a macroscopic cyclic environment to drive chemical processes on the molecular scale remain elusive. In this work, we propose a theory that describes the kinetics of chemical reactions in a system subject to a cyclic reservoir with varying properties. We compare cycles of solvent (wet-dry cycles), with cycles of a component participating in a chemical reaction (reactant cycle). We find that for both wet-dry and reactant cycles, resonance frequencies exist at which the chemical power is maximal. We identify which cycle type is more beneficial in harvesting chemical power for different molecular interactions. Our findings of harvest efficiencies around ten percent suggest that the cyclic environment could have played a key role in catalyzing the metabolic molecular machinery at the molecular origin of life.

Title: Depth One Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz as an Approximate Gibbs Distribution Sampler
Authors: Elijah Pelofske
Abstract: This study numerically investigates the thermal sampling properties of QAOA, the Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz which was generalized from the original Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm. Specifically, the ability of QAOA to sample from the Gibbs distribution, equivalently the Boltzmann distribution, defined by a classical Ising model, specifically a fully connected disordered spin glass (Sherrington-Kirkpatrick) model. We focus on two different QAOA mixers; the standard transverse field X mixer, and the Grover mixer. At a QAOA depth of one we examine, for a single full QAOA parameter search space period, the energy landscape, the Shannon entropy landscape of the QAOA probability distribution, and the tradeoff between Boltzmann distribution sampling temperature and error rate (how close to the true Boltzmann distribution is the QAOA distribution). We find that at very high temperatures one-round Grover mixer QAOA can sample from the Boltzmann distribution more accurately than the standard X mixer QAOA at one round. Both X mixer and Grover mixer depth one QAOA can serve as approximate Boltzmann distribution samplers, and how good this approximation is depends heavily on the QAOA angle choice.

Title: Spontaneous Coulomb fissions of drops on lubricated surfaces
Authors: Marcus Lin, Peng Zhang, Aaron D. Ratschow, Oscar Li, Sankara Arunachalam, Dan Daniel
Abstract: Charged water drops are more widespread than commonly acknowledged. For example, raindrops typically carry charges of order Q ~ 1 pC, while routine pipetting in the laboratory produces drops with Q ~ 50 pC. Here, we show that such modest charging can spontaneously generate periodic Coulomb fissions for evaporating water drops on lubricated surfaces, with more than 60 successive cycles observed over 30 min. Interestingly, the underlying instability can be quantitatively predicted by two fissility thresholds: one marking the onset of drop elongation and another triggering fission. Each fission culminates with a fine liquid jet that disintegrates into 40-50 microdroplets, expelled within microseconds. The phenomenon spans an extraordinary range of length scales (from millimetres to microns) and time scales (hour to microseconds), with broad potential applications ranging from nanoscale fabrication to electrospray ionization.

Title: The significance of two-way coupling in two-dimensional, dusty turbulence
Authors: Harshit Joshi, Samriddhi Sankar Ray
Abstract: The significance of small-scale forcing of particles on the carrier two-dimensional turbulent flow has been shown [Pandey, Perlekar, and Mitra, Phys. Rev. E, 100, 013114 (2019)] to influence the spectral scaling properties of the carrier fluid. We investigate possible consequences of such two-way coupling in a turbulent suspension of inertial particles in one and two-point Eulerian and Lagrangian statistics. In particular, we find signatures of a possibly enhanced intermittency in the vorticity distributions. We characterize the changes in the (small-scale) geometry of the flow via the Okubo-Weiss parameter. Finally, we examine the scaling properties of the second-order (vorticity) structure functions and find a non-trivial form of scale-invariance at finite mass-loading. This suggests that a dual-scale forcing mechanism on the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equation may be an effective model to mimic the role of particle feedback in turbulence.

Title: Uniformity Bias in Ground-State Sampling Induced by Replica Alignment in Quantum Monte Carlo for Quantum Annealing
Authors: Naoki Maruyama, Masayuki Ohzeki, Kazuyuki Tanaka
Abstract: Quantum annealing (QA) with a transverse field often fails to sample degenerate ground states fairly, limiting applicability to problems requiring diverse optimal solutions. Although Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) is widely used to simulate QA, its ability to reproduce such unfair ground-state sampling remains unclear because stochastic and coherent quantum dynamics differ fundamentally. We quantitatively evaluate how accurately QMC reproduces the sampling bias in QA by comparing the final ground-state distributions from the QMC master equation and the Schrödinger equation. We find QMC tends to produce uniform ground-state probabilities, unlike QA's biased distribution, and that this uniformity bias strengthens as annealing proceeds. Our analysis reveals that this bias originates from replica alignment -- the dominance of configurations in which all Trotter replicas coincide -- caused by the energetic suppression and entropic reduction of kink configurations (replica mismatches). These findings clarify a fundamental limitation of discrete-time QMC in faithfully simulating QA dynamics, highlighting the importance of replica correlations and transition rules in achieving realistic ground-state sampling.

Title: Quantum-Squeezing-Induced Algebraic Non-Hermitian Skin Effects and Ultra Spectral Sensitivity
Authors: Zhao-Fan Cai, Tao Liu
Abstract: The well-established non-Bloch band theory predicts exponential localization of skin-mode eigenstates in one-dimensional (1D) non-Hermitian systems. Recent studies, however, have uncovered anomalous algebraic localization in higher dimensions. Here, we extend these ideas to Hermitian bosonic quadratic Hamiltonians incorporating quantum squeezing, offering a genuine quantum framework to explore non-Hermitian phenomena without external reservoirs. We construct a two-dimensional (2D) bosonic lattice model with two-mode squeezing and study its spectral properties of bosonic excitation within the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) formalism. We demonstrate an algebraic non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), characterized by quasi-long-range power-law localization of complex eigenstates. The system shows ultra spectral sensitivity to double infinitesimal on-site and long-range hopping impurities, while remaining insensitive to single impurities. Analytical treatment via the Green's function reveals that this sensitivity originates from the divergence of the nonlocal Green's function associated with the formation of nonlocal bound states between impurities. Our study establishes a framework for realizing novel higher-dimensional non-Hermitian physics in Hermitian bosonic platforms such as superconducting circuits, photonic lattices, and optomechanical arrays, with the demonstrated ultraspectral sensitivity enabling quantum sensing and amplification via bosonic squeezing.

Authors: Hussein Nassar
Abstract: Holding a shell in their hands, one can apply six loads: three by pulling and shearing, and three by bending and twisting. Here, it is shown that the shell will resist exactly three load cases and comply with the other three, provided the shell is simply connected, meaning it has no holes and no handles.

Title: High-Dimensional Learning Dynamics of Quantized Models with Straight-Through Estimator
Authors: Yuma Ichikawa, Shuhei Kashiwamura, Ayaka Sakata
Abstract: Quantized neural network training optimizes a discrete, non-differentiable objective. The straight-through estimator (STE) enables backpropagation through surrogate gradients and is widely used. While previous studies have primarily focused on the properties of surrogate gradients and their convergence, the influence of quantization hyperparameters, such as bit width and quantization range, on learning dynamics remains largely unexplored. We theoretically show that in the high-dimensional limit, STE dynamics converge to a deterministic ordinary differential equation. This reveals that STE training exhibits a plateau followed by a sharp drop in generalization error, with plateau length depending on the quantization range. A fixed-point analysis quantifies the asymptotic deviation from the unquantized linear model. We also extend analytical techniques for stochastic gradient descent to nonlinear transformations of weights and inputs.

Title: On the discovery of meteoritic mineral Zolenskyite; The artificial origin should not be overlooked
Authors: Boutros Pierre Embaid
Abstract: Recently a new meteoritic mineral, Zolenskyite (Fe0.99Mn0.04Ca0.01Cr1.99S3.98), was discovered from the Indarch meteorite. Zolenskyite was structurally indexed as the monoclinic C2/m CrNb2Se4 - Cr3S4 type structure of synthetic FeCr2S4, with unit cell parameters a = 12.84(1) Å, b = 3.44(1) Å, c = 5.94(1) Å and \b{eta} = 117(1)°. Zolenskyite was reported as high-pressure phase formed from Daubréelite at high pressures and temperatures in highly shocked regions of the EH parent asteroid. Although this discovery provides valuable information about the origin of meteoritic mineral assemblages, the results and conclusions raise controversies with those reported in previous articles where the synthetic FeCr2S4 was described. In this review, an alternative analysis of the supplementary X-ray data from Zolenskyite was made and yields to the monoclinic I2/m Cr3S4 type structure of synthetic FeCr2S4, with unit cell parameters a = 5.940 Å, b = 3.440 Å, c = 11.441 Å and \b{eta} = 90.55°, in agreement with previous results in the literature and differ from those reported above. Regarding the genesis of Zolenskyite and according to solid-state laboratory synthesis, the transformation of cubic FeCr2S4 phase (ideal composition of Daubréelite) to monoclinic FeCr2S4 (ideal composition of Zolenskyite) requires a process whose replication in Shock metamorphism stages is not well established and remains an open issue to address, together with another open issue related to the real composition of meteoritic minerals, with minor and trace metals, which is often overlooked when compared with synthetic ideal compositions. Whatever the results to be obtained by addressing the above open issues, they will shed more light on the genesis of Zolenskyite. In this context, it is worth to promote an open debate about the hypothesis of artificial origin.

Title: Hydrodynamics of degenerate Fermi gases on spherical Fermi surfaces
Authors: Benjamin Anwasia, Diogo Arsénio
Abstract: We consider the description of a Fermi gas of free electrons given by the Boltzmann--Fermi--Dirac equation, and aim at providing a precise mathematical understanding of the Fermi ground state and its first-order approximation of excited states on the Fermi sphere. In order to achieve that, using the framework of hydrodynamic limits in collisional kinetic theory, we identify the low-temperature regimes in which charge-density fluctuations concentrate on the Fermi sphere. In three spatial dimensions or higher, we also characterize the thermodynamic equilibra and energy spectra of fluctuations. This allows us to derive the macroscopic hydrodynamic equations describing how charge densities flow and propagate in metals, thereby providing a precise description of plasma oscillations in conductors. The two-dimensional case is fundamentally different and is handled in a companion article. Remarkably, our results establish that excited electrons and their energy can be distributed on the Fermi sphere anisotropically, which deviates from the common intuitive assumption that electrons and their energy should be distributed uniformly in all directions. The hydrodynamic regimes featured in this work are akin to the acoustic limit of the classical Boltzmann equation. However, we emphasize that our derivation holds for arbitrarily fast rates of convergence of the Knudsen number, which significantly extends the applicability of the known proofs of the classical acoustic limit. This suggest that low-temperature limits of Fermi gases provide a promising avenue of research toward a complete understanding of the compressible Euler limit.

Title: Loss investigations of high frequency lithium niobate Lamb wave resonators at ultralow temperatures
Authors: Wenbing Jiang, Xuankai Xu, Jiazhen Pan, Hancong Sun, Yu Guo, Huabing Wang, Libing Zhou, Tao Wu
Abstract: Lamb wave resonators (LWRs) operating at ultralow temperatures serve as promising acoustic platforms for implementing microwave-optical transduction and radio frequency (RF) front-ends in aerospace communications because of the exceptional electromechanical coupling (k^2) and frequency scalability. However, the properties of LWRs at cryogenic temperatures have not been well understood yet. Herein, we experimentally investigate the temperature dependence of the quality factor and resonant frequency in higher order antisymmetric LWRs down to millikelvin temperatures. The high-frequency A1 and A3 mode resonators with spurious-free responses are comprehensively designed, fabricated, and characterized. The quality factors of A1 modes gradually increase upon cryogenic cooling and shows 4 times higher than the room temperature value, while A3 mode resonators exhibit a non-monotonic temperature dependence. Our findings provide new insights into loss mechanisms of cryogenic LWRs, paving the way to strong-coupling quantum acoustodynamics and next-generation satellite wireless communications.

Title: Tunable multi-photon correlations from a coherently driven quantum dot
Authors: Thomas K. Bracht, Rachel N. Clark, Petros Androvitsaneas, Matthew Jordan, Samuel G. Bishop, Harry E. Dyte, Moritz Cygorek, Ian A. Farrer, Doris E. Reiter, Anthony J. Bennett
Abstract: Mixing the fields generated by different light sources has emerged as a powerful approach for engineering non-Gaussian quantum states. Understanding and controlling the resulting photon statistics is useful for emerging quantum technologies that are underpinned by interference. In this work, we investigate intensity correlation functions arising from the interference of resonance fluorescence from a quantum emitter with a coherent laser field. We show that the observed bunching behavior results from a subtle interplay between quantum interference and the normalization of the correlation functions. We show that by adjusting the mixing ratio and phase one can achieve full tunability of the second-order correlation, ranging from anti-bunching to bunching. We further extend our analysis to third-order correlation functions, both experimentally and theoretically, to provide new insights into the interpretation of higher-order correlations and offer practical tools for shaping quantum optical fields.

Title: A Large-Language-Model Assisted Automated Scale Bar Detection and Extraction Framework for Scanning Electron Microscopic Images
Authors: Yuxuan Chen, Ruotong Yang, Zhengyang Zhang, Mehreen Ahmed, Yanming Wang
Abstract: Microscopic characterizations, such as Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), are widely used in scientific research for visualizing and analyzing microstructures. Determining the scale bars is an important first step of accurate SEM analysis; however, currently, it mainly relies on manual operations, which is both time-consuming and prone to errors. To address this issue, we propose a multi-modal and automated scale bar detection and extraction framework that provides concurrent object detection, text detection and text recognition with a Large Language Model (LLM) agent. The proposed framework operates in four phases; i) Automatic Dataset Generation (Auto-DG) model to synthesize a diverse dataset of SEM images ensuring robust training and high generalizability of the model, ii) scale bar object detection, iii) information extraction using a hybrid Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system with DenseNet and Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) based algorithms, iv) an LLM agent to analyze and verify accuracy of the results. The proposed model demonstrates a strong performance in object detection and accurate localization with a precision of 100%, recall of 95.8%, and a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 99.2% at IoU=0.5 and 69.1% at IoU=0.5:0.95. The hybrid OCR system achieved 89% precision, 65% recall, and a 75% F1 score on the Auto-DG dataset, significantly outperforming several mainstream standalone engines, highlighting its reliability for scientific image analysis. The LLM is introduced as a reasoning engine as well as an intelligent assistant that suggests follow-up steps and verifies the results. This automated method powered by an LLM agent significantly enhances the efficiency and accuracy of scale bar detection and extraction in SEM images, providing a valuable tool for microscopic analysis and advancing the field of scientific imaging.

Title: Bright Single-Photon Emission from Individual Tin-Vacancy Centers in Multi-Cone Diamond Waveguides
Authors: Pablo Tieben, Jan Rhensius, Takuya F. Segawa, Risei Abe, Konosuke Shimazaki, Shigeki Takeuchi, Andeas W. Schell, Hideaki Takashima
Abstract: Diamonds containing color centers have recently gathered significant attention for photonic quantum technologies, including quantum sensing, photonic quantum computers, and quantum networks. Among the various color centers, tin-vacancy (SnV) centers are particularly promising due to the high emission efficiency from the zero-phonon line and due to their long spin coherence times. However, the extraction of photons from diamond remains a key challenge. Here we demonstrate high photon extraction from a single SnV center incorporated in a diamond nanopillar with tapered sidewalls and a multi-cone structure. A sharp emission peak with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of $6\,$nm was observed at a wavelength of $619\,$nm. Furthermore, the second-order correlation function exhibited an antibunching dip well below $g^{(2)}(0) = 0.5$, indicating single-photon emission. Remarkably, the emitter achieved a high saturation count rate of approximately $9\,$Mcps. These results establish our nanopillar platform as a promising candidate for bright and stable quantum sources and sensors based on SnV centers in diamond.

Title: Unlocking High-Throughput Heterojunction Discovery
Authors: Thomas W. Gries, Davide Regaldo, Yanyan Duan, Florian Scheler, Maxim Simmonds, Valerio Stacchini, Annamaria Petrozza, Eva Unger, Antonio Abate, Jean-Paul Kleider, Artem Musiienko
Abstract: Photoluminescence (PL) is a ubiquitous proxy for material quality in optoelectronic devices, widely used for high-throughput materials discovery. However, we demonstrate that in the presence of charge-selective contacts, PL loses its predictive reliability and can exhibit strong quenching even in highly efficient photovoltaic devices under open-circuit conditions. By combining steady-state and transient PL with contactless transient surface photovoltage measurements we disentangle the intertwined processes of extraction and recombination, clarifying the physical origin of this phenomenon. This joint approach reveals extraction dynamics not captured by PL alone. A digital replica of the interface shows that Coulomb attraction and interfacial recombination are the fundamental mechanisms driving quenching after charge extraction. Based on these insights, we present a decision tree for heterojunction classification and PL interpretation applicable across diverse optoelectronic systems, including photovoltaics, photodetectors, and LEDs. Our approach supports systematic screening and optimization of half-devices, bridging the gap between accelerated materials discovery and accelerated device discovery.

Title: Optimal parallelisation strategies for flat histogram Monte Carlo sampling
Authors: Hubert J. Naguszewski, Christopher D. Woodgate, David Quigley
Abstract: Flat histogram methods, such as Wang-Landau sampling, provide a means for high throughput calculation of phase diagrams of atomistic/lattice model systems. Many parallelisation schemes with varying degrees of complexity have been proposed to accelerate such sampling simulations. In this study, several widely used schemes are benchmarked - both in isolation and in combination - to establish best practice. The schemes studied include energy domain decomposition with both static sizing of energy sub-domains, as well as a dynamic sub-domain sizing scheme which we propose. We also assess the benefits both of replica exchange and of including multiple random walkers per sub-domain, to determine which factors have the largest impact on parallel efficiency. Additionally, the influence of the choice of size of energy sub-domain overlap regions is discussed. As an illustrative test case, we implement and apply the aforementioned strategies to a lattice-based model describing the internal energies of the AlTiCrMo refractory high-entropy superalloy, which is understood to crystallographically order into a B2 (CsCl) structure with decreasing temperature. We find that - while all of the proposed strategies confer a non-negligible speedup - parallelisation across energy domains which are non-uniform in size offers the most appreciable performance improvements. This work offers concrete recommendations for which parallelisation strategies should be prioritised to optimally accelerate flat-histogram Monte Carlo simulations.

Title: Quantum Synchronization of Perturbed Oscillating Coherences
Authors: Yi J. Zhao, Joel E. Moore, Juzar Thingna, Christopher W. Wächtler
Abstract: Synchronization in quantum systems has been recently studied through persistent oscillations of local observables, which stem from undamped modes of the dissipative dynamics. However, the existence of such modes requires fine-tuning the system to satisfy specific symmetry constraints. We investigate the response of spin systems that possess such oscillating modes to generic, weak perturbations. We show that even when these perturbations break the symmetry and lead to a single steady state, the phase correlations in the resulting state exhibit signatures of synchronization. Our results therefore connect the persistent oscillation notion (dynamical) and the notion based on phase correlations (steady-state) of synchronization, which so far have been regarded as distinct phenomena. Furthermore, we demonstrate that steady-state synchronization in these systems can exhibit features that are absent in the dynamical synchronization. Our work suggests robustness of synchronization and points toward a potential unifying framework of quantum synchronization.

Title: Observation of ballistic plasma and memory in high-energy gauge theory dynamics
Authors: Daniel K. Mark, Federica M. Surace, Thomas Schuster, Adam L. Shaw, Wenjie Gong, Soonwon Choi, Manuel Endres
Abstract: Gauge theories describe the fundamental forces of nature. However, high-energy dynamics, such as the formation of quark-gluon plasmas, is notoriously difficult to model with classical methods. Quantum simulation offers a promising alternative in this regime, yet experiments have mainly probed low energies. Here, we observe the formation of a ballistic plasma and long-time memory effects in high-energy gauge theory dynamics on a high-precision quantum simulator. Both observations are unexpected, as the initial state - fully filled with particle-antiparticle pairs - was thought to rapidly thermalize. Instead, we find correlations spreading ballistically to long distances and a memory of charge clusters. Our observations cannot be explained by many-body scars, but are captured by a new theory of plasma oscillations between electric field and current operators, persisting all the way to the continuum limit of the (1+1)D Schwinger model, of which we simulate a lattice version. Adapting techniques from quantum optics, we visualize plasma oscillations as rotations of Wigner distributions, leading to a novel set of predictions which we test in experiment and numerics. The new framework encompasses both our scenario and scars, which show up as coherent states of the plasma. The experimental surprises we observe in the high-energy dynamics of a simple gauge theory point to the potential of high-precision quantum simulations of gauge theories for general scientific discovery.

Title: The Magic Barrier before Thermalization
Authors: Lukas Ebner, Berndt Müller, Andreas Schäfer, Leonhard Schmotzer, Clemens Seidl, Xiaojun Yao
Abstract: We investigate the time dependence of anti-flatness in the entanglement spectrum, a measure for non-stabilizerness and lower bound for non-local quantum magic, on a subsystem of a linear SU(2) plaquette chain during thermalization. Tracing the time evolution of a large number of initial states, we find that the anti-flatness exhibits a barrier-like maximum during the time period when the entanglement entropy of the subsystem grows rapidly from the initial value to the microcanonical entropy. The location of the peak is strongly correlated with the time when the entanglement exhibits the strongest growth. This behavior is found for generic highly excited initial computational basis states and persists for coupling constants across the ergodic regime, revealing a universal structure of the entanglement spectrum during thermalization. We conclude that quantitative simulations of thermalization for nonabelian gauge theories require quantum computing. We speculate that this property generalizes to other quantum chaotic systems.

Title: Superconductivity in kagome metal YRu3Si2 with strong electron correlations
Authors: Chunsheng Gong, Shangjie Tian, Zhijun Tu, Qiangwei Yin, Yang Fu, Ruitao Luo, Hechang Lei
Abstract: We report the detailed physical properties of YRu3Si2 with the Ru kagome lattice at normal and superconducting states. The results of resistivity and magnetization show that YRu3Si2 is a type-II bulk superconductor with Tc ~ 3.0 K. The specific heat measurement further suggests that this superconductivity could originate from the weak or moderate electron-phonon coupling. On the other hand, both large Kadawaki-Woods ratio and Wilson ratio indicate that there is a strong electron correlation effect in this system, which may have a connection with the featured flat band of kagome lattice.

Title: Comment on paper: Evidence for Dirac flat band superconductivity enabled by quantum geometry, Nature 614, 440 (2023)
Authors: V.R. Shaginyan, A.Z. Msezane, G.S. Japaridze
Abstract: We demonstrate that an absolutely flat band retains the superconducting state at $T_c\to 0$. When $T_c>0$ the flat band disappears, since it must be modified by the superconducting state. Thus, a number of the results on ultra-strong coupling superconductivity in flat band considered in the article ("Evidence for Dirac flat band superconductivity enabled by quantum geometry", Nature 614, 440 (2023)) were predicted and explained many years ago. One has to take into account that at $T_c>0$ the flat band distorts, becoming tilted. As a result, the charge carriers' velocity $v_F\propto T_c$ becomes finite, rather than being extremely slow, as it is stated in the article. Thus, the statement "the charge carriers' group velocity $v_ F$ is extremely slow" is incorrect and leads the authors to the conceptional misunderstanding, confusing the reader.

Title: Ultrafast surface melting of orbital order in La0.5Sr1.5MnO4

Abstract: Understanding how light modifies long-range order in quantum materials is key to improving our ability to control functionality. However, this is challenging if the response is heterogeneous. Here we address the most common form of light-induced heterogeneity, surface melting, and measure the dynamics of orbital order in the layered manganite, La0.5Sr1.5MnO4. We isolate the surface dynamics from the bulk by measuring the orbital truncation rod as well as orbital Bragg peak. After photoexcitation, the orbital Bragg peak shows an unusual narrowing, which suggests an increase in the correlation length in the probed volume. In contrast, the correlation length at the surface decreases. These differences can be reconciled if the material is heterogeneous, and light melts a less ordered surface. By isolating the surface response, we determine that the loss of long-range order is an incoherent process, which is likely accompanied by the formation of local polarons.

Title: Shapiro steps in strongly-interacting Fermi gases
Authors: Giulia Del Pace, Diego Hernández-Rajkov, Vijay Pal Singh, Nicola Grani, Marcia Frómeta Fernández, Giulio Nesti, Jorge Amin Seman, Massimo Inguscio, Luigi Amico, Giacomo Roati
Abstract: We report the observation of Shapiro steps in a periodically driven Josephson junction between strongly-interacting Fermi superfluids of ultracold atoms. We observe quantized plateaus in the current-potential characteristics, the height and width of which mirror the external drive frequency and the junction nonlinear response. Direct measurements of the current-phase relationship showcase how Shapiro steps arise from the synchronization between the relative phase of the two reservoirs and the external drive. Such mechanism is further supported by the detection of periodic phase-slippage processes, in the form of vortex-antivortex pairs. Our results are corroborated by a circuital model and numerical simulations, overall providing a clear understanding of Shapiro dynamics in atomic Fermi superfluids. Our work demonstrates phase-coherent and synchronization effects in driven strongly-interacting superfluids, opening prospects for studying emergent non-equilibrium dynamics in quantum many-body systems under external drives.

Title: Charge Susceptibility and Kubo Response in Hatsugai-Kohmoto-related Models
Authors: Yuhao Ma, Jinchao Zhao, Edwin W. Huang, Dhruv Kush, Barry Bradlyn, Philip W. Phillips
Abstract: We study in depth the charge susceptibility for the band Hatsugai-Kohmoto (HK) and orbital (OHK) models. As either of these models describes a Mott insulator, the charge susceptibility takes on the form of a modified density response function with lower and upper Hubbard bands, thereby giving rise to a multi-pole structure. The particle-hole continuum consists of hot spots along the $\omega$ vs $q$ axis arising from inter-band transitions. Such transitions, which are strongly suppressed in non-interacting systems, obtain here because of the non-rigidity of the Hubbard bands. This modified density response function gives rise to a plasmon dispersion that is inversely dependent on the momentum, resulting in an additional contribution to the conventional f-sum rule. This extra contribution originates from a long-range diamagnetic contribution to the current. This results in a non-commutativity of the long-wavelength ($q\rightarrow 0$) and thermodynamic ($L\rightarrow\infty$) limits. When the correct limits are taken, we find that the Kubo response computed with either open or periodic boundary conditions yields identical results that are consistent with the continuity equation contrary to recent claims. We also show that the long wavelength pathology of the current noted previously also plagues the Anderson impurity model interpretation of dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT).

Title: Multiple Majorana bound states and their resilience against disorder in planar Josephson junctions
Authors: Pankaj Sharma, Narayan Mohanta
Abstract: Planar Josephson junctions are theoretically predicted to harbor zero-energy Majorana bound states (MBS) in a tunable two-dimensional geometry, at the two ends of the middle metallic channel. Here we show that three distinct topological superconducting regimes, governing the localization of the near-zero-energy MBS, appear in these planar Josephson junctions. The topologically-protected MBS appear near the narrow edges of the junction -- not only in the middle metallic channel but also in the superconducting leads which have widths similar to the values used in recent experiments. We incorporate random fluctuation in the chemical potential to investigate the influence of non-magnetic disorder on the localization of the MBS in different topological regimes and find that the MBS are quite robust against disorder because of the two-dimensional geometry. Interestingly, moderate amount of disorder reduces the splitting between the MBS pairs, possibly by minimizing the wave function overlap of the MBS. We also discuss the changes in the topological superconducting phases when the superconducting lead width is varied. Our results reveal a rich structure of the localization of topologically protected multiple MBS in experimentally-accessible planar Josephson junctions, and call for their experimental confirmation.

Title: Topological Spin Textures Enabling Quantum Transmission
Authors: Ji Zou, Stefano Bosco, Jelena Klinovaja, Daniel Loss
Abstract: Quantum spintronics is an emerging field focused on developing novel applications by utilizing the quantum coherence of magnetic systems. A key challenge in this context is achieving scalable long-range quantum information transmission in magnetic systems. Here, we propose a novel transmission scheme based on topological spin textures in a hybrid architecture combining a magnetic racetrack and localized spin qubits. We demonstrate this principle by employing the domain wall (DW), the most fundamental texture, to transport quantum signal between distant qubits. We introduce a measurement-free protocol that utilizes DW mobility to enable high-fidelity and tunable entanglement generation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that spin qubits can function as quantum stations on the racetrack, enabling flexible state transfer among fast-moving DWs on a single track. Finally, we discuss concrete material platforms to implement the proposed scheme. Our work introduces a new hybrid quantum platform that merges topological spin textures with solid-state qubits, offering a scalable architecture for quantum information processing and opening promising directions for quantum spintronics.

Title: Imaging heat transport in suspended diamond nanostructures with integrated spin defect thermometers
Authors: Valentin Goblot, Kexin Wu, Enrico Di Lucente, Yuchun Zhu, Elena Losero, Quentin Jobert, Claudio Jaramillo Concha, Niels Quack, Nicola Marzari, Michele Simoncelli, Christophe Galland
Abstract: Among all materials, mono-crystalline diamond has one of the highest measured thermal conductivities, with values above 2000 W/m/K at room temperature. This stems from momentum-conserving `normal' phonon-phonon scattering processes dominating over momentum-dissipating `Umklapp' processes, a feature that also suggests diamond as an ideal platform to experimentally investigate phonon heat transport phenomena that violate Fourier's law. Here, we introduce dilute nitrogen-vacancy color centers as in-situ, highly precise spin defect thermometers to image temperature inhomogeneities in single-crystal diamond microstructures heated from ambient conditions. We analyze cantilevers with cross-sections in the range from about 0.2 to 2.6 $\mu$m$^2$, observing a strong reduction of the cantilevers' conductivity as the width decreases. We use first-principles simulations based on the linearized phonon Boltzmann transport equation and viscous heat equations to quantitatively predict the cantilevers' thermal transport properties, rationalizing how the interplay between intrinsic and extrinsic phonon scattering mechanisms determines the observed non-diffusive behavior. Our temperature-imaging method paves the way for the exploration of unconventional, non-diffusive heat transport phenomena in devices and nanostructures of arbitrary geometries.

Title: Evidence for Mott Gap Softening Coinciding with Spin Correlations Collapse in a-RuCl3
Authors: Wei Yue, Xiaohu Zheng, Chongli Yang, Kun Peng, Katsumi Tanigaki, Rui-Rui Du
Abstract: The Mott insulator a-RuCl3, featuring the intertwined interplay of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and Kitaev spin correlations, provides an unparalleled platform for probing quantum many-body physics. Using scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS), we compare temperature-dependent dI/dV spectra between in-situ grown monolayers and exfoliated bulk samples. Both systems exhibit pronounced Mott gap softening near 110 K, manifested by spectral weight transfer from Hubbard bands toward the Fermi level, resulting in low-energy correlated charge delocalization. Although this gap softening coincides with Kitaev paramagnetic and structural phase transitions in bulk crystals, monolayer studies provide compelling insights. By eliminating structural phase transition in monolayer sample, we suggest that spin correlations, rather than Coulomb interactions alone, may govern charge dynamics within the Mott-Hubbard framework, challenging conventional Mott-Hubbard paradigms. These results resolve a long-standing controversy regarding the Mott gap magnitude in a-RuCl3 and experimentally confirm the critical role of spin correlations in Mott physics.

Title: Interplay of orbital-selective Mott criticality and flat-band physics in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_6$
Authors: Frank Lechermann, Steffen Bötzel, Ilya M. Eremin
Abstract: Superconductivity in nickelates apparently takes place in two different Ni oxidation regimes, namely either for infinite-layer-type compounds close to Ni$^{+}$, or for Ruddlesden-Popper materials close to Ni$^{2+}$. The reduced La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_6$ bilayer with a nominal Ni$^{1.5+}$ oxidation state may therefore serve as a normal-state mediator between the two known families of $3d^8$-like and $3d^9$-like superconducting nickelates. Using first-principles many-body theory, we explain its experimental 50\,meV charge gap as originating from a new type of correlated (quasi-)insulator. Flat-band electrons of Ni-$d_{z^2}$ character become localized from scattering with orbital-selective Mott-localized Ni-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ electrons, by trading in residual hopping energy for a gain in local exchange energy in a ferromagnetic Kondo-lattice scenario. Most importantly, the flat-band electrons offer another route to unconventional superconductivity in nickelates at ambient pressure.

Title: Boundary layers, transport and universal distribution in boundary driven active systems
Authors: Pritha Dolai, Arghya Das
Abstract: We discuss analytical results for a run-and-tumble particle (RTP) in one dimension in presence of boundary reservoirs. It exhibits `kinetic boundary layers', nonmonotonous distribution, current without density gradient, diffusion facilitated current reversal and optimisation on tuning dynamical parameters, and a new transport effect in the steady state. The spatial and internal degrees of freedom together possess a symmetry, using which we find the eigenspectrum for large systems. The eigenvalues are arranged in two bands which can mix in certain conditions resulting in a crossover in the relaxation. The late time distribution for large systems is obtained analytically; it retains a strong and often dominant `active' contribution in the bulk rendering an effective passive-like description inadequate. A nontrivial `Milne length' also emerges in the dynamics. Finally, a novel universality is proposed in the absorbing boundary problem for dynamics with short-range colored noise. Active processes driven by active reservoirs may thus provide a common physical ground for diverse and new nonequilibrium phenomena.

Title: Machine Learning-Driven Insights into Excitonic Effects in 2D Materials
Authors: Ahsan Javed, Sajid Ali
Abstract: Understanding excitonic effects in two-dimensional (2D) materials is critical for advancing their potential in next-generation electronic and photonic devices. In this study, we introduce a machine learning (ML)-based framework to predict exciton binding energies in 2D materials, offering a computationally efficient alternative to traditional methods such as many-body perturbation theory (GW) and the Bethe-Salpeter equation. Leveraging data from the Computational 2D Materials Database (C2DB), our ML models establish connections between cheaply available material descriptors and complex excitonic properties, significantly accelerating the screening process for materials with pronounced excitonic effects. Additionally, Bayesian optimization with Gaussian process regression was employed to efficiently filter materials with largest exciton binding energies, further enhancing the discovery process. Although developed for 2D systems, this approach is versatile and can be extended to three-dimensional materials, broadening its applicability in materials discovery.

Title: Two-body contact of a Bose gas near the superfluid--Mott-insulator transition
Authors: Moksh Bhateja, Nicolas Dupuis, Adam Rançon
Abstract: The two-body contact is a fundamental quantity of a dilute Bose gas that relates the thermodynamics to the short-distance two-body correlations. For a Bose gas in an optical lattice, near the superfluid--Mott-insulator transition, we show that a ``universal'' contact $C_{\rm univ}$ can be defined from the singular part $P-P_{\rm MI}$ of the pressure ($P_{\rm MI}$ is the pressure of the Mott insulator). Its expression $C_{\rm univ}=C_{\rm DBG}(|n-n^{\rm MI}|,a^*)$ coincides with that of a dilute Bose gas provided we consider the effective ``scattering length'' $a^*$ of the quasi-particles at the quantum critical point (QCP) rather than the scattering length in vacuum, and the excess density $|n-n^{\rm MI}|$ of particles (or holes) with respect to the Mott insulator. Close to the transition, we find that the singular part $n^{\rm sing}_{\bf k} = n_{\bf k} - n^{\rm MI}_{\bf k}$ of the momentum distribution exhibits a high-momentum tail of the form $Z_{\rm QP} C_{\rm univ}/|{\bf k}|^4$ over a broad region of the Brillouin zone, where $Z_{\rm QP}$ is the quasi-particle weight of the elementary excitations at the QCP. Our results demonstrate that the notion of contact extends to strongly correlated lattice bosons, and we argue that the contact $C_{\rm univ}$ can be measured in state-of-the-art experiments on Bose gases in optical lattices and magnetic insulators.

Title: Strong-coupling RPA theory of a Bose gas near the superfluid--Mott-insulator transition: universal thermodynamics and two-body contact
Authors: Nicolas Dupuis, Moksh Bhateja, Adam Rançon
Abstract: We present a strong-coupling expansion of the Bose-Hubbard model based on a mean-field treatment of the hopping term, while onsite fluctuations are taken into account exactly. This random phase approximation (RPA) describes the universal features of the generic Mott-insulator--superfluid transition (induced by a density change) and the superfluid state near the phase transition. The critical quasi-particles at the quantum critical point have a quadratic dispersion with an effective mass $m^*$ and their mutual interaction is described by an effective $s$-wave scattering length $a^*$. The singular part of the pressure takes the same form as in a dilute Bose gas, provided we replace the boson mass $m$ and the scattering length in vacuum $a$ by $m^*$ and $a^*$, and the density $n$ by the excess density $|n-n_{\rm MI}|$ of particles (or holes) with respect to the Mott insulator. We define a ``universal'' two-body contact $C_{\rm univ}$ that controls the high-momentum tail $\sim 1/|{\bf k}|^4$ of the singular part $n^{\rm sing}_{\bf k}$ of the momentum distribution. We also apply the strong-coupling RPA to a lattice model of hard-core bosons and find that the high-momentum distribution is controlled by a universal contact, in complete agreement with the Bose-Hubbard model. Finally, we discuss a continuum model of bosons in an optical lattice and define two additional two-body contacts: a short-distance ``universal'' contact $C_{\rm univ}^{\rm sd}$ which controls the high-momentum tail of $n^{\rm sing}_{\bf k}$ at scales larger than the inverse lattice spacing, and a ``full'' contact $C$ which controls the high-momentum tail of the full momentum distribution $n_{\bf k}$.

Title: Thermoelectric properties of magic angle twisted bilayer graphene-superconductor hetero-junction: effect of valley polarization and trigonal warping
Authors: Kamalesh Bera, Pritam Chatterjee, Priyanka Mohan, Arijit Saha
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the thermoelectric properties (electronic contribution) of a normal-superconductor (NS) hybrid junction, where the normal region consists of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG). The superconducting region is characterized by a common $s$-wave superconductor closely proximitized to the MATBG. We compute various thermoelectric coefficients, including thermal conductance, thermopower, and the figure of merit ($zT$), using the scattering matrix formalism. These results are further supported by calculations based on a lattice-regularized version of the effective Hamiltonian. Additionally, we explore the impact of trigonal warping and valley polarization on the thermoelectric coefficients. Notably, we find a significant variation in $zT$ as a function of these parameters, reaching values as high as 2.5. Interestingly, we observe a violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law near the charge neutrality point with the superconducting correlation, indicating that MATBG electrons behave as slow Dirac fermions in this regime. This observation is further confirmed by the damped oscillatory behavior of the thermal conductance as a function of the barrier strength when an insulating barrier is modelled at the interface of the NS junction. Beyond theoretical insights, our findings suggest new possibilities for thermoelectric applications using MATBG based NS junctions.

Title: The Capriccio method as a versatile tool for quantifying the fracture properties of glassy materials under complex loading conditions with chemical specificity
Authors: Felix Weber, Maxime Vassaux, Lukas Laubert, Sebastian Pfaller
Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are widely used to provide insights into fracture mechanisms while maintaining chemical specificity. However, particle-based techniques such as MD are limited in terms of accessible length scales and applicable boundary conditions, which restricts the investigation of fracture phenomena in typical engineering settings. In an attempt to overcome these limitations, we apply the partitioned-domain Capriccio method to couple atomistic MD samples representing silica glass with the finite element (FE) method. With this approach, we perform mode I (rectangular panel under tension, three-, and four-point bending), mode II as well as mode III (rectangular panel under in-plane or out-of-plane shear) simulations. Thereby, we investigate multiple criteria to identify the onset of crack propagation based on the virial stress, the number of pair interactions, the kinetic energy/temperature, the crack velocity, and the crack opening displacement. The approach presented provides quantitatively plausible results for the critical stress intensity factors KIc, KIIc, and KIIIc. This contribution shows that the Capriccio method is a flexible means of performing fracture simulations that take into account boundary conditions typical of experimental test setups with atomistic specificity near the crack tip. While also pointing out the current limitations of the Capriccio method, we demonstrate its potential to integrate atomistic insights into FE models with significantly larger overall dimensions.

Title: Realization of strain induced multiple topological phases in Cu$_2$SnS$_3$: An $ab$-$initio$ study
Authors: Prakash Pandey, Sudhir K. Pandey
Abstract: The search of multiple topological phases (TPs) and their transitions by tuning different parameters through chemical substitutions, electric field, magnetic field, strain and Floquet engineering, etc has garnered a widespread attention in recent time. In spite of great effort, the observations of multiple TPs in a single material and multiple TP transitions in the presence of one parameter remain elusive. Here we demonstrate the presence of multiple TPs and their transitions with uniaxial compressive strain (UCS) in orthorhombic Cu$_2$SnS$_3$ by using $state$-$of$-$the$-$art$ $ab$-$initio$ calculations. In the absence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC), the Cu$_2$SnS$_3$ exhibits a single (type-II) nodal-ring and in the presence of SOC, it hosts Weyl phase with seven Weyl points (three at $\Gamma$ and four at general positions) along with nodal arcs. On the application of UCS, it remains type-II nodal-ring $<5.5$\%, which further evolves into type-III nodal-ring for $5.5\% \leq$ UCS $<5.6$\%. Interestingly, at 5.6\% of UCS, it shows Weyl phase with four Weyl nodes even in the absence of SOC. All the above-mentioned seven Weyl points persist below $5$\% of UCS. For 5\% $\leq$ UCS $<5.6$\%, four Weyl points (at general positions) disappear and nodal-arcs remain intact in all the studied range of UCS. The TPs observed in the absence of SOC appears to arise due to the presence of strain driven topological flat band, which is typically reported to be seen in kagome and Lieb lattices.

Title: Leveraging recurrence in neural network wavefunctions for large-scale simulations of Heisenberg antiferromagnets on the square lattice
Authors: M. Schuyler Moss, Roeland Wiersema, Mohamed Hibat-Allah, Juan Carrasquilla, Roger G. Melko
Abstract: Machine-learning-based variational Monte Carlo simulations are a promising approach for targeting quantum many-body ground states, especially in two dimensions and in cases where the ground state is known to have a non-trivial sign structure. While many state-of-the-art variational energies have been reached with these methods for finite-size systems, little work has been done to use these results to extract information about the target state in the thermodynamic limit. In this work, we employ recurrent neural networks (RNNs) as a variational ansätze, and leverage their recurrent nature to simulate the ground states of progressively larger systems through iterative retraining. This transfer learning technique allows us to simulate spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ systems on lattices with more than 1,000 spins without beginning optimization from scratch for each system size, thus reducing the demands for computational resources. In this study, we focus on the square-lattice antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model, where it is possible to carefully benchmark our results. We show that we are able to systematically improve the accuracy of the results from our simulations by increasing the training time, and obtain results for finite-sized lattices that are in good agreement with the literature values. Furthermore, we use these results to extract accurate estimates of the ground-state properties in the thermodynamic limit. This work demonstrates that RNN wavefunctions are able to extract accurate information about quantum many-body systems in the thermodynamic limit.

Title: The Low-Temperature Phenomenology of Gap Inhomogeneity in the Cuprate Superconductors: High-Energy Granularity, Low-Energy Homogeneity, and Spectral Kinks
Authors: Miguel Antonio Sulangi
Abstract: Scanning tunneling spectroscopy experiments on a number of cuprate superconductors have revealed that these materials are highly inhomogeneous. However, even though this inhomogeneity is well-characterized experimentally, a theoretical understanding of the effect of an inhomogeneous superconducting $d$-wave order parameter on various observables is still not complete. Here, we focus on the particular role played by the length scale of superconducting order-parameter inhomogeneity. We make use of a model involving square patches tiling the system, with each patch hosting a broadly distributed random value of the $d$-wave parameter. By using large-scale simulations, we are able to study how the size of the patches affects the correspondence between various measures of the superconducting gap and the underlying order parameter. If the length scale of the inhomogeneity is smaller than the average superconducting coherence length, the resulting $d$-wave superconductor is homogeneous. However, when the order parameter varies on the scale of the coherence length, we find the emergence of a striking low-/high-energy dichotomy, in which the low-energy regime is homogeneous while the high-energy states are strongly inhomogeneous. Kinks in the local spectra are found at the energy demarcating the homogeneous-inhomogeneous transition. We also observe that the gap extracted from the low-energy slope of the LDOS is extremely uniform. We find in both of these regimes that the distribution of the spectral gap is narrower than that of the order parameter; these start to match only when the size of the patches becomes parametrically larger than the coherence length. We comment on the applicability of these results to the cuprates, discuss the limitations of the inhomogeneous $d$-wave model, and point out where beyond-mean-field correlation effects are likely to be present in addition to inhomogeneity.

Title: Large deviations of the largest eigenvalue for deformed GOE/GUE random matrices via replica
Authors: Pierre Le Doussal
Abstract: We study the probability distribution function $P(\lambda)$ of the largest eigenvalue $\lambda_{\rm max}$ of $N \times N$ random matrices of the form $H + V$, where $H$ belongs to the GOE/GUE ensemble and $V$ is a full rank deterministic diagonal perturbation. This model is related to spherical spin glasses and semi-discrete directed polymers. In the large $N$ limit, using the replica method introduced in Ref. \cite{TrivializationUs2014}, we obtain the rate function ${\cal L}(\lambda)$ which describes the upper large deviation tail $P(\lambda) \sim e^{- \beta N {\cal L}(\lambda) }$. We also obtain the moment generating function $\langle e^{N s {\lambda}_{\max} } \rangle \sim e^{N \phi(s)}$ and the overlap of the optimal eigenvector with the perturbation $V$. For suitable $V$, a transition generically occurs in the rate functions. For the GUE it has a direct interpretation as a localisation transition for tilted directed polymers with competing columnar and point disorder. Although in a different form, our results are consistent with those obtained recently by Mc Kenna in \cite{McKenna2021}. Finally, we consider briefly the quadratic optimisation problem in presence of an additional random field and obtain its large deviation rate function, although only within the replica symmetric phase.

Title: Inverse thermodynamic uncertainty relation and entropy production
Authors: Van Tuan Vo, Andreas Dechant, Keiji Saito
Abstract: Nonequilibrium current fluctuations represent one of the central topics in nonequilibrium physics. The thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR) is widely acclaimed for rigorously establishing a lower bound on current fluctuations, expressed in terms of the entropy production rate and the average current. In this study, we focus on an upper bound for the fluctuations, referred to as the inverse thermodynamic uncertainty relation (iTUR). We derive a universal iTUR expression in terms of the entropy production rate for continuous-variable systems governed by overdamped Langevin equations, as well as for discrete-variable systems described by Markov jump processes. The iTUR establishes a no-go theorem prohibiting perpetual superdiffusion in systems with a finite entropy production rate and a finite spectral gap. The divergence of the variance of any current becomes possible only when the spectral gap of the symmetrized time-evolution operator closes or the entropy production rate diverges. As a relevant experimental scenario, we apply the iTUR to the phenomenon of giant diffusion, emphasizing the pivotal roles of the spectral gap and entropy production.

Title: Nonequilibrium Statistics of Biased Kondo Resonance
Authors: Jong E. Han
Abstract: Numerical renormalization group (NRG) is formulated for nonequilibrium steady-state by converting finite-lattice many-body eigenstates into scattering states. Extension of the full-density-matrix NRG for a biased Anderson impurity model, simplified by formulating with the original orbital basis as the Hamiltonian, enables detailed studies of the sub-Kondo spectral evolution in the zero-temperature limit, confirming the double-resonance structure at bias of the Kondo energy scale $T_K$. The distribution shows distinct multi-scale spectral features at energy $\omega$ below the Kondo scale ($\omega\lesssim T_K$) and near the bias ($\omega\gtrsim V$), leading to the nonequilibrium temperature $T_{\rm loc}$ local to the Kondo dot scaling as $k_BT_{\rm loc}\approx V$ for $V\gg T_K$. The current-voltage relation in the low-temperature limit ($T\ll T_K$) deviates from the unitary limit as the bias exceeds the Kondo scale ($V/2\gtrsim T_K$) and reaches the current saturation regime.

Title: Optical-vortex-pulse induced nonequilibrium spin textures in spin-orbit coupled electrons
Authors: Shunki Yamamoto, Masahiro Sato, Satoshi Fujimoto, Takeshi Mizushima
Abstract: Optical vortex beams are a type of topological light characterized by their inherent orbital angular momentum, leading to the propagation of a spiral-shaped wavefront. In this study, we focus on two-dimensional electrons with Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit interactions and examine how they respond to pulsed vortex beams in the terahertz frequency band. Spin-orbital interactions play a vital role in transferring the orbital angular momentum of light to electron systems and generating spatiotemporal spin textures. We show that the spatiotemporal spin polarization of electrons reflects orbital angular momentum carried by optical vortex pulses. These findings demonstrate how optical vortices facilitate ultrafast spin manipulation in spin-orbit-coupled electrons. Our results can be straightforwardly extended to the case of higher-frequency vortex beams for other two-dimensional metals with a larger Fermi energy.

Title: Superconducting Sn-Intercalated TaSe$_2$: Structural Diversity Obscured by Routine Characterization Techniques
Authors: Brenna C. Bierman, Gillian Nolan, Hongrui Ma, Ying Wang, Pinshane Huang, Daniel A. Rhodes
Abstract: Using Sn-intercalated TaSe$_2$ as a model system, we demonstrate the presence of structural heterogeneity captured by single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) that eludes the routine characterization techniques of powder X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and electronic transport measurements. From a single growth composition (1:1:2 Sn:Ta:Se), we obtained crystals diverse in stoichiometry and structure, with near-continuous intercalation for Sn$_x$TaSe$_2$ from $0\lesssim{x}\lesssim1$. Using SCXRD, we found global structural diversity, identifying three new structure types: Sn$_{0.18}$TaSe$_{2.0}$/Sn$_{0.08}$TaSe$_{1.96}$ ($R3m$), Sn$_{0.16}$TaSe$_{2.0}$ ($P6_3/mmc$), and Sn$_{1.2}$TaSe$_{1.9}$ ($Fmm2$). Using STEM, we observed local structural diversity, manifested as regions of highly variable stacking within a single crystal. In contrast, powder X-ray diffraction did not resolve all observed global structures. Raman spectroscopy was unable to distinguish between different structures or compositions in the standard measurement range. Electronic transport measurements showed consistent superconductivity and charge density wave behavior irrespective of Sn-intercalation amount. Our results indicate that routine approaches to characterization of intercalated transition metal dichalcogenides may be inadequate for capturing the diversity of this family of materials, highlighting the need for high-resolution structural characterization when examining the properties of van der Waals-layered compounds.

Title: Exploring two dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant phases with time reversal symmetry and their transitions with topological operations
Authors: Ryan C. Spieler
Abstract: We use various topological operations to systematically study phase transitions between theories with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and time reversal symmetry in two spacetime dimensions. The phases (and accompanying CFTs) we consider come in two types - bosonic phases that are defined on unorientable manifolds and fermionic phases that are sensitive to a $\text{Pin}^-$ structure. In both cases, our analysis leads to eight phase diagrams, with the two sets of eight connected by fermionization/bosonization. Starting from a seed CFT, we obtain the CFT that governs each transition. Many of these exhibit symmetry enriched criticality. In addition to showing many symmetry enriched CFTs in their natural habitats, our work discusses the fermionic analogs of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ bosonic operations, which we have not seen discussed in the literature.

Title: Non-Hermitian band topology in twisted bilayer graphene aligned with hexagonal boron nitride
Authors: Kamalesh Bera, Debasish Mondal, Arijit Saha, Debashree Chowdhury
Abstract: Utilizing the established Bistritzer-MacDonald model for twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG), we theoretically investigate the non-Hermitian (NH) topological properties of this in the presence of non-reciprocal (NR) hopping on both layers and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) induced mass term incorporated only on the top layer of the tBLG system. It is well known that the hBN mass term breaks the \(C_{2}\) symmetry of tBLG and gaps out the Dirac cones inducing a valley Hall insulating phase. However, when NR hopping is introduced, this system transits into a NH valley Hall insulator (NH-VHI). Our analysis reveals that, in the chiral limit, the bandwidth of the system vanishes under NH effects for a wide range of twist angles. Such range can be visibly expanded as we enhance the degree of non-Hermiticity (\(\beta\)). At the magic angle, we observe that enhancement of \(\beta\) inflates the robustness of the gapless Dirac points, requiring a progressively larger mass term to induce a gap in the NH tBLG system. Additionally, for a fixed NH parameter, we identify a range of twist angles where gap formation is significantly obstructed. To explore the topological aspects of the NH tBLG, we analyze the direct band gap in the Moiré Brillouin zone (mBZ) and compute the Chern number for the NH system. We find that the corresponding topological phase transitions are associated with corresponding direct band gap closings in the mBZ.

Title: Rashba Spin-Orbit Coupling and Nonlocal Correlations in Disordered 2D Systems
Authors: Yongtai Li, Gour Jana, Chinedu E. Ekuma
Abstract: We present an extension of the dynamical cluster approximation (DCA) that incorporates Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) to investigate the interplay between disorder, spin-orbit interaction, and nonlocal spatial correlations in disordered two-dimensional systems. By analyzing the average density of states, momentum-resolved self-energy, and return probability, we demonstrate how Rashba SOC and nonlocal correlations jointly modify single-particle properties and spin-dependent interference. The method captures key features of the symplectic universality class, including SOC-induced delocalization signatures at finite times. We benchmark the DCA results against those obtained from the numerically exact kernel polynomial method, finding good agreement. This validates the computationally efficient, mean-field-based DCA framework as a robust tool for exploring disorder, spin-orbit coupling, and nonlocal correlation effects in low-dimensional systems, and paves the way for simulating multiorbital and strongly correlated systems that were previously inaccessible due to computational limitations.

Title: Subdiffusion of sticky dendrimers in an associative polymer network
Authors: Silpa Mariya, Jeremy J. Barr, P. Sunthar, J. Ravi Prakash
Abstract: We investigate the static and dynamic properties of dendrimers diffusing through a network of linear associative polymers using coarse-grained Brownian dynamics simulations. Both dendrimers and network chains are modelled as bead-spring chain polymers, with hydrodynamic interactions incorporated for the accurate prediction of dynamic properties. Linear chains form a network via the associating groups distributed along their backbones, and the dendrimers interact attractively or repulsively with the network, enabling a direct comparison of sticky and non-sticky behaviour of dendrimers. Structural analysis reveals that while non-sticky dendrimers shrink with increasing network concentration, similar to linear polymer behaviour, sticky dendrimers exhibit stretching at low concentrations due to binding interactions. Dendrimer dynamics are largely insensitive to network architecture but are strongly influenced by the strength of dendrimer-network interactions. Increasing attraction to the network leads to subdiffusive motion and non-Gaussian displacement statistics, even when dendrimers are smaller than the average mesh size. The long-time diffusivity aligns with theoretical predictions for nanoparticle transport in polymer networks. Additionally, dendrimers deform the network locally, altering the mesh size distribution depending on their stickiness. These findings offer insight into the interplay between macromolecular architecture, binding interactions, and transport in polymeric environments.

Title: Design and assembly of a cavity microscope with high numerical aperture for quantum simulations
Authors: Gaia Stella Bolognini, Zeyang Xue, Michael Alexander Eichenberger, Nick Sauerwein, Francesca Orsi, Ekaterina Fedotova, Rohit Prasad Bhatt, Jean-Philippe Brantut
Abstract: We present the design and assembly of a cavity microscope for quantum simulations with ultracold atoms. The system integrates a high-finesse optical cavity with a pair of high-numerical aperture lenses sharing a common optical axis, enabling simultaneous operation with light close-to-atomic resonance. The system keeps the advantages of a rigid, single-block structure holding the lenses and cavity together, and improves over existing designs by using most of the solid angle left free by the cavity mode for imaging and atomic manipulation purposes. The cavity has a length of \SI{19.786}{\milli\meter}, a finesse of \SI{2.35}{\times 10^4} and operates \SI{214}{\micro\meter} away from the concentric limit, deep in the strong coupling regime. The two lenses offer a numerical aperture of $0.52$ each and maximal optical access in all directions transverse to the cavity axis, compatible with applications in quantum-gas microscopes, micro-tweezer arrays or few-fermions systems, as well as future cavity-assisted quantum simulation protocols demanding sub-cavity-mode control of the atom-cavity coupling.

Title: Quantized Transport of $ν= 2/3$ Fractional Quantum Hall Edge with Disordered Superconducting Proximity
Authors: Pok Man Tam, Hao Chen, Biao Lian
Abstract: Quantum Hall edge states in proximity to a superconductor (SC) usually acquire a non-quantized electron-to-hole conversion probability in transport, due to non-universal SC couplings and disorders. With counter-propagating modes, we show that the situation can be the opposite in the $\nu=2/3$ fractional quantum Hall (FQH) edge states with SC proximity, where disordered SC-couplings can reconstruct the edge states into an infinite set of stable phases with quantized electron-to-hole conversion probability along a long edge. Each phase is dominated by a disordered SC-coupling that tunnels $\pm |q_N|$ Cooper pairs, which can take values $|q_N|=1, 4, 15$, etc. We predict that this gives rise to a quantized downstream resistance $R_d = h/(2q^2_Ne^2)$ in an FQH-SC junction, serving as a quantized electrical transport signature beyond the Hall conductance. Higher-order nonlinear transport due to irrelevant Cooper pair tunneling or vortex dissipation is further studied, which becomes dominant when the edge is in a normal phase. Our results apply to both the single-layer state (as a particle-hole conjugate of $\nu=1/3$) and the bilayer Halperin-(112) state, revealing a rich landscape of disorder-stabilized phases in FQH edge states with SC proximity, and may as well apply to fractional Chern insulators recently observed at the same filling.

Title: Leveraging recurrence in neural network wavefunctions for large-scale simulations of Heisenberg antiferromagnets on the triangular lattice
Authors: M. Schuyler Moss, Roeland Wiersema, Mohamed Hibat-Allah, Juan Carrasquilla, Roger G. Melko
Abstract: Variational Monte Carlo simulations have been crucial for understanding quantum many-body systems, especially when the Hamiltonian is frustrated and the ground-state wavefunction has a non-trivial sign structure. In this paper, we use recurrent neural network (RNN) wavefunction ansätze to study the triangular-lattice antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model (TLAHM) for lattice sizes up to $30\times30$. In a recent study [M. S. Moss et al. arXiv:2502.17144], the authors demonstrated how RNN wavefunctions can be iteratively retrained in order to obtain variational results for multiple lattice sizes with a reasonable amount of compute. That study, which looked at the sign-free, square-lattice antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model, showed favorable scaling properties, allowing accurate finite-size extrapolations to the thermodynamic limit. In contrast, our present results illustrate in detail the relative difficulty in simulating the sign-problematic TLAHM. We find that the accuracy of our simulations can be significantly improved by transforming the Hamiltonian with a judicious choice of basis rotation. We also show that a similar benefit can be achieved by using variational neural annealing, an alternative optimization technique that minimizes a pseudo free energy. Ultimately, we are able to obtain estimates of the ground-state properties of the TLAHM in the thermodynamic limit that are in close agreement with values in the literature, showing that RNN wavefunctions provide a powerful toolbox for performing finite-size scaling studies for frustrated quantum many-body systems.

Title: Simulating generalised fluids via interacting wave packets evolution
Authors: Andrew Urilyon, Leonardo Biagetti, Jitendra Kethepalli, Jacopo De Nardis
Abstract: One-dimensional integrable and quasi-integrable systems display, on macroscopic scales, a universal form of transport known as Generalized Hydrodynamics (GHD). In its standard Euler-scale formulation, GHD mirrors the equations of a two-dimensional compressible fluid but ignores fluctuations and becomes numerically unwieldy as soon as integrability-breaking perturbations are introduced. We show that GHD can be efficiently simulated as a gas of semiclassical wave packets - a natural generalisation of hard-rod particles - whose trajectories are efficiently mapped onto those of point particles. This representation (i) provides a transparent route to incorporate integrability-breaking terms, and (ii) automatically embeds the exact fluctuating-hydrodynamics extension of GHD. The resulting framework enables fast, large-scale simulations of quasi-integrable systems even in the presence of complicated integrability-breaking perturbations. It also manifest the pivotal role of two-point correlations in systems confined by external potentials: we demonstrate that situations where local one-point observables appear thermalised can nevertheless sustain long-lived, far-from-equilibrium long-range correlations for arbitrarily long times, signaling that, differently from what previously stated, true thermalisation is not reached at diffusive time-scales.

Title: Overlap Gap and Computational Thresholds in the Square Wave Perceptron
Authors: Marco Benedetti, Andrej Bogdanov, Enrico M. Malatesta, Marc Mézard, Gianmarco Perrupato, Alon Rosen, Nikolaj I. Schwartzbach, Riccardo Zecchina
Abstract: Square Wave Perceptrons (SWPs) form a class of neural network models with oscillating activation function that exhibit intriguing ``hardness'' properties in the high-dimensional limit at a fixed constraint density $\alpha = O(1)$. In this work, we examine two key aspects of these models. The first is related to the so-called \emph{overlap-gap property}, that is a disconnectivity feature of the geometry of the solution space of combinatorial optimization problems proven to cause the failure of a large family of solvers, and conjectured to be a symptom of algorithmic hardness. We identify, both in the storage and in the teacher-student settings, the emergence of an overlap gap at a threshold $\alpha_{\mathrm{OGP}}(\delta)$, which can be made arbitrarily small by suitably increasing the frequency of oscillations $1/\delta$ of the activation. This suggests that in this small-$\delta$ regime, typical instances of the problem are hard to solve even for small values of $\alpha$. Second, in the teacher-student setup, we show that the recovery threshold of the planted signal for message-passing algorithms can be made arbitrarily large by reducing $\delta$. These properties make SWPs both a challenging benchmark for algorithms and an interesting candidate for cryptographic applications.

Title: Anomalous diffusion and directed coalescence of condensates out of equilibrium
Authors: Andriy Goychuk
Abstract: Phase separation into domains with distinct composition and properties has widespread implications, ranging from alloys and emulsions to biomolecular condensates in cells. In living and nonliving matter, the organization of these domains can be controlled by nonequilibrium chemical reactions, external fields, or mechanical stresses. In this context, stationary states can emerge from long-range monopolar interactions analogous to electrostatics. More generally, as discussed here, because fluxes induce dipolar force fields, externally controlled boundary motion effectively polarizes the domain even for microscopically nonpolarizable matter. The dipole-dipole interactions resulting from this translation-induced polarization cause directed coalescence of domains. This coarsening mechanism complements Ostwald ripening and coalescence due to Brownian motion or Marangoni flows, and has implications for controlling domains by electric fields or concentration gradients. Interestingly, the chemical potential gradients around a domain that nucleates material are exactly opposite to the hydrodynamic pressure gradients around an impermeable colloid that pushes the fluid, suggesting a competition between phase separation and hydrodynamics. In addition to chemical control, the motion of domains can also be driven by mechanical stresses. An example is the cell interior, where mechanical stresses are actively generated by molecular motors and opposed by passive viscoelastic stresses in the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm. The resulting fluid flows lead to Brownian motion with a suppressed or enhanced size scaling which modifies collision-coalescence. For active stresses with a long correlation time, the domains show superdiffusion on intermediate time scales. Together, these findings shed new light on the dynamics of domains in viscoelastic media and conserved order parameters in general.

Title: Exact zero modes in interacting Majorana X- and Y-junctions
Authors: Bowy M. La Rivière, Rik Mulder, Natalia Chepiga
Abstract: We report the emergence of exact zero modes in junctions of two, three and four short interacting Majorana wires, equivalent to a chain with an impurity bond, Y- and X- junctions respectively. These exact zero modes are due to incommensurate short-range correlations induced by the interacting Majorana fermions, and they appear as unavoided level crossings between in-gap states upon continuously tuning the interaction. In a junction of only two chains we report exact zero modes and parity switching as soon as the coupling between the chains across a junction is positive. Remarkably, for junctions with multiple chains the in-gap states group up into sets of parity pairs -- pairs of states with opposite parity and similar energies. We demonstrate that the formation of these parity pairs are always due to the interaction of the outer edges of the junction. The behavior within each pair can be efficiently described by two coupled chains. In the Y-junction, we detect four in-gap states (two parity pairs) that show exact zero modes not only within each pair but also between them. This is attributed to an additional Majorana fermion localized at the center of junction that is protected by symmetry. Therefore, coupling between the Majorana fermions at the outer edges of the junction is mediated by that in the center. We argue that this is a generic feature of junctions with an odd number of arms. In the X-junction we detect eight in-gap states (four parity pairs) that are the result of two Majorana degrees of freedom localized at the center of the junction. However, we demonstrate that, by contrast to the Y-junction, the appearance of Majorana fermions at the center of the X-junction is not protected and the interaction across the junction can be tuned to the point where there are only Majorana fermions localized at the four outer edges of the junction, forming four in-gap states.

Title: Dimer-projection contact and the clock shift of a unitary Fermi gas
Authors: Kevin G. S. Xie, Colin J. Dale, Kiera Pond Grehan, Maggie Fen Wang, Tilman Enss, Paul S. Julienne, Zhenhua Yu, Joseph H. Thywissen
Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of short-range correlations is a central challenge in strongly interacting Fermi gases. In ultracold gases, these correlations are quantified by the contact parameter, yet measurements to date have been limited to equilibrium systems or relatively slow, global dynamics. Here, we introduce a rapid spectroscopic technique based on projection of the interacting state onto an alternate scattering channel with a low-lying dimer state. We demonstrate contact measurements on the microsecond timescale -- faster than the inverse Fermi energy. Using $^{40}$K near a broad $s$-wave Feshbach resonance, we show that the strength of the dimer-projection feature scales proportionally with the contact parameter extracted from the high-frequency tail of radio-frequency spectroscopy, in agreement with coupled-channels calculations. Analysis of the spectra further reveals that the dimer feature provides the dominant contribution to the clock shift of the unitary Fermi gas, allowing the first experimental bound on this quantity. The observed deviations from universal predictions highlight the importance of multichannel effects. Our results open new avenues for studying contact correlators, hydrodynamic attractors, and quantum critical behavior.

Title: Efficient optimization of variational tensor-network approach to three-dimensional statistical systems
Authors: Xia-Ze Xu, Tong-Yu Lin, Guang-Ming Zhang
Abstract: Variational tensor network optimization has become a powerful tool for studying classical statistical models in two dimensions. However, its application to three-dimensional systems remains limited, primarily due to the high computational cost associated with evaluating the free energy density and its gradient. This process requires contracting a triple-layer tensor network composed of a projected entangled pair operator and projected entangled pair states. In this paper, we employ a split corner-transfer renormalization group scheme tailored for the contraction of such a triple-layer network, which reduces the computational complexity while keeping high accuracy. Through numerical benchmarks on the three-dimensional classical Ising model, we demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves numerical results comparable to the most recent Monte Carlo simulations, providing a substantial speedup over previous variational tensor network approaches. This makes this method well-suited for efficient gradient-based optimization in three-dimensional tensor network simulations.

Title: Topological Flat Minibands and Fractional Chern Insulators in Rashba Systems with Tunable Superlattice Potentials
Authors: Bokai Liang, Wei Qin, Zhenyu Zhang
Abstract: We propose a programmable platform for engineering topological flat minibands by imposing a tunable electrostatic superlattice potential on a Rashba spin-orbit-coupled thin film subject to a Zeeman field. The interplay between the superlattice potential and Zeeman coupling produces an isolated flat miniband with Chern number $\mathcal{C}=1$. Using many-body exact diagonalization, we show that this miniband supports fractional Chern insulators at filling factors $n = 1/3$ and $2/3$, both of which remain robust over broad parameter ranges. We further identify realistic material candidates and the corresponding device conditions that enable experimental realization. These results establish a versatile and experimentally accessible platform for engineering topological flat minibands and exploring correlated topological phases.

Title: Dynamical Heterogeneity in Supercooled Water and its Spectroscopic Fingerprints
Authors: Cesare Malosso, Edward Danquah Donkor, Stefano Baroni, Ali Hassanali
Abstract: A growing body of theoretical and experimental evidence strongly supports the existence of a second liquid-liquid critical point (LLCP) in deeply supercooled water leading to the co-existence of two phases: a high-and low-density liquid (HDL and LDL). While the thermodynamics associated with this putative LLCP has been well characterised through numerical simulations, the dynamical properties of these two phases close to the critical point remain much less understood. In this work, we investigate their dynamical and spectroscopic features using machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs). Dynamical analyses using the van-Hove correlation function, reveal that LDL exhibits very sluggish and heterogeneous molecular mobility, in contrast to the faster and more homogeneous dynamics of HDL. Infrared absorption (IR) spectra further show clear vibrational distinctions between LDL and HDL, in particular in the far IR region between 400 - 1000 cm-1. Together, these findings provide new dynamical fingerprints that clarify the microscopic behavior of supercooled water and offer valuable guidance for experimental efforts aimed at detecting the long-sought liquid-liquid transition.

Title: Nonlinear Symmetry-Fragmentation of Nonabelian Anyons In Symmetry-Enriched Topological Phases: A String-Net Model Realization
Authors: Nianrui Fu, Siyuan Wang, Yu Zhao, Yidun Wan
Abstract: Symmetry-enriched topological (SET) phases combine intrinsic topological order with global symmetries, giving rise to novel symmetry phenomena. While SET phases with Abelian anyons are relatively well understood, those involving nonabelian anyons remain elusive. This obscurity stems from the multidimensional internal gauge spaces intrinsic to nonabelian anyons -- a feature first made explicit in [1,2] and further explored and formalized in our recent works [3-8]. These internal spaces can transform in highly nontrivial ways under global symmetries. In this work, we employ an exactly solvable model -- the multifusion Hu-Geer-Wu string-net model introduced in a companion paper [9] -- to reveal how the internal gauge spaces of nonabelian anyons transform under symmetries. We uncover a universal mechanism, global symmetry fragmentation (GSF), whereby symmetry-invariant anyons exhibit internal Hilbert space decompositions into eigensubspaces labeled by generally fractional symmetry charges. Meanwhile, symmetry-permuted anyons hybridize and fragment their internal spaces in accordance with their symmetry behavior. These fragmented structures realize genuinely nonlinear symmetry representations -- to be termed coherent representations -- that transcend conventional linear and projective classifications, reflecting the categorical nature of symmetries in topological phases. Our results identify nonlinear fragmentation as a hallmark of nonabelian SETs and suggest new routes for symmetry-enabled control in topological quantum computation.

Title: Plasmonic detection of Rashba spin-orbit coupling in monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides
Authors: Y. Li, Z. H. Tao, Y. M. Xiao, W. Xu, Q. N. Li, F. M. Peeters, D. Neilson, M. V. Milosevic
Abstract: Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) induces strong momentum-dependent spin splitting and plays a crucial role in fields like spintronics and topological photonics. We here theoretically investigate the collective excitations in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (ML-TMDs) hosting RSOC, and conceive an approach to precisely quantify the strength of RSOC using plasmons. We determine the electron energy loss function (EELF) and plasmon dispersions for n-type ML-TMD from the dynamic dielectric function in the framework of the standard random phase approximation (RPA). In this system, both optical and acoustic plasmon modes are observed in the EELF and plasmon dispersions. Moreover, the plasmonic and spectral properties are tunable by electron density and dependent on RSOC. Crucially, we identify a minimum energy gap between the two plasmon modes to serve as a direct spectral signature of the RSOC strength. These results establish plasmons as a non-invasive, precise, and broadly tunable technique for determining RSOC in TMD van der Waals heterostructures and devices.

Title: Mean-field model for the bubble size distribution in coarsening wet foams
Authors: Jacob Morgan (1), Simon Cox (1) ((1) Department of Mathematics, Aberystwyth University, UK)
Abstract: Aqueous foams are subject to coarsening, whereby gas from the bubbles diffuses through the liquid phase. Gas is preferentially transported from small to large bubbles, resulting in a gradual decrease of the number of bubbles and an increase in the average bubble size. Coarsening foams are expected to approach a scaling state at late times in which their statistical properties are invariant. However, a model predicting the experimentally observed bubble-size distribution in the scaling state of foams with moderate liquid content, as a function of the liquid fraction $\phi$, has not yet been developed. To this end, we propose a three-dimensional mean-field bubble growth law for foams without inter-bubble adhesion, validated against bubble-scale simulations, and use it to derive a prediction of the scaling-state bubble-size distribution for any $\phi$ from zero up to the unjamming transition $\phi_\text{c} \approx 36\%$. We verify that the derived scaling state is approached from a variety of initial conditions using mean-field simulations implementing the proposed growth law. Comparing our predicted bubble-size distribution with previous simulations and experimental results, we likewise find a large population of small bubbles when $\phi > 0$, but there are qualitative differences from prior results which we attribute to the absence of rattlers, i.e. bubbles not pressed into contact with their neighbours, in our model.

Title: Optical Signatures of Band Flatness and Anisotropic Quantum Geometry in Magic-Angle Twisted Bilayer Graphene
Authors: Pok Man Chiu
Abstract: We study the degree of band flatness and anisotropic quantum geometry in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene by varying the twist angle and the lattice relaxation through optical conductivity. We show that the degree of band flatness and its quantum geometry can be revealed through optical absorption and its resulting optical bounds, which are based on the trace condition in quantum geometry. More specifically, the narrow and isolated peak of optical absorption in the low-energy region provides information about the bandwidth between two flat bands. When this value is smaller than the electron interaction, it serves as a critical condition for the emergence of flat band superconductivity. Furthermore, optical absorption also provides the gap value between the flat band and the dispersive band, and when this gap is larger than the electron interaction, it facilitates the realization of fractional Chern insulating phases. We show that the narrow and isolated peak of optical bound near zero energy decreases as lattice relaxation increases. Meanwhile, we demonstrate that the imaginary part of generalized optical Hall conductivity reveals the vanishing of the negative part of Berry curvature, which is enforced by the refined trace-determinant inequality. Accordingly, we show that the total amount of the negative part and component of the Berry curvature approaches zero in the single ideal flat-band case. In contrast, when considering all occupied bands, the total amount of the negative component is slightly different from zero. Finally, we demonstrate that the condition of vanishing of flat band velocities and the emergent chiral symmetry are sufficient for the saturation of the trace condition, which pertains to the isotropic case.

Title: Observation of anomalous tunneling in collective excitations via a cloud experiment platform for Bose-Einstein condensates
Authors: Daichi Kagamihara, Hironori Kazuta, Yewei Wu, N. J. Fitch, Ippei Danshita
Abstract: Recent development of cloud-based experiment platforms has enabled physicists to examine theoretical concepts with unprecedented accessibility. Oqtant is a cloud-accessible platform for trapped Bose-Einstein Condensates (BECs) of neutral atomic gases, providing an invaluable experimental tool for studying the dynamics of BECs. An intriguing theoretical prediction of a characteristic phenomenon of BECs is anomalous tunneling, whereby low-energy phonon excitations of BECs easily transmit through a barrier potential. We utilize Oqtant to observe the effects of anomalous tunneling on collective excitations of BECs. For this purpose, we theoretically show that anomalous tunneling affects the frequencies of the collective excitations in the low-energy regime, and experimentally measure these frequencies using Oqtant. Our results reveal that low-energy collective modes are less affected by a potential barrier, which indicates the presence of anomalous tunneling. Our work would contribute to fundamental understandings of BECs, as well as highlight the potential of cloud-based experiments in quantum-body physics.

Title: Bogoliubov quasi-particles in superconductors are integer-charged particles inapplicable for braiding quantum information
Authors: Zhiyu Fan, Wei Ku
Abstract: We present a rigorous proof that under a number-conserving Hamiltonian, one-body quasi-particles generally possess quantized charge and inertial mass identical to the bare particles. It follows that, Bogoliubov zero modes in the vortex (or on the edge) of superconductors $\textit{cannot}$ be their own anti-particles capable of braiding quantum information. As such, the heavily pursued Majorana zero mode-based route for quantum computation requires a serious re-consideration. This study further reveals the conceptual challenge in preparing and manipulating braid-able quantum states via physical thermalization or slow external fields. These profound results should reignite the long-standing quest for a number-conserving theory of superconductivity and superfluidity without fictitiously breaking global U(1) symmetry.

Title: Microscopic theory of strain-controlled split superconducting and time-reversal symmetry-breaking transitions in $s+id$ superconductor
Authors: Anton Talkachov, Egor Babaev
Abstract: We study conditions of the appearance of $U(1)\times \mathbb{Z}_2$ superconducting states that spontaneously break time-reversal symmetry (BTRS) on a square lattice as a function of applied stress. Calculations show that if critical temperatures coincide at zero stress, they exhibit a linear kink and no kink otherwise for uniaxial and isotropic strain. Linear kink is absent for shear strain. We find that in general, the microscopic calculations show a complex phase diagram, for example, non-monotonic behavior of BTRS transition. Another beyond-Ginzburg-Landau theory result is that $U(1)$ critical temperature can decrease under compressional [100] uniaxial strain for small Poisson ratio materials. In the second part of the paper, we consider the effects of boundaries and finiteness of the sample on the strain-induced splitting of $T_c^{U(1)}$ and $T_c^{\mathbb{Z}_2}$ transitions. A finite sample has BTRS boundary states with persistent superconducting currents over a wide range of band filling. Overall, the BTRS dome occupies a larger band filling--temperature phase space region for a mesoscopic sample with [110] surface compared to an infinite system. Hence, the presence of boundaries helps to stabilize the BTRS phase.

Title: Squeezing codes: robust fluctuation-stabilized memories
Authors: Ethan Lake, Sunghan Ro
Abstract: We introduce families of classical stochastic dynamics in two and higher dimensions which stabilize order in the absence of any symmetry. Our dynamics are qualitatively distinct from Toom's rule, and have the unusual feature of being fluctuation-stabilized: their order becomes increasingly fragile in larger dimensions. One of our models maintains an ordered phase only in two dimensions. The phase transitions that occur as the order is lost realize new dynamical universality classes which are fundamentally non-equilibrium in character.

Abstract: We consider a multi-walker generalization of the true self-avoiding walk: the bricklayer model. We perform stochastic simulations, and solve the partial differential equations that describe the collective motion of $N$ bricklayers/walkers coupled to the contour of an expanding wall. In the large-$N$ limit, the results from simulation agree with the solution of the partial differential equations.

Title: A physics-informed neural network approach to the point defect model for electrochemical oxide film growth
Authors: Mohid Farooqi, Ingmar Bösing, Conrard G. Tetsassi Feugmo
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) offer a novel AI-driven framework for integrating physical laws directly into neural network models, facilitating the solution of complex multiphysics problems in materials engineering. This study systematically explores the application of PINNs to simulate oxide film layer growth in halide-free solutions using the point defect model (PDM). We identify and analyze four key failure modes in this context: imbalanced loss components across different physical processes, numerical instabilities due to variable scale disparities, challenges in enforcing boundary conditions within multiphysics systems, and convergence to mathematically valid but physically meaningless solutions. To overcome these challenges, we implement and validate established techniques including nondimensionalization for training stabilization, Neural Tangent Kernel-based adaptive loss balancing, robust enforcement of boundary conditions and hybrid training with sparse data. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of these strategies in enhancing the reliability and physical fidelity of PINNs, achieving sub $1\%$ relative error as compared to Finite Element Benchmarks with the hybrid model. Thereby showing that PINNs can be used for high fidelity electrochemical simulations with minimal data requirements and highlight necesary factors for fully autonomous PINN simulations.

Title: Anyon Bound States and Hybrid Superconductivity
Authors: Paul Leask
Abstract: The interactions of anyonic quasi-particles (vortices) in the Chern--Simons extension of the Ginzburg--Landau model is investigated and we show that it manifestly realizes a hybridization of type I/II superconductivity. Through Gauss' law, each vortex simultaneously carries a flux quantum and a proportional Noether charge, thereby realizing an anyonic excitation. The Chern--Simons coupling also modifies the screening structure of the gauge fields, producing complex-conjugate masses that yield a common penetration depth with an oscillatory phase. This altered asymptotic behavior breaks the conventional type-I/type-II dichotomy of the Ginzburg--Landau model. As a result, vortex anyons experience short-range repulsion and long-range attraction, enabling the formation of separated multi-vortex bound states with non-monotonic interaction energy.

Title: Vestigial $d$-wave charge-$4e$ Superconductivity from Bidirectional Pair Density Waves
Authors: Ethan Huecker, Yuxuan Wang
Abstract: We analyze the leading vestigial instability due to the melting of a bidirectional pair-density-wave state in two dimensions. In a previous work by one of the authors, it was found that the interplay between pair-density-wave fluctuations with ordering momenta along the $x$ and $y$ directions can provide a strong attractive interaction for charge-$4e$ superconductivity in the $d$-wave channel. In this work, we go beyond the artificial large-$M$ mean-field theory previously adopted and compute the phase diagram by incorporating phase fluctuations of the pair-density-wave order parameters. By investigating the relevance of various topological defects, we show that the interaction in the $d$-wave channel, together with the strong anisotropy of phase fluctuations around the pair-density-wave ordering momenta, favors a vestigial charge-$4e$ superconducting order at intermediate temperatures. By contrast, a competing charge-density-wave vestigial order does not develop, due to the suppression of its stiffness.

Title: Spin Symmetry Criteria for Odd-parity Magnets
Authors: Xun-Jiang Luo, Jin-Xin Hu, K. T. Law
Abstract: Inspired by the discovery of altermagnets, which exhibit even-parity nonrelativistic spin splitting, odd-parity magnets (OPMs) have been proposed and emerged as a novel research frontier. In this study, we perform a comprehensive spin group symmetry analysis to establish symmetry criteria for the emergence of OPMs. We identify eight distinct symmetry-driven cases that support OPMs, enabling their realization in collinear, coplanar, and noncoplanar magnetic orders. These OPMs are categorized into three types based on their spin textures for Bloch states: collinear (type-I), coplanar (type-II), and noncoplanar (type-III). For type-I OPMs, we further delineate additional symmetry requirements for $p$-wave and $f$-wave spin splitting. We identify 48 candidate materials in the Magndata database that satisfy these symmetry criteria. Additionally, we construct two theoretical models to validate the effectiveness of the established symmetry criteria. Finally, we show that OPMs can exhibit an intrinsic $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topology and construct a theoretical model to realize this phase.

Title: Magnon-mediated Radiation and Phonon-driven Quenching of Excitons in a Layered Semiconductor
Authors: Yingchen Peng, Yanan Ge, Zihan Wang, Kang Wang, Kezhao Du, Xingzhi Wang, Ye Yang
Abstract: Layered van der Waals (vdW) magnetic semiconductors open a new avenue for exploring intertwined excitonic and magnetic phenomena. Here, we investigate this interplay in the vdW MnPS3 antiferromagnet, uncovering an exceptionally long exciton lifetime (~100 {\mu}s) below the Néel temperature (T_N). We demonstrate that the exciton lifetime is governed by phonon-mediated nonradiative recombination and thus exhibits a strong temperature dependence. On the contrary, the radiative recombination rate shows a distinct temperature dependence, which is dominated by magnon-assisted emission mechanism below T_N and by short-range spin correlations and phonons above T_N. These findings not only establish MnPS3 as a compelling candidate for excitonic devices due to its long-lifetime and correlation with magnetic orders but also provide crucial insights into the interplay between excitons, spins, and lattice in vdW magnetic semiconductors.

Title: Gate Voltage Tunable Second Harmonic Generation in Mono- and Bi-layer Black Phosphene
Authors: Yan Meng, Kainan Chang, Yanyan Qian, Luxia Wang, Jin Luo Cheng
Abstract: Black phosphorene (BP) has emerged as a promising platform for tunable nonlinear photonics due to its layer-dependent bandgap, high carrier mobility, and remarkable in-plane anisotropy. This study investigates the second-harmonic generation (SHG) of monolayer and bilayer BP under an external static electric field, with describing the electronic states by a tight-binding model and the dynamics by semiconductor Bloch equations. Our results reveal that BP exhibits large second-order nonlinear optical response along the armchair direction, with significant resonant enhancement when the incident photon energy approaches half of its bandgap. Under an applied electric field of $10^7$ V/m, the effective second-order nonlinear susceptibility of BP can be as large as $10^3$ pm/V, surpassing that of the conventional nonlinear crystal AgGaSe$_2$ by more than an order of magnitude. With respect to the static electric field induced by gate voltage, we discuss the relation between the electric-field-induced second harmonic (EFISH) generation and conventional SHG -- under lower gate voltage, the EFISH approach agrees well with the SHG solutions, whereas the former is no longer applicable under higher gate voltage. Specifically, as the increasing gate voltage, monolayer BP exhibits the bandgap expansion and the corresponding blue-shift in the SHG resonant peak. In contrast, bilayer BP undergoes a semiconductor-to-semimetal transition, forming Dirac cone and generating divergent SHG spectra as photon energy goes to zero. Additionally, the chemical potential allows for precise control over interband and intraband nonlinear responses. This work provides important theoretical foundations for the development of BP-based tunable nonlinear photonic devices and expands the application potential of anisotropic two-dimensional materials in nonlinear optics.

Title: Coherent Optical Control of Electron Dynamics in Patterned Graphene Nanoribbons
Authors: Riek H. Rüstemeier, H. P. Ojeda Collado, Ludwig Mathey
Abstract: The field of coherent electronics aims to advance electronic functionalities by utilizing quantum coherence. Here, we demonstrate a viable and versatile methodology for controlling electron dynamics optically in graphene nanoribbons. In particular, we propose to flatten the band structure of armchair graphene nanoribbons via control electrodes, arranged periodically along the extended direction of the nanoribbon. This addresses a key mechanism for dephasing in solids, which derives from the momentum dependence of the energy gap between the valence and the conduction band. We design an optimal driving field pulse to produce collective Rabi oscillations between these bands, in their flattened configuration. As an example for coherent control, we show that these optimized pulses can be used to invert the entire electronic band population by a $\pi$ pulse in a reversible fashion, and to create a superposition state via a $\pi/2$ pulse, which generates an alternating photocurrent. Our proposal consists of a platform and methodological approach to optically control the electron dynamics of graphene nanoribbons, paving the way toward novel coherent electronic and quantum information processing devices in solid-state materials.

Title: Family of Exact and Inexact Quantum Speed Limits for Completely Positive and Trace-Preserving Dynamics
Authors: Abhay Srivastav, Vivek Pandey, Brij Mohan, Arun Kumar Pati
Abstract: Traditional quantum speed limits formulated in density matrix space are generally unattainable for a wide class of dynamics and it is difficult to characterize the fastest possible dynamics. To address this, we present two distinct quantum speed limits in Liouville space for Completely Positive and Trace-Preserving (CPTP) dynamics. The first bound saturates for time-optimal CPTP dynamics, while the second bound is exact for all states and all CPTP dynamics. Our bounds have a clear physical and geometric interpretation arising from the uncertainty relations for operators acting on Liouville space, and the geometry of quantum evolution in Liouville space. We also obtain the form of the Liouvillian, which generates the time-optimal CPTP dynamics that connect the given initial and target states. To illustrate our findings, we show that the speed of evolution in Liouville space bounds the growth of the spectral form factor and Krylov complexity of states, which are crucial for studying information scrambling and quantum chaos. In another important application, we show that our results can help us understand the counter-intuitive phenomenon of the Mpemba effect in non-equilibrium open quantum dynamics, as the minimal relaxation time scale obtained by speed limits is dictated by the eigenmodes of the Liouvillian.

Title: Fighting Exponentially Small Gaps by Counterdiabatic Driving
Authors: András Grabarits, Federico Balducci, Adolfo del Campo
Abstract: We investigate the efficiency of approximate counterdiabatic driving (CD) in accelerating adiabatic passage through exponentially small gaps. First, we analyze a minimal spin-glass bottleneck model that is analytically tractable and exhibits both an exponentially small gap at the transition point and a change in the ground state that involves a macroscopic rearrangement of spins. Using the variational Floquet-Krylov expansion to construct CD terms, we find that while the formation of excitations is significantly suppressed, achieving a fully adiabatic evolution remains challenging. Extending our investigation to realistic NP-hard spin-glass problems -- specifically, the $3$-regular \textsc{Max Cut} and $3$-\textsc{XORSAT} -- we find again that local CD expansions lead to negligible improvements in the final ground state fidelity. These results highlight the limited impact of local CD methods in overcoming the bottlenecks associated with first-order quantum phase transitions. To address this limitation, we propose an alternative method, termed quantum brachistochrone counterdiabatic driving (QBCD), which employs the approximate full CD connecting the ground state and the first excited state at a single parameter value close to the critical point. In the minimal spin-glass model, QBCD enables exponentially faster adiabatic evolution than the local strategies. To alleviate the challenges of its experimental and classical implementation for realistic \textsc{NP}-hard problems, we exponentially reduce the non-locality of the QBCD Hamiltonian by sparsifying its matrix elements to the density of the local expansions. Despite this drastic simplification, sparsified QBCD maintains finite ground-state fidelity at driving times exponentially shorter than in local strategies and counterdiabatic optimized local driving (COLD).

Title: Average-case matrix discrepancy: satisfiability bounds
Authors: Antoine Maillard
Abstract: Given a sequence of $d \times d$ symmetric matrices $\{\mathbf{W}_i\}_{i=1}^n$, and a margin $\Delta > 0$, we investigate whether it is possible to find signs $(\epsilon_1, \dots, \epsilon_n) \in \{\pm 1\}^n$ such that the operator norm of the signed sum satisfies $\|\sum_{i=1}^n \epsilon_i \mathbf{W}_i\|_{\rm op} \leq \Delta$. Kunisky and Zhang (2023) recently introduced a random version of this problem, where the matrices $\{\mathbf{W}_i\}_{i=1}^n$ are drawn from the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble. This model can be seen as a random variant of the celebrated Matrix Spencer conjecture and as a matrix-valued analog of the symmetric binary perceptron in statistical physics. In this work, we establish a satisfiability transition in this problem as $n, d \to \infty$ with $n / d^2 \to \tau > 0$. First, we prove that the expected number of solutions with margin $\Delta=\kappa \sqrt{n}$ has a sharp threshold at a critical $\tau_1(\kappa)$: for $\tau < \tau_1(\kappa)$ the problem is typically unsatisfiable, while for $\tau > \tau_1(\kappa)$ the average number of solutions is exponentially large. Second, combining a second-moment method with recent results from Altschuler (2023) on margin concentration in perceptron-type problems, we identify a second threshold $\tau_2(\kappa)$, such that for $\tau>\tau_2(\kappa)$ the problem admits solutions with high probability. In particular, we establish that a system of $n = \Theta(d^2)$ Gaussian random matrices can be balanced so that the spectrum of the resulting matrix macroscopically shrinks compared to the semicircle law. Finally, under a technical assumption, we show that there exists values of $(\tau,\kappa)$ for which the number of solutions has large variance, implying the failure of the second moment method. Our proofs rely on establishing concentration and large deviation properties of correlated Gaussian matrices under spectral norm constraints.

Title: Fundamental precision limits in finite-dimensional quantum thermal machines
Authors: Yoshihiko Hasegawa
Abstract: Enhancing the precision of a thermodynamic process inevitably necessitates a thermodynamic cost. This notion was recently formulated as the thermodynamic uncertainty relation, which states that the lower bound on the relative variance of thermodynamic currents decreases as entropy production increases. From another viewpoint, the thermodynamic uncertainty relation implies that if entropy production were allowed to become infinitely large, the lower bound on the relative variance could approach zero. However, it is evident that realizing infinitely large entropy production is infeasible in reality. This indicates that physical constraints impose precision limits on the system, independent of its dynamics. In this study, we derive fundamental precision limits, dynamics-independent bounds on the relative variance and the expectations of observables for open quantum thermal machines operating within a finite-dimensional system and environment. These bounds are set by quantities such as dimensions and energy bandwidth, which depend only on the initial configuration and are independent of the dynamics. Using a quantum battery model, the fundamental precision limits show that there is a trade-off between the amount of energy storage and the charging precision. Additionally, we investigate how quantum coherence affects these fundamental limits, demonstrating that the presence of coherence can improve the precision limits. Our findings provide insights into fundamental limits on the precision of quantum thermal machines.

Title: Weak Hopf non-invertible symmetry-protected topological spin liquid and lattice realization of (1+1)D symmetry topological field theory
Authors: Zhian Jia
Abstract: We introduce weak Hopf symmetry as a tool to explore (1+1)-dimensional topological phases with non-invertible symmetries. Drawing inspiration from Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT), we construct a lattice model featuring two boundary conditions: one that encodes topological symmetry and another that governs non-topological dynamics. This cluster ladder model generalizes the well-known cluster state model. We demonstrate that the model exhibits weak Hopf symmetry, incorporating both the weak Hopf algebra and its dual. On a closed manifold, the symmetry reduces to cocommutative subalgebras of the weak Hopf algebra. Additionally, we introduce weak Hopf tensor network states to provide an exact solution for the model. As every fusion category corresponds to the representation category of some weak Hopf algebra, fusion category symmetry naturally corresponds to a subalgebra of the dual weak Hopf algebra. Consequently,the cluster ladder model offers a lattice realization of arbitrary fusion category symmetries.

Title: Spin Environment of a Superconducting Qubit in High Magnetic Fields
Authors: S. Günzler, J. Beck, D. Rieger, N. Gosling, N. Zapata, M. Field, S. Geisert, A. Bacher, J. K. Hohmann, M. Spiecker, W. Wernsdorfer, I. M. Pop
Abstract: Superconducting qubits equipped with quantum non-demolition readout and active feedback can be used as information engines to probe and manipulate microscopic degrees of freedom, whether intentionally designed or naturally occurring in their environment. In the case of spin systems, the required magnetic field bias presents a challenge for superconductors and Josephson junctions. Here we demonstrate a granular aluminum nanojunction fluxonium qubit (gralmonium) with spectrum and coherence resilient to fields beyond one Tesla. Sweeping the field reveals a paramagnetic spin-1/2 ensemble, which is the dominant gralmonium loss mechanism when the electron spin resonance matches the qubit. We also observe a suppression of MHz range fast flux noise in magnetic field, suggesting the freezing of surface spins. Using an active state stabilization sequence, the qubit hyperpolarizes long-lived two-level systems (TLSs) in its environment, previously speculated to be spins. Surprisingly, the coupling to these TLSs is unaffected by magnetic fields, leaving the question of their origin open. The robust operation of gralmoniums in Tesla fields offers new opportunities to explore unresolved questions in spin environment dynamics and facilitates hybrid architectures linking superconducting qubits with spin systems.

Title: Optimal spatial searches with long-range tunneling
Authors: Emma C. King, Moritz Linnebacher, Peter P. Orth, Matteo Rizzi, Giovanna Morigi
Abstract: A quantum walk on a lattice is a paradigm of a quantum search in a database. The database qubit strings are the lattice sites, qubit rotations are tunneling events, and the target site is tagged by an energy shift. For quantum walks on a continuous time, the walker diffuses across the lattice and the search ends when it localizes at the target site. The search time $T$ can exhibit Grover's optimal scaling with the lattice size $N$, namely, $T\sim \sqrt{N}$, on an all-connected, complete lattice. For finite-range tunneling between sites, instead, Grover's optimal scaling is warranted when the lattice is a hypercube of $d>4$ dimensions. Here, we show that Grover's optimum can be reached in lower dimensions on lattices of long-range interacting particles, when the interaction strength scales algebraically with the distance $r$ as $1/r^{\alpha}$ and $0<\alpha<3d/2$. For $\alpha<d$ the dynamics mimics the one of a globally connected graph. For $d<\alpha<d+2$, the quantum search on the graph can be mapped to a short-range model on a hypercube with spatial dimension $d_s=2d/(\alpha-d)$, indicating that the search is optimal for $d_s>4$. Our work identifies an exact relation between criticality of long-range and short-range systems, it provides a quantitative demonstration of the resources that long-range interactions provide for quantum technologies, and indicates when existing experimental platforms can implement efficient analog quantum search algorithms.

Title: Single-particle entanglement dynamics in complex systems
Authors: Devanshu Shekhar, Pragya Shukla
Abstract: We analyze the effect of varying system conditions on the single-particle entanglement entropy for an arbitrary eigenstate of a complex system that can be described by a multiparametric Gaussian ensemble. Our theoretical analysis leads to the identification of a single functional of the system parameters that governs the entropy dynamics. This reveals a sensitivity of the entropy to collective information content, characterized by the functional, instead of the individual system details. The functional can further be used to identify the universality classes as well as a deep web of connection underlying different quantum states.

Title: Fractional stochastic model of citation dynamics with memory and volatility
Authors: Keisuke Okamura
Abstract: Understanding the statistical laws governing citation dynamics remains a fundamental challenge in network theory and the science of science. Citation networks typically exhibit in-degree distributions well approximated by log-normal distributions yet also display power-law behaviour in the high-citation regime -- an apparent contradiction lacking a unified explanation. Here we identify a previously unrecognised phenomenon: the variance of the logarithm of citation counts per unit time follows a power law with respect to time ($t$) since publication, scaling as $t^{H}$, with $H$ constant. This discovery introduces a new challenge while simultaneously offering a crucial clue to resolving this discrepancy. We develop a stochastic model in which latent attention to publications evolves through a memory-driven process with cumulative advantage, modelled as fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter $H$ and volatility. We show that antipersistent fluctuations in attention ($H < 1/2$) yield log-normal citation distributions, whereas persistent attention dynamics ($H > 1/2$) favour heavy-tailed power laws, thus resolving the log-normal--power-law contradiction. Numerical simulations confirm both the $t^{H}$ law and the transition between regimes. Empirical analysis of arXiv e-prints indicates that the latent attention process is intrinsically antipersistent ($H \approx 0.13$). By linking memory effects and stochastic fluctuations in attention to broader network dynamics, our findings provide a unifying framework for understanding the evolution of collective attention in science and other attention-driven processes.

Title: Symmetry-Resolved Entanglement Entropy in Higher Dimensions
Authors: Yuanzhu Huang, Yang Zhou
Abstract: We present a method to compute the symmetry-resolved entanglement entropy of spherical regions in higher-dimensional conformal field theories. By employing Casini-Huerta-Myers mapping, we transform the entanglement problem into thermodynamic calculations in hyperbolic space. This method is demonstrated through computations in both free field theories and holographic field theories. For large hyperbolic space volume, our results reveal a universal expansion structure of symmetry-resolved entanglement entropy, with the equipartition property holding up to the constant order. Using asymptotic analysis techniques, we prove this expansion structure and the equipartition property in arbitrary dimensions.

Title: Overcoming light scattering with high optical nonlinearity
Authors: Pawel Szczypkowski, Adrian Makowski, Wojciech Zwoliński, Katarzyna Prorok, Piotr Wasylczyk, Artur Bednarkiewicz, Radek Lapkiewicz
Abstract: While scattered light conveys most of the information we perceive, scattering may also distort that information before it reaches our detectors. The problem is acute in many applications, such as in high-resolution microscopy of biological tissue, where scattering degrades both resolution and signal-to-noise ratio. Here, for the first time, we demonstrate that uniting two intrinsic properties of scattered light: speckle statistics and the angular memory effect, with highly non-linear optical response yields, rather surprisingly, super-resolution, low-background, non-invasive imaging of objects completely hidden behind a strongly scattering, opaque layer. Crucially, our technique of non-invasive imaging through scatterers does not resort to wavefront shaping, adaptive optics, complicated optical setups, or iterative image reconstruction algorithms. Because the strategy relies solely on the properties of scattered light and high-order nonlinear response of the fluorophores, it can be applied to any speckle-forming propagation, from biological tissue to multicore fibres, combined with any type of phenomenon that exhibits a sufficiently high order nonlinearity.

Title: Emergent photons and mechanisms of confinement
Authors: Jeffrey Giansiracusa, David Lanners, Tin Sulejmanpasic
Abstract: We numerically study $\mathbb{Z}_N$ lattice gauge theories in 4D as prototypical models of systems with $\mathbb{Z}_N$ 1-$\textit{form symmetry}$. For $N \geq 3$, we provide evidence that such systems exhibit not only the expected phases with spontaneously broken/restored symmetry but also a third photon phase. When present, the 1-form symmetry provides a precise notion of confinement, and it is commonly believed that confinement ensues due to the proliferation of extended, string-like objects known as $\textit{center vortices}$, which carry a $\mathbb{Z}_N$ flux. However, this picture is challenged by the three-phase scenario investigated here. We show that both the confined and the photon phases are associated with the proliferation of center vortices and that the key difference between them lies in whether or not vortex-junctions - the $\textit{monopoles}$ - proliferate.

Title: Amplitude equations of associative memory patterns in spatially distributed systems
Authors: Akke Mats Houben
Abstract: Evolution equations of the amplitudes of heterogeneous states (associative memories) stored in the connectivity of distributed systems with non-local interactions are derived. The resulting system of coupled amplitude equations describes the spatio-temporal dynamics of memory recall. It is shown that these types of distributed systems perform pattern completion and selection, and that short-range connections afford spatio-temporal memory pattern dynamics taking the form of patterning fronts.

Title: Computing excited eigenstates using inexact Lanczos methods and tree tensor network states
Authors: Madhumita Rano, Henrik R. Larsson
Abstract: To understand the dynamics of quantum many-body systems, it is essential to study excited eigenstates. While tensor network states have become a standard tool for computing ground states in computational many-body physics, obtaining accurate excited eigenstates remains a significant challenge. In this work, we develop an approach that combines the inexact Lanczos method, which is designed for efficient computations of excited states, with tree tensor network states (TTNSs). We demonstrate our approach by computing excited vibrational states for three challenging problems: (1) 122 states in two different energy intervals of acetonitrile (12-dimensional), (2) Fermi resonance states of the fluxional Zundel ion (15-dimensional),and (3) selected excited states of the fluxional and very correlated Eigen ion (33-dimensional). The proposed TTNS inexact Lanczos method is directly applicable to other quantum many-body systems.

Title: Elastohydrodynamics of 3D chemically active filaments
Authors: Matthew D Butler, Benjamin J Walker, Thomas Montenegro-Johnson, Panayiota Katsamba
Abstract: Active deformable filaments exhibit a large range of qualitatively different three-dimensional dynamics, depending on their flexibility, the strength and nature of the active forcing, and the surrounding environment. We investigate the dynamic behaviour of elastic, chemically propelled phoretic filaments, combining two existing models; a local version of slender phoretic theory, which determines the resulting slip flows for chemically propelled filaments with a given shape and chemical patterning, is paired with a computationally efficient method for capturing the elastohydrodynamics of a deformable filament in viscous flow to study the chemoelastohydrodynamics of filaments. As the activity increases, or equivalently the filament stiffness decreases, these filaments undergo buckling instabilities that alter their behaviour from rigid rods. We follow their behaviour well beyond the buckling threshold to find a rich array of dynamics. Through two illustrative examples, we conduct initial-value simulations that show that, as the stiffness of the filament is decreased, the dynamic behaviour moves from rigid motion to planar buckling, through an out-of-plane transition, eventually reaching diffusive-like behaviours for very deformable filaments.

Title: What is emergence, after all?
Authors: Abbas K. Rizi
Abstract: The term emergence is increasingly used across scientific disciplines to describe phenomena that arise from interactions among a system's components but cannot be readily inferred by examining those components in isolation. While often invoked to explain higher-level behaviors, such as flocking, synchronization, or collective intelligence, the term is frequently used without precision, sometimes giving rise to ambiguity or even mystique. In this perspective paper, we clarify the scientific meaning of emergence as a measurable and physically grounded phenomenon. Through concrete examples, such as temperature, magnetism, and herd immunity in social networks, we review how collective behavior can arise from local interactions that are constrained by global boundaries. By refining the concept of emergence, we gain a clearer and more grounded understanding of complex systems. Our goal is to show that emergence, when properly framed, offers not mysticism but insight.

Title: The Impact of Social Attractiveness on Casual Group Formation: Power-Law Group Sizes and Suppressed Percolation
Authors: Matheus S. Mariano, José F. Fontanari
Abstract: The dynamics of casual group formation has long been a subject of interest in social sciences. While early stochastic models offered foundational insights into group size distributions, they often simplified individual behaviors and lacked mechanisms for heterogeneous social appeal. Here, we re-examine the attractiveness-driven interaction model, an agent-based framework where point-like agents move randomly in a 2D arena and exhibit varied social appeal, leading them to pause near highly attractive celebrity peers. We compare this model to a null model where the agents are continuously in movement, which resembles a Random Geometric Graph. Our extensive simulations reveal significant structural and dynamic differences: unlike the null model, the attractiveness-driven model's average degree increases linearly with system size for fixed density, resulting in more compact groups and the suppression of a percolation transition. Crucially, while the null model's group size distribution is either exponentially decaying or bimodal, the attractiveness-driven model robustly exhibits a power-law distribution, $P(n) \propto n^{-2.5}$, with an exponent independent of density. These findings, obtained through computationally intensive simulations due to long equilibration times, offer a thorough quantitative characterization of this model, highlighting the critical role of individual attractiveness in shaping social aggregation in physical space.

Title: Free Independence and Unitary Design from Random Matrix Product Unitaries
Authors: Neil Dowling, Jacopo De Nardis, Markus Heinrich, Xhek Turkeshi, Silvia Pappalardi
Abstract: Unitary randomness underpins both fundamental tasks in quantum information and the modern theory of quantum chaos. On one side, a central concept is that of approximate unitary designs: circuits that look random according to small moments and for forward-in-time protocols. In a distinct setting, out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs), intensely studied as a measure of information scrambling, have recently been shown to probe freeness between Heisenberg operators, the noncommutative generalization of statistical independence. Bridging these two concepts, we study the emergence of freeness in a random matrix product unitary ensemble. We prove that, with only polynomial bond dimension, these unitaries reproduce Haar values of higher-order OTOCs for local, finite-trace observables, while traceless observables instead require exponential resources. Indeed, local observables are precisely those predicted to thermalize in chaotic many-body systems according to the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. Moreover, adding to previous literature, we show how random matrix product unitaries constitute approximate designs: we exactly compute the frame potential of the ensemble, showing convergence to the Haar value with polynomial deviations and so indicating that global observables are freely independent on-average. Our results highlight the need to refine previous notions of unitary design in the context of operator dynamics, guiding us towards protocols for quantum advantage and shedding light on the emergent complexity of chaotic many-body systems.

Title: Extending fusion rules with finite subgroups: For a general understanding of quotient or gauging
Authors: Yoshiki Fukusumi, Shinichiro Yahagi
Abstract: We introduce a general method for realizing simple current extensions of the conformal field theories. We systematically obtain the $Z_{N}$ symmetry extended fusion ring of bulk and chiral theories and the corresponding modular partition functions with nonanomalous subgroup $Z_{n}(\subset Z_{N})$. The bulk (or nonchiral) fusion ring provides fundamental algebraic data for conformal bootstrap, and the chiral fusion ring provides fundamental data for the graded symmetry topological field theories. The latter also provides algebraic data of smeared boundary conformal field theories describing zero modes of the extended models. For more general multicomponent or coupled systems, we also obtain a new series of extended theories. By applying the folding trick to the resultant coupled theories, their partition functions correspond to charged or gapped domain walls or massless renormalization group flows preserving quotient group structures. This work opens new research directions in studying the classification of conformal field theories and the corresponding topological quantum field theories (or topological orders) by establishing the traditional methods in abstract algebra and modular form.

Title: Breakdown of the Kirchhoff's law of thermal radiation by a spatiotemporally modulated nonreciprocal metasurface
Authors: Anatoly Efimov, Chun-Chieh Chang, Simo Pajovic, Wilton J.M. Kort-Kamp, Dongsung Kim, Hou-Tong Chen, Diego A. R. Dalvit, Abul K. Azad
Abstract: Kirchhoff's law of thermal radiation, which dictates that the emissivity of a surface equals its absorptivity under thermal equilibrium, which dictates that the emissivity of a surface equals its absorptivity under thermal equilibrium, fundamentally limits the efficiency of photonic systems by enforcing reciprocal energy exchange between source and detector. Breaking this reciprocity is particularly important for advancing photonic devices for energy conversion, radiative cooling, and mid-infrared sensing and imaging. Driven by the growing need for photonic platforms to overcome reciprocity constraints, we present the first demonstration of spatiotemporally modulated nonreciprocal metasurfaces operating at mid-infrared frequencies suitable for the violation of the Kirchhoff's law at room temperature. We fabricate a graphene-based integrated photonic structure and experimentally demonstrate nonreciprocal reflection from a metasurface modulated at gigahertz frequencies. We develop a theoretical framework to relate nonreciprocal scattering under spatiotemporal modulation with unequal absorptivity and emissivity for violation of the spectral directional Kirchhoff's law. Our experiment and theory imply effective decoupling of absorption and emission channels by breaking time-reversal symmetry at thermal wavelengths.

Title: A dynamical approach to studying the Lee-Yang zeros for the Potts Model on the Cayley Tree
Authors: Diyath Pannipitiya, Roland Roeder
Abstract: Let $Z_n(z,t)$ denote the partition function of the $q$-state Potts Model on the rooted binary Cayley tree of depth~$n$. Here, $z = {\rm e}^{-h/T}$ and $t = {\rm e}^{-J/T}$ with $h$ denoting an externally applied magnetic field, $T$ the temperature, and $J$ a coupling constant. One can interpret $z$ as a ``magnetic field-like'' variable and $t$ as a ``temperature-like'' variable. Physical values $h \in \mathbb{R}$, $T > 0$, and $J \in \mathbb{R}$ correspond to $t \in (0,\infty)$ and $z \in (0,\infty)$. For any fixed $t_0 \in (0,\infty)$ and fixed $n \in \mathbb{N}$ we consider the complex zeros of $Z_n(z,t_0)$ and how they accumulate on the ray $(0,\infty)$ of physical values for $z$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$. In the ferromagnetic case ($J > 0$ or equivalently $t \in (0,1)$) these Lee-Yang zeros accumulate to at most one point on $(0,\infty)$ which we describe using explicit formulae. In the antiferromagnetic case $(J < 0$ or equivalently $t \in (1,\infty)$) these Lee-Yang zeros accumulate to finitely many points of $(0,\infty)$, which we again describe with explicit formulae. The same results hold for the unrooted Cayley tree of branching number two. These results are proved by adapting a renormalization procedure that was previously used in the case of the Ising model on the Cayley Tree by Müller-Hartmann and Zittartz (1974 and 1977), Barata and Marchetti (1997), and Barata and Goldbaum (2001). We then use methods from complex dynamics and, more specifically, the active/passive dichotomy for iteration of a marked point, along with detailed analysis of the renormalization mappings, to prove the main results.

Title: Generalized Symmetries and Deformations of Symmetric Product Orbifolds
Authors: Nathan Benjamin, Suzanne Bintanja, Yu-Jui Chen, Michael Gutperle, Conghuan Luo, Dikshant Rathore
Abstract: We construct generalized symmetries in two-dimensional symmetric product orbifold CFTs $\text{Sym}^N(\mathcal{T}),$ for a generic seed CFT $\mathcal{T}$. These symmetries are more general than the universal and maximally symmetric ones previously constructed. We show that, up to one fine-tuned example when the number of copies $N$ equals four, the only symmetries that can be preserved under twisted sector marginal deformations are invertible and maximally symmetric. The results are obtained in two ways. First, using the mathematical machinery of $G$-equivariantization of fusion categories, and second, via the projector construction of topological defect lines. As an application, we classify all preserved symmetries in symmetric product orbifold CFTs with the seed CFT given by any $A$-series $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ minimal model. We comment on the implications of our results for holography.

Title: High harmonic generation from a Bose-Einstein condensate
Authors: Philipp Stammer
Abstract: Lasers provide intense coherent radiation, essential to cool and trap atoms into a Bose-Einstein condensate or can alternatively drive the non-linear dynamics of high-order harmonic generation. Yet, these two fundamental processes remained of independent consideration. Here, we connect matter waves at ultracold temperatures with radiation bursts on the ultrafast attosecond timescale. We do this by exploring high harmonic generation from a Bose-Einstein condensate. We show that the quantum state of the generated harmonics of a driven Bose gas is a classical mixture, while below the critical temperature of Bose-Einstein condensation the emitted harmonic radiation is in a pure quantum state. These states furthermore exhibit squeezing and entanglement across all field modes.

Title: Coordination Requires Simplification: Thermodynamic Bounds on Multi-Objective Compromise in Natural and Artificial Intelligence
Authors: Atma Anand
Abstract: Information-processing systems coordinating across multiple agents and objectives face fundamental thermodynamic constraints. We show that solutions with maximum utility to act as coordination focal points have much higher selection pressure for being findable across agents rather than accuracy. We derive that the information-theoretic minimum description length of coordination protocols to precision $\varepsilon$ scales as $L(P)\geq NK\log_2 K+N^2d^2\log (1/\varepsilon)$ for $N$ agents with $d$ potentially conflicting objectives and internal model complexity $K$. This scaling forces progressive simplification, with coordination dynamics changing the environment itself and shifting optimization across hierarchical levels. Moving from established focal points requires re-coordination, creating persistent metastable states and hysteresis until significant environmental shifts trigger phase transitions through spontaneous symmetry breaking. We operationally define coordination temperature to predict critical phenomena and estimate coordination work costs, identifying measurable signatures across systems from neural networks to restaurant bills to bureaucracies. Extending the topological version of Arrow's theorem on the impossibility of consistent preference aggregation, we find it recursively binds whenever preferences are combined. This potentially explains the indefinite cycling in multi-objective gradient descent and alignment faking in Large Language Models trained with reinforcement learning with human feedback. We term this framework Thermodynamic Coordination Theory (TCT), which demonstrates that coordination requires radical information loss.

Title: Higher symmetry breaking and non-reciprocity in a driven-dissipative Dicke model
Authors: Jacquelyn Ho, Yue-Hui Lu, Tai Xiang, Tsai-Chen Lee, Zhenjie Yan, Dan M. Stamper-Kurn
Abstract: Higher symmetries in interacting many-body systems often give rise to new phases and unexpected dynamical behavior. Here, we theoretically investigate a variant of the Dicke model with higher-order discrete symmetry, resulting from complex-valued coupling coefficients between quantum emitters and a bosonic mode. We propose a driven-dissipative realization of this model focusing on optomechanical response of a driven atom tweezer array comprised of $n$ sub-ensembles and placed within an optical cavity, with the phase of the driving field advancing stepwise between sub-ensembles. Examining stationary points and their dynamical stability, we identify a phase diagram for $n\geq 3$ with three distinctive features: a $\mathbb{Z}_n$ ($\mathbb{Z}_{2n}$) symmetry-breaking superradiant phase for even (odd) $n$, a normal unbroken-symmetry phase that is dynamically unstable due to non-reciprocal forces between emitters, and a first-order phase transition separating these phases. This $n$-phase Dicke model may be equivalently realized in a variety of optomechanical or opto-magnonic settings, where it can serve as a testbed for studying high-order symmetry breaking and non-reciprocal interactions in open systems.

Title: Local active error correction from simulated confinement
Authors: Ethan Lake
Abstract: We refine an old idea for performing fault-tolerant error correction in topological codes by simulating confining interactions between excitations. We implement confinement using an array of local classical processors that measure syndromes, broadcast messages to neighboring processors, and move excitations using received messages. The dynamics of the resulting real-time decoder is geometrically local, homogeneous in spacetime, and self-organized, operating without any form of global control. We prove that below a threshold error rate, it achieves a memory lifetime scaling as a stretched exponential in the linear system size $L$, provided that it has access to $O({\rm polylog}(L))$ noiseless classical bits for each noisy qubit. When applied to the surface code subject to depolarizing noise and measurement errors of equal strength, numerics indicate a threshold at $p_c \approx 1.5\%$.
