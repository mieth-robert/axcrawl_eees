Title: Designing lattice spin models and magnon gaps with supercurrents
Authors: Johanne Bratland Tjernshaugen, Martin Tang Bruland, Jacob Linder
Abstract: Controlling magnetic interactions at the level of individual spins is relevant for a variety of quantum applications, such as qubits, memory and sensor functionality. Finding ways to exert electrical control over spin interactions, with minimal energy dissipation, is a key objective in this endeavour. We show here that spin lattices and magnon gaps can be controlled with a supercurrent. Remarkably, a spin-polarized supercurrent makes the interaction between magnetic adatoms placed on the surface of a superconductor depend not only on their relative distance, but also on their absolute position in space. This property permits electric control over the interaction not only between two individual spins, but in fact over an entire spin lattice, allowing for non-collinear ground states and a practical arena to study the properties of different spin Hamiltonians. Moreover, we show that a supercurrent controls the magnon gap in antiferromagnetic and altermagnetic insulators. These results provide an accessible way to realize electrically controlled spin switching and magnon gaps without dissipative currents.

Title: Nesting-driven ferromagnetism of itinerant electrons
Authors: Ya.I. Rodionov, A.V. Rozhkov, M.E.S. Beck, A.O. Sboychakov, K.I. Kugel, A.L. Rakhmanov
Abstract: We theoretically investigate a model with electrons and holes whose Fermi surfaces are perfectly nested. The fermions are assumed to be interacting, both with each other and with the lattice. To suppress inhomogeneous states, a sufficiently strong long-range Coulomb repulsion is included into the model. Using the mean field approximation, one can demonstrate that in the absence of doping, the ground state of such a model is insulating and possesses a density-wave order, either SDW, or CDW. Upon doping, a finite ferromagnetic polarization emerges. It is argued that the mechanism driving the ferromagnetism is not of the Stoner type. A phase diagram of the model is constructed, and various properties of the ordered phases are studied.

Title: Higher-Order Fermion Interactions in BCS Theory
Authors: Diego Rodriguez-Gomez, Jorge G. Russo
Abstract: We investigate the impact of higher-order fermionic deformations in multiflavor Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory. Focusing specifically on the 6- and 8-fermion interactions, we show that these terms can have significant consequences on the dynamics of the system. In certain regions of parameter space, the theory continues to exhibit second-order phase transitions with mean-field critical exponents and the same critical temperature; however, the temperature dependence of the superconducting gap can deviate markedly from conventional BCS behavior. In other regions, the theory exhibits first-order phase transitions or second-order phase transitions with non-mean field exponents. We conclude by discussing potential phenomenological applications of these theories.

Title: Dynamic competition between phason and amplitudon observed by ultrafast multimodal scanning tunneling microscopy
Authors: Seokjin Bae, Arjun Raghavan, Kejian Qu, Chengxi Zhao, Daniel P. Shoemaker, Fahad Mahmood, Ziqiang Wang, Barry Bradlyn, Vidya Madhavan
Abstract: The intertwining between two ordered states that arise from the same interactions is reflected in the dynamics of their coupled collective excitations. While the equilibrium phase diagram resulting from such intertwined orders has been extensively studied, the dynamic competition between non-equilibrium modes is a largely unexplored territory. Here, we introduce a novel multimodal STM-based pump-probe technique, which enables the measurement of time-resolved tunneling (trSTM), time-resolved point-contact (trPC), and optical pump-probe reflectance (OPPR) on femtosecond timescales-all within a single instrument. We apply these techniques to investigate the collective excitations of the unconventional charge density wave insulator (TaSe4)2I. Our trSTM and trPC measurements reveal charge oscillations at 0.22 THz, with a temperature dependence that matches the theoretically predicted behavior of the long-sought massive phason gaining mass through the Higgs mechanism. Unexpectedly, the data also reveals a second mode at 0.11 THz exhibiting similar temperature and polarization dependence with comparable mode intensity. These features, along with the robust 1/2 frequency ratio locking suggest that the 0.11 THz phason is a 'daughter mode' that arises from the splitting of the 0.22 THz massive phason into two massless phasons via parametric amplification-analogous to the decay of a neutral pion into two photons. Strikingly, comparison with OPPR data reveals that the daughter phason competes with and suppresses the amplitudon at the same frequency. Our studies reveal an unexplored mechanism for the generation and extinction of collective excitations and pave the way for a microscopic understanding of ultrafast phenomena.

Title: ν-QSSEP: A toy model for entanglement spreading in stochastic diffusive quantum systems
Authors: Vincenzo Alba
Abstract: We investigate out-of-equilibrium entanglement dynamics in a generalization of the so-called $QSSEP$ model, which is a free-fermion chain with stochastic in space and time hopping amplitudes. In our setup, the noisy amplitudes are spatially-modulated satisfying a $\nu$-site translation invariance but retaining their randomness in time. For each noise realization, the dynamics preserves Gaussianity, which allows to obtain noise-averaged entanglement-related quantities. The statistics of the steady-state correlators satisfy nontrivial relationships that are of topological nature. They reflect the Haar invariance under multiplication with structured momentum-dependent random $SU(\nu)$ matrices. We discuss in detail the case with $\nu=1$ and $\nu=2$. For $\nu=1$, i.e., spatially homogeneous noise we show that the entanglement dynamics is describable by a stochastic generalization of the quasiparticle picture. Precisely, entanglement is propagated by pairs of quasiparticles. The entanglement content of the pairs is the same as for the deterministic chain. However, the trajectories of the quasiparticles are random walks, giving rise to diffusive entanglement growth.

Title: Multichannel topological Kondo models and their low-temperature conductances
Authors: Guangjie Li, Elio J. König, Jukka I. Väyrynen
Abstract: In the multichannel Kondo effect, overscreening of a magnetic impurity by conduction electrons leads to a frustrated exotic ground state. It has been proposed that multichannel topological Kondo (MCTK) model involving topological Cooper pair boxes with $M$ Majorana modes [SO($M$) "spin"] and $N$ spinless electron channels exhibits an exotic intermediate coupling fixed point. This intermediate fixed point has been analyzed through large-$N$ perturbative calculations, which gives a zero-temperature conductance decaying as $1/N^2$ in the large-$N$ limit. However, the conductance at this intermediate fixed point has not been calculated for generic $N$. Using representation theory, we verify the existence of this intermediate-coupling fixed point and find the strong-coupling effective Hamiltonian for the case $M=4$. Using conformal field theory techniques for SO($M$), we generalize the notion of overscreening and conclude that the MCTK model is an overscreened Kondo model. We find the fixed-point finite-size energy spectrum and the leading irrelevant operator (LIO). We express the fixed-point conductance in terms of the modular S-matrix of SO($M$) for general $N$, confirming the previous large-$N$ result. We describe the finite-temperature corrections to the conductance by the LIO and find that they are qualitatively different for the cases $N=1$ and $N\geq2$ due to the different fusion outcomes with the current operator. We also compare the multichannel topological Kondo model to the topological symplectic Kondo model.

Title: Impacts and Ejecta in Natural Granular Material
Authors: Esteban Wright, Emau Argueta, Wolfgang Losert
Abstract: With laboratory experiments we investigate the ejecta of low-velocity (~m/s) impacts into multi-scale granular media and compare them against ejecta from impacts into mono-scale media. Impacts are into a 50 cm diameter galvanized washtub filled with fine sand that has larger diameter gravel buried below the surface is filmed with two high-speed cameras. The resulting ejecta curtain consists mainly of fine sand, and has a complex asymmetric structure that depends on the location and interaction of the ejecta with the larger gravel grains mixed into the sand. To characterize the highly heterogeneous ejecta curtain we combine three analysis techniques: Particle tracking measures the ejecta velocities and ejecta angles best in low density regions, while particle image velocimetry (PIV) elucidates average motion in dense regions, and histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) which captures directions of motion against a patterned background. We find significant asymmetries in the multi-scale ejecta's velocity distributions and ejection angles compared to the symmetry seen in the ejecta from impacts into mono-scale media. Our experiments show that larger grains under the surface impede and direct ejecta along preferential paths during the impact process.

Title: Electron and phonon topology in transition metal material TaSi
Authors: Saurabh Kumar Sen, Shivendra Kumar Gupta, Nagarjuna Patra, Ajit Singh Jhala, Poorva Singh
Abstract: The plethora of multifold quasiparticles in topological materials has led to significant advancements in condensed matter physics, inspiring the investigation for materials that host both electronic and bosonic multifold excitations. In this work, we explore the electronic and phononic properties of TaSi, a non symmorphic chiral topological material crystallizing in space group P 2 1 3 (No. 198). This system exhibits multifold fermions, which are higher spin generalizations of Weyl fermions, protected by the unique crystalline symmetries of the structure. Using first principles calculations, we predict that electronic band possesses fourfold spin 3/2 Rarita Schwinger (RSW) fermions, sixfold excitations (double spin 1), all possessing large Chern numbers C = +4 and Weyl fermions of spin 1/2 with Chern no. -1 in the presence of spin orbit coupling (SOC). Additionally, the phononic band structure hosts chiral bosonic excitations characterized by Chern numbers C = +-2. The coexistence of chiral electronic and bosonic quasiparticles give rise to exotic transport phenomena, rendering the material as promising candidate for future applications in quantum materials, topological electronics, and spintronics.

Title: Beyond ensemble averaging: Parallelized single-shot readout of hole capture in diamond
Authors: Richard Monge, Yuki Nakamura, Olaf Bach, Jason Shao, Artur Lozovoi, Alexander A. Wood, Kento Sasaki, Kensuke Kobayashi, Tom Delord, Carlos A. Meriles
Abstract: Understanding the generation, transport and capture of charge carriers in semiconductors is of fundamental technological importance. However, the ensemble measurement techniques ubiquitous in electronics offer limited insight into the nanoscale environment that is crucial to the operation of modern quantum-electronic devices. Here, we combine widefield optical microscopy with precision spectroscopy to examine the capture of photogenerated holes by negatively charged nitrogen vacancy (NV-) centers in diamond. Simultaneous single-shot charge readout over hundreds of individual NVs allows us to resolve the roles of ionized impurities, reveal the formation of space charges fields, and monitor the thermalization of hot photo-carriers during diffusion. We measure effective NV- hole capture radii in excess of 0.2 um, a value approaching the Onsager limit and made possible here thanks to the near-complete neutralization of coexisting charge traps. These results establish a new platform for resolving charge dynamics beyond ensemble averages, with direct relevance to nanoscale electronics and quantum devices.

Title: High-throughput computational framework for lattice dynamics and thermal transport including high-order anharmonicity: an application to cubic and tetragonal inorganic compounds
Authors: Zhi Li, Huiju Lee, Chris Wolverton, Yi Xia
Abstract: Accurately predicting lattice thermal conductivity (kL) from first principles remains a challenge in identifying materials with extreme thermal behavior. While modern lattice dynamics methods enable routine predictions of kL within the harmonic approximation and three-phonon scattering framework (HA+3ph), reliable results, especially for low-kL compounds, require higher-order anharmonic effects, including self-consistent phonon renormalization, four-phonon scattering, and off-diagonal heat flux (SCPH+3,4ph+OD). We present a high-throughput workflow integrating these effects into a unified framework. Using this, we compute kL for 773 cubic and tetragonal inorganic compounds across diverse chemistries and structures. From 562 dynamically stable compounds, we assess the hierarchical effects of higher-order anharmonicity. For about 60% of materials, HA+3ph predictions closely match those from SCPH+3,4ph+OD. However, SCPH corrections often increase kL, sometimes by over 8 times, while four-phonon scattering universally reduces it, occasionally to 15% of the HA+3ph value. Off-diagonal contributions are minor in high-kL systems but can exceed 50% of total kL in highly anharmonic, low-kL compounds. We highlight four cases-Rb2TlAlH6, Cu3VS4, CuBr, and Cl2O-exhibiting distinct anharmonic behaviors. This work delivers not only a robust workflow for high-fidelity kL dataset but also a quantitative framework to determine when higher-order effects are essential. The hierarchy of kL results, from the HA+3ph to SCPH+3,4ph+OD level, offers a scalable, interpretable route to discovering next-generation extreme thermal materials.

Title: A Proliferating Nematic That Collectively Senses an Anisotropic Substrate
Authors: Toshi Parmar, Fridtjof Brauns, Yimin Luo, M. Cristina Marchetti
Abstract: Motivated by recent experiments on growing fibroblasts, we examine the development of nematic order in a colony of elongated cells proliferating on a nematic elastomer substrate. After sparse seeding, the cells divide and grow into locally ordered, but randomly oriented, domains that then interact with each other and the substrate. Global alignment with the substrate is only achieved above a critical density, suggesting a collective mechanism for the sensing of substrate anisotropy. The system jams at high density, where both reorientation and proliferation stop. Using a continuum model of a proliferating nematic liquid crystal, we examine the competition between growth-driven alignment and substrate-driven alignment in controlling the density and structure of the final jammed state. We propose that anisotropic traction forces and the tendency of cells to align perpendicular to the direction of density gradients act in concert to provide a mechanism for collective cell alignment.

Title: Intermediate scattering function of colloids in a periodic laser field
Authors: Regina Rusch, Yasamin Mohebi Satalsari, Angel B. Zuccolotto-Bernez, Manuel A. Escobedo-Sanchez, Thomas Franosch
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of individual colloidal particles in a one-dimensional periodic potential using the intermediate scattering function (ISF) as a key observable. We elaborate a theoretical framework and derive formally exact analytical expressions for the ISF. We introduce and analyze a generalized ISF with two wave vectors to capture correlations in a periodic potential beyond the standard ISF. Relying on Bloch's theorem for periodic systems and, by solving the Smoluchowski equation for an overdamped Brownian particle in a cosine potential, we evaluate the ISF by numerically solving for the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the expression. We apply time-dependent perturbation theory to expand the ISF and extract low-order moments, including the mean-square displacement, the time-dependent diffusivity, and the non-Gaussian parameter. Our analytical results are validated through Brownian-dynamics simulations and experiments on 2D colloidal systems exposed to a light-induced periodic potential generated by two interacting laser beams.

Title: Conformable Scaling and Critical Dynamics: A Unified Framework for Phase Transitions
Authors: José Weberszpil
Abstract: We investigate the application of conformable derivatives to model critical phenomena near continuous phase transitions. By incorporating a deformation parameter into the differential structure, we derive unified expressions for thermodynamic observables such as heat capacity, magnetization, susceptibility, and coherence length, each exhibiting power-law behavior near the critical temperature. The conformable derivative framework naturally embeds scale invariance and critical slowing down into the dynamics without resorting to fully nonlocal fractional calculus. Modified Ginzburg-Landau equations are constructed to model superconducting transitions, leading to analytical expressions for the order parameter and London penetration depth. Experimental data from niobium confirm the model's applicability, showing excellent fits and capturing asymmetric scaling behavior around Tc. This work offers a bridge between classical mean-field theory and generalized scaling frameworks, with implications for both theoretical modeling and experimental analysis.

Title: Quantum oscillations reveal sixfold fermions in cubic $β$-PtBi$_2$
Authors: E. F. Bavaro, J. Castro, V. Vildosola, J. I. Facio, V. F. Correa
Abstract: We report a study of de Haas-van Alphen oscillations in high-quality single crystals of cubic $\beta$-PtBi$_2$. In combination with density functional theory calculations, we identify quantum oscillations associated with all Fermi surface sheets predicted by theory. Our results uncover three small electron pockets centered on a sixfold band-touching point located approximately 25 meV below the Fermi level at the $R$ point of the Brillouin zone. These findings firmly establish the presence of sixfold fermions in close proximity to the Fermi energy of $\beta$-PtBi$_2$.

Title: MOFSimBench: Evaluating Universal Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials In Metal--Organic Framework Molecular Modeling
Authors: Hendrik Kraß, Ju Huang, Seyed Mohamad Moosavi
Abstract: Universal machine learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs) have emerged as powerful tools for accelerating atomistic simulations, offering scalable and efficient modeling with accuracy close to quantum calculations. However, their reliability and effectiveness in practical, real-world applications remain an open question. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and related nanoporous materials are highly porous crystals with critical relevance in carbon capture, energy storage, and catalysis applications. Modeling nanoporous materials presents distinct challenges for uMLIPs due to their diverse chemistry, structural complexity, including porosity and coordination bonds, and the absence from existing training datasets. Here, we introduce MOFSimBench, a benchmark to evaluate uMLIPs on key materials modeling tasks for nanoporous materials, including structural optimization, molecular dynamics (MD) stability, the prediction of bulk properties, such as bulk modulus and heat capacity, and guest-host interactions. Evaluating over 20 models from various architectures on a chemically and structurally diverse materials set, we find that top-performing uMLIPs consistently outperform classical force fields and fine-tuned machine learning potentials across all tasks, demonstrating their readiness for deployment in nanoporous materials modeling. Our analysis highlights that data quality, particularly the diversity of training sets and inclusion of out-of-equilibrium conformations, plays a more critical role than model architecture in determining performance across all evaluated uMLIPs. We release our modular and extendable benchmarking framework at this https URL, providing an open resource to guide the adoption for nanoporous materials modeling and further development of uMLIPs.

Title: Fractal Path Strategies for Efficient 2D DMRG Simulations
Authors: Oliver R. Bellwood, Heitor P. Casagrande, William J. Munro
Abstract: Numerical simulations of quantum magnetism in two spatial dimensions are often constrained by the area law of entanglement entropy, which heavily limits the accessible system sizes in tensor network methods. In this work, we investigate how the choice of mapping from a two-dimensional lattice to a one-dimensional path affects the accuracy of the two-dimensional Density Matrix Renormalization Group algorithm. We systematically evaluate all mappings corresponding to a subset of the Hamiltonian paths of the $N \cross N$ grid graphs up to $N=8$ and demonstrate that the fractal space-filling curves generally lead to faster convergence in ground state searches compared to the commonly used ``snake" path. To explain this performance gain, we analyze various locality metrics and propose a scalable method for constructing high-performing paths on larger lattices by tiling smaller optimal paths. Our results show that such paths consistently improve simulation convergence, with the advantage increasing with system size.

Title: Suppression of charge-density wave and superconductivity in a lithiated NbSe$_2$ monolayer
Authors: Hari Paudyal, Michael E. Flatté
Abstract: We present an \textit{ab initio} investigation of the long-range charge density wave (CDW) order and superconducting properties of the pristine and lithiated NbSe$_2$ monolayer. Stable CDW structures are obtained through atomic reconstruction driven by soft-mode distortions and lithiation, respectively, lead to significant electronic modifications that suppress the CDW order. This suppression is attributed to anisotropic atomic distortions, along with a reduction in the electronic density of states at the Fermi level. As a result, the electron--phonon coupling strength is suppressed, particularly in the lithiated structure, due to reduced contributions from low-frequency phonons, primarily associated with in-plane Nb vibrations. Finally, we observe a sizable anisotropy in the superconducting gap on the Fermi surface, with a superconducting transition temperature of approximately 8~K in the distorted, and 4~K in the lithiated, CDW NbSe$_2$ monolayer.

Title: Thermodynamic stabilization and electronic effects of oxygen vacancies at BiFeO$_3$ neutral ferroelectric domain walls
Authors: Guo-Dong Zhao, Ismaila Dabo, Long-Qing Chen
Abstract: Enhanced conductivity at ferroelectric domain walls in BiFeO$_3$ has been widely observed, yet the microscopic origins of this effect, including electronic contributions from domain-wall defects, are incompletely understood at the atomistic level. Here, we carry out first-principles simulations to quantify the thermodynamic stability and electronic impact of oxygen vacancies at charge-neutral 71$^\circ$, 109$^\circ$, and 180$^\circ$ domain walls of BiFeO$_3$. We find that vacancies are energetically favored at domain walls by up to 0.3 eV compared to the bulk, leading to orders-of-magnitude increase in vacancy equilibrium concentration. The corresponding formation energy landscapes are discontinued and explained by local bond weakening. The vacancies induce localized electronic intragap states corresponding to small polarons, which promote thermally activated n-type conduction in the low-current regime, and their tendency to aggregate facilitate Schottky emission in the high-current regime. Our results provide a quantitative foundation for interpreting domain-wall conduction, offer guidance for defect engineering in ferroelectrics, and provide important information to phase-field simulations of defect-domain wall interactions in a ferroelectric domain structure.

Title: Bose-Hubbard model in the presence of artificial magnetic fields: Ground state and thermal phase diagrams
Authors: Mohammadamin Jaberi, Fatemeh Heydarinasab
Abstract: We consider effects of artificial magnetic fields on the ground state of the two-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model. Using an asymmetric Bose-Hubbard model, we demonstrate that the frustrating hopping energy localizes bosons and enlarges insulators and supersolid borders. We show these increments in the presence of artificial gauge fields up to a symmetric point of the field. Moreover, our calculations exhibit the real space modulations of the superfluid and supersolid phases. The bosonic current exhibits vortices in these phases, which their configurations depend on the commensuration between the magnetic field and the lattice. Although the magnetic field breaks the translational symmetry of the square lattice explicitly, this symmetry is restored in the Mott insulator phase. The filling factor exhibits a checkerboard pattern in the density-wave and supersolid phases, regardless of the magnetic field strength. We explore thermal fluctuations and demonstrate the robustness of insulators and SS phases up to temperatures comparable to the interaction energy, which support the feasibility of observing such phases in experiments.

Title: Spin-Valley Locking and Pure Spin-Triplet Superconductivity in Noncollinear Antiferromagnets Proximitized to Conventional Superconductors
Authors: Song-Bo Zhang, Lun-Hui Hu, Qian Niu, Zhenyu Zhang
Abstract: Unconventional antiferromagnets with spin-split bands, such as noncollinear magnets and the recently discovered altermagnets, serve as new constituents to explore unconventional superconductivity. Here, we unveil a new type and previously unappreciated nature of spin-valley locking in noncollinear antiferromagnets and exploit this texture to achieve pure spin-triplet superconductivity. Using chiral antiferromagnetic kagome lattices (e.g., Mn$_3$Ge and Mn$_3$Ga) coupled to conventional $s$-wave superconductors as prototypical examples, we demonstrate that the antiferromagnetic chirality strongly favors spin-triplet pairing via superconducting proximity effect, while suppressing spin-singlet pairing in the antiferromagnets away from the interfaces. Crucially, such a long-sought spin-triplet superconducting state is established without invoking the prevailing mechanism of spin-orbit coupling or net magnetization. Furthermore, the spin-triplet supercurrent is resilient to both in-plane and out-of-plane Zeeman fields, which exhibits distinct superiority to Ising superconductivity, serving as a compelling experimental signature of the triplet pairing and spin-valley-locked texture.

Title: Steady-state extensional viscosity of wormlike micellar solutions via dissipative particle dynamics simulations
Authors: Yusuke Koide, Takato Ishida, Takashi Uneyama, Yuichi Masubuchi
Abstract: We investigate the steady-state extensional viscosity of wormlike micellar solutions using dissipative particle dynamics simulations. As the extension rate increases, the steady-state extensional viscosity initially increases and subsequently decreases after reaching a maximum, as observed in experiments. We reveal that this nonmonotonic behavior arises from the competition between micellar stretching and scission under uniaxial extensional flow. We further propose a relation that connects the extensional viscosity to micellar structures and kinetics. This relation provides a unified description of the extensional viscosity of unentangled wormlike micellar solutions for various temperatures, concentrations, and extension rates.

Title: Anisotropic-scaling localization in higher-dimensional non-Hermitian systems
Authors: Zuxuan Ou, Hui-Qiang Liang, Guo-Fu Xu, Linhu Li
Abstract: Spatial localization of quantum states is one of the focal points in condensed matter physics and quantum simulations, as it signatures profound physics such as nontrivial band topology and non-reciprocal non-Hermiticity. Yet, in higher dimensions, characterizing state localization becomes elusive due to the sophisticated interplay between different localization mechanisms and spacial geometries. In this work, we unveil an exotic type of localization phenomenon in higher-dimensional non-Hermitian systems, termed anisotropic-scaling localization (ASL), where localization lengths follow distinct size-dependent scaling rules in an anisotropic manner. Assisted with both analytical solution and numerical simulation, we find that ASL can emerge from two different mechanisms of effective bulk couplings or one-dimensional junction between different 1D edges, depending on how non-reciprocity is introduced to the system. The competition between ASL states and edge non-Hermitian skin states are further identified by their complex and real eigenenergies, respectively. Our results resolve the subtle co-existence of loop-like spectrum and skin-like localization of boundary states in contemporary literature, and provide a framework to classify the intricate higher-order non- Hermitian localization regarding their localization profiles.

Title: Quantum oscillations of valley current driven by microwave irradiation in transition-metal dichalcogenide/ferromagnet hybrids
Authors: Xin Hu, Yuya Ominato, Mamoru Matsuo
Abstract: We theoretically study spin and valley transport in a TMDC/ferromagnet heterostructure under a perpendicular magnetic field. We find that microwave-driven spin pumping induces a valley-selective spin excitation, a direct consequence of the valley-asymmetric Landau levels in the TMDC conduction band. This process generates a pure valley current which, as our central finding, exhibits pronounced quantum oscillations as a function of chemical potential. These oscillations provide a definitive experimental signature of the quantized valley states and establish a new pathway to interface spintronics and valleytronics.

Title: Dual Effect of L-Cysteine on the Reorientation and Relaxation of Fe3O4-Decorated Graphene Oxide Liquid Crystals
Authors: M.Zhezhu, Y.Melikyan, V.Hayrapetyan, A.Vasilev, H.Gharagulyan
Abstract: Here, we study the dynamics of Fe3O4-decorated L-Cysteine-functionalized GOLC director under an external magnetic field and analyze L-Cysteine's influence on the reorientation and relaxation time of the director. In particular, Fe3O4 nanoparticles were synthesized by solution-combustion method and added for altering orientational properties of GO which we synthesized electrochemically and functionalized by L-Cysteine. In addition, a comprehensive comparison of the director behaviour of GOLC and Fe3O4-decorated L-Cysteine-GOLC was undertaken to verify the tunability of the aforementioned systems. Furthermore, we demonstrate dual-effect of L-Cysteine on the magnetic field-induced alignment and relaxation time of GOLC systems, namely decrease in reorientation time and at the same time increase in relaxation time. Besides, micropattern creation and controlling in the drying drops of GOLC (net- and knit-like, flower-like, radial- and parallel-strip etc.) using a magnetic field were shown. The results of our studies could facilitate the fabrication of ordered and patterned tunable GOLC assemblies for a range of advanced applications.

Title: Shock absorption by multilayer carbon nanotube packings
Authors: Alexander V. Savin
Abstract: The propagation of transverse impact energy in a multilayer packing (in an array) of parallel single-walled carbon nanotubes has been simulated. It has been shown that such nanotube arrays are effective shock absorbers. The depreciation effect is most pronounced for packings of nanotubes with a diameter of 2.7-3.9 nm. Here, part of the impact energy is absorbed due to the transfer of the packing to a higher energy stationary state, in which part of the nanotubes is in a collapsed state. The impact impulse reaches the other edge of the packing most weakened and distributed over time. For nanotubes with a smaller diameter, the compression of the array occurs elastically without energy accumulation, and for nanotubes with a larger diameter - with energy release.

Title: Coexistence of anomalous spin dynamics and weak magnetic order in a chiral trillium lattice K2FeSn(PO4)3

Abstract: Trillium lattices, where magnetic ions form a three-dimensional chiral network of corner-sharing equilateral triangular motifs, offer a prominent platform to explore exotic quantum states. In this work, we report ground-state properties of the $S$ = 5/2 trillium lattice compound K$_{2}$FeSn(PO$_{4}$)$_{3}$ through thermodynamic, electron spin resonance (ESR), and muon spin relaxation (${\mu}$SR) experiments. Thermodynamic and ESR measurements reveal the two-step evolution of magnetic correlations across $T^{*}$ = 11 K, which results from an interplay between dominant antiferromagnetic Heisenberg interactions and subleading interactions. Below $T^{*}$, \textit{dc} and \textit{ac} magnetic susceptibilities indicate weak \textcolor{black}{magnetic ordering} at $T_{\rm N} \approx 2$ K under low fields, which is suppressed for $\mu_{0}H \geq 2$ T, consistent with a power-law dependence of magnetic specific heat at low temperatures. $\mu$SR experiments confirm the dominance of persistent spin dynamics and the absence of conventional spin freezing, supporting the subtle nature of weak magnetic ordering coexisting with spin-liquid-like fluctuations. These findings underscore the potential for realizing a classical spin-liquid ground state with exotic excitations in high-spin trillium lattice systems.

Title: Single domain spectroscopic signatures of a magnetic Kagome metal
Authors: L. Plucinski, G. Bihlmayer, Y. Mokrousov, Yishui Zhou, Yixi Su, A. Bostwick, C. Jozwiak, E. Rotenberg, D. Usachov, C. M. Schneider
Abstract: Spin- and orbital-resolved access to the electronic bands is necessary to establish key properties of quantum materials such as the quantum-geometric tensor. Despite recent revival on magnetic Kagome compounds, no spectroscopic access to their magnetic properties has been available so far due to small domain sizes and lack of appropriate techniques. Furthermore, their real space magnetic texture is often complex and temperature-dependent. We investigate the magnetic Kagome metal DyMn$_6$Sn$_6$ using high-resolution micro-focused circular-dichroic angle-resolved photoemission ($\mu$-CD-ARPES) to probe its magnetic and electronic properties. By tuning the kinetic energy to various features of the Dy $4f$ multiplet, we resolve magnetic domains in samples cryo-cooled down to 20 K. Smaller, but clear signatures are detected in the Mn $3p$ levels. The behavior of both Dy $4f$ and Mn $3p$ features are in remarkable agreement with our modeling based on the Hartree-Fock method, revealing ferrimagnetic alignment of Dy and Mn local moments, and further strengthening our interpretation. Adjusting the energy to the Mn $3d$-dominated valence bands reveals signatures which we relate to the orbital magnetization through a comparison to {\it ab initio} electronic structure calculations. Our study establishes the spectroscopic access to a single magnetic domain in a Kagome metal, paving the way for further research into imaging magnetic phases of novel magnetic materials using $\mu$-CD-ARPES.

Abstract: Circular dichroism in the angular distribution (CDAD) is the effect that the angular intensity distribution of photoemitted electrons depends on the handedness of the incident circularly polarized light. A CDAD may arise from intrinsic material properties like chirality, spin-orbit interaction, or quantum-geometrical effects on the electronic structure. In addition, CDAD has also been reported for achiral organic molecules at the interface to metallic substrates. For this latter case, we investigate two prototypical $\pi$-conjugated molecules, namely tetracene and pentacene, whose frontier orbitals have a similar shape but exhibit distinctly different symmetries. By comparing experimental CDAD momentum maps with simulations within time-dependent density functional theory, we show how the final state of the photoelectron must be regarded as the source of the CDAD in such otherwise achiral systems. We gain additional insight into the mechanism by employing a simple scattering model for the final state, which allows us to decompose the CDAD signal into partial wave contributions.

Title: Controlling the magneto-transport properties of magnetic topological insulator thin films from Cr$_x$(Bi$_y\,$Sb$_{1-y}$)$_{2-x}$Te$_3$ via molecular beam epitaxy
Authors: Jan Karthein, Jonas Buchhorn, Kaycee Underwood, Abdur Rehman Jalil, Max Vaßen-Carl, Peter Schüffelgen, Detlev Grützmacher, Thomas Schäpers
Abstract: In this work we present a systematic in-depth study of how we can alter the magneto-transport properties of magnetic topological insulator thin films by tuning the parameters of the molecular beam epitaxy. First, we show how a varying substrate temperature changes the surface morphology and when chosen properly leads to a high crystal quality. Next, the effect of the chromium concentration on the film roughness and crystal quality is investigated. Finally, both the substrate temperature and the chromium concentration are investigated with respect to their effect on the magneto-transport properties of the magnetic topological insulator thin films. It becomes apparent that the substrate temperature and the chromium concentration can be used to tune the Fermi level of the film which allows to make the material intrinsically charge neutral. A very low chromium concentration furthermore allows to tune the magnetic topological insulator into a regime where strong superconducting correlations can be expected when combining the material with a superconductor.

Title: Material Loss Model Calibration for Tantalum Superconducting Resonators
Authors: Guy Moshel, Sergei Masis, Moshe Schechter, Shay Hacohen-Gourgy
Abstract: Material research is a key frontier in advancing superconducting qubit and circuit performance. In this work, we develop a simple and broadly applicable framework for accurately characterizing two-level system (TLS) loss using internal quality factor measurements of superconducting transmission line resonators over a range of temperatures and readout powers. We applied this method to a series of $\alpha$-Ta resonators that span a wide frequency range, thus providing a methodology for probing the loss mechanisms in the fabrication process of this emerging material for superconducting quantum circuits. We introduce an analytical model that captures the loss behavior without relying on numerical simulations, enabling straightforward interpretation and calibration. Additionally, our measurements reveal empirical frequency-dependent trends in key parameters of the model, suggesting contributions from mechanisms beyond the standard tunneling model of TLSs.

Title: Local control of parity and charge in nanoscale superconducting lead islands
Authors: Stefano Trivini, Jon Ortuzar, Katerina Vaxevani, Beatriz Viña-Bausá, F. Sebastian Bergeret, Jose Ignacio Pascual
Abstract: Small superconducting islands can exhibit charge quantization, where Coulomb interactions compete with Cooper pairing. Using scanning tunneling spectroscopy, we probe this interplay by measuring the charging energy ($E_C$) and the pairing energy ($\Delta$) of individual nano-islands. Below a critical island size, where $E_C > \Delta$, we observe a crossover between even and odd parity ground states. By applying controlled voltage pulses, we continuously tune the island's electrostatic potential and map the full charge-parity landscape. These results demonstrate tunable superconducting ground states, offering a potential platform for qubit design and control.

Title: Efficient Preparation of Fermionic Superfluids in an Optical Dipole Trap through Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Yueyang Min, Ziliang Li, Yi Zhong, Jia-An Xuan, Jian Lin, Fei Leng, Xiaopeng Li
Abstract: We demonstrate a reinforcement learning (RL) based control framework for optimizing evaporative cooling in the preparation of strongly interacting degenerate Fermi gases of Li6. Using a Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm, the system autonomously explores a high-dimensional parameter space to learn optimal cooling trajectories. Compared to conventional exponential ramps, our method achieves up to 130% improvement in atomic density within a 0.5 second, revealing non-trivial control strategies that balance fast evaporation and thermalization. While our current optimization focuses on the evaporation stage, future integration of other cooling stages, such as grey molasses cooling, could further extend RL to the full preparation pipeline. Our result highlights the promise of RL as a general tool for closed-loop quantum control and automated calibration in complex atomic physics experiments.

Title: Interacting Bose gases in twisted-bilayer optical lattices
Authors: Ganesh C. Paul, Patrik Recher, Luis Santos
Abstract: Recent experiments have realized ultra-cold gases in twisted-bilayer optical lattices. We show that interacting bosons in these lattices present a highly non-trivial ground-state physics resulting from the interplay between inter- and intra-layer hopping and interactions. This physics is crucially determined by site clusterization, which we properly take into account by developing a specifically-tailored cluster Gutzwiller approach. Clusterization results in a large variety of different Mott-like phases characterized by typically different occupations of the clusters, and in the appearance of pockets of sites in between which particles can freely move, but which remain disconnected from each other. This peculiar phase, which resembles the well-known Bose glass phase, may occur even for commensurate twist angles and is further enhanced when the twisting is incommensurate. Moreover, in the incommensurate case, the formation of mobility islands may occur even without inter-layer hopping solely due to inter-layer interactions.

Title: Superconductivity in RbH$_{12}$ at low pressures: an \emph{ab initio} study
Authors: Đorđe Dangić, Yuewen Fang, Ion Errea
Abstract: High-pressure polyhydrides are leading contenders for room temperature superconductivity. The next frontier lies in stabilizing them at ambient pressure, which would allow their practical applications. In this first-principles computational study, we investigate the potential for record-low pressure stabilization of binary superhydrides within the RbH$_{12}$ system including lattice quantum anharmonic effects in the calculations. %Within the pressure range of 0 to 100 GPa, we identify five competing phases. We identify five competing phases for the pressure range between 0 and 100 GPa. Incorporating anharmonic and quantum effects on ion dynamics, we find the $Immm$ and $P6_3/mmc$ phases to be the most probable, potentially metastable even at pressures as low as 10 GPa. Notably, all phases exhibit metallic properties, with critical temperatures between 50 and 100 K within the pressure range they are dynamically stable. These findings have the potential to inspire future experimental exploration of high-temperature superconductivity at low pressures in Rb-H binary compounds.

Title: Emergent Symmetry and Phase Transitions on the Domain Wall of $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ Topological Orders
Authors: Hong-Hao Song, Chen Peng, Rui-Zhen Huang, Long Zhang
Abstract: The one-dimensional (1D) domain wall of 2D $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ topological orders is studied theoretically. The Ising domain wall model is shown to have an emergent SU(2)$_{1}$ conformal symmetry because of a hidden nonsymmorphic octahedral symmetry. While a weak magnetic field is an irrelevant perturbation to the bulk topological orders, it induces a domain wall transition from the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid to a ferromagnetic order, which spontaneously breaks the anomalous $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ symmetry and the time-reversal symmetry on the domain wall. Moreover, the gapless domain wall state also realizes a 1D topological quantum critical point between a $\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{T}$-symmetry-protected topological phase and a trivial phase, thus demonstrating the holographic construction of topological transitions.

Title: Representation of Archimedean Networks and Inclusion: Computational Applications to Percolation and Network Transitions
Authors: Auro Anibal Torres, José Antonio Ramirez-Pastor
Abstract: We present an alternative geometric representation for the eleven Archimedean lattices, in which each site and bond is uniquely labeled by an ordered pair of integers and characterized via a modular function. This structured labeling enables efficient and systematic implementation of computational models on these lattices, without relying on ad hoc indexing, and provides a versatile framework for future studies on regular tilings. As an application, we obtain, for each Archimedean lattice, the phase diagrams generated by monomer deposition for the site-bond percolation models known in the literature as S \cup B and S \cap B. We show that these diagrams are ordered in phase space according to the partial and total inclusion relations among the lattices, as demonstrated by Parviainen et al. (2003). Furthermore, for the lattice pairs (this http URL)/(this http URL) and (3^3.4^2)/(3^this http URL), we observe an inversion between the pure site and bond percolation thresholds. We show that this phenomenon is linked to the crossing of their respective phase diagrams, highlighting the sensitivity of critical behavior to lattice topology.

Title: Configurational forces explain echelon cracks in soft materials
Authors: Angel Santarossa, Nydia Roxana Varela-Rosales, Paul Steinmann, Miguel Angel Moreno-Mateos
Abstract: Soft fracture in highly deformable solids involves both geometric and constitutive nonlinearities, necessitating advanced theoretical and computational frameworks for its accurate understanding. Tensile fractures subjected to mixed-mode loading deviate from their original planar shape, resulting in echelon crack patterns. When out-of-plane shear is superimposed, a crack front segments into an array of tilted facets. The physical interpretation of echelon cracks is only marginally understood, and it is customarily based on rather limited approaches based on Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics. Here we investigate mixed-mode I + III fracture within the framework of configurational mechanics. Using the Configurational Force Method, implemented as a post-processing algorithm in a finite-element-based simulation, we compute the configurational forces acting at the crack tip of model fracture geometries prior to propagation. Configurational forces characterize both the magnitude and direction of propagation for maximal energy release rate. Our results reveal the complex interactions between tilted facets and their critical role in shaping the fracture morphology. We also examine the effects of facet coalescence-driven by the growth of the parent crack-where neighboring facets merge into a unified crack front. These findings provide new insights into fracture processes in soft, quasi-brittle materials under mixed-mode loading.

Title: Light-hole states and hyperfine interaction in electrically-defined Ge/GeSn quantum dots
Authors: Agnieszka Miętkiewicz, Jakub Ziembicki, Krzysztof Gawarecki
Abstract: We theoretically investigate hole spins confined in a gate-defined quantum dot (QD) embedded in GeSn/Ge/GeSn quantum well (QW) structure. Owing to the tensile strain in the Ge layer, the system effectively realizes a light-hole qubit. We systematically study how various morphological parameters influence the energy spectrum, g-factors, and the hyperfine coupling to the nuclear spin bath. The simulations are carried out using a realistic, fully atomic sp$^3$d$^5$s$^*$ tight-binding model. We also perform complementary DFT calculations of wave functions near the atomic cores and use them to parameterize the hyperfine-interaction Hamiltonian. We evaluate the Overhauser field fluctuations and demonstrate that the strength of the hyperfine coupling for the lowest hole doublet crucially depends on the Sn content in the barrier. We highlight the conduction-valence band mixing, which leads to considerable $s$-type admixtures to the hole states, providing the dominant channel of hyperfine coupling due to the Fermi contact interaction.

Title: Electrically tunable heavy fermion and quantum criticality in magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene
Authors: Le Zhang, Wenqiang Zhou, Xinjie Fang, Zhen Zhan, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Yi-feng Yang, Shuigang Xu
Abstract: The interplay between localized magnetic moments and itinerant electrons gives rise to exotic quantum states in condensed matter systems. Two-dimensional moire superlattices offer a powerful platform for engineering heavy fermion states beyond conventional rare-earth intermetallic compounds. While localized and itinerant carriers have been observed in twisted graphene moire systems, direct evidence of their strong coupling--leading to artificial heavy fermion states--has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate electrically tunable heavy fermion in magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene, achieved by controlling the Kondo hybridization between localized flatband electrons and itinerant Dirac electrons via a displacement field. Our results reveal a continuous quantum phase transition from an antiferromagnetic semimetal to a paramagnetic heavy fermion metal, evidenced by a crossover from logarithmic to quadratic temperature-dependent resistivity, a dramatic enhancement of quasiparticle effective mass, and Fermi surface reconstruction near quantum critical point. This highly tunable platform offers unprecedented control over heavy fermion physics, establishing moire heterostructures as a versatile arena for exploring correlated quantum phases--including potential unconventional superconductivity--in two-dimensional materials.

Title: Cryogenic spin 3/2 nuclear quadrupole resonance: Spin relaxation and electric field gradient via Rabi frequency goniometry
Authors: Ritik R. Modi (1), Karen L. Sauer (1 and 2) ((1) Department of Physics and Astronomy, George Mason University, Fairfax, VA, USA, (2) Quantum Science and Engineering Center, George Mason University, Fairfax, VA, USA)
Abstract: A straightforward way to determine the electric field gradient $-$ principal axes frame (EFG-PAF) on single crystal samples with spin 3/2 nuclei is demonstrated. Nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) spectroscopy is used to determine the Rabi frequency for $^{35}$Cl in a single crystal of potassium chlorate (KClO$_3$) by comparing the NQR signal for powder and single crystal samples. By exploiting the geometrical dependence of the Rabi frequency with respect to the excitation direction, EFG-PAF is readily determined. Furthermore, relaxation times $T_1$ and $T_2^*$ were measured at multiple temperatures ranging from $17~\textrm{K}$ to $200 ~$K, extending the results of previous works to colder temperatures where new relaxation mechanisms become dominant. The experiments were performed in a cryogen-free cryostat, which posed distinct challenges compared to a conventional cryogenic cooling setup. The successful operation of the NQR probe within a cryogen-free cryostat has the potential to make the technique more accessible and widen applications.

Title: Streamline controlled rectification of supercurrent in thin-film asymmetric weak links
Authors: Filippo Antola, Sebastiano Battisti, Alessandro Braggio, Francesco Giazotto, Giorgio De Simoni
Abstract: In this study, we examined the supercurrent diode effect (SDE) in mesoscopic superconducting weak links formed by asymmetric Dayem bridges. These planar metallic constrictions, which naturally exhibit Josephsonlike behavior, offer a fundamental platform for investigating nonreciprocal transport phenomena in a regime where the bridge width aligns with the superconducting coherence length. The foundational concept is inspired by the Tesla valve, a classical fluidic device that achieves flow rectification through interference and turbulence between fluid streams enabled by geometric asymmetry. Analogously, we demonstrate that spatial asymmetry within superconducting structures can result in rectification due to the polarity-dependent interaction between transport and screening currents. By implementing controlled geometric defects at the junction between the constriction and superconducting leads, we induce current crowding and disrupt spatial inversion symmetry, thus facilitating directional switching behavior. Experimental results indicate a linear-in-field rectification regime at low magnetic fields, driven by the interaction between transport and screening currents, which is succeeded by complex vortex dynamics within the superconducting banks at elevated fields. Time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau simulations replicate significant features of the experimental observations and substantiate the influence of both screening currents and rearrangements of Abrikosov vortices. A comparative study across various geometries highlights the crucial role of defect shape and spatial confinement in determining the rectification efficiency, revealing a minimum threshold in bridge width below which crowding-induced SDE is significantly reduced. Our findings advocate for mesoscopic Dayem bridges as a flexible platform for designing and controlling superconducting diode functionalities.

Title: Ab initio study of flexoelectricity in MXene monolayers
Authors: Shashikant Kumar, Zixi Zhang, Phanish Suryanarayana
Abstract: We investigate flexoelectricity in MXene monolayers from first principles. Specifically, we compute the transverse flexoelectric coefficients of 126 MXene monolayers along their two principal directions using Kohn-Sham density functional theory. The values span a wide range from 0.19$e$ to 1.3$e$ and are nearly isotropic with respect to bending direction. The transition metal is found to play a significant role in the flexoelectric response, with nitride-based MXenes consistently displaying larger coefficients than their carbide counterparts. Moreover, the coefficients increase with structural thickness, but when normalized by the bending modulus, which is also computed for all 126 monolayers, they exhibit the opposite trend.

Title: When $B_2$ is Not Enough: Evaluating Simple Metrics for Predicting Phase Separation of Intrinsically Disordered Proteins
Authors: Wesley W. Oliver, William M. Jacob, Michael A. Webb
Abstract: Understanding and predicting the phase behavior of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) is of significant interest due to their role in many biological processes. However, effectively characterizing phase behavior and its complex dependence on protein primary sequence remains challenging. In this study, we evaluate the efficacy of several simple computational metrics to quantify the propensity of single-component IDP solutions to phase separate; specific metrics considered include the single-chain radius of gyration, the second virial coefficient, and a newly proposed quantity termed the expenditure density. Each metric is computed using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations for 2,034 IDP sequences. Using machine learning, we analyze this data to understand how sequence features correlate with the predictive performance of each metric and to develop insight into their respective strengths and limitations. The expenditure density is determined to be a broadly useful metric that combines simplicity, low computational cost, and accuracy; it also provides a continuous measure that remains informative across both phase-separating and non-phase-separating sequences. Additionally, this metric shows promise in its ability to improve predictions of other properties for IDP systems. This work extends existing literature by advancing beyond binary classification, which can be useful for rapidly screening phase behavior or predicting other properties of IDP-related systems.

Title: Velocity Distribution and Diffusion of an Athermal Inertial Run-and-Tumble Particle in a Shear-Thickening Medium
Authors: Subhanker Howlader, Sayantan Mondal, Prasenjit Das
Abstract: We study the dynamics of an athermal inertial run-and-tumble particle moving in a shear-thickening medium in $d=1$. The viscosity of the medium is represented by a nonlinear function $f(v)\sim\tan(v)$, while a symmetric dichotomous noise of strength $\Sigma$ and flipping rate $\lambda$ models the activity of the particle. Starting from the Fokker-Planck~(FP) equation for the time-dependent probability distribution $W_{\pm\Sigma}(v, t)$ of the particle's velocity $v$ at time $t$ and the active force is $\pm\Sigma$, we analytically derive the steady-state velocity distribution function $W_s(v)$ and a quadrature expression for the effective diffusion coefficient $D_{\rm eff}$. For a fixed $\Sigma$, $W_s(v)$ undergoes multiple transitions with varying $\lambda$, and we have identified the corresponding transition points. We then numerically compute $W_s(v)$, the mean-squared velocity $\langle v^2\rangle(t)$, and the diffusion coefficient $D_{\rm eff}$, all of which show excellent agreement with the analytical results in the steady-state. Finally, we test the robustness of the transitions in $W_s(v)$ by considering an alternative $f(v)$ function that also capture the shear-thickening behavior of the medium.

Title: Global Synchronization in Matrix-Weighted Networks
Authors: Anna Gallo, Yu Tian, Renaud Lambiotte, Timoteo Carletti
Abstract: Synchronization phenomena in complex systems are fundamental to understanding collective behavior across disciplines. While classical approaches model such systems by using scalar-weighted networks and simple diffusive couplings, many real-world interactions are inherently multidimensional and transformative. To address this limitation, Matrix-Weighted Networks (MWNs) have been introduced as a versatile framework where edges are associated with matrix weights that encode both interaction strength and directional transformation. In this work, we investigate the emergence and stability of global synchronization in MWNs by studying coupled Stuart-Landau oscillators-an archetypal model of nonlinear dynamics near a Hopf bifurcation. We derive a generalized Master Stability Function (MSF) tailored to MWNs and establish necessary and sufficient conditions for synchronization to occur. Central to our analysis is the concept of coherence, a structural property of MWNs ensuring path-independent transformations. Our results show that coherence is necessary to achieve global synchronization and provides a theoretical foundation for analyzing multidimensional dynamical processes in complex networked systems.

Title: Magnetic and ferroelectric phase diagram of twisted CrI$_3$ layers
Authors: Haoshen Ye, Shuai Dong
Abstract: Twisting layers provide a rich ore for exotic physics in low dimensions. Despite the abundant discoveries of twistronics from the aspect of electronic structures, ferroic moiré textures are more plain and thus less concerned. Rigid lattice models are straightforward which can give a rough but intuitional description in most cases. However, taking CrI$_3$ as a model system, here we will demonstrate that the interlayer stacking potential can spontaneously lead to structural relaxation, which plays a vital role to understand the ferroicity in the twisted superlattices. The magnetic ground state is sensitive to the stacking mode and twisting angles, which can be seriously affected by the structural relaxation. In particular, the expected magnetic bubbles are annihilated in its bilayer. In contrast, due to topological protection, the ferroelectric vortices are more robust to structural relaxation, as well as twisting angle and this http URL to the universal existence of spontaneous structural relaxation in twisted superlattices, our work may lead to a general revisitation of emerging physics of twistronics.

Title: Material-Limited Switching in Nanoscale Ferroelectrics
Authors: Tony Chiang, John J. Plombon, Megan K. Lenox, Ian Mercer, Punyashloka Debashis, Mahendra DC, Susan Trolier-McKinstry, Jon-Paul Maria, Jon F. Ihlefeld, Ian A. Young, John T. Heron
Abstract: The ferroelectric switching speed has been experimentally obfuscated by the interaction between the measurement circuit and the ferroelectric switching itself. This has prohibited the observation of real material responses at nanosecond timescales and lower. Here, fundamental polarization switching speeds in ferroelectric materials with the perovskite, fluorite, and wurtzite structures are reported. Upon lateral scaling of island capacitors from micron to nanoscales, a clear transition from circuit-limited switching to a material-limited switching regime is observed. In La$_{0.15}$Bi$_{0.85}$FeO$_{3}$ capacitors, switching is as fast as ~150 ps, the fastest switching time reported. For polycrystalline Hf$_{0.5}$Zr$_{0.5}$O$_{2}$ capacitors, a fundamental switching limit of ~210 ps is observed. Switching times for Al$_{0.92}$B$_{0.08}$N are near 20 ns, limited by the coercive and breakdown electric fields. The activation field, instantaneous pseudo-resistivity, and energy-delay are reported in this material-limited regime. Lastly, a criterion for reaching the material-limited regime is provided. This regime enables observation of intrinsic material properties and favorable scaling trends for high-performance computing.

Title: Discontinuity in the distribution of field increments between avalanches in non-abelian random field Blume-Emery-Griffiths model with no passing violation
Authors: Aldrin B E, Alberto Rosso, Sumedha
Abstract: We study the zero-temperature quasi-statically driven dynamics of the random field Blume-Emery-Griffiths model (RFBEGM) as a prototype for disordered systems with competing interactions. While the random field Ising model is known to obey the no-passing rule we show that this property is generically violated in the RFBEGM. By exploring the full parameter space, we identify the precise conditions under which no-passing is broken, particularly in the regime where a repulsive biquadratic coupling introduces frustration. Here, we find that this violation leaves a clear fingerprint in the form of a discontinuity in the distribution of the field increments between successive avalanches. We provide analytical arguments that locate the onset of this discontinuity, in excellent agreement with numerical simulations.

Title: Towards dislocation-driven quantum interconnects
Authors: Cunzhi Zhang, Victor Wen-zhe Yu, Yu Jin, Jonah Nagura, Sevim Polat Genlik, Maryam Ghazisaeidi, Giulia Galli
Abstract: A central problem in the deployment of quantum technologies is the realization of robust architectures for quantum interconnects. We propose to engineer interconnects in semiconductors and insulators by patterning spin qubits at dislocations, thus forming quasi one-dimensional lines of entangled point defects. To gain insight into the feasibility and control of dislocation-driven interconnects, we investigate the optical cycle and coherence properties of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond, in proximity of dislocations, using a combination of advanced first-principles calculations. We show that one can engineer spin defects with properties similar to those of their bulk counterparts, including charge stability and a favorable optical cycle, and that NV centers close to dislocations have much improved coherence properties. Finally, we predict optically detected magnetic resonance spectra that may facilitate the experimental identification of specific defect configurations. Our results provide a theoretical foundation for the engineering of one-dimensional arrays of spin defects in the solid state.

Title: Revealing the impact of chemical short-range order on radiation damage in MoNbTaVW high-entropy alloys using a machine-learning potential
Authors: Jiahui Liu, Shuo Cao, Yanzhou Wang, Zheyong Fan, Guocai Lv, Ping Qian, Yanjing Su
Abstract: The effect of chemical short-range order (CSRO) on primary radiation damage in MoNbTaVW high-entropy alloys is investigated using hybrid Monte Carlo/molecular dynamics simulations with a machine-learned potential. We show that CSRO enhances radiation tolerance by promoting interstitial diffusion while suppressing vacancy migration, thereby increasing defect recombination efficiency during recovery stage. However, CSRO is rapidly degraded under cumulative irradiation, with Warren-Cowley parameters dropping below 0.3 at a dose of only 0.03~dpa. This loss of ordering reduces the long-term enhancement of CSRO on radiation resistance. Our results highlight that while CSRO can effectively improve the radiation tolerance of MoNbTaVW, its stability under irradiation is critical to realizing and sustaining this benefit.

Title: Phonon spectrum in the spin-Peierls phase of CuGeO$_3$

Abstract: CuGeO$_3$ has long been studied as a prototypical example of the spin-Peierls transition in a $S = 1/2$ Heisenberg chain. Despite intensive investigation of this quasi-one-dimensional material, systematic measurements and calculations of the phonon excitations in the dimerized phase have not to date been possible, leaving certain aspects of the spin-Peierls phenomenon unresolved. We perform state-of-the-art density functional theory (DFT) calculations to compute the electronic structure and phonon dynamics in the low-temperature dimerized phase. We also perform high-resolution neutron spectroscopy to measure the full phonon spectrum over multiple Brillouin zones. We find excellent agreement between our numerical and experimental results that extend to all measurement temperatures. Notable features of our phonon spectra include a number of steeply dispersive modes, nonmonotonic dispersion features, and specific phonon anticrossings, which we relate to the mode eigenvectors. By calculating the magnetic interactions within DFT and studying the effects of different phonon modes on the superexchange paths, we discuss the possibility of observing spin-phonon hybridization effects in experiments performed both in and out of equilibrium.

Title: Topological quantum materials: kagome, chiral, and square-net frameworks
Authors: Avdhesh K. Sharma, Snehashish Chatterjee, Premakumar Yanda, Claudia Felser, Chandra Shekhar
Abstract: Topological quantum materials have emerged as a frontier in condensed matter physics as well as in materials science, with intriguing electronic states that are robust to perturbations. Among the diverse structural motifs, kagome, chiral, and square-net structures offer a wide range of topological phases and physical phenomena. These include Dirac and Weyl fermions, nodal-line semimetals, flat bands, van Hove singularities, charge density waves, superconductivity, nontrivial Berry phase, nonlinear electrical and thermal transports. This review explores the distinct roles of geometry, symmetry, spin-orbit coupling, and electron correlations in these three classes of materials. It also highlights how their crystallographic features give rise to unique electronic band structures, topologically protected states and different physical properties, which require high-quality-single crystals. The present discussion comprises recent experimental discoveries and identification of the synthesis routes of key materials within each framework. Finally, the review outlines the current challenges and future directions in the design and exploration of topological quantum materials.

Title: Electron-phonon-dominated charge-density-wave fluctuations in TiSe$_2$ accessed by ultrafast nonequilibrium dynamics

Abstract: 1T-TiSe$_2$ exhibits a charge-density-wave (CDW) transition below 200 K, which is believed to be driven by a hybrid exciton-phonon mechanism, making it a versatile platform for investigating the interplay between electronic and lattice degrees of freedom. Although the corresponding band structure modifications below the CDW transition temperature are well established, only a few reports discuss the occurrence of the CDW fluctuating phase and its spectral features well above the transition temperature. Here, we report the direct observation of spectral features associated with CDW fluctuations at 295 K, using time-resolved extreme ultraviolet momentum microscopy. We investigated the transient melting and recovery of CDW fluctuations upon nonresonant ultrafast photoexcitation. Surprisingly, our results reveal that the coherent amplitude mode modulating the ultrafast CDW recovery persists at these elevated temperatures. The time-, energy- and momentum-resolved photoemission data supported by density functional perturbation theory further confirm that CDW fluctuations at these elevated temperatures are dominated by electron-phonon interaction. The analysis of these very localized microscopic fluctuations consequently provides new insights into the complex interplay between the electronic and lattice degrees of freedom at elevated temperatures and, therefore, on the nature of this quantum phase transition.

Title: Ground and excited-state properties of the extended Hubbard dimer from the multichannel Dyson equation
Authors: Stefano Paggi, J. Arjan Berger, Pina Romaniello
Abstract: We have recently presented the multichannel Dyson equation as an alternative to the standard single-channel Dyson equation. While the latter involves a single many-body Green's function, the former uses a multichannel Green's function in which two or more many-body Green's functions are coupled. Quasiparticles and satellites are thus naturally treated on equal footing in the multichannel Dyson equation. To assess the accuracy of our approach we apply it here to the ground- and excited-state properties of the extended Hubbard dimer, an exactly solvable model for $H_2$. In particular, we focus on the potential energy surface as well as the corresponding spectral functions and HOMO-LUMO gaps, which are well-known challenges for many-body approximations such as second Born and $GW$. We show that the multichannel Dyson equation gives overall very good results for all properties considered and outperforms both $GW$ and second Born. In particular, the multichannel Dyson equation yields the correct ground-state energy and HOMO-LUMO gap in the dissociation limit contrary to $GW$.

Title: Alkali doping of Zn$_{\rm x}$Mg$_{\rm 1-x}$O alloys for $p$-type conductivity
Authors: John L. Lyons
Abstract: Nearly all ultrawide-bandgap oxides are affected by hole localization that limits $p$-type conductivity and thus potential applications for these materials. Highly localized holes, also known as hole polarons, trap in the vicinity of acceptor dopants, giving rise to large ionization energies and severely constraining free hole concentrations. Though this hole-trapping behavior affects wurtzite zinc oxide, rocksalt zinc oxide was recently found to be resistant to the formation of hole polarons. Moreover, $p$-type doping using lithium acceptors was predicted to be achievable. While rocksalt zinc oxide is metastable and has a band gap near $\sim$3 eV, here it is found that zinc magnesium oxide (Zn$_{\rm x}$Mg$_{\rm 1-x}$O) alloys remain $p$-type dopable within the stable rocksalt crystal structure, in addition to exhibiting band gaps in excess of 4 eV. As in rocksalt zinc oxide, alkali acceptors are shallow in zinc magnesium oxide and do not appear to be affected by donor compensation. These results indicate that alkali-doped Zn$_{\rm x}$Mg$_{\rm 1-x}$O alloys are a promising system for achieving a $p$-type dopable ultrawide-bandgap oxide.

Title: Competing color superconductivity and color Kondo effect in quark matter
Authors: Pradip Kattel, Abay Zhakenov, Natan Andrei
Abstract: The competition between bulk color superconductivity and the localized screening of a heavy quark impurity, analogous to the Kondo effect, leads to a rich spectrum of phenomena in dense quark matter. We investigate this competition at the edge of a superconducting quark bulk, where both the superconducting gap and the Kondo scale are dynamically generated in a tractable toy model. Utilizing the exact Bethe Ansatz method, we elucidate the resulting boundary physics. We identify distinct regimes characterized by either multi-particle Kondo screening or an unscreened local moment. Crucially, we also uncover a novel intermediate phase featuring impurity screening through a single-particle bound state formed within the superconducting gap. The toy model presented in this work highlights the complex interplay between dynamically generated bulk properties and boundary impurities in extreme QCD environments, offering potential insights into phenomena occurring in heavy-ion collisions and compact stars.

Title: Rise and fall of nonstabilizerness via random measurements
Authors: Annarita Scocco, Wai-Keong Mok, Leandro Aolita, Mario Collura, Tobias Haug
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of nonstabilizerness - also known as `magic' - in monitored quantum circuits composed of random Clifford unitaries and local projective measurements. For measurements in the computational basis, we derive an analytical model for dynamics of the stabilizer nullity, showing that it decays in quantized steps and requires exponentially many measurements to vanish, which reveals the strong protection through Clifford scrambling. On the other hand, for measurements performed in rotated non-Clifford bases, measurements can both create and destroy nonstabilizerness. Here, the dynamics leads to a steady-state with non-trivial nonstabilizerness, independent of the initial state. We find that Haar-random states equilibrate in constant time, whereas stabilizer states exhibit linear-in-size relaxation time. While the stabilizer nullity is insensitive to the rotation angle, Stabilizer Rényi Entropies expose a richer structure in their dynamics. Our results uncover sharp distinctions between coarse and fine-grained nonstabilizerness diagnostics and demonstrate how measurements can both suppress and sustain quantum computational resources.

Title: Separation of relaxation timescales via strong system-bath coupling: Dissipative three-level system as a case study
Authors: Brett Min, Matthew Gerry, Dvira Segal
Abstract: We analytically demonstrate that strong system-bath coupling separates the relaxation dynamics of a dissipative quantum system into two distinct regimes: a short-time dynamics that, as expected, accelerates with increasing coupling to the environment, and a slow dynamics that, counterintuitively, becomes increasingly prolonged at sufficiently strong coupling. Using the reaction-coordinate polaron-transform mapping, we uncover the general mechanism behind this effect and derive accurate expressions for both relaxation timescales. Numerical simulations confirm our analytical predictions. From a practical perspective, our results suggest that strong coupling to a dissipative bath can autonomously generate and sustain long-lived quantum coherences, offering a promising strategy for bath-engineered quantum state preparation.

Title: Noise-induced Quantum Mpemba effect
Authors: Mingrui Zhao, Zhonghuai Hou
Abstract: The quantum Mpemba effect (QMPE), an intriguing anomalous relaxation phenomenon, has recently attracted significant attention. However, how various types of noise, which are ubiquitous in real systems, may affect the QMPE remains unknown. Here, we address this gap by constructing a general dynamical framework for d level open quantum systems under random telegraph noise. By investigating the dynamics of an extended system and then projecting back, we find that noise can induce additional modes and strongly influence the relaxation dynamics of the original system. Specially, in the limit of long correlation time of noise, these modes cause anomalous slowdown for certain initial states, thereby inducing or eliminating QMPE, illustrated by a three-level example system. Interestingly, this mechanism leads to a counter intuitive effect:the decoherence rate may be slowed down by noise.

Title: Simultaneous High-Fidelity Single-Qubit Gates in a Spin Qubit Array
Authors: Yi-Hsien Wu, Leon C. Camenzind, Patrick Bütler, Ik Kyeong Jin, Akito Noiri, Kenta Takeda, Takashi Nakajima, Takashi Kobayashi, Giordano Scappucci, Hsi-Sheng Goan, Seigo Tarucha
Abstract: Silicon spin qubits are a promising platform for scalable quantum computing due to their compatibility with industrial semiconductor fabrication and the recent scaling to multi-qubit devices. Control fidelities above the 99% fault-tolerant threshold are routinely achieved, but extending high-fidelity control to simultaneous multi-qubit operation remains a major challenge. We demonstrate high-fidelity, fully parallel control of five silicon spin qubits using a single shared microwave line. Using tailored control pulses, all qubits achieve primitive $\pi/2$ gate fidelities well above 99.99%, with some approaching 99.999%, exceeding previously reported fidelities in silicon spin qubits. These fidelities are mostly preserved during simultaneous operation of up to three qubits, and remain at the practical fault-tolerant threshold of 99.9% even during fully parallel five-qubit operation. This performance is enabled by a calibration scheme that compensates drive-induced phase shifts using only pairwise calibrations, scaling quadratically with qubit number and avoiding exponential overhead. By reducing the number of impedance-controlled microwave lines, our approach addresses a key architectural bottleneck and offers a scalable control strategy for high-fidelity operation in large spin qubit arrays.

Title: Measurement-Induced Phase Transition in a Disordered XX Spin Chain: A Real-Space Renormalization Group Study
Authors: Siddharth Tiwary, Joel E. Moore
Abstract: Spin chains with quenched disorder exhibit rich critical behavior, often captured by real-space renormalization group (RSRG) techniques. However, the physics of such systems in the presence of random measurements (i.e., non-Hermitian dephasing) remains largely unexplored. The interplay between measurements and unitary dynamics gives rise to novel phases and phase transitions in monitored quantum systems. In this work, we investigate the disordered XX spin chain subject to stochastic local measurements in the $X$ and $Y$ bases. By mapping the monitored chain to a non-Hermitian spin ladder with complex couplings, we propose an RSRG-for-excited-states (RSRG-X) approach for this open-system setting. Our analysis reveals a new class of strongly disordered fixed points that emerge due to non-unitarity, broadening the landscape of critical phenomena accessible via RSRG.

Title: Berry Monopole Scattering in the Synthetic Momentum Space of a Bilayer Photonic Crystal Slab
Authors: Ngoc Duc Le, D.-H.-Minh Nguyen, Dung Xuan Nguyen, Hai Son Nguyen, Dario Bercioux
Abstract: Berry monopoles-quantized sources of Berry curvature-are fundamental to topological phases, yet their scattering remains unexplored. Here, we report for the first time the adiabatic scattering of Berry monopoles in a bilayer photonic crystal slab combining one genuine and one synthetic momentum. Two monopoles approach, collide, and scatter within this hybrid parameter space. The process is described by an effective coupled-mode model and confirmed by full-wave simulations. We further propose an experimental scheme using chiral edge states, opening a route to probe monopole interactions in synthetic photonic systems.

Title: Extending the Limited Performance of the Quantum Refrigerator with Catalysts
Authors: Cong Fu, Ousi Pan, Zhiqiang Fan, Yushun Tang, Shanhe Su, Youhui Lin, Jincan Chen
Abstract: Quantum thermal machines offer promising platforms for exploring the fundamental limits of thermodynamics at the microscopic scale. Here, we study a two-stroke quantum refrigerator that extracts heat from a cold reservoir via discrete strokes powered by external work. The working medium consists of two two-level systems (TLSs) and two heat reservoirs at different temperatures and is assisted by an auxiliary system acting as a catalyst. Remarkably, the catalyst remains unchanged after each cycle, ensuring that heat extraction is driven entirely by the work input. We show that the presence of the catalyst leads to two significant enhancements: it enables the coefficient of performance (COP) to exceed the Otto bound and allows the refrigerator to operate in frequency and temperature regimes that are inaccessible without a catalyst. These results highlight the potential of catalytic mechanisms to broaden the operational capabilities of quantum thermal devices and to surpass conventional thermodynamic performance limits.

Abstract: We investigate state-transfer in modular quantum computer architectures exploiting the ultrastrong coupling regime of interaction between quantum processing units and ICs. We show that protocols based on adiabatic coherent transport may achieve near-ideal single-letter quantum capacity and robustness against parametric fluctuations suppressing leakage induced by the dynamical Casimir effect.

Abstract: We investigate dynamical decoupling operated by $2\pi$-pulses in a two-level subspaces of a multilevel system showing that it may leads to selective decoupling. This provides a flexible strategy for decoupling transitions in a quantum network, when control to directly address them is not available which can be use to control internode interaction or actively suppress decoherence

Title: Optomagnonic continuous-variable quantum teleportation enhanced by non-Gaussian distillation
Authors: Zi-Xu Lu, Xuan Zuo, Zhi-Yuan Fan, Jie Li
Abstract: The capability of magnons to coherently couple with various quantum systems makes them an ideal candidate to build hybrid quantum systems. The optomagnonic coupling is essential for constructing a hybrid magnonic quantum network, as the transmission of quantum information among remote quantum nodes must be accomplished using light rather than microwave field. Here we provide an optomagnonic continuous-variable quantum teleportation protocol, which enables the transfer of an input optical state to a remote magnon mode. To overcome the currently relatively weak coupling in the experiment, we introduce non-Gaussian distillation operations to enhance the optomagnonic entanglement and thus the fidelity of the teleportation. An auxiliary microwave cavity is adopted to realize the non-Gaussian and displacement operations on magnons. We show that a series of optical states, such as coherent, single-photon, squeezed and cat states, can be teleported to the magnon mode. The work provides guidance for the experimental realization of magnonic quantum repeaters and quantum networks and a new route to prepare diverse magnonic quantum states exploiting the photon-to-magnon quantum teleportation.

Title: Optical and electrical probing of plasmonic metal-molecule interactions
Authors: Andrei Stefancu, Wenxuan Tang, Ming Fu, Jordan Edwards, Naomi J. Halas, Ross C. Schofield, Toby Severs Millard, Peter Nordlander, Johannes Lischner, Pilar Carro, Rupert Oulton, Emiliano Cortes
Abstract: Plasmonic nanostructures enable efficient light-to-energy conversion by concentrating optical energy into nanoscale volumes. A key mechanism in this process is chemical interface damping (CID), where surface plasmons are damped by adsorbed molecules, enabling the transfer of charge to adsorbed molecules. In this study, we investigate the relationship between CID and adsorbate-induced changes in DC electrical resistivity for four molecular adsorbates-adenine, 4-aminothiophenol (ATP), biphenyl thiol (BPT), and 1-dodecanethiol (DDT)-on gold surfaces. Our results reveal two distinct CID regimes. BPT causes CID via direct electronic transitions to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), which is centered at approx. 2 eV above the Fermi level and can be resonantly excited by the plasmon. This mechanism is dependent on plasmon energy. In contrast, ATP, adenine and DDT lead to plasmon damping through inelastic electron scattering at the metal-molecule interface. This regime shows a weaker dependency on plasmon energy since it does not involve resonant electron excitation between hybridized metal-molecule states. This same mechanism contributes to adsorbate-induced changes in DC resistivity, suggesting that resistivity measurements can serve as a probe of plasmonic energy transfer, as highlighted by the good correlation between the two effects. These findings provide new insights into the microscopic origins of plasmon damping and offer a unified framework for understanding metal-adsorbate energy transfer.

Title: Hyperfine van der Waals repulsion between open-shell polar molecules
Authors: Etienne F. Walraven, Tijs Karman
Abstract: We describe a novel type of interaction between open-shell polar molecules at sub-millikelvin temperatures. This hyperfine van der Waals interaction occurs between two molecules in two rotational states that differ by one quantum. Normally, this induces resonant dipolar interactions that lead to rapid collisional loss. For specific hyperfine states, however, selection rules prevent this. One can effectively turn off the dipolar interaction by merely flipping a nuclear spin. The resulting van der Waals interaction can be repulsive and can suppress collisional loss. We focus on laser-coolable CaF, but show this effect occurs universally for open-shell molecules, including MgF, SrF, BaF and YO. We propose that this effect could be measured by merging molecules in optical tweezers, where flipping a spin in one of the tweezers enables tuning of collision rates by five orders of magnitude.

Title: Mobility rings in a non-Hermitian non-Abelian quasiperiodic lattice
Authors: Rui-Jie Chen, Guo-Qing Zhang, Zhi Li, Dan-Wei Zhang
Abstract: We study localization and topological properties in spin-1/2 non-reciprocal Aubry-André chain with SU(2) non-Abelian artificial gauge fields. The results reveal that, different from the Abelian case, mobility rings, will emerge in the non-Abelian case accompanied by the non-Hermitian topological phase transition. As the non-Hermitian extension of mobility edges, such mobility rings separate Anderson localized eigenstates from extended eigenstates in the complex energy plane under the periodic boundary condition. Based on the topological properties, we obtain the exact expression of the mobility rings. Furthermore, the corresponding indicators such as inverse participation rate, normalized participation ratio, winding number, non-Hermitian spectral structures and wave functions are numerically studied. The numerical results are in good agreement with the analytical expression, which confirms the emergence of mobility rings.

Title: Comment on "Properties and dynamics of generalized squeezed states"
Authors: Rubén Gordillo, Ricardo Puebla
Abstract: A recent article [S. Ashhab and M. Ayyash, New J. Phys. 27, 054104 (2025)] has reported unexpected oscillatory dynamics in generalized squeezed states of order higher than two as their squeezing parameter increases. This behaviour, observed through numerical simulations using truncated bosonic annihilation and creation operators, appeared in several properties of these states, including their average photon number. The authors argued that these oscillations reflect a genuine physical effect. Here, however, we demonstrate that the observed oscillatory behaviour is a consequence of numerical artefacts. A numerical analysis reveals that the oscillations are highly sensitive to the truncation of the Fock basis, indicating a lack of convergence. This is further supported by a theoretical analysis of the Taylor series of the average photon number, suggesting that these generalized squeezed states contain infinite energy after a finite value of the squeezing parameter. Finally, we provide an analytical proof that the average photon number of any generalized squeezed state is a non-decreasing function, thereby ruling out the possibility of intrinsic oscillatory dynamics. We hope these results help clarify the origin of the reported oscillations and highlight the special care required when dealing with high-order squeezing states.

Title: Hybrid quantum lattice model: Polaritons, photons, and spin waves propagation
Authors: Maritza Ahumada, Natalia Valderrama-Quinteros, Diego Tancara, Guillermo Romero
Abstract: Controlling the propagation of quantum excitations in low-dimensional quantum systems is pivotal for advancing quantum technologies, including communication networks and quantum simulators. We propose a one-dimensional hybrid quantum lattice model comprising coupled cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) units. Each unit integrates a single-mode cavity that interacts with a two-level system (TLS), featuring direct coupling between adjacent TLLs. This configuration enables the coherent propagation of polaritons, spin waves, and photons, depending on the interplay between light-matter coupling and spin-spin interactions. Employing the time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) algorithm, we simulate the dynamics of various excitation configurations and analyze their transport characteristics using local observables. Our analysis reveals the importance of matching impedance and resonance conditions via system parameters for the propagation of different types of excitations or swapping the nature of excitations along the hybrid lattice. These findings offer insight into designing controllable quantum links and single-excitation swaps in low-dimensional quantum systems.

Title: Neural Network-Guided Symbolic Regression for Interpretable Descriptor Discovery in Perovskite Catalysts
Authors: Yeming Xian, Xiaoming Wang, Yanfa Yan
Abstract: Understanding and predicting the activity of oxide perovskite catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) requires descriptors that are both accurate and physically interpretable. While symbolic regression (SR) offers a path to discover such formulas, its performance degrades with high-dimensional inputs and small datasets. We present a two-phase framework that combines neural networks (NN), feature importance analysis, and symbolic regression (SR) to discover interpretable descriptors for OER activity in oxide perovskites. In Phase I, using a small dataset and seven structural features, we reproduce and improve the known {\mu}/t descriptor by engineering composite features and applying symbolic regression, achieving training and validation MAEs of 22.8 and 20.8 meV, respectively. In Phase II, we expand to 164 features, reduce dimensionality, and identify LUMO energy as a key electronic descriptor. A final formula using {\mu}/t, {\mu}/RA, and LUMO energy achieves improved accuracy (training and validation MAEs of 22.1 and 20.6 meV) with strong physical interpretability. Our results demonstrate that NN-guided symbolic regression enables accurate, interpretable, and physically meaningful descriptor discovery in data-scarce regimes, indicating interpretability need not sacrifice accuracy for materials informatics.

Title: Jenga-Krotov algorithm: Efficient compilation of multi-qubit gates for exchange-only qubits
Authors: Jiahao Wu, Guanjie He, Wenyuan Zhuo, Quan Fu, Xin Wang
Abstract: Exchange-only (EO) qubits, implemented in triple-quantum-dot systems, offer a compelling platform for scalable semiconductor-based quantum computing by enabling universal control through purely exchange interactions. While high-fidelity single- and two-qubit gates have been demonstrated, the synthesis of efficient multi-qubit operations -- such as the Toffoli gate -- remains a key bottleneck. Conventional gate decompositions into elementary operations lead to prohibitively long and error-prone pulse sequences, limiting practical deployment. In this work, we introduce a gradient-based optimization algorithm, Jenga-Krotov (JK), tailored to discover compact, high-fidelity EO gate sequences. Applying JK to the Toffoli gate, we reduce the number of required exchange unitaries from 216 (in standard decomposition) to 92, and compress the time steps required from 162 to 50, all while maintaining target fidelity. Under realistic noise, the accumulated gate error from our optimized sequence is an order of magnitude lower than that of conventional approaches. These results demonstrate that the JK algorithm is a general and scalable strategy for multi-qubit gate synthesis in EO architectures, potentially facilitating realization of multi-qubit algorithms on semiconductor platforms.

Title: Estimating the Number of Stable Configurations for the Generalized Thomson Problem
Authors: Matthew Calef, Whitney Griffiths, Alexia Schulz
Abstract: Given a natural number N, one may ask what configuration of N points on the two-sphere minimizes the discrete generalized Coulomb energy. If one applies a gradient-based numerical optimization to this problem, one encounters many configurations that are stable but not globally minimal. This led the authors of this manuscript to the question, how many stable configurations are there? In this manuscript we report methods for identifying and counting observed stable configurations, and estimating the actual number of stable configurations. These estimates indicate that for N approaching two hundred, there are at least tens of thousands of stable configurations.

Title: Particle-wave duality in electrical noise
Authors: Jose-Ignacio Izpura
Abstract: Though electrical noise and conduction current are assigned to corpuscle-like electrons drifting in solid matter, this model hardly fits in the Fluctuation-Dissipation framework. However, fluctuations of energy due to displacements of single electrons between two close conductors lead to a discrete noise model looking like continuous in practice. The complex Admittance it uses for the displacement and conduction currents between such conductors, allows a treatment of fluctuations and dissipations of electrical energy that excels the example of Callen and Welton using the complex Impedance of resistors. The new model thus obtained not only unifies the phase noise of electronic oscillators with the linewidth of lasers, but also explains why the shot noise that the drift theory assigns to conduction currents is not observed.

Title: Effective one-dimension reduction of multi-compartment complex systems dynamics
Authors: Giorgio Vittorio Visco, Johannes Nauta, Tomas Scagliarini, Oriol Artime, Manlio De Domenico
Abstract: A broad class of systems, including ecological, epidemiological, and sociological ones, are characterized by populations of individuals assigned to specific categories, e.g., a chemical species, an opinion or an epidemic state, that are modeled as compartments. Due to interactions and intrinsic dynamics, individuals are allowed to change category, leading to concentrations varying over time with complex behavior, typical of reaction-diffusion systems. While compartmental modeling provides a powerful framework for studying the dynamics of such populations and describe the spatiotemporal evolution of a system, it mostly relies on deterministic mean-field descriptions to deal with systems with many degrees of freedom. Here, we propose a method to alleviate some of the limitations of compartmental models by capitalizing on tools originating from quantum physics to systematically reduce multi-dimensional systems to an effective one-dimensional representation. Using this reduced system, we are able to not only investigate the mean-field dynamics and their critical behavior, but we can additionally study stochastic representations that capture fundamental features of the system. We demonstrate the validity of our formalism by studying the critical behavior of models widely adopted to study epidemic, ecological and economic systems.

Title: Phonon-driven multipolar dynamics in a spin-orbit coupled Mott insulator
Authors: Kathleen Hart, Ruairidh Sutcliffe, Gil Refael, Arun Paramekanti
Abstract: Motivated by advances in pump-probe experiments and light-driven phenomena, we theoretically study the impact of pumped and driven phonons in Mott insulators which host multipole moments, thus going beyond conventional dipolar magnetism. As a case study, we examine pseudospin-1/2 Mott insulators hosting quadrupolar and octupolar moments, and investigate the effect of resonantly exciting ${\cal E}_g$ phonon modes which couple linearly to the quadrupoles. We show that this leads to multipolar precession, with the back action resulting in chiral phonon dynamics below the octupolar phase transition. We further explore the impact of a coherent two-phonon Floquet drive, showing that it can be used to `train' octupolar order or even switch its sign on ultrafast timescales. Our results are obtained combining a generalized Monte Carlo code incorporating phonons with molecular dynamics simulations which numerically integrate the coupled spin-phonon equations of motion. Our work shows how phonon-driven dynamics can be used to probe and control hidden orders in solids.

Title: Perfectly hidden order and Z2 confinement transition in a fully packed monopole liquid
Authors: Attila Szabo, Santiago A. Grigera, P. C. W. Holdsworth, Ludovic D. C. Jaubert, Roderich Moessner, Demian G. Slobinsky, Mauricio Sturla, Rodolfo A. Borzi
Abstract: We investigate a variant of spin ice whose degenerate ground states are densely packed monopole configurations. An applied field drives this model through a Z2 confinement transition. This phase change is a variant of the U(1) Kasteleyn transition, but instead of saturated order the system has fluctuations in the confined phase, and shows critical scaling on both sides of the transition. Remarkably, the magnetic response scales with the critical exponent of the specific heat in the 3D Ising universality class. We prove this universality using a Kramers--Wannier duality to map to an Ising model. The dual order parameter maps back to a non-local string order parameter in the original model, invisible to any local probe. Further, we describe the transition in terms of a bosonic field theory including a pairing term.

Title: Evaluating Metal-Organic Precursors for Focused Ion Beam Induced Deposition through Solid-Layer Decomposition Analysis
Authors: Benedykt R. Jany, Katarzyna Madajska, Aleksandra Butrymowicz-Kubiak, Franciszek Krok, Iwona B. Szymańska
Abstract: The development of modern metal deposition techniques like Focused Ion/Electron Beam Induced Deposition FIBID/FEBID relies heavily on the availability of metal-organic precursors of particular properties. To create a new precursor, extensive testing under specialized gas injection systems is required along with time-consuming and costly chemical analysis typically conducted using scanning electron microscopes. This process can be quite challenging due to its complexity and expense. Here, the response of new metal-organic precursors, in the form of supported thick layers, to the ion beam irradiation is studied through analysis of the chemical composition and morphology of the resulting structures. This is done using SEM BSE/EDX along with Machine Learning data processing techniques. This approach enables a comprehensive fast examination of precursor decomposition processes during FIB irradiation, and provides valuable insights into how the precursor's composition influences the final properties of the metal-rich deposits. Although solid-layer irradiation differs from gas-phase deposition, we think that our method, can be employed to optimize pre-screen and score new potential precursors for FIB applications by significantly reducing the time required and conserving valuable resources.

Title: Vortex to Rotons Transition in Dipolar Bose-Einstein Condensates
Authors: Alberto Villois, Miguel Onorato, Davide Proment
Abstract: Recent experimental advancements enabled the creation of various systems exhibiting superfluid behavior, with one notable achievement being the development of dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates (dBECs). When confined along one or more spatial dimensions, these condensates exhibit a dispersion relation reminiscent of superfluid liquid helium, featuring a roton-like minimum. This study investigates the existence of two-dimensional solitary waves in dBECs characterised by topological defects (quantised vortices) and their transition to vortex-free Jones-Roberts solitons. The explicit connection between solitary waves and roton excitation is demonstrated, supporting Feynman's hypothesis regarding the nature of rotons as fading vortex excitations.

Title: A geometric condition for robot-swarm cohesion and cluster-flock transition
Authors: Mathias Casiulis, Eden Arbel, Charlotte van Waes, Yoav Lahini, Stefano Martiniani, Naomi Oppenheimer, Matan Yah Ben Zion
Abstract: We present a geometric design rule for size-controlled clustering of self-propelled particles. We show that active particles that tend to rotate under an external force have an intrinsic, signed parameter with units of curvature which we call curvity, that can be derived from first principles. Experiments with robots and numerical simulations show that properties of individual robots (radius and curvity) control pair cohesion in a binary system, and the stability of flocking and self-limiting clustering in a swarm, with applications in meta-materials and in embodied decentralized control.

Title: RECP pairing mechanisms and universality in the phase diagram of high-TC cuprates
Authors: Felix A. Buot, Danilo Yanga, Roland E. S. Otadoy, Unofre Pili
Abstract: Our novel strong pairing mechanism for high-T_{C} cuprates is introduced via a quantum-information theoretic language. It is based on the quantum entanglement and confinement (or measure of entanglement). There, the resonance concept comes in the form of the equality relations between the entanglement entropy of formations. This can be considered a generalization of Anderson's resonating valence bonds (RVB) theory where the crucial modification lies in the doping-dependent directed long-range entanglement and confinement pairing mechanisms rather than a local nearest neighbor (valence bond) of "directed dimer" configurational states forming the RVB. The RVB is really a two nearest "qubit" entanglement characterized by a constant pairing potential determined by a superexchange J. Because RVB is limited to nearest neighbor bonding, it is limited to singlet pairings and therefore lacks the flexibility of our new pairing mechanism which includes both the triplet and singlet pairings. We refer to our new theory as a resonating entanglement-confinement pair (RECP) theory. Based on RECP theory, we are able to give a conceptual, phenomenological, qualitative and comprehensive explanation of the whole phase diagram of high-T_{C} cuprates, both for hole-doped and electron-doped giving a universality feature of the hole-pairing mechanism in cuprates.

Title: Granular segregation across flow geometries: a closure model for the particle segregation velocity
Authors: Yifei Duan, Lu Jing, Paul B. Umbanhowar, Julio M. Ottino, Richard M. Lueptow
Abstract: Predicting particle segregation has remained challenging due to the lack of a general model for the segregation velocity that is applicable across a range of granular flow geometries. Here, a segregation velocity model for dense granular flows is developed by exploiting momentum balance and recent advances in particle-scale modelling of the segregation driving and drag forces over a wide range of particle concentrations, size and density ratios, and flow conditions. This model is shown to correctly predict particle segregation velocity in a diverse set of idealized and natural granular flow geometries simulated using the discrete element method. When incorporated in the well-established advection-diffusion-segregation formulation, the model has the potential to accurately capture segregation phenomena in many relevant industrial application and geophysical settings.

Title: Variational Scarring in Graphene Quantum Dots
Authors: J. Keski-Rahkonen, C. Zou, A.M. Graf, Q. Yao, T. Zhu, J. Velasco Jr., E.J. Heller
Abstract: A quantum eigenstate of a classically chaotic system is referred as scarred by an unstable periodic orbit if its probability density is concentrated in the vicinity of that orbit. Recently, a new class of scarring - variational scarring - was discovered in numerical studies of disordered quantum dots, arising from near-degeneracies in the quantum spectrum associated with classical resonances of the unperturbed system. Despite the increasing body of theoretical evidence on variational scarring, its experimental observation has remained out of reach. Motivated by this dearth, we argue and demonstrate that variational scarring can occur in an elliptical quantum dot fabricated on monolayer graphene, and locally perturbed by a nanotip. Then, we further show that the fingerprint of these variational scars can potentially be detected via scanning tunneling microscopy, thus offering an attractive experimental pathway for the first validation of this puzzling quantum-chaotic phenomenon.

Title: Long-range order in two-dimensional systems with fluctuating active stresses
Authors: Yann-Edwin Keta, Silke Henkes
Abstract: In two-dimensional tissues, such as developing germ layers, pair-wise forces (or active stresses) arise from the contractile activity of the cytoskeleton, with dissipation provided by the three-dimensional surroundings. We show analytically how these pair-wise stochastic forces, unlike the particle-wise independent fluctuating forces usually considered in active matter systems, produce conserved centre-of-mass dynamics and so are able to damp large-wavelength displacement fluctuations in elastic systems. A consequence of this is the stabilisation of long-range translational order in two dimensions, in clear violation of the celebrated Mermin-Wagner theorem, and the emergence of hyperuniformity with a structure factor $S(q) \sim q^2$ in the $q \to 0$ limit. We then introduce two numerical cell tissue models which feature these pair-wise active forces. First a vertex model, in which the cell tissue is represented by a tiling of polygons where the edges represent cell junctions and with activity provided by stochastic junctional contractions. Second an active disk model, derived from active Brownian particles, but with pairs of equal and opposite stochastic forces between particles. We study the melting transition of these models and find a first-order phase transition between an ordered and a disordered phase in the disk model with active stresses. We confirm our analytical prediction of long-range order in both numerical models and show that hyperuniformity survives in the disordered phase, thus constituting a hidden order in our model tissue. Owing to the generality of this mechanism, we expect our results to be testable in living organisms, and to also apply to artificial systems with the same symmetry.

Title: Utilizing a machine-learned potential to explore enhanced radiation tolerance in the MoNbTaVW high-entropy alloy
Authors: Jiahui Liu, Jesper Byggmastar, Zheyong Fan, Bing Bai, Ping Qian, Yanjing Su
Abstract: High-entropy alloys (HEAs) based on tungsten (W) have emerged as promising candidates for plasma-facing components in future fusion reactors, owing to their excellent irradiation resistance. In this study, we construct an efficient machine-learned interatomic potential for the MoNbTaVW quinary system. This potential achieves computational speeds comparable to the embedded-atom method (EAM) potential, allowing us to conduct a comprehensive investigation of the primary radiation damage through molecular dynamics simulations. Threshold displacement energies (TDEs) in the MoNbTaVW HEA are investigated and compared with pure metals. A series of displacement cascade simulations at primary knock-on atom energies ranging from 10 to 150 keV reveal significant differences in defect generation and clustering between MoNbTaVW HEA and pure W. In HEAs, we observe more surviving Frenkel pairs (FPs) but fewer and smaller interstitial clusters compared to W, indicating superior radiation tolerance. We propose extended damage models to quantify the radiation dose in the MoNbTaVW HEA, and suggest that one reason for their enhanced resistance is subcascade splitting, which reduces the formation of interstitial clusters. Our findings provide critical insights into the fundamental irradiation resistance mechanisms in refractory body-centered cubic alloys, offering guidance for the design of future radiation-tolerant materials.

Title: $SU(N)$ spin-phonon simulations of Floquet dynamics in spin $S > 1/2$ Mott insulators
Authors: Ruairidh Sutcliffe, Kathleen Hart, Gil Refael, Arun Paramekanti
Abstract: The dynamics of magnetic moments coupled to phonons is of great interest for understanding spin transport in solids as well as for our ability to control magnetism via tailored phonon modes. For spin $S > 1/2$, spin-orbit coupling permits an unusual linear coupling of phonons to quadrupolar moments, so that phonons act as a dynamical transverse field for the spins. Here, we develop a generalized $SU(N)$ spin-phonon Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics technique to simulate the equilibrium and nonequilibrium properties of such spin-orbital-phonon coupled Mott insulators, and apply it to a spin-1 model with competing XY antiferromagnet (AFM) and quadrupolar paramagnet (QPM) phases which is relevant to the Mott insulator $\rm{Ba_2FeSi_2O_7}$. We uncover a rich variety of dynamical phenomena in this system induced by linear or chiral phonon drives, including the generation of a uniform magnetization in the QPM and AFM, strengthening of Néel order and gapping of the AFM Nambu-Goldstone mode by Floquet-Ising anisotropy, a non-equilibrium QPM to AFM transition, and creation of Floquet copies of transverse and longitudinal spin waves. Our work is relevant for driven spin-1 magnets, such as $\rm{Ba_2FeSi_2O_7}$, and we highlight broader implications for nonequilibrium multipolar magnetism.

Title: Edge-Edge Correlations without Edge-States: $η$-clustering State as Ground State of the Extended Attractive SU(3) Hubbard Chain
Authors: Hironobu Yoshida, Niclas Heinsdorf, Hosho Katsura
Abstract: We explore the phase diagram of the extended attractive SU($3$) Hubbard chain with two-body hopping and nearest-neighbor attraction at half-filling. In the large on-site attraction limit, we identify three different phases: phase separation (PS), Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL), and charge density wave (CDW). Our analysis reveals that the $\eta$-clustering state, a three-component generalization of the $\eta$-pairing state, becomes the ground state at the boundary between the PS and TLL phases. On an open chain, this state exhibits an edge-edge correlation, which we call boundary off-diagonal long-range order (bODLRO). Using the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method, we numerically study the phase diagram of the model with large but finite on-site interactions and find that the numerical results align with those obtained in the strong coupling limit.

Title: Manipulation of topology by electric field in breathing kagome lattice
Authors: Yu Xie, Ke Ji, Jun He, Xiaofan Shen, Dinghui Wang, Junting Zhang
Abstract: Magnetic kagome lattices have attracted much attention recently due to the interplay of band topology with magnetism and electronic correlations, which give rise to a variety of exotic quantum states. A common structural distortion of the kagome lattice is the breathing mode, which can significantly influence the magnetism and band characteristics. However, the modulation of breathing mode and the associated topological phenomena remain rarely explored. Here, we demonstrate that the coupling of breathing modes with ferroelectricity, magnetism, and band topology in the M3X8 monolayer system enables electric field manipulation of topological spin structure and electronic states. The breathing mode mainly occurs in materials containing early 4d/5d transition metal elements and can be reversed or even suppressed via ferroelectric switching in low-barrier materials. Importantly, electric field-induced switching of the breathing mode can alter the chirality of the topological spin structure, or trigger a transition from a topological trivial insulator to a Chern insulator. This work paves the way for exploring novel physical phenomena driven by breathing modes in kagome materials.

Title: Vortices in D-dimensional anisotropic Bose-Einstein condensates: dimensional perturbation theory with hypercylindrical symmetry
Authors: Maria Isabelle Fite, B. A. McKinney
Abstract: We investigate D-dimensional atomic Bose-Einstein condensates in a hypercylindrical trap with a vortex core along the z-axis and quantized circulation $\hbar m$. We analytically approximate the hypercylindrical Gross-Pitaevskii equation using dimensional perturbation theory with perturbation parameter $\delta=1/(D+2|m|-d)$, \textcolor{black}{where $d$ controls the contribution of kinetic energy at zeroth order}. We derive the zeroth-order ($\delta \to 0$) semiclassical approximations for the condensate energy, density, chemical potential, and critical vortex rotation speed in arbitrary dimensions. We investigate the effect of trap anisotropy on lower effective dimensionality and compute properties of vortices in higher dimensions motivated by the study of synthetic dimensions and holographic duality, where a higher-dimensional gravitational model corresponds to a lower-dimensional quantum model. In the zeroth-order approximation, we observe crossings between energy levels for different dimensions as a function of interaction strength and anisotropy parameters.

Title: Entanglement induced by Heisenberg exchange between an electron in a nested quantum dot and a qubit with relative motion
Authors: Lee-Che Lin, Seng Ghee Tan, Ching-Ray Chang, Shih-Jye Sun, Son-Hsien Chen
Abstract: We propose a nested quantum dot structure for improved control of entanglement induced by the Heisenberg exchange between an electron and a qubit with relative motion. The entanglement is quantified by the mutual information (MI). The electron, initially prepared in the ground state, generally produces greater entanglement when excited to the scattering state compared to remaining in the bound state. In the bound state, the final entanglement oscillates as a function of the qubit speed and can be tuned accordingly. In the case of long-range interaction, the normalized exchange distribution leads to substantial final entanglement, independent of the qubit moving direction, indicating that even very weak but prolonged exchange can still generate significant entanglement. In the case of short-range interaction, different moving directions lead to varying MI values. We also consider the scenario without the nested dot and find that the same maximum (among all times) MI is pre-determined solely by the initial angle between the spins. In this case, the entanglement exhibits different growth characteristics during different phases. The saturation of the MI mimics that of a strict zero-dimensional quantum dot, where exchange and time are combined into a single parameter, the amount of interaction.

Title: Large Deviations in Switching Diffusion: from Free Cumulants to Dynamical Transitions
Authors: Mathis Guéneau, Satya N. Majumdar, Gregory Schehr
Abstract: We study the diffusion of a particle with a time-dependent diffusion constant $D(t)$ that switches between random values drawn from a distribution $W(D)$ at a fixed rate $r$. Using a renewal approach, we compute exactly the moments of the position of the particle $\langle x^{2n}(t) \rangle$ at any finite time $t$, and for any $W(D)$ with finite moments $\langle D^n \rangle$. For $t \gg 1$, we demonstrate that the cumulants $\langle x^{2n}(t) \rangle_c$ grow linearly with $t$ and are proportional to the free cumulants of a random variable distributed according to $W(D)$. For specific forms of $W(D)$, we compute the large deviations of the position of the particle, uncovering rich behaviors and dynamical transitions of the rate function $I(y=x/t)$. Our analytical predictions are validated numerically with high precision, achieving accuracy up to $10^{-2000}$.

Title: Twist, splay, and uniform domains in ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals
Authors: Maxim O. Lavrentovich, Priyanka Kumari, Oleg D. Lavrentovich
Abstract: The newly-discovered ferroelectric nematic liquid crystal exhibits a variety of unique defect phenomena. The depolarization field in the material favors spontaneous spatial variations in polarization, manifesting in diverse forms such as bulk twists and arrangements of alternating polarization domains. The configuration of these domains is governed by a balance between depolarization field reduction and molecular alignment at interfaces. We investigate a ferroelectric nematic confined in a thin cell with apolar surface anchoring, patterned using photoalignment. Under uniform planar alignment, the system forms stripes, while a radial +1 defect pattern results in pie-slice domains. Neighboring domains show either opposite directions of uniform polarization (thin cells) or opposite handedness of the spontaneous twist (thick cells). Our calculations and experiments demonstrate that electrostatic interactions tend to shrink domain size, whereas elastic and surface anchoring effects promote larger domains. In this work, we make predictions and measurements of the domain size as a function of cell thickness, and show that ionic screening suppresses domain formation.

Title: Random Transverse Field Effects on Magnetic Noise in Spin Systems
Authors: Yufei Pei, Claudio Castelnovo, Roderich Moessner
Abstract: Motivated by experimental developments in non-Kramers spin ice materials and the unclear role of disorder therein, we study the impact of random transverse fields on the dynamics of correlated magnetic systems. We model the effect of dilute, randomly placed transverse fields on quantities such as magnetic noise/susceptibility and the diffusivity of topological excitations. We consider a random ferromagnetic Ising chain (RTFIC) as well as three-dimensional spin ice. At low temperatures, both exhibit (sub-)diffusive defect dynamics, i.e., of domain walls and magnetic monopoles, respectively. Introducing sparse transverse fields leads to the emergence of an additional timescale on the order of the single-spin flip time. We develop a Lindbladian framework that combines Monte Carlo simulations and exact diagonalization which allows us to characterize the dynamics and develop an analytical understanding of the phenomenon. This framework can be benchmarked in detail for the RTFIC. Our findings provide insights into the magnetization dynamics of disordered non-Kramers oxides, such as oxygen-diluted Ho$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$, and offer a framework for interpreting experimental observations in these systems.

Title: Strain-induced nonrelativistic altermagnetic spin splitting effect
Authors: Wancheng Zhang, Mingkun Zheng, Yong Liu, Zhenhua Zhang, Rui Xiong, Zhihong Lu
Abstract: Recent studies reveal that $\mathcal{T}$-odd spin currents generated via the nonrelativistic altermagnetic spin splitting effect (ASSE) exhibit significant potential for spintronics applications, with both computational and experimental validations. Addressing the scarcity of conductive altermagnets, we propose strain engineering as a reliable method for inducing altermagnetism. Focusing on rutile-structured $\mathrm{OsO}_2$, first-principles calculations show that minor equibiaxial tensile strain ($\mathcal{E}_{\mathrm{ts}}$=3\%) induces nonmagnetic-to-altermagnetic transitions, achieving an ASSE-driven spin-charge conversion ratio ($\theta_{\text{AS}}$) of $\sim$7\% -- far surpassing conventional spin Hall angles ($\theta_{\text{IS}}$). Calculations reveal that substantial $\theta_{\text{AS}}$ persists even in the absence of spin-orbit coupling, with its magnitude positively correlating to nonrelativistic spin splitting magnitude, which further confirms the strain-induced ASSE's nonrelativistic origin. Further investigation reveals that $\mathrm{RuO}_2$ exhibits analogous phenomena, which may resolve recent controversies regarding its magnetic properties. Our research opens new simple pathways for developing next-generation altermagnetic spintronic devices.

Title: BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4$)$_2$: Strong Kitaev, After All
Authors: Pavel A. Maksimov, Shengtao Jiang, L. P. Regnault, A. L. Chernyshev
Abstract: The inelastic neutron scattering results and their analysis unequivocally point to a dominant Kitaev interaction in the honeycomb-lattice cobaltate BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4$)$_2$. Our anisotropic-exchange model closely describes $all$ available neutron scattering data in the material's field-polarized phase. The density-matrix renormalization group results for our model are in close accord with the unusual double-zigzag magnetic order and the low in-plane saturation field of BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4$)$_2$.

Title: SymPlex Plots for Visualizing Properties in High-Dimensional Alloy Spaces
Authors: John Cavin, Pravan Omprakash, Adrien Couet, Rohan Mishra
Abstract: Conventional visualization tools such as phase diagrams and convex hulls are ill-suited to visualize multiple principal element alloys (MPEAs) due to their large compositional space that cannot be easily projected onto two dimensions. Here, SymPlex plots are introduced to enable the visualization of various properties along special paths in high-dimensional phase spaces of MPEAs. These are polar heatmaps that plot properties along high-symmetry paths radiating from the parent equimolar MPEA to a set of chosen lower-order compositions. SymPlex plots capture the changes in the energy landscape along the special paths and help visualize the effect of addition or substitution of components on the alloy stability, which can be especially useful to assess processing pathways for additive manufacturing. Thus, SymPlex plots can help guide design of MPEAs by showing connections between compositions and their properties in the high-dimensional phase space with more information concentrated near the equimolar region.

Title: Spin bond order driven by extended repulsive interactions in doped graphene
Authors: Jin-Ju Ri, Song-Jin O, Chol-Su O
Abstract: We use the truncated-unity functional renormalization group (TUFRG) to study many-body instabilities of correlated electrons in graphene doped near the van Hove singularity (VHS). The system is described by an extended Hubbard model including several Coulomb repulsions between neighboring sites. With the repulsion parameters, which turn out to be suitable for low-energy consideration of graphene, we find a spin-bond-order phase in the vicinity of the VHS. This phase gives way to a spin-density-wave phase when involving a weak additional screening. The ground-state phase diagram is presented in the space of the doping level and the screening parameter. We describe in detail both of these spin-ordered states by using recently developed TUFRG + MF scheme, i.e., a combined approach of TUFRG and mean-field (MF) theory. The collinear states are energetically preferable in both cases of the spin bond order and the spin-density wave. But if the third-nearest-neighbor hopping is absent, these spin orders become chiral. The band structures of two collinear spin-ordered states are presented, revealing the metallic behavior of the system.

Title: Tuning of altermagnetism by strain
Authors: M. Khodas, Sai Mu, I. I. Mazin, K. D. Belashchenko
Abstract: For all collinear altermagnets, we sort out piezomagnetic free-energy invariants allowed in the nonrelativistic limit and relativistic piezomagnetic invariants bilinear in the Néel vector $\mathbf{L}$ and magnetization $\mathbf{M}$, which include strain-induced Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. The symmetry-allowed responses are fully determined by the nonrelativistic spin Laue group. In the nonrelativistic limit, two distinct mechanisms are discussed: the band-filling mechanism, which exists in metals and is illustrated using the simple two-dimensional Lieb lattice model, and the temperature-dependent exchange-driven mechanism, which is illustrated using first-principles calculations for transition-metal fluorides. The leading second-order nonrelativistic term in the strain-induced magnetization is also obtained for CrSb. Piezomagnetism due to the strain-induced Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction is calculated from first principles for transition-metal fluorides, MnTe, and CrSb. Finally, we discuss triplet superconducting correlations supported by altermagnets and protected by inversion rather than time-reversal symmetry. We apply the nonrelativistic classification of Cooper pairs to describe the interplay between strain and superconductivity in the two-dimensional Lieb lattice and in bulk rutile structures. We show that triplet superconductivity is, on average, unitary in an unstrained altermagnet, but becomes non-unitary under piezomagnetically active strain.

Title: Breakup of an active chiral fluid
Authors: Luke Neville, Jens Eggers, Tanniemola B. Liverpool
Abstract: We consider the nonlinear dynamics governing the breakup of a two-dimensional strip of active chiral fluid, finding that the strip thickness goes to zero at the pinch points as a power law in finite time. Using slender body theory combined with a scaling analysis, we predict new anomalous scaling exponents and functions characterizing the speed and shape of breakup. The scaling analysis is shown to be in excellent agreement with numerical simulations of the hydrodynamic equations.

Title: Antiferromagnetism and Tightly Bound Cooper Pairs Induced by Kinetic Frustration
Authors: Yixin Zhang, Cristian Batista, Yang Zhang
Abstract: Antiferromagnetism and superconductivity are often viewed as competing orders in correlated electron systems. Here, we demonstrate that kinetic frustration in hole motion facilitates their coexistence within the square-lattice repulsive Hubbard model. Combining exact analytical solutions on tailored geometries with large-scale numerical simulations, we reveal a robust pairing mechanism: holes on opposite sublattices behave as if they carry opposite effective charges due to spin singlet formation from kinetic frustration. This emergent property suppresses phase separation and fosters a coherent $d$-wave superconducting channel embedded within a long-range antiferromagnetic background. Our findings establish a minimal yet broadly applicable framework for stabilizing strong-coupling superconductivity in doped Mott insulators.

Title: Topological Transitions in Orbital-Symmetry-Controlled Chemical Reactions
Authors: Ziren Xie, Amir Mirzanejad, Lukas Muechler
Abstract: Topological band theory has transformed our understanding of crystalline materials by classifying the connectivity and crossings of electronic energy levels. Extending these concepts to molecular systems has therefore attracted significant interest. Reactions governed by orbital symmetry conservation are ideal candidates, as they classify pathways as symmetry-allowed or symmetry-forbidden depending on whether molecular orbitals cross along the reaction coordinate. However, the presence of strong electronic correlations in these reactions invalidate the framework underlying topological band theory, preventing direct generalization. Here, we introduce a formalism in terms of Green's functions to classify orbital symmetry controlled reactions even in the presence of strong electronic correlations. Focusing on prototypical 4$\pi$ electrocyclizations, we show that symmetry-forbidden pathways are characterized by crossings of Green's function zeros, in stark contrast to the crossings of poles as predicted by molecular-orbital theory. We introduce a topological invariant that identifies these symmetry protected crossings of both poles and zeros along a reaction coordinate and outline generalizations of our approach to reactions without any conserved spatial symmetries along the reaction path. Our work lays the groundwork for systematic application of modern topological methods to chemical reactions and can be extended to reactions involving different spin states or excited states.

Title: Non-Relativistic Anisotropic Magnetoresistance with Collinear and Non-Collinear Magnetic Order
Authors: Philipp Ritzinger, Ondřej Sedláček, Jakub Železný, Karel Výborný
Abstract: Anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) arises from symmetry lowering of the conductivity tensor induced by magnetic order. In simple ferromagnets, AMR is a relativistic effect, relying on spin-orbit interaction (SOC). Here, we demonstrate that a comparable symmetry lowering can also occur in a non-relativistic limit. Using tight-binding models, density functional theory calculations, and Boltzmann transport theory, we investigate systems with multiple magnetic sublattices, including both collinear and non-collinear antiferromagnets, as well as ferrimagnetic configurations. We show that AMR and related anisotropies can emerge purely from magnetic order, without the need for SOC, and may reach significant magnitudes. The findings are supported by case studies on toy-model lattices and real materials such as MnN, Mn$_3$Sn, and are further interpreted using a symmetry analysis based on Neumann's principle. Material candidates that exhibit non-relativistic anisotropic magnetoresistance are identified by symmetry analysis applied to entries in the MAGNDATA database.

Title: Universal Diagnostic Criterion for Intrinsic Superconducting Diode Effect
Authors: Ran Wang, Ning Hao
Abstract: The intrinsic superconducting diode effect (SDE) is distinguished from the Josephson diode effect (JDE) by its manifestation of nonreciprocal critical current phenomena within a monolithic superconductor, typically linked to finite-momentum Cooper pairing. The long-standing assumption that SDE requires co-breaking of time-reversal and inversion symmetries proves to be necessary but not sufficient. In this work, we propose a universal diagnostic criterion. Embodied in two concise inequalities, this criterion enables convenient and intuitive assessment of whether an intrinsic SDE can emerge in a given system without requiring extensive numerical calculations. Furthermore, our universal criterion provides explicit design guidelines for material systems exhibiting intrinsic SDE.

Title: A Semi-Empirical Descriptor for Open Circuit Voltage
Authors: Sourav Baiju, Konstantin Köster, Mark Huijben, Payam Kaghazhi
Abstract: Layered transition metal oxides (TMO) are widely used as cathode materials in Na/Li batteries. The open-circuit voltage (OCV), which determines the energy density (together with capacity), is among the key physical and chemical factors influencing the performance of cathodes. The shape of the voltage profile is also influenced by the formation energy of intermediate phases during cycling. From a theoretical perspective, the formation energy (and voltage) are defined as internal energy differences between phases. Therefore, an accurate prediction of internal energy is crucial for the calculation of OCV. In this work, we present a theoretical framework that decomposes the internal energy of a given TMO into distinct contributions with clear physical significance. Specifically, we break down the energy into parameters that can be more easily calculated (compared to DFT) and obtained from experimental databases. From these parameters, we define a potential term that can be calculated for different compositions, and can be used for calculation of voltage profile

Title: Phase analysis of Ising machines and their implications on optimization
Authors: Shu Zhou, K. Y. Michael Wong, Juntao Wang, David Shui Wing Hui, Daniel Ebler, Jie Sun
Abstract: Ising machines, which are dynamical systems designed to operate in a parallel and iterative manner, have emerged as a new paradigm for solving combinatorial optimization problems. Despite computational advantages, the quality of solutions depends heavily on the form of dynamics and tuning of parameters, which are in general set heuristically due to the lack of systematic insights. Here, we focus on optimal Ising machine design by analyzing phase diagrams of spin distributions in the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model. We find that that the ground state can be achieved in the phase where the spin distribution becomes binary, and optimal solutions are produced where the binary phase and gapless phase coexist. Our analysis shows that such coexistence phase region can be expanded by carefully placing a digitization operation, giving rise to a family of superior Ising machines, as illustrated by the proposed algorithm digCIM.

Title: Beyond-mean-field fluctuations for the solution of constraint satisfaction problems
Authors: Niklas Foos, Bastian Epping, Jannik Grundler, Alexandru Ciobanu, Ajainderpal Singh, Tim Bode, Moritz Helias, David Dahmen
Abstract: Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs) lie at the heart of complexity theory and find application in a plethora of prominent tasks ranging from cryptography to genetics. Classical approaches use Hopfield networks to find approximate solutions while recently, modern machine-learning techniques like graph neural networks have become popular for this task. In this study, we employ the known mapping of MAX-2-SAT, a class of CSPs, to a spin-glass system from statistical physics, and use Glauber dynamics to approximately find its ground state, which corresponds to the optimal solution of the underlying problem. We show that Glauber dynamics outperforms the traditional Hopfield-network approach and can compete with state-of-the-art solvers. A systematic theoretical analysis uncovers the role of stochastic fluctuations in finding CSP solutions: even in the absense of thermal fluctuations at $T=0$ a significant portion of spins, which correspond to the CSP variables, attains an effective spin-dependent non-zero temperature. These spins form a subspace in which the stochastic Glauber dynamics continuously performs flips to eventually find better solutions. This is possible since the energy is degenerate, such that spin flips in this free-spin space do not require energy. Our theoretical analysis leads to new deterministic solvers that effectively account for such fluctuations, thereby reaching state-of-the-art performance.

Title: Reviving the Search for Indium-Based Superconductors: Theoretical Prediction of Semimetallic Superconductivity in Cubic Nd$_3$In
Authors: Arafat Rahman, Alamgir Kabir, Tareq Mahmud
Abstract: The quest for materials that simultaneously exhibit superconductivity and non trivial topology has drawn significant attention in recent years, driven by their potential to host exotic quantum states. Their unique coexistence often leads to rich physics and potential applications in quantum technologies. Here, we predict cubic Nd$_3$In as an exceptional candidate in this class, combining strong-coupling superconductivity with distinctive topological features. Using first-principles calculations, we find that the strong-coupling superconductivity in Nd$_3$In arises primarily due to pronounced Fermi surface nesting, leading to an electron-phonon coupling constant of $\lambda = 1.39$. Our fully anisotropic Migdal--Eliashberg analysis yields a superconducting transition temperature $T_c \approx 14$ K at ambient pressure, increasing to 18 K under 15 GPa. Beyond superconductivity, Nd$_3$In is found to be a Weyl semimetal, as evidenced by the presence of Fermi arcs and nontrivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariants, confirming its topological nature. The combination of strong-coupling superconductivity and nontrivial topological states makes Nd$_3$In a promising candidate for quantum transport and topological quantum computation.

Title: Interplay of short-range bond order and A-type antiferromagnetic order in metallic triangular lattice GdZn$_3$P$_3$
Authors: Jiesen Guo, Fan Yang, Yuzhou He, Xinyang Liu, Zheng Deng, Qinghua Zhang, Xiancheng Wang, Xianlei Sheng, Wei Li, Changqing Jin, Kan Zhao
Abstract: We investigate a hexagonal ScAl$_3$C$_3$-type antiferromagnet GdZn$_3$P$_3$ single crystal. Compared with antiferromagnetic topological material EuM$_2$X$_2$ (M=Zn, Cd; X=P, As), the GdZn$_3$P$_3$ features an additional ZnP$_3$ trigonal planar units. Notably, single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that Zn and P atoms within trigonal planar layer exhibit significant anisotropic displacement parameters with a space group of P63/mmc. Meanwhile, scanning transmission electron microscopy experiment demonstrates the presence of interstitial P atoms above and below the ZnP honeycomb lattice, suggesting potential ZnP bond instability within the ZnP$_3$ trigonal layers. Concerning the triangular Gd$^{3+}$ layer, the magnetic susceptibility $\chi$$(T)$ and heat capacity measurements reveal long-range antiferromagnetic order at T$_N$ = 4.5 K. Below T$_N$, the in-plane $\chi$$(T)$ is nearly 4 times the $\chi$$(T)$ along $c$ axis, indicative of strong magnetic anisotropy. The Curie Weiss fitting to the low temperature $\chi$$(T)$ data reveals ferromagnetic interaction ($\theta$$_{CW}$ = 5.2 K) in ab-plane, and antiferromagnetic interaction ($\theta$$_{CW}$ = -1 K) along c axis, suggesting the ground state as an A-type antiferromagnetic order. Correspondingly, the density function theory calculation shows that GdZn$_3$P$_3$ is an indirect semiconductor with a band gap 0.27 eV, supported by the resistivity measurement on polycrystal sample. Interestingly, the GdZn$_3$P$_3$ single crystal exhibits metallic conductivity with an anomaly at T$_N$, likely associated with the observation of interstitial P atoms mentioned above. Therefore, our results establish GdZn$_3$P$_3$ system as a concrete example for investigating the coupling between charge carrier and triangular lattice magnetism in the two-dimensional lattice framework, on the background of short-range bond order.

Title: Line Defects in Fermionic CFTs
Authors: Simone Giombi, Elizabeth Helfenberger, Himanshu Khanchandani
Abstract: We study line defects in the fermionic CFTs in the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa universality class in dimensions $2<d<4$. These CFTs may be described as the IR fixed points of the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa (GNY) model in $d=4-\epsilon$, or as the UV fixed points of the Gross-Neveu (GN) model, which can be studied using the large $N$ expansion in $2<d<4$. These models admit natural line defects obtained by integrating over a line either the scalar field in the GNY description, or the fermion bilinear operator in the GN description. We compute the beta function for the defect RG flow using both the epsilon expansion and the large $N$ approach, and find IR stable fixed points for the defect coupling, thus providing evidence for a non-trivial IR DCFT. We also compute some of the DCFT observables at the fixed point, and check that the $g$-function associated with the circular defect is consistent with the $g$-theorem for the defect RG flow.

Title: Transversality-Enforced Tight-Binding Model for 3D Photonic Crystals aided by Topological Quantum Chemistry
Authors: Antonio Morales-Pérez, Chiara Devescovi, Yoonseok Hwang, Mikel García-Díez, Barry Bradlyn, Juan Luis Mañes, Maia G. Vergniory, Aitzol García-Etxarri
Abstract: Tight-binding models can accurately predict the band structure and topology of crystalline systems and they have been heavily used in solid-state physics due to their versatility and low computational cost. It is quite straightforward to build an accurate tight-binding model of any crystalline system using the maximally localized Wannier functions of the crystal as a basis. In 1D and 2D photonic crystals, it is possible to express the wave equation as two decoupled scalar eigenproblems where finding a basis of maximally localized Wannier functions is feasible using standard Wannierization methods. Unfortunately, in 3D photonic crystals, the vectorial nature of the electromagnetic solutions cannot be avoided. This precludes the construction of a basis of maximally localized Wannier functions via usual techniques. In this work, we show how to overcome this problem by using topological quantum chemistry which will allow us to express the band structure of the photonic crystal as a difference of elementary band representations. This can be achieved by the introduction of a set of auxiliary modes, as recently proposed by Soljačić et. al., which regularize the $\Gamma$-point obstruction arising from transversality constraint of the Maxwell equations. The decomposition into elementary band representations allows us to isolate a set of pseudo-orbitals that permit us to construct an accurate transversality-enforced tight-binding model (TETB) that matches the dispersion, symmetry content, and topology of the 3D photonic crystal under study. Moreover, we show how to introduce the effects of a gyrotropic bias in the framework, modeled via non-minimal coupling to a static magnetic field. Our work provides the first systematic method to analytically model the photonic bands of the lowest transverse modes over the entire BZ via a TETB model.

Title: On-chip microwave coherent source with in-situ control of the photon number distribution
Authors: Pasquale Mastrovito, Halima Giovanna Ahmad, Alberto Porzio, Martina Esposito, Davide Massarotti, Francesco Tafuri
Abstract: Coherent photon sources are key elements in different applications, ranging from quantum sensing to quantum computing. The possibility of designing and engineering superconducting circuits behaving like artificial atoms supports the realization of quantum optics protocols, including microwave photons generation. Here we propose and theoretically investigate a design that allows a tunable photon injection directly on-chip. Our approach enables control of the emission via an external knob while preserving, in principle, the stability and linewidth characteristics. This is achieved by replacing the conventional capacitive link between the source and the reservoir with a tunable coupler, with the advantage of avoiding direct dynamical manipulation of the photon source dynamics, providing pulsed control of the emission. We validate the dynamical control of the generated state under the effect of an external flux threading the tunable coupler and discuss the possibility of employing this scheme also in the context of multiple bosonic reservoirs.

Authors: Ken Kikuchi, Kah-Sen Kam, Fu-Hsiang Huang
Abstract: We discuss anyon condensation in mixed-state topological order. The phases were recently conjectured to be classified by pre-modular fusion categories. Just like anyon condensation in pure-state topological order, a bootstrap analysis shows condensable anyons are given by connected étale algebras. We explain how to perform generic anyon condensation including non-invertible anyons and successive condensations. Interestingly, some condensations lead to pure-state topological orders. We clarify when this happens. We also compute topological invariants of equivalence classes.

Title: Critical spin models from holographic disorder
Authors: Dimitris Saraidaris, Alexander Jahn
Abstract: Discrete models of holographic dualities, typically modeled by tensor networks on hyperbolic tilings, produce quantum states with a characteristic quasiperiodic disorder not present in continuum holography. In this work, we study the behavior of XXZ spin chains with such symmetries, showing that lessons learned from previous non-interacting (matchgate) tensor networks generalize to more generic Hamiltonians under holographic disorder: While the disorder breaks translation invariance, site-averaged correlations and entanglement of the disorder-free critical phase are preserved at a plateau of nonzero disorder even at large system sizes. In particular, we show numerically that the entanglement entropy curves in this disordered phase follow the expected scaling of a conformal field theory (CFT) in the continuum limit. This property is shown to be non-generic for other types of quasiperiodic disorder, only appearing when our boundary disorder ansatz is described by a "dual" bulk hyperbolic tiling. Our results therefore suggest the existence of a whole class of critical phases whose symmetries are derived from models of discrete holography.

Title: Fault-tolerant fermionic quantum computing
Authors: Alexander Schuckert, Eleanor Crane, Alexey V. Gorshkov, Mohammad Hafezi, Michael J. Gullans
Abstract: Simulating the dynamics of electrons and other fermionic particles in quantum chemistry, materials science, and high-energy physics is one of the most promising applications of fault-tolerant quantum computers. However, the overhead in mapping time evolution under fermionic Hamiltonians to qubit gates renders this endeavor challenging. We introduce fermionic fault-tolerant quantum computing, a framework which removes this overhead altogether. Using native fermionic operations we first construct a repetition code which corrects phase errors only. Within a fermionic color code, which corrects for both phase and loss errors, we then realize a universal fermionic gate set, including transversal fermionic Clifford gates. Interfacing with qubit color codes we introduce qubit-fermion fault-tolerant computation, which allows for qubit-controlled fermionic time evolution, a crucial subroutine in state-of-the-art quantum algorithms. As an application, we consider simulating crystalline materials, finding an exponential improvement in circuit depth for a single time step from $\mathcal{O}(N)$ to $\mathcal{O}(\log(N))$ with respect to lattice site number $N$ while retaining a site count of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(N)$, implying a linear-in-$N$ end-to-end gate depth for simulating materials, as opposed to quadratic in previous approaches. We also introduce a fermion-inspired qubit algorithm with $O(\mathrm{log}(N)$ depth, but a prohibitive number of additional ancilla qubits. We show how our framework can be implemented in neutral atoms, overcoming the apparent inability of neutral atoms to implement non-number-conserving gates. Our work opens the door to fermion-qubit fault-tolerant quantum computation in platforms with native fermions such as neutral atoms, quantum dots and donors in silicon, with applications in quantum chemistry, material science, and high-energy physics.

Title: A deep neural network approach to solve the Dirac equation
Authors: Chuanxin Wang, Tomoya Naito, Jian Li, Haozhao Liang
Abstract: We extend the method from [Naito, Naito, and Hashimoto, Phys. Rev. Research 5, 033189 (2023)] to solve the Dirac equation not only for the ground state but also for low-lying excited states using a deep neural network and the unsupervised machine learning technique. The variational method fails because of the Dirac sea, which is avoided by introducing the inverse Hamiltonian method. For low-lying excited states, two methods are proposed, which have different performances and advantages. The validity of this method is verified by the calculations with the Coulomb and Woods-Saxon potentials.

Title: Effective Medium Theory for Time-modulated Subwavelength Resonators
Authors: Habib Ammari, Jinghao Cao, Erik Orvehed Hiltunen, Liora Rueff
Abstract: This paper provides a general framework for deriving effective material properties of one-dimensional, time-modulated systems of subwavelength resonators. It applies to subwavelength resonator systems with a general form of time-dependent parameters. We show that the resonators can be accurately described by a point-scattering formulation when the width of the resonators is small. In contrast to the static setting, where this point interaction approximation yields a Lippmann-Schwinger equation for the effective material properties, the mode coupling in the time-modulated case instead yields an infinite linear system of Lippmann-Schwinger-type equations. The effective equations can equivalently be written as a system of differential equations. Moreover, we introduce a numerical scheme to approximately solve the system of coupled equations and illustrate the validity of the effective equation.

Title: Deep Learning-Assisted Fourier Analysis for High-Efficiency Structural Design: A Case Study on Three-Dimensional Photonic Crystals Enumeration
Authors: Congcong Cui, Guangfeng Wei, Matthias Saba, Yuanyuan Cao, Lu Han
Abstract: The geometric design of structures with optimized physical and chemical properties is one of the core topics in materials science. However, designing new functional materials is challenging due to the vast number of existing and the possible unknown structures to be enumerated and difficulties in mining the underlying correlations between structures and their properties. Here, we propose a universal method for periodic structural design and property optimization. The key in our approach is a deep-learning assisted inverse Fourier transform, which enables the creation of arbitrary geometries within crystallographic space groups. It effectively explores extensive parameter spaces to identify ideal structures with desired properties. Taking the research of three-dimensional (3D) photonic structures as a case study, this method is capable of modelling numerous structures and identifying their photonic bandgaps in just a few hours. We confirmed the established knowledge that the widest photonic bandgaps exist in network morphologies, among which the single diamond (dia net) reigns supreme. Additionally, this method identified a rarely-known lcs topology with excellent photonic properties, highlighting the infinitely extensible application boundaries of our approach. This work demonstrates the high efficiency and effectiveness of the Fourier-based method, advancing material design and providing insights for next-generation functional materials.

Title: Time Evolution of the Symmetry Resolved Entanglement Entropy after a Mass Quench
Authors: Federico Rottoli, Michele Mazzoni, Fabio Sailis, Olalla A. Castro-Alvaredo
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the properties of the symmetry resolved entanglement entropy after a mass quench in the Ising field theory. Since the theory is free and the post-quench state known explicitly, the one-point function of the relevant (composite) branch point twist field can be computed using form factor techniques, similar to previous work on the branch point twist field and the magnetisation, respectively. We find that the symmetry resolved entropy grows linearly in time at the same rate as the total entropy, and that there are sub-leading oscillatory corrections. This result provides the first explicit computation of the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of the symmetry resolved entropy employing twist fields in quantum field theory and is consistent with existing results based on the quasiparticle picture.

Title: A low-background setup for in-situ X-ray total scattering combined with fast scanning calorimetry
Authors: Peihao Sun, Jacopo Baglioni, Beatrice Baraldi, Weilong Chen, Daniele Lideo, Lara Piemontese, Francesco Dallari, Marco Di Michiel, Giulio Monaco
Abstract: We demonstrate a setup combining fast scanning calorimetry with X-ray total scattering at a synchrotron beamline, allowing for \emph{in-situ} characterizations of the nano-scale structure of samples during and after temperature scans. The setup features a portable vacuum chamber giving high signal-to-background ratio even on amorphous samples, which enables the observation of detailed structural changes between different sample states. We show three use cases, including one which leverages the high cooling rate of 10$^4$\,K/s achievable by this setup. Our demonstration opens the door to various applications in materials science where it is important to understand the interplay between structure and thermodynamics.

Title: Fine-grained dynamics of entanglement in non-integrable quenches far across the Ising quantum critical point
Authors: Aditya Banerjee
Abstract: The task of exploring and understanding various aspects of far-from-equilibrium dynamics of closed and generic quantum many-body systems has received a thrust of attention in recent years, driven partly by remarkable advances in ultracold experimental technologies. In this work, for the paradigmatic Ising spin chain with transverse and longitudinal fields and partly motivated by the practice of site-resolved control in contemporary ultracold experiments, we present numerical observations of several $\textit{fine-grained}$ (small-subsystem level) features of far-from-equilibrium dynamics from a quantum informational point of view, induced by quantum quenches far across the Ising critical point between states deep inside the para- and ferro-magnetic regimes. Rather featureless dynamics is seen for ferromagnetic to paramagnetic quenches, but paramagnetic to ferromagnetic quenches exhibit rich behaviour, including recurrences of an approximately Page-like dynamics of entanglement entropies of one- and two-spin subsystems, periodic but short-lived occurrences of approximately $1-$uniform states, a series of sudden deaths and revivals of entanglement between two spins in the system's bulk, non-analytic cusps in single-copy entanglement entropy for three-spin and bigger subsystems, insufficient mixedness and a series of scrambling-$\textit{un}$scrambling of local mutual information between neighboring spins. Moreover, essentially indistinguishable dynamics is seen at very early times between the integrable limit (zero longitudinal field) and non-integrable cases, with the former eventually showing signatures of better mixing and faster approach to equilibration than the latter. These features are expected to hold for quench dynamics across Ising quantum critical points in more complicated systems.

Title: General theory of perturbation of infinite resistor networks
Authors: József Cserti, Gyula Dávid
Abstract: The effective resistance between any two nodes in a perturbed resistor network is determined by removing multiple bonds from an infinite resistor lattice. We have developed an efficient method for calculating the Green operator of the Laplacian for such perturbed networks, which is directly related to the two-point resistance. Unlike the recursive techniques that remove bonds one at a time, our approach handles all bond modifications simultaneously. To demonstrate the versatility of our method, several analytical and numerical examples are presented. In addition, we computed bond current distributions to gain deeper insight into the nature of resistor perturbations. We emphasize that our method has a broad range of applications, including condensed matter physics describing the quantum mechanical effects of impurities in crystal lattices, recently emerging topoelectronics, the study of vibrations in spring networks, and problems involving random walks.

Title: Electrically-gated laser-induced spin dynamics in magneto-electric iron garnet at room temperature
Authors: T.T. Gareev, N.E. Khokhlov, L.Körber, A. P. Pyatakov, A. V. Kimel
Abstract: Ultrafast pump-probe imaging reveals that the efficiency of optical excitation of coherent spins waves in epitaxial iron garnet films can be effectively controlled by an external electric field at room temperature. Although a femtosecond laser pulse alone does not excite any pronounced coherent spin oscillations, an electrical gating with the field of 0.5 MV/m dramatically changes the outcome in a laser-induced launching of spin waves. The effect, demonstrated under room-temperature conditions, is estimated to be orders of magnitude larger than in magnetic van der Waals semiconductors observed at 10 K. This electrical gating of laser-induced spin dynamics enriches opto-magnonics with a new tool and thus opens up a new avenue in fundamental and applied magnonics research.

Title: Weak Hopf tube algebra for domain walls between 2d gapped phases of Turaev-Viro TQFTs
Authors: Zhian Jia, Sheng Tan
Abstract: We investigate domain walls between 2d gapped phases of Turaev-Viro type topological quantum field theories (TQFTs) by constructing domain wall tube algebras. We begin by analyzing the domain wall tube algebra associated with bimodule categories, and then extend the construction to multimodule categories over $N$ base fusion categories. We prove that the resulting tube algebra is naturally equipped with a $C^*$ weak Hopf algebra structure. We show that topological excitations localized on domain walls are classified by representations of the corresponding domain wall tube algebra, in the sense that the functor category of bimodules admits a fusion-preserving embedding into the representation category of the domain wall tube algebra. We further establish the folding trick and Morita theory in this context. Then, most crucially, we provide a rigorous construction of the Drinfeld quantum double from weak Hopf boundary tube algebras using a skew-pairing, and establish an isomorphism between domain wall tube algebra and Drinfeld quantum double of boundary tube algebras. Motivated by the correspondence between the domain wall tube algebra and the quantum double of the boundary tube algebras, we introduce the notion of an $N$-tuple algebra and demonstrate how it arises in the multimodule domain wall setting. Finally, we consider defects between two domain walls, showing that such defects can be characterized by representations of a domain wall defect tube algebra. We briefly outline how these defects can be systematically treated within this representation-theoretic framework.

Title: Pinning models with contact number constraint: the effect of disorder
Authors: Giambattista Giacomin, Marco Zamparo
Abstract: Disordered pinning models are statistical mechanics models built on discrete renewal processes: renewal epochs in this context are called contacts. It is well known that pinning models can undergo a localization/delocalization phase transition: in the localized phase the typical density of contacts is positive and the largest gap between contacts is at most of the order of the logarithm of the size $n$ of the system, whereas the system is void of contacts in the delocalized phase. When disorder is absent and the phase transition is discontinuous, conditioning the contact density to be positive but smaller than the minimum typical density in the localized phase has the effect of forcing to create one, and only one, macroscopic gap between two contacts, while the rest of the configuration keeps the characteristics of a localized state. However it is known that, in the presence of (bounded) disorder, this big jump phenomenon is no longer observed, in the sense that the largest gap in the conditioned system is $o(n)$. Under minimal integrability conditions on the disorder we show that the conditioned system is localized in a very strong sense, in particular the largest gap is $O(\log n)$. The proof is achieved by exploiting the improved understanding of the localized phase of disordered pinning models developed in [34] and by establishing some refined estimates, in particular a quenched Local Central Limit Theorem. We also present an analysis of the effect of disorder on the large deviation rate function of the contact density and, as an important ingredient for the generality of our results, we establish a smoothing inequality for pinning models under minimal integrability conditions, thus generalizing [11,32].
