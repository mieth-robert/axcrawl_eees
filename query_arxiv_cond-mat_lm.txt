Title: Threshold Switching in Vertically Aligned MoS${_2}$/SiO${_x}$ Heterostructures based on Silver Ion Migration
Authors: Jimin Lee, Rana Walied Ahmad, Sofía Cruces, Dennis Braun, Lukas Völkel, Ke Ran, Joachim Mayer, Stephan Menzel, Alwin Daus, Max C. Lemme
Abstract: Threshold switching (TS) is a phenomenon where non-permanent changes in electrical resistance of a two-terminal device can be controlled by modulating the voltage bias. TS based on silver (Ag) conductive filaments has been observed in many materials, including layered two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). 2D TMDs are particularly promising for metal ion movement due to their van der Waals (vdW) gaps between their sheets, facilitating ion migration and filament formation without disturbing covalent chemical bonds. In this work, we demonstrate the heterostructure growth of vertically aligned molybdenum disulfide (VAMoS${_2}$) with an amorphous silicon oxide (SiO${_x}$) layer on top after sulfurization. We show that Ag ions migrate through this material stack, enabling TS. Our Ag/SiO${_x}$/VAMoS${_2}$/gold (Au) devices exhibit TS at low voltages of ~0.63 V, with high on-state currents over 200 ${\mu}$A and stable switching exceeding 10${^4}$ cycles. Moreover, we identify two rate-limiting steps for filament formation through a physics-based dynamical model and simulate the switching kinetics. Our devices show a fast on-switching time of 311 ns and spontaneous relaxation in 233 ns. These findings deepen the understanding of SiOx/MoS${_2}$-based RS devices and demonstrate the promise for applications in emerging memories and neuromorphic computing systems.

Title: Cracking in polymer substrates for flexible devices and its mitigation
Authors: Anush Ranka, Madhuja Layek, Sayaka Kochiyama, Cristina Lopez-Pernia, Alicia M. Chandler, Conrad A. Kocoj, Erica Magliano, Aldo Di Carlo, Francesca Brunetti, Peijun Guo, Subra Suresh, David C. Paine, Haneesh Kesari, Nitin P. Padture
Abstract: Mechanical reliability plays an outsized role in determining the durability of flexible electronic devices because of the significant mechanical stresses they can experience during manufacturing and operation. These devices are typically built on sheets comprising stiff thin-film electrodes on compliant polymer substrates, and it is generally assumed that the high-toughness substrates do not crack easily. Contrary to this widespread assumption, here we reveal severe, pervasive, and extensive cracking in the polymer substrates during bending of electrode/substrate sheets, which compromises the overall mechanical integrity of the entire device. The substrate-cracking phenomenon appears to be general, and it is driven by the amplified stress intensity factor caused by the elastic mismatch at the film/substrate interface. To mitigate this substrate cracking, an interlayer-engineering approach is designed and experimentally demonstrated. This approach is generic, and it is potentially applicable to myriad flexible electronic devices that utilize stiff films on compliant substrates, for improving their durability and reliability.

Title: Interaction-driven quantum phase transitions between topological and crystalline orders of electrons
Authors: André Haug, Ravi Kumar, Tomer Firon, Misha Yutushui, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, David F. Mross, Yuval Ronen
Abstract: Topological and crystalline orders of electrons both benefit from enhanced Coulomb interactions in partially filled Landau levels. In bilayer graphene (BLG), the competition between fractional quantum Hall liquids and electronic crystals can be tuned electrostatically. Applying a displacement field leads to Landau-level crossings, where the interaction potential is strongly modified due to changes in the orbital wave functions. Here, we leverage this control to investigate phase transitions between topological and crystalline orders at constant filling factors in the lowest Landau level of BLG. Using transport measurements in high-quality hBN-encapsulated devices, we study transitions as a function of displacement field near crossings of $N=0$ and $N=1$ orbitals. The enhanced Landau-level mixing near the crossing stabilizes electronic crystals at all fractional fillings, including a resistive state at $\nu = \frac{1}{3}$ and a reentrant integer quantum Hall state at $\nu = \frac{7}{3}$. On the $N=0$ side, the activation energies of the crystal and fractional quantum Hall liquid vanish smoothly and symmetrically at the transition, while the $N=1$ transitions out of the crystal appear discontinuous. Additionally, we observe quantized plateaus forming near the crystal transition at half filling of the $N=0$ levels, suggesting a paired composite fermion state stabilized by Landau level mixing.

Title: Charge Transfer Dynamics in an Electron-Hole Bilayer Device: Capacitance Oscillations and Hysteretic Behavior
Authors: Miranda Leigh Davis, Simon Parolo, Sandro Agostini, Christian Reichl, Werner Dietsche, Werner Wegscheider
Abstract: The capacitance and differential conductance of MBE-grown AlGaAs/GaAs p-i-n diodes are investigated. In these diodes, the p-doped layer, an adjacent intrinsic spacer, and a central barrier are made of AlGaAs. Capacitance oscillations and hysteretic behavior are observed and understood to be consequences of the AlGaAs spacer properties. These findings have significant implications for the design of heterostructures aimed at achieving electrically contacted, closely spaced electron and hole layers.

Title: Interface Magnetism in Vanadium-doped MoS$_2$/Graphene Heterostructures
Authors: Diem Thi-Xuan Dang, Yen Thi-Hai Pham, Da Zhou, Dai-Nam Le, Mauricio Terrones, Manh-Huong Phan, Lilia M. Woods
Abstract: Magnetism in two-dimensional materials is of great importance in discovering new physical phenomena and developing new devices at the nanoscale. In this paper, first-principles simulations are used to calculate the electronic and magnetic properties of heterostructures composed of Graphene and MoS$_2$ considering the influence of point defects and Vanadium doping. It is found that the concentration of the dopants and the types of defects can result in induced magnetic moments leading to ferromagnetically polarized systems with sharp interfaces. This provides a framework for interpreting the experimental observations of enhanced ferromagnetism in both MoS$_2$/Graphene and V-doped MoS$_2$/Graphene heterostructures. The computed electronic and spin polarizations give a microscopic understanding of the origin of ferromagnetism in these systems and illustrate how doping and defect engineering can lead to targeted property tunability. Our work has demonstrated that through defects engineering, ferromagnetism can be achieved in V-doped MoS$_2$/Graphene heterostructures, providing a potential way to induce magnetization in other TMDC/Graphene materials and opening new opportunities for their applications in nano-spintronics.

Title: Classifying destructive quantum interference in molecular junctions: Towards molecular quantum rulers
Authors: Lukas Krieger, Gert-Ludwig Ingold, Fabian Pauly
Abstract: Destructive quantum interference in molecular junctions might be used to build molecular quantum rulers, allowing to quantify changes in external control parameters electrically. For this reason, it is important to understand which patterns of destructive quantum interference can occur inside the electronic excitation gap of a molecule, coupled to conducting electrodes. By considering a four-level model, we show that much more complex destructive quantum interference behavior can arise than expected for just two levels. We classify the destructive quantum interferences analytically and show that they may even occur in regions forbidden by the standard orbital rule for electron transport. Our results suggest that appropriate molecular design may indeed allow to construct highly sensitive molecular quantum rulers.

Title: Magnetic excitations from the hexagonal spin clusters in the S = 1/2 distorted honeycomb lattice antiferromagnet Cu2(pymca)3(ClO4)
Authors: Masaaki Matsuda, Alexander I. Kolesnikov, Zentaro Honda, Tokuro Shimokawa, Sho Inoue, Yasuo Narumi, Masayuki Hagiwara
Abstract: Cu2(pymca)3(ClO4) (pymca: pyrimidine-2-carboxylate) consists of a slightly distorted honeycomb lattice of Cu2+ spins, which shows no long-range magnetic order down to 0.6 K. A magnetization study revealed 1/3 and 2/3 plateau phases [A. Okutani et al., J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. 88, 013703 (2019)], which is not expected for regular honeycomb antiferromagnets. Inelastic neutron scattering experiments were performed using a powder sample to investigate the exchange interactions of this material. The spin excitations from the singlet ground state to the first three triplet states, predicted from the antiferromagnetic hexagonal spin cluster interacting with 3.9 meV, were observed. Using the exact diagonalization mothods, the intercluster coupling was estimated from the excitation peak width to be about 20% of the intracluster interaction, which is consistent with the previously reported value. Our exchange path model explains the anisotropic exchange interactions in the distorted honeycomb plane.

Title: Ab initio Complex Langevin computation of the roton gap for a dipolar Bose condensate
Authors: Philipp Heinen, Wyatt Kirkby, Lauriane Chomaz, Thomas Gasenzer
Abstract: We compute from first principles the dispersion relation $\omega(k)$ of a dipolar Bose gas of erbium atoms close to the roton instability by employing the Complex Langevin (CL) algorithm. Other than the path integral Monte Carlo algorithm, which samples the quantum mechanical path integral in the $N$-particle basis, CL samples the field-theoretic path integral of interacting bosons and can be evaluated for experimentally realistic atom numbers. We extract the energy of roton excitations as a function of the s-wave scattering length, and compare our results to those from Gross-Pitaevskii theory, with and without quantum fluctuation corrections.

Title: Higgs-mode electromagnon in the spin-spiral multiferroic CuBr${}_2$
Authors: Bryan T. Fichera, Ajesh Kumar, Baiqing Lv, Zongqi Shen, Karna Morey, Qian Song, Batyr Ilyas, Tianchuang Luo, Riccardo Comin, T. Senthil, Nuh Gedik
Abstract: Below a continuous symmetry breaking phase transition, the relevant collective excitations are due to longitudinal and transverse fluctuations of the order parameter, which are referred to as Higgs and Goldstone modes, respectively. In solids, these modes may take on a different character than the equivalent excitations in particle physics due to the diverse vacuum states accessible in condensed matter. However, the Higgs mode in particular is quite difficult to observe experimentally as it decays quickly into the lower-energy Goldstone bosons and thus has a negligible lifetime in most systems. In this work, we report evidence for a novel Higgs mode in the multiferroic material CuBr${}_2$, which shows up as a coherent oscillation in the time-resolved second harmonic generation signal upon excitation with a femtosecond light pulse. Since the spiral spin order in CuBr${}_2$ induces a nonzero electric dipole moment in equilibrium, the Higgs mode--which is due to fluctuations in the amplitude of the on-site spin expectation value--is an electromagnon, and thus acquires an inversion quantum number of -1. This is in stark contrast to the Higgs boson of particle physics, which has even parity. Moreover, the excitation described here represents an entirely new type of electromagnon, distinct from the traditional electromagnon in linear spin wave theory which is due to the Goldstone mode.

Title: A Unified Predictive and Generative Solution for Liquid Electrolyte Formulation
Authors: Zhenze Yang, Yifan Wu, Xu Han, Ziqing Zhang, Haoen Lai, Zhenliang Mu, Tianze Zheng, Siyuan Liu, Zhichen Pu, Zhi Wang, Zhiao Yu, Sheng Gong, Wen Yan
Abstract: Liquid electrolytes are critical components of next-generation energy storage systems, enabling fast ion transport, minimizing interfacial resistance, and ensuring electrochemical stability for long-term battery performance. However, measuring electrolyte properties and designing formulations remain experimentally and computationally expensive. In this work, we present a unified framework for designing liquid electrolyte formulation, integrating a forward predictive model with an inverse generative approach. Leveraging both computational and experimental data collected from literature and extensive molecular simulations, we train a predictive model capable of accurately estimating electrolyte properties from ionic conductivity to solvation structure. Our physics-informed architecture preserves permutation invariance and incorporates empirical dependencies on temperature and salt concentration, making it broadly applicable to property prediction tasks across molecular mixtures. Furthermore, we introduce -- to the best of our knowledge -- the first generative machine learning framework for molecular mixture design, demonstrated on electrolyte systems. This framework supports multi-condition-constrained generation, addressing the inherently multi-objective nature of materials design. This unified framework advances data-driven electrolyte design and can be readily extended to other complex chemical systems beyond electrolytes.

Title: Engineering Graphene Nanoribbons via Periodically Embedding Oxygen Atoms
Authors: Yan Zhao, Li-Xia Kang, Yi-Jun Wang, Yi Wu, Guang-Yan Xing, Shi-Wen Li, Jinliang Pan, Nie-Wei Wang, Yin-Ti Ren, Ying Wang, Ya-Cheng Zhu, Xing-Qiang Shi, Mengxi Liu, Xiaohui Qiu, Pei-Nian Liu, Deng-Yuan Li
Abstract: Heteroatom doping is an important method for engineering graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) because of its ability to modify electronic properties by introducing extra electrons or vacancies. However, precisely integrating oxygen atoms into the lattice of GNRs is unexplored, and the resulting electronic properties remain elusive. Here, we achieve the precise embedding of oxygen atoms into the lattice of GNRs via in situ formation of pyrans, synthesizing two types of oxygen-doped GNRs (O-doped chevron-GNR and O-doped chiral (2,1)-GNR). Using scanning tunneling microscopy, non-contact atomic force microscopy, and density functional theory calculations, the atomic structures and electronic properties of O-doped GNRs are determined, demonstrating that both GNRs are direct bandgap semiconductors with different sensitivities to oxygen dopants. Oxygen dopants have a minor impact on the bandgap of chevron-GNR but a significant effect on the bandgap of chiral (2,1)-GNR, which is attributed to the difference in density of states near the Fermi level between substituted intrinsic carbon atoms and their pristine counterparts. Compared with the pristine chiral (2,1)-GNR, the band structure of O-doped chiral (2,1)-GNR exhibits unexpected band edges transition, which is ascribed to sp2-hybridized oxygen atoms which introduces additional electrons to the conduction band of chiral (2,1)-GNR, leading to the upward shift of Fermi surface.

Title: Robust Wave Splitters Based on Scattering Singularities in Complex non-Hermitian Systems
Authors: Jared Erb, Nadav Shaibe, Tsampikos Kottos, Steven M. Anlage
Abstract: Coherent perfect absorption (CPA) is well-known as a phenomenon where all the energy of a specific injected wavefront is completely absorbed by losses in a system, independent of details. This has applications in wavefront shaping, communication, filtering, wireless power transfer, etc. We have discovered an application of coherent perfect absorption enabling conditions as a tunable splitter that is robust to any change in relative amplitude or phase of an arbitrary injected waveform. We show experimentally that the fixed splitting ratios and output phases at CPA enabling conditions are robust to 100 dB of relative power and 2$\pi$ phase changes of the input waves to a complex non-Hermitian two-port system. We also demonstrate that the splitting power ratio can be tuned by multiple orders of magnitude and the CPA enabling conditions can be tuned to any desired frequency with suitable tunable perturbations embedded in the system. Although this phenomenon is realized in two-port systems, tunable robust splitting can be achieved between any two ports of multiport systems. These results are general to all wave scattering phenomena and hold in generic complex scattering systems.

Title: Three-Dimensional Fermi Surface, Van Hove Singularity and Enhancement of Superconductivity in Infinite-Layer Nickelates
Authors: Chengliang Xia, Shengjie Zhou, Hanghui Chen
Abstract: Recent experiments reveal a three-dimensional (3D) Fermi surface with a clear $k_z$ dispersion in infinite-layer nickelates, distinguishing them from their cuprate superconductor counterparts. However, the impact of this difference on the superconducting properties of nickelates remains unclear. Here, we employ a combined random-phase-approximation and dynamical-mean-field-theory (RPA+DMFT) approach to solve the linearized gap equation for superconductivity. We find that, compared to the cuprate-like two-dimensional (2D) single-orbital Fermi surface, the van Hove singularities on the 3D Fermi surface of infinite-layer nickelates strengthen spin fluctuations by driving the system closer to antiferromagnetic instabilities, thereby significantly enhancing superconductivity. Our findings underscore the critical role of the van Hove singularities in shaping the superconducting properties of infinite-layer nickelates and, more broadly, highlight the importance of subtle Fermi surface features in modeling material-specific unconventional superconductors.

Title: The Global Diffusion Limit for the Space Dependent Variable-Order Time-Fractional Diffusion Equation
Authors: Christopher N. Angstmann, Daniel S. Han, Bruce I. Henry, Boris Z. Huang, Zhuang Xu
Abstract: The diffusion equation and its time-fractional counterpart can be obtained via the diffusion limit of continuous-time random walks with exponential and heavy-tailed waiting time distributions. The space dependent variable-order time-fractional diffusion equation is a generalization of the time-fractional diffusion equation with a fractional exponent that varies over space, modelling systems with spatial heterogeneity. However, there has been limited work on defining a global diffusion limit and an underlying random walk for this macroscopic governing equation, which is needed to make meaningful interpretations of the parameters for applications. Here, we introduce continuous time and discrete time random walk models that limit to the variable-order fractional diffusion equation via a global diffusion limit and space- and time- continuum limits. From this, we show how the master equation of the discrete time random walk can be used to provide a numerical method for solving the variable-order fractional diffusion equation. The results in this work provide underlying random walks and an improved understanding of the diffusion limit for the variable-order fractional diffusion equation, which is critical for the development, calibration and validation of models for diffusion in spatially inhomogeneous media with traps and obstacles.

Title: Predicting Stress in Two-phase Random Materials and Super-Resolution Method for Stress Images by Embedding Physical Information
Authors: Tengfei Xing, Xiaodan Ren, Jie Li
Abstract: Stress analysis is an important part of material design. For materials with complex microstructures, such as two-phase random materials (TRMs), material failure is often accompanied by stress concentration. Phase interfaces in two-phase materials are critical for stress concentration. Therefore, the prediction error of stress at phase boundaries is crucial. In practical engineering, the pixels of the obtained material microstructure images are limited, which limits the resolution of stress images generated by deep learning methods, making it difficult to observe stress concentration regions. Existing Image Super-Resolution (ISR) technologies are all based on data-driven supervised learning. However, stress images have natural physical constraints, which provide new ideas for new ISR technologies. In this study, we constructed a stress prediction framework for TRMs. First, the framework uses a proposed Multiple Compositions U-net (MC U-net) to predict stress in low-resolution material microstructures. By considering the phase interface information of the microstructure, the MC U-net effectively reduces the problem of excessive prediction errors at phase boundaries. Secondly, a Mixed Physics-Informed Neural Network (MPINN) based method for stress ISR (SRPINN) was proposed. By introducing the constraints of physical information, the new method does not require paired stress images for training and can increase the resolution of stress images to any multiple. This enables a multiscale analysis of the stress concentration regions at phase boundaries. Finally, we performed stress analysis on TRMs with different phase volume fractions and loading states through transfer learning. The results show the proposed stress prediction framework has satisfactory accuracy and generalization ability.

Title: Percolation in the two-dimensional Ising model
Authors: Tao Chen, Jinhong Zhu, Wei Zhong, Sheng Fang, Youjin Deng
Abstract: The study of the Ising model from a percolation perspective has played a significant role in the modern theory of critical phenomena. We consider the celebrated square-lattice Ising model and construct percolation clusters by placing bonds, with probability $p$, between any pair of parallel spins within an extended range beyond nearest neighbors. At the Ising criticality, we observe two percolation transitions as $p$ increases: starting from a disordered phase with only small clusters, the percolation system enters into a stable critical phase that persists over a wide range $p_{c_1} < p < p_{c_2}$, and then develops a long-ranged percolation order with giant clusters for both up and down spins. At $p_{c1}$ and for the stable critical phase, the critical behaviors agree well with those for the Fortuin-Kasteleyn random clusters and the spin domains of the Ising model, respectively. At $p_{c2}$, the fractal dimension of clusters and the scaling exponent along $p$ direction are estimated as $y_{h2} = 1.958\,0(6)$ and $y_{p2} = 0.552(9)$, of which the exact values remain unknown. These findings reveal interesting geometric properties of the two-dimensional Ising model that has been studied for more than 100 years.

Title: Micro-tip manipulated origami for robust twisted few-layer graphene
Authors: Ruo-Jue Zou, Long Deng, Si-Min Xue, Feng-Fei Cai, Ling-Hui Tong, Yang Zhang, Yuan Tian, Li Zhang, Lijie Zhang, Zhihui Qin, Long-Jing Yin
Abstract: Twisted few-layer graphene (tFLG) has emerged as an ideal model system for investigating novel strongly correlated and topological phenomena. However, the experimental construction of tFLG with high structural stability is still challenging. Here, we introduce a highly accessible method for fabricating robust tFLG by polymer micro-tip manipulated origami. Through using a self-prepared polymer micro-tip, which is composed of multiple dimethylpolysiloxane, poly(vinyl chloride), and graphite sheets, to fold graphene layers, we fabricated tFLG with different twist angles (0°-30°) and various layers, including twisted bilayers (1+1), twisted double-bilayers (2+2), twisted double-trilayers (3+3), and thicker layers. Even ABC-stacked tFLG were created, such as twisted ABC/ABC and ABC/ABA graphene coexisting in an ABC-ABA domain wall region. We found that the origami-fabricated tFLG exhibits high stability against thermal and mechanical perturbations including heating and transferring, which could be attributed to its special folding and tearing structures. Moreover, based on the rich types of samples, we revealed twist-angle and stacking-order dependent Raman characteristics of tFLG, which is valuable for understanding the stacking-modulated phonon spectroscopy. Our experiments provide a simple and efficient approach to construct structurally robust tFLG, paving the way for the study of highly stable twisted van der Waals heterostructures.

Title: Structural transformation for BaBiO3-δ thin films grown on SrTiO3-buffered Si(001) induced by an in-situ Molecular Beam Epitaxy cooldown process
Authors: Islam Ahmed, Olivier Richard, Partrick Carolan, Marco Gambin, Luca Ceccon, Moloud Kaviani, Stefan De Gendt, Clement Merckling
Abstract: Oxygen loss is one of the common defect types in perovskite oxides whose formation can be caused by a low oxygen background pressure during growth or by straining the thin film. Crystalline BaBiO3-{\delta} thin films are grown by molecular beam epitaxy on SrTiO3 buffered Si(001) substrates. Adsorption-controlled regime governs the epitaxy, as the sticking coefficient of bismuth is boosted by supplying activated oxygen at plasma power of 600 W during epitaxy. Even though activated oxygen is supplied during the growth process, large amount of oxygen vacancies is found to be created in the thin film depending on the cooldown process. Perovskite structure is obtained when the cooldown process includes an extended period of time during which activated oxygen at plasma power of 600 W is supplied. Another way for inducing the structural transformation is enabled via an ex-situ 600°C anneal step at molecular oxygen for the sample which includes oxygen vacancy channels. The transformation into perovskite structure BaBiO3 is manifested as reconstructed octahedra based on transmission electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and photoluminescence. Additionally, smaller out-of-plane lattice constant as well as increased monoclinicity are observed for the perovskite phase supported by X-ray diffraction data. In this paper, thermal mismatch and multivalency-facilitated tensile strain exerted on the layers by the underlying Si substrates are presented as the driving force behind the creation of oxygen vacancies.

Title: Planar Nernst effect from hidden band geometry in layered two-dimensional materials
Authors: Rahul Biswas, Harsh Varsney, Amit Agarwal
Abstract: The Nernst effect is a versatile phenomenon relevant for energy harvesting, magnetic sensing, probing band topology and charge-neutral excitations. The planar Nernst effect (PNE) generates an in-plane voltage transverse to an applied temperature gradient under an in-plane magnetic field. Conventional Berry curvature-induced PNE is absent in two-dimensional (2D) systems, as the out-of-plane Berry curvature does not couple to the in-plane electron velocity. We challenge this notion by demonstrating a distinct planar Nernst effect in quasi-2D materials (2DPNE). We show that the 2DPNE originates from previously overlooked planar components of Berry curvature and orbital magnetic moment, arising from inter-layer tunneling in multilayered 2D systems. We comprehensively analyze the band-geometric origin and crystalline symmetry constraints on 2DPNE responses. We illustrate its experimental feasibility in strained bilayer graphene. Our findings significantly expand the theoretical understanding of planar Nernst effects, providing a clear pathway for next-generation magnetic sensing and energy-harvesting applications.

Title: In Situ Nanometer-Resolution Strain and Orientation Mapping for Gas-Solid Reactions via Precession-Assisted Four-dimensional Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy
Authors: Yongwen Sun, Ying Han, Dan Zhou, Athanassios S. Galanis, Alejandro Gomez-Perez, Ke Wang, Stavros Nicolopoulos, Hugo Perez Garza, Yang Yang
Abstract: Chemomechanical interactions in gas or liquid environments are crucial for the functionality and longevity of various materials used in sustainable energy technologies, such as rechargeable batteries, water-splitting catalysts, and next-generation nuclear reactors. A comprehensive understanding of nanoscale strain evolution involved in these processes can advance our knowledge of underlying mechanisms and facilitate material design improvements. However, traditional microscopy workflows face challenges due to trade-offs between field of view (FOV), spatial resolution, temporal resolution, and electron beam damage, particularly in gas or liquid environments. Here, we demonstrate in situ nanometer-resolution strain and orientation mapping in a temperature-controlled gas environment with a large FOV. This is achieved by integrating a microelectromechanical system (MEMS)-based closed-cell TEM holder, precession-assisted four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM), and a direct electron detector (DED). Using the strain evolution during zirconium initial oxidation as a case study, we first outline critical strategies for focused ion beam gas-cell sample preparation and gas-phase TEM workflows to enhance experimental success. We then show that integrating DED with precession electron diffraction and optimizing gas pressure substantially improve the quantity and quality of the detected Bragg peaks in nano-beam electron diffraction patterns, enabling more precise strain measurements. Furthermore, we introduce a practical protocol to pause the reactions, allowing sufficient time for 4D-STEM data collection while ensuring the temporal resolution needed to resolve material dynamics. Our methodology and workflow provide a robust framework for quantitative analysis of chemomechanical evolutions in materials exposed to gas or liquid environments.

Title: Slow ferromagnetic fluctuations in the kagome metal Sc$_3$Mn$_3$Al$_7$Si$_5$ revealed by $^{27}$Al NMR
Authors: Qing-Ping Ding, Charles Taylor, Yongbin Lee, Charuni Dissanayake, Vireshwar Mishra, Dang Khoa Le, Manh-Huong Phan, Yasuyuki Nakajima, Yuji Furukawa
Abstract: Static and dynamical magnetic and electronic properties of the kagome metal Sc$_3$Mn$_3$Al$_7$Si$_5$ have been investigated by $^{27}$Al nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements. The temperature dependence of Knight shift ($K$) shows a similar temperature dependence of the DC magnetic susceptibility $\chi$ except for the low-temperature region below $\sim$ 50 K where $K$ is almost constant while $\chi$ keeps increasing, which suggests that the increase in $\chi$ at low temperatures is not intrinsic. $^{27}$Al spin-lattice relaxation rate divided by temperature ($1/T_1T$) is found to be constant, confirming the metallic state of Sc$_3$Mn$_3$Al$_7$Si$_5$ from a microscopic point of view. Based on a Korringa ratio analysis using the $T_1$ and $K$ data, ferromagnetic spin fluctuations are found to dominate in Sc$_3$Mn$_3$Al$_7$Si$_5$. These fluctuations are suggested to be very slow with frequencies on the order of kilohertz or lower.

Title: Critical Non-Hermitian Edge Modes
Authors: Kunling Zhou, Zihe Yang, Bowen Zeng, Yong Hu
Abstract: We unveil a unique critical phenomenon of topological edge modes in non-Hermitian systems, dubbed the critical non-Hermitian edge modes (CNHEM). Specifically, in the thermodynamic limit, the eigenvectors of edge modes jump discontinuously under infinitesimal on-site staggered perturbations. The CNHEM arises from the competition between the introduced on-site staggered potentials and size-dependent non-reciprocal coupling between edge modes, and are closely connected to the exceptional point (EP). As the system size increases, the coupling between edge modes decreases while the non-reciprocity is enhanced, causing the eigenvectors to gradually collapse toward the EP. However, when the on-site potentials dominate, this weakened coupling assists the eigenvectors to stay away from the EP. Such a critical phenomenon is absent in Hermitian systems, where the coupling between edge modes is reciprocal.

Title: Anisotropy-dependent decay of room temperature metastable skyrmions and a nascent double-$q$ spin texture in Co$_{8}$Zn$_{9}$Mn$_{3}$
Authors: J. S. White, V. Ukleev, L. Yu, Y. Tokura, Y. Taguchi, K. Karube
Abstract: Chiral cubic Co-Zn-Mn magnets exhibit diverse topological spin textures, including room-temperature skyrmion phases and robust far-from-equilibrium metastable states. Despite recent advances in understanding metastable skyrmions, the interplay between compositional disorder and varying magnetic anisotropy on the stability and decay of metastable textures, particularly near room temperature, remains incompletely understood. In this work, the equilibrium and metastable skyrmion formation in Co$_{8}$Zn$_{9}$Mn$_{3}$ is examined, revealing transformations between distinct metastable spin textures induced by temperature and magnetic field. At room temperature, the decay dynamics of metastable skyrmions exhibits a strong dependence on magnetic anisotropy, showcasing a route towards tailoring relaxation behavior. Furthermore, a nascent double-$q$ spin texture, characterized by two coexisting magnetic modulation vectors $q$, is identified as a minority phase alongside the conventional triple-$q$ hexagonal skyrmion lattice. This double-$q$ texture can be quenched as a metastable state, suggesting both its topological character, and its role as a potential intermediary of metastable skyrmion decay. These findings provide new insights into the tunability of equilibrium and metastable topological spin textures via chemical composition and magnetic anisotropy, offering strategies for designing materials with customizable and dynamic skyrmion properties for advanced technological applications.

Title: Unraveling the Conglomeratic Nature of Methanol Clusters Adsorbed on Graphene Surfaces. Insights from Molecular Dynamics Simulations
Authors: Juan García de la Concepción, Izaskun Jiménez-Serra, Ibon Alkorta, José Elguero, Pedro Cintas
Abstract: The expression of chirality in adsorption phenomena constitutes an important topic, not only relevant to asymmetric transformations involving solid surfaces, but also to the emergence of homochirality in both terrestrial and extraterrestrial scenarios. Methanol (MeOH) aggregation on graphite/graphene, one of the most idealized adsorbate-adsorbent systems, lead to islands of cyclic clusters of different sizes (Nano. Lett., 2016, 16, 3142-3147). Here, we show that this aggregation occurs enantioselectively affording 2D conglomerates depending on the size of clusters, in close analogy to a Pasteurian racemate. Homochiral sequences are held together by hydrogen bonding and other non-covalent interactions, whose absolute configurations can be appropriately specified. A discussion involving the dichotomy between 2D racemates and conglomerates, is offered as well. In addition, the present simulations showcase a broad range of acyclic and cyclic structures, even if some discrete rings are the dominant species, in agreement with previous experimental data and theoretical modeling. Our results indicate that MeOH clusters show binding energies close to the experimental values, remaining intact at temperatures as high as 120 K and up to 150 K.

Title: Superconductivity in a semiconductor doped with the resonance negative U-centers
Authors: Serguei N. Burmistrov, Leonid B. Dubovskii
Abstract: We study the effect of doping the semiconductor with the resonance negative U-centers upon its superconducting transition temperature. The attraction of electrons at the U-centers leads to the enhancement of transition temperature. On the contrary, the resonant scattering of conduction electrons along with their hybridization at the U-centers results in reducing the transition temperature. The largest effect on the superconducting transition temperature takes place if the resonance width is of the order of the energy level at the U-center. In the lack of the electron-phonon coupling under sufficiently low concentration of U-centers the superconducting transition is entirely absent in spite of the presence of attraction between electrons at U-centers.

Abstract: Planar Josephson junctions (JJs) based on InSb nanoflags have recently emerged as an intriguing platform in superconducting electronics. This letter presents the fabrication and investigation of superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) employing InSb nanoflag JJs. We provide measurements of interference patterns in both symmetric and asymmetric geometries. The interference patterns in both configurations can be modulated by a back-gate voltage, a feature well reproduced through numerical simulations. The observed behavior aligns with the skewed current-phase relations of the JJs, demonstrating significant contributions from higher harmonics. We explore the magnetic field response of the devices across a wide range of fields ($\pm 30$ mT), up to the single-junction interference regime, where a Fraunhofer-like pattern is detected. Finally, we assess the flux-to-voltage sensitivity of the SQUIDs to evaluate their performance as magnetometers. A magnetic flux noise of $S^{1/2}_\Phi = 4.4 \times 10^{-6} \Phi_0 / \sqrt{Hz}$ is identified, indicating potential applications in nanoscale magnetometry.

Abstract: This work demonstrates that depositing a thin layer of Mo (5-15 nm) onto a 10 nm thick NbN strip leads to a significant increase in the nonlinearity of the kinetic inductance $L_k$. Specifically, the change in $L_k$ with increasing current reached 70% in the NbN/Mo bilayer at liquid helium temperature, whereas in the NbN strip, $L_k$ changed by only 10% in the superconducting state. In addition to altering the nonlinear properties, the Mo layer caused a significant increase in the critical current at low temperatures (up to 2 times in the case of a 5 nm thick Mo layer). The increased nonlinearity of $L_k$ can be explained by two factors: i) a reduction of the critical supervelocity at which the superconducting state becomes unstable with respect to vortex formation when a Mo layer is deposited on NbN, and ii) a higher sensitivity of the induced superconductivity in Mo to supervelocity/supercurrent. Considering the results on the transport properties of SN bilayers with a high ratio of layer resistivities $\rho_S/\rho_N >> 1$, it can be concluded that depositing a thin layer of a relatively low-resistivity metal onto a superconductor with high $\rho$ is a practical method for achieving a large nonlinearity of the superconductor's kinetic inductance.

Title: Learning Stochastic Thermodynamics Directly from Correlation and Trajectory-Fluctuation Currents
Authors: Jinghao Lyu, Kyle J. Ray, James P. Crutchfield
Abstract: Markedly increased computational power and data acquisition have led to growing interest in data-driven inverse dynamics problems. These seek to answer a fundamental question: What can we learn from time series measurements of a complex dynamical system? For small systems interacting with external environments, the effective dynamics are inherently stochastic, making it crucial to properly manage noise in data. Here, we explore this for systems obeying Langevin dynamics and, using currents, we construct a learning framework for stochastic modeling. Currents have recently gained increased attention for their role in bounding entropy production (EP) from thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs). We introduce a fundamental relationship between the cumulant currents there and standard machine-learning loss functions. Using this, we derive loss functions for several key thermodynamic functions directly from the system dynamics without the (common) intermediate step of deriving a TUR. These loss functions reproduce results derived both from TURs and other methods. More significantly, they open a path to discover new loss functions for previously inaccessible quantities. Notably, this includes access to per-trajectory entropy production, even if the observed system is driven far from its steady-state. We also consider higher order estimation. Our method is straightforward and unifies dynamic inference with recent approaches to entropy production estimation. Taken altogether, this reveals a deep connection between diffusion models in machine learning and entropy production estimation in stochastic thermodynamics.

Title: A Workflow for Correlative in-situ Nano-chip Liquid Cell Transmission Electron Microscopy and Atom Probe Tomography Enabled by Cryogenic Plasma Focused Ion Beam
Authors: Neil Mulcahy, James O. Douglas, Syeda Ramin Jannat, Lukas Worch, Geri Topore, Baptiste Gault, Mary P. Ryan, Michele Shelly Conroy
Abstract: Operando/in-situ liquid cell transmission electron microscopy (LCTEM) allows for real time imaging of dynamic nanoscale liquid-based processes. However, due to the thick liquid cell of traditional LCTEM holders and thus scattering of the electron beam passing through the cell, the achievable spatial and chemical resolution is limited. Cryogenic atom probe tomography (cryo-APT) overcomes these limitations by offering (near-)atomic scale compositional analysis of frozen liquid-solid interfaces. However, APT provides limited structural analysis and has no capacity for dynamic or operando liquid cell studies. This work presents a novel workflow for site-specific cryo-APT sample preparation of liquid-solid interfaces from in-situ electrochemical LCTEM Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) chips. Using cryogenic inert gas transfer suitcase and a cryogenic plasma-focused ion beam (PFIB), a MEMs nanochip containing a Li electrolyte from an electrochemistry LCTEM holder was successfully frozen, transferred to the cryo stage of a PFIB and prepared into APT needle samples containing the electrolyte-electrode interface at cryogenic temperatures, followed by cryogenic transfer to an atom probe for nanoscale compositional analysis. This correlative approach provides dynamic nanoscale imaging and near atomic scale compositional analysis of liquid-solid interfaces. This method enables reliable and reproducible APT sample preparation of these frozen interfaces from MEMs based nanochips and can hence be used across materials systems and energy-conversion or storage devices.

Title: Superconducting Sn-Intercalated TaSe$_2$: Structural Diversity Obscured by Conventional Characterization Techniques
Authors: Brenna C. Bierman, Hongrui Ma, Ying Wang, Daniel A. Rhodes
Abstract: Using Sn-intercalated TaSe$_2$ as a model system, we uncover structural heterogeneity by single-crystal X-ray diffraction that eludes the common characterization techniques of powder X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and electrical transport measurements. From a single growth composition (1:1:2 Sn:Ta:Se), we obtain diverse stoichiometries and structures, with near-continuous intercalation for Sn$_x$TaSe$_2$ from $0\leq\textrm{x}\leq1$. Using single-crystal X-ray diffraction, we identify four new structures: Sn$_{0.18}$TaSe$_{1.92}$ ($R3m$), Sn$_{0.37}$TaSe$_{2.14}$ ($R\bar3$), Sn$_{0.42}$TaSe$_{2.04}$ ($P\bar31c$), and Sn$_{1.1}$TaSe$_2$ ($Fmm2$). In contrast, powder X-ray diffraction cannot resolve all four structures. Raman spectroscopy is unable to distinguish different structures or compositions in the standard measurement range. Transport measurements show consistent superconductivity irrespective of Sn-intercalation amount or appearance of charge density wave behavior. This work underscores the inadequate sensitivity of common approaches in capturing the structural diversity of intercalated transition metal dichalcogenides and the need for high-resolution structural characterization when examining the properties of van der Waals-layered compounds.

Title: Connecting weakly nonlinear elasticity theories of isotropic hyperelastic materials
Authors: Yangkun Du, Nicholas A Hill, XIaoyu Luo
Abstract: Soft materials exhibit significant nonlinear geometric deformations and stress-strain relationships under external forces. This paper explores weakly nonlinear elasticity theories, including Landau's and Murnaghan's formulations, advancing understanding beyond linear elasticity. We establish connections between these methods and extend strain-energy functions to the third and fourth orders in powers of epsilon, where epsilon is defined as the square root of the inner product of H with itself, epsilon = sqrt(H * H), and epsilon is between 0 and 1. Here, H represents the perturbation to the deformation gradient tensor, where the deformation gradient F is given by F = I + H. Furthermore, we address simplified strain-energy functions applicable to incompressible materials. Through this work, we contribute to a comprehensive understanding of nonlinear elasticity and its relationship to weakly nonlinear elasticity, facilitating the study of moderate deformations in soft material behavior and its practical applications.

Title: Skyrmion Bubbles by Design in a Centrosymmetric Kagome Magnet
Authors: Mohamed El Gazzah, Fehmi Sami Yasin, Sk Jamaluddin, Hari Bhandari, Resham Babu Regmi, Xiuzhen Yu, Nirmal J. Ghimire
Abstract: Topologically protected nanoscale spin textures, such as magnetic skyrmions, have attracted significant interest for spintronics applications. While skyrmions in noncentrosymmetric materials are known to be stabilized by Dzyaloshinskii$-$Moriya interaction (DMI), their deliberate design in centrosymmetric materials remains a challenge. This difficulty largely stems from the complexity of controlling magnetocrystalline anisotropy $-$ a critical factor in the absence of DMI. Here, we demonstrate the chemical tuning of magnetocrystalline anisotropy in the centrosymmetric Kagome magnet TmMn$_6$Sn$_6$. The resulting compound exhibits a spin reorientation transition accompanied by an emergent skyrmion bubble lattice, confirmed by Lorentz transmission electron microscopy. Our findings overcome a key materials design challenge and open possibilities for deliberate design of skyrmionic textures in centrosymmetric systems.

Title: Electric field tunable magnetoexcitons in Xenes-hBN-TMDC, Xenes-hBN-BP, and Xenes-hBN-TMTC heterostructures
Authors: Roman Ya. Kezerashvili, Anastasia Spiridonova, Klaus Ziegler
Abstract: In this work, we propose novel van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures composed of Xenes, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), phosphorene, and transition metal trichalcogenides (TMTCs), which are separated by insulating hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) layers. We investigate theoretically the behavior of Rydberg indirect excitons in Xenes-hBN-TMDC, Xenes-hBN-BP, and Xenes-hBN-TMTC heterostructures, subject to parallel external electric and magnetic fields that are oriented perpendicular to the layers. By incorporating both isotropic and anisotropic materials, we demonstrate that excitonic properties can be effectively tuned through the external field strengths and the heterostructure design. Our results show that the exciton reduced mass and the binding energy increase with the electric field strength, while enhanced dielectric screening from additional hBN layers reduces the binding energy. Anisotropic materials exhibit distinct excitonic responses, including variations in diamagnetic behavior. Moreover, the diamagnetic energy contributions and coefficients decrease with stronger electric fields but increase with the number of hBN layers. Finally, we explore the potential of time-periodic electric fields with Floquet band-structure engineering. These findings provide a comprehensive framework for controlling excitonic phenomena in low-dimensional materials, enabling the design of advanced optoelectronic and quantum devices.

Title: Anomalous phonon magnetic moments
Authors: Swati Chaudhary, Carl P. Romao, Dominik M. Juraschek
Abstract: Circularly polarized phonons conventionally carry an angular momentum and a magnetic moment arising from the circular motions of the atoms around their equilibrium positions in a crystal. Here, we present three cases of anomalous magnetic moments produced by axial phonons that cannot be described in the conventional framework. The three cases include rotationless axial phonons, in which the atoms carry no real, but only pseudo, angular momentum and magnetic moments, diverging gyromagnetic ratios, in which a finite phonon magnetic moment is produced despite nearly vanishing phonon angular momentum, and noncollinear phonon magnetic moments, in which the angular momentum and magnetic moment of the axial phonon are not parallel. Our results shine light on the origin and nature of phonon magnetic moments and open a route towards phononic hidden orders and noncollinear phonomagnetism.

Title: Interplay of Coil-Globule Transitions and Aggregation in Homopolymer Aqueous Solutions: Simulation and Topological Insights
Authors: Junichi Komatsu, Kenichiro Koga, Jonas Berx
Abstract: We investigate the structural and topological behavior of interacting hydrophobic polymer chains in aqueous solutions by combining molecular dynamics simulations with circuit topology (CT) analysis. Combining geometric observables such as the radius of gyration and degree of aggregation with CT data we are able to capture the relationship between the coil-globule and aggregation transitions, resolving the underlying organizational changes of the system. Our results uncover a clear temperature-driven collective transition from isolated coiled polymers to aggregated globular clusters. This transition is reflected not only in conventional geometric descriptors but also in a striking reorganization of CT motifs: from dominant intrachain motifs at low temperatures to a rich ensemble of multichain motifs as temperature increases. We demonstrate that CT motif enumeration reproduces standard contact statistics via combinatorics while simultaneously providing a higher-order, topologically informed view of polymer organization. These findings highlight the power of CT as a structural descriptor for complex soft-matter systems and suggest broad applicability to biologically relevant phenomena.

Title: Catalyst-mediated etching of carbon nanotubes exhibiting electronic-structure insensitivity and reciprocal kinetics with growth
Authors: K. Otsuka, S. Maruyama
Abstract: The selective etching of carbon nanotubes has been widely explored as a post-synthetic route for enriching semiconducting species. As nanoelectronic applications increasingly demand pure semiconducting nanotubes for use in field-effect transistors and other optoelectronic devices, understanding the mechanistic basis of selective removal becomes critical. While etching selectivity is often attributed to electronic structure effects on tube walls, its relevance in the presence of catalyst nanoparticles remains unclear. Here, we directly quantify the catalyst-mediated etching and growth rates of individual single-walled carbon nanotubes using elaborate isotope labeling methods. Surprisingly, in water vapor and methanol environments, catalytic etching proceeds with negligible dependence on tube electronic type, in sharp contrast to non-catalytic oxidation pathways. In-situ Raman analysis upon heating on nanotube ensembles also confirms metallicity-insensitive etching under catalytic conditions, whereas sidewall oxidation without catalysts exhibits pronounced selectivity. Our growth kinetic model, which precisely describes the kinetics of catalytic etching process, motivates kinetic Monte Carlo simulations of nanotube edge dynamics, revealing the reciprocal nature of edge configuration during growth and etching. These findings highlight a fundamental mechanistic distinction between catalytic and non-catalytic reactivity and thus propose that catalytic etching may serve as a diagnostic mirror of growth behavior when using pre-sorted carbon nanotube samples.

Title: Ab initio molecular dynamics of paramagnetic uranium mononitride (UN) using disordered local moments
Authors: Mohamed AbdulHameed, Benjamin Beeler
Abstract: This work presents an investigation of the thermophysical properties of paramagnetic uranium mononitride (UN) using ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations combined with the disordered local moment (DLM) approach. This methodology accurately captures the high-temperature paramagnetic state of UN, addressing the limitations of standard density functional theory (DFT) models. The AIMD+DLM model consistently predicts a cubic crystal structure for UN across all considered temperatures, aligning with experimental observations of its paramagnetic phase. Key thermophysical properties, including the lattice parameter and specific heat capacity, are computed and compared to experimental data. The calculated lattice parameter is somewhat underestimated relative to the empirical correlation, consistent with prior studies modeling UN as a ferromagnetic (FM) or antiferromagnetic (AFM) material. The specific heat capacity exhibits overestimation at low temperatures (300--500 K) and slight underestimation at higher temperatures, while closely following the experimental trend. These results highlight the accuracy and utility of the AIMD+DLM framework in modeling paramagnetic materials, which can offer insights into the influence of the magnetic state on the behavior of nuclear fuels at high temperatures.

Title: Different behaviors of diffusing diffusivity dynamics based on three different definitions of fractional Brownian motion
Authors: Wei Wang, Aleksei V. Chechkin, Ralf Metzler
Abstract: The effects of a "diffusing diffusivity" (DD), a stochastically time-varying diffusion coefficient, are explored within the frameworks of three different forms of fractional Brownian motion (FBM): (i) the Langevin equation driven by fractional Gaussian noise (LE-FBM), (ii) the Weyl integral representation introduced by Mandelbrot and van Ness (MN-FBM), and (iii) the Riemann-Liouville fractional integral representation (RL-FBM) due to L{é}vy. The statistical properties of the three FBM-generalized DD models are examined, including the mean-squared displacement (MSD), mean-squared increment (MSI), autocovariance function (ACVF) of increments, and the probability density function (PDF). Despite the long-believed equivalence of MN-FBM and LE-FBM, their corresponding FBM-DD models exhibit distinct behavior in terms of the MSD and MSI. In the MN-FBM-DD model, the statistical characteristics directly reflect an effective diffusivity equal to its mean value. In contrast, in LE-FBM-DD, correlations in the random diffusivity give rise to an unexpected crossover behavior in both MSD and MSI. We also find that the MSI and ACVF are nonstationary in RL-FBM-DD but stationary in the other two DD models. All DD models display a crossover from a short-time non-Gaussian PDF to a long-time Gaussian PDF. Our findings offer guidance for experimentalists in selecting appropriate FBM-generalized models to describe viscoelastic yet non-Gaussian dynamics in bio- and soft-matter systems with heterogeneous environments.

Title: Leveraging Modified Ex Situ Tomography Data for Segmentation of In Situ Synchrotron X-Ray Computed Tomography
Authors: Tristan Manchester, Adam Anders, Julio Spadotto, Hannah Eccleston, William Beavan, Hugues Arcis, Brian J. Connolly
Abstract: In situ synchrotron X-ray computed tomography enables dynamic material studies, but automated segmentation remains challenging due to complex imaging artefacts and limited training data. We present a methodology for deep learning-based segmentation by transforming high-quality ex situ laboratory data to train models for binary segmentation of in situ synchrotron data, demonstrated through copper oxide dissolution studies. Using a modified SegFormer architecture, our approach achieves high segmentation performance on unseen data while reducing processing time from hours to seconds per 3D dataset. The method maintains consistent performance over significant morphological changes during experiments, despite training only on static specimens. This methodology can be readily applied to diverse materials systems, accelerating the analysis of time-resolved tomographic data across scientific disciplines.

Title: In situ measurement of electrical resistivity evolution during dynamic compression of copper
Authors: K. Yan, Zhaokun Wang, Haijuan Mei, Wanting Sun
Abstract: We report a novel experimental methodology for in situ measurement of electrical resistivity changes in T2 copper during dynamic compression utilizing a split Hopkinson pressure bar. The effects of adiabatic temperature rise and specimen shape deformation on the resistance were carefully accounted, which allowed one to isolate the contribution of microstructure changes such as dislocation evolution, defect generation, and lattice distortion. The latter allows for a real-time relationship between strain and electrical resistivity to be tracked. The experimental findings are also supplemented by molecular dynamics simulations that provide details about the process of microstructure evolution under dynamic loading. Up to now, very few in situ measurements has been carried out for changes in electrical resistivity during dynamic deformation, thus establishing a direct link for resistivity-strain which has important implications toward the understanding of plastic deformation and industrial application guidance.

Title: Few-electron spin qubits in optically active GaAs quantum dots
Authors: Peter Millington-Hotze, Petr Klenovsky, Harry E. Dyte, George Gillard, Santanu Manna, Saimon F. Covre da Silva, Armando Rastelli, Evgeny A. Chekhovich
Abstract: The knowledge of the energy spectrum completely defines the dynamics of a quantum system for a given initial state. This makes spectroscopy a key characterization technique when studying or designing qubits and complex quantum systems. In semiconductor quantum dots, the electronic quantum states can be probed through charge transport spectroscopy, but the electric current itself disrupts the fragile quantum system, and the technique is practically limited to gate-defined quantum dots. Epitaxial quantum dots benefit from excellent optical properties, but are usually incompatible with charge transport, while alternative spectroscopy techniques provide only limited information. Here we demonstrate a spectroscopy technique which utilizes nuclear spins as a non-invasive probe. By using spin currents instead of the charge currents we achieve near-equilibrium probing. Experiments are conducted on low-strain GaAs/AlGaAs epitaxial dots, revealing energy spectra for charge configurations with up to seven electrons and the subtle properties of the multi-electron states. The rich variety of observations includes long-lived spin-qubit states in s and p shells, ground-state phase transitions, strong spin-orbit coupling regimes, and anomalously fast nuclear spin diffusion. Experiments are backed up by good agreement with the first-principles configuration-interaction numerical modelling. Our work uncovers few-electron states as a new operating regime for optically active quantum dots. Accurate control and probing of many-body states offers a test-bed system for fundamental physics studies, while prospective technological applications include electron spin qubits with extended coherence and scalable electrical control.

Title: $X$-type electrides hosting skin-like interstitial electron states and doping-enhanced superconductivity
Authors: Da-Bao Zha, Peng Jiang, Yan-Ling Li, Hai-Qing Lin
Abstract: The exploration of electrides is of great significance for the fundamental physics due to their unique properties arising from interstitial anionic electrons. Here we report a novel class of $X$-type electrides, distinguished by two distinct anionic electron subchannels forming alternating chains in real space. Through structural symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations, we identify two-dimensional $M_2$N ($M$ = Ti, Zr, Hf) materials as prototypical systems exhibiting these unique features. The anionic electron channels on the upper and lower surfaces of these materials display a vertically alternating pattern, with their projected bands revealing momentum-dependent splitting behavior in the reciprocal space, protected by a crystal symmetry operation $O$. Notably, the $X$-type electride characteristic is independent of the layer number and remains robust on the upper and lower surfaces of layered structures, presenting a pronounced skin-like effect. Additionally, we have explored the superconductivity of these systems, and found that both Ti$_2$N and Zr$_2$N are intrinsic superconductors with superconducting transition temperatures below 1.0 K. Further results show that appropriate hole doping can significantly enhance their superconducting transition temperatures and can induce the Hf$_2$N monolayer to exhibit superconductivity. Our findings provide valuable insights into the design and tuning of novel electrides with enhanced superconducting properties, offering a new pathway for deeply understanding the interplay between electride behavior and superconductivity in novel materials.

Title: Control of active field theories at minimal dissipation
Authors: Artur Soriani, Elsen Tjhung, Étienne Fodor, Tomer Markovich
Abstract: Advances in experimental techniques enable the precise manipulation of a large variety of active systems, which constantly dissipate energy to sustain nonequilibrium phenomena without any equilibrium equivalent. To design novel materials out of active systems, an outstanding challenge is to rationalize how material properties can be optimally controlled by applying external perturbations. However, equilibrium thermodynamics is inadequate to guide the control of such nonequilibrium systems. Therefore, there is a dire need for a novel framework to provide a systematic toolbox for the thermodynamic control of active matter. Here, we build an optimization procedure for generic active field theories within a thermodynamically consistent formulation. Central to our approach is the distinction between the protocol heat, which is dissipated only during manipulation, and the total heat, which also accounts for the post-manipulation dissipation. We demonstrate that the latter generically features a global minimum with respect to the protocol duration. We deploy our versatile approach to an active theory of phase separation, and examine the scalings of the optimal protocol duration with respect to activity and system size. Remarkably, we reveal that the landscape of steady-state dissipation regulates the crossover between optimal control strategies for a finite duration.

Title: CO$_2$ adsorption and photocatalytic reduction mechanisms on Ti-terminated CaTiO$_3$ (100) surface: a DFT study
Authors: Onofrio Tau, Giacomo Giorgi, Riccardo Rurali
Abstract: Photoreduction of CO$_2$ is an important alternative approach aimed to reduce the CO$_2$ atmospheric content which is responsible of the global warming. The development of an efficient photocatalyst can strongly improve the efficiency and selectivity of the by-products of such a process. Recently, CaTiO$_3$ has been used as an alternative semiconductor catalyst due to its attractive properties. In this study, we use calculations of the electronic structure of first principles to investigate for the first time the general reaction mechanism that leads to the main value-added by-products of HCOOH, CO, H$_3$COH and CH$_4$ byproducts, focusing on the reactions of adsorption, activation and reduction reactions of CO$_2$ molecules on the Ti-terminated CaTiO$_3$ (100) surface. We compute adsorption energies of the various intermediate configurations and activation energy barriers of the chemical reaction pathways. Our results show that CO$_2$ can be activated by charge transfer of excess electrons leading to a CO$_2$ anion that probably gives HCOO by the first reduction; however, the second hydrogenation to HCOOH is impeded by the prohibitive energy barrier. In particular, activated CO$_2$ can also easily undergo decomposition, which facilitates CO production. Afterwards, we discuss the possible reaction mechanisms of CO photoreduction towards H$_3$COH and CH$_4$ value-added products, taking into account the experimental evidence that only CO and CH$_4$ have been detected. The reaction pathway generally follows the most energetically convenient routes characterized by activated intermediates. Even though H$_3$COH could be finally produced, its strong adsorption ($E_{ads}$ of -0.93 eV) and its promoted decomposition to H$_3$CO+H on the surface could explain why it has not been detected, as opposed to CH$_4$ whose $E_{ads}$ is only -0.22 eV due to its non-polar nature.

Title: Synergistic Role of Transition Metals and Polyanionic Frameworks in Phosphate-Based Cathode Materials for Sodium-Ion Batteries
Authors: Madhav Sharma, Riya Gulati, Rajendra S. Dhaka
Abstract: Ongoing research in the area of advanced cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) is expected to reduce reliance on lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), providing more affordable and sustainable energy storage solutions. Polyanionic compounds have emerged as promising options due to their stable structure and ability to withstand high-voltage conditions as well as fast charging capabilities. This review offers a thorough discussion of phosphate-based polyanionic cathodes for SIBs, exploring their structure, electrochemical performance with various transition metals, and existing challenges. We discuss different polyanionic frameworks, such as ortho-phosphates, fluoro-phosphates, pyro-phosphates, mix pyro-phosphates, and NASICON-based phosphates, highlighting their unique structural characteristics and ability to perform well across a wide potential range. Further, we delve into the mechanisms governing sodium storage and tunability of redox potentials in polyanionic materials, providing insights into the factors that affect their electrochemical performance. Finally, we outline future research directions and potential avenues for the practical applications of polyanionic high-voltage cathodes in sodium-ion battery technologies.

Title: Inverse Sandwich Geometry and Stability of B$_7$Y$_2$ Clusters: A DFT Study
Authors: Peter Ludwig Rodríguez-Kessler
Abstract: In this work, we use density functional theory (DFT) to investigate the structural and electronic properties of B$_7$Y$_2$ clusters -- boron frameworks doped with two yttrium atoms. Our results show that the most stable configuration adopts an inverse sandwich geometry, while higher-energy isomers ($\sim$1.45 eV above) exhibit B$_7$ wheel-like motifs with yttrium at top or bridge sites. To understand the bonding and stability, we analyze the electron localization function (ELF) and localized orbital locator (LOL) maps. The global minimum shows a symmetric, delocalized electron distribution, strong B-B covalent bonding, and partial charge transfer from Y atoms. In contrast, higher-energy isomers show less effective Y-B interactions. ELF and LOL analyses confirm electron delocalization within the boron framework. Mulliken population analysis reveals significant metal-to-boron charge transfer, contributing to the stability of the inverse sandwich structure through synergistic effects of delocalized bonding and charge redistribution.

Title: Fluctuation-induced first-order superfluid transition in unitary $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ Fermi gases
Authors: Georgii Kalagov
Abstract: We investigate the superfluid phase transition in an $\mathrm{SU}(N)$-symmetric Fermi gas with $N$ distinct spin states using the functional renormalization group. To capture pairing phenomena beyond mean-field theory, we introduce an auxiliary bosonic field and employ the leading order of the derivative expansion of the partially bosonized effective average action. By discretizing the effective potential on a grid and numerically integrating the flow equations, we resolve the thermodynamic behavior near the transition. Our results reveal a fluctuation-induced first-order phase transition for $N \geq 4$, which is absent at the mean-field level. In the unitary regime, we provide quantitative predictions for the critical temperature, as well as for the discontinuities in the superfluid gap and entropy density as functions of $N$. With increasing $N$, the critical temperature decreases, while the discontinuities become more pronounced, indicating a stronger first-order transition.

Title: Charge and pair density waves in a spin and valley-polarized system at a Van-Hove singularity
Authors: Avigail Gil, Erez Berg
Abstract: We study a single component (i.e., single valley, spin-polarized) two-dimensional electron gas with $C_{3v}$ symmetry tuned to a Van-Hove (VH) singularity. Generically, there may be either three or six VH points at the Fermi level, related to each other by symmetry. Using a renormalization group analysis, we show that when the effective interactions between electrons at the VH points are positive, the system is stable. In contrast, if the effective interactions are negative, the system develops an instability toward either pair density wave (PDW) or charge density wave (CDW) orders, depending on the anisotropy of the dispersion at the VH points. The PDW may have either a single wavevector or multiple wavevectors. The PDW phase with three coexisting wavevectors can support fractional $\tfrac{h}{6e}$ vortices. The interplay between the geometry of the Fermi surface and the singularity of the density of states is the key that enables PDW formation.

Title: Predicting neutron experiments from first principles: A workflow powered by machine learning
Authors: Eric Lindgren, Adam J. Jackson, Erik Fransson, Esmée Berger, Svemir Rudić, Goran Škoro, Rastislav Turanyi, Sanghamitra Mukhopadhyay, Paul Erhart
Abstract: Machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool in materials discovery, enabling the rapid design of novel materials with tailored properties for countless applications, including in the context of energy and sustainability. To ensure the reliability of these methods, however, rigorous validation against experimental data is essential. Scattering techniques -- using neutrons, X-rays, or electrons -- offer a direct way to probe atomic-scale structure and dynamics, making them ideal for this purpose. In this work, we describe a computational workflow that bridges machine learning-based simulations with experimental validation. The workflow combines density functional theory, machine-learned interatomic potentials, molecular dynamics, and autocorrelation function analysis to simulate experimental signatures, with a focus on inelastic neutron scattering. We demonstrate the approach on three representative systems: crystalline silicon, crystalline benzene, and hydrogenated scandium-doped BaTiO3, comparing the simulated spectra to measurements from four different neutron spectrometers. While our primary focus is inelastic neutron scattering, the workflow is readily extendable to other modalities, including diffraction and quasi-elastic scattering of neutrons, X-rays, and electrons. The good agreement between simulated and experimental results highlights the potential of this approach for guiding and interpreting experiments, while also pointing out areas for further improvement.

Title: Time-reversal symmetry breaking in microscopic single-crystal Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ devices
Authors: Remko Fermin, Matthijs Rog, Guido Stam, Daan Wielens, Joost Ridderbos, Chuan Li, Yoshi Maeno, Jan Aarts, Kaveh Lahabi
Abstract: Time-reversal symmetry breaking superconductivity is a quintessential unconventional quantum state. In Josephson junctions, time-reversal symmetry breaking manifests itself in the supercurrent interference pattern as the invariance of the critical current under the reversal of both transport and magnetic field directions, i.e., $I_\text{c+}(H) = I_\text{c-}(-H)$. So far, such systems have been realized in devices where superconductivity is injected into a deliberately constructed weak link medium, usually carefully tuned by external magnetic fields and electrostatic gating. In this work, we report time-reversal symmetry breaking in spontaneously emerging Josephson junctions without intentionally constructed weak links. This is realized in ultra-pure single-crystal microstructures of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$, an unconventional superconductor with a multi-component order parameter. Here, the Josephson effect emerges intrinsically at the superconducting domain wall, where the degenerate states partially overlap. In addition to violating $I_\text{c+}(H) = I_\text{c-}(-H)$, we find a rich variety of exotic transport phenomena, including a supercurrent diode effect present in the entire interference pattern, two-channel critical current oscillations with a period that deviates from $\Phi_0$, fractional Shapiro steps, and current-switchable bistable states with highly asymmetric critical currents. Our findings provide direct evidence of TRSB in unstrained Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ and reveal the potential of domain wall Josephson junctions, which can emerge in any superconductor where the pairing symmetry is described by a multi-component order parameter.

Title: Composable and adaptive design of machine learning interatomic potentials guided by Fisher-information analysis
Authors: Weishi Wang, Mark K. Transtrum, Vincenzo Lordi, Vasily V. Bulatov, Amit Samanta
Abstract: An adaptive physics-informed model design strategy for machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) is proposed. This strategy follows an iterative reconfiguration of composite models from single-term models, followed by a unified training procedure. A model evaluation method based on the Fisher information matrix (FIM) and multiple-property error metrics is proposed to guide model reconfiguration and hyperparameter optimization. Combining the model reconfiguration and the model evaluation subroutines, we provide an adaptive MLIP design strategy that balances flexibility and extensibility. In a case study of designing models against a structurally diverse niobium dataset, we managed to obtain an optimal configuration with 75 parameters generated by our framework that achieved a force RMSE of 0.172 eV/Å and an energy RMSE of 0.013 eV/atom.

Title: Discrete Time Crystal in quantum Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model
Authors: Aarya Bothra, Arti Garg
Abstract: Discrete time crystals (DTC) have emerged as significant phase of matter for out-of-equilibrium many-body systems in recent years. Here, we study the role of long-range interactions and disorder in stabilizing the DTC phase. Generally, it is believed that a stable DTC phase can be realized in disordered systems with short-range interactions. We study the periodically driven quantum Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model of Ising spin-glass in which all spins are coupled to each other with random couplings. We explore the possibility of DTC phase within three different driving protocols. For all the cases, quantum SK model shows a robust DTC phase with no initial state dependence at all. We compare the periodically driven SK model with other models of long-range interactions with uniform coefficients where randomness is induced through a local field. In complete contrast to the SK model, these models show strong initial state dependence with a large number of initial states showing decay in periodic oscillations in spin-spin correlation function with time.

Title: Melting of a Bosonic Mott Insulator in Kagome Optical Lattices with Sign-Inverted Hopping
Authors: Kazuma Nagao, Daisuke Yamamoto, Seiji Yunoki, Ippei Danshita
Abstract: Using the discrete truncated Wigner approximation (dTWA), we investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics of ultracold bosons confined in optical kagome lattices, focusing on both unfrustrated positive and frustrated negative hopping regimes. We consider a protocol in which the system is initialized in a Mott insulating state at unit filling, and the hopping amplitude is gradually increased from zero. For positive hopping, the melting of the Mott insulator is accompanied by the emergence of a sharp peak in the momentum distribution at the $\Gamma$ point of the lowest band, signaling the onset of superfluidity. In contrast, for negative hopping, the Mott insulator melts into a highly nontrivial state without long-range phase coherence, characterized instead by a broad momentum distribution within the flat band, consistent with recent experimental observations. These results demonstrate the applicability of dTWA to highly frustrated quantum systems and offer a new route for numerically exploring the dynamics of frustrated quantum magnets.

Title: Controlling second-order rogue matter wave and line bright soliton dynamics in 2D Bose-Einstein Condensate with higher-order interactions and gain/loss atoms
Authors: C.E. Nkenfack, O.T. Lekeufack, S. Sabari, R. Yamapi, T.C. Kofane
Abstract: We investigate the two-dimensional modified Gross-Pitaevskii equation, accounting for the effects of atom gain/loss and a time-independent isotropic confining potential, utilizing the Hirota's bilinear method. Through an appropriate bilinear form, we derive exact one-soliton and multi-soliton solutions. These solutions showcase two prominent phenomena: the second-order rogue matter wave with spatio-temporal localization, and the line soliton with double spatial localization. We demonstrate the feasibility of controlling the soliton amplitude and the effects of gain/loss resulting in areas of collapse by suitably tuning the coefficient of higher-order interactions in the Bose-Einstein condensate. Additionally, by exploring the interaction dynamics of the multi-soliton solutions, we identify elastic-type interactions, claiming the intrinsic properties of solitons. The influence of higher-order interactions and gain/loss terms on the interaction dynamics is also thoroughly analyzed. These analyses demonstrate that, within the framework of Bose-Einstein condensates described by the two-dimensional modified Gross-Pitaevskii equation, higher-order interactions provide a means to control the properties of the generated rogue matter waves. Extensive numerical simulations have been carried out, and their convergence with the theoretically predicted results highlights the emergent features of the obtained solutions. The exact analytical solutions derived in this study rigorously satisfy the original governing equation, thereby ensuring their consistency with the numerical findings and confirming their accuracy. Thus, our findings hold promise for potential future applications.

Title: Interplay of Conventional and Spin-Exchange Auger Recombination in Magnetically Doped Quantum Dots
Authors: Valerio Pinchetti, Ho Jin, Clément Livache, Victor I. Klimov
Abstract: Auger processes play a critical role in the behavior of colloidal quantum dots (QDs). While nonradiative Auger recombination is a key performance-limiting factor in light-emitting applications, Auger effects also present exciting opportunities for hot-carrier manipulation in emerging optoelectronic and photochemical technologies. Recent studies have shown that incorporating magnetic manganese (Mn) dopants into QDs enables an ultrafast spin-exchange (SE) mechanism that significantly accelerates Auger recombination and related processes. However, the fundamental dynamics of SE-Auger recombination, including its dependence on QD size, exciton multiplicity, and Mn-ion content, remain largely unexplored. Here, we investigate SE-Auger recombination in Mn-doped QDs across three regimes defined by the energetic alignment between the QD band-edge exciton and the internal Mn spin-flip transition: resonant, downhill, and uphill, corresponding to the exciton energy being approximately equal to, greater than, or smaller than the Mn spin-flip transition energy, respectively. We find that SE-Auger recombination dominates multiexciton dynamics in both resonant and downhill regimes, proceeding on ultrafast, sub-picosecond timescales, that is, significantly faster than conventional Auger decay. Notably, SE-Auger lifetimes are primarily governed by the occupancy of intrinsic excitonic states, with minimal dependence on QD size or the number of excited Mn ions. In the uphill regime, SE-Auger recombination coexists with conventional Auger processes, enabling direct comparison of their timescales alongside co-occurring hot-carrier cooling. These findings establish that SE-Auger recombination outpaces phonon-assisted cooling, making it uniquely suited for the generation and manipulation of hot carriers, and opening new avenues in advanced photoconversion and photochemistry.

Title: Signatures of Hund$'s$ metal physics in single-layered 3d transition metal oxide, $\mathrm{Sr_2CoO_4}$
Authors: Shivani Bhardwaj, Sudhir Kumar Pandey
Abstract: With density functional theory plus dynamical mean-field theory, we study the influence of Hund's coupling on the nature of electronic correlations in $\mathrm{Sr_2CoO_4}$. Our results suggest strong signatures of Hund's metal physics in this compound. The Co 3$d$ states show large orbital differentiation in the degree of correlations and mass enhancement. The imaginary-time correlation functions suggest the presence of spin-orbital separation and large local charge fluctuations in the system. Breakdown of the Fermi-liquid picture is observed at the lowest calculated temperature for various strengths of Hund's coupling, suggesting the Fermi-liquid coherence scale lower than $\sim$100 K. Interestingly, a sudden emergence of a gapped state is noted for $e_g$ orbitals in its spectral density of states at $\sim$200 K in the vicinity of Fermi-level. Among the Co 3$d$ states 3$d_{z^2}$ and 3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ foster enlarged correlations. This study conclusively identifies $\mathrm{Sr_2CoO_4}$ as the first single-layered 3$d$ transition metal oxide to be classified as Hund's metal.

Title: Gapped Boundaries of Kitaev's Quantum Double Models: A Lattice Realization of Anyon Condensation from Lagrangian Algebras

Abstract: The macroscopic theory of anyon condensation, rooted in the categorical structure of topological excitations, provides a complete classification of gapped boundaries in topologically ordered systems, where distinct boundaries correspond to the condensation of different Lagrangian algebras. However, an intrinsic and direct understanding of anyon condensation in lattice models, grounded in the framework of Lagrangian algebras, remains undeveloped. In this paper, we propose a systematic framework for constructing all gapped boundaries of Kitaev's quantum double models directly from the data of Lagrangian algebras. Central to our approach is the observation that bulk interactions in the quantum double models admit two complementary interpretations: the anyon-creating picture and anyon-probing picture. Generalizing this insight to the boundary, we derive the consistency condition for boundary ribbon operators that respect the mathematical axiomatic structure of Lagrangian algebras. Solving these conditions yields explicit expressions for the local boundary interactions required to realize gapped boundaries. Our construction provides a microscopic characterization of the bulk-to-boundary anyon condensation dynamics via the action of ribbon operators. Moreover, all these boundary terms are supported within a common effective Hilbert space, making further studies on pure boundary phase transitions natural and convenient. Given the broad applicability of anyon condensation theory, we believe that our approach can be generalized to extended string-net models or higher-dimensional topologically ordered systems.

Title: Stokes drag on a sphere in a three-dimensional anisotropic porous medium
Authors: Andrej Vilfan, Bogdan Cichocki, Jeffrey C. Everts
Abstract: We study the hydrodynamic drag force exerted on a sphere in a static anisotropic porous medium. This problem is analysed using the Brinkman-Debye-Bueche equations with an axisymmetric shielding (or permeability) tensor. Using the exact Green's functions for this model fluid within a single-layer boundary element formulation, we numerically compute the friction tensor for a translating sphere subjected to stick boundary conditions. Furthermore, we derive approximate analytical expressions for small anisotropy using the Lorentz reciprocal theorem. By benchmarking this result against the numerical solutions, we find that a linear approximation is valid in a broad parameter regime. Our results are important for studying self-diffusion in general anisotropic porous media, but can also be applied to small tracers in nematic fluids composed of disk- or rod-like crowders.

Title: Maximizing Infrared Transmission Contrast Upon Phase Transition of Thermally Grown Vanadium Dioxide Thin Films by Rapid Thermal Processing
Authors: Ken Araki, Vishwa Krishna Rajan, Liping Wang
Abstract: Pristine vanadium dioxide (VO2), an insulator-to-metal transition (IMT) material, is grown via furnace oxidation followed by rapid thermal annealing with forming gas (5%H2/95%N2) which reduces surface over-oxides such as V2O5 formed during the oxidation. The evolutional IMT behaviors of the thermochromic film and vanadium oxide states over different reduction time are systematically studied with temperature-dependent infrared spectrometry, electrical resistivity, and X-ray diffraction measurements. After optimally reducing surface over-oxides to VO2, infrared transmission contrast upon phase transition is enhanced to 46% (at 9 um wavelength) compared to 23% from fully oxidation without any reduction. Moreover, pristine VO2 thin film obtained from thermal oxidation and optimal reduction processes exhibits sharp phase transition and narrow thermal hysteresis within 2~4°C in both infrared transmission and electrical resistivity, which are comparable to the VO2 of best quality prepared by other sophisticated fabrication techniques. The thermally grown method presented here would facilitate the scalable fabrication of high-quality VO2 thin films and tunable radiative coatings for high-performance thermal control applications.

Title: Spin-Depairing-Induced Exceptional Fermionic Superfluidity
Authors: Soma Takemori, Kazuki Yamamoto, Akihisa Koga
Abstract: We investigate the non-Hermitian (NH) attractive Hubbard model with spin depairing, which is a spin-resolved asymmetric hopping that nonreciprocally operates spins in the opposite direction. We find that spin depairing stabilizes a superfluid state unique to the NH system. This phase is characterized not only by a finite order parameter, but also by the emergence of exceptional points (EPs) in the momentum space - a feature that starkly contrasts with previously discussed NH fermionic superfluidity, where EPs are absent within the superfluid state and emerge only at the onset of the superfluid breakdown. We uncover the rich mechanism underlying this ``exceptional fermionic superfluidity'' by analyzing the interplay between EPs and the effective density of states of the complex energy dispersion. Furthermore, we reveal that the exceptional superfluid state breaks down induced by strong spin depairing on the cubic lattice, while it remains robust on the square lattice.

Title: Evolution of cavities in BCC-Fe with coexisting H and He under fusion environments
Authors: Jin Wang, Fengping Luo, Tao Zheng, Bowen Zhang, Yuxin Liu, Denghuang Chen, Xinyue Xie, Mohan Chen, Hong-Bo Zhou, Fei Gao, Jianming Xue, Yugang Wang, Chenxu Wang
Abstract: In the fusion environment, understanding the synergistic effects of transmutation-produced hydrogen (H), helium (He), and irradiation-induced displacement damage in iron-based alloys is crucial for the development of structural materials for fusion reactors. When H and He atoms are simultaneously introduced into the matrix, the interaction between irradiation-induced cavity defects (voids and bubbles) with H and He, along with their evolutionary behavior remains poorly understood. In this study, the evolutionary behavior of cavities in body-centered cubic (BCC) iron (Fe) with H and He atoms is systematically investigated through a combination of molecular dynamics (MD) calculations and statistical thermodynamics. First, an efficient and suitable set of Fe-H-He ternary potential functions for describing interatomic interactions is established. Based on the newly developed MD model, the evolutionary behavior of H/He atoms and cavities is systematically investigated under various temperature and cavity structure conditions. Specifically, the kinetic process of H/He capture by cavities is elucidated for different scenarios. Additionally, thermodynamic analyses are employed to assess the feasibility of cavity trapping of H under varying conditions. The results exhibit strong consistency with experimental results and provide significant evidence supporting the formation of the core-shell structure (where He is confined at the cavity center while H accumulates at the surface) from both kinetic and thermodynamic perspectives. This work provides mechanistic insights into the nucleation and growth of cavities over extended temporal and spatial scales in the presence of H-He synergies.

Title: Thermodiffusion mechanism for the formation of an amorphous phase during the quenching of a metal melt
Authors: A. I. Karasevskii, A. Yu. Naumuk
Abstract: A theoretical model of the formation of an amorphous phase during the quenching of a metallic melt is proposed. It has been shown that the appearance of a significant temperature gradient during the quenching of a metallic melt leads to thermodiffusion of defects and their outflow from the melt volume, which manifests itself in a significant reduction in the number of free spaces for the diffusion transfer of the atoms of the melt. Due to the thermodiffusion process, a significant restructuring of the microstructure of the medium occurs, which leads to a significant increase in viscosity, a decrease in the diffusion coefficient and specific volume of the substance, and changes in the mechanisms of deformation. The corresponding calculations of temperature distribution, thermodiffusion and distribution of the components of the melt have been carried out.

Title: Evolution of quantum criticality in underdoped cuprates
Authors: Changshuai Lan, Chengyu Yan, Yihang Li, Qiao Chen, Huai Guan, Xinming Zhao, Dong Wu, Butian Zhang, Youwei Zhang, Shun Wang
Abstract: Quantum criticality, with both static and dynamic information of the system intrinsically encoded in characteristic length scales, serves as one of the most sensitive and universal probes to monitor quantum phase transition. Qualitatively different quantum criticality behaviours have been widely observed even in the same condensed matter system. The discrepancy is attributed to sample specificity but has not been systemically addressed. Here we report a single-parameter driven three-stage evolution of quantum criticality unveiled in superconductor-insulator transition in underdoped Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+{\delta} flakes. The evolution starts with a single quantum critical point emerging at the boundary between the superconducting and antiferromagnetic phases, then evolving into anomalous quantum Griffiths singularity at the medium doping levels and eventually being replaced by quantum Griffiths singularity in the deep superconducting regime. A puddle model that incorporates the developments of antiferromagnetic correlation can capture the evolution. The results offer a new aspect to examine previous seemingly sample-specific quantum critical behavior and lay the foundation for further exploring complex quantum criticality in strongly correlated systems; meanwhile they shed light on the detailed interaction between superconductivity and antiferromagnetism in cuprates.

Title: Cholic Acid-Based Mixed Micelles as siRNA Delivery Agents for Gene Therapy
Authors: Alexander J Cunningham, Victor Passos Gibson, Xavier Banquy (UdeM), X.X. X Zhu, Jeanne Leblond Chain (ARNA)
Abstract: Gene therapy is a promising tool for the treatment of various cancers but is hindered by the physico-chemical properties of siRNA and needs a suitable vector for the delivery of siRNA to the target tissue. Bile acid-based block copolymers offers certain advantages for the loading and delivery of siRNA since they can efficiently complex siRNA and bile acids are biocompatible endogenous molecules. In this study, we demonstrate the use of lipids as co-surfactants for the preparation of mixed micelles to improve the siRNA delivery of cholic acid-based block copolymers. Poly(allyl glycidyl ether) (PAGE) and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) were polymerized on the surface of cholic acid to afford a star-shaped block copolymer with four arms (CA-PAGE-b-PEG)4. The allyl groups of PAGE were functionalized to bear primary or tertiary amines and folic acid was grafted onto the PEG chain end to increase cell uptake. (CA-PAGE-b-PEG)4 functionalized with either primary or tertiary amines show high siRNA complexation with close to 100% complexation at N/P ratio of 8. Uniform aggregates with diameters between 181 and 188 nm were obtained. DOPE, DSPE-PEG2k, and DSPE-PEG5k lipids were added as co-surfactants to help stabilize the nanoparticles in the cell culture media. Mixed micelles had high siRNA loading with close to 100% functionalization at N/P ratio of 16 and diameters ranging from 153 to 221 nm. The presence of lipids in the mixed micelles improved cell uptake with a concomitant siRNA transfection in HeLa and HeLa-GFP model cells, respectively.

Title: How rigidity percolation and bending stiffness shape colloidal gel elasticity
Authors: David Richard, Mehdi Bouzid
Abstract: Dispersed colloidal particles within a suspension can aggregate and spontaneously self-organize into a robust, percolating structure known as a gel. These network-like structures are prevalent in nature and play a critical role in many industrial processes, including those involving batteries, food products, and pharmaceutical formulations. In this paper, we examine the emergence of elasticity in colloidal gels. We show that gelation is governed by a rigidity percolation transition. We identify a characteristic correlation length that quantifies the extent of elastic and structural inhomogeneities, which diverges at the critical point. Our findings reveal that, regardless of the interaction types, the particle concentration, or the specific route to non-ergodicity i.e. the preparation protocol, the elastic moduli and vibrational properties of gels can be accurately predicted within a unifying framework, in which the bending modes of fractal clusters -- approximately the size of this correlation length -- dominate under small deformations.

Title: Fermionizing the ideal Bose gas via topological pumping
Authors: Maciej Marciniak, Grigori E. Astrakharchik, Krzysztof Pawłowski, Bruno Juliá-Díaz
Abstract: We investigate the coherence and correlations of many-body states appearing in topological pumping in a one-dimensional Bose gas. By analyzing the system at zero and infinite interaction strengths, we reveal a rescaling of momentum distributions accompanied by a self-similar behavior in first- and second-order correlation functions. In excited states of non-interacting bosons, the momentum distribution shows a comb-like structure similar to that of non-interacting fermions but at a higher density. This is mirrored by Friedel oscillations in the one-body density matrix. At the same time, the density-density correlations still exhibit the bosonic enhancement. Our work illustrates how topological pumping induces a nontrivial mapping between bosonic and fermionic correlations.

Title: Two-dimensional Dual-Switchable Ferroelectric Altermagnets: Altering Electrons and Magnons
Authors: ShuaiYu Wang, Wei-Wei Wang, Jiaxuan Fan, Xiaodong Zhou, Xiao-Ping Li, Lei Wang
Abstract: Ferroelectric altermagnets (FEAMs) offer unique magnetoelectric coupling properties by combining the characteristics of both antiferromagnets and ferromagnets, yet their multifunctional electric control remains largely unexplored. Here, we introduce and investigate a scenario for the simultaneous electrical switching of electronic spin and magnonic chirality splitting in two-dimensional FEAMs. Based on the C2DB database, employing symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations, we study prototypical candidates CrPS$_3$ and V$_2$I$_2$O$_2$BrCl. We identify the mechanism: ferroelectricity arises from asymmetric displacements (P along $z$ in CrPS$_3$, V along the $xy$-direction in V$_2$I$_2$O$_2$BrCl), which inherently couples electric polarization to both electronic and magnonic degrees of freedom by retaining [C$_2$$||$M] symmetry. Our calculations explicitly demonstrate that reversing the ferroelectric polarization concurrently switches the sign of the electronic spin splitting and chirality of magnonic modes. This shows these materials as dual-switchable FEAMs, enabling unified electrical manipulation of electron and magnon properties. A potentially experimentally detectable method via the magneto-optical Kerr effect was derived. This work provides a materials-specific realization and theoretical basis for designing novel electrically controlled multifunctional spintronic, spin caloritronic, and magnonic devices.

Title: A Universal Spin-Orbit-Coupled Hamiltonian Model for Accelerated Quantum Material Discovery
Authors: Yang Zhong, Rui Wang, Xingao Gong, Hongjun Xiang
Abstract: The accurate modeling of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effects in diverse complex systems remains a significant challenge due to the high computational demands of density functional theory (DFT) and the limited transferability of existing machine-learning frameworks. This study addresses these limitations by introducing Uni-HamGNN, a universal SOC Hamiltonian graph neural network that is applicable across the periodic table. By decomposing the SOC Hamiltonian into spin-independent and SOC correction terms, our approach preserves SU(2) symmetry while significantly reducing parameter requirements. Based on this decomposition, we propose a delta-learning strategy to separately fit the two components, thereby addressing the training difficulties caused by magnitude discrepancies between them and enabling efficient training. The model achieves remarkable accuracy (mean absolute error of 0.0025 meV for the SOC-related component) and demonstrates broad applicability through high-throughput screening of the GNoME dataset for topological insulators, as well as precise predictions for 2D valleytronic materials and transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) heterostructures. This breakthrough eliminates the need for system-specific retraining and costly SOC-DFT calculations, paving the way for rapid discovery of quantum materials.

Title: Magnetic order and Li-diffusion in the 1/3-filled Kagome layers of antiperovskite Lithium-ion battery materials (Li$_2$Fe)SO and (Li$_2$Fe)SeO

Abstract: The recently discovered lithium-rich antiperovskites (Li$_2$Fe)SeO and (Li$_2$Fe)SO host lithium and iron ions on the same atomic position which octahedrally coordinates to central oxygens. In a cubic antiperovskite these sites form Kagome planes stacked along the <111> directions which triangular motifs induce high geometric frustration in the diluted magnetic sublattice for antiferromagnetic interactions. Despite their compelling properties as high-capacity Li-ion battery cathode materials, very little is known about the electronic and magnetic properties of lithium-rich antiperovskites. We report static magnetization, Mössbauer, and NMR studies on both compounds. Our data reveal a Pauli paramagnetic-like behaviour, a long-range antiferromagnetically ordered ground state below 50 K and a regime of short-range magnetic correlations up to 100 K. Our results are consistent with a random Li-Fe distribution on the shared lattice position. In addition, Li-hopping is observed above 200 K with an activation energy of E$_a$ = 0.47 eV. Overall, our data elucidate static magnetism in a disordered magnetically frustrated and presumably semimetallic system with thermally induced ion diffusion dynamics.

Title: Step conductance and spin selectivity in a one dimensional tailored conical magnet
Authors: X. Zotos
Abstract: Using an S-matrix formulation we evaluate the conductance of a one dimensional free electron gas in double exchange interaction with a conical magnet. We find integer conductance steps depending on the energy window of the incoming electrons for conical magnets in different orientations and a modulated magnetic field profile. The conductance windows, that we attribute to potential or diffractive scattering, are characterized by spin selectivity depending on the magnetic field direction and chirality.

Title: From local to collective superconductivity in proximitized graphene
Authors: Stefano Trivini, Tim Kokkeler, Jon Ortuzar, Eva Cortés-del Río, Beatriz Viña Bausá, Pierre Mallet, Jean-Yves Veuillen, Juan Carlos Cuevas, Ivan Brihuega, F. Sebastian Bergeret, Jose Ignacio Pascual
Abstract: The superconducting proximity effect induces pairing correlations in metallic systems via Andreev scattering. This effect is particularly intriguing in graphene, as it enables two-dimensional superconductivity that is tunable through doping. Understanding how superconducting correlations propagate within the metal is crucial to unveiling the key factors behind this tunability. Here, we employ scanning tunneling microscopy to investigate the energy and length scales of the proximity effect induced by Pb islands on graphene. Using tip-induced manipulation, we assemble S/N/S junctions with tunable N-region spacing and explore the evolution of the proximitized state in the confined normal region. We find that different doping levels can lead to either localized or collective superconducting states. By combining our experimental results with quasiclassical theory, we demonstrate that interface conductance plays a key role in determining the strength and coherence length of pairing correlations and inter-island coupling. Our findings provide new insights into the design of novel superconducting states and the control of their properties.

Title: Molecular Dynamics Investigation of Static and Dynamic Interfacial Properties in Ice-Polymer Premelting Layers
Authors: Takumi Sato, Ikki Yasuda, Noriyoshi Arai, Kenji Yasuoka
Abstract: Premelting at the ice-polymer interfaces, in which a quasi-liquid layer (QLL) forms below the melting point, is strongly influenced by polymer surface chemistry; however, the molecular-scale mechanisms underlying these effects remain poorly understood. This study employs large-scale molecular dynamics simulations combined with machine learning-assisted analysis to elucidate how polymer type (hydrophilic vs hydrophobic) modulates interfacial premelting. Our simulations reveal that hydrophilic and hydrophobic polymer surfaces have distinct effects on the QLL thickness, interfacial water structure, and diffusivity. Specifically, a hydrophilic polymer interface promotes a thicker QLL with more ordered interfacial water and lower diffusivity, whereas a hydrophobic interface induces a thinner QLL with a less ordered interfacial water structure and higher diffusivity. These results advance the understanding of polymer-mediated interfacial melting phenomena and offer guidance for designing anti-icing and low-friction materials.

Title: Non-Equilibrium Multiplet Excitations probed by the $M_{5,4}$ Branching Ratio in $3d \rightarrow 4f$ X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy
Authors: Tim Amrhein, Beyza Salantur, Ralph Püttner, Niko Pontius, Karsten Holldack, Ru-Pan Wang, Christian Schüßler-Langeheine, Martin Weinelt, Nele Thielemann-Kühn
Abstract: We show that ultrafast electronic $4f$ multiplet transitions in terbium metal are manifested by changes in the relative spectral weight of the $M_5$ and $M_4$ X-ray absorption resonances. Our experimental results are supported by a simulation of excited multiplet spectra with atomistic calculations; they prove that the so-called third rule of Thole and van der Laan, which relates the branching ratio of the spin-orbit split resonances to the total angular momentum $J$ of the excited ion, is also valid in non-equilibrium. The presented detection scheme allows to detect $J$-changing excitation, \textit{i.e}, alterations of spin and orbital states, even in samples without net magnetization. This makes branching-ratio spectroscopy a powerful tool for the quantitative investigation of ultrafast changes in angular momentum $J$.

Title: Ferroelectric and Hyper Dielectric modes in Ferronematic Liquid Crystals
Authors: Rahul Uttam, Neelam Yadav, Alexander Belik, Wanhe Jiang, Georg H. Mehl, Jagdish K. Vij, Yuri P. Panarin
Abstract: Binary mixtures of the ferronematic compound DIO with recently reported non-ferroelectric material WJ-16 which shows Colossal Permittivity (CP) ~5000 and superparaelectricity (SPE) were studied by POM, electrical switching studies, and dielectric spectroscopy. Three mixtures with different contents of WJ-16 as 10, 25 and 50% in DIO as host were prepared. Our original expectation was the development of new nematic materials with both ferroelectric nematic (NF) and non-ferroelectric CP phases. The non-ferroelectric phase in mixtures exhibits a CP mode originally observed in pure WJ-16 and was termed as superparaelectric. However, the dielectric spectroscopy of mixtures shows two distinct relaxation processes: the typical paraelectric response and the CP mode. Therefore, this CP mode cannot be called superparaelectric and is redefined it as Hyper Dielectric mode. This is the first direct demonstration of materials with both ferroelectric and Hyper-dielectric phases in liquid crystalline materials. The hyper dielectric phase has a good potential as a working media for supercapacitors industry.

Title: Oscillation death by mechanochemical feedback
Authors: Phanindra Dewan, Soumyadeep Mondal, Sumantra Sarkar
Abstract: Many cellular proteins, such as ERK, undergo oscillation death when cells are compressed, initiating many developmental processes in organisms. Whether such a transition arises from these proteins' specific biochemistry or generic dynamical features remains unclear. In this paper, we show that coupling mechanics to the chemistry of Hopf oscillators, such as ERK, through mechanochemical feedback (MCF) can generically drive oscillation death upon compression. We demonstrate this result using an active solid, a 1D ring of Brusselators coupled through damped springs, which we term Harmonic Brusselator Ring (HBR). Because of MCF, HBR's dynamics is non-Hermitian and breaks $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry in a scale-dependent manner, generating a rich array of patterns, including traveling pulses, chimera states, intermittent fluctuations, and collective oscillation death. Furthermore, MCF engenders three dynamic phase transitions that separate the observed patterns into four phases. The underlying symmetry of HBR implies that the observed patterns and phases may generically arise in many natural and synthetic systems.

Title: Neuronal correlations shape the scaling behavior of memory capacity and nonlinear computational capability of recurrent neural networks
Authors: Shotaro Takasu, Toshio Aoyagi
Abstract: Reservoir computing is a powerful framework for real-time information processing, characterized by its high computational ability and quick learning, with applications ranging from machine learning to biological systems. In this paper, we demonstrate that the memory capacity of a reservoir recurrent neural network scales sublinearly with the number of readout neurons. To elucidate this phenomenon, we develop a theoretical framework for analytically deriving memory capacity, attributing the decaying growth of memory capacity to neuronal correlations. In addition, numerical simulations reveal that once memory capacity becomes sublinear, increasing the number of readout neurons successively enables nonlinear processing at progressively higher polynomial orders. Furthermore, our theoretical framework suggests that neuronal correlations govern not only memory capacity but also the sequential growth of nonlinear computational capabilities. Our findings establish a foundation for designing scalable and cost-effective reservoir computing, providing novel insights into the interplay among neuronal correlations, linear memory, and nonlinear processing.

Title: Orbital enhanced intrinsic nonlinear planar Hall effect for probing topological phase transition in CuTlSe$_{2}$
Authors: Fan Yang, Xu-Tao Zeng, Huiying Liu, Cong Xiao, Xian-Lei Sheng, Shengyuan A. Yang
Abstract: The intrinsic nonlinear planar Hall effect proposed in recent studies offers a new way to probe intrinsic band geometric properties in a large class of materials. However, the search of material platforms with a large response remains a problem. Here, we suggest that topological Weyl semimetals can host enhanced intrinsic nonlinear planar Hall effect. From a model study, we show that the enhancement is mainly from the orbital contribution, and the response coefficient exhibits a characteristic resonance-like lineshape around the Weyl-point energy. Using first-principles calculations, we confirm these features for the concrete material CuTlSe$_{2}$. Previous studies have reported two different topological states of CuTlSe$_{2}$. We find this difference originates from two slightly different structures with different lattice parameters. We show that the nonlinear planar Hall response is much stronger in the Weyl semimetal state than in the topological insulator state, and the large response is indeed dominated by orbital contribution amplified by Weyl points. Our work reveals a close connection between nonlinear orbital responses and topological band features, and suggests CuTlSe$_{2}$ as a suitable platform for realizing enhanced nonlinear planar Hall effect.

Title: Eppur si muove: Shape of topological defects -- in active nematics
Authors: Giacomo Marco La Montagna, Sumeja Burekovic, Ananyo Maitra, Cesare Nardini
Abstract: Topological defects in systems with liquid-crystalline order are crucial in determining their large-scale properties. In active systems, they are known to have properties impossible at equilibrium: for example, $+1/2$ defects in nematically-ordered systems self-propel. While some previous theoretical descriptions relied on assuming that the defect shape remains unperturbed by activity, we show that this assumption can lead to inconsistent predictions. We compute the shape of $-1/2$ defects and show that the one of $+1/2$ is intimately related to their self-propulsion speed. Our analytical predictions are corroborated via numerical simulations of a generic active nematic theory.

Title: Spectroscopic signature of anisotropic order parameter in Kagome lattice superconductor LaRh$_3$B$_2$
Authors: Mona Garg, Nikhlesh S. Mehta, Ghulam Mohmad, Savita Chaudhary, Yogesh Singh, Goutam Sheet
Abstract: The physics of the Kagome metal LaRh$_3$B$_2$ along with its superconductivity below 2.6 K, unlike other popular Kagome metals, is not known to be significantly influenced by the electron correlations. While the indirect techniques to probe the bulk superconducting properties of LaRh$_3$B$_2$ indicate a conventional isotropic order parameter, we show that the direct spectroscopic determination of the superconducting energy gap reveals an anomalous suppression of Andreev reflection between LaRh$_3$B$_2$ and a normal metal. This observation hints to the presence of incomplete superconducting gap formation, at least along certain momentum directions, and consequent low-lying quasiparticle states. An analysis of multiple Andreev reflection spectra captured at different points on the surface of LaRh$_3$B$_2$ reveals a distribution of the superconducting energy gap which is consistent with an anisotropic superconducting order parameter.

Authors: Kiroubanand Sankaran, Kristof Moors, Jean-Philippe Soulié, Christoph Adelmann, Geoffrey Pourtois
Abstract: The challenge of increasing copper (Cu) resistivity with diminishing Cu interconnect dimensions in complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) transistors, along with the imperative for efficient electron transport paths to fulfill scaling requirements in interconnects is significant. First-principles electronic structures calculations based on density functional theory have been performed to evaluate the potential scalability of some Cu, Al, Ru and Mo based binary alloys to replace Cu. We evaluate the expected sensitivity of the resistivity of these binary alloys to reduced line dimensions with a figure of merit that is based on generalized finite-temperature transport tensors. These transport tensors allow for a straightforward comparison between highly anisotropic intermetallics with given transport directions and Cu, and are evaluated together with their resistance to electromigration. Based on the figure-of-merit analysis, we identify several aluminides that show potential to outperform Cu at reduced interconnect dimensions in terms of their electronic transport and reliability properties.

Title: Non-Classical Spin-Phonon Correlations Induced by Rydberg Facilitation in a Lattice
Authors: Daniel Brady, Michael Fleischhauer
Abstract: We investigate the interplay between mechanical forces and the internal-state dynamics of a chain of Rydberg atoms trapped in tweezer arrays under the facilitation constraint. Dipole interactions between Rydberg atoms couple electronic (spin) degrees of freedom with excited motional (phonon) states. We show that this interaction leads to highly correlated and non-classical phonon states in the form of squeezed center of mass position states of the Rydberg atoms. Coupling with either a normal or an inverted Lennard-Jones-type potential, resulting from an avoided crossing of Rydberg potential curves, leads to in-phase or out-of-phase correlated oscillations in the atom positions respectively. Furthermore, the growth dynamics of a finite cluster of excited Rydberg atoms can be mapped to the dynamics of a single particle in a semi-infinite lattice subject to a linear potential gradient caused by spin-phonon interactions. This results in Bloch oscillations in the spin cluster size, which in turn localize spin excitations in the system.

Title: Dimer in the Hubbard model. Exact and approximate solutions
Authors: Gennadiy Ivanovich Mironov
Abstract: Within the tight-binding model taking into account the Coulomb repulsion of electrons at one site (the Hubbard model), an exact calculation of the Fourier transform of the anticommutator Green's function of the C2 dimer as a structural element of fullerene, the poles of which determine the energy spectrum of the studied nanosystem, was performed. Graphic representations of the equation for the chemical potential and the density of state of electrons were obtained. A solution for the dimer was obtained within the approximation of static fluctuations. The Fourier transform of the anticommutator Green's function, obtained in the approximation of static fluctuations, coincided with a similar function obtained within the exact solution. The ionization energy and electron affinity were calculated and found to be 11.87 eV and 3.39 eV, respectively. It was concluded that the method for solving the Hubbard model for the C2 dimer in the approximation of static fluctuations proposed in the work can be a fairly adequate method for theoretical study of strongly correlated systems.

Title: Theory of Non-Linear Electron Relaxation in Thin Gold Films and Their Signatures in Optical Observables
Authors: Jonas Grumm, Malte Selig, Holger Lange, Andreas Knorr
Abstract: Based on the momentum-resolved Boltzmann equation, we provide self-consistent numerical calculations of the dynamics of conduction electrons in thin noble metal films after linear and non-linear optical excitations with infrared and terahertz frequencies. Focusing exclusively on electron-phonon interaction, orientational relaxation is introduced and acts as dephasing of the optical excitation on a scale of tens of fs. In the linear regime, our numerical results agree with the experimental fits to a Drude model and predicts for non-linear excitations a field strength dependency of the orientational relaxation rate. In the THz regime, where the orientational relaxation proceeds faster than the oscillation cycle of the excitation THz field, a new high order dissipative Kerr-type non-linearity is predicted. This non-linearity originates from the Pauli blocking included in the electron-phonon scattering and results in a non-linearly increasing transmission of the film, detectable in experiments.

Title: Ultrafast Electrons in Noble Metals: Orientational Relaxation, Thermalization and Cooling in Terms of Electron-Phonon Interaction
Authors: Jonas Grumm, Andreas Knorr
Abstract: We investigate the momentum-resolved dynamics of conduction electrons in noble metals following ultrashort optical excitation with linearly polarized light. Using a momentum-resolved Boltzmann equation approach for electron-phonon interaction, we solve for the combined effects of orientational relaxation, thermalization, and cooling. We introduce momentum orientational relaxation as the initial step in the equilibration of an optically excited non-equilibrium electron gas by highlighting its importance for the optical response of noble metals and the dephasing of plasmonic excitations. Our numerical results for gold reveal that orientational relaxation exists independently of the absorbed optical energy and dominates on time scales on the first tens of fs after excitation. Incorporating also thermalization and cooling on times up to a few ps, our approach provides a simultaneous description of optical and thermal properties of noble metals under initial non-equilibrium conditions.

Title: The charge cycle of group IV vacancy centers in diamond: From DFT to rate equations
Authors: Joshua Claes, Bart Partoens, Dirk Lamoen
Abstract: The silicon vacancy center in diamond is a promising system for quantum technologies due to its exceptional optical and spin properties. This has led to great interest in the silicon-vacancy center as well as in the other group IV vacancy centers. In this work, we model the charge cycle of the group IV vacancy centers from the $-2$ to $0$ charge state. As a first step, we compute the onset energies for all relevant one- and two-step ionization processes. Based on these results, we then derive the rate equations using Fermi's golden rule.

Title: Bio-Derived Graphite from Pterocarpus marsupium Leaves for rGO-MoO$_3$ Nanocomposites with Enhanced Photocatalytic Efficiency
Authors: P. Princeya Mary, M. Kumaresavanji, P. Sundara Venkatesh, N. Kannan, V. Vasumathi
Abstract: This study presents a sustainable approach to synthesize bio-graphite from Pterocarpus marsupium (Indian Kino) leaves without using chemical catalysts, activating agents, or organic solvents. The resulting bio-graphite was used to produce reduced graphene oxide (rGO) via a modified Hummers method. The bio-graphite derived rGO was further incorporated with orthorhombic structured MoO$_3$ at different percentages (1, 3, and 6 wt.%) using ultrasonication. Structural, morphological, and functional characterizations were conducted using XRD, FESEM, FTIR, and UV-Vis DRS spectroscopy, revealing a bandgap of 2.82 eV for the rGO(3 wt.%)-MoO$_3$ composite. Photocatalytic activity was evaluated via methylene blue degradation under natural sunlight. The rGO(3 wt.%)-MoO$_3$ nanocomposite showed superior performance, achieving 90% degradation in 150 minutes when compared to 65% by pure MoO$_3$. The Scavenger tests confirmed superoxide radicals $(\cdot O_2^-)$ as the main reactive species. This work highlights the potential of bio-graphite derived rGO-MoO$_3$ nanocomposites as efficient, eco-friendly photocatalysts for wastewater treatment.

Title: $η$-pairing states in the Hubbard model with non-uniform Hubbard interaction
Authors: D. K. He, Z. Song
Abstract: The existence of $\eta $-pairing eigenstates in the fermionic Hubbard model is fundamentally rooted in the $\eta $-pairing symmetry, which may hold for systems with non-uniform Hubbard interaction $U$. In this work, we present a generalized Hubbard model containing a variety of pseudo-spin terms that break the SO$_{4}$ symmetry but retain the $\eta $-pairing symmetry. This allows us to construct a variety of correlated systems possessing $\eta $% -pairing eigenstates.\ We exemplify our findings by considering a modified Hubbard model associated with alternative magnetic fields and on-site repulsion. We find that the same quasi-$\eta $-pairing eigenstate exhibits two distinct dynamic behaviors in the two models. Numerical results of the time evolution driven by several typical Hamiltonians accord with the analytic predictions and provide a way of the control of an $\eta $-pairing wavepacket with the aid of a time-dependent Hamiltonian.

Title: Interpretable machine learning-guided design of Fe-based soft magnetic alloys
Authors: Aditi Nachnani, Kai K. Li-Caldwell, Saptarshi Biswas, Prince Sharma, Gaoyuan Ouyang, Prashant Singh
Abstract: We present a machine-learning guided approach to predict saturation magnetization (MS) and coercivity (HC) in Fe-rich soft magnetic alloys, particularly Fe-Si-B systems. ML models trained on experimental data reveals that increasing Si and B content reduces MS from 1.81T (DFT~2.04 T) to ~1.54 T (DFT~1.56T) in Fe-Si-B, which is attributed to decreased magnetic density and structural modifications. Experimental validation of ML predicted magnetic saturation on Fe-1Si-1B (2.09T), Fe-5Si-5B (2.01T) and Fe-10Si-10B (1.54T) alloy compositions further support our findings. These trends are consistent with density functional theory (DFT) predictions, which link increased electronic disorder and band broadening to lower MS values. Experimental validation on selected alloys confirms the predictive accuracy of the ML model, with good agreement across compositions. Beyond predictive accuracy, detailed uncertainty quantification and model interpretability including through feature importance and partial dependence analysis reveals that MS is governed by a nonlinear interplay between Fe content, early transition metal ratios, and annealing temperature, while HC is more sensitive to processing conditions such as ribbon thickness and thermal treatment windows. The ML framework was further applied to Fe-Si-B/Cr/Cu/Zr/Nb alloys in a pseudo-quaternary compositional space, which shows comparable magnetic properties to NANOMET (Fe84.8Si0.5B9.4Cu0.8 P3.5C1), FINEMET (Fe73.5Si13.5B9 Cu1Nb3), NANOPERM (Fe88Zr7B4Cu1), and HITPERM (Fe44Co44Zr7B4Cu1. Our fundings demonstrate the potential of ML framework for accelerated search of high-performance, Co- and Ni-free, soft magnetic materials.

Title: TDP-43 multidomains and RNA modulate interactions and viscoelasticity in biomolecular condensates
Authors: Yui Matsushita, Ikki Yasuda, Fuga Watanabe, Eiji Yamamoto
Abstract: RNA-binding proteins form biomolecular condensates with RNA through phase separation, playing crucial roles in various cellular processes. While intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) are key drivers of phase separation, additional factors such as folded domains and RNA also influence condensate formation and physical properties. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this regulation remain elusive. Here, using molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate how the multidomain structure of TDP-43, which consists of its IDR, RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), and N-terminal domain (NTD), interacts with RNA and affects the characteristics of phase separation. Our analysis reveals that interaction sites within the IDR undergo dynamic rearrangement, driven by key residues that depend on the specific combination of folded domains. Upon RNA binding, several intermolecular interactions of TDP-43 are replaced by TDP-43-polyA interactions, altering viscoelastic properties of the condensate. Specifically, RRMs enhance viscosity, whereas the NTD reduces it. The presence of polyA increases elasticity, making viscosity and elasticity comparable in magnitude. These findings suggest that the multidomain structure of TDP-43 and its RNA interactions orchestrate condensate organization, modulating their viscoelastic properties.

Title: Stainless steel in an electronically excited state
Authors: Nikita Medvedev
Abstract: Austenitic stainless steel (Fe$_{0.5875}$Cr$_{0.25}$Mn$_{0.09}$Ni$_{0.07}$C$_{0.0025}$) is modeled with the XTANT-3 simulation toolkit to evaluate its properties in an electronically excited state produced by ultrafast laser irradiation. The model relies on density-functional tight binding to obtain the electronic Hamiltonian, producing the electronic energy levels and wave functions. They are used to calculate the electron heat capacity, electron heat conductivity, and electron-phonon coupling parameter at the electronic temperatures up to 25,000 K. It is revealed that stainless steel nonthermally melts at sub-picosecond timescales at the deposited dose of ~1.4 eV/atom (the electronic temperature $T_e \sim 10,000$ K): the atomic lattice disorders due to modifications of the interatomic potential induced by the excitation of electrons, even without electron-phonon coupling (Born-Oppenheimer approximation). Including the electron-phonon coupling (non-Born-Oppenheimer simulation) lowers the damage threshold dose to ~0.45 eV/atom, triggering atomic disorder at picosecond timescales via thermal melting, predicated on the atomic heating by electrons.

Title: Crystal field excitations in rattling clathrate CeBa$_7$Au$_6$Si$_{40}$
Authors: Michelangelo Tagliavini, Federico Mazza, Xinlin Yan, Andrey Sidorenko, Kevin Ackermann, Andrey Prokofiev, Kurt Kummer, Silke Paschen, Maurits W. Haverkort
Abstract: We investigate the local crystal-field environment of cerium in the clathrate compound CeBa$_7$Au$_6$Si$_{40}$ (Ce-BAS) using resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) and magnetic susceptibility measurements. Ce-BAS is a rare example of a system where heavy-fermion physics coexists with low-energy rattling phonon modes, making it a candidate for enhanced thermoelectric performance. Magnetic susceptibility measurements reveal a temperature-dependent local moment that cannot be explained within a static crystal-field model. A fit to the susceptibility data requires strong mixing between the j = 5/2 and j = 7/2 crystal-field states, which implies large internal splittings inconsistent with RIXS spectra. In contrast, RIXS data are well described by a model with negligible j = 5/2 - j = 7/2 mixing and an energy separation of 12 meV between the ground and first excited crystal-field states. The inability to reconcile these two datasets within a static framework points to a dynamical modification of the crystal-field potential. We attribute this to coupling between the Ce 4f electrons and low-energy phonons associated with the Ce rattling motion. This interpretation is consistent with theoretical predictions of phonon-enhanced Kondo effects and dynamical Jahn-Teller distortions. Our results highlight the need for multi-orbital impurity models that include phonon coupling to fully describe the low-energy physics of Ce-BAS.

Title: Unconventional Relaxation Dynamics in Co_8Zn_7Mn_5 and Co_8Zn_8Mn_4: Evidence of Inertial Effects
Authors: P. Saha, M. Singh, P. D. Babu, S. Patnaik
Abstract: Magnetization relaxation dynamics serve as an essential tool for uncovering the intrinsic mechanisms governing the magnetic response and energy dissipation in magnetic systems. In this work, we examine the relaxation dynamics for Beta Mn type Co_8Zn_7Mn_5 and Co_8Zn_8Mn_4 across a frequency range of 1 kHz to 10 kHz, spanning different magnetic phases. While most magnetic systems tend to follow the Debye-like relaxation with non-zero distribution or the Cole-Cole formalism, our analysis reveal that these conventional models fail to capture frequency dependence of ac susceptibility across different magnetic phases in Co_8Zn_7Mn_5 and Co_8Zn_8Mn_4. Instead, an inertial component is needed to successfully describe the dynamics, suggesting the presence of unconventional relaxation behavior. The characteristic relaxation time is found to be of the order of 10^-5 s for both the compositions. The field dependent variation of relaxation time exhibits a non-monotonic nature, with the double peak like structure at the skyrmion phase transitions, implying slower relaxation dynamics at the phase boundaries. Furthermore, the presence of non-zero difference between isothermal and adiabatic susceptibility in the pure phases implies slower relaxation dynamics, which is consistent with the presence of finite dissipation in pure phases. The inertial term has been previously invoked to describe the dynamics in spin ice systems due to the propagation of magnetic monopoles. However, its necessity in this system, points to a wider significance in magnetization dynamics that goes beyond the conventional spin ices and skyrmions.

Title: Creation and Microscopic Origins of Single-Photon Emitters in Transition Metal Dichalcogenides and Hexagonal Boron Nitride
Authors: Amedeo Carbone, Diane-Pernille Bendixen-Fernex de Mongex, Arkady V. Krasheninnikov, Martijn Wubs, Alexander Huck, Thomas W. Hansen, Alexander W. Holleitner, Nicolas Stenger, Christoph Kastl
Abstract: We highlight recent advances in the controlled creation of single-photon emitters in van der Waals materials and in the understanding of their atomistic origin. We focus on quantum emitters created in monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenide semiconductors, which provide spectrally sharp single-photon emission at cryogenic temperatures, and the ones in insulating hBN, which provide bright and stable single-photon emission up to room temperature. After introducing the different classes of quantum emitters in terms of band-structure properties, we review the defect creation methods based on electron and ion irradiation as well as local strain engineering and plasma treatments. A main focus of the review is put on discussing the microscopic origin of the quantum emitters as revealed by various experimental platforms, including optical and scanning probe methods.

Title: Finite temperature phase diagram of the extended Bose-Hubbard model in the presence of disorder
Authors: Madhumita Kabiraj (Department of Physics, University of Calcutta), Raka Dasgupta (Department of Physics, University of Calcutta)
Abstract: We study the finite- and non-zero temperature phase diagram of the Extended Bose-Hubbard Model for both pure and disordered systems. Such a system can be experimentally realized by trapping ultracold Rydberg atoms in optical lattices. By regulating the Rydberg excitation level and the lattice spacing, the system can be engineered to effectively have (i) only the nearest-neighbor interaction and (ii) both nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor interactions. For both of these situations, we construct the mean-field phase diagrams. It is found that the presence of a non-zero temperature significantly changes the phase diagram because now there is a competition between quantum and thermal fluctuations. We observe that conventional Mott insulator (MI) or charge-density-wave (CDW) lobes vanish at higher temperatures. In a pure system, they melt into a normal fluid. In contrast, the only insulating phase that survives at high temperatures in the presence of disorder is a Bose glass. It is evident that the CDW lobes melt at a lower temperature and the Mott lobes melt at higher temperatures. These transition temperatures depend on the on-site and nearest-neighbor interaction strengths, respectively. It is also found that, with the addition of disorder, the insulating lobes are destroyed at a relatively lower temperature. The mathematical framework that we present here is capable of treating long-range interactions, disorder, and finite temperature simultaneously, and versatile enough so that it can be extended to study different forms of disorder or longer-range interactions.

Title: Tunable Topological Superconductivity by Fully Compensated Ferrimagnets
Authors: Yu-Xuan Li, Yicheng Liu, Cheng-Cheng Liu
Abstract: We propose a platform based on a fully compensated ferrimagnet (fFIM) for realizing and controlling topological superconductivity with Majorana bound states across multiple dimensions. Through symmetry analysis and microscopic modeling, we demonstrate that fFIM-based heterostructures host (i) Majorana zero modes localized at the ends of one-dimensional nanowires, (ii) chiral Majorana edge states along two-dimensional boundaries, and (iii) tunable Majorana corner modes in higher-order topological phases. The unique properties of fFIMs enable an electric field to drive topological superconductivity phase transitions and Néel vector orientation to control the spatial distribution of Majorana modes, without external magnetic fields. Crucially, the absence of net magnetization in fFIM-based heterostructures preserves superconductivity, circumventing the usual trade-off between tunability and superconducting coherence in magnetized systems. Our results establish fFIM-based heterostructures as a versatile platform for tunable topological superconductivity.

Title: Anisotropic supercurrent suppression and revivals in a graphene-based Josephson junction under in-plane magnetic fields
Authors: Philipp Schmidt, Katarina Stanojević, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Bernd Beschoten, Vincent Mourik, Christoph Stampfer
Abstract: We report on a tunable Josephson junction formed by a bilayer graphene ribbon encapsulated in WSe$_2$ with superconducting niobium contacts. We characterize the junction by measurements of the magnetic field induced interference pattern, and the AC Josephson effect manifested as "Shapiro steps", examining current dependent hysteresis and junction dynamics. The latter can be tuned by temperature, gate voltage, and magnetic field. Finally, we examine the evolution of the supercurrent when subjected to in-plane magnetic fields. Notably, we observe a strong anisotropy in the supercurrent with respect to the orientation of the in-plane magnetic field. When the field is parallel to the current direction, the supercurrent is suppressed, and shows revivals with increasing magnetic field, whereas it remains almost unaffected when the field is oriented in a perpendicular direction. We suggest that this anisotropy is caused by the dependence of supercurrent interference on the junction geometry.

Title: Infinite temperature transport in the strong coupling regime of a nonintegrable quantum spin chain
Authors: Zhi-Hua Li
Abstract: We study spin transport of the XXZ model with next-nearest neighbor $\Delta_2$ terms. We compute numerically dependence of spin conductivity $\sigma(\omega)$ on the anisotropy $\Delta$ and the ratio $r= \Delta_2/\Delta$, in the large $\Delta$ regime. We find that, when $0<r<1$, the low-frequency conductivity assumes an anomalous form $\sigma(\omega)\approx a \omega^2 + b \Delta^{-2} $. In particular, when $\Delta\to\infty$ the model becomes dynamically constrained and most states are localized. We show, microscopically, existence of magnon bound states in the strong coupling regime, which behave as self-generated disorders for single magnons. Based on this quasiparticle picture, we obtain analytical scalings, which match well with the numerical results.

Title: Dissipative particle dynamics models of encapsulated microbubbles and gas vesicles for biomedical ultrasound simulations
Authors: Nikolaos Ntarakas, Maša Lah, Daniel Svenšek, Tilen Potisk, Matej Praprotnik
Abstract: Ultrasound-guided drug and gene delivery (usdg) enables controlled and spatially precise delivery of drugs and macromolecules, encapsulated in microbubbles (embs) and submicron gas vesicles (gvs), to target areas such as cancer tumors. It is a non-invasive, high precision, low toxicity process with drastically reduced drug dosage. Rheological and acoustic properties of gvs and embs critically affect the outcome of usdg and imaging. Detailed understanding and modeling of their physical properties is thus essential for ultrasound-mediated therapeutic applications. State-of-the-art continuuum models of shelled bodies cannot incorporate critical details such as varying thickness of the encapsulating shell or specific interactions between its constituents and interior or exterior solvents. Such modeling approaches also do not allow for detailed modeling of chemical surface functionalizations, which are crucial for tuning the gv-blood interactions. We develop a general particle-based modeling framework for encapsulated bodies that accurately captures elastic and rheological properties of gvs and embs. We use dissipative particle dynamics to model the solvent, the gaseous phase in the capsid, and the triangulated surfaces of immersed objects. Their elastic behavior is studied and validated through stretching and buckling simulations, eigenmode analysis, shear flow simulations, and comparison of predicted gv buckling pressure with experimental data from the literature. The presented modeling approach paves the way for large-scale simulations of encapsulated bodies, capturing their dynamics, interactions, and collective behavior.

Title: Epitaxial growth of BaBiO3 thin films on SrTiO3(001) and MgO(001) substrates using molecular beam epitaxy and controlling their crystal orientations competition
Authors: Islam Ahmed, Stefan De Gendt, Clement Merckling
Abstract: BaBiO3 has lately gained high research attention as a parent material for an interesting family of alloyed compositions with multiple technological applications. In order to grow a variety of structures, a versatile deposition tool such as molecular beam epitaxy has to be employed. In this work, molecular beam epitaxy growth of BaBiO3 on SrTiO3(001) and MgO(001) substrates is studied. When grown by molecular beam epitaxy on SrTiO3(001) or MgO(001) substrates, BaBiO3 is known to have two competing orientations namely, (001) and (011). Characterization of the thin film is carried out by X-ray diffraction, X-ray reflectivity, atomic force microscopy, Rutherford backscattering, and transmission electron microscopy. Pathways to block the growth of BaBiO3(011) and only grow the technologically relevant BaBiO3(001) are described for both substrates. Understanding of the enabler mechanism of the co-growth is established from epitaxy point of view. This can be beneficially utilized for growth of the different compositions of BaBiO3 material family in a more controlled manner.

Title: Post-buckling of fiber-reinforced soft tissues
Authors: Yang Liu, Rui-Cheng Liu, Wanyu Ma, Alain Goriely
Abstract: Fiber-reinforcement is a universal feature of many biological tissues. It involves the interplay between fiber stiffness, fiber orientation, and the elastic properties of the matrix, influencing pattern formation and evolution in layered tissues. Here, we investigate the deformation of a compressed film bonded to a half-space, where either the film or the substrate exhibits anisotropy. Within the framework of finite elasticity, we formulate nonlinear incremental equations, enabling linear and weakly nonlinear analyses. These analyses yield exact bifurcation conditions and an amplitude equation for surface wrinkling. In particular, for a simple fiber-reinforced model, we show that the bifurcation can be supercritical or subcritical depending on the ratio between the substrate and the film moduli. These findings underscore the pivotal role of fiber-reinforcement in shaping pattern formation in anisotropic tissues and provide insights into the morphological evolution of biological tissues.

Abstract: In strongly correlated transition metal dichalcogenides, an intricate interplay of polaronic distortions, stacking arrangement, and electronic correlations determines the nature of the insulating state. Here, we study the response of the electronic structure to optical excitations to reveal the effect of chemical electron doping on this complex interplay. Transient changes in pristine and electron-doped 1$T$ -TaS$_2$ are measured by femtosecond time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy and compared to theoretical modeling based on non-equilibrium dynamical mean-field theory and density functional theory. The fine changes in the oscillatory signal of the charge density wave amplitude mode indicate phase-dependent modifications in the Coulomb interaction and the hopping. Furthermore, we find an enhanced fraction of monolayers in the doped system. Our work demonstrates how the combination of time-resolved spectroscopy and advanced theoretical modeling provides insights into the physics of correlated transition metal dichalcogenides.

Title: Graph Neural Network Prediction of Nonlinear Optical Properties
Authors: Yomn Alkabakibi, Congwei Xie, Artem R. Oganov
Abstract: Nonlinear optical (NLO) materials for generating lasers via second harmonic generation (SHG) are highly sought in today's technology. However, discovering novel materials with considerable SHG is challenging due to the time-consuming and costly nature of both experimental methods and first-principles calculations. In this study, we present a deep learning approach using the Atomistic Line Graph Neural Network (ALIGNN) to predict NLO properties. Sourcing data from the Novel Opto-Electronic Materials Discovery (NOEMD) database and using the Kurtz-Perry (KP) coefficient as the key target, we developed a robust model capable of accurately estimating nonlinear optical responses. Our results demonstrate that the model achieves 82.5% accuracy at a tolerated absolute error up to 1 pm/V and relative error not exceeding 0.5. This work highlights the potential of deep learning in accelerating the discovery and design of advanced optical materials with desired properties.

Title: Curiosity Driven Exploration to Optimize Structure-Property Learning in Microscopy
Authors: Aditya Vatsavai, Ganesh Narasimha, Yongtao Liu, Jan-Chi Yang, Hiroshu Funakubo, Maxim Ziatdinov, Rama Vasudevan
Abstract: Rapidly determining structure-property correlations in materials is an important challenge in better understanding fundamental mechanisms and greatly assists in materials design. In microscopy, imaging data provides a direct measurement of the local structure, while spectroscopic measurements provide relevant functional property information. Deep kernel active learning approaches have been utilized to rapidly map local structure to functional properties in microscopy experiments, but are computationally expensive for multi-dimensional and correlated output spaces. Here, we present an alternative lightweight curiosity algorithm which actively samples regions with unexplored structure-property relations, utilizing a deep-learning based surrogate model for error prediction. We show that the algorithm outperforms random sampling for predicting properties from structures, and provides a convenient tool for efficient mapping of structure-property relationships in materials science.

Title: Exploring two dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant phases with time reversal symmetry and their transitions with topological operations
Authors: Ryan C. Spieler
Abstract: We use various topological operations to systematically study phase transitions between theories with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and time reversal symmetry in two spacetime dimensions. The phases (and accompanying CFTs) we consider come in two types - bosonic phases that are defined on unorientable manifolds and fermionic phases that are sensitive to a $\text{Pin}^-$ structure. In both cases, our analysis leads to eight phase diagrams, with the two sets of eight connected by fermionization/bosonization. Starting from a seed CFT, we obtain the CFT that governs each transition. Many of these exhibit symmetry enriched criticality. In addition to showing many symmetry enriched CFTs in their natural habitats, our work discusses the fermionic analogs of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ bosonic operations, which we have not seen discussed in the literature.

Title: Textured growth and electrical characterization of Zinc Sulfide on back-end-of-the-line (BEOL) compatible substrates

Abstract: Scaling of transistors has enabled continuous improvements in logic device performance, especially through materials engineering. However, surpassing horizontal limitations in chip manufacturing requires a vertical, third dimension. Three-dimensional integration of high-performance logic demands solving the challenge of low-temperature (less than 450°C) synthesis of high-mobility n-type and p-type semiconductor thin films for back-end-of-line (BEOL) compatible transistors. Metal oxides, particularly indium oxides alloyed with gallium and tungsten, are promising n-type channel materials, but suitable p-type materials for BEOL remain scarce. Zinc sulfide (ZnS), a wide band-gap semiconductor, shows room-temperature p-type conductivity when doped with copper and crystallizes below 400°C. Here, we report growth of crystalline ZnS thin films by pulsed laser deposition on amorphous and polycrystalline surfaces including silicon nitride, thermal silicon dioxide, yttrium oxide, hafnium dioxide, sapphire, platinum, and titanium nitride. X-ray diffraction reveals out-of-plane texturing across all surfaces, while grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering probes in-plane crystalline quality. Surface and interface properties are assessed using X-ray reflectivity and atomic force microscopy. Electrical characterization via J-V measurements (ZnS on Pt) and metal-oxide-semiconductor capacitor (ZnS on silicon dioxide) measurements show low leakage current ($10^{-5} A/cm^2$ at 0.40 MV/cm) and bilayer capacitor behavior, suggesting ZnS is highly intrinsic with minimal electrically active defects. Further work on doping ZnS with copper or other p-type elements is needed to realize ZnS as a dopable wide band-gap semiconductor for BEOL integration. This work demonstrates a novel thin-film growth method for sulfide semiconductors under BEOL-compatible conditions.

Title: Towards Scalable Braiding: Topological Superconductivity Unlocked under Nearly Arbitrary Magnetic Field Directions in Planar Josephson Junctions
Authors: Richang Huang, Yongliang Hu, Xianzhang Chen, Peng Yu, Igor Zutic, Tong Zhou
Abstract: Majorana zero modes (MZM), distinguished by their non-locality and non-Abelian statistics, are central to the pursuit of fault-tolerant topological quantum computing. Planar Josephson junctions (PJJ) have emerged as a promising platform, offering robust and tunable MZM. However, the perceived sensitivity of topological superconductivity to the magnetic field orientation has posed a major obstacle, particularly for scalable network architectures. Here, we uncover that topological superconductivity in PJJ fundamentally persists under nearly arbitrary in-plane magnetic field directions. The apparent collapse of the global gap under misaligned fields originates not from the destruction of superconductivity itself, but from emergent shifted bulk states from other momentum points, which obscure the gap and MZM. By introducing spatial modulations along the junction to scatter and gap out these bulk states, we restore the global topological gap and recover visible MZM. Remarkably, the spatially modulated PJJs render topological superconductivity robust against maligned fields, thereby enabling MZM survival across complex junction networks and facilitating their braiding. We propose a scalable protocol for MZM braiding and fusion with phase or gate control, opening new routes toward scalable topological quantum computing.

Title: A thermodynamic road to gravity and quantum phenomena: non-relativistic self-gravitating weakly nonlocal fluids
Authors: Mátyás Szücs, Péter Ván
Abstract: A thermodynamic analysis of weakly nonlocal non-relativistic fluids is presented under the assumption that an additional scalar field - a so-called internal variable - also contributes to the dynamics. The most general evolution of this field and the constitutive relations for the pressure tensor and the energy current density are determined by the Liu procedure. The classical holography of perfect (i.e., non-dissipative) fluids is generally proved, according to which the divergence of the pressure tensor can be given by the gradient of a corresponding scalar potential. Both Newtonian gravity and quantum fluid mechanics are covered as special cases of our fluid model. The unified framework generalises and couples quantum physics and gravitational phenomena, shedding light on the common background of several known modifications and generalisations together with thermodynamic restrictions.

Title: Temperature Dependent Emission Polarization of GaN Defect Quantum Emitters
Authors: Yifei Geng
Abstract: GaN defect-based quantum emitters are promising candidates for quantum information technologies, although their underlying nature remains elusive. In this work, we present results on the temperature-dependent emission polarization of GaN defect single-photon emitters integrated with solid immersion lenses. The photoluminescence (PL) remains linearly polarized over the temperature range of 10K to 300K, with a slight rotation in the polarization direction observed at intermediate temperatures. Possible mechanisms responsible for this behavior are analyzed, and a roadmap for future research is outlined.

Title: True Solid-State Electrical Conduction of Proteins shows them to be Efficient Transport Media
Authors: Sudipta Bera, Ayelet Vilan, Sourav Das, Israel Pecht, David Ehre, Mordechai Sheves, David Cahen
Abstract: While solid-state protein junctions have shown efficient electron transport over lengths that surpass those of conventional organic semiconducting systems, interfacial or contact effects may obscure the intrinsic protein charge transport properties. Therefore, contact resistance (RC) effects need to be quantified and then minimized, which poses a problem if 4-probe geometries cannot be used. Here we show how RC can be extracted quantitatively from the measured junction resistance (RP) by using the extrapolated zero-length resistance (RZLR) and short-circuit resistance (RS). We used AC (impedance spectroscopy) and DC measurements to examine charge transport in junctions of human serum albumin (HSA) and bacteriorhodopsin (bR) films with varying thicknesses. Three contact configurations, Si-Au, Au-EGaIn, and, in a micropore device (MpD), Au-Pd, were compared. While Si-Au and Au-EGaIn junctions exhibit substantial RC that we ascribe to interfacial oxides and electrostatic protein-electrode interactions, MpD effectively eliminates RC, enabling measuring the intrinsic electron transport across HSA and bR films. The exponential length dependence of RP shows a transport decay constant (beta) that varies with interfacial conditions, underscoring the role of contact engineering. By minimizing RC, exceptionally low beta values (0.7 to 1.1 per nm) are found, proving that, indeed, proteins can have outstanding charge transport efficiencies.

Title: Molecular Determinants of Orthosteric-allosteric Dual Inhibition of PfHT1 by Computational Assessment
Authors: Decheng Kong, Jinlong Ren, Zhuang Li, Guangcun Shan, Zhongjian Wang, Ruiqin Zhang, Wei Huang, Kunpeng Dou
Abstract: To overcome antimalarial drug resistance, carbohydrate derivatives as selective PfHT1 inhibitor have been suggested in recent experimental work with orthosteric and allosteric dual binding pockets. Inspired by this promising therapeutic strategy, herein, molecular dynamics simulations are performed to investigate the molecular determinants of co-administration on orthosteric and allosteric inhibitors targeting PfHT1. Our binding free energy analysis capture the essential trend of inhibitor binding affinity to protein from published experimental IC50 data in three sets of distinct characteristics. In particular, we rank the contribution of key residues as binding sites which categorized into three groups based on linker length, size of tail group, and sugar moiety of inhibitors. The pivotal roles of these key residues are further validated by mutant analysis where mutated to nonpolar alanine leading to reduced affinities to different degrees. The exception was fructose derivative, which exhibited a significant enhanced affinity to mutation on orthosteric sites due to strong changed binding poses. This study may provide useful information for optimized design of precision medicine to circumvent drug-resistant Plasmodium parasites with high efficacy.

Title: Integer Lattice Gas with a sampling collision operator for the fluctuating Navier-Stokes Equation
Authors: Noah Seekins, Alexander Wagner
Abstract: While lattice Boltzmann methods were originally derived as the Boltzmann limit of a Boolean lattice gas, modern improvements to lattice Boltzmann methods have broken this link. Because of this most lattice Boltzmann methods are not unconditionally stable and extending them to model fluctuations is challenging. In this article we show that the integer lattice gas method developed by Blommel and Wagner has a lattice Boltzmann limit corresponding to entropic lattice Boltzmann methods, while also recovering proper ideal gas equilibrium fluctuations. We also show that it is possible to accelerate these integer lattice gases such that they become computationally competitive with the corresponding lattice Boltzmann method.

Title: Realizing supersymmetry in a digitized quantum device
Authors: Sutapa Samanta, Jian-Xin Zhu, Armin Rahmani
Abstract: The tricritical Ising model serves as an example of emergent spacetime supersymmetry, which can arise in condensed matter systems. In this work, we present a variational quantum algorithm to create this tricritical state on a digitized quantum computer. We successfully prepare the state on an IBM quantum device and verify the critical correlations of supercurrents associated with the state. Additionally, we examine how other signatures of supersymmetry, namely universal gap ratios and the central charge, can be probed on quantum devices.

Title: Micromagnons and long-range entanglement in ferrimagnetic ground states
Authors: Marcin Wieśniak, Ankit Kumar, Idriss Hank Nkouatchoua Ngueya
Abstract: While significant attention has been devoted to studying entanglement in photonic systems, solid-state spin lattices remain relatively underexplored. Motivated by this gap, we investigate the entanglement structure of one-dimensional ferrimagnetic chains composed of alternating spin-1/2 and spin-3/2 particles. We characterize the ground-state correlations using exact diagonalization and the Density Matrix Renormalization Group method. Although the bipartite entanglement is restricted to nearest neighbors, we reveal the presence of long-range genuine multipartite entanglement between spatially separated spin pairs. These findings advance our understanding of quantum correlations in ferrimagnetic materials.

Title: On Ising model in magnetic field on the lattice
Authors: Raghav G. Jha
Abstract: We conjecture an approximate expression for the free energy in the thermodynamic limit of the classical square lattice Ising model in a uniform (real) magnetic field. The zero-field result is well known due to Onsager for more than eighty years, but no such result exists for a nonzero magnetic field on a regular lattice. We verify our conjecture using numerical tensor renormalization group (TRG) methods and find good agreement with a maximum deviation of $\sim2\%$ from the numerical results for the free energy across all $\beta$ and real magnetic field, $h$.

Title: Far from equilibrium hydrodynamics of nonthermal fixed points
Authors: Jürgen Berges, Gabriel S. Denicol, Michal P. Heller, Thimo Preis
Abstract: Nonthermal fixed points are paradigmatic far-from-equilibrium phenomena of relevance to high-energy physics, cosmology, and cold atomic gases. We propose that, despite their intrinsically nonequilibrium nature, nonthermal fixed points give rise to hydrodynamic excitations otherwise known in the vicinity of thermal equilibrium. As a result, nonthermal fixed points can also be characterized by transport coefficients, such as a far-from-equilibrium, and therefore manifestly time-dependent, incarnation of shear viscosity. We corroborate our proposal with explicit studies using relativistic kinetic theory with binary collisions of massless particles in the 14-moment approximation and comparisons to QCD kinetic theory simulations.

Title: Tunable optical bistability of two-dimensional tilted Dirac system
Authors: Vivek Pandey, Pankaj Bhalla
Abstract: We study the phenomenon of controlling the light by light known as the optical bistability for the two-dimensional tilted Dirac system. Using the Boltzmann approach under relaxation time approximation, we find that the optical bistability can be controlled by the nonlinear response of the system. For the prototype, we consider an inversion symmetry broken system. We find that the optical bistability associated with the nonlinear response is tunable with the strength of the tilt, gap and chemical potential. This suggests the inputs for the development of future-generation optical devices.

Title: Reshaping MOFs Text Mining with a Dynamic Multi-Agent Framework of Large Language Agents
Authors: Zuhong Lin, Daoyuan Ren, Kai Ran, Sun Jing, Xiaotiang Huang, Haiyang He, Pengxu Pan, Xiaohang Zhang, Ying Fang, Tianying Wang, Minli Wu, Zhanglin Li, Xiaochuan Zhang, Haipu Li, Jingjing Yao
Abstract: The mining of synthesis conditions for metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) is a significant focus in materials science. However, identifying the precise synthesis conditions for specific MOFs within the vast array of possibilities presents a considerable challenge. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising solution to this problem. We leveraged the capabilities of LLMs, specifically gpt-4o-mini, as core agents to integrate various MOF-related agents, including synthesis, attribute, and chemical information agents. This integration culminated in the development of MOFh6, an LLM tool designed to streamline the MOF synthesis process. MOFh6 allows users to query in multiple formats, such as submitting scientific literature, or inquiring about specific MOF codes or structural properties. The tool analyzes these queries to provide optimal synthesis conditions and generates model files for density functional theory pre modeling. We believe MOFh6 will enhance efficiency in the MOF synthesis of all researchers.

Title: Simulation of a rapid qubit readout dependent on the transmission of a single fluxon
Authors: Waltraut Wustmann, Kevin D. Osborn
Abstract: The readout speed of qubits is a major limitation for error correction in quantum information science. We show simulations of a proposed device that gives readout of a fluxonium qubit using a ballistic fluxon with an estimated readout time of less than 1 nanosecond, without the need for an input microwave tone. This contrasts the prevalent readout based on circuit quantum electrodynamics, but is related to previous studies where a fluxon moving in a single long Josephson junction (LJJ) can exhibit a time delay depending on the state of a coupled qubit. Our readout circuit contains two LJJs and a qubit coupled at their interface. We find that the device can exhibit single-shot readout of a qubit -- one qubit state leads to a single dynamical bounce at the interface and fluxon reflection, and the other qubit state leads to a couple of bounces at the interface and fluxon transmission. Dynamics are initially computed with a separate degree of freedom for all Josephson junctions of the circuit. However, a collective coordinate model reduces the dynamics to three degrees of freedom: one for the fluxonium Josephson junction and one for each LJJ. The large mass imbalance in this model allows us to simulate the mixed quantum-classical dynamics, as an approximation for the full quantum dynamics. Calculations give backaction on the qubit at $\leq 0.1\%$.

Title: Sparks: Multi-Agent Artificial Intelligence Model Discovers Protein Design Principles
Authors: Alireza Ghafarollahi, Markus J. Buehler
Abstract: Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) promise autonomous discovery, yet most systems still resurface knowledge latent in their training data. We present Sparks, a multi-modal multi-agent AI model that executes the entire discovery cycle that includes hypothesis generation, experiment design and iterative refinement to develop generalizable principles and a report without human intervention. Applied to protein science, Sparks uncovered two previously unknown phenomena: (i) a length-dependent mechanical crossover whereby beta-sheet-biased peptides surpass alpha-helical ones in unfolding force beyond ~80 residues, establishing a new design principle for peptide mechanics; and (ii) a chain-length/secondary-structure stability map revealing unexpectedly robust beta-sheet-rich architectures and a "frustration zone" of high variance in mixed alpha/beta folds. These findings emerged from fully self-directed reasoning cycles that combined generative sequence design, high-accuracy structure prediction and physics-aware property models, with paired generation-and-reflection agents enforcing self-correction and reproducibility. The key result is that Sparks can independently conduct rigorous scientific inquiry and identify previously unknown scientific principles.

Title: Phases of Floquet code under local decoherence
Authors: Yuchen Tang, Yimu Bao
Abstract: Floquet code is a dynamical quantum memory with a periodically evolving logical space. As a defining feature, the code exhibits an anyon automorphism after each period, giving rise to a non-trivial evolution of each logical state. In this paper, we study the Floquet code under local decoherence and demonstrate that below the decoherence threshold, the code is in a robust phase characterized by the anyon automorphism. We first derive the 3D statistical mechanics model for the maximum likelihood decoder of the 2D Floquet code under local Pauli decoherence. We identify a class of two-qubit Pauli channels under which the 3D statistical mechanics model becomes decoupled 2D models and obtain the threshold for such decoherence channels. We then propose a diagnostic of the anyon automorphism in the presence of local decoherence. We analytically show that this diagnostic distinguishes the Floquet code from the toric code under repeated syndrome measurements and undergoes a phase transition at the threshold.

Title: A correspondence between the Rabi model and an Ising model with long-range interactions
Authors: Bruno Scheihing-Hitschfeld, Néstor Sepúlveda
Abstract: By means of Trotter's formula, we show that transition amplitudes between coherent states in the Rabi model can be understood in terms of a certain Ising model featuring long-range interactions (i.e., beyond nearest neighbors) in its thermodynamic limit. Specifically, we relate the transition amplitudes in the Rabi Model to a sum over $n$ binary variables of the form of a partition function of an Ising model with $n$ spin sites, where $n$ is also the number of steps in Trotter's formula. From this, we show that a perturbative expansion in the energy splitting of the two-level subsystem in the Rabi model is equivalent to an expansion in the number of spin domains in the Ising model. We conclude by discussing how calculations in one model give nontrivial information about the other model, and vice-versa, as well as applications and generalizations this correspondence may find.

Title: Modeling and Optimization of Transistor Voltage Amplifiers Based on Stochastic Thermodynamics
Authors: Xiaoxuan Peng, Xiaohu Ge
Abstract: As transistor sizes reach the mesoscopic scale, the limitations of traditional methods in ensuring thermodynamic consistency have made power dissipation optimization in transistor amplifiers a critical challenge. Based on stochastic thermodynamics, a transistor voltage amplifier model is first proposed as a new insight to investigate nonlinear relationships between the power dissipation and voltage gain for complementary symmetric voltage amplifier circuits (CSVACs). Utilizing the proposed model, the phenomenon, i.e., the power dissipation exponentially increases with the increase of voltage gain in CSVACs, is first clarified by an analytical expression to quantify the impact of voltage gain and input signal amplitude on the power dissipation. Considering the characteristic of power dissipation, a new multistage architecture is proposed to reduce the power dissipation in CSVACs. To optimize the power dissipation by adjusting the number of stages and the voltage gain at each stage, an optimal multistage scheme is proposed for multistage CSVACs. Simulation and experimental results show up to 99.36% and 94.59% power dissipation reduction compared with traditional CSVACs by the proposed optimal multistage scheme, respectively.

Title: Yang-Mills flows for multilayered graphene
Authors: Vasilii Iugov, Nikita Nekrasov
Abstract: We clarify the origin of magic angles in twisted multilayered graphene using Yang-Mills flows in two dimensions. We relate the effective Hamiltonian describing the electrons in the multilayered graphene to the ${\bar\partial}_{A}$ operator on a two dimensional torus coupled to an $SU(N)$ gauge field. Despite the absence of a characteristic class such as $c_{1}$ relevant for the quantum Hall effect, we show that there are topological invariants associated with the zero modes occuring in a family of Hamiltonians. The flatbands in the spectrum of the effective Hamiltonian are associated with Yang-Mills connections, studied by M.~Atiyah and R.~Bott long time ago. The emergent $U(1)$ magnetic field with nonzero flux is presumably responsible for the observed Hall effect in the absence of (external) magnetic field. We provide a numeric algorithm transforming the original single-particle Hamiltonian to the direct sum of ${\bar\partial}_{A}$ operators coupled to abelian gauge fields with non-zero $c_1$'s.

Title: Rapid passage to ordered states in Rydberg atom arrays
Authors: Liang Zeng, Fei Zhu, Li Chen, Heng Shen
Abstract: Given a finite lifetime, a ubiquitous challenge in quantum systems is how to prepare a target state in the shortest possible time. This issue is particularly relevant for Rydberg atom arrays in optical tweezers where the dephasing time is typically restricted to a few microseconds. In this work, we develop a rapid passage to ordered many-body states in a Rydberg atomic chain, which allows the transition of the system to various ordered phases in the phase diagram, such as the Z$_2$-, Z$_3$-, and Z$_4$-ordered antiferromagnetic states. Our scheme ramps the parameter in a "non-adiabatic to quasi-adiabatic to non-adiabatic (NQN)" manner. The NQN configuration significantly reduces the time cost required for the state preparation using entirely adiabatic methods, and is generally appliable to sizable number of atoms. Moreover, we experimentally validate the NQN scheme on the neutral-atom quantum cloud computer Aquila.

Title: Rumor propagation on hypergraphs
Authors: Kleber A. Oliveira, Pietro Traversa, Guilherme Ferraz de Arruda, Yamir Moreno
Abstract: The rapid spread of information and rumors through social media platforms, especially in group settings, motivates the need for more sophisticated models of rumor propagation. Traditional pairwise models do not account for group interactions, a limitation that we address by proposing a higher-order rumor model based on hypergraphs. Our model incorporates a group-based annihilation mechanism, where a spreader becomes a stifler when the fraction of hyperedges aware of the rumor exceeds a threshold. Our model has two distinct subcritical behaviors: exponential and power-law decay, which can coexist depending on the heterogeneity of the hypergraph. Interestingly, our analysis reveals continuous phase transitions in both homogeneous and heterogeneous hypergraphs, challenging the idea that higher-order interactions lead to discontinuous transitions. Finally, we validate our model using empirical data from Telegram and email cascades, providing additional evidence that real-world rumor propagation tends to occur near criticality. These results open the door to a more detailed understanding of rumor dynamics in higher-order systems.

Title: Emergence of Imaginary Time Crystals in the non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model
Authors: E. Slootman, L. Eek, C. Morais Smith, R. Arouca
Abstract: Parity-time symmetry constrains the spectrum of non-Hermitian systems to be either real or come in complex conjugate pairs. The transition between a symmetry-preserving phase with real energies and a symmetry-broken phase with complex energies is marked by exceptional points, one of the hallmarks of non-Hermitian systems. Because of these properties, these systems are widely studied, both theoretically and experimentally. In this work, we investigate the thermodynamic properties of the gain and loss Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model for both bosons and fermions, and establish the existence of an imaginary time crystal phase, an imaginary time analogue of a time crystal. This phase occurs when there is a resonance condition between the Matsubara frequencies and the spectrum of the system, making the Green's function of the system oscillate in imaginary time with the Matsubara frequency. We show that this phase appears in the symmetry-broken region. In particular, the topological edge states of this system exhibit oscillations that are present for bosons. Finally, we discuss the applicability of our results for experiments. We examine signatures of these phases in terms of correlation functions in real time and oscillations in thermodynamic potential in inverse temperature $\beta$, and explore possible experimental platforms to realize this system.

Title: Classical simulation of parity-preserving quantum circuits
Authors: Carolin Wille, Sergii Strelchuk
Abstract: We present a classical simulation method for fermionic quantum systems which, without loss of generality, can be represented by parity-preserving circuits made of two-qubit gates in a brick-wall structure. We map such circuits to a fermionic tensor network and introduce a novel decomposition of non-Matchgate gates into a Gaussian fermionic tensor and a residual quartic term, inspired by interacting fermionic systems. The quartic term is independent of the specific gate, which allows us to precompute intermediate results independently of the exact circuit structure and leads to significant speedups when compared to other methods. Our decomposition suggests a natural perturbative expansion which can be turned into an algorithm to compute measurement outcomes and observables to finite accuracy when truncating at some order of the expansion. For particle number conserving gates, our decomposition features a unique truncation cutoff reducing the computational effort for high precision calculations. Our algorithm significantly lowers resource requirements for simulating parity-preserving circuits while retaining high accuracy, making it suitable for simulations of interacting systems in quantum chemistry and material science. Lastly, we discuss how our algorithm compares to other classical simulation methods for fermionic quantum systems.

Title: Second-Order Compatible-Strain Mixed Finite Elements for 2D Compressible Nonlinear Elasticity
Authors: Mohsen Jahanshahi, Damiano Pasini, Arash Yavari
Abstract: In recent years, a new class of mixed finite elements -- compatible-strain mixed finite elements (CSMFEs) -- has emerged that uses the differential complex of nonlinear elasticity. Their excellent performance in benchmark problems, such as numerical stability for modeling large deformations in near-incompressible solids, makes them a promising choice for solving engineering problems. Explicit forms exist for various shape functions of first-order CSMFEs. In contrast, existing second-order CSMFEs evaluate shape functions using numerical integration. In this paper, we formulate second-order CSMFEs with explicit shape functions for the displacement gradient and stress tensor. Concepts of vector calculus that stem from exterior calculus are presented and used to provide efficient forms for shape functions in the natural coordinate system. Covariant and contravariant Piola transformations are then applied to transform the shape functions to the physical space. Mid-nodes and pseudo-nodes are used to enforce the continuity constraints for the displacement gradient and stress tensor over the boundaries of elements. The formulation of the proposed second-order CSMFEs and technical aspects regarding their implementation are discussed in detail. Several benchmark problems are solved to compare the performance of CSMFEs with first-order CSMFEs and other second-order elements that rely on numerical integration. It is shown that the proposed CSMFEs are numerically stable for modeling near-incompressible solids in the finite strain regime.

Title: Extremal Ising Gibbs States on Lobachevsky planes
Authors: Matteo D'Achille, Loren Coquille, Arnaud Le Ny
Abstract: We exhibit an uncountable family of extremal inhomogeneous Gibbs measures of the low temperature Ising model on regular tilings of the hyperbolic plane. These states arise as low temperature perturbations of local ground states having a sparse enough set of frustrated edges, the sparseness being measured in terms of the isoperimetric constant of the graph. This result is implied by an extension of the article [9] on regular trees to non-amenable graphs. We argue how we can deduce the extremality of an uncountable subset of the Series-Sinai states [30] at low temperature.

Title: LAMBench: A Benchmark for Large Atomic Models
Authors: Anyang Peng, Chun Cai, Mingyu Guo, Duo Zhang, Chengqian Zhang, Antoine Loew, Linfeng Zhang, Han Wang
Abstract: Large atomic models (LAMs) have undergone remarkable progress recently, emerging as universal or fundamental representations of the potential energy surface defined by the first-principles calculations of atomic systems. However, our understanding of the extent to which these models achieve true universality, as well as their comparative performance across different models, remains limited. This gap is largely due to the lack of comprehensive benchmarks capable of evaluating the effectiveness of LAMs as approximations to the universal potential energy surface. In this study, we introduce LAMBench, a benchmarking system designed to evaluate LAMs in terms of their generalizability, adaptability, and applicability. These attributes are crucial for deploying LAMs as ready-to-use tools across a diverse array of scientific discovery contexts. We benchmark eight state-of-the-art LAMs released prior to April 1, 2025, using LAMBench. Our findings reveal a significant gap between the current LAMs and the ideal universal potential energy surface. They also highlight the need for incorporating cross-domain training data, supporting multi-fidelity modeling, and ensuring the models' conservativeness and differentiability. As a dynamic and extensible platform, LAMBench is intended to continuously evolve, thereby facilitating the development of robust and generalizable LAMs capable of significantly advancing scientific research. The LAMBench code is open-sourced at this https URL, and an interactive leaderboard is available at this https URL.

Title: Probing plexciton dynamics with higher-order spectroscopy
Authors: Simon Büttner, Luca Nils Philipp, Julian Lüttig, Maximilian Rödel, Matthias Hensen, Jens Pflaum, Roland Mitric, Tobias Brixner
Abstract: Coupling molecular transition dipole moments to surface-plasmon polaritons (SPPs) results in the formation of new optical quasiparticles, i.e., plexcitons. Mixing the specific properties of matter excitations and light modes has proven to be an efficient strategy to alter a variety of molecular processes ranging from chemical reactions to exciton transport. Here, we investigate energy transfer in a plexcitonic system of zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc) molecules aggregated in the crystalline {\alpha}-phase and an SPP on a plain gold surface. By tuning the angle of incidence, we vary the degree of mixing between excitonic and SPP character of the excited state. We apply our recently developed higher-order pump-probe spectroscopy to separate the system's fifth-order signal describing the dynamics of two-particle interactions. The time it takes for two quasiparticles to meet and annihilate is a measure of their movement and thus the transport of excitation energy in the system. We find that the transport extracted from the fifth-order signal is surprisingly unaffected by the mixing ratio of exciton and SPP contributions of the plexciton. Using a rate equation model, we explain this behavior by fast transition from the plexcitonic states to many localized excitonic dark states that do not have an SPP contribution. Our results give an indication of how hybrid exciton-plasmon systems should be designed to exploit the delocalization of the involved plasmon modes for improved transport.

Abstract: We elucidate the dynamics induced by a Wilson Line of charge $q$ and electron charge $e$ in $QED_4$ coupled to a real scalar via Yukawa interactions. We observe that there is a range of the fixed product $e^2 q$ with $e\rightarrow 0$ and $q\rightarrow \infty$ for which four-fermion operators play a dominant role for the dynamics of the theory. We uncover the fixed-point dynamics of the theory and analyze their critical behavior.

Title: Non-stabilizerness generation in a multi-particle quantum walk
Authors: Cătălin Paşcu Moca, Doru Sticlet, Balázs Dóra, Angelo Valli, Dominik Szombathy, Gergely Zaránd
Abstract: We investigate the generation of non-stabilizerness, or magic, in a multi-particle quantum walk by analyzing the time evolution of the stabilizer Rényi entropy $M_2$. Our study considers both single- and two-particle quantum walks in the framework of the XXZ Heisenberg model with varying interaction strengths. We demonstrate that the spread of magic follows the light-cone structure dictated by the system's dynamics, with distinct behaviors emerging in the easy-plane ($\Delta < 1$) and easy-axis ($\Delta > 1$) regimes. For $\Delta < 1$, magic generation is primarily governed by single-particle dynamics, while for $\Delta > 1$, doublon propagation dominates, resulting in a significantly slower growth of $M_2$. Furthermore, the magic exhibits logarithmic growth in time for both one and two-particle dynamics. Additionally, by examining the Pauli spectrum, we show that the statistical distribution of level spacings exhibits Poissonian behavior, independent of interaction strength or particle number. Our results shed light on the role of interactions on magic generation in a many-body system.

Title: Grain boundary complexion transitions in olivine with temperature
Authors: Alexandra C. Austin, Sanae Koizumi, Martin Folwarczny, David P. Dobson, Katharina Marquardt
Abstract: Olivine comprises approximately 70 $\%$ by volume of the Earth's upper mantle, making it likely that it controls the mechanical, electrical and seismic properties of the upper mantle. All rocks are composed of crystals separated by grain boundaries, which affect their overall conductivity, strength and viscosity. Here, we present a study of forsterite (Mg$_{2}$SiO$_{4}$) polycrystals synthesised between 1150 $^{\circ}$C and 1390 $^{\circ}$C to obtain samples with different grain sizes. The grain boundary plane distributions (GBPD) were analysed by SEM and EBSD. A reversible change in the GBPD is observed between 1290 $^{\circ}$C and 1390 $^{\circ}$C. The GBPD shows that the most commonly occurring grain boundary planes are {0kl}-type at 1290 $^{\circ}$C and below, while at 1390 $^{\circ}$C, (010) grain boundary planes dominate the average crystal habitus. The least common planes at all temperatures are (100). This reversible transition in the dominant grain boundary plane type is evidence for a temperature-dependent complexion transition occurring between 1290 $^{\circ}$C and 1390 $^{\circ}$C. It is well established that different grain boundary crystallographies are related to different grain boundary properties. We relate the observed grain boundary complexion transition to differences in grain boundary properties observed in previous studies and suggest their influence on bulk rock properties.

Title: Comments on the minimal training set for CNN: a case study of the frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$ Ising model on the square lattice
Authors: Shang-Wei Li, Yuan-Heng Tseng, Ming-Che Hsieh, Fu-Jiun Jiang
Abstract: The minimal training set to train a working CNN is explored in detail. The considered model is the frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$ Ising model on the square lattice. Here $J_1 < 0$ and $J_2 > 0$ are the nearest and next-to-nearest neighboring couplings, respectively. We train the CNN using the configurations of $g \stackrel{\text{def}}{=} J_2/|J_1| = 0.7$ and employ the resulting CNN to study the phase transition of $g = 0.8$. We find that this transfer learning is successful. In particular, only configurations of two temperatures, one is below and one is above the critical temperature $T_c$ of $g=0.7$, are needed to reach accurately determination of the $T_c$ of $g=0.8$. However, it may be subtle to use this strategy for the training. Specifically, for the considered model, due to the inefficiency of the single spin flip algorithm used in sampling the configurations at the low-temperature region, the two temperatures associated with the training set should not be too far away from the $T_c$ of $g=0.7$, otherwise, the performance of the obtained CNN is not of high quality, hence cannot determine the $T_c$ of $g=0.8$ accurately. For the considered model, we also uncover the condition for training a successful CNN when only configurations of two temperatures are considered as the training set.

Title: Thin-wall Single-crystal Gold Nanoelectrodes towards Advanced Chemical Probing and Imaging
Authors: Milad Sabzehparvar, Fatemeh Kiani, Germán García Martínez, Omer Can Karaman, Victor Boureau, Lucie Navratilova, Giulia Tagliabue
Abstract: Thin-wall metal ultramicro- and nanoelectrodes (UMEs/NEs), especially gold NEs, are indispensable for high-resolution electrochemical microscopy, biosensing, and fundamental research. However, their damage susceptibility and the lack of scalable fabrication methods hinder broader adoption. We present a versatile wet-chemical approach for high-throughput fabrication of thin-wall Au NEs/UMEs and multifunctional NEs with ~80% reproducibility. This method is based on a unique template-assisted 1D growth of single-crystalline Au in borosilicate nanopipettes followed by electrochemical contacting with tungsten microwires, and focused ion beam milling, ensuring precise control over NEs dimensions. Adaptable to various metals and integrable in multifunctional probes, the method facilitates batch production of high-quality NEs with standardized electrical connections. Structural and electrochemical characterization reveals a twinned single-crystalline Au core, a seamless Au/glass interface, and highly stable electrochemical performance. Notably, smaller electrodes exhibit higher current densities, enhancing chemical detection sensitivity. Specifically, we demonstrate outstanding spatial (< 200 nm) and current (< 1 pA) resolutions, low limit of detection (~11.0 {\mu}M) and high stability (7 h) in scanning photoelectrochemical microscopy (photo-SECM), by detecting photo-oxidation reaction on atomically smooth Au micro-flakes. We also demonstrate growth in double-barrel pipettes for SECM/SICM probes as well as Pt NEs. Overall, this scalable method addresses longstanding challenges in NEs, paving the way for advanced electrochemical and spectro-electrochemical microscopy, including SERS/TERS integration. With single-crystalline surfaces, these electrodes open new frontiers in catalysis, interfacial electrochemistry, biosensing, and molecular-scale investigations.

Abstract: We develop a diffuse solid method that is versatile and accurate for modeling wetting and multiphase flows in highly complex geometries. In this scheme, we harness N + 1-component phase field models to investigate interface shapes and flow dynamics of N fluid components, and we optimize how to constrain the evolution of the component employed as the solid phase to conform to any pre-defined geometry. Implementations for phase field energy minimization and lattice Boltzmann method are presented. Our approach does not need special treatment for the fluid-solid wetting boundary condition, which makes it simple to implement. To demonstrate its broad applicability, we employ the diffuse solid method to explore wide-ranging examples, including droplet contact angle on a flat surface, particle adsorption on a fluid-fluid interface, critical pressure on micropillars and on Salvinia leaf structures, capillary rise against gravity, Lucas-Washburn's law for capillary filling, and droplet motion on a sinusoidally undulated surface. Our proposed approach can be beneficial to computationally study multiphase fluid interactions with textured solid surfaces that are ubiquitous in nature and engineering applications.

Title: Topological Mixed Valence Model for Twisted Bilayer Graphene
Authors: Liam L.H. Lau, Piers Coleman
Abstract: Song and Bernevig (SB) have recently proposed a topological heavy fermion description of the physics of magic angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG), involving the hybridization of flat band electrons with a relativistic conduction sea. We explore the consequences of this model, seeking a synthesis of understanding drawn from heavy fermion physics and MATBG experiments. We identify a key discrepancy between measured and calculated onsite Coulomb interactions, implicating renormalization effects that are not contained in the current model. With these considerations in mind, we consider an SB model with a single, renormalized onsite interaction between the f-electrons, containing a phenomenological heavy fermion binding potential on the moiré AA-sites. This feature allows the simplified model to capture the periodic reset of the chemical potential with filling and the observed stability of local moment behavior. We argue that a two stage Kondo effect will develop in MATBG as a consequence of the relativistic conduction band: Kondo I occurs at high temperatures, establishing a coherent hybridization at the $\Gamma$ points and a non-Fermi liquid of incoherent fermions at the moiré K-points; at much low temperatures Kondo II leads to a Fermi liquid in the flat band. Utilizing an auxiliary-rotor approach, we formulate a mean-field treatment of MATBG that captures this physics, describing the evolution of the normal state across a full range of filling factors. By contrasting the relative time-scales of phonons and valence fluctuations in bulk heavy fermion materials with that of MATBG we propose a valley-polaron origin to the Coulomb renormalization and the heavy fermion binding potential identified from experiment. We also discuss the possibility that the two-fluid, non-Fermi liquid physics of the relativistic Kondo lattice is responsible for the strange metal physics observed in MATBG.

Title: Spintronics in 2D graphene-based van der Waals heterostructures
Authors: David T. S. Perkins, Aires Ferreira
Abstract: Spintronics has become a broad and important research field that intersects with magnetism, nano-electronics, and materials science. Its overarching aim is to provide a fundamental understanding of spin-dependent phenomena in solid-state systems that can enable a new generation of spin-based logic devices. Over the past decade, graphene and related 2D van der Waals crystals have taken center stage in expanding the scope and potential of spintronic materials. Their distinctive electronic properties and atomically thin nature have opened new opportunities to probe and manipulate internal electronic degrees of freedom. Purely electrical control over conduction-electron spins can be attained in graphene-transition metal dichalcogenide heterostructures, due to proximity effects combined with graphene's high electronic mobility. Specifically, graphene experiences a proximity-induced spin-orbit coupling that enables efficient spin-charge interconversion processes; the two most well-known and at the forefront of current research are the spin Hall and inverse spin galvanic effects, wherein an electrical current yields a spin current and non-equilibrium spin polarization, respectively. This article provides an overview of the basic principles, theory, and experimental methods underpinning the nascent field of 2D material-based spintronics.

Title: Terahertz chiral sub-wavelength cavities breaking time-reversal symmetry via ultra-strong light-matter interaction
Authors: Johan Andberger, Lorenzo Graziotto, Luca Sacchi, Mattias Beck, Giacomo Scalari, Jérôme Faist
Abstract: We demonstrate terahertz chiral sub-wavelength cavities that break time-reversal symmetry by coupling the degenerate linearly polarized modes of two orthogonal sets of nano-antenna arrays using the inter-Landau level transition of a two-dimensional electron gas in a perpendicular magnetic field, realizing normalized light-matter coupling rates up to $\Omega_R/\omega_{\mathrm{cav}} = 0.78$ with a dispersion that is modified by the parasitic capacitive coupling between the orthogonal antennas. The deep sub-wavelength confinement of the nano-antennas means that the ultra-strong coupling regime can be reached even with a small number of carriers compared to Fabry-Perot cavities, making it viable to be used with a variety of 2D materials. The non-degenerate circularly polarized ground state was only obtained after carefully optimizing the optical design to minimize the parasitic coupling to linearly polarized light.

Title: Low temperature phase of AuSn$_{4}$ induced by the van der Waals interactions
Authors: Shivam Yadav, Sajid Sekh, Andrzej Ptok
Abstract: AuSn$_{4}$ is the example of an compound that exhibits topological properties. Recent XRD measurements reveal an ambiguous nature of the crystal structure, as it can be realized with either Aea2 or Ccca symmetry. Motivated by this, we analyze the dynamical stability of the compound. We discuss the role of van der Waals (vdW) corrections within the ab initio calculation. Interestingly, our main result indicates that AuSn$_{4}$ can be unstable with both Aea2 and Ccca symmetries, due to the soft modes in the phonon spectra. From the soft mode analyses we find dynamically stable Pc structure. This structure has always smaller energy than Aea2 or Ccca crystal and it stays independent of the vdW correction. We also show that the comparison of theoretical electronic properties with the experimental ARPES measurements. Our findings may be valuable in the future investigations of AuSn$_{4}$-like compounds.

Title: Scale-invariant phase transition of disordered bosons in one dimension
Authors: Tanul Gupta, Guido Masella, Francesco Mattiotti, Nikolay V. Prokof'ev, Guido Pupillo
Abstract: The disorder-induced quantum phase transition between superfluid and non-superfluid states of bosonic particles in one dimension is generally expected to be of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) type. Here, we show that hard-core lattice bosons with integrable power-law hopping decaying with distance as $1/r^\alpha$ - corresponding in spin language to a $XY$ model with power-law couplings - undergo a non-BKT continuous phase transition instead. We use exact quantum Monte-Carlo methods to determine the phase diagram for different values of the exponent $\alpha$, focusing on the regime $\alpha > 2$. We find that the scaling of the superfluid stiffness with the system size is scale-invariant at the transition point for any $\alpha\leq 3$ - a behavior incompatible with the BKT scenario and typical of continuous phase transitions in higher dimension. By scaling analysis near the transition point, we find that our data are consistent with a correlation length exponent satisfying the Harris bound $\nu \geq 2$ and demonstrate a new universal behavior of disordered bosons in one dimension. For $\alpha>3$ our data are consistent with a BKT scenario where the liquid is pinned by infinitesimal disorder.

Title: Level spacing statistics of two unitary equivalent models with distinct local symmetries
Authors: Biquan Yang, Zijian Xiong
Abstract: The full spectrum and integrability of unitary equivalent models are the same. A standard diagnostic tool of integrability is level spacing statistics which requires separating the full spectrum into sectors according to the symmetry. When two unitary equivalent models have different symmetries, it is interesting to know how their level spacing statistics show consistent conclusions. In this work, we examine the level spacing statistics of two unitary equivalent models with distinct local symmetries. The first model is spin-1 XXZ chain $H$, the second model is obtained by Kennedy-Tasaki transformation $U_{KT}HU_{KT}$. We find that the level spacings of model $H$ follow the statistics of the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble (GOE). However, model $U_{KT}HU_{KT}$ only displays GOE statistics in some sectors after a "hidden non-local symmetry" is resolved, and the other sectors labeled by quantum numbers corresponding to the local symmetries exhibit non-GOE statistics. Additionally, a mapping relation between the levels in the sector $\{Z,X,I\}$ of model $H$ and the sector $\{Z,X,I'\}$ of model $U_{KT}HU_{KT}$ is found, where $Z,X,I$ correspond to the quantum numbers of $\pi$ rotation around $z,x$ axes and bond-centered inversion.

Title: Fundamental temperature exclusively determines the validity of superstatistics
Authors: Constanza Farías, Sergio Davis
Abstract: The theory of superstatistics is a generalization of Boltzmann-Gibbs statistical mechanics which admits temperature fluctuations, and generates non-canonical ensembles from the distribution function of these fluctuations. Recently, some results have been presented showing that superstatistics is not universally applicable, but several conditions on the so-called fundamental inverse temperature function $\beta_F$ must be met by any superstatistical model. In this work we provide a set of neccessary and sufficient conditions for a non-equilibrium steady state model to be expressible by superstatistics, showing that $\beta_F$ by itself determines the existence of a superstatistical distribution of temperature.

Title: Damage Localisation in Fresh Cement Mortar Observed via In Situ (Timelapse) X-ray μCT imaging
Authors: Petr Miarka (1 and 2), Daniel Kytýř (3), Petr Koudelka (3), Vlastimil Bílek (4) ((1) Czech Academy of Sciences, Institute of Physics of Materials, Brno, Czech Republic, (2) Brno University of Technology, Faculty of Civil Engineering, Brno, Czech Republic, (3) Czech Academy of Sciences, Institute of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics, Prague, Czech Republic, (4) VSB - Technical University of Ostrava, Faculty of Civil Engineering, Ostrava-Poruba, Czech Republic)
Abstract: This paper presents the outcome of a study focused on the evolution of internal damage in fresh cement mortar over 25 hours of hardening. In situ timelapse X-ray computed micro-tomography ({\mu}XCT) imaging method was used to detect internal damage and capture its evolution in cement mortar hardening. During {\mu}XCT scans, the temperature released during the cement hydration was measured, which provided insight into the internal damage evolution with a link to a hydration temperature rise. The measured temperature during cement mortar hardening was compared with an analytical model, which showed a relatively good agreement with the experimental data. Using 20 CT scans acquired throughout the observed cement mortar hardening, it was possible to obtain a quantified characterisation of the porous space. Additionally, the use of timelapse {\mu}XCT imaging over 25 hours allowed for studying the crack growth inside the meso-structure including its volume and surface characterisation. The results provide valuable insights into cement mortar shrinkage and serve as a proof-of-concept methodology for future material characterisation.

Title: Lattice dynamics study of electron-correlation-induced charge density wave in antiferromagnetic kagome metal FeGe
Authors: Andrzej Ptok, Surajit Basak, Aksel Kobiałka, Małgorzata Sternik, Jan Łażewski, Paweł T. Jochym, Andrzej M. Oleś, Przemysław Piekarz
Abstract: Electron-correlation-driven phonon soft modes have been recently reported in the antiferromagnetic kagome FeGe compound and associated with the observed charge density wave (CDW). In this paper, we present a systematic investigation of the CDW origin in the context of the ab initio lattice dynamics study. Performing the group theory analysis of the mentioned soft mode, we found that the stable structure has the Immm symmetry and can be achieved by shifts of Ge atoms. Additionally, we show that the final structure realizes a distorted honeycomb Ge lattice as well as a non-flat kagome-like Fe net. For completeness, we present the electronic properties calculations. From the theoretical STM topography simulation, we indicate that the observed CDW occurs in the deformed honeycomb Ge sublattice.

Title: Closely piling up of multiple adhesive fronts in adhesive friction due to re-attachment
Authors: Puyu Cao, Meicheng Yao, Bin Chen
Abstract: As a fundamental force, friction exerts a profound influence on various aspects of our daily lives across multiple disciplines. To understand why adhesive friction is associated with the contact area, here we investigate the generic sliding of elastic solids adhered to a rigid surface by considering re-attachment/healing. We then reveal multiple adhesive fronts closely aligning along the interface with the number of these regions generally increasing with the contact area. These adhesive fronts exhibit rich dynamics and their accumulation along an interface can aid each other through re-attachment/healing in friction, apparently resulting in the increase in the calculated shear-off force with the contact area. Based on these findings, we propose a generalized law of adhesive friction. Our analysis further suggests that accumulating adhesive fronts possibly to a critical area density along the interface can trigger crack-like propagation of individual fronts at high velocities, which potentially bridges the gap between tribology and fracture mechanics. We discuss the relevance of this work to earthquake mechanics, which might provide a unified framework that captures key aspects of fault behavior. We expect that this work can provide a fundamental understanding of healing-mediated interfacial phenomena in diverse systems spanning biology, geology, and engineering.

Title: Defect design in ferroelectrics -- new insights on agglomeration
Authors: Sheng-Han Teng, Anna Grünebohm
Abstract: Functional properties of ferroelectrics and their change with time depend crucially on the defect structure. In particular, point defects and bias fields induced by defect dipoles modify the field hysteresis and play an important role in fatigue and aging. However, a full understanding on how order, agglomeration and strength of defect dipoles affect phase stability and functional properties is still lacking. To close these gaps in knowledge, we screen these parameters by \textit{ab\ initio} based molecular dynamics simulations with the effective Hamiltonian method for the prototypical ferroelectric material (Ba,Sr)TiO$_3$. Our findings suggest that the {\it{active surface area}} of the defects, rather than the defect concentration is the decisive factor. For a fixed defect concentration, clustering reduces the {\it{active surface area}} and thus the defect-induced changes of phase stability and field hysteresis. Particularly planar agglomerates of defects appear as promising route for the material design as their impact on the field hysteresis can be controlled by the field direction and their impact on the phase stability shows a cross-over with the strength of the defect dipoles. For this agglomeration, we furthermore show that a pinched double-loop field hysteresis allows for large recoverable stored energy which can outperform the response of pristine (Ba,Sr)TiO$_3$ even in its paraelectric phase.

Title: Dynamics of Polar-Core Spin Vortices in Inhomogeneous Spin-1 Bose-Einstein Condensates
Authors: Zachary L. Stevens-Hough, Matthew J. Davis, Lewis A. Williamson
Abstract: In the easy-plane phase, a ferromagnetic spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate is magnetized in a plane transverse to the applied Zeeman field. This phase supports polar-core spin vortices (PCVs), which consist of phase windings of transverse magnetization. Here we show that spin-changing collisions cause a PCV to accelerate down density gradients in an inhomogeneous condensate. The dynamics is well-described by a simplified model adapted from scalar systems, which predicts the dependence of the dynamics on trap tightness and quadratic Zeeman energy. In a harmonic trap, a PCV accelerates radially to the condensate boundary, in stark contrast to the azimuthal motion of vortices in a scalar condensate. In a trap that has a local potential maximum at the centre, the PCV exhibits oscillations around the trap centre, which persist for a remarkably long time. The oscillations coincide with the emission and reabsorption of axial spin waves, which reflect off the condensate boundary.

Title: Insulating Half-Heusler TmPdSb with Unusual Band Order and Metallic Surface States
Authors: Shovan Dan, Andrzej Ptok, Orest Pavlosiuk, Karan Singh, Piotr Wiśniewski, Dariusz Kaczorowski
Abstract: We present theoretical and experimental results exploring a half-Heusler compound TmPdSb with unusual band order and metallic surface states. Typically, the half-Heusler systems exhibit topological features in a semimetallic state, and trivial ones in an insulating state. Topological properties of the most of half-Heusler systems are related to the band inversion around the Fermi level, similar to this observed in CdTe/HgTe systems. In the case of TmPdSb we observed the gapped electronic band structure with ``band inversion'' in the conductance band, while the slab-like system realized metallic surface states. The bulk insulating nature of the compound was corroborated by means of electrical transport measurements. The experimental data revealed several features due to the presence of metallic surface states, such as linear magnetoresistance and weak-antilocalization effect, characterized by enhanced coherence length and a very large number of surface conductive channels. Our findings reveal new features of the rare-earth half-Heusler.

Title: Universal Planckian relaxation in the strange metal state of the cuprates
Authors: A. Shekhter, B. J. Ramshaw, M. K. Chan, N. Harrison
Abstract: A major puzzle in understanding high-$T_{\rm c}$ superconductivity is the microscopic origin of the linear-in-temperature ($T$-linear) resistivity in the strange metal state, which persists up to very high temperatures. Implicit to existing theoretical discussions of this universal `{Planckian}' relaxation rate is the assumption that it must also be independent of doping, $p$. Applied to the cuprates, however, this apparently contradicts the observed strong doping-dependence ($\propto 1/p$) of the slope of the $T$-linear resistivity over a wide doping range. Here, we show through a combination of measurements, including optical conductivity and entropy, that the plasma frequency squared $\omega_p^2$ scales as $p$ over a similar doping range. Together, these dependences provide compelling evidence that the relaxation rate $1/\tau$ is indeed doping-independent (i.e. universal) throughout the entire strange metal state. Furthermore, we argue that the entire doping dependence of $\omega_p^2$ can be understood to arise from an effective mass enhancement of a specific form proposed by Anderson [\emph{Science} \textbf{235}, 1196 (1987)] in the context of doped Mott insulators. Such a mass enhancement originates from strong short-range repulsive interactions, while the Planckian relaxation rate itself appears to be an emergent phenomenon of independent physical origin.

Title: Comment on "Fully gapped superconductivity and topological aspects of the noncentrosymmetric superconductor TaReSi"
Authors: Andrzej Ptok
Abstract: In a recent paper [T. Shang et al., Phys. Rev. B 107, 224504 (2023)], the authors study the physical properties of TaReSi compounds having Ima2 structure. This noncentrosymmetric structure is proposed to be the source of topological properties for mentioned compound. However, for a correct description of topological features, it is important to recognize the correct structure of the compound at low temperature. In this Comment, we show that Ima2 cannot be realized by TaReSi and is unstable at low temperature. The Ima2 structure contains the soft modes at S (1/2,0,0) point, which leads to the stable structure with Cm symmetry. Notably, the stable Cm system also has a noncentrosymmetric structure, which can be the actual source of topological properties.

Title: Algorithmic detection of crystal structures from computer simulation data
Authors: Sumitava Kundu, Kaustav Chakraborty, Avisek Das
Abstract: Detection of crystal structures from particle positions of crystalline assemblies formed in computer simulations is an unsolved problem. The standard protocol, formulated in the reciprocal space, for structure determination from experimental diffraction data is not suitable for analysis of computer simulation data, after converting them to the Fourier space. There is a long history of attempts to tackle this problem by analyzing the system in the real space by using ideas of local neighbors and broken symmetries of the crystalline state. In this paper, we propose a heuristic solution to this problem by detecting all possible unit cells directly from particle coordinates obtained in a typical computer simulation. The method is based on well known facts about crystal structures, some of which are underutilized in the context of the current problem. These include, the symmetry of the coordination polyhedron and its empirical relationship with directions of lattice vectors for a simple Bravais lattice, and the fact that any complex crystal can be systematically decomposed into multiple Bravais lattices. By using these ideas, along with standard computational techniques like search, clustering and convex hull construction, we were able to handle complex basis and construct all crystallographically viable unit cells from the coordinates. The method is capable of handling statistical noise by employing certain cutoffs and deals with multicomponent systems in a transparent manner. We validated it on real Monte Carlo simulation data and variety of test systems, including crystals with tens of particles in the basis. Our heuristic algorithm, which requires minimal human intervention and computational resources, provides a solution to the long standing problem and would be beneficial to the wider communities of condensed matter physics and computational materials science.

Title: Abnormal planar Hall effect and disentanglement of incoherent and coherent transport in a Kondo lattice
Authors: Shuo Zou, Hai Zeng, Zhuo Wang, Guohao Dong, Xiaodong Guo, Fangjun Lu, Zengwei Zhu, Youguo Shi, Yifeng Yang, Yongkang Luo
Abstract: The nature of localized-itinerant transition in Kondo lattice systems remains a mystery despite intensive investigations in past decades. While it is often identified from the coherent peak in magnetic resistivity, recent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and ultrafast optical spectroscopy revealed a precursor incoherent region with band bending and hybridization fluctuations. This raises the question of how the coherent heavy-electron state is developed from an incoherent background of fluctuating localized moments and then established at sufficiently low temperatures. Here, on the example of the quasi-one-dimensional Kondo lattice compound CeCo$_2$Ga$_8$, we show that planar Hall effect and planar anisotropic magnetoresistance measurements provide an effective way to disentangle the incoherent Kondo scattering contribution and the coherent heavy-electron contribution, and a multi-stage process is directly visualized with lowering temperature by their distinct angle-dependent patterns in magneto-transport. Our idea may be extended to other measurements and thereby opens up a pathway for systematically investigating the fundamental physics of Kondo lattice coherence.

Title: Topological transition as a percolation of the Berry curvature
Authors: Han-Byul Kim, Taewon Yuk, Sang-Jin Sin
Abstract: We first study the importance of the sign of the Berry curvature in the Euler characteristic of the two-dimensional topological material with two bands. Then we report an observation of a character of the topological transition as a percolation of the sign of the Berry curvature. The Berry curvature F has peaks at the Dirac points, enabling us to divide the Brillouin zone into two regions depending on the sign of the F: one with the same sign with a peak and the other with the opposite sign. We observed that when the Chern number is non-zero, the oppositely signed regions are localized. In contrast, in the case of a trivial topology, the oppositely signed regions are delocalized dominantly. Therefore, the oppositely signed region will percolate under the topological phase transition from non-trivial to trivial. We checked this for several models including the Haldane model, the extended Haldane model, and the QWZ model. Our observation may serve as a novel feature of the topological phase transition.

Title: Electronic structure of UTe$_2$ under pressure
Authors: Makoto Shimizu, Youichi Yanase
Abstract: A heavy-fermion paramagnet UTe$_2$ has been a strong candidate for a spin-triplet superconductor. Experiments on UTe$_2$ under pressure have been vigorously conducted, and rich phase diagrams have been suggested. Multiple superconducting phases exist in the pressure region of $0 \leq P < 1.8 \mathrm{\;GPa}$, and an antiferromagnetic ordered state is observed in the high pressure region $P > 1.8 \mathrm{\;GPa}$. However, under pressure, the underlying electronic structure in the normal state has not been clarified, although knowledge of electronic structures is essential for studying magnetic and superconducting states. As an indispensable step toward understanding the phase diagram of UTe$_2$, we study the electronic structure under hydrostatic and uniaxial stresses based on the density functional theory with and without employing structural optimization. It is shown that the low-energy band structure and Fermi surfaces are not sensitive to pressure for parameters where itinerant $f$-electrons are not essential. However, we find a significant pressure dependence for a certain Coulomb interaction $U$ of the GGA+$U$ calculation, where the large weight of $f$-electrons appears at the Fermi level. An increase in the density of states at the Fermi level is observed under pressure, which is attributed to compressive stress along the [010] crystallographic axis.

Title: Mechanistic Modeling of Lipid Nanoparticle Formation for the Delivery of Nucleic Acid Therapeutics

Abstract: Nucleic acids such as mRNA have emerged as a promising therapeutic modality with the capability of addressing a wide range of diseases. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) as a delivery platform for nucleic acids were used in the COVID-19 vaccines and have received much attention. While modern manufacturing processes which involve rapidly mixing an organic stream containing the lipids with an aqueous stream containing the nucleic acids are conceptually straightforward, detailed understanding of LNP formation and structure is still limited and scale-up can be challenging. Mathematical and computational methods are a promising avenue for deepening scientific understanding of the LNP formation process and facilitating improved process development and control. This article describes strategies for the mechanistic modeling of LNP formation, starting with strategies to estimate and predict important physicochemical properties of the various species such as diffusivities and solubilities. Subsequently, a framework is outlined for constructing mechanistic models of reactor- and particle-scale processes. Insights gained from the various models are mapped back to product quality attributes and process insights. Lastly, the use of the models to guide development of advanced process control and optimization strategies is discussed.

Title: Impact of Valley Degeneracy on Thermoelectric Properties of Zigzag Graphene Nanoribbons with Staggered Sublattice Potentials and Transverse Electric Fields
Authors: David M T Kuo
Abstract: This study investigates the band inversion of flat bands in zigzag graphene nanoribbons (ZGNRs) using a tight-binding model. The band inversion results from symmetry breaking in the transverse direction, achievable through deposition on specific substrates such as separated silicon carbide or hexagonal boron nitride sheets. Upon band inversion, ZGNRs exhibit electronic structures characterized by valley degeneracy and band gap properties, which can be modulated by transverse electric fields. To explore the impact of this level degeneracy on thermoelectric properties, we employ Green's function techniques to calculate thermoelectric quantities in ZGNR segments with staggered sublattice potentials and transverse electric fields. Two carrier transport scenarios are considered: the chemical potential is positioned above and below the highest occupied molecular orbital. We analyze thermionic-assisted transport (TAT) and direct ballistic transport (DBT). Level degeneracy enhances the electric power factors of ZGNRs by increasing electrical conductance, while the Seebeck coefficient remains robust in the TAT scenario. Conversely, in DBT, the enhancement of the power factor primarily stems from improvements in the Seebeck coefficient at elevated temperatures.

Title: Role of anisotropic confining potential and elliptical driving in dynamics of a Ge hole qubit
Authors: Bashab Dey, John Schliemann
Abstract: The squeezing of a Ge planar quantum dot enhances the Rabi frequency of electric dipole spin resonance by several orders of magnitude due to a strong Direct Rashba spin-orbit interaction in such geometries (Bosco et al 2021 Phys. Rev. B 104 115425). We investigate the geometric effect of an elliptical (squeezed) confinement and its interplay with the polarization of driving field in determining the Rabi frequency of a heavy-hole qubit in a planar Ge quantum dot. To calculate the Rabi frequency, we consider only the p-linear SOIs viz. electron-like Rashba, hole-like Rashba and hole-like Dresselhaus which are claimed to be the dominant ones by recent studies on planar Ge heterostructures. We derive approximate analytical expressions of the Rabi frequency using a Schrieffer-Wolff transformation for small SOI and driving strengths. Firstly, for an out-of-plane magnetic field with magnitude B, we get an operating region with respect to B, squeezing and polarization parameters where the qubit can be operated to obtain 'clean' Rabi flips. On and close to the boundaries of the region, the higher orbital levels strongly interfere with the two-level qubit subspace and destroy the Rabi oscillations, thereby putting a limitation on squeezing of the confinement. The Rabi frequency shows different behaviour for electron-like and hole-like Rashba SOIs. It vanishes for right (left) circular polarization in presence of purely electron-like (hole-like) Rashba SOI in a circular confinement. For both in- and out-of-plane magnetic fields, higher Rabi frequencies are achieved for squeezed configurations when the ellipses of polarization and the confinement equipotential have their major axes aligned but with different eccentricities. We also deduce a simple formula to calculate the effective heavy hole mass by measuring the Rabi frequencies using this setup.

Title: On interactive anisotropic walks in two dimensions generated from a three state opinion dynamics model
Authors: Surajit Saha, Parongama Sen
Abstract: A system of interacting walkers is considered in a two-dimensional hypothetical space, where the dynamics of each walker are governed by the opinion states of the agents of a fully connected three-state opinion dynamics model. Such walks, studied in different models of statistical physics, are usually considered in one-dimensional virtual spaces. Here, the mapping is done in such a way that the walk is directed along the Y-axis while it can move either way along the X-axis. The walk shows that there are three distinct regions as the noise parameter, responsible for driving a continuous phase transition in the model, is varied. In absence of any noise, the scaling properties and the form of the distribution along either axis do not follow any conventional form. For any finite noise below the critical point the bivariate distribution of the displacements is found to be a modified biased Gaussian function while above it, only the marginal distribution along one direction is Gaussian. The marginal probability distributions can be extracted and the scaling forms of different quantities, showing power law behaviour, are obtained. The directed nature of the walk is reflected in the marginal distributions as well as in the exponents.

Title: Analytical expression for $π$-ton vertex contributions to the optical conductivity
Authors: Juraj Krsnik, Anna Kauch, Karsten Held
Abstract: Vertex corrections from the transversal particle-hole channel, so-called $\pi$-tons, are generic in models for strongly correlated electron systems and can lead to a displaced Drude peak (DDP). Here, we derive the analytical expression for these $\pi$-tons, and how they affect the optical conductivity as a function of correlation length $\xi$, fermion lifetime $\tau$, temperature $T$, and coupling strength to spin or charge fluctuations $g$. In particular, for $T\rightarrow T_c$, the critical temperature for antiferromagnetic or charge ordering, the dc vertex correction is algebraic $\sigma_{VERT}^{dc}\propto \xi \sim (T-T_c)^{-\nu}$ in one dimension and logarithmic $\sigma_{VERT}^{dc}\propto \ln\xi \sim \nu \ln (T-T_c)$ in two dimensions. Here, $\nu$ is the critical exponent for the correlation length. If we have the exponential scaling $\xi \sim e^{1/T}$ of an ideal two-dimensional system, the DDP becomes more pronounced with increasing $T$ but fades away at low temperatures where only a broadening of the Drude peak remains, as it is observed experimentally, with the dc resistivity exhibiting a linear $T$ dependence at low temperatures. Further, we find the maximum of the DPP to be given by the inverse lifetime: $\omega_{DDP} \sim 1/\tau$. These characteristic dependencies can guide experiments to evidence $\pi$-tons in actual materials.

Title: Magnetoconductivity of Dirac semimetals and chiral magnetic effect from Keldysh technique
Authors: R.A. Abramchuk, M.A.Zubkov
Abstract: Negative magnetoresistance in Dirac semimetals is typically considered as a manifestation of chiral magnetic effect (CME). The relation between these two phenomena has the status of a hypothesis and is based on sequence of assumptions. We rely on the Keldysh technique of non-equilibrium theory. It allows us to investigate the accumulation of axial charge -- the process that involves both chiral anomaly and relaxation followed by the energy dissipation. We consider the case of strong magnetic field and calculate directly both axial charge density and electric conductivity taking into account both scattering on impurities and interaction with phonons. We obtain the same dependence of axial charge density on electric and magnetic fields, and the same dependence of electric current on axial charge density as the standard heuristic CME calculation. This confirms (in the limit of strong magnetic fields) the hypothesis that the origin of magnetoconductivity in Dirac semimetals is the CME.

Title: Entanglement renormalization of fractonic anisotropic $\mathbb{Z}_N$ Laplacian models
Authors: Yuan Xue, Pranay Gorantla, Zhu-Xi Luo
Abstract: Gapped fracton phases constitute a new class of quantum states of matter which connects to topological orders but does not fit easily into existing paradigms. They host unconventional features such as sub-extensive and robust ground state degeneracies as well as sensitivity to lattice geometry. We investigate the anisotropic $\mathbb{Z}_N$ Laplacian model [1] which can describe a family of fracton phases defined on arbitrary graphs. Focusing on representative geometries where the 3D lattices are extensions of 2D square, triangular, honeycomb and Kagome lattices into the third dimension, we study their ground state degeneracies and mobility of excitations, and examine their entanglement renormalization group (ERG) flows. All models show bifurcating behaviors under ERG but have distinct ERG flows sensitive to both $N$ and lattice geometry. In particular, we show that the anisotropic $\mathbb{Z}_N$ Laplacian models defined on the extensions of triangular and honeycomb lattices are equivalent when $N$ is coprime to $3$. We also point out that, in contrast to previous expectations, the model defined on the extension of Kagome lattice is robust against local perturbations if and only if $N$ is coprime to $6$.

Title: Algorithm for computing perturbation series of dynamical mean field theory
Authors: Corentin Bertrand, Michel Ferrero, Olivier Parcollet
Abstract: We show how to use diagrammatic techniques to compute the weak-coupling perturbation series of the self-consistent solution to a Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT) problem. This approach constitutes an alternative to using diagrammatic techniques directly as an impurity solver. It allows one to bypass the need of multiple perturbative series resummations within the DMFT self-consistency loop. It can be applied at or out of equilibrium, with any diagrammatic formalism, such as real times, imaginary times, or Matsubara frequencies formalisms. As a proof of principle, we illustrate our method with the half-filled Hubbard model on the Bethe lattice in the DMFT approximation, using Quantum Quasi-Monte Carlo (QQMC) to obtain the impurity perturbation series on the real time axis.

Title: Strange metals and planckian transport in a gapless phase from spatially random interactions
Authors: Aavishkar A. Patel, Peter Lunts, Michael S. Albergo
Abstract: `Strange' metals that do not follow the predictions of Fermi liquid theory are prevalent in materials that feature superconductivity arising from electron interactions. In recent years, it has been hypothesized that spatial randomness in electron interactions must play a crucial role in strange metals for their hallmark linear-in-temperature ($T$) resistivity to survive down to low temperatures where phonon and Umklapp processes are ineffective, as is observed in experiments. However, a clear picture of how this happens has not yet been provided in a realistic model free from artificial constructions such as large-$N$ limits and replica tricks. We study a realistic model of two-dimensional metals with spatially random antiferromagnetic interactions in a non-perturbative regime, using numerically exact high-performance large-scale hybrid Monte Carlo and exact averages over the quenched spatial randomness. Our simulations reproduce strange metals' key experimental signature of linear-in-$T$ resistivity with a universal `planckian' transport scattering rate $\Gamma_\mathrm{tr} \sim k_B T/\hbar$ that is independent of coupling constants. We further find that strange metallicity in these systems is not associated with a quantum critical point, and instead arises from a phase of matter with gapless antiferromagnetic fluctuations that lacks long-range correlations and spans an extended region of parameter space: a feature that is also observed in several experiments. These gapless antiferromagnetic fluctuations take the form of spatially localized overdamped modes, whose presence could possibly be detected using recently developed nanoscale magnetometry methods. Our work paves the way for an eventual microscopic understanding of the role of spatial disorder in determining important properties of correlated electron materials.

Title: Temperature-Stable Tunneling Current in Serial Double Quantum Dots: Insights from Nonequilibrium Green Functions and Pauli Spin Blockade
Authors: David M T Kuo
Abstract: We theoretically investigate charge transport through serial double quantum dots (SDQDs) with strong electron correlations using nonequilibrium Green's function techniques. In the linear response regime, we compute the charge stability diagram and analyze the Coulomb oscillatory tunneling current, revealing both thermal and nonthermal broadening effects on the current spectra in relation to two gate voltages. In the nonlinear response regime, we focus on tunneling currents in SDQDs under the Pauli spin blockade (PSB) scenario. We find that current rectification with negative differential conductance is significantly degraded as temperature increases, making it challenging to distinguish between the inter-site spin triplet and singlet states. Notably, we observe a robust reversed tunneling current that remains stable against temperature variations, provided the resonant channel in the PSB scenario is coupled to the states of the right (left) electrode, which is fully occupied (unoccupied) by particles. This characteristic provides valuable insights for designing transistors capable of operating over a wide temperature range.

Title: Topological phase transition in nonchiral Rice-Mele model with bond disorder
Authors: Kiminori Hattori, Kenyu Chikamori, Hayato Iizuka, Ata Yamaguchi
Abstract: The Rice-Mele model consists of a one-dimensional lattice with two sublattice sites in each unit cell subjected to a staggered sublattice potential. The onsite potential constitutes a mass term that breaks chiral symmetry. In this paper, we show that a topological phase transition is induced in this model by disordering intracell and intercell hopping energies unequally, by means of a symmetry-independent global invariant. For small enough mass, the phase transition is accompanied by anomalous localization, which is accounted for in terms of geometric means of random variables. The specific disorder strength at which anomalous localization occurs is independent of mass. In contrast, the critical disorder strength at which the phase transition takes place decreases as mass increases, and eventually becomes invariable for large enough mass. For large enough mass, we show that the phase transition is characterized by arithmetic means instead of geometric means.

Title: Hydrodynamics of particle-hole symmetric systems: a quantum Monte Carlo study
Authors: Adrien Reingruber, Kitinan Pongsangangan, Fakher Assaad, Maksim Ulybyshev
Abstract: The emergence of hydrodynamic behavior in electronic flow within clean, particle-hole-symmetric systems at half-filling is a non-trivial problem. Navier-Stokes (NS) equations describe the momentum flow, while experimental measurements typically capture the current flow profiles. However, in particle-hole-symmetric systems, electric current and momentum flow are entirely decoupled because electrons and holes move in opposite directions with equal distribution functions. This makes it challenging to link NS equations to observed flow patterns. In this work, we demonstrate that the hydrodynamic behavior of the charge current at half filling can emerge despite the absence of momentum flow. By combining Boltzmann transport theory with numerically exact Quantum Monte Carlo simulations of clean graphene samples, we show that NS-type equations can be derived directly for the charge current, eliminating the need for any additional mechanism coupling the velocity field and charge current in explaining the experimentally observed hydrodynamic flow profiles in graphene at half-filling. We show that a new transport quantity - the current diffusion coefficient - replaces viscosity and expect this description to be valid for any particle-hole symmetric system. Our results provide new insights into the interpretation of experimental data and demonstrate how Quantum Monte Carlo calculations can serve as an alternative to experiments in transport measurements to verify the kinetic theory results.

Title: Atomistic insights into Cu segregation effects on irradiation-induced defect dynamics in medium-entropy alloys
Authors: Kazi Tawseef Rahman, Mustofa Sakif Shahriar, Mashaekh Tausif Ehsan, Mohammad Nasim Hasan
Abstract: Copper (Cu) segregation in medium and high-entropy alloys (M/HEAs) has shown significant influence on alloy properties. In this study, we investigate the effect of Cu segregation on evolution of irradiation-induced defects in FeNiCu, a model MEA, using hybrid molecular dynamics (MD) and Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. Thermodynamically driven hybrid MC/MD annealing at low temperature resulted in a partially decomposed Cu-segregated structure (CSS) and was compared with a random solid solution (RSS) and pure Ni. Results through cumulative displacement cascades reveal that Cu-rich domains in CSS act as defect traps, accelerating interstitial-vacancy recombination and suppressing defect cluster growth. The complex potential energy landscape (PEL) in CSS disrupts dislocation propagation, leading to spatially dispersed networks. Notably, CSS exhibits reduced stair-rod dislocation density compared to RSS, highlighting its superior resistance to irradiation swelling. Localized shear strain causes dislocations to preferentially nucleate in/near Cu-rich regions though their growth is hindered by chemical heterogeneity of the alloy. Notably, prolonged irradiation induces slow Cu segregation in the RSS structure, while slowly annihilating pre-existing Cu clusters in CSS simultaneously. The findings provide atomic-scale insights into the interplay between Cu segregation and irradiation-induced defect evolution in MEAs.

Title: Limitations of tensor network approaches for optimization and sampling: A comparison against quantum and classical Ising machines
Authors: Anna Maria Dziubyna, Tomasz Śmierzchalski, Bartłomiej Gardas, Marek M. Rams, Masoud Mohseni
Abstract: Optimization problems pose challenges across various fields. In recent years, quantum annealers have emerged as a promising platform for tackling such challenges. To provide a new perspective, we develop a heuristic tensor network (TN) based algorithm to reveal the low-energy spectrum of Ising spin-glass systems with interaction graphs relevant to present-day quantum annealers. Our deterministic approach combines a branch-and-bound search strategy with an approximate calculation of marginals via TN contractions. Its application to quasi-two-dimensional lattices with large unit cells of up to 24 spins, realized in current quantum annealing processors, requires a dedicated approach that utilizes sparse structures in the TN representation and GPU hardware acceleration. We benchmark our approach on random problems defined on Pegasus and Zephyr graphs with up to a few thousand spins, comparing it against the D-Wave Advantage quantum annealer and Simulated Bifurcation algorithm. Apart from the quality of the best solutions, we compare the diversity of low-energy states sampled by all the solvers. For the biggest considered i.i.d. problems with over 5000 spins, the state-of-the-art TN approach leads to solutions that are $0.1\%$ to $1\%$ worse than the best solutions obtained by Ising machines while being two orders of magnitude slower. We attribute those results to approximate contraction failures. For embedded tile planting instances, our approach gets to approximately $0.1\%$ from the planted ground state, a factor of $3$ better than the Ising solvers. While all three methods can output diverse low-energy solutions, e.g., differing by at least a quarter of spins with energy error below $1\%$, our deterministic branch-and-bound approach finds sets of a few such states at most. On the other hand, both Ising machines prove capable of sampling sets of thousands of such solutions.

Title: Geometric bound on structure factor
Authors: Yugo Onishi, Alexander Avdoshkin, Liang Fu
Abstract: We show that a quadratic form of quantum geometric tensor in $k$-space sets a bound on the $q^4$ term in the static structure factor $S(q)$ at small $\vec{q}$. Bands that saturate this bound satisfy a condition similar to Laplace's equation, leading us to refer to them as $\textit{harmonic bands}$. We provide examples of harmonic bands in one- and two-dimensional systems, including (higher) Landau levels. The geometric bound further leads to a topological bound on the $q^4$ term, which is saturated only when the band geometry satisfies the trace condition and, additionally, the quantum geometric tensor is uniform in $k$-space. We speculate that these bounds taken together provide a useful guide for identifying Chern bands that favor (Abelian or non-Abelian) fractional Chern insulators.

Title: Refining the Two-Band Model for Highly Compensated Semimetals Using Thermoelectric Coefficients
Authors: Ian Leahy, Andrew Treglia, Gang Cao, Brian Skinner, Minhyea Lee
Abstract: In studying compensated semimetals, the two-band model has proven extremely useful in capturing electrical conductivity under magnetic field, as a function of density and mobility of electron-like and hole-like carriers. However, it rarely offers practical insight into magneto-thermoelectric properties. Here, we report the field dependence of thermoelectric (TE) coefficients in a highly compensated semimetal NbSb$_2$, where we find the Seebeck and Nernst coefficients increase quadratically and linearly with applied magnetic field, respectively. Such field dependence was predicted in previous work that studied a system of two parabolic bands, within semiclassical Boltzmann transport theory when the following two conditions are simultaneously met:$\omega_c\tau \gg 1$ and $\tan\theta_H \ll 1$. Under these conditions, we find the field dependence of the TE coefficients directly provides a relation between the electron-like ($n_e$) and hole-like ($n_h$) carrier densities, which in turn can be used to refine two-band model fitting. With this, we find the compensation factor ($\frac{|\Delta n|}{n_e}$) of NbSb$_2$ is two orders of magnitude smaller than what was found in unrestricted fitting, resulting in a larger saturation field scale for magnetoresistance. Within the same framework of the semiclassical theory, we also deduce that the thermoelectric Hall angle $\tan\theta_{\gamma} = \frac{S_{xy}}{S_{xx}}$ can be expressed as $\big(\frac{|\Delta n|}{n_e} \times \omega_c\tau\big)^{-1}$, which serves as a parameter to predict the degree of compensation. Our findings offer crucial insights into identifying empirical conditions for field-induced enhancement of TE performance and into engineering efficient thermoelectric devices based on semimetallic materials.

Title: Dephasing-induced jumps in non-Hermitian disordered lattices
Authors: Emmanouil T. Kokkinakis, Konstantinos G. Makris, Eleftherios N. Economou
Abstract: Changes in the wavefunction's phase during propagation in a random Hermitian lattice, a process known as dephasing, results in diffusion rather than Anderson localization. However, when non-Hermiticity is introduced, the wave behavior changes drastically. In particular, we demonstrate that in weakly disordered non-Hermitian lattices, dephasing enhances eigenmode localization which results in abrupt jumps between spatially distant regions. These jumps, which are absent under purely coherent conditions, emerge from the interplay between complex disorder and dephasing.

Title: Intrinsic thermal Hall effect of optical phonons enhanced by discrete rotational symmetry
Authors: Xuesong Hu, Junren Shi
Abstract: We investigate the intrinsic thermal Hall conductivity contributed by optical phonons in a cubic system. The discrete rotational symmetry of the system splits the degeneracy of transverse modes across most regions of wave-vector space, except along a few high-symmetry lines. Consequently, in the presence of an external magnetic field, phonon Berry curvatures become sharply peaked near these high-symmetry lines. We find that the singular distribution of the Berry curvature induces an intrinsic thermal Hall conductivity that is significantly enhanced compared to an isotropic system. It exhibits a nonlinear $B\ln B$ dependence on the magnetic field $B$ and a non-monotonic temperature dependence. At elevated temperatures, it reverses sign and approaches a non-vanishing value asymptotically. Our analysis indicates that the behavior results from competition between contributions from Berry curvatures near different high-symmetry lines.

Title: Soft symmetries of topological orders
Authors: Ryohei Kobayashi, Maissam Barkeshli
Abstract: (2+1)D topological orders possess emergent symmetries given by a group $\text{Aut}(\mathcal{C})$, which consists of the braided tensor autoequivalences of the modular tensor category $\mathcal{C}$ that describes the anyons. In this paper we discuss cases where $\text{Aut}(\mathcal{C})$ has elements that neither permute anyons nor are associated to any symmetry fractionalization but are still non-trivial, which we refer to as soft symmetries. We point out that one can construct topological defects corresponding to such exotic symmetry actions by decorating with a certain class of gauged SPT states that cannot be distinguished by their torus partition function. This gives a physical interpretation to work by Davydov on soft braided tensor autoequivalences. This has a number of important implications for the classification of gapped boundaries, non-invertible spontaneous symmetry breaking, and the general classification of symmetry-enriched topological phases of matter. We also demonstrate analogous phenomena in higher dimensions, such as (3+1)D gauge theory with gauge group given by the quaternion group $Q_8$.

Title: Optical absorption and luminescence of $α$-LiV$_2$O$_5$ from the Bethe Salpeter Equation
Authors: Claudio Garcia, Walter R. L. Lambrecht
Abstract: $\alpha$-Li$_x$V$_2$O$_5$ is obtained by intercalating Li between the layers of V$_2$O$_5$. The partial filling of the split-off conduction band by electron donation from Li leads to significant changes in optical properties. Here we study the electronic band structure of $\alpha$-LiV$_2$O$_5$ using quasiparticle self-consistent (QS) $GW$ calculations and the optical dielectric function by means of the Bethe Salpeter Equation (BSE). The half-filling of the narrow split-off band leads to a spin-splitting and formation of magnetic moments of 0.5 $\mu_B$ per V which order antiferromagnetically along the chain or $b$-direction. The imaginary part of the dielectric function shows a very strong optical absorption band near 2 eV for polarization along the $a$-direction. This absorptions stems from a localized transition between the occupied V-$d_{xy}$ derived band, which is odd with respect to the $a$-mirrorplane to the higher lying empty band formed from the same V-$d_{xy}$ orbitals but even with respect to that mirror-plane, which explains its polarization and large oscillator strength. We relate this to a recent experimental study of cathodoluminescence (CL) in which a suppression of the lowest CL peak was observed upon addition of Li. The lowest CL peak near 1.8 eV, which lies well below the indirect absorption onset of V$_2$O$_5$ is proposed to be related to recombination of a self-trapped electron polaron, resulting from oxygen vacancies, with a hole at the valence band maximum and is suppressed in LiV$_2$O$_5$ by the strong self--absorption from the Li induced occupied band to the higher empty bands at about the same energy.

Title: Microscopic structure and dynamics of shear-thinning suspensions of polydisperse, repulsive vesicles
Authors: Nikolaos Kolezakis, Stefano Aime, Raffaele Pastore, Vincenzo Guida, Gaetano D Avino, Paolo Edera
Abstract: We investigate the rheology, microscopic structure, and dynamics of an industrially relevant dispersion made of cationic surfactant vesicles, from dilute to concentrated conditions. We find that these suspensions exhibit a shear-thinning behavior at relatively low concentrations. At the microscale, this corresponds to a well-defined transition in both the structure, marked by the appearance of a peak in the static structure factor, and the dynamics, which slow down and develop a two-step decay in the correlation functions. This low-concentration transition is particularly surprising in light of experiments showing that for surfactant vesicles of similar composition the interactions should be purely repulsive. This leads us to propose that the observed structural and dynamic transition could arise, as an entropic effect, from the large sample polydispersity coupled to crowding. The shear-thinning behavior is thus interpreted as the nonlinear response of this transient structure to the imposed flow. Our work suggests that similar effects might be a generic feature of dense, highly polydisperse charged suspensions.

Title: Species interconversion of deformable particles yields transient phase separation
Authors: Yiwei Zhang, Alessandro Manacorda, Étienne Fodor
Abstract: We consider a dense assembly of repulsive particles whose fluctuating sizes are subject to an energetic landscape that defines three species: two distinct states of particles with a finite size, and point particles as an intermediate state between the two previous species. We show that the non-equilibrium synchronization of sizes systematically leads to a homogeneous configuration associated with the survival of a single species. Remarkably, the relaxation towards such a configuration features a transient phase separation. By delineating and analyzing the dominant kinetic factors at play during relaxation, we recapitulate the phase diagram of species survival in terms of the parameters of the size landscape. Finally, we obtain a hydrodynamic mapping to equilibrium by coarse-graining the microscopic dynamics, which leads to predicting the nature of the transitions between various regimes where distinct species survive.

Title: Weighted Point Configurations with Hyperuniformity: An Ecological Example and Models
Authors: Ayana Ezoe, Makoto Katori, Tomoyuki Shirai
Abstract: Random point configurations are said to be in hyperuniform states, if density fluctuations are anomalously suppressed in large-scale. Typical examples are found in Coulomb gas systems in two dimensions especially called log-gases in random matrix theory, in which points are repulsively correlated by long-range potentials. In infertile lands like deserts continuous survival competitions for water and nutrition will cause long-ranged repulsive interactions among plants. We have prepared digital data of spatial configurations of center-of-mass for bushes weighted by bush sizes which we call masses. Data analysis shows that such ecological point configurations do not show hyperuniformity as unmarked point processes, but are in hyperuniform states as marked point processes in which mass distributions are taken into account. We propose the non-equilibrium statistical-mechanics models to generate marked point processes having hyperuniformity, in which iterations of random thinning of points and coalescing of masses transform initial uncorrelated point processes into non-trivial point processes with hyperuniformity. Combination of real data-analysis and computer simulations shows the importance of strong correlations in probability law between spatial point configurations and mass distributions of individual points to realize hyperuniform marked point processes.

Title: Curvature-sensing and generation by membrane proteins: a review
Authors: Hiroshi Noguchi
Abstract: Membrane proteins are crucial in regulating biomembrane shapes and controlling the dynamic changes in membrane morphology during essential cellular processes. These proteins can localize to regions with their preferred curvatures (curvature sensing) and induce localized membrane curvature. Thus, this review describes the recent theoretical development in membrane remodeling performed by membrane proteins. The mean-field theories of protein binding and the resulting membrane deformations are reviewed. The effects of hydrophobic insertions on the area-difference elasticity energy and that of intrinsically disordered protein domains on the membrane bending energy are discussed. For the crescent-shaped proteins, such as Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs superfamily proteins, anisotropic protein bending energy and orientation-dependent excluded volume significantly contribute to curvature sensing and generation. Moreover, simulation studies of membrane deformations caused by protein binding are reviewed, including domain formation, budding, and tubulation.

Title: Direct derivation of anisotropic atomic displacement parameters from molecular dynamics simulations in extended solids with substitutional disorder using a neural network potential
Authors: Yoyo Hinuma
Abstract: Atomic displacement parameters (ADPs) are crystallographic information that describe the statistical distribution of atoms around an atom site. Anisotropic ADPs by atom were directly derived from classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using a universal machine-learned potential. The (co)valences of atom positions were taken over recordings at different time steps in a single MD simulation. The procedure was demonstrated on extended solids, namely rocksalt structure MgO and three thermoelectric materials, Ag8SnSe6, Na2In2Sn4, and BaCu1.14In0.86P2. Unlike the very frequently used lattice dynamics approach, the MD approach can obtain ADPs in crystals with substitutional disorder and explicitly at finite temperature, but not under conditions where atoms migrate in the crystal. The calculated ADP becomes ->0 at temperature ->0 and the ADP is proportional to the temperature when the atom is in a harmonic potential and the sole contribution to the actual non-zero ADP is from the zero-point motion. The zero-point motion contribution can be estimated from the proportionality constant assuming this Einstein model. ADPs from MD simulations would act as a tool complementing experimental efforts to understand the crystal structure including the distribution of atoms around atom sites.

Title: Chiral Instabilities in Driven-Dissipative Quantum Liquids
Authors: Zhi-Xing Lin, Bastien Lapierre, Per Moosavi, Shinsei Ryu
Abstract: We investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics of periodically driven Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids (TLLs) coupled to a thermal bath using a Floquet-Lindblad approach. When the coupling to the bath satisfies detailed balance, we obtain a condition for parametric instabilities to be suppressed, symmetrically for both chiralities. Remarkably, by designing a purely chiral coupling to the bath, instead of instability suppression, we uncover a driven-dissipative phase transition between the former symmetric parametric instability and a new chiral parametric instability. In the latter, a single chirality of bosonic quasiparticles gets exponentially amplified, leading to a dynamical chiral imbalance within the TLL, reminiscent of the non-Hermitian skin effect.

Title: Variationally optimizing infinite projected entangled-pair states at large bond dimensions: A split corner transfer matrix renormalization group approach
Authors: Jan Naumann, Erik Lennart Weerda, Jens Eisert, Matteo Rizzi, Philipp Schmoll
Abstract: Projected entangled-pair states (PEPS) have become a powerful tool for studying quantum many-body systems in the condensed matter and quantum materials context, particularly with advances in variational energy optimization methods. A key challenge within this framework is the computational cost associated with the contraction of the two-dimensional lattice, crucial for calculating state vector norms and expectation values. The conventional approach, using the corner transfer matrix renormalization group (CTMRG), involves combining two tensor network layers, resulting in significant time and memory demands. In this work, we introduce an alternative "split-CTMRG" algorithm, which maintains separate PEPS layers and leverages new environment tensors, reducing computational complexity while preserving accuracy. Benchmarks on quantum lattice models demonstrate substantial speedups for variational energy optimization, rendering this method valuable for large-scale PEPS simulations.

Abstract: TaRhTe$_4$ is a type-IIWeyl semimetal, exhibiting fourWeyl points in proximity to the Fermi level. In this article, we report our results of a systematic study of longitudinal magnetoresistance in TaRhTe$_4$. Our findings indicate that magnetoresistance becomes negative only when the magnetic field is applied parallel to the electric field. By rotating E (as well as B), we show that its origin is consistent with the prediction of the chiral anomaly, while the current jetting effect and weak localization could be excluded. The negative magnetoresistance persists up to room temperature, suggesting that TaRhTe4 exhibits distinctive properties within the family of Weyl semimetals.

Title: Enforced Gaplessness from States with Exponentially Decaying Correlations
Authors: Rahul Sahay, Curt von Keyserlingk, Ruben Verresen, Carolyn Zhang
Abstract: It is well known that an exponentially localized Hamiltonian must be gapless if its ground state has algebraic correlations. We show that even certain exponentially decaying correlations can imply gaplessness. This is exemplified by the deformed toric code $\propto \exp(\beta \sum_{\ell} Z_{\ell}) |\mathsf{TC}\rangle$, where $|\mathsf{TC}\rangle$ is a fixed-point toric code wavefunction. Although it has a confined regime for $\beta > \beta_c$, recent work has drawn attention to its perimeter law loop correlations. Here, we show that these unusual loop correlations -- namely, perimeter law coexisting with a 1-form symmetry whose disorder operator has long-range order -- imply that any local parent Hamiltonian must either be gapless or have a degeneracy scaling with system size. Moreover, we construct a variational low-energy state for arbitrary local frustration-free Hamiltonians, upper bounding the finite-size gap by $O(1/L^3)$ on periodic boundary conditions. Strikingly, these variational states look like loop waves -- non-quasiparticle analogs of spin waves -- generated from the ground state by non-local loop operators. Our findings have implications for identifying the subset of Hilbert space to which gapped ground states belong, and the techniques have wide applicability. For instance, a corollary of our first result is that Glauber dynamics for the ordered phase of the two-dimensional classical Ising model on the torus must have a gapless Markov transition matrix, with our second result bounding its gap.

Title: Probing the Design Space of InSb Topological Superconductor Nanowires for the Realization of Majorana Zero Modes
Authors: Mirko Poljak
Abstract: Non-Abelian anyons such as Majorana zero modes (MZMs) have the potential to enable fault-tolerant quantum computing through topological protection. Experimentally reported InSb topological superconductor nanowires (TSNW) are investigated theoretically and numerically to evaluate their suitability to host MZMs. We employ eigenspectra analysis and quantum transport based on the non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) formalism to investigate the eigenenergies, Majorana wave functions via local density of states, transmission spectra for Andreev processes, and zero-bias conductance peaks (ZBCPs) in InSb TSNWs. For 1.6 {\mu}m- and 2.2 {\mu}m-long InSb TSNWs we demonstrate the existence of the optimum design space defined by the applied magnetic field and electrochemical potential, which leads to clear ZBCP signatures with a Majorana localization length down to ~340 nm.

Title: Spontaneous Optimal Mixing via Defect-Vortex Coupling in Confined Active Nematics
Authors: Brandon Klein, Alejandro J. Soto Franco, Md Mainul Hasan Sabbir, Matthew J. Deutsch, Ross Kliegman, Robin L. B. Selinger, Kevin A. Mitchell, Daniel A. Beller
Abstract: Active nematic flows in two dimensions, largely driven by motile $+1/2$ disclinations, mix themselves efficiently and exhibit chaos in the bulk steady state. Motivated by recent experimental findings for three-defect braiding in cardioid-shaped domains, we investigate how this tendency toward chaotic fluid mixing can, counterintuitively, produce certain ordered, periodic flows in confinement with a controllable net topological charge. We study two-dimensional active nematics in systems with boundary conditions requiring a prescribed number of excess $+1/2$ disclinations, using Beris-Edwards nematohydrodynamics simulations, alongside an agent-based, hydrodynamic simulation approach. We find ordered flows for systems of three and four defects, and we use tools from braid theory to show that spontaneously occurring periodic defect motions produce maximal topological entropy. Our theory correctly predicts the generic absence of stable periodic orbits of more than four defects in strong confinement in simulation. Our results identify the parameter regime outside of which periodicity is lost, and allow us to probe the limits of topological entropy production.

Title: Diverse Magnetic Phase Diagram and Anomalous Hall Effect in Antiferromagetic LuMn$_6$Sn$_6$
Authors: Shirin Mozaffari, Seung-Hwan Do, Richa P. Madhogaria, Aikaterini Flessa Savvidou, Brian W. Casas, William R. Meier, Rui Xue, Eun Sang Choi, Luis Balicas, David G. Mandrus
Abstract: The interactions between conduction electrons and magnetism can significantly enhance the Hall signal, a phenomenon known as the anomalous Hall effect (AHE). While the AHE is generally not expected in antiferromagnets, a large AHE is observed in certain antiferromagnets with noncollinear spin textures and nonvanishing Berry curvature. In this work, we present a rich temperature and magnetic phase diagram with eight distinct magnetic phases for the antiferromagnetic kagome compound LuMn$_6$Sn$_6$. The Hall effect analysis in LuMn$_6$Sn$_6$ reveals both intriguing physical phenomena and methodological challenges. In the coplanar canted antiferromagnetic phase, we observe an AHE, which likely originates from the intrinsic effects. At low temperatures, upon entering the ferromagnetic phase, the AHE sharply increases and exceeds the conventional limits expected from intrinsic mechanisms. We also demonstrate the limitations of standard experimental methods in extracting the topological contribution to the Hall effect data. We show the importance of considering magnetoresistance anisotropy when estimating the anomalous and topological Hall effects. These shortcomings in current approaches in partitioning the Hall response necessitate new tools to interpret transport results in complex magnetic materials such as LuMn$_6$Sn$_6$.

Abstract: Diamond lattice magnets, formed by a framework of corner-sharing tetrahedra of magnetic cations, offer unique opportunities to realize novel states of matter for potential utility in information technology. However, research has mostly focused on AB2X4 spinels with Td magnetic ions. This hinders the atomically enabled tunability of competing interactions at different energy scales and the ability to harness many-body electronic states in quantum materials, making the discovery of quantum fluctuations and spin dynamics less accessible. We discover a new material CaCo2TeO6 featuring a diamond lattice of two distinct Oh-Co2+ sites. This material displays strong quantum fluctuations, increased competing magnetic exchange interactions, and field-induced tunability of magnetic structures. The results demonstrate how simple, fundamental refinements in ligand fields can profoundly influence the phase space of quantum matter.

Abstract: Over the past two decades, 2D materials have rapidly evolved into a diverse and expanding family of material platforms. Many members of this materials class have demonstrated their potential to deliver transformative impact on fundamental research and technological applications across different fields. In this roadmap, we provide an overview of the key aspects of 2D material research and development, spanning synthesis, properties and commercial applications. We specifically present roadmaps for high impact 2D materials, including graphene and its derivatives, transition metal dichalcogenides, MXenes as well as their heterostructures and moiré systems. The discussions are organized into thematic sections covering emerging research areas (e.g., twisted electronics, moiré nano-optoelectronics, polaritronics, quantum photonics, and neuromorphic computing), breakthrough applications in key technologies (e.g., 2D transistors, energy storage, electrocatalysis, filtration and separation, thermal management, flexible electronics, sensing, electromagnetic interference shielding, and composites) and other important topics (computational discovery of novel materials, commercialization and standardization). This roadmap focuses on the current research landscape, future challenges and scientific and technological advances required to address, with the intent to provide useful references for promoting the development of 2D materials.

Title: Quench dynamics via recursion method and dynamical quantum phase transitions
Authors: Ilya Shirokov, Viacheslav Khrushchev, Filipp Uskov, Ivan Dudinets, Igor Ermakov, Oleg Lychkovskiy
Abstract: The recursion method provides a powerful framework for studying quantum many-body dynamics in the Lanczos basis recursively constructed within the Krylov space of operators. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the recursion method, when supplemented by the universal operator growth hypothesis, can effectively compute autocorrelation functions and transport coefficients at infinite temperature. We extend the scope of the recursion method to far-from-equilibrium quench dynamics. We apply the method to spin systems in one, two, and three spatial dimensions. In one dimension we find an evidence that the convergence of the method is limited in time by the dynamical quantum phase transition.

Title: Quantum-stabilized states in magnetic dipolar quantum gases
Authors: Lauriane Chomaz
Abstract: A decade ago, a universal stabilization mechanism driven by quantum fluctuations was discovered in ultracold Bose gases of highly magnetic atoms. This mechanism prevents these systems from collapsing and instead allows exotic states of matter to arise, including ultradilute quantum droplets, crystallized quantum states, and specifically supersolids. We review the experimental and theoretical progress in understanding these quantum-stabilized states, their emergence, and intriguing properties.

Title: A statistical understanding of oxygen vacancies in distorted high-entropy oxides
Authors: Adam Potter, Yifan Wang, Dongjae Kong, Yuzhe Li, Jian Qin, Xiaolin Zheng
Abstract: High entropy perovskite oxides (HEPOs) have emerged as a promising family of stable electrode materials for high-temperature water splitting. The concentration of oxygen vacancies in HEPOs significantly influences critical properties, such as the ionic conductivity and thermal expansion coefficient. However, predicting oxygen vacancy concentrations for the design of HEPOs with high-entropic A-sites remains challenging due to the complex arrangements of metal cations. Our experimental findings reveal that variations in A-site cation size constitute a crucial factor in affecting the oxygen vacancy concentration. High-throughput atomistic simulations using a machine-learned universal interatomic potential reveal that the lattice distortions from A-site size variations result in a broadened distribution of oxygen vacancy formation energies. Our theoretical analysis, grounded in statistical thermodynamics, provides formulations for the enthalpy and entropy of oxygen vacancy formation as functions of variance in oxygen bonding energy. Altogether, our results show mixing metal cations of varying sizes in the A-site creates statistical effects on the oxygen vacancy thermodynamics, resulting in a unique approach to tuning their concentrations for complex perovskite oxides.

Abstract: The combination of non-trivial topology and superconductivity opens to novel quantum devices. The discovery of intrinsic materials where such properties appear together represents a frontier in modern condensed matter physics. Trigonal PtBi$_2$ has recently emerged as a possible candidate, being the first example of superconducting type-I Weyl semimetal. However, several aspects of this promising compound still need to be unveiled, concerning its complicated band structure, the actual role of Weyl points in determining its electronic properties and the nature of the superconducting transition. In this work, we experimentally investigated a t-PtBi$_2$ single crystal by means of the Hall and Nernst effects. In particular, we revealed a change of regime in its electronic properties, which is compatible with a temperature and magnetic field evolution of hole-like pockets in the Fermi Surface.

Title: Topological phases of coupled Su-Schrieffer-Heeger wires
Authors: Anas Abdelwahab
Abstract: The phase diagrams of arbitrary number $N_{\text{w}}$ of diagonally and perpendicularly coupled Su-Schrieffer-Heeger wires have been identified. The diagonally coupled wires have rich topological phase diagrams exhibiting insulating phases with winding numbers $0\leq w \leq N_{\text{w}}$ and topological critical lines restricted by the reflection mirror symmetry. Even number of perpendicularly coupled wires exhibit either gapless or trivial topological phases. Odd number of perpendicularly coupled wires additionally exhibit nontrivial topological phases with winding number $w=1$. Due to the mirror reflection symmetry, their gapless regions can be topologically nontrivial. Odd number of perpendicularly coupled wires reveal coherent confined correlations in the odd indexed wires away from the gapless regions.

Title: Line defect correlators in fermionic CFTs
Authors: Julien Barrat, Pedro Liendo, Philine van Vliet
Abstract: Scalar-fermion models, such as the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa model, admit natural $1d$ defects given by the exponential of a scalar field integrated along a straight line. In $4-\varepsilon$ dimensions the defect coupling is weakly relevant and the setup defines a non-trivial interacting defect CFT. In this work we study correlation functions on these defect CFTs to order $\varepsilon$. We focus on $1d$ correlators constrained to the line, which include canonical operators like the displacement and the one-dimensional analog of the spin field. These results give access to perturbative CFT data that can be used as input in the numerical bootstrap. We also consider local operators outside the line, in particular two-point functions of scalars whose dynamics are non-trivial due to the presence of the defect.

Title: Metastability and time scales for parabolic equations with drift 2: the general time scale
Authors: Claudio Landim, Jungkyoung Lee, Insuk Seo
Abstract: Consider the elliptic operator given by \[ \mathscr{L}_\epsilon f=b\cdot\nabla f+\epsilon\Delta f \] for some smooth vector field $b:\mathbb{R}^d\to\mathbb{R}^d$ and $\epsilon>0$, and the initial-valued problem on $\mathbb{R}^d$ \[ \left\{\begin{aligned}&\partial_t u_\epsilon=\mathscr{L}_\epsilon u_\epsilon,\\ &u_\epsilon(0,\,\cdot)=u_0(\cdot), \end{aligned} \right. \] for some bounded continuous function $u_0$. Under the hypothesis that the diffusion on $\mathbb{R}^d$ induced by $\mathscr{L}_\epsilon$ has a Gibbs invariant measure of the form $\exp \{-U(x)/\epsilon\}dx$ for some smooth Morse potential function $U$, we provide the complete characterization of the multi-scale behavior of the solution $u_\epsilon$ in the regime $\epsilon\to0$. More precisely, we find the critical time scales $1\ll \theta_\epsilon^{(1)}\ll\cdots\ll \theta_\epsilon^{(q)}$ as $\epsilon\to0$, and the kernels $R_t^{(p)}:M_0\times M_0\to\mathbb{R}_+$, where $M_0$ denotes the set of local minima of $U$, such that \[ \lim_{\epsilon\to0}u_\epsilon(t\theta_\epsilon^{(p)},\,x)=\sum_{m'\in M_0}R_t^{(p)}(m,\,m')u_0(m'), \] for all $t>0$ and $x$ in the domain of attraction of $m$ for the dynamical system $\dot{x}(t)=b(x(t))$. We then complete the characterization of the solution $u_\epsilon$ by computing the exact asymptotic limit of the solution between time scales $\theta_\epsilon^{(p)}$ and $\theta_\epsilon^{(p+1)}$ for each $p$, where $\theta_\epsilon^{(0)}=1$ and $\theta_\epsilon^{(q+1)}=\infty$. Our analysis makes essential use of the hierarchical tree structure underlying the metastable behavior in different time-scales of the diffusion induced by $\mathscr{L}_\epsilon$. This result can be regarded as the precise refinement of Freidlin-Wentzell theory which was not known for more than a half century.

Title: Probing anyonic statistics via Mach-Zehnder interferometry in quantum computers
Authors: Shiyu Zhou, Yi Teng, Claudio Chamon, Claudio Castelnovo, Armin Rahmani
Abstract: We introduce a synthetic Mach-Zehnder interferometer for digitized quantum computing devices to probe fractional exchange statistics of anyonic excitations that appear in quantum spin liquids. Employing an IonQ quantum computer, we apply this scheme to the toric ladder, a quasi-one-dimensional reduction of the toric code. We observe interference patterns resulting from the movement of `electric' excitations in the presence and absence of `magnetic' ones. We model the noise in IonQ via depolarizing Lindbladian dynamics, and find quantitative agreement with the measurements obtained from the quantum device. The synthetic Mach-Zehnder interferometer can thus also serve as an effective means to probe the coherence length and time scales of multi-qubit noisy quantum devices.

Title: Purcell-enhanced single-photon emission from InAs/GaAs quantum dots coupled to broadband cylindrical nanocavities

Abstract: On-chip emitters that can generate single and entangled photons are essential building blocks for developing photonic quantum information processing technologies in a scalable fashion. Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are attractive candidates that emit high-quality quantum states of light on demand, however at a rate limited by their spontaneous radiative lifetime. In this study, we utilize the Purcell effect to demonstrate up to a 38-fold enhancement in the emission rate of InAs QDs by coupling them to metal-clad GaAs nanopillars. These cavities, featuring a sub-wavelength mode volume of 4.5x10-4 ({\lambda}/n)3 and low quality factor of 62, enable Purcell-enhanced single-photon emission across a large bandwidth of 15 nm. The broadband nature of the cavity eliminates the need for implementing tuning mechanisms typically required to achieve QD-cavity resonance, thus relaxing fabrication constraints. Ultimately, this QD-cavity architecture represents a significant stride towards developing solid-state quantum emitters generating near-ideal single-photon states at GHz-level repetition rates.

Title: Magneto-optical properties of Group-IV--vacancy centers in diamond upon hydrostatic pressure
Authors: Meysam Mohseni, Lukas Razinkovas, Vytautas Žalandauskas, Gergő Thiering, Adam Gali
Abstract: In recent years, the negatively charged group-IV--vacancy defects in diamond, labeled as G4V(-) or G4V centers, have attracted significant attention in quantum information processing. In this study, we investigate the magneto-optical properties of G4V centers under high compressive hydrostatic pressures up to 180 GPa. The spin-orbit splitting of the electronic ground and excited states, as well as the hyperfine tensors, are calculated using plane-wave supercell density functional theory, providing distinctive fingerprints that uniquely characterize these defects. To this end, we develop a theory for calculating the hyperfine tensors when the electronic states are subject to the Jahn--Teller effect. We find that the zero-phonon-line energy increases with hydrostatic pressure, with the deformation potential increasing from SiV(-) to PbV(-). On the other hand, our calculated photoionization threshold energies indicate that PbV(-)-based quantum sensors can operate only up to 32 GPa, whereas SnV(-), GeV(-), and SiV(-) remain photostable up to 180 GPa. We also find that the spin-orbit splitting increases in both the electronic ground and excited states with increasing pressure. The optical transitions associated with the hyperfine fine structure of the dopant atoms are interpreted using our theoretical framework, which reproduces existing experimental data at zero strain. We show that the hyperfine levels are weakly dependent on magnetic field, and increasing pressure leads to optical transitions at longer wavelengths. Finally, we estimate the spin coherence times of the G4V centers under increasing hydrostatic pressure across different temperature regimes.

Title: Charged critical behavior and nonperturbative continuum limit of three-dimensional lattice SU($N_c$) gauge Higgs models
Authors: Claudio Bonati, Andrea Pelissetto, Ivan Soler Calero, Ettore Vicari
Abstract: We consider the three-dimensional (3D) lattice SU($N_c$) gauge Higgs theories with multicomponent ($N_f>1$) degenerate scalar fields and U($N_f$) global symmetry, focusing on systems with $N_c=2$, to identify critical behaviors that can be effectively described by the corresponding 3D SU($N_c$) gauge Higgs field theory. The field-theoretical analysis of the RG flow allows one to identify a stable charged fixed point for large values of $N_f$, that would control transitions characterized by the global symmetry-breaking pattern ${\rm U}(N_f)\rightarrow \mathrm{SU}(2)\otimes \mathrm{U}(N_f-2)$. Continuous transitions with the same symmetry-breaking pattern are observed in the SU(2) lattice gauge model for $N_f \ge 30$. Here we present a detailed finite-size scaling analysis of the Monte Carlo data for several large values of $N_f$. The results are in substantial agreement with the field-theoretical predictions obtained in the large-$N_f$ limit. This provides evidence that the SU($N_c$) gauge Higgs field theories provide the correct effective description of the 3D large-$N_f$ continuous transitions between the disordered and the Higgs phase, where the flavor symmetry breaks to $\mathrm{SU}(2)\otimes \mathrm{U}(N_f-2)$. Therefore, at least for large enough $N_f$, the 3D SU($N_c$) gauge Higgs field theories with multicomponent scalar fields can be nonperturbatively defined by the continuum limit of lattice discretizatized models with the same local and global symmetries.

Title: On Acceleration of Highest-Energy Cosmic Rays in a Novel Scenario of Magnetar Transients
Authors: Jiro Shimoda, Tomoki Wada
Abstract: Transient phenomena in magnetars have been considered as possible acceleration sites of ultrahigh-energy cosmic-rays (CRs), whose energy reaches ~200 EeV, such as the Amaterasu particle. However, the process of CR acceleration and the trigger mechanism of magnetar transients remains unclear. A recently suggested scenario for the activity predicts that the magnetar's rotation axis suddenly flips due to the `Dzhanibekov effect,' resulting in a sudden rise of the Euler force. The material in the outer layer plastically flows due to the force and finally fractures in this scenario. We study the possibilities of ion acceleration along with this scenario. If the degenerate electrons burst open from the fractured region like a balloon burst, the pair plasma formation can be ignited inside the crust. We find that such pair plasma can emit photons similar to the observed bursts from magnetars. We also find that the electron stream at the beginning of the burst phenomenon possibly induces a strong electric field for a moment, resulting in the acceleration of ~1 ZeV ion within a timescale of ~1 ps. The nuclear spallation reactions limit this timescale, and therefore, high-energy CR `neutrons' from the parenteral nuclei become proper observational predictions of this scenario: their arrival time and direction will be correlated with the bursting photon emissions of the host magnetars. The nuclear spallation of ~ZeV nuclei is preferred to explain $\gtrsim$10 PeV neutrino events observed by IceCube and KM3Net.

Title: Three-point functions from a Schwinger-Keldysh effective action, resummed in derivatives
Authors: Navid Abbasi, Dirk H. Rischke
Abstract: The search for the conjectured QCD critical point in heavy-ion collisions requires to account for far-from equilibrium effects as well as fluctuations, and in particular non-Gaussian fluctuations, in the modeling of the dynamics of the hot and dense matter created in such collisions. In order to study far-from equilibrium effects as well as fluctuations, in this work we construct a Schwinger-Keldysh effective field theory (EFT) for the diffusion of the density to all orders in derivatives. The dissipation in the free part of our EFT follows the Boltzmann equation in the relaxation-time approximation (RTA). The interaction part of the EFT is constructed based on the self-interaction of the density field. We analytically find the quadratic and cubic parts of the KMS-invariant EFT in closed form, resummed in derivatives. We then explicitly compute the symmetrized three-point function at tree level, and investigate its analytical structure in detail. We also analytically calculate the branch-point singularity that appears in the structure of the two-point response function due to loop effects. Our results are important for future studies of the real-time dynamics of the correlation functions and the possible relation to thermalization when the system is far from equilibrium.

Title: Universal quantum computation using Ising anyons from a non-semisimple Topological Quantum Field Theory
Authors: Filippo Iulianelli, Sung Kim, Joshua Sussan, Aaron D. Lauda
Abstract: We propose a framework for topological quantum computation using newly discovered non-semisimple analogs of topological quantum field theories in 2+1 dimensions. These enhanced theories offer more powerful models for quantum computation. The conventional theory of Ising anyons, which is believed to describe excitations in the $\nu = 5/2$ fractional quantum Hall state, is not universal for quantum computation via braiding of quasiparticles. However, we show that the non-semisimple theory introduces new anyon types that extend the Ising framework. By adding just one new anyon type, universal quantum computation can be achieved through braiding alone. This result opens new avenues for realizing fault-tolerant quantum computing in topologically ordered systems.

Title: Hydrodynamics of fault gouges from constitutive modelling to the physics of friction
Authors: Filippo Masi, Itai Einav
Abstract: The development of rate- and state-dependent friction laws offered important insights into the key physical mechanisms of the frictional behaviour of fault gouges and their seismic cycle. However, past approaches were specifically tailored to address the problem of fault shearing, leaving questions about their ability to comprehensively represent the gouge material under general loading conditions. This work establishes an alternative approach for developing a physical friction law for fault gouges that is grounded on the rigour of the hydrodynamic procedure with two-scale temperatures through Terracotta, a thoroughly robust constitutive model for clay in triaxial loading conditions. By specifying the model for direct shearing, the approach yields an alternative friction law that readily captures the frictional dynamics of fault gouges, including explicit dependencies on gouge layer thickness, normal stress, and solid fraction. Validated against available laboratory experiments, the friction law retains the original predictive capabilities of Terracotta in triaxial conditions and explains the rate- and state-dependent, dilatational behaviour of fault gouges in direct shear conditions. Finally, when the Terracotta friction law is connected to a spring-dashpot representation of the host rock, the combined model predicts an elastic buildup precursor to the onset of and subsequent seismicity, with results closely reflecting experimental evidence and field observations. While this study focuses on clay-rich gouges, the approach and findings are expected to offer much wider implications to a variety of materials.

Title: Uncovering the Maximum Chirality in Dielectric Nanostructures
Authors: WenKui Zhao, ShengYi Wang, HanZhuo Kuang, Hao Luo, Qiu Wang, Bo-Wen Jia
Abstract: Maximum structural chirality refers to the highest selectivity for circularly polarized light (CPL) in nanostructures, often manifested as maximum circular dichroism (CD), optical rotation (OR), and spin-orbit coupling (SOC). However, the underlying physical mechanisms that lead to maximum chirality remain unclear. In this work, we demonstrate that maximum chirality in dielectric nanostructures arises from the constructive and destructive interference of multipole moments with different CPL. By employing generalized multipole decomposition, we introduce a generalized chiral multipole mechanism that allows for direct numerical calculation of CD and establishes the conditions required to achieve maximum chirality. This approach provides a comprehensive framework for analyzing chirality and serves as a foundation for future investigations of chiral nanostructures.

Title: Symmetries of Weyl Superconductors with Different Pairings
Authors: Mehran Z. Abyaneh, Mehrdad Farhoudi, Mahdi Mashkoori
Abstract: We examine the Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian and its symmetries for a time-reversal symmetry broken three dimensional Weyl superconductor. In the limit of vanishing pairing potential, we specify that this Hamiltonian is invariant under two sets of continues symmetries, i.e. the $U(1)$ gauge symmetry and the $U(1)_A$ axial symmetry. Although a pairing of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer type spontaneously breaks both of these symmetries, we show that a Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov type pairing spontaneously breaks only the $U(1)$ gauge symmetry (that is then restored via the well-known scalar phase mode of superconductivity). Consequently, in the former case, two Nambu-Goldstone modes are required in the system to restore the broken symmetries. We indicate that one of these two modes is an emergent pseudo-scalar phase mode. We also demonstrate that such a phase mode leads to a pseudo-Meissner effect.

Title: Fragile topology on solid grounds: a mathematical perspective
Authors: Simon Becker, Zhongkai Tao, Mengxuan Yang
Abstract: This paper provides a mathematical perspective on fragile topology phenomena in condensed matter physics. In dimension $d \leq 3$, vanishing Chern classes of bundles of Bloch eigenfunctions characterize operators with exponentially localized Wannier functions (these functions form convenient bases of spectrally determined subspaces of $L^2$). However, for systems with additional symmetries, such as the $C_{2}T$ (space-time reversal) or the $PT$ (parity-time) symmetry, a set of exponentially localized Wannier functions compatible with such symmetry may not exist. We show that for rank 2 Bloch bundles with such symmetry, non-trivial Euler classes are obstructions to constructing exponentially localized compatible Wannier functions. We also show that this obstruction can be lifted by adding additional Bloch bundles with the symmetry, even though the Stiefel--Whitney class of the total bundle is non-trivial. This allows a construction of exponentially localized Wannier functions compatible with the symmetry and that is referred to as topological fragility.

Title: Co-Designing Eigen- and Singular-value Transformation Oracles: From Algorithmic Applications to Hardware Compilation
Authors: Luke Bell, Yan Wang, Kevin C. Smith, Yuan Liu, Eugene Dumitrescu, S. M. Girvin
Abstract: We co-design a family of quantum eigenvalue transformation oracles that can be efficiently implemented on hybrid discrete/continuous-variable (qubit/qumode) hardware. To showcase the oracle's representation-theoretic power, and near-term experimental accessibility, we encode a Gaussian imaginary time evolution spectral filter. In doing so, we define a continuous linear combination of unitaries block-encoding. Due to the ancilla qumode's infinite-dimensional nature, continuous variable qumodes constitute a powerful compilation tool for encoding continuous spectral functions without discretization errors while minimizing resource requirements. We then focus on the ubiquitous task of eigenstate preparation in quantum spin models. For completeness, we provide an end-to-end compilation -- applicable in both near-term and large-scale quantum processors -- expressing high-level oracles in terms of an experimentally realizable instruction set architecture. Our algorithms scale linearly with the spatial extent of the target system, and we provide details for 1D and 2D examples. Finally, we examine the leading-order effects of physical errors and highlight open research directions.

Title: Thermodynamic speed limit for non-adiabatic work and its classical-quantum decomposition
Authors: Aoi Yamauchi, Rihito Nagase, Kaixin Li, Takahiro Sagawa, Ken Funo
Abstract: Understanding the fundamental constraint on work far beyond the adiabatic regime is crucial to investigating fast and efficient energy extraction or consumption processes. In this study, we derive thermodynamic speed limits for non-adiabatic work and quantify the fundamental costs of non-adiabatic work extraction or consumption processes in open quantum systems, where the costs are quantified by geometric and thermodynamic quantities. We further decompose the non-adiabatic work into classical and quantum contributions and derive their thermodynamic speed limits, clarifying the classical and quantum nature of the fundamental costs. The obtained results are numerically demonstrated by driven two-level systems.

Title: Glued tree lattices with only compact localized states
Authors: Andrew Osborne, Ciro Salcedo, Andrew A. Houck
Abstract: Flat band physics is a central theme in modern condensed matter physics. By constructing a tight--binding single particle system that has vanishing momentum dispersion in one or more bands, and subsequently including more particles and interactions, it is possible to study physics in strongly interacting regimes. Inspired by the glued trees that first arose in one of the few known examples of quantum supremacy, we define and analyze two infinite families of tight binding single particle Bose--Hubbard models that have only flat bands, and only compact localized states despite having any nonnegative number of translation symmetries. The first class of model that we introduce is constructed by replacing a sufficiently large fraction of the edges in a generic countable graph with glued trees modified to have complex hoppings. The second class arises from thinking of complex weighted glued trees as rhombi that can then be used to tile two dimensional space, giving rise to the familiar dice lattice and infinitely many generalizations thereof, of which some are Euclidian while others are hyperbolic.

Title: Collective Superradiance: Estimating the Peak Emission Rate and Time
Authors: Raphael Holzinger, Susanne F. Yelin
Abstract: Determining the peak photon emission time and rate for an ensemble of $N$ quantum systems undergoing collective superradiant decay typically requires tracking the time evolution of the density operator, a process with computational costs scaling exponentially with $N$. We present compact, analytic formulas for evaluating the peak emission rate and time for initially fully excited quantum emitter ensembles, valid for any geometric configuration and emitter type. These formulas rely solely on the variance of the eigenvalues of a real symmetric $N \times N$ matrix, which describes collective dissipation. We demonstrate the versatility of these results across various environments, including free space, solid-state, and waveguide reservoirs. For large $N$ the formulas simplify further to depend on just two parameters: average nearest-neighbor spacing and emitter number. Finally, we present scaling laws and bounds on the spatial size of emitter ensembles, such that superradiance is maintained, independent of emitter number or density.

Title: Work Statistics and Quantum Trajectories: No-Click Limit and non-Hermitian Hamiltonians
Authors: Manali Malakar, Alessandro Silva
Abstract: We present a generalized framework for quantum work statistics in continuously monitored quantum systems that extends the conventional two-point measurement scheme to include the effects of multiple generalized measurements and post-selection of no-click trajectories. By deriving a modified generating function for work, our approach naturally incorporates non-Hermitian dynamics arising from quantum jump processes and reveals deviations from the standard Jarzynski equality due to measurement-induced asymmetries. We illustrate our theoretical framework by analyzing a one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model under local spin monitoring. In this model, increased measurement strength projects the system onto the no-click state, leading to a suppression of energy fluctuations and measurement-induced energy saturation, reminiscent of the quantum Zeno effect.

Title: Quantum Geometry of Finite XY Chains: A Comparison of Neveu-Schwarz and Ramond Sectors
Authors: Nayereh Einali, Hosein Mohammadzadeh, Vadood Adami, Morteza Nattagh Najafi
Abstract: This paper presents a geometrical analysis of finite length XY quantum chains. We begin by examining the ground state and the first excited state of the model, emphasizing the impact of finite size effects under two distinct choices of the Jordan Wigner transformation: the Neveu Schwartz (NS) and Ramond (R) sectors. We explore the geometric features of the system by analyzing the quantum (Berry) curvature derived from the Fubini Study metric, which is intimately connected to the quantum Fisher information. This approach uncovers a rich interplay between boundary conditions and quantum geometry. In the gamma h parameter space, we identify distinct sign changing arcs of the curvature, confined to some region. These arcs mark transitions between the NS and R sectors, indicating fundamental changes in the structure of the fermionic ground state. Remarkably, the number of such transition lines increases with system size, hinting at an emergent continuum of topological boundary effects in the thermodynamic limit. Our findings highlight a novel mechanism where boundary conditions shape quantum geometric properties, offering new insights into finite size topology and the structure of low dimensional quantum systems.

Title: Quantum Simulation of the Unruh Temperature via the Thermal Properties of Virtually Evolving Bose-Einstein Condensates
Authors: Imad-Eddine Chorfi, Nacer Eddine Belaloui, Abdellah Tounsi, Achour Benslama, Mohamed Taha Rouabah
Abstract: This paper presents a novel theoretical model to simulate the Unruh temperature by relating it to the critical temperature of multiple Bose-Einstein thermal baths. These thermal baths are conceptualized as snapshots of a Bose-Firework originating from an evolving driven Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). The critical temperature of each snapshot is determined from the heat capacity, which is numerically estimated by calculating the partition function derived from the system's Hamiltonian. By analyzing the relationship between the average number of the phononic excitations at the critical temperature, acceleration, and the critical temperature itself, our model demonstrates a significant agreement with the Unruh temperature formula, thereby validating our hypothesis. This theoretical approach offers a cost-effective and time-efficient alternative to resource-intensive experimental simulations. Furthermore, it provides a unique perspective on quantum simulation by utilizing the critical phenomena of condensed matter systems to probe fundamental quantum relativistic effects.

Title: Bubble-assisted micromixing via thermally excited intrinsic air within microfluidic systems
Authors: Seyed Shahriar Riazi, Seyed Mostafa Hosseinalipour
Abstract: The micromixing process in microfluidic devices is of central importance in quite a few applications, with microfluidic studies on carbon capture and environmental monitoring being two examples. High surface area to volume ratio in microscale flows outweighs the role of interfacial tension manipulation by means of introducing a secondary phase to the main flow in order to augment the typically diffusion-dominant mass transfer operation. In this paper, we introduce an easily integrable continuous flow micromixing scheme implemented on a simple Y-type microchannel based on thermally excited intrinsic air within microchannel. Thanks to the direct contact between the sputtered thin platinum microheater and the co-flowing streams, trapped air in the liquid and/or tiny crevices is employed to generate elongated bubbles with a millisecond lifespan, consuming less than 0.4 W of power and thereby enabling homogeneous mixing. The performance of the micromixer is characterized in terms of the mixing index (MI), and it is shown that immediately ahead of the microheater, the MI exceeds 95% for side-by-side flowing of water at different overall flowrates, namely 4, 10, and 20 uL/min. Interpreting the experimental results, supplemented by scaling arguments, we quantitatively describe the ephemeral role of emerging elongated bubbles in the micromixing process in which the Marangoni as well as Weber numbers are recognized as the characteristic local non-dimensional groups while the enhancing role of tiny daughter microbubbles on the micromixing downstream of the microchannel can be reflected in the Peclet and the Capillary numbers.

Title: Three-local Charge Conservation Implies Quantum Integrability
Authors: Zhao Zhang
Abstract: It is shown that the existence of a local conserved charge supported by three neighboring sites, or its local version, Reshetikhin's condition, suffices to guarantee the existence of all higher conserved charges and hence the integrability of a quantum spin chain. This explains the 'coincidence' that no counterexample is known to Grabowski and Mathieu's long-standing conjecture despite the folklore that the conservation of local charges of order higher than 4 imposes additional constraints not implied by the conservation of the three-local charge.

Abstract: In order to establish the thermodynamic stability of a system, knowledge of its Gibbs free energy is essential. Most often, the Gibbs free energy is predicted within the CALPHAD framework using models employing thermodynamic properties, such as the mixing enthalpy, heat capacity, and activity coefficients. Here, we present a deep-learning approach capable of predicting the mixing enthalpy of liquid phases of binary systems that were not present in the training dataset. Therefore, our model allows for a system-informed enhancement of the thermodynamic description to unknown binary systems based on information present in the available thermodynamic assessment. Thereby, significant experimental efforts in assessing new systems can be spared. We use an open database for steels containing 91 binary systems to generate our initial training (and validation) and amend it with several direct experimental reports. The model is thoroughly tested using different strategies, including a test of its predictive capabilities. The model shows excellent predictive capabilities outside of the training dataset as soon as some data containing species of the predicted system is included in the training dataset. The estimated uncertainty of the model is below 1 kJ/mol for the predicted mixing enthalpy. Subsequently, we used our model to predict the enthalpy of mixing of all binary systems not present in the original database and extracted the Redlich-Kister parameters, which can be readily reintegrated into the thermodynamic database file.

Abstract: Polaritons in van-der-Waals materials (vdWM) promise high confinement and multiple tailoring options by optical structures, e.g., resonators, launching structures and lenses. These optical structures are conventionally fabricated using cumbersome multi-process lithography techniques. In contrast, phase-change materials (PCMs) offer fast and reconfigurable programming of optical structures. PCMs can reversibly be switched between two stable phases with distinct permittivities by local heating, e.g., by optical laser pulses. While the well-known dielectric PCM GeSbTe-alloys feature only a permittivity change, the PCM In3SbTe2 can be switched between a dielectric and metallic phase. This makes In3SbTe2 promising for programming metallic launching structures. Here, we demonstrate direct optical programming and thereby rapid prototyping of optical launching structures in In3SbTe2 to tailor and confine polaritons in vdWM. We combine the vdWM hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) with In3SbTe2 and optically program circular resonators for hBN's phonon polaritons through hBN into In3SbTe2. We investigate the polariton resonators with near-field optical microscopy. Demonstrating the reconfigurability, we decrease the resonator diameter to increase the polariton confinement. Finally, we fabricate focusing structures for hBN's phonon polaritons whose focal point is changed in a second post-processing step. We promote In3SbTe2 as a versatile platform for rapid prototyping of polariton optics in vdWM.
