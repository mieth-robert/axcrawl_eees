Title: Information-Assisted Carnot Engine Surpasses Standard Thermodynamic Bounds
Authors: Yang Xiao, Qian Zeng, Jin Wang
Abstract: Information can improve heat engine performance, but the underlying principles are still not so clear. Here we introduce a Carnot information machine (CIE) and obtain a quantitative relationship between the engine performance and information. We demonstrate that the presence of information changes allows the CIE to operate as a heat engine in the regime where the standard Carnot cycle is prohibited, ensures that the efficiency of the CIE is greater than or equal to the standard Carnot efficiency, and significantly enables it to achieve 100\% efficiency with positive work extraction for arbitrary two-level systems. We explicitly demonstrate these features using a spin-1/2 system and propose an experimental implementation scheme based on a trapped $^{40}\mathrm{Ca}^+$ ion.

Title: The Hofstadter Butterfly: Bridging Condensed Matter, Topology, and Number Theory
Authors: Indubala Satija
Abstract: Celebrating its golden jubilee, the Hofstadter butterfly fractal emerges as a remarkable fusion of art and science. This iconic X shaped fractal captivates physicists, mathematicians, and enthusiasts alike by elegantly illustrating the energy spectrum of electrons within a two dimensional crystal lattice influenced by a magnetic field. Enriched with integers of topological origin that serve as quanta of Hall conductivity, this quantum fractal and its variations have become paradigm models for topological insulators, novel states of matter in 21st century physics. This paper delves into the theoretical framework underlying butterfly fractality through the lenses of geometry and number theory. Within this poetic mathematics, we witness a rare form of quantum magic: Natures use of abstract fractals in crafting the butterfly graph itself. In its simplest form, the butterfly graph tessellates a two dimensional plane with trapezoids and triangles, where the quanta of Hall conductivity are embedded in the integer sloped diagonals of the trapezoids. The theoretical framework is succinctly expressed through unimodular matrices with integer coefficients, bringing to life abstract constructs such as the Farey tree, the Apollonian gaskets, and the Pythagorean triplet tree.

Title: Generalized cluster algorithms for Potts lattice gauge theory
Authors: Anthony E. Pizzimenti, Paul Duncan, Benjamin Schweinhart
Abstract: Monte Carlo algorithms, like the Swendsen-Wang and invaded-cluster, sample the Ising and Potts models asymptotically faster than single-spin Glauber dynamics do. Here, we generalize both algorithms to sample Potts lattice gauge theory by way of a $2$-dimensional cellular representation called the plaquette random-cluster model. The invaded-cluster algorithm targets Potts lattice gauge theory at criticality by implementing a stopping condition defined in terms of homological percolation, the emergence of spanning surfaces on the torus. Simulations for $\mathbb Z_2$ and $\mathbb Z_3$ lattice gauge theories on the cubical $4$-dimensional torus indicate that both generalized algorithms exhibit much faster autocorrelation decay than single-spin dynamics and allow for efficient sampling on $4$-dimensional tori of linear scale at least $40$.

Title: Lattice-charge coupling in a trilayer nickelate with intertwined density wave order
Authors: Xun Jia, Yao Shen, Harrison LaBollita, Xinglong Chen, Junjie Zhang, Yu Li, Hengdi Zhao, Mercouri G. Kanatzidis, Matthew Krogstad, Hong Zheng, Ayman Said, Ahmet Alatas, Stephan Rosenkranz, Daniel Phelan, Mark P. M. Dean, M. R. Norman, J. F. Mitchell, Antia S. Botana, Yue Cao
Abstract: Intertwined charge and spin correlations are ubiquitous in a wide range of transition metal oxides and are often perceived as intimately related to unconventional superconductivity. Theoretically envisioned as driven by strong electronic correlations, the intertwined order is usually found to be strongly coupled to the lattice as signaled by pronounced phonon softening. Recently, both charge/spin density waves (CDW/SDW) and superconductivity have been discovered in several Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) nickelates, in particular trilayer nickelates RE4Ni3O10 (RE=Pr, La). The nature of the intertwined order and the role of lattice-charge coupling are at the heart of the debate about these materials. Using inelastic X-ray scattering, we mapped the phonon dispersions in RE4Ni3O10 and found no evidence of phonon softening near the CDW wavevector over a wide temperature range. Calculations of the electronic susceptibility revealed a peak at the observed SDW ordering vector but not at the CDW wavevector. The absence of phonon softening is in sharp contrast to that in canonical oxide materials, notably cuprates. Our experimental and theoretical findings highlight the crucial role of the spin degree of freedom and establish a foundation for understanding the interplay between superconductivity and density-wave transitions in RP nickelate superconductors and beyond.

Title: High-performance amorphous superconducting rhenium films by e-beam evaporation
Authors: E.V. Tarkaeva, V.A. Ievleva, A.R. Prishchepa, E.S. Zhukova, A.V. Terentiev, A.Yu. Kuntsevich
Abstract: We present electron beam evaporation of rhenium films on room-temperature substrates. The films are shown to be amorphous and achieve a record-high critical temperature for rhenium - exceeding 7 K at the midpoint of the transition - alongside a high critical current density of 5000 A/mm^2 and critical fields above 10 T. Terahertz spectroscopy reveals a BCS-like character of superconductivity with a zero-temperature energy gap of approximately 2 meV and subgap optical conductivity. Despite being friable, the films are stable and compatible with lift-off processes that opens the capabilities for superconducting device applications.

Title: Cutting soft materials: how material differences shape the response
Authors: Miguel Angel Moreno-Mateos, Paul Steinmann
Abstract: Cutting soft materials is a complex process governed by the interplay of bulk large deformation, interfacial soft fracture, and contact forces with the cutting tool. Existing experimental characterizations and numerical models often fail to capture the variety of observed cutting behaviors, especially the transition from indentation to cutting and the roles of dissipative mechanisms. Here, we combine novel experimental cutting tests on three representative materials-a soft hydrogel, elastomer, and food-based materials-with a coupled computational model that integrates soft fracture, adhesion, and frictional interactions. Our experiments reveal material-dependent cutting behaviors, with abrupt or smooth transitions from indentation to crack initiation, followed by distinct steady cutting regimes. The computational model captures these behaviors and shows that adhesion and viscous cohesive forces dominate tangential stresses, while Coulomb friction plays a negligible role due to low contact pressures. Together, these results provide new mechanistic insights into the physics of soft cutting and offer a unified framework to guide the design of soft materials, cutting tools, and cutting protocols, with direct relevance to surgical applications and the engineering of food textures optimized for mastication.

Title: Competing Length Scales and Symmetry Frustration Govern Non-Universal Melting in 2D Core-softened Colloidal Crystals
Authors: Thiago Puccinelli, Alexandre V. Ilha, José Rafael Bordin
Abstract: We investigate the melting behavior of two-dimensional colloidal crystals stabilized by a core-softened potential featuring two competing interaction length scales. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we analyze three polymorphic solid phases -- low-density triangular, stripe, and kagome -- and uncover distinct melting pathways. The triangular and kagome crystals undergo abrupt first-order transitions, driven by the interplay between energetic frustration and structural reorganization. In particular, the LDT phase melts through a sharp transition induced by a crossover between the two characteristic length scales. In contrast, the stripe phase exhibits a continuous transition with liquid-crystalline features: orientational and translational order decay gradually, while intra-stripe mobility persists, consistent with a KTHNY-like scenario. These findings demonstrate that melting in 2D soft-matter systems is inherently non-universal and governed by the competition between lattice symmetry, frustration, and multiple interaction scales. Our results provide microscopic insight into melting mechanisms beyond classical universality classes and offer guiding principles for the design of self-assembled materials with tunable phase behavior.

Title: Magnon-induced topological phases
Authors: Kosuke Fujiwara, Takahiro Morimoto
Abstract: Topological electronic states such as topological insulators and quantum Hall states typically require strong spin-orbit coupling or magnetic fields. In this study, we consider an electron system coupled to a spin system, where electrons interact with magnons, quasiparticles of spin waves. We show that the interaction between electrons and magnons transfers the effect of symmetry breaking in the spin system to the electron system, whereby a non-trivial topological phase can be induced in the electron system that is otherwise topologically trivial. Through this ``topology transfer'' mechanism, we demonstrate the realization of various topological phases, including quantum Hall and quantum spin Hall insulators, in simple ferromagnetic spin systems, without requiring strong spin-orbit coupling or magnetic field for electron systems.

Title: Optically detected magnetic resonance of nitrogen-vacancy centers in microdiamonds inside nanopolycrystalline diamond anvil cell
Authors: Masahiro Ohkuma, Keigo Arai, Kenji Ohta, Toru Shinmei, Ryo Matsumoto, Yoshihiko Takano, Tetsuo Irifune
Abstract: We demonstrated optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in microdiamonds inside a diamond anvil cell pressurized with nanopolycrystalline diamond (NPD) anvils. NPD exhibits high optical transparency, superior hardness, and low thermal conductivity, making it suitable for optical and spectroscopic measurements under high-pressure and high-temperature conditions. We observed the ODMR signal from an ensemble of NV centers under high pressures, reaching up to 20 GPa, with a culet diameter of 600 $\mu$m. We also performed ODMR measurements on multiple microdiamonds sealed inside a sample chamber and found that the resonance frequency varied with the pressure distribution. The combination of NPD and microdiamonds containing NV centers is auspicious for pressure and magnetic imaging under concurrent high-pressure and high-temperature conditions.

Title: Learning general pair interactions between self-propelled particles
Authors: Jérôme Hem, Alexis Poncet, Pierre Ronceray, Daiki Nishiguchi, Vincent Démery
Abstract: Synthetic active matter systems, such as active colloids, often have complex interactions, which can be of hydrodynamic, chemical or electrostatic origin and cannot be computed from first principles. Here, we use Stochastic Force Inference to learn general pair interactions, including transverse forces and torques, between self-propelled Janus particles from experimental trajectories. We use data from two experiments: one where the particles flock, and one where the system remains disordered. The learned interactions are then fed to numerical simulations, which reproduce all the experimental observables and could be extrapolated to different densities. Overall, we find that the radial interaction is mostly repulsive and isotropic, while the angular interaction has a richer angular dependence, which controls the behavior of the system; the transverse interaction is negligible. Finally, testing the symmetry relations obeyed by the inferred interactions allows us to show that they cannot come from electrostatics only, so that they must have a hydrodynamic component.

Title: Nonlinear management of the miscibility-immiscibility transition in binary Bose-Einstein condensates
Authors: B. B. Baizakov, B. A. Malomed, M. Salerno
Abstract: We investigate application of the nonlinearity management (NM, i.e., periodic variation of the strength of the inter-component repulsion) to the miscibility-immiscibility (MIM) transition across the critical point of a two-component BEC, both with and without the linear mixing (Rabi coupling, RC) between the components. To this end, we first identify, by means of a variational approximation and numerical solution, diverse stationary domain-wall (DW) structures supported by the system in the absence of the management. The approximate analytical solutions for the DWs are found to be in excellent agreement with their numerical counterparts. An analytical estimate is also produced for the upshift of the MIM transition caused by the pressure of the trapping potential in the case of a confined system. An exact DW solution is produced for the system including the Pöschl-Teller potential, which is stable (unstable) if the potential is repulsive (attractive). Further, we find the spectrum of linear excitations in the spatially uniform mixed state, and thus establish parameter regions where the system is stable/unstable against demixing. In particular, RC upshifts the critical strength of the inter-component repulsion for the onset of the MIM transition. Eigenfrequencies of excitations on top of DW states are identified from numerical simulations through monitoring the evolution of perturbed states. Weak NM applied at the DW eigenfrequency reveals features of the nonlinear resonance. Stronger NM, under which the system periodically crosses the MIM-transition point, restricts the miscibility.

Title: Topological Majorana flat bands in the Kitaev model on a Bishamon-kikko lattice
Authors: Kiyu Fukui, Yukitoshi Motome
Abstract: We unveil an interesting example of topological flat bands of Majorana fermions in quantum spin liquids. We study the Kitaev model on a periodically depleted honeycomb lattice, under a magnetic field within the perturbation theory. The model can be straightforwardly extended while maintaining the exact solvability, and its ground state is a quantum spin liquid as on the honeycomb lattice. As fractionalized excitations, there are unpaired localized Majorana fermions in addition to the itinerant Majorana fermions and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ fluxes. We show that in the absence of the magnetic field the Majorana fermions have completely flat bands at zero energy, and by applying the magnetic field, they turn into topological flat bands with nonzero Chern number. By varying the anisotropy of the interactions and the magnitude of the magnetic field, we clarify that the system exhibits a variety of topological phases that do not appear in the original model. We emphasize that the topological flat bands that give this rich topology come from the hybridization of the Majorana flat bands and unpaired Majorana fermions, which is unique to the flat bands of fractionalized excitations in quantum spin liquids. Our findings would stimulate the exploration of a new type of Kitaev materials exhibiting rich topology from topological Majorana flat bands.

Title: Topological signatures of jamming in granular force networks via persistent homology
Authors: Vishali S, Abrar Naseer, Vijay Natarajan, Tejas G Murthy
Abstract: Granular materials exhibit intricate force networks, often concentrated in chains rather than being uniformly distributed. These meso-scale structures are complex to characterize, owing to their heterogeneous and anisotropic nature. We present a topological analysis in which we characterize force networks by studying the connectivity of contact forces in granular materials. We obtain the force network data during the isotropic compression of a 2D granular ensemble, which comprises of bidisperse photoelastic disks. The force chains are visualized using a bright-field polariscope, which are then analyzed using photoelasticity techniques to get contact force information across all the particles in the granular ensemble. The forces and contact network are studied using topological descriptors. We analyze the evolution of these descriptors using methods developed in the areas of computational topology and persistent homology. Specifically, we evaluate the number of homology class generators to capture critical changes in network connectivity with the evolution of packing fraction. Building on previous applications of persistent homology, our topological analysis of the force network provides valuable insights by distinguishing different phases of particle interactions and revealing unique structural transitions around jamming and thus help enhance our understanding of the stability and jamming dynamics in granular systems.

Title: Strain-Engineered Electronic Structure and Superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ Thin Films
Authors: Yu-Han Cao, Kai-Yue Jiang, Hong-Yan Lu, Da Wang, Qiang-Hua Wang
Abstract: Recently, the films of the Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) nickelate superconductors, in which the (La,Pr)$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ system exhibits a remarkable transition temperature $T_c$ exceeding 40 K, were synthesized at ambient pressure. We systematically investigate the band structures and electronic correlation effect to identify the key factors controlling superconductivity and pathways to enhance $T_c$. Based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we construct a bilayer two-orbital ($3d_{3z^2-r^2}$ and $3d_{x^2-y^2}$) tight-binding model for a series of in-plane compression mimicking the substrate effect. We find the band energy at the $M$ point drops with the compression, leading to increase of the density of states at the Fermi level, in stark contrast to the behavior of the bulk under pressure. We then apply functional renormalization group (FRG) method to study the electronic correlation effect on the superconductivity. We find the $s_\pm$-wave pairing symmetry remains robust in the films, the same as the bulk. But somewhat surprisingly, for the films, we find $T_c$ can be enhanced by reducing the in-plane lattice constant, increasing the out-of-plane lattice constant, or further electron-doping. These findings are consistent with the itinerant picture of the superconductivity induced by spin-fluctuations and provide theoretical support for further boosting $T_c$ in future experiments.

Title: Spin-Electric Control of Individual Molecules on Surfaces
Authors: Paul Greule, Wantong Huang, Máté Stark, Kwan Ho Au-Yeung, Johannes Schwenk, Jose Reina-Gálvez, Christoph Sürgers, Wolfgang Wernsdorfer, Christoph Wolf, Philip Willke
Abstract: Individual magnetic molecules are promising building blocks for quantum technologies because of their chemical tunability, nanoscale dimensions, and ability to self-assemble into ordered arrays. However, harnessing their properties in quantum information processing requires precise local control of their spin properties. In this work, we present spin-electric coupling (SEC) for two molecular spin systems, iron phthalocyanine (FePc) and Fe-FePc complexes, adsorbed on a surface. We use electron spin resonance combined with scanning tunnelling microscopy (ESR-STM) to locally address them with the STM tip and electrically tune them using the applied bias voltage. These measurements reveal a pronounced nonlinear voltage dependence of the resonance frequency, linked to the energic onset of other molecular orbitals. We attribute this effect to a transport-mediated exchange field from the magnetic tip, providing a large, highly localized, and broadly applicable SEC mechanism. Finally, we demonstrate that the SEC enables all-electrical coherent spin control: In Rabi oscillation measurements of both single and coupled Fe-FePc complexes we show that the spin dynamics can be tuned, demonstrating a pathway towards electrically controlled quantum operation.

Title: Moiré-Induced Magnetoelectricity in Twisted Bilayer NiI2
Authors: Haiyan Zhua, Hongyu Yua, Weiqin Zhua, Guoliang Yua, Changsong Xu, Hongjun Xiang
Abstract: Twisted magnetic van der Waals (vdW) materials offer a promising route for multiferroic engineering, yet modeling large-scale moiré superlattices remains challenging. Leveraging a newly developed SpinGNN++ framework that effectively handles spin-lattice coupled systems, we develop a comprehensive interatomic machine learning (ML) potential and apply it to twisted bilayer NiI2 (TBN). Structural relaxation introduces moiré-periodic "bumps" that modulate the interlayer spacing by about 0.55~Å and in-plane ionic shifts up to 0.48~Å. Concurrently, our ML potential, which faithfully captures all key spin interactions, produces reliable magnetic configurations; combined with the generalized KNB mechanism, it yields accurate spin-driven polarization. For twist angles 1.89^{\circ} \leq \theta \leq 2.45^{\circ}, both mechanisms become prominent, yielding rich polarization textures that combine ionic out-of-plane dipoles with purely electronic in-plane domains. In the rigid (unrelaxed) bilayer, skyrmions are absent; lattice relaxation is essential for generating polar-magnetic topologies. In contrast, near {\theta} \approx 60^{\circ}, stacking-dependent ferroelectric displacements dominate, giving rise to polar meron-antimeron networks. These results reveal cooperative ionic and spin-driven ferroelectricity in TBN, positioning twisted vdW magnets as adaptable platforms for tunable multiferroic devices.

Title: Enhancing Coherence with a Clock Transition and Dynamical Decoupling in the Cr$_7$Mn Molecular Nanomagnet

Friedman (1,2) ((1) Department of Physics and Astronomy, Amherst College, Amherst, USA (2) Department of Physics, University of Massachusetts Amherst, Amherst, USA (3) Department of Chemistry, The University of Manchester, Manchester, UK)
Abstract: Molecular magnets are attractive as spin qubits due to their chemical tunability, addressability through electron-spin resonance techniques, and long coherence times. Clock transitions (CTs), for which the system is immune to the effect of magnetic-field fluctuations to first order, provide a method to enhance the coherence time $T_2$, and to reveal mechanisms of decoherence that are not due to such fluctuations. Here we investigate two variants of Cr$_7$Mn, a spin-1 molecular nanomagnet, at fields near a zero-field CT. We find that at temperatures $\le$2 K, $T_2\sim1$ $\mu$s at the CT using a Hahn-echo pulse sequence. Away from the CT, electron-spin-echo envelope modulation (ESEEM) oscillations due to coupling to nuclear spins are observed and have a $T_2$ as high as $1.35$ $\mu$s, indicating a distinct mechanism of coherence preservation. Dynamical decoupling with the CPMG pulse sequence yields $T_2\sim\!2.8$ $\mu$s at the CT and up to $\sim\!3.6$ $\mu$s in the ESEEM regime along with a demodulation of the oscillatory behavior. The experimental values of $T_2$ are largely independent of the degree of dilution of the molecules in solvent or whether the solvent is deuterated, indicating that much of the decoherence and ESEEM arises from sources within the molecules themselves. To account for decoherence, we develop a model that includes not only field fluctuations but also fluctuations in the CT transition frequency itself. Our results can be well explained by treating the environment as a combination of noise at the nuclear Larmor precession frequency and $1/f$ noise in the transverse anisotropy parameter $E$. Such information about the microscopic origins of decoherence can aid the rational design of molecular-based spin qubits.

Title: Autferroicity: concept, candidates, and applications
Authors: Jun-Jie Zhang, Ziwen Wang, Shuai Dong
Abstract: Autferroicity is a newly proposed form of hybrid ferroicity, which is a sister branch of multiferroicity. It is characterized by the mutually exclusive magnetic and polar phases within a single system, giving a unique seesaw-type magnetoelectric coupling. This perspective provides a theoretical overview of its underlying concept, phase diagram characteristics, and representative candidates such as Ti-based trichalcogenide monolayers, while also highlighting its potential applications in nonvolatile memory devices and true random number generation.

Title: Phase Transition Under Control: Toward Application-Oriented Luminescence Thermometry and Thermally Activated Emission
Authors: M. T. Abbas, M. Szymczak, D. Szymanski, J. Zeler, M. Drozd, L. T. K Giang, L. Marciniak
Abstract: Phase-transition-based luminescent thermometers are characterized by two inherent limitations: a narrow thermal operating range and the presence of a hysteresis loop in the thermometric parameter. In this work, we demonstrate that controlling the particle size of LaGaO3:Eu3+ phosphors enables significant enhancement of thermometric performance. Specifically, a reduction in grain size dispersion leads to an increase in relative thermal sensitivity and significantly narrows the hysteresis loop. As a result of this approach, the relative sensitivity was increased to 18.2% K-1 for LaGaO3:Eu3+ synthesized via the solid-state method, compared to 3.0% K-1 for the counterpart prepared using the Pechini method. Furthermore, we show that the intentional incorporation of Al3+ and Sc3+ co-dopant ions allows for continuous tuning of the structural phase transition temperature from 165 K for 15% Al3+ to 491 K for 2% Sc3+, without significantly affecting the low-temperature spectroscopic properties of Eu3+ ions. This ability to shift the phase transition temperature in LaGaO3 offers a practical route to modulate the thermal response range of the luminescent thermometer, enabling its adaptation to specific application requirements. The empirical relationship established in this study between the phase transition temperature and the ionic radius mismatch parameter provides a predictive tool for the rational design of phase-transition-based phosphors with tailored thermometric performance. The ability to systematically tune the phase transition temperature via ionic radius mismatch, together with enhanced thermometric performance resulting from reduced grain size dispersion, establishes a coherent strategy for the rational design of high-sensitivity, low-hysteresis thermal sensors.

Title: Investigation of competing magnetic orders and the associated spin-phonon coupling effect in quasi-2D Cr1+xTe2 (x = 0.22) single crystal
Authors: Gayathri V, Sathishkumar M, Sandip Kumar Kuila, Vikash Kumar, Abhidev B, Reshna Elsa Philip, Partha Pratim Jana, Soham Manni
Abstract: Single crystals of quasi-2D chromium telluride system represented by Cr1+xTe2 (x = 0.22), which crystallizes in the trigonal structure with the c-axis as the growth direction, are synthesized by the flux method. The magnetization measurements revealed the coexistence and competition between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic exchange interactions due to the presence of the intercalated Cr-layers. A series of diverse magnetic transitions is exhibited by the crystal. While cooling the crystal, it undergoes a paramagnetic to antiferromagnetic transition at 190 K, followed by a transition into a ferromagnetic state at around 160 K, and a spin-canting at a lower temperature of 75 K. A possible lack of inversion symmetry in the crystal structure, along with the observance of an unusual jump and loop opening in the isothermal magnetization suggests that the crystals Cr1+xTe2 (x = 0.22) may host skyrmions. Furthermore, concomitant to their magnetic transitions, anomalies were observed in the derived Breit-Wigner-Fano fit parameters obtained from the asymmetric temperature-dependent Raman spectra, evidencing a strong spin-phonon coupling effect, intrinsic to the grown crystals. A strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy along with the robust spin-phonon coupling, makes the system a promising candidate for prospective spintronics applications.

Title: Resonant two-qubit gates for fermionic simulations with spin qubits
Authors: Konstantinos Tsoukalas, Alexei Orekhov, Bence Hetényi, Uwe von Lüpke, Jeth Arunseangroj, Inga Seidler, Lisa Sommer, Eoin G. Kelly, Leonardo Massai, Michele Aldeghi, Marta Pita-Vidal, Stephen W. Bedell, Stephan Paredes, Felix J. Schupp, Matthias Mergenthaler, Gian Salis, Andreas Fuhrer, Patrick Harvey-Collard
Abstract: In gate-defined semiconductor spin qubits, the highly tunable Heisenberg exchange interaction is leveraged to implement fermionic two-qubit gates such as CZ and SWAP. However, the broader family of fermionic simulation (fSim) gates remains unexplored, and has the potential to enhance the performance of near-term quantum simulation algorithms. Here, we demonstrate a method to implement the fSim gate set in spin qubits using a single pulse combining baseband and resonant exchange drives. This approach minimizes gate duration and drive amplitude, mitigating decoherence and crosstalk. We validate its effectiveness by realizing a resonant iSWAP gate between two hole spins in germanium, achieving a fidelity of 93.8(5)% extracted with interleaved randomized benchmarking. Quantum process tomography confirms accurate gate calibration and identifies qubit decoherence as the dominant error source. Our results establish a practical route toward a versatile and efficient two-qubit gate set for spin-based quantum processors.

Title: Molecular Dynamics Study of Rayleigh-Plateau Instability at Liquid-Liquid Interfaces
Authors: Shunta Kikuchi, Hiroshi Watanabe
Abstract: We investigated the Rayleigh-Plateau instability at the interface between two immiscible liquids of equal viscosity using molecular dynamics simulations. We examined two types of initial conditions: one involving a single-mode perturbation at the interface and the other without any imposed perturbation. The growth rate under single-mode perturbation showed strong agreement with classical theory, particularly for large cylinder this http URL, for smaller radii, the growth rate deviated significantly from the theoretical prediction. This discrepancy can be attributed to the effects of thermal fluctuations or pressure differences between the inside and outside of a cylinder. In contrast, with initial conditions free of perturbation, we observed a relationship between breakup time and minimum radius, where the power exponent decreased as the radius decreased. This result suggests that thermal fluctuations have a more substantial impact on systems of smaller dimensions. This study demonstrated that imposing single-mode perturbations effectively suppresses thermal noise and mode coupling, thereby yielding growth rates consistent with those predicted by linear stability analysis.

Title: Improving structure search with hyperspatial optimization and TETRIS seeding
Authors: Daviti Gochitashvili, Maxwell Meyers, Cindy Wang, Aleksey N. Kolmogorov
Abstract: Advanced structure prediction methods developed over the past decades include an unorthodox strategy of allowing atoms to displace into extra dimensions. A recently implemented global optimization of structures from hyperspace (GOSH) has shown promise in accelerating the identification of global minima on potential energy surfaces defined by simple interatomic models. In this study, we extend the GOSH formalism to more accurate Behler-Parrinello neural network (NN) potentials, make it compatible with efficient local minimization algorithms, and test its performance on nanoparticles and crystalline solids. For clusters modeled with NN potentials, four-dimensional optimization offers fairly modest improvement in navigating geometric relaxation pathways and incurs increased computational cost largely offsetting the benefit, but it provides a significant advantage in facilitating atom swaps in nanoalloys. In comparison, the introduction of a moderate, controlled bias for generating more physically sensible starting configurations, achieved via TETRIS-inspired packing of atomic blocks, has a more direct impact on the efficiency of global structure searches. The benchmarked systems are Lennard-Jones clusters, Au or Cu-Pd-Ag nanoparticles and binary Sn alloys described by NN potentials, and compounds with covalent B or BC frameworks modeled with density functional theory

Title: Intraband circular photogalvanic effect in Weyl semimetals
Authors: L. E. Golub, E. L. Ivchenko
Abstract: We apply the semiclassical theory including the Berry curvature dipole, side jumps and skew scattering for a quantitative description of the circular photogalvanic effect (CPGE) in Weyl semimetals at intraband absorption. In contrast to gapped systems where they completely exhaust all contributions to the CPGE current, all previously known semiclassical mechanisms give a result different from that obtained using a complete quantum-mechanical approach. We show that this difference in the existing quasiclassical and full quantum-mechanical approaches persists at all spatial ranges of the disorder potential. Apparently, the implementation of another microscopic mechanism into the quasiclassical description of the CPGE is required.

Title: Less is more: removing a single bond increases the toughness of elastic networks
Authors: Antoine Sanner, Luca Michel, Alessandra Lingua, David S. Kammer
Abstract: We investigate how the removal of a single bond affects the fracture behavior of triangular spring networks, whereby we systematically vary the position of the removed bond. Our simulations show that removing the bond has two contrasting effects on the fracture energy for initiation of crack propagation and on the fracture energy for failure of the entire network. A single missing bond can either lower or raise the initiation fracture energy, depending on its placement relative to the crack tip. In contrast, the failure fracture energy is always equal to or greater than that of a perfect network. For most initial placements of the missing bond, the crack path remains straight, and the increased failure fracture energy results from arrest at the point of maximum local fracture resistance. When the crack deviates from a straight path, we observe an even higher fracture energy, which we attribute primarily to crack bridging. This additional toughening mechanism becomes active only at low failure strains of the springs; at higher failure strains, the crack path tends to remain straight. Altogether, our results demonstrate that even a single bond removal can significantly enhance toughness, offering fundamental insights into the role of defects in polymer networks and informing the design of tough architected materials.

Title: Resonant Photoluminescence of Quantum Incompressible Liquids
Authors: D. A. Shchigarev, A. V. Larionov, L. V. Kulik, E. M. Budanov, I. V. Kukushkin, V. Umansky
Abstract: We investigate resonant photoluminescence arising from incompressible quantum liquids formed in two-dimensional electron systems. We demonstrate that, for excitons composed of a photoexcited electron occupying the upper spin sublevel of the zeroth Landau level and a valence-band hole, the influence of disorder potential fluctuations on optical recombination is strongly suppressed, indicating complete screening of the disorder. We identify an optical invariant quantity that is insensitive to excitation energy yet strongly dependent on the electron temperature, serving as a probe of exciton recombination in quantum liquids. Analysis of this quantity reveals that quantum-liquid formation initiates at (n = 1/3) as the electron temperature decreases, consistent with the Laughlin state. Upon further cooling, the range of filling factors exhibiting quantum-liquid behavior expands continuously from (n = 1/3) toward (n = 1/2). Transitions between distinct incompressible quantum-liquid states occur smoothly, without well-defined phase boundaries separating insulating and conducting regimes. Locally, the system retains quantum-liquid characteristics even as bulk transport measurements indicate finite conductivity. Finally, we present a phase diagram delineating the stability region of incompressible quantum liquids relative to conductive phases.

Title: Extension of Second-Principles Density Functional Theory into the time domain
Authors: Toraya Fernández-Ruiz, Jorge Íñiguez, Javier Junquera, Pablo García-Fernández
Abstract: We present an extension of the second-principles density functional theory (SPDFT) method to perform time-dependent simulations. Our approach, which calculates the evolution of the density matrix in real time and real space using the Liouville-von Neumann equation of motion, allows determining optical and transport properties for very large systems, involving tens of thousands of atoms, using very modest computational platforms. In contrast with other methods, we show that SPDFT can be applied to a wide variety of materials including both metals and insulators. In particular, we illustrate its capabilities by obtaining the spectra of SrTiO$_3$, diamond and metallic lithium. We find that, while SPDFT results in SrTiO$_3$ are quite similar to those obtained from DFT using linear perturbation theory, we observe significant improvements over this method in both diamond and metallic lithium. The inclusion of electron-electron interactions during the evolution of the density matrix in diamond allows the spectra to more closely resemble those obtained with the Bethe-Salpeter equation than from perturbation theory. In lithium time-dependent SPDFT not only predicts interband transitions but also the Drude peak, opening the possibility of detailed ab initio studies of transport properties beyond many of the usual approximations.

Abstract: Magnetite ($Fe_3O_4$) nanoparticles are crucial for biomedical applications, including magnetic hyperthermia, targeted drug delivery, and MRI contrast enhancement, due to their biocompatibility and unique physicochemical properties. Here, we investigate how surface states influence their induction performance. Heat treatment removes surface water and FeOOH, forming a ${\gamma}$-$Fe_2O_3$ shell, as confirmed by synchrotron powder diffraction, neutron powder diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and time-of-flight inelastic neutron spectroscopy. AC magnetic susceptibility measurements reveal that this surface modification enhances magnetic anisotropy and reduces the spin relaxation time, leading to a 140% increase in the specific absorption rate. Additionally, the increased anisotropy suppresses the low-temperature clustered spin-glass transition and raises the blocking temperature. These findings highlight surface-state engineering as a powerful approach to optimizing $Fe_3O_4$ nanoparticles for biomedical applications.

Title: Sizable superconducting gap and anisotropic chiral topological superconductivity in the Weyl semimetal PtBi$_2$
Authors: Xiaochun Huang, Lingxiao Zhao, Sebastian Schimmel, Julia Besproswanny, Patrick Härtl, Christian Hess, Bernd Büchner, Matthias Bode
Abstract: Topological superconductors offer a fertile ground for realizing Majorana zero modes -- topologically protected, zero-energy quasiparticles that are resilient to local perturbations and hold great promise for fault-tolerant quantum computing. Recent studies have presented encouraging evidence for intrinsic topological superconductivity in the Weyl semimetal trigonal PtBi$_2$, hinting at a robust surface phase potentially stable beyond the McMillan limit. However, due to substantial spatial variations in the observed superconducting (SC) gap $\Delta$ the nature of the underlying order parameter $\Delta$($k$) remained under debate. Here we report the realization of sizable surface SC gaps ($\Delta > 10\,\mathrm{meV}$) in PtBi$_2$, exhibiting remarkable spatial uniformity from hundreds of nanometers down to the atomic level, as revealed by scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy. Building on this spatial homogeneity -- indicative of long-range phase coherence -- we uncover previously unobserved low-energy Andreev bound states (ABSs) that ubiquitously emerge within the SC gap across the surface. Theoretical simulations that closely reproduce the experimental spectra, reveal an anisotropic chiral pairing symmetry of $\Delta$($k$), and further suggest that the observed ABSs are of topological origin. The combination of a large, nontrivial pairing gap and accessible surface states establishes PtBi$_2$ as a compelling platform for investigating topological superconductivity and its associated Majorana modes.

Title: Driven shear flow in biological magneto-active fluids
Authors: Malo Marmol, Cécile Cottin-Bizonne, Andrejs Cebers, Damien Faivre, Christophe Ybert
Abstract: Active fluids made of powered suspended particles have unique abilities to self-generate flow and density structures. How such dynamics can be triggered and leveraged by external cues is a key question of both biological and applied relevance. Here we use magnetotactic bacteria to explore how chemotaxis and magnetotaxis -- leading, respectively, to positional and orientational responses -- combine to generate global scale flows. Such steady regime can be quantitatively captured by a magneto-active hydrodynamic model, while time-dependent magnetic driving unveils additional patterning complexity. Overall, our findings shed light on how active fluids respond to the ubiquitous situation of multiple external information, also suggesting routes for their manipulation.

Title: Linear response and exact hydrodynamic projections in Lindblad equations with decoupled Bogoliubov hierarchies
Authors: Patrik Penc, Fabian H. L. Essler
Abstract: We consider a class of spinless-fermion Lindblad equations that exhibit decoupled BBGKY hierarchies. In the cases where particle number is conserved, their late time behaviour is characterized by diffusive dynamics, leading to an infinite temperature steady state. Some of these models are Yang-Baxter integrable, others are not. The simple structure of the BBGKY hierarchy makes it possible to map the dynamics of Heisenberg-picture operators on few-body imaginary-time Schrödinger equations with non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. We use this formulation to obtain exact hydrodynamic projections of operators quadratic in fermions, and to determine linear response functions in Lindbladian non-equilibrium dynamics.

Title: Exact ground state on the 3D analogue of the Shastry-Sutherland model
Authors: Kelvin Salou-Smith, Arnaud Ralko, Ludovic D.C. Jaubert
Abstract: Exact results in frustrated quantum many-body systems are rare, especially in dimensions higher than one. The Shastry-Sutherland (SS) model stands out as a rare example of a two-dimensional spin system with an exactly solvable dimer singlet ground state. In this work, we introduce a three-dimensional analogue of the SS lattice, constructed by deforming the pyrochlore lattice to preserve the local SS geometry. Despite the dimensional increase and altered topology, the ground-state phase diagrams of classical Ising and Heisenberg spins, remain analytically tractable and closely follow their 2D counterparts, including the existence of a 1/3 magnetization plateau and umbrella states. Most notably, for quantum spins S = 1/2, the dimer singlet state survives as an exact ground state over a finite region of the phase diagram. We argue, using exact diagonalization, that the singlet phase is stabilized beyond its 2D counterpart, suggesting enhanced robustness in three dimensions. These results offer a rare, controlled platform to explore the impact of dimensionality on quantum frustration, exact solvability, and potential spin liquid behavior in 3D, with relevance to emergent topological and magnetic phases.

Title: Predicting temperature-dependent failure and transformation zones in 2D silica glass through quasistatic Gaussian Phase Packets
Authors: Miguel Spínola, Shashank Saxena, Franz Bamer, Dennis M. Kochmann
Abstract: The athermal quasistatic (AQS) method is a powerful technique to study the mechanical behavior of disordered systems. However, its applicability is limited to temperatures near zero, where thermal activation is unlikely. In this work, we extend the AQS method to finite temperatures, based on a formulation that describes atoms as temperature-dependent Gaussian packets (GPPs) in phase space under quasistatic conditions, thus equivalent to minimum free energy conditions. This framework is used to study the effect of temperature on the onset of inelasticity and fracture in amorphous two-dimensional silica glass approaching quasistatic conditions under uniaxial tensile loading. An important characteristic of this formulation is the directional dependence of the variance of each Gaussian packet in configuration space, making this formulation an inexpensive and accurate predictor of zones prone to atomic-scale rearrangements, both in the undeformed state and (with increasing accuracy) as the deformation progresses. This method is also shown to accurately capture the thermal expansion of the disordered material. Furthermore, combining the GPP description with Metropolis sampling predicts the effect of temperature on the onset of fracture of the material, which is validated through MD simulations at strain rates as low as $10^{4}$s$^{-1}$. The presented framework therefore provides a valuable technique for studying the nonlinear mechanics of disordered materials at finite temperature and for predicting local rearrangement zones in disordered solids efficiently without the need for expensive MD simulations.

Title: Alignment behavior of 2D diopsides (d-silicates) under the influence of an AC electric field
Authors: Himakshi Mishra, Bruno Ipaves, Raphael Benjamim de Oliveira, Marcelo Lopes Pereira Junior, Raphael Matozo Tromer, e Douglas Soares Galvao, Chandra Shekar Tiwary
Abstract: Controlling the alignment of two dimensional (2D) materials is crucial for optimizing their electronic and mechanical properties in next generation devices. This study explores how electric fields can manipulate the orientation of 2D diopside (CaMgSi2O6) flakes, a flexible silicate material, through a phenomenon called flexoelectricity, where applied voltage generates mechanical strain. We exfoliated diopside crystals into ultrathin flakes, placed them on microelectrodes, and used AC electric fields to induce alignment via acoustic strain. Raman spectroscopy showed that the flakes reoriented/realigned under the field, with vibrational peaks weakening most at high frequencies (10 MHz). Electrical tests revealed this alignment improves conductivity by 20-30%, as straightened flakes create better pathways for current flow. Fully atomistic molecular dynamics simulations further explained how these flakes naturally align on surfaces within picoseconds, matching our experimental observations. Together, these findings demonstrate a practical way to tune diopside properties using electric fields, opening doors for its use in flexible electronics, sensors, and energy devices.

Title: Excitonic Insulator and the Extended Falicov--Kimball Model Away from Half-Filling
Authors: D. I. Golosov (Bar-Ilan Univ., Israel)
Abstract: We consider an extended spinless Falicov--Kimball model at an arbitrary doping level, focusing on the range of parameter values where a uniform excitonic insulator is stabilised at half-filling. We compare the properties of possible uniform phases and construct the Hartree--Fock phase diagrams, which include sizeable phase separation regions. It is seen that the excitonic insulator can appear as a component phase in a mixed-phase state in a broad interval of doping levels. In addition, in a certain range of parameter values the excitonic metal (doped excitonic insulator) is identified as the lowest-energy uniform phase. We suggest that this phase, which is unstable with respect to phase separation, may be stabilised when the phase separation is suppressed by the long-range Coulomb interaction. Overall, we find that excitonic correlations can affect the behaviour of the system relatively far away from half-filling.

Title: Density Matrix Geometry and Sum Rules
Authors: Guangyue Ji, David E. Palomino, Nathan Goldman, Tomoki Ozawa, Peter Riseborough, Jie Wang, Bruno Mera
Abstract: Geometry plays a fundamental role in a wide range of physical responses, from anomalous transport coefficients to their related sum rules. Notable examples include the quantization of the Hall conductivity and the Souza-Wilkens-Martin (SWM) sum rule -- both valid at zero temperature, independent of interactions and disorder. The finite-temperature generalization of the SWM sum rule has been explored in the literature, revealing deep connections to the geometry of density matrices. Building on recent advances in time-dependent geometric frameworks, we propose a time-dependent quantum geometric tensor for thermal density matrices. This formalism provides a unified interpretation of known sum rules within the framework of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, further elucidating their fundamental geometric origin. In addition, it provides experimentally accessible methods to probe quantum geometry beyond the zero-temperature regime.

Title: Contact point geometry governs structural build-up at rest in Portland cement-limestone blends
Authors: Luca Michel, Antoine Sanner, Franco Zunino, Robert J. Flatt, David S. Kammer
Abstract: The early stiffening of fresh cement paste plays a key role in shaping and stability during casting and 3D printing. In Portland cement systems, this phenomenon arises from the formation of calcium-silicate-hydrate (C-S-H), which stiffens grain-to-grain contacts. However, the role of powder characteristics such as particle size and morphology remains poorly understood. Here, we vary the fineness and grain shape by blending Portland cement with either coarse or fine limestone, leveraging the affinity of C-S-H to nucleate on limestone surfaces. By coupling calorimetry and rheometry, we relate the amount of formed hydration products to the increase in stiffness, and show that the mechanism of contact stiffening through C-S-H formation remains unchanged with limestone addition. Nevertheless, the rate of stiffening varies across blends. We find that these rates correlate with a characteristic length scale that captures particle size and shape. These results demonstrate that early stiffening depends not only on the amount of hydration products formed, but also on the geometry of the contacts where these products form, offering a framework for understanding more complex systems such as limestone-calcined clay cements.

Title: Real time observation of glass-like carbon formation from SU-8 using X-ray and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy
Authors: Simon Astley, Jaspa Stritt, Soumen Mandal, Jerome A. Cuenca, D. Andrew Evans, Oliver A. Williams
Abstract: The structural development and change in elemental composition of SU-8 3005 photoresist into glass-like carbon due to pyrolysis up to 1000~$\degree$C is investigated utilising \textit{in-situ} x-ray and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS/UPS) under ultra-high vacuum (UHV). XPS spectra were analysed in order to investigate changes to elemental composition and physical structure. Peak asymmetry in the measured C 1s spectra is found to be a clear indicator of a transition in both physical structure and increased electrical conductivity. The \textit{in-situ} XPS measurement of pyrolysis is effective in isolating changes in oxygen composition solely due to the pyrolysis process. Oxygen concentration, C 1s peak asymmetry and C 1s peak positions are strong indicators of semiconducting SU-8 transitioning to conducting glass-like carbon. For SU-8 pyrolysed above temperatures of 500~$\degree$C, a clear development is observed in the material structure and composition towards a carbon rich conducting network indicative of glass-like carbon. UPS spectra were analysed to investigate the changes in secondary electron cut-off (SECO) and valence band maximum (VBM) as the SU-8 layer is heated in UHV. The changes in SECO and VBM correlates well with the XPS data and a zero binding energy state is observed at 1000~$\degree$C.

Title: Multiscale contact mechanics for elastoplastic contacts
Authors: Andreas Almqvist, Bo N. J. Persson
Abstract: Understanding contact between rough surfaces undergoing plastic deformation is crucial in many applications. We test Persson's multiscale contact mechanics theory for elastoplastic solids, assuming a constant penetration hardness. Using a numerical model based on the boundary element method, we simulate the contact between a rough, rigid surface and an elastic-perfectly plastic half-space with a flat surface. The theory's predictions for elastic, plastic, and total contact area agree quantitatively with the numerical results. The simulations also support the boundary conditions assumed in the theory, namely that the stress probability vanishes at both zero and yield stress. These findings reinforce the validity of the theory for systems with constant hardness.

Title: Predicting interface and spin states in armchair graphene nanoribbon junctions
Authors: Sofia Sanz, Daniel Sánchez-Portal
Abstract: We present a theoretical analysis of interface states emerging at junctions between armchair graphene nanoribbons of varying widths. By exploring diverse width combinations and junction geometries, we demonstrate that predicting the precise number of interface states requires considerations beyond the topological classification alone; specifically, the width differences and bonding configuration at the interface play crucial roles. For junctions involving ribbons with small gaps, we further examine how an applied strain affects their topological properties and, consequently, the interface states formed. The spin states at these junctions are investigated using the mean-field Hubbard model, revealing how the magnetic behavior at the interface depends on the number of localized states present. These results are summarized in a series of ``rules of thumb" to predict the number of localized states and the magnetic moment at the junction. Our findings contribute to understanding and engineering localized states in graphene-based devices, providing guidelines for manipulating electronic and magnetic properties through structural design.

Title: Emergent topology by Landau level mixing in quantum Hall-superconductor nanostructures
Authors: Yuriko Baba, Alfredo Levy Yeyati, Pablo Burset
Abstract: We demonstrate the emergence of novel topological phases in quantum Hall-superconductor hybrid systems driven by Landau level mixing and spin-orbit interactions. Focusing on a narrow superconducting stripe atop a two-dimensional electron gas, we identify regimes where the hybridization of the chiral Andreev states at each side of the stripe leads to different phases beyond the long sought $p$-wave superconducting one. These topological phases exhibit distinctive transport signatures, including quantized nonlocal conductance arising from electron cotunneling at filling factor $\nu=1$, which can coexist with quantized crossed Andreev reflection at $\nu=2$. A combination of numerical simulations and effective modelling reveals the role of spin-orbit coupling and stripe geometry in controlling these transitions. Our findings suggest new strategies for realizing and detecting topology in proximized quantum Hall devices.

Title: Strongly correlated altermagnet CaCrO$_3$
Authors: Zhenfeng Ouyang, Peng-Jie Guo, Rong-Qiang He, Zhong-Yi Lu
Abstract: Altermagnetism, a newly discovered magnetic phase, has spurred growing research activity. Studies from a perspective of dynamical electronic correlation still remain scarce. Employing density functional theory plus dynamical mean-field theory (DFT+DMFT) that incorporates dynamical electronic correlation, we demonstrate that CaCrO$_3$ is a strongly correlated altermagnet. Our DFT+DMFT calculations successfully reproduce the correlated metallic behavior of CaCrO$_3$ and quantitatively capture the incoherence state observed experimentally. We also identify that the altermagnetic CaCrO$_3$ is a Hund's metal with a non-Fermi liquid behavior. Moreover, we find that altermagnetism can induce flat bands, and these incipient flat bands are further promoted by the strong renormalization from Hundness, which drives a heavy-fermion behavior. Hence, we propose that Hund's metals provide an ideal platform for hosting novel strongly correlated altermagnetism. Our work will promote the study of strongly correlated altermagnetism physics.

Title: Ex Situ Fabrication of Superconducting Nanostructures for Low-Temperature STM
Authors: Adrian Greichgauer, Roozbeh Yazdanpanah, Alexey Taskin, Oliver Breunig, Yoichi Ando, Jens Brede
Abstract: Nanofabrication enables flexible experimental design but is often incompatible with scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/STS) due to the latter's stringent surface quality requirements. Here, we present a fabrication strategy that combines ex situ nanolithography with in situ ultrahigh-vacuum (UHV) cleaving to produce atomically clean, nanopatterned superconductor/topological insulator (TI) heterostructures suitable for high-resolution STM/STS. In our initial Design I, nanoribbons were defined by etching trenches into a TI film, followed by niobium capping and sample flipping before cleaving. This enabled STM/STS to be applied in large areas, although edge quality was limited by etch debris. To overcome this, we developed Design II, which avoids etching through the film by locally thinning it, leaving nanoscale ribbons raised above a continuous TI layer, followed again by Nb capping and sample flipping before cleaving. This method yields clean, reproducible nanostructures with well-defined superconducting gaps, demonstrating a reliable fabrication pathway for high-resolution STM/STS studies of nanoscale topological devices.

Title: Global $q$-dependent inverse transforms of intensity autocorrelation data
Authors: Tobias Eklund, Christina M. Tonauer, Felix Lehmkühler, Katrin Amann-Winkel
Abstract: We present a new analysis approach for intensity autocorrelation data, as measured with dynamic light scattering and X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy. Our analysis generalizes the established CONTIN and MULTIQ methods by direct nonlinear modeling of the $g_2$ function, enabling decomposition of complex dynamics without a priori knowledge of experimental scaling factors. We describe the mathematical formulation, implementation details, and strategies for solution, as well as demonstrate decompositions of soft matter dynamics data into distributions of diffusion rates/velocities. The open-source MATLAB implementation, including example data, is publicly available for adoption and further development.

Title: Fast charge noise sensing using a spectator valley state in a singlet-triplet qubit
Authors: David W. Kanaar, Yasuo Oda, Mark F. Gyure, J. P. Kestner
Abstract: Semiconductor spin qubits are a promising platform for quantum computing but remain vulnerable to charge noise. Accurate, in situ measurement of charge noise could enable closed-loop control and improve qubit performance. Here, we propose a method for real-time detection of charge noise using a silicon singlet-triplet qubit with one electron initialized in an excited valley state. This valley excitation acts as a spectator degree of freedom, coupled to a high-quality resonator via the exchange interaction, which is sensitive to charge-noise-induced voltage fluctuations. Dispersive readout of the resonator enables a continuous, classical measurement of exchange fluctuations during qubit operation. Signal-to-noise analysis shows that, under realistic device parameters, sub-microsecond measurement times are possible using a quantum-limited amplifier. Even without such an amplifier, sub-millisecond performance is achievable with appropriately engineered resonator parameters. This approach allows the probe to monitor slow drift in exchange in real time, opening the door to feedback and feedforward strategies for maintaining high-fidelity quantum operations. Importantly, the protocol preserves spin coherence and can be run concurrently with qubit logic gates.

Title: Spatiotemporal Order and Parametric Instabilities from First-Principles
Authors: Daniel Kaplan, Pavel A. Volkov, Jennifer Coulter, Shiwei Zhang, Premala Chandra
Abstract: Shaping crystal structure with light is an enduring goal of physics and materials engineering. Here we present calculations in candidate materials selected by symmetry that allow light-induced spatiotemporal parametric instabilities. We demonstrate a theoretical framework that includes a complete symmetry analysis of phonon modes that contribute to parametric instabilities across all non-centrosymmetric point groups, a detailed survey of the materials landscape and finally the computation of nonlinear couplings from first principles. We then showcase detailed results for chiral crystals, ferroelectrics, and layered van der Waals materials. Our results pave the way towards realizing designer time-crystalline order in quantum materials, detectable with time-resolved diffractive probes.

Title: Anyonic analogue of optical Mach-Zehnder interferometer
Authors: Navketan Batra, Zezhu Wei, Smitha Vishweshwara, D. E. Feldman
Abstract: Anyonic interferometry is a direct probe of fractional statistics. We propose an interferometry geometry that parallels an optical Mach-Zehnder interferometer and offers several advantages over existing interferometry schemes. In contrast to the currently studied electronic Mach-Zehnder interferometer, our setup has no drain inside the device so that the trapped topological charge is time-independent. In contrast to electronic Fabry-Pérot interferometry, anyons cannot go around the device more than once. Thus, the interference signal has a straightforward interpretation in terms of anyonic statistical phases. The proposed geometry suppresses the undesirable effects of bulk-edge coupling. Moreover, the setup allows for simple exact solutions for the electric current and noise for an arbitrary quasiparticle tunneling strength in a broad range of conditions. The structure of the solutions is similar to that for non-interacting electrons but reflects fractional charge and statistics. We present results for electric current and noise in Jain states and address thermal interferometry at zero voltage bias.

Title: Design framework for programmable three-dimensional woven metamaterials
Authors: Molly Carton, James Utama Surjadi, Bastien F.G. Aymon, Carlos M. Portela
Abstract: Mechanical metamaterials have continued to offer unprecedented tunability in mechanical properties, but most designs to date have prioritized attaining high stiffness and strength while sacrificing deformability. The emergence of woven lattices-three-dimensional networks of entangled fibers-has introduced a pathway to the largely overlooked compliant and stretchable regime of metamaterials. However, the design and implementation of these complex architectures has remained a primarily manual process, restricting identification and validation of their full achievable design and property space. Here, we present a geometric design framework that encodes woven topology using a graph structure, enabling the creation of woven lattices with tunable architectures, functional gradients, and arbitrary heterogeneity. Through use of microscale in situ tension experiments and computational mechanics models, we reveal highly tunable anisotropic stiffness (varying by over an order of magnitude) and extreme stretchability (up to a stretch of four) within the design space produced by the framework. Moreover, we demonstrate the ability of woven metamaterials to exhibit programmable failure patterns by leveraging tunability in the design process. This framework provides a design and modeling toolbox to access this previously unattainable high-compliance regime of mechanical metamaterials, enabling programmable large-deformation, nonlinear responses.

Title: Learning the non-Markovian features of subsystem dynamics
Authors: Michele Coppola, Mari Carmen Bañuls, Zala Lenarčič
Abstract: The dynamics of local observables in a quantum many-body system can be formally described in the language of open systems. The problem is that the bath representing the complement of the local subsystem generally does not allow the common simplifications often crucial for such a framework. Leveraging tensor network calculations and optimization tools from machine learning, we extract and characterize the dynamical maps for single- and two-site subsystems embedded in an infinite quantum Ising chain after a global quench. We consider three paradigmatic regimes: integrable critical, integrable non-critical, and chaotic. For each we find the optimal time-local representation of the subsystem dynamics at different times. We explore the properties of the learned time-dependent Liouvillians and whether they can be used to forecast the long-time dynamics of local observables beyond the times accessible through direct quantum many-body numerical simulation. Our procedure naturally suggests a novel measure of non-Markovianity based on the distance between the quasi-exact dynamical map and the closest CP-divisible form and reveals that criticality leads to the closest Markovian representation at large times.

Title: Schrödinger equation with Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonian and double well potential as model of vibrationally enhanced tunneling for proton transfer in hydrogen bond
Authors: A.E. Sitnitsky
Abstract: A solution of the two-dimensional Schrödinger equation with Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonian and trigonometric double-well potential is obtained within the framework of the first-order of adiabatic approximation. The case of vibrational strong coupling is considered which is pertinent for polariton chemistry and (presumably) for enzymatic hydrogen transfer. We exemplify the application of the solution by calculating the proton transfer rate constant in the hydrogen bond of the Zundel ion ${\rm{H_5O_2^{+}}}$ (oxonium hydrate) within the framework of the Weiner's theory. An analytic formula is derived which provides the calculation of the proton transfer rate with the help of elements implemented in {\sl {Mathematica}}. The parameters of the model for the Zundel ion are extracted from the literature data on IR spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations. The approach yields a vivid manifestation of the phenomenon of vibrationally enhanced tunneling, i.e., a sharp bell-shaped peak of the rate enhancement by the external vibration at its symmetric coupling to the proton coordinate. The results obtained testify that the effect of resonant activation in our model is robust and stable to variations in the types of the quadratically coupled mode (vibrational strong coupling or symmetric one).

Title: Learning mixed quantum states in large-scale experiments
Authors: Matteo Votto, Marko Ljubotina, Cécilia Lancien, J. Ignacio Cirac, Peter Zoller, Maksym Serbyn, Lorenzo Piroli, Benoît Vermersch
Abstract: We present and test a protocol to learn the matrix-product operator (MPO) representation of an experimentally prepared quantum state. The protocol takes as an input classical shadows corresponding to local randomized measurements, and outputs the tensors of a MPO which maximizes a suitably-defined fidelity with the experimental state. The tensor optimization is carried out sequentially, similarly to the well-known density matrix renormalization group algorithm. Our approach is provably efficient under certain technical conditions which are expected to be met in short-range correlated states and in typical noisy experimental settings. Under the same conditions, we also provide an efficient scheme to estimate fidelities between the learned and the experimental states. We experimentally demonstrate our protocol by learning entangled quantum states of up to $N = 96$ qubits in a superconducting quantum processor. Our method upgrades classical shadows to large-scale quantum computation and simulation experiments.

Title: Physics-guided impact localisation and force estimation in composite plates with uncertainty quantification
Authors: Dong Xiao, Zahra Sharif-Khodaei, M. H. Aliabadi
Abstract: Physics-guided approaches offer a promising path toward accurate and generalisable impact identification in composite structures, especially when experimental data are sparse. This paper presents a hybrid framework for impact localisation and force estimation in composite plates, combining a data-driven implementation of First-Order Shear Deformation Theory (FSDT) with machine learning and uncertainty quantification. The structural configuration and material properties are inferred from dispersion relations, while boundary conditions are identified via modal characteristics to construct a low-fidelity but physically consistent FSDT model. This model enables physics-informed data augmentation for extrapolative localisation using supervised learning. Simultaneously, an adaptive regularisation scheme derived from the same model improves the robustness of impact force reconstruction. The framework also accounts for uncertainty by propagating localisation uncertainty through the force estimation process, producing probabilistic outputs. Validation on composite plate experiments confirms the framework's accuracy, robustness, and efficiency in reducing dependence on large training datasets. The proposed method offers a scalable and transferable solution for impact monitoring and structural health management in composite aerostructures.

Title: Two-photon coupling via Josephson element II: Interaction renormalizations and cross-Kerr coupling
Authors: Eugene V. Stolyarov, V. L. Andriichuk, Andrii M. Sokolov
Abstract: We study the interactions mediated by symmetric superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID), their renormalizations, and applicability of the anharmonic oscillator model for a coupled phase qubit. The coupling SQUID can switch between single- or two-photon interaction in situ. We consider a coupled resonator and an rf SQUID. The latter dwells in the vicinity of its metastable well holding a number of anharmonic energy states and acts as an artificial atom known as the phase qubit. Apart from the linear and two-photon couplings, interactions of optomechanical type and a cross-Kerr coupling arise. Near the two-photon resonance, we calculate the renormalizations due to nonresonant interactions, which are more prominent with the higher Josephson energy of the coupler. We interpret the renormalizations by depicting some of the virtual processes involved. That also allows us to determine the minimal amount of metastable states in the phase qubit for the renormalization formulas to hold.

Title: Free Fermion Dynamics with Measurements: Topological Classification and Adaptive Preparation of Topological States
Authors: Asadullah Bhuiyan, Haining Pan, Chao-Ming Jian
Abstract: We develop a general framework for classifying fermionic dynamical systems with measurements using symmetry and topology. We discuss two complementary classification schemes based on the Altland-Zirnbauer tenfold way: (1) the many-body evolution operator (mEO) symmetry class, which classifies fermionic dynamics at the many-body level and generalizes to interacting dynamics, and (2) the single-particle transfer matrix (sTM) symmetry class, which classifies free-fermion dynamics at the single-particle level and connects to Anderson localization physics. In the free-fermion limit, these two frameworks are in one-to-one correspondence and yield equivalent topological classifications of area-law entangled dynamical phases. This leads to a novel dynamical bulk-boundary correspondence: the topology of the dynamical system's spacetime \textit{bulk} determines the topology of the area-law entangled steady-state ensemble living on its temporal \textit{boundary}. Building on this correspondence, we provide a general realization of topological dynamical phases using Gaussian adaptive circuits. They are designed to prepare and stabilize free-fermion topological states as their steady states in \textit{any} spatial dimension. While circuits with exponentially local operations can stabilize a single topological steady state, those with finite-range operations can reach a topological steady-state ensemble. As a demonstration, we explicitly construct and simulate 2+1d adaptive circuits that realize mEO-class-A topological dynamics. We show that the finite-range versions converge to an ensemble of Chern insulators in $\mathcal{O}(1)$ circuit depth. We numerically study the topological phase transitions and dynamical domain-wall modes between different topological dynamical phases in this symmetry class. We also analyze the robustness of our adaptive circuit protocol to coherent noise.

Title: Emergent cavity-QED dynamics along the edge of a photonic lattice
Authors: Enrico Di Benedetto, Xuejian Sun, Marcel A. Pinto, Luca Leonforte, Chih-Ying Chang, Vincent Jouanny, Léo Peyruchat, Pasquale Scarlino, Francesco Ciccarello
Abstract: We investigate qubits coupled to the boundary of a two dimensional photonic lattice that supports dispersionless edge modes, unlike conventional edge modes that sustain propagating photons. As a case study, we consider a honeycomb lattice (photonic graphene) of coupled resonators with a zigzag edge, where the edge modes form a flat band defined only over a restricted region of momentum space. We show that light matter interactions are effectively captured by a dissipative cavity QED model, wherein the emitter coherently couples to a fictitious cavity mode emerging as a superposition of edge modes. This mode has support on only one sublattice and, most notably, displays an unconventional power law localization around the qubit, yet remaining normalizable in the thermodynamic limit, with a spatial range that can be tuned by introducing lattice anisotropy We predict occurrence of vacuum Rabi oscillations and efficient state transfer between distant emitters. An experimental demonstration using superconducting circuits is proposed.

Title: Growing Sparse Quantum Codes from a Seed
Authors: ChunJun Cao, Brad Lackey
Abstract: It is generally unclear whether smaller codes can be "concatenated" to systematically create quantum LDPC codes or their sparse subsystem code cousins where the degree of the Tanner graph remains bounded while increasing the code distance. In this work, we use a slight generalization of concatenation called conjoining introduced by the quantum lego formalism. We show that by conjoining only quantum repetition codes, one can construct quantum LDPC codes. More generally, we provide an efficient iterative algorithm for constructing sparse subsystem codes with a distance guarantee that asymptotically saturates $kd^2=O(n)$ in the worst case. Furthermore, we show that the conjoining of even just two-qubit quantum bit-flip and phase-flip repetition codes is quite powerful as they can create any CSS code. Therefore, more creative combinations of these basic code blocks will be sufficient for generating good quantum codes, including good quantum LDPC codes.

Abstract: We present a version of a strongly correlated 2+1-dimensional condensed matter system that features a thermal phase transition between a semimetal and an insulator through a semi-Dirac quantum critical region using AdS/CFT holography. We introduce backreaction into the bulk equations of motion to measure transport coefficients in the boundary; specifically the shear viscosity $\eta$. By explicitly breaking rotational symmetry we find a new instance of violation of the KSS-bound for the $\eta/s$ ratio in the quantum critical region, as well as a monotone dependence on temperature in the $T\to 0$ regime fixed by a Lifshitz dynamical critical exponent. We find that the Lifshitz critical exponent in the anisotropic direction is approximately equal to $2$ for our choice of backreaction parameters. We find explicit $T=0$ solutions separated by a quantum critical point in parameter space, showing that the thermal critical phase found in previous work comes from a quantum phase transition at zero temperature.

Title: SparseC-AFM: a deep learning method for fast and accurate characterization of MoS$_2$ with C-AFM
Authors: Levi Harris, Md Jayed Hossain, Mufan Qiu, Ruichen Zhang, Pingchuan Ma, Tianlong Chen, Jiaqi Gu, Seth Ariel Tongay, Umberto Celano
Abstract: The increasing use of two-dimensional (2D) materials in nanoelectronics demands robust metrology techniques for electrical characterization, especially for large-scale production. While atomic force microscopy (AFM) techniques like conductive AFM (C-AFM) offer high accuracy, they suffer from slow data acquisition speeds due to the raster scanning process. To address this, we introduce SparseC-AFM, a deep learning model that rapidly and accurately reconstructs conductivity maps of 2D materials like MoS$_2$ from sparse C-AFM scans. Our approach is robust across various scanning modes, substrates, and experimental conditions. We report a comparison between (a) classic flow implementation, where a high pixel density C-AFM image (e.g., 15 minutes to collect) is manually parsed to extract relevant material parameters, and (b) our SparseC-AFM method, which achieves the same operation using data that requires substantially less acquisition time (e.g., under 5 minutes). SparseC-AFM enables efficient extraction of critical material parameters in MoS$_2$, including film coverage, defect density, and identification of crystalline island boundaries, edges, and cracks. We achieve over 11x reduction in acquisition time compared to manual extraction from a full-resolution C-AFM image. Moreover, we demonstrate that our model-predicted samples exhibit remarkably similar electrical properties to full-resolution data gathered using classic-flow scanning. This work represents a significant step toward translating AI-assisted 2D material characterization from laboratory research to industrial fabrication.

Title: An indirect correlation of dielectric properties using optical trapping and dielectric resonance in two different frequency regimes
Authors: Somaditya Sen
Abstract: Dielectric permittivity, $\varepsilon_r$, of materials are often limited to a sub-GHz range using normal LCR meters. In the GHz range the $\varepsilon_r$ can be measured using Vector Network Analyzers and measurement jigs (waveguides) which are specific for different frequency regimes. Hence, to measure er for the entire frequency range one needs several components and is an extremely costly experiment. However, for applications such as Dielectric Resonator Antennas one need to know the er and the dielectric loss to estimate the resonant frequency. An indirect method is proposed in this letter to find the er from Transversely Misaligned Dual-Fiber Optical Trapping at the optical frequency range to approximately estimate {\epsilon}r and thereby understand the correlation between these two regimes of frequency responses.

Title: Enhanced image classification via hybridizing quantum dynamics with classical neural networks
Authors: Ruiyang Zhou, Saubhik Sarkar, Sougato Bose, Abolfazl Bayat
Abstract: The integration of quantum computing and machine learning has emerged as a promising frontier in computational science. We present a hybrid protocol which combines classical neural networks with non-equilibrium dynamics of a quantum many-body system for image classification. This architecture leverages classical neural networks to efficiently process high-dimensional data and encode it effectively on a quantum many-body system, overcoming a challenging task towards scaled up quantum computation. The quantum module further capitalizes on the discriminative properties of many-body quantum dynamics to enhance classification accuracy. By mapping images from distinct classes to nearly-orthogonal quantum states, the system maximizes separability in the Hilbert space, enabling robust classification. We evaluate the performance of our model on several benchmark datasets with various number of features and classes. Moreover, we demonstrate the key role of the quantum module in achieving high classification accuracy which cannot be accomplished by the classical neural network alone. This showcases the potential of our hybrid protocol for achieving practical quantum advantage and paves the way for future advancements in quantum-enhanced computational techniques.

Title: Splitting of the three-body Förster resonance in Rb Rydberg atoms as a measure of dipole-dipole interaction strength
Authors: I.I.Ryabtsev, I.N.Ashkarin, I.I.Beterov, D.B.Tretyakov, E.A.Yakshina, V.M.Entin, P.Cheinet
Abstract: Three-body Förster resonances controlled by a dc electric field are of interest for the implementation of three-qubit quantum gates with single atoms in optical traps using their laser excitation into strongly interacting Rydberg states. In our recent theoretical paper [Zh. Eksper. Teor. Fiz. 168(1), 14 (2025)] it was found that the proposed earlier three-body Förster resonance $3\times nP_{3/2} \to nS_{1/2} +(n+1)S_{1/2} +nP_{1/2} $ in Rb Rydberg atoms has a splitting, with one of the split components having weaker dependence of the resonant electric field (and the corresponding dynamic shift) on the distance $R$ between the atoms. Here we study this effect in more detail, since such a resonance is the most suitable for performing experiments on observing coherent oscillations of populations of collective three-body states and implementing three-qubit quantum gates based on them. For a linear spatial configuration of three interacting Rydberg atoms, the physical mechanism of this phenomenon is revealed and analytical formulas are obtained that describe the behavior of split structure of the Förster resonance depending on $R$. It is found that the splitting is a measure of the energy of the resonant dipole-dipole exchange interaction with an excitation hopping between neighboring Rydberg states $S$ and $P$.

Title: Fast computational deep thermalization
Authors: Shantanav Chakraborty, Soonwon Choi, Soumik Ghosh, Tudor Giurgică-Tiron
Abstract: Deep thermalization refers to the emergence of Haar-like randomness from quantum systems upon partial measurements. As a generalization of quantum thermalization, it is often associated with high complexity and entanglement. Here, we introduce computational deep thermalization and construct the fastest possible dynamics exhibiting it at infinite effective temperature. Our circuit dynamics produce quantum states with low entanglement in polylogarithmic depth that are indistinguishable from Haar random states to any computationally bounded observer. Importantly, the observer is allowed to request many copies of the same residual state obtained from partial projective measurements on the state -- this condition is beyond the standard settings of quantum pseudorandomness, but natural for deep thermalization. In cryptographic terms, these states are pseudorandom, pseudoentangled, and crucially, retain these properties under local measurements. Our results demonstrate a new form of computational thermalization, where thermal-like behavior arises from structured quantum states endowed with cryptographic properties, instead of from highly unstructured ensembles. The low resource complexity of preparing these states suggests scalable simulations of deep thermalization using quantum computers. Our work also motivates the study of computational quantum pseudorandomness beyond BQP observers.

Title: A machine learning based approach to the identification of spectral densities in quantum open systems
Authors: Jessica Barr, Shreyasi Mukherjee, Alessandro Ferraro, Mauro Paternostro, Giorgio Zicari
Abstract: We present a machine learning-based approach for characterising the environment that affects the dynamics of an open quantum system. We focus on the case of an exactly solvable spin-boson model, where the system-environment interaction, whose strength is encoded in the spectral density, induces pure dephasing. By using artificial neural networks trained on the Fourier-transformed time evolution of some observables of the system, we perform both classification -- distinguishing sub-Ohmic, Ohmic, and super-Ohmic spectral densities -- and regression -- thus estimating key parameters of the spectral density function, when the latter is expressed through a power law. Our results demonstrate high classification accuracy and robust parameter estimation, highlighting the potential of machine learning as a powerful tool for probing environmental features in quantum systems and advancing quantum noise spectroscopy.

Title: Room-Temperature Surface Exciton Polaritons in Colloidal J-Aggregate Flakes
Authors: Carla Estévez-Varela, José Nuno Gama, Miguel Castillo, Adelaide Miranda, Pieter De Beule, Jorge Pérez-Juste, Martin Lopez-Garcia, Isabel Pastoriza-Santos, Sara Núñez-Sánchez
Abstract: J-aggregates are promising organic materials for nanophotonic applications due to their excitonic properties and ability to support surface exciton polaritons at room temperature, providing a robust platform for nanoscale light manipulation. While thin films composed of J-aggregates have demonstrated these advantages, colloidal J-aggregate nanoparticles remain underexplored. Herein, we report the synthesis of colloidal J-aggregate flakes by electrostatic interaction of cyanine molecules (TDBC) and oppositely charged polyelectrolytes (polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride, PDDA). These flakes exhibit colloidal stability maintaining the J-aggregate conformation even in solvents that favoured their monomeric state. The characterization of the colloidal J-aggregate flakes reveals their capability to support surface exciton polaritons at room temperature. This was further confirmed at single-particle level by observing an angular-independent Reststrahlen band near the excitonic resonance. In addition, the colloidal flakes exhibit a strong scattering component that broadens the extinction band and redshifts the photoluminescence, indicating that the colloidal architecture influences the optical response. These findings introduce a versatile colloidal system for constructing excitonic nanostructures tailored for advanced photonic applications.

Title: Modulated Poisson-Dirichlet diffusions arising from inclusion processes with a slow phase
Authors: Simon Gabriel
Abstract: We study mean-field inclusion processes with an additional slow phase, in which particle interactions occur at a vanishing rate proportional to the inverse system size. In the thermodynamic limit, such systems exhibit condensation at high particle density, forming clusters of diverging size. Our main result provides convergence in law of inclusion processes to a novel two-component infinite-dimensional stochastic diffusion, describing the co-evolution of the solid condensed and microscopic fluid phase. In particular, we establish non-trivial mass exchange between the two phases. The resulting scaling limit extends the Poisson-Dirichlet diffusion (Ethier and Kurtz, 1981), introducing an additional control process that modulates its parameters. Our result builds on classical estimates of generator differences, which in this setting yield non-vanishing deterministic error bounds. We provide the missing probabilistic ingredient by showing instantaneous condensation, with particle clusters concentrating on a vanishing volume fraction immediately. We further establish the well-posedness of the limiting dynamics generally as Feller processes on a compact state space.

Title: On-the-Fly Fine-Tuning of Foundational Neural Network Potentials: A Bayesian Neural Network Approach
Authors: Tim Rensmeyer, Denis Kramer, Oliver Niggemann
Abstract: Due to the computational complexity of evaluating interatomic forces from first principles, the creation of interatomic machine learning force fields has become a highly active field of research. However, the generation of training datasets of sufficient size and sample diversity itself comes with a computational burden that can make this approach impractical for modeling rare events or systems with a large configuration space. Fine-tuning foundation models that have been pre-trained on large-scale material or molecular databases offers a promising opportunity to reduce the amount of training data necessary to reach a desired level of accuracy. However, even if this approach requires less training data overall, creating a suitable training dataset can still be a very challenging problem, especially for systems with rare events and for end-users who don't have an extensive background in machine learning. In on-the-fly learning, the creation of a training dataset can be largely automated by using model uncertainty during the simulation to decide if the model is accurate enough or if a structure should be recalculated with classical methods and used to update the model. A key challenge for applying this form of active learning to the fine-tuning of foundation models is how to assess the uncertainty of those models during the fine-tuning process, even though most foundation models lack any form of uncertainty quantification. In this paper, we overcome this challenge by introducing a fine-tuning approach based on Bayesian neural network methods and a subsequent on-the-fly workflow that automatically fine-tunes the model while maintaining a pre-specified accuracy and can detect rare events such as transition states and sample them at an increased rate relative to their occurrence.

Title: Quantifying mixed-state entanglement via partial transpose and realignment moments
Authors: Poetri Sonya Tarabunga, Tobias Haug
Abstract: Entanglement plays a crucial role in quantum information science and many-body physics, yet quantifying it in mixed quantum many-body systems has remained a notoriously difficult problem. Here, we introduce families of quantitative entanglement witnesses, constructed from partial transpose and realignment moments, which provide rigorous bounds on entanglement monotones. Our witnesses can be efficiently measured using SWAP tests or variants of Bell measurements, thus making them directly implementable on current hardware. Leveraging our witnesses, we present several novel results on entanglement properties of mixed states, both in quantum information and many-body physics. We develop efficient algorithms to test whether mixed states with bounded entropy have low or high entanglement, which previously was only possible for pure states. We also provide an efficient algorithm to test the Schmidt rank using only two-copy measurements, and to test the operator Schmidt rank using four-copy measurements. Further, our witnesses enable robust certification of quantum circuit depth even in the presence of noise, a task which so far has been limited to noiseless circuits only. Finally, we show that the entanglement phase diagram of Haar random states, quantified by the partial transpose negativity, can be fully established solely by computing our witness, a result that also applies to any state 4-design. Our witnesses can also be efficiently computed for matrix product states, thus enabling the characterization of entanglement in extensive many-body systems. Finally, we make progress on the entanglement required for quantum cryptography, establishing rigorous limits on pseudoentanglement and pseudorandom density matrices with bounded entropy. Our work opens new avenues for quantifying entanglement in large and noisy quantum systems.

Title: Nonequilibrium steady states in multi-bath quantum collision models
Authors: Ronan McElvogue, Andrew K. Mitchell, Gabriel T. Landi, Steve Campbell
Abstract: Collision models provide a simple and versatile setting to capture the dynamics of open quantum systems. The standard approach to thermalisition in this setting involves an environment of independent and identically-prepared thermal qubits, interacting sequentially for a finite duration $\Delta t$ with the system. We compare this to a two-bath scenario in which collisional qubits are prepared in either their ground or excited states and the environment temperature is encoded in system-environment couplings. The system reaches the same thermal steady state for both settings as $\Delta t\to 0$, although even in this limit they describe fundamentally different physical processes, with the two-bath setup yielding a nonequilibrium state with finite heat currents. Non-Markovian dynamics arise when intra-environment interactions in either setting are introduced. Here, the system in the single-bath setup again reaches a steady state at the canonical temperature of the bath, but the nonequilibrium steady state of the two-bath setup tends to a different temperature due to the generation of strong system-environment and intra-environment correlations. The two-bath setting is particularly suited to studying quantum trajectories, which are well-defined also for the non-Markovian case. We showcase this with a trajectory analysis of the heat currents within a two-point measurement scheme. Our results provide insights into the dynamics and thermodynamics of thermalisation towards nonequilibrium steady states and the role of non-Markovian interactions.

Title: Role of quantum state texture in probing resource theories and quantum phase transition
Authors: Ayan Patra, Tanoy Kanti Konar, Pritam Halder, Aditi Sen De
Abstract: Building on the recently developed quantum state texture resource theory, we exhibit that the difference between maximum and minimum textures is a valid purity monotone in any dimension and provide a lower bound for existing purity measures. We introduce a texture-based resource monotone applicable across general convex resource theories, encompassing quantum coherence, non-stabilizerness, and entanglement. In particular, we propose the notion of non-local texture, which corresponds to the geometric measure of bipartite and multipartite entanglement in pure states. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the texture of the entire ground state or its subsystems can effectively signal quantum phase transitions in the Ising chain under both transverse and longitudinal magnetic fields, offering a powerful tool for characterizing quantum criticality.

Title: Magnetic monopoles with an internal degree of freedom
Authors: Petr Beneš, Filip Blaschke
Abstract: We consider a class of spontaneously broken $SU(2)$ gauge theories with adjoint scalar and look for exact magnetic monopole solutions in the Bogomol'nyi--Prasad--Sommerfield (BPS) limit. We find that some of the resulting solutions exhibit a new internal degree of freedom (a moduli space parameter) that controls the energy density profile of the monopole while keeping the total energy (mass) constant.

Title: Jordanian spin chains for twisted strings in $AdS_5\times S^5$
Authors: Sibylle Driezen, Adrien Molines
Abstract: We study the integrable spin chain formulation of Jordanian deformations of the $AdS_5\times S^5$ superstring, realised via Drinfel'd twists. Among these models, we first identify a unique supergravity deformation confined to an $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ sector and with constant dilaton. We then develop a general framework for closed Drinfel'd twisted spin chains and construct an explicit map to undeformed models with twisted-boundary conditions. Applied to the non compact $\mathrm{XXX}_{-1/2}$ spin chain, the Jordanian twist breaks the Cartan generator labelling magnon excitations, obstructing the standard Bethe methods. Instead, using the twisted-boundary formulation, we initiate the spectral problem based on a residual root generator both in the thermodynamic limit and for short chains. We find that the ground state is non-trivially deformed, and is in agreement with the classical string result, while our analysis does not capture higher-spin excited states. We also study the asymptotics of the associated $Q$-system, which is well-behaved and compatible with the boundary-twist. While a full understanding of the spectrum remains open, our work provides concrete steps toward a spectral description of non-abelian twisted integrable models.

Title: Efficient Variational Dynamics of Open Quantum Bosonic Systems via Automatic Differentiation
Authors: Jacopo Tosca, Francesco Carnazza, Luca Giacomelli, Cristiano Ciuti
Abstract: We introduce a scalable variational method for simulating the dynamics of interacting open quantum bosonic systems deep in the quantum regime. The method is based on a multi-dimensional Wigner phase-space representation and employs a Variational Multi-Gaussian (VMG) ansatz, whose accuracy is systematically controlled by the number of Gaussian components. The variational equations of motion are derived from the Dirac-Frenkel principle and evaluated efficiently by combining the analytical structure of Gaussian functions with automatic differentiation. As a key application, we study a driven-dissipative two-dimensional Bose-Hubbard lattice with two-boson coherent driving and two-body losses. Using our dynamical approach, we compute the finite-size scaling of the Liouvillian spectral gap - extracted from the relaxation dynamics - which vanishes in the thermodynamic limit. Our results reveal critical slowing down with dynamical exponents of the 2D quantum Ising universality class, demonstrating the power of our method to capture complex quantum dynamics in large open systems.

Title: Machine Learning-aided Optimal Control of a noisy qubit
Authors: Riccardo Cantone, Shreyasi Mukherjee, Luigi Giannelli, Elisabetta Paladino, Giuseppe Falci
Abstract: We apply a graybox machine-learning framework to model and control a qubit undergoing Markovian and non-Markovian dynamics from environmental noise. The approach combines physics-informed equations with a lightweight transformer neural network based on the self-attention mechanism. The model is trained on simulated data and learns an effective operator that predicts observables accurately, even in the presence of memory effects. We benchmark both non-Gaussian random-telegraph noise and Gaussian Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise and achieve low prediction errors even in challenging noise coupling regimes. Using the model as a dynamics emulator, we perform gradient-based optimal control to identify pulse sequences implementing a universal set of single-qubit gates, achieving fidelities above 99% for the lowest considered value of the coupling and remaining above 90% for the highest.

Title: Do mixed states exhibit deep thermalisation?
Authors: Alan Sherry, Sthitadhi Roy
Abstract: The notion of $deep$ $thermalisation$, where ensembles of pure states on a local subsystem, conditioned on measurement outcomes on its complement, approach universal maximum-entropy ensembles constrained only by conservation laws, represents a stronger form of ergodicity than conventional thermalisation. We show that this framework fails dramatically for mixed initial states, evolved unitarily, even with infinitesimal initial mixedness. To address this, we introduce a new paradigm of deep thermalisation for mixed states, fundamentally distinct from that for pure-state ensembles. In our formulation, the deep thermal ensemble arises by tracing out auxiliary degrees of freedom from a maximum-entropy ensemble defined on an augmented system, with the ensemble structure depending explicitly on the entropy of the initial state. We demonstrate that such ensembles emerge dynamically in generic, locally interacting chaotic systems. For the self-dual kicked Ising chain, which we show to be exactly solvable for a class of mixed initial states, we find exact emergence of the so-defined mixed-state deep thermal ensemble at finite times. Our results therefore lead to fundamental insights into how maximum entropy principles and deep thermalisation manifest themselves in unitary dynamics of states with finite entropy.

Title: Design of superparamagnetic nanoparticle-materials for high-frequency inductor cores
Authors: Mathias Zambach, Ziwei Ouyang, Matti Knaapila, Marco Beleggia, Cathrine Frandsen
Abstract: The progress in the semiconductor industry has resulted in great demand for high-frequency magnetic materials applicable in microfabricated inductor cores. Nanocomposite materials, containing magnetic nanoparticles in a non-conducting matrix, may provide a solution for materials with high susceptibility or permeability and low power loss in the MHz regime, where traditional ferrites fail in performance. Here, we present a design guide for usage of magnetic nanoparticles in such materials. We use statistical mechanics methods to derive the magnetic susceptibility of nanoparticles in case of uniaxial or cubic anisotropy, as function of particle size and applied field direction, and investigate shape and interaction effects on the susceptibility. Using the derived susceptibilities, with inductor-core applications in mind, we show that close-to-spherical particles of materials with high saturation magnetization and low magnetic anisotropy, such as FeNi$_3$, are optimal. Additionally, the particle size shall be optimized to be as large as possible while maintaining superparamagnetic behaviour at the relevant frequency. Based on this, we predict that high particle susceptibilities of $>$700 (/$>$1500) are possible for randomly oriented (/uniaxially aligned) 20$\pm$1 nm diameter FeNi$_3$ particles, together with high-frequency stability, shown by low out-of-phase component at 2 MHz. This implies that materials containing nanoparticles have the potential to be tuned to outperform state-of-the-art ferrite inductor-core materials at MHz-frequencies.

Title: Quantitatively predicting angle-resolved polarized Raman intensity of anisotropic layered materials
Authors: Jia-Liang Xie, Tao Liu, Yu-Chen Leng, Rui Mei, Heng Wu, Chen-Kai Liu, Jia-Hong Wang, Yang Li, Xue-Feng Yu, Miao-Ling Lin, Ping-Heng Tan
Abstract: Angle-resolved polarized Raman (ARPR) spectroscopy provides insights into optical anisotropy and symmetry-related electron-photon/electron-phonon couplings of anisotropic layered materials (ALMs). However, since their discovery over ten years ago, ARPR responses in ALM flakes has exhibited a puzzling dependence on flake thickness, excitation wavelength, and dielectric environment, complicating their understanding and prediction. By taking black phosphorus (BP) (large than 20 nm) flakes and four-layer Td-WTe2 as examples, this study introduces intrinsic Raman tensors (Rint) and proposes strategies to predict the ARPR intensity profiles of thick and atomically-thin ALM flakes by considering birefringence, linear dichroism and multilayer interference inside multilayered structures with experimentally determined complex refractive indexes along in-plane axes and complex tensor elements of Rint for the corresponding phonon modes. The tensor elements of effective Raman tensors (Reff), which are directly linked to the polarization vectors of incident and scattered light outside the ALM surface, were derived to quantitatively predict ARPR intensity for these ALM flakes, showing intricate dependence on ALM thickness, dielectric substrates, and excitation wavelengths. This framework can be extended to other ALM flakes from atomically-thin layers to bulk limit, facilitating comprehensive prediction of their ARPR intensity regardless of layer-dependent electronic properties.

Title: Towards an exact electronic quantum many-body treatment of Kondo correlation in magnetic impurities
Authors: Tianyu Zhu, Linqing Peng, Huanchen Zhai, Zhi-Hao Cui, Runze Chi, Garnet Kin-Lic Chan
Abstract: The Kondo effect is a prototypical quantum phenomenon arising from the interaction between localized electrons in a magnetic impurity and itinerant electrons in a metallic host. Although it has served as the testing ground for quantum many-body methods for decades, the precise description of Kondo physics with material specificity remains challenging. Here, we present a systematic ab initio approach to converge towards an exact zero-temperature electronic treatment of Kondo correlations. Across a series of 3d transition metals, we extract Kondo temperatures matching the subtle experimental trends, with an accuracy exceeding that of standard models. We further obtain microscopic insight into the origin of these trends. More broadly, we demonstrate the possibility to start from fully ab initio many-body simulations and push towards the realm of converged predictions.

Title: Fingerprints of a charge ice state in the doped Mott insulator Nb$_3$Cl$_8$
Authors: Evgeny A. Stepanov
Abstract: The interplay between strong electronic correlations and the inherent frustration of certain lattice geometries is a common mechanism for the formation of nontrivial states of matter. In this work, we theoretically explore the collective electronic effects in the monolayer Nb$_3$Cl$_8$, a recently discovered triangular lattice Mott insulator. Our advanced many-body numerical simulations predict the emergence of a phase separation region upon doping this material. Notably, in close proximity to the phase separation, the static charge susceptibility undergoes a drastic change and reveals a distinctive bow-tie structure in momentum space. The appearance of such a fingerprint in the context of spin degrees of freedom would indicate the formation of a spin ice state. This finding allows us to associate the observed phase separation to a charge ice state, a state with a remarkable power law dependence of both the effective exchange interaction and correlations between electronic densities in real space.

Title: Hybridization of the amplitude mode in a confined fermionic superfluid
Authors: Cesar R. Cabrera, René Henke, Lukas Broers, Jim Skulte, H.P. Ojeda Collado, Hauke Biss, Ludwig Mathey, Henning Moritz
Abstract: In phase transitions, spontaneous symmetry breaking results in a non-zero order parameter and two collective excitations: the Goldstone and the amplitude mode. These modes, which define key properties of superconductors and fermionic superfluids, are well-understood in homogeneous systems. However, their behavior under strong confinement remains largely unexplored, particularly when their excitation energy becomes comparable to the imposed discrete level spacing. In this scenario, hybridization between different collective modes is expected to take place. Here, we show how the amplitude mode hybridizes with a spatial mode in a confined fermionic superfluid. Using lattice modulation spectroscopy, we observe the evolution of the mode throughout the entire crossover from the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) state to Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of molecules. In the BCS regime, the excitation energy is located at twice the pairing gap, then gradually becomes an in-gap excitation in the strongly correlated regime. Further to the BEC limit, the excitation energy approaches twice the level spacing. The spectral weight of this mode vanishes when approaching the superfluid critical temperature. Our experimental results are in excellent agreement with an effective field theory, providing strong evidence that amplitude oscillations hybridize with and eventually transform into breathing oscillations of the order parameter. The strong modification of the excitation spectrum reveals how confinement and finite-size effects impact fundamental modes of symmetry-broken states.

Title: SR-CLD: spatially-resolved chord length distributions for statistical description and visualization of non-uniform microstructures
Authors: Sheila E. Whitman, Marat I. Latypov
Abstract: This study introduces the calculation of spatially-resolved chord length distribution (SR-CLD) as an efficient approach for quantifying and visualizing non-uniform microstructures in heterogeneous materials. SR-CLD enables detailed analysis of spatial variation of microstructures in different directions that can be overlooked with traditional descriptions. We present the calculation of SR-CLD using efficient scan-line algorithm that counts pixels in constituents along pixel rows or columns of microstructure images for detailed, high-resolution SR-CLD maps. We demonstrate the application of SR-CLD in three case studies: on synthetic polycrystalline microstructures with known and intentionally created uniform and gradient spatial distributions of grain size; on non-uniform microstructures from welding simulations; and on experimental images of two-phase microstructures of additively manufactured Ti alloys with significant spatially non-uniform distributions of laths of one of the phases.

Title: Thermal cycling -- evidence for a generalized tunneling model and a tool to distinguish noise sources in quantum circuits
Authors: Yigal Reiss, Moshe Schechter
Abstract: Structural two level systems (TLSs) ubiquitous in amorphous solids are dramatically sensitive to thermal cycling to about $20$K and then back to low temperature, a process upon which the excitation energy of most TLSs is significantly changed. Using Monte Carlo simulations we demonstrate that this phenomenon is not contained within the standard tunneling model, but is well explained by a model that includes an additional set of TLSs that are pseudo-gapped at low energies, yet possess strong strain interaction through which they generate significant dynamical disorder upon thermal cycling. Our results provide additional support for the broad applicability of the Two-TLS model to amorphous solids at low temperatures, bringing us closer to a comprehensive understanding of the universal behavior of phonon attenuation in these materials. With regard to quantum superconducting circuits, our results suggest thermal cycling as a unique protocol to distinguish TLS noise from other noise sources. Possible relation of the Two-TLS model to ionizing radiation effects on long-time fluctuations in qubit relaxation times and on TLS scrambling is discussed.

Title: Deterministic many-body dynamics with multifractal response
Authors: Yusuf Kasim, Tomaž Prosen
Abstract: Dynamical systems can display a plethora of ergodic and ergodicity breaking behaviors, ranging from simple periodicity to ergodicity and chaos. Here we report an unusual type of non-ergodic behavior in a many-body discrete-time dynamical system, specifically a multi-periodic response with multi-fractal distribution of equilibrium spectral weights at all rational frequencies. This phenomenon is observed in the momentum-conserving variant of the newly introduced class of the so-called parity check reversible cellular automata, which we define with respect to an arbitrary bi-partite lattice. Although the models display strong fragmentation of phase space of configurations, we demonstrate that the effect qualitatively persists within individual fragmented sectors, and even individual typical many-body trajectories. We provide detailed numerical analysis of examples on 2D (honeycomb, square) and 3D (cubic) lattices.

Title: Kondo overscreening in the presence of superconductivity
Authors: Pradip Kattel, Abay Zhakenov, Natan Andrei
Abstract: We consider a model describing a system where the superconductivity competes with the overscreened Kondo effect. The model consists of a single spin$-\frac{1}{2}$ quantum impurity at the edge of a quantum wire where spin$-1$ bulk fermions interact attractively, generating a (superconducting) mass gap. The competition between the Kondo screening and the superconductivity leads to a rich phase structure. We find that for strong Kondo coupling, there is a regime of phase space where the Kondo phase is stable with the impurity \textit{overscreened} by a multiparticle Kondo effect, and a Kondo scale is dynamically generated. When the bulk and boundary interaction strength are comparable, we find that a midgap state appears in the spectrum and screens the impurity, while in the ground state, the impurity is unscreened. This midgap state is akin to the Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states that exist in the entire phase space in the BCS superconductor. Moreover, when the bulk superconducting interaction strength is stronger than the boundary Kondo interaction strength, the impurity can no longer be screened. Further, between the Kondo and YSR phases, we find a novel phase where, while the Kondo cloud overscreens the impurity, a boundary excitation exists that has vanishing energy in the thermodynamic limit. Similar phase diagrams that result from competition between different mechanisms were found for other models, too: the dissipative Kondo system, where dissipation competes with screening; the Kondo impurity coupled to spin-1/2 attractively interacting fermions where condensation competes with screening; and the XXX-Kondo model, where the lattice cutoff and the bulk spin interaction compete with screening.

Title: Controlling the Exchange Field of Surface Spin Impurities via DC Voltages
Authors: Xue Zhang, Jose Reina-Gálvez, Di'an Wu, Jan Martinek, Andreas J. Heinrich, Taeyoung Choi, Christoph Wolf
Abstract: Recent advances in scanning probe microscopy have demonstrated the quantum-coherent manipulation of individual spins on surfaces using oscillating AC voltages. At the same time, the role of the static voltage in such control schemes remains unclear. Here, we show how the static contribution can be utilized to control the resonance of electronic transitions via an effective exchange field model based on a non-equilibrium transport formalism. We demonstrate that the magnitude and direction of the exchange field can be tuned and turned off by changing the applied bias voltage. Furthermore, our model can accurately reproduce the observed resonance frequency shifts at different magnetic field geometries for two different spin $S=1/2$ adsorbates. This work enables fast and precise control of the quantum states of surface spins at the atomic scale which will aid in developing spin-based quantum technologies.

Abstract: Spherical Harmonic Gaussian type orbitals and Slater functions can be expressed using spherical coordinates or a linear combinations of the appropriate Cartesian functions. General expressions for the transformation coefficients between the two representations are provided. Values for the transformation coefficients are tabulated up to the quantum number $\ell = 10$. The formula is applied to construct the Hartree potential by an arbitrary-order multipole expansion.

Title: Collinear Altermagnets and their Landau Theories
Authors: Hana Schiff, Paul McClarty, Jeffrey G. Rau, Judit Romhanyi
Abstract: Altermagnets exhibit spontaneously spin-split electronic bands in the zero spin-orbit coupling (SOC) limit arising from the presence of collinear compensated magnetic order. The distinctive magneto-crystalline symmetries of altermagnets ensure that these spin splittings have a characteristic anisotropy in crystal momentum space. These systems have attracted a great deal of interest due to their potential for applications in spintronics. In this paper, we provide a general Landau theory that encompasses all three-dimensional altermagnets where the magnetic order does not enlarge the unit cell. We identify all crystal structures that admit altermagnetism and then reduce these to a relatively small set of distinct possible Landau theories governing such systems. In the zero SOC limit, we determine the possible local multipolar orders that are tied to the spin splitting of the band structure. We make precise the connection between altermagnetism as defined at zero SOC ("ideal" altermagnets) and the effects of weak SOC. In particular, we examine which response functions allowed by symmetry when SOC is present are guaranteed by the spin-orbit free theory, and spell out the distinctive properties of altermagnets in comparison with conventional collinear antiferromagnets. Finally, we show how these ideas can be applied by considering a number of altermagnetic candidate materials.

Title: Symmetry-enforced minimal entanglement and correlation in quantum spin chains
Authors: Kangle Li, Liujun Zou
Abstract: The interplay between symmetry, entanglement and correlation is an interesting and important topic in quantum many-body physics. Within the framework of matrix product states, in this paper we study the minimal entanglement and correlation enforced by the $SO(3)$ spin rotation symmetry and lattice translation symmetry in a quantum spin-$J$ chain, with $J$ a positive integer. When neither symmetry is spontaneously broken, for a sufficiently long segment in a sufficiently large closed chain, we find that the minimal Rényi-$\alpha$ entropy compatible with these symmetries is $\min\{ -\frac{2}{\alpha-1}\ln(\frac{1}{2^\alpha}({1+\frac{1}{(2J+1)^{\alpha-1}}})), 2\ln(J+1) \}$, for any $\alpha\in\mathbb{R}^+$. In an infinitely long open chain with such symmetries, for any $\alpha\in\mathbb{R}^+$ the minimal Rényi-$\alpha$ entropy of half of the system is $\min\{ -\frac{1}{\alpha-1}\ln(\frac{1}{2^\alpha}({1+\frac{1}{(2J+1)^{\alpha-1}}})), \ln(J+1) \}$. When $\alpha\rightarrow 1$, these lower bounds give the symmetry-enforced minimal von Neumann entropies in these setups. Moreover, we show that no state in a quantum spin-$J$ chain with these symmetries can have a vanishing correlation length. Interestingly, the states with the minimal entanglement may not be a state with the minimal correlation length.

Title: Evidence for spin liquid behavior in the frustrated three-dimensional $S = 1/2$ Heisenberg garnet NaCa$_{2}$Cu$_{2}$(VO$_{4}$)$_{3}$
Authors: Y. Alexanian, R. Kumar, H. Zeroual, B. Bernu, L. Mangin-Thro, J. R. Stewart, J. M. Wilkinson, S. Bhattacharya, P. L. Paulose, F. Bert, P. Mendels, B. Fåk, E. Kermarrec
Abstract: Three-dimensional quantum spin liquids have remained elusive, hindered by reduced quantum fluctuations from larger lattice connectivity inherent to high-dimensional systems. Here, we investigate the remarkable persistence of dynamical short-range magnetic correlations in the nearly body-centered cubic garnet NaCa$_{2}$Cu$_{2}$(VO$_{4}$)$_{3}$ down to $T = 50$ mK, two orders of magnitude below its Curie-Weiss temperature. Using a combination of neutron and muon spectroscopies plus numerical simulations, we demonstrate that a dynamical regime emerges, characterized by a dual response in the inelastic spectrum composed of short-live dispersive excitations and a quasi-elastic component. Strongly frustrated exchange interactions combined with subtle temperature-dependent Jahn-Teller spin-lattice effects are a plausible mechanism to explain the origin of this spin-liquid behavior.

Title: Demagnetisation effects in single-domain particles
Authors: Mathias Zambach, Miriam Varón, Mads R. Almind, Matti Knaapila, Ziwei Ouyang, Marco Beleggia, Cathrine Frandsen
Abstract: According to the classical laws of magnetism, the shape of magnetically soft objects limits the effective susceptibility. For example, spherical soft magnets cannot display an effective susceptibility larger than 3. Although true for macroscopic multi-domain magnetic materials, we explain why magnetic nanoparticles in a single-domain state do not suffer from this limitation. We show that the differences between demagnetisation factors along principal axes are relevant and can influence susceptibility for single-domain particles, but do not limit the susceptibility as in the case for multi-domain particles. We validate this result experimentally on spherical nanoparticles with varying diameter (8 to 150 nm) and varying volume fraction (0.1 to 47 vol%). In agreement with our predictions, we measure susceptibilities largely above 3, in fact up to more than 250, for single-domain particles. Moreover, contrary to an existing model, we find that the susceptibility of non-interacting single-domain particles in a non-magnetic matrix scales simply linearly with the volume fraction of particles.

Title: Thermodynamic Cost of Recurrent Erasure
Authors: Deepak Gupta, Kristian Stølevik Olsen, Supriya Krishnamurthy
Abstract: Recent experiments have implemented resetting by means of a time-varying external harmonic trap whereby the trap stiffness is changed from an initial to a final value in finite-time and then the system is reset when it relaxes to an equilibrium distribution in the final trap. Such setups are very similar to those studied in the context of the finite-time Landauer erasure principle. We analyze the thermodynamic costs of such a setup by deriving a moment generating function for the work cost of recurrently changing the trap stiffness in finite-time, thereby maintaining a non-equilibrium steady state. We analyze the mean and variance of the work required for a specific experimentally viable protocol and also obtain an optimal protocol which minimizes the mean cost. For both these procedures, our analysis captures both the large-time and short-time corrections. For the optimal protocol, we obtain a closed form expression for the mean cost for all protocol durations, thereby making contact with earlier work on geometric measures of dissipation-minimizing optimal protocols that implement information erasure.

Title: Anatomy of Spin Wave Polarization in Ferromagnets
Authors: Yutian Wang, Ruoban Ma, Jiang Xiao
Abstract: Spin waves in ferromagnetic materials are predominantly characterized by right-handed circular polarization due to symmetry breaking induced by net magnetization. However, magnetic interactions, including the external magnetic field, Heisenberg exchange, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, and dipole-dipole interaction, can modify this behavior, leading to elliptical polarization. This study provides a systematic analysis of these interactions and their influence on spin wave polarization, establishing principles to predict traits such as polarization degree and orientation based on equilibrium magnetization textures. The framework is applied to diverse magnetic configurations, including spin spirals, domain walls, and Skyrmions, offering a comprehensive yet simple approach to understanding polarization dynamics in ferromagnetic systems.

Title: $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Vortex Crystals and Topological Magnons in a Tetrahedral Antiferromagnet
Authors: Tomoki Hirosawa, Alexander Mook, Maria Azhar
Abstract: We report the formation of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ vortex crystal in the tetrahedral antiferromagnetic order on a triangular lattice. The noncoplanar tetrahedral state consists of four sublattices with spins oriented along the faces of a tetrahedron in spin space. The long-range order characterized by a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topology arises due to the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and appears at zero temperature and without external fields. Each vortex carries a half-integer topological charge relative to the noncoplanar tetrahedral state, enabling the emergence of anyonic excitations. Its magnetic excitations include magnetically active gyrotropic and breathing modes, which -- under an external magnetic field -- carry nontrivial Chern numbers that stabilize chiral magnon edge states.

Title: Renormalization group analysis of noisy neural field
Authors: Jie Zang, Pascal Helson, Shenquan Liu, Arvind Kumar, Dhrubaditya Mitra
Abstract: Neurons in the brain show great diversity in their individual properties and their connections to other neurons. To develop an understanding of how neuronal diversity contributes to brain dynamics and function at large scales we start with a linearized version of the Wilson-Kowan model and introduce a random anisotropy to inter-neuron connection. The resultant model is Edwards-Wilkinson model with a random anisotropic term. Averaging over the quenched randomness with the replica method we obtain a bi-quadratic nonlinearity. We use Wilsonian dynamic renormalization group to analyze this model. We find that, up to one loop order, for dimensions higher than two, the effect of the noise is to change dynamic exponent from two to one.

Title: Driving collective current excitations using light: The two-time $GW$ approach
Authors: Chin Shen Ong, Denis Golež, Angel Rubio, Olle Eriksson, Hugo U. R. Strand
Abstract: We identify a distinct transverse collective excitation, which we name the "curron", arising from current-current interactions in a driven quantum metal. Unlike plasmons, which involve longitudinal charge oscillations, currons are transverse current-density oscillations resulting from the interplay between the vector potential generated by the current and the external driving field. We demonstrate the emergence of this excitation in sodium metal by solving the Kadanoff-Baym equations on a complex time contour within the non-equilibrium two-time (TT) $GW$ formalism, marking, to our knowledge, the first TT-$GW$ calculation on a realistic material. We further show that two-time quantum memory effects leave measurable signatures: a pump-induced elevation in the baseline of the current-to-field response, potentially observable in polarization- and momentum-resolved conductivity experiments. By extracting effective resistive and memory coefficients from the TT-$GW$ dynamics, we introduce a generalized d'Alembert wave equation that captures the many-body damping and retardation inherent to driven quantum systems. These results establish current-current response functions as a platform to harness qualitatively new collective dynamics in correlated matter, opening new avenues for probing light-matter interactions beyond charge-density dynamics.

Title: Universality in many-body driven systems with an umbilic point
Authors: Johannes Schmidt, Žiga Krajnik, Vladislav Popkov
Abstract: We study stationary fluctuations of conserved slow modes in a two-lane model of hardcore particles which are expected to show universal behaviour. Specifically, we focus on the properties of fluctuations at a special umbilic point where the characteristic velocities coincide. At large space and time scales, fluctuations are described by a system of stochastic Burgers equations studied recently in [13]. Our data suggest coupling-dependent scaling functions and, even more surprisingly, coupling-dependent dynamical scaling exponents, distinct from KPZ scaling exponent typical for surface growth processes.

Title: Stationary-state dynamics of interacting phase oscillators in presence of noise and stochastic resetting
Authors: Anish Acharya, Mrinal Sarkar, Shamik Gupta
Abstract: We explore the impact of global resetting on Kuramoto-type models of coupled limit-cycle oscillators with distributed frequencies both in absence and presence of noise. The dynamics comprises repeated interruption of the bare dynamics at random times with simultaneous resetting of phases of all the oscillators to a predefined state. To characterize the stationary-state behavior, we develop an analytical framework that spans across different generalizations of the Kuramoto model involving either quenched or annealed disorder or both, and for any choice of the natural frequency distribution. The framework applies to the dynamics both in absence and presence of resetting, and is employed to obtain in particular the stationary-state synchronization order parameter of the system, which is a measure of spontaneous ordering among the oscillator phases. A key finding is the pivotal role of correlations in shaping the ordering dynamics under resettling.

Title: Electronic stopping cross sections of tungsten to swift ions and comparisons with models
Authors: Tiago F. Silva, Arilson Silva, Cleber L. Rodrigues, Nemitala Added, Manfredo H. Tabacniks, Flávio Matias, Helio Yoriyaz, Julian Shorto
Abstract: Accurate stopping power data for tungsten is crucial for ion beam analysis (IBA) techniques applied to fusion-related materials. In this work, we present new experimental measurements of the stopping power of tungsten for protons and alpha particles, addressing key gaps in fundamental databases. Our results provide a densely spaced dataset, refining the practical uncertainty limits to approximately 1.5% for protons and 2.0% for alpha particles. We critically compare our findings with semi-empirical and theoretical models, evaluating their performance in describing the stopping power of tungsten for light projectiles. By improving the accuracy and reliability of stopping power data, we contribute to the enhancement of the applicability of ion-beam methods for characterizing tungsten in fusion-related research. These findings contribute to the refinement of semi-empirical models and support the ongoing efforts to develop more precise theoretical frameworks for ion-solid interactions in high-Z materials.

Title: The thermodynamic uncertainty relation of a quantum-mechanically coupled two-qubit system
Authors: Kwang Hyun Cho, Hyukjoon Kwon, Changbong Hyeon
Abstract: The minimal bound of the thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR) is modulated from that of the classical counterpart ($\mathcal{Q}_{\rm min}=2$) when a quantumness is present in the dynamical process far from equilibrium. A recent study on a dissipative two-level system (TLS) subject to an external field indicates that quantum coherence can suppress the fluctuations of the irreversible current and loosens the TUR bound to $\mathcal{Q}_{\rm min}^{\rm TLS}\approx 1.25$. Here, we extend on the field-driven single TLS % in a photonic bath to a quantum-mechanically coupled two-qubit system (TQS), and explore how the quantum coupling between the two qubits, an additional complexity introduced to the probem of TLS, affects the photon current, fluctuations, and the TUR bound. We find that the TUR bound of TQS depends on the strength of coupling, such that $\mathcal{Q}_{\rm min}^{\rm TQS}=\mathcal{Q}_{\rm min}^{\rm TLS}\approx 1.25$ when the two qubits are effectively decoupled under weak coupling, whereas another loose bound $\mathcal{Q}_{\rm min}^{\rm TQS}\approx 1.36$ is identified for two strongly coupled qubits under strong fields. By contrasting the TQS against two coupled noisy oscillators, we illuminate the quantumness unique to the TQS and its effect on the TUR. Our findings from the study of TQS form the basis for understanding the TUR of more general $N$-qubit systems.

Title: Electron-Phonon Coupling in Correlated Metals: A Dynamical Mean-Field Theory Study
Authors: David J. Abramovitch, Jennifer Coulter, Sophie Beck, Andrew Millis
Abstract: Strong electron-electron interactions are known to significantly modify the electron-phonon coupling relative to the predictions of density functional theory, but this effect is challenging to calculate with realistic theories of strongly correlated materials. Here we define and calculate a version of the EPC applicable beyond band theory by combining first principles density functional theory plus dynamical mean-field theory with finite difference phonon perturbations, presenting results for several representative phonon modes in two materials of interest. In the three-orbital correlated metal SrVO$_3$, we find that intra-V-$t_{2g}$ band correlation significantly increases the coupling of these electrons to a Jahn-Teller phonon mode that splits the degenerate orbital energies, while slightly reducing the coupling associated with a breathing phonon that couples to the charge on each V atom. In the infinite layer cuprate CaCuO$_2$, we find that local correlation within the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital derived band has a modest effect on coupling of near-Fermi surface electrons to optical breathing modes. In both cases, the interaction correction to the electron-phonon coupling predicted by dynamical mean-field theory has a significant dependence on the electronic frequency, arising from a lattice-distortion dependence of the correlated electron dynamics, showing the inadequacy of the simple picture in which correlations change static local susceptibilities. We also show that the electron-phonon scattering and phonon lifetimes associated with these phonon modes are modified by the electronic correlation. Our findings shed light on the material- and mode-specific role of dynamical electronic correlation in electron-phonon coupling and highlight the importance of developing efficient computational methods for treating electron-phonon coupling in correlated materials.

Title: Atomistic Study of Radiation-Induced Ductile-to-Brittle Transition in Austenitic Steel
Authors: A. Ustrzycka, H. Mousavi, F. J. Dominguez-Gutierrez, S. Stupkiewicz
Abstract: Neutron irradiation in structural alloys promotes defect clustering, which suppresses plasticity and triggers a ductile-to-brittle transition (DBT), a key degradation mechanism limiting fracture resistance in nuclear materials. This study investigates the fracture mechanisms underlying this transition in irradiated Fe-Ni-Cr alloys. Using Molecular Dynamics simulations, we examine how different defect types influence crack propagation and energy dissipation mechanisms. The results reveal distinct roles of these defects: voids facilitate crack growth by reducing local cohesive energy, while dislocation loops act as barriers that impede crack advancement and redirect crack paths, significantly altering crack morphology. Building on the classical approach of separating fracture energy into brittle cleavage and plastic components, this study adapts the decomposition to irradiated materials. This framework quantifies the evolving contributions of surface energy and plastic work across increasing radiation damage levels, providing critical insight into how irradiation-induced defects govern fracture dynamics

Title: Space Group Symmetry of Chiral Fe-deficient van der Waals Magnet $\text{Fe}_{\text{3-x}}\text{GeTe}_{\text{2}}$ Probed by Convergent Beam Electron Diffraction

Abstract: Crystal structure symmetry of Fe-deficient $\text{Fe}_{\text{2.9}}\text{GeTe}_{\text{2}}$ at room temperature has been investigated by a combination of selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) and convergent-beam electron diffraction (CBED). By symmetry analysis of CBED patterns along different zone axis, the space group of $\text{Fe}_{\text{2.9}}\text{GeTe}_{\text{2}}$ at room-temperature has been identified as $P6_3mc$ (No.186), which derives from the high-symmetry parent system $\text{Fe}_{\text{3}}\text{GeTe}_{\text{2}}$ ($P6_3/mmc$) by breaking the mirror symmetry along the six-fold rotation axis. The $P3m1$ (No.156) space group previously reported for $\text{Fe}_{\text{2.9}}\text{GeTe}_{\text{2}}$ is a subgroup of $P6_3mc$ suggesting further possible symmetry breaks in this non-stochiometric system.

Title: Low-temperature anomalies in one-dimensional exactly solvable fluids
Authors: Igor Travěnec, Ladislav Šamaj
Abstract: Previous experiments and numerical simulations have revealed that a limited number of two- and three-dimensional particle systems contract in volume upon heating isobarically. This anomalous phenomenon is known as negative thermal expansion (NTE). The present paper focuses on the possibility of NTE in exactly solvable one-dimensional fluids. Firstly, the quantization of classical pure hard rods (free of NTE) does not induce NTE which indicates an unimportant role of quantum mechanics in the topic. Secondly, the classical hard rods with various types of soft nearest-neighbor interactions that contain a basin of attraction with only one minimum are investigated. The ground-state analysis reveals that, for certain potentials, increasing the pressure can lead to a discontinuous jump in the mean spacing between particles. The low-temperature analysis of the exact equation of state indicates that the NTE anomaly is present if the curvature of the soft potential increases with the distance between particles or if the potential exhibits a singularity within the basin of attraction. Isotherms of the compressibility factor, which measures the deviation of the thermodynamic behavior of a real gas from that of an ideal gas, demonstrate typical plateau or double-plateau shapes in large intervals of particle density.

Title: Multipole phases in a type of spin/fermion ladders with local conserved quantities and generalizations
Authors: Jianlong Fu
Abstract: We study spin/fermion ladder models with multipole phases, which are traditional spin phases formed by multipole moments. These phases feature non-trivial order with zero magnetization. The multipole models have dimer local conserved quantities that are Ising terms of spin. The Hilbert spaces are locally fragmented into independent sectors described effectively by {\it higher-order spin}. For dipole models, we consider two ladder geometries with quadratic spin couplings and work out the phase diagrams. Different phases of the model can be distinguished experimentally with the dynamical structure factor. Higher-order multipole models are obtained by introducing more dimer conserved quantities. The phases are characterized by the values of the local conserved quantities and the traditional spin phases of the higher-order spin.

Title: Quantum Kinetic Anatomy of Electron Angular Momenta Edge Accumulation
Authors: T. Valet, H. Jaffres, V. Cros, R. Raimondi
Abstract: Controlling electron's spin and orbital degrees of freedom has been a major research focus over the past two decades, as it underpins the electrical manipulation of magnetization. Leveraging a recently introduced quantum kinetic theory of multiband systems [T. Valet and R. Raimondi, Phys. Rev. B 111, L041118 (2025)], we outline how the intrinsic angular momenta linear response is partitioned into intraband and interband contributions. Focusing on time reversal and inversion symmetric metals, we show that the spin and orbital Hall currents are purely intraband. We also reveal that the edge densities originate partially, and in the orbital case mostly, from a new interband mechanism. We discuss how this profoundly impacts the interpretation of orbital edge accumulation observations, and has broader implications for our understanding of current induced torques.

Title: Triplet Exciton-driven Topological Mott insulator at Finite Temperature
Authors: Peizhi Mai
Abstract: Motivated by experiments in which the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) charge gap greatly exceeds the Curie temperature, we apply determinantal quantum Monte Carlo to two complementary lattice models with different geometries: the checkerboard quantum-spin-Hall-Hubbard model and the generalized Kane-Mele-Hubbard model. In both cases an incompressible QAH phase with total Chern number $C=\pm 1$ emerges at quarter filling well above the Curie temperature. Each spin channel carries its own nonquantized Chern number while remaining only partly filled, revealing a topological Mott insulator where Mottness opens the charge gap before magnetic order appears. Charge excitations bind triplet excitons that suppress net magnetization, a many-body dynamical effect absent in mean-field theory. The concurrence of these results on two very different models shows that coupling Mottness with band topology generically yields a high-temperature QAH insulator whose charge excitations are dressed by triplet excitons.

Title: Chaos in Nonequilibrium Two-Temperature $(T_x, T_y)$ Nosé-Hoover Cell Models
Authors: Hesam Arabzadeh, Carol Griswold Hoover, William Graham Hoover
Abstract: We revisit a two-temperature Nosé-Hoover wanderer particle embedded in a two-dimensional periodic 2x2 cell with four smooth repulsive corners at $(x,y) = (\pm 1, \pm 1)$ to explore chaos with anisotropic thermostatting. The model employs separate thermostats in the x and y directions, enabling controlled deviations from equilibrium. By integrating the full six-dimensional equations of motion and computing the complete Lyapunov spectrum, we confirm chaos and quantify phase-space contraction with high numerical precision. The total contraction rate, interpreted as entropy production, grows nonlinearly with the thermostat anisotropy and follows a superquadratic power law, $\Lambda\propto -\delta^{2.44}$, deviating from linear-response theory. The approximate Kaplan-Yorke dimension reveals a fractal attractor that concentrates as $|T_x - T_y|$ increases. Momentum statistics show significant non-Gaussian behavior under strong driving. Despite its dissipative nature, the model remains strictly time-reversible, offering a pedagogically rich example of microscopic reversibility coexisting with macroscopic entropy production.

Title: Magnetic Triple-q State in Antiferromagnetic Monolayer Interfaced with Bismuthene
Authors: Chia-Ju Chen, Yu-Tung Lin, Chieh-Lin Lee, Nitin Kumar, Hung-Chin Lee, Yen-Hui Lin, Bo-Yao Wang, Stefan Bluegel, Gustav Bihlmayer, Pin-Jui Hsu
Abstract: We have successfully fabricated the bismuthene covered Mn monolayer on Ag(111) by evaporating Mn atoms onto (p x root3)-Bi/Ag(111) at room temperature. By using spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy (SP-STM), we have resolved the magnetic triple-q (3Q) state. In combination with density-functional theory (DFT) calculations, the 3Q3-like spin texture is the magnetic ground state for the bismuthene covered Mn monolayer/Ag(111). Interestingly, the uniaxial magnetic anisotropy of 3Q3 state triggered by the bismuthene on top of Mn monolayer/Ag(111) has been revealed, which is consistent with the switching of 3Q3up and 3Q3down domains observed by SP-STM measurements with external magnetic fields.

Authors: Charlie W. F. Freeman, Woohyun Cho, Paul S. Keatley, PeiYu Cai, Elton J. G. Santos, Robert J. Hicken, H. Yang, Hidekazu Kurebayashi, Murat Cubukcu, Maciej Dabrowski
Abstract: We demonstrate room-temperature nucleation and manipulation of topological spin textures in the van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnet, Fe3GaTe2, through laser pulse excitation. By leveraging laser-induced heating and subsequent cooling, we access the skyrmion/bubble state at low fields and achieve toggle switching between two topological spin textures - skyrmion/bubble and labyrinth. Micromagnetic simulations reveal that this switching behaviour arises from laser-induced heating and cooling. Our findings highlight the potential of vdW ferromagnets for room temperature laser-controlled non-volatile memory storage applications.

Title: Ultrafast thermal boundary conductance under large temperature discontinuities of ultrathin epitaxial Pb films on Si(111)
Authors: Christian Brand, Tobias Witte, Mohammad Tajik, Jonas D. Fortmann, Birk Finke, Michael Horn-von Hoegen
Abstract: Heat transfer is a critical aspect of modern electronics, and a deeper understanding of the underlying physics is essential for building faster, smaller, and more powerful devices with an improved performance and efficiency. In such nanoscale structures the heat transfer between two materials is limited by the finite thermal boundary conductance across their interface. Using ultrafast electron diffraction under grazing incidence we investigated the heat transfer from ultrathin epitaxial Pb films to an Si(111) substrate under strong non-equilibrium conditions. Applying an intense femtosecond laser pulse, the 5-7 ML thin Pb film experiences a strong heat up by 10-120 K while the Si substrate remains cold at $\approx$ 10 K. At such large temperature discontinuities we observe a significantly faster cooling for stronger excited Pb films. The decrease of the corresponding cooling time constant is explained through the thermal boundary conductance in the framework of the diffuse mismatch model. The thermal boundary conductance is reduced by more than a factor of three in comparison with Pb films grown on H-terminated substrates, pointing out the importance of the morphology of substrate, film and their interface.

Title: Dynamical phase transition for the homogeneous multi-component Curie-Weiss-Potts model
Authors: Kyunghoo Mun
Abstract: In this paper, we study the homogeneous multi-component Curie-Weiss-Potts model with $q \geq 3$ spins. The model is defined on the complete graph $K_{Nm}$, whose vertex set is equally partitioned into $m$ components of size $N$. For a configuration $\sigma: \{1, \cdots, Nm\} \to \{1, \cdots, q\},$ the Gibbs measure is defined by $$ \mu_{N,\beta}(\sigma) =\frac{1}{Z_{N,\beta}} \exp\Big(\frac{\beta}{N} \sum_{v,w=1}^{Nm}\mathcal{J}(v,w)\, \mathbb{1}_{\{\sigma(v)=\sigma(w)\}}\Big), $$ where $Z_{N, \beta}$ is a normalizing constant, and $\beta>0$ is the inverse temperature parameter. The interaction coefficients are $ \mathcal{J}(v, w) = \frac{J}{1 + (m-1) \lambda}$, for $v, w$ in the same component, and $\mathcal{J}(v, w) = \frac{J \lambda}{1 + (m-1)\lambda}$ for $v, w$ in the different components, where $\lambda \in (0, 1)$ is the relative strength of inter-component interaction to intra-component interaction, and $J>0$ is the effective interaction strength. We identify a dynamical phase transition at the critical inverse temperature $\beta_{\operatorname{cr}} = \beta_{s}(q)/J$, where $\beta_{s}(q)$ is maximal inverse temperature guaranteeing a unique critical point of the free energy in the Curie-Weiss-Potts model arXiv:1204.4503. By extending the aggregate path method arXiv:1312.6728 to our multi-component setting, we prove $O(N \log N)$ mixing time in the high-temperature regime $\beta<\beta_{s}(q)/J.$ In the low-temperature regime $\beta > \beta_{s}(q)/J,$ we further show exponential mixing time by a metastability. This is the first result for the dynamical phase transition in the multi-component Potts model.

Title: Exact solution of a non-Hermitian $\mathscr{PT}$-symmetric Heisenberg spin chain
Authors: Pradip Kattel, Parameshwar R. Pasnoori, Natan Andrei
Abstract: We construct the exact solution of a non-Hermitian $\mathscr{PT}$-symmetric isotropic Heisenberg spin chain with integrable boundary fields. We find that the system exhibits two types of phases we refer to as $A$ and $B$ phases. In the $B$ type phase, the $\mathscr{PT}$- symmetry remains unbroken and it consists of eigenstates with only real energies, whereas the $A$ type phase contains a $\mathscr{PT}$-symmetry broken sector comprised of eigenstates with only complex energies and a sector of unbroken $\mathscr{PT}$-symmetry with eigenstates of real energies. The $\mathscr{PT}$-symmetry broken sector consists of pairs of eigenstates whose energies are complex conjugates of each other. The existence of two sectors in the $A$ type phase is associated with the exponentially localized bound states at the edges with complex energies which are described by boundary strings. We find that both $A$ and $B$ type phases can be further divided into sub-phases which exhibit different ground states. We also compute the bound state wavefunction in one magnon sector and find that as the imaginary value of the boundary parameter is increased, the exponentially localized wavefunction broadens thereby protruding more into the bulk, which indicates that exponentially localized bound states may not be stabilized for large imaginary values of the boundary parameter.

Title: An AI-powered Technology Stack for Solving Many-Electron Field Theory
Authors: Pengcheng Hou, Tao Wang, Daniel Cerkoney, Xiansheng Cai, Zhiyi Li, Youjin Deng, Lei Wang, Kun Chen
Abstract: Quantum field theory (QFT) for interacting many-electron systems is fundamental to condensed matter physics, yet achieving accurate solutions confronts computational challenges in managing the combinatorial complexity of Feynman diagrams, implementing systematic renormalization, and evaluating high-dimensional integrals. We present a unifying framework that integrates QFT computational workflows with an AI-powered technology stack. A cornerstone of this framework is representing Feynman diagrams as computational graphs, which structures the inherent mathematical complexity and facilitates the application of optimized algorithms developed for machine learning and high-performance computing. Consequently, automatic differentiation, native to these graph representations, delivers efficient, fully automated, high-order field-theoretic renormalization procedures. This graph-centric approach also enables sophisticated numerical integration; our neural-network-enhanced Monte Carlo method, accelerated via massively parallel GPU implementation, efficiently evaluates challenging high-dimensional diagrammatic integrals. Applying this framework to the uniform electron gas, we determine the quasiparticle effective mass to a precision significantly surpassing current state-of-the-art simulations. Our work demonstrates the transformative potential of integrating AI-driven computational advances with QFT, opening systematic pathways for solving complex quantum many-body problems across disciplines.

Abstract: The digital version of adiabatic quantum computing enhanced by counterdiabatic driving, known as digitized counterdiabatic quantum computing, has emerged as a paradigm that opens the door to fast and low-depth algorithms. In this work, we explore the extension of this paradigm to high-dimensional systems. Specifically, we consider qutrits in the context of quadratic problems, obtaining the qutrit Hamiltonian codifications and the counterdiabatic drivings. Our findings show that qutrits can improve the solution quality up to 90 times compared to the qubit counterpart. We tested our proposal on 1000 random instances of the multiway number partitioning, max 3-cut, and portfolio optimization problems, demonstrating that, in general, without prior knowledge, it is better to use qutrits and, apparently, high-dimensional systems in general instead of qubits. Finally, considering the state-of-the-art quantum platforms, we show the experimental feasibility of our high-dimensional counterdiabatic quantum algorithms at least in a fully digital form. This work paves the way for the efficient codification of optimization problems in high-dimensional spaces and their efficient implementation using counterdiabatic quantum computing.

Authors: Alasdair I. Fletcher, Cillian Harney, Masoud Ghalaii, Panagiotis Papanastasiou, Alexandros Mountogiannakis, Gaetana Spedalieri, Adnan A. E. Hajomer, Tobias Gehring, Stefano Pirandola
Abstract: As quantum key distribution (QKD) emerges as a robust defense against quantum computer threats, significant advancements have been realized by researchers. A pivotal focus has been the development of protocols that not only simplify hardware implementation like the use of continuous-variable (CV) systems, but also negate the necessity for trusted nodes, as seen with the measurement-device independent (MDI) approach. This paper delves into the integration of these methodologies in the CV-MDI-QKD protocol, offering an in-depth exploration of its evolution, primary characteristics, and the latest advancements in both theory and experiment.

Title: Entropy functionals and equilibrium states in mixed quantum-classical dynamics
Authors: Cesare Tronci, David Martínez-Crespo, François Gay-Balmaz
Abstract: The computational challenges posed by many-particle quantum systems are often overcome by mixed quantum-classical (MQC) models in which certain degrees of freedom are treated as classical while others are retained as quantum. One of the fundamental questions raised by this hybrid picture involves the characterization of the information associated to MQC systems. Based on the theory of dynamical invariants in Hamiltonian systems, here we propose a family of hybrid entropy functionals that consistently specialize to the usual Rényi and Shannon entropies. Upon considering the MQC Ehrenfest model for the dynamics of quantum and classical probabilities, we apply the hybrid Shannon entropy to characterize equilibrium configurations for simple Hamiltonians. The present construction also applies beyond Ehrenfest dynamics.

Title: Dynamics of monitored SSH Model in Krylov Space: From Complexity to Quantum Fisher Information
Authors: Nilachal Chakrabarti, Neha Nirbhan, Arpan Bhattacharyya
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the dynamics of a non-Hermitian SSH model that arises out of the no-click limit of a monitored SSH model in the Krylov space. We find that the saturation timescale of the complexity associated with the spread of the state in the Krylov subspace increases with the measurement rate, and late time behaviour differs across the $\mathrm{PT}$ symmetry transition point. Furthermore, extending the notion of this complexity for subsystems in Krylov space, we find that the scaling of its late time value with subsystem size shows a discontinuous jump across the $\mathrm{PT}$ transition point, indicating that it can be used as a suitable order parameter for such transition but not for the measurement-induced transition. Finally, we show that a generalized measure in the Krylov subspace, which contains information about the correlation landscape, such as Quantum Fisher information, which also possesses some structural similarity with the complexity functional, can be a promising probe of the measurement-induced phase.

Title: FRG analysis for a relativistic BEC in arbitrary spatial dimensions
Authors: Fumio Terazaki, Kazuya Mameda
Abstract: A relativistic Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) is studied within the complex scalar field theory using the functional renormalization group (FRG) under the local potential approximation. We investigate fluctuation effects on the relativistic BEC through numerical analyses for various spatial dimensions and chemical potentials. Our numerical results are consistent with the Mermin-Wagner theorem, and this consistency is also analytically confirmed from the flow equation. We also discuss a numerical instability of the FRG in lower spatial dimensions, which is evadable for certain parameter choices.

Title: Large time cumulants of the KPZ equation on an interval
Authors: Guillaume Barraquand, Pierre Le Doussal
Abstract: We consider the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation on the interval $[0,L]$ with Neumann type boundary conditions and boundary parameters $u,v$. We show that the $k$-th order cumulant of the height behaves as $c_k(L,u,v)\, t$ in the large time limit $t \to +\infty$, and we compute the coefficients $c_k(L,u,v)$. We obtain an expression for the upper tail large deviation function of the height. We also consider the limit of large $L$, with $u=\tilde u/\sqrt{L}$, $u=\tilde v/\sqrt{L}$, which should give the same quantities for the two parameter family $(\tilde u, \tilde v)$ KPZ fixed point on the interval. We employ two complementary methods. On the one hand we adapt to the interval the replica Bethe ansatz method pioneered by Brunet and Derrida for the periodic case. On the other hand, we perform a scaling limit using previous results available for the open ASEP. The latter method allows to express the cumulants of the KPZ equation in terms a functional equation involving an integral operator.

Title: phaser: A unified and extensible framework for fast electron ptychography
Authors: Colin Gilgenbach, Menglin Zhu, James M. LeBeau
Abstract: We present \code{phaser}, an open-source Python package that provides a unified interface to both conventional and gradient descent-based ptychographic algorithms. Features such as mixed-state probe, probe position correction, and multislice ptychography make experimental reconstructions practical and robust. Reconstructions are specified in a declarative format and can be run from a command line, Jupyter notebook, or web interface. Multiple computational backends are supported to provide maximum flexibility. With the JAX computational backend, a six-fold improvement in iteration speed is achieved over a widely used package implemented in MATLAB, fold\_slice/PtychoShelves. We report reconstruction success for a variety of experimental datasets, and detail the effects of regularization on convergence and reconstruction quality. The software promises to speed the application and development of ptychographic methods for materials science.

Title: Particle deposit patterns from evaporation of a sessile colloidal droplet
Authors: A. Mokhtari, M. AitSaada, S. Chikh, L. Tadrist
Abstract: The present work investigates numerically the transport of colloidal particles within an evaporating sessile droplet and their deposition on the substrate in unfavourable conditions. The coupled phenomena of fluid flow and heat and mass transfer with phase change are modelled by taking into account for the evaporative cooling effect, the surface tension gradient effect at liquid air interface and the particles-substrate interaction effect due to DLVO attractive this http URL results show that in presence of the particles-substrate interaction, the outward radial internal flow is the main responsible for the coffee ring effect giving rise a ring like pattern with inner traces, while the thermal Marangoni internal flow reduces this effect giving rise a uniform deposit with a dark periphery.

Title: Redundancy Channels in the Conformal Bootstrap
Authors: Stefanos R. Kousvos, Andreas Stergiou
Abstract: A method for obstructing symmetry enhancement in numerical conformal bootstrap calculations is proposed. Symmetry enhancement refers to situations where bootstrap studies initialised with a certain symmetry end up allowing theories with higher symmetry. In such cases, it is shown that redundant operators in the less symmetric theory can descend from primary scaling operators of the more symmetric one, motivating the imposition of spectral gaps that are justified in the former but not the latter. The same mechanism can also be used to differentiate between decoupled and fully coupled theories which otherwise have the same global symmetry. A systematic understanding of this mechanism is developed and applied to distinguish the cubic from the $O(3)$ model in three dimensions, where a strip of disallowed parameter space, referred to as the cubic redundancy channel, emerges once a gap associated with a redundant operator of the cubic theory is imposed. The channel corresponds precisely to the region of parameter space where the assumed cubic symmetry would be enhanced to $O(3)$.

Title: Fibonacci Waveguide Quantum Electrodynamics
Authors: Florian Bönsel, Flore K. Kunst, Federico Roccati
Abstract: Waveguide quantum electrodynamics (QED) provides a powerful framework for engineering quantum interactions, traditionally relying on periodic photonic arrays with continuous energy bands. Here, we investigate waveguide QED in a fundamentally different environment: A one-dimensional photonic array whose hopping strengths are structured aperiodically according to the deterministic Fibonacci-Lucas substitution rule. These "Fibonacci waveguides" lack translational invariance and are characterized by a singular continuous energy spectrum and critical eigenstates, representing a deterministic intermediate between ordered and disordered systems. We demonstrate how to achieve decoherence-free, coherent interactions in this unique setting. We analyze two paradigmatic cases: (i) Giant emitters resonantly coupled to the simplest aperiodic version of a standard waveguide. For these, we show that atom photon bound states form only for specific coupling configurations dictated by the aperiodic sequence, leading to an effective atomic Hamiltonian, which itself inherits the Fibonacci structure; and (ii) emitters locally and off-resonantly coupled to the aperiodic version of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger waveguide. In this case the mediating bound states feature aperiodically modulated profiles, resulting in an effective Hamiltonian with multifractal properties. Our work establishes Fibonacci waveguides as a versatile platform, which is experimentally feasible, demonstrating that the deterministic complexity of aperiodic structures can be directly engineered into the interactions between quantum emitters.
