Title: The Meissner effect in superconductors: emergence versus reductionism
Authors: J. E. Hirsch
Abstract: The Meissner effect, the expulsion of magnetic field from the interior of a metal entering the superconducting state, is arguably the most fundamental property of superconductors, discovered in 1933. The conventional theory of superconductivity developed in 1957 is generally believed to fully explain the Meissner effect. We will review the arguments that support this consensus, rooted in the concept of emergence. However, recent work has shown that there are questions related to momentum conservation in the process of magnetic field expulsion that have not been addressed within the conventional theory. Within a reductionist approach, it has been proposed that those questions can only be resolved by introducing physics that is not part of the conventional theory, namely that there is radial motion of electric charge in the transition process. This is consistent with the behavior of classical plasmas, where motion of magnetic field lines is always associated with motion of charges. We review how this approach explains puzzles associated with momentum transfer between electrons and ions in the Meissner effect. Whether or not radial charge motion is associated with the Meissner effect has fundamental implications regarding superconductivity mechanisms in materials and regarding strategies to search for new materials with higher superconducting transition temperatures. Therefore, adjudication of this question is urgent and important.

Title: XDXD: End-to-end crystal structure determination with low resolution X-ray diffraction
Authors: Jiale Zhao, Cong Liu, Yuxuan Zhang, Chengyue Gong, Zhenyi Zhang, Shifeng Jin, Zhenyu Liu
Abstract: Determining crystal structures from X-ray diffraction data is fundamental across diverse scientific fields, yet remains a significant challenge when data is limited to low resolution. While recent deep learning models have made breakthroughs in solving the crystallographic phase problem, the resulting low-resolution electron density maps are often ambiguous and difficult to interpret. To overcome this critical bottleneck, we introduce XDXD, to our knowledge, the first end-to-end deep learning framework to determine a complete atomic model directly from low-resolution single-crystal X-ray diffraction data. Our diffusion-based generative model bypasses the need for manual map interpretation, producing chemically plausible crystal structures conditioned on the diffraction pattern. We demonstrate that XDXD achieves a 70.4\% match rate for structures with data limited to 2.0~Å resolution, with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) below 0.05. Evaluated on a benchmark of 24,000 experimental structures, our model proves to be robust and accurate. Furthermore, a case study on small peptides highlights the model's potential for extension to more complex systems, paving the way for automated structure solution in previously intractable cases.

Title: Non-invertible bosonic chiral symmetry on the lattice
Authors: Lukasz Fidkowski, Cenke Xu, Carolyn Zhang
Abstract: In this work we realize the 3 + 1 dimensional non-invertible ${\mathbb{Z}}_N$ chiral symmetry generator as an operator in a many body lattice Hilbert space. A crucial ingredient in our construction is the use of infinite dimensional $U(1)$ rotor site Hilbert spaces. Specifically, our Hilbert space is that of a $U(1)$ lattice gauge theory coupled to a charge $1$ scalar in the Villain formulation, which allows for direct access to monopoles and for a simple definition of a magnetic ${\mathbb{Z}}_N$ one-form symmetry $Z^{(1)}_m$ , at the lattice Hamiltonian level. We construct the generator of the ${\mathbb{Z}}_N$ chiral symmetry as as a unitary operator in the subspace of $Z^{(1)}_m$-invariant states, and show that it cannot be extended to the entire Hilbert space while preserving locality and unitarity. Using a lattice-level duality based on gauging $Z^{(1)}_m$, we find a dual description of this subspace, as the subspace of a charge $1/N$ gauge theory invariant under an electric one-form symmetry $Z^{(1)}_e$. We show that in this dual formulation, the chiral symmetry generator does extend unitarily to the entire Hilbert space, but has a mixed anomaly with the $Z^{(1)}_e$ symmetry.

Title: Interplay of Noise and Reservoir-induced Decoherence in Persistent Currents
Authors: Samudra Sur, Thierry Giamarchi
Abstract: Persistent current is a hallmark of quantum phase coherence. We study the fate of the persistent current in a non-equilibrium setting, where a tight-binding ring is subjected to stochastic disorder as well as a fermionic reservoir attached to each site. We evaluate the current using Keldysh technique and find that it exhibits non-monotonic behavior, suggesting two distinct mechanisms of decoherence. While coupling to the reservoirs introduces a coherence length scale given by the inverse of the coupling strength, the other mechanism is more subtle and driven by the ratio of noise strength to reservoir coupling. The interplay of noise and reservoir constitutes a purely non-equilibrium steady state with a flatter distribution function that we effectively describe using classical rate equations. We discuss possibilities of realizing our findings in ultracold-atom experiments.

Title: First-passage properties of the jump process with a drift. The general case
Authors: Ivan N. Burenev
Abstract: We study the first-passage properties of a jump process with constant drift where jump amplitudes and inter-arrival times follow arbitrary light-tailed distributions with smooth densities. Using a mapping to an effective discrete-time random walk, we identify three regimes determined by the drift strength: survival (weak drift), absorption (strong drift), and critical. We derive explicit expressions for exponential decay rates in the survival and absorption regimes, and characterize algebraic decay at the critical point. We also obtain asymptotic behavior of the mean first-passage time, number of jumps, and their variances for processes starting either close to the origin or far from it.

Title: Magnus Induced Magnetic Diode Effect in Skyrmion Systems
Authors: J. C. Bellizotti Souza, C. J. O. Reichhardt, C. Reichhardt, A. Saxena
Abstract: We show that skyrmions can exhibit what we call a magnetic diode effect, where there is a nonreciprocal response in the transport when the magnetic field is reversed. This effect can be achieved for skyrmions moving in a channel with a sawtooth potential on one side and a reversed sawtooth potential on the other side. We consider the cases of both spin-transfer torque (STT) and spin-orbit torque (SOT) driving. When the magnetic field is held fixed, the velocity response of the skyrmion is the same for current applied in either direction for both STT and SOT driving, so there is no current diode effect. When the magnetic field is reversed, under STT driving the velocity of the skyrmion reverses and its absolute value changes. Under SOT driving, the velocity remains in the same direction but drops to a much lower value, resulting in negative differential conductivity. For a fixed current, we find a nonreciprocal skyrmion velocity as a function of positive and negative applied fields, in analogy to the velocity-current curves observed in the usual diode effect. The nonreciprocity is generated by the Magnus force, which causes skyrmions to interact preferentially with one side of the channel. Since the channel sides have opposite asymmetry, a positive magnetic field can cause the skyrmion to interact with the "hard" asymmetry side of the channel, while a negative magnetic field causes the skyrmion to interact with the easy asymmetry side. This geometry could be used to create new kinds of magnetic-field-induced diode effects that can be harnessed in new types of skyrmion-based devices.

Title: Simplifying Generation of Special Quasirandom Structures with ATAT Using Interactive Online Interface - SimplySQS
Authors: Miroslav Lebeda, Jan Drahokoupil, Petr Vlčák, Šimon Svoboda, Axel van de Walle
Abstract: The special quasirandom structure (SQS) method is a widely used approach for modeling random alloys with periodic boundary conditions. Among available implementations, the Alloy Theoretic Automated Toolkit (ATAT) mcsqs module remains one of the most established tools for SQS generation. However, its command-line operation and input file preparation often present a steep learning curve, particularly for students and researchers without programming experience. To lower these barriers, we have developed SimplySQS (this http URL), an online, browser-based interactive interface that automates the preparation, execution, and analysis of ATAT mcsqs outputs. SimplySQS allows users to upload or import structures from databases (MP, AFLOW, COD), configure compositions and supercells via guided forms, automatically generate ATAT input and batch scripts, and visualize results such as convergence behavior, correlation functions, and radial distribution functions. The best SQS outputs can be exported in standard formats (POSCAR, CIF, LMP, XYZ). By simplifying setup and minimizing file-handling errors, SimplySQS broadens access to ATAT mcsqs, making SQS generation more approachable for beginners while streamlining workflows for experienced users. The workflow is illustrated on the perovskite series Pb1-xSrxTiO3 (PSTO, including PbTiO3 (PTO) and SrTiO3 (STO)), where an all-in-one batch script generated with SimplySQS was used to obtain SQSs across the composition range. The resulting structures were subsequently optimized using the MACE MATPES-r2SCAN-0 universal machine-learning interatomic potential (MLIP) to predict evolution of lattice parameters. The MLIP accurately reproduced the cubic-to-tetragonal transition near x = 0.5, with lattice parameters deviating by less than 1 % in the cubic (x > 0.5) and 3 % in the tetragonal (x < 0.5) regions.

Title: Benchmarking 34 OpenKIM Nickel Potentials with an Emphasis on Surfaces and Extended Defects
Authors: Matthew Thoms (1), Hao Sun (2), Laurent Karim Béland (1) ((1) Queen's University, (2) Liaoning Academy of Materials)
Abstract: We present an automated benchmarking suite for face-centered-cubic (FCC) nickel that evaluates 47 quantitative metrics spanning both standard tests (equation of state, elastic constants, surface energies and phonons) and application-specific scenarios such as defect formation and migration, grain boundaries, step edges, close-range interactions, and vacancy cluster energetics. Using this framework, we assess 34 interatomic potentials from the OpenKIM repository, including pairwise, embedded-atom, modified-embedded-atom, angular-dependent, and spectral neighbor analysis potentials (SNAP). Results are compared against ab initio benchmarks compiled from the literature. Most potentials accurately reproduce lattice parameters, elastic constants, and surface energies, whereas predictive accuracy degrades for migration barriers and short-range compression. Principal-component analysis identifies correlated property groups and a partially orthogonal component associated with migration and short-range physics, revealing Pareto trade-offs between accuracy domains. SNAP models occupy the lowest-error frontier, although several embedded-atom potentials remain competitive across many metrics. The framework provides a reproducible baseline for potential selection, highlights systematic limitations across formalisms, and supports benchmarking-in-the-loop strategies for developing next-generation machine-learning potentials for Ni and Ni-based alloys.

Title: Oxidation State Dynamics and Emerging Patterns in Magnetite
Authors: Emre Gürsoy, Gregor B. Vonbun-Feldbauer, Robert H. Meißner
Abstract: Magnetite is an important mineral with many interesting applications related to its magnetic, electrical and thermal properties. Typically studied by electronic structure calculations, these methods are unable to capture the complex ion dynamics at relevant temperatures, time and length scales. We present a hybrid Monte Carlo/Molecular Dynamics (MC/MD) method based on iron oxidation state exchange for accurate atomistic modelling of bulk magnetite, magnetite surfaces and nanoparticles that captures the complex ionic dynamics. By comparing oxidation state patterns with those obtained from density functional theory, we confirmed the accuracy of our approach. Lattice distortions leading to the stabilisation of excess charges and a critical surface thickness at which the oxidation states transition from ordered to disordered were observed. This simple yet efficient approach paves the way for elucidating aspects of oxidation state ordering of inverse spinel structures in general and battery materials in particular.

Title: Transitions driven by multibody interactions in an effective model of active matter
Authors: Thibaut Arnoulx de Pirey, Frédéric van Wijland
Abstract: When out-of-equilibrium particles interact by means of pairwise forces, their stationary distribution in general exhibits many-body interactions. In the particular case of active particles, it has been shown numerically that the Motility Induced Phase Separation cannot be explained by the effective attraction emerging from two isolated particles, thereby highlighting the role of multibody interactions. In this work, we study the thermodynamics of the Fox-UCNA approximation for active particles interacting by means of pairwise repulsive forces. Working at large space dimension we establish that multibody interactions up to infinite order are instrumental in giving rise to such collective phenomena as phase transitions. We recover a MIPS-like first order transition, but also find a liquid-liquid transition at somewhat lower persistence times. This new transition is connected to a spin glass phase of orientational-like degrees of freedom with disordered interactions set by the particle positions themselves.

Title: First-Principles Investigation of the Physical and Thermoelectric Properties of Chalcogenide Compounds for Waste-Heat Recovery
Authors: Md Hasan Shahriar Rifat, Tanvir Khan, K.M. Mehedi Hassan
Abstract: Improving energy efficiency by recovering waste heat and providing thermal protection is of high technological importance. This work investigates the chalcogenide compounds CdGa2Te4 and ZnGa2Te4 using density functional theory and BoltzTraP2 calculations. Both materials are dynamically stable, brittle, and elastically anisotropic. Electronic structure calculations show direct band gaps that range from 1.0 to 2.2 electronvolt. Carrier effective masses are favorable, with CdGa2Te4 showing light electrons equal to 0.21 times the free electron mass and ZnGa2Te4 showing moderately heavy carriers equal to 0.39 times the free electron mass. Thermoelectric transport calculations yield large Seebeck coefficients of about 108 to 119 microvolt per kelvin. The thermoelectric figure of merit ZT increases from about 0.4 at 50 K to about 0.78 at 800 kelvin, indicating promising thermoelectric performance. For thermal barrier coating applications, both compounds combine ultralow lattice thermal conductivity with moderate melting points around 790 to 850 K and small thermal expansion coefficients, which helps resist thermal stress. Overall, CdGa2Te4 and ZnGa2Te4 are multifunctional materials suitable for efficient waste heat recovery and durable thermal barrier operation below 900 K.

Title: Highly efficient quantum Stirling engine using multilayer Graphene
Authors: Bastian Castorene, Francisco J. Peña, Eric Suarez, Caio Lewenkopf, Martin HvE Groves, Natalia Cortés, Patricio Vargas
Abstract: In this work, quantum Stirling engines based on monolayer, AB-stacked bilayer, and ABC-stacked trilayer graphene under perpendicular magnetic fields are analyzed. Performance maps of the useful work \((\eta W)\) reveal a robust optimum at low magnetic fields and moderately low temperatures, with all stackings capable of reaching Carnot efficiency under suitable configurations. The AB bilayer achieves this across the broadest parameter window while sustaining finite work, the monolayer exhibits highly constrained regimes, and the trilayer shows smoother trends with sizable \(\eta W\). These results identify multilayer graphene, particularly the AB bilayer, as a promising platform for efficient Stirling engines, while also highlighting the versatility of the monolayer in realizing all four operational regimes of the Stirling cycle.

Title: A Hall viscosity for skyrmion via magnon interaction
Authors: Bom Soo Kim
Abstract: We identify a Hall viscosity term directly from the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), that breaks parity symmetry, in the skyrmion motion of insulating magnets by time-averaging the magnon contribution to all orders. The viscosity term is proportional to the skyrmion charge. Skyrmion Hall angle shows significant dependence on the skyrmion shape and size, the ratio of exchange over DMI parameters, while roughly independent of the Gilbert damping parameter. The Hall angles have the same magnitude for opposite skyrmion charges. We speculate a velocity-dependent Hall viscosity contribution to seek asymmetric Hall angles for the opposite charges.

Title: Geometric Field Theory for Elastohydrodynamics of Cosserat Rods
Authors: Mingjia Yan, Mohamed Warda, Balázs Németh, Lukas Kikuchi, Ronojoy Adhikari
Abstract: Slender structures are ubiquitous in biological and physical systems, from bacterial flagella to soft robotic arms. The Cosserat rod provides a mathematical framework for slender bodies that can stretch, shear, twist and bend. In viscous fluid environments at low Reynolds numbers - as encountered in soft matter physics, biophysics, and soft continuum robotics - inertial effects become negligible, and hydrodynamic forces are well approximated by Stokes friction. We demonstrate that the resulting elastohydrodynamic equations of motion, when formulated using Cartan's method of moving frames, possess the structure of a geometric field theory in which the configuration field takes values in SE(3), the Lie group of rigid body motions. This geometric formulation yields coordinate-independent equations that are manifestly invariant under spatial isometries and naturally suited to constitutive modeling based on Curie's principle. We derive integrability conditions that determine when constitutive laws can be derived from an energy functional, thereby distinguishing between passive and active material responses. We also obtain the beam limit for small deformations. Our results establish a unified geometric framework for the nonlinear mechanics of slender structures in slow viscous flow and enable efficient numerical solutions.

Title: Inverse proximity effect in thin-film superconductor/magnet heterostructures with metallic and insulating magnets
Authors: V. A. Bobkov, G. A. Bobkov, I. V. Bobkova
Abstract: Proximity effect in thin-film superconductor (S)/magnet heterostructures with different types of magnets including ferromagnets, antiferromagnets and altermagnets is widely considered in the framework of an effective model, where the heterostructure is replaced by a homogeneous superconductor in the presence of a homogeneous exchange field of a corresponding type. Here we study the extent to which such a model is actually applicable to ballistic thin-film superconductor/magnetic heterostructures. In particular, a comparative analysis of thin-film superconductor/magnetic metal and superconductor/magnetic insulator heterostructures is performed. Metallic and insulating ferromagnets (FM, FI) and altermagnets (AM, AI) are considered. It is shown that in the S/FI and S/AI heterostructures the the proximity effect creates a well-defined spin splitting of the electronic spectra in the S layer. Thus, they are well described by the effective model. At the same time, the proximity effect in S/FM and S/AM heterostructures also creates a spin splitting of the spectra of the S layer, but it has a chaotic spectral and spatial distribution and unpredictable amplitude and, in general, cannot be detected via the spin splitting of the superconducting density of states. Thus, the effective model is not applicable to such heterostructures. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that they support well-pronounced triplet correlations and, thus, can be used for spintronics applications.

Title: Elastohydrodynamic instabilities of a soft robotic arm in a viscous fluid
Authors: Mohamed Warda, Ronojoy Adhikari
Abstract: The design and control of soft robots operating in fluid environments requires a careful understanding of the interplay between large elastic body deformations and hydrodynamic forces. Here we show that this interplay leads to novel elastohydrodynamic instabilities in a clamped soft robotic arm driven terminally by a constant pressure in a viscous fluid. We model the arm as a Cosserat rod that can stretch, shear and bend. We obtain invariant, geometrically exact, non-linear equations of motion by using Cartan's method of moving frames. Stability to small perturbations of a straight rod is governed by a non-Hermitian linear operator. Eigenanalysis shows that stability is lost through a Hopf bifurcation with the increase of pressure above a first threshold. A surprising return to stability is obtained with further increase of pressure beyond a second threshold. Numerical solutions of the non-linear equations, using a geometrically exact spectral method, confirms stable limit-cycle oscillations between these two pressure thresholds. An asymptotic analysis in the beam limit rationalizes these results analytically. This counterintuitive sequence of bifurcations underscores the subtle nature of the elastohydrodynamic coupling in Cosserat rods and emphasizes their importance for the control of the viscous dynamics of soft robots.

Title: Probing Hidden Symmetry and Altermagnetism with Sub-Picometer Sensitivity via Nonlinear Transport
Authors: Subin Mali, Yufei Zhao, Yu Wang, Saugata Sarker, Yangyang Chen, Zixuan Li, Jun Zhu, Ying Liu, Venkatraman Gopalan, Binghai Yan, Zhiqiang Mao
Abstract: X-ray and neutron diffraction are foundational tools for determining crystal structures, but their resolution limits can lead to misassignments, especially in materials with subtle distortions or competing phases. Here, we demonstrate the use of nonlinear transport as a complementary approach to uncover hidden crystal symmetries, using the strongly correlated Ca$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ as a case study. Below 48 K (T$_S$), where the magnetic moments of the antiferromagnetic phase reorient from the a- to the b-axis, leading to a pseudogap opening, our measurements, with support of DFT, reveal a previously overlooked lower-symmetry phase. This is manifested by the emergence of longitudinal nonlinear resistance (NLR) along the b-axis below T$_S$, providing direct evidence of combined translational and time-reversal symmetry breaking. This response also suggests a transformation from a conventional antiferromagnet into an altermagnet. The lower-symmetry phase arises from a subtle lattice distortion (~0.1 pm) associated with the magnetic transition at T$_S$, below the detection limit of conventional diffraction. Moreover, this NLR below T$_S$ is accompanied by a nonlinear Hall effect, both of which are enhanced by the large quantum metric associated with Weyl chains near the Fermi surface. Our findings demonstrate nonlinear transport as a sensitive probe of hidden symmetry breaking and altermagnetism, complementing and extending beyond the reach of traditional diffraction and spectroscopic techniques.

Title: Altermon: a magnetic-field-free parity protected qubit based on a narrow altermagnet Josephson junction
Authors: Sakineh Vosoughi-nia, Michał P. Nowak
Abstract: Altermagnets provide a new route to engineer superconducting circuits without magnetic fields. We theoretically study the Andreev bound state (ABS) spectrum of a finite-width altrmagnet-based Josephson junction and show how the $d$-wave altermagnetic symmetry and geometric confinement shape its low-energy excitations. We find a clear distinction between the two $d$-wave symmetries: $d_{x^2-y^2}$ order produces spin splitting, whereas $d_{xy}$ order preserves spin degeneracy and exhibits splitting of the ABS spectrum induced by intermode hybridization. Leveraging these novel features, we propose applying a transverse electric field to tune the system and realize a magnetic-field-free, parity-protected superconducting qubit that we call altermon.

Title: Anisotropic-Strain Control of The Magnetic Structure in Mn\textsubscript{3}GaN
Authors: Roman Malyshev, Ingeborg-Helene Svenum, Sverre M. Selbach, Thomas Tybell
Abstract: A first principles study is conducted to explore the changes in the magnetic structure of Mn\textsubscript{3}GaN under anisotropic biaxial strain. Mn\textsubscript{3}GaN is an antiperovskite with a structure similar to that of an ideal cubic perovskite. Several manganese nitride antiperovskites including Mn\textsubscript{3}GaN were reported to have a frustrated noncollinear antiferromagnetic structure. Successful electric switching of its magnetic structure has been reported. Furthermore, despite a cubic lattice symmetry, the magnetic symmetry is rhombohedral, allowing a piezomagnetic response. Tensile biaxial strain has been shown to produce a net magnetic moment by inducing in-plane spin canting. Compressive biaxial strain has been used to induce a spin-polarized ferro- or ferrimagnetic phase. In this study, anisotropic strain in the (001) plane is applied, outlining a magnetic phase diagram that can predict the properties when growing Mn\textsubscript{3}GaN thin films on noncubic substrates. The lattice vectors along the a and b crystallographic axes are strained by -5\% to 5\% in percentwise increments in all permutations. An extensive phase diagram is mapped, revealing multiple combinations of strain applied to the two lattice vectors that result in a ferro- or ferrimagnetic transition. Unlike previous results, not only strictly compressive strain on both lattice vectors, but combinations of tensile and compressive strain, as well as uniaxial strain, are seen producing the magnetic phase transitions. Furthermore, while biquadratic strain was seen producing a net moment in the [110] direction under tensile strain and [\bar{1}\bar{1}0] under compressive strain, anisotropic strain allows tuning the direction of the net magnetization.

Title: MACE Foundation Models for Lattice Dynamics: A Benchmark Study on Double Halide Perovskites
Authors: Jack Yang, Ziqi Yin, Lei Ao, Sean Li
Abstract: Recent developments in materials informatics and artificial intelligence has led to the emergence of foundational energy models for material chemistry, as represented by the suite of MACE-based foundation models, bringing a significant breakthrough in universal potentials for inorganic solids. As to all method developments in computational materials science, performance benchmarking against existing high-level data with focusing on specific applications, is critically needed to understand the limitations in the models, thus facilitating the ongoing improvements in the model development process, and occasionally, leading to significant conceptual leaps in materials theory. Here, using our own published DFT (Density Functional Theory) database of room-temperature dynamic stability and vibrational anharmonicity for $\sim2000$ cubic halide double perovskites, we benchmarked the performances of four different variants of the MACE foundation models for screening the dynamic stabilities of inorganic solids. Our analysis shows that, as anticipated, the model accuracy improves with more training data. The dynamic stabilities of weakly anharmonic materials (as predicted by DFT) are more accurately reproduced by the foundation model, than those highly anharmonic and dynamically unstable ones. The predominant source of error in predicting the dynamic stability arises predominantly from the amplification of errors in atomic forces when predicting the harmonic phonon properties through the computation of the Hessian matrix, less so is the contribution from possible differences in the range of the configurational spaces that are sampled by DFT and the foundation model in molecular dynamics. We hope that our present findings will stimulate future works towards more physics-inspired approaches in assessing the accuracy of foundation models for atomistic modelling.

Title: Chirality/Axiality-Induced Axiality/Chirality via Surface Polarization
Authors: Satoru Hayami, Rikuto Oiwa, Akane Inda
Abstract: In condensed matter physics, a broad spectrum of physical characteristics, such as chirality, axiality, and polarity, arises as a direct consequence of the underlying symmetry of the system. We here theoretically investigate the effective coupling between chirality and axiality at their domain boundaries, mediated by polarity. Based on symmetry considerations and model analyses, we propose the concept of chirality-induced axiality via surface polarization, which refers to a phenomenon where the handedness of chirality selects an axial moment with a particular orientation by lowering its energy at the surface. We further establish the inverse process, termed axiality-induced chirality via surface polarization, whereby axiality in turn dictates the preferred chirality. These reciprocal couplings open a new pathway for stabilizing single-domain states of chirality and axiality. They further imply interfacial functionalities, including the selective adsorption of chiral and axial molecules.

Title: Interatomic potential development for topological insulator Bi1-xSbx and its dislocation by force-following active learning
Authors: Moon-ki Choi, Daniel Palmer, Harley T. Johnson
Abstract: We introduce a force following active learning algorithm that integrates density functional theory DFT with the Gaussian Approximation Potential GAP framework to develop a robust interatomic potential IP for a dislocation in a topological insulator Bi1xSbx. Starting from an initial potential IP0 trained on unit cell data from strained Bi Sb binaries our active learning approach iteratively refines the IP during a structural relaxation. In each cycle if the force error uncertainty of any atom near the dislocation core exceeds a threshold value the IPi is efficiently retrained IPi to IPi1 by incorporating DFT computed forces and energies of atoms near the high uncertainty atom. This strategy ensures that the relaxation process maintains a low force error until full convergence is achieved. Consequently the final IP here IP5 has two capabilities 1 it reproduces the relaxation pathway observed during the active learning process unlike the initial IP0 which lacks prior dislocation core knowledge and 2 it captures the lattice and elastic properties of Bi Sb binaries across a range of Sb concentrations. We also evaluate dislocation properties Peierls stresses and dislocation generation by compression to assess the performance of the trained potential IP5.

Title: Zero-Dimensional Stacking Domains Enable Strong-Ductile Synergy in Additive Manufactured Titanium
Authors: Wenjing Zhang, Jizhe Cui, Xiaoyang Wang, Shubo Zhang, Yan Chong, Andy Godfrey, Nobuhiro Tsuji, Kai Wang, Rong Hu, Jing Xue, Junyu Chen, Gang Fang, Rong Yu, Wei Liu
Abstract: Alloying by addition of oxygen interstitials during additive manufacturing provides new routes to strengthen and toughen metals and alloys. The underlying mechanisms by which such interstitial atoms lead to enhanced properties remain, however, unclear, not least due a lack of quantitative atomic-scale models linking microstructure to properties. Here using quasi-3D imaging based on multi-slice electron ptychography, we reveal the importance of a new type of interstitial-character lattice defect, namely zero-dimensional stacking domains (ZDSDs), present in high density in AM-processed oxygen-modulated pure titanium. These ZDSDs promote slip diversity, and support intense work hardening, enabling a three-fold enhancement in both strength and ductility in Ti-0.45O compared to conventional pure Ti. The work demonstrates the potential for using interstitial solutes to enhance mechanical properties in a range of critical engineering alloys.

Title: All-Electrical Self-Switching of van der Waals Chiral Antiferromagnet
Authors: Junlin Xiong, Jiawei Jiang, Yanwei Cui, Han Gao, Ji Zhou, Zijia Liu, KuiKui Zhang, Shaobo Cheng, Kehui Wu, Sang-Wook Cheong, Kai Chang, Zhongkai Liu, Hongxin Yang, Shi-Jun Liang, Bin Cheng, Feng Miao
Abstract: Antiferromagnets have garnered significant attention due to their negligible stray field and ultrafast magnetic dynamics, which are promising for high-density and ultrafast spintronic applications. Their dual functionality as both spin sources and information carriers could enable all-electrical self-induced switching of antiferromagnetic order, offering great potential for ultra-compact spintronic devices. However, related progress is still elusive. Here, we report the deterministic switching of chiral antiferromagnetic orders induced by charge current at zero external magnetic field in the van der Waals (vdW) magnetically intercalated transition metal dichalcogenide CoTa3S6. This system exhibits strong interactions between cobalt atom magnetic moment lattice and itinerant electrons within the metallic layers, as demonstrated by temperature-dependent angle-resolved photoemission, scanning tunneling spectroscopy, and topological Nernst effect measurements. Notably, the itinerant-localization interactions lead to current-induced chiral spin orbit torques as well as Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) exchange torques that interact with the localized magnetic moments, facilitating all-electrical switching of the chiral magnetic order in the CoTa3S6 flake. Our work opens a promising avenue for manipulating antiferromagnetic orders by delicately engineering the synergistic interactions between magnetic moments and itinerant electrons.

Title: Spin gaps in Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Nanoribbons with atomic Adsorbates
Authors: Joshua O. Aggrey, Leonard Bleiziffer, Frank Hagelberg
Abstract: Edge-functionalized Transition Metal dichalcogenide nanoribbons of the zigzag type (zTMDCNRs) are explored in terms of their spin transmission properties. Specifically, systems of the type 5-zWXYNR + nA (X, Y = S, Se; n = 0, 1, 2; A = H, B, C, N, O), involving five rows of a zWXY unit, are investigated as transmission elements between semi-infinite electrodes, to identify atomic adsorbates and adsorption conditions for maximizing the spin polarization of current traversing the ribbons. Janus counterparts of these units, asymmetric structures comprising a transition metal layer sandwiched by two different chalcogen layers, are included in this study. In all cases considered, density functional theory (DFT) modeling, involving the hybrid Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE) exchange-correlation functional, is combined with the non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) approach to determine both spin and charge transport properties. The effect of the selected atomic absorbates on the geometric, electronic, and magnetic properties of 5-zWXYNR (X, Y = S, Se) is evaluated. A protocol to assess the spin-filtering capacity of 5-zWXYNR + nad as a function of the nature and the density of atomic adsorbates, is formulated in terms of band structure analysis of the respective electrode units. Spin gaps emerging close to the Fermi energy of the electrode are shown to provide an effective predictor for the degree of current spin polarization achieved by any of the transmission systems studied here. For any adsorbate configuration considered, ferromagnetic (FM) as well as antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering is examined, and the impact of the magnetic phase on the spin transport properties is discussed. A spin-selective negative differential resistance effect is identified for specific nanoribbon systems.

Title: Fluctuations in first passage times and utility of resetting protocol in biochemical systems with two-state toggling
Authors: Hillol Kumar Barman, Pathik Das, Syed Yunus Ali
Abstract: Interesting theoretical problems of target search or threshold crossing, formally known as {\it first passage}, often arise in both diffusive transport problems as well as problems of chemical reaction kinetics. We study three systems following different chemical kinetics, and are special as they {\it toggle between two states}: (i) a population dynamics of cells with auto-catalytic birth and intermittent toxic chemical-induced forced death, (ii) a bond cluster model representing membrane adhesion to extracellular matrix under a fluctuating load, and (iii) a model of gene transcription with a regulated promoter switching between active and inactive states. Each of these systems has a target state to attain, which defines a first passage problem -- namely, population becoming extinct, complete membrane detachment, or mRNA count crossing a threshold. We study the fluctuations in first passage time and show that it is interestingly {\it non-monotonic} in all these cases, with increasing strength of bias towards the target. We also study suitable {\it stochastic resetting} protocols to expedite first passage for these systems, and show that there is a re-entrant transition of the efficacy of this protocol in all the three cases, as a function of the bias. The exact analytical condition for these transitions predicted in earlier literature is verified here through simulations.

Title: Floquet engineering enabled by charge density wave transition
Authors: Fei Wang, Xuanxi Cai, Teng Xiao, Changhua Bao, Haoyuan Zhong, Wanying Chen, Tianyun Lin, Tianshuang Sheng, Xiao Tang, Hongyun Zhang, Pu Yu, Zhiyuan Sun, Shuyun Zhou
Abstract: Floquet engineering has emerged as a powerful approach for dynamically tailoring the electronic structures of quantum materials through time-periodic light fields generated by ultrafast laser pulses. The light fields can transiently dress Bloch electrons, creating novel electronic states inaccessible in equilibrium. While such temporal modulation provides dynamic control, spatially periodic modulations, such as those arising from charge density wave (CDW) order, can also dramatically reconstruct the band structure through real-space symmetry breaking. The interplay between these two distinct forms of modulation-temporal and spatial-opens a new frontier in electronic-phase-dependent Floquet engineering. Here we demonstrate this concept experimentally in the prototypical CDW material 1T-TiSe$_2$. Using time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (TrARPES) with mid-infrared pumping, we observe a striking pump-induced instantaneous downshift of the valence band maximum (VBM), which is in sharp contrast to the subsequent upward shift on picosecond timescale associated with CDW melting. Most remarkably, the light-induced VBM downshift is observed exclusively in the CDW phase and only when the pump pulse is present, reaching maximum when pumping near resonance with the CDW gap. These observations unequivocally reveal the critical role of CDW in the Floquet engineering of TiSe$_2$. Our work demonstrates how time-periodic drives can synergistically couple to spatially periodic modulations to create non-equilibrium electronic states, establishing a new paradigm for Floquet engineering enabled by spontaneous symmetry breaking.

Title: GoodRegressor: A General-Purpose Symbolic Regression Framework for Physically Interpretable Materials Modeling
Authors: Seong-Hoon Jang
Abstract: GoodRegressor, a general-purpose, C++-based symbolic regression framework for interpretable materials modeling, is presented. The workflow consists of five modules, parser, designer, curator, regressor, and designer (as a post-process), that systematically explore descriptor combinations, nonlinear transformations, and interaction terms to construct compact and physically interpretable models. Applied to oxygen-ion conductors, the framework successfully predicts activation energies and Arrhenius prefactors with high accuracy ($R^2=0.804$ and $R^2=0.723$, respectively) and reveals clear physical trends linking ionic transport (particularly activation energy) to coordination environment, elastic moduli, and lattice flexibility. GoodRegressor bridges data-driven prediction and physical understanding, providing a transparent and extensible platform for symbolic regression applicable across diverse materials systems.

Title: Chemical States and Local Structure in Cu-Deficient CuInSe2 Thin Films: Insights into Engineering and Bandgap Narrowing
Authors: Ahmed Yousef Mohamed, Byoung Gun Han, Hyeonseo Jang, Jun Oh Jeon, Yejin Kim, Haeseong Jang, Min Gyu Kim, Kug-Seung Lee, Deok-Yong Cho
Abstract: The Cu-deficient CuxInSe2 (x larger than 0.3) phase can be stabilized as a thin film. A uniform Cu-deficient composition with a chalcopyrite structure was obtained by the precision engineering of a two-step synthesis process involving electron-beam evaporation and Se vapor deposition. Detailed structural and chemical analyses were performed employing various X-ray and microscopic techniques to demonstrate that the chemical states and local structure in the Cu-Se-In tetrahedral networks change with the loss of Cu, the In-Se bond becomes shorter, and the In ions become excessively oxidized without phase separation. Moreover, the results indicate that the bandgap narrowing is primarily attributed to the reconstruction of In3+d 5s orbital states. The bandgap narrows from 1.51 eV to 1.4 eV, which is optimal for the photon absorber. Therefore, cation-deficient selenide is promising for stable nontoxic photovoltaics with tunable bandgaps.

Abstract: Metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have had a profound impact on numerous emerging optoelectronic technologies, achieving performance metrics that rival or exceed incumbent materials. This impact is underpinned by the exceptional properties of MHPs, including tuneable band gaps, high absorption coefficients, long carrier diffusion lengths and combined with uncomplicated synthesis methods. However, current MHP production relies on the toxic solvents, which pose significant environmental and health risks. Moreover, these methods often require complex multi component solvent systems and thermal processing to achieve the desired material phases, further hindering scalability and sustainability. Overcoming these challenges is critical to the future development of MHP-based technologies. Overcoming these challenges is critical to the future development of MHP-based technologies. Here, we present a novel water-based solvent system and synthetic approach for the preparation of size-controlled CsPbBr3 perovskite nanocrystals in ambient air and at room temperature. The photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of CsPbBr3 erovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) exceeds 60 precent. To demonstrate the light to current conversion ability of our PNCs a series of photoconductors were prepared, with the best performing devices achieving a specific detectivity (D*) of 1.2 x 10^11 Jones. Thus, this green, scalable, and low-cost approach offers a sustainable pathway for precise size and compositional control of MHP nanocrystals, opening new possibilities for environmentally friendly optoelectronic applications.

Title: Dynamically generating superflow in a bosonic ring via phase imprinting
Authors: Ke-Ji Chen, Fan Wu
Abstract: Phase imprinting enables the dynamic generation of superflow in bosonic atoms, effectively overcoming traditional limitations such as vortex number constraints and heating effects. However, the mechanisms underlying superflow formation remain insufficiently understood. In this work, we reveal these mechanisms by studying the time evolution of the transferred total angular momentum and the quantized current throughout the phase imprinting process, achieved through numerically solving the time-dependent Schrödinger and Gross-Pitaevskii equations. We demonstrate that the Bose gas dynamically acquires angular momentum through the density depletion induced by the phase imprinting potential, whereas quantized currents emerge from azimuthal phase slips accompanied by complete density depletions. Regarding the impact of system parameters, such as interactions, we find that interactions hinder superflow formation, as the azimuthal density distribution becomes less susceptible to the phase imprinting potential. Our findings offer microscopic insights into the dynamic development of superflow during the phase imprinting process and provide valuable guidance for ongoing experimental efforts.

Title: KVASIR: A backscattering neutron spectrometer for hard condensed matter at ESS
Authors: Amalie F. Davidsen, Kristine M. L. Krighaar, Pascale P. Deen, and Kim Lefmann
Abstract: We present the instrument concept for KVASIR, a backscattering indirect time-of-flight neutron spectrometer for the European Spallation Source (ESS). KVASIR will probe low lying excitations of single crystal hard condensed matter that many advanced technologies rely upon. The instrument is simultaneously optimized for high resolution of energy-and momentum transfer, while ensuring perturbation by high magnetic fields. Detailed ray tracing simulations, considering the true geometry and aberrations of the analyser configuration have been performed. The proposed concept has room for polarisation analysis and extreme sample environments. Inelastic neutron scattering studies of single crystal hard condensed matter, with a particular focus on quantum, at yet unseen spatial and dynamic precision under extreme conditions are hereby enabled.

Title: Ideal Nodal-Sphere Semimetal in the Three-Dimensional Boron Allotrope CT-B$_{24}$
Authors: Xiao-jing Gao, Yanfeng Ge, Yan Gao
Abstract: Nodal-sphere semimetals (NSSMs), featuring spherical band degeneracies in momentum space, constitute a fascinating class of topological materials. However, their realization in real materials is severely hampered by discrete crystallographic symmetry constraints, often resulting in gapped ``pseudo'' nodal spheres. Here, combining first-principles calculations and symmetry analysis, we predict a new three-dimensional boron allotrope, CT-B$_{24}$, as a nearly ideal NSSM. Its structural stability is systematically confirmed by phonon calculations, \textit{ab initio} molecular dynamics simulations at 600~K, and elastic constant analysis. Notably, the electronic structure of CT-B$_{24}$ exhibits two bands crossing linearly near the Fermi level, forming a quasi-nodal sphere around the $\Gamma$ point. The maximum energy gap is merely 0.008~meV, which is two orders of magnitude smaller than the gaps reported in previous pseudo-NSSMs. Furthermore, the (001) surface hosts pronounced drumhead-like surface states located outside the projected nodal sphere, providing distinct signatures detectable by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). The nodal sphere also demonstrates remarkable robustness and tunability under external strain, driving a topological phase transition from an NSSM to a Dirac semimetal and finally to a trivial insulator. Our work not only presents a superior material platform for exploring nodal-sphere physics but also suggests potential for strain-tunable topological devices.

Title: Overparametrization bends the landscape: BBP transitions at initialization in simple Neural Networks
Authors: Brandon Livio Annesi, Dario Bocchi, Chiara Cammarota
Abstract: High-dimensional non-convex loss landscapes play a central role in the theory of Machine Learning. Gaining insight into how these landscapes interact with gradient-based optimization methods, even in relatively simple models, can shed light on this enigmatic feature of neural networks. In this work, we will focus on a prototypical simple learning problem, which generalizes the Phase Retrieval inference problem by allowing the exploration of overparametrized settings. Using techniques from field theory, we analyze the spectrum of the Hessian at initialization and identify a Baik-Ben Arous-Péché (BBP) transition in the amount of data that separates regimes where the initialization is informative or uninformative about a planted signal of a teacher-student setup. Crucially, we demonstrate how overparameterization can bend the loss landscape, shifting the transition point, even reaching the information-theoretic weak-recovery threshold in the large overparameterization limit, while also altering its qualitative nature. We distinguish between continuous and discontinuous BBP transitions and support our analytical predictions with simulations, examining how they compare to the finite-N behavior. In the case of discontinuous BBP transitions strong finite-N corrections allow the retrieval of information at a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) smaller than the predicted BBP transition. In these cases we provide estimates for a new lower SNR threshold that marks the point at which initialization becomes entirely uninformative.

Title: Granular fluid in an arbitrary external potential: spontaneous convection, self-phoresis
Authors: Alvaro Domínguez, Nagi Khalil
Abstract: The hydrodynamic stationary states of a granular fluid are addressed theoretically when subject to energy injection and a time-independent, but otherwise arbitrary external potential force. When the latter is not too symmetrical in a well defined sense, we show that a quiescent stationary state does not exist, rather than simply being unstable and, correspondingly, a steady convective state emerges spontaneously. We also unveil an unexpected connection of this feature with the self-diffusiophoresis of catalytically active particles: if an intruder in the granular fluid is the source of the potential, it will self-propel according to a recently proposed mechanism that lies beyond linear response theory, and that highlights the role of the intrinsic nonequilibrium nature of the state of the granular bath. In both scenarios, a state-dependent characteristic length of the granular fluid is identified which sets the scale at which the induced flow is the largest.

Title: Fingerprints of cluster-based Haldane and bound-magnon states in a spin-1 Heisenberg diamond chain
Authors: Azam Zoshki, Hamid Arian Zad, Katarina Karlova, Jozef Strecka
Abstract: We investigate magnetic and thermodynamic properties of a spin-1 Heisenberg diamond chain in a magnetic field using a combination of analytical and numerical methods including the variational approach, exact diagonalization, density-matrix renormalization group, localized-magnon theory, and quantum Monte Carlo simulations. In the unfrustrated regime, the model exhibits a quantum ferrimagnetic phase that captures key magnetic features of the nickel-based polymeric compound [Ni3(OH)2(C4H2O4)(H2O)4].2H2O such as a at minimum in the temperature dependence of the susceptibility times temperature product and an intermediate one-third magnetization plateau. In the frustrated regime, we uncover a rich variety of unconventional quantum phases including uniform and cluster-based Haldane states, fragmented monomer-dimer phase, and bound-magnon crystals. Analysis of the adiabatic temperature change and magnetic Gruneisen parameter reveals an enhanced magnetocaloric effect near field-induced transitions between these exotic quantum phases. Additionally, we demonstrate that the frustrated spin-1 diamond chain can operate as an efficient working medium of a quantum Stirling engine, which approaches near-optimal efficiency when driven into these unconventional quantum states.

Title: Robust Material Properties in Epitaxial In$_2$Te$_3$ Thin Films Across Varying Thicknesses
Authors: Maximilian Buchta, Felix Hoff, Lucas Bothe, Niklas Penner, Christoph Ringkamp, Thomas Schmidt, Timo Veslin, Ka Lei Mak, Jonathan Frank, Dasol Kim, Matthias Wuttig
Abstract: Sesqui-chalcogenides serve as a critical bridge between traditional semiconductors and quantum materials, offering significant potential in applications such as thermoelectrics, phase change memory, and topological insulators. While considerable attention has been focused on antimony- and bismuth-based compounds, characterized by substantial property changes upon reduction in film thickness, indium containing sesqui-chalcogenides like In$_2$Te$_3$ are emerging as promising candidates for photovoltaics and electronic devices. However, the effects of film thickness on the properties of In$_2$Te$_3$ remain largely unexplored. In this study, we investigate high-quality In$_2$Te$_3$ thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy on Si(111) substrates across a thickness range from 2.7 nm to 24 nm. We employ X-ray diffraction, reflective high-energy electron diffraction and atomic force microscopy to analyze both the crystal structure and film morphology. Additionally, we utilize broadband optical spectroscopy alongside femtosecond pump-probe measurements and Raman spectroscopy to assess optical and vibrational properties, respectively. Our analysis reveals that material properties exhibit minimal dependence on film thickness, contrasting sharply with behavior observed in other chalcogenides such as Sb$_2$Te$_3$, Bi$_2$Se$_3$, or GeTe. This phenomenon can be attributed to covalent bonding present in In$_2$Te$_3$, which differs from those in its antimony- and bismuth-containing counterparts.

Title: Persistence of Layer-Tolerant Defect Levels in ReS2
Authors: Nikhilesh Maity, Shibu Meher, Manoj Dey, Abhishek Kumar Singh
Abstract: Defects in two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors play a decisive role in determining their electronic, optical, catalytic and quantum properties. Understanding how defect energy levels respond to variations in layer thickness is essential for achieving reproducible and scalable device performance. We report the persistence of layer-tolerant defect levels in rhenium disulfide (ReS2), where both donor- and acceptor-type charge transition levels remain nearly unchanged from monolayer to bulk in both AA and AB stacking. The associated two-level quantum system also retains its character across thicknesses, enabling ReS2 to serve as a platform for layer-tolerant single-photon emitters. The invariance arises from the interplay between electronic energy minimization and structural relaxation, which together counteract quantum confinement and reduced dielectric screening. Additionally, the intrinsically weak interlayer coupling in ReS2 plays a crucial role. Our findings uncover the microscopic origin of this unique behavior, distinguishing ReS2 from other transitionmetal dichalcogenides and highlighting its potential for thickness-independent optoelectronic and quantum photonic applications.

Title: Uncovering critical temperature dependence in Heusler magnets via explicit machine learning
Authors: Jean-Baptiste Morée (1), Juba Bouaziz (1 and 2), Ryotaro Arita (2) ((1) RIKEN Center for Emergent Matter Science, Wako, Saitama, Japan, (2) Department of Physics, University of Tokyo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan)
Abstract: We employ interpretable explicit machine learning to analyze the material dependence of the magnetic transition temperature $T_c$ in ferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic Heusler compounds. For around 200 compounds, we consider both experimental $T_c$ and calculated $T_c$ using \textit{ab initio} determination of magnetic interactions together with a Monte-Carlo solution. We use the hierarchical dependence extraction (HDE) procedure [Morée and Arita, Phys. Rev. B 110, 014502 (2024)] to extract the dependencies of $T_c$ on chemical proportions and magnetic moments from the main order to the higher order, and construct an explicit expression of $T_c$ from these dependencies. The main results are: (a) $T_c$ is mainly controlled by the proportions of Fe, Co, and Mn, and increases with these proportions, consistent with previous machine learning analyses of ferromagnetic materials. (b) The HDE describes $T_c$ with an accuracy that is comparable to that of other machine learning procedures. (c) The HDE expression of $T_c$ can be interpreted as a generalized order parameter that increases with increasing magnetization amplitude, in qualitative agreement with various theories of phase transitions. These results strengthen our understanding of the material dependence of $T_c$ in collinear Heusler magnets and motivate the further use of HDE in material design.

Title: Semiconductor-Semimetal Transition in van der Waals Carbyne Crystals
Authors: Daniele Barettin, Stella V. Kavokina, Evgeny L. Ivchenko, Alexey V. Kavokin
Abstract: Freestanding van der Waals crystals made of single-atom carbon chains (car- bynes) have been recently realized technologically. Here we investigate their electronic and optical properties experimentally, by continuous-wave and time- resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy, and theoretically. Employing a fully three-dimensional tight-binding formalism benchmarked against density func- tional theory calculations we predict the semimetal-semiconductor transition to occur in van der Waals carbyne crystals composed by the chains of about 42 atoms long. The semiconductor phase is characterized by a hyperbolic van Hove singularity which gives rise to unconventional hyperbolic exciton states. Experi- mentally, we access the semiconductor phase, where resonant features associated with hyperbolic excitons are clearly visible. The exciton oscillator strength is found to be strongly sensitive to the length of carbon chains: our experiments show that it decreases with the increasing chain length. This tendency, con- firmed by the theoretical modeling, manifests the evolution of the hyperbolic exciton state on the way to the semiconductor-semimetal crossover. Our approach accounts for the actual crystalline geometry, including alternating intra-chain hoppings and inter-chain couplings. By fitting tight-binding dispersions to density functional theory data we extract consistent parameters and establish a com- prehensive framework for the physics of carbyne crystals. This study paves the way towards efficient band-gap engineering in ultimate one-dimensional carbon crystals.

Title: Fibonacci-Engineered Spin and Charge Thermoelectrics in a Long Range Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Chain: A Pathway to Giant Figure of Merit
Authors: Ranjini Bhattacharya, Souvik Roy
Abstract: In this work, we present a novel investigation into the spin-dependent thermoelectric performance of an extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, showcasing for the first time how its intrinsic spin filtration mechanism can be strategically harnessed to function as an efficient spin thermoelectric generator. By introducing a Fibonacci-type aperiodic modulation in the onsite energies, we engineer a deterministic disorder that mimics realistic aperiodic systems and profoundly influences transport characteristics. Furthermore, we incorporate both nearest-neighbor (NN) and next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) hopping amplitudes with tunable cosine dependencies, enabling us to meticulously explore the intricate interplay between these hopping processes and its implications on thermoelectric behavior. Our analysis reveals a remarkable enhancement in the dimensionless thermoelectric figure of merit ZT for both charge and spin transport channels, under carefully optimized conditions. Notably, the spin thermoelectric response exhibits distinct advantages, opening a new frontier in the design of next-generation thermoelectric materials and devices. This qualitative study not only deepens our understanding of aperiodic topological systems but also establish a foundational framework for exploiting spin-based thermoelectricity in low-dimensional platforms.

Title: Large deviations in the many-body localization transition: The case of the random-field XXZ chain
Authors: Greivin Alfaro Miranda, Fabien Alet, Giulio Biroli, Leticia F. Cugliandolo, Nicolas Laflorencie, Marco Tarzia
Abstract: The effect of rare system-wide resonances in the many-body localization (MBL) transition has recently attracted significant attention. They are expected to play a prominent role in the stability of the MBL phase, prompting the development of new theoretical frameworks to properly account for their statistical weight. We employ a method based on an analogy with mean-field disordered glassy systems to characterize the statistics of transmission amplitudes between distant many-body configurations in Hilbert space, and apply it to the random-field XXZ spin chain. By introducing a Lagrange multiplier, which formally plays the role of an effective temperature controlling the influence of extreme outliers in the heavy-tailed distribution of propagators, we identify three distinct regimes: (i) an ergodic phase with uniform spreading in Hilbert space, (ii) an intermediate regime where delocalization is driven by rare, disorder-dependent long-range resonances, and (iii) a robust MBL phase where such resonances cannot destabilize localization. We derive a finite-size phase diagram in the disorder--interaction plane both in the spin and in the Anderson basis that quantitatively agrees with recent numerical results based on real-space spin-spin correlation functions. We further demonstrate that even infinitesimal interactions can destroy the Anderson insulator at finite disorder, with the critical disorder remaining finite down to small interaction strengths. By visualizing resonant transmission pathways on the Hilbert space graph, we provide a complementary perspective to real-space and spectral probes, revealing how the destabilization of the MBL phase at finite sizes stems from the emergence of resonant paths that become progressively rarer and shorter-ranged deep in the localized phase.

Title: Stability Criteria and Optoelectronic Properties of Mg3ZBr3 (Z = As, Sb, Bi) Perovskites for Evaluating the Performance in PIN Photo Diode
Authors: Md Mohiuddin, Mohammed Mehedi Hasan, Alamgir Kabir
Abstract: The toxicity and stability issues of lead-based perovskites motivate the search for non-toxic, durable alternatives. This work examines lead-free $\mathrm{Mg_3ZBr_3}$ ($Z=\mathrm{As,Sb,Bi}$) halide perovskites as optoelectronic materials, with emphasis on $\mathrm{Mg_3AsBr_3}$ and $\mathrm{Mg_3SbBr_3}$. First-principles calculations establish cubic $Pm\bar{3}m$ frameworks stabilized by strong Mg--Br linkages, and indirect band gaps of $2.0645\,\mathrm{eV}$ for $\mathrm{Mg_3AsBr_3}$ and $1.6533\,\mathrm{eV}$ for $\mathrm{Mg_3SbBr_3}$ obtained using hybrid functionals. Optical spectra show a rapid rise in absorption above the gap and an increasing static dielectric response along $\mathrm{As}\rightarrow\mathrm{Sb}\rightarrow\mathrm{Bi}$, indicating strengthened light--matter coupling. Phonon dispersions lack imaginary branches, confirming dynamical stability, and exhibit large mode anharmonicity (Grüneisen signatures) consistent with soft-lattice heat transport. Moving down the pnictogen series expands the lattice and lowers the Goldschmidt tolerance factor, while enhanced pnictogen--Br $p$-orbital hybridization and stereochemically active $n\mathrm{s}^{2}$ lone pairs (Sb, Bi) narrow the band gap and increase the optical dielectric response. Elastic analyses confirm Born stability and moderate stiffness, with Hill-averaged bulk moduli decreasing from approximately $44\,\mathrm{GPa}$ ($\mathrm{Mg_3AsBr_3}$) to $35\,\mathrm{GPa}$ ($\mathrm{Mg_3BiBr_3}$). Drift--diffusion $p$--$i$--$n$ simulations qualitatively track band-edge-limited spectra, aligning with the computed gaps. Together, these results position these materials as promising lead-free candidates for stable thin-film photodiode and photovoltaic applications.

Title: Multiferroic-like Excitation in Ferroelectrics
Authors: Ping Tang, Gerrit E. W. Bauer
Abstract: Multiferroics are materials with coexisting electric and magnetic orders that are of central importance for fundamental research and applications in sensor and information technologies. However, intrinsic multiferroics that operate at room temperature remain rare due to an apparent incompatibility between magnetism and ferroelectricity. Here we predict that a pure ferroelectric hosts multiferroic-like quasiparticles that simultaneously carry \emph{static} magnetic and electric dipoles. The electric dipole moment emerges from the parity-odd anharmonicity of the ferroelectric dynamics, while the magnetic moment has both paramagnetic and diamagnetic origins generated by circularly polarized transverse fluctuations of the ferroelectric polarization. In contrast to the established ``dynamical multiferroicity" of conventional phonons, which involve only \emph{oscillating} electric dipoles, these ``multiferron" modes produce a colossal electric-field-tunable second-harmonic optical response as well as a magnetoelectric cross coupling. Multiferrons open a new route toward nonlinear THz optical applications and offer multiferroic functionalities in simple ferroelectrics.

Title: Defect Landscape of Orthorhombic Ba$_2$In$_2$O$_5$ from First-Principles Calculations: The Role of Oxygen Interstitials
Authors: Rachele Sciotto, Karsten Albe
Abstract: The brownmillerite-type oxide Ba$_2$In$_2$O$_5$ (BIO) is a potential candidate as an electrolyte material for mixed ionic-electronic conduction in solid oxide fuel cells. Despite its structural relation to perovskite oxides, the defect chemistry of BIO has remained largely unexplored. Using Density Functional Theory within the generalized gradient approximation, complemented by selected hybrid-functional calculations, we evaluate the formation energies, charge transition levels, and concentrations as a function of oxygen partial pressure of vacancies, oxygen interstitials, Frenkel pairs, and substitutional Cr doping. Our results reveal that oxygen vacancies and interstitials dominate the intrinsic defect landscape. Among the interstitials, we identify stable dumbbell configurations that remain neutral across the entire band gap. Other interstitial configurations show charged states and become the prevailing compensating defect at high oxygen partial pressures. For extrinsic doping, we find that Cr preferentially substitutes at the tetrahedral In site and behaves as a donor. Its negative formation energies suggest the formation of secondary phases, possibly the tetragonal Cr-doped BIO. These results provide a first picture of the thermodynamics of intrinsic and extrinsic defects in BIO and set the stage for future investigations into the tetragonal phase and the diffusion dynamics of oxygen vacancies and interstitials.

Title: First-Principles Investigation of Sr2PrSbO6 Double Perovskite: An Emerging Aspirant for Electrocatalysis, Plasmonic, Photonics, Thermoelectric and Solar Cell Applications
Authors: Md. Mohiuddin, Alamgir Kabir
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the structural properties, chemical stability, and electronic, optical, and thermoelectric properties of $\mathrm{Sr_2PrSbO_6}$ using first-principles calculations based on Density Functional Theory (DFT). The goal of this study is to evaluate its potential contribution to next-generation electrocatalysts, optoelectronic devices, and thermoelectric systems. The structural optimization reveals that $\mathrm{Sr_2PrSbO_6}$ crystallizes in a stable cubic perovskite structure with space group $Fm\bar{3}m$. The calculated formation energy indicates high thermodynamic stability, confirming the viability of $\mathrm{Sr_2PrSbO_6}$ for practical applications. The electronic band structure calculations show that $\mathrm{Sr_2PrSbO_6}$ is a wide bandgap semiconductor with a direct bandgap of $3.488~\mathrm{eV}$ at the $\Gamma$-point. The calculated density of states (DOS) indicates significant contributions from O $2p$, Sb $5p$, and Pr $5d$ orbitals. Optical property calculations, including the dielectric function and absorption coefficient, reveal strong absorption in the UV regions, making $\mathrm{Sr_2PrSbO_6}$ a promising candidate for optoelectronic applications such as UV light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and photovoltaic-thermoelectric (PV-TE) tandem systems. At room temperature, the calculated dimensionless quantity $ZT$ is $0.33$, which indicates this material as a possible candidate for thermoelectric applications. Our results will serve as a benchmark for future experimental and theoretical research on the properties of this material.

Title: Hamiltonian learning quantum magnets with dynamical impurity tomography
Authors: Netta Karjalainen, Greta Lupi, Rouven Koch, Adolfo O. Fumega, Jose L. Lado
Abstract: Nanoscale engineered spin systems, ranging from spins on surfaces to nanographenes, provide flexible platforms to realize entangled quantum magnets from a bottom up approach. However, assessing the quantum many-body Hamiltonian realized in a specific experiment remains an exceptional open challenge, due to the difficulty of disentangling competing terms accounting for the many-body excitations. Here, we demonstrate a machine learning strategy to learn a quantum many-body spin Hamiltonian from scanning spectroscopy measurements of spin excitations. Our methodology leverages the spatially-resolved reconstruction of the many-body excitations induced by depositing quantum impurities next to the quantum magnet. We demonstrate that our algorithm allows us to predict long-range Heisenberg exchange interactions, anisotropic exchange, as well as antisymmetric Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, including in the presence of sizable noise. Our methodology establishes defect-induced spatially-resolved dynamical excitations in quantum magnets as a powerful strategy to understand the nature of quantum spin many-body models.

Title: Donor doping-regulated dislocation plasticity across the length scale in SrTiO3
Authors: Chukwudalu Okafor, Kohei Takahara, Svetlana Korneychuk, Isabel Huck, Sebastian Bruns, Ruoqi Li, Yan Li, Karsten Durst, Atsutomo Nakamura, Xufei Fang
Abstract: Donor doping as a form of point defect engineering is a popular strategy for tuning the physical properties of functional oxides. The renewed interest in dislocation-tuned functional properties in ceramics requires a deeper understanding of point defect-dislocation interactions. Here, we study the room-temperature dislocation plasticity of donor-doped (0.05 wt% and 0.5 wt% Nb as dopants) single-crystal SrTiO3 across the length scale, using a combinatorial mechanical deformation approach including nanoindentation (nano-/microscale), Brinell indentation (mesoscale), and uniaxial bulk compression (macroscale). Compared to the nominally undoped sample, Nb-doped SrTiO3 exhibits higher nanoindentation pop-in load and lower indentation creep rates, suggesting less favored dislocation nucleation and motion. Under cyclic Brinell indentation, the discrete slip traces on the 0.5 wt% Nb-doped sample indicate suppressed dislocation multiplication. Extending to bulk compression, 0.5 wt% Nb-doped samples exhibit ~50% higher yield strength compared to that of the nominally undoped sample. We further validated the findings by comparing with an acceptor (Fe)-doped single crystal with equivalent doping concentrations. This length-scale bridging approach consistently reveals suppressed dislocation nucleation, multiplication, and motion in the 0.5 wt% Nb-doped samples. These insights underline the importance of dislocation-defect chemistry on the mechanical behavior of functional oxides.

Title: Non-Arrhenius Li-ion transport and grain-size effects in argyrodite solid electrolytes
Authors: Yongliang Ou, Lena Scholz, Sanath Keshav, Yuji Ikeda, Marvin Kraft, Sergiy Divinski, Rafael Gómez-Bombarelli, Wolfgang G. Zeier, Felix Fritzen, Blazej Grabowski
Abstract: Argyrodite solid electrolytes, such as Li$_6$PS$_5$Cl, exhibit some of the highest known superionic conductivities. Yet, the mechanistic understanding of Li$^+$ transport in realistic argyrodite microstructures -- where atomic-scale mechanisms interplay with continuum-scale dynamics at grain boundaries -- remains limited. Here, we resolve Li$^+$ transport in silico by developing accurate machine-learning potentials via closed-loop active learning and embedding the potentials in a multiscale modeling framework that integrates molecular dynamics with finite element simulations. We show that bulk diffusion barriers scale linearly with anion radius. Grain boundaries have opposite effects depending on the bulk -- enhancing Li$^+$ diffusion in low-diffusivity phases but suppressing it in fast-diffusing ones. Simulations of polycrystalline Li$_6$PS$_5$I reveal non-Arrhenius transport behaviors consistent with experiments. Grain-size-dependent predictions indicate that grain refinement improves intergranular contacts in argyrodites without compromising superionic conductivity, while nanosizing can activate ionic transport in electrolytes lacking intrinsic superionic behavior. Our findings highlight the decisive role of microstructure in developing solid electrolytes.

Title: Cavity modification of magnetoplasmon mode through coupling with intersubband polaritons

Abstract: We investigate the coupling of a multi-mode metal-insulator-metal cavity to a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in a quantum well in the presence of a strong magnetic field. The TM cavity mode is strongly hybridized with an intersubband transition of the 2DEG, forming a polaritonic mode in the ultrastrong coupling regime, while the TE mode remains an almost purely cavity mode. The magnetoplasmon excitation emerging from the presence of the magnetic field couples with both TM and TE modes, exhibiting different coupling strengths and levels of spatial field inhomogeneity. While the strong homogeneity of the bare TE mode gives rise to the standard anticrossing of strong coupling, the inhomogeneous polaritonic TM mode is shown to activate an observable Coulombic effect in the spectral response, often referred to as non-locality. This experiment demonstrates a cavity-induced modification of the 2DEG response and offers a new route to probing the effect of Coulomb interactions in ultrastrongly coupled systems via reshaping of their cavity mode profiles.

Abstract: Charge carriers in organic semiconductors form polarons, which are self-localized states stabilized by interactions with their environment. Using a dielectric-stabilized tight-binding model parameterized from first-principles calculations, we compute ground and excited polaron states in poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT). Our results quantitatively reproduce key mid-infrared absorption features, notably the chain-length-dependent shift of the intrachain polaron excitation peak (peak B) and its variation between regioregular and regiorandom P3HT. Comparison to an alternative stabilization mechanism based on local ring distortions reveals that dielectric polarization dominates polaron formation, as ring distortions yield insufficient binding and excitation energies inconsistent with experiments. These findings clarify the microscopic origin of polarons in conjugated polymers and provide a predictive framework linking polaron energetics to spectroscopic observables, advancing the understanding of charge transport in organic semiconductors.

Title: Hydrogen redistribution in Zr-base cladding under gradients in temperature and stress
Authors: Lars O. Jernkvist, Ali R. Massih
Abstract: Computational models are used here for simulating diffusion-controlled redistribution of hydrogen that is picked up by zirconium-base nuclear fuel cladding during light water reactor operation. Axial localization of hydrogen, leading to localized precipitation of zirconium hydrides at lower-temperature regions near interpellet gaps, is studied with a bespoke model, while radial diffusion, leading to formation of a densely hydrided rim subjacent to the waterside oxide layer, is studied with a more general model. The calculated results are compared with experimental observations and similar computational studies reported in the literature. The results underline the importance of hydrogen redistribution with regard to local embrittlement of the cladding tubes.

Title: Modulated symmetries from generalized Lieb-Schultz-Mattis anomalies
Authors: Hiromi Ebisu, Bo Han, Weiguang Cao
Abstract: Symmetries rigidly delimit the landscape of quantum matter. Recently uncovered spatially modulated symmetries, whose actions vary with position, enable excitations with restricted mobility, while Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) type anomalies impose sharp constraints on which lattice phases are realizable. In one dimensional a spin chain, gauging procedures have linked modulated symmetry to LSM type anomaly, but a general understanding beyond 1D remains incomplete. We show that spatially modulated symmetries and their associated dipole algebras naturally emerge from gauging ordinary symmetries in the presence of generalized LSM type anomalies. We construct explicit lattice models in two and three spatial dimensions and develop complementary field theoretic descriptions in arbitrary spatial dimensions that connect LSM anomaly inflow to higher-group symmetry structures governing the modulated symmetries. Our results provide a unified, nonperturbative framework that ties together LSM constraints and spatially modulated symmetries across dimensions.

Title: Geometric control of the moire twist angle in heterobilayer flakes
Authors: Prathap Kumar Jharapla, Nicolas Leconte, Zhiren He, Guru Khalsa, Jeil Jung
Abstract: We demonstrate a finite twist-angle stabilization mechanism in lattice-mismatched 2D heterobilayers, which results from the geometric alignment between the flake edges and its moire pattern. Using atomistic simulations of graphene on hexagonal boron nitride flakes with diameters of up to $\sim 2500$Å, we identify robust metastable angles at $\sim 0.61^\circ$ for armchair and $\sim1.89^\circ$ for zigzag-edged flakes, tunable via in-plane heterostrain. This locking mechanism, which relies on energy barriers that are an order of magnitude larger than those of nearby metastable twist angles, provides a geometric route to precision twist-angle control of two-dimensional heterostructures and to understand the self-orientation of macroscopic flakes.

Title: Tuning Superconductivity in Sputtered W0.75Re0.25 Thin Films
Authors: F. Colangelo, F. Avitabile, Z. Makhdoumi Kakhaki, A. Kumar, A. Di Bernardo, C. Bernini, A. Martinelli, A. Nigro, C. Cirillo, C. Attanasio
Abstract: W0.75Re0.25, in its bulk form, has been shown to be an interesting superconducting material due to its multiple crystalline phases, each exhibiting distinct superconducting characteristics. However, little is known about how these phases manifest in thin-film form, where deposition conditions and dimensionality are critical aspects. Here, we investigate superconducting W0.75Re0.25 thin films deposited via UHV dc magnetron sputtering. In order to tune the crystalline phase of the films, we further explored the effect of incorporating N2 during the deposition. The superconducting and normal-state properties as a function of deposition conditions were investigated, revealing the role of the crystal phase on the film transport properties.

Title: Extinction Coefficients of CdSe, CdS, and CdTe Nanoplatelets in Solution: A Practical Tool for Concentration Determination
Authors: Michael H. Stewart, Michael W. Swift, Farwa Awan, Liam Burke, Christopher M. Green, Barbara A. Marcheschi, Igor L. Medintz, Todd D. Krauss, Alexander L. Efros
Abstract: Semiconductor nanoplatelets possess exceptional optical properties that make them promising candidates for next-generation optoelectronic applications. However, unlike quantum dots where absorption spectroscopy alone can determine both size and concentration, nanoplatelets present a significant characterization challenge: the absorption peak position reveals only thickness, providing no information about lateral dimensions or concentration. This limitation forces researchers to rely on time-consuming and costly elemental analysis techniques for complete sample characterization. Here, we present an experimentally verified theoretical framework that predicts the frequency-dependent absorption coefficient of randomly oriented CdSe, CdS, and CdTe nanoplatelets, enabling concentration determination from absorption measurements and lateral size estimates. Our model shows that the integrated absorption coefficient depends universally on nanoplatelet surface area and thickness, yielding a practical tool to extract concentrations without laborious elemental analysis. This approach bridges the characterization gap between quantum dots and nanoplatelets, offering a streamlined method for rapid sample analysis that could accelerate nanoplatelet research and applications.

Title: Flat quasicrystalline tilings in terms of density wave approach
Authors: Aleksey S. Roshal, Olga V. Konevtsova, Sergei B. Rochal
Abstract: Classical Landau theory considers structural phase transitions and crystallization as a condensation of several critical density waves whose wave vectors are symmetrically equivalent. Analyzing the simplest nonequilibrium Landau potentials obtained for decagonal and dodecagonal cases, we derive constraints on the phases of the critical waves and deduce two pairs of flat tilings that are the simplest from the viewpoint of our theory. Each pair corresponds to the same irreducible interference pattern: the vertices of the first and second tilings are located at its minima and maxima, respectively. The first decagonal pair consists of the Penrose P1 tiling and the Tie and Navette one. The second pair is represented by dodecagonal tiling of squares, triangles, and shields, and previously unidentified one formed by regular dodecagons and identical deformed pentagons. Surprisingly, the proposed method for finding extrema of interference patterns provides a straightforward way to generate the Penrose tiling P3 and its more complicated analogues with 2n-fold symmetries. Within Landau theory, we discuss the assembly of the square-triangular tiling and its relationship with the dodecagonal tiling that includes shields. Then we develop a nonequilibrium assembly approach that is based on Landau theory and allows us to produce tilings with random phason strain characteristic of quasicrystals. Interestingly, the approach can generate tilings without or with a minimum number of defective tiles. Examples of real systems rationalized within Landau theory are considered as well. Finally, the derivation of other tilings arising from the reducible interference patterns is discussed, and the relative complexity of non-phenomenological interactions required for the assembly of decagonal and dodecagonal structures is analyzed.

Title: Interplay of Magnetism, Band Gap Tuning, Optical, and Thermoelectric Responses in Fe-Doped YMnO$_3$: Insights from First-Principles Calculations
Authors: Kazi Mazba Kamal, Alamgir Kabir
Abstract: The hexagonal multiferroic oxide YMnO$_3$ has demonstrated applications in various fields and is widely researched due to its interesting properties. Since Mn(3d)--O(2p) interactions predominate close to the Fermi level, doping in the B-site (Mn) with Fe provides a way to modulate the band gap and magnetic order of YMnO$_3$. The need for a lead-free ferroelectric material with a narrow band gap is crucial for absorbing a wide range of the solar spectrum. Density functional theory calculations were carried out using GGA and meta-GGA (for an accurate description of the band gap) exchange correlation functional for the Fe-doped YMnO$_3$ multiferroics. Various magnetic configurations were analyzed, finding collinear G-type AFM as the least energy state. The hexagonal lattice is retained after Fe doping with slight distortions and a change in lattice constants. Fe doping reduces spin frustration and induces magnetization, while reducing the band gap from 1.88 eV for pure to 1.19 eV for a 25 percent doping concentration. Additionally, Fe doping exhibits an enhanced dielectric response, characterized by an increase in the static dielectric constant and the presence of strong absorption peaks in the visible and UV energy ranges. Thermoelectric studies illustrate enhanced conductivity due to increased charge carriers induced by doping. In summary, first-principles predictions of structural, electronic, optical, and transport behavior in Fe-doped YMnO$_3$ provide a foundation for tailoring this oxide in photovoltaic, thermoelectric, and optoelectronic applications.

Title: Self-Consistent Model for Gate Control of Narrow-, Broken-, and Inverted-Gap (Topological) Heterostructures
Authors: Maximilian Hofer, Christopher Fuchs, Moritz Siebert, Christian Berger, Lena Fürst, Martin Stehno, Steffen Schreyeck, Hartmut Buhmann, Tobias Kießling, Wouter Beugeling, Laurens W. Molenkamp
Abstract: Even small electrostatic potentials can dramatically influence the band structure of narrow-, broken-, and inverted-gap materials. A quantitative understanding often necessitates a self-consistent Hartree approach. The valence and conduction band states strongly hybridize and/or cross in these systems. This makes distinguishing between electrons and holes impossible and the assumption of a flat charge carrier distribution at the charge neutrality point hard to justify. Consequently the wide-gap approach often fails in these systems. An alternative is the full-band envelope-function approach by Andlauer and Vogl, which has been implemented into the open-source software package kdotpy (arXiv:2407.12651). We show that this approach and implementation gives numerically stable and quantitatively accurate results where the conventional method fails by modeling the experimental subband density evolution with top-gate voltage in thick (26 nm - 110 nm), topologically inverted HgTe quantum wells. We expect our openly-available implementation to greatly benefit the investigation of narrow-, broken-, and inverted-gap materials.

Title: Fermi arcs for generic nodal points hosting monopoles or dipoles
Authors: Ipsita Mandal
Abstract: Fermi arcs represent the surface states at the boundary of a three-dimensional topological semimetal with the vacuum, illustrating the notion of bulk-boundary correspondence playing out in real materials. Their special character is tied up with the topological charges carried by the nodes of the semimetal in the momentum space, where two or more bands cross. In fact, they are constrained to begin and end on the perimeters of the projections of the Fermi surfaces of the bands tangentially, signalling their mixing with the bulk states. The number of Fermi arcs grazing onto the tangents of the outermost projection about a given node also reflects the magnitude of the charge at the node (equalling the Berry-curvature monopole), revealing the intrinsic topology of the underlying bandstructure, which can be visualised in experiments like ARPES. Here we take upon the task of unambiguously characterising the analytical structure of these states for generic nodal points, (1) whose degeneracy might be twofold or multifold; and (2) the associated bands might exhibit isotropic or anisotropic, linear- or nonlinear-in-momentum dispersion. Moreover, we also address the question of whether we should get any Fermi arcs at all for topological nodes carrying zero values of monopoles, but representing ideal dipoles.

Title: Scale-bridging dislocation plasticity in MgO at room temperature
Authors: Jiawen Zhang, Zhangtao Li, Yuwei Zhang, Hendrik Holz, James P. Best, Oliver Preuß, Zhenyong Chen, Yinan Cui, Xufei Fang, Wenjun Lu
Abstract: Dislocations in ceramics have gained renewed research interest contrasting the traditional belief that ceramics are brittle. Understanding dislocation mechanics in representative oxides is beneficial for effective dislocation engineering. Here, we use MgO single crystals with mechanically seeded dislocation densities from ~10^12 to ~10^15 m-2 to investigate the mechanical behavior such as yield and fracture. Nano-/micro-pillar compression tests reveal a dislocation density-dependent yield strength, mediated by the varying dominating dislocation mechanisms from nucleation to multiplication/motion. The dislocation-seeded samples can achieve a much-improved compressive plastic strain beyond ~70%, with a high yield strength of ~2.35 GPa (diameter of ~400 nm). Complementary bulk compression tests, along with digital image correlation (DIC), demonstrate a consistent dislocation-mediated deformation and a notable size effect, with bulk samples exhibiting much reduced yield strength (~120 MPa) compared to the nano-/micro-pillars. Using three-dimensional Discrete Dislocation Dynamics (3D-DDD) simulation, we further underline the dislocation avalanche and work hardening during compression. This study provides new insights into dislocation-mediated plasticity in MgO across the length scale with tunable dislocation densities.

Title: Vector spin polarization evolution determined in an entangled muon-fluorine system under pulsed excitation
Authors: Dipranjan Chatterjee, Benjamin M. Huddart, Hank C. H. Wu, Dharmalingam Prabhakaran, Alex Louat, Stephen P. Cottrell, Stephen J. Blundell
Abstract: A spin-polarized muon implanted into a fluoride forms a coupled F--$\mu$--F complex in which the muon spin and neighbouring fluorine nuclear spins become entangled. Here we apply radio-frequency (RF) excitation to this coupled system and use the three-dimensional distribution of emitted positrons to reconstruct the time-dependent evolution of the muon spin polarization. This three-dimensional readout, using single spin detection, is not possible in a single NMR experiment and demonstrates significant advantages that are achieved by using RF muon techniques. We demonstrate the application of this vector-readout method to the experimental observation of a muon spin echo signal that is controlled by the dipolar coupling to fluorine, as well as to a double resonance experiment, in which we use pulses tuned to separate frequencies to address both the muon and fluorine spins. This targeted approach, in which selective RF pulses can control the muon spin and other spins to which it is coupled, provides a novel route for probing systems of entangled spins.

Title: An Encoder-Decoder Foundation Chemical Language Model for Generative Polymer Design
Authors: Harikrishna Sahu, Wei Xiong, Anagha Savit, Shivank S Shukla, Rampi Ramprasad
Abstract: Traditional machine learning has advanced polymer discovery, yet direct generation of chemically valid and synthesizable polymers without exhaustive enumeration remains a challenge. Here we present polyT5, an encoder-decoder chemical language model based on the T5 architecture, trained to understand and generate polymer structures. polyT5 enables both property prediction and the targeted generation of polymers conditioned on desired property values. We demonstrate its utility for dielectric polymer design, seeking candidates with dielectric constant >3, bandgap >4 eV, and glass transition temperature >400 K, alongside melt-processability and solubility requirements. From over 20,000 generated promising candidates, one was experimentally synthesized and validated, showing strong agreement with predictions. To further enhance usability, we integrated polyT5 within an agentic AI framework that couples it with a general-purpose LLM, allowing natural language interaction for property prediction and generative design. Together, these advances establish a versatile and accessible framework for accelerated polymer discovery.

Title: Instabilities of a Generalized Gross-Neveu Quantum Criticality
Authors: Jaewon Kim
Abstract: We study the instabilities to the conformal critical point of an exactly solvable family of Gross-Neveu models. Using conformal field theory techniques, we construct the zero-temperature phase diagram and identify the superconducting and ferromagnetic phases that destabilize the critical point. Both instabilities appear only when the fermions are strongly renormalized, above a critical anomalous dimension. A higher fermion anomalous dimension also raises the critical degree of time-reversal-symmetry breaking required to suppress superconductivity, indicating that pairing becomes more robust with stronger renormalization.

Title: Micromechanical characterisation of osteoarthritic subchondral bone by micropillar compression
Authors: Samuel McPhee, Marta Peña Fernández, Lekha Koria, Marlène Mengoni, Rainer J Beck, Jonathan D Shephard, Claire Brockett, Uwe Wolfram
Abstract: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a multifaceted joint disease which poses significant socioeconomic burdens and remains a significant clinical challenge. Evidence suggests that structural and mechanical changes in subchondral bone influence the pathogenesis and development of OA, leading to diminished bone quality and cartilage degeneration. While changes in microstructure and tissue scale elastic properties are well reported, the tissue yield response of subchondral bone in OA and their correlation with compositional changes have not been investigated. Here, we performed quasistatic micropillar compression and nanoindentation within the subchondral bone plate and trabeculae of hydrated non-diseased (ND) and OA affected specimens retrieved from the distal tibia in vivo. The micropillars, extracted by laser ablation, exhibited a taper angle which mandated the use of an in silico micropillar compression routine to back-calculate elastic modulus and strength of the bone tissue that comprised each micropillar. Elastic modulus remained unchanged between ND and OA subchondral bone, whereas strength increased from 46.0 MPa to 57.3 MPa in OA subchondral trabecular bone but not in the bone plate. Micropillar matched Raman spectroscopy and quantitative backscattered electron imaging revealed mineralisation is the underlying determinant of elastic modulus and strength at the microscale. By combining micromechanical and tissue compositional analyses, we investigated how the mechanical properties are related and how these properties are affected in subchondral bone by OA. Our results may be of value in the development and optimisation of interventions used to alleviate the socioeconomic burdens associated with this debilitating joint disease.

Title: Frequency multiplication in Terahertz band using AlGaN/GaN plasmonic crystals
Authors: Michael Shur, Gregory Aizin
Abstract: The plasma oscillations in high-mobility field-effect transistors (HEMTs) have emerged as a key physical mechanism for manipulating electromagnetic radiation in the sub-terahertz (sub-THz) and THz frequency ranges. These collective electron excitations can be excited and tuned electrically offering a compelling route to compact, integrable components for a wide range of next-generation technologies, including sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks, high-resolution biomedical and chemical spectroscopy, industrial process monitoring, and advanced security and defense systems. For these applications, plasmonic crystals -- periodic arrays of many strongly coupled FET channels-- are particularly promising. In this work, we report on a new class of collective excitations in plasmonic crystals termed rotonic plasmons, which arise at plasmonic mode crossings and exhibit a parabolic dispersion law reminiscent of soft-mode and roton-like spectra. We show that uniform gate modulation across plasmonic crystal unit cells induces periodic variations in the sheet carrier concentration and, consequently, in the plasma frequency. This time-periodic modulation drives nonlinear plasmonic parametric resonances enabling RF-to-THz conversion. By solving the generalized Mathieu equation with damping, we demonstrate that high-amplitude gate pumping enables frequency multiplication and, at cryogenic temperatures (77K) leads to parametric instabilities due to enhanced electron mobility. In plasmonic crystals with lower mobility, RF-to-THz conversion can instead be realized via periodic short-pulse excitation, a regime we introduce as Time-Domain Frequency Multiplication (TDFM). Investigation of AlGaN/GaN low-high plasmonic crystals confirm their potential as tunable, compact THz sources.

Title: Impact of Switching Layer Architecture on Power Consumption in RRAM
Authors: John F. Hardy II, Jack A. Garrard, Guilherme S.Y. Giardini, Carlo R. daCunha
Abstract: This work demonstrates that porous helical WOx architectures enable a distinct low-power regime for planar ITO/WOx/ITO resistive random-access devices. While thin film and helical devices behave similarly at a 5 mA compliance, only helical devices sustain reproducible operation at 500 uA, where RESET voltages reduce by ~60%, switching currents decrease by 68-75%, and SET/RESET power drops by ~89% and ~83%. With helical devices operating at 500 uA, the memory window expands 400-600% due to selective suppression of high- resistive-state leakage, yielding both lower-power and improved read margin in a regime inaccessible to thin film devices. These results highlight geometry-driven field enhancement and confinement as practical design principles for low-power, high-margin resistive memories and point toward opportunities in transparent, flexible, and high-surface-area material systems.

Title: Evolve with Your Research - Stepwise System Evolution from Document-driven to Fact-centric Research Data Management in Materials Science
Authors: Victor Dudarev, Alfred Ludwig
Abstract: The digitalisation of research requires data management systems capable of supporting a broad spectrum of usage scenarios, ranging from document-oriented repositories to fully factographic environments. This paper introduces a methodological approach for the stepwise development of such systems, illustrated by the MatInf Research Data Management System (RDMS). The proposed framework combines a graph-based STAR paradigm-emphasising Statefulness, Traceability, Aim, and Result-with the SET methodology, which enables systematic Standardisation, Extraction, and Testing of research data. Together, these principles provide a pathway towards FAIR-compliant data infrastructures, facilitating reproducibility, re-use, and integration of heterogeneous materials science data. By demonstrating the gradual consolidation of research outputs into unified datasets, this study highlights how adaptive RDMS design can support accelerated scientific discovery and enhance collaborative research in large-scale projects.

Title: Water wave scattering by a surface-mounted rectangular anisotropic elastic plate
Authors: Ben Wilks, Michael H. Meylan, Zachary J. Wegert, Vivien J. Challis, Ngamta Thamwattana
Abstract: Piezoelectric plates, which become electrically polarised in response to bending, have recently been proposed for water wave energy conversion. However, piezoelectric materials (e.g. Polyvinylidene Fluoride) can be anisotropic, which makes them challenging to model in three dimensions. This paper considers the simpler problem of water wave scattering by an anisotropic elastic plate, i.e., the piezoelectric effect is ignored. The problem is obtained as an expansion over the elastic plate modes. In turn, the component diffraction and radiation problems are solved by formulating a boundary integral equation and solving numerically using a constant panel method. The results are presented to highlight the resonant responses of the plate under different forcing scenarios. In particular, we illustrate how the excitation of certain modes can be forbidden due to symmetry. Although not considered in this paper, the method we present is applicable to piezoelectric plates, and thereby facilitates the extension of piezoelectric wave energy converter models to the three dimensional water wave setting.

Title: Graphical model for tensor factorization by sparse sampling
Authors: Angelo Giorgio, Riki Nagasawa, Shuta Yokoi, Tomoyuki Obuchi, Hajime Yoshino
Abstract: We consider tensor factorizations based on sparse measurements of the tensor components. The measurements are designed in a way that the underlying graph of interactions is a random graph. The setup will be useful in cases where a substantial amount of data is missing, as in recommendation systems heavily used in social network services. In order to obtain theoretical insights on the setup, we consider statistical inference of the tensor factorization in a high dimensional limit, which we call as dense limit, where the graphs are large and dense but not fully connected. We build message-passing algorithms and test them in a Bayes optimal teacher-student setting. We also develop a replica theory, which becomes exact in the dense limit,to examine the performance of statistical inference.

Title: Charged liquid surface instabilities and detection of Solar neutrino by XENONnT
Authors: Sergey Pereverzev
Abstract: Announcement of detection of Solar 8B neutrinos by XENONnT dual-phase detector come with a suite of unexplained detector effects. We expect accumulation of surface charges and charged surface instability resulting in maximal surface elevation and charge density at wire crossing regions, where anomalies were observed. Thou data from these regions were excluded from analysis, surface distortions and charges are present everywhere, which can lead to large systematic errors in small signal detection.

Title: Experimental preparation of W states through many-body physics on a quantum simulator
Authors: Alberto Giuseppe Catalano, Ceren Dağ, Gianpaolo Torre, Salvatore Marco Giampaolo, Fabio Franchini
Abstract: $W$ states are quantum correlated states possessing both bipartite and multipartite entanglement, which makes them useful for several quantum algorithms. We propose a protocol to generate these states by exploiting {\it topological ring frustration}, and implement it on a programmable Rydberg atom array up to 11 qubits, successfully generating many-body $W$ states of Rubidium atoms. Numerical simulations show promising scaling of the algorithm to tens of qubits with near-term achievable updates on the quantum machines. To validate our state preparation protocol and probe quantum entanglement, we devise a fidelity estimator that requires only two sets of measurements. To implement it, we develop a novel and efficient Bayesian state-tomography approach that takes advantage of accurate classical numerical simulations to overcome limitations in the experimental setup. Hence, a lower bound fidelity of around $77\%$ is certified for the experimentally prepared state of 11 qubits. This work provides a state-of-the-art procedure to generate high-quality quantum entangled $W$ states, demonstrating once more how principles of physics can overcome traditional barriers of computation, and be exploited for quantum advantage.

Title: Committors without Descriptors
Authors: Peilin Kang, Jintu Zhang, Enrico Trizio, TingJun Hou, Michele Parrinello
Abstract: The study of rare events is one of the major challenges in atomistic simulations, and several enhanced sampling methods towards its solution have been proposed. Recently, it has been suggested that the use of the committor, which provides a precise formal description of rare events, could be of use in this context. We have recently followed up on this suggestion and proposed a committor-based method that promotes frequent transitions between the metastable states of the system and allows extensive sampling of the process transition state ensemble. One of the strengths of our approach is being self-consistent and semi-automatic, exploiting a variational criterion to iteratively optimize a neural-network-based parametrization of the committor, which uses a set of physical descriptors as input. Here, we further automate this procedure by combining our previous method with the expressive power of graph neural networks, which can directly process atomic coordinates rather than descriptors. Besides applications on benchmark systems, we highlight the advantages of a graph-based approach in describing the role of solvent molecules in systems, such as ion pair dissociation or ligand binding.

Title: Information geometry of nonmonotonic quantum natural gradient
Authors: Hideyuki Miyahara
Abstract: Natural gradient is an advanced optimization method based on information geometry, where the Fisher metric plays a crucial role. Its quantum counterpart, known as quantum natural gradient (QNG), employs the symmetric logarithmic derivative (SLD) metric, one of the quantum Fisher metrics. While quantization in physics is typically well-defined via the canonical commutation relations, the quantization of information-theoretic quantities introduces inherent arbitrariness. To resolve this ambiguity, monotonicity has been used as a guiding principle for constructing geometries in physics, as it aligns with physical intuition. Recently, a variant of QNG, which we refer to as nonmonotonic QNG in this paper, was proposed by relaxing the monotonicity condition. It was shown to achieve faster convergence compared to conventional QNG. In this paper, we investigate the properties of nonmonotonic QNG. To ensure the paper is self-contained, we first demonstrate that the SLD metric is locally optimal under the monotonicity condition and that non-monotone quantum Fisher metrics can lead to faster convergence in QNG. Previous studies primarily relied on a specific type of quantum divergence and assumed that density operators are full-rank. Here, we explicitly consider an alternative quantum divergence and extend the analysis to non-full-rank cases. Additionally, we explore how geometries can be designed using Petz functions, given that quantum Fisher metrics are characterized through them. Finally, we present numerical simulations comparing different quantum Fisher metrics in the context of parameter estimation problems in quantum circuit learning.

Title: Entanglement Spectrum Resolved by Loop Symmetries
Authors: Haruki Yagi, Zongping Gong
Abstract: A rigorous analysis is presented for the entanglement spectrum of quantum many-body states possessing a higher-form group-representation symmetry generated by topological Wilson loops, which is generally non-invertible. A general framework based on elementary algebraic topology and category theory is developed to determine the block structure of reduced density matrices for arbitrary bipartite manifolds on which the states are defined. Within this framework, we scrutinize the impact of topology on the entanglement structure for low-dimensional manifolds, including especially the torus, the Klein bottle, and lens spaces. By further incorporating gauge invariance, we refine our framework to determine the entanglement structure for topological gauge theories in arbitrary dimensions. In particular, in two dimensions, it is shown for the Kitaev quantum double model that not only the topological entanglement entropy can be reproduced, but also the Li-Haldane conjecture concerning the full entanglement spectrum holds exactly.

Title: Coherence-induced deep thermalization transition in random permutation quantum dynamics
Authors: Chang Liu, Matteo Ippoliti, Wen Wei Ho
Abstract: We report a phase transition in the projected ensemble - the collection of post-measurement wavefunctions of a local subsystem obtained by measuring its complement. The transition emerges in systems undergoing random permutation dynamics, a type of quantum time evolution wherein computational basis states are shuffled without creating superpositions. It separates a phase exhibiting deep thermalization, where the projected ensemble is distributed over Hilbert space in a maximally entropic fashion (Haar-random), from a phase where it is minimally entropic ("classical bit-string ensemble"). Crucially, this deep thermalization transition is invisible to the subsystem's density matrix, which always exhibits thermalization to infinite-temperature across the phase diagram. Through a combination of analytical arguments and numerical simulations, we show that the transition is tuned by the total amount of coherence injected by the input state and the measurement basis, and is exhibited robustly across different microscopic models. Our findings represent a novel form of ergodicity-breaking universality in quantum many-body dynamics, characterized not by a failure of regular thermalization, but rather by a failure of deep thermalization.

Title: Multi-entropy from Linking in Chern-Simons Theory
Authors: Ma-Ke Yuan, Mingyi Li, Yang Zhou
Abstract: We study the multipartite entanglement structure of quantum states prepared by the Euclidean path integral over three-manifolds with multiple torus boundaries (the so-called link states) in both Abelian and non-Abelian Chern-Simons theories. For three-component link states in the Abelian theory, we derive an explicit formula for the Rényi multi-entropy in terms of linking numbers. We further show that the genuine multi-entropy faithfully quantifies the tripartite entanglement generated by GHZ-states, consistent with the fact that the prepared states are stabilizer states.

Title: Multiscale transitional flow in anisotropic nanoparticle suspensions revealed by time-resolved x-ray scatter microscopy
Authors: Kesavan Sekar, Viney Ghai, Reza Ghanbari, Marko Bek, Marianne Liebi, Aleksandar Matic, Ann E. Terry, Kim Nygård, Roland Kádár
Abstract: Complex fluids transition from laminar to transitory flow above a critical control parameter, akin to their Newtonian counterparts. In a continuum mechanics sense, fluid elements follow the ensuing complex trajectories, giving rise to secondary flows in terms of macroscopic vortices and patterns thereof. However, if we replace idealized fluid elements with actual anisotropic nanoparticles, would their trajectories still reveal the same spatiotemporal behavior as the macroscopic flow field? This question is fundamental for complex fluids, where fully developed turbulence is suppressed by high viscosities and where understanding particle-flow coupling is central to transport, processing, and structure formation. To address this question, we develop small-angle x-ray scatter microscopy of unprecedented temporal resolution combined with polarized light imaging, thereby bridging seven orders of magnitude in lengtscales. Proof-of-principle is demonstrated on a classical stability problem, Taylor-Couette flow, of platelet-like graphene oxide nanoparticle and rod-like cellulose nanocrystal suspensions. The analysis shows hitherto hidden, markedly different multiscale dynamics underlying flow stability; while the platelet-like particles follow the wavy motion of the macroscopic, secondary flow field, the rod-like particles exhibit high-frequency motion that is uncorrelated with the vortex instabilities.

Title: Covariant field theory of 3D massive fractons
Authors: Erica Bertolini, Matteo Carrega, Nicola Maggiore, Daniel Sacco Shaikh
Abstract: We construct a covariant and gauge-invariant theory describing massive fractons in three spacetime dimensions, based on a symmetric rank-2 tensor field. The model includes a Chern-Simons-like term that plays a dual role: it generates a topological mass for the tensor gauge field and simultaneously acts as a source of intrinsic fractonic matter. This dual mechanism is novel and leads to a propagating fractonic degree of freedom described by a massive Klein-Gordon equation. The theory propagates two degrees of freedom -- one massive, one massless -- whose number is preserved in the massless limit, in analogy with the Maxwell-Chern-Simons mechanism of Deser-Jackiw-Templeton. We analyze the resulting equations of motion and show that the intrinsic fractonic matter satisfies Gauss- and Ampère-like laws, with conserved dipole and trace of the quadrupole moment. Upon coupling to external matter, a second fractonic sector emerges, leading to a coexistence of intrinsic and extrinsic subsystems with different mobility and conservation properties. Our model provides a unified framework for describing massive fractons with internal structure, and offers a covariant setting for exploring their interactions and extensions.

Title: Inheritance entropy quantifies epigenetic regulation of cell-cycle exit in human bone marrow stromal cells

Grigera, Stefania Melillo, Biagio Palmisano, Leonardo Parisi, Lorena Postiglione, Mara Riminucci, Francesco Saverio Rotondi
Abstract: Human bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) include skeletal stem cells with ground-breaking therapeutic potential. However, BMSC colonies have very heterogeneous in vivo behaviour, due to their different potency; this unpredictability is the greatest hurdle to the development of skeletal regeneration therapies. Colony-level heterogeneity urges a fundamental question: how is it possible that one colony as a collective unit behaves differently from another one? If cell-to-cell variability were just an uncorrelated random process, a million cells in a transplant-bound colony would be enough to yield statistical homogeneity, hence washing out any colony-level traits. A possible answer is that the differences between two originating cells are transmitted to their progenies and collectively persist through an hereditary mechanism. But non-genetic inheritance remains an elusive notion, both at the experimental and at the theoretical level. Here, we prove that heterogeneity in the lineage topology of BMSC clonal colonies is determined by heritable traits that regulate cell-cycle exit. The cornerstone of this result is the definition of a novel entropy of the colony, which measures the hereditary ramifications in the distribution of inactive cells across different branches of the proliferation tree. We measure the entropy in 32 clonal colonies, obtained from single-cell lineage tracing experiments, and show that in the greatest majority of clones this entropy is decisively smaller than that of the corresponding non-hereditary lineage. This result indicates that hereditary epigenetic factors play a major role in determining cycle exit of bone marrow stromal cells.

Title: Optimal quantum learning in proximity to universality
Authors: Moein N. Ivaki, Matias Karjula, Tapio Ala-Nissila
Abstract: The boundary between classically simulable and computationally superior quantum systems is fundamental to identifying true quantum advantage. We investigate this within the framework of quantum reservoir computing by introducing a tunable $N$-qubit random circuit model, where a fraction $p$ of Clifford gates are probabilistically substituted with nonstabilizing conditional-$\hat{T}$ gates. We establish a direct correspondence between the reservoir's performance on temporal processing tasks and its entanglement spectrum statistics and long-range nonstabilizer resource content. To assess scalability, we study the scaling of the anti-flatness of states in the large-$N$ limit at a fixed circuit depth ratio $d/N \sim \mathcal{O}(1)$. This is taken as a witness to concentration of measures, a known impediment to learning in thermalizing systems. We demonstrate that the learnability and scalability of the reservoir can be continuously controlled by the parameter $p$, allowing us to navigate from classically tractable to maximally expressive quantum dynamics. These architecture-agnostic results offer a general strategy for designing powerful and trainable quantum machine learning systems and clarify the physical resources underpinning quantum computational advantage.

Title: Mechanical activity enables patterning and discrimination at the immune synapse
Authors: Tony Wong, Tom Chou, Suraj Shankar, Shenshen Wang
Abstract: Immune cells recognize and discriminate antigens through immunological synapses - dynamic intercellular junctions exhibiting highly organized receptor-ligand patterns. While much work has focused on molecular kinetics and passive mechanisms of pattern formation, the role of active mechanical control in patterning and discrimination remains underexplored. We develop a minimal continuum model coupling receptor binding kinetics, membrane deformation, and cytoskeletal forces, with elastohydrodynamic flow in the synaptic cleft. Numerical simulations and scaling analysis reveal that contractile cortical flows arrest coarsening and stabilize long-lived multifocal clusters, whereas active pulling accelerates cluster dissolution and elevates background receptor binding. Nonequilibrium mechanical forces enable adaptive control over the speed, sensitivity, and dynamic range of affinity discrimination in a pattern-dependent manner. Our results highlight how immune cells exploit cytoskeletal remodeling to robustly regulate antigen recognition through synaptic patterning.

Title: Sharp Transitions for Subsystem Complexity
Authors: Yale Fan, Nicholas Hunter-Jones, Andreas Karch, Shivan Mittal
Abstract: The circuit complexity of time-evolved pure quantum states grows linearly in time for an exponentially long time. This behavior has been proven in certain models, is conjectured to hold for generic quantum many-body systems, and is believed to be dual to the long-time growth of black hole interiors in AdS/CFT. Achieving a similar understanding for mixed states remains an important problem. In this work, we study the circuit complexity of time-evolved subsystems of pure quantum states. We find that for greater-than-half subsystem sizes, the complexity grows linearly in time for an exponentially long time, similarly to that of the full state. However, for less-than-half subsystem sizes, the complexity rises and then falls, returning to low complexity as the subsystem equilibrates. Notably, the transition between these two regimes occurs sharply at half system size. We use holographic duality to map out this picture of subsystem complexity dynamics and rigorously prove the existence of the sharp transition in random quantum circuits. Furthermore, we use holography to predict features of complexity growth at finite temperature that lie beyond the reach of techniques based on random quantum circuits. In particular, at finite temperature, we argue for an additional sharp transition at a critical less-than-half subsystem size. Below this critical value, the subsystem complexity saturates nearly instantaneously rather than exhibiting a rise and fall. This novel phenomenon, as well as an analogous transition above half system size, provides a target for future studies based on rigorous methods.

Title: Oscillatory and dissipative dynamics of complex probability in non-equilibrium stochastic processes
Authors: Anwesha Chattopadhyay
Abstract: For a Markov and stationary stochastic process described by the well-known classical master equation, we introduce complex transition rates instead of real transition rates to study the pre-thermal oscillatory behaviour in complex probabilities. Further, for purely imaginary transition rates we obtain persistent infinitely long lived oscillations in complex probability whose nature depends on the dimensionality of the state space. We also take a peek into cases where we perturb the relaxation matrix for a dichotomous process with an oscillatory drive where the relative sign of the angular frequency of the drive decides whether there will be dissipation in the complex probability or not.

Title: Unraveling Intertwined Orders in the Strongly Correlated Kagome Metal CsCr3Sb5
Authors: Liangyang Liu, Yidian Li, Hengxin Tan, Yi Liu, Kuanglv Sun, Ying Shi, Yuxin Zhai, Hao Lin, Guanghan Cao, Xianhui Chen, Tao Wu, Binghai Yan, Guang-Ming Zhang, Luyi Yang
Abstract: While correlated phenomena of flat bands have been extensively studied in twisted systems, the ordered states that emerge from interactions in the intrinsic flat bands of kagome lattice materials remain largely unexplored. The newly discovered kagome metal CsCr3Sb5 offers a unique and rich platform for this research, as its multi-orbital flat bands at the Fermi surface result in a complex interplay of pressurized superconductivity, antiferromagnetism, a structural phase transition, and density wave orders. Here, using ultrafast optical techniques, we provide strong spectroscopic evidence for a charge density wave transition in CsCr3Sb5, resolving previous ambiguities. Crucially, we identify rotational symmetry breaking that manifests as a three-state Potts-type nematicity. Our elastoresistance measurements directly demonstrate the electronic origin of this order, as the rotational-symmetry-breaking E2g component of the elastoresistance shows a divergent behaviour around the transition temperature. This exotic nematicity results from the lifting of degeneracy of the multi-orbital flat bands, akin to phenomena seen in certain iron-based superconductors. Our study pioneers the investigation of ultrafast dynamics in flat-band systems at the Fermi surface, offering new insights into the interactions between multiple elementary excitations in strongly correlated systems.

Title: {\it Ab initio} study of orbital-selective superconductivity in $γ$-BiPd
Authors: Sonu Prasad Keshri, Guang-Yu Guo
Abstract: We investigate the superconducting (SC) properties of experimentally realised $\gamma$-BiPd by solving the anisotropic Migdal-Eliashberg equations in conjunction with {\it ab initio} relativistic calculations of the electron and phonon band structures as well as electron-phonon coupling (EPC) matrix elements. Our study reveals that $\gamma$-BiPd possesses a complex Fermi surface (FS), consisting of two electron pockets and one hole pocket, each characterised by distinct atomic orbitals. Our key finding is that the superconductivity in $\gamma$-BiPd is primarily orbital-selective, arising from Bi $p$-orbitals, and distributed anisotropically on the FS, although contribution from Pd $d$-orbitals, particularly on the hole pocket, is also discernable. While our results show an anisotropic nature of the {\bf k}-dependent SC gap $\Delta_{\bf k}$ and EPC strength $\lambda_{\bf k}$ across the FS, calculated superconducting quasiparticle density of states $N_S$ spectra exhibit a U-shaped gap and $\Delta_{\bf k}$ distribution forms a single peak, being consistent with the spin-singlet $s$-wave superconductivity observed in this material. The calculated $T_c$ is $\sim$2.0 K, agreeing in order of magnitude with the experimental value of 3.3 K in $\gamma$-BiPd thin films. The predicted EPC-enhanced Sommerfeld coefficient $\gamma_n$ of $0.141$ mJ/K$^2$cm$^3$ is similar to the experimental $\gamma_n$ value ($0.119$ mJ/K$^2$cm$^3$) of the isoelectronic and isostructural Bi(Pd$_{0.5}$Pt$_{0.5}$) alloy.

Title: Minimal dissipation with viscoelastic baths in weakly driven processes
Authors: Pierre Nazé, Fabricio Q. Potiguar
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamics of overdamped systems weakly driven by time-dependent protocols while interacting with viscoelastic heat baths. Using a generalized Langevin equation with memory, we derive the conditions under which the friction kernel ensures thermodynamic consistency, notably requiring the addition of a Dirac delta. Within linear response theory, we compute the relaxation function and relaxation time for two classes of protocols: moving and stiffening harmonic traps. Surprisingly, we find that viscoelastic memory does not always hinder relaxation; in certain cases, it accelerates it by reducing the effective relaxation time, leading to lower dissipation. We also derive optimal protocols that minimize the irreversible work and show how they are modified by the presence of the persistence time of the viscoelastic heat bath. Our results reveal that memory effects in the overdamped regime leave measurable thermodynamic signatures, depending on the protocol, with direct implications for controlling complex systems.

Title: Fluctuation Relations associated to an arbitrary bijection in path space
Authors: Raphael Chetrite, Stefano Marcantoni
Abstract: We introduce a framework to identify Fluctuation Relations for vector-valued observables in physical systems evolving through a stochastic dynamics. These relations arise from the particular structure of a suitable entropic functional and are induced by transformations in trajectory space that are invertible but are not involutions, typical examples being spatial rotations and translations. In doing so, we recover as particular cases results known in the literature as isometric fluctuation relations or spatial fluctuation relations and moreover we provide a recipe to find new ones. We mainly discuss two case studies, namely stochastic processes described by a canonical path probability and non degenerate diffusion processes. In both cases we provide sufficient conditions for the fluctuation relation to hold, considering either finite time or asymptotically large times.

Title: Spatially Mapping Phonon Drag in Ultrascaled 5-nm Silicon Nanowire Field-Effect Transistor Based on a Quantum Hydrodynamic Formalism
Authors: Houssem Rezgui, Giovanni Nastasi, Manuel Marcoux, Vittorio Romano
Abstract: The growing demand for better performance and lower thermal energy dissipation in nanoelectronic devices is the major driving force of the semiconductor industry's quest for future generations of nanotransistors. Over the past 15 years, the miniaturization of silicon-based nanoelectronics predicted by Moore's law has driven an aggressive scaling down of transistor structures, including materials, design, and geometries. In this regard, the electronic device community has expanded its focus to ultrascaled transistors targeting the 7 nm technology node and beyond. However, these emerging nanodevices also present thermal challenges that can limit carrier transport as a result of strong electron-phonon coupling. In this work, we investigate the physical origin of self-heating effects in an ultrascaled 5 nm silicon nanowire field-effect transistor. Based on a quantum hydrodynamic approach, we also provide an explanation of the phonon drag contribution to thermal conductivity. We report the impact of the phonon drag effect on the electrical and thermal performance of 5 nm gate-all-around silicon nanowire field-effect transistors. Our findings provide new insight into the origin of self-heating as a result of mutual electron-phonon coupling. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the phonon drag effect significantly reduces thermal conductivity by nearly 50% under high-bias conditions.

Title: Hamiltonian replica exchange augmented with diffusion-based generative models and importance sampling to assess biomolecular conformational basins and barriers
Authors: Zakarya Benayad, Guillaume Stirnemann
Abstract: Enhanced sampling techniques are essential for exploring biomolecular conformational dynamics that occur on timescales inaccessible to conventional molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. This study introduces a framework that combines Hamiltonian replica exchange with solute tempering (REST2) with denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) and importance sampling to enhance the mapping of conformational free-energy landscapes. Building on previous applications of DDPMs to temperature replica exchange (TREM), we propose two key improvements. First, we adapt the method to REST2 by treating potential energy as a fluctuating variable. This adaptation allows for more efficient sampling in large biomolecular systems. Second, to further improve resolution in high-barrier regions, we develop an iterative scheme combining replica exchange, DDPM, and importance sampling along known collective variables. Benchmarking on the mini-protein CLN025 demonstrates that DDPM-refined REST2 achieves comparable accuracy to TREM while requiring fewer replicas. Application to the enzyme PTP1B reveals a loop transition pathway consistent with prior complex biased simulations, showcasing the approach's ability to uncover high-barrier transitions with minimal computational overhead with respect to conventional replica exchange approaches. Overall, this hybrid strategy enables more efficient exploration of free-energy landscapes, expanding the utility of generative models in enhanced sampling simulations.

Title: Quantum Kinetic Uncertainty Relations in Mesoscopic Conductors at Strong Coupling
Authors: Gianmichele Blasi, Ricard Ravell Rodríguez, Mykhailo Moskalets, Rosa López, Géraldine Haack
Abstract: Kinetic Uncertainty Relations (KURs) establish quantum transport precision limits by linking signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to the system's dynamical activity, valid in the weak-coupling regime where particle-like transport dominates. At strong coupling, quantum coherence challenges the validity of KURs and questions the concept of activity itself. In this Letter, we achieve two distinct, yet complementary main results. First, we introduce a general definition of dynamical activity valid at arbitrary coupling, which reveals the breakdown of standard KURs at strong coupling. Second, we prove a novel uncertainty relation valid at arbitrary coupling strength, which we denote Quantum KUR (QKUR). This QKUR corresponds to a nontrivial quantum extension of KUR, involving fundamental contributions of the generalized dynamical activity. These two achievements provide a general framework for out-of-equilibrium quantum transport precision analysis, in close analogy with the transition from TURs to QTURs [Phys. Rev. Lett. 135, 046302]. Explicit steady-state expressions are obtained within Green's-function and Landauer-Büttiker formalisms. We illustrate these concepts for paradigmatic quantum-coherent mesoscopic devices: a single quantum channel pinched by a quantum point contact and open single- and double-quantum dot systems.

Title: Confinement-induced resonances for the creation of quasi-one-dimensional ultra cold gases of alkali--alkaline-earth dimers
Authors: Lorenzo Oghittu, Premjith Thekkeppatt, Nirav P. Mehta, Seth T. Rittenhouse, Klaasjan van Druten, Florian Schreck, Arghavan Safavi-Naini
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the role of confinement-induced resonances (CIRs) in low-dimensional ultracold atomic mixtures for the formation of weakly bound dimers. To this end, we examine the scattering properties of a binary atomic mixture confined by a quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) potential. In this regime, the interspecies two-body interaction is modeled as an effective 1D zero-range pseudopotential, with a coupling strength $g_\mathrm{1D}$ derived as a function of the three-dimensional scattering length $a$. This framework enables the study of CIRs in harmonically confined systems, with particular attention to the case of mismatched transverse trapping frequencies for the two atomic species. Finally, we consider the Bose-Fermi mixture of $^{87}$Rb and $^{87}$Sr, and identify values of the experimentally accessible parameters for which CIRs can be exploited to create weakly bound molecules.

Title: Geometric and Nonequilibrium Criticality in Run-and-Tumble Particles with Competing Motility and Attraction
Authors: Abir Bhowmick, Sayantan Mitra, P. K. Mohanty
Abstract: Self-propulsion in run-and-tumble particles (RTPs) generates effective attractive interactions that can drive motility-induced phase separation (MIPS), a phenomenon absent in passive systems. Here, we investigate RTPs in the presence of explicit attractive interactions and show that, at high motility, such interactions can suppress MIPS, yielding a homogeneous phase. Upon further increasing the attraction strength, phase separation reappears, giving rise to a re-entrant transition. We characterize this transition by analyzing the percolation properties of dense clusters, which provide geometric signatures of phase separation. Along the resulting critical line, we find continuously varying critical exponents, while certain scaling functions remain unchanged and coincide with those of equilibrium lattice gas models undergoing interacting percolation, which is in the Ising-percolation universality class. These results reveal that the MIPS transition in interacting RTP systems exhibit Ising superuniversality, thereby establishing a connection between nonequilibrium active matter and classical critical behavior.

Title: Mean first passage time of active Brownian particles in two dimensions
Authors: Sarafa A. Iyaniwura, Zhiwei Peng
Abstract: The mean first passage time (MFPT) is a key metric for understanding transport, search, and escape processes in stochastic systems. While well characterized for passive Brownian particles, its behavior in active systems-such as active Brownian particles (ABPs)-remains less understood due to their self-propelled, nonequilibrium dynamics. In this paper, we formulate and analyze an elliptic partial differential equation (PDE) to characterize the MFPT of ABPs in two-dimensional domains, including circular, annular, and elliptical regions. For annular regions, we analyze the MFPT of ABPs under various boundary conditions. Our results reveal rich behaviors in the MFPT of ABPs that differ fundamentally from those of passive particles. Notably, the MFPT exhibits non-monotonic dependence on the initial position and orientation of the particle, with maxima often occurring away from the domain center. We also find that increasing swimming speed can either increase or decrease the MFPT depending on the geometry and initial orientation. Asymptotic analysis of the PDE in the weak-activity regime provides insight into how activity modifies escape statistics of the particles in different geometries. Finally, our numerical solutions of the PDE are validated against Monte Carlo simulations.

Title: Charge pumps, pivot Hamiltonians and symmetry-protected topological phases
Authors: Nick. G. Jones, Ryan Thorngren, Ruben Verresen, Abhishodh Prakash
Abstract: Generalised charge pumps are topological obstructions to trivialising loops in the space of symmetric gapped Hamiltonians. We show that given mild conditions on such pumps, the associated loop has high-symmetry points which must be in distinct symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. To further elucidate the connection between pumps and SPTs, we focus on closed paths, `pivot loops', defined by two Hamiltonians, where the first is unitarily evolved by the second `pivot' Hamiltonian. While such pivot loops have been studied as entanglers for SPTs, here we explore their connection to pumps. We construct families of pivot loops which pump charge for various symmetry groups, often leading to SPT phases -- including dipole SPTs. Intriguingly, we find examples where non-trivial pumps do not lead to genuine SPTs but still entangle representation-SPTs (RSPTs). We use the anomaly associated to the non-trivial pump to explain the a priori `unnecessary' criticality between these RSPTs. We also find that particularly nice pivot families form circles in Hamiltonian space, which we show is equivalent to the Hamiltonians satisfying the Dolan-Grady relation -- known from the study of integrable models. This additional structure allows us to derive more powerful constraints on the phase diagram. Natural examples of such circular loops arise from pivoting with the Onsager-integrable chiral clock models, containing the aforementioned RSPT example. In fact, we show that these Onsager pivots underlie general group cohomology-based pumps in one spatial dimension. Finally, we recast the above in the language of equivariant families of Hamiltonians and relate the invariants of the pump to the candidate SPTs. We also highlight how certain SPTs arise in cases where the equivariant family is labelled by spaces that are not manifolds.

Title: Design and optimization of in situ self-functionalizing stress sensors
Authors: Olga Vasiljevic, Nicolas Harmand, Antoine Hubert, Lydia Kebbal, Volker Bormuth, Clara Hayn, Jonathan Fouchard, Elie Wandersman, Marie Anne Breau, Lea-Laetitia Pontani
Abstract: Mechanical contributions are crucial regulators of diverse biological processes, yet their \textit{in vivo} measurement remains challenging due to limitations of current techniques, that can be destructive or require complex dedicated setups. This study introduces a novel method to synthesize biocompatible, self-functionalizing stress sensors based on inverted emulsions, that can be used to probe stresses inside tissues but can also locally perturb the biological environment through specific binder presentation or drug delivery. We engineered an optimal design for these inverted emulsions, focusing on finding the balance between the two contradictory constraints: achieving low surface tension for deformability while maintaining emulsion instability for efficient self-functionalization and drug release. Proof-of-concept experiments in both agarose gels and complex biological systems, including brain organoids and zebrafish embryos, confirm the droplets ability to deform in response to mechanical stress applied within the tissue, to self-functionalize and to release encapsulated molecules locally. These versatile sensors offer a method for non-invasive stress measurements and targeted chemical delivery within living biological tissues, giving the potential to overcome current technical barriers in biophysical studies.

Title: Dimensional crossover of superfluid $^{3}$He in a magnetic field
Authors: Leyla Saraj, Daksh Malhotra, Aymar Muhikira, Alexander J. Shook, John P. Davis, Igor Boettcher
Abstract: Motivated by recent experiments on superfluid $^3$He in nanoscale-confined geometries, we theoretically investigate the associated phase diagram in a slab geometry and perpendicular magnetic field as the size of confinement is varied. Our analysis is based on minimizing the Ginzburg--Landau free energy for the $3\times 3$ matrix superfluid order parameter for three different boundary conditions. We observe a smooth crossover from the phase diagram of the 3D system to the quasi-2D limit for slab heights of several hundred nanometres and magnetic fields of several kilogauss. We illuminate that, despite the apparent complexity of the underlying equations, many precise numerical and even analytical statements can be made about the phase structure for general values of the coefficients of the free energy functional, which can in turn be used to constrain or measure these parameters. To guide future experimental studies, we compute the phase diagram in dependence of pressure, temperature, slab height, and magnetic field.

Title: A Proliferating Nematic That Collectively Senses an Anisotropic Substrate
Authors: Toshi Parmar, Fridtjof Brauns, Yimin Luo, M. Cristina Marchetti
Abstract: Motivated by recent experiments on growing fibroblasts, we examine the development of nematic order in a colony of elongated cells proliferating on a nematic elastomer substrate. After sparse seeding, the cells divide and grow into locally ordered, but randomly oriented, domains that then interact with each other and the substrate. Global alignment with the substrate is only achieved above a critical density, suggesting a collective mechanism for the sensing of substrate anisotropy. The system jams at high density, where both reorientation and proliferation stop. Using a continuum model of a proliferating nematic liquid crystal, we examine the competition between growth-driven alignment and substrate-driven alignment in controlling the density and structure of the final jammed state. We propose that anisotropic traction forces and the tendency of cells to align perpendicular to the direction of density gradients act in concert to provide a mechanism for collective cell alignment.

Title: Hamiltonian parameter inference from resonant inelastic x-ray scattering with active learning
Authors: Marton K. Lajer, Xin Dai, Kipton Barros, Matthew R. Carbone, S. Johnston, M. P. M. Dean
Abstract: Identifying model Hamiltonians is a vital step toward creating predictive models of materials. Here, we combine Bayesian optimization with the EDRIXS numerical package to infer Hamiltonian parameters from resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) spectra within the single atom approximation. To evaluate the efficacy of our method, we test it on experimental RIXS spectra of NiPS3, NiCl2, Ca3LiOsO6, and Fe2O3, and demonstrate that it can reproduce results obtained from hand-fitted parameters to a precision similar to expert human analysis while providing a more systematic mapping of parameter space. Our work provides a key first step toward solving the inverse scattering problem to extract effective multi-orbital models from information-dense RIXS measurements, which can be applied to a host of quantum materials. We also propose atomic model parameter sets for two materials, Ca3LiOsO6 and Fe2O3, that were previously missing from the literature.

Title: Beyond fragmented dopant dynamics in quantum spin lattices: Robust localization and non-Gaussian diffusion
Authors: Mingru Yang, Sajant Anand, Kristian Knakkergaard Nielsen
Abstract: The motion of dopants in magnetic spin lattices has received tremendous attention for at least four decades due to its connection to high-temperature superconductivity. Despite these efforts, we lack a complete understanding of their behavior, especially out of the equilibrium and at nonzero temperatures. In this paper, we take a significant step towards a much deeper understanding based on state-of-the-art matrix-product-state calculations. In particular, we investigate the non-equilibrium dynamics of a dopant in two-leg $t$--$J$ ladders with antiferromagnetic XXZ spin interactions. In the Ising limit, we find that the dopant is localized for all investigated nonzero temperatures due to an emergent disordered potential, with a localization length controlled by the underlying correlation length of the spin lattice, which increases exponentially with decreasing temperature. The dopant, hereby, only delocalizes asymptotically in the zero temperature limit. This greatly generalizes the localization effect discovered recently in Hilbert space fragmented models. In the presence of spin-exchange processes at rate $\alpha$, the dopant diffuses with a diffusion coefficient, $D_h$, depending non-monotonically on $\alpha$. It initially increases linearly as $D_h \propto \alpha$ for $\alpha \ll 1$ before dropping off as $\alpha^{-1}$ for $\alpha > 1$. Moreover, we show that the underlying spin dynamics at infinite temperature behaves qualitatively the same, albeit with important quantitative differences. We substantiate these findings by showing that the dynamics features self-similar scaling behavior, which strongly deviates from the Gaussian behavior of regular diffusion, especially for weak spin exchange. Finally, we show that the diffusion coefficient $D_h$ follows an Arrhenius relation at high temperatures, whereby it is exponentially suppressed upon cooling.

Title: Spin-flop-like transition as quantum critical point in Cs$_2$RuO$_4$
Authors: S. D. Nabi, M. Zhu, K. Yu. Povarov, D. G. Mazzone, J. Lass, Y. Wu, Z. Yan, S. Gvasaliya, A. Zheludev
Abstract: We report thermodynamic, neutron diffraction, and inelastic neutron scattering measurements on Cs$_2$RuO$_4$, a member of the celebrated family of frustrated magnets Cs$_2$MX$_4$ (M = Cu, Co, X = Br, Cl). Unlike the previously studied members, it is based on $4d$ transition metal ions with $S=1$. Mapping out the $H-T$ magnetic phase diagram reveals an unusual continuous spin-flop-like phase transition associated with a quantum critical point within the antiferromagnetically ordered phase. A quantitative analysis of the complex magnetic excitation spectrum measured in zero field allows us to derive a model magnetic Hamiltonian for this compound. Its main feature is a frustration of magnetic anisotropy on a level that is much higher than in any of the previously studied species. This frustration naturally explains the peculiar phase transition observed.

Title: Exceptional Andreev spectrum and supercurrent in p-wave non-Hermitian Josephson junctions
Authors: Chang-An Li, Björn Trauzettel
Abstract: We investigate the spectrum of Andreev bound states and supercurrent in a $p$-wave non-Hermitian Josephson junction (NHJJ) in one dimension. The studied NHJJ is composed of two topological $p$-wave superconductors connected by a non-Hermitian dissipative junction. Starting from the effective non-Hermitian Bogoliubov-de Gennes bulk Hamiltonian, we find that a pair of exceptional points emerge in the complex spectrum of Andreev quasi-bound states. The two exceptional points with zero energy locate symmetrically with respect to Josephson phase difference $\phi=\pi$, at which a Majorana zero mode persists. Notably, the exceptional points descend from a pair of Majorana zero modes after turning on the non-Hermiticity and are topologically protected. By analyzing the non-Hermitian scattering process at the junction, we explicitly demonstrate the loss of quasiparticles through the decay of scattering amplitude probabilities. Furthermore, we obtain the supercurrent directly by the inelastic Andreev reflection amplitudes, which provides a more intuitive interpretation of transport properties in NHJJs. The supercurrent varies continuously as a function of $\phi$ across the exceptional points. No enhancement of critical current is observed. We also generalize our analysis to a mixed $s$-$p$ wave NHJJ. Our results provide new insights on transport properties of Josephson junctions in presence of Majorana zero modes, exceptional points, and non-Hermiticity.

Title: Floquet-engineered moire quasicrystal patterns of ultracold Bose gases in twisted bilayer optical lattices
Authors: Zhenze Fan, Juan Wang, Yan Li
Abstract: We investigate the formation of moiré quasicrystal patterns in Bose gases confined in twisted bilayer optical lattices via Floquet-engineered intralayer atomic interactions. Dynamical evolutions of the inverse participation ratio and the density wave amplitude reveal the stage for the emergence of moiré quasicrystal patterns, whose symmetry can be easily manipulated by the modulation frequencies and amplitudes. Reducing the frequencies and increasing the amplitudes can both facilitate lattice symmetry breaking and the subsequent emergence of rotational symmetry. Notably, a twelve-fold quasicrystal pattern emerges under specific parameters, closely resembling the moiré quasicrystal in twisted bilayer graphene. The momentum-space distributions also exhibit high rotational symmetry, which is consistent with the real-space patterns at specific evolution times. Our findings establish a new quantum platform for exploring quasicrystals and their symmetry properties in ultracold bosonic systems.

Title: Terahertz radiation induced attractive-repulsive Fermi polaron conversion in transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers
Authors: A.M. Shentsev, M.M. Glazov
Abstract: We present a theoretical study of terahertz radiation-induced transitions between attractive and repulsive Fermi polaron states in monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides. Going beyond the simple few-particle trion picture, we develop a many-body description that explicitly accounts for correlations with the Fermi sea of resident charge carriers. We calculate the rate of the direct optical conversion process which has a threshold where the terahertz photon energy equals to the Fermi polaron binding energy. This process features a characteristic frequency dependence near the threshold, due to final-state electron-exciton scattering related to the trion correlation with the Fermi sea hole. Furthermore, we demonstrate that intense terahertz pulses can significantly heat the electron gas via Drude absorption enabling an additional, indirect conversion mechanism through collisions between hot electrons and polarons, which exhibits a strong exponential dependence on the electron temperature. Our results reveal the important role of many-body correlations and thermal effects in the terahertz-driven dynamics of excitonic complexes in two-dimensional semiconductors.

Title: Ubiquitous Antiparallel Domains in 2D Hexagonal Boron Nitride Uncovered by Interferometric Nonlinear Optical Imaging
Authors: Yeri Lee, Juseung Oh, Kyung Yeol Ma, Seung Jin Lee, Eui Young Jung, Yani Wang, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Hailin Peng, Hiroki Ago, Ki Kang Kim, Hyeon Suk Shin, Sunmin Ryu
Abstract: Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) supports a wide range of two-dimensional (2D) technologies, yet assessing its crystalline quality over large areas remains a fundamental challenge. Both antiparallel domains, an intrinsic outcome of epitaxy on high-symmetry substrates, and associated structural defects have long evaded optical detection. Here, we show that interferometric second-harmonic generation (SHG) imaging provides a powerful, nondestructive probe of lattice orientation and structural integrity in chemical vapor deposition-grown hBN. This approach reveals the ubiquitous formation of antiparallel domains and quantifies their impact on crystalline order. SHG intensity also emerges as a direct optical metric of domain disorder, spanning three orders of magnitude across films produced by ten different growth routes. Correlation with Raman spectroscopy establishes a unified framework for evaluating crystalline quality. Beyond hBN, this method offers a high-throughput route to wide-area structural imaging in various non-centrosymmetric materials, advancing their deployment in electronics, photonics, and quantum technologies.

Title: Geometric Mechanics of Thin Periodic Surfaces
Authors: Wenqian Sun, Yanxin Feng, Christian D. Santangelo, D. Zeb Rocklin
Abstract: Thin surfaces are ubiquitous in nature, from leaves to cell membranes, and in technology, from paper to corrugated containers. Structural thinness imbues them with flexibility, the ability to easily bend under light loads, even as their much higher stretching stiffness can bear substantial stresses. When surfaces have periodic patterns of either smooth hills and valleys or sharp origami-like creases this can substantially modify their mechanical response. We show that for any such surface, there is a duality between the surface rotations of an isometric deformation and the in-plane stresses of a force-balanced configuration. This duality means that of the six possible combinations of global in-plane strain and out-of-plane bending, exactly three must be isometries. We show further that stressed configurations can be expressed in terms of both the applied deformation and the isometric deformation that is dual to the pattern of stress that arises. We identify constraints rooted in symplectic geometry on the three isometries that a single surface can generate. This framework sheds new light on the fundamental limits of the mechanical response of thin periodic surfaces, while also highlighting the role that continuum differential geometry plays in even sharply creased origami surfaces.

Title: Superconducting spin valve effect in Fe/Si$_3$N$_4$/Pb/Si$_3$N$_4$/Fe heterostructures
Authors: A. A. Kamashev, N. N. Garif'yanov, A. A. Validov, A. S. Osin, Ya. V. Fominov, I. A. Garifullin
Abstract: The structures of the superconducting spin valve (SSV) Fe/Si$_3$N$_4$/Pb/Si$_3$N$_4$/Fe (where Si$_3$N$_4$ is a dielectric insulating layer of controlled thickness) were investigated. The dependence of the magnitude of the SSV effect on the thicknesses of the superconducting (S) and insulating (I) layers was studied. Optimization of the S and I layer thicknesses enabled a complete switching between the normal and superconducting states when the mutual orientation of the magnetizations of the ferromagnetic (F) layers changed from antiparallel to parallel. A maximal SSV effect value of 0.36\,K was achieved in an external magnetic field of 1\,kOe. These results demonstrate that SSV structures with tunable S/F interface transparency controlled by insulating interlayers are promising for achieving a significant magnitude of the effect. This opens new avenues for the development of such systems and their potential applications in spintronic devices.

Title: Orbital magnetization in Sierpinski fractals
Authors: L. L. Lage, Tarik. P. Cysne, A. Latgé
Abstract: Orbital magnetization (OM) in Sierpinski carpet (SC) and triangle (ST) fractal is theoretically investigated by using Haldane model as a prototypical example. The OM calculation is performed following two distinct approaches; employing the definition and local markers formalism. Both methods coincides for all systems analyzed. For the SC, higher fractal generations create a dense set of edge states, resulting in a staircase profile, leading to oscillations in the magnetization as a function of the chemical potential. In contrast, the ST self-similarity produces distinct fractal-induced spectral gaps, which manifest as constant plateaus in the magnetization. The STs exhibit a pronounced sensitivity to edge terminations. Our results reveal how quantum confinement in fractal structures affects the electronic orbital angular momentum, pointing to possible pathways for exploring novel orbitronics in systems with complex geometries.

Title: Coherent and Dynamic Small Polaron Delocalization in CuFeO$_{2}$
Authors: Jocelyn L. Mendes, Srijan Bhattacharyya, Chengye Huang, Jonathan M. Michelsen, Isabel M. Klein, Finn Babbe, Thomas Sayer, Tianchu Li, Jason K. Cooper, Hanzhe Liu, Naomi S. Ginsberg, Andrés Montoya-Castillo, Scott K. Cushing
Abstract: Small polarons remain a significant bottleneck in the realization of efficient devices using transition metal oxides. Routes to engineer small polaron coupling to electronic states and lattice modes to control carrier localization remain unclear. Here, we measure the formation of small polarons in CuFeO$_{2}$ using transient extreme ultraviolet reflection spectroscopy and compare it to theoretical predictions in realistically parameterized Holstein models, demonstrating that polaron localization depends on its coupling to the high-frequency versus low-frequency components of the phonon bath. We measure that small polaron formation occurs on a comparable ~100 fs timescale to other Fe(III) compounds. After formation, a dynamic delocalization of the small polaron occurs through a coherent lattice expansion between Fe-O layers and charge-sharing with surrounding Fe(IV) states. Our simulations of polaron formation dynamics reveal that two major factors dictate polaron formation timescales: phonon density and reorganization energy distributions between acoustic and optical modes, matching experimental findings. Our work provides a detailed, real-time observation of how electronic-structural coupling in a polaron-host material can be leveraged to suppress polaronic effects for various applications.

Title: Temperature Dependence of the Momentum-Resolved Static Spin Susceptibility in a Mott-Proximate Cuprate Model
Authors: Keishichiro Tanaka
Abstract: This paper presents the temperature dependence of the static spin susceptibility at $\mathbf{q} = (\pi, \pi)$ and $\mathbf{q} = (\pi, 0)$ in a Mott-proximate cuprate model with an antinodal pseudogap -- a model system for high-temperature superconducting (HTSC) cuprates. The results show the susceptibility onset temperature tracks the critical temperature ($T_c$) of HTSCs with a comparable scale across the electron filling factor. Also, as the electron filling decreases and the chemical potential approaches the antinodal van Hove region, the susceptibility at $\mathbf{q}=(\pi,0)$ -- the axial particle-hole response -- grows markedly. The emergence of cuprate superconductivity correlates with a suppression of low-energy antinodal spin response and associated particle-hole excitations, which would otherwise dephase $d$-wave pairing, commonly attributed to spin fluctuations. In this context, the pseudogap partially suppresses antinodal spectral weight near $\omega = 0$, thereby reducing the low-$\omega$ particle-hole phase space.

Title: Achieving Empirical Potential Efficiency with DFT Accuracy: A Neuroevolution Potential for the $α$-Fe--C--H System
Authors: Fan-Shun Meng, Shuhei Shinzato, Zhiqiang Zhao, Jun-Ping Du, Lei Gao, Zheyong Fan, Shigenobu Ogata
Abstract: A neuroevolution potential (NEP) for the ternary $\alpha$-Fe--C--H system was developed based on a database generated from spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) calculations, achieving empirical potential efficiency with DFT accuracy. At the same power consumption, simulation speeds using NEP are comparable to, or even faster than, those with bond order potentials. The NEP achieves DFT-level accuracy across a wide range of scenarios commonly encountered in studies of $\alpha$-Fe- and $\alpha$-Fe--C under hydrogen environments. The NEP enables large-scale atomistic simulations with DFT-level accuracy at the cost of empirical potentials, offering a practical tool to study hydrogen embrittlement in steel.

Title: On chaotic regimes of conductivity behavior in the tight-binding approximation
Authors: A.Ya. Maltsev
Abstract: We investigate the probability of detecting the most nontrivial conductivity behavior regimes in metals whose electron spectrum is described by the tight-binding approximation. These regimes are associated with the emergence of highly complex electron trajectories on the Fermi surface and correspond to a nontrivial (scaling) behavior of the conductivity tensor in strong magnetic fields. The geometry of such trajectories, as well as the corresponding conductivity regimes, have been well studied theoretically; however, they have not yet been observed experimentally. The results of our study allow us, in particular, to estimate the probability of their occurrence and to indicate the conditions for their possible detection for a wide class of conductors.

Title: Giant thermal modulation via a semiconductor-superconductor photonic field-effect heat transistor
Authors: Sebastiano Battisti, Matteo Pioldi, Alessandro Paghi, Giorgio De Simoni, Alessandro Braggio, Giulio Senesi, Lucia Sorba, Francesco Giazotto
Abstract: We present a groundbreaking demonstration of thermal modulation in a field-effect-controllable semiconductor-superconductor hybrid structure, wherein the heating mechanism is exclusively radiative. The architecture comprises two reservoirs separated by $\sim 1$ mm and interconnected via a completely non-galvanic electrical circuit, enabling the transfer of black-body radiation from the hot to the cold reservoir. Our device utilizes a superconducting Josephson field-effect transistor to achieve magnetic-field-free gate-tunable regulation of heat currents within the circuit. While prior studies have indicated the potential for electrostatic modulation of thermal transport properties, our framework demonstrates a temperature modulation of up to $\sim 45$ mK, exceeding prior findings by more than an order of magnitude. Furthermore, it proves a thermal transimpedance of $\sim 20$ mK/V at a bath temperature of $30$ mK. The development of such systems holds substantial promise for advancing heat management and routing in quantum chips and radiation sensors, as it enables precise nonlocal control of heat flow towards a designated structure, even when the heat source is distant and non-galvanically coupled.

Title: Coherent Information Phase Transition in a Noisy Quantum Circuit
Authors: Dongheng Qian, Jing Wang
Abstract: Coherent information quantifies the transmittable quantum information through a channel and is directly linked to the channel's quantum capacity. In a monitored quantum circuit, regarded as a quantum channel, extensive and positive coherent information is sustained at low measurement rates, protected by the scrambling dynamics. However, noise suppresses coherent information, driving it to zero or negative values. Here, we show that incorporating quantum-enhanced operations facilitates reliable quantum information transmission even in the presence of noise, as evidenced by a phase transition in coherent information from a recoverable phase with positive values to an irrecoverable phase with negative values. We provide both analytical understanding and numerical evidence demonstrating this transition, which is modulated by the relative frequencies of noise and quantum-enhanced operations. Additionally, we propose a resource-efficient protocol to characterize this phase transition in experiments, effectively avoiding post-selection by utilizing every run of the quantum circuit. This approach bridges the gap between theoretical insights and practical implementation, making the phase transition feasible to demonstrate on realistic noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices.

Title: Measuring vacancy-type defect density in monolayer semiconductors
Authors: Aleksandar Radic, Nick von Jeinsen, Vivian Perez, Ke Wang, Min Lin, Boyao Liu, Yiru Zhu, Ismail Sami, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, David Ward, Andrew Jardine, Akshay Rao, Manish Chhowalla, Sam Lambrick
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials have attracted wide-spread interest due to their unique and tunable properties. Their optoelectronic, mechanical, and thermal properties are greatly influenced by crystal defects, which are, in turn, used to control these properties. However, experimental quantification of the density of defects, whether deliberately introduced or inherent, is very difficult in these atomically thin materials. Here we show that helium atom micro-diffraction can be used to measure the defect density in 15x20um monolayer MoS2, a prototypical 2D semiconductor, quickly and easily compared to standard methods. We present a simple analytic model, the lattice gas equation, that fully captures the relationship between atomic Bragg diffraction intensity and defect density. The model, combined with ab initio scattering calculations, shows that our technique can immediately be applied to a wide range of 2D materials, independent of sample chemistry or structure. Additionally, wafer-scale characterization is immediately possible.

Title: Protocols for Creating Anyons and Defects via Gauging
Authors: Anasuya Lyons, Chiu Fan Bowen Lo, Nathanan Tantivasadakarn, Ashvin Vishwanath, Ruben Verresen
Abstract: Creating and manipulating anyons and symmetry defects in topological phases, especially those with a non-Abelian character, constitutes a primitive for topological quantum computation. We provide a physical protocol for implementing the ribbon operators of non-Abelian anyons and symmetry defects. We utilize dualities, in particular the Kramers-Wannier or gauging map, which have previously been used to construct topologically ordered ground states by relating them to simpler states. In this work, ribbon operators are implemented by applying a gauging procedure to a lower-dimensional region of such states. This protocol uses sequential unitary circuits or, in certain cases, constant-depth adaptive circuits. We showcase this for anyons and defects in the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ toric code and $S_3$ quantum double. The general applicability of our method is demonstrated by deriving unitary expressions for ribbon operators of various (twisted) quantum doubles.

Title: Trapped-ion quantum simulation of the Fermi-Hubbard model as a lattice gauge theory using hardware-aware native gates
Authors: Dhruv Srinivasan, Alex Beyer, Daiwei Zhu, Pranav Srikanth, Spencer Churchill, Kushagra Mehta, Sashank Kaushik Sridhar, Kushal Chakrabarti, David W. Steuerman, Nikhil Chopra, Avik Dutt
Abstract: The Fermi-Hubbard model (FHM) is a simple yet rich model of strongly interacting electrons with complex dynamics and a variety of emerging quantum phases. These properties make it a compelling target for digital quantum simulation. Trotterization-based quantum simulations have shown promise, but implementations on current hardware are limited by noise, necessitating error mitigation techniques like circuit optimization and post-selection. A mapping of the FHM to a Z2 LGT was recently proposed that restricts the dynamics to a subspace protected by additional symmetries, and its ability for post-selection error mitigation was verified through noisy classical simulations. In this work, we propose and demonstrate a suite of algorithm-hardware co-design strategies on a trapped-ion quantum computer, targeting two key aspects of NISQ-era quantum simulation: circuit compilation and error mitigation. In particular, a novel combination of iteratively preconditioned gradient descent (IPG) and subsystem von Neumann Entropy compression reduces the 2-qubit gate count of FHM quantum simulation by 35%, consequently doubling the number of simulatable Trotter steps when used in tandem with error mitigation based on conserved symmetries, debiasing and sharpening techniques. Our work demonstrates the value of algorithm-hardware co-design to operate digital quantum simulators at the threshold of maximum circuit depths allowed by current hardware, and is broadly generalizable to strongly correlated systems in quantum chemistry and materials science.

Title: Parent Lindbladians for Matrix Product Density Operators
Authors: Yuhan Liu, Alberto Ruiz-de-Alarcón, Georgios Styliaris, Xiao-Qi Sun, David Pérez-García, J. Ignacio Cirac
Abstract: Understanding quantum phases of matter is a fundamental goal in physics. For pure states, the representatives of phases are the ground states of locally interacting Hamiltonians, which are also renormalization fixed points (RFPs). These RFP states are exactly described by tensor networks. Extending this framework to mixed states, matrix product density operators (MPDOs) which are RFPs are believed to encapsulate mixed-state phases of matter in one dimension, where non-trivial topological phases have already been shown to exist. However, to better motivate the physical relevance of those states, and in particular the physical relevance of the recently found non-trivial phases, it remains an open question whether such MPDO RFPs can be realized as steady states of local Lindbladians. In this work, we resolve this question by analytically constructing parent Lindbladians for MPDO RFPs. These Lindbladians are local, frustration-free, and exhibit minimal steady-state degeneracy. Interestingly, we find that parent Lindbladians possess a rich structure that distinguishes them from their Hamiltonian counterparts. In particular, we uncover an intriguing connection between the non-commutativity of the Lindbladian terms and the fact that the corresponding MPDO RFP belongs to a non-trivial phase.

Title: Antiscarring from eigenstate stacking in a chaotic spinor condensate
Authors: Zhongling Lu, Anton M. Graf, Eric J. Heller, Joonas Keski-Rahkonen, Ceren B. Dag
Abstract: We reveal a feature of quantum scarring in systems with many particles: Quantum scars, living densely near an unstable periodic orbit, must be compensated by corresponding antiscarred states suppressed there to establish the uniformity of the whole. The uniformity of the underlying phase space is linked to early-time dynamics -- a regime beyond the predictions of random matrix theory and encapsulated in the eigenstate stacking theorem. By extending the domain of the stacking theorem, we apply our theory to a chaotic spinor Bose-Einstein condensate, whose quantum scar dynamics have recently been observed in the laboratory. Our work uncovers how scarring of some eigenstates affects the rest of the chaotic and thermal spectrum in quantum systems with many particles.

Title: Generic Hilbert Space Fragmentation in Kogut--Susskind Lattice Gauge Theories
Authors: Anthony N. Ciavarella, Christian W. Bauer, Jad C. Halimeh
Abstract: At the heart of quantum many-body physics lies the understanding of mechanisms that avoid quantum thermalization in an isolated system quenched far from equilibrium. A prominent example is Hilbert space fragmentation, which has recently emerged as an ergodicity-breaking mechanism in constrained spin models. Here, we show that Kogut--Susskind formulations of lattice gauge theories in $d+1$D ($d$ spatial and one temporal dimensions) give rise to Hilbert space fragmentation, and discuss possible implications for understanding continuum physics. Our findings not only prove that lattice gauge theories are a natural platform for Hilbert space fragmentation, they also serve as a guide to the conditions under which these models can be faithfully used to infer the thermalization properties of quantum chromodynamics.

Title: Symmetry Properties of Quantum Dynamical Entropy
Authors: Eric D. Schultz, Keiichiro Furuya, Laimei Nie
Abstract: As quantum analogs of the classical Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy, quantum dynamical entropies have emerged as important tools to characterize complex quantum dynamics. In particular, Alicki-Fannes-Lindblad (AFL) entropy, which quantifies the information production rate of a coherent quantum system subjected to repeated measurement, has received considerable attention as a potential diagnostic for quantum chaos. Despite this interest, the precise behavior of quantum dynamical entropy in the presence of symmetry remains largely unexplored. In this work, we establish rigorous inequalities of the AFL entropy for arbitrary unitary dynamics (single-particle and many-body) in the presence of various types of symmetry. Our theorems encompass three cases: Abelian symmetry, an anticommuting unitary, and non-Abelian symmetries. In particular, we show that, while the cumulative AFL entropy generally saturates to the dimensional bound at late times for chaotic dynamics, this saturation value is distinctively lower when the measurements respect the symmetries. We motivate our main results with numerical simulations of the perturbed quantum cat maps. Our findings highlight the crucial role of symmetry in quantum dynamics under measurements, and our framework is readily adaptable for investigating symmetry's influence across diverse probes of quantum chaos.

Title: Electric-field Quantum Sensing Exploiting a Photogenerated Charge-transfer Triplet State in a Molecular Semiconductor
Authors: Niccolò Fontana, Mikhail V. Vaganov, Gabriel Moise, William K. Myers, Kun Peng, Arzhang Ardavan, Junjie Liu
Abstract: Molecular spin systems are promising platforms for quantum sensing due to their chemically tunable Hamiltonians, enabling tailored coherence properties and interactions with external fields. However, electric field sensing remains challenging owing to typically weak spin-electric coupling (SEC) and limited directional sensitivity. Addressing these issues using heavy atoms exhibiting strong atomic spin-orbit couplings (SOC) often compromises spin coherence times. Here, we demonstrate coherent electric field sensing using a photogenerated charge-transfer (CT) spin triplet state in the organic molecule ACRSA (10-phenyl-10H,10' H-spiro\[acridine-9,9'-anthracen]-10'-one). By embedding electric field pulses within a Hahn echo sequence, we coherently manipulate the spin triplet and extract both the magnitude and directional dependence of its SEC. The measured SEC strength is approximately 0.51 Hz/(V/m), comparable to values reported in systems with strong atomic SOC, illustrating that heavy atoms are not a prerequisite for electric-field sensitivity of spin states. Our findings position organic CT triplets as chemically versatile and directionally sensitive quantum sensors of E-fields that function without atomic-SOC-mediated mechanisms.

Title: Synthetic Turbulence via an Instanton Gas Approximation
Authors: Timo Schorlepp, Katharina Kormann, Jeremiah Lübke, Tobias Schäfer, Rainer Grauer
Abstract: Sampling synthetic turbulent fields as a computationally tractable surrogate for direct numerical simulations (DNS) is an important practical problem in various applications, and allows to test our physical understanding of the main features of real turbulent flows. Reproducing higher-order Eulerian correlation functions, as well as Lagrangian particle statistics, requires an accurate representation of coherent structures of the flow in the synthetic turbulent fields. To this end, we propose in this paper a systematic coherent-structure based method for sampling synthetic random fields, based on a superposition of instanton configurations - an instanton gas - from the field-theoretic formulation of turbulence. We discuss sampling strategies for ensembles of instantons, both with and without interactions and including Gaussian fluctuations around them. The resulting Eulerian and Lagrangian statistics are evaluated numerically and compared against DNS results, as well as Gaussian and log-normal cascade models that lack coherent structures. The instanton gas approach is illustrated via the example of one-dimensional Burgers turbulence throughout this paper, and we show that already a canonical ensemble of non-interacting instantons without fluctuations reproduces DNS statistics very well. Finally, we outline extensions of the method to higher dimensions, in particular to magnetohydrodynamic turbulence for future applications to cosmic ray propagation.

Title: Competing color superconductivity and color Kondo effect in quark matter
Authors: Pradip Kattel, Abay Zhakenov, Natan Andrei
Abstract: The competition between bulk color superconductivity and the localized screening of a heavy quark impurity, analogous to the Kondo effect, leads to a rich spectrum of phenomena in dense quark matter. We investigate this competition at the edge of a superconducting quark bulk, where both the superconducting gap and the Kondo scale are dynamically generated in a tractable toy model. Utilizing the exact Bethe Ansatz method, we elucidate the resulting boundary physics. We identify distinct regimes characterized by either multi-particle Kondo screening or an unscreened local moment. Crucially, we also uncover a novel intermediate phase featuring impurity screening through a single-particle bound state formed within the superconducting gap. The toy model presented in this work highlights the complex interplay between dynamically generated bulk properties and boundary impurities in extreme QCD environments, offering potential insights into phenomena occurring in heavy-ion collisions and compact stars.

Title: Decoding the string in terms of holographic quantum maps
Authors: Avik Chakraborty, Tanay Kibe, Martín Molina, Ayan Mukhopadhyay, Hardik Vamshi
Abstract: It has recently been shown that the Nambu-Goto equation for a string emerges from the junction conditions in three-dimensional gravity. Holographically, gravitational junctions are dual to interfaces in conformal field theory. We demonstrate that each stringy mode of the junction corresponds to a universal $\mathcal{H}_{in}\rightarrow \mathcal{H}_{out}$ quantum map between in and out Hilbert spaces of excitations scattered at the interface, and also a universal $\mathcal{H}_{L}\rightarrow \mathcal{H}_{R}$ quantum map relating the excitations on both sides. These quantum maps generalize those realized by defect operators, preserve the conformal boundary condition at the interface, and realize a tunable energy transmitter.

Title: The Many Faces of Non-invertible Symmetries
Authors: Shadi Ali Ahmad, Marc S. Klinger, Yifan Wang
Abstract: We investigate the interplay between algebraic and categorical notions of non-invertible symmetries. In particular, a fusion categorical symmetry $\mathcal{C}$ is shown to induce an algebraic symmetry encoded in a weak Hopf algebra $H$ which is Tannaka-Krein dual to $\mathcal{C}$ in the sense that $\mathcal{C} = \text{Rep}(H^*)$. The latter duality is not unique, and consequently the algebraic symmetry acts on an extended system relative to the categorical one. We present an approach to analyzing the symmetry breaking patterns of weak Hopf algebraic non-invertible symmetries. The central ingredient is a certain conditional expectation, which serves as the analog of a group averaging map for a non-invertible symmetry. The index of this conditional expectation emerges as a quantum information theoretic quantity that determines the extent to which the underlying symmetry can be broken. Ambiguities which ensue from the non-uniqueness of the categorical reconstruction lead to distinct properties of symmetry breaking compared to the invertible case. Finally, we exemplify our approach through topological and conformal quantum field theories in which non-invertible symmetries are naturally interpreted as defect operators and boundary conditions.

Title: Systematic Study of Amorphous ABC Heterostructures at the Atomic Scale as a Nonlinear Optical Metamaterial
Authors: Martin Mičulka, Jinsong Liu, Sebastian Beer, Raihan Rafi, Denys Sevriukov, Sergiy Yulin, Vladimir Roddatis, Stefan Nolte, Isabelle Staude, Andreas Tünnermann, Sven Schröder, Adriana Szeghalmi
Abstract: The systematic exploration of ABC type heterostructures reveals that nanoscale morphological modification markedly improves nonlinear optical properties to maximize the artificial bulk second-order susceptibility. These amorphous birefringent heterostructures are fabricated through cyclic plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition of three oxides, effectively breaking centrosymmetry. We observe a dependence of optical nonlinearity on the thickness variation of three constituent materials: SiO$_2$ (A), TiO$_2$ (B), and Al$_2$O$_3$ (C), ranging from tens of nanometers to the atomic scale, and these materials exhibit second-order susceptibility at their interfaces. Our findings reveal that the enhancement of nonlinear optical properties is strongly correlated with a high density of layers and superior interface quality, where the interface second-order nonlinearity transitions to bulk-like second-harmonic generation. An effective bulk second-order susceptibility of $\chi_{zzz}\nobreakspace{}=\nobreakspace{}2.0\nobreakspace{}\pm\nobreakspace{}0.2$ pm/V is achieved, comparable to typical values for conventional monocrystalline nonlinear materials.

Title: Zeta expansion for long-range interactions under periodic boundary conditions with applications to micromagnetics
Authors: Andreas A. Buchheit, Jonathan K. Busse, Torsten Keßler, Filipp N. Rybakov
Abstract: We address the efficient computation of power-law-based interaction potentials of homogeneous $d$-dimensional bodies with an infinite $n$-dimensional array of copies, including their higher-order derivatives. This problem forms a serious challenge in micromagnetics with periodic boundary conditions and related fields. Nowadays, it is common practice to truncate the associated infinite lattice sum to a finite number of images, introducing uncontrolled errors. We show that, for general interacting geometries, the exact infinite sum for both dipolar interactions and generalized Riesz power-law potentials can be obtained by complementing a small direct sum by a correction term that involves efficiently computable derivatives of generalized zeta functions. We show that the resulting representation converges exponentially in the derivative order, reaching machine precision at a computational cost no greater than that of truncated summation schemes. In order to compute the generalized zeta functions efficiently, we provide a superexponentially convergent algorithm for their evaluation, as well as for all required special functions, such as incomplete Bessel functions. Magnetic fields can thus be evaluated to machine precision in arbitrary cuboidal domains periodically extended along one or two dimensions. We benchmark our method against known formulas for magnetic interactions and against direct summation for Riesz potentials with large exponents, consistently achieving full precision. In addition, we identify new corrections to the asymptotic limit of the demagnetization field and tabulate high-precision benchmark values that can be used as a reliable reference for micromagnetic solvers. The techniques developed are broadly applicable, with direct impact in other areas such as molecular dynamics.

Title: Ruelle-Pollicott Decay of Out-of-Time-Order Correlators in Many-Body Systems
Authors: Jerónimo Duarte, Ignacio García-Mata, Diego A. Wisniacki
Abstract: The out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC) quantifies information scrambling in quantum systems and serves as a key diagnostic of quantum chaos. In one-body systems with a classical counterpart, the relaxation of the OTOC is governed by Ruelle-Pollicott resonances. For many-body systems lacking a semiclassical limit, recent studies have identified an analogous role played by the Liouvillian spectrum of weakly open extensions of the dynamics, where the slowest decay rate -- the Liouvillian gap -- encodes relaxation. Here we study the kicked Ising spin chain and show that the long-time exponential decay of the OTOC in the isolated system occurs at a rate equal to twice this intrinsic gap. This correspondence persists even in crossover regimes between integrability and chaos, demonstrating that the Liouvillian spectrum provides a unified framework for understanding relaxation and irreversibility in closed many-body quantum systems.

Title: Spectral statistics and energy-gap scaling in $k-$local spin Hamiltonians
Authors: Sasanka Dowarah
Abstract: We investigate the spectral properties of all-to-all interacting spin Hamiltonians acting on exactly $k$ spins, whose coupling coefficients are drawn from a normal distribution with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$. For $\mu = 0$, we demonstrate that the random matrix ensemble -- Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE), Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE), or Gaussian Symplectic Ensemble (GSE) -- is determined by the parity of system size $L$ and locality $k$, following standard time-reversal symmetry classification. For couplings with a nonzero mean, we map the Hamiltonians to deformed random matrix ensembles and analyze conditions for an energy gap between the ground state and the first excited state. For $\mu < 0$, we find two distinct regimes: for $k \gg \sqrt{L}$, the gap closes at critical disorder $\sigma_{c} \approx |\mu|$. Near this transition the energy gap $\Delta$ exhibits universal quadratic scaling $\Delta /L \sim (\sigma - \sigma_{c})^{2}$. When $k \ll \sqrt{L}$, $\sigma_{c}$ scales with $|\mu|$, but lacks a sharp transition. Our work introduces a semi-solvable model that captures universal features of random-matrix statistics, and spectral gap formation, providing a foundation for systematic extensions to more general many-body systems.

Title: Perturbation-assisted Observation of the Lowest Vibrational Level of the $\mathrm{b}^{3}Π_{0}$ State of Ultracold LiK Molecules
Authors: Anbang Yang, Xiaoyu Nie, Hao Lin Yu, Yiming Liu, Victor Avalos, Canming He, Jacek Klos, Svetlana Kotochigova, Kai Dieckmann
Abstract: The narrow transition from the lowest rovibrational level of the $\mathrm{X}^{1}\Sigma^{+}$ electronic ground state to the lowest vibrational level of the $\mathrm{b}^{3}\Pi_{0}$ potential provides opportunities for achieving magic-wavelength trapping of ultracold bialkali molecules for enhancing their rotational coherence times. Guided by existing spectroscopic data of several perturbed and deeply-bound rovibrational states of the $\mathrm{A}^{1}\Sigma^{+}$ potential [Grochola et al., Chem. Phys. Lett., 2012, 535, 17-20], we conducted a targeted spectroscopic search and report the first observation of the lowest vibrational level of the $\mathrm{b}^{3}\Pi_{0}$ state in $^{6}\mathrm{Li}^{40}\mathrm{K}$. The transition frequency from $|\mathrm{X}^{1}\Sigma^{+},\,v=0,\,J=0>$ to $|\mathrm{b}^{3}\Pi_{0},\,v'=0,\,J'=1>$ is determined to be 314,230.5(5)GHz. Assisted by microwave spectroscopy, we resolved the rotational structure of $|\mathrm{b}^{3}\Pi_{0},\,v'=0>$ and extracted a rotational constant of $h\times8.576(44)$ GHz for the $\mathrm{b}^{3}\Pi_{0}$ state. From this, we deducted an energy separation between $|\mathrm{b}^{3}\Pi_{0},v'=0,J'=0>$ and $|\mathrm{X}^{1}\Sigma^{+},v=0,J=0>$ of $hc\times$10,481.03(2) $\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$. Our work provides timely and precise information on the deeply-bound region of the $\mathrm{b}^{3}\Pi_{0}$ triplet excited potential of LiK, and benefits future applications of ultracold LiK isotopologues in quantum simulation and quantum computation that demand long coherence times.

Title: Large-scale stochastic propagation method beyond the sequential approach
Authors: Zhichang Fu, Yunhai Li, Weiqing Zhou, Shengjun Yuan
Abstract: The $O(N)$ stochastic propagation method, which relies on the numerical solution of the time-dependent Schrödinger equation using random initial states, is widely used in large-scale first-principles calculations. In this work, we eliminate the conventional sequential computation of intermediate states by introducing a concurrent strategy that minimizes information redundancy. The new method, in its state-, moment-, and energy-based implementations, not only surpasses the time step constraint of sequential propagation but also maintains precision within the framework of the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem. Systematic benchmarking on one billion atoms within the tight-binding model demonstrates that our new concurrent method achieves up to an order-of-magnitude speedup, enabling the rapid computation of a wide range of electronic, optical, and transport properties. This performance breakthrough offers valuable insights for enhancing other time-propagation algorithms, including those employed in large-scale stochastic density functional theory.
