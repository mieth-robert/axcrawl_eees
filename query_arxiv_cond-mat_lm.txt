Title: Dumbbell Fermions and Spin Models on Honeycomb Lattices
Authors: T. Banks
Abstract: We express Kitaev's exact solution of spin models on the honeycomb lattice as a special case of a higher dimensional duality between staggered Majorana fermions and Pauli spins. General models with bilinear nearest neighbor couplings of spins and external magnetic fields are soluble in this way. Each model gives rise to an infinite number of single particle fermion Schrodinger equations, depending on the choice of discrete gauge field flux.

Title: Purely Electronic Chirality without Structural Chirality
Authors: Takayuki Ishitobi, Kazumasa Hattori
Abstract: We introduce the concept of purely electronic chirality, which arises in the absence of structural chirality. In condensed matter physics and chemistry, chirality has conventionally been understood as a mirror-image asymmetry in crystal or molecular structures. We demonstrate that certain electronic orders exhibit chirality-related properties without atomic displacement. Specifically, we investigate quadrupole orders to realize such purely electronic chirality with handedness that can be tuned by magnetic fields. As a representative example, we analyze a model featuring $120^\circ$ antiferro quadrupole orders on a distorted kagomé lattice, predicting various chirality-related responses in the nonmagnetic ordered phase of URhSn. Furthermore, as a phonon analog, chiral phonons can emerge in achiral crystals through coupling with the pEC order. Our results provide a distinct origin of chirality and a fundamental basis for exploring the interplay between electronic and structural chirality.

Title: Landau Theory of Dynamic Critical Phenomena in the Rayleigh-Benard System
Authors: Miroslav Grmela
Abstract: Physics involving more details than hydrodynamics is needed to formulate rate thermodynamics of the Rayleigh-Bénard system. The Boussinesq vector field is approached in the space of mesoscopic vector fields similarly as equilibrium sates are approached in externally unforced systems in the space of mesoscopic state variables. The approach is driven by gradient of a potential (called a rate entropy). This potential then provides the rate thermodynamics in the same way as the entropy provides thermodynamics for externally unforced systems. By restricting the investigation to a small neighborhood of the critical point we can use the rate-thermodynamic version of the Landau theory.

Title: Orbital Wigner functions and quantum transport in multiband systems
Authors: Johannes Mitscherling, Dan S. Borgnia, SuryaNeil Ahuja, Joel E. Moore, Vir B. Bulchandani
Abstract: Traditional theories of electron transport in crystals are based on the Boltzmann equation and do not capture physics arising from quantum coherence. We introduce a transport formalism based on ''orbital Wigner functions'', which accurately captures quantum coherent physics in multiband fermionic systems. We illustrate the power of this approach compared to traditional semiclassical transport theory by testing it numerically against microscopic simulations of one-dimensional, non-interacting, two-band systems -- the simplest systems capable of exhibiting inter-orbital coherence. We show that orbital Wigner functions accurately capture strongly non-equilibrium features of electron dynamics that lie beyond conventional Boltzmann theory, such as the ballistic transport of a relative phase between microscopic orbitals and topological Thouless pumping of charge both at non-zero temperature and away from the adiabatic limit. Our approach is motivated in part by modern ultracold atom experiments that can prepare and measure far-from-equilibrium charge transport and phase coherence in multiband fermionic systems, calling for correspondingly precise theories of transport. The quantitative accuracy exhibited by our approach, together with its capacity to capture nontrivial physics even at the ballistic scale, establishes orbital Wigner functions as an ideal starting point for developing a fully systematic theory of transport in crystals.

Title: Critical theories connecting gapped phases with $\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry from the duality web
Authors: Andreas Karch, Ryan C. Spieler
Abstract: We use the ideas behind the duality web to construct numerous conformal field theories mediating the phase transitions between various symmetry broken and topological phases. In particular we obtain the full field theory version of the Kennedy Tasaki transformation, mapping a gapless theory mediating a topological phase transition of symmetry protected topological orders to a standard symmetry breaking one in a 1+1 dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory. When we consider all possible discrete gauging operations, we obtain bosonic and fermionic webs with 9 critical theories per web, each connecting 4 separate gapped phases, some of them topological. Bosonization maps the two webs into each other. In addition to discussing the multi-critical theory connecting the four gapped phases in each phase diagram, we discuss the partially gapped theories connecting two of those four. Some of these are gapless symmetry protected topological phases.

Title: Elastic Quantum Criticality in Nematics and Altermagnets via the Elasto-Caloric Effect
Authors: Charles R. W. Steward, Grgur Palle, Markus Garst, Joerg Schmalian, Iksu Jang
Abstract: The coupling between electronic nematic degrees of freedom and acoustic phonons is known to significantly alter the universality class of a nematic quantum critical point (QCP). While non-Fermi-liquid behaviour emerges in the absence of lattice coupling, the inclusion of interactions with acoustic phonons results in observables such as heat capacity and single-particle scattering rate exhibiting only subleading non-analytic corrections to dominant Fermi-liquid terms. In this work, we demonstrate that the elastocaloric effect (ECE) -- the adiabatic temperature change under varying strain -- and the thermal expansion deviate from this pattern. Despite lattice coupling weakening the singularity of the ECE, it preserves a dominant non-Fermi-liquid temperature dependence. By drawing analogies between nematic systems and field-tuned altermagnets, we further show that similar responses are expected for the ECE near altermagnetic QCPs. We classify the types of piezomagnetic couplings and analyse the regimes arising from field-tuned magnetoelastic interactions. Our findings are shown to be consistent with the scaling theory for elastic quantum criticality and they further emphasize the suitability of the ECE as a sensitive probe near QCPs.

Title: Dynamical Confinement and Magnetic Traps for Charges and Spins
Authors: Afshin Besharat, Alexander A. Penin
Abstract: We use the effective field theory approach to systematically study the dynamics of classical and quantum systems in an oscillating magnetic field. We find that the fast field oscillations give rise to an effective interaction which is able to confine charged particles as well as neutral particles with a spin magnetic moment. The effect is reminiscent of the renown dynamical stabilization of charges by the oscillating electric field and provides a foundation for a new class of magnetic traps. The properties characteristic to the dynamical magnetic confinement are reviewed.

Title: Projected and Solvable Topological Heavy Fermion Model of Twisted Bilayer Graphene
Authors: Haoyu Hu, Zhi-Da Song, B. Andrei Bernevig
Abstract: We investigate the topological heavy-fermion (THF) model of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) in the projected limit, where only the flat bands are present in the low-energy spectrum. Such limit has been previously analyzed in momentum-space Bistritzer-MacDonald-type continuum models, but not in a real-space formalism. In this regime, the Hubbard interaction ($U_1$) of the $f$-electrons is larger than the bandwidth ($2M$) of the flat bands but smaller than the gap ($\gamma$) between the flat and remote bands. In the THF model, concentrated charge (in real space) and concentrated Berry curvature (in momentum space) are respectively realized by exponentially localized $f$-orbitals and itinerant Dirac $c$-electrons. Local moments naturally arise from $f$-orbitals. Hybridizing the $f$-electrons with $c$-electrons produces power-law tails of the flat-band Wannier functions, raising the question of relevance of the local moment picture in the projected $U_1\ll \gamma$ limit. Nonetheless, we find that the local moments remain stable as long as $U_1 \gg \Delta(\omega)$ for $|\omega|\lesssim U_1$, where $\Delta(\omega)\sim \gamma^2 N(\omega)$ is the hybridization function seen by each $f$-site, and $N(\omega)$ is the density of states of the Dirac $c$-bands. Notably, the comparison between $U_1$ and $\gamma$ is irrelevant to the local moment formation if $N(\omega)$ is unknown. Within the framework of THF, we also derive the correlated self-energy of the flat bands using the Hubbard-I approximation and estimate the coupling strength between the local moments. Finally, we comment that, in the regime of extremely concentrated Berry curvature, the single-particle gap between flat bands and remote bands vanishes and the interaction is always larger than the gap.

Title: Towards a global phase diagram of Ce-based dipolar-octupolar pyrochlore magnets under magnetic fields
Authors: Zhengbang Zhou, Yong Baek Kim
Abstract: Recent experiments have established a strong case for Ce$_2$(Zr, Sn, Hf)$_2$O$_7$ to host $\pi$-flux quantum spin ice (QSI). However, an irrefutable conclusion still requires strong, multifaceted evidence. In dipolar-octupolar (DO) compounds, external magnetic fields only strongly couple with the dipolar component $\tau_z$ along its local z-axis in contrast to octupolar components $\tau^{x,y}$. This gives rise to the unique ways magnetic fields interact with the system and, in turn, provides us with a variety of tuning knobs to generate comprehensive experimental results. In this work, we focus on magnetic fields along the (110), (111), and (001) directions and present a plethora of remarkable experimental signatures to probe the underlying physics of $\pi$-flux QSI using gauge mean field theory (GMFT) and Monte Carlo simulations. In particular, we present unique signatures in magnetic field-dependent phase diagrams, equal-time and dynamical structure factors, and magnetostriction.

Title: High-dimensional random landscapes: from typical to large deviations
Authors: Valentina Ros
Abstract: In these notes we discuss tools and concepts that emerge when studying high-dimensional random landscapes, i.e., random functions on high-dimensional spaces. As an example, we consider a high-dimensional inference problem in two forms: matrix denoising (Case 1) and tensor denoising (Case 2). We show how to map the inference problem onto the optimization problem of a high-dimensional landscape, which exhibits distinct geometrical properties in the two Cases. We discuss methods for characterizing typical realizations of these landscapes and their optimization through local dynamics. We conclude by highlighting connections between the landscape problem and Large Deviation Theory.

Title: Enhancement of Superconductivity in WP via Oxide-Assisted Chemical Vapor Transport
Authors: Daniel J. Campbell, Wen-Chen Lin, John Collini, Yun Suk Eo, Yash Anand, Shanta Saha, Dave Graf, Peter Y. Zavalij, Johnpierre Paglione
Abstract: Tungsten monophosphide (WP) has been reported to superconduct below 0.8 K, and theoretical work has predicted an unconventional Cooper pairing mechanism. Here we present data for WP single crystals grown by means of chemical vapor transport (CVT) of WO3, P, and I2. In comparison to synthesis using WP powder as a starting material, this technique results in samples with substantially decreased low-temperature scattering and favors a more three dimensional morphology. We also find that the resistive superconducting transitions in these samples begin above 1 K. Variation in Tc is often found in strongly correlated superconductors, and its presence in WP could be the result of influence from a competing order and/or a non s-wave gap.

Title: The origin and scarcity of breathing pyrochlore lattices in spinel oxides
Authors: Valentina Mazzotti, Solveig S. Aamlid, Abraham A. Mancilla, Janna Machts, Megan Rutherford, Jörg Rottler, Kenji M. Kojima, Alannah M. Hallas
Abstract: Breathing pyrochlores are a unique class of materials characterized by a three-dimensional lattice of corner-sharing tetrahedra. However, unlike conventional pyrochlores where all tetrahedra are identical in size, the breathing pyrochlore lattice is composed of alternating large and small tetrahedra. Experimental realizations of the breathing pyrochlore lattice are rare but they do occur in $A$-site ordered spinels, as in the prototype materials LiGaCr$_4$O$_8$ and LiInCr$_4$O$_8$. In this work, we demonstrate that Cr cannot be straightforwardly substituted with other magnetic transition metals while retaining the breathing pyrochlore structure. To explain this observation, we perform density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate the formation and stability of LiGaCr$_4$O$_8$ and LiInCr$_4$O$_8$, focusing on the energy scales associated with $A$ and $B$-site orderings as well as the magnetic exchange interactions of Cr ions. We identify the strong octahedral site preference of Cr$^{3+}$ as a key factor in protecting the structural integrity of the pyrochlore sublattice, which in turn enables the breathing distortion to proceed. We also demonstrate that the charge order between the $A$ (Li) and $A'$ sites (Ga or In) is maintained at all temperatures up to decomposition. Furthermore, while the magnetic exchange interactions constitute a relatively small energy scale and therefore do not play a fundamental role in the structural stability of LiGaCr$_4$O$_8$ and LiInCr$_4$O$_8$, magnetism may play a critical role in setting the magnitude of the tetrahedral distortion. Ultimately, we conclude that the scarcity of breathing pyrochlores is a consequence of the stringent requirement on site ordering for their formation.

Title: Quantum spin liquid phase in the Shastry-Sutherland model revealed by high-precision infinite projected entangled-pair states
Authors: Philippe Corboz, Yining Zhang, Boris Ponsioen, Frédéric Mila
Abstract: The Shastry-Sutherland model is an effective model of the layered material SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$, which exhibits an extremely rich phase diagram as a function of pressure and magnetic field. Motivated by the recent controversy regarding its phase diagram at zero magnetic field, we perform large-scale simulations based on infinite projected entangled-pair states (iPEPS), a two-dimensional tensor network ansatz to represent the ground state directly in the thermodynamic limit. By employing the latest optimization techniques, we obtain variational states with lower energy than previous results obtained from other methods. Using systematic extrapolations to the exact infinite bond dimension limit, our simulations reveal a narrow quantum spin liquid phase between the plaquette and antiferromagnetic phases in the range $0.785(5) \le J'/J \le 0.82(1)$.

Title: Moiré-Tunable Localization of Simultaneous Type I and Type II Band Alignment in a MoSe2/WS2 Heterobilayer
Authors: Jiaxuan Guo, Zachary H. Withers, Ziling Li, Bowen Hou, Alexander Adler, Jianwei Ding, Victor Chang Lee, Roland K. Kawakami, Gerd Schönhense, Alice Kunin, Thomas K. Allison, Diana Y. Qiu
Abstract: Moiré heterobilayers exhibiting spatially varying band alignment and electron and hole localization that can be precisely controlled through the twist angle have emerged as exciting platforms for studying complex quantum phenomena. While most heterobilayers of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have a type II band alignment, the introduction of type I band alignment could enable stronger light-matter coupling and enhanced radiative emission. Here, we show through a combination of first-principles GW plus Bethe Salpeter equation (GW-BSE) calculations and time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (tr-ARPES) measurements that contrary to previous understanding, the MoSe2/WS2 heterobilayer has a type I band alignment at large twist angles and simultaneous regions of type I and type II band alignment due to the structural reconstruction in different high symmetry regions at small twist angles. In tr-ARPES, consistent with our calculations, a long-lived electron population is only observed in MoSe2 for samples with large twist angles, while in samples with small twist angles, signals from two distinct long-lived excitons are observed. Moreover, despite the near degeneracy of the conduction bands of the two layers, no excitonic hybridization occurs, suggesting that previously observed absorption peaks in this material arise from lattice reconstruction. Our findings clarify the complex energy landscape in MoSe2/WS2 heterostructures, where the coexistence of type I and type II band alignment opens the door to moiré-tunable optoelectronic devices with intrinsic lateral heterojunctions.

Title: Fast spin precession and strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy in ferrimagnetic Mn4N thin films improved by Pd buffer layer
Authors: Yao Zhang, Yun Kim, Peter P. Murmu, Dingbin Huang, Deyuan Lyu, Jian-Ping Wang, Xiaojia Wang, Simon Granville
Abstract: Ferrimagnets take the advantages of both ferromagnets and antiferromagnets making them promise for spintronic applications. Here we prepared ferrimagnetic Mn4N thin films with high Curie temperature and investigated the crystalline structure and magnetic properties affected by the Pd buffer layer. We demonstrated that both crystalline quality and perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) of Mn4N thin films are enhanced significantly due to the relaxation of tensile stress induced by the Pd buffer layer. We also demonstrated a fast spin precession at room temperature, almost 100 GHz, in Mn4N thin films. With the characteristics of high thermal stability, enhanced PMA by buffer layer and fast spin precession, Mn4N thin film is a promising material for spintronic applications.

Title: Higher-order skyrmion crystal in van der Waals Kitaev triangular antiferromagnet NiI2

Abstract: Topological spin textures, such as magnetic skyrmions, hold great promise for spintronics applications. However, most known skyrmion systems are restricted to a topological charge of one and require an external magnetic field for stabilization. Here, we report the discovery of a skyrmion crystal with a topological number of two in an insulating van der Waals magnet NiI2. We unveil the static and dynamic magnetic correlations across three temperature-driven magnetic phases using neutron scattering measurements, simulations, and model optimisation. By employing a minimal Kitaev-Heisenberg Hamiltonian, we reproduce the experimentally observed excitations and confirm the emergence of the higher-order skyrmion crystal through Monte Carlo simulations. Remarkably, this exotic phase arises without the need for a magnetic field, presenting a novel platform for controlling complex spin textures in an accessible material. These findings establish NiI2 as a pivotal material, bridging fundamental quantum magnetism with advancements in skyrmionics and multiferroic technologies.

Title: Indexing current-voltage characteristics using a hash function
Authors: T. Tanamoto, S. Furukawa, R. Kitahara, T. Mizutani, K. Ono, T. Hiramoto
Abstract: Differentiating between devices of the same size is essential for ensuring their reliability. However, identifying subtle differences can be challenging, particularly when the devices share similar characteristics, such as transistors on a wafer. To address this issue, we propose an indexing method for current-voltage characteristics that assigns proximity numbers to similar devices. Specifically, we demonstrate the application of the locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) algorithm to Coulomb blockade phenomena observed in PMOSFETs and nanowire transistors. In this approach, lengthy data on current characteristics are replaced with hashed IDs, facilitating identification of individual devices, and streamlining the management of a large number of devices.

Title: Ultrathin Ga$_2$O$_3$ Tunneling Contact for 2D Transition-metal Dichalcogenides Transistor
Authors: Yun Li, Tinghe Yun, Bohan Wei, Haoran Mu, Luojun Du, Nan Cui, Guangyu Zhang, Shenghuang Lin
Abstract: The development of two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) based transistors has been constrained by high contact resistance and inadequate current delivery, primarily stemming from metal-induced gap states and Fermi level pinning. Research into addressing these challenges is essential for the advancing 2D transistors from laboratory experiments to industrial-grade production. In this work, we present amorphous Ga$_2$O$_3$ as a novel tunneling contact layer for multilayer WS2-based field-effect transistors (FETs) to enhance electrical performance. The addition of this innovative tunneling layer avoid Schottky barrier forming while finally change into a tunneling barrier with the barrier height to just 3.7 meV, near-ideal ohmic contacts. This approach effectively reduces contact resistance to only 2.38 k$\Omega\,\mu$m and specific contact resistivity as low as $3 \times 10^{-5}$ $\Omega$cm$^2$. A record-high electron mobility of 296 cm$^2$ V$^{-1}$ s$^{-1}$ and ON-OFF ratio over 106 are realized for WS$_2$ transistor at room temperature. Compared to other tunneling materials, ultrathin Ga$_2$O$_3$ layer offers scalability, cost-efficient production and broad substrate compatibility, making it well-suited for seamless integration with industrial wafer-scale electronics. A robust device performance remains highly consistent in a large-scale transistor array fabricated on $1.5\times 1.5$ cm$^2$ chips, with the average mobility closing to 200 cm$^2$ V$^{-1}$ s$^{-1}$. These findings establish a new benchmark for contact performance in 2D transistors and prove the potential of tunneling contact engineering in advancing high-performance, scalable 29 pelectronics with promising applications in quantum computing and communication.

Title: Orbital Magnetism in Honeycomb Ladder
Authors: Tomonari Mizoguchi, Soshun Ozaki, Hiroyasu Matsuura
Abstract: We investigate the orbital magnetic susceptibility of the tight-binding model for the honeycomb ladder with the additional vertical hopping. Despite being one-dimensional, the magnetic flux penetrating the hexagonal rings affects the energetics of electrons, resulting in the finite orbital magnetic response. We find that the orbital magnetic susceptibility is sensitive to the parameters as well as the chemical potential. At half-filling, the response is diamagnetic when the system is close to the pure honeycomb ladder, whereas it turns to paramagnetic when it is close to the two-leg ladder. We also find several characteristic properties away from half-filling, such as the diamagnetic response at the band top and bottom, and the large paramagnetic response at the band gap sandwiched by the divergent density of states.

Title: Antiferromagnetic and bond-order-wave phases in the half-filled two-dimensional optical Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-Hubbard model
Authors: Andy Tanjaroon Ly, Benjamin Cohen-Stead, Steven Johnston
Abstract: Electron-phonon ($e$-ph) interactions arise in many strongly correlated quantum materials from the modulation of the nearest-neighbor hopping integrals, as in the celebrated Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. Nevertheless, relatively few non-perturbative studies of correlated SSH models have been conducted in dimensions greater than one, and those that have been done have primarily focused on bond models, where generalized displacements independently modulate each hopping integral. We conducted a sign-problem free determinant quantum Monte Carlo study of the optical SSH-Hubbard model on a two-dimensional square lattice, where site-centered phonon modes simultaneously modulate pairs of nearest-neighbor hopping integrals. We report the model's low-temperature phase diagram in the challenging adiabatic regime ($\Omega/E_\mathrm{F} \sim 1/8$). It exhibits insulating antiferromagnetic Mott and bond-order-wave (BOW) phases with a narrow region of coexistence between them. We also find that a critical $e$-ph coupling is required to stabilize the BOW phase in the small $U$ limit. Lastly, in stark contrast to recent findings for the model's bond variant, we find no evidence for a long-range antiferromagnetism in the pure $(U/t=0)$ optical SSH model.

Title: Scale-free localization versus Anderson localization in unidirectional quasiperiodic lattices
Authors: Yu Zhang, Luhong Su, Shu Chen
Abstract: Scale-free localization emerging in non-Hermitian physics has recently garnered significant attention. In this work, we explore the interplay between scale-free localization and Anderson localization by investigating a unidirectional quasiperiodic model with generalized boundary conditions. We derive analytical expressions of Lyapunov exponent from the bulk equations. Together with the boundary equation, we can determine properties of eigenstates and spectrum and establish their exact relationships with the quasiperiodic potential strength and boundary parameter. While eigenstates exhibit scale-free localization in the weak disorder regime, they become localized in the strong disorder regime. The scale-free and Anderson localized states satisfy the boundary equation in distinct ways, leading to different localization properties and scaling behaviors. Generalizing our framework, we design a model with exact energy edges separating the scale-free and Anderson localized states via the mosaic modulation of quasiperiodic potentials. Our models can be realized experimentally in electric circuits.

Title: OBELiX: A Curated Dataset of Crystal Structures and Experimentally Measured Ionic Conductivities for Lithium Solid-State Electrolytes
Authors: Félix Therrien, Jamal Abou Haibeh, Divya Sharma, Rhiannon Hendley, Alex Hernández-García, Sun Sun, Alain Tchagang, Jiang Su, Samuel Huberman, Yoshua Bengio, Hongyu Guo, Homin Shin
Abstract: Solid-state electrolyte batteries are expected to replace liquid electrolyte lithium-ion batteries in the near future thanks to their higher theoretical energy density and improved safety. However, their adoption is currently hindered by their lower effective ionic conductivity, a quantity that governs charge and discharge rates. Identifying highly ion-conductive materials using conventional theoretical calculations and experimental validation is both time-consuming and resource-intensive. While machine learning holds the promise to expedite this process, relevant ionic conductivity and structural data is scarce. Here, we present OBELiX, a domain-expert-curated database of $\sim$600 synthesized solid electrolyte materials and their experimentally measured room temperature ionic conductivities gathered from literature. Each material is described by their measured composition, space group and lattice parameters. A full-crystal description in the form of a crystallographic information file (CIF) is provided for ~320 structures for which atomic positions were available. We discuss various statistics and features of the dataset and provide training and testing splits that avoid data leakage. Finally, we benchmark seven existing ML models on the task of predicting ionic conductivity and discuss their performance. The goal of this work is to facilitate the use of machine learning for solid-state electrolyte materials discovery.

Title: Poincaré sphere engineering of dynamical ferroelectric topological solitons
Authors: Lingyuan Gao, Yijie Shen, Sergei Prokhorenko, Yousra Nahas, Laurent Bellaiche
Abstract: Geometric representation lays the basis for understanding and flexible tuning of topological transitions in many physical systems. An example is given by the Poincaré sphere (PS) that provides an intuitive and continuous parameterization of the spin or orbital angular momentum (OAM) light states. Here, we apply this geometric construction to understand and continuously encode dynamical topologies of ferroelectric solitons driven by OAM-tunable light. We show that: (1) PS engineering enables controlled creation of dynamic polar antiskyrmions that are rarely found in ferroelectrics; (2) We link such topological transition to the tuning of the light beam as a ``knob'' from OAM (PS pole) to non-OAM (PS equator) modes; (3) Intermediate OAM-state structured light results in new ferroelectric topologies of temporally hybrid skyrmion-antiskyrmion states. Our study offers new approaches of robust control and flexible tuning of topologies of matter using structured light.

Title: Investigating the Optical and Thermodynamic Properties of 2D MoGe2P4 : Potential Material for Photothermal Therapy
Authors: Sudipta Saha, Arpan Sur, Labonno Saha, Md. Kawsar Alam
Abstract: In this study, we analyzed the optical, thermodynamic and electronic properties of 2D MoGe2P4 from the first principle calculation. 2D MoGe2P4 demonstrates superior optical absorption in the NIR-I biological window (750 nm ~ 1000 nm) with a peak near 808 nm and excellent thermal conductivity (63 Wm-1K-1). Finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations and Heat simulations demonstrate that 2D MoGe2P4 possesses efficient photothermal conversion under low laser power (0.5 W/cm2) which is operated in 808nm. Theoretical investigation demonstrates, rapid temperature elevation ({\Delta}T = 24.8 °C) of the 2D MoGe2P4 within two minutes and photothermal stability over multiple laser cycles, achieving temperatures suitable for effective photothermal therapeutic applications. Photothermal therapy (PTT) is an emerging tumor treatment technique that utilizes photothermal agents (PTAs) to convert near-infrared (NIR) light into localized heat for tumor ablation. To enhance biocompatibility, we analyzed the PEGylation of 2D MoGe2P4 nanosheets through molecular dynamics simulation. PEGylation at human body temperature was stable which signifies 2D MoGe2P4's prospect in therapeutic applications. This research highlights the potential of 2D MoGe2P4 as an emerging material for PTA, establishing a foundation for experimental and clinical trials.

Title: Theoretical studies on the spin-charge dynamics in Kondo-lattice models
Authors: Masahito Mochizuki, Rintaro Eto
Abstract: The Kondo-lattice model describes a typical spin-charge coupled system in which localized spins and itinerant electrons are strongly coupled via exchange interactions and exhibits a variety of long-wavelength magnetic orders originating from the nesting of Fermi surfaces. Recently, several magnetic materials that realize this model have been discovered experimentally, and they have turned out to exhibit rich topological magnetic phases including skyrmion crystals and hedgehog lattices. Our recent theoretical studies based on the large-scale spin-dynamics simulations have revealed several interesting nonequilibrium phenomena and excitation dynamics in the Kondo-lattice model, e.g., dynamical magnetic topology switching and peculiar spin-wave modes of the skyrmion crystals and the hedgehog lattices under irradiation with electromagnetic waves such as microwaves and light. These achievements are expected to open a new research field to explore novel nonequilibrium topological phenomena and related material functions of the spin-charge coupled magnets.

Title: Nearly Complete Segregation of Submerged Grains in a Rotating Drum
Authors: Yu Chen, Deheng Wei, Si Suo, Mingrui Dong, Yixiang Gan
Abstract: Density-driven segregations, extensively studied in a simple rotating drum, are enriched with a wide range of underlying physics. Diverse symmetrical segregation patterns formed by mixing two types of dry mono-sized grains have been revealed due to variations in heavy and light grain densities, $\rho_h$ and $\rho_l$, and rotating speeds, $\omega$. We engender experimentally a nearly complete segregation, not occurring in dry conditions of the same $\rho_h$, $\rho_l$, and $\omega$, in submerged states. Further, based on the experiment-validated simulations, using coupled computational fluid dynamics and discrete element method, it is found the mixing index can be well predicted over a wide parameter space in the effective density ratio, $D=(\rho_h-\rho_f)/(\rho_l-\rho_f)$ with $\rho_f$ being the fluid density. Specifically, with increasing $D$ well-mixed states transit to fully-segregated states with a rising number of vortices and severer asymmetrical patterns. When the global Reynolds number $\mathrm{Re}_g$ is enlarged, the vortex area of heavy particles shrinks for lower $D$, while the area of light particles gradually saturates; meanwhile, for higher $D$ a new vortex with a continuously expanded area can be encountered in the light particle zone. These results improve our understanding of segregation transitions especially in submerged granular systems and shed new light on various science and engineering practices.

Title: Real-space representation of the second Chern number
Authors: T. Shiina, F. Hamano, T. Fukui
Abstract: We extend Kitaev's real-space formulation of the first Chern number to the second Chern number and establish a computational framework for its evaluation. To test its validity, we apply the derived formula to the disordered Wilson-Dirac model and analyze its ability to capture topological properties in the presence of disorder. Our results demonstrate that the real-space approach provides a viable method for characterizing higher-dimensional topological phases beyond momentum-space formulations.

Title: Impact of Pressure and Apical Oxygen Vacancies on Superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$
Authors: Chen Lu, Ming Zhang, Zhiming Pan, Congjun Wu, Fan Yang
Abstract: The bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure has recently emerged as a promising system for high-$T_c$ superconductivity (SC). In this work, we investigate the fate of the SC properties in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ under pressure, focusing on the effects of structural deformation and apical oxygen vacancies. Employing a low-energy effective $t$-$J_{\parallel}$-$J_{\perp}$ model for the $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals within the slave-boson mean-field approach, we demonstrate that the SC pairing strength is significantly enhanced in the high-pressure tetragonal $I4/mmm$ phase compared to the ambient pressure orthorhombic $Amam$ phase. Furthermore, by simulating random configurations of apical oxygen vacancies, we show that oxygen vacancies suppress both pairing strength and superfluid density. These results underscore the critical role of pressure and oxygen stoichiometry in tuning the SC of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, providing key insights into optimizing its high-$T_c$ behavior.

Title: Discovery of a new phase in thin flakes of KV$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ under pressure
Authors: Zheyu Wang, Lingfei Wang, King Yau Yip, Ying Kit Tsui, Tsz Fung Poon, Wenyan Wang, Chun Wai Tsang, Shanmin Wang, David Graf, Alexandre Pourret, Gabriel Seyfarth, Georg Knebel, Kwing To Lai, Wing Chi Yu, Wei Zhang, Swee K. Goh
Abstract: We report results of magnetotransport measurements on KV$_3$Sb$_5$ thin flakes under pressure. Our zero-field electrical resistance reveals an additional anomaly emerging under pressure ($p$), marking a previously unidentified phase boundary $T^{\rm \ast}$($p$). Together with the established $T_{\rm CDW}(p)$ and $T_c(p)$, denoting the charge-density-wave transition and a superconducting transition, respectively, the temperature-pressure phase diagram of KV$_3$Sb$_5$ features a rich interplay among multiple phases. The Hall coefficient evolves reasonably smoothly when crossing the $T^{\rm \ast}$ phase boundary compared with the variation when crossing $T_{\rm CDW}$, indicating the preservation of the pristine electronic structure. The mobility spectrum analysis provides further insights into distinguishing different phases. Finally, our high-pressure quantum oscillation studies up to 31 T combined with density functional theory calculations further demonstrate that the new phase does not reconstruct the Fermi surface, confirming that the translational symmetry of the pristine metallic state is preserved.

Title: Twinning in ferromagnetic Heusler Rh2MnSb epitaxial thin films

Abstract: Epitaxially grown full Heusler alloy of Rh2MnSb thin films were prepared for the first time using DC magnetron sputtering. The films were deposited on MgO [001] substrates with a deposition temperature of 600°C, 700°C, and 800°C. We report the structural, morphological, optical, magneto-optical, and magnetic properties of the films with a 200 nm nominal thickness. The grown-at-600°C film was close to stoichiometric and exhibited L21 ordering typical for Heusler alloys. The single-phase Rh2MnSb film had a tetragonal structure with lattice parameters close to the bulk material. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed the metallic character of the film free from contamination. The tetragonal films exhibited discernible regular twinning with the majority of twin domains with the c-axis perpendicular to the surface due to a substrate constraint. The twin formation was studied by atomic force and transmission electron microscopy and by X-ray diffraction. Magnetic measurements showed TC of about 220-275 K and saturation magnetization of about 55 emu/g, close to the bulk material. Magneto-optical Kerr effect measurements of the film prepared at 600 °C affirmed paramagnetic behavior at room temperature and suggested the half-metallic behavior. The observed properties highlight the potential for further investigations of Rh2MnSb's thin films, focusing on compositional and structural control.

Title: Walks in Rotation Spaces Return Home When Doubled and Scaled
Authors: Jean-Pierre Eckmann, Tsvi Tlusty
Abstract: The dynamics of numerous physical systems can be described as a series of rotation operations, i.e., walks in the manifold of the rotation group. A basic question with practical applications is how likely and under what conditions such walks return to the origin (the identity rotation), which means that the physical system returns to its initial state. In three dimensions, we show that almost every walk in SO(3), even a very complicated one, will preferentially return to the origin simply by traversing the walk twice in a row and uniformly scaling all rotation angles. We explain why traversing the walk only once almost never suffices to return, and comment on the problem in higher dimensions of SO(n).

Title: Isotropic superconductivity in pressurized trilayer nickelate La4Ni3O10

Abstract: Evidence of superconductivity (SC) has recently been reported in pressurized La3Ni2O7 and La4Ni3O10, providing a new platform to explore high-temperature superconductivity. However, while zero resistance state has been observed, experimental characterization of the superconducting properties of pressurized nickelates is still limited and experimentally challenging. Here, we present the first full temperature dependence of the upper critical field Hc2 measurement in La4Ni3O10 single crystal, achieved by combining high magnetic field and high-pressure techniques. Remarkably, the Hc2 of La4Ni3O10 is nearly isotropic, with the anisotropic parameter monotonically increasing from 1.4 near Tc to 1 at lower temperatures. By analyzing the Hc2 using the two-band model, we uncover that the anisotropic diffusivity of the bands, primarily originating from d(z2 ) and d(x2-y2 ) orbitals, is well compensated, resulting in an unusually isotropic superconducting state. These findings provide critical experimental evidence that underscores the significant role of the d(z2 ) orbital in enabling superconductivity in pressurized Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates.

Title: Nodeless Superconducting State in the Presence of Zero-Field Staggered Magnetization in CeRh$_{2}$As$_{2}$
Authors: J. Juraszek, G. Chajewski, D. Kaczorowski, M. Konczykowski, D.F. Agterberg, T. Cichorek
Abstract: The tetragonal heavy-fermion superconductor CeRh$_{2}$As$_{2}$ with a critical temperature $T_c$ $\approx$ 0.34 K exhibits an intriguing magnetic field-induced transition between likely distinct superconducting states. In zero field, an even-parity state emerges within another ordered phase of unknown origin with $T_0$ $\approx$ 0.54 K. Here, we investigated the spin-singlet state of CeRh$_{2}$As$_{2}$ at temperatures down to $\approx$ 0.02$T_c$ by means of local magnetization measurements performed using micro-Hall probe magnetometry. We determined the temperature dependencies of the lower critical field for both in-plane and out-of-plane field directions, and demonstrated their consistency with predominantly fully gapped superconductivity. In the magnetization measured along the $a$ axis, we found a clear increase below $T_0$, while no similar anomaly was observed along the $c$ axis. Our results place important constraints on the spin-singlet order parameter in CeRh$_{2}$As$_{2}$ and highlight an important role of static magnetic moments in the nature of $T_0$ phase.

Title: Localization versus incommemsurability for finite boson system in one-dimensional disordered lattice
Authors: Barnali Chakrabarti, Arnaldo Gammal
Abstract: We explore the effect of disorder on a few-boson system in a finite one-dimensional quasiperiodic potential covering the full interaction ranging from uncorrelated to strongly correlated particles. We apply numerically exact multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree for bosons to obtain the few-body emergent states in a finite lattice for both commensurate and incommensurate filling factors. The detailed characterization is done by the measures of one- and two-body correlations, fragmentation, order parameter. For commensurate filling, we trace the conventional fingerprints of disorder induced localization in the weakly interacting limit, however we observe robustness of fragmented and strongly correlated Mott in the disordered lattice. For filling factor smaller than one, we observe existing delocalization fraction of particles interplay in a complex way. For strongly interacting limit, the introduced disorder drags the fragmented superfluid of primary lattice to Mott localization. For filling factor larger than one in the primary lattice, the extra delocalization always resides on commensurate background of Mott-insulator. We observe beyond Bose-Hubbard physics in the fermionization limit when the pairing bosons fragment into two orbitals -- Mott dimerization happens. The introduced disorder first relocates the dimers, then strong disorder starts to interfere with the background Mott correlation. These findings unlock a rich landscape of unexplored localization process in the quasiperiodic potentials and pave the way for engineering exotic quantum many-body states with ultracold atoms.

Title: Thermal conductance at superradiant phase transition in quantum Rabi model
Authors: Tsuyoshi Yamamoto, Yasuhiro Tokura
Abstract: The quantum Rabi model exhibits a superradiant phase transition when the coupling becomes strong, even though it involves only two components: a two-level atom and a single bosonic mode. This phase transition is referred to as a few-body quantum phase transition, in contrast to conventional phase transitions in many-body systems. In this work, we investigate heat transport across an atom embedded in bosonic modes, modeled by the quantum Rabi model, between two thermal baths. We found a manifestation of the superradiant phase transition in the thermal conductance, which represents the linear response to a temperature bias. Our work can be helpful for the development of quantum heat devices utilizing controllable few-body phase transitions.

Title: Active energy harvesting and work transduction by hair-cell bundles in bullfrog's inner ear
Authors: Yanathip Thipmaungprom, Laila Saliekh, Rodrigo Alonso, Édgar Roldán, Florian Berger, Roman Belousov
Abstract: Hair cells actively drive oscillations of their mechanosensitive organelles -- the hair bundles that enable hearing and balance sensing in vertebrates. Why and how some hair cells expend energy by sustaining this oscillatory motion in order to fulfill their function as signal sensors and others -- as amplifiers, remains unknown. We develop a stochastic thermodynamic theory to describe energy flows in a periodically-driven hair bundle. Our analysis of thermodynamic fluxes associated with hair bundles' motion and external sinusoidal stimulus reveals that these organelles operate as thermodynamic work-to-work machines under different operational modes. One operational mode transduces the signal's power into the cell, whereas another allows the external stimulus to harvest the energy supplied by the cell. These two regimes might represent thermodynamic signatures of signal sensing and amplification respectively. In addition to work transduction and energy harvesting, our model also substantiates the capability of hair-cell bundles to operate as heaters and and active feedback refrigerators at the expense of external driving. We quantify the performance and robustness of the work-to-work operating modes of hair bundles revealing a maximal thermodynamic efficiency of around 80 percent of the transduced work.

Title: Resonant current from singlet-triplet state mixing in coupled quantum dots
Authors: G. Giavaras
Abstract: Electrically driven spin resonances in double quantum dots can lift the spin blockade and give rise to a resonant current. This current can probe the properties of coupled two-spin states for different quantum dot configurations. Using a Floquet-Markov quantum transport model we compute the resonant current for different driving amplitudes and ac field frequencies in spin-orbit coupled quantum dots. We show that the resonant current has a very rich interference pattern which can give valuable insight into the singlet-triplet state mixing.

Title: Nontrivial damping of magnetization currents in perturbed spin chains
Authors: Mariel Kempa, Markus Kraft, Jiaozi Wang, Robin Steinigeweg
Abstract: Since perturbations are omnipresent in physics, understanding their impact on the dynamics of quantum many-body systems is a vitally important but notoriously difficult question. On the one hand, random-matrix and typicality arguments suggest a rather simple damping in the overwhelming majority of cases, e.g., exponential damping according to Fermi's Golden Rule. On the other hand, counterexamples are known to exist, and it remains unclear how frequent and under which conditions such counterexamples appear. In our work, we consider the spin-1/2 XXZ chain as a paradigmatic example of a quantum many-body system and study the dynamics of the magnetization current in the easy-axis regime. Using numerical simulations based on dynamical quantum typicality, we show that the standard autocorrelation function is damped in a nontrivial way and that only a modified version of this function is damped in a simple manner. Employing projection-operator techniques in addition, we demonstrate that both, the nontrivial and simple damping relation can be understood on perturbative grounds. Our results are in agreement with earlier findings for the particle current in the Hubbard chain.

Title: Lattice distortion tuning resistivity invar effect in high entropy alloys
Authors: Hao Chen, Yuanji Xu, Lihua Liu, Yue Chen, Jan Wróbel, Daoyong Cong, Fuyang Tian
Abstract: Materials with an ultra-low temperature coefficient of resistivity are desired for the temperature and flow sensors in high-precision electronic measuring systems. In this work, the Kubo-Greenwood formula, implemented in ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, is employed to predict the finite-temperature resistivity of multi-component alloys with severe lattice distortion. We observe a tiny change in resistivity over a wide temperature range in high-entropy alloys. The electronic resistivity invar effect in B2 Ni$_{25}$Co$_{25}$(HfTiZr)$_{50}$ Elinvar alloys results from a balance between intrinsic and residual resistivity. This effect is associated with atomic displacements from ideal lattice sites, which are caused by lattice thermal vibrations and chemical disorder-induced lattice distortions. It is further evidenced by a decrease in lattice distortion with temperature and changes in the electronic density of states.

Title: The diffusive dynamics and electrochemical regulation of weak polyelectrolytes across liquid interfaces
Authors: Giulia Laura Celora, Ralf Blossey, Andreas Munch, Barbara Wagner
Abstract: We propose a framework to study the spatio-temporal evolution of liquid-liquid phase separation of weak polyelectrolytes in ionic solutions. Unlike strong polyelectrolytes, which carry a fixed charge, the charge state of weak polyelectrolytes is modulated by the electrochemical environment through protonation and deprotonation processes. Leveraging numerical simulations and analysis, our work reveals how solution acidity (pH) influences the formation, interactions, and structural properties of phase-separated coacervates. We find that pH gradients can be maintained across coacervate interfaces resulting in a clear distinction in the electro-chemical properties within and outside the coacervate. By regulating the charge state of weak polyelectrolytes, pH gradients interact and modulate the electric double layer forming at coacervate interfaces eventually determining how they interact. Further linear and nonlinear analyses of stationary localised solutions reveal a rich spectrum of behaviours that significantly distinguish weak from strong polyelectrolytes. Overall, our results demonstrate the importance of charge regulation on phase-separating solutions of charge-bearing molecules and the possibility of harnessing charge-regulated mechanisms to control coacervates and shape their stability and spatial organisation.

Title: Semiconducting and superconducting properties of 2D hexagonal materials
Authors: Dominik Szczȩśniak, Jakub T. Gnyp, Marta Kielak
Abstract: The beginning of high interest in two-dimensional (2D) crystals is marked by the synthesis of graphene, which constitutes exemplary monolayer material. This is due to the multiple extraordinary properties of graphene, particularly in the field of quantum electronic phenomena. However, there are electronic features that are notably missing in this material due to the inherent nature of its charge carriers. Of particular importance is that pristine graphene does not exhibit semiconducting or superconducting properties, preventing related applications. Certain modifications to graphene or even synthesis of sibling materials is needed to arrive with semiconducting and superconducting 2D hexagonal materials. Here, the representative examples of such materials are discussed in detail along with their expected properties. Special attention is given to the unique semiconducting and superconducting phenomena found in these materials e.g. the non-adiabatic superconductivity, spin- and valley-dependent conductivity or the bulk-like Schottky-type potential barriers. The discussion is supplemented with some pertinent conclusions and perspectives for future work.

Title: Discovery of an Intermediate Nematic State in a Bilayer Kagome Metal ScV6Sn6
Authors: Camron Farhang, William R. Meier, Weihang Lu, Jiangxu Li, Yudong Wu, Shirin Mozaffari, Richa P. Madhogaria, Yang Zhang, David Mandrus, Jing Xia
Abstract: Nematicity, where rotational symmetry of the crystal lattice is spontaneously broken, is a ubiquitous phenomenon in correlated quantum matter, often intertwining with other orders to produce a richer spectrum of phases. Here we report a new phase transition in high-quality ScV6Sn6 bilayer kagome metal at a temperature T^*, occurring seven Kelvins below the charge density wave (CDW) transition at T_CDW, as indicated by thermodynamic, transport, and optical measurements. This emerging intermediate phase does not exhibit spontaneous time-reversal-symmetry breaking, as evidenced by zero-field Sagnac interferometer experiments. However, it displays a strong, spontaneous (strain- and field-free) anisotropy in the kagome plane between T^* and T_CDW, as revealed by transport and optical polarization rotation measurements. Additionally, a pronounced depolarization effect detected by the Sagnac interferometer further confirms its nematic nature. This intermediate nematic phase, alongside the recently discovered intra-unit cell nematic order at much lower temperatures, presents a diverse landscape of nematicities at multiple length and temperature scales, distinguishing it from those observed in kagome metals AV3Sb5. Our findings highlight ScV6Sn6 and the broader RM6X6 intermetallic family as fertile platforms for realizing symmetry-breaking phases driven by a unique interplay of competing CDW instabilities, kagome physics, and Van Hove singularities.

Title: Non-Hermitian linear perturbation to a Hamiltonian with a constant electromagnetic field and Hall conductivity
Authors: Jorge A. Lizarraga
Abstract: The quantum Hall effect led to the classification of materials as topological insulators, and the generalization of this classification to non-Hermitian band theory is an active area of research. While the impact of non-Hermitian perturbations on Weyl Hamiltonians is expected to provide valuable insights for classifying topological phase transitions, predicting the effect of non-Hermiticity on Hall conductivity remains complex. In fact, previous theoretical work has shown that the quantization of Hall conductivity in the quantum anomalous Hall effect is lost, even though it is classified as a non-Hermitian Chern insulator. In this work, the stationary Schrödinger equation for an electron in a constant electromagnetic field with a non-Hermitian linear perturbation is studied. The wave function and the spectrum of the system are derived analytically, with the spectrum consisting of Landau levels modified by an additional term associated with the linear Stark effect, proportional to a complex constant $\lambda$. It is shown that this constant arises from an operator $\hat{\Pi}$ that commutes with the Hamiltonian, i.e., $\hat{\Pi}$ is a symmetry of the system. Finally, the Hall conductivity for the lowest Landau level is calculated, showing that it remains exactly equal to the inverse of Klitzing's constant despite the perturbation.

Title: Mesoscopic heterogeneity in biomolecular condensates from sequence patterning
Authors: Luke K. Davis, Andrew J. Baldwin, Philip Pearce
Abstract: Biomolecular condensates composed of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are vital for proper cellular function, and their dysfunction is associated with diseases including neurodegeneration and cancer. Despite their biological importance, the precise physical mechanisms underlying condensate (dys)function are unclear, in part owing to the difficulties in understanding how biomolecular sequence patterns influence emergent condensate behaviours across relevant length and timescales. Here, through minimal physical modelling, we explain how IDP sequence patterning gives rise to nano-scale organisational heterogeneities in condensates. By applying our coarse-grained molecular-dynamics polymer model, which accounts for steric, attractive, and electrostatic interactions, we systematically quantify and map out the emergent morphological phases resulting from a wide range of sequence patterns. We demonstrate how sequences that enable local coil-to-globule transitions within regions of single polymers - driven by a competition between the preferred crowding densities of different regions in the sequence - also exhibit cluster formation in condensates. Overall, our work provides a conceptual framework to understand how sequence properties determine mesoscopic organisation within biomolecular condensates.

Title: Superlative spin transport of holes in ultra-thin black phosphorus
Authors: Jiawei Liu, Deyi Fu, Tingyu Qu, Deqiang Zhang, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Ahmet Avsar, Barbaros Ozyilmaz
Abstract: The development of energy-efficient spin-based hybrid devices that can perform functions such as logic, communication, and storage requires the ability to control and transport highly polarized spin currents over long distances in semiconductors. While traditional semiconductors such as silicon support spin transport, the effects of carrier type and concentration on important spin parameters are not well understood due to the need for extrinsic doping, which can cause additional momentum and hence spin scattering. Two-dimensional semiconductors, on the other hand, offer the ability to tune carrier type and concentration through field effect gating and inherently have long intrinsic spin lifetimes, making them a desirable platform for spin transport. Here, we study gate-tunable spin transport across narrow band-gap black phosphorus-based spin valves which enable us to systematically investigate spin transport with varying hole and electron concentrations under non-local geometry. Our findings demonstrate exceptional pure spin transport that approaches intrinsic limit, particularly in the low hole doping range. We achieved record non-local signals reaching 350 {\Omega} and spin lifetimes exceeding 16 ns. Contrary to the behaviour seen in typical semiconductors, we find that the spin transport performance of holes in black phosphorus is significantly better than that of electrons, with the Elliott-Yafet process being the primary spin scattering mechanism. The observation of gate-tunable nanosecond spin lifetimes and colossal pure spin signals in both p- and n-type black phosphorus offers promising prospects for the development of novel semiconducting spintronics devices requiring sharp p-n interfaces.

Title: Strong-coupling high-$T_{\rm c}$ superconductivity in doped correlated band insulator
Authors: Yusuke Nomura, Motoharu Kitatani, Shiro Sakai, Ryotaro Arita
Abstract: We explore the superconducting properties of the bilayer Hubbard model, which exhibits a high transition temperature ($T_{\rm c}$) for an $s_{\pm}$ pairing, using a cluster extension of the dynamical mean-field theory. Unlike the single-layer Hubbard model, where the $d$-wave superconductivity emerges by doping the Mott insulator, the parent state of the bilayer system is a correlated band insulator. Above $T_{\rm c}$, slight hole (electron) doping introduces a striking dichotomy between electron and hole pockets: the electron (hole) pocket develops a pseudogap while the other becomes a nearly incipient band. We reveal that the superconductivity is driven by kinetic (potential) energy gain in the underdoped (overdoped) region. We also find a very short coherence length, for which we argue the relevance to multi-orbital physics. Our study offers crucial insights into the superconductivity in the bilayer Hubbard model potentially relevant to La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.

Title: Topological phase transition through tunable nearest-neighbor interactions in a one-dimensional lattice
Authors: Rajashri Parida, Diptiman Sen, Tapan Mishra
Abstract: We investigate the phase diagram of a one-dimensional model of hardcore bosons or spinless fermions with tunable nearest-neighbor interactions. By introducing alternating repulsive and attractive interactions on consecutive bonds, we show that the system undergoes a transition from a bond-ordered (BO) phase to a charge-density wave-II (CDW-II) phase as the attractive interaction strength increases at a fixed repulsive interaction. For a specific interaction pattern, the BO phase exhibits topological properties, which vanish when the pattern is altered, leading to a transition from a topological BO phase to a trivial BO phase through a gap-closing point where both interactions vanish. We identify these phases using a combination of order parameters, topological invariants, edge-state analysis and Thouless charge pumping. By extending our analysis beyond half-filling, we explore the phase diagram across all densities and identify the superfluid (SF) and the pair-superfluid (PSF) phases, characterized by single-particle and bound-pair excitations at incommensurate densities. The proposed model is experimentally realizable in platforms such as Rydberg excited or ultracold atoms in optical lattices, offering a versatile framework to study such interplay between topology and interactions in low-dimensional systems.

Title: Emergent Goldstone flat bands and spontaneous symmetry breaking with type-B Goldstone modes
Authors: Huan-Qiang Zhou, Jesse J. Osborne, Qian-Qian Shi, Ian P. McCulloch
Abstract: For a quantum many-body spin system undergoing spontaneous symmetry breaking with type-B Goldstone modes, a high degree of degeneracy arises in the ground state manifold. Generically, if this degeneracy is polynomial in system size, then it does not depend on the type of boundary conditions used. However, if there exists an emergent (local) symmetry operation tailored to a specific degenerate ground state, then we show that the degeneracies are exponential in system size and are different under periodic boundary conditions (PBCs) and open boundary conditions (OBCs). We further show that the exponential ground state degeneracies in turn imply the emergence of Goldstone flat bands -- single-mode excitations generated by a multi-site operator and its images under the repeated action of the translation operation under PBCs or the cyclic permutation symmetry operation under OBCs. Conversely, we also show that the presence of emergent Goldstone flat bands implies that there exists an emergent (local) symmetry operation tailored to a specific degenerate ground state. In addition, we propose an extrinsic characterization of emergent Goldstone flat bands, revealing a connection to quantum many-body scars, which violate the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. We illustrate this by presenting examples from the staggered ${\rm SU}(4)$ spin-1 ferromagnetic biquadratic model and the staggered ${\rm SU}(4)$ ferromagnetic spin-orbital model. We also perform extensive numerical simulations for the more general ${\rm SO}(3)$ spin-1 bilinear-biquadratic and ${\rm SO(4)}$ ferromagnetic spin-orbital models, containing the two aforementioned models as the endpoints in the ferromagnetic regimes respectively, and confirm the emergence of Goldstone flat bands, as we approach these endpoints from deep inside the ferromagnetic regimes.

Title: Optimizing Lead-Free Chalcogenide Perovskites for High-Efficiency Photovoltaics via Alloying Strategies
Authors: Surajit Adhikari, Priya Johari
Abstract: Lead-free chalcogenide perovskites are emerging as game-changers in the race for sustainable, high-performance photovoltaics. These materials offer a perfect trifecta: non-toxic elemental composition, exceptional phase stability, and outstanding optoelectronic properties. However, unlocking their full potential for solar cell applications requires advanced strategies to fine-tune their electronic and optical behavior. In this study, we take CaHfS$_{3}$-a promising but underexplored candidate-and revolutionize its performance by introducing targeted substitutions: Ti at the cation site and Se at the anion site. Using cutting-edge computational techniques, including density functional theory, GW calculations, and the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE), we reveal how these substitutions transform the material's properties. Our findings highlight that alloyed compounds such as CaHfS$_{3-x}$Se$_{x}$ and CaHf$_{1-y}$Ti$_{y}$X$_{3}$ (X = S, Se) are not only phase-stable but also feature adjustable direct G$_{0}$W$_{0}$@PBE bandgaps (1.29-2.67 eV), reduced exciton binding energies, and significantly improved polaron mobility. These modifications enable better light absorption, reduced electron-hole recombination, longer exciton lifetimes, and enhanced quantum yield. Impressively, the alloyed perovskites, specifically, for the Ti-rich Se-based perovskites, achieve a spectroscopic-limited maximum efficiency of up to 28.06%, outperforming traditional lead-based halide perovskites. Our results demonstrate that strategic alloying is a powerful tool to supercharge the optoelectronic properties of lead-free chalcogenide perovskites, positioning them as strong contenders for next-generation photovoltaic technologies.

Title: Superconductivity Favored Anisotropic Phase Stiffness in Infinite-Layer Nickelates
Authors: Minyi Xu, Dong Qiu, Minghui Xu, Yehao Guo, Cheng Shen, Chao Yang, Wenjie Sun, Yuefeng Nie, Zi-Xiang Li, Tao Xiang, Liang Qiao, Jie Xiong, Yanrong Li
Abstract: In unconventional superconductors such as cuprates and iron pnictides and chalcogenides, phase stiffness - a measure of the energy cost associated with superconducting phase variations - is on the same order of magnitude as the strength of Cooper pairing, translating to superconductivity governed by phase fluctuations. However, due to a lack of a direct experimental probe, there remains a fundamental gap in establishing microscopic picture between unconventional superconductivity and phase fluctuations. Here we show a vector current technique that allows for in-situ angle-resolved transport measurements, providing exclusive evidence suggesting an anisotropic nature of phase stiffness in infinite-layer nickelate superconductors. Pronounced anisotropy of in-plane resistance manifests itself in both normal and superconducting transition states, indicating crystal symmetry breaking. Remarkably, the electric conductivity of Nd0.8Sr0.2NiO2 peaks at 125° between the direction of the current and crystal principal axis, but this angle evolves to 160° near zero-resistance temperature. Further measurements reveal that the superconductivity is favored along a direction with minimized phase fluctuations, an orientation strikingly deviating from the symmetric direction imposed by both electronic anisotropy and the underlying crystal lattice. Identical measurements conducted on a prototypical cuprate superconductor yield consistent results, suggesting that this previously unknown behavior could be ubiquitous. By shielding insight into the contrasting anisotropy between electron fluid and superfluid, our findings provide clues for a unified framework for understanding unconventional superconductors

Title: Quantum fluctuations-driven Melting Transitions in Two-dimensional Superconductors

Abstract: Quantum fluctuations are pivotal in driving quantum phase transitions, exemplified by the quantum melting of Wigner crystals into Fermi liquids in electron systems. However, their impact on superconducting systems near zero temperature, particularly in the superconductor-insulator/metal transition, remains poorly understood. In this study, through electric transport measurements on the two-dimensional (2D) superconductor (SnS)1.17NbS2, we demonstrate that quantum fluctuations induce vortex displacement from their mean position, leading to the quantum melting of vortex solid near zero temperature. Quantitative analysis reveals the magnetic field-induced anomalous metal originates from this quantum melting transition, with energy dissipation governed by quantum fluctuations-driven vortex displacements. Remarkably, further extending this analysis to various 2D superconductors yields the same results, and many properties of anomalous metal can be qualitatively understood within the framework of quantum melting. The connection between the quantum melting of vortex solids and dissipative anomalous metal opens a novel pathway towards understanding quantum phase transitions through vortex dynamics, providing new insights on both fields.

Title: Nonadiabatic quantum geometry and optical conductivity
Authors: Raffaele Resta
Abstract: The ground-state quantum geometry is at the root of several static and adiabatic properties, while genuinely dynamic properties are routinely addressed via Kubo formulae, whose essential entries are the excited states. It is shown here that the ground-state metric-curvature tensor evolves in time by means of a causal unitary operator, which by construction elucidates the geometrical effect of the excited states in compact form. In the condensed-matter case the generalized tensor encompasses the whole conductivity tensor at arbitrary frequencies in both insulators and metals, with the exception of the Drude term in the metallic case; the latter is shown to be eminently nongeometrical.

Title: Unlocking the Optoelectronic Potential of AGeX$_{3}$ (A = Ca, Sr, Ba; X = S, Se): A Sustainable Alternative in Chalcogenide Perovskites
Authors: Ayan Chakravorty, Surajit Adhikari, Priya Johari
Abstract: The quest for environmentally benign and stable optoelectronic materials has intensified, and chalcogenide perovskites (CPs) have emerged as promising candidates owing to their non-toxic composition, stability, small bandgaps, large absorption coefficients. However, a detailed theoretical study of excitonic and polaronic properties of these materials remains underexplored due to high computational demands. Herein, we present a comprehensive theoretical investigation of Germanium-based CPs, AGeX$_{3}$ (A = Ca, Sr, Ba; X = S, Se), which adopt distorted perovskite structures (\beta-phase) with an orthorhombic crystal structure (space group : Pnma) by utilizing state-of-the-art density functional theory (DFT), density functional perturbation theory (DFPT), and many-body perturbation theory (GW and Bethe-Salpeter equation). Our calculations reveal that these materials are thermodynamically and mechanically stable, with the bandgaps calculated using G$_{0}$W$_{0}$@PBE ranging from 0.646 to 2.001 eV - suitable for optoelectronic devices. We analyze the ionic and electronic contributions to dielectric screening using DFPT and BSE methods, finding that the electronic component dominates. The exciton binding energies range from 0.03 to 73.63 meV, indicating efficient exciton dissociation under ambient conditions. Additionally, these perovskites exhibit low to high polaronic mobilities (1.67-167.65 cm$^{2}$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$), exceeding many lead-free CPs and halide perovskites due to reduced carrier-phonon interactions. The unique combination of wide tunable bandgaps, low exciton binding energies, and enhanced charge-carrier mobility highlights AGeX$_{3}$ as a potential material for next-generation optoelectronic applications. These compounds are stable, high-performing, and eco-friendly, showing great promise for experimental realization and device integration.

Abstract: Ultrafast optical excitation of quantum materials has opened new frontiers for transiently inducing novel phases of matter, including magnetism, charge density waves, ferroelectricity, and superconductivity beyond the constraints of equilibrium thermodynamics. Triggering a transient topological order in a trivial semiconductor represents a key milestone, as it could provide an on-demand route to topological functionality for device applications. However, achieving a topologically nontrivial phase from a large-gap (~ 1 eV) semiconductor remains a major challenge, as substantial energy modification is required to invert the band gap. Here, we report the discovery of a thermally inaccessible, transient topological crystalline order in a sizable-gap (~ 0.8 eV) layered semiconductor, SnSe, through femtosecond above-gap excitation. Time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy reveals a Dirac-like linear dispersion forming within the band gap on a subpicosecond timescale. This transient state shows hallmark features of a reflection-invariant topological crystalline insulator, including a high Fermi velocity (2.5x10^5 m/s), multiple Dirac points located away from high-symmetry momenta, and independence from probe photon energy, persisting for several picoseconds even at room temperature. Our findings establish a nonequilibrium pathway to ultrafast topological order in a semiconductor, opening new avenues for optically driven spintronic and quantum information technologies.

Title: Identification of soft modes in amorphous Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$ via first-principles
Authors: Alexander C. Tyner, Joshuah T. Heath, Thue Christian Thann, Vincent P. Michal, Peter Krogstrup, Mark Kamper Svendsen, Alexander V. Balatsky
Abstract: Amorphous Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$ is a fundamental component of modern superconducting qubits. While amphorphous oxides offer distinct advantages, such as directional isotropy and a consistent bulk electronic gap, in realistic systems these compounds support two-level systems (TLSs) which couple to the qubit, expediting decoherence. In this work, we perform a first-principles study of amorphous Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$ and identify low-energy modes in the electronic and phonon spectra as a possible origin for TLSs.

Title: Slave-spin approach to the Anderson-Josephson quantum dot
Authors: Andriani Keliri, Marco Schirò
Abstract: We study a strongly interacting quantum dot connected to two superconducting leads using a slave-spin representation of the dot. At the mean-field level the problem maps into a resonant level model with superconducting leads, coupled to an auxiliary spin-1/2 variable accounting for the parity of the dot. We obtain the mean-field phase diagram, showing a transition between a Kondo (singlet) and a local moment (doublet) regime, corresponding to the $0-\pi$ transition of the junction. The mean-field theory qualitatively captures the Kondo singlet phase and its competition with superconductivity for weak values of the BCS gap, including the non-trivial dependence of the Andreev bound states on the interaction, but fails in the doublet regime where it predicts a dot decoupled from the bath. Using diagrammatic techniques and a random phase approximation, we include fluctuations on top of the mean-field theory to describe finite-frequency dynamics of the effective spin variable. This leads to the formation of high-energy Hubbard bands in the spectral function and a coherent Kondo peak with a BCS gap at low energies. Finally, we compute the Josephson current and the induced superconducting correlations on the dot.

Title: Spatial and Temporal Periodic Density Patterns in Driven Bose-Einstein Condensates
Authors: A. del Río-Lima, J. A. Seman, R. Jáuregui, F. J. Poveda-Cuevas
Abstract: The study of collective excitations is a crucial tool for understanding many-body quantum systems. For instance, they play a central role in the exploration of superfluidity and other quantum macroscopic phenomena in Bose and Fermi systems. In this work we present a variational and a numerical study of a parametrically driven Bose-Einstein condensate confined in a cylindrical harmonic trap in which the aspect ratio can be varied from a prolate (cigar-shaped) to an oblate (pancake-shaped) system. The excitation can be applied by periodically modulating the harmonic frequencies of the trap or, alternatively, the interatomic interaction strength at a frequency that matches that of the system breathing mode. As a result, we observe the formation of dynamical density patterns that depend on the geometry of the trap: a fringe pattern in a prolate system and a ring pattern in an oblate one. By decomposing the total energy into its kinetic, potential, and interaction terms, we show that the onset of these patterns coincides with the redistribution of kinetic energy along the weakly trapped directions of the sample, indicating the three-dimensional nature of the studied phenomena. Finally, our analysis shows that the difference between the two excitation mechanisms lies on the system stability. Modulating the trap destabilizes the system quicker than modulating the interactions, leading to earlier formation of the patterns.

Title: Stacking-dependent topological electronic structures in honeycomb-kagome heterolayers
Authors: Chan Bin Bark, Hanbyul Kim, Seik Pak, Hong-Guk Min, Sungkyun Ahn, Youngkuk Kim, Moon Jip Park
Abstract: Heterostructures of stacked two-dimensional lattices have shown great promise for engineering novel material properties. As an archetypal example of such a system, the hexagon-shared honeycomb-kagome lattice has been experimentally synthesized in various material platforms. In this work, we explore three rotationally symmetric variants of the honeycomb-kagome lattice: the hexagonal, triagonal, and biaxial phases. While the triagonal and biaxial phases exhibit trivial insulating and Dirac semimetal band structures, respectively, the hexagonal phase hosts a higher-order topological phase driven by band inversion near the $\Gamma$-point. This highlights a key distinction from the conventional band inversions at the $K$-point observed in hexagonal homobilayer systems. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the distinct topological properties of these phases result in network band structures within moiré heterostructures formed by twisted or lattice-mismatched HK systems. These network band structures can be experimentally observed through extrinsic twisting or intrinsic lattice mismatching between the honeycomb and kagome systems.

Title: Emergence of Fermi's Golden Rule in the Probing of a Quantum Many-Body System
Authors: Jianyi Chen, Songtao Huang, Yunpeng Ji, Grant L. Schumacher, Alan Tsidilkovski, Alexander Schuckert, Gabriel G. T. Assumpção, Nir Navon
Abstract: Fermi's Golden Rule (FGR) is one of the most impactful formulas in quantum mechanics, providing a link between easy-to-measure observables - such as transition rates - and fundamental microscopic properties - such as density of states or spectral functions. Its validity relies on three key assumptions: the existence of a continuum, an appropriate time window, and a weak coupling. Understanding the regime of validity of FGR is critical for the proper interpretation of most spectroscopic experiments. While the assumptions underlying FGR are straightforward to analyze in simple models, their applicability is significantly more complex in quantum many-body systems. Here, we observe the emergence and breakdown of FGR, using a strongly interacting homogeneous spin-$1/2$ Fermi gas coupled to a radio-frequency (rf) field. Measuring the transition probability into an outcoupled internal state, we map the system's dynamical response diagram versus the rf-pulse duration $t$ and Rabi frequency $\Omega_0$. For weak drives, we identify three regimes: an early-time regime where the transition probability takes off as $t^2$, an intermediate-time FGR regime, and a long-time non-perturbative regime. Beyond a threshold Rabi frequency, Rabi oscillations appear. Our results provide a blueprint for the applicability of linear response theory to the spectroscopy of quantum many-body systems.

Title: Decoherence-induced self-dual criticality in topological states of matter
Authors: Qingyuan Wang, Romain Vasseur, Simon Trebst, Andreas W.W. Ludwig, Guo-Yi Zhu
Abstract: Quantum measurements can be employed to induce decoherence in a restricted segment of a quantum many-body state, while simultaneously engineering long-range entanglement for its remaining constituents. Though this two-fold character of measurements in open quantum systems has been appreciated for entangled state preparation, a deeper conceptual understanding is called for regarding symmetry as an organizing principle. Here we discuss the role of self-dual symmetry -- a fundamental notion in theoretical physics -- in mixed states, showing that the decoherence of electric and magnetic vortices from the 2D bulk of the toric code, or a 2D cluster state with symmetry-protected topological order, can leave a (1+1)D quantum critical mixed state on the boundary protected by a weak Kramers-Wannier self-dual symmetry. The corresponding self-dual critical bulk is described by the $N\to1$ limit of the 2D Non-linear Sigma Model in symmetry class $D$ at $\Theta$-angle $\pi$, with target space $SO(2N)/U(N)$, established as a Born-measurement version of the Cho-Fisher model. An explicit breaking of the self-duality, by incoherent noise amounting to fermion interactions or non-interacting coherent deformation, is shown to induce an RG crossover from this self-dual critical state to Nishimori criticality or to it from a novel type of Ising+ criticality, respectively, both of which are related to the random-bond Ising model in different replica limits and are described by non-unitary conformal field theories of non-interacting fermions, as is the self-dual point. Using numerical approaches combining tensor network, Monte Carlo, and Gaussian fermion simulations, we chart out a global phase diagram by coherent information and entanglement entropy measures. Our results point a way towards a general understanding of mixed-state criticality in open quantum systems in terms of symmetry and topology.

Title: Characterization of ion track etched conical nanopores in thermal and PECVD SiO$_{2}$ using small angle X-ray scattering
Authors: Shankar Dutt, Rudradeep Chakraborty, Christian Notthoff, Pablo Mota-Santiago, Christina Trautmann, Patrick Kluth
Abstract: Conical nanopores in amorphous SiO$_{2}$ thin films fabricated using the ion track etching technique show promising potential for filtration, sensing and nanofluidic applications. The characterization of the pore morphology and size distribution, along with its dependence on the material properties and fabrication parameters, is crucial to designing nanopore systems for specific applications. Here, we present a comprehensive study of track-etched nanopores in thermal and plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposited (PECVD) SiO$_{2}$ using synchrotron-based small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). We present a new approach for analyzing the complex highly anisotropic 2-dimensional SAXS patterns of the pores by reducing the analysis to two orthogonal 1-dimensional slices of the data. The simultaneous fit of the data enables an accurate determination of the pore geometry and size distribution. The analysis reveals substantial differences between the nanopores in thermal and PECVD SiO$_{2}$. The track-to-bulk etching rate ratio is significantly different for the two materials, producing nanopores with cone angles that differ by almost a factor of 2. Furthermore, thermal SiO$_2$ exhibits an exceptionally narrow size distribution of only ~2-4%, while PECVD SiO$_2$ shows a higher variation ranging from ~8-18%. The impact of ion energy between 89 MeV and 1.6 GeV on the size of the nanopores was also investigated for pores in PECVD SiO$_{2}$ and shows only negligible influence. These findings provide crucial insights for the controlled fabrication of conical nanopores in different materials, which is essential for optimizing membrane performance in applications that require precise pore geometry.

Title: Monomer-dimer tensor-network basis for qubit-regularized lattice gauge theories
Authors: Shailesh Chandrasekharan, Rui Xian Siew, Tanmoy Bhattacharya
Abstract: Traditional $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ lattice gauge theories (LGTs) can be formulated using an orthonormal basis constructed from the irreducible representations (irreps) $V_{\lambda}$ of the $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ gauge symmetry. On a lattice, the elements of this basis are tensor networks comprising dimer tensors on the links labeled by a set of irreps $\{\lambda_\ell\}$ and monomer tensors on sites labeled by $\{\lambda_s\}$. These tensors naturally define a local site Hilbert space, $\mathcal{H}^g_s$, on which gauge transformations act. Gauss's law introduces an additional index $\alpha_s = 1, 2, \dots, \mathcal{D}(\mathcal{H}_s^g)$ that labels an orthonormal basis of the gauge-invariant subspace of $\mathcal{H}^g_s$. This monomer-dimer tensor-network (MDTN) basis, $\left| \{\lambda_s\},\{\lambda_\ell\},\{\alpha_s\}\right\rangle$, of the physical Hilbert space enables the construction of new qubit-regularized $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ gauge theories that are free of sign problems while preserving key features of traditional LGTs. Here, we investigate finite-temperature confinement-deconfinement transitions in a simple qubit-regularized $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ and $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ gauge theory in $d=2$ and $d=3$ spatial dimensions, formulated using the MDTN basis, and show that they reproduce the universal results of traditional LGTs at these transitions. Additionally, in $d=1$, we demonstrate using a plaquette chain that the string tension at zero temperature can be continuously tuned to zero by adjusting a model parameter that plays the role of the gauge coupling in traditional LGTs.

Title: Quantum stick-slip motion in nanoscaled friction
Authors: Dai-Nam Le, Pablo Rodriguez-Lopez, Lilia M. Woods
Abstract: Friction in atomistic systems is usually described by the classical Prandtl-Tomlinson model suitable for capturing the dragging force of a nanoparticle in a periodic potential. Here we consider the quantum mechanical version of this model in which the dissipation is facilitated by releasing heat to an external bath reservoir. The time evolution of the system is captured with the Liouville-von Neumann equation through the density matrix of the system in the Markov approximation. We examine several kinetic and dissipative properties of the nanoparticle by delineating classical vs quantum mechanical effects. We find that that the Landau-Zener tunneling is a key factor in the overall reduction of the frictional dissipation when compared to the classical motion in which such tunneling is absent. This in-depth study analyzes the interplay between velocity, strength of interaction, and temperature to control the frictional process and provide useful guidelines for experimental data interpretation.

Title: Exact non-Markovian master equations: a generalized derivation for quadratic systems
Authors: Antonio D'Abbruzzo, Vittorio Giovannetti, Vasco Cavina
Abstract: We derive an exact master equation that captures the dynamics of a quadratic quantum system linearly coupled to a Gaussian environment. Unlike previous approaches, our formulation applies universally to both bosonic and fermionic reservoirs, and remains valid even in the presence of initial system-environment correlations. Remarkably, the master equation is written without employing field objects, path integrals, or involved superoperators. As a result, it shows an explicit and extremely compact dependence on the dressed environment correlation function: this allows us to state exactly how sequential virtual interactions between the system and the environment eventually lead to non-Markovian evolution. In the weak-coupling limit, this dependence facilitates a straightforward recovery of the well-known Redfield equation at second order in the coupling.

Title: Passive leakage removal unit based on a disordered transmon array
Authors: Gonzalo Martín-Vázquez, Taneli Tolppanen, Matti Silveri
Abstract: Leakage out from the qubit subspace compromises standard quantum error correction protocols and is a challenge for practical quantum computing. We propose a passive leakage removal unit based on an array of coupled disordered transmons and last-site reset by feedback-measurement or dissipation. The transmons have parametric disorder both in frequency and anharmonicity such that the qubit subspace is protected by localization through energy level mismatch while the energy levels for leakage excitations are in resonance for maximized leakage mobility. Leakage excitations propagate through the idle transmons until reaching the last site with feedback-measurement or dissipation removing them. For removing leakage excitations, we find two optimal measurement rates, which are comprehensively understood through two distinct timescales between the propagation and disintegration of leakage excitations. Based only on an array of standard transmon devices, our approach is readily compatible with existing superconducting quantum processor designs under realistic conditions.

Title: Observation of the quantum equivalence principle for matter-waves
Authors: Or Dobkowski, Barak Trok, Peter Skakunenko, Yonathan Japha, David Groswasser, Maxim Efremov, Chiara Marletto, Ivette Fuentes, Roger Penrose, Vlatko Vedral, Wolfgang P. Schleich, Ron Folman
Abstract: Einstein's general theory of relativity is based on the principle of equivalence - in essence, dating back to Galileo - which asserts that, locally, the effect of a gravitational field is equivalent to that of an accelerating reference frame, so that the local gravitational field is eliminated in a freely falling frame. Einstein's theory enables this principle to extend to a global description of relativistic space-time, at the expense of allowing space-time to become curved, realising a consistent frame-independent description of nature at the classical level. Einstein's theory has been confirmed to great accuracy for astrophysical bodies. However, in the quantum domain the equivalence principle involves a gauge phase that is observable if the wavefunction - fundamental to quantum descriptions - allows an object to interfere with itself after being simultaneously at rest in two differently accelerating frames, one being the laboratory (Newtonian) frame and the other in the freely-falling (Einsteinian) frame. This is done with a novel cold-atom interferometer in which one wave packet stays static in the laboratory frame while the other is in free-fall. We follow the relative-phase evolution of the wave packets in the two frames, confirming the equivalence principle in the quantum domain. Our observation is yet another fundamental test of the interface between quantum theory and gravity. The new interferometer also opens the door for further probing of the latter interface, as well as to searches for new physics.

Title: Exploring the phase diagram of $SU(2)_4$ strange correlator
Authors: Ce Shen
Abstract: We investigate the phase diagram of a quantum many-body system constructed via the strange correlator approach, based on the non-Abelian $SU(2)_4$ fusion category, to probe topological phase transitions. Using tensor network methods, we numerically compute the half-infinite chain entanglement entropy derived from the dominant eigenvector of the transfer matrix and map the entropy across a spherical two-dimensional parameter space. Our results reveal a phase diagram significantly more complex than previously reported, including a gapless phase consistent with a conformal field theory (CFT) of central charge $c=1$. Critical lines separating distinct phases are identified, with one such line bounding the CFT phase exhibiting a higher central charge $c=2$, indicative of an unconventional critical regime.

Title: Generalized lattices, conformal manifolds, and symmetries
Authors: Shlomo S. Razamat, Michal Shemesh, Aelly Zeltzer
Abstract: We consider supersymmetric conformal quantum field theories (SCFTs) with degrees of freedom labeled by lattice data. We will assume that in terms of the corresponding lattice the interactions are nearest neighbor and exactly marginal. For example, one can construct such theories by coupling many copies of a single SCFT with exactly marginal deformations. In particular, we discuss the interplay between conformal manifolds of such theories and their global, on-site and lattice, symmetries. We show that one can interpret certain current non-conservation equations for symmetries broken by the interactions as conservation equations including the lattice directions. Moreover, we discuss a class of exactly marginal deformations which are labeled by lattice holonomies that are topological on the lattice. We discuss concrete examples of such constructions and comment on their relevance to compactifications of SCFTs.

Title: Expanded ensemble method for bubble nucleation
Authors: Jaakko Hällfors, Kari Rummukainen
Abstract: In the absence of impurities and boundary effects, first order phase transitions are initiated by the nucleation of critical bubbles. In thermally driven transitions many systems can remain metastable for an extended time, possibly tens of orders of magnitude longer than typical microscopic timescales. In standard Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations of these systems the probability of critical bubbles can be too suppressed for the transition to happen in any practical simulation time. The computation can be accelerated by using modified sampling methods, for example multicanonical or Wang-Landau sampling. However, even using these methods, there remains a condensation barrier which dramatically reduces the efficiency at large volumes. We present a novel sampling method, the method of expanded ensembles, which very effectively circumvents the condensation barrier and enables efficient simulations at large volumes.

Title: Machine learning assisted tracking of magnetic objects using quantum diamond magnetometry
Authors: Fernando Meneses, Christopher T.-K. Lew, Anand Sivamalai, Andy Sayers, Brant C. Gibson, Andrew D. Greentree, Lloyd C. L. Hollenberg, David A. Simpson
Abstract: Remote magnetic sensing can be used to monitor the position of objects in real-time, enabling ground transport monitoring, underground infrastructure mapping and hazardous detection. However, magnetic signals are typically weak and complex, requiring sophisticated physical models to analyze them and a detailed knowledge of the system under study, factors that are frequently unavailable. In this work, we provide a solution to these limitations by demonstrating a Machine Learning (ML) method that can be trained exclusively on experimental data, without the need of any physical model, to predict the position of a magnetic target in real-time. The target can be any object with a magnetic signal above the floor noise, and in this case we use a quantum diamond magnetometer to track variations of few hundreds of nanoteslas produced by an elevator moving along a single axis. The one-dimensional movement is a simple yet challenging scenario, resembling realistic environments such as high buildings, tunnels or train circuits, and is the first step towards building broader applications. Our ML algorithm can be trained in approximately 40 min, achieving over 80% accuracy in predicting the target's position at a rate of 10 Hz, for a positional error tolerance of 30 cm, which is a precise distance compared to the 4-meter spacing between parking levels. Our results open up the possibility to apply this ML method more generally for real-time monitoring of magnetic objects, which will broaden the scope of magnetic detection applications.

Title: Analysis of a voter model with an evolving number of opinion states
Authors: Jeehye Choi, Byungjoon Min, Tobias Galla
Abstract: In traditional voter models, opinion dynamics are driven by interactions between individuals, where an individual adopts the opinion of a randomly chosen neighbor. However, these models often fail to capture the emergence of entirely new opinions, which can arise spontaneously in real-world scenarios. Our study introduces a novel element to the classic voter model: the concept of innovation, where individuals have a certain probability of generating new opinions independently of their neighbors' states. This innovation process allows for a more realistic representation of social dynamics, where new opinions can emerge and old ones may fade over time. Through analytical and numerical analysis, we find that the balance between innovation and extinction shapes the number of opinions in the steady state. Specifically, for low innovation rates, the system tends toward near-consensus, while higher innovation rates lead to greater opinion diversity. We also show that network structure influences opinion dynamics, with greater degree heterogeneity reducing the number of opinions in the system.

Title: Branching with selection and mutation II: Mutant fitness of Gumbel type
Authors: Su-Chan Park, Joachim Krug, Peter Mörters
Abstract: We study a model of a branching process subject to selection, modeled by giving each family an individual fitness acting as a branching rate, and mutation, modeled by resampling the fitness of a proportion of offspring in each generation. For two large classes of fitness distributions of Gumbel type we determine the growth of the population, almost surely on survival. We then study the empirical fitness distribution in a simplified model, which is numerically indistinguishable from the original model, and show the emergence of a Gaussian travelling wave.

Title: Passive Demultiplexed Two-photon State Generation from a Quantum Dot

Abstract: High-purity multi-photon states are essential for photonic quantum computing. Among existing platforms, semiconductor quantum dots offer a promising route to scalable and deterministic multi-photon state generation. However, to fully realize their potential we require a suitable optical excitation method. Current approaches of multi-photon generation rely on active polarization-switching elements (e.g., electro-optic modulators, EOMs) to spatio-temporally demultiplex single photons. Yet, the achievable multi-photon rate is fundamentally limited by the switching speed of the EOM. Here, we introduce a fully passive demultiplexing technique that leverages a stimulated two-photon excitation process to achieve switching rates that are only limited by the quantum dot lifetime. We demonstrate this method by generating two-photon states from a single quantum dot without requiring any active switching elements. Our approach significantly reduces the cost of demultiplexing while shifting it to the excitation stage, enabling loss-free demultiplexing and effectively doubling the achievable multi-photon generation rate when combined with existing active demultiplexing techniques.

Title: Diffusive evaporation dynamics in polymer solutions is ubiquitous
Authors: Max Huisman, Wilson C.K. Poon, Patrick B. Warren, Simon Titmuss, Davide Marenduzzo
Abstract: Recent theory and experiments have shown how the buildup of a high-concentration polymer layer at a one-dimensional solvent-air interface can lead to an evaporation rate that scales with time as $t^{-1/2}$ and that is insensitive to the ambient humidity. Using phase field modelling we show that this scaling law constitutes a naturally emerging robust regime, Diffusion-Limited Evaporation (DLE). This regime dominates the dynamical state diagram of the system, which also contains regions of constant and arrested evaporation, confirming and extending understanding of recent experimental observations and theoretical predictions. We provide a theoretical argument to show that the scaling observed in the DLE regime occurs for a wide range of parameters, and our simulations predict that it can occur in two-dimensional geometries as well. Finally, we discuss possible extensions to more complex systems.

Title: tda-segmentor: A tool to extract and analyze local structure and porosity features in porous materials
Authors: Aditya Vasudevan, Jorge Zorrilla Prieto, Sergei Zorkaltsev, Maciej Haranczyk
Abstract: Local geometrical features of a porous material such as the shape and size of a pore or the curvature of a solid ligament often affect the macroscopic properties of the material, and their characterization is necessary to fully understand the structure-property this http URL this contribution, we present an approach to automatically segment large porous structures into such local features. Our work takes inspiration from techniques available in Topological Data Analysis(TDA).In particular, using Morse theory, we generate Morse-Smale Complexes(MSC) of our structures that segment the structure, and/or its porosity into individual features that can then be compared. We develop a tool that is built on the topology toolkit (TTK) library, an open source platform for the topological analysis of scalar data, with which we can perform segmentation of these structures. Our tool takes a volumetric grid representation as an input, which can be generated from atomistic or mesh structure models and any function defined on such grid, e.g. the distance to the surface or the interaction energy with a probe. We demonstrate the applicability of the tool by two examples related with analysis of porosity in zeolite materials as well as analysis of ligaments in a porous metal structure. Specifically, by segmenting the pores in the structure we demonstrate some applications to zeolites such as assessing pore-similarity between structures or evaluating the accessible volume to a target molecule such as methane that can be adsorbed to its surface. Moreover, once the MSC's are generated, we can construct graph representations of the void space, replacing the entire pore structure by a simply connected graph. Similarly, the same tool is used to segment and generate graphs representing the solid structure and we show how they can be used to correlate structure and mechanical properties of the material.

Title: Low-spin ground state of the giant single-molecule magnets {Mn$_{70}$} and {Mn$_{84}$}
Authors: R. Rausch, C. Karrasch
Abstract: The single-molecule magnets {Mn$_{70}$} and {Mn$_{84}$} are characterized by a 14-site unit cell with $S=2$ spin sites arranged in a circular geometry. Experimentally, these systems exhibit a magnetic ground state with a notably low total spin $S_{\text{tot}}=5-7$. Up to now, this low-spin ground state has been up difficult to describe theoretically due to the complexity of the quantum Heisenberg model for such a large system. In this work, we fill this gap and demonstrate that the ground state of {Mn$_{70}$} and {Mn$_{84}$} is in fact governed by a small, finite $S_{\text{tot}}$ in quantitative agreement with the experiment. We employ accurate, large-scale SU(2)-symmetric density-matrix renormalization group calculations for a quantum Heisenberg model with previously published exchange parameters obtained by density-functional theory. We do not find a low-spin state for the same parameters and $S=1$ and thus propose that frustrated systems with $S\geq2$ are inherently prone to weak ferromagnetic interactions. This could account for the prevalence of similar low-spin Mn-based single-molecule magnets. Finally, we compute the full magnetization curve and find wide plateaus at 10/14, 11/14, 12/14 and 13/14 of the saturation, which can be traced back to nearly-independent 3-site clusters with broken inter-cluster bonds.

Title: Extracting the Luttinger parameter from a single wave function
Authors: Bi-Yang Tan, Yueshui Zhang, Hua-Chen Zhang, Wei Tang, Lei Wang, Hong-Hao Tu, Ying-Hai Wu
Abstract: The low-energy physics of Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids (TLLs) is controlled by the Luttinger parameter. We demonstrate that this parameter can be extracted from a single wave function for one-component TLLs with periodic boundary condition. This method relies on the fact that TLLs are described by conformal field theory in which crosscap states can be constructed. The overlaps between the crosscap states and the ground state as well as some excited states are proved to be universal numbers that directly reveal the Luttinger parameter. In microscopic lattice models, crosscap states are formed by putting each pair of antipodal sites into a maximally entangled state. Analytical and numerical calculations are performed in a few representative models to substantiate the conformal field theory prediction. The extracted Luttinger parameters are generally quite accurate in finite-size systems with moderate lengths, so there is no need to perform data fitting and/or finite-size scaling.

Title: Incommensurate broken helix induced by nonstoichiometry in the axion insulator candidate EuIn$_{2}$As$_{2}$

Abstract: Zintl phase EuIn$_{2}$As$_{2}$ has garnered growing attention as an axion insulator candidate, triggered by the identification of a commensurate double-${\mathbf Q}$ broken-helix state in previous studies, however, its periodicity and symmetry remain subjects of debate. Here, we perform resonant x-ray scattering experiments on EuIn$_{2}$As$_{2}$, revealing an incommensurate nature of the broken-helix state, where both the wave number and the amplitude of the helical modulation exhibit systematic sample dependence. Furthermore, the application of an in-plane magnetic field brings about a fanlike state that appears to preserve the double-${\mathbf Q}$ nature, which might be attributed to multiple-spin interactions in momentum space. We propose that the itinerant character of EuIn$_{2}$As$_{2}$, most likely induced by Eu deficiency, gives rise to the helical modulation and impedes the realization of a theoretically-predicted axion state with the collinear antiferromagnetic order.

Title: The planted directed polymer: inferring a random walk from noisy images
Authors: Sun Woo P. Kim, Austen Lamacraft
Abstract: We introduce and study the planted directed polymer, in which the path of a random walker is inferred from noisy 'images' accumulated at each timestep. Formulated as a nonlinear problem of Bayesian inference for a hidden Markov model, this problem is a generalization of the directed polymer problem of statistical physics, coinciding with it in the limit of zero signal to noise. For a 1D walker we present numerical investigations and analytical arguments that no phase transition is present. When formulated on a Cayley tree, methods developed for the directed polymer are used to show that there is a transition with decreasing signal to noise where effective inference becomes impossible, meaning that the average fractional overlap between the inferred and true paths falls from one to zero.

Title: Hot Carrier Organic Solar Cells
Authors: Priya Viji, Constantin Tormann, Clemens Göhler, Martijn Kemerink
Abstract: Hot-carrier solar cells use the photon excess energy, that is, the energy exceeding the absorber bandgap, to do additional work. These devices have the potential to beat the upper limit for the photovoltaic power conversion efficiency set by near-equilibrium thermodynamics. However, since their conceptual inception in 1982, no experimental realization that works under normal operational conditions has been demonstrated, mostly due to the fast thermalization of photo-generated charges in typical semiconductor materials. Here, we use noise spectroscopy in combination with numerical modelling to show that common bulk heterojunction organic solar cells actually work as hot-carrier devices. Due to static energetic disorder, thermalization of photo-generated electrons and holes in the global density of states is slow compared to the charge carrier lifetime, leading to thermal populations of localized charge carriers that have an electronic temperature exceeding the lattice temperature. Since charge extraction takes place in a high-lying, narrow energy window around the transport energy, the latter takes the role of an energy filter. For common disorder values, this leads to enhancements in open circuit voltage of up to ~0.2 V. We show that this enhancement can be understood as a thermovoltage that is proportional to the temperature difference between the lattice and the charge populations and that comes on top of the near-equilibrium quasi-Fermi level splitting.

Title: A Generalised Haldane Map from the Matrix Product State Path Integral to the Critical Theory of the $J_1$-$J_2$ Chain
Authors: F. Azad, Adam J. McRoberts, Chris Hooley, A. G. Green
Abstract: We study the $J_1$-$J_2$ spin-$1/2$ chain using a path integral constructed over matrix product states (MPS). By virtue of its non-trivial entanglement structure, the MPS ansatz captures the key phases of the model even at a semi-classical, saddle-point level, and, as a variational state, is in good agreement with the field theory obtained by abelian bosonisation. Going beyond the semi-classical level, we show that the MPS ansatz facilitates a physically-motivated derivation of the field theory of the critical phase: by carefully taking the continuum limit -- a generalisation of the Haldane map -- we recover from the MPS path integral a field theory with the correct topological term and emergent $SO(4)$ symmetry, constructively linking the microscopic states and topological field-theoretic structures. Moreover, the dimerisation transition is particularly clear in the MPS formulation -- an explicit dimerisation potential becomes relevant, gapping out the magnetic fluctuations.

Abstract: Optically confined colloidal particles, when placed in close proximity, form a dissipatively coupled system through hydrodynamic interactions. The role of such interactions influencing irreversibility and energy dissipation in out-of-equilibrium systems is often not well deciphered. Here, we demonstrate - through the estimation of the entropy production rate - that the nonequilibrium features of the system with such interactions vary depending on the nature of external driving, and importantly, on the level of coarse-graining. Crucially, we show that coarse-graining reverses the dependence of the measured entropy production rate on the strength of the hydrodynamic interactions. Furthermore, we clarify that such interactions do not violate energy balance at the level of individual trajectories, as was believed earlier. Our results highlight a previously unnoticed effect of coarse-graining in nonequilibrium systems, and have implications for the inference of entropy production in experimental contexts.

Title: Limits to positional information in boundary-driven systems
Authors: Prashant Singh, Karel Proesmans
Abstract: Chemical gradients can be used by a particle to determine its position. This \textit{positional information} is of crucial importance, for example in developmental biology in the formation of patterns in an embryo. The central goal of this paper is to study the fundamental physical limits on how much positional information can be stored inside a system. To achieve this, we study positional information for general boundary-driven systems, and derive, in the near-equilibrium regime, a universal expression involving only the chemical potential and density gradients of the system. We also conjecture that this expression serves as an upper bound on the positional information of boundary driven systems beyond linear response. To support this claim, we test it on a broad range of solvable boundary-driven systems.

Title: Diagnosing Altermagnetic Phases through Quantum Oscillations
Authors: Zhi-Xia Li, Xiangang Wan, Wei Chen
Abstract: The recently delimited altermagnetic phase is characterized by zero net magnetization but momentum-dependent collinear spin-splitting. To explore the intriguing physical effects and potential applications of altermagnets, it is essential to analyze their Fermi surface properties, encompassing both configurations and spin textures. Here, we conduct a Fermiology study on metallic altermagnets and demonstrate that the collinear spin-split features of their Fermi surfaces can be clearly revealed through quantum oscillation measurements. By introducing a transverse Zeeman field to remove the spin-degenerate lines in the momentum space, the Fermi surface undergoes a Lifshitz transition, giving rise to spin-flipped cyclotron motion between orbits with opposite spins. Accordingly, the Lifshitz-Onsager quantization yields two sets of Landau levels, leading to frequency splitting of the Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations in conductivity. In the presence of spin-orbit coupling, the Zeeman field causes two separate cyclotron orbits to merge at the Lifshitz transition point before splitting again. This results in the two original frequencies discontinuously changing into a single frequency equal to their sum. Our work unveils a unique and universal signature of altermagnetic Fermi surfaces that can be probed through quantum oscillation measurements.

Title: Out-of-equilibrium Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis
Authors: Laura Foini, Anatoly Dymarsky, Silvia Pappalardi
Abstract: Understanding how out-of-equilibrium states thermalize under quantum unitary dynamics is an important problem in many-body physics. In this work, we propose a statistical ansatz for the matrix elements of non-equilibrium initial states in the energy eigenbasis, in order to describe such evolution. The approach is inspired by the Eigenstate Thermalisation Hypothesis (ETH) but the proposed ansatz exhibits different scaling. Importantly, we point out the exponentially small cross-correlations between the observable and the initial state matrix elements that determine relaxation dynamics toward equilibrium. We numerically verify scaling and cross-correlation, point out the emergent universality of the high-frequency behavior, and outline possible generalizations.

Title: Embracing Nonlinearity and Geometry: A dimensional analysis guided design of shock absorbing materials
Authors: Abhishek Gupta, Komal Chawla, Ramathasan Thevamaran
Abstract: Protective applications require energy-absorbing materials that are soft and compressible enough to absorb kinetic energy from impacts, yet stiff enough to bear crushing loads. Achieving this balance requires careful consideration of both mechanical properties of the material and geometry of the shock-absorbing pads. Conventional shock-absorbing pads are typically made from very thick foams that exhibit a plateau of constant stress in their stress-strain response, while foams with a non-linearly stiffening stress-strain response are often considered ineffective. Contrary to this belief, we demonstrate that foams with a nonlinear stress-strain response can be effective for achieving protective pads that are both thin and lightweight, particularly for pad geometries requiring a large cross-sectional area. We introduce a new framework for the thickness or volume-constrained design of compact and lightweight protective foams while ensuring the desired structural integrity and mechanical performance. Our streamlined dimensional analysis provides geometric constraints on the dimensionless thickness and cross-sectional area of a protective foam with a given stress-strain response to limit the acceleration and compressive strain within desired critical limits. We also identify optimal mechanical properties that will result in the most compact and lightest protective foam pad for absorbing the given kinetic energy of impact. Guided by this design framework, we achieve optimal protective properties in hierarchically architected vertically aligned carbon nanotube (VACNT) foams, enabling next generation protective applications in extreme environments.

Title: Can the noble metals (Au, Ag and Cu) be superconductors?
Authors: Giovanni A. Ummarino, Alessio Zaccone
Abstract: It is common knowledge that noble metals are excellent conductors but do not exhibit superconductivity. On the other hand, quantum confinement in thin films has been consistently shown to induce a significant enhancement of the superconducting critical temperature in several superconductors. It is therefore an important fundamental question whether ultra-thin film confinement may induce observable superconductivity in non-superconducting metals. We present a generalization, in the Eliashberg framework, of a BCS theory of superconductivity in good metals under thin-film confinement. By numerically solving these new Eliashberg-type equations, we find the dependence of the superconducting critical temperature on the film thickness $L$. This parameter-free theory predicts a maximum increase in the critical temperature for a specific value of the film thickness, which is a function of the number of free carriers in the material. Exploiting this fact, we predict that ultra-thin films of gold, silver and copper of suitable thickness could be superconductors at low but experimentally accessible temperatures. We demonstrate that this is a fine-tuning problem where the thickness must assume a very precise value, close to half a nanometer.

Title: Topological magnons in a collinear altermagnet
Authors: Meng-Han Zhang, Lu Xiao, Dao-Xin Yao
Abstract: We propose a model with Weyl magnons and nodal-line magnons ($\mathbb{Z}_2$) in a collinear altermagnet on the honeycomb lattice. Altermagnetic magnon bands can be realized by breaking the symmetry of the second nearest neighbor exchange couplings without the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI). In addition to the Chern number and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant, chirality is important to describe the magnon topology. The model shows the nonzero magnon spin Nernst effect when a longitudinal temperature gradient exists. We calculate the differential gyromagnetic ratio induced purely by the topology of altermagnetic magnons, which can be probed through the Einstein-de Haas (EdH) effect.

Title: Superconducting Order Parameters in Spin Space Groups: Methodology and Application
Authors: Xilin Feng, Zhongyi Zhang
Abstract: We employ a systematic approach to construct superconducting order parameters based on the spin space group. Compared to magnetic space groups where spatial and spin rotation of elements are completely locked, the superconducting channels and the forms of basis functions in spin space groups can be different. Furthermore, we utilize the obtained basis functions to construct the Ginzburg-Landau free energy and discuss the possible superconducting ground states as well as the interplay between superconducting states and magnetic orders. By virtue of those results, we discuss the application of our theory to realistic systems. Our work provides a rigorous description of superconducting gap functions in the case of spin space group, and enables further study of the interplay between superconductivity and magnetism.

Title: Design and Predict Tetragonal van der Waals Layered Quantum Materials of MPd$_5$I$_2$ (M=Ga, In and 3$d$ Transition Metals)
Authors: Niraj K. Nepal, Tyler J. Slade, Joanna M. Blawat, Andrew Eaton, Johanna C. Palmstrom, Benjamin G. Ueland, Adam Kaminski, Robert J. McQueeney, Ross D. McDonald, Paul C. Canfield, Lin-Lin Wang
Abstract: Quantum materials with stacked van der Waals (vdW) layers hosting non-trivial band structure topology and magnetism have shown many interesting properties. Using high throughput density functional theory calculations, we design and predict tetragonal vdW-layered quantum materials in the MPd$_5$I$_2$ structure (M=Ga, In and 3d transition metals). We show that besides the known AlPd$_5$I$_2$, the -MPd$_5$- structural motif of three-atomic-layer slabs separated by two I layers can accommodate a variety of metal atoms giving arise to topologically non-trivial features and highly tunable magnetic properties in both bulk and single layer 2D structures. Among them, TiPd$_5$I$_2$ and InPd$_5$I$_2$ host a pair of Dirac points and likely an additional strong topological insulator state for the band manifolds just above and below the top valence band, respectively, with their single layers hosting or near quantum spin Hall states. CrPd$_5$I$_2$ is a ferromagnet with a large out-of-plane magneto-anisotropy energy, desirable for rare-earth-free permanent magnets.

Title: Insulator-Metal Transition and Magnetic Crossover in Bilayer Graphene
Authors: Amarnath Chakraborty, Aleksandr Rodin, Shaffique Adam, Giovanni Vignale
Abstract: In-plane magnetic fields offer a relatively unexplored opportunity to alter the band structure of stacks of 2D materials so that they exhibit desired physical properties. Here we show that an in-plane magnetic field combined with a transverse electric field can induce an insulator-metal (IM) transition in bilayer graphene. Our study of the magnetic response reveals that the orbital magnetic susceptibility changes from diamagnetic to paramagnetic around the transition point. We discuss several strategies to observe the IM transition, switch the diamagnetism, and more generally control the band structure of stacked 2D materials at experimentally accessible magnetic fields.

Title: Signatures of Chiral Superconductivity in Rhombohedral Graphene

Abstract: Chiral superconductors are unconventional superconducting states that break time reversal symmetry spontaneously and typically feature Cooper pairing at non-zero angular momentum. Such states may host Majorana fermions and provide an important platform for topological physics research and fault-tolerant quantum computing. Despite intensive search and prolonged studies of several candidate systems, chiral superconductivity has remained elusive so far. Here we report the discovery of robust unconventional superconductivity in rhombohedral tetra- and penta-layer graphene in the absence of moiré superlattice effects. We observed two superconducting states in the gate-induced flat conduction bands with Tc up to 300 mK and charge density ne as low as 2.4*1011 cm-2 in three tetralayer and two pentalayer devices. Spontaneous time-reversal-symmetry-breaking (TRSB) due to electron's orbital motion is found, and several observations indicate the chiral nature of these superconducting states, including: 1. In the superconducting state, Rxx shows magnetic hysteresis in varying out-of-plane magnetic field B, which is absent from all other superconductors; 2. the superconducting states are immune to in-plane magnetic field and are developed within a spin- and valley-polarized quarter-metal phase; 3. the normal states show anomalous Hall signals at zero magnetic field and magnetic hysteresis. We also observed a critical B of up to 1.4 Tesla, higher than any graphene superconductivity reported so far and indicates a strong-coupling superconductivity close to the BCS-BEC crossover. Our observations establish a pure carbon material for the study of topological superconductivity, and pave the way to explore Majorana modes and topological quantum computing.

Title: Orbital magnetoelectric coupling of three dimensional Chern insulators
Authors: Xin Lu, Renwen Jiang, Zhongqing Guo, Jianpeng Liu
Abstract: Orbital magnetoelectric effect is closely related to the band topology of bulk crystalline insulators. Typical examples include the half quantized Chern-Simons orbital magnetoelectric coupling in three dimensional (3D) axion insulators and topological insulators, which are the hallmarks of their nontrivial bulk band topology. While the Chern-Simons coupling is well defined only for insulators with zero Chern number, the orbital magnetoelectric effects in 3D Chern insulators with nonzero (layer) Chern numbers are still open questions. In this work, we propose a never-mentioned quantization rule for the orbital magnetoelectric response in 3D Chern insulators, the spatial gradient of which is exactly quantized in unit of $e^2/h$. By theoretical analysis and numerical simulations, we demonstrate that such quantized orbital magnetoelectric response is exact for various types of interlayer hoppings and stackings, and remains robust even against disorder and lack of crystalline symmetries. We argue that the exact quantization has a topological origin and is protected by Chern number. Furthermore, we propose two promising material platforms to observe the proposed quantized orbital magnetoelectric response thanks to recent experimental developments in detecting spatial magnetic-field distributions in device systems.

Title: Higher-Rank Spin Liquids and Spin Nematics from Competing Orders in Pyrochlore Magnets
Authors: Niccolò Francini, Lukas Janssen, Daniel Lozano-Gómez
Abstract: Pyrochlore magnets have proven to provide an excellent arena for the realization of a variety of many-body phenomena such as classical and quantum order-by-disorder, as well as spin liquid phases described by emergent gauge field theories. These phenomena arise from the competition between different symmetry-breaking magnetic orders. In this work, we consider a subspace of the most general bilinear nearest-neighbor Hamiltonian on the pyrochlore lattice, parameterized by the local interaction parameter $J_{z\pm}$, where three symmetry-breaking phases converge. We demonstrate that for small values of $|J_{z\pm}|$, a conventional $\mathbf q=0$ ordered phase is selected by a thermal order-by-disorder mechanism. For $|J_{z\pm}|$ above a certain finite threshold, a novel spin-nematic phase is stabilized at low temperatures. Instead of the usual Bragg peaks, the spin-nematic phase features lines of high intensity in the spin structure factor. At intermediate temperatures above the low-temperature orders, a rank-2 U(1) classical spin liquid is realized for all $J_{z\pm} \neq 0$. We fully characterize all phases using classical Monte-Carlo simulations and a self-consistent Gaussian approximation.

Title: Dielectric and optical markers originating from quantum geometry
Authors: Wei Chen
Abstract: We elaborate that many non-excitonic dielectric and optical properties of semiconductors and insulators caused by interband absorption are originated from quantum geometry, including charge susceptibility, relative dielectric constant, optical conductivity, dielectric function, refractive index, absorption coefficient, reflectance, and transmittance. The key to this recognition is the complex optical conductivity, which contains the quantum metric in the optical transition matrix element, and the fact that all these dielectric and optical properties can be expressed in terms of the real and imaginary parts of optical conductivity. Our formalism allows to map all these properties to real space lattice sites as local markers, which can help to explain the spatial inhomogeneity of optical properties detected by near-field scanning optical microscopy, as demonstrated by a minimal model of 3D topological insulators. In addition, the dielectric function marker can be used to detect a recently proposed fidelity marker, or equivalently the spread of valence-band Wannier functions generalized to disordered insulators.

Title: Ferrimagnetism from triple-q order in Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$
Authors: Niccolò Francini, Lukas Janssen
Abstract: The candidate Kitaev magnet Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$ exhibits a characteristic ferrimagnetic response at low temperatures, with a finite residual magnetization that changes sign at a compensation point located at around half the ordering temperature. We argue that the behavior can be naturally understood to arise in this material as a consequence of a noncollinear triple-$\mathbf{q}$ magnetic ground state. Using large-scale classical Monte Carlo simulations, we study the finite-temperature response of the pertinent honeycomb Heisenberg-Kitaev-$\Gamma$-$\Gamma'$ model in weak training fields. Our model features all symmetry-allowed nearest-neighbor exchange interactions, as well as sublattice-dependent next-nearest-neighbor interactions, consistent with the reported crystal structure of the material. We also consider a six-spin ring exchange perturbation, which allows us to tune between the two different magnetic long-range orders that have been suggested for this material in the literature, namely, a collinear single-$\mathbf{q}$ zigzag state and a noncollinear triple-$\mathbf{q}$ state. We demonstrate that the experimentally-observed ferrimagnetic response of Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$ can be well described within our modeling if the magnetic ground state features noncollinear triple-$\mathbf{q}$ order. The observation of a compensation point, where the residual magnetization reverses sign, suggests a sublattice $g$-factor anisotropy, with a larger out-of-plane $g$-factor on the sublattice with stronger antiferromagnetic intrasublattice exchange. By contrast, a classical Heisenberg-Kitaev-$\Gamma$-$\Gamma'$-type model with collinear zigzag ground state is insufficient even in principle to describe the observed behavior. Our results illustrate the unconventional physics of noncollinear magnetic long-range orders hosted by frustrated magnets with bond-dependent interactions.

Title: Thermal Broadening of Phonon Spectral Function in Classical Lattice Models: Projective Truncation Approximation
Authors: Hu-Wei Jia, Wen-Jun Liu, Yue-Hong Wu, Kou-Han Ma, Lei Wang, Ning-Hua Tong
Abstract: Thermal broadening of the quasi-particle peak in the spectral function is an important physical feature in many statistical systems, but it is difficult to calculate. To tackle this problem, we propose the $H$-expanded basis within the projective truncation approximation (PTA) of the Green's function equation of motion. A zeros-removing technique is introduced to stabilize the iterative solution of the PTA equations. Benchmarking calculations on the classical one-variable anharmonic oscillator model and the one-dimensional $\phi^4$ lattice model show that the thermal broadened quasi-particle peak in the spectral function can be produced on a semi-quantitative level. Using this method, we discuss the low- and high- temperature power-law behaviors of the spectral width $\Gamma_k(T)$ of the one-dimensional $\phi^4$ model, finding it in contradiction with the assumption of effective phonon theory. A short-chain limit of this model is also discovered. Issues of extending the $H$-expanded basis to quantum systems and of the applicability of the Debye formula for thermal conductivity are discussed.

Title: $NVU$ view on energy polydisperse Lennard-Jones systems
Authors: Danqi Lang, Lorenzo Costigliola, Jeppe C. Dyre
Abstract: When energy polydispersity is introduced into the Lennard-Jones (LJ) system, there is little effect on structure and dynamics [Ingebrigtsen and Dyre, J. Phys. Chem. B 127, 2837 (2023)]. For instance, at a given state point both the radial distribution function and the mean-square displacement as a function of time are virtually unaffected by even large energy polydispersity, which is in stark contrast to what happens when size polydispersity is introduced. We here argue -- and validate by simulations of up to 30\% polydispersity -- that this almost invariance of structure and dynamics reflects an approximate invariance of the constant-potential-energy surface. Because $NVU$ dynamics defined as geodesic motion at constant potential energy is equivalent to Newtonian dynamics in the thermodynamic limit, the approximate invariance of the constant-potential-energy surface implies virtually the same physics of energy polydisperse LJ systems as of the standard single-component version. In contrast, the constant-potential-energy surface is significantly affected by introducing size polydispersity.

Title: Transition between critical antiferromagnetic phases in the $J_1$-$J_2$ spin chain
Authors: Adam J. McRoberts, Chris Hooley, A. G. Green
Abstract: The $J_1$--$J_2$ spin chain is one of the canonical models of quantum magnetism, and has long been known to host a critical antiferromagnetic phase with power-law decay of spin correlations. We show in this letter that there are, in fact, two distinct critical phases: the `Affleck-Haldane' phase, where the dimer field that parametrises local singlet order is part of a joint $O(4)$ Néel-singlet order parameter; and the `Zirnbauer' phase, where the dimer field is gapped out and the critical theory involves only an $O(3)$ Néel order parameter. The phases are so-named because each realises one of the competing pictures for how the $O(3)$ non-linear sigma model with a topological theta term renormalises to the $\mathfrak{\hat{su}}(2)_1$ Wess-Zumino-Witten model.

Title: AI-driven inverse design of materials: Past, present and future
Authors: Xiao-Qi Han, Xin-De Wang, Meng-Yuan Xu, Zhen Feng, Bo-Wen Yao, Peng-Jie Guo, Ze-Feng Gao, Zhong-Yi Lu
Abstract: The discovery of advanced materials is the cornerstone of human technological development and progress. The structures of materials and their corresponding properties are essentially the result of a complex interplay of multiple degrees of freedom such as lattice, charge, spin, symmetry, and topology. This poses significant challenges for the inverse design methods of materials. Humans have long explored new materials through a large number of experiments and proposed corresponding theoretical systems to predict new material properties and structures. With the improvement of computational power, researchers have gradually developed various electronic structure calculation methods, such as the density functional theory and high-throughput computational methods. Recently, the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology in the field of computer science has enabled the effective characterization of the implicit association between material properties and structures, thus opening up an efficient paradigm for the inverse design of functional materials. A significant progress has been made in inverse design of materials based on generative and discriminative models, attracting widespread attention from researchers. Considering this rapid technological progress, in this survey, we look back on the latest advancements in AI-driven inverse design of materials by introducing the background, key findings, and mainstream technological development routes. In addition, we summarize the remaining issues for future directions. This survey provides the latest overview of AI-driven inverse design of materials, which can serve as a useful resource for researchers.

Title: Single-boson exchange formulation of the Schwinger-Dyson equation and its application to the functional renormalization group
Authors: Miriam Patricolo, Marcel Gievers, Kilian Fraboulet, Aiman Al-Eryani, Sarah Heinzelmann, Pietro M. Bonetti, Alessandro Toschi, Demetrio Vilardi, Sabine Andergassen
Abstract: We extend the recently introduced single-boson exchange formulation to the computation of the self-energy from the Schwinger--Dyson equation (SDE). In particular, we derive its expression both in diagrammatic and in physical channels. The simple form of the single-boson exchange SDE, involving only the bosonic propagator and the fermion-boson vertex, but not the rest function, allows for an efficient numerical implementation. We furthermore discuss its implications in a truncated unity solver, where a restricted number of form factors introduces an information loss in the projection of the momentum dependence that in general affects the equivalence between the different channel representations. In the application to the functional renormalization group, we find that the convergence in the number of form factors depends on the channel representation of the SDE. For the two-dimensional Hubbard model at weak coupling, the pseudogap opening driven by antiferromagnetic fluctuations is captured already by a single ($s$-wave) form factor in the magnetic channel representation, differently to the density and superconducting channels.

Title: Normal and lateral Casimir-Lifshitz forces between a nanoparticle and a graphene grating
Authors: Minggang Luo, Youssef Jeyar, Brahim Guizal, Mauro Antezza
Abstract: We study the normal and lateral components of the Casimir-Lifshitz (CL) force between a nanoparticle and 1D graphene grating deposited on a fused silica slab. For this purpose, the scattering matrix approach together with the Fourier modal method augmented with local basis functions are used. We find that, by covering a fused silica slab by a graphene grating, the spectrum of the normal CL force at small frequencies is increased by about 100% for a grating filling fraction of 0.5, and even more when the slab is completely covered. The typically employed additive approximation (the weighted average of the force with and without the graphene coating) cannot provide any information on the lateral CL force, and, as we show, cannot provide accurate estimation for the normal CL force. When the nanoparticle is laterally shifted ($x_A$), the normal CL force is modulated and remains attractive. On the contrary, the lateral CL force changes sign twice in each period, showing a series of alternating stable and unstable lateral equilibrium positions, occurring in the graphene strips and of the grating slits regions, respectively. Finally, we show that the lateral shift effect is sensitive to the geometric factor $d/D$ ($d$ is the separation distance, and $D$ is the grating period). We identify two clear regions: a region ($d/D<1.0$) where the lateral shift significantly affects the CL energy, and a region ($d/D \geq 1.0$) where this effect is negligible, with a crossover at $d\approx D$. Our predictions can have relevant implications to experiments and applications of the CL normal and lateral forces acting on nanoparticles interacting with structured objects at the nano/micro scale, and are also directly valid for atoms close to these nanostructures.

Title: Gross-Neveu-Yukawa SO(2) and SO(3) tensorial criticality
Authors: SangEun Han, Shouryya Ray, Igor F. Herbut
Abstract: We investigate the relativistic SO(2)- and SO(3)-invariant Gross-Neveu-Yukawa field theories for real, rank-two, symmetric, traceless tensor order parameters coupled to $N_{\text{f}}$ flavors of two-component Dirac fermions. These field theories arise as an effective description of fractionalized spin-orbital liquids. The two theories are the simplest and special cases of the more general class of field theories with SO($N$) symmetric tensor order parameter coupled to Dirac fermions, in which the symmetry is low enough to allow only one, and not the usual two quartic self-interaction terms. Using two-loop renormalization group near the upper critical dimension, we demonstrate that the theory exhibits a new critical fixed point for $N=3$ and the concomitant continuous phase transition for any value of $N_{\text{f}}$. For $N=2$ the theory is equivalent to the chiral XY model. We discuss the crucial role of the symmetry-allowed sextic self-interactions in the selection of the ground state configuration in the case of SO(3). The universal quantities such as the the anomalous dimensions of order parameters and fermions, the correlation length exponent, and the mass gap ratio between order parameter and fermion masses are computed up to $\epsilon^{2}$ order.

Title: Manipulation of helical states revealed by crossed Andreev reflection
Authors: Wei Luo, Yating Zhang, Wei Chen
Abstract: The edge states of a quantum spin Hall insulator exhibit helical properties, which has generated significant interest in the field of spintronics. Although it is predicted theoretically that Rashba spin-orbit coupling can effectively regulate edge state spin, experimental characterization of this spin control remains challenging. Here, we propose utilizing crossed Andreev reflection to probe the efficiency of gate voltage control on edge state spin. We calculate the transport properties of the quantum spin Hall isolators-superconductor heterojunction by using non-equilibrium Green's function method. We find that the probabilities of crossed Andreev reflection, electron transmission, and non-local conductance all include the relative spin rotation angle $\theta$ caused by the Rashba spin-orbit coupling in the helical edge states. Notably, when the incident energy is close to the superconducting gap, the differential conductance $G_2\propto-\cos{\theta}$. Thus, the influence of Rashba spin-orbit coupling on edge state spin can be quantitatively characterized by crossed Andreev reflection, which provides a feasible scheme for experimental testing.

Title: Excitations of a supersolid annular stripe phase in a spin-orbital-angular-momentum-coupled spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate
Authors: Paramjeet Banger, Rajat, Sandeep Gautam
Abstract: We present a theoretical study of the collective excitations of the supersolid annular stripe phase of a spin-orbital-angular-momentum-coupled (SOAM-coupled) spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate. The annular stripe phase simultaneously breaks two continuous symmetries, namely rotational and $U(1)$ gauge symmetry, and is more probable in the condensates with a larger orbital angular momentum transfer imparted by a pair of Laguerre-Gaussian beams than what has been considered in the recent experiments. Accordingly, we consider a SOAM-coupled spin-1 condensate with a $4\hbar$ orbital angular momentum transferred by the lasers. Depending on the values of the Raman coupling strength and quadratic Zeeman term, the condensate with realistic antiferromagnetic interactions supports three ground-state phases: the annular stripe, the vortex necklace, and the zero angular momentum phase. We numerically calculate the collective excitations of the condensate as a function of coupling and quadratic Zeeman field strengths for a fixed ratio of spin-dependent and spin-independent interaction strengths. At low Raman coupling strengths, we observe a direct transition from the zero angular momentum to the annular stripe phase, characterized by the softening of a double symmetric roton mode, which serves as a precursor to supersolidity.

Title: Dewetting Fingering Instability in Capillary Suspensions: Role of Particles and Liquid Bridges
Authors: Lingyue Liu, Mete Abbot, Philipp Brockmann, Ilia V. Roisman, Jeanette Hussong, Erin Koos
Abstract: This study investigates the fingering instability that forms during stretching of capillary suspensions with and without added nanoparticles. The dewetting process is observed using a transparent lifted Hele-Shaw cell. The liquid bridge is stretched under constant acceleration, and the resulting instability patterns are recorded using two high-speed cameras. Finger-like structures, characteristic of the Saffman-Taylor instability are observed. The total length of the dendrites and the intersecting number of branches are quantified. We reveal the roles of microparticles, nanoparticles, and the secondary liquid during the fingering instability. The addition of microparticles to pure liquid enhanced finger length due to increased particle interactions and nucleation sites for bubbles. The addition of secondary fluid reduces fingering length by forming a strong interparticle network. Incorporation of nanoparticles induces an early onset of cavitation and enhances fingering instability. However, nanoparticles make the capillary suspensions' overall microstructure more homogeneous, reduce the sample variation in fingering patterns, and promote the even distribution of gel on both slides during splitting. These findings highlight the complex interactions governing dewetting in capillary (nano)suspensions. This knowledge has potential applications in microfluidics, 3D printing, and thin-film coatings, where controlling dewetting is crucial.

Title: Rainbow chains and numerical renormalisation group for accurate chiral conformal spectra
Authors: Attila Szabó
Abstract: Based on the relationship between reduced and thermal density matrices in conformal field theory (CFT), we show that the entanglement spectrum of a conformal critical chain with exponentially decaying terms consists of conformal towers of the associated chiral CFT, with only weak finite-size effects. Through free-fermion and interacting examples, we show that these entanglement spectra present a reliable method to extract detailed CFT spectra from single wave functions without access to the parent Hamiltonian. We complement our method with a Wilsonian numerical renormalisation group algorithm for solving interacting, exponentially decaying chain Hamiltonians.

Title: Barkhausen noise in the columnar hexagonal organic ferroelectric BTA
Authors: Andrey Alekseevich Butkevich, Fabian T. Thome, Toni Seiler, Marcel Hecker, Martijn Kemerink
Abstract: Upon a polarization reversal within a ferroelectric material, one stable state changes into another which is typically described by a progression of switching events of smaller fractions of the material. These events give rise to crackling or Barkhausen noise and follow a characteristic distribution in their sizes. Barkhausen noise has been studied to better understand the switching processes of ferroelectrics and has been applied for inorganic ferroelectric materials and perovskites. In this work, we present results from kinetic Monte Carlo simulations investigating the switching process of the small organic molecular ferroelectric benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxamides (BTAs). For temperatures below 175 K and sufficiently strong structural disorder, the system exhibits self-organized critical behavior; for higher temperatures, a creep regime is entered. Our extracted power-law exponents are smaller than those typically measured in inorganic crystals and ceramics which indicates that in the more disordered material BTA larger spanning avalanches are possible. The system was experimentally investigated with a high-sensitivity setup. No Barkhausen noise was observed which is consistent with the simulated event sizes, lying several orders beneath the noise threshold of the experimental setup. This finding corroborates the notion that switching in BTA progresses along the 1D columns in the hexagonal liquid crystal lattice, with little coupling between the columns that could give rise to larger lateral avalanches.

Title: Quantum Criticality of Type-I and Critically Tilted Dirac Semimetals
Authors: Huanzhi Hu, Frank Krüger
Abstract: We investigate the universality of an Ising symmetry breaking phase transition of tilted two-dimensional Dirac fermions, in the type-I phase as well as at the Lifshitz transition between a type-I and a type-II semimetal, where the Fermi surface changes from point-like to one with electron and hole pockets that touch at the overtilted Dirac cones. We compute the Landau damping of long-wavelength order parameter fluctuations by tilted Dirac fermions and use the resulting IR propagator as input for a renormalisation-group analysis of the resulting Gross-Neveu-Yukawa field theory. We first demonstrate that the criticality of tilted type-I fermions is controlled by a line of fixed points along which the poles of the renormalised Green function correspond to an untilted Dirac spectrum with varying anisotropy of Fermi velocities. At the phase transition the Lorentz invariance is restored, resulting in the same critical exponents as for conventional Dirac systems. The multicritical point is given by the endpoint of the fixed-point line. It can be approached along any path in parameter space that avoids the fixed point line of the critical type-I semimetal. We show that the critical exponents at the Lifshitz point are different and that Lorentz invariance is broken.

Authors: D. Popadiuk, V. Borynskyi, A. Kravets, Y. Shlapa, S. Solopan, A. Belous, A. Tovstolytkin, V. Korenivski
Abstract: Spin dynamics in Al-substituted yttrium iron garnets is investigated using broadband ferromagnetic resonance measurements in the temperature range T=200-360 K. Using the measured data, the resonance field and linewidth as well as their temperature dependence are determined, with implications for the uniformity and overall quality of the samples prepared via different chemical fabrication routes. These key parameters governing the spin dynamics in the material are important for its applications in high-speed spintronic and magnonic devices.

Title: Crossed Andreev reflection in collinear $p$-wave magnet-triplet superconductor junctions
Authors: Abhiram Soori
Abstract: Crossed Andreev reflection (CAR) is a fundamental quantum transport phenomenon that holds significant implications for spintronics and superconducting devices. However, its experimental detection and enhancement remain challenging. Recently, magnetic materials exhibiting $p$-wave magnetic ordering, distinct from conventional spin-orbit coupling, referred to as $p$-wave magnets, have attracted considerable interest. In this work, we propose a junction consisting of $p$-wave magnets and a triplet superconductor as a promising platform to enhance CAR. The setup features a triplet superconductor sandwiched between two collinear $p$-wave magnets rotated by $180^\circ$ relative to each other, allowing for precise control over transport processes. We demonstrate that CAR can dominate over electron tunneling (ET) within specific parameter regimes, such as the orientation angle of the $p$-wave magnets and their chemical potential. Enhanced CAR occurs when the constant energy contours of the two spins in the $p$-wave magnets are well-separated. Furthermore, the conductivities display Fabry-Pérot-type oscillations due to interference effects, with CAR diminishing as the length of the superconductor exceeds the decay length of the wavefunctions. These findings underscore the potential of collinear $p$-wave magnet-superconductor junctions as a robust platform for the experimental investigation and enhancement of CAR.

Title: Undamped Soliton-like Domain Wall Motion in Sliding Ferroelectrics
Authors: Yubai Shi, Yuxiang Gao, Ri He, Hua Wang, Binwen Zhang, Zhicheng Zhong
Abstract: Sliding ferroelectricity in bilayer van der Waals materials exhibits ultrafast switching speed and fatigue resistance during the polarization switching, offering an avenue for the design of memories and neuromorphic devices. The unique polarization switching behavior originates from the distinct characteristics of domain wall (DW), which possesses broader width and faster motion compared to conventional ferroelectrics. Herein, using machine-learning-assisted molecular dynamics simulations and field theory analysis, we predict an undamped soliton-like DW motion in sliding ferroelectrics. It is found that the DW in sliding ferroelectric bilayer 3R-MoS2 exhibits uniformly accelerated motion under an external field, with its velocity ultimately reaches the relativistic-like limit due to continuous acceleration. Remarkably, the DW velocity remains constant even after the external field removal, completely deviating from the velocity breakdown observed in conventional ferroelectrics. This work provides opportunities for applications of sliding ferroelectrics in memory devices based on DW engineering.

Title: Allegro-FM: Towards Equivariant Foundation Model for Exascale Molecular Dynamics Simulations
Authors: Ken-ichi Nomura, Shinnosuke Hattori, Satoshi Ohmura, Ikumi Kanemasu, Kohei Shimamura, Nabankur Dasgupta, Aiichiro Nakano, Rajiv K. Kalia, Priya Vashishta
Abstract: We present a foundation model for exascale molecular dynamics simulations by leveraging an E(3) equivariant network architecture (Allegro) and a set of large-scale organic and inorganic materials datasets merged by Total Energy Alignment (TEA) framework. Thanks to the large-scale training sets, the obtained model (Allegro-FM) is versatile for various materials simulations for diverse downstream tasks covering 89 elements in the periodic table. Allegro-FM exhibits excellent agreements with high-level quantum chemistry theories in describing structural, mechanical, and thermodynamic properties, while exhibiting emergent capabilities for structural correlations, reaction kinetics, mechanical strengths, fracture, and solid/liquid dissolution, for which the model has not been trained. Furthermore, we demonstrate the robust predictability and generalizability of Allegro-FM for chemical reactions using the Transition1x that consists of 10k organic reactions and 9.6 million configurations including transition state data, as well as calcium silicate hydrates as a testbed. With its computationally efficient, strictly-local network architecture, Allegro-FM scales up to multi-billion-atom systems with a parallel efficiency of 0.964 on the exaflop/s Aurora supercomputer at Argonne Leadership Computing Facility. The approach presented in this work demonstrates the potential of the foundation model for a novel materials design and discovery based on large-scale atomistic simulations.

Title: Microscopic mechanism of electric field-induced superconductivity suppression in metallic thin films
Authors: Alessio Zaccone, Giovanni A. Ummarino, Alessandro Braggio, Francesco Giazotto
Abstract: Supercurrent field-effect transistors made from thin metallic films are a promising option for next-generation high-performance computation platforms. Despite extensive research, there is still no complete quantitative microscopic explanation for how an external DC electric field suppresses superconductivity in thin films. This study aims to provide a quantitative description of superconductivity as a function of film thickness based on Eliashberg's theory. The calculation considers the electrostatics of the electric field, its realistic penetration depth in the film, and its effect on the Cooper pair, which is described as a standard s-wave bound state according to BCS theory. The estimation suggests that an external electric field of approximately $10^8$ V/m is required to suppress superconductivity in 10-30-nm-thick films, which aligns with experimental observations. Ultimately, the study offers "materials by design" guidelines for suppressing supercurrent when an external electric field is applied to the film surface. Furthermore, the proposed framework can be easily extended to investigate the same effects for ultrathin films.

Title: Large Deviation Theory for Bose Gas of Photons and Planck's Oscillators
Authors: D. P. Shinde
Abstract: We utilize large deviation theorems to analyze the distributions of a Bose gas of photons and Planck's identical linear oscillators. By applying the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramér-Chernoff theorems, we calculate the large deviation probabilities, entropies, and rate functions for the spatial and energy distributions of both photons and Planck's oscillators. Our study reproduces the results of Bose and Planck within the framework of large deviation theory.

Title: Antisymmetry rules of response properties in certain chemical spaces
Authors: Takafumi Shiraogawa, Simon León Krug, Masahiro Ehara, O. Anatole von Lilienfeld
Abstract: Understanding chemical compound space (CCS), a set of molecules and materials, is crucial for the rational discovery of molecules and materials. Concepts of symmetry have recently been introduced into CCS to account for near degeneracies and differences in electronic energies between iso-electronic materials. In this work, we present approximate relationships of response properties based on a first-principles view of CCS. They have been derived from perturbation theory and antisymmetry considerations involving nuclear charges. These rules allow approximate predictions of relative response properties of pairs of distinct compounds with opposite nuclear charge variations from a highly symmetric reference material, without the need for experiments or quantum chemical calculations of each compound. We numerically and statistically verified these rules for electric and magnetic response properties (electric dipole moment, polarizabilities, hyperpolarizabilities, and magnetizabilities) among charge-neutral and iso-electronic BN-doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon derivatives of naphthalene, anthracene, and pyrene. Our analysis indicates that, despite their simplicity, antisymmetry rule-based predictions are remarkably accurate, enabling dimensionality reduction of CCS. Response properties in alchemical perturbation density functional theory were investigated to clarify the origin of this predictive power.

Title: AV$_3$Sb$_5$ kagome superconductors: a review with transport measurements
Authors: Zhuokai Xu, Tian Le, Xiao Lin
Abstract: Kagome systems have garnered considerable attention due to the unique features of the sublattice structure and band topology. The recently discovered kagome metals AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (where A = K, Rb, Cs) host a rich array of symmetry-breaking phases, including exotic charge density waves (CDW), electronic nematicity, pair density waves (PDW) and superconductivity. Despite extensive experimental and theoretical investigations into the diverse phases, several key issues remain contentious, such as a solid clarification of the time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRS-breaking) in the CDW order and its implications for the nature of superconducting (SC) pairing symmetry. This review aims to shed light on the transport properties of these intertwined phases, emphasizing the pivotal role that transport measurements play in uncovering the non-trivial quantum states of matter.

Title: Why epithelial cells collectively move against a traveling signal wave
Authors: Tatsuya Fukuyama, Hiroyuki Ebata, Akihisa Yamamoto, Ryo Ienaga, Yohei Kondo, Motomu Tanaka, Satoru Kidoaki, Kazuhiro Aoki, Yusuke T. Maeda
Abstract: The response of cell populations to external stimuli plays a central role in biological mechanical processes such as epithelial wound healing and developmental morphogenesis. Wave-like propagation of a signal of ERK MAP kinase has been shown to direct collective migration in one direction; however, the mechanism based on continuum mechanics under a traveling wave is not fully understood. To elucidate how the traveling wave of the ERK kinase signal directs collective migration, we constructed the mechanical model of the epithelial cell monolayer by considering the signal-dependent coordination of contractile stress and cellular orientation. The proposed model was studied by using an optogenetically-controlled cell system where we found that local signal activation induces changes in cell density and orientation with the direction of propagation. The net motion of the cell population occurred relative to the wave, and the migration velocity showed a maximum in resonance with the velocity of the ERK signal wave. The presented mechanical model was further validated in \textit{in vitro} wound healing process.

Title: Recipes for the Digital Quantum Simulation of Lattice Spin Systems
Authors: Guido Burkard
Abstract: We describe methods to construct digital quantum simulation algorithms for quantum spin systems on a regular lattice with local interactions. In addition to tools such as the Trotter-Suzuki expansion and graph coloring, we also discuss the efficiency gained by parallel execution of an extensive number of commuting terms. We provide resource estimates and quantum circuit elements for the most important cases and classes of spin systems. As resource estimates we indicate the total number of gates $N$ and simulation time $T$, expressed in terms of the number $n$ of spin 1/2 lattice sites (qubits), target accuracy $\epsilon$, and simulated time $t$. We provide circuit constructions that realize the simulation time $T^{(1)}\propto nt^2/\epsilon$ and $T^{(2q)}\propto t^{1+\eta}n^\eta/\epsilon^\eta$ for arbitrarily small $\eta=1/2q$ for the first-order and higher-order Trotter expansions. We also discuss the potential impact of scaled gates, which have not yet been fully explored.

Title: Squashed quantum non-Markovianity: a measure of genuine quantum non-Markovianity in states
Authors: Rajeev Gangwar, Tanmoy Pandit, Kaumudibikash Goswami, Siddhartha Das, Manabendra Nath Bera
Abstract: Quantum non-Markovianity in tripartite quantum states $\rho_{ABC}$ represents a correlation between systems $A$ and $C$ when conditioned on the system $B$ and is known to have both classical and quantum contributions. However, a systematic characterization of the latter is missing. To address this, we propose a faithful measure for non-Markovianity of genuine quantum origin called squashed quantum non-Markovianity (sQNM). It is based on the quantum conditional mutual information and is defined by the left-over non-Markovianity after squashing out all non-quantum contributions. It is lower bounded by the squashed entanglement between non-conditioning systems in the reduced state and is delimited by the extendibility of either of the non-conditioning systems. We show that the sQNM is monogamous, asymptotically continuous, convex, additive on tensor-product states, and generally super-additive. We characterize genuine quantum non-Markovianity as a resource via a convex resource theory after identifying free states with vanishing sQNM and free operations that do not increase sQNM in states. We use our resource-theoretic framework to bound the rate of state transformations under free operations and to study state transformation under non-free operations; in particular, we find the quantum communication cost from Bob ($B$) to Alice ($A$) or Charlie ($C$) is lower bounded by the change in sQNM in the states. The sQNM finds operational meaning; in particular, the optimal rate of private communication in a variant of conditional one-time pad protocol is twice the sQNM. Also, the minimum deconstruction cost for a variant of quantum deconstruction protocol is given twice the sQNM of the state.

Title: Optimal coordination of resources: A solution from reinforcement learning
Authors: Guozhong Zheng, Weiran Cai, Guanxiao Qi, Jiqiang Zhang, Li Chen
Abstract: Efficient allocation is important in nature and human society, where individuals frequently compete for limited resources. The Minority Game (MG) is perhaps the simplest toy model to address this issue. However, most previous solutions assume that the strategies are provided a priori and static, failing to capture their adaptive nature. Here, we introduce the reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm to MG, where individuals adjust decisions based on accumulated experience and expected rewards dynamically. We find that this RL framework achieves optimal resource coordination when individuals balance the exploitation of experience with random exploration. Yet, the imbalanced strategies of the two lead to suboptimal partial coordination or even anti-coordination. Our mechanistic analysis reveals a symmetry-breaking in action preferences at the optimum, offering a fresh solution to the MG and new insights into the resource allocation problem.

Title: Potts and random cluster measures on locally regular-tree-like graphs
Authors: Anirban Basak, Amir Dembo, Allan Sly
Abstract: Fixing $\beta \ge 0$ and an integer $q \ge 2$, consider the ferromagnetic $q$-Potts measures $\mu_n^{\beta,B}$ on finite graphs ${\sf G}_n$ on $n$ vertices, with external field strength $B \ge 0$ and the corresponding random cluster measures $\varphi^{q,\beta,B}_{n}$. Suppose that as $n \to \infty$ the uniformly sparse graphs ${\sf G}_n$ converge locally to an infinite $d$-regular tree ${\sf T}_{d}$, $d \ge 3$. We show that the convergence of the Potts free energy density to its Bethe replica symmetric prediction (which has been proved in case $d$ is even, or when $B=0$), yields the local weak convergence of $\varphi^{q,\beta,B}_n$ and $\mu_n^{\beta,B}$ to the corresponding free or wired random cluster measure, Potts measure, respectively, on ${\sf T}_{d}$. The choice of free versus wired limit is according to which has the larger Potts Bethe functional value, with mixtures of these two appearing {as limit points on} the critical line $\beta_c(q,B)$ where these two values of the Bethe functional coincide. For $B=0$ and $\beta>\beta_c$, we further establish a pure-state decomposition by showing that conditionally on the same dominant color $1 \le k \le q$, the $q$-Potts measures on such edge-expander graphs ${\sf G}_n$ converge locally to the $q$-Potts measure on ${\sf T}_{d}$ with a boundary wired at color $k$.

Title: Nanophotonic Super-dephasing in Collective Atom-Atom Interactions
Authors: Wenbo Sun, Adrian E. Rubio López, Zubin Jacob
Abstract: Pure dephasing and spontaneous emission are two non-unitary processes of atoms or spins interacting with fluctuating electromagnetic (EM) modes. The dissipative collective emission processes (e.g., superradiance) originate from interactions with EM modes in resonance with atoms and have received considerable attention. Meanwhile, the analogous non-dissipative collective dephasing phenomena mediated by EM environments remain poorly understood. Here, we introduce the nano-EM super-dephasing phenomenon arising in the photonic environments near materials. We show that collective dephasing in this nano-EM environment is enhanced by over 10 orders of magnitude compared to free space or cavities. This giant enhancement originates from long-range correlations in off-resonant, low-frequency evanescent EM fluctuations, which lead to collectively accelerated (super-) or suppressed (sub-) dephasing in many-body entangled states. We further unravel that nano-EM collective dephasing exhibits universal interaction ranges near materials with different anisotropy that can be reciprocal or non-reciprocal. This nano-EM interaction range, which is not present in free-space and cavities, leads to unique scaling laws of super-dephasing in GHZ states different from the conventional $N^2$ scaling of superradiance. Finally, we discuss how to experimentally isolate and control super-dephasing to open interesting frontiers for scalable quantum systems.

Title: Experimentally Tractable Generation of High-Order Rogue Waves in Bose-Einstein Condensates
Authors: Jimmie Adriazola, Panayotis Kevrekidis
Abstract: In this work, we study a prototypical, experimentally accessible scenario that enables the systematic generation of so-called high-order rogue waves in atomic Bose-Einstein condensates. These waveforms lead to significantly and controllably more extreme focusing events than the famous Peregrine soliton. In one spatial dimension, we showcase conclusive numerical evidence that our scheme generates the focusing behavior associated with the first four rogue waves from the relevant hierarchy. We then extend considerations to anisotropic two-dimensional and even three-dimensional settings, establishing that the scheme can generate second order rogue waves despite the well-known limitation of finite-time blow up of focusing nonlinear Schrödinger equations.

Title: Matrix-product unitaries: Beyond quantum cellular automata
Authors: Georgios Styliaris, Rahul Trivedi, David Pérez-García, J. Ignacio Cirac
Abstract: Matrix-product unitaries (MPU) are 1D tensor networks describing time evolution and unitary symmetries of quantum systems, while their action on states by construction preserves the entanglement area law. MPU which are formed by a single repeated tensor are known to coincide with 1D quantum cellular automata (QCA), i.e., unitaries with an exact light cone. However, this correspondence breaks down for MPU with open boundary conditions, even if the resulting operator is translation-invariant. Such unitaries can turn short- to long-range correlations and thus alter the underlying phase of matter. Here we make the first steps towards a theory of MPU with uniform bulk but arbitrary boundary. In particular, we study the structure of a subclass with a direct-sum form which maximally violates the QCA property. We also consider the general case of MPU formed by site-dependent (nonuniform) tensors and show a correspondence between MPU and locally maximally entanglable states.

Title: Inhomogeneous adiabatic preparation of a quantum critical ground state in two dimensions
Authors: Ihor Sokolov, Francis A. Bayocboc Jr., Marek M. Rams, Jacek Dziarmaga
Abstract: Adiabatic preparation of a critical ground state is hampered by the closing of its energy gap as the system size increases. However, this gap is directly relevant only for a uniform ramp, where a control parameter in the Hamiltonian is tuned uniformly in space towards the quantum critical point. Here, we consider inhomogeneous ramps in two dimensions: initially, the parameter is made critical at the center of a lattice, from where the critical region expands at a fixed velocity. In the 1D and 2D quantum Ising models, which have a well-defined speed of sound at the critical point, the ramp becomes adiabatic with a subsonic velocity. This subsonic ramp can prepare the critical state faster than a uniform one. Moreover, in both a model of $p$-wave paired 2D fermions and the Kitaev model, the critical dispersion is anisotropic -- linear with a nonzero velocity in one direction and quadratic in the other -- but the gap is still inversely proportional to the linear size of the critical region, with a coefficient proportional to the nonzero velocity. This suffices to make the inhomogeneous ramp adiabatic below a finite crossover velocity and superior to the homogeneous one.

Title: On Acceleration of Highest-Energy Cosmic Rays in Novel Scenario of Magnetar Transient
Authors: Jiro Shimoda, Tomoki Wada
Abstract: Transient phenomena in magnetars have been considered as possible acceleration sites of ultrahigh-energy cosmic-rays (CRs), whose energy reaches $\sim200$~EeV known as Amaterasu CR. However, the process of CR acceleration and the trigger mechanism of magnetar transients remains unclear. A recently suggested scenario for the activity predicts that the magnetar's rotation axis suddenly flips due to the `Dzhanibekov effect,' resulting in a sudden rise of the Euler force. The material in the outer layer plastically flows due to the force and finally fractures in this scenario. We study the possibilities of ion acceleration along with this scenario. If the degenerate electrons burst open from the fractured region like a balloon burst, the pair plasma formation can be ignited inside the crust. We find that such pair plasma can emit photons similar to the observed bursts from magnetars. We also find that the electron stream at the beginning of the burst phenomenon possibly induces a strong electric field for a moment, resulting in the acceleration of $\sim1$~ZeV ion within a timescale of $\sim1$~ps. The nuclear spallation reactions limit this timescale, and therefore, high-energy CR `neutrons' from the parenteral nuclei become proper observational predictions of this scenario: their arrival time and direction will be correlated with the bursting photon emissions of the host magnetars. The nuclear spallation of $\sim$~ZeV nuclei is preferred to explain $\gtrsim10$~PeV neutrino events observed by IceCube and KM3Net.

Title: Quantum complexity and generalized area law in fully connected models
Authors: Donghoon Kim, Tomotaka Kuwahara
Abstract: The area law for entanglement entropy fundamentally reflects the complexity of quantum many-body systems, demonstrating ground states of local Hamiltonians to be represented with low computational complexity. While this principle is well-established in one-dimensional systems, little is known beyond 1D cases, and attempts to generalize the area law on infinite-dimensional graphs have largely been disproven. In this work, for non-critical ground states of Hamiltonians on fully connected graphs, we establish a generalized area law up to a polylogarithmic factor in system size, by effectively reducing the boundary area to a constant scale for interactions between subsystems. This result implies an efficient approximation of the ground state by the matrix product state up to an approximation error of $1/\text{poly}(n)$. As the core technique, we develop the mean-field renormalization group approach, which rigorously guarantees efficiency by systematically grouping regions of the system and iteratively approximating each as a product state. This approach provides a rigorous pathway to efficiently simulate ground states of complex systems, advancing our understanding of infinite-dimensional quantum many-body systems and their entanglement structures.

Title: Anomalous propagators and the particle-particle channel: Bethe-Salpeter equation
Authors: Antoine Marie, Pina Romaniello, Xavier Blase, Pierre-François Loos
Abstract: The Bethe-Salpeter equation has been extensively employed to compute the two-body electron-hole propagator and its poles which correspond to the neutral excitation energies of the system. Through a different time-ordering, the two-body Green's function can also describe the propagation of two electrons or two holes. The corresponding poles are the double ionization potentials and double electron affinities of the system. In this work, a Bethe-Salpeter equation for the two-body particle-particle propagator is derived within the linear-response formalism using a pairing field and anomalous propagators. This framework allows us to compute kernels corresponding to different self-energy approximations ($GW$, $T$-matrix, and second-Born) as in the usual electron-hole case. The performance of these various kernels is gauged for singlet and triplet valence double ionization potentials using a set of 23 small molecules. The description of double core hole states is also analyzed.

Title: Analytic 3D vector non-uniform Fourier crystal optics in arbitrary $\bar{\bar{\varepsilon}}$ dielectric
Authors: Chenzhu Xie, Yong Zhang
Abstract: To find a suitable incubator for nonlinear crystal optics(NCO), we have revisited linear crystal optics(LCO). At the methodological level, three widely used plane wave bases are compared in terms of eigenanalysis in reciprocal space and light field propagation in real space. Inspired by complex ray tracing, we expand M.V. Berry's 2003 uniform plane wave model to non-uniform Fourier crystal optics(FCO) and ultimately derive the explicit form of its 3$\times$2 transition matrix, bridging the two major branches of crystal optics(CO) in reciprocal space, where either ray direction $\hat{k}$ or spatial frequency $\bar{k}_{\mathrm{\rho}}$ serves as the input variable. Using this model, we create the material-matrix tetrahedral compass(M-M TC) to conduct a detailed analysis of how the four fundamental characteristics of materials (linear/circular birefringence/dichroism) influence the eigensystems of the vector electric field in two-dimensional(2D) spatial frequency $\bar{k}_{\mathrm{\rho}}$ domain and its distribution in three-dimensional(3D) $\bar{r}$ space with a crystal-2f system. Along this journey, we have uncovered new territories in LCO in both real and reciprocal space, such as infinite singularities arranged in disk-, ring-, and crescent-like shapes, ``L shorelines'' resembling hearts, generalized haunting theorem, double conical refraction, and optical knots it induces. We also present our model's early applications in focal engineering and NCO.

Title: Evolved Quantum Boltzmann Machines
Authors: Michele Minervini, Dhrumil Patel, Mark M. Wilde
Abstract: We introduce evolved quantum Boltzmann machines as a variational ansatz for quantum optimization and learning tasks. Given two parameterized Hamiltonians $G(\theta)$ and $H(\phi)$, an evolved quantum Boltzmann machine consists of preparing a thermal state of the first Hamiltonian $G(\theta)$ followed by unitary evolution according to the second Hamiltonian $H(\phi)$. Alternatively, one can think of it as first realizing imaginary time evolution according to $G(\theta)$ followed by real time evolution according to $H(\phi)$. After defining this ansatz, we provide analytical expressions for the gradient vector and illustrate their application in ground-state energy estimation and generative modeling, showing how the gradient for these tasks can be estimated by means of quantum algorithms that involve classical sampling, Hamiltonian simulation, and the Hadamard test. We also establish analytical expressions for the Fisher-Bures, Wigner-Yanase, and Kubo-Mori information matrix elements of evolved quantum Boltzmann machines, as well as quantum algorithms for estimating each of them, which leads to at least three different general natural gradient descent algorithms based on this ansatz. Along the way, we establish a broad generalization of the main result of [Luo, Proc. Am. Math. Soc. 132, 885 (2004)], proving that the Fisher-Bures and Wigner-Yanase information matrices of general parameterized families of states differ by no more than a factor of two in the matrix (Loewner) order, making them essentially interchangeable for training when using natural gradient descent.

Title: Analog Quantum Teleportation
Authors: Uesli Alushi, Simone Felicetti, Roberto Di Candia
Abstract: Digital teleportation protocols make use of entanglement, local measurements and a classical communication channel to transfer quantum states between remote parties. We consider analog teleportation protocols, where classical communication is replaced by transmission through a noisy quantum channel. We show that analog teleportation protocols outperform digital protocols if and only if Alice and Bob are linked by a channel that does not reduce entanglement when applied to a part of the resource state. We first derive general analytical results in the broader context of Gaussian-channel simulation. Then, we apply it to the quantum teleportation of a uniformly distributed codebook of coherent states, showing that an analog protocol is optimal for a wide range of communication channel transmissivities. Our result contributes to mitigating noise in the intermediate case when the communication channel is far from being ideal but is not too lossy, as is the case of cryogenic links in microwave superconducting circuits.
