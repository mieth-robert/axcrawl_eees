Title: Advancing Antiferromagnetic Nitrides via Metal Alloy Nitridation
Authors: Qianying Wang, Zexu He, Lele Zhang, Qian Li, Haitao Hong, Ting Cui, Dongke Rong, Songhee Choi, Qiao Jin, Chen Ge, Can Wang, Qinghua Zhang, Liang Cheng, Jingbo Qi, Kui-juan Jin, Gang-Qin Liu, Er-Jia Guo
Abstract: Nitride materials, valued for their structural stability and exceptional physical properties, have garnered significant interest in both fundamental research and technological applications. The fabrication of high-quality nitride thin films is essential for advancing their use in microelectronics and spintronics. Yet, achieving single-crystal nitride thin films with excellent structural integrity remains a challenge. Here, we introduce a straightforward yet innovative metallic alloy nitridation technique for the synthesis of stable single-crystal nitride thin films. By subjecting metal alloy thin films to a controlled nitridation process, nitrogen atoms integrate into the lattice, driving structural transformations while preserving high epitaxial quality. Combining nanoscale magnetic imaging with a diamond nitrogen-vacancy (NV) probe, X-ray magnetic linear dichroism, and comprehensive transport measurements, we confirm that the nitridated films exhibit a robust antiferromagnetic character with a zero net magnetic moment. This work not only provides a refined and reproducible strategy for the fabrication of nitride thin films but also lays a robust foundation for exploring their burgeoning device applications.

Title: Quantum critical scaling of altermagnetism
Authors: Sondre Duna Lundemo, Flavio S. Nogueira, Asle Sudbø
Abstract: The term altermagnetism has recently been introduced to describe the Néel order of a class of materials whose magnetic sublattices are neither related by translation nor inversion. While these materials arguably have large technological potential, little effort has been devoted to studying the universal distinction of this phase of matter compared to collinear antiferromagnetism. Employing a recently proposed minimal microscopic model, we explicitly derive a nonlinear sigma model describing long-wavelength fluctuations of the staggered magnetization in this system, including quantum effects to leading order. The term that distinguishes the altermagnetic nonlinear sigma model from its antiferromagnetic counterpart is an interaction term that derives directly from the Berry phase of the microscopic spin degrees of freedom. Its effects on the one-loop renormalization group flow in $d=2+\epsilon$ dimensions are examined. Extending the theory to describe the fermionic excitations of the metallic altermagnet, we find an effective low-energy model of $d$-wave spin-split Dirac fermions interacting with the magnetic fluctuations. Using a Dyson-Schwinger approach, we derive the many-body effects on the dynamical critical scaling due to the competition between the long-range Coulomb interaction and the fluctuations of the staggered magnetization.

Title: Parity anomaly from LSM: exact valley symmetries on the lattice
Authors: Salvatore D. Pace, Minho Luke Kim, Arkya Chatterjee, Shu-Heng Shao
Abstract: We show that the honeycomb tight-binding model hosts an exact microscopic avatar of its low-energy SU(2) valley symmetry and parity anomaly. Specifically, the SU(2) valley symmetry arises from a collection of conserved, integer-quantized charge operators that obey the Onsager algebra. Along with lattice reflection and time-reversal symmetries, this Onsager symmetry has a Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) anomaly that matches the parity anomaly in the IR. Indeed, we show that any local Hamiltonian commuting with these symmetries cannot have a trivial unique gapped ground state. We study the phase diagram of the simplest symmetric model and survey various deformations, including Haldane's mass term, which preserves only the Onsager symmetry. Our results place the parity anomaly in 2+1D alongside Schwinger's anomaly in 1+1D and Witten's SU(2) anomaly in 3+1D as 't Hooft anomalies that can arise from the Onsager symmetry on the lattice.

Title: Electromagnetic response and emergent topological orders in transition metal dichalcogenide MoTe$_2$ bilayers
Authors: Tianhong Lu, Yi-Ming Wu, Luiz H. Santos
Abstract: Twisted bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides, such as MoTe$_2$, provide a versatile platform for exploring correlated topological phases. This work investigates the interplay of perpendicular magnetic and electric fields in tuning the electronic structure and emergent topological orders of twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ (t-MoTe$_2$) across two distinct regimes: a low-twist-angle phase ($\theta\approx2.1^\circ$) hosting multiple Chern bands of identical Chern numbers per valley, and a higher-angle phase ($\theta\approx 3.89^\circ$) featuring Haldane-like bands with opposite Chern numbers. Using a continuum model incorporating moiré potentials up to second harmonics, we compute the Hofstadter fractal spectra under applied fields, revealing Landau fan structures and magnetic-flux-dependent band topology. These fractal spectra are useful in studying emergent topological orders in terms of the composite fermion picture, where the statistical Chern-Simons flux is approximated as a uniform gauge field. We demonstrate that the system hosts both Jain-sequence fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) and non-Jain "fractal FCIs" with higher Chern numbers. The electric field suppresses composite fermion gaps and induces topological quantum phase transitions. Furthermore, our analysis extends to valley-contrasting flux attachment, proposing pathways to describe fractional quantum spin Hall states.

Title: Disorder-Free Localization and Fragmentation in a Non-Abelian Lattice Gauge Theory
Authors: Giovanni Cataldi, Giuseppe Calajó, Pietro Silvi, Simone Montangero, Jad C. Halimeh
Abstract: We investigate how isolated quantum many-body systems equilibrate when quenched far from equilibrium under non-Abelian gauge-symmetry constraints. By encoding gauge superselection sectors into static $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ background charges, we map out the dynamical phase diagram of a $1+1D$ $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ lattice gauge theory with dynamical matter. We uncover three distinct regimes: (i) an ergodic phase, (ii) a fragmented phase that is nonthermal but delocalized, and (iii) a disorder-free many-body localized regime. In the latter, a superposition of superselection sectors retains spatial matter inhomogeneities in time, as confirmed by distinctive temporal scalings of entropy. We highlight the non-Abelian nature of these phases and argue for potential realizations on qudit processors.

Title: Beyond fixed-size skyrmions in nanodots: switchable multistability with ferromagnetic ring
Authors: Mateusz Zelent, Maciej Krawczyk, Konstantin Y. Guslienko
Abstract: We demonstrate a novel approach to control and stabilize magnetic skyrmions in ultrathin multilayer nanostructures through spatially engineered magnetostatic fields generated by ferromagnetic nanorings. Using analytical modeling and micromagnetic simulations, we show that the stray fields from a Co/Pd ferromagnetic ring with out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy significantly enhance Néel-type skyrmion stability in an Ir/Co/Pt nanodot, even without Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. Most notably, we observe a multistability phenomenon, where skyrmions can be stabilized at two or more distinct equilibrium diameters depending on the ring's magnetization orientation. These stable states exhibit energy barriers substantially exceeding thermal fluctuations at room temperature, suggesting practical applications for robust multibit memory storage. By tuning geometric parameters of the ferromagnetic ring, we demonstrate precise control over skyrmion size and stability, opening pathways for advanced spintronic nanodevices.

Title: Dissipation meets conformal interface: How the relaxation rate is suppressed
Authors: Ruhanshi Barad, Qicheng Tang, Xueda Wen
Abstract: Conformal interfaces play an important role in quantum critical systems. In closed systems, the transmission properties of conformal interfaces are typically characterized by two quantities: One is the effective central charge $c_{\text{eff}}$, which measures the amount of quantum entanglement through the interface, and the other is the transmission coefficient $c_{\text{LR}}$, which measures the energy transmission through the interface. In the present work, to characterize the transmission property of conformal interfaces in open quantum systems, we propose a third quantity $c_{\text{relax}}$, which is defined through the ratio of Liouvillian gaps with and without an interface. Physically, $c_{\text{relax}}$ measures the suppression of the relaxation rate towards a steady state when the system is subject to a local dissipation. We perform both analytical perturbation calculations and exact numerical calculations based on a free fermion chain at the critical point. It is found that $c_{\text{relax}}$ decreases monotonically with the strength of the interface. In particular, $0\le c_{\text{relax}}\le c_{\text{LR}}\le c_{\text{eff}}$, where the equalities hold if and only if the interface is totally reflective or totally transmissive. Our result for $c_{\text{relax}}$ is universal in the sense that $c_{\text{relax}}$ is independent of (i) the dissipation strength in the weak dissipation regime and (ii) the location where the local dissipation is introduced. Comparing to the previously known $c_{\text{LR}}$ and $c_{\text{eff}}$ in a closed system, our $c_{\text{relax}}$ shows a distinct behavior as a function of the interface strength, suggesting its novelty to characterize conformal interfaces in open systems and offering insights into critical systems under dissipation.

Title: Quantum geometry and magnon Hall transport in an altermagnet
Authors: Erlend Syljuåsen, Alireza Qaiumzadeh, Asle Sudbø
Abstract: We compute magnon Hall conductivities in a minimal model of a two-dimensional altermagnet. To do so, we derive an analytic expression for the relevant quantum geometric tensor describing two-band bosonic Bogoliubov Hamiltonians, providing insight into the geometric, topological, and transport properties. The magnon thermal Hall and spin Nernst conductivities are shown to directly depend on the altermagnetic parameter, which may serve as an experimental probe of altermagnetism.

Title: Coexistence of superconductivity and topological band in a van der Waals Sn1-xInxBi2Te4 crystal
Authors: Hoyeon Jeon, Saban Hus, Jewook Park, Qiangsheng Lu, Seoung-Hun Kang, Mina Yoon, Robert G. Moore, Jiaqiang Yan, Michael A. McGuire, An-Ping Li
Abstract: The realization of topological surface states and superconductivity within a single material platform is a crucial step toward achieving topologically nontrivial superconductivity. This can be achieved at an interface between a superconductor and a topological insulator, or within a single material that intrinsically hosts both superconductivity and topological surface states. Here we use scanning tunneling microscopy to study Sn1-xInxBi2Te4 crystals. Spectroscopic evidence reveals the coexistence of topological surface states and superconductivity on the same surface of the crystals. The Te-terminated surface exhibits a single U-shaped superconducting gap with a size of up to 311 {\mu}eV, alongside Dirac bands outside the gap. Analysis of the vortex structure and differential conductance suggests weak-coupling s-wave superconductivity. The absence of observed zero modes suggests that shifting the Fermi level closer to the Dirac point of the topological bands is necessary to realize a topological superconducting state.

Title: Dehybridization transition in Kondo insulators and heavy fermions
Authors: Mucio A. Continentino
Abstract: In strongly correlated multi-band systems, like inter-metallics, heavy fermions or Kondo insulators, electron-electron and electron-phonon scattering of the electrons in the bands give rise, at finite temperatures, to a damping of these quasi-particles. This is responsible for producing an effective dehybridization between the electrons in the large conduction bands and those in the narrow, correlated band. This dehybridization effect has been used to explain the transport properties of inter-metallics and ARPES experiments in heavy fermions at sufficiently high temperatures. A new insight into this problem has been recently proposed using the theory of non-Hermitian systems. In this note, we review previous work on dehybridization in Kondo insulators and strongly correlated metals within this new perspective. For this purpose, we use a parametrization of the self-energy of the strongly correlated electrons obtained from LDA+DMFT calculations. We discuss the nature of the dehybridization transition and its consequences in the electronic spectrum and transport properties.

Title: $Δ$SCF in \texttt{VASP} for excited-state defect computations: tips and pitfalls
Authors: Yihuang Xiong, Geoffroy Hautier
Abstract: $\Delta$SCF with constrained occupations have been wildly used to investigate the excited-state and optical properties of defects. Recent studies have demonstrated that combining $\Delta$SCF with hybrid functionals yields good accuracy in predicting defect properties. The Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (\texttt{VASP}) is one of the most widely used quantum mechanical packages based on plane-wave methods. Despite the increasing application of $\Delta$SCF as implemented in \texttt{VASP} for defect studies, detailed walkthroughs explaining how to conduct these calculations remain limited, making this approach a nontrivial task. Applying $\Delta$SCF with hybrid functionals can present convergence challenges; worse, it may sometimes converge to incorrect excited states and can go largely unnoticed. This document aims to serve as a concise guide outlining what we think might be the appropriate approach for performing $\Delta$SCF calculations in \texttt{VASP}. We benchmark this method by simulating excited states for a particularly challenging system: the neutral charge state of the silicon vacancy (SiV$^0$) defect in diamond. By highlighting potential pitfalls, we hope this document encourages further discussion within the community and assists researchers experiencing difficulties with this technique. The guidelines provided here are largely based on private discussions with Oscar Bulancea Lindvall from Link{ö}ping University and Chris Ciccarino from Stanford University.

Title: Pump-induced magnon anticrossing due to three-magnon splitting and confluence
Authors: Tao Qu, Yuzan Xiong, Xufeng Zhang, Yi Li, Wei Zhang
Abstract: We present a plausible mechanism for achieving magnon-magnon level repulsion spectrum originating from the oscillation between the splitting and confluence in a three-magnon scattering process. When a magnetostatic mode on a YIG sphere is pumped by a microwave signal near the magnon resonance frequency with an increasing amplitude, the generated magnon condensate at half of the pumping frequency exerts a back-action to the original magnon mode. Such a strong nonlinear coupling manifests a striking feature of a 'bending effect' of the magnetostatic mode spectra, akin to the anti-crossing observed in a strongly coupled magnon-photon system.

Title: Theoretically proposed controlled creation of Bloch-type skyrmions with spin-orbit torque in a chiral-ferromagnet/heavy-metal heterojunction
Authors: Yuto Uwabo, Masahito Mochizuki
Abstract: The creation and manipulation of magnetic skyrmions in magnetic bilayer heterostructures via spin-orbit torque have been intensively studied in spintronics because of their potential application as information carriers in next-generation magnetic memory devices. However, experimental attempts have not always been successful. In this paper, we theoretically elucidate the underlying reasons for these difficulties and propose a practical method to overcome them by employing magnetic bilayer heterostructures that incorporate a chiral ferromagnetic layer hosting Bloch-type skyrmions instead of the conventional ferromagnetic layer that hosts Néel-type skyrmions. Our micromagnetic simulations demonstrate that Bloch-type skyrmions can be controllably created in this system via spin-orbit torque exerted by a perpendicular spin current. This finding provides a promising platform and method for realizing skyrmion-based spintronic devices.

Title: HOP-graphene: A high-capacity anode for Li/Na-ion batteries unveiled by first-principles calculations
Authors: Nicolas F. Martins, José A. S. Laranjeira, Kleuton A. L. Lima, Luis A. Cabral, L.A. Ribeiro Junior, Julio R. Sambrano
Abstract: The growing demand for efficient energy storage has driven the search for advanced anode materials for lithium- and sodium-ion batteries (LIBs and SIBs). In this context, we report the application of HOP-graphene (a 5-6-8-membered 2D carbon framework) as a high-performance anode material for LIBs and SIBs using density functional theory simulations. Diffusion studies reveal low energy barriers of 0.70 eV for Li and 0.39 eV for Na, indicating superior mobility at room temperature compared to other carbon allotropes, like graphite. Full lithiation and sodiation accommodate 24 Li and 22 Na atoms, respectively, delivering outstanding theoretical capacities of 1338 mAh/g (Li) and 1227 mAh/g (Na). Bader charge analysis and charge density difference maps confirm substantial electron transfer from the alkali metals to the substrate. Average open-circuit voltages of 0.42 V (Li) and 0.33 V (Na) suggest favorable electrochemical performance. HOP-graphene also demonstrates excellent mechanical strength. These findings position HOP-graphene as a promising candidate for next-generation LIB and SIB anodes.

Title: Athos-Graphene: Computational Discovery of an Art-Inspired 2D Carbon Anode for Lithium-Ion Batteries
Authors: Kleuton A. L. Lima, José A. S. Laranjeira, Nicolas F. Martins, Julio R. Sambrano, Alexandre C. Diasc, Douglas S. Galvão, Luiz A. Ribeiro Junior
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) carbon allotropes have attracted growing interest for their structural versatility and potential in energy storage and nanoelectronics. We propose Athos-Graphene (AG), a novel 2D carbon allotrope inspired by the geometric patterns of Brazilian artist Athos Bulcão. Designed using density functional theory, AG features a periodic structure with high thermodynamic and thermal stability, as evidenced by a low cohesive energy of -7.96 eV/atom, the absence of imaginary phonon modes, and robust performance in ab initio molecular dynamics simulations up to 1000 K. It exhibits anisotropic mechanical properties, with Young's modulus values of 585 GPa and 600 GPa along the x- and y-directions, and Poisson's ratios of 0.19 and 0.17, respectively. Electronic structure analyses confirm its metallic behavior, while optical studies reveal anisotropic absorption in the visible and UV regions. For lithium-ion storage, Athos-Graphene shows strong Li adsorption (-2.3 to -1.0 eV), a high theoretical capacity of 836.78 mAh/g, and a low average open-circuit voltage of 0.54 V. Lithium diffusion barriers are as low as 0.3 eV on the surface and 0.66 eV between layers, with a high diffusion coefficient greater than 6x10^-6 cm^2/s. These features highlight AG as a promising anode material for high-performance lithium-ion batteries.

Title: Theoretical perspectives on optical control of magnetism in spin-charge coupled systems
Authors: Masahito Mochizuki
Abstract: In this article, we review recent theoretical research on photocontrol of magnetism in several spin-charge coupled systems. The control of magnetism with light has been a central issue in condensed-matter physics, attracting enormous research interest both for fundamental science and for technological applications. This field of research has developed rapidly in recent years along with the development of laser technology. However, because the direct coupling between the light magnetic field and magnetization via the Zeeman coupling is very weak in terms of the energy scale, it is, in principle, difficult to induce dramatic effects as far as this magnetic light-matter interaction is exploited. On the contrary, the interaction between the light electric field and electron charges has an energy scale two to three orders of magnitude larger than that of the magnetic interaction. Therefore, we may realize astonishing photoinduced physical phenomena and novel optical device functions by exploiting this electric light-matter interaction. Spin-charge coupled magnets, e.g., double-exchange magnets, multiferroics materials, and Rashba electron systems, in which spins and charges are strongly coupled through several kinds of mechanisms such as exchange interactions and spin-orbit coupling, are ideal systems for realizing this idea. Recent theoretical studies have revealed that it is possible to control, manipulate and switch the magnetization coupled to electron charges in these systems through exciting and/or driving them with light electric fields. The following three recent topics are discussed as examples of such theoretical studies, that is, photoinduced magnetic phase transitions in irradiated double-exchange models, highly efficient photoinduction of spin polarization in Rashba electron systems, and electromagnon excitations and their intense excitation effects in multiferroic materials.

Title: Proposed controlled creation and manipulation of skyrmions with spin-orbit torque
Authors: Yuto Uwabo, Ryo Fujimoto, Kimimaro Yanai, Masahito Mochizuki
Abstract: The physical mechanisms underlying current-driven skyrmion motion include the spin-transfer torque exerted by a spin-polarized horizontal electric current and the spin-orbit torque exerted by a perpendicular spin current. Each mechanism requires a specific sample geometry and structural configuration. Regarding current-induced skyrmion creation, skyrmions can be efficiently created at low current densities via spin-transfer torque when an electric current is applied to a nanotrack structure with a small notch. However, an effective and controlled method for skyrmion creation via spin-orbit torque in notched nanotracks has yet to be established. Here we theoretically propose a method for the creation, driving, and deletion of skyrmions in a three-terminal magnetic heterojunction with a notch. Our proposal offers valuable insights into the design of techniques for skyrmion creation and manipulation using spin-orbit torque, which is essential for technical applications of magnetic skyrmions as information carriers in next-generation spintronic memory devices.

Title: Systematic construction of asymptotic quantum many-body scar states and their relation to supersymmetric quantum mechanics
Authors: Masaya Kunimi, Yusuke Kato, Hosho Katsura
Abstract: We develop a systematic method for constructing asymptotic quantum many-body scar (AQMBS) states. While AQMBS states are closely related to quantum many-body scar (QMBS) states, they exhibit key differences. Unlike QMBS states, AQMBS states are not energy eigenstates of the Hamiltonian, making their construction more challenging. We demonstrate that, under appropriate conditions, AQMBS states can be obtained as low-lying gapless excited states of a parent Hamiltonian, which has a QMBS state as its ground state. Furthermore, our formalism reveals a connection between QMBS and supersymmetric (SUSY) quantum mechanics. The QMBS state can be interpreted as a SUSY-unbroken ground state.

Title: A versatile setup for symmetry-resolved ultrafast dynamics of quantum materials
Authors: Khalid M. Siddiqui, Hanna Strojecka, Thomas H. Meyland, Nitesh Khatiwada, Nikolaj Klinkby, Daniel Perez-Salinas, Simon E. Wall
Abstract: Correlated phenomena occur in quantum materials because of the delicate interplay between internal degrees of freedom, leading to multiple symmetry-broken quantum phases. Resolving the structure of these phases is a key challenge, often requiring facilities equipped with x-ray free-electron lasers and electron sources that may not be readily accessible to the average user. Table-top sources that offer alternative means are therefore needed. In this work, we present an all-optical, table-top setup that enables symmetry-resolved studies using linear and nonlinear spectroscopies. We demonstrate the versatility of the setup with chosen examples that underscore the importance of tracking symmetries and showcase the strengths of the setup, which offers a large tunable parameter space.

Title: Accurate Prediction of Sequential Tensor Properties Using Equivariant Graph Neural Network
Authors: Ting-Wei Hsu, Zhenyao Fang, Arun Bansil, Qimin Yan
Abstract: Optical spectra serve as a powerful tool for probing the interactions between materials and light, unveiling complex electronic structures such as flat bands and nontrivial topological features. These insights are crucial for the development and optimization of photonic devices, including solar cells, light-emitting diodes, and photodetectors, where understanding the electronic structure directly impacts device performance. Moreover, in anisotropic bulk materials, the optical responses are direction-dependent, and predicting those response tensors still remains computationally demanding due to its inherent complexity and the constraint from crystal symmetry. To address this challenge, we introduce the sequential tensorial properties equivariant neural network (StepENN), a graph neural network architecture that maps crystal structures directly to their full optical tensors across different photon frequencies. By encoding the isotropic sequential scalar components and anisotropic sequential tensor components into l=0 and l=2 spherical tensor components, StepENN ensures symmetry-aware sequential tensor predictions that are consistent with the inherent symmetry constraints of crystal systems. Trained on a dataset of frequency-dependent permittivity tensors for 1,432 bulk semiconductors computed from first-principles methods, our model achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 24.216 millifarads per meter (mF/m) on the predicted tensorial spectra with 85.7% of its predictions exhibiting less than 10% relative error, demonstrating its potential for deriving other spectrum-related properties, such as optical conductivity. This framework opens new avenues for the data-driven design of materials with engineered anisotropic optical responses, accelerating material advances in optoelectronic applications.

Title: Improvement of spontaneous orientation polarization by multiple introductions of fluoroalkyl groups
Authors: Masaki Tanaka, Rena Sugimoto, Nobuhumi Nakamura
Abstract: Spontaneous orientation polarization (SOP) of polar molecules is formed in vacuum-deposited films. SOP is driven by asymmetric intermolecular interactions; however, the design of polar molecules for the improvement of dipole orientation is limited. In this study, we developed SOP molecules with high structural asymmetry by introducing multiple fluoroalkyl groups into a polar molecule. The developed polar molecules exhibited high dipole orientation degrees in vacuum-deposited films and achieved a high surface potential growth rate relative to the film thickness, over -350 mV nm-1, which is a record high for the reported compounds. The developed dipolar films can be used to generate rectification properties for the charge transport of organic films. The findings of this study provide methodologies for the formation of highly anisotropic glassy films, leading to improved performance of organic devices.

Title: Topological phase transition to a hidden charge density wave liquid
Authors: Joshua S.H. Lee, Thomas M. Sutter, Goran Karapetrov, Pietro Musumeci, Anshul Kogar
Abstract: Charge density waves (CDWs), electronic crystals that form within a host solid, have long been speculated to melt into a spatially textured electronic liquid. Though they have not been previously detected, liquid CDWs may nonetheless be fundamental to the phase diagrams of many correlated electron systems, including high temperature superconductors and quantum Hall states. In one of the most promising candidate materials capable of hosting a liquid CDW, 1T-TaS2, a structural phase transition impedes its observation. Here, by irradiating the material with a femtosecond light pulse, we circumvent the structural phase transition to reveal how topological defect dynamics govern the otherwise invisible CDW correlations. Upon photoexcitation, the CDW diffraction peaks broaden azimuthally, initially revealing a hexatic state. At higher temperatures, photoexcitation completely destroys translational and orientational order and only a ring of diffuse scattering is observed, a key signature of a liquid CDW. Our work provides compelling evidence for a defect-unbinding transition to a CDW liquid and presents a protocol for uncovering states that are hidden by other transitions in thermal equilibrium.

Title: Ground-states of the Shastry-Sutherland Lattice Materials Gd$_2$Be$_2$GeO$_7$ and Dy$_2$Be$_2$GeO$_7$
Authors: M. Pula, S. Sharma, J. Gautreau, Sajilesh K. P., A. Kanigel, G. M. Luke
Abstract: The recent realization that the rare-earth melilites RE$_2$Be$_2$GeO$_7$ host the Shastry-Sutherland lattice within planes of RE$^{3+}$ ions has sparked a number of studies. This family of materials lacks appreciable site mixing and conductivity, making them promising candidates for the Shastry-Sutherland model. Herein, we present the magnetic ground states of two of these rare-earth melilites: RE = Gd and Dy. We find, through measurements of magnetic susceptibility, magnetization, and specific heat capacity (RE = Dy only), that these two melilites are antiferromagnets (T$_N$ $\sim$~1~K). Gd$_2$Be$_2$GeO$_7$, in accordance with its electronic configuration, has isotropic single-ion anisotropy but shows a quadratic contribution to its magnetization. Dy$_2$Be$_2$GeO$_7$ has Ising-like single-ion ansiotropy and is likely an effective spin-$1/2$ system. Both materials exhibit metamagnetic transitions. We identify this transition in Dy$_2$Be$_2$GeO$_7$, occurring at 86(1)~mT for T=500~mK, to likely be a spin-flip transition.

Title: Giant Tunneling Magnetoresistance in Graphene/$h$-BN Based van der Waals Magnetic Tunnel Junctions via 3$d$ Transition Metal Intercalation
Authors: Zhi Yan, Jianhua Xiao, Xujin Zhang, Cheng Fang, Xiaohong Xu
Abstract: Atomic intercalation offers a powerful route for engineering two-dimensional (2D) materials by precisely tuning interlayer electronic coupling and spin configurations. Here, we propose a generic strategy for the construction of fully 2D magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) based on transition metal-intercalated graphene electrodes with $h$-BN barrier layer. First-principles calculations reveal that intercalation not only stabilizes uniform atomic dispersion via steric hindrance but also induces robust ferromagnetism in graphene. Manganese- and vanadium-intercalated systems (Mn-Gr and V-Gr) exhibit exceptional spintronic performance, with tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) showing a pronounced odd-even oscillation as a function of barrier thickness. A giant TMR of $4.35 \times 10^8\,\%$ is achieved in the Mn-Gr system with a monolayer barrier $h$ -BN ($n=1$), while V-Gr reaches a maximum TMR of $1.86 \times 10^5\,\%$ for a trilayer barrier ($n=3$). Moreover, biaxial strain further enhances the TMR to $10^9\,\%$ and $10^7\,\%$ in Mn-Gr and V-Gr systems, respectively. The devices also exhibit perfect spin filtering and pronounced negative differential resistance, offering new opportunities for high-performance spintronic and memory applications based on 2D van der Waals heterostructures.

Title: The spatial correlation of radiation-induced errors in superconducting devices decays over a millimeter
Authors: Francesco Valenti, Anil Murani, Patrick Paluch, Robert Gartmann, Lukas Scheller, Richard Gebauer, Robert Kruk, Thomas Reisinger, Luis Ardila-Perez, Ioan M. Pop
Abstract: We perform nanosecond-resolution multiplexed readout on six same-chip superconducting microwave resonators. This allows us to pinpoint the impact positions of ionizing radiation on the chip by measuring the differential time of flight of the generated phonons, inducing correlated errors in the device, thereby implementing an on-chip seismic array. We correlate the phase response of each resonator - a proxy for the absorbed energy - to the distance from the impact point to uncover a millimetric decay length for the phonon-mediated radiation poisoning.

Title: Tailoring composite skyrmionic spin textures in an above-room-temperature ferromagnet Fe3-xGaTe2
Authors: Songyang Li, Jianfeng Guo, Zizhao Gong, Guojing Hu, Shuo Mi, Chang Li, Yanyan Geng, Manyu Wang, Shumin Meng, Shiyu Zhu, Fei Pang, Wei Ji, Rui Xu, Haitao Yang, Zhihai Cheng
Abstract: Realizing room-temperature tunable skyrmionic objects in van der Waals ferromagnet offers unparalleled prospects for future spintronics. Here, we report an experimental investigation on the emergence and evolution of skyrmionic spin textures in the non-stoichiometric Fe3-xGaTe2 using magnetic force microscopy. The iron-deficiency-specific magnetic states of stripe, striped skyrmionium and striped skyrmion sack are observed. Through zero-field-cooling and field-cooling measurements, we observed distinct topological transitions and trivial transitions (distinguished by changes in topological charge) emerging during the stepwise evolution of topological spin textures, which enabled us to develop an evolution pathway model. Leveraging this model, the room-temperature stable composite topological spin textures of skyrmionium, skyrmion bag and sack states are further controllably realized via the exclusive topological-transition path (regulated by magnetic field and DMI intensity). Our work provides valuable insights into the room-temperature realization of topological spin textures in Fe3-xGaTe2, and inspires further exploration of their potential applications in heterostructure spintronics.

Title: Superconductivity in Spin-Orbit coupled SU(8) Dirac Fermions on Honeycomb lattice
Authors: Ankush Chaubey, Basudeb Mondal, Vijay B. Shenoy, Subhro Bhattacharjee
Abstract: We study superconducting (SC) phases that are naturally proximate to a spin-orbit coupled SU(8) Dirac semi-metal on a honeycomb lattice. This system, which offers enhanced low-energy symmetries, presents an interesting platform for realizing unconventional superconductivity in j=3/2 electrons. In particular, we find 72 superconducting charge-$2e$ fermion bilinears which, under classification of microscopic symmetries, lead to 12 different SCs -- four singlets, two doublets, and six triplets -- 7 of them are gapped and 5 are symmetry-protected nodal SCs. The strong spin-orbit coupling leads to locking of the spin of the Cooper pairs with real-space direction -- as is evident from the structure of the Cooper pair wave-functions -- leading to unusual non-unitary superconductors (even singlets), and with finite momentum pairing (for the triplets). This results, in many cases, in the magnitude of multiple pairing gaps being intricately dependent on the direction of the SC order-parameter. The present classification of SCs along with normal phases (Phys. Rev. B 108, 245106 (2023)) provides the complete list of naturally occurring phases in the vicinity of such a SU(8) Dirac semi-metal. This study allows for understanding the global phase diagram of such systems, stimulating further experimental work on candidate materials such as metallic halides (MX$_3$ with M=Zr, Hf, and X=Cl, Br). Further, it provides the starting point for the exploration of unconventional phase transitions in such systems.

Abstract: The crystal field (CF) excitations of Kramers (Nd$^{3+}$, Er$^{3+}$, and Yb$^{3+}$) and non-Kramers (Pr$^{3+}$ and Ho$^{3+}$) rare earth ions in rare earth orthoferrites REFeO$_{3}$ were systematically studied by simulations. The optimised CF models were used to study the internal and external field impacts to the CF excitation peaks of these Kramers and non-Kramers ions. The Kramers ions excitations consist of doublets due to the Kramers degeneracy theorem while the non-Kramers ions excitations are non-degenerated singlets. The ground-state doublets of all Kramers ions undergo peak splitting and generate low energy excitation peaks ~ 1 meV under the internal magnetic fields from the Fe$^{3+}$ and RE$^{3+}$ sublattices. The ground-states of non-Kramers ions may form pseudo doublets due to the accidental degeneracy of two singlet states, as the case of Ho$^{3+}$ in HoFeO$_3$. Such pseudo-doublet ground states can split and produce low energy excitations just like the Kramers ions. However, singlet ground states of non-Kramers ions without accidental degeneracy, like Pr$^{3+}$, has no ground state excitation and splitting at zero fields. A ground-state singlet excitation shows up under non-zero magnetic fields due to the symmetry breaking induced by the magnetic fields. The internal/external magnetic field effects on CF excitations in REFeO$_3$ demonstrate strong anisotropies. The local symmetry was confirmed to play the critical role in the CF excitation splitting and anisotropic responses to magnetic fields in REFeO$_{3}$. This study provides a consistent in-depth understanding to the abnormal Zeeman splitting effect of the CF ground states in REFeO$_{3}$.

Title: Microscopic phase-transition theory of charge density waves: revealing hidden transitions of phason and amplitudon
Authors: F. Yang, L. Q. Chen
Abstract: We develop a self-consistent phase-transition theory of charge density waves (CDWs), starting from a purely microscopic model. Specifically, we derive a microscopic CDW gap equation $|\Delta_0(T)|$, taking into account of thermal phase fluctuations (i.e., thermal excitation of phason) and their influence on CDW pinning (i.e., the phason mass) and CDW gap. We demonstrate that as temperature increases from zero, the phason gradually softens, leading to a depinning transition (where the phason becomes gapless) at $T_d$ and a subsequent first-order CDW phase transition at $T_c>T_d$. The predicted values of $T_d$, $T_c$ as well as the large ratio of $|\Delta_0(T=0)|/(k_BT_c)$ for the quasi-one-dimensional CDW material (TaSe$_4$)$_2$I show remarkable quantitative agreements with experimental measurements and explain many of the previously observed key thermodynamic features and unresolved issues in literature. To further validate the theory, we calculate the energy gap of CDW amplitudon and its lifetime, and reveal a transition of amplitudon from a lightly damped to a heavily damped excitation during pinning-depinning transition while its energy gap is nearly unchanged throughout the entire CDW phase. This finding quantitatively captures and explains the recently observed coherent signal in ultrafast THz emission spectroscopy on (TaSe$_4$)$_2$I.

Authors: Emanuele Pompei, Katarzyna Skibińska, Giulio Senesi, Ylea Vlamidis, Antonio Rossi, Stiven Forti, Camilla Coletti, Fabio Beltram, Lucia Sorba, Stefan Heun, Stefano Veronesi
Abstract: The creation of atomically thin layers of non-exfoliable materials remains a crucial challenge, requiring the development of innovative techniques. Here, confinement epitaxy is exploited to realize two-dimensional gallium via intercalation in epitaxial graphene grown on silicon carbide. Novel superstructures arising from the interaction of gallenene (a monolayer of gallium) with graphene and the silicon carbide substrate are investigated. The coexistence of different gallenene phases, including b010-gallenene and the elusive high-pressure Ga(III) phase, is identified. This work sheds new light on the formation of two-dimensional gallium and provides a platform for investigating the exotic electronic and optical properties of confined gallenene.

Title: Spatially Mapping Phonon Drag in Ultrascaled 5-nm Silicon Nanowire Field-Effect Transistor Based on a Quantum Hydrodynamic Formalism
Authors: Houssem Rezgui, Giovanni Nastasi, Manuel Marcoux, Vittorio Romano
Abstract: The compelling demand for higher performance and lower thermal energy dissipation in nanoelectronic devices is the major driving force of the semiconductor industry's quest for future generations of nanotransistors. Over the past 15 years, the miniaturization of silicon-based nanoelectronics predicted by Moore's law has driven an aggressive scaling down of the transistor structure, including materials, design, and geometries. In this regard, the electronic device community has expanded its focus to ultrascaled transistors targeting 7-nm technology node and beyond. However, these emerging nanodevices are also creating thermal issues that could evidently limit their carrier transfer as a result of strong electron-phonon coupling. We aim to explain the physical origin of self-heating effects in an ultrascaled 5-nm silicon nanowire Field-Effect Transistor. On the basis of the quantum hydrodynamic approach, a possible explanation of phonon drag contribution to thermal conductivity is also discussed. To the best of our knowledge, we report for the first time the impact of the phonon drag effect on the electrical and thermal performance of 5nm gate-all-around silicon nanowire field-effect transistors. Our findings provide a deep insight into the origin of self-heating as a result of mutual electron-phonon coupling. Furthermore, we further demonstrate that the phonon drag effect significantly reduces thermal conductivity by nearly 50\% under high bias conditions.

Title: Statistical method for A-RNA and B-DNA
Authors: Marco Zoli
Abstract: Nucleic acids have been regarded as stiff polymers with long-range flexibility and generally modeled using elastic rod models of polymer physics. Notwithstanding, investigations carried out over the past few years on single fragments of order $\sim 100$ base pairs have revealed remarkable flexibility properties at short scales and called for theoretical approaches that emphasize the role of the bending fluctuations at single sites along the molecule stack. Here, we review a three dimensional mesoscopic Hamiltonian model which assumes a discrete representation of the double stranded (ds) molecules at the level of the nucleotides. The model captures the fundamental local interactions between adjacent sugar-phosphate groups and the pairwise interactions between complementary base pair mates. A statistical method based on the path integral formalism sets the ensemble of the base pair breathing fluctuations which are included in the partition function and permits to derive the thermodynamics and the elastic response of single molecules to external forces. We apply the model to the computation of the twist-stretch relations for fragments of ds-DNA and ds-RNA, showing that the obtained opposite pattern (DNA overtwists whereas RNA untwists versus force) follows from the different structural features of the two helices. Moreover, we focus on the DNA stretching due to the confinement in nano-pores and, finally, on the computation of the cyclization probability of open ends molecules of $\sim 100$ base pairs under physiological conditions. The mesoscopic model shows a distinct advantage over the elastic rod model in estimating the molecule bendability at short length scale.

Title: Orbital-Selective Quasiparticle Depletion across the Density Wave Transition in Trilayer Nickelate La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$
Authors: Dong-Hyeon Gim, Chung Ha Park, Kee Hoon Kim
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of polarized electronic Raman response in trilayer nickelate La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$, uncovering a systematic reduction of the incoherent electron continuum across the density wave transition in the $A_{1g}$ and $B_{1g}$ representations. Analysis based on the Fermi surface band curvatures points to quasiparticle coherence in momentum positions with dominant $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital character. Our findings establish the symmetry channels and the active role of $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals involved in the density wave formation, offering important insight into the electronic and magnetic correlations in the nickelate.

Title: Peak Broadening in Photoelectron Spectroscopy of Amorphous Polymers: the Leading Role of the Electrostatic Landscape

Abstract: The broadening in photoelectron spectra of polymers can be attributed to several factors, such as light source spread, spectrometer resolution, finite lifetime of the hole state, and solid-state effects. Here, for the first time, we set up a computational protocol to assess the peak broadening induced for both core and valence levels by solid-state effects in four amorphous polymers by using a combination of density functional theory, many-body perturbation theory, and classical polarizable embedding. We show that intrinsic local inhomogeneities in the electrostatic environment induce a Gaussian broadening of $0.2$-$0.7$~eV in the binding energies of both core and semi-valence electrons, corresponding to a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of $0.5$-$1.7$~eV for the investigated systems. The induced broadening is larger in acrylate- than in styrene- based polymers, revealing the crucial role of polar groups in controlling the roughness of the electrostatic landscape in the solid matrix.

Title: Mean pairwise distances in Rouse polymer subject to fast loop extrusion
Authors: Ilya Nikitin, Nikolay Masnev, Sergey Belan
Abstract: We consider a model of a Rouse polymer extended by the mechanism of active loop extrusion. The model is based on a kinetic equation that is valid provided that the extrusion rate is high enough and the resulting loop ensemble is sufficiently sparse. Within the one-loop approximation of diagrammatic calculations, a semi-analytical method for determining the mean square physical distance between a pair of chain beads as a function of the contour distance between them is developed. The model is based on a kinetic equation that is valid provided that the extrusion rate is high enough and the resulting loop ensemble is sufficiently sparse. Within the framework of the one-loop approximation of diagrammatic calculations, a semi-analytical method for determining the mean square of the physical distance between a pair of chain sections as a function of the contour distance between them is developed. The mean square of the physical distance and its logarithmic derivative as functions of the contour separation are plotted for different values of the equilibrium degree. The results are compared with the case of frozen disorder of sparse loops.

Title: Spin-glass quantum phase transition in amorphous arrays of Rydberg atoms
Authors: L. Brodoloni, J. Vovrosh, S. Julià-Farré, A. Dauphin, S. Pilati
Abstract: The experiments performed with neutral atoms trapped in optical tweezers and coherently coupled to the Rydberg state allow quantum simulations of paradigmatic Hamiltonians for quantum magnetism. Previous studies have focused mainly on periodic arrangements of the optical tweezers, which host various spatially ordered magnetic phases. Here, we perform unbiased quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the ground state of quantum Ising models for amorphous arrays of Rydberg atoms. These models are designed to feature well-controlled local structural properties in the absence of long-range order. Notably, by determining the Edwards-Anderson order parameter, we find evidence of a quantum phase transition from a paramagnetic to a spin-glass phase. The magnetic structure factor indicates short-range isotropic antiferromagnetic correlations. For the feasible sizes, the spin-overlap distribution features a nontrivial structure with two broad peaks and a sizable weight at zero overlap. The comparison against results for the clean kagome lattice, which features local structural properties similar to those of our amorphous arrays, highlights the important role of the absence of long-range structural order of the underlying array. Our findings indicate a route to experimentally implement the details of a Hamiltonian which hosts a quantum spin-glass phase.

Title: Bulldozing an immersed granular material in a confined channel
Authors: Liam C. Morrow, Oliver W. Paulin, Matthew G. Hennessy, Duncan R. Hewitt, Miles L. Morgan, Bjørnar Sandnes, Christopher W. MacMinn
Abstract: The motion of an immersed granular material in a channel is characterised by complex interactions among the grains, between the grains and the permeating liquid, and between the grains and the channel walls. Here, we develop a reduced-order continuum model for the bulldozing of an immersed, sedimented granular material by a piston in a channel. In our continuum approach, the granular pile and the overlying fluid layer evolve as a system of coupled thin films. We model the granular phase as a dense, porous, visco-plastic material that experiences Coulomb-like friction with the walls. Conservation of mass and momentum under a thin-film approximation leads to an elliptic equation for the velocity of the grains that is coupled with an evolution equation for the height of the granular pile. We solve our model numerically for a variety of different scenarios to explore the interactions between wall friction, internal viscous-like stresses, and fluid flow above and through the pile. We complement our numerical results with a series of experiments that provide insight into the validity and limitations of the model.

Title: Exponential Dependence of Interlayer Exchange Coupling in Fe/MgO(001) Superlattices on Temperature
Authors: Nanny Strandqvist, Tobias Warnatz, Kristbjörg Anna Thórarinsdóttir, Alexei Vorobiev, Vassilios Kapaklis, Björgvin Hjörvarsson
Abstract: The interlayer exchange coupling in Fe/MgO(001) superlattices is found to increase exponentially with decreasing temperature. Around 150~K, the field induced response changes from discrete switching, governed by field-driven domain propagation, to a collective rotation of the magnetic layers. This transition is accompanied by a change in the magnetic ground state from 180$^{\circ}$ (antiferromagnetic) to 90$^{\circ}$ alignment between adjacent Fe layers. These effects are argued to arise from quantum well states, defined by the total thickness of the samples.

Title: Probing orbital magnetism of a kagome metal CsV3Sb5 by a tuning fork resonator
Authors: Hengrui Gui, Lin Yang, Xiaoyu Wang, Dong Chen, Zekai Shi, Jiawen Zhang, Jia Wei, Keyi Zhou, Walter Schnelle, Yongjun Zhang, Yu Liu, Alimamy F. Bangura, Ziqiang Wang, Claudia Felser, Huiqiu Yuan, Lin Jiao
Abstract: The recently discovered kagome metal CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ exhibits a complex phase diagram that encompasses frustrated magnetism, topological charge density wave (CDW), and superconductivity. One CDW state that breaks time-reversal symmetry was proposed in this compound, while the exact nature of the putative magnetic state remains elusive. To examine the thermodynamic state of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ and assess the character of the associated magnetism, we conducted tuning fork resonator measurements of magnetotropic susceptibility over a broad range of angles, magnetic fields, and temperature. We found a cascade of phase transition in the CDW phase. Of particular interest is a highly anisotropic magnetic structure that arises below about 30~K, with a magnetic moment along the $c$-axis that has an extremely small magnitude. This magnetic state demonstrates extremely slow dynamics and small saturate field, all suggest that electronic phase below 30~K breaks time reversal symmetry and has an unconventional origin.

Title: Altermagnetic Skyrmions in 2D Lattices Exhibiting Anisotropic Skyrmion Hall Effect
Authors: Kaiying Dou, Zhonglin He, Wenhui Du, Ying Dai, Baibiao Huang, Yandong Ma
Abstract: Anisotropic skyrmion Hall effect (A-SkHE) in two-dimensional (2D) magnetic systems represents a captivating phenomenon in condensed-matter physics and materials science. While conventional antiferromagnetic systems inherently suppress this effect through parity-time symmetry-mediated cancellation of Magnus forces acting on skyrmions, A-SkHE is primarily confined to ferromagnetic platforms. Here, we present a paradigm-shifting demonstration of this phenomenon in spin-splitting 2D antiferromagnets through the investigation of altermagnetic skyrmions. Combining comprehensive symmetry analysis with theoretical modeling, we elucidate the mechanism governing A-SkHE realization in 2D altermagnetic systems and establish a quantitative relationship between the transverse velocity of altermagnetic skyrmions and applied current orientation. Using first-principles calculations and micromagnetic simulations, this mechanism is further illustrated in a prototypical altermagnetic monolayer V2SeTeO. Crucially, we identify that the [C2C4zt] symmetry-protected anisotropic field serves as the critical stabilizer for maintaining the A-SkHE in this system. Our results greatly enrich the research on 2D altermagnetism and skyrmions.

Title: Report on Neural-like Criticality in Ag-based Nanoparticle Networks
Authors: Blessing Adejube, Jamie Steel, Joshua Mallinson, Mariia Protsak, Daniil Nikitin, Thomas Strunskus, Andrei Choukourov, Franz Faupel, Simon Anthony Brown, Alexander Vahl
Abstract: Emulating the neural-like information processing dynamics of the brain provides a time and energy efficient approach for solving complex problems. While the majority of neuromorphic hardware currently developed rely on large arrays of highly organized building units, such as in rigid crossbar architectures, in biological neuron assemblies make use of dynamic transitions within highly parallel, reconfigurable connection schemes. Neuroscience suggests that efficiency of information processing in the brain rely on dynamic interactions and signal propagations which are self-tuned and non-rigid. Brain-like dynamic and avalanche criticality have already been found in a variety of self-organized networks of nanoobjects, such as nanoparticles (NP) or nanowires. Here we report on the dynamics of the electrical spiking signals from Ag-based self-organized nanoparticle networks (NPNs) at the example of monometallic Ag NPNs, bimetallic AgAu alloy NPNs and composite Ag/ZrN NPNs, which combine two distinct NP species. We present time series recordings of the resistive switching responses in each network and showcase the determination of switching events as well as the evaluation of avalanche criticality. In each case, for Ag NPN, AgAu NPN and Ag/ZrN NPN, the agreement of three independently derived estimates of the characteristic exponent provides evidence for avalanche criticality. The study shows that Ag-based NPNs offer a broad range of versatility for integration purposes into physical computing systems without destroying their critical dynamics, as the composition of these NPNs can be modified to suit specific requirements for integration.

Title: Steady-state heat engines driven by finite reservoirs
Authors: Iago N. Mamede, Saulo V. Moreira, Mark T. Mitchison, Carlos E. Fiore
Abstract: We provide a consistent thermodynamic analysis of stochastic thermal engines driven by finite-size reservoirs, which are in turn coupled to infinite-size reservoirs. We consider a cyclic operation mode, where the working medium couples sequentially to hot and cold reservoirs, and a continuous mode with both reservoirs coupled simultaneously. We derive an effective temperature for the finite-size reservoirs determining the entropy production for two-state engines in the sequential coupling scenario, and show that finite-size reservoirs can meaningfully affect the power when compared to infinite-size reservoirs in both sequential and simultaneous coupling scenarios. We also investigate a three-state engine comprising two interacting units and optimize its performance in the presence of a finite reservoir. Notably, we show that the efficiency at maximum power can exceed the Curzon-Ahlborn bound with finite reservoirs. Our work introduces tools to optimize the performance of nanoscale engines under realistic conditions of finite reservoir heat capacity and imperfect thermal isolation.

Title: Superconducting susceptibility signal captured in a record wide pressure range
Authors: Shu Cai, Jinyu Zhao, Di Peng, Yazhou Zhou, Jing Guo, Nana Li, Jianbo Zhang, Yang Ding, Wenge Yang, Qiaoshi Zeng, Qi Wu, Tao Xiang, Ho-kwang Mao, Liling Sun
Abstract: In recent years, the resistance signature of the high temperature superconductivity above 250 K in highly compressed hydrides (more than 100 GPa) has garnered significant attention within the condensed matter physics community. This has sparked renewed optimism for achieving superconductivity under room-temperature conditions. However, the superconducting diamagnetism, another crucial property for confirming the superconductivity, has yet to be conclusively observed. The primary challenge arises from the weak diamagnetic signals detected from the small samples compressed in diamond anvil cells. Therefore, the reported results of superconducting diamagnetism in hydrides have sparked intense debate, highlighting the urgent need for workable methodology to assess the validity of the experimental results. Here, we are the first to report the ultrahigh pressure measurements of the superconducting diamagnetism on Nb0.44Ti0.56, a commercial superconducting alloy, in a record-wide pressure range from 5 GPa to 160 GPa. We present detailed results on factors such as sample size, the diamagnetic signal intensity, the signal-to-noise ratio and the superconducting transition temperature across various pressures and different pressure transmitting media. These comprehensive results clearly demonstrate that this alloy is an ideal reference sample for evaluating superconductivity in compressed hydrides,validating the credibility of the experimental systems and superconducting diamagnetic results, as well as determining the nature of the superconductivity of the investigated sample. In addition, these results also provide a valuable benchmark for studying the pressure-induced superconductivity in other material families.

Title: Expansion of one-dimensional spinor gases from power-law traps
Authors: Ovidiu I. Patu, Gianni Aupetit-Diallo
Abstract: Free expansion following the removal of axial confinement represents a fundamental nonequilibrium scenario in the study of many-body ultracold gases. Using the stationary phase approximation, we analytically demonstrate that for all one-dimensional spinor gases with repulsive contact interactions, whether bosonic or fermionic, the asymptotic density and momentum distribution can be directly determined from the quasimomentum distribution (Bethe rapidities) of the trapped gas. We efficiently obtain the quasimomentum distribution numerically by solving the integral equations that characterize the ground state of the integrable system within the local density approximation. Additionally, we derive analytical solutions for both weakly and strongly interacting regimes. Unlike in bosonic gases, where rapidity distributions and density profiles vary significantly across interaction regimes, fermionic gases maintain similar profiles in both weakly and strongly interacting limits. Notably, the gas expands self-similarly only when released from a harmonic trap. For other power-law trapping potentials, the asymptotic density profile is strongly influenced by the initial confinement geometry. Our results extend readily to Bose-Fermi mixtures and finite temperatures.

Title: Two-dimensional $J_1$-$J_2$ clock model: A cornucopia of emergence
Authors: Vishnu Pulloor Kuttanikkad, Abhishodh Prakash, Rajesh Narayanan, Titas Chanda
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study on the frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$ classical $q$-state clock model with even $q>4$ on a two-dimensional square lattice, revealing a rich ensemble of phases driven by competing interactions. In the unfrustrated regime ($J_1>2J_2$), the model reproduces the standard clock model phenomenology: a low-temperature $\mathbb{Z}_q$-broken ferromagnet, an intermediate XY-like critical quasi-long-range-ordered (QLRO) phase with emergent $U(1)$ symmetry, and a high-temperature paramagnet. For $J_1<2J_2$, frustration stabilizes five distinct regimes: the disordered paramagnet, a stripe-ordered phase breaking $\mathbb{Z}_q\times\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, two $\mathbb{Z}_2$-broken nematic phases (one with and one without QLRO), and an exotic stripe phase with emergent discrete $\mathbb{Z}_q$ spin degrees of freedom prohibited in the microscopic Hamiltonian. Remarkably, this seemingly forbidden $\mathbb{Z}_q$ order emerges via a relevant operator in the infrared long-wavelength limit, rather than from an irrelevant perturbation, highlighting a non-standard route to emergence. Using large-scale corner transfer matrix renormalization group calculations, complemented by classical Monte Carlo simulations, we map the complete phase diagram and identify Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless, Ising, first-order, and unconventional Landau-incompatible transitions between different phases. Finally, we propose an effective field-theoretic framework that encompasses these emergent orders and their interwoven transitions.

Abstract: A single crystalline system typically stabilizes a unique state for spin ordering below a critical temperature. Certain materials exhibit multiple magnetic states, driven by structural phase transitions under varying thermodynamic conditions. Recently, van der Waals magnets have demonstrated subtle interlayer exchange interactions, offering a promising approach to electrically control spin states without structural transformation. Here, we report the emergence of three distinct magnetic states, ferromagnetic ordering and both collinear and non-collinear antiferromagnetic orderings, in a layered single crystalline magnet, cobalt-doped Fe3GaTe2 ((Co, Fe)3GaTe2). These three magnetic phases occur without structural phase transitions, a phenomenon we designate as polymorphic spin ordering in the material. The introduction of 16% Co-doping in Fe3GaTe2 modulates the interlayer magnetic interaction, enabling multiple spin orderings within the same lattice system with three critical temperatures: a Curie temperature for a ferromagnetic state (Tc=210 K) and two Neel temperatures for the collinear (TN1=110 K) and non-collinear (TN2=30 K) antiferromagnetic states. Our findings are supported by magnetic force microscopy, first-principles calculations, and circular dichroism angular photoemission spectroscopy, which reveals varying spin ordering and changes in the topological band structure and Berry curvature at different temperatures within the single-crystalline (Co, Fe)3GaTe2.

Title: Static and dynamic properties of Kitaev-Heisenberg ferromagnet on a triangular lattice
Authors: Kaushal K. Kesharpu, Pavel A. Maksimov
Abstract: We present an extensive study of ground state and excitations of ferromagnetic anisotropic-exchange Kitaev-Heisenberg model on a triangular lattice using order-by-disorder calculations. It is shown that while bond-dependent terms do not affect the ground state classically, quantum fluctuations select preferred magnetization direction of the ferromagnetic state. Anisotropic terms of the magnetic Hamiltonian also give rise to magnon-magnon interactions that lead to spontaneous decays and spectral renormalization, which we illustrate using non-linear spin-wave theory.

Title: Engineering second order topological superconductor hosting tunable Majorana corner modes in magnet/$d$-wave superconductor hybrid platform
Authors: Minakshi Subhadarshini, Archana Mishra, Arijit Saha
Abstract: We propose a theoretical framework for realizing a two-dimensional (2D) second-order topological superconductor (SOTSC) in a hybrid system comprised of a $d$-wave superconductor, a quantum spin Hall insulator (QSHI), and a noncollinear magnetic texture deposited on top of the unconventional superconductor. While the interplay of the $d$-wave superconductor and QSHI has been studied as a platform to realize Majorana corner modes (MCMs), we show that the addition of the spin texture enables the tunability of these MCMs. Each corner of this hybrid system can host one or two Majorana modes depending on the system parameters, in particular, exchange strength and pitch vector of the spin texture. To characterize the higher order bulk topology, we compute the quadrupolar winding number, which directly corresponds to the number of MCMs acquiring a value of one for four corner modes and two for eight corner modes. We investigate and show the close resemblance in the topological phase diagrams obtained from the low energy effective Hamiltonian that reveals an emergent in-plane Zeeman field and spin-orbit coupling induced by the spin texture, and the real space tight binding lattice model. The microscopic pairing mechanism responsible for the appearance of SOTSC phase is investigated via an effective bulk pairing analysis, while a low-energy edge theory captures the mechanism behind tunability of MCMs. Our result paves the way for realizing SOTC with multiple MCMs which can be tuned via system parameters.

Title: Machine learning-enabled atomistic insights into phase boundary engineering of solid-solution ferroelectrics
Authors: Weiru Wen, Fan-Da Zeng, Ben Xu, Bi Ke, Zhipeng Xing, Hao-Cheng Thong, Ke Wang
Abstract: Atomistic control of phase boundaries is crucial for optimizing the functional properties of solid-solution ferroelectrics, yet their microstructural mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we harness machine-learning-driven molecular dynamics to resolve the phase boundary behavior in the KNbO3-KTaO3 (KNTO) system. Our simulations reveal that chemical composition and ordering enable precise modulation of polymorphic phase boundaries (PPBs), offering a versatile pathway for materials engineering. Diffused PPBs and polar nano regions, predicted by our model, highly match with experiments, underscoring the fidelity of the machine-learning atomistic simulation. Crucially, we identify elastic and electrostatic mismatches between ferroelectric KNbO3 and paraelectric KTaO3 as the driving forces behind complex microstructural evolution. This work not only resolves the longstanding microstructural debate but also establishes a generalizable framework for phase boundary engineering toward next-generation high-performance ferroelectrics.

Title: General Hamiltonian description of nonreciprocal interactions
Authors: Yu-bo Shi, Roderich Moessner, Ricard Alert, Marin Bukov
Abstract: In a vast class of systems, which includes members as diverse as active colloids and bird flocks, interactions do not stem from a potential, and are in general nonreciprocal. Thus, it is not possible to define a conventional energy function, nor to use analytical or numerical tools that rely on it. Here, we overcome these limitations by constructing a Hamiltonian that includes auxiliary degrees of freedom; when subject to a constraint, this Hamiltonian yields the original non-reciprocal dynamics. We show that Glauber dynamics based on the constrained Hamiltonian reproduces the steady states of the original Langevin dynamics, as we explicitly illustrate for dissipative XY spins with vision-cone interactions. Further, the symplectic structure inherent to our construction allows us to apply the well-developed notions of Hamiltonian engineering, which we demonstrate by varying the amplitude of a periodic drive to tune the spin interactions between those of a square and a chain lattice geometry. Overall, our framework for generic nonreciprocal pairwise interactions paves the way for bringing to bear the full conceptual and methodological power of conventional statistical mechanics and Hamiltonian dynamics to nonreciprocal systems.

Title: Partitioning Law of Polymer Chains into Flexible Polymer Networks
Authors: Haruki Takarai, Takashi Yasuda, Naoyuki Sakumichi, Takamasa Sakai
Abstract: The equilibrium partitioning of linear polymer chains into flexible polymer networks is governed by intricate entropic constraints arising from configurational degrees of freedom of both chains and network, yet a quantitative understanding remains elusive. Using model hydrogels with precisely defined network structures, we experimentally reveal a universal law governing linear polymer partitioning into flexible polymer networks. We establish a novel label-free, contactless method to measure partition ratio, based on the increase in osmotic pressure induced by external polymer chains partitioning into the network. Moreover, we find a universal law in which the partition constant is solely determined by the squared ratio $(R_g / l_\mathrm{cycle})^2$, where $R_g$ is the gyration radius of the polymer chain and $l_\mathrm{cycle}$ is the characteristic mesh size of the network, as defined by the cycle length.

Title: Strong tunability of epitaxial relationship and reconstruction at improper ferroelectric interface
Authors: Xin Li, Yu Yun, Guodong Ren, Arashdeep Singh Thind, Amit Kumar Shah, Rohan Mishra, Xiaoshan Xu
Abstract: The atomic structures at epitaxial film-substrate interfaces determine scalability of thin films and can result in new phenomena. However, it is challenging to control the interfacial structures since they are decided by the most stable atomic bonding. In this work, we report strong tunability of the epitaxial interface of improper ferroelectric hexagonal ferrites deposited on spinel ferrites. The selection of two interface types, related by a 90 deg rotation of in-plane epitaxial relations and featured by disordered and hybridized reconstructions respectively, can be achieved by growth conditions, stacking sequences, and spinel compositions. While the disordered type suppresses the primary K3 structure distortion and ferroelectricity in hexagonal ferrites, the hybridized type is more coherent with the distortion with minimal suppression. This tunable interfacial structure provides critical insight on controlling interfacial clamping and may offer a solution for the long-standing problem of practical critical thickness in improper ferroelectrics.

Title: Exploring unconventional superconductivity in PdTe via Point Contact Spectroscopy
Authors: Pritam Das, Sulagna Dutta, Saurav Suman, Amit Vashist, Bibek Ranjan Satapathy, John Jesudasan, Suvankar Chakraverty, Rajdeep Sensarma, Pratap Raychaudhuri
Abstract: Palladium Telluride (PdTe), a non-layered intermetallic crystalline compound, has captured attention for its unique superconducting properties and strong spin-orbit coupling. In this work, we investigate the superconducting state of PdTe using point-contact Andreev reflection (PCAR) spectroscopy. The experimental data are analyzed using the Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk (BTK) model for s, p and d wave symmetries. Our results reveal clear evidence of unconventional superconductivity. The superconducting gap showing features consistent with either p-wave or d-wave pairing symmetries but cannot be fitted with s-wave symmetry. The observed anisotropic gap structure and deviations from conventional BCS behaviour highlight the complex nature of the pairing interactions in PdTe. These findings provide strong evidence of unconventional pairing symmetry in this material.

Title: Electronic and Optical Properties of the Recently Synthesized 2D Vivianites (Vivianenes): Insights from First-Principles Calculations
Authors: Raphael Benjamim de Oliveira, Bruno Ipaves, Guilherme da Silva Lopes Fabris, Surbhi Slathia, Marcelo Lopes Pereira Júnior, Raphael Matozo Tromer, Chandra Sekhar Tiwary, Douglas Soares Galvão
Abstract: Vivianite (Fe$_3$(PO$_4$)$_2$8H$_2$O) is a naturally occurring layered material with significant environmental and technological relevance. This work presents a comprehensive theoretical investigation of its two-dimensional (2D) counterpart, Vivianene, focusing on its structural, electronic, and optical properties. Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations, we evaluate its thermodynamic stability, band structure, density of states, and optical response. Our results confirm that Vivianene retains the main structural features of bulk Vivianite while exhibiting enhanced thermodynamic stability at room temperature. The electronic structure analysis reveals an indirect bandgap of 3.03 eV for Vivianene, which is slightly lower than the 3.21 eV observed for bulk Vivianite, deviating from the expected quantum confinement trend in 2D materials. The projected density of states (PDOS) analysis indicates that Fe d orbitals predominantly contribute to the valence and conduction bands. Optical calculations demonstrate that Vivianene exhibits a higher optical band gap (3.6 eV) than bulk Vivianite (3.2 eV), with significant absorption in the ultraviolet region. The refractive index and reflectivity analyses suggest that most of the incident light is absorbed rather than reflected, reinforcing its potential for optoelectronic applications. These findings provide valuable insights into the fundamental properties of Vivianene and highlight its potential for advanced applications in sensing, optoelectronics, and energy-related technologies.

Title: Polaritonic Quantum Matter
Authors: D.N. Basov, A. Asenjo-Garcia, P.J. Schuck, X.-Y. Zhu, A. Rubio, A. Cavalleri, M. Delor, M.M. Fogler, Mengkun Liu
Abstract: Polaritons are quantum mechanical superpositions of photon states with elementary excitations in molecules and solids. The light-matter admixture causes a characteristic frequency-momentum dispersion shared by all polaritons irrespective of the microscopic nature of material excitations that could entail charge, spin, lattice or orbital effects. Polaritons retain the strong nonlinearities of their matter component and simultaneously inherit ray-like propagation of light. Polaritons prompt new properties, enable new opportunities for spectroscopy/imaging, empower quantum simulations and give rise to new forms of synthetic quantum matter. Here, we review the emergent effects rooted in polaritonic quasiparticles in a wide variety of their physical implementations. We present a broad portfolio of the physical platforms and phenomena of what we term polaritonic quantum matter. We discuss the unifying aspects of polaritons across different platforms and physical implementations and focus on recent developments in: polaritonic imaging, cavity electrodynamics and cavity materials engineering, topology and nonlinearities, as well as quantum polaritonics.

Title: Robust Critical Connectivity Threshold in Ranked Percolation of Granular Packings
Authors: Vasco C. Braz, N. A. M. Araújo
Abstract: The formation of sintering bridges in amorphous powders affects both flow behavior and perceived material quality. When sintering is driven by surface tension, bridges emerge sequentially, favoring contacts between smaller particles first. Predicting the connectivity percolation threshold is key to understanding and controlling the onset of sintering. We investigate ranked percolation in granular packings, where particles connect based on contact number. While the percolation threshold defined by the fraction of connected particles is non-universal and highly sensitive to particle size dispersion, we find that the critical number of sintered bridges per particle provides a robust estimator across different size distributions. Through numerical simulations and a mean-field approach, we link this robustness to the spatial distribution of contacts. Our results have broader implications for understanding the resilience of spatially embedded networks under targeted attacks.

Title: Josephson current signature of Floquet Majorana and topological accidental zero modes in altermagnet heterostructure
Authors: Amartya Pal, Debashish Mondal, Tanay Nag, Arijit Saha
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the generation and Josephson current signatures of Floquet Majorana end modes (FMEMs) in a periodically driven altermagnet (AM) heterostructure. Considering a one-dimensional (1D) Rashba nanowire (RNW) proximitized to a regular $s$-wave superconductor and a $d$-wave AM, we generate both $0$- and $\pi$-FMEMs by driving the nontopological phase of the static system. While the static counterpart hosts both topological Majorana zero modes (MZMs) and non-topological accidental zero modes (AZMs), the drive can gap out the static AZMs and generate robust $\pi$-FMEMs, termed as topological AZMs (TAZMs). We topologically characterize the emergent FMEMs via dynamical winding numbers exploiting chiral symmetry of the system. Moreover, we consider a periodically driven Josephson junction comprising of RNW/AM-based 1D topological superconduting setup. We identify the signature of MZMs and FMEMs utilizing $4\pi$-periodic Josephson effect, distinguishing them from trivial AZMs exhibiting $2\pi$-periodicty, in both static and driven platforms. This Josephson current signal due to Majorana modes survives even in presence of finite disorder. Our work establishes a route to realize and identify FMEMs in AM-based platforms through Floquet engineering and Josephson current response.

Title: Numerical Integration of the KPZ and Related Equations on Networks: The Case of the Cayley Tree
Authors: J. M. Marcos, J. J. Meléndez, R. Cuerno, J. J. Ruiz-Lorenzo
Abstract: The numerical integration of stochastic growth equations on non-Euclidean networks presents unique challenges due to the nonlinearities that occur in many relevant models and of the structural constraints of the networks. In this work, we integrate the KPZ, Edwards-Wilkinson, and tensionless KPZ equations on Cayley trees using different numerical schemes and compare their behavior with previous results obtained for discrete growth models. By assessing the stability and accuracy of these methods, we explore how network topology influences interface growth and how boundary effects shape the observed scaling properties. Our results show good agreement with previous studies on discrete models, reinforcing key scaling behaviors while highlighting some differences. These findings contribute to a better understanding of surface growth on networked substrates and provide a computational framework for studying nonlinear stochastic processes beyond Euclidean lattices.

Title: Nonlinear optical response of truly chiral phonons: Light-induced phonon angular momentum, Peltier effect, and orbital current
Authors: Hiroaki Ishizuka, Masahiro Sato
Abstract: The nonlinear optical responses of chiral phonons to terahertz and infrared light are studied using the nonlinear response theory. We show that the photo-induced angular momentum increases with the square of the chiral-phonon relaxation time $\tau$, giving a significantly larger angular momentum compared to ordinary phonons. We also find that the photo-induced Peltier effect by chiral phonons occurs through a mechanism distinct from those proposed recently; the induced energy current scales $\propto\tau^2$, giving a larger energy current in the clean limit. We prove a linear relation between the generated angular momentum and the energy current. Lastly, we show that the orbital current, an analog of the spin current, occurs through a nonlinear response. These findings demonstrate the unique properties and functionalities of chiral phonons.

Title: Type-III Weyl Semi-Half-Metal in an Ultralight Monolayer Li$_2$N
Authors: Qingqing Li, Li Chen, Run-Wu Zhang, Botao Fu
Abstract: The interplay between magnetic ordering and band topology has emerged as a fertile ground for discovering novel quantum states with profound implications for fundamental physics and next-generation electronics. Here, we theoretically predict a new type-III Weyl semi-half-metal (SHM) state in monolayer Li$_2$N, uniquely combining magnetic half-metallicity and type-III Weyl semimetal characteristics. First-principles calculations reveal a fully spin-polarized and critically tilted Weyl cone around the Fermi level in monolayer Li$_2$N, driven by $p$-orbital ferromagnetism. This arises from the symmetry-protected band crossing between a flat valence band and a highly dispersive conduction band, leading to type-III Weyl fermions with strong transport anisotropy. A low-energy $k{\cdot}p$ Hamiltonian is constructed and corresponding nontrivial edge states are uncovered to capture the topological nature of Li$_2$N. Notably, this Weyl SHM phase remains robust under biaxial strain ranging from -2$\%$ to $4\%$, with an ideal type-III Weyl fermion emerging alongside a line-like ergodic surface emerging at 3.7$\%$ strain, offering a promising platform for exploring correlated electronic phenomena. Our results establish Li$_2$N as a viable candidate for realizing exotic type-III Weyl SHM states and open a new avenue for exploring the intricate interplay among magnetism, topology, and flat-band physics.

Title: Magnetic ground states of highly doped two-leg Hubbard ladders with a particle bath
Authors: Hiroaki Onishi, Seiji Miyashita
Abstract: We investigate the ground-state magnetism of a Hubbard model in a system consisting of a main frame (subsystem) and a particle bath (center sites). The hole doping in the main frame is controlled by adjusting the chemical potential of the particle bath. In the weakly doped region, the saturated ferromagnetic state emerges due to the Nagaoka mechanism [Phys. Rev. B 90, 224426 (2014)]. However, in the highly doped region, a variety of intriguing magnetic states are observed, including partially polarized states and nonmagnetic states. To understand these states, we analyze the state of the subsystem by comparing its properties with those of a two-leg ladder system, which corresponds to the subsystem with the center sites removed. Furthermore, to gain insight into the microscopic origin of the magnetic phase diagram, we study the ground state of the corresponding effective t-J model, derived from the Hubbard model by considering the second-order processes of the electron hopping. The phase diagram is well reproduced by the effective t-J model, which includes the three-site pair-hopping term. To elucidate the competition among different energy contributions, such as potential, kinetic, and magnetic energies, we classify the energies within the effective t-J model.

Title: High-fidelity Grain Growth Modeling: Leveraging Deep Learning for Fast Computations
Authors: Pungponhavoan Tep, Marc Bernacki
Abstract: Grain growth simulation is crucial for predicting metallic material microstructure evolution during annealing and resulting final mechanical properties, but traditional partial differential equation-based methods are computationally expensive, creating bottlenecks in materials design and manufacturing. In this work, we introduce a machine learning framework that combines a Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory networks with an Autoencoder to efficiently predict grain growth evolution. Our approach captures both spatial and temporal aspects of grain evolution while encoding high-dimensional grain structure data into a compact latent space for pattern learning, enhanced by a novel composite loss function combining Mean Squared Error, Structural Similarity Index Measurement, and Boundary Preservation to maintain structural integrity of grain boundary topology of the prediction. Results demonstrated that our machine learning approach accelerates grain growth prediction by up to \SI{89}{\times} faster, reducing computation time from \SI{10}{\minute} to approximately \SI{10}{\second} while maintaining high-fidelity predictions. The best model (S-30-30) achieving a structural similarity score of \SI{86.71}{\percent} and mean grain size error of just \SI{0.07}{\percent}. All models accurately captured grain boundary topology, morphology, and size distributions. This approach enables rapid microstructural prediction for applications where conventional simulations are prohibitively time-consuming, potentially accelerating innovation in materials science and manufacturing.

Title: Salt-induced gelation of nonionic sucrose ester dispersions
Authors: Diana Cholakova, Nevena Pagureva, Monika Hristova, Slavka Tcholakova
Abstract: The dispersions of nonionic sucrose ester surfactants in water exhibit a highly negative zeta-potential, though its origin remains controversial. The addition of electrolytes to these dispersions may influence their zeta-potential, thus potentially affecting their physicochemical properties. The electrolyte- and pH- driven gelation of aqueous dispersions of commercial sucrose stearate (S970) containing ca. 1:1 monoesters and diesters was studied using optical microscopy, rheological and zeta-potential measurements, and small-angle X-ray scattering techniques. At low electrolyte concentrations and pH $\gtrapprox$ 5, 0.5-5 wt. % S970 dispersions exhibited low viscosities and behaved as freely flowing liquids. The addition of electrolytes of low concentrations, e.g. 9 mM NaCl or 1.5 mM MgCl$_2$, induced the formation of a non-flowing gels. This sol-gel transition occurred due to the partial screening of the diesters particles charge, allowing the formation of an attractive gel network, spanning across the dispersion volume. Complete charge screening, however, led to a gel-sol transition and phase separation. Gel formation was observed also by pH variation without electrolyte addition, whereas the addition of free fatty acids had negligible impact on dispersion properties. These findings support the hypothesis that the negative charge in sucrose ester dispersions arises from hydroxyl anions adsorption on particles surfaces. Gels were formed using just 1.3 wt. % surfactant, and the critical electrolyte concentration for gelation was found to scale approximately with the square of the cation charge, in agreement with the low surface charge density theory. The biodegradable sucrose esters gels offer a sustainable alternative for structuring personal and home care products, replacing the wormlike micelles of synthetic surfactants typically used at much higher surfactant and salt concentrations.

Title: Unconventional magnetoresistance and spin gapless semiconductor like behavior across the Martensitic transformation in off-stoichiometric Co-Fe-Ti-Si Heusler alloy thin films
Authors: Mainur Rahaman, Lanuakum A Longchar, Rajeev Joshi, R. Rawat, Archana Lakhani, M. Manivel Raja, S. N. Kaul, S. Srinath
Abstract: In this work, the effect of anti-site disorder on magnetic, electrical resistivity, transverse magnetoresistance MR, and anomalous Hall resistivity of off-stoichiometric CFTS Heusler alloy thin films, with a particular focus on martensitic phase transformation and spin gapless semiconductor SGS-like behavior, is investigated. These thin films were grown on Si (100) substrate at different substrate temperatures, TS, ranging from 200 C to 550 C using magnetron sputtering, enabling control over the degree of anti-site atomic ordering from disordered A2 to ordered L21. All the films, irrespective of their disorder, exhibit a distinct thermal hysteresis and significant drop in resistivity, crossover from asymmetric to symmetric magnetoresistance, and a sharp increase in MR around 300 K, confirming the occurrence of a thermo-elastic martensitic phase transformation. Detailed analysis of resistivity data indicates that for TS200 and TS350 films, a SGS based two channel model describes the conductivity in the martensite phase, whereas TS450, TS500, and TS550 films, exhibit a usual metallic behavior with a resistivity minimum at low temperatures. All the CFTS films show soft ferromagnetic nature and follow the spin-wave equation up to 390 K. The saturation magnetization and Hall conductivity increase with increasing crystalline order. The scaling relation between the longitudinal resistivity and the anomalous Hall resistivity in the martensite phase revels that skew scattering is the dominating contribution in disordered films, and a change in charge carrier type from hole to electron around the martensitic transformation temperature. The asymmetric MR, persistent up to room temperature, highlights the potential of these films for spintronic applications such as spin valves.

Title: Machine learning model for efficient nonthermal tuning of the charge density wave in monolayer NbSe$_2$
Authors: Luka Benić, Federico Grasselli, Chiheb Ben Mahmoud, Dino Novko, Ivor Lončarić
Abstract: Understanding and controlling the charge density wave (CDW) phase diagram of transition metal dichalcogenides is a long-studied problem in condensed matter physics. However, due to complex involvement of electron and lattice degrees of freedom and pronounced anharmonicity, theoretical simulations of the CDW phase diagram at the density-functional-theory level are often numerically demanding. To reduce the computational cost of first principles modelling by orders of magnitude, we have developed an electronic free energy machine learning model for monolayer NbSe$_2$ that allows changing both electronic and ionic temperatures independently. Our approach relies on a machine learning model of the electronic density of states and zero-temperature interatomic potential. This allows us to explore the CDW phase diagram of monolayer NbSe$_2$ both under thermal and laser-induced nonthermal conditions. Our study provides an accurate estimate of the CDW transition temperature at low cost and can disentangle the role of hot electrons and phonons in nonthermal ultrafast melting process of the CDW phase in NbSe$_2$.

Title: Ballistic-to-diffusive transition in engineered counter-propagating quantum Hall channels
Authors: Aifei Zhang, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Patrice Roche, Carles Altimiras, François Parmentier, Olivier Maillet
Abstract: Exotic quantum Hall systems hosting counter-propagating edge states can show seemingly non-universal transport regimes, usually depending on the size of the sample. We experimentally probe transport in a quantum Hall sample engineered to host a tunable number of counter-propagating edge states. The latter are coupled by Landauer reservoirs, which force charge equilibration over a tunable effective length. We show that charge transport is determined by the balance of up- and downstream channels, with a ballistic regime emerging for unequal numbers of channels. For equal numbers, we observe a transition to a critical diffusive regime, characterized by a diverging equilibration length. Our approach allows simulating the equilibration of hole-conjugate states and other exotic quantum Hall effects with fully controlled parameters using well-understood quantum Hall states.

Title: Longitudinal Josephson effect in systems with pairing of spatially separated electrons and holes
Authors: S.I. Shevchenko, O.M. Konstantynov
Abstract: Longitudinal non-dissipative current states in bilayer electron-hole systems in the presence of potential barriers that divide the system into left and right sides was investigated. The consideration is performed both for the case of weak carrier coupling (high density) and strong coupling (low density). It is shown that in the high-density limit, the critical current is proportional to the product of the transparencies of the barriers in the electron and hole layers, whereas in the low-density limit, the current is inversely proportional to the sum of the heights of the potential barriers.

Title: Fermi lune and transdimensional orbital magnetism in rhombohedral multilayer graphene
Authors: Min Li, Qingxin Li, Xin Lu, Hua Fan, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Yue Zhao, Xin-Cheng Xie, Lei Wang, Jianpeng Liu
Abstract: The symmetry and geometry of the Fermi surface play an essential role in governing the transport properties of a metallic system. A Fermi surface with reduced symmetry is intimately tied to unusual transport properties such as anomalous Hall effect and nonlinear Hall effect. Here, combining theoretical calculations and transport measurements, we report the discovery of a new class of bulk Fermi surface structure with unprecedented low symmetry, the ``Fermi lune", with peculiar crescent shaped Fermi energy contours, in rhombohedral multilayer graphene. This emergent Fermi-lune structure driven by electron-electron interactions spontaneously breaks time-reversal, mirror, and rotational symmetries, leading to two distinctive phenomena: giant intrinsic non-reciprocity in longitudinal transport and a new type of magnetism termed ``transdimensional orbital magnetism". Coupling the Fermi lune to a superlattice potential further produces a novel Chern insulator exhibiting quantized anomalous Hall effect controlled by in-plane magnetic field. Our work unveils a new symmetry breaking state of matter in the transdimensional regime, which opens an avenue for exploring correlated and topological quantum phenomena in symmetry breaking phases.

Title: Evidence of chiral fermion edge modes through geometric engineering of thermal Hall in $α$-RuCl$_3$
Authors: Heda Zhang, Gabor B. Halasz, Sujoy Ghosh, Stephen Jesse, Thomas Z. Ward, David Alan Tennant, Michael McGuire, Jiaqiang Yan
Abstract: The experimental observation of half-integer-quantized thermal Hall conductivity in the Kitaev candidate material $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ has served as smoking-gun signature of non-Abelian anyons through an associated chiral Majorana edge mode. However, both the reproducibility of the quantized thermal Hall conductivity and the fundamental nature of the associated heat carriers, whether bosonic or fermionic, are subjects of ongoing and vigorous debate. In a recent theoretical work, it was proposed that varying the sample geometry through creating constrictions can distinguish between different origins of the thermal Hall effect in magnetic insulators. Here, we provide experimental evidence of chiral fermion edge modes by comparing the thermal Hall effect of a geometrically constricted $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ sample with that of an unconstricted bulk sample. In contrast to the bulk crystals where the thermal Hall signal fades below 5\,K, the constricted crystals display a significant thermal Hall signal that remains measurable even at 2\,K. This sharp difference agrees well with the theoretical prediction and provides compelling evidence for the contribution of chiral fermion edge modes to the thermal Hall effect in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. More broadly, this work confirms that the geometry dependence of the thermal Hall effect can help identify chiral spin liquids in candidate materials like $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ and paves the way for the experimental realization of thermal anyon interferometry.

Title: Emergence of Spin-Polarized Unconventional Skin Effect in Hatano-Nelson Model
Authors: Moirangthem Sanahal, Subhasis Panda, Snehasish Nandy
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), a hallmark of non-Hermitian systems, stems from the topological nature of complex energy spectra, typically characterized by a nonzero spectral winding number in one dimension (1D). By investigating 1D spinful Hatano-Nelson model with Abelian gauge fields we uncover a tunable, unconventional spin-polarized NHSE with zero spectral winding, coexisting with a bidirectional conventional NHSE exhibiting nonzero winding. The unconventional skin modes display scale-restricted localization, distinguishing them from the critical NHSE. Upon introducing an external magnetic field coupled to the spin degrees of freedom, these unconventional skin modes are suppressed, leading to spectral instability and the emergence of critical NHSE with system size-dependent non-Bloch spectra. Meanwhile, conventional skin modes persist, but undergo a transition from bidirectional to unidirectional accumulation. Our results provide experimentally accessible predictions, relevant to photonic lattices and ultracold atomic systems with synthetic gauge fields.

Title: Reduced Basis Method for Driven-Dissipative Quantum Systems
Authors: Hans Christiansen, Virgil V. Baran, Jens Paaske
Abstract: Reduced basis methods provide an efficient way of mapping out phase diagrams of strongly correlated many-body quantum systems. The method relies on using the exact solutions at select parameter values to construct a low-dimensional basis, from which observables can be efficiently and reliably computed throughout the parameter space. Here we show that this method can be generalized to driven-dissipative Markovian systems allowing efficient calculations of observables in the transient and steady states. A subsequent distillation of the reduced basis vectors according to their explained variances allows for an unbiased exploration of the most pronounced parameter dependencies indicative of phase boundaries in the thermodynamic limit.

Title: Elucidating Ion Capture and Transport Mechanisms of Preyssler Anions in Aqueous Solutions Using Biased MACE-Accelerated MD Simulations
Authors: Quadri O. Adewuyi, Suchona Akter, Md Omar Faruque, Dil K. Limbu, Zhonghua Peng, Praveen K. Thallapally, Mohammed R. Momeni
Abstract: Equilibrium and biased MACE accelerated MD simulations in aqueous solutions are performed to investigate the ion capture and transport mechanisms of the {P5W30} Preyssler anion (PA) as the smallest representative member of the extended polyoxometalate (POM) family with an internal cavity. The unique interatomic interactions present in the internal cavity vs. exterior of PA are carefully investigated using equilibrium MACE MD simulations for two representative Na(H2O)@PA and Na@PA complexes. Our careful analyses of radial distribution functions and coordination numbers show that the presence of confined water in Na(H2O)@PA has profound modulating effects on the nature of the interactions of the encapsulated ion with the oxygens of the PA cavity. Using well-converged MACE-accelerated multiple walker well-tempered metadynamics simulations, two different associative and dissociative ion transport mechanisms were carefully investigated for Na+ as one of the most abundant and representative ions present in seawater and saline solutions. By comparing systems with and without confined water, it was found that the presence of only one pre-encapsulated confined water in Na(H2O)@PA dramatically changes the free energy landscape of ion transport processes. It was also found that the contraction and dilation of the two windows present in PA directly influence the Na+ and H2O transport. Results from this work are helpful as they show a viable path toward tuning the ion exchange and transport phenomena in aqueous solutions of POM molecular clusters and frameworks.

Title: Higher symmetries and anomalies in quantum lattice systems
Authors: Anton Kapustin
Abstract: We define an 't Hooft anomaly index for a group acting on a 2d quantum lattice system by finite-depth circuits. It takes values in the degree-4 cohomology of the group and is an obstruction to on-siteability of the group action. We introduce a 3-group (modeled as a crossed square) describing higher symmetries of a 2d lattice system and show that the 2d anomaly index is an obstruction for promoting a symmetry action to a morphism of 3-groups. This demonstrates that 't Hooft anomalies are a consequence of a mixing between ordinary symmetries and higher symmetries. Similarly, to any 1d lattice system we attach a 2-group (modeled as a crossed module) and interpret the Nayak-Else anomaly index as an obstruction for promoting a group action to a morphism of 2-groups. The meaning of indices of Symmetry Protected Topological states is also illuminated by higher group symmetry.

Title: Phase Retrieval via Gain-Based Photonic XY-Hamiltonian Optimization
Authors: Richard Zhipeng Wang, Guangyao Li, Silvia Gentilini, Marcello Calvanese Strinati, Claudio Conti, Natalia G. Berloff
Abstract: Phase-retrieval from coded diffraction patterns (CDP) is important to X-ray crystallography, diffraction tomography and astronomical imaging, yet remains a hard, non-convex inverse problem. We show that CDP recovery can be reformulated exactly as the minimisation of a continuous-variable XY Hamiltonian and solved by gain-based photonic networks. The coupled-mode equations we exploit are the natural mean-field dynamics of exciton-polariton condensate lattices, coupled-laser arrays and driven photon Bose-Einstein condensates, while other hardware such as the spatial photonic Ising machine can implement the same update rule through high-speed digital feedback, preserving full optical parallelism. Numerical experiments on images, two- and three-dimensional vortices and unstructured complex data demonstrate that the gain-based solver consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art Relaxed-Reflect-Reflect (RRR) algorithm in the medium-noise regime (signal-to-noise ratios 10--40 dB) and retains this advantage as problem size scales. Because the physical platform performs the continuous optimisation, our approach promises fast, energy-efficient phase retrieval on readily available photonic hardware. uch as two- and three-dimensional vortices, and unstructured random data. Moreover, the solver's accuracy remains high as problem sizes increase, underscoring its scalability.

Title: Efficient construction of effective Hamiltonians with a hybrid machine learning method
Authors: Yang Cheng, Binhua Zhang, Xueyang Li, Hongyu Yu, Changsong Xu, Hongjun Xiang
Abstract: The effective Hamiltonian method is a powerful tool for simulating large-scale systems across a wide range of temperatures. However, previous methods for constructing effective Hamiltonian models suffer from key limitations: some require to manually predefine interaction terms limited flexibility in capturing complex systems, while others lack efficiency in selecting optimal interactions. In this work, we introduce the Lasso-GA Hybrid Method (LGHM), a novel approach that combines Lasso regression and genetic algorithms to rapidly construct effective Hamiltonian models. Such method is broadly applicable to both magnetic systems (e.g., spin Hamiltonians) and atomic displacement models. To verify the reliability and usefulness of LGHM, we take monolayer CrI_3 and Fe_3 GaTe_2 as examples. In both cases, LGHM not only successfully identifies key interaction terms with high fitting accuracy, but also reproduces experimental magnetic ground states and Curie temperatures with further Monte Carlo simulations. Notable, our analysis of monolayer Fe_3 GaTe_2 reveals that the single-ion anisotropy and Heisenberg interaction lead to an out-of-plane ferromagnetic ground state, while the fourth-order interactions contribute significantly to the high Curie temperature. Our method is general so it can be applied to construct other effective Hamiltonian models.

Title: Enhancing the Dynamic Range of Quantum Sensing via Quantum Circuit Learning
Authors: Hideaki Kawaguchi, Yuichiro Mori, Takahiko Satoh, Yuichiro Matsuzaki
Abstract: Quantum metrology is a promising application of quantum technologies, enabling the precise measurement of weak external fields at a local scale. In typical quantum sensing protocols, a qubit interacts with an external field, and the amplitude of the field is estimated by analyzing the expectation value of a measured observable. Sensitivity can, in principle, be enhanced by increasing the number of qubits within a fixed volume, thereby maintaining spatial resolution. However, at high qubit densities, inter-qubit interactions induce complex many-body dynamics, resulting in multiple oscillations in the expectation value of the observable even for small field amplitudes. This ambiguity reduces the dynamic range of the sensing protocol. We propose a method to overcome the limitation in quantum metrology by adopting a quantum circuit learning framework using a parameterized quantum circuit to approximate a target function by optimizing the circuit parameters. In our method, after the qubits interact with the external field, we apply a sequence of parameterized quantum gates and measure a suitable observable. By optimizing the gate parameters, the expectation value is trained to exhibit a monotonic response within a target range of field amplitudes, thereby eliminating multiple oscillations and enhancing the dynamic range. This method offers a strategy for improving quantum sensing performance in dense qubit systems.

Title: Discrete time crystal for periodic-field sensing with quantum-enhanced precision
Authors: Rozhin Yousefjani, Saif Al-Kuwari, Abolfazl Bayat
Abstract: Sensing periodic-fields using quantum sensors has been an active field of research. In many of these scenarios, the quantum state of the probe is flipped regularly by the application of ${\pi}$-pulses to accumulate information about the target periodic-field. The emergence of a discrete time crystalline phase, as a nonequilibrium phase of matter, naturally provides oscillations in a many-body system with an inherent controllable frequency. They benefit from long coherence time and robustness against imperfections, which makes them excellent potential quantum sensors. In this paper, through theoretical and numerical analysis, we show that a disorder-free discrete time crystal probe can reach the ultimate achievable precision for sensing a periodic-field. As the amplitude of the periodic-field increases, the discrete time crystalline order diminishes, and the performance of the probe decreases remarkably. Nevertheless, the obtained quantum enhancement in the discrete time crystal phase shows robustness against different imperfections in the protocol. Finally, we propose the implementation of our protocol in ultra-cold atoms in optical lattices.

Title: Planar fault-tolerant circuits for non-Clifford gates on the 2D color code
Authors: Andreas Bauer, Julio C. Magdalena de la Fuente
Abstract: We introduce a family of scalable planar fault-tolerant circuits that implement logical non-Clifford operations on a 2D color code, such as a logical $T$ gate or a logical non-Pauli measurement that prepares a magic $|T\rangle$ state. The circuits are relatively simple, consisting only of physical $T$ gates, $CX$ gates, and few-qubit measurements. They can be implemented with an array of qubits on a 2D chip with nearest-neighbor couplings, and no wire crossings. The construction is based on a spacetime path integral representation of a non-Abelian 2+1D topological phase, which is related to the 3D color code. We turn the path integral into a circuit by expressing it as a spacetime $ZX$ tensor network, and then traversing it in some chosen time direction. We describe in detail how fault tolerance is achieved using a "just-in-time" decoding strategy, for which we repurpose and extend state-of-the-art color-code matching decoders.

Title: Extended Tsallis-Cirto entropy for black and white holes
Authors: G.E. Volovik
Abstract: In reference [1] we considered the black hole thermodynamics with the non-extensive entropy. This entropy obeys the composition rule which coincides with the composition rule in the non-extensive Tsallis-Cirto $\delta=2$ statistics. Here we extend this approach to the thermodynamics of white holes. The entropy of the white hole is negative as follows from the rate of macroscopic quantum tunneling from black hole to white hole. The white hole entropy is with the minus sign the entropy of the black hole with the same mass, $S_{\rm WH}(M)=-S_{\rm BH}(M)$. This reflects the anti-symmetry with respect to time reversal, at which the shift vector in the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner formalism changes sign. This symmetry allows one to extend the Tsallis-Chirto entropy by adding a minus sign to the Tsallis-Chirto formula applied to white hole. As a result, the composition rule remains the same, with the only difference being that instead of entropy it contains the entropy modulus. The same non-extensive composition rule is obtained for the entropy of the Reissner-Nordström black hole. This entropy is formed by the positive entropy of the outer horizon and the negative entropy of the inner horizon. The model of the black hole formed by "black hole atoms" with Planck-scale mass is also extended to include the negative entropy of white holes.

Title: Something about the Mechanism of Induction: The forgotten work of Berta de Haas-Lorentz on diamagnetism in superconductors
Authors: Giulia Venditti, Carlo Beenakker, Louk Rademaker
Abstract: In 1925, Dr. Geertruida Luberta "Berta" de Haas-Lorentz published the paper "Iets over het mechanisme van inductieverschijnselen" in the journal Physica. Her paper was the first to discuss perfect diamagnetism of superconductors, eight years before the discovery of the Meissner effect. Unfortunately, her work was almost forgotten by the scientific community. To counter this, we translate her seminal 1925 paper from Dutch into English. We provide an overview of the life of Dr. De Haas-Lorentz, and comment on her pioneering contribution to the theory of superconductivity.

Authors: Martin Selin, Antonio Ciarlo, Giuseppe Pesce, Lars Bengtsson, Joan Camunas-Soler, Vinoth Sundar Rajan, Fredrik Westerlund, L. Marcus Wilhelmsson, Isabel Pastor, Felix Ritort, Steven B. Smith, Carlos Bustamante, Giovanni Volpe
Abstract: There is a trend in research towards more automation using smart systems powered by artificial intelligence. While experiments are often challenging to automate, they can greatly benefit from automation by reducing labor and increasing reproducibility. For example, optical tweezers are widely employed in single-molecule biophysics, cell biomechanics, and soft matter physics, but they still require a human operator, resulting in low throughput and limited repeatability. Here, we present a smart optical tweezers platform, which we name SmartTrap, capable of performing complex experiments completely autonomously. SmartTrap integrates real-time 3D particle tracking using deep learning, custom electronics for precise feedback control, and a microfluidic setup for particle handling. We demonstrate the ability of SmartTrap to operate continuously, acquiring high-precision data over extended periods of time, through a series of experiments. By bridging the gap between manual experimentation and autonomous operation, SmartTrap establishes a robust and open source framework for the next generation of optical tweezers research, capable of performing large-scale studies in single-molecule biophysics, cell mechanics, and colloidal science with reduced experimental overhead and operator bias.

Abstract: Stochastic magnetic tunnel junctions (s-MTJs) are core components for spintronics-based probabilistic computing (p-computing), a promising candidate for energy-efficient unconventional computing. To achieve reliable performance under practical conditions, the use of a synthetic antiferromagnetic (SAF) free-layer configuration was proposed due to its enhanced tolerance to magnetic field perturbations. For engineering the SAF s-MTJs, we systematically investigate the properties of the SAF s-MTJs as a function of the junction size. We observe that decreasing junction size leads to shorter relaxation times, enhanced magnetic field robustness, and enhanced insensitivity to bias voltage. These findings provide key insights toward high-performance p-computers with reliable operation.

Title: Open quantum systems with particle and bath driven by time-dependent fields
Authors: Daniele Gamba, Bingyu Cui, Alessio Zaccone
Abstract: We derive a generalized quantum Langevin equation and its fluctuation-dissipation relation describing the quantum dynamics of a tagged particle interacting with a medium (environment), where both the particle and the environment are driven by an external time-dependent (e.g. oscillating) field. We specialize on the case of a charged tagged particle interacting with a bath of charged oscillators, under an external AC electric field, although the results are much more general and can be applied to any type of external time-dependent fields. We derive the corresponding quantum Langevin equation, which obeys a modified fluctuation-dissipation relation where the external field plays an explicit role. Using these results, we provide an illustration of their usefulness and derive a new form of the quantum Nyquist noise for the voltage fluctuations in electrical circuits under AC conditions (finite frequency), which is the most general since it also accounts for the response of the heat bath (e.g. lattice ions) to the applied AC electric field in the GHz-THz region, of relevance for 5G/6G wireless technologies. This generalized quantum fluctuation-dissipation relation for driven systems can also find other applications ranging from quantum noise in quantum optics to quantum computing with trapped ions.

Title: An analytical exploration of the optomechanical attractor diagram and of limit cycles
Authors: Jorge G. Russo, Miguel Tierz
Abstract: We analyse the interplay between mechanical and radiation pressure in an optomechanical cavity system. Our study is based on an analytical evaluation of the infinite Bessel summations involved, which previously had led to a numerical exploration of the so-called attractor diagram. The analytical expressions are then suitable for further asymptotic analysis in opposing regimes of the amplitude, which allows for a characterisation of the diagram in terms of elementary functions. The same method is applied to the study of optomechanical limit cycles, extending previous results for enhanced values of the parameter space without the need for approximations such as the resolved sideband approximation.

Title: BraWl: Simulating the thermodynamics and phase stability of multicomponent alloys using conventional and enhanced sampling techniques
Authors: Hubert J. Naguszewski, Livia B. Pártay, David Quigley, Christopher D. Woodgate
Abstract: We present BraWl, a Fortran package implementing a range of conventional and enhanced sampling algorithms for exploration of the phase space of the Bragg-Williams model, facilitating study of diffusional solid-solid transformations in binary and multicomponent alloys. These sampling algorithms include Metropolis-Hastings Monte Carlo, Wang-Landau sampling, and Nested Sampling. We demonstrate the capabilities of the package by applying it to some prototypical binary and multicomponent alloys, including high-entropy alloys.

Title: Robustly optimal dynamics for active matter reservoir computing
Authors: Mario U. Gaimann, Miriam Klopotek
Abstract: We study the information processing abilities of active matter in the reservoir computing (RC) paradigm, using a model that is externally driven to infer the future state of a chaotic signal. The simulated system closely follows a previously reported model. We uncover an exceptional dynamical regime of agent dynamics that has been overlooked heretofore. It appears robustly optimal across varying physical parameters and inference tasks, thus providing valuable insights into computation and inference with physical systems more generally. The ability to form effective mechanisms for information processing are primarily determined by the system's own intrinsic relaxation abilities. These are identifiable when probing the system without a specific inference goal and manifest when testing minimalistic single-particle reservoirs. The regime that achieves optimal computation is situated just below the critical damping threshold, involving a microscopic dynamical relaxation with multiple stages. The optimal system is adaptable under chaotic external driving, due to a diversity in response mechanisms that emerge like rapid alternations between quasi-stationary and highly nonlinear dynamical states. Both coherent and incoherent dynamics contribute to their operation, partly at dissimilar scales of space and delay time. Correlations on agent dynamics can indicate the best-performing regimes and onsets of tight relationships between the responding system and the fluctuating driver. As this model of computation is interpretable in physical terms, it facilitates re-framing inquiries regarding learning and unconventional computing with a fresh rationale for many-body physics out of equilibrium.

Title: Asymmetric decay of quantum many-body scars in XYZ quantum spin chains
Authors: Dhiman Bhowmick, Vir B. Bulchandani, Wen Wei Ho
Abstract: Quantum many-body scars are atypical energy eigenstates of chaotic quantum many-body systems that prevent certain special non-equilibrium initial conditions from thermalizing. We point out that quantum many-body scars exist for any nearest-neighbor spin-$S$ XYZ quantum spin chain, and arise in the form of an infinite family of highly excited yet nonentangled product-state eigenstates, which define periodic textures in spin space. This set of scars, discovered originally by Granovskii and Zhedanov in 1985, encompasses both the experimentally relevant 'spin helices' for XXZ chains and more complicated helix-like states constructed from Jacobi elliptic functions for generic XYZ chains. An appealing feature of Granovskii-Zhedanov scars is that they are well-defined in the semiclassical limit $S \to \infty$, which allows for a systematic and analytical treatment of their dynamical instability to perturbations of the Hamiltonian. Using time-dependent spin-wave theory, we predict that upon perturbing along certain directions in Hamiltonian space, Granovskii-Zhedanov scars exhibit a dramatic asymmetry in their decay: depending on the sign of the perturbation, the decrease of their contrast is either slow and linear, or fast and exponential in time. This asymmetry can be traced to the absence (presence) of imaginarity in the spectrum of the Bogoliubov Hamiltonian governing quantum fluctuations about the scar, which corresponds to the absence (presence) of a non-zero Lyapunov exponent for the limiting classical trajectory. Numerical simulations using matrix product states (MPS) and infinite time-evolving block decimation (iTEBD) confirm that our prediction remains valid even far from the semiclassical limit. Our findings challenge existing theories of how quantum-many body scars relax.

Title: Cell size heterogeneity controls crystallization of the developing fruit fly wing
Authors: Kartik Chhajed, Franz S. Gruber, Natalie A. Dye, Frank Jülicher, Marko Popović
Abstract: A fundamental question in Biology is to understand how patterns and shapes emerge from the collective interplay of large numbers of cells. Cells forming two-dimensional epithelial tissues behave as active materials that undergo remodeling and spontaneous shape changes. Focussing on the fly wing as a model system, we find that the cellular packing in the wing epithelium transitions from a disordered packing to an ordered, crystalline packing. We investigate biophysical mechanisms controlling this crystallization process. While previous studies propose a role of tissue shear flow in establishing the ordered cell packing in the fly wing, we reveal a role of cell size heterogeneity. Indeed, we find that even if tissue shear have been inhibited, cell packings in the fruit fly wing epithelium transition from disordered to an ordered packing. We propose that the transition is controlled by the cell size heterogeneity, which is quantified by the cell size polydispersity. We use the vertex model of epithelial tissues to show that there is a critical value of cell size polydispersity above which cellular packings are disordered and below which they form a crystalline packing. By analyzing experimental data we find that cell size polydispersity decreases during fly wing development. The observed dynamics of tissue crystallisation is consistent with the slow ordering kinetics we observe in the vertex model. Therefore, although tissue shear does not control the transition, it significantly enhances the rate of tissue scale ordering by facilitating alingment of locally ordered crystallites.

Title: Universal Correlations in Local Measurements Directly Probe Effective Diffusivity
Authors: Omer Granek
Abstract: Measuring transport coefficients at the microscale remains challenging, often relying on indirect methods that require modeling and calibration. This Letter derives universal asymptotic forms for the autocorrelation and relative uncertainty of local probe measurements in dilute diffusive systems. Valid both at and far from equilibrium, these forms directly connect microscopic measurements to the effective diffusivity. Indirect methods such as dynamic light scattering and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy are thereby elevated to asymptotically direct probes. They become capable of measuring the effective diffusivity of active and other microscopically nondiffusive systems. Simulations across several models confirm the broad applicability of these predictions.

Title: Flux enhanced localization and reentrant delocalization in the quench dynamics of two interacting bosons on a Bose-Hubbard ladder
Authors: Mrinal Kanti Giri, Biswajit Paul, Tapan Mishra
Abstract: We study the quench dynamics of two bosons possessing onsite repulsive interaction on a two-leg ladder and show that the presence of uniform flux piercing through the plaquettes of the ladder favors the localization of the bound states in the dynamics. We find that when the two bosons are symmetrically initialized on the edge rung of the ladder, they tend to edge-localize in their quantum walk - a phenomenon which is not possible in the absence of flux. On the other hand, when the bosons are initialized on the bulk rung they never localize and exhibit linear spreading in their quantum walk. Interestingly, however, we find that in the later case a finite flux favours localization of the bulk bound states in the presence of sufficiently weak quasiperiodic disorder which is otherwise insufficient to localize the particles in the absence of flux. In both the cases, we obtain that the localization in the dynamics strongly depends on the combined effect of the flux and interaction strengths, as a result which we obtain a signature of re-entrant delocalization as a function of flux (interaction) for fixed interaction (flux) strengths.

Title: Defining classical and quantum chaos through adiabatic transformations
Authors: Cedric Lim, Kirill Matirko, Hyeongjin Kim, Anatoli Polkovnikov, Michael O. Flynn
Abstract: We propose a formalism which defines chaos in both quantum and classical systems in an equivalent manner by means of \textit{adiabatic transformations}. The complexity of adiabatic transformations which preserve classical time-averaged trajectories (quantum eigenstates) in response to Hamiltonian deformations serves as a measure of chaos. This complexity is quantified by the (properly regularized) fidelity susceptibility. Physically this measure quantifies long time instabilities of physical observables due to small changes in the Hamiltonian of the system. Our exposition clearly showcases the common structures underlying quantum and classical chaos and allows us to distinguish integrable, chaotic but non-thermalizing, and ergodic/mixing regimes. We apply the fidelity susceptibility to a model of two coupled spins and demonstrate that it successfully predicts the universal onset of chaos, both for finite spin $S$ and in the classical limit $S\to\infty$. Interestingly, we find that finite $S$ effects are anomalously large close to integrability.

Title: Magnetic signatures of pressure-induced multicomponent superconductivity in UTe$_2$
Authors: Zheyu Wu, Jiasheng Chen, Theodore. I. Weinberger, Andrej Cabala, Vladimir Sechovsky, Michal Valiska, Patricia L. Alireza, Alexander G. Eaton, F. Malte Grosche
Abstract: The phase diagram of the heavy fermion compound UTe$_2$ contains multiple superconducting phases, several of which show characteristics of odd-parity pairing. We have investigated the pressure dependence of the superconducting transition in high-quality crystals of UTe$_2$ by tracking its signature in the magnetic susceptibility $\chi(T)$. A single, sharp superconducting transition is observed at low pressures 0.3 GPa. At higher pressure, a second feature emerges in $\chi(T)$, which is located at the lower-temperature thermodynamic phase boundary previously identified in specific heat measurements. This second transition anomaly in $\chi(T)$ can be attributed to a step change in the London penetration depth, providing direct evidence for a change in the superconducting order parameter of UTe$_2$. Thermodynamic constraints suggest that the low temperature, high pressure superconducting state is distinct from zero pressure superconductivity as well as from the high pressure, high temperature superconducting state, raising the possibility of multicomponent superconductivity in high pressure UTe$_2$.

Title: Fingerprints of Mott and Slater gaps in the core-level photoemission spectra of antiferromagnetic iridates
Authors: K. Nakagawa, A. Hariki, T. Okauchi, H. Fujiwara, K.-H. Ahn, Y. Murakami, S. Hamamoto, Y. Kanai-Nakata, T. Kadono, A. Higashiya, K. Tamasaku, M. Yabashi, T. Ishikawa, A. Sekiyama, S. Imada, J. Kuneš, K. Takase, A. Yamasaki
Abstract: We present Ir $4f$ core-level hard-x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (HAXPES) experiments conducted across antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering transition in Ruddlesden-Popper iridates Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ and Sr$_3$Ir$_2$O$_7$. The Ir $4f$ spectra exhibit distinct changes between the AFM and paramagnetic (PM) phases, with the spectral difference $I_\text{PM}-I_\text{AFM}$ showing a contrasting behavior in the two compounds. By employing computational simulations using the local-density approximation combined with the dynamical mean-field theory method, we elucidate that $I_\text{PM}-I_\text{AFM}$ primary reflects the Slater or Mott-Hubbard character of the AFM insulating state rather than material specific details. This sensitivity to fine low-energy electronic structure arises from the dependence of charge-transfer responses to the sudden creation of a localized core hole on both metal-insulator transitions and long-range AFM ordering. Our result broadens the applications of core-level HAXPES as a tool for characterization of electronic structure.

Title: Topological Insulators with Hybrid-order Boundary States
Authors: Yan-Qing Zhu, Zhen Zheng, Giandomenico Palumbo, Z. D. Wang
Abstract: We report the discovery of several classes of novel topological insulators (TIs) with hybrid-order boundary states generated from the first-order TIs with additional crystalline symmetries. Unlike the current studies on hybrid-order TIs where different-order topology arises from merging different-order TIs in various energy, {\color{red} these novel TIs exhibit unique properties, featuring a remarkable coexistence of first-order gapless modes and higher-order Fermi arc states}, behaving as a hybrid between the first-order TIs and higher-order topological semimetals within a single bulk gap. Our findings establish a profound connection between these novel $d$-dimensional ($d$D) TIs and ($d-1$)D higher-order TIs (HOTIs), which can be understood as a result of stacking $(d-1)$D HOTIs to $d$D with $d=3,4$, revealing unconventional topological phase transitions by closing the gap in certain first-order boundaries rather than the bulk. The bulk-boundary correspondence between these higher-order Fermi-arcs and bulk topological invariants associated with additional crystalline symmetries is also demonstrated. We then address the conventional topological phase transitions from these novel TIs to nodal-line/nodal-surface semimetal phases, where the gapless phases host new kinds of topological responses. Meanwhile, we present the corresponding topological semimetal phases by stacking these unique TIs. Finally, we discuss potential ways to realize these novel phases in synthetic and real materials, with a particular focus on the feasible implementation in optical lattices using ultracold atoms.

Title: Dynamical Freezing in Exactly Solvable Models of Driven Chaotic Quantum Dots
Authors: Haoyu Guo, Rohit Mukherjee, Debanjan Chowdhury
Abstract: The late-time equilibrium behavior of generic interacting models is determined by the coupled hydrodynamic equations associated with the globally conserved quantities. In the presence of an external time-dependent drive, non-integrable systems typically thermalize to an effectively infinite-temperature state, losing all memory of their initial states. However, in the presence of a large time-periodic Floquet drive, there exist special points in phase-space where the strongly interacting system develops approximate {\it emergent} conservation laws. Here we present results for an exactly solvable model of two coupled chaotic quantum dots with multiple orbitals interacting via random two and four-fermion interactions in the presence of a Floquet drive. We analyze the phenomenology of dynamically generated freezing using a combination of exact diagonalization, and field-theoretic analysis in the limit of a large number of electronic orbitals. The model displays universal freezing behavior irrespective of whether the theory is averaged over the disorder configurations or not. We present explicit computations for the growth of many-body chaos and entanglement entropy, which demonstrates the long-lived coherence associated with the interacting degrees of freedom even at late-times at the dynamically frozen points. We also compute the slow timescale that controls relaxation away from exact freezing in a high-frequency expansion.

Title: The formation of a nuclear-spin dark state in silicon
Authors: Xinxin Cai, Habitamu Y. Walelign, John M. Nichol
Abstract: Silicon-based qubits are often made by trapping individual electrons in quantum dots defined by electric gates. Quantum information can then be stored using the spin states of the electrons. However, the nuclei of the surrounding atoms also have spin degrees of freedom that couple to the electron spin qubits and cause decoherence. The emergence of a nuclear-spin dark state has been predicted to reduce this coupling during dynamic nuclear polarization, when the electrons in the quantum dot drive the nuclei in the semiconductor into a decoupled state. Here, we report the formation of a nuclear-spin dark state in a gate-defined silicon double quantum dot. We show that, as expected, the transverse electron-nuclear coupling rapidly diminishes in the dark state, and that this state depends on the synchronized precession of the nuclear spins. Moreover, the dark state significantly reduces the relaxation rate between the singlet and triplet electronic spin states. This nuclear-spin dark state has potential applications as a quantum memory or in quantum sensing, and might enable increased polarization of nuclear spin ensembles.

Title: Fractionalization of Coset Non-Invertible Symmetry and Exotic Hall Conductance
Authors: Po-Shen Hsin, Ryohei Kobayashi, Carolyn Zhang
Abstract: We investigate fractionalization of non-invertible symmetry in (2+1)D topological orders. We focus on coset non-invertible symmetries obtained by gauging non-normal subgroups of invertible $0$-form symmetries. These symmetries can arise as global symmetries in quantum spin liquids, given by the quotient of the projective symmetry group by a non-normal subgroup as invariant gauge group. We point out that such coset non-invertible symmetries in topological orders can exhibit symmetry fractionalization: each anyon can carry a "fractional charge" under the coset non-invertible symmetry given by a gauge invariant superposition of fractional quantum numbers. We present various examples using field theories and quantum double lattice models, such as fractional quantum Hall systems with charge conjugation symmetry gauged and finite group gauge theory from gauging a non-normal subgroup. They include symmetry enriched $S_3$ and $O(2)$ gauge theories. We show that such systems have a fractionalized continuous non-invertible coset symmetry and a well-defined electric Hall conductance. The coset symmetry enforces a gapless edge state if the boundary preserves the continuous non-invertible symmetry. We propose a general approach for constructing coset symmetry defects using a "sandwich" construction: non-invertible symmetry defects can generally be constructed from an invertible defect sandwiched by condensation defects. The anomaly free condition for finite coset symmetry is also identified.

Title: Topological protection breakdown: a route to frustrated ferroelectricity
Authors: Ludovica Falsi, Pablo Villegas, Tommaso Gili, Aharon J. Agranat, Eugenio DelRe
Abstract: Phases manifesting topological patterns in functional systems, like ferroelectric and ferromagnetic vortex superlattices, are typically frustrated non-ergodic states characterized by high-dimensional energy landscapes with intricate and apparently ungovernable behavior. This is also the case for potassium-tantalate-niobate (KTN) crystals. These transparent ferroelectrics manifest remarkable but little-understood metastable domain patterns at optical (micrometer and above) scales near the cubic-to-tetragonal structural phase transition. Here, we formulate the Topological Breakdown Model based on the competition between intrinsic scales of domain-domain collinear and non-collinear interactions associated with polarization-charge screening. The model is able to explain the KTN mesoscopic domain patterns and phase diagram as a function of temperature and external electric field. Findings include a precise set of sharp and broad percolative transitions that are experimentally verified, validating the model. Our study identifies the central role played by competing topologically protected states, identifying the fundamental link between topological protection and frustration that supports a hitherto unexplored functional non-ergodic arena.

Title: The Decrease of Static Friction Coefficient with Interface Growth from Single to Multiasperity Contact
Authors: Liang Peng, Thibault Roch, Daniel Bonn, Bart Weber
Abstract: The key parameter for describing frictional strength at the onset of sliding is the static friction coefficient. Yet, how the static friction coefficient emerges at the macroscale from contacting asperities at the microscale is still an open problem. Here, we present friction experiments in which the normal load was varied over more than 3 orders of magnitude, so that a transition from a single asperity contact at low loads to multiasperity contacts at high loads was achieved. We find a remarkable reduction in the friction drop (the ratio of the static friction force to the dynamic friction force) with increasing normal load. Using a simple stick-slip transition model we identify the presence of presliding and subcritical contact points as the cause of smaller static friction coefficient at increased normal loads. Our measurements and model bridge the gap between friction behavior commonly observed in atomic force microscopy experiments at microscopic forces, and industrially relevant multiasperity contact interfaces loaded with macroscopic forces.

Title: Topologically-enhanced exciton transport
Authors: Joshua J. P. Thompson, Wojciech J. Jankowski, Robert-Jan Slager, Bartomeu Monserrat
Abstract: Excitons dominate the optoelectronic response of many materials. Depending on the time scale and host material, excitons can exhibit free diffusion, phonon-limited diffusion, or polaronic diffusion, and exciton transport often limits the efficiency of optoelectronic devices such as solar cells or photodetectors. We demonstrate that topological excitons exhibit enhanced diffusion in all transport regimes. Using quantum geometry, we find that topological excitons are generically larger and more dispersive than their trivial counterparts, promoting their diffusion. We apply this general theory to organic polyacene semiconductors and show that exciton transport increases up to fourfold when topological excitons are present. We also propose that non-uniform electric fields can be used to directly probe the quantum metric of excitons, providing a rare experimental window into a basic geometric feature of quantum states. Our results provide a new strategy to enhance exciton transport in semiconductors and reveal that mathematical ideas of topology and quantum geometry can be important ingredients in the design of next-generation optoelectronic technologies.

Title: Intrinsic Electrochemical Limits Preceding Dendrite Penetration in Ceramic Electrolytes
Authors: Rajeev Gopal, Peng Bai
Abstract: Solid-state electrolytes have the potential to stabilize lithium metal anodes, which hold the promise to increase the energy density of lithium-ion batteries. However, lithium metal dendrites that occur locally at the solid-solid interface plague the solid-state lithium metal cells during charging, limiting the cycle life, and rendering high safety risks in practical applications. While multiple explanations have been proposed, understandings of the dynamics preceding and causing the metal penetration in solid electrolytes are still not conclusive. Here, by testing many highly consistent Ta-doped Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZTO) samples and utilizing an improved operando technique on symmetrical cells, we observed a consistent and statistically significant trend of current-dependent dendrite initiation time, which coincides with the Sand's time scaling in liquid electrolytes. This new understanding offers an electrochemical origin of dendritic initiation but also provides future insight into optimal all-solid-state battery design.

Title: Statistical field theory of random graphs with prescribed degrees
Authors: Pawat Akara-pipattana, Oleg Evnin
Abstract: Statistical field theory methods have been very successful with a number of random graph and random matrix problems, but it is challenging to apply these methods to graphs with prescribed degree sequences due to the extensive number of constraints that enforce the desired degree at each vertex. Building on top of recent results where similar methods are applied to random regular graph counting, we develop an accurate statistical field theory description for the adjacency matrix spectra of graphs with prescribed degrees. For large graphs, the expectation values are dominated by functional saddle points satisfying explicit equations. For the case of regular graphs, this immediately leads to the known McKay distribution. We then consider mixed-regular graphs with N1 vertices of degree d1, N2 vertices of degree d2, etc, such that the ratios N_i/N are kept fixed as N goes to infinity. For such graphs, the eigenvalue densities are governed by nonlinear integral equations of the Hammerstein type. Solving these equations numerically reproduces with an excellent accuracy the empirical eigenvalue distributions.

Title: Torus bifurcation of a dissipative time crystal
Authors: Jayson G. Cosme, Phatthamon Kongkhambut, Anton Bölian, Richelle Jade L. Tuquero, Jim Skulte, Ludwig Mathey, Andreas Hemmerich, Hans Keßler
Abstract: Using a quantum gas setup consisting of a Bose-Einstein condensate strongly coupled to a high-finesse optical cavity by a transverse pump laser, we experimentally observe an instability of a dissipative continuous time crystal (CTC) towards a time crystalline state exhibiting two prominent oscillation frequencies. Applying a mean-field approximation model and a Floquet analysis, we theoretically confirm that this transition is a manifestation in a many-body system of a torus bifurcation between a limit cycle (LC) and a limit torus (LT). We theoretically illustrate the LC and LT attractors using the minimal model and experimentally reconstruct them using Takens' embedding theorem applied to the non-destructively measured intracavity photon dynamics.

Title: The origin of strings and rings in the atomic dynamics of disordered systems
Authors: Omar Hussein, Yang Li, Y. Mishin
Abstract: It has long been believed that the atomic dynamics in disordered structures, such as undercooled liquids and pre-melted interfaces, are characterized by collective atomic rearrangements in the form of quasi-one-dimensional chains of atomic displacements (strings) and their closed forms (rings). Here, we show by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations that strings involving more than a few atoms do not form by a single collective event. Instead, they represent trajectories of propagating local density perturbations, which we call densitons. The atoms on this trajectory are almost indistinguishable from their environments except for the moving head of the string (densiton). A densiton migrates by either single-atom jumps or a concerted rearrangement of 2-3 atoms. The simulations reveal a remarkable similarity between the strings in disordered and crystalline structures, in which the densitons localize into point defects. This work calls for a significant reinterpretation of the string concept and instead proposes a densiton model of the atomic dynamics.

Title: In-poor IGZO: superior resilience to hydrogen in forming gas anneal and PBTI
Authors: A. Kruv, M. J. van Setten, A. Chasin, D. Matsubayashi, H. F. W. Dekkers, A. Pavel, Y. Wan, K. Trivedi, N. Rassoul, J. Li, Y. Jiang, S. Subhechha, G. Pourtois, A. Belmonte, G. Sankar Kar
Abstract: Integrating In-Ga-Zn-oxide (IGZO) channel transistors in silicon-based ecosystems requires the resilience of the channel material to hydrogen treatment. Standard IGZO, containing 40% In (metal ratio) suffers from degradation under forming gas anneal (FGA) and hydrogen (H) driven positive bias temperature instability (PBTI). We demonstrate scaled top-gated ALD transistors with an In-poor (In $\le$ 17%) IGZO channel that show superior resilience to hydrogen compared to the In-rich (In=40%) counterpart. The devices, fabricated with a 300-mm FAB process with dimensions down to $W_\mathrm{CH} \times L_\mathrm{TG} = 80 \times 40 \mathrm{nm}^2$, show excellent stability in 2-hour 420$^\circ$C forming gas anneal ($0.06 \le \left| \Delta V_{\mathrm{TH}} \right| \le 0.33\mathrm{V}$) and improved resilience to H in PBTI at 125$^\circ$C (down to no detectable H-induced $V_{\mathrm{TH}}$ shift) compared to In-rich devices. We demonstrate that the device degradation by H in the FGA is different from the H-induced VTH instability in PBTI, namely oxygen scavenging by H and H release from a gate-dielectric into the channel, respectively, and that resilience to H in one process does not automatically translate to resilience to H in the other one. This significant improvement in IGZO resilience to H enables the use of FGA treatments during fabrication needed for silicon technology compatibility, as well as further scaling and 3D integration, bringing IGZO-based technologies closer to mass production.

Title: Interacting Virtual Topological Phases in Defect-Rich 2D Materials
Authors: Felipe Crasto de Lima, Roberto H. Miwa, Caio Lewenkopf, Adalberto Fazzio
Abstract: We investigate the robustness of {\it virtual} topological states -- topological phases away from the Fermi energy -- against the electron-electron interaction and band filling. As a case study, we employ a realistic model to investigate the properties of vacancy-driven topological phases in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and establish a connection between the degree of localization of topological wave functions, the vacancy density, and the electron-electron interaction strength with the topological phase robustness. We demonstrate that electron-electron interactions play a crucial role in degrading topological phases thereby determining the validity of single-particle approximations for topological insulator phases. Our findings can be naturally extended to {\it virtual} topological phases of a wide range of materials.

Title: Ferrimagnetic Kitaev spin liquids in mixed spin 1/2 spin 3/2 honeycomb magnets
Authors: Willian Natori, Yang Yang, Hui-Ke Jin, Johannes Knolle, Natalia B. Perkins
Abstract: We explore the potential experimental realization of the mixed-spin Kitaev model in materials such as Zr$_{0.5}$Ru$_{0.5}$Cl$_3$, where spin-1/2 and spin-3/2 ions occupy distinct sublattices of a honeycomb lattice. By developing a superexchange theory specifically for this mixed-spin system, we identify the conditions under which dominant Kitaev-like interactions emerge. Focusing on the limiting case of pure Kitaev coupling with single-ion anisotropy, we employ a combination of superexchange theory, parton mean-field theory, and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations. We establish a comprehensive ground-state phase diagram identifying four distinct quantum spin liquid phases. Our findings highlight the importance of spin-orbital couplings and quadrupolar order parameters in stabilizing exotic phases, providing a foundation for exploring mixed-spin Kitaev magnets.

Title: Origin of Subharmonic Gap Structure of DC Current-Biased Josephson Junctions
Authors: Aritra Lahiri, Sang-Jun Choi, Björn Trauzettel
Abstract: The current-voltage characteristics of Josephson junctions exhibit a subharmonic gap structure (SGS), denoting jumps at specific voltages. While the prevalent multiple Andreev reflection theory matches the experimentally observed SGS, it is limited to a DC \emph{voltage} bias. For a DC \emph{current} bias, existing theories are restricted to low-transparency junctions and fail to capture the full SGS. We introduce a microscopic Floquet approach applicable for arbitrary transparencies, and recover the correct SGS for a DC \emph{current} bias. We provide a comprehensive understanding of SGS for a DC \emph{current} bias, which entails two-quasiparticle tunneling processes absent in existing theories, via two complementary perspectives: in the frequency domain, as generalised Andreev reflections absorbing multiple energies, and in the time domain, as the interference of non-equilibrium current pulses.

Title: Emergent short-range repulsion for attractively coupled active particles
Authors: Ritwick Sarkar, Urna Basu
Abstract: We show that heterogeneity in self-propulsion speed can lead to the emergence of a robust effective short-range repulsion among active particles interacting via long-range attractive potentials. Using the example of harmonically coupled active Brownian particles, we analytically derive the stationary distribution of the pairwise distances and reveal that the heterogeneity in propulsion speeds induces a characteristic scale of repulsion between particles. This length scale algebraically increases with the difference in their self-propulsion speeds. In contrast to the conventional view that activity in active matter systems typically leads to effective attraction, our results demonstrate that activity can give rise to an emergent repulsive interaction. This phenomenon is universal, independent of the specific dynamics of the particles or the presence of thermal fluctuations. We also discuss possible experimental realization of this counter-intuitive phenomenon.

Title: Universal Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials are Ready for Phonons
Authors: Antoine Loew, Dewen Sun, Hai-Chen Wang, Silvana Botti, Miguel A. L. Marques
Abstract: There has been an ongoing race for the past several years to develop the best universal machinelearning interatomic potential. This progress has led to increasingly accurate models for predictingenergy, forces, and stresses, combining innovative architectures with big data. Here, we benchmarkthese models on their ability to predict harmonic phonon properties, which are critical for under-standing the vibrational and thermal behavior of materials. Using around 10 000 ab initio phononcalculations, we evaluate model performance across various phonon-related parameters to test theuniversal applicability of these models. The results reveal that some models achieve high accuracyin predicting harmonic phonon properties. However, others still exhibit substantial inaccuracies,even if they excel in the prediction of the energy and the forces for materials close to dynamicalequilibrium. These findings highlight the importance of considering phonon-related properties inthe development of universal machine learning interatomic potentials.

Title: Precursors to Anderson Localization in the Holstein Model: Quantum and Quantum-Classical Solutions
Authors: Petar Mitrić, Vladimir Dobrosavljević, Darko Tanasković
Abstract: We calculate the frequency-dependent mobility of the Holstein polaron in one dimension near adiabatic limit using the method based on dynamical quantum tipicality, as well as the quantum-classical method. The agreement between fully quantum and quantum-classical solutions is very good. The most prominent feature is the appearance of a zero-frequency peak in the mobility, in addition to the displaced peak associated to the precursors of Anderson localization. The zero-frequency peak cannot be obtained within the phenomenological transient localization approach, which is often used in a semiquantitative description of charge transport in quasi-one-dimensional organic semiconductors.

Title: Probing Sign-Changing Order Parameters via Impurity States in unconventional superconductors: Implications for La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ Superconductors with interlayer pairing
Authors: Junkang Huang, Z. D. Wang, Tao Zhou
Abstract: Motivated by the desire to investigate the fundamental relationship between impurity-induced states and the sign change of the superconducting order parameter, as well as to explore the impurity effects in Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate superconductors with interlayer pairing, we employ the $T$-matrix approach to study single impurity scattering in unconventional superconductors. Our work focuses on two distinct pairing scenarios: intralayer $d$-wave pairing and interlayer $s$-wave pairing. For systems with intralayer $d$-wave pairing, we establish an intrinsic connection between the $d$-wave pairing symmetry and the emergence of mid-gap resonant states. Through a combination of analytical derivations and numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the appearance of in-gap states is directly linked to the sign reversal of the order parameter along the Fermi surface. In interlayer pairing systems, our results reveal the presence of pronounced resonant peaks, which can also be attributed to the sign-changing nature of the order parameter. We further extend our analysis to the bilayer nickelate superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, providing a theoretical investigative of impurity effects in this material. Our findings not only elucidate the complex interplay between pairing symmetries and impurity-induced states in unconventional superconductors but also offer a powerful tool for probing the pairing mechanisms in nickelate-based high-temperature superconductors. This work lays the groundwork for future experimental and theoretical investigations into the unique electronic properties of these emerging materials.

Title: Electrical Control of the Exchange Bias Effect at Model Ferromagnet-Altermagnet Junctions
Authors: Gaspar De la Barrera, Alvaro S. Nunez
Abstract: This work analyzes the behavior of the interface between a ferromagnetic material and an alter-magnet. We use a well-established line of arguments based on electronic mean-field calculations to show that new surface phenomena that lead to altermagnetic materials induce an exchange bias effect on the nearby ferromagnet. We reveal the physical mechanisms behind this phenomenon that lead to quantitative control over its strength. Interestingly, we predict exotic electric-field-induced phenomena. This is an analogy to the relationship between exchange bias and the injection of spin currents in spin-transfer-dominated scenarios, which has been reported earlier in the traditional antiferromagnetic/ferromagnetic junction.

Title: Designing edge currents using mesoscopic patterning in chiral d-wave superconductors
Authors: Patric Holmvall, Annica M. Black-Schaffer
Abstract: Chiral superconductors are topological as characterized by a finite Chern number and chiral edge modes. Direct fingerprints of chiral superconductivity are thus often taken to be spontaneous edge currents with associated magnetic signatures. However, a number of recent theoretical studies have shown that the total edge current along semi-infinite edges is greatly reduced or even vanishes in many scenarios for all pairing symmetries except chiral $p$-wave, thus impeding experimental detection. We demonstrate how mesoscopic finite-sized samples can be designed to give rise to a shape- and size-dependent strong enhancement of the chiral edge currents and their generated orbital magnetic moment and magnetic fields. In particular, we find that low rotational symmetry systems, such as pentagons and hexagons, give rise to the largest currents, while circular disks also generate large currents but in the opposite direction. We estimate the resulting magnetic fields to be as large as $0.01-0.5$ mT, with a magnetic moment approaching $\mu_B/2$ per Cooper pair (Bohr magneton $\mu_B$). The current and magnetic signatures diverge with shrinking system sizes, eventually cut off by finite-size suppression of chiral superconductivity. We extract the full phase diagram as a function of temperature and system size for different geometries, including competing superconducting orders. In geometries strongly suppressing only one of the $d$-wave components, we find an additional heat capacity jump, as large as $10\%$ of the bulk normal-superconducting transition, marking the transition between a chiral and a nodal $d$-wave state. This further acts as an indirect signature of chiral superconductivity. Our results are relevant for system sizes on the order of tens to hundreds of coherence lengths, and highlight mesoscopic patterning as a viable route to experimentally identify chiral $d$-wave superconductivity.

Title: Unconventional excitonic insulators in two-dimensional topological materials
Authors: L. Maisel Licerán, H. T. C. Stoof
Abstract: Bound electron-hole pairs in semiconductors known as excitons can form a coherent state at low temperatures akin to a BCS condensate. The resulting phase is known as the excitonic insulator and has superfluid properties. Here we theoretically study the excitonic insulator in a pair of recently proposed two-dimensional candidate materials with nontrivial band topology. Contrary to previous works, we include interaction channels that violate the individual electron and hole number conservations. These are on equal footing with the number-conserving processes due to the substantial overlap of Wannier orbitals of different bands, which cannot be exponentially localized due to the nontrivial Chern numbers of the latter. Their inclusion is crucial to determine the symmetry of the electron-hole pairing, and by performing mean-field calculations at nonzero temperatures we find that the order parameter in these systems is a chiral $d$-wave. We discuss the nontrivial topology of this unconventional state and discuss some properties of the associated Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. In particular, we argue that here it becomes a smooth crossover and estimate the associated temperature to lie between $\SI{50}{\kelvin}$ and $\SI{75}{\kelvin}$ on realistic substrates, over an order of magnitude larger than in the number-conserving approximation where $s$-wave pairing is favored. Our results highlight the interplay between topology at the single-particle level and long-range interactions, motivating further research in systems where both phenomena coexist.

Title: Enskog and Enskog-Vlasov equations with a slightly modified correlation factor and their H theorem
Authors: Shigeru Takata, Aoto Takahashi
Abstract: A novel modification of the original Enskog equation is proposed. The modification is much simpler than that is made in the modified (or revised) Enskog equation proposed by van Beijeren \& Ernst in 1973 and does not require a consideration of many-body configuration. The proposed modification is general enough to be adapted to various equations of states for non-ideal gases. It is shown that the H-theorem can be established for the Enskog and the Enskog--Vlasov equation with the proposed modification.

Title: Thiolation and PEGylation of silicon carbide nanoparticle
Authors: Péter Rózsa, Olga Krafcsik, Zsolt Czigány, Sándor Lenk, David Beke, Adam Gali
Abstract: In this study, we implement thiol termination on the surface of few-nanometer-sized silicon carbide (SiC) nanoparticles (NPs) to enable further applications, such as fluorescent biomarkers. Various spectroscopic techniques are employed to monitor the effectiveness of the surface treatment. A thiol-Michael addition reaction is performed by conjugating 4-arm PEGmaleimide molecules to the thiol groups of SiC NPs, further demonstrating the reactivity of thiol-terminated SiC NPs, which also acts as a protection layer against oxidation. These fluorescent thiolated SiC NPs, both with and without conjugated molecules, are directly applicable as bioinert probes. Since SiC NPs can potentially host room-temperature fluorescent defect quantum bits, our results are an important step to realize a bioinert, ultrasmall quantum sensor bioagents, which may open new avenues in biotechnology.

Title: Nonadiabatic quantum geometry and optical conductivity
Authors: Raffaele Resta
Abstract: The ground-state quantum geometry is at the root of several static and adiabatic properties, while genuinely dynamic properties are routinely addressed via Kubo formulae, whose essential entries are the excited states. It is shown here that the ground-state metric-curvature tensor evolves in time by means of a causal unitary operator, which by construction elucidates the geometrical effect of the excited states in compact form. In the condensed-matter case the generalized tensor encompasses the whole conductivity tensor at arbitrary frequencies in both insulators and metals, with the exception of the Drude term in the metallic case; the latter is shown to be eminently nongeometrical.

Title: Cryogenic Nano-Imaging of Excitons in a Monolayer Semiconductor
Authors: Anna Roche, Michael R. Koehler, David G. Mandrus, Takashi Taniguchi, Kenji Watanabe, John R. Schaibley, Brian J. LeRoy
Abstract: Excitons, Coulomb bound electron-hole pairs, dominate the optical response of two-dimensional semiconductors across near-infrared and visible frequencies due to their large binding energy and prominent oscillator strength. Previous measurements of excitons in 2D semiconductors have primarily relied on far-field optical spectroscopy techniques which are diffraction limited to several hundred nanometers. To precisely image nanoscale spatial disorder requires an order of magnitude increase in resolution capabilities. Here, we present a study of the exciton spectra of monolayer MoSe2 in the visible range using a cryogenic scattering-type scanning near field optical microscope (s-SNOM) operating down to 11 K. By mapping the spatial variation in the exciton resonance across an hBN encapsulated MoSe2 monolayer, we achieve sub-50 nm spatial resolution and energy resolution below 1 meV. We further investigate the material's near-field spectra and dielectric function, demonstrating the ability of cryogenic visible s-SNOM to reveal nanoscale disorder. Comparison to room temperature measurements illustrate the enhanced capabilities of cryogenic s-SNOM to reveal fine-scale material heterogeneity.

Title: Collecting Particles in Confined Spaces by Active Filamentous Matter
Authors: R. Sinaasappel, K.R. Prathyusha, H. Tuazon, E. Mirzahossein, P. Illien, S. Bhamla, A. Deblais
Abstract: Biological and robotic systems often operate in confined environments where material must be gathered without centralized control. Inspired by the effective collection strategies of aquatic worms (Lumbriculus variegatus and Tubifex tubifex), we investigate how active filaments autonomously aggregate dispersed particles. We study this process across four platforms: living worms, a robotic chain, Brownian dynamics simulations of active polymers, and a coarse-grained toy model. We show that aggregation emerges from repeated contact and body deformation, and demonstrate that clustering dynamics are governed by filament length and bending stiffness. Across systems, particle gathering follows a shared aggregation-fragmentation process, with the steady-state average cluster size scaling as $\langle s\rangle_L\sim W/D^2$, where W is the effective width of the path cleared by the filament and D the domain size. We find that filament flexibility modulates W, enabling more flexible filaments to sweep larger areas and collect more particles. These results establish a unifying framework for understanding how shape and flexibility influence transport and organization in active filament systems and filamentous robots.

Title: Equivalent Electric Model of a Macrospin
Authors: Steven Louis, Hannah Bradley, Vasyl Tyberkevych
Abstract: Dynamics of a ferromagnetic macrospin (e.g., a free layer of a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ)) can be described in terms of equivalent capacitor charge $Q$ and inductor flux $\Phi$, in a manner similar to a standard electric LC circuit, but with strongly nonlinear and coupled capacitance and inductance. This description allows for the inclusion of Gilbert damping and spin transfer torques and yields a relatively simple equivalent electric circuit, which can be easily modeled in LTspice or other electrical engineering software. It allows one to easily simulate advanced electrical circuits containing MTJs and conventional electronic components in standard simulation software.

Title: Triplet superconductivity by the orbital Rashba effect at surfaces of elemental superconductors
Authors: Tom G. Saunderson, Martin Gradhand, Dongwook Go, James F. Annett, Maria Teresa Mercaldo, Mario Cuoco, Mathias Kläui, Jacob Gayles, Yuriy Mokrousov
Abstract: It is often assumed that in a superconductor without spin-triplet pairing, the formation of unconventional spin-triplet densities requires the spin-orbit interaction in combination with either broken inversion symmetry or broken time-reversal symmetry. Here, we show from first principles the existence of supercurrent-driven spin triplet densities on the surface of a variety of simple superconducting materials without spin-orbit coupling. We are able to attribute this phenomenon to the superconducting non-relativistic orbital Rashba Edelstein effect. Furthermore, we find that the spin-orbit induced spin moment is one order of magnitude smaller than the orbital moment, and has a vanishing effect on the total magnitude of the induced triplet density. Our findings imply the existence of a route to generate spin-currents without the use of heavy metals. Additionally, as an orbital moment can couple directly to a magnetic field, it shows that orbital physics is the dominant term that drives the superconducting diode effect.

Title: Algorithmic thresholds in combinatorial optimization depend on the time scaling
Authors: M. C. Angelini, M. Avila-González, F. D'Amico, D. Machado, R. Mulet, F. Ricci-Tersenghi
Abstract: In the last decades, many efforts have focused on analyzing typical-case hardness in optimization and inference problems. Some recent work has pointed out that polynomial algorithms exist, running with a time that grows more than linearly with the system size, which can do better than linear algorithms, finding solutions to random problems in a wider range of parameters. However, a theory for polynomial and superlinear algorithms is in general lacking. In this paper, we examine the performance of the Simulated Annealing algorithm, a standard, versatile, and robust choice for solving optimization and inference problems, in the prototypical random $K$-Sat problem. For the first time, we show that the algorithmic thresholds depend on the time scaling of the algorithm with the size of the system. Indeed, one can identify not just one, but different thresholds for linear, quadratic, cubic regimes (and so on). This observation opens new directions in studying the typical case hardness in optimization problems.

Title: Power Transfer in Magnetoelectric Resonators: a Combined Analytical and Finite Element Study
Authors: Emma Van Meirvenne, Frederic Vanderveken, Daniele Narducci, Bart Sorée, Florin Ciubotaru, Christoph Adelmann
Abstract: We present an analytical model for power transfer in a magnetoelectric film bulk acoustic resonator (FBAR) comprising a piezoelectric-magnetostrictive bilayer. The model describes the power flow between the elastic and magnetic systems, quantifying the transduction efficiency when the FBAR operates as a magnetic transducer. By applying the model to example systems using piezoelectric ScAlN and magnetostrictive CoFeB, Ni, or Terfenol-D layers, we demonstrate the potential for achieving high efficiencies in magnetoelectric transducers, rendering them ideal for efficient ferromagnetic resonance excitation. The validity of the model's assumptions is confirmed through comparison with a numerical finite element resonator model in COMSOL\texttrademark. The finite element model further enables a comprehensive study of the resonator's dynamic behavior, including transient and steady-state regimes, and the identification of resonant frequencies within the system.

Title: A Unified Simulation Framework for Correlated Driven-Dissipative Quantum Dynamics
Authors: Thomas Blommel, Enrico Perfetto, Gianluca Stefanucci, Vojtěch Vlček
Abstract: Time-resolved photoemission spectroscopy provides a unique and direct way to explore the real-time nonequilibrium dynamics of electrons and holes. The formal theory of the spectral function evolution requires inclusion of electronic correlations and dissipation, which are challenging due to the associated long simulation timescales which translate to a high computational cost. Recent methodological developments, namely the Real-Time Dyson Expansion, as well as theoretical developments of many-body perturbation theory for dissipative systems, have allowed for the study of driven-dissipative interacting quantum systems. In this work, we implement the hitherto unrealized study of driven-dissipative interacting quantum systems which includes driven dynamical correlations and utilizes these new methods and perturbative expansions. We illustrate the combined formalism on a prototypical two-band semiconductor model with long-range density-density Coulomb interactions. We show that the intraband thermalization of conduction band electrons induces nontrivial time-dependent changes in the system's bandstructure and a time-evolving band-gap renormalization (with a reduction by up to 10\%). We show that the qualitative features are preserved for a variety of parameters, discuss the corresponding spectral dynamics, and provide an outlook on the newly introduced simulation framework, which enables treating electron-electron scattering and dissipation effects on equal footing.

Title: Differentiation of Distinct Single Atoms via Multi-Defocus Fusion Method
Authors: Yangfan Li, Yue Pan, Xincheng Lei, Weiwei Chen, Yang Shen, Mengshu Ge, Xiaozhi Liu, Dong Su
Abstract: High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) is a vital tool for characterizing single-atom catalysts (SACs). However, reliable elemental identification of different atoms remains challenging because the signal intensity of HAADF depends strongly on defocus and other imaging parameters, potentially ruining the Z-contrast of atoms at different depths. In this work, we investigated the influence of the vertical position of atoms (defocus), support thickness, interatomic height, convergence and collection angles via multi-slice simulations on a model system of Fe/Pt atoms on amorphous carbon supports. Our calculation shows that at a convergence angle of 28 mrad, a defocus of 4.6 nm can cause Fe and Pt atoms indistinguishable. At a larger convergence angle, this critical indistinguishable defocus can be even shorter. To address this limitation, we propose a Multi-Defocus Fusion (MDF) method, retrieving the Z-contrast from serial images from multiple defocus. Experimental validation on a Fe/Pt SAC sample confirms the effectiveness of MDF, yielding clearly separated intensity histograms corresponding to Fe and Pt atoms. This work presents a robust, easy-to-implement strategy for accurate single-atom identification, offering valuable guidance for the accelerated screening and rational design of high-performance SACs.

Title: Complete suppression of flux instabilities in ramped superconducting magnets with synchronous temperature-modulated Jc
Authors: Cun Xue, Han-Xi Ren, Kai-Wei Cao, Wei Liu, Wen-Tao Zhang, Fang Yang, Guo Yan, You-He Zhou, Pingxiang Zhang
Abstract: Nonlinear multi-field coupling as an intrinsic property of complex physical systems often leads to abrupt and undesired instabilities. For current-ramped high-field Nb3Sn magnets, frequent flux jumps are observed, which easily causes premature quenches and requires prolonged and resource-intensive magnet training process. In this study, we propose a paradigm-shifting methodology framework that achieves complete suppression of thermomagnetic instabilities through synchronized temperature-modulated critical current density (Jc). Through numerical simulations of flux jumps in multifilamentary Nb3Sn wires exposed to a time-varying magnetic field at various temperatures, we construct thermomagnetic stability diagram in the Ha-T plane. The simulated results are in good agreement with experimental measurements, which demonstrates the synchronized ramped-down temperature can indeed fully eliminate flux jumps. We reveal the underlying physical mechanism of enhancing the thermomagnetic stability arises from that synchronized ramped-down temperature can continuously tune both Jc and its slope. Furthermore, we carry out numerical simulations for the thermomagnetic instabilities of current-ramped superconducting magnets through large-scale GPU-optimized algorithm with home-made codes. The flux jump and quench diagram in the Ia-T plane are obtained. It indicates that the ramped-down temperature can completely suppress flux jumps without compromising Jc at high magnetic fields. Importantly, this method does not require modifications to the superconducting microstructures or fabrication process, offering a practical and broadly applicable this http URL findings offer a robust method to stabilize diverse superconducting magnet systems (including 2nd-gen coated tape HTS magnets), and propose a generalizable strategy for controlling instability in nonlinear non-equilibrium physical systems.

Title: Emergent Complexity in a Light-Driven Self-Oscillatory Crystal: A Molecular Perspective on Autonomous Behavior and Stimulus-Modulated Motion
Authors: Yoshiyuki Kageyama, Yasuaki Kobayashi, Makiko Matsuura, Toshiaki Shimizu, Norio Tanada, Daisuke Yazaki
Abstract: Living organisms are molecular systems with self-sustained dynamics via energy conversion through molecular cooperation, resulting in highly complex macroscopic behaviors. Construction of such autonomous macroscopic dynamics at a molecular system level remains one of the central challenges in the field of chemistry. Looking further ahead, constructing motile systems that can receive external information and adapt their autonomous behavior represents the next frontier towards newly functional molecular devices such as microrobots. In this study, we focused on a light-driven self-oscillatory crystal that exhibits continuous flipping motion under constant light irradiation. We experimentally evaluated the oscillation frequency of the crystal under polarized light and confirmed the validity of our previously proposed mechanism, and clarified the requirements for self-oscillation. Based on this mechanism, we constructed a mathematical model that demonstrates the motion of the crystal itself. The model revealed that diverse oscillatory behaviors at the macroscopic level can emerge due to small differences in conditions even when the underlying molecular-level processes are identical. Furthermore, we found that the oscillatory behavior depended on the state generated by the previously applied light. This suggests that a memory effect contributes to the complex motion of the crystal.

Title: Connecting NTK and NNGP: A Unified Theoretical Framework for Wide Neural Network Learning Dynamics
Authors: Yehonatan Avidan, Qianyi Li, Haim Sompolinsky
Abstract: Artificial neural networks have revolutionized machine learning in recent years, but a complete theoretical framework for their learning process is still lacking. Substantial advances were achieved for wide networks, within two disparate theoretical frameworks: the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK), which assumes linearized gradient descent dynamics, and the Bayesian Neural Network Gaussian Process (NNGP). We unify these two theories using gradient descent learning with an additional noise in an ensemble of wide deep networks. We construct an analytical theory for the network input-output function and introduce a new time-dependent Neural Dynamical Kernel (NDK) from which both NTK and NNGP kernels are derived. We identify two learning phases: a gradient-driven learning phase, dominated by loss minimization, in which the time scale is governed by the initialization variance. It is followed by a slow diffusive learning stage, where the parameters sample the solution space, with a time constant decided by the noise and the Bayesian prior variance. The two variance parameters strongly affect the performance in the two regimes, especially in sigmoidal neurons. In contrast to the exponential convergence of the mean predictor in the initial phase, the convergence to the equilibrium is more complex and may behave nonmonotonically. By characterizing the diffusive phase, our work sheds light on representational drift in the brain, explaining how neural activity changes continuously without degrading performance, either by ongoing gradient signals that synchronize the drifts of different synapses or by architectural biases that generate task-relevant information that is robust against the drift process. This work closes the gap between the NTK and NNGP theories, providing a comprehensive framework for the learning process of deep wide neural networks and for analyzing dynamics in biological circuits.

Title: Stable infinite-temperature eigenstates in SU(2)-symmetric nonintegrable models
Authors: Christopher J. Turner, Marcin Szyniszewski, Bhaskar Mukherjee, Ronald Melendrez, Hitesh J. Changlani, Arijeet Pal
Abstract: Nonintegrable many-body quantum systems typically thermalize at long times through the mechanism of quantum chaos. However, some exceptional systems, such as those harboring quantum scars, break thermalization, serving as testbeds for foundational problems of quantum statistical physics. Here, we investigate a class of nonintegrable bond-staggered models that is endowed with a large number of zero-energy eigenstates and possesses a non-Abelian internal symmetry. We use character theory to give a lower bound on the zero-energy degeneracy, which matches exact diagonalization results, and is found to grow exponentially with the system size. We also show that few-magnon zero-energy states have an exact analytical description, allowing us to build a basis of low-entangled fixed-separation states, which is stable to most perturbations found in experiments. This remarkable dynamical stability of special states elucidates our understanding of nonequilibrium processes in non-Abelian chaotic quantum models.

Title: Quantum decoherence from complex saddle points
Authors: Jun Nishimura, Hiromasa Watanabe
Abstract: Quantum decoherence is the effect that bridges quantum physics to well-understood classical physics. As such, it plays a crucial role in understanding the mysterious nature of quantum physics. Quantum decoherence is also a source of quantum noise that has to be well under control in quantum computing and in various experiments based on quantum technologies. Here we point out that quantum decoherence can be captured by $\textit{complex}$ saddle points in the Feynman path integral in much the same way as quantum tunneling can be captured by instantons. In particular, we present some first-principle calculations in the Caldeira-Leggett model, which reproduce the predicted scaling behavior of quantum decoherence with respect to the parameters of the environment, such as the temperature and the coupling to the system of interest. We also discuss how to extend our approach to general models by Monte Carlo calculations using a recently developed method to overcome the sign problem.

Title: Efficient computation of topological order
Authors: Louis Fraatz, Amit Jamadagni, Hendrik Weimer
Abstract: We analyze the computational aspects of detecting topological order in a quantum many-body system. We contrast the widely used topological entanglement entropy with a recently introduced operational definition for topological order based on error correction properties, finding exponential scaling with the system size for the former and polynomial scaling for the latter. We exemplify our approach for a variant of the paradigmatic toric code model with mobile particles, finding that the error correction method allows to treat substantially larger system sizes. In particular, the phase diagram of the model can be successfully computed using error correction, while the topological entanglement entropy is too severely limited by finite size effects to obtain conclusive results. While we mainly focus on one-dimensional systems whose ground states can be expressed in terms of matrix product states, our strategy can be readily generalized to higher dimensions and systems out of equilibrium, even allowing for an efficient detection of topological order in current quantum simulation experiments.

Title: Stochastic resetting in discrete-time quantum dynamics: steady states and correlations in few-qubit systems
Authors: Sascha Wald, Louie Hong Yao, Thierry Platini, Chris Hooley, Federico Carollo
Abstract: Time evolution in several classes of quantum devices is generated through the application of quantum gates. Resetting is a critical technological feature in these systems allowing for mid-circuit measurement and complete or partial qubit reset. The possibility of realizing discrete-time reset dynamics on quantum computers makes it important to investigate the steady-state properties of such dynamics. Here, we explore the behavior of generic discrete-time unitary dynamics interspersed by random reset events. For Poissonian resets, we compute the stationary state of the process and demonstrate, by taking a weak-reset limit, the existence of "resonances" in the quantum gates, allowing for the emergence of steady state density matrices which are not diagonal in the eigenbasis of the generator of the unitary gate. Such resonances are a genuine discrete-time feature and impact on quantum and classical correlations even beyond the weak-reset limit. Furthermore, we consider non-Poissonian reset processes and explore conditions for the existence of a steady state. We show that, when the reset probability vanishes sufficiently rapidly with time, the system does not approach a steady state. Our results highlight key differences between continuous-time and discrete-time stochastic resetting and may be useful to engineer states with controllable correlations on existing devices.

Title: All 4 x 4 solutions of the quantum Yang-Baxter equation
Authors: Marius de Leeuw, Vera Posch
Abstract: In this paper, we complete the classification of 4 x 4 solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation. Regular solutions were recently classified and in this paper we find the remaining non-regular solutions. We present several new solutions, then consider regular and non-regular Lax operators and study their relation to the quantum Yang-Baxter equation. We show that for regular solutions there is a correspondence, which is lost in the non-regular case. In particular, we find non-regular Lax operators whose R-matrix from the fundamental commutation relations is regular but does not satisfy the Yang-Baxter equation. These R-matrices satisfy a modified Yang-Baxter equation instead.

Title: Exploring dynamical quantum phase transition from pure states to mixed states through extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger models
Authors: Kaiyuan Cao, Tianren Zhang, Xiangping Jiang, Jian Wang
Abstract: We investigate dynamic quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) in both pure and mixed states within the framework of the generalized SSH model, specifically analyzing the SSH-3 and SSH-4 models, which exhibit different symmetries. We find that the SSH-3 model, characterized by a chiral-like point symmetry rather than true chiral symmetry, supports robust localized edge states associated with its topological properties. Our results show that DQPTs for pure states occur following a quench that crosses the topological transition, even with an open energy band gap. For mixed states, DQPT behavior is consistent at low temperatures, but significant changes are observed at high temperatures, resulting in the emergence of multiple critical times. In contrast, the SSH-4 model, which possesses chiral symmetry, allows for the analysis of two distinct energy spectrum configurations. We conclude that the occurrence of DQPTs for pure states in the SSH-4 model necessitates a quench from an initial state without a band gap while crossing the critical point of the topological transition, whereas DQPTs are absent for mixed states at elevated temperatures.

Title: Correlations and Krylov spread for a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian: Ising chain with a complex-valued transverse magnetic field
Authors: E. Medina-Guerra, I. V. Gornyi, Yuval Gefen
Abstract: Krylov complexity measures the spread of an evolved state in a natural basis, induced by the generator of the dynamics and the initial state. Here, we study the spread in Hilbert space of the state of an Ising chain subject to a complex-valued transverse magnetic field, initialized in a trivial product state with all spins pointing down. We demonstrate that Krylov spread reveals structural features of many-body systems that remain hidden in correlation functions that are traditionally employed to determine the phase diagram. When the imaginary part of the spectrum of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian is gapped, the system state asymptotically approaches the non-Hermitian Bogoliubov vacuum for this Hamiltonian. We find that the spread of this evolution unravels three different dynamical phases based on how the spread reaches its infinite-time value. Furthermore, we establish a connection between the Krylov spread and the static correlation function for the z-components of spins in the underlying non-Hermitian Bogoliubov vacuum, providing a full analytical characterization of correlations across the phase diagram. Specifically, for a gapped imaginary spectrum in a finite magnetic field, we find that the correlation function exhibits an oscillatory behavior that decays exponentially in space. Conversely, for a gapless imaginary spectrum, the correlation function displays an oscillatory behavior with an amplitude that decays algebraically in space; the underlying power law depends on the manifestation of two exceptional points within this phase.

Title: Quantum geometry and adiabaticity in molecules and in condensed matter
Authors: Raffaele Resta
Abstract: The adiabatic theorem states that when the time evolution of the Hamiltonian is "infinitely slow", a system, when started in the ground state, remains in the instantaneous ground state at all times. This, however, does not mean that the adiabatic evolution of a generic observable obtains simply as its expectation value over the instantaneous eigenstate. As a general principle there is an additional adiabatic term, of quantum-geometrical nature, which is the relevant one for several static or adiabatic observables. This is shown explicitly for the cases of polarizability and infrared tensors (in molecules and condensed matter); rotational g factor and magnetizability (in molecules only). Quantum geometry allows for a transparent derivation and a compact expression for these observables, alternative to the well known sum-over-states Kubo formulas.

Title: Quantum precursors to Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser theorem in Floquet spin-$J$ systems
Authors: Jesús A. Segura-Landa, Meenu Kumari, Daniel J. Nader, Sercan Hüsnügil, Ali SaraerToosi, Sergio Lerma-Hernández
Abstract: The Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM) theorem proves that the resonant tori of classical integrable Hamiltonians are broken when a non-integrable perturbation is introduced, whereas non-resonant tori only get deformed for up to a finite value of the perturbative parameter. In this letter, we identify quantum precursors to the KAM theorem in one-degree-of-freedom spin Hamiltonians periodically perturbed by instantaneous kicks. After recognizing quantum signatures of resonances in the Floquet eigenstates of the perturbed Hamiltonian, we reveal a differentiated sensitivity to the perturbation of the eigenstates of the unperturbed Hamiltonian, depending on whether the states satisfy a resonant condition or not. It is also shown that this differentiated sensitivity becomes more pronounced as the system size increases, leading to the KAM theorem in the classical limit $J\rightarrow\infty$. Numerical and analytical results obtained from unitary perturbation theory strongly support these findings. Although specific to kicked models, our results can be easily extended to more general scenarios, allowing the identification of the quantum mechanism that corresponds to the KAM theorem in the classical limit.

Title: How individual vs shared coordination governs the degree of correlation in rotational vs residence times in a high-viscosity lithium electrolyte
Authors: Vinay Thakur, Prabhat Prakash, Raghavan Ranganathan
Abstract: Commercially used carbonate-based electrolytes in lithium-ion batteries are susceptible to many challenges, including flammability, volatility, and lower thermal stability. Solvated ionic liquids of LiTFSI salt (lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)-amide) and glyme-based solvents are potential alternative candidates for commonly used electrolytes. We perform classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations study the effect of concentration and temperature on the translational and rotational dynamics. The radial distribution function shows stronger coordination of Li$^+$ ions with tetraglyme(G4), as shown in earlier studies, and forms a stable [Li(G4)]$^+$ cation complex. The self-diffusion coefficients are lower than the values experimentally observed but show better improvement over other classical force fields. An increase in the salt concentrations leads to a higher viscosity of the system and reduces the overall ionic mobility of Li$^{+}$ ions. Diluting the system with a larger number of glyme molecules leads to shorter rotational relaxation times for both TFSI and tetraglyme. Ion-residence times show that Li$^+$ ions form stable and long-lasting complexes with G4 molecules than TFSI anions. The residence time of [Li(G4)]$^+$ complex increases at higher salt concentrations due to the availability of fewer G4 molecules to coordinate with a Li$^+$ ion. G4 is also seen to form polydentate complexes with Li$^+$ without a shared coordination, allowing rotation without breaking coordination, unlike TFSI, which requires coordination disruption for rotation. This distinction explains the poor correlation between rotation and residence time for G4 and the strong correlation for TFSI.

Abstract: Natural or artificial barriers, such as the Himalayas, the Berlin Wall, or the Korean Demilitarized Zone, can significantly impede human migration. As a consequence, they may also hinder the dissemination of opinions within society, thereby contributing to divergent geopolitical landscapes and cultural developments. This raises a fundamental question: how do such barriers influence the opinion dynamics of mobile agents, such as human beings? In particular, can a barrier induce transitions in collective opinion states among spatially segregated groups? Here, we investigate the opinion dynamics governed by majority rule in a minimal model comprising self-propelled agents with binary opinions performing random walks within a closed space divided by a barrier. We focus on the conditions under which initially segregated clusters of agents with opposing opinions can reach consensus. Our results reveal the existence of a critical barrier size that marks a transition between stalemate and consensus states. Near this critical point, the relaxation time to reach consensus from an initial stalemate exhibits a power-law divergence. This barrier-induced stalemate-consensus transition in a simple agent-based model offers new insights into the role of physical or social barriers in shaping opinion dynamics and social structures.
