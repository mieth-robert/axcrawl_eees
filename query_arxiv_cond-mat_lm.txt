Abstract: Low-molecular weight (LMW) hydrogels are gaining interest over macromolecular gels due to their reversible, dynamic and stimuli-responsive nature. They are potentially interesting functional materials for advanced applications such as catalysis, nanoelectronics or regenerative medicine. One common strategy to enhance the functional properties is to incorporate inorganic nanostructures. However, simultaneous control of the gel mechanics, shape and size of the nanostructures and functional properties is challenging. Here, a biobased, double amphiphilic, bolaform, single-glucose lipid (containing glucose and COOH in opposite directions) is able to coordinate silver ions, drive the formation of a self-assembled fibrous hydrogel and, after controlling the reduction time (seconds to hours) of the reduction process (NaBH4, ascorbate, $\gamma$-rays), stabilize Ag nanoparticles (NPs) of controlled size (2.8 nm $\pm$ 13%). The NPs are spontaneously embedded in the fibers' core following a two-dimensional anisotropic long-range order. Precise control of the reduction parameters (ascorbate) drives the formation of Ag nanowires, possibly due to an anisotropic coalescence process of the nanoparticles. Samples containing Ag nanowires have shown an electronic conductive response, observed with impedance spectroscopy. This works shows the potential of biological amphiphiles to develop under soft conditions (pseudo single step, water, room temperature) advanced hybrid organic/inorganic (O/I) materials with a multiscale structure, order and electron conductivity functionality

Title: CLOUD: A Scalable and Physics-Informed Foundation Model for Crystal Representation Learning
Authors: Changwen Xu, Shang Zhu, Venkatasubramanian Viswanathan
Abstract: The prediction of crystal properties is essential for understanding structure-property relationships and accelerating the discovery of functional materials. However, conventional approaches relying on experimental measurements or density functional theory (DFT) calculations are often resource-intensive, limiting their scalability. Machine learning (ML) models offer a promising alternative by learning complex structure-property relationships from data, enabling faster predictions. Yet, existing ML models often rely on labeled data, adopt representations that poorly capture essential structural characteristics, and lack integration with physical principles--factors that limit their generalizability and interpretability. Here, we introduce CLOUD (Crystal Language mOdel for Unified and Differentiable materials modeling), a transformer-based framework trained on a novel Symmetry-Consistent Ordered Parameter Encoding (SCOPE) that encodes crystal symmetry, Wyckoff positions, and composition in a compact, coordinate-free string representation. Pre-trained on over six million crystal structures, CLOUD is fine-tuned on multiple downstream tasks and achieves competitive performance in predicting a wide range of material properties, demonstrating strong scaling performance. Furthermore, as proof of concept of differentiable materials modeling, CLOUD is applied to predict the phonon internal energy and heat capacity, which integrates the Debye model to preserve thermodynamic consistency. The CLOUD-DEBYE framework enforces thermodynamic consistency and enables temperature-dependent property prediction without requiring additional data. These results demonstrate the potential of CLOUD as a scalable and physics-informed foundation model for crystalline materials, unifying symmetry-consistent representations with physically grounded learning for property prediction and materials discovery.

Title: Quantum Geometric Origin of the Intrinsic Nonlinear Hall Effect
Authors: Yannis Ulrich, Johannes Mitscherling, Laura Classen, Andreas P. Schnyder
Abstract: We analyze the quantum geometric contribution to the intrinsic second-order nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE) for a general multiband Hamiltonian. The nonlinear conductivity, obtained in Green's function formalism, is decomposed into its quantum geometric constituents using a projector-based approach. In addition to the previously identified Berry curvature and interband quantum metric dipoles, we obtain a third term of quantum geometric origin, given by the momentum derivative of the $intraband$ quantum metric. This contribution, which we term the intraband quantum metric dipole, provides substantial corrections to the NLHE in topological magnets and becomes the dominant geometric term in topological antiferromagnets with gapped Dirac cones. Considering generalized 2D and 3D Weyl/Dirac Hamiltonians, describing a large class of topological band crossings with sizable quantum geometry, we derive analytical expressions of the NLHE, thereby revealing the individual contributions of the three quantum geometric terms. Combined with an exhaustive symmetry classification of all magnetic space groups, this analysis leads to the identification of several candidate materials expected to exhibit large intrinsic NLHE, including the antiferromagnets $\text{Yb}_3\text{Pt}_4$, $\text{CuMnAs}$, and $\text{CoNb}_3\text{S}_6$, as well as the nodal-plane material $\text{MnNb}_3\text{S}_6$. Finally, our projector-based approach yields a compact expression for the NLHE in terms of momentum derivatives of the Bloch Hamiltonian matrix alone, enabling efficient numerical evaluation of each contribution in the aforementioned materials.

Title: Specific-heat anomaly in frustrated magnets with vacancy defects
Authors: Muhammad Sedik, Siyu Zhu, Sergey Syzranov
Abstract: Motivated by frustrated magnets and spin-liquid-candidate materials, we study the thermodynamics of a 2D geometrically frustrating magnet with vacancy defects. The presence of vacancies imposes constraints on the bulk spins, which freezes some of the degrees of freedom in the system at low temperatures. With increasing temperature, these constraints get relaxed, resulting in an increase in the system's entropy. This leads to the emergence of a peak in the heat capacity $C(T)$ of the magnet at a temperature determined by the concentration of the vacancy defects. To illustrate the emergence of such an anomaly, we compute analytically the heat capacity of the antiferromagnetic (AFM) Ising model on the triangular lattice with vacancy defects. The presence of the vacancy leads to a peak in $C(T)$ at the temperature $T_\text{imp}=-6J/\ln n_\text{imp}$, where $J$ is the AFM coupling between the spins and $n_\text{imp}$ is the fraction of the missing sites.

Title: Tunable anyonic permeability across ${\mathbb{Z}_2}$ spin liquid junctions
Authors: Sayak Bhattacharjee, Soumya Sur, Adhip Agarwala
Abstract: We introduce two classes of junctions in a toric code, a prototypical model of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum spin liquid, and study the nature of anyonic transport across them mediated by Zeeman fields. In the first class of junctions, termed potential barrier junctions, the charges sense effective static potentials and a change in the band mass. In a particular realization, while the junction is completely transparent to the electric charge, magnetic charge transmission is allowed only after a critical field strength. In the second class of junctions we stitch two toric codes with operators which do not commute at the junction. We show that the anyonic transmission gets tuned by effective pseudospin fluctuations at the junction. Using exact analytical mappings and numerical simulations, we compute charge-specific transmission probabilities. Our work, apart from uncovering the rich physical mechanisms at play in such junctions, can motivate experimental work to engineer defect structures in topologically ordered systems for tunable transport of anyonic particles.

Title: Negative intrinsic viscosity in graphene nanoparticle suspensions induced by hydrodynamic slip
Authors: Adyant Agrawal, Catherine Kamal, Simon Gravelle, Lorenzo Botto
Abstract: The viscosity of nanoparticle suspensions is always expected to increase with particle concentration. However, a growing body of experiments on suspensions of atomically thin nanomaterials such as graphene contradicts this expectation. Some experiments indicate effective suspension viscosity values that fall below that of pure solvent at high shear rates and low solid concentrations, i.e., the intrinsic viscosity is negative. To explain this puzzling phenomenon, we combined molecular dynamics and boundary integral simulations to investigate the shear viscosity of few-nanometer graphene sheets in water at high Péclet numbers (Pe $> 100$). Our results, covering geometric aspect ratios from 4.5 to 12.0, show robustly that the intrinsic viscosity decreases with increasing aspect ratio and becomes negative beyond a threshold aspect ratio $\approx 5.5$. We demonstrate that this anomalous behavior originates from hydrodynamic slip at the liquid-solid interface, which suppresses particle rotation and promotes stable alignment with the flow direction, thereby reducing viscous dissipation relative to dissipation in pure solvent. This slip mechanism holds for both fully 3D disc-like and quasi-2D particle geometries explored in the molecular simulations. As the concentration of graphene particles increases in the dilute regime, the viscosity initially decreases, falling below that of pure water. At higher concentrations, however, particle aggregation becomes significant, leading to a rise in viscosity after a minimum is reached. These findings confirm the occurrence of a negative intrinsic viscosity in a graphene suspension due only to hydrodynamic effects. Our work has important implications for the design of lubricants, inks, and nanocomposites with tunable viscosity.

Title: Electron beam irradiation-induced transport and recombination in p-type Gallium Oxide grown on (001) \b{eta}-Ga2O3 substrate
Authors: Gabriel Marciaga, Jian-Sian Li, Chao-Ching Chiang, Fan Ren, Stephen J. Pearton, Corinne Sartel, Zeyu Chi, Yves Dumont, Ekaterine Chikoidze, Alfons Schulte, Arie Ruzin, Leonid Chernyak
Abstract: This study investigates minority electron diffusion length and carrier recombination phenomena within p-type, 300 nm-thick Ga2O3 epitaxial films. Utilizing Electron Beam-Induced Current (EBIC) and Cathodoluminescence (CL) spectroscopy, these characteristics were examined as a function of both temperature and the duration of electron beam excitation. While the electron diffusion length in these p-Ga2O3 films diminish with increasing temperature, a continuous electron beam excitation of a particular location on the surface of a p-Ga2O3 epitaxial layer leads to an elongation of the diffusion length. and decay of cathodoluminescence intensity in that location under beam exposure. These latter two effects are attributed to non-equilibrium electrons, generated by an electron beam, being captured at acceptor-related point defect levels in Gallium Oxide. The activation energies characterizing these processes were obtained from the independent EBIC and CL experiments to garner insight into defect landscape and its influence on transport and recombination dynamics.

Title: Finite time path field theory and a new type of universal quantum spin chain quench behaviour
Authors: Domagoj Kuić, Alemka Knapp, Diana Šaponja-Milutinović
Abstract: We discuss different quench protocols for Ising and XY spin chains in a transverse magnetic field. With a sudden local magnetic field quench as a starting point, we generalize our approach to a large class of local non-sudden quenches. Using finite time path field theory perturbative methods, we show that the difference between the sudden quench and a class of quenches with non-sudden switching on the perturbation vanishes exponentially with time, apart from non-substantial modifications that are systematically accounted for. As the consequence of causality and analytic properties of functions describing the discussed class of quenches, this is true at any order of perturbation expansion and thus for the resummed perturbation series. The only requirements on functions describing the perturbation strength switched on at a finite time t=0 are: (1) their Fourier transform f(p) is a function that is analytic everywhere in the lower complex semiplane, except at the simple pole at p=0 and possibly others with Im (p) < 0, and (2) that f(p)/p converges to zero at infinity in the lower complex semiplane. Prototypical function of this class is tanh(eta t), to which the perturbation strength is proportional after the switching on time t=0. In the limit of large eta, such a perturbation approaches the case of a sudden quench. It is shown that, because of this new type of universal behaviour of Loschmidt echo that emerges in exponentially short time scale, our previous results (Kuić, D. et al. Universe 2024, 10, 384) for the sudden local magnetic field quench of Ising and XY chains, obtained by resummation of the perturbative expansion, extend in the long time limit to all non-sudden quench protocols in this class, with non-substantial modifications systematically taken into account. We also show that analogous universal behaviour exists in disorder quenches, and ultimately global ones.

Title: Normal modes and shockwaves in cold atoms
Authors: Francisco Raposo, Hugo Terças
Abstract: Numerical methods are developed to simulate the dynamics of atoms in a Magneto-Optic Trap (MOT), based on the fluid description of ultracold gases under laser cooling and magnetic trapping forces. With this model, equilibrium hydrostatic profiles and normal modes are calculated, and numerical results are validated against theoretical predictions. As a test case, shock wave formation due to rapid gas expansion and contraction of the ultracold gas is simulated. The latter is caused by a sudden change of the value of its effective collective charge. Limitations of the current methods and future improvements are discussed. This work provides a foundation for studying numerically complex MOT behaviors and their use as analog simulators for astrophysical phenomena.

Title: Tunable symmetry breaking in a hexagonal-stacked moiré magnet
Authors: Zeliang Sun, Gaihua Ye, Xiaohan Wan, Ning Mao, Cynthia Nnokwe, Senlei Li, Nishkarsh Agarwal, Siddhartha Sarkar, Zixin Zhai, Bing Lv, Robert Hovden, Chunhui Rita Du, Yang Zhang, Kai Sun, Rui He, Liuyan Zhao
Abstract: Symmetry plays a central role in defining magnetic phases, making tunable symmetry breaking across magnetic transitions highly desirable for discovering non-trivial magnetism. Magnetic moiré superlattices, formed by twisting two-dimensional (2D) magnetic crystals, have been theoretically proposed and experimentally explored as platforms for unconventional magnetic states. However, despite recent advances, tuning symmetry breaking in moiré magnetism remains limited, as twisted 2D magnets, such as rhombohedral (R)-stacked twisted CrI_3, largely inherit the magnetic properties and symmetries of their constituent layers. Here, in hexagonal-stacked twisted double bilayer (H-tDB) CrI_3, we demonstrate clear symmetry evolution as the twist angle increases from 180^{\circ} to 190^{\circ}. While the net magnetization remains zero across this twist angle range, the magnetic phase breaks only the three-fold rotational symmetry at 180^{\circ}, but it breaks all of the rotational, mirror, and time-reversal symmetries at intermediate twist angles between 181^{\circ} and 185^{\circ}, and all broken symmetries are recovered at 190^{\circ}. These pronounced symmetry breakings at intermediate twist angles are accompanied by metamagnetic behaviors, evidenced by symmetric double hysteresis loops around zero magnetic field. Together, these results reveal that H-tDB CrI_3 at intermediate twist angles host a distinct moiré magnetic phase, featuring periodic in-plane spin textures with broken rotational, mirror, and time-reversal symmetries, which is markedly different from the out-of-plane layered antiferromagnetism in bilayer CrI_3 and the predominantly out-of-plane moiré magnetism in R-tDB CrI_3. Our work establishes H-stacked CrI_3 moiré magnets as a versatile platform for engineering magnetic properties, including and likely beyond complex spin textures.

Title: Raman scattering from moiré phonons
Authors: Vitor Dantas, Héctor Ochoa, Rafael M. Fernandes, Natalia B. Perkins
Abstract: We develop a theoretical framework for probing moiré phonon modes using Raman spectroscopy, and illustrate it with the example of twisted bilayer graphene (TBG). These moiré phonons arise from interlayer sliding motion in twisted 2D materials and correspond to fluctuations of the stacking order in reconstructed moiré superlattices. These include both acoustic-like phason modes and a new set of low-energy optical modes originating from the zone-folding of monolayer graphene's acoustic modes, which are accessible via Raman spectroscopy. We show that the Raman response of TBG exhibits a series of low-frequency peaks that clearly distinguish it from that of decoupled layers. We further examine the role of anharmonic interactions in shaping the phonon linewidths and demonstrate the strong dependence of the Raman spectra on both the twist angle and the polarization of the incident light. Our findings establish Raman spectroscopy as a powerful tool for exploring moiré phonons in a broad class of twisted van der Waals systems.

Title: Robustness of Majorana modes to potential disorder in Fe chains on a superconducting Rashba alloy
Authors: Harim Jang, Daniel Crawford, Khai Ton That, Lucas Schneider, Jens Wiebe, Makoto Shimizu, Harald O. Jeschke, Stephan Rachel, Roland Wiesendanger
Abstract: Majorana modes offer great potential for fault-tolerant quantum computation due to their topological protection. However, for superconductor-semiconductor nanowire hybrids, intrinsic disorder makes the unambiguous detection of Majorana modes difficult. Here, we construct 1D spin chains from individual Fe atoms on the Rashba surface alloy BiAg2/Ag(111) with proximity-induced superconductivity from a Nb(110) substrate. While the Fe chains exhibit perfect crystalline order, we observe nano-scale potential disorder of the BiAg2/Ag(111)/Nb(110) heterostructure by scanning tunneling microscopy. However, this does not prevent the emergence of zero-energy modes at both ends of the Fe chains, in agreement with tight-binding calculations showing that they are only found in the topologically non-trivial regime of the phase diagram. These Majorana modes are indeed robust against potential disorder.

Title: A Morphologically Self-Consistent Phase Field Model for the Computational Study of Memristive Thin Film Current-Voltage Hysteresis
Authors: John F. Sevic, Ambroise Juston, Nobuhiko P. Kobayashi
Abstract: A multiphysics phase field model is used for the computational study of memristive thin film morphology and current-voltage hysteresis. In contrast to previous computational methods, no requirements are made on conducting filament geometry. Our method correctly predicts conducting filaments evolve on thermodynamic paths that are energetically favored due to stochastic structural and chemical variations naturally occurring at the atomic-level, due to both latent and intentional fabrication effects. These results have significant implications for the computational design of a broad class of memristive thin films, enabling practical wafer-scale mapping, uniformity, and endurance analysis and optimization.

Title: Sedimentation equilibrium as a probe of the pressure equation of state of active colloids
Authors: Yunhee Choi, Elijah Schiltz-Rouse, Parvin Bayati, Stewart A. Mallory
Abstract: We introduce a theoretical and computational framework for extracting the pressure equation of state (EoS) of an active suspension from its steady-state sedimentation profile. As EoSs are prerequisites for many theories in active matter, determining how pressure depends on key parameters such as density, activity, and interparticle interactions is essential to make quantitative predictions relevant to materials design and engineering applications. Focusing on the one-dimensional active Brownian particle (1D-ABP) model, we show that the pressure measured in a homogeneous periodic system can be recovered from the spatial profiles established in sedimentation equilibrium. Our approach is based on exact mechanical considerations and provides a direct route for determining pressure from experimentally measurable quantities. This work compares sedimentation-derived equations of state with those obtained from periodic simulations, establishing a foundation for using sedimentation as a generic tool to characterize the behavior of active suspensions.

Title: The influence of nitrogen doping and annealing on the silicon vacancy in 4H-SiC
Authors: Samuel G. Carter, Infiter Tathfif, Charity Burgess, Brenda VanMil, Suryakanti Debata, Pratibha Dev
Abstract: The silicon vacancy ($V_{Si}$) in 4H-SiC at its cubic site (V2-center) has shown significant promise for quantum technologies, due to coherent spin states, the mature material system, and stable optical emission. In these SiC-based applications, doping plays a crucial role. It can be used to control the charge state of $V_{Si}$ and formation of different types of defects. Despite its importance, there has been little research on the effects of doping. In this work, we perform a study of the effects of nitrogen doping and annealing on the photoluminescence (PL), optically-detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) contrast, and dephasing times of ensembles of V2 in epilayers of 4H-SiC. The results show an enhancement of PL that depends on the electron irradiation dose for a given electron concentration, supported by theoretical modeling of the charge state of $V_{Si}$ in the presence of nitrogen. Nitrogen substituted for carbon is shown to very efficiently donate one electron to $V_{Si}$. We also observe that the ODMR contrast can be increased from 0.5% in low doped SiC to 1.5% by nitrogen doping of $10^{17}$ to $10^{18}$ cm$^{-3}$ and annealing at 500-600 $^{\circ}$C for 1 hour, with only a 20% decrease in PL compared to unannealed. Some of the improvement in contrast is offset by a reduction in $T_2^*$ at these doping levels, but the estimated cw ODMR shot-noise limited sensitivity is still 1.6 times higher than that of undoped, unannealed SiC.

Title: Single crystalline orthorhombic GdAlGe as a rare earth magnetic Dirac nodal-line metal
Authors: Antu Laha, Juntao Yao, Asish K. Kundu, Niraj Aryal, Anil Rajapitamahuni, Elio Vescovo, Fernando Camino, Kim Kisslinger, Lihua Zhang, Dmytro Nykypanchuk, J. Sears, J. M. Tranquada, Weiguo Yin, Qiang Li
Abstract: Crystal engineering is a method for discovering new quantum materials and phases, which may be achieved by external pressure or strain. Chemical pressure is unique in that it generates internal pressure perpetually to the lattice. As an example, GdAlSi from the rare-earth ($R$) $R$Al$X$ ($X =$ Si or Ge) family of Weyl semimetals is considered. Replacing Si with the larger isovalent element Ge creates sufficiently large chemical pressure to induce a structural transition from the tetragonal structure of GdAlSi, compatible with a Weyl semimetallic state, to an orthorhombic phase in GdAlGe, resulting in an inversion-symmetry-protected nodal-line metal. We find that GdAlGe hosts an antiferromagnetic ground state with two successive orderings, at $T_\mathrm{N1}$ = 35 K and $T_\mathrm{N2}$ = 30 K. In-plane isothermal magnetization shows a magnetic field induced metamagnetic transition at 6.2 T for 2 K. Furthermore, electron-hole compensation gives rise to a large magnetoresistance of $\sim 100\%$ at 2 K and 14 T. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements and density functional theory calculations reveal a Dirac-like linear band dispersion over an exceptionally large energy range of $\sim$ 1.5 eV with a high Fermi velocity of $\sim 10^6$ m/s, a rare feature not observed in any magnetic topological materials.

Title: Hydrodynamic Equations for Active Brownian Particles in the High Persistence Regime
Authors: Martín Pinto-Goldberg, Rodrigo Soto
Abstract: Based on a recently proposed kinetic description of non-inertial active Brownian particles, Navier--Stokes-like equations are derived in the high persistence regime, where polarization is a slow field together with density. Using the Chapman--Enskog method, all transport coefficients in the equations are obtained in terms of microscopic quantities. A linear stability analysis of the homogeneous and isotropic state shows the appearance of a density instability, allowing us to determine the regions of phase space where the motility induced phase separation occurs. Numerical solutions of the equations in one spatial dimension show the need of an additional regularizing pressure term. With the inclusion of this term, the solutions illustrate in detail the clustering dynamics in homogeneous conditions, as well as the behavior that emerges when a gravitational field is applied in presence of a wall.

Title: On the Photoluminescence Theory in Nanocrystalline Silicon: A New Improvement
Authors: Arturo Ramírez-Porras
Abstract: Silicon has long been the foundational semiconductor material for a broad range of electronic devices, owing to its numerous advantages: wide natural availability, ease of synthesis in both crystalline and amorphous forms, and relatively low production cost. However, despite these benefits, silicon is inherently limited in the field of optoelectronics due to its indirect bandgap, which results in low quantum efficiency for light emission, typically in the infrared region. One promising strategy to address this limitation is the development of nanocrystalline silicon, which consists of low-dimensional nanostructures such as quantum wires (QWs) and quantum dots (QDs). These structures exhibit enhanced photoluminescence and electroluminescence, primarily due to quantum confinement of excitons within the conduction and valence bands, leading to significantly improved quantum efficiency. Although research into these processes has spanned several decades, a definitive consensus on the mechanisms underlying photoluminescent emission in nanocrystalline silicon remains elusive. This work reviews two leading theoretical models proposed to explain this phenomenon and introduces a new, more comprehensive model that may provide a deeper and more accurate understanding of photoluminescence in nanocrystalline silicon. The new theory is applied in a case study.

Title: A review of heat transport in solvated gold nanoparticles: Molecular dynamics modeling and experimental perspectives
Authors: Md Adnan Mahathir Munshi, Emdadul Haque Chowdhury, Luis E. Paniagua-Guerra, Jaymes Dionne, Ashutosh Giri, Bladimir Ramos-Alvarado
Abstract: Turning gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) into nanoscale heat sources via light irradiation has prompted significant research interest, particularly for biomedical applications over the past few decades. The AuNP's tunable photothermal effect, notable biocompatibility, and ability to serve as vehicles for temperature-sensitive chemical linkers enable thermo-therapeutics, such as localized drug/gene delivery and thermal ablation of cancerous tissue. Thermal transport in aqueous AuNP solutions stands as the fundamental challenge to developing targeted thermal therapies; thus, this review article surveys recent advancements in our understanding of heat transfer and surface chemistry in AuNPs, with a particular focus on thermal boundary conductance across gold- and functionalized-gold-water interfaces. This review article highlights computational advances based on molecular dynamics simulations that offer valuable insights into nanoscopic interfacial heat transfer in solvated interfaces, particularly for chemically functionalized AuNPs. Additionally, it outlines current experimental techniques for measuring interfacial thermal transport, their limitations, and potential pathways to improve sensitivity. This review further examines computational methodologies to guide the accurate modeling of solvated gold interfaces. Finally, it concludes with a discussion of future research directions aimed at deepening our understanding of interfacial heat transfer in solvated AuNPs, crucial to optimize thermoplasmonic applications.

Title: Interfacial instability of confined 3D active droplets
Authors: Bennett C. Sessa, Federico Cao, Robert A. Pelcovits, Thomas R. Powers, Guillaume Duclos
Abstract: Instabilities of fluid-fluid interfaces are ubiquitous in passive soft matter. Adding activity to the interface or either fluid can dramatically change the stability of the interface. Using experiment and theory, we investigate the interfacial instability of a deformable 3D active nematic liquid crystal droplet in the isotropic phase surrounded by a passive fluid and confined between two parallel plates. Spontaneous active flows drive the growth of undulations along the active/passive interface, with the mode number of the fastest-growing mode increasing with droplet radius and decreasing with gap height. We apply the lubrication approximation to a minimal nematohydrodynamic model to determine the growth rates of all interfacial modes. The magnitude of the growth rate is determined by the active timescale and the relaxation timescales associated with liquid crystalline order, as well as capillary and viscous stresses. We find multiple points of agreement between experiment and theory, including the shape evolution of individual droplets, the growth rates of unstable modes averaged across many droplets, and the extensional shear flows observed within droplets.

Title: Large volume 'chunk' lift out for 3D tomographic analysis using analytical plasma focussed ion beam -- scanning electron microscopy
Authors: Ruth Birch, Shuheng Li, Sharang Sharang, Warren J. Poole, Ben Britton
Abstract: Characterization of the structure and properties of materials in three dimensions, including grains and the residual pattern of deformation, provides necessary information required to guide materials design as well as support materials modelling efforts. In this work, we present an overview of site-specific large volume 'chunk' lift out and 3D serial sectioning of substantive volumes (e.g. 200 x 200 x 400 um3), where sectioning is optimized for 3D electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) based crystallographic analysis, using a plasma (Xe) focussed ion beam scanning electron microscope (plasma FIB-SEM) equipped to perform EBSD using a 'static' configuration (i.e. slicing and EBSD-mapping are performed without moving the sample). This workflow is demonstrated through the 3D plasma FIB-SEM based EBSD analysis of an indent made within a polycrystal of pure magnesium. The lift out approach is suitable for a wide range of materials, and we offer a step-by-step guide within the present work to provide opportunity for others to more easily enter this field and collect valuable data.

Abstract: This review exhaustively evaluates the role of nanomaterials across synthesis, characterization and application stages of biofuel systems. The common types of nanomaterials that are used for biofuel applications include metal oxides, carbon-based structures, and hybrids are evaluated for their effectiveness in efficient biofuel production. The properties of such nanomaterials are being utilized as an aid to produce biofuels through improved catalysis, enzyme immobilization and thermal stability. Common synthesis methods such as sol-gel, co-precipitation, and green synthesis are compared, alongside characterization tools like TEM, SEM, FTIR, and BET. This study focuses on transesterification, biomass pretreatment, and fermentation processes, where nanomaterials significantly improve yield and reusability. There are several challenges despite the merit of using nanomaterials, the tradeoffs include costs, scalability, and environmental impact, which further expands into evaluating the life cycle of such materials being used. This review outlines the practical potential of the nanomaterials in enabling more efficient and sustainable biofuel production.

Title: Physisorption on Nanomechanical Resonators: The Overlooked Influence of Trace Moisture
Authors: Hemant Kumar Verma, Suman Kumar Mandal, Darkasha Khan, Faizan Tariq Beigh, Manoj Kandpal, Jaspreet Singh, Sushobhan Avasthi, Srinivasan Raghavan, Akshay Naik
Abstract: Short gas pulses introduced in a vacuum chamber have long been utilized to showcase the ultra-low mass resolutions achievable with nanomechanical resonators. The resonance frequency shifts are used as evidence of gas adsorption. However, there is very little clarity as to what exactly is adsorbing on to the resonators. We demonstrate that the physisorption of gases on cantilevers is predominantly the effect of moisture content that is present even in ultra-high purity gases. The experimental work is performed at low temperatures and in a high vacuum and is supported by theoretical calculations and simulation.

Title: The free propagator of strongly anisotropic systems with free surfaces
Authors: M.A. Shpot
Abstract: A brief overview of fluctuation-induced forces in statistical systems with film geometry at the critical point and the calculation of Casimir amplitudes, which characterize these forces quantitatively, is presented. Particular attention is paid to the special features of strongly anisotropic $m$-axis systems at the Lifshitz point, specifically, in the case of a "$perpendicular$" orientation of surfaces with free boundary conditions. Beyond the simplest one-loop approximation, calculations of Casimir amplitudes are impossible without knowledge of the Gaussian propagator, which corresponds to the lines of Feynman diagrams in the perturbation theory. We present an explicit expression for such a propagator in the case of an anisotropic system confined by parallel surfaces $perpendicular$ to one of the anisotropy axes. Using this propagator, we reproduce the one-loop result derived earlier in an essentially different way. The knowledge of the propagator provides the possibility of higher-order calculations in perturbation theory.

Title: Morphoelastic ribbons: Differential growth-induced curvature and torsion
Authors: Hao Liu, Mingwu Li, Dabiao Liu
Abstract: Natural slender structures, such as plant leaves, petals, and tendrils, often exhibit complex three-dimensional (3D) morphologies-including twisting, helical coiling, and saddle-bending-driven by differential growth. The resulting internal stresses are partially relieved through the development of intrinsic curvature and torsion. The fundamental challenge lies in effectively correlating microscopic growth fields to the macroscopic shapes and mechanical responses of the ribbon structures. However, existing ribbon or shell models struggle to directly link growth gradients to macroscopic curvature and torsion, necessitating a reduced-dimensional framework. This work establishes a unified one-dimensional (1D) morphoelastic ribbon model derived rigorously from 3D finite elasticity theory via a two-step asymptotic dimension reduction. The reduced-order model captures key geometric nonlinearities and finite rotations while retaining explicit dependence on the growth tensor. We obtain analytical solutions for saddle-bending and twisting configurations induced by specific growth gradients. Furthermore, numerical continuation, based on the reduced model, reveals post-buckling transitions into helical morphologies, identifying bifurcation thresholds and constructing phase diagrams. This framework explicitly links growth fields to ribbon curvature and torsion, providing fundamental mechanics insights into the morphogenesis of slender plant organs and offering the potential for bioinspired soft robotics design.

Title: Field-Free Superconducting Diode Enabled by Geometric Asymmetry and Perpendicular Magnetization
Authors: Jiaxu Li, Zijian Zhang, Shiqi Wang, Yu He, Haochang Lyu, Qiusha Wang, Bowen Dong, Daoqian Zhu, Hisakazu Matsuki, Dapeng Zhu, Guang Yang, Weisheng Zhao
Abstract: The superconducting diode effect (SDE)- manifested as directional, dissipationless supercurrents - is pivotal for realizing energy-efficient superconducting logic and memory technologies. Achieving high-efficiency SDE without external magnetic fields, however, remains a fundamental challenge. Here, we report a strongly enhanced, field-free SDE in Pt/Co/Nb heterostructures, enabled by the interplay of engineered geometric asymmetry and stray fields from a perpendicularly magnetized Co layer. This configuration promotes directional vortex entry and spatially selective pinning, yielding diode efficiencies that exceed all previously reported field-free values. Temperature- and field-dependent transport measurements, supported by micromagnetic simulations, reveal that the enhanced nonreciprocity stems from three cooperative mechanisms: asymmetric vortex entry, localized magnetic pinning, and Lorentz-force imbalance. These findings establish a scalable, CMOS-compatible platform for high-performance superconducting rectifiers, offering new opportunities for cryogenic spintronics and quantum electronics.

Authors: Fabian A. Garcia Daza, Alvaro Rodriguez-Rivas, Fernando Govantes, Alejandro Cuetos
Abstract: The diffusion of particles in complex media has gained significant interest due to its dual relevance: probing the viscoelastic properties of materials via microrheology and assessing the extent of particle displacement over time. In this work, we explore the early-stage diffusion of a tracer particle within a developing bacterial biofilm using implicit-solvent Brownian dynamics simulations. At these initial stages, bacterial colonies form two-dimensional structures that expand through cell growth and division. Employing an agent-based computational model (IbM), we analyse the passive diffusion of a spherical tracer within colonies of varying compaction levels. Our findings reveal that, at very short timescales, tracer diffusion follows a standard diffusive regime, modulated by colony ageing. However, at longer times, the dominant factor governing tracer motion is colony growth, which effectively confines the tracer within the expanding structure, except in cases where the microcolony is highly unstructured or the tracer is sufficiently small. Additionally, through MR techniques, we quantify the elastic and viscous moduli of the growing microcolony, offering insight into its evolving viscoelastic behavior.

Title: Brightening dark trions in WS2 monolayers via introducing atomic sulfur vacancies
Authors: Xuguang Cao, Wanggui Ye, Debao Zhang, Ji Zhou, Lei Peng, Changcheng Zheng, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Jiqiang Ning, Shijie Xu
Abstract: Understanding the effects of atomic defects on the optical functionality of two-dimensional (2D) layered materials is critical to develop novel optical and optoelectronic applications of these ultimate materials. Herein, we correlate sulfur vacancies (VS) and luminescence properties of dark trions in monolayer WS2 through introducing VS defects and conducting a systematic optical spectroscopic characterization at cryogenic and room temperatures. It is unraveled that the VS defects can brighten the dark trions via introducing a stronger spin-orbit coupling due to the space inversion symmetry broken by the defects. Furthermore, the wavefunction localization of the dark trions bound at VS defects results in significant enhancement of the phonon scattering from the K2 valley phonons and hence makes the K2 phonon replica dominant in the emission spectrum. Theoretical calculations of the temperature-dependent photoluminescence spectra with quantum mechanics-based multimode Brownian oscillator model show strong support for the above arguments. Brightening the dark excitons not only sheds light on the understanding of the intriguing excitonic properties of 2D semiconductors, but also may open a way for regulating the optoelectronic performance of two-dimensional semiconductors.

Title: Vertex corrections to nonlinear photoinduced currents in 2D superconductors
Authors: A. V. Parafilo, V. M. Kovalev, I. G. Savenko
Abstract: The emergence of a rectified steady-state supercurrent as a response to the photoexcited current of the quasiparticles constitutes the concept of a superconducting photodiode. This phenomenon occurs in a two-dimensional thin superconducting film with a built-in DC supercurrent that is exposed to a circularly polarized external electromagnetic field. The flow of a Cooper-pair condensate, resulting as a second-order photo-response in a direction transverse to the initially built-in supercurrent, represents a superconducting counterpart to the photogalvanic effect. In this paper, we examine the photodiode supercurrent by restoring gauge invariance within the mean-field BCS framework. To achieve this, we derive an impurity-sensitive BCS-interaction-induced correction to the vertex function by performing self-consistent calculations within the Keldysh Green's function technique. The resulting photodiode current can be utilized for spectroscopic analysis of typical relaxation times in superconducting films.

Title: Resolving the Ti-V Phase Diagram Discrepancy with First-Principles Calculations and Bayesian Learning
Authors: Timofei Miryashkin, Olga Klimanova, Alexander Shapeev
Abstract: Conflicting experiments disagree on whether the titanium-vanadium (Ti-V) binary alloy exhibits a body-centred cubic (BCC) miscibility gap or remains completely soluble. A leading hypothesis attributes the miscibility gap to oxygen contamination during alloy preparation. To resolve this controversy, we use an ab initio + machine-learning workflow that couples an actively-trained Moment Tensor Potential to Bayesian thermodynamic inference. Using this workflow, we obtain Ti-V binary system across the entire composition range, together with confidence intervals in the thermodynamic limit. The resulting diagram reproduces all experimental features, demonstrating the robustness of our approach, and clearly favors the variant with a BCC miscibility gap terminating at T = 980 K and c = 0.67. Because oxygen was excluded from simulations, the gap cannot be attributed to impurity effects, contradicting recent CALPHAD reassessments.

Title: Wealth Thermalization Hypothesis
Authors: Klaus M. Frahm, Dima L. Shepelyansky
Abstract: We introduce the wealth thermalization hypothesis according to which the wealth shared in a country or the whole world is described by the Rayleigh-Jeans thermal distribution with two conserved quantities of system wealth and norm or number of agents. This distribution depends on a dimensional parameter being the ratio of system total wealth and its dispersion range determined by highest revenues. At relatively small values of this ratio there is a formation of the Rayleigh-Jeans condensate, well studied in such physical systems as multimode optical fibers. This leads to a huge fraction of poor households and a small oligarchic fraction which monopolizes a dominant fraction of total wealth thus generating a strong inequality in human society. We show that this thermalization gives a good description of real data of Lorenz curves of US, UK, the whole world and capitalization of S\&P500 companies at New York Stock Exchange. Possible actions for inequality reduction are briefly discussed.

Title: Atomic layer deposition on particulate materials from 1988 through 2023: A quantitative review of technologies, materials and applications
Authors: Peter M. Piechulla, Mingliang Chen, Aristeidis Goulas, Riikka L. Puurunen, J. Ruud van Ommen
Abstract: Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is widely studied for numerous applications and is commercially employed in the semiconductor industry, where planar substrates are the norm. However, the inherent ALD feature of coating virtually any surface geometry with atomistic thickness control is equally attractive for coating particulate materials (supports). In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the developments in this decades-old field of ALD on particulate materials, drawing on a bottom-up and quantitative analysis of 799 articles from this field. The obtained dataset is the basis for abstractions regarding reactor types (specifically for particles), coating materials, reactants, supports and processing conditions. Furthermore, the dataset enables direct access to specific processing conditions (for a given material, surface functionality, application etc.) and increases accessibility of the respective literature. We also review fundamental concepts of ALD on particles, and discuss the most common applications, i.e., catalysis (thermo-, electro-, photo-), batteries, luminescent phosphors and healthcare. Finally, we identify historical trends, and provide an outlook on prospective developments.

Title: Room-temperature intrinsic nonlinear planar Hall effect in TaIrTe4
Authors: Chang Jiang, Fan Yang, Jinshan Yang, Peng Yu, Huiying Liu, Yuda Zhang, Zehao Jia, Xiangyu Cao, Jingyi Yan, Zheng Liu, Xian-Lei Sheng, Cong Xiao, Shengyuan A. Yang, Shaoming Dong, Faxian Xiu
Abstract: Intrinsic responses are of paramount importance in physics research, as they represent the inherent properties of materials, independent of extrinsic factors that vary from sample to sample, and often reveal the intriguing quantum geometry of the band structure. Here, we report the experimental discovery of a new intrinsic response in charge transport, specifically the intrinsic nonlinear planar Hall effect (NPHE), in the topological semimetal TaIrTe4. This effect is characterized by an induced Hall current that is quadratic in the driving electric field and linear in the in-plane magnetic field. The response coefficient is determined by the susceptibility tensor of Berry-connection polarizability dipole, which is an intrinsic band geometric quantity. Remarkably, the signal persists up to room temperature. Our theoretical calculations show excellent agreement with the experimental results and further elucidate the significance of a previously unknown orbital mechanism in intrinsic NPHE. This finding not only establishes a novel intrinsic material property but also opens a new route toward innovative nonlinear devices capable of operating at room temperature.

Title: Spin-1/2 operators exactly mapped to spinful canonical Fermi operators present in two bands
Authors: Zsolt Gulacsi
Abstract: Recently it has been shown that the quantum spin-1/2 spin operators can be exactly transformed not only in spinless, but also in spinful canonical Fermi operators in 1D [\cite{JW1}], and 2D [\cite{JW2}] as well. In this paper, using the same technique based on an extended Jordan-Wigner transformation, we show in 1D, that the quantum spin-1/2 operators can be exactly transformed also in spinful canonical Fermi operators of spin-1/2 fermions that are belong to two bands.

Title: Residual Connection-Enhanced ConvLSTM for Lithium Dendrite Growth Prediction
Authors: Hosung Lee, Byeongoh Hwang, Dasan Kim, Myungjoo Kang
Abstract: The growth of lithium dendrites significantly impacts the performance and safety of rechargeable batteries, leading to short circuits and capacity degradation. This study proposes a Residual Connection-Enhanced ConvLSTM model to predict dendrite growth patterns with improved accuracy and computational efficiency. By integrating residual connections into ConvLSTM, the model mitigates the vanishing gradient problem, enhances feature retention across layers, and effectively captures both localized dendrite growth dynamics and macroscopic battery behavior. The dataset was generated using a phase-field model, simulating dendrite evolution under varying conditions. Experimental results show that the proposed model achieves up to 7% higher accuracy and significantly reduces mean squared error (MSE) compared to conventional ConvLSTM across different voltage conditions (0.1V, 0.3V, 0.5V). This highlights the effectiveness of residual connections in deep spatiotemporal networks for electrochemical system modeling. The proposed approach offers a robust tool for battery diagnostics, potentially aiding in real-time monitoring and optimization of lithium battery performance. Future research can extend this framework to other battery chemistries and integrate it with real-world experimental data for further validation

Title: 2D Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Model with static domain walls and quasiperiodic disorder
Authors: Surajit Mandal, Satyaki Kar
Abstract: We revisit the problem of a two dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model on a square lattice to first minutely analyze its spectra including zero energy states (ZES) and in-gap states both under periodic and open boundaries. Thereafter, a series of antiphase domain walls (DW), distributed along two orthogonal lines, are introduced in the lattice with SSH like hoppings and this causes the ZES to localize not only at the corners but also at the intersection of the lines of domain walls. In-gap states not only populate at the edges but also show finite amplitudes along the DW lines. A different scenario appears for a radially symmetric distribution of domain walls along a circle around a poit within the lattice. It produces in-gap states localized at the center of the DW circle while the ZES show localizations around it in a symmetric fashion in the square lattice. We also probe the effect of a diagonal quasiperiodic disorder on the spectra and eigen-states of the 2D SSH model. This gives localization of the states more with a stronger disorder. We calculate participation ratios of the states and their averages to demonstrate how such localization develops with disorder. Lastly we also elaborate further on the eigenvalue and eigenstates of a few periodically hopping modulated cases, previously outlined briefly in the article: Jour. Phys. Cond.-Mat.{\bf 36}, 065301 (2024) and also give an account of the changed features of the spectra as a result of the application of DWs there. Our findings on these various fronts can increase many-fold the visibility of this popular model and the outcomes can be utilized in many emerging fields like topological quantum information processing, for example, by designing topological shielding of various kinds.

Title: Ab initio calculation of electronic band structure of Cd$_{1-x}$Fe$_x$Se
Authors: Matanat A. Mehrabova, Elshad Allahyarov, Niyazi H. Hasanov, Nurana R. Gasimova
Abstract: The purpose of this work was to calculate the electronic band structure of Cd$_{1-x}$Fe$_x$Se. Ab-initio, calculations are performed in the Atomistix Toolkit program within the Density Functional Theory and Local Spin Density Approximation on Tight Tiger basis. We have used Hubbard U potential $U_{Fe} = 2.42$eV for 3d states for Fe ions. Super-cells of 8 and 64 atoms were constructed. After the construction of Cd$_{1-x}$Fe$_x$Se ($x=$ 6.25%; 25%) super-cells, atom relaxation and optimization of the crystal structure were carried out. Electronic band structure,and density of states were calculated, and total energy have been defined in antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic phases. The band gap for the Cd$_{1-x}$Fe$_x$Se, $x=0.06$ in ferromagnetic phase is equal to $E_g=1.77$ eV, in antiferromagnetic phase $E_g=1.78$ eV. For $x=0.25$, $E_g=1.92$ eV. Antiferromagnetic phase considered more stable. Our calculations show that the band gap increases with the increases in Fe ion concentration.

Title: CLAMM: a spin CLuster expansion--Monte Carlo toolkit for Alloys and Magnetic Materials
Authors: Brian Blankenau, Tianyu Su, Namhoon Kim, Elif Ertekin
Abstract: Finite-temperature magnetism gives rise to many phenomena in alloy materials, such as magnetic phase transformations, short or medium range order in magnetic alloys, spin waves, critical phenomena, and the magnetocaloric effect. Lattice models, such as the Ising, Potts, cluster expansion, and magnetic cluster expansion models, are powerful tools for studying complex magnetic alloys and compounds. In this paper we introduce CLAMM, which is a new open source toolkit for developing custom lattice models from density functional theory (DFT) data sets. The toolkit is comprised of three main components. The first component is CLAMM_Prep, a python tool that converts data sets consisting of the Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP) DFT simulations into a compact format. The second component, CLAMM_Fit, is also python-based and uses the compact data set to parameterize a lattice model, chosen from a set of available options (cluster expansion, Ising, and others). The third component is CLAMM_MC, which is a C++ Monte Carlo solver for generating ensembles of configurations, accounting for both magnetic and alloy configurational entropies, at different temperatures. These ensembles and their analysis can be used for simulating phase transformations and constructing phase diagrams. The code can also be used for generating special quasi-random structures and structures with user-defined short-range order. This document provides a comprehensive overview of each CLAMM tool in order to demonstrate CLAMM's potential for the computational materials community.

Title: States decoupled from the surface in short Si atomic chains
Authors: Tomasz Kwapiński, Marek Dachniewicz, Marcin Kurzyna, Mieczysław Jałochowski
Abstract: We analyze both the stationary and time-dependent properties of molecular states in atomic chains on a surface, some of which are composed of atomic states decoupled from the substrate - a phenomenon analogous to dark states in quantum dot systems. To illustrate this effect at the atomic scale, we performed scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) experiments on short silicon chains fabricated on a Si(553)-Au surface. In contrast to quantum dots, which typically involve characteristic energies in the meV range or lower, the atomic chains studied here operate in a high-energy regime, with energies in the eV range. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the local density of states of the chains carries clear signatures of these decoupled states, which significantly affect STM imaging. The topography becomes highly sensitive to the bias polarity, to the extent that some atomic sites may appear nearly invisible to the STM tip. Our time-resolved theoretical analysis reveals that these decoupled states emerge over a finite time interval. This oscillatory dynamical evolution, primarily driven by nearest-neighbor interactions, suggests a universal relaxation mechanism that is largely insensitive to the length of the atomic chain.

Title: Non-algebraic first return probability of a stretched random walk near a convex boundary and its effect on adsorption
Authors: Daniil Fedotov, Sergei Nechaev
Abstract: The $N$-step random walk, stretched in the vicinity of a disc (in 2D) or a sphere (in 3D) of radius $R$, demonstrates a non-algebraic stretched exponential decay $P_N\sim \exp\left(-{\rm const}\, N^{1/3}\right)$ for the first return probability $P_N$ in the double-scaling limit $N=\frac{L}{a}\gg 1, \frac{R}{a}\gg 1$ conditioned that $\frac{L}{R}=c={\rm const}$. Stretching means that the length of the walk, $L=Na$ (where $a$ is the unit step length) satisfies the condition $L = cR$, where $c > \pi$. Both analytic and numerical evidences of the non-algebraic behavior of $P_N$ are provided. Considering the model of a polymer loop stretched ("inflated") by external force, we show that non-algebraic behavior of $P_N$ affects the adsorption of a polymer at the boundary of a sticky disc in 2D, manifesting in a first order localization transition.

Title: Boosting biocompatibility and mechanical property evolution in a high-entropy alloy via nanostructure engineering and phase transformations
Authors: Thanh Tam Nguyen, Payam Edalati, Shivam Dangwal, Karina Danielle Pereira, Alessandra Cremasco, Ricardo Floriano, Augusto Ducati Luchessi, Kaveh Edalati
Abstract: High-entropy alloys (HEAs), as multi-component materials with high configurational entropy, have garnered significant attention as new biomaterials; still, their low yield stress and high elastic modulus need to be overcome for future biomedical applications. In this study, nanograin generation is used to enhance the strength and phase transformation is employed to reduce the elastic modulus of a biocompatible Ti-Zr-Hf-Nb-Ta-based HEA. The alloy is treated via the high-pressure torsion (HPT) process, leading to (i) a BCC (body-centered cubic) to omega phase transformation with [101]{\omega}//[011]BCC and [211]omega//[121]BCC through a twining mechanism, (ii) nanograin formation with a mean grain size of 20 nm, and (iii) dislocation generation particularly close to BCC-omega interphase boundaries. These structural and microstructural features enhance hardness, increase tensile strength up to 2130 MPa, achieve tensile elongation exceeding 13%, reduce elastic modulus down to 69 GPa and improve biocompatibility. Additionally, the HEA exhibits improved anodization, resulting in a homogenous distribution of oxide nanotubes on the surface with a smaller tube diameter and a higher tube length compared to pure titanium. These remarkable properties, which are engineered by the generation of defective nanograins and the co-existence of BCC and metastable omega phases, highlight the potential of HEAs treated using severe plastic deformation for future biomedical usage, particularly in the orthopedic sector.

Title: Influence of nanostructuring through high-pressure torsion (HPT) on superconductivity of a high-entropy alloy
Authors: Kaveh Edalati, Alexy Bertrand, Payam Edalati, Thanh Tam Nguyen, Nariman Enikeev, Masaki Mito
Abstract: High-entropy alloys (HEAs) have emerged as favorable choices for different applications, including superconductors. The present work examines the impact of nanostructuring via high-pressure torsion (HPT) on the superconducting properties of the equiatomic TiZrHfNbTa HEA. Structural characterization reveals a progressive refinement of grain size and increased dislocation density, together with partial phase transformation to an {\omega} phase with HPT processing. Magnetic susceptibility and magnetization measurements indicate a systematic enhancement in the superconducting transition temperature (from $T_c =$ 6.2 K to 7.2 K) and critical magnetic field, as well as the stabilization of the superconductivity state by HPT processing. The improvement of superconducting properties is attributed to microstructural modifications such as grain boundary density, defect generation and phase transformations, and their impact on vortex pinning, quantum confinement and electron scattering. The results suggest that nanostructuring through severe plastic deformation provides an appropriate route to optimize superconducting properties in high-entropy superconductors.

Title: A continuous damage accumulation scenario for elastomeric frictional wear
Authors: Ombeline Taisne, Julien Caillard, Côme Thillaye du Boullay, Marc Couty, Costantino Creton, Jean Comtet
Abstract: Understanding how materials wear off following frictional sliding is a long-standing question in tribology. In this respect, the particular case of the wear of soft rubbery elastomeric materials stands apart: tire wear produces several million tonnes of abraded materials per year, bearing immense industrial and environmental impact, while the soft nature of elastomers and their inability to accommodate plastic deformation before failure renders their wear mechanisms almost intractable. Here, we harness mechanochemical approaches on model elastomeric materials, to reveal that mild elastomeric wear does not proceed from crack propagation processes, but rather from the continuous accumulation of diffuse damage by chain scission, extending well below the surface of the material. Damage accumulates in a discontinuous manner through micro-slippage events at the rough contacting asperities, with in-depth damage extension set by the characteristic asperity size. Surprisingly, damage grows through a slow logarithmic-like process over successive cycles, which we interpret as the occurrence of stress-activated scission events in a broad strand elastic energy landscape. These observations point to the probabilistic nature of this fatigue-like damage accumulation mechanism and allow us to formulate the wear rate as an integral of the damage cumulated over successive asperity sliding. Finally, by tuning the molecular architecture of our materials, we evidence an antagonistic relation between fracture resistance and wear resilience, set by the sensitivity of the material to stress fluctuations. Revealing the role of previously invisible subsurface damage in elastomeric wear, our approach should stimulate further physical-based approaches allowing for the development of sustainable and wear-resilient materials.

Title: Computational Discovery of Metastable NaMnO$_2$ Polymorphs as High-Performance Cathodes with Ultralow Na$^+$ Migration Barriers
Authors: Fukuan Wang, Chen Zhou, Busheng Wang, Yong Liu
Abstract: Using an ab initio evolutionary algorithm combined with first-principles calculations, two metastable NaMnO$_2$ polymorphs, $I4_1/amd$ and Cmcm, are identified as promising cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries. Both phases exhibit excellent thermodynamic stability, lying within 35~meV/atom of the ground-state \textit{Pmmn} phase across 0--50~GPa, and are dynamically and thermally stable under ambient conditions following high-pressure synthesis, as confirmed by phonon and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. During desodiation, a Jahn--Teller-induced magnetic transition enhances Mn--O hybridization, reduces the bandgap, and promotes robust charge compensation and oxygen retention. Remarkably, the Cmcm phase achieves record-low Na$^+$ migration barriers (0.39~eV at high Na concentration; 0.27~eV at low concentration), representing 47\% and 36\% reductions respectively compared to conventional $C2/m$, while delivering a higher average voltage (3.19~V vs 2.88~V). The $I4_1/amd$ phase exhibits concentration-dependent diffusion with a low-energy pathway (0.38~eV) and maintains competitive voltage (2.94~V). These findings suggest that metastable NaMnO$_2$ polymorphs may offer viable alternatives to conventional cathode materials, particularly where fast ionic conduction is required.

Title: Polarons with arbitrary nonlinear electron-phonon interaction
Authors: Stefano Ragni, Tomislav Miškić, Thomas Hahn, Nikolay Prokof'ev, Osor S. Barišić, Naoto Nagaosa, Cesare Franchini, Andrey S. Mishchenko
Abstract: We develop an exact computational method based on numerical X-propagators for solving polaron models with arbitrary nonlinear couplings of local vibration modes to the electron density and magnitude of the hopping amplitude. Our approach covers various polaron models, some of which were impossible to treat by any existing approximation-free techniques. Moreover, it remains efficient in the most relevant but computationally challenging regime of phonon frequencies much smaller than the electron bandwidth. As a case study, we consider the double-well type nonlinear model with quadratic ($g_2<0$) and quartic ($g_4>0$) interactions describing a broad class of technologically important materials, such as quantum paraelectric compounds and halide perovskites. We observe, depending on the model parameters, three qualitatively different regimes: (i) quantum interplay of quartic and quadratic interactions which suppresses effects of the quadratic coupling, (ii) intermediate-coupling regime with exponential $\propto \exp(\alpha g_2 \Omega^{-1/4})$ scaling of the quasiparticle weight and mass renormalization, and (iii) strong-coupling asymptotic behavior.

Title: Stacking-Dependent Electronic Properties in GaSe/GaTe Heterobilayers: A First-Principles Study
Authors: Hsin-Yi Liu, Jhao-Ying Wu
Abstract: In this study, we use first-principles calculations to investigate the stacking-dependent electronic properties of GaSe/GaTe van der Waals heterobilayers. By analyzing five representative stacking configurations--AA, AA$'$, A$'$C, A$'$B, and AB--we show that interlayer atomic registry affects orbital hybridization and interfacial interactions, leading to distinct electronic structures and stabilities. Projected density of states analyses reveal valence and conduction band edges arise from orbitals localized in different layers, confirming a type-II band alignment that facilitates spatial charge separation. Orbital contributions and spectral features vary with stacking, reflecting how interlayer coupling modulates hybridization and electronic behavior. This study provides atomic-level insights for designing and optimizing layered heterostructures in nanoelectronic devices.

Title: Spin Polarization Control via Magnetic Field in Dissipative Bosonic Systems
Authors: Yaoyuan Fan, Shuoyu Shi, Lang Cao, Qiuxin Zhang, Dong Hu, Yu Wang, Xiaoji Zhou
Abstract: Engineering spin polarization in dissipative bosonic systems is crucial for advancing quantum technologies, especially for applications in quantum metrology and space-based quantum simulations. This work demonstrates precise magnetic moment control in multicomponent Bose gases during evaporative cooling via tailored magnetic fields. By adjusting the magnetic field gradients, null point position, and duration, we selectively tune evaporation rates of magnetic sublevels, achieving targeted spin polarization. Theoretical models, validated by numerical simulations and Stern-Gerlach experiments, reveal how magnetic fields reshape trapping potentials and spin-dependent dissipation. The results establish a dissipative spin-selection mechanism governing polarization evolution in evaporatively cooled Bose gases and provide a framework for engineering spin-polarized quantum states.

Title: Threshold Displacement Energies of Oxygen in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$: A Multi-Physics Analysis
Authors: Ashley Dickson, Mark R. Gilbert, Duc Nguyen-Manh, Samuel T. Murphy
Abstract: Neutron bombardment of high temperature superconducting (HTS) magnets may compromise the integrity of the magnetic confinement in future fusion reactors. The amount of damage produced by a single neutron can be predicted from the threshold displacement energies (TDE) of the constituent ions in the HTS materials, such as the Rare Earth Cuperates. Therefore, in this work a Multiphysics simulation approach is adopted to determine the threshold displacement energies for oxygen in YBa2Cu3O7. Classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are employed to determine statistically representative TDEs for all four oxygen sites and these results are validated using Born-Oppenheimer MD employing forces derived from Density Functional Theory (DFT). The simulations were performed at the operational temperature (25 K) and the temperature of existing neutron irradiation studies (360 K) enabling a discussion about the relevance of this data. Overall, these findings enhance our understanding of radiation-induced damage in HTS materials and provide data that can be incorporated into higher order models offering critical insights into shielding design and magnet longevity.

Title: Kitaev model in regular hyperbolic tilings
Authors: Julien Vidal, Rémy Mosseri
Abstract: We study the Kitaev model on regular hyperbolic trivalent tilings. Depending on the length $p$ of the elementary polygons, we examine two distinct tri-colorings of the tiling. Using a recent conjecture on the ground-state flux sector, we compute the phase diagram via exact diagonalizations and derive analytical expressions for the effective Hamiltonians in the isolated-dimer limit which are valid for all values of $p$. Our results interpolates between the Euclidean honeycomb lattice and the trivalent Bethe lattice ($p=\infty$) for which we derive the exact solution of the phase boundaries.

Title: Exploring the impact of Ti/Al on L12 nanoprecipitation and deformation behavior in CoNiFeAlTi multi-principal element alloys through atomistic simulations
Authors: Amin Esfandiarpour, Anshul D. S. Parmar, Silvia Bonfanti, Pawel Sobkowicz, Byeong-Joo Lee, Mikko Alava
Abstract: Recent studies on CoNi-based multi-principal element alloys (MPEAs) have demonstrated high strength and ductility, attributed to the formation of stable L12 nanoscale precipitates. However, the fundamental mechanisms behind such impressive properties in these complex alloys are not well understood. In this work, we investigate the effects of Ti and Al concentrations on the formation of L12 precipitates in (CoNiFe)84(Al8Ti8), (CoNiFe)86(Al7Ti7), (CoNiFe)88(Al6Ti6), and (CoNiFe)94(Al4Ti2) MPEAs using hybrid molecular dynamics/Monte Carlo (MD/MC) simulations and a MEAM interatomic potential for the CoNiFeTiAl system. Additionally, we study the effect of L12 precipitation on the mechanical properties and stacking fault energy (SFE) of these MPEAs using MD. Our hybrid MD/MC simulations show that the (CoNiFe)86(Al7Ti7) alloy exhibits the highest amount of L12 nanoprecipitates. We find that L12 precipitation increases the SFE, with higher Al and Ti contents leading to greater increases. Tensile simulations reveal that L12 precipitates enhance yield strength, with alloys exhibiting higher precipitation showing increased flow stress. We also investigate dislocation-nanoprecipitate interactions with different precipitate sizes in the (CoNiFe)86(Al7Ti7) alloy. Larger nanoprecipitate sizes result in stronger dislocation pinning. Dislocations predominantly shear through 4-8 nm precipitates instead of looping around them (Orowan mechanism), enhancing strength while maintaining good ductility. Although the lattice mismatch between the L12 nanoprecipitate and the matrix is low (0.139%), the significant difference in SFE between the L12 nanoprecipitate and the matrix results in stronger dislocation pinning. This understanding can guide the design of MPEAs with tailored properties by controlling nanoscale precipitation.

Title: Mechanical inhibition of dissipation in a thermodynamically consistent active solid
Authors: Luca Cocconi, Michalis Chatzittofi, Ramin Golestanian
Abstract: The study of active solids offers a window into the mechanics and thermodynamics of dense living matter. A key aspect of the non-equilibrium dynamics of such active systems is a mechanistic description of how the underlying mechano-chemical couplings arise, which cannot be resolved in models that are phenomenologically constructed. Here, we follow a bottom-up theoretical approach to develop a thermodynamically consistent active solid (TCAS) model, and uncover a non-trivial cross-talk that naturally ensues between mechanical response and dissipation. In particular, we show that dissipation reaches a maximum at finite stresses, while it is inhibited under large stresses, effectively reverting the system to a passive state. Our findings establish a mechanism potentially responsible for the non-monotonic behaviour observed in recent experimental measurements of entropy production rate in an actomyosin material.

Title: Pairing-induced Momentum-space Magnetism and Its Implication In Optical Anomalous Hall Effect In Chiral Superconductors
Authors: Bin Geng, Yang Gao, Qian Niu
Abstract: The intrinsic mechanisms of the magneto-optical Kerr signal in chiral superconductors often involve multi-orbital degree of freedom. Here by considering a generic single-orbital and spinful Hamiltonian, we generalize the Onsager's relation to obtain the necessary conditions for the optical anomalous Hall effect. Using the down-folding method, we identify two types of effective momentum-space magnetism responsible for the optical anomalous Hall conductivity from non-unitary and unitary pairing potentials respectively. The former is due to the angular momentum of Cooper pair, while the latter requires the participation of the spin-orbit coupling in the normal state and has been largely overlooked previously. Using concrete examples, we show that the unitary pairing can lead to both ferromagnetism and complicated antiferromagnetic spin texture in the momentum space, resulting in an in-plane optical anomalous Hall effect with the magnetism parallel to the Hall-deflection plane. Our work reveals the essential role of spin degree of freedom in the optical anomalous Hall effect.

Title: Nanoscale imaging of reduced forward bias at V-pits in green-emitting nitride LEDs
Authors: C. Fornos, N. ALyabyeva, Y. W. Ho, J. Peretti, A. C. H. Rowe, J. S. Speck, C. Weisbuch
Abstract: Record wall-plug efficiencies in long-wavelength, nitride light-emitting diodes (LEDs) have recently been achieved in devices containing high V-pit densities. Numerical modeling suggests this may be due to improved electrical efficiencies (EE). In order to test this proposition, a novel scanning tunneling luminescence microscope (STLM) is used to map the local optoelectronic properties of commercial, green-emitting LED heterostructures around V-pits with nanoscale spatial resolution. Using the STLM tip as the hole injector, injection at the lips of V-pits is found to be drastically different from injection on the heterostructure's c-plane. A $\approx$ 3-fold improvement in internal quantum efficiency near V-pits is observed at low injection, and at higher injection a $\approx$1.75 V reduction in the forward bias unambiguously confirms the EE hypothesis for hole injection.

Title: Enhanced UV Photodetector Efficiency with a ZnO/Ga$_2$O$_3$ Heterojunction
Authors: Shashi Pandey, Swaroop Ganguly, Alok Shukla, Anurag Tripathi
Abstract: Heterostructures comprising uncoated ZnO and coated with thin layers of Ga$_2$O$_3$ were produced using spin-coating and subsequent hydrothermal processing. X-ray diffraction examination verifies the structural integrity of the synthesized heterostructures (HTs). Optical and photoluminescence spectra were recorded to assess the variation in absorption and emission of the Ga$_2$O$_3$-coated HTs in comparison to the pristine ZnO. We conducted comparative density-functional theory (DFT) computations to corroborate the measured band gaps of both categories of HTs. To assess the stability of our devices, the transient response to on/off light switching under zero bias has been studied. The rise time $\tau_{r1}$ ($\tau_{r2}$) is 2300 (500) ms and the decay time $\tau_{d1}$ ($\tau_{d2}$) is 2700 (5000) ms have been observed for bare ZnO and ZnO/Ga$_2$O$_3$ HTs, respectively. A significant amount of change was also observed in the electrical transport properties from bare ZnO to ZnO/Ga$_2$O$_3$. To see the performance of device, responsivity (R) and detectivity (D = 1/NEP$_B$) have been measured. It is evident from observation that responsivity of a device shows maximum value in UV region while it is reducing with visible region for HTs. In case of detectivity, the maximum value reached was $145 \times 10^{14}$ Hz$^{1/2}$/W (at ~ 200 nm) and $38 \times 10^{14}$ Hz$^{1/2}$/W (at 300 nm) for Ga$_2$O$_3$ coated ZnO, and bare ZnO HTs, respectively. The maximum responsivity measured for the bare ZnO HTs is 7 (A/W) while that of Ga$_2$O$_3$ coated ZnO HTs is 38 (A/W). It suggests a simple way of designing materials for fabricating broad-range cost-effective photodetectors.

Title: Four-body physics in low-dimensional bosons with three-body interaction
Authors: V. Polkanov, O. Hryhorchak, V. Pastukhov
Abstract: The two-channel model for bosons with the three-body interaction is proposed. Similar to the Hamiltonian describing narrow Feshbach resonance in the two-body sector, our model includes the finite-range effects of the three-body potential and is well-defined in the ultraviolet (UV). A detailed exploration of the Efimov-like effect in the fractal-dimension system of four bosons is carried out. Peculiarities of the four-body bound states and the low-energy atom-trimer scattering in one dimension are revealed.

Title: Superfluid stiffness bounds in time-reversal symmetric superconductors
Authors: Yongxin Zeng, Andrew J. Millis
Abstract: Quantum geometry has been shown to make an important contribution to the superfluid stiffness of superconductors, especially for flat-band systems such as moiré materials. In this work we use mean-field theory to derive an expression for the superfluid stiffness of time-reversal symmetric superconductors at zero temperature by computing the energy of the mean-field ground state as a function of pairing momentum. We show that the quantum geometric contribution to superfluid stiffness is a consequence of broken Galilean invariance in the interaction Hamiltonian, arising from momentum-dependent form factors related to the momentum dependence of Bloch states. The effects of broken Galilean invariance are not fully parametrized by the quantum metric considered in previous work. We obtain general lower and upper bounds that apply to both continuum and lattice models and present numerical calculations of the precise value in several important cases. The superfluid stiffness of superconductivity in a Landau level saturates the lower bound and the superfluid stiffness of the other cases we consider is close to the general lower bound we derive. In multilayer rhombohedral graphene the geometric contribution is shown not to be the dominant contribution to the superfluid stiffness, despite the flat band behavior in the vicinity of the Fermi level. Finally, assuming contact interaction and uniform pairing, we show that the superfluid stiffness is proportional to the ``minimal quantum metric" introduced in previous work. We provide a continuum version of the minimal quantum metric and explain its physical origin.

Title: Nitrogen Vacancies Induce Fatigue in Ferroelectric $\mathrm{Al_{0.93}B_{0.07}N}$
Authors: Walter J. Smith, Betul Akkopru-Akgun, Erdem Ozdemir, Bogdan Dryzhakov, John Hayden, Jon-Paul Maria, Kyle P. Kelley, Clive A. Randall, Susan Trolier-McKinstry, Thomas E. Beechem
Abstract: Wurtzite ferroelectrics (e.g., $\mathrm{Al_{0.93}B_{0.07}N}$) are being explored for high-temperature and emerging near-, or in-compute, memory architectures due to the material advantages offered by their large remanent polarization and robust chemical stability. Despite these advantages, current $\mathrm{Al_{0.93}B_{0.07}N}$ devices do not have sufficient endurance lifetime to meet roadmap targets. To identify the defects responsible for this limited endurance, a combination of electronic measurements and optical spectroscopies characterized the evolution of defect states within $\mathrm{Al_{0.93}B_{0.07}N}$ with cycling. Ultrathin ($\sim$10 nm) metal contacts were used to optically probe regions subject to ferroelectric switching; photoluminescence spectroscopy identified the emergence of a transition near 2.1 eV whose intensity scaled with the non-switching polarization quantified via positive-up negative-down (PUND) measurements. Accompanying thermally stimulated depolarization current (TSDC) and modulus spectroscopy measurements also observed the strengthening of a state near 2.1 eV. The origin of this feature is ascribed to transitions between a nitrogen vacancy and another defect deeper in the bandgap. Recognizing that the impurity concentration is largely fixed, strengthening of this transition indicates an increase in the number of nitrogen vacancies. Switching, therefore, creates vacancies in $\mathrm{Al_{0.93}B_{0.07}N}$ likely due to hot-atom damage induced by the aggressive fields necessary to switch wurtzite materials that ultimately limits endurance.

Title: An Extended Model of Fractional-Dimensional Space for Anisotropic Solids with Deformed Derivatives
Authors: José Weberszpil
Abstract: In this work, we extend a fractional-dimensional space model for anisotropic solids by incorporating a q-deformed derivative operator, inspired by Tsallis' nonadditive entropy framework. This generalization provides an analytical framework for exploring anisotropic thermal properties, within a unified and flexible mathematical formalism. We derive modified expressions for the phonon density of states and specific heat capacity, highlighting the impact of the deformation parameters on thermodynamic behavior. We apply the model to various solid-state materials, achieving excellent agreement with experimental data, across a wide temperature range and demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing anisotropic and subextensive effects in real systems.

Title: Thermal phase slips in superconducting films
Authors: Mikhail A. Skvortsov, Artem V. Polkin
Abstract: A dissipationless supercurrent state in superconductors can be destroyed by thermal fluctuations. Thermally activated phase slips provide a finite resistance of the sample and are responsible for dark counts in superconducting single photon detectors. The activation barrier for a phase slip is determined by a space-dependent saddle-point (instanton) configuration of the order parameter. In the one-dimensional wire geometry, such a saddle point has been analytically obtained by Langer and Ambegaokar in the vicinity of the critical temperature, $T_c$, and for arbitrary bias currents below the critical current $I_c$. In the two-dimensional geometry of a superconducting strip, which is relevant for photon detection, the situation is much more complicated. Depending on the ratio $I/I_c$, several types of saddle-point configurations have been proposed, with their energies being obtained numerically. We demonstrate that the saddle-point configuration for an infinite superconducting film at $I\to I_c$ is described by the exactly integrable Boussinesq equation solved by Hirota's method. The instanton size is $L_x\sim\xi(1-I/I_c)^{-1/4}$ along the current and $L_y\sim\xi(1-I/I_c)^{-1/2}$ perpendicular to the current, where $\xi$ is the Ginzburg-Landau coherence length. The activation energy for thermal phase slips scales as $\Delta F^\text{2D}\propto (1-I/I_c)^{3/4}$. For sufficiently wide strips of width $w\gg L_y$, a half-instanton is formed near the boundary, with the activation energy being 1/2 of $\Delta F^\text{2D}$.

Title: Beyond-quasiparticles transport with vertex correction: self-consistent ladder formalism for electron-phonon interactions
Authors: Jae-Mo Lihm, Samuel Poncé
Abstract: We present a self-consistent many-body framework for computing phonon-limited electronic transport from first principles, incorporating both beyond-quasiparticle effects and vertex corrections. Using the recently developed first-principles scGD0 method, we calculate spectral functions with nonperturbative effects such as broadening, satellites, and energy-dependent renormalization. We show that the scGD0 spectral functions outperform one-shot G0D0 and cumulant approximations in model Hamiltonians and real materials, eliminating unphysical spectral kinks and correctly predicting the phonon emission continuum. Building on this, we introduce the self-consistent ladder formalism for transport, which captures vertex corrections due to electron-phonon interactions. This approach unifies and improves upon the two state-of-the-art approaches for first-principles phonon-limited transport: the bubble approximation and the Boltzmann transport equation. Moreover, as a charge-conserving approximation, it enables consistent calculations of the optical conductivity and dielectric function. We validate the developed method against numerically exact results for model Hamiltonians and apply it to real materials. Our results show quantitative agreement with the experimental dc conductivities in intrinsic semiconductors Si and ZnO and the SrVO3 metal, as well as excellent agreement with the experimental THz optical and dielectric properties of Si and ZnO. This work unifies first-principles and many-body approaches for studying transport, opening new directions for applying many-body theory to materials with strong electron-phonon interactions.

Title: Hydroflux Crystal Growth of Alkali Tellurate Oxide-Hydroxides
Authors: Madalyn R. Gragg, Allana G. Iwanicki, Maxime A. Siegler, Tyrel M. McQueen
Abstract: This study investigates the synthesis of novel magnetic materials via hydroflux synthesis, a method that combines flux-based and hydrothermal techniques. Single crystals of three novel alkali tellurate oxide-hydroxides were synthesized. One, CsTeO$_3$(OH), is nonmagnetic and a new member of the series ATeO$_3$(OH) (A = alkali). The other two phases contain magnetic Cu-Te sublattices, one of which, KCu$_2$Te$_3$O$_{8}$(OH), is structurally three-dimensional and undergoes several magnetic ordering transitions; the other, Cs$_2$Cu$_3$Te$_2$O$_{10}$, is structurally two-dimensional and remains paramagnetic above T = 2K. These exploratory investigations of novel phase spaces reveal key factors including hydroxide concentration, precursor solubility, and oxidizing power of the solution which govern the formation and composition of alkali tellurate oxide-hydroxides.

Title: Anomalies in G and 2D Raman Modes of Twisted Bilayer Graphene Near the Magic Angle
Authors: Darshit Solanki, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, A. K. Sood, Anindya Das
Abstract: The role of twist angle ($\theta_t$) in tailoring the physical properties of heterostructures is emerging as a new paradigm in two-dimensional materials. The influence of flat electronic bands near the magic angle ($\sim$1.1$^{\circ}$) on the phononic properties of twisted bilayer graphene (t-BLG) is not well understood. In this work, we systematically investigate the G and 2D Raman modes of t-BLG samples with twist angles ranging from $\sim$0.3$^{\circ}$ to $\sim$3$^{\circ}$ using micro-Raman spectroscopy. A key finding of our work is the splitting of the G mode near the magic angle due to moiré potential induced phonon hybridization. The linewidth of the low-frequency component of the G mode (G$^-$), as well as the main component of the 2D mode, exhibits enhanced broadening near the magic angle due to increased electron-phonon coupling, driven by the emergence of flat electronic bands. Additionally, temperature-dependent Raman measurements (6-300 K) of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene sample ($\theta_t \sim$ 1$^{\circ}$) reveal an almost tenfold increase in phonon anharmonicity-induced temperature variation in both components of the split G mode, as compared to Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene sample, further emphasizing the role of phonon hybridization in this system. These studies could be important for understanding the thermal properties of the twisted bilayer graphene systems.

Title: Hyperfine electro-nuclear coupling at the quantum criticality of YbCu4Zn
Authors: S. Gabani, I. Curlik, F. Akbar, M. Giovannini, J.G. Sereni
Abstract: An increasing number of Yb-based compounds fulfill the conditions for the investigation of hyperfine electro-nuclear coupling effects related to 171-Yb and 173-Yb isotopes. Among them, the lack of magnetic order down to the milikelvin range in compounds with robust localized electronic moments and their nuclear magnetism. Although reminiscences of short range magnetic interactions may be observed below 1K, such perturbation can be dodged investigating compounds located close to a quantum critical point (QCP), where quantum fluctuations prevent the development of magnetic correlations to develop. Within the family of cubic YbCu4M compounds (M = Ni, Au and Zn), we have investigated YbCu4Zn that shows a logarithmic temperature dependence: C_P /T ~ ln(T/TQ) in its electronic specific heat, as predicted for a QCP. Simultaneously, no signs of RKKY interactions are detected down to 0.03K. Due to the low Kondo temperature of its doublet ground state, the localized 4f electrons weakly couple with conduction electrons, allowing the coupling between nuclear and 4f electron moments to become relevant. However, the reminder Kondo interaction acts on the electronic hyperfine field producing a small deviation from the standard nuclear C_N ~ 1/T^2 dependence into a n < 2 power law. The expected n = 2 dependence is progressively recovered under applied magnetic field.

Title: Corner Topology Makes Woven Baskets into Stiff, yet Resilient Metamaterials
Authors: Guowei Wayne Tu, Evgueni T. Filipov
Abstract: Basket weaving is a traditional craft used to create practical three-dimensional (3D) structures. While the geometry and aesthetics of baskets have received considerable attention, the underlying mechanics and modern engineering potential remain underexplored. This work shows that 3D woven structures offer similar stiffness yet substantially higher resilience than their non-woven continuous counterparts. We explore corner topologies that serve as building blocks to convert 2D woven sheets into 3D metamaterials that can carry compressive loads. Under small deformations, the woven corners exhibit axial stiffness similar to continuous structures because the woven ribbons are engaged with in-plane loads. Under large deformations, the woven corners can be compressed repeatedly without plastic damage because ribbons can undergo elastic local buckling. We present a modular platform to assemble woven corners into complex spatial metamaterials and demonstrate applications including damage-resilient robotic systems and metasurfaces with tailorable deformation modes. Our results explain the historic appeal of basket weaving, where readily available ribbons are crafted into 3D structures with comparable stiffness yet far superior resilience to continuous systems. The modular assembly of woven metamaterials can further revolutionize design of next-generation automotive components, consumer devices, soft robots, and more where both resilience and stiffness are essential.

Title: Ultrafast scintillating metal-organic frameworks films
Authors: Lorena Dhamo, Jacopo Perego, Irene Villa, Charl X. Bezuidenhout, Ilaria Mattei, Alessia Landella, Silvia Bracco, Angiolina Comotti, Angelo Monguzzi
Abstract: Compositionally engineered metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been designed and used to fabricate ultrafast scintillating films with emission in both the UV and visible regions. The inclusion of hafnium (Hf) ions in the nodes of the MOF increases the interaction cross-section with ionizing radiation, partially compensating for the low density of the porous material and dramatically increasing the system scintillation yield. The high diffusivity of bimolecular excitons within the framed conjugated ligands allows bimolecular annihilation processes between excited states that partially quench the MOF luminescence, resulting in ultrafast scintillation pulses under X-ray excitation with kinetics in the hundreds of picoseconds time scale. Despite the quenching, the gain in scintillation yield achieved by incorporating Hf ions is large enough to maintain the light yield of the films above 104 ph/MeV under soft X-rays. These unprecedented high efficiencies and simultaneous ultrafast emission kinetics obtained at room temperature in a technologically attractive solid-state configuration, together with the versatility of its composition allowing for further application-specific modifications, place the MOF platform in a prominent position for the realization of the next generation of ultrafast scintillation counters for high-energy physics studies and medical imaging applications.

Title: Towards a hybrid 3D transmon qubit with topological insulator-based Josephson junctions
Authors: Sheng-Wen Huang, Ramya Suresh, Jian Liao, Botao Du, Zachary Miles, Leonid P. Rokhinson, Yong P. Chen, Ruichao Ma
Abstract: Superconducting quantum circuits provide a versatile platform for studying quantum materials by leveraging precise microwave control and utilizing the tools of circuit quantum electrodynamics (QED). Hybrid circuit devices incorporating novel quantum materials could also lead to new qubit functionalities, such as gate tunability and noise resilience. Here, we report experimental progress towards a transmon-like qubit made with a superconductor-topological insulator-superconductor (S-TI-S) Josephson junction using exfoliated BiSbTeSe2. We present a design that enables us to systematically characterize the hybrid device, from DC transport of the S-TI-S junction, to RF spectroscopy, to full circuit QED control and measurement of the hybrid qubit. In addition, we utilize a high-quality-factor superconducting cavity to characterize material and fabrication-induced losses, thereby guiding our efforts to improve device quality.

Title: Transport properties of the pseudospin-3/2 Dirac-Weyl fermions in the double-barrier-modulated two-dimensional system
Authors: Rui Zhu
Abstract: In this work, we analytically solved the pseudospin-3/2 Dirac equation and investigated the electronic transport properties in the double-barrier modulated two-dimensional system. The probability current density operator is explicitly derived from the time-dependent pseudospin-3/2 Dirac equation, which paves way for investigation of the electronic transport properties of general pseudospin-$s$ Dirac-Weyl systems with $s$ an integer or half integer larger than 1. As a result of the double-cone band structure, the pseudospin-3/2 system has two incident channels for a single incident energy and incident angle pair. Similar to its counterparts of pseudospin-1/2 and pseudospin-1 Dirac-Weyl systems, the Klein tunneling and resonant tunneling effects in the transmission probability are numerically observed for incidence coming from both Dirac cones in the double-barrier-modulated pseudospin-3/2 system. In contrast to its pseudospin-1/2 and -1 counterparts, the Klein tunneling and resonant tunneling effects are differentiated into double-channel and single-channel incidences, corresponding to different regimes in the $E$-$k_y$ dispersion plane. Without a flat band, the super Klein tunneling effect of the pseudospin-1 Dirac-Weyl system does not occur in the pseudospin-3/2 system. Using the numerically obtained probability current density, the zero-temperature conductivity, shot noise, and Fano factor are calculated. As a combined result of double-channel incidence, Klein tunneling, and resonant tunneling, in comparison with its pseudospin-1/2 (graphene) and pseudospin-1 counterparts, the conductivity and shot noise in the pseudospin-3/2 double-barrier structure is enhanced. A Fano factor between 0.4 and 0.5 close to the Dirac point ${E_F}={V_0}$ is observed.

Title: Boltzmann-Ginzburg-Landau theory for autochemotaxis of active rod-like particles
Authors: Shun Sakurai, Nariya Uchida
Abstract: We investigate the interplay between chemotaxis and alignment interactions in active rod-like particles, such as E. coli and Janus rods. Starting from a discrete model of self-propelled rods with chemotactic responses, we employ a Boltzmann-Ginzburg-Landau (BGL) approach to derive coarse-grained dynamical equations for the density, polar and nematic orientational order parameters, and the concentration field of the chemoattractant. We perform a linear stability analysis for fluctuations around uniform steady states corresponding to isotropic and nematic phases. In both phases, we find that translational chemotactic response promotes instability, while rotational chemotactic response suppresses it, elucidating their contrasting effects on the onset of collective dynamics.

Title: Residual gauge theory for quanta of surface plasmons
Authors: Ken-ichi Sasaki
Abstract: We develop a gauge-theoretical framework to investigate the quanta of surface plasmons. Our formulation, based on quantum electrodynamics, highlights the importance of residual gauge symmetry. We emphasize that residual gauge symmetry, which imposes constraint equations on physical states, is fundamentally linked to Joule heating. This framework is applied to metals, semiconductors, and quantum Hall states, suggesting the presence of a latent transverse electric mode and that the quanta have the ability to maintain light-matter entanglement.

Title: Doping-induced Polyamorphic Transitions in Fluorite Oxides
Authors: Hao Yang, Qiaotong Luan, Qing Zhang, Yuhao Yue, Yawen Xu, Xiaohui Liu, Zheng Wen, Zhaoru Sun
Abstract: Fluorite oxides such as HfO$_2$ exhibit rich and tunable phase behavior, making them promising candidates for next generation electronic devices. A key challenge is to design amorphous HfO$_2$-based high-$k$ materials with both structural and performance stability. Here, using molecular dynamics simulations supported by experimental measurements, we reveal that Ba doping stimulates a polyamorphic transition in HfO$_2$, yielding a semi-ordered amorphous (SA) phase characterized by disordered oxygens embedded within an ordered metal sublattice. We find that this phase arises from degenerate short-range symmetry breaking modes, consistent with Pauling's parsimony rule. Notably, the SA structure is thermodynamically stable and displays a wider bandgap and higher dielectric constant than conventional random-packing amorphous structure, owing to suppressed subgap states and increased Born effective charges. We further demonstrate that this structural motif generalizes to Ba-, Sr-, and Ca-doped HfO$_2$ and ZrO$_2$, establishing a broadly applicable strategy for designing high-performance amorphous dielectrics.

Title: Wide-field Hyperspectral Optical Microscopy for Rapid Characterization of Two-Dimensional Semiconductors and Heterostructures
Authors: Zhenghan Peng, Adeyemi Uthman, Zhepeng Zhang, Anh Tuan Hoang, Xiang Zhu, Eric Pop, Andrew J. Mannix
Abstract: Electronic and optoelectronic applications of two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors demand precise control over material quality, including thickness, composition, doping, and defect density. Conventional benchmarking methods (e.g., charge transport, confocal mapping, electron or scanning probe microscopy) are slow, perturb sample quality, or involve trade-offs between speed, resolution, and scan area. To accelerate assessment of 2D semiconductors, we demonstrate a broadband, wide-field hyperspectral optical microscope for 2D materials (2D-HOM) that rapidly captures a spatial-spectral data cube within seconds. The data cube includes x-y spatial coordinate (a 300 * 300 $\mu\mathrm{m}^2$ field, with ~ 1 $\mu\mathrm{m}$ resolution) and a selectable wavelength range between 1100 to 200 nm at each pixel. Using synthesized films and heterostructures of transition metal dichalcogenides ($\mathrm{MoS}_{2}$, $\mathrm{WS}_{2}$, $\mathrm{V}_{x}\mathrm{W}_{1-x}\mathrm{S}_{2}$, and $\mathrm{WSe}_{2}$), we show that this cost-effective technique detects spectral fingerprints of material identity, doping, grain boundaries, and alloy composition, and enables advanced analysis, including unsupervised machine learning for spatial segmentation.

Title: Optical Excitations of Flat Bands Induced by Exciton Condensation in Ta$_2$Pd$_3$Te$_{5}$
Authors: Shaohui Yi, Zhiyu Liao, Chenhao Liang, Sheng Zhang, Xiutong Deng, Yongjie Xie, Lincong Zheng, Yujie Wang, Yubiao Wu, Zhijun Wang, Youguo Shi, Xianggang Qiu, Bing Xu
Abstract: We report on the charge dynamics of Ta$_2$Pd$_3$Te$_5$ using temperature-dependent optical spectroscopy with polarized light. We observe a metal-insulator transition characterized by the collapse of Drude response and the emergence of sharp and narrow absorption peaks at low temperatures. Unlike previous excitonic insulator candidates such as TiSe$_2$ and Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$, where the excitonic order is intertwined with charge density wave or structural instabilities, the sharp features in Ta$_2$Pd$_3$Te$_5$ point to intrinsic excitonic excitations associated with ultra-flat bands driven by many-body renormalization of the band structure via spontaneous exciton condensation. Our findings thus provide clear-cut optical evidence for exciton condensation in a bulk crystal and establish Ta$_2$Pd$_3$Te$_5$ as a promising platform for exploring correlated quantum phases and novel excitonic phenomena.

Title: First-principles prediction of altermagnetism in transition metal graphite intercalation compounds
Authors: Weida Fu, Guo-Dong Zhao, Tao Hu, Wencai Yi, Hui Zhang, Alessandro Stroppa, Wei Ren, Zhongming Ren
Abstract: We report the emergence of altermagnetism, a magnetic phase characterized by the coexistence of compensated spin ordering and momentum-dependent spin splitting, in graphite intercalation compounds (GICs), a prototypical material system long investigated for its tunable electronic and structural properties. Through first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that vanadium-intercalated stage-1 graphite compounds, exhibit inherent altermagnetic properties. The hexagonal crystal system and antiferromagnetic ordering of V atoms generate a magnetic space group that enforces alternating spin polarization in momentum space while maintaining zero net magnetization. The calculated band structure reveals robust altermagnetic signatures: along the high-symmetry direction, we observe a pronounced spin splitting of ~270 meV with alternating spin polarization. Crucially, the spin splitting exhibits minimal sensitivity to spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effect, highlighting the dominance of exchange interactions over relativistic effects. From Monte Carlo simulations, we predict a magnetic transition temperature ($T_m$ ) of ~228 K, indicating stable magnetic ordering above liquid nitrogen temperatures. The combination of symmetry-protected spin textures, SOC-independent splitting, and elevated $T_m$ temperature makes V-GICs as a promising candidate for spintronic applications, particularly for zero-field spin-polarized current generation and topologically robust spin transport. As the first demonstration of carbon-based alternating magnetic systems, this work offers a design paradigm for engineering spin-polarized quantum states governed by crystalline symmetry constraints.

Title: In situ 2D visualization of hydrogen entry into Zn-coated steels in NaCl solutions: Roles of Zn dissolution and potential distribution
Authors: Hiroshi Kakinuma, Saya Ajito, Koki Okumura, Makoto Akahoshi, Yu Takabatake, Tomohiko Omura, Motomichi Koyama, Eiji Akiyama
Abstract: The hydrogen entry behavior of a partially Zn-coated steel sheet in NaCl solutions was investigated employing a polyaniline-based hydrogenochromic sensor, electrochemical hydrogen permeation tests, and potential measurements using a scanning Kelvin probe. While the Zn coating mitigated corrosion of the steel substrate, it simultaneously accelerated the hydrogen entry. The hydrogen entry occurred at the bare steel surface regions exposed to the NaCl solution, with the hydrogen flux exhibiting non-uniform distribution: higher near the dissolving Zn coating. While no significant differences in Zn dissolution behavior or galvanic current were observed between 0.1 and 0.01 M NaCl solutions, the total hydrogen flux decreased with decreasing Cl ion concentration. This reduction was attributed to a potential gradient induced by differences in electrolyte conductivity. The results demonstrate that potential distribution, rather than galvanic current, is a dominant factor influencing hydrogen entry under the investigated conditions.

Title: Probing d-wave superconducting gap of high-$T_\mathrm{c}$ cuprate $\mathrm{Bi}_2\mathrm{Sr}_2\mathrm{Ca}_2\mathrm{Cu}_3\mathrm{O}_{10+δ}$ by resonant inelastic X-ray scattering
Authors: Kunhao Li, Qizhi Li, Changwei Zou, Jaewon Choi, Chaohui Yin, Mirian Garcia-Fernandez, Stefano Agrestini, Shilong Zhang, Chengtian Lin, Xingjiang Zhou, Ke-Jin Zhou, Yi Lu, Yingying Peng
Abstract: The superconducting gap is a characteristic feature of high-T$_c$ superconductors and provides crucial information on the pairing mechanism underlying high-temperature superconductivity. Here, we employ high-resolution resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) at the Cu $L_3$-edge to investigate the superconducting gap in the overdoped cuprate $\mathrm{Bi}_2\mathrm{Sr}_2\mathrm{Ca}_2\mathrm{Cu}_3\mathrm{O}_{10+\delta}$ ($T_\mathrm{c}$ = 107 K). By analyzing antisymmetrized, temperature-dependent RIXS spectra over a range of in-plane momentum transfers, we observe a clear suppression of low-energy spectral weight below T$_c$, indicative of superconducting gap formation. This suppression is most pronounced at small momentum transfers ($|\boldsymbol{q}_\parallel| \leq 0.18$ r.l.u.) and corresponds to a gap size of approximately 2$\Delta_0 \sim$ 130 meV. Comparison with theoretical calculations of the momentum-dependent charge susceptibility supports a d-wave symmetry of the superconducting gap, while an isotropic s-wave gap fails to reproduce key experimental features. These findings establish RIXS as a powerful, bulk-sensitive probe of superconducting gap symmetry and highlight its utility for studying materials beyond the reach of surface-sensitive techniques such as ARPES and STM.

Title: High-throughput development of flexible amorphous materials showing large anomalous Nernst effect via automatic annealing and thermoelectric imaging
Authors: Sang J. Park, Ravi Gautam, Abdulkareem Alasli, Takamasa Hirai, Fuyuki Ando, Hosei Nagano, Hossein Sepehri-Amin, Ken-ichi Uchida
Abstract: This work demonstrates high-throughput screening of flexible magnetic materials for efficient transverse thermoelectric conversion based on the anomalous Nernst effect (ANE). The approach integrates automated annealing and contactless measurement of transport properties using lock-in thermography. We screen 151 Fe-based alloy ribbons with varying compositions and annealing conditions. Seven high-performance candidates with mechanical flexibility are identified, exhibiting anomalous Nernst coefficients of up to 4.8 uV/K, the highest value reported for flexible materials. Structural analysis reveals that ANE enhancement occurs universally near the first crystallization temperature of the Fe-based ribbons, without strong correlation with composition. Notably, the enhancement is also observed in samples without Cu or Fe nanoclusters, indicating that short-range atomic order in the amorphous matrix may play a role in ANE. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of high-throughput methodologies for discovering advanced ANE materials and provide new insights into thermoelectric conversion in disordered systems where conventional design principles fall short.

Title: SeWS/bilayer-SiC heterojunction: An S-scheme photocatalyst with high visible-light absorption, excellent carrier mobility and adjustable band gap
Authors: Liuzhu Yang, Wenhui Wan, Yanfeng Ge, Qiuyue Ma, Zhicui Wang, Yong Liu
Abstract: Vertically stacked heterojunctions have garnered significant attention for their tunable electronic structures and photocatalytic performance, making them promising candidates for next-generation nanodevices. Using first-principles calculations, we systematically investigate the electronic structure, optical characteristics, and charge transfer of WSSe/SiC heterojunctions. Our results reveal that SeWS/monolayer-SiC, SeWS/bilayer-SiC, and SWSe/monolayer-SiC exhibit type-II band alignment, whereas SWSe/bilayer-SiC displays type-I alignment. Notably, SeWS/bilayer-SiC possesses a direct bandgap, in contrast to the indirect bandgaps of the other three configurations. Remarkably, the SeWS/bilayer-SiC heterojunction demonstrates a high absorption coefficient ($10^{5}~\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$) in the visible range and exhibits exceptional anisotropy in carrier transport, with an outstanding hole mobility of $9.58 \times 10^{3}~\mathrm{cm}^{2}\,\mathrm{V}^{-1}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ along the Y-direction. Furthermore, combining thermodynamic stability with an S-scheme charge transfer mechanism, this system exhibits superior redox capability for photocatalytic water splitting, achieving a high hydrogen evolution efficiency of 22.15%, which surpasses the commercial viability threshold (10\%). Furthermore, we demonstrate effective band gap modulation via external electric fields and biaxial strains, with optical absorption coefficients exhibiting strong strain dependence. This work provides fundamental insights into the design of WSSe/SiC heterojunctions for high-efficiency photocatalytic and tunable photodetector applications.

Title: Interaction-Driven Topological Transitions in Monolayer TaIrTe4
Authors: Jiangxu Li, Jian Tang, Louis Primeau, Thomas Siyuan Ding, Rahul Soni, Tiema Qian, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Ni Ni, Adrian Del Maestro, Qiong Ma, Yang Zhang
Abstract: Discovering materials that combine topological phenomena with correlated electron behavior is a central pursuit in quantum materials research. Monolayer TaIrTe$_4$ has recently emerged as a promising platform in this context, hosting robust quantum spin Hall insulator (QSHI) phases both within a single-particle gap and within a correlation-induced gap arising from van Hove singularities (vHSs), accessed via electrostatic doping. Its intrinsic monolayer nature offers exceptional tunability and the potential to realize a versatile array of interaction-driven topological phases. In this work, we combine theory and experiment to map the phase landscape of monolayer TaIrTe$_4$. Using Hartree-Fock calculations, we investigate the interaction-driven phase diagram near the vHSs under commensurate filling conditions. By systematically tuning the dielectric screening and strain, we uncover a rich set of ground states--including QSHI, trivial insulator, higher-order topological insulator, and metallic phase--among which are interaction-driven topological phase transitions. Experimentally, we perform both local and nonlocal transport measurements across a broad set of devices, which--due to unavoidable strain variations during fabrication-realize several phases consistent with theoretical predictions. Together, our results lay the groundwork for understanding correlation-driven topological phenomena in TaIrTe$_4$ and open new directions for engineering exotic quantum phases in low-dimensional materials beyond the limitations of moiré superlattices.

Title: Determining the grain orientations of battery materials from electron diffraction patterns using convolutional neural networks

Abstract: Polycrystalline materials have numerous applications due to their unique properties, which are often determined by the grain boundaries. Hence, quantitative characterization of grain as well as interface orientation is essential to optimize these materials, particularly energy materials. Using scanning transmission electron microscopy, matter can be analysed in an extremely fine grid of scan points via electron diffraction patterns at each scan point. By matching the diffraction patterns to a simulated database, the crystal orientation of the material as well as the orientation of the grain boundaries at each scan point can be determined. This pattern matching approach is highly time intensive. Artificial intelligence promises to be a very powerful tool for pattern recognition. In this work, we train convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on dynamically simulated diffraction patterns of LiNiO2, an important cathode-active material for Lithium-ion batteries, to predict the orientation of grains in terms of three Euler angles for the complete fundamental orientation region. Results demonstrate that these networks outperform the conventional pattern matching algorithm with increased accuracy and efficiency. The increased accuracy of the CNN models can be attributed to the fact that these models are trained by data incorporating dynamical effects. This work is the first attempt to apply deep learning for analysis of electron diffraction data and enlightens the great potential of ML to accelerate the analysis of electron microscopy data, toward high-throughput characterization technique.

Title: Comment on "Storage properties of a quantum perceptron"
Authors: Mauro Pastore
Abstract: The recent paper "Storage properties of a quantum perceptron" [Phys. Rev. E 110, 024127] considers a quadratic constraint satisfaction problem, motivated by a quantum version of the perceptron. In particular, it derives its critical capacity, the density of constraints at which there is a satisfiability transition. The same problem was considered before in another context (classification of geometrically structured inputs, see [Phys. Rev. Lett. 125, 120601; Phys. Rev. E 102, 032119; J. Stat. Mech. (2021) 113301]), but the results on the critical capacity drastically differ. In this note, I substantiate the claim that the derivation performed in the quantum scenario has issues when inspected closely, I report a more principled way to perform it and I evaluate the critical capacity of an alternative constraint satisfaction problem that I consider more relevant for the quantum perceptron rule proposed by the article in question.

Title: Probing universal phase diagram of dimensional crossover with an atomic quantum simulator
Authors: Jinyuan Tian, Zhongcheng Yu, Jing Liu, Chi-Kin Lai, Lorenzo Pizzino, Chengyang Wu, Hongmian Shui, Thierry Giamarchi, Hepeng Yao, Xiaoji Zhou
Abstract: Dimensionality is a fundamental concept in physics, which plays a hidden but crucial role in various domains, including condensed matter physics, relativity and string theory, statistical physics, etc. In quantum physics, reducing dimensionality usually enhances fluctuations and leads to novel properties. Owing to these effects, quantum simulators in which dimensionality can be controlled have emerged as a new area of interest. However, such a platform has only been studied in specific regimes and a universal phase diagram is lacking. Here, we produce an interacting atomic quantum simulator with continuous tunability of anisotropy and temperature, and probe the universal phase diagram of dimensional crossover. At low temperatures, we identify the regimes from quantum three to zero dimensions. By increasing temperature, we observe the non-trivial emergence of a thermal regime situated between the quantum zero and integer dimensions. We show that the quantum-to thermal transition falls into four different universality classes depending on the dimensionality. Surprisingly, we also detect a fifth type where the high-dimensional quantum system can reach the thermal phase by crossing a low-dimensional quantum regime. Our results provide a crucial foundation for understanding the projective condensed matter structures in unconventional dimensions.

Title: Atomistic simulations of irradiation damage on the engineering timescale: Examining the dose rate effect in tungsten
Authors: Max Boleininger, Daniel R. Mason, Thomas Schwarz-Selinger, Pui-Wai Ma
Abstract: The change in materials properties subjected to irradiation by highly energetic particles strongly depends on the irradiation dose rate. Atomistic simulations can in principle be used to predict microstructural evolution where experimental data is sparse or unavailable, however, fundamental limitations of the method make it infeasible to replicate the experimental timescale spanning from seconds to hours. Here, we present an atomistic simulation method where the motion of vacancies is accelerated, while the fast degrees of freedom are propagated with standard molecular dynamics. The resulting method is free of adjustable parameters and can predict microstructural evolution under irradiation at elevated temperatures. Simulating the microstructural evolution of tungsten under irradiation at dose rates of $10^{-5}$, $10^{-4}$, and $10^{-3}$ dpa/second, we find that increasing the temperature or reducing the dose rate primarily results in a reduction of the steady-state defect concentration, in qualitative agreement with deuterium retention and post-irradiation resistivity recovery experiments. The formation of a nanoscale void is observed if a system initially containing a large dislocation loop is irradiated. We present a minimally simple rate theory model which reproduces the time-dependent defect concentration and volume swelling behaviour obtained from the simulations.

Title: Leveraging neural network interatomic potentials for a foundation model of chemistry
Authors: So Yeon Kim, Yang Jeong Park, Ju Li
Abstract: Large-scale foundation models, including neural network interatomic potentials (NIPs) in computational materials science, have demonstrated significant potential. However, despite their success in accelerating atomistic simulations, NIPs face challenges in directly predicting electronic properties and often require coupling to higher-scale models or extensive simulations for macroscopic properties. Machine learning (ML) offers alternatives for structure-to-property mapping but faces trade-offs: feature-based methods often lack generalizability, while deep neural networks require significant data and computational power. To address these trade-offs, we introduce HackNIP, a two-stage pipeline that leverages pretrained NIPs. This method first extracts fixed-length feature vectors (embeddings) from NIP foundation models and then uses these embeddings to train shallow ML models for downstream structure-to-property predictions. This study investigates whether such a hybridization approach, by ``hacking" the NIP, can outperform end-to-end deep neural networks, determines the dataset size at which this transfer learning approach surpasses direct fine-tuning of the NIP, and identifies which NIP embedding depths yield the most informative features. HackNIP is benchmarked on Matbench, evaluated for data efficiency, and tested on diverse tasks including \textit{ab initio}, experimental, and molecular properties. We also analyze how embedding depth impacts performance. This work demonstrates a hybridization strategy to overcome ML trade-offs in materials science, aiming to democratize high-performance predictive modeling.

Title: Electromagnetic Proximity Effect: Superconducting Magnonics and Beyond
Authors: Tao Yu, Xi-Han Zhou, Gerrit E. W. Bauer, Irina Bobkova
Abstract: The exchange interaction at interfaces between superconductors (SCs) and ferromagnets (FMs) has been a central topic in condensed matter physics for many decades, starting with the prediction of exotic phases such as the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov states and leading to the discovery of triplet superconductivity. This review focuses on new phenomena in SC$|$FM heterostructures caused by the \textit{non-contact dipolar interaction} between magnons, i.e., the quanta of spin wave excitations in the ferromagnet, and the superconducting order. A universal non-relativistic spin-orbit coupling locks the polarization and momentum of their evanescent stray magnetic fields and leads to chiral screening by proximate superconductors. The interaction-induced hybrid quasiparticles are magnon-Meissner collective modes, magnon-cooparon, Josephson plasmonic modes, and nodal magnon-photon polaritons. Superconducting and normal metallic gates modulate and control the magnetodipolar interaction and thereby magnetization and energy transport at interfaces and in thin films.

Title: Angular-momentum-selective nanofocusing with Weyl semimetals
Authors: Marco Peluso, Alessandro De Martino, Reinhold Egger, Francesco Buccheri
Abstract: We investigate the theory of surface plasmon polaritons on a magnetic Weyl semimetal conical tip. We show that the axion term in the effective electrodynamics modifies the surface plasmon polariton dispersion relation and allows all modes with a given sign of the orbital angular momentum to be focused at the end of the tip. This is in contrast with normal metals, in which only one mode can reach the end. We discuss how this orbital angular momentum nanofocusing expands the potential of technologies that use this degree of freedom.

Title: Bimodal distribution of delay times and splitting of the zero-bias conductance peak in a double-barrier normal-superconductor junction
Authors: C.W.J. Beenakker, V.A. Zakharov
Abstract: We formulate a scattering theory of the proximity effect in a weakly disordered SININ junction (S = superconductor, I = insulating barrier, N = normal metal). This allows to relate the conductance and density of states of the junction to the scattering times $\tau$ (eigenvalues of the Wigner-Smith time-delay matrix). The probability density $P(\tau)$ has two peaks, at a short time $\tau_{\rm min}$ and a late time $\tau_{\rm max}$. The density of states at the Fermi level is the geometric mean of the two times. The splitting of the zero-bias conductance peak is given by $\hbar/\tau_{\rm max}$.

Title: Intercalation-Altermagnet-Driven Ferrimagnetic-Ferroelastic Multiferroics and Anomalous and Spin Transport
Authors: Long Zhang, Yuxin Liu, Junfeng Ren, Guangqian Ding, Xiaotian Wang, Guangxin Ni, Guoying Gao, Zhenxiang Cheng
Abstract: Spin splitting in emerging altermagnets is non-relativistic and momentum-dependent, yet energy-independent and localized, posing challenges for practical applications. Here, we propose a paradigm of intercalation-driven altermagnets to attain ameliorative electronic structures, multiferroic characteristics, and anomalous and spin transport functionalities. As a representative system, we investigate electrochemistry- and self-intercalated V2Se2O bilayers, building on the recently reported room-temperature K- and Rb-intercalated V2Se2O family, utilizing density functional theory, Wannier function analyses, Monte Carlo simulations, and non-equilibrium Green function methods. Intercalation induces room-temperature intralayer ferrimagnetic and interlayer ferromagnetic couplings (358 K for Li-intercalation and 773 K for V-intercalation), ferroelasticity (~1 % signal intensity), in-plane uniaxial magnetic anisotropy and metallization, while modifying the anomalous Hall effect. Notably, Li- and V-intercalated V2Se2O bilayers exhibit enhanced spin splitting and half-metallic behavior, respectively, yielding near-perfect spin filtering efficiencies. Intercalation substantially boosts spin transport in V2Se2O-based devices, enabling giant magnetoresistance (877 %), ultra-high thermal tunneling magnetoresistance (~12000 %), and observable spin Seebeck and temperature negative differential resistance effects. Such intercalation-altermagnet-driven paradigm pioneers the expansion of altermagnetic functionalities through multifunctional integration, offering promising avenues for advanced, miniaturized, room-temperature utilization of anomalous, electron, and spin transport.

Persson, Kedar Hippalgaonkar
Abstract: Data-driven methodologies hold the promise of revolutionizing inorganic materials discovery, but they often face challenges due to discrepancies between theoretical predictions and experimental validation. In this work, we present an end-to-end discovery framework that leverages synthesizability, oxidation state probability, and reaction pathway calculations to guide the exploration of transition metal oxide spaces. Two previously unsynthesized target compositions, ZnVO3 and YMoO3, passed preliminary computational evaluation and were considered for ultrafast synthesis. Comprehensive structural and compositional analysis confirmed the successful synthesis ZnVO3 in a partially disordered spinel structure, validated via Density Functional Theory (DFT). Exploration of YMoO3 led to YMoO3-x with elemental composition close to 1:1:3; the structure was subsequently identified to be Y4Mo4O11 through micro-electron diffraction (microED) analysis. Our framework effectively integrates multi-aspect physics-based filtration with in-depth characterization, demonstrating the feasibility of designing, testing, synthesizing, and analyzing (DTMA) novel material candidates, marking a significant advancement towards inorganic materials by design.

Title: Spin waves involved in three-magnon splitting in synthetic antiferromagnets
Authors: Asma Mouhoub, Nathalie Bardou, Jean-Paul Adam, Aurélie Solignac, Thibaut Devolder
Abstract: An important nonlinear effect in magnonics is the 3-magnon splitting where a high frequency magnon splits into two magnons of lower frequencies. Here, we study the 3-magnon splitting in spin wave conduits made from synthetic antiferromagnets. By combining inductive excitation, inductive detection, Brillouin Light Scattering imaging of the spin waves and analytical modeling based on conservation laws, we elucidate the nature of the spin waves involved in this process. We show in particular that low order optical spin waves propagating along the conduit can split in doublets of non-degenerate acoustic spin waves that have a standing wave character in the confined direction and unsymmetrical wavevectors in the direction of the spin wave conduit. Generally, several splitting channels run in parallel. The rules governing the three-magnon splitting and its interplay with the mode confinement have consequences for the applications in non-linear microwave signal processing based on spin waves.

Title: Two dimensional Coulomb gas in a non-conservative trap
Authors: David S. Dean, Rashed Aljasmi, Satya N. Majumdar
Abstract: We study the nonequilibrium steady state of a two dimensional Coulomb gas under the action of an anisotropic harmonic trapping potential along with a non-conservative rotational force. In the case without rotation, the equilibrium (zero temperature) steady state has a uniform density supported over a a static elliptical droplet. The addition of a rotational force drives the system into a nonequilibrium steady state where the density is still uniform inside an ellipse, but the ellipse gets tilted by a a fixed angle compared to the non-rotational case. In addition, a nonzero current is generated inside the droplet which run concentrically to the droplet boundary. For large rotational force, the droplet develops a purely circular form. Our results are predicted by a simple hydrodynamic calculation and are confirmed by numerical simulations and provide a full understanding of a novel driven non-equilibrium state in a strongly interacting system.

Title: Stability of universal properties against perturbations of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm
Authors: Matteo Bacci, Claudio Bonati
Abstract: We numerically investigate the stability of universal properties at continuous phase transitions against perturbations of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm used to simulate the system. We consider the three dimensional XY model as test bed, and both local (single site Metropolis) and global (single cluster) updates, introducing deterministic truncation-like perturbations and stochastic perturbations in the acceptance probabilities. In (almost) all the cases we find a remarkable stability of the universal properties, even against large perturbations of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm, with critical exponents and scaling curves consistent with those of the standard XY model within statistical uncertainties.

Title: Giant orbital magnetization in two-dimensional materials
Authors: Martin Ovesen, Thomas Olsen
Abstract: Orbital magnetization typically plays a minor role in compounds where the magnetic properties are governed by transition metal elements. However, in some cases, the orbital magnetization may be fully unquenched, which can have dramatic consequences for magnetic anisotropy and various magnetic response properties. In the present work, we start by summarizing how unquenched orbital moments arise from particular combinations of crystal field splitting and orbital filling. We exemplify this for the cases of two-dimensional (2D) VI$_3$ and FePS$_3$, and show that Hubbard corrections as well as self-consistent spin-orbit coupling are crucial ingredients for predicting correct orbital moments from first principles calculations. We then search the Computational 2D Materials Database (C2DB) for monolayers having tetrahedral or octahedral crystal field splitting of transition metal $d$-states and orbital occupancy that is expected to lead to large orbital moments. We identify 112 monolayers with octahedral crystal field splitting and 62 monolayers with tetrahedral crystal field splitting and for materials with partially filled $t_{2g}$ bands, we verify that inclusion of Hubbard corrections as well as self-consistent spin-orbit coupling typically increases the magnitude of predicted orbital moments by an order of magnitude.

Title: Detecting Collective Excitations in Self-Gravitating Bose-Einstein Condensates via Faraday Waves
Authors: Ning Liu, Guodong Cheng
Abstract: We propose Faraday waves as a probe for collective excitations in self-gravitating Bose-Einstein condensates (SGBECs), driven by periodic modulation of the $s$-wave scattering length. Linear stability analysis of the driven Gross-Pitaevskii-Newton equations reveals that parametric instability follows a Mathieu-like equation, with Faraday waves emerging resonantly when half the driving frequency matches the collective excitation frequency of the SGBEC. This framework yields a stability phase diagram demonstrating the coexistence and interplay between the intrinsic Jeans instability of self-gravitating systems and the unstable tongues of parametric resonance. The phase diagram shows that reducing the driving frequency fragments and narrows parametric resonance structures while expanding the Jeans-dominated regime. We further identify a thermal-gravity competition in the Faraday wavevector, manifested as a sharp transition when thermal energy balances mean-field interaction at low driving frequencies. We numerically simulate Faraday wave formation and dynamics within the SGBEC, including the effects of dissipation; simulations reveal that Faraday wave patterns exhibit high sensitivity to Jeans frequency, transitioning from parametric resonance to Jeans collapse as gravitational strength increases.

Title: Influence of Interlayer Stacking on Optical Behavior in WSe$_{2}$/MoS$_{2}$ van der Waals Heterostructures
Authors: Widad Louafi, Karim Rezouali, Daniele Varsano, Maurizia Palummo, Maurits W. Haverkort, Samir Lounis
Abstract: We investigate the impact of crystal alignment on excitonic behavior in WSe$_{2}$/MoS$_{2}$ van der Waals heterostructures by comparing eclipsed (AA) and staggered (AB) stacking configurations. Our first-principles and symmetry-based analysis reveal that interlayer stacking symmetry plays a central role in determining the nature of electron-hole pairs. We uncover a rich variety of excitonic states, including spatially confined two-dimensional (2D) excitons, delocalized three-dimensional (3D) excitons, and charge-transfer (CT) excitons with interlayer character. The dimensionality and optical activity of these excitons are governed by the interplay among orbital character, interlayer hybridization, and symmetry-imposed selection rules. Our findings establish general principles for engineering excitonic properties in van der Waals heterostructures through controlled layer orientation and stacking order.

Title: Nonequilibrium orders in parametrically driven field theories
Authors: Carl Philipp Zelle, Romain Daviet, Andrew J. Millis, Sebastian Diehl
Abstract: Driving quantum materials with coherent light has proven a powerful platform to realize a plethora of interesting phases and transitions, ranging from ferroelectricity to superconductivity and limit cycles in pumped magnonics. In this paper we develop the field theoretical framework to describe nonequilibrium phases that emerge in systems pumped by rapid parametric drives. We consider paradigmatic O(N) models that describe the long-wavelength fluctuations of ordering fields in many condensed matter set ups. We show that rapid parametric driving of these models can induce an effective pump mechanism in the long wavelength regime through nonlinear scattering. This induces a nonequilibrium transition into a time-crystalline phase.

Title: Shaping Boundaries to Control and Transport Topological Defects in Colloidal Nematic Liquid Crystals
Authors: Gerardo Campos-Villalobos, André F. V. Matias, Ethan I. L. Jull, Lisa Tran, Marjolein Dijkstra
Abstract: Anisotropic rod-like particles form liquid crystalline phases with varying degrees of orientational and translational order. When confined geometrically, these phases can give rise to topological defects, which can be selected and controlled by tuning how the rods align near boundaries, known as anchoring. While anchoring in molecular liquid crystals can be controlled through surface functionalization, this approach is not easily applicable to microscale colloidal systems, which have so far been limited to planar anchoring. Here, using particle-based simulations, Landau-de Gennes theory, and experiments on colloidal rods, we demonstrate that topographical patterning of the boundary can effectively control the anchoring type and, in turn, the defect state in two-dimensional confined nematics. Building on this, we show that dynamically shape-shifting the boundaries can transform and transport topological defects, enabling the design of liquid crystal analogs for binary information storage.

Title: Spin-polarized triplet excitonic insulators in Ta3X8 (X=I, Br) monolayers
Authors: Haohao Sheng, Jingyu Yao, Sheng Zhang, Quansheng Wu, Zhong Fang, Xi Dai, Hongming Weng, Zhijun Wang
Abstract: Bose-Einstein condensation of spin-polarized triplet excitons can give rise to an intriguing spin supercurrent, enabling experimental detection of exciton condensation. In this work, we predict that Ta3X8 (X=I, Br) ferromagnetic monolayers are spin-polarized triplet excitonic insulators (EIs), based on the systematic first-principles GW calculations coupled with the Bethe-Salpeter equation (GW+BSE). The single-particle calculations of spin-polarized band structures reveal that these monolayers are bipolar magnetic semiconductors, where the highest valence band and the lowest conduction band possess opposite spin polarization. The two low-energy bands, primarily originating from Ta $d_{z^2}$ orbitals, are almost flat. The same-orbital parity and opposite-spin natures of the band-edge states effectively suppress dielectric screening, promoting the emergence of the EI state. The GW+BSE calculations reveal that the binding energy of the lowest-energy exciton is 1.499 eV for Ta3I8 monolayer and 1.986 eV for Ta3Br8 monolayer. Since both values exceed the respective GW band gaps, these results indicate a strong excitonic instability in these monolayers. A wavefunction analysis confirms that the lowest-energy exciton is a tightly bound Frenkel-like state, exhibiting a spin-polarized triplet nature with $S_z=1$. Our findings establish a valuable material platform for investigating spin-polarized triplet EIs, offering promising potential for spintronic applications.

Title: Disordered harmonic chain with random masses and springs: a combinatorial approach
Authors: Maximilien Bernard, Christophe Texier
Abstract: We study harmonic chains with i.i.d. random spring constants $K_n$ and i.i.d. random masses $m_n$. We introduce a new combinatorial approach which allows to derive a compact approximate expression for the complex Lyapunov exponent, in terms of the solutions of two transcendental equations involving the distributions of the spring constants and the masses. Our result makes easy the asymptotic analysis of the low frequency properties of the eigenmodes (spectral density and localization) for arbitrary disorder distribution, as well as their high frequency properties. We apply the method to the case of power-law distributions $p(K)=\mu\,K^{-1+\mu}$ with $0<K<1$ and $q(m)=\nu\,m^{-1-\nu}$ with $m>1$ (with $\mu,\:\nu>0$). At low frequency, the spectral density presents the power law $\varrho(\omega\to0)\sim\omega^{2\eta-1}$, where the exponent $\eta$ exhibits first order phase transitions on the line $\mu=1$ and on the line $\nu=1$. The exponent of the non disordered chain ($\eta=1/2$) is recovered when $\langle K_n^{-1}\rangle$ and $\langle m_n\rangle$ are both finite, i.e. $\mu>1$ and $\nu>1$. The Lyapunov exponent (inverse localization length) shows also a power-law behaviour $\gamma(\omega^2\to0)\sim\omega^{2\zeta}$, where the exponent $\zeta$ exhibits several phase transitions~: the exponent is $\zeta=\eta$ for $\mu<1$ or $\nu<1$ ($\langle K_n^{-1}\rangle$ or $\langle m_n\rangle$ infinite) and $\zeta=1$ when $\mu>2$ and $\nu>2$ ($\langle K_n^{-2}\rangle$ and $\langle m_n^2\rangle$ both finite). In the intermediate region it is given by $\zeta=\mathrm{min}(\mu,\nu)/2$. On the transition lines, $\varrho(\omega)$ and $\gamma(\omega^2)$ receive logarithmic corrections. Finally, we also consider the Anderson model with random couplings (random spring chain for ``Dyson type I'' disorder).

Title: Cluster Expansion Toward Nonlinear Modeling and Classification
Authors: Adrian Stroth, Claudia Draxl, Santiago Rigamonti
Abstract: A quantitative first-principles description of complex substitutional materials like alloys is challenging due to the vast number of configurations and the high computational cost of solving the quantum-mechanical problem. Therefore, materials properties must be modeled. The Cluster Expansion (CE) method is widely used for this purpose, but it struggles with properties that exhibit non-linear dependencies on composition, often failing even in a qualitative description. By looking at CE through the lens of machine learning, we resolve this severe problem and introduce a non-linear CE approach, yielding extremely accurate and computationally efficient results as demonstrated by distinct examples.

Title: Wetting and Pattern Formation in Non-Reciprocal Ternary Phase Separation
Authors: Xiao Ma, Michael E. Cates
Abstract: Non-reciprocal interactions are among the simplest mechanisms that drive a physical system out of thermal equilibrium, leading to novel phenomena such as oscillatory pattern formation. In this paper, we introduce a ternary phase separation model, with non-reciprocal interactions between two of the three phases and a spectator phase that mimics a boundary. Through numerical simulations, we uncover three distinct phase behaviours: a quasi-static regime, characterized by well-defined non-equilibrium contact angles at the three phase contact line; a limit cycle regime, with the three bulk phases rotating around the three phase contact line; and a travelling wave regime, featuring persistent directional motion. We complement our numerical findings with analytical examination of linear stability and the wave propagation speed near equilibrium. Our model provides a minimal framework for extending classical equilibrium wetting theory to active and non-equilibrium systems.

Abstract: Kohn anomalies are kinks or dips in phonon dispersions which are pronounced in low-dimensional materials. We investigate the effects of non-adiabatic phonon self-energy on Kohn anomalies in one-dimensional metals by developing a model that analyzes how the adiabatic phonon frequency, electron effective mass, and electron-phonon coupling strength influence phonon mode renormalization. We introduce an electron-phonon coupling strength threshold for low-temperature system instability, providing experimentalists with a tool to predict them. Finally, we validate the predictions of our model against first-principles calculations on a 4 Å-diameter carbon nanotube.

Title: Local classical correlations between physical electrons in the Hubbard model
Authors: Gabriele Bellomia, Adriano Amaricci, Massimo Capone
Abstract: We demonstrate that the local nonfreeness, an unbiased measure of correlation between electrons at a single lattice site, can be computed as the mutual information between local natural spin orbitals. Using this concept, we prove that local electron correlations in the Hubbard model are fully classical: in the natural basis the local reduced density matrix is separable and no quantum correlations beyond entanglement are present. Finally, we compare different theoretical descriptions of magnetic and nonmagnetic states, showing that local classical correlations are drastically influenced by nonlocal processes. Our results confirm the relation between local classical correlations within an open system and the nonlocal correlations with its quantum environment.

Title: Challenges and opportunities in piezoelectric polymers: Effect of oriented amorphous fraction in ferroelectric semicrystalline polymers
Authors: Guanchun Rui, Elshad Allahyarov, Zhiwen Zhu, Yanfei Huang, Thumawadee Wongwirat, Qin Zou, Philip L. Taylor, Lei Zhu
Abstract: Despite extensive research on piezoelectric polymers since the discovery of piezoelectric poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) in 1969, the fundamental physics of polymer piezoelectricity has remained elusive. Based on the classic principle of piezoelectricity, polymer piezoelectricity should originate from the polar crystalline phase. Surprisingly, the crystal contribution to the piezoelectric strain coefficient d31 is determined to be less than 10%, primarily owing to the difficulty in changing the molecular bond lengths and bond angles. Instead, >85% contribution is from Poisson's ratio, which is closely related to the oriented amorphous fraction (OAF) in uniaxially stretched films of semicrystalline ferroelectric (FE) polymers. In this perspective, the semicrystalline structure-piezoelectric property relationship is revealed using PVDF-based FE polymers as a model system. In melt-processed FE polymers, the OAF is often present and links the crystalline lamellae to the isotropic amorphous fraction. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate that the electrostrictive conformation transformation of the OAF chains induces a polarization change upon the application of either a stress (the direct piezoelectric effect) or an electric field (the converse piezoelectric effect). Meanwhile, relaxor-like secondary crystals in OAF (SCOAF), which are favored to grow in the extended-chain crystal (ECC) structure, can further enhance the piezoelectricity. However, the ECC structure is difficult to achieve in PVDF homopolymers without high-pressure crystallization. We have discovered that high-power ultrasonication can effectively induce SCOAF in PVDF homopolymers to improve its piezoelectric performance. Finally, we envision that the electrostrictive OAF mechanism should also be applicable for other FE polymers such as odd-numbered nylons and piezoelectric biopolymers.

Yousef, W. Zajkowska-Pietrzak, R. Sobierajski
Abstract: The ultrafast response of iron lattice to sub-ps pulsed laser-induced heating has been investigated using time-resolved XRD in the partial melting regime. Strong electron-phonon coupling in Fe leads to rapid heating within 1-2 ps post laser-irradiation, followed by lattice expansion and melting on the 2-5 ps timescale. A tetragonal distortion of the remaining bcc-phase emerges at 6 ps and the unit-cell volume increases up to a value characteristic for the bcc-Fe phase. Under the experimental conditions, the bct-Fe remains metastable up to at least 60 ps, gradually relaxing toward the bcc phase without fully reverting. These findings provide new insight into the ultrafast dynamics, structural pathways, and stability of transient phases during the early stages of solid-solid phase transitions in bcc metals.

Title: Surface states and finite size effects in triple-fold semimetals
Authors: A.Yu. Prykhodko, E.V. Gorbar, P.O. Sukhachov
Abstract: Triple-fold or pseudospin-1 semimetals belong to a class of multi-fold materials in which linearly dispersive bands and flat bands intersect at the same point, forming triple-fold crossing points. We conduct an analytical investigation of topologically protected Fermi arc surface states and finite-size effects in three-dimensional (3D) triple-fold and doubly degenerate triple-fold semimetals in continuum low-energy models. Higher topological charge of the triple-fold crossing points leads to two Fermi arcs connecting the nodes. For a single triple-fold crossing point, we found that no term in the Hamiltonian with momentum-independent elements can open a gap, prompting us to consider a doubly-degenerate triple-fold fermion, where the gap can be opened by mixing the degenerate copies. Thin films of triple-fold semimetals allow for mixing between the surface and bulk states in addition to the discretization of energy levels of the latter.

Title: Quantum critical dynamical response of the twisted Kitaev spin chain
Authors: Uliana E. Khodaeva, Dmitry L. Kovrizhin, Johannes Knolle
Abstract: The dynamical structure factor of the transverse field Ising model (TFIM) shows universal power-law divergence at its quantum critical point, signatures of which have been arguably observed in inelastic neutron scattering studies of quantum spin chain materials, for example CoNb2O6. However, it has been recently suggested that its microscopic description is better captured in terms of a twisted Kitaev spin chain (TKSC) with bond-anisotropic couplings. Here, we present exact results for the dynamical structure factor of the TKSC across its quantum critical point, analyzing both the universal low-frequency response and the non-universal high-energy features. In addition, we explore extensions of the model including broken glide symmetry as well as the case of random, and incommensurate magnetic fields. Notably, in the latter case the fermionic excitations exhibit a localization-delocalization transition, which is manifest in the dynamical response as a distinct signature at finite frequency. We discuss the relevance of these features for the observation of quantum critical response in experiments.

Title: To Flow or Not To Flow? The granular Bond number to predict clogging in low gravity
Authors: Oliver Gaida, Olfa D'Angelo, Jonathan E. Kollmer
Abstract: In granular hopper flow, is the clogging probability influenced by gravity? Clogging, the spontaneous arrest of granular flow through a constriction, is a fundamental and widespread phenomenon in granular processing. Accurately predicting clogging risk is essential for space-related activities. Yet, conflicting results leave us without a reliable way to extrapolate terrestrial data to low gravity. We introduce an in-bulk definition of the dimensionless granular Bond number, B, to scale clogging probability from Earth gravity to low gravity. By testing multiple lunar regolith simulants in Earth and Moon gravitational accelerations, using an active drop tower, we reveal that low gravity significantly increases clogging risk, challenging previous findings. We observe a gravity-induced shift in the critical orifice below which clogging occurs by up to one order of magnitude. Scaling data with the Bond number unifies scattered results into a state diagram predicting clogging across materials and gravitational accelerations. Our findings provide a practical tool for anticipating granular clogging in reduced gravity, informing future space missions.

Title: Leveraging Transfer Learning to Overcome Data Limitations in Czochralski Crystal Growth
Authors: Milena Petkovic, Natasha Dropka, Xia Tang, Janina Zittel
Abstract: The Czochralski (Cz) method is a widely used process for growing high-quality single crystals, critical for applications in semiconductors, optics, and advanced materials. Achieving optimal growth conditions requires precise control of process and furnace design parameters. Still, data scarcity -- especially for new materials -- limits the application of machine learning (ML) in predictive modeling and optimization. This study proposes a transfer learning approach to overcome this limitation by adapting ML models trained on a higher data volume of one source material (Si) to a lower data volume of another target material (Ge and GaAs). The materials were deliberately selected to assess the robustness of the transfer learning approach in handling varying data similarity, with Cz-Ge being similar to Cz-Si, and GaAs grown via the liquid encapsulated Czochralski method (LEC), which differs from Cz-Si. We explore various transfer learning strategies, including Warm Start, Merged Training, and Hyperparameters Transfer, and evaluate multiple ML architectures across two different materials. Our results demonstrate that transfer learning significantly enhances predictive accuracy with minimal data, providing a practical framework for optimizing Cz growth parameters across diverse materials.

Title: Role of bubble positioning in force induced melting of DNA
Authors: Bidisha Mukherjee, Amit Raj Singh, Garima Mishra
Abstract: We investigate the role of bubble positioning in the force-induced melting of double-stranded DNA using two distinct approaches: Brownian Dynamics simulations and the Gaussian Network Model. We isolate the effect of bubble positioning by using DNA molecules with 50% AT - 50% GC base-pair composition which ensures constant enthalpy. Our results reveal that it is not just the sequence itself, but its specific arrangement that influences DNA stability. We examine two types of DNA sequences containing a block of either AT or GC base-pairs, resulting in the formation of a large bubble or a smaller bubble within the DNA, respectively. By systematically shifting these blocks along the strand, we investigate how their positioning influences the force-temperature phase diagram of DNA. Our Brownian dynamics simulations reveal that, at high forces, melting of the entire DNA strand is initiated after stretching $\approx 9$ GC base-pairs, independent of the specific base-pair sequence. In contrast, no such characteristic length scale is observed in the Gaussian network model. Our study suggests that free strand entropy plays a significant role in determining the force-temperature phase diagram of the DNA.

Title: Hierarchical friction memory leads to subdiffusive configurational dynamics of fast-folding proteins
Authors: Anton Klimek, Benjamin A. Dalton, Lucas Tepper, Roland R. Netz
Abstract: Proteins often exhibit subdiffusive configurational dynamics. The origins of this subdiffusion are still unresolved. We investigate the impact of non-Markovian friction and the free energy landscape on the dynamics of fast-folding proteins in terms of the mean squared displacement (MSD) and the mean first-passage-time (MFPT) of the folding reaction coordinate. We find the friction memory kernel from published molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to be well-described by a hierarchical multi-exponential function, which gives rise to subdiffusion in the MSD over a finite range of time. We show that friction memory effects in fast-folding proteins dominate the scaling behavior of the MSD compared to effects due to the folding free energy landscape. As a consequence, Markovian models are insufficient for capturing the folding dynamics, as quantified by the MSD and the MFPT, even when including coordinate-dependent friction. Our results demonstrate the importance of memory effects in protein folding and conformational dynamics and explicitly show that subdiffusion in fast-folding protein dynamics originates from memory effects, not from the free energy landscape and not from coordinate-dependent friction.

Title: Chelation of the mercury ions by polyethyleneimine: Atomistic molecular dynamics study
Authors: Halyna Butovych, Jaroslav Ilnytskyi, Erkki Lahderanta, Taras Patsahan
Abstract: Contamination of water by heavy metal ions represents a significant environmental concern. Among various remediation methods, chelation has proven to be an effective technique in water treatment processes. This study investigates the chelating properties of linear polyethyleneimine (PEI) and its complexation with divalent mercury ions (Hg2+) in aqueous solution. Atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were carried out using the OPLS/AA force field to examine the microscopic structure of PEI-Hg2+ complexes. PEI chains of varying lengths were considered, and it was found that a single linear PEI molecule containing ten amino groups is capable of coordinating up to four Hg2+ ions. The stability of the resulting complexes was further supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

Title: Neel Skyrmion interactions derived by their arrangement in regular lattices
Authors: Ioanna Karagianni, Ioannis Panagiotopoulos
Abstract: The coarse-grained interactions between Néel skyrmions, stabilized by interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya coupling (iDMI), are studied through the properties of their hexagonal lattices by micromagnetic simulations. The interactions with the film edges are excluded by imposing periodic boundary conditions. The dependence of skyrmion size and interaction energy on the distance is derived. Two types of behavior are observed depending on the value of iDMI compared to the critical value Dc above which the skyrmion size diverges: For iDMI < Dc the skyrmions acquire a finite size that saturates at maximum value independent of the skyrmion distance that corresponds to the one of the isolated skyrmion. This energy is above that of the homogeneous ferromagnetic state. For iDMI > Dc the skyrmions tend to increase in size to the extent that their neighboring skyrmions permit and finite size skyrmions can be stabilized only in arrays due to their mutual repulsion. These configurations have energy below that of the homogeneous ferromagnetic state.

Title: Generalized energy band alignment model for van der Waals heterostructures with a charge spillage dipole
Authors: Seungjun Lee, Eng Hock Lee, Young-Kyun Kwon, Steven J. Koester, Phaedon Avouris, Vladimir Cherkassky, Jerry Tersoff, Tony Low
Abstract: The energy band alignment at the interface of van der Waals heterostructures (vdWHs) is a key design parameter for next-generation electronic and optoelectronic devices. Although the Anderson and midgap models have been widely adopted for bulk semiconductor heterostructures, they exhibit severe limitations when applied to vdWHs, particularly for type-III systems. Based on first-principles calculations for approximately $10^3$ vdWHs, we demonstrate these traditional models miss a critical dipole arising from interlayer charge spillage. We introduce a generalized linear response (gLR) model that includes this dipole through a quantum capacitance term while remaining analytically compact. With only two readily computed inputs, the charge neutrality level offset and the sum of the isolated-layer bandgaps, the gLR reproduces DFT band line-ups with $r^2\sim$0.9 across type-I, II, and III stacks. Machine-learning feature analysis confirms that these two descriptors dominate the underlying physics, indicating the model is near-minimal and broadly transferable. The gLR framework therefore provides both mechanistic insight and a fast, accurate surrogate for high-throughput screening of the vast vdW heterostructure design space.

Title: Finite-momentum superconductivity from chiral bands in twisted MoTe$_2$
Authors: Yinqi Chen, Cheng Xu, Yang Zhang, Constantin Schrade
Abstract: A recent experiment has reported unconventional superconductivity in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$, emerging from a normal state that exhibits a finite anomalous Hall effect -- a signature of intrinsic chirality. Motivated by this discovery, we construct a continuum model for twisted MoTe$_2$ constrained by lattice symmetries from first-principles calculations that captures the moiré-induced inversion symmetry breaking even in the absence of a displacement field. Building on this model, we show that repulsive interactions give rise to finite-momentum superconductivity via the Kohn-Luttinger mechanism in this chiral moiré system. Remarkably, the finite-momentum superconducting state can arise solely from internal symmetry breaking of the moiré superlattice, differentiating it from previously studied cases that require external fields. It further features a nonreciprocal quasiparticle dispersion and an intrinsic superconducting diode effect. Our results highlight a novel route to unconventional superconducting states in twisted transition metal dichalcogenides moiré systems, driven entirely by intrinsic symmetry-breaking effects.

Title: Electrostatic control of quantum phases in KTaO3-based planar constrictions
Authors: Jordan T. McCourt, Ethan G. Arnault, Merve Baksi, Samuel J. Poage, Salva Salmani-Rezaie, Divine P. Kumah, Kaveh Ahadi, Gleb Finkelstein
Abstract: Two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) formed at complex oxide interfaces offer a unique platform to engineer quantum nanostructures. However, scalable fabrication of locally addressable devices in these materials remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate an efficient fabrication approach by patterning narrow constrictions in a superconducting KTaO3-based heterostructure. The constrictions are individually tunable via the coplanar side gates formed within the same 2DEG plane. Our technique leverages the high dielectric permittivity of KTaO3 (epsilon_r ~ 5000) to achieve strong electrostatic modulation of the superconducting 2DEG. Transport measurements through the constriction reveal a range of transport regimes: Within the superconducting state, we demonstrate efficient modulation of the critical current and Berezinskii Kosterlitz Thouless (BKT) transition temperature at the weak link. Further tuning of the gate voltage reveals an unexpectedly regular Coulomb blockade pattern. All of these states are achievable with a side gate voltage |V_SG| < 1 V. The fabrication process is scalable and versatile, enabling a platform both to make superconducting field-effect transistors and to study a wide array of physical phenomena present at complex oxide interfaces.

Title: Weyl's Relations, Integrable Matrix Models and Quantum Computation
Authors: B. Sriram Shastry, Emil A. Yuzbashyan, Aniket Patra
Abstract: Starting from a generalization of Weyl's relations in finite dimension $N$, we show that the Heisenberg commutation relations can be satisfied in a specific $N-1$ dimensional subspace, and display a linear map for projecting operators to this subspace. This setup is used to construct a hierarchy of parameter-dependent commuting matrices in $N$ dimensions. This family of commuting matrices is then related to Type-1 matrices representing quantum integrable models. The commuting matrices find an interesting application in quantum computation, specifically in Grover's database search problem. Each member of the hierarchy serves as a candidate Hamiltonian for quantum adiabatic evolution and, in some cases, achieves higher fidelity than standard choices -- thus offering improved performance.

Title: CaF+CaF interactions in the ground and excited electronic states: implications for collisional losses
Authors: Dibyendu Sardar, Marcin Gronowski, Michał Tomza, John L. Bohn
Abstract: Accurate \textit{ab initio} potential energy surfaces are essential to understand and predict collisional outcomes in ultracold molecular systems. In this study, we explore the intermolecular interactions between two laser-cooled CaF molecules, both in their ground and excited electronic states, aiming to understand the mechanisms behind the observed collisional losses on the non-reactive, spin-polarized surface of the CaF+CaF system. Using state-of-the-art \textit{ab initio} methods, we compute twelve electronic states of the Ca$_2$F$_2$ complex within the rigid rotor approximation applied to CaF. Calculating the potential energy surfaces for the excited electronic states of Ca$_2$F$_2$ is challenging and computationally expensive. Our approach employs the multireference configuration interaction method, restricted to single and double excitations, along with a reasonably large active space to ensure the convergence in the excited states. We also compute the spin-orbit coupling between the ground state and the lowest spin-polarized triplet state, as well as the spin-spin coupling within the lowest triplet state (1) $^3\mathrm{A}'$. Additionally, we determine the electric transition dipole moments for the (1) $^3\mathrm{A}'$-(2) $^3\mathrm{A}'$ and (1) $^3\mathrm{A}'$-(1) $^3\mathrm{A}''$ transitions. Notably, we find that the lowest spin-polarized state (1) $^3\mathrm{A}'$, shifted by 1064 nm of laser light from the optical dipole trap, intersects several electronically excited states. Finally, by analyzing the potential energy surfaces, we discuss two plausible pathways that may account for the observed collisional losses on the spin-polarized surface of the CaF+CaF system.

Title: Coupled Entropy: A Goldilocks Generalization?
Authors: Kenric P. Nelson
Abstract: Nonextensive Statistical Mechanics (NSM) has developed into a powerful toolset for modeling and analyzing complex systems. Despite its many successes, a puzzle arose early in its development. The constraints on the Tsallis entropy are in the form of an escort distribution with elements proportional to $p_i^q$, but this same factor within the Tsallis entropy function is not normalized. This led to consideration of the Normalized Tsallis Entropy (NTE); however, the normalization proved to make the function unstable. I will provide evidence that the coupled entropy, which divides NTE by $1 + d\kappa$, where $d$ is the dimension and $\kappa$ is the coupling, may provide the necessary robustness necessary for applications like machine learning. The definition for the coupled entropy and its maximizing distributions, the coupled exponential family, arises from clarifying how the number of independent random variables $(q)$ is composed of the nonlinear properties of complex systems, $q=1+\frac{\alpha\kappa}{1+d\kappa}$, where $\alpha$ is the nonlinear parameter governing the shape of distributions near their location and $\kappa$ is the parameter determining the asymptotic tail decay. Foundationally, for complex systems, the coupling is the measure of nonlinearity inducing non-exponential distributions and the degree of nonadditivity entropy. As such, the coupling is a strong candidate as a measure of statistical complexity.

Title: Three-Dimensional Porous Structures of CO$_2$-Induced Salt Precipitation Sustaining Halite Self-Enhancing Growth
Authors: Mohammad Nooraiepour, Mohammad Masoudi, Hannelore Derluyn, Pascale Senechal, Peter Moonen, Helge Hellevang
Abstract: Salt precipitation during CO$_2$ storage in saline aquifers presents challenges for injectivity and containment, with broader implications for soil salinization and cultural heritage preservation. This study utilizes time-lapse X-ray and spectral micro-computed tomography, scanning electron microscopy, and deep learning-assisted image analysis to investigate halite crystallization and brine consumption in porous medium. We identified three-dimensional halite growth structures functioning as a secondary porous medium. Visualizing the spatio-temporal dynamics of salt-brine coexistence and halite precipitation revealed critical insights into the self-enhancing nature of salt growth. Expanding gas-liquid contact surfaces and initial crystal nucleation sites significantly enhanced evaporation and growth rates. Hydrophilic halite crystals attract brine films, establishing a feedback loop that perpetuates growth. The encapsulation of brine between grain surfaces and umbrella-like salt crusts was observed. Delineating the self-enhancing growth, including the role of capillary forces and surface-interface processes, is crucial for improving CO$_2$ injection efficiency and integrity, as well as for addressing environmental challenges related to soil salinization.

Title: Differentiable neural network representation of multi-well, locally-convex potentials
Authors: Reese E. Jones, Adrian Buganza Tepole, Jan N. Fuhg
Abstract: Multi-well potentials are ubiquitous in science, modeling phenomena such as phase transitions, dynamic instabilities, and multimodal behavior across physics, chemistry, and biology. In contrast to non-smooth minimum-of-mixture representations, we propose a differentiable and convex formulation based on a log-sum-exponential (LSE) mixture of input convex neural network (ICNN) modes. This log-sum-exponential input convex neural network (LSE-ICNN) provides a smooth surrogate that retains convexity within basins and allows for gradient-based learning and inference. A key feature of the LSE-ICNN is its ability to automatically discover both the number of modes and the scale of transitions through sparse regression, enabling adaptive and parsimonious modeling. We demonstrate the versatility of the LSE-ICNN across diverse domains, including mechanochemical phase transformations, microstructural elastic instabilities, conservative biological gene circuits, and variational inference for multimodal probability distributions. These examples highlight the effectiveness of the LSE-ICNN in capturing complex multimodal landscapes while preserving differentiability, making it broadly applicable in data-driven modeling, optimization, and physical simulation.

Title: XtalOpt Version 14: Variable-Composition Crystal Structure Search for Functional Materials Through Pareto Optimization
Authors: Samad Hajinazar, Eva Zurek
Abstract: Version 14 of XtalOpt, evolutionary multi-objective global optimization algorithm for crystal structure prediction, is now available for download from its official website this https URL. The new version of the code is designed to perform ground state search for novel crystal structures with variable composition by integrating a suite of ab initio methods alongside classical and machine-learning potentials for structural relaxation. The multi-objective search framework has been further enhanced through the introduction of Pareto optimization, enabling efficient discovery of functional materials. Here, we describe the implemented methodologies, provide detailed instructions for their use, and present an overview of additional improvements included in XtalOpt version 14.

Title: AutomataGPT: Forecasting and Ruleset Inference for Two-Dimensional Cellular Automata
Authors: Jaime A. Berkovich, Noah S. David, Markus J. Buehler
Abstract: Cellular automata (CA) provide a minimal formalism for investigating how simple local interactions generate rich spatiotemporal behavior in domains as diverse as traffic flow, ecology, tissue morphogenesis and crystal growth. However, automatically discovering the local update rules for a given phenomenon and using them for quantitative prediction remains challenging. Here we present AutomataGPT, a decoder-only transformer pretrained on around 1 million simulated trajectories that span 100 distinct two-dimensional binary deterministic CA rules on toroidal grids. When evaluated on previously unseen rules drawn from the same CA family, AutomataGPT attains 98.5% perfect one-step forecasts and reconstructs the governing update rule with up to 96% functional (application) accuracy and 82% exact rule-matrix match. These results demonstrate that large-scale pretraining over wider regions of rule space yields substantial generalization in both the forward (state forecasting) and inverse (rule inference) problems, without hand-crafted priors. By showing that transformer models can faithfully infer and execute CA dynamics from data alone, our work lays the groundwork for abstracting real-world dynamical phenomena into data-efficient CA surrogates, opening avenues in biology, tissue engineering, physics and AI-driven scientific discovery.

Title: Optical excitation and stabilization of ultracold field-linked tetratomic molecules
Authors: Bijit Mukherjee, Michał Tomza
Abstract: We propose a coherent optical population transfer of weakly bound field-linked tetratomic molecules (FL tetramers) to deeper bound states using stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP). We consider static-electric-field shielded polar alkali-metal diatomic molecules and corresponding FL tetramers in their $\textrm{X}^1\Sigma^+ + \textrm{X}^1\Sigma^+$ ground electronic state. We show that the excited metastable $\textrm{X}^1\Sigma^+ + \textrm{b}^3\Pi$ electronic manifold supports FL tetramers in a broader range of electric fields with collisional shielding extended to zero field. We calculate the Franck-Condon factors between the ground and excited FL tetramers and show that they are highly tunable with the electric field. We also predict photoassociation (PA) of ground-state shielded molecules to the excited FL states in free-bound optical transitions. We propose proof-of-principle experiments to implement STIRAP and PA using FL tetramers, paving the way for the formation of deeply bound ultracold polyatomic molecules.

Title: A facility for thermo-mechanical characterization of fusion magnet materials during cryogenic ion irradiation
Authors: Akarsh Aurora, Alexis R Devitre, Angus PC Wylie, Jonas A Rajagopal, Michael P Short
Abstract: Commercial fusion power plants demand magnet materials that retain structural integrity and thermal conductivity while operating under the bombardment of energetic neutrons at cryogenic temperatures. Understanding how thermo-mechanical properties evolve under such extreme loads is crucial for selecting materials with high radiation tolerance and predictable failure mechanisms. Presented here is a facility that combines cryogenic transient grating spectroscopy (TGS) with simultaneous ion irradiation, enabling in-situ measurements of thermal diffusivity and surface acoustic wave (SAW) frequency spectra. Employing copper as a benchmark material, an irradiation was performed at 30 K with 12.4 MeV $\text{Cu}^{6+}$ ions producing a final fluence of $1.9 \times 10^{17}$ ions/m$^2$. Over the irradiation period, thermal diffusivity nearly halved from an initial value of $1.2 \times 10^{-4}$ $\text{m}^2/\text{s}$ while SAW speed did not show significant change, maintaining a value of $2162\pm18$ m/s. Given its real-time monitoring capability and the numerous candidate materials that remain uncharacterized under fusion magnet operating conditions, this facility is poised to deliver new scientific insights into fusion magnet material degradation trends, contributing to improved design criteria and operational certainty for forthcoming fusion power plants.

Title: Magnetic Hysteresis Experiments Performed on Quantum Annealers
Authors: Elijah Pelofske, Frank Barrows, Pratik Sathe, Cristiano Nisoli
Abstract: Quantum annealers have emerged as versatile and controllable platforms for experimenting on exotic spin systems that model quantum materials. However, quantum annealing experiments have yet to explore magnetic memory and hysteresis, features seemingly at odds with hardware designed to escape metastable states via quantum tunneling, favoring forgetfulness. Here, we present a general protocol to experiment on magnetic hysteresis in a transverse-field Ising model. We implement it on three D-Wave superconducting flux qubit annealers, using up to thousands of spins, and explore both ferromagnetic and disordered Ising models across contrasting graph topologies. Crucially, we observe robust memory retention in hysteresis loops, establishing quantum annealers as a platform for probing non-equilibrium emergent magnetic phenomena. This approach enables many topics of future exploration including return point memory and hysteresis in frustrated or topologically ordered systems, thus broadening the role of analog quantum computers into foundational questions in condensed matter physics.

Title: The physics, travels, and tribulations of Ronald Wilfrid Gurney
Authors: Brian R. Pollard, Saman Alavi
Abstract: Ronald Wilfrid Gurney is one of the lesser-known research students of the Cavendish Laboratory in the mid 1920s. Gurney made significant contributions to the application of quantum mechanics to problems related to tunneling of alpha-particles from nuclei, to formation of images in photographic plates, the understanding of the origin of color-centres in salt crystals, and in the theory of semiconductors. He was the first physicist to apply quantum mechanics to the theory of electrochemistry and ionic solutions. He also made fundamental contributions to ballistics research. Gurney wrote a number of textbooks on fundamental and applied quantum mechanics in a distinctive style which are still useful as educational resources. In addition to his scientific contributions, he travelled extensively, and during and after World War II worked in the United States. During the cold war, he got entangled in the Klaus Fuchs affair and lost his employment. He died at the age of 54 in 1953 from a stroke. With the approach of the 100th year anniversary of quantum mechanics, it is timely to commemorate the life and contributions of this somewhat forgotten physicist.

Title: Multi-NARP Laser Driving Scheme for Multiplexed Quantum Networks
Authors: Ali Binai Motlagh, Grant Wilbur, Nour Allam, Giannis Tolis, Lilly Daw, S. ONeal, Dennis G. Deppe, Kimberley C. Hall
Abstract: We extend the recently developed NARP scheme for laser-triggered single-photon sources to the simultaneous excitation of multiple emitters with varying transition energies, laying the groundwork for wavelength-division multiplexing in quantum optical networks. Our Multi-NARP scheme does not rely on polarization filtering and thus enables the near-unity extraction efficiency of single photons from each quantum dot. Our approach also offers the advantages of robustness to variations in the laser pulse parameters and immunity to excitation-induced dephasing tied to electron-phonon coupling. We show that simultaneous triggering of at least 10 emitters is possible, enabling the development of high-bandwidth quantum networks.

Title: Refining Tc Prediction in Hydrides via Symbolic-Regression-Enhanced Electron-Localization-Function-Based Descriptors
Authors: Francesco Belli, Sean Torres, Julia Contreras-Garcìa, Eva Zurek
Abstract: Hydrogen-based materials are able to possess extremely high superconducting critical temperatures, \tc s, due to hydrogen's low atomic mass and strong electron-phonon interaction. Recently, a descriptor based on the Electron Localization Function (ELF) has enabled the rapid estimation of the \tc\ of hydrogen-containing compounds from electronic networking properties, but its applicability has been limited by the small size and homogeneity of the training dataset used. Herein, the model is re-examined compiling a publicly available combined dataset of 244 binary and ternary hydride superconductors. Our analysis shows that though ELF-based networking remains a valuable descriptor, its predictive power declines with increasing compositional complexity. However, by introducing the molecularity index, defined as the highest value of the ELF at which two hydrogen atoms connect, and applying symbolic regression, the accuracy of the predictions can be substantially enhanced. These results establish a more robust framework for assessing superconductivity in hydride materials, facilitating accelerated screening of novel candidates through integration with crystal structure prediction methods or high-throughput searches.

Abstract: We present a dry surface treatment combining atomic layer etching and deposition (ALE and ALD) to mitigate dielectric loss in fully fabricated superconducting quantum devices formed from aluminum thin films on silicon. The treatment, performed as a final processing step prior to device packaging, starts by conformally removing the native metal oxide and fabrication residues from the exposed surfaces through ALE before \textit{in situ} encapsulating the metal surfaces with a thin dielectric layer using ALD. We measure a two-fold reduction in loss attributed to two-level system (TLS) absorption in treated aluminum-based resonators and planar transmon qubits. Treated transmons with compact capacitor plates and gaps achieve median $Q$ and $T_1$ values of $3.69 \pm 0.42 \times 10^6$ and $196 \pm 22$~$\mu$s, respectively. These improvements were found to be sustained over several months. We discuss how the combination of ALE and ALD reverses fabrication-induced surface damages to significantly and durably improve device performance via a reduction of the TLS defect density in the capacitive elements.

Title: Enhancing Stress-Strain Predictions with Seq2Seq and Cross-Attention based on Small Punch Test
Authors: Zhengni Yang, Rui Yang, Weijian Han, Qixin Liu
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel deep-learning approach to predict true stress-strain curves of high-strength steels from small punch test (SPT) load-displacement data. The proposed approach uses Gramian Angular Field (GAF) to transform load-displacement sequences into images, capturing spatial-temporal features and employs a Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) model with an LSTM-based encoder-decoder architecture, enhanced by multi-head cross-attention to improved accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior prediction accuracy, with minimum and maximum mean absolute errors of 0.15 MPa and 5.58 MPa, respectively. The proposed method offers a promising alternative to traditional experimental techniques in materials science, enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of true stress-strain relationship predictions.

Title: Self-organized Collapse of Societies
Authors: Alexander Jochim, Stefan Bornholdt
Abstract: Why are human societies unstable? Theories based on the observation of recurring patterns in historical data indicate that economic inequality, as well as social factors are key drivers. So far, models of this phenomenon are more macroscopic in nature. However, basic mechanisms at work could be accessible to minimal mathematical models. Here we combine a simple mechanism for economic growth with a mechanism for the spreading of social dissatisfaction. Broad wealth distributions generated by the economic mechanism eventually trigger social unrest and the destruction of wealth, leading to an emerging pattern of boom and bust. We find that the model time scales compare well with empirical data. The model emphasizes the role of broad (power law) wealth distributions for dynamical social phenomena.

Title: Imaging of microwave magnetic field orientation using continuous-wave experiments on nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond
Authors: Akshat Rana, Pooja Lamba, Atanu Ghosh, Siddharth Dhomkar, Rama K. Kamineni
Abstract: Imaging of microwave magnetic fields with nano-scale resolution has interesting applications. Specifically, detecting the orientation of the microwave fields is useful in condensed matter physics and quantum control. However, most of the existing methods for microwave field imaging are limited to detecting the magnitude of the fields. Due to their small sensor size and favorable optical and spin properties, nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are highly suitable for imaging dc and ac magnetic fields. The reported methods for detecting the orientation of microwave magnetic fields use pulsed Rabi frequency measurements. Here, we demonstrate imaging of the orientation of microwave magnetic fields by only using continuous-wave experiments on NV centers. This simplifies the sensor apparatus and is particularly advantageous in applications where pulsing of the target microwave field is not possible. The method requires static bias magnetic field oriented perpendicular to the quantization axis of NV centers. We detect the direction of an arbitrary microwave magnetic field using NV centers of two different orientations. Moreover, we demonstrate that the projection of the microwave fields onto a plane can be imaged using NV centers of single orientation. It can be straightforwardly implemented using a single NV center.

Authors: Paniz Foshat, Shima Poorgholam-khanjari, Valentino Seferai, Hua Feng, Susan Johny, Oleg A. Mukhanov, Matthew Hutchings, Robert H. Hadfield, Martin Weides, Kaveh Delfanazari
Abstract: Exchanging energy below the superconducting gap introduces quasiparticle energy distributions in superconducting quantum circuits, which will be responsible for their decoherence. This study examines the impact of quasiparticle energy on the performance of NbN superconducting microwave coplanar waveguide resonators on silicon chips. We measured the resonance frequency and internal quality factor in response to temperature sweeps to evaluate the effect of quasiparticle dynamics. Moreover, by calculating the complex conductivity of the NbN film, we identified the contribution of quasiparticle density to the experimental results.

Title: Basal layer of granular flow down smooth and rough inclines: kinematics, slip laws and rheology
Authors: Teng Wang, Lu Jing, Fiona C.Y. Kwok, Yuri D. Sobral, Thomas Weinhart, Anthony R. Thornton
Abstract: Granular flow down an inclined plane is ubiquitous in geophysical and industrial applications. On rough inclines, the flow exhibits Bagnold's velocity profile and follows the so-called $\mu(I)$ local rheology. On insufficiently rough or smooth inclines, however, velocity slip occurs at the bottom and a basal layer with strong agitation emerges below the bulk, which is not predicted by the local rheology. Here, we use discrete element method simulations to study detailed dynamics of the basal layer in granular flows down both smooth and rough inclines. We control the roughness via a dimensionless parameter, $R_a$, varied systematically from 0 (flat, frictional plane) to near 1 (very rough plane). Three flow regimes are identified: a slip regime ($R_a \lesssim 0.45$) where a dilated basal layer appears, a no-slip regime ($R_a \gtrsim 0.6$) and an intermediate transition regime. In the slip regime, the kinematics profiles (velocity, shear rate and granular temperature) of the basal layer strongly deviate from Bagnold's profiles. General basal slip laws are developed which express the slip velocity as a function of the local shear rate (or granular temperature), base roughness and slope angle. Moreover, the basal layer thickness is insensitive to flow conditions but depends somewhat on the inter-particle coefficient of restitution. Finally, we show that the rheological properties of the basal layer do not follow the $\mu(I)$ rheology, but are captured by Bagnold's stress scaling and an extended kinetic theory for granular flows. Our findings can help develop more predictive granular flow models in the future.

Title: Analyzing partially-polarized light with a photonic deep random neural network
Authors: Alessandro Petrini, Claudio Conti, Davide Pierangeli
Abstract: Optical neural networks are emerging as a powerful and versatile tool for processing optical signals directly in the optical domain with superior speed, integrability, and functionality. Their application to optical polarization enables neuromorphic polarization sensors, but their operation is limited to fully-polarized light. Here, we demonstrate single-shot analysis of partially-polarized beams with a photonic random neural network (PRNN). The PRNN is composed of a series of optical layers implemented by a stack of scattering media and a few trainable digital nodes. The setup infers the degree-of-polarization and the Stokes parameters of the polarized component with precision comparable to off-the-shelf polarimeters. The use of several optical layers allows to enhance the accuracy, reduce the sensor size, and minimize digital costs, demonstrating the advantage of a deep optical encoder for processing polarization information. Our results point out photonic neural networks as fast, compact, broadband, low-cost polarimeters that are widely applicable from sensing to imaging.

Title: Thermal Uhlmann-Chern Number: Bridging Pure and Mixed States
Authors: Xin Wang, Xu-Yang Hou, Yan He, Hao Guo
Abstract: Topological properties of quantum systems at finite temperatures, described by mixed states, pose significant challenges due to the triviality of the Uhlmann bundle. We introduce the thermal Uhlmann-Chern number, a generalization of the Chern number, to characterize the topological properties of mixed states. By inserting the density matrix into the Chern character, we introduce the thermal Uhlmann-Chern number, a generalization of the Chern number that reduces to the pure-state value in the zero-temperature limit and vanishes at infinite temperature, providing a framework to study the temperature-dependent evolution of topological features in mixed states. We provide, for the first time, a rigorous mathematical proof that the first- and higher-order Uhlmann-Chern numbers converge to the corresponding Chern numbers in the zero-temperature limit, differing only by a factor of $1/D$ for $D$-fold degenerate ground states. We demonstrate the utility of this framework through applications to a two-level system, the coherent state model, the 2D Haldane model, and a four-band model, highlighting the temperature-dependent behavior of topological invariants. Our results establish a robust bridge between the topological properties of pure and mixed states, offering new insights into finite-temperature topological phases.

Title: Size distribution of decaying foam bubbles
Authors: Ildoo Kim
Abstract: The most studies on the stability of foam bubbles investigated the mechanical stability of thin films between bubbles due to the drainage by gravity. In the current work, we take an alternative approach by assuming the rupture of bubbles as a series of random events and by investigating the time evolution of the size distribution of foam bubbles over a long time up to several hours. For this purpose, we first prepared layers of bubbles on Petri dishes by shaking soap solutions of a few different concentrations, and then we monitored the Petri dishes by using a time-lapse video imaging technique. We analyzed the captured images by custom software to count the bubble size distribution with respect to the initial concentration and elapsed time. From the statistics on our data, we find that the total bubble volume decreases exponentially in time, and the exponent, i.e. the mean lifetime, is a function of the bubble size. The mean lifetimes of larger bubbles are observed to be shorter than those of smaller bubbles, by approximately a factor of 2.

Title: Entanglement growth and information capacity in a quasiperiodic system with a single-particle mobility edge
Authors: Yuqi Qing, Yu-Qin Chen, Shi-Xin Zhang
Abstract: We investigate the quantum dynamics of a one-dimensional quasiperiodic system featuring a single-particle mobility edge (SPME), described by the generalized Aubry-André (GAA) model. This model offers a unique platform to study the consequences of coexisting localized and extended eigenstates, which contrasts sharply with the abrupt localization transition in the standard Aubry-André model. We analyze the system's response to a quantum quench through two complementary probes: entanglement entropy (EE) and subsystem information capacity (SIC). We find that the SPME induces a smooth crossover in all dynamical signatures. The EE saturation value exhibits a persistent volume-law scaling in the mobility-edge phase, with an entropy density that continuously decreases as the number of available extended states decreases. Complementing this, the SIC profile interpolates between the linear ramp characteristic of extended systems and the information trapping behavior of localized ones, directly visualizing the mixed nature of the underlying spectrum. Our results establish unambiguous dynamical fingerprints of a mobility edge, providing a crucial non-interacting benchmark for understanding information and entanglement dynamics in more complex systems with mixed phases.

Title: Solid-State Optical Magnetometer: Next-Generation Approach to Sub-Nanotesla Magnetic Sensing
Authors: O. Daneshmandi, M. Alidadi, Y.M. Banad, S. S. Sharif
Abstract: We present a Solid-State Optical Magnetometer (SOM) based on black phosphorus (BP) multilayers, offering a compact, scalable, and highly sensitive alternative to traditional atomic-based magnetometers. Utilizing BP's intrinsic linear dichroism in a metasurface cavity, the SOM achieves sub-nanotesla precision and vector magnetic field sensing. BP enhances light-matter interactions, enabling tunable optical responses driven by Lorentz force-induced cavity deformation. Optimized metasurface unit cells increase polarization-dependent absorption, improving detection sensitivity. Finite Element Method simulations show high linearity (R-squared > 0.999), tunable dynamic range, and adjustable sensitivity via current modulation. At 200 microamps, the SOM reaches a sensitivity of 31.25 picotesla, while lower currents expand the dynamic range up to +-10 nanotesla. This tunability allows for application-specific optimization in areas such as biomagnetic sensing, metrology, and industrial field detection. Unlike SQUIDs and optically pumped magnetometers, the BP-based SOM operates at room temperature and nanoscale dimensions with comparable sensitivity, eliminating the need for cryogenics or vapor cells. Power consumption remains under 1 microwatt, far below conventional technologies. This work establishes BP metasurface integration as a promising platform for low-power, miniaturized, and high-performance magnetic field sensing.

Title: Measurement induced scrambling and emergent symmetries in random circuits
Authors: Haifeng Tang, Hong-Yi Wang, Zhong Wang, Xiao-Liang Qi
Abstract: Quantum entanglement is affected by unitary evolution, which spreads the entanglement through the whole system, and also by measurements, which usually tends to disentangle subsystems from the rest. Their competition has been known to result in the measurement-induced phase transition. But more intriguingly, measurement alone has the ability to drive a system into different entanglement phases. In this work, we map the entanglement evolution under unitaries and/or measurements into a classical spin problem. This framework is used to understand a myriad of random circuit models analytically, including measurement-induced and measurement-only transitions. Regarding many-body joint measurements, a lower bound of measurement range that is necessary for a global scrambled phase is derived. Moreover, emergent continuous symmetries (U(1) or SU(2)) are discovered in some random measurement models in the large-$d$ (qudit dimension) limit. The emergent continuous symmetry allows a variety of spin dynamics phenomena to find their counterparts in random circuit models.

Title: Plasmon Polaritons in Disordered Nanoparticle Assemblies
Authors: Tanay Paul, Allison M. Green, Delia J. Milliron, Thomas M. Truskett
Abstract: Multilayer assemblies of metal nanoparticles can act as photonic structures, where collective plasmon resonances hybridize with cavity modes to create plasmon-polariton states. For sufficiently strong coupling, plasmon polaritons qualitatively alter the optical properties of light-matter systems, with applications ranging from sensing to solar energy. However, results from experimental studies have raised questions about the role of nanoparticle structural disorder in plasmon-polariton formation and light-matter coupling in plasmonic assemblies. Understanding how disorder affects optical properties has practical implications since methods for assembling low-defect nanoparticle superlattices are slow and scale poorly. Modeling realistic disorder requires large system sizes, which is challenging using conventional electromagnetic simulations. We employ Brownian dynamics simulations to construct large-scale nanoparticle multilayers with controlled structural order. We investigate their optical response using a superposition T-matrix method with 2-D periodic boundary conditions. We find that while structural disorder broadens the polaritonic stop band and the near-field hot-spot distribution, the polariton dispersion and coupling strength remain unaltered. To understand effects of nanoparticle composition, we consider assemblies with model particles mimicking gold or tin-doped indium oxide (ITO) nanocrystals. Losses due to higher damping in ITO nanocrystals prevent their assemblies from achieving the deep strong coupling of gold nanoparticle multilayers, although the former still exhibit ultrastrong coupling. We demonstrate that while computationally efficient mutual polarization method calculations employing the quasistatic approximation modestly overestimate the strength of the collective plasmon, they reproduce the polariton dispersion relations determined by electrodynamic simulations.

Title: Quantifying Gibbs measures of disordered crystals up to the solid-liquid phase transition
Authors: Vladislav Efremkin, Julian Heske, Thomas D. Kühne, Emil Prodan
Abstract: Quantifying the configuration space and the Gibbs measure of thermally disordered condensed matter systems has been a long standing problem. The challenge is to avoid the Gibbs paradox, which forbids any ordering or labeling of the atoms. Our key observation is that the lattice of a thermally disordered condensed matter system, in either solid, liquid or gas phase, can be fully reconstructed from the Voronoi cells of the atoms alone, even if these Voronoi cells are disassembled and randomly scrambled. In the example of the crystalline phase of silicon, the statistics of the Voronoi cells reveals the existence of four, and only four, large facets that are present with probability one for all temperatures up to the solid-liquid melting line. These four largest facets, which separate nearest-neighboring atoms, can be also be used to reconstruct the lattice of the crystal. Hence, their collection supplies the optimal representation of the configuration of the crystal. We conjecture that the existence of Voronoi facets that, despite their large thermal fluctuations, survive with probability one up to the melting temperature, is the fundamental signature of the crystalline solid phase and therefore key to quantifying the Gibbs measure over the entire solid phase.

Title: TasVisAn and InsPy -- Python Packages for Triple-Axis Spectrometer Data Visualization, Analysis, Instrument Resolution Calculation, and Convolution
Authors: Guochu Deng
Abstract: Experimental data collected from a triple-axis spectrometer (TAS) are typically analysed by considering the instrument resolution, as the resolution of a TAS instrument is often complex and significantly influences the measured results. Two Python packages, TasVisAn and InsPy, have been developed to visualize and analyse data from TAS instruments - particularly from the cold-neutron TAS Sika and the thermal-neutron TAS Taipan at the Australian Centre for Neutron Scattering. TasVisAn offers a range of functions, including data importing, reduction, plotting, contour mapping, convolution fitting, and more, for data collected on TAS instruments, especially on Sika and Taipan. It also supports data reduction of the current trendy multi-analyser and multiplexing TAS instruments, including the multiplexing mode of Sika. Besides, it includes scan simulation and batch file validation tools for both Taipan and Sika, assisting users in designing and planning experiments in advance. InsPy is a general-purpose Python package designed to calculate the four-dimensional (4D) instrument resolution in momentum-energy space for any TAS instrument. Combined with InsPy, TasVisAn supports both instrument resolution calculation and resolution-convoluted data fitting. Its flexible external data import feature further allows TasVisAn to be adapted for the visualization and convolution analysis of inelastic neutron scattering data across various TAS instruments.

Title: Correlated Error Bursts in a Gap-Engineered Superconducting Qubit Array

Ioffe, Juan Atalaya, Alexander Bilmes, John Mark Kreikebaum, Andreas Bengtsson, Paul Klimov, Matthew Neeley, Wojciech Mruczkiewicz, Kevin Miao, Igor L. Aleiner, Julian Kelly, Yu Chen, Kevin Satzinger, Alex Opremcak
Abstract: One of the roadblocks towards the implementation of a fault-tolerant superconducting quantum processor is impacts of ionizing radiation with the qubit substrate. Such impacts temporarily elevate the density of quasiparticles (QPs) across the device, leading to correlated qubit error bursts. The most damaging errors, $T_1$ errors, stem from QP tunneling across the qubit Josephson junctions (JJs). Recently, we demonstrated that this type of error can be strongly suppressed by engineering the profile of superconducting gap at the JJs in a way that prevents QP tunneling. In this work, we identify a new type of impact-induced correlated error that persists in the presence of gap engineering. We observe that impacts shift the frequencies of the affected qubits, and thus lead to correlated phase errors. The frequency shifts are systematically negative, reach values up to $3\,{\rm MHz}$, and last for $\sim 1\,{\rm ms}$. We provide evidence that the shifts originate from QP-qubit interactions in the JJ region. Further, we demonstrate that the shift-induced phase errors can be detrimental to the performance of quantum error correction protocols.

Title: Rényi and Shannon mutual information in critical and decohered critical system
Authors: Yoshihito Kuno, Takahiro Orito, Ikuo Ichinose
Abstract: We investigate a critical many-body system by introducing a Rényi generalized mutual information, connecting between Rényi mutual information and Rényi Shannon mutual information. This Rényi generalized mutual information can offer more experimentally accessible alternative than the conventional entanglement entropy. As a critical many-body state, we focus on the critical transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) described by the Ising conformal field theory (CFT). We show that even if we modify the non-selective projective measurement assumed in Rényi Shannon mutual information by replacing the measurement into decoherence by environment, the Rényi generalized Shannon mutual information maintains the CFT properties such as subsystem CFT scaling law and its central charge observed through both the conventional Rényi Shannon mutual information and Rényi mutual information. Furthermore, we apply a local decoherence to the critical ground state of the TFIM and numerically observe the Rényi generalized mutual information by changing the parameter controlling environment effect (corresponding to the strength of measurement) in the Rényi generalized mutual information and the strength of the decoherence to which the entire system subjects. We find that Rényi-$2$ type central charge connected to the central charge is fairly robust, indicating the strong robustness of the Ising CFT properties against local decoherence by environment.

Title: Xenophobia based on a few attributes can impede society's cohesiveness
Authors: Alejandro Castro, Tuan Minh Pham, Ernesto Ortega, David Machado
Abstract: Xenophobic interactions play a role as important as homophilic ones in shaping many dynamical processes on social networks, such as opinion formation, social balance, or epidemic spreading. In this paper, we use belief propagation and Monte Carlo simulations on tree-like signed graphs to predict that a sufficient propensity to xenophobia can impede a consensus that would otherwise emerge via a phase transition. As the strength of xenophobic interactions and the rationality of individuals with respect to social stress decrease, this transition changes from continuous to discontinuous, with a strong dependence on the initial conditions. The size of the parameter region where consensus can be reached from any initial condition decays as a power-law function of the number of discussed topics.

Title: Virtual failure assessment diagrams for hydrogen transmission pipelines
Authors: J. Wijnen, J. Parker, M. Gagliano, E. Martínez-Pañeda
Abstract: We combine state-of-the-art thermo-metallurgical welding process modelling with coupled diffusion-elastic-plastic phase field fracture simulations to predict the failure states of hydrogen transport pipelines. This enables quantitatively resolving residual stress states and the role of brittle, hard regions of the weld such as the heat affected zone (HAZ). Failure pressures can be efficiently quantified as a function of asset state (existing defects), materials and weld procedures adopted, and hydrogen purity. Importantly, simulations spanning numerous relevant conditions (defect size and orientations) are used to build \emph{Virtual} Failure Assessment Diagrams (FADs), enabling a straightforward uptake of this mechanistic approach in fitness-for-service assessment. Model predictions are in very good agreement with FAD approaches from the standards but show that the latter are not conservative when resolving the heterogeneous nature of the weld microstructure. Appropriate, \emph{mechanistic} FAD safety factors are established that account for the role of residual stresses and hard, brittle weld regions.

Title: Emergent deterministic entanglement dynamics in monitored infinite-range bosonic systems
Authors: Zejian Li, Anna Delmonte, Rosario Fazio
Abstract: We study monitored quantum dynamics of infinite-range interacting bosonic systems in the thermodynamic limit. We show that under semiclassical assumptions, the quantum fluctuations along single monitored trajectories adopt a deterministic limit for both quantum-jump and state-diffusion unravelings, and can be exactly solved. In particular, the hierarchical structure of the equations of motion explains the coincidence of entanglement phase transitions and dissipative phase transitions found in previous finite-size numerical studies. We illustrate the findings on a Bose-Hubbard dimer and a collective spin system.

Title: Topological crystals and soliton lattices in a Gross-Neveu model with Hilbert-space fragmentation
Authors: Sergio Cerezo-Roquebrún, Simon Hands, Alejandro Bermudez
Abstract: We explore the finite-density phase diagram of the single-flavour Gross-Neveu-Wilson (GNW) model using matrix product state (MPS) simulations. At zero temperature and along the symmetry line of the phase diagram, we find a sequence of inhomogeneous ground states that arise through a real-space version of the mechanism of Hilbert-space fragmentation. For weak interactions, doping the symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase of the GNW model leads to localized charges or holes at periodic arrangements of immobile topological defects separating the fragmented subchains: a topological crystal. Increasing the interactions, we observe a transition into a parity-broken phase with a pseudoscalar condensate displaying a modulated periodic pattern. This soliton lattice is a sequence of topological charges corresponding to anti-kinks, which also bind the doped fermions at their respective centers. Out of this symmetry line, we show that quasi-spiral profiles appear with a characteristic wavevector set by the density $k = 2{\pi}{\rho}$, providing non-perturbative evidence for chiral spirals beyond the large-N limit. These results demonstrate that various exotic inhomogeneous phases can arise in lattice field theories, and motivate the use of quantum simulators to confirm such QCD-inspired phenomena in future experiments.

Title: Structure and dynamics of finite three-dimensional Yukawa clusters in complex plasmas : Newtonian versus Langevin Dynamics
Authors: Hirakjyoti Sarma, Nilakshi Das
Abstract: The structure and dynamics of a harmonically confined three dimensional finite dust cluster are investigated via both Langevin Dynamics (LD) and frictionless Molecular Dynamics (fMD) simulation. The static structure of the system is analyzed through the Radial Distribution Function, Center-two-particle correlation function(C2P) and angular correlation function. The intra-shell angular correlation, Radial Distribution Function and C2P remains largely unaffected by the dynamics employed. However, the inter-shell angular correlation exhibits sharp peaks at irregular angular intervals in fMD which are not seen in LD indicating strongly correlated motion of the two spherical shells in the cluster in fMD. The single particle dynamics of the cluster is characterized by the Van - Hove self autocorrelation function and Mean Squared Displacement (MSD). Notably, the Van - Hove autocorrelation function in fMD simulations exhibits narrower width and higher peak height as compared to the LD simulations, suggesting greater particle mobility in LD. Trajectory analysis reveals a rotational motion of the particles about a common axis in fMD which disappears with progressively increasing friction coefficient. We show that the disappearance of rotational motion with the introduction of neutral friction in the dynamics is due to the much faster relaxation of the interparticle distance as well as interparticle angular separation in LD as compared to fMD.

Title: Shaping non-reciprocal caustic spin-wave beams
Authors: Dinesh Wagle, Daniel Stoeffler, Loic Temdie, Mojtaba Taghipour Kaffash, Vincent Castel, H. Majjad, R. Bernard, Yves Henry, Matthieu Bailleul, M. Benjamin Jungfleisch, Vincent Vlaminck
Abstract: A caustic is a mathematical concept describing the beam formation when the beam envelope is reflected or refracted by a manifold. While caustics are common in a wide range of physical systems, caustics typically exhibit a reciprocal wave propagation and are challenging to control. Here, we utilize the highly anisotropic dispersion and inherent non-reciprocity of a magnonic system to shape non-reciprocal emission of caustic-like spin wave beams in an extended 200 nm thick yttrium iron garnet (YIG) film from a nano-constricted rf waveguide. We introduce a near-field diffraction model to study spin-wave beamforming in homogeneous in-plane magnetized thin films, and reveal the propagation of non-reciprocal spin-wave beams directly emitted from the nanoconstriction by spatially resolved micro-focused Brillouin light spectroscopy (BLS). The experimental results agree well with both micromagnetic simulation, and the near-field diffraction model. The proposed method can be readily implemented to study spin-wave interference at the sub-micron scale, which is central to the development of wave-based computing applications and magnonic devices.

Title: Atomic and bond polarization causing strong screening of short-range Coulomb interactions and its effect in cuprate superconductors
Authors: Nassim Derriche, George Sawatzky
Abstract: We present a novel and efficient real space, semiclassical model of electric polarization with general applicability to any system in which screening plays an important role. This model includes the effects of both atomic and bond polarizabilities, the latter originating from the modification of local bond charge transfer energies induced by polarizing charges. The nonlinear interference of multiple polarization clouds and the emergence of local field effects are highlighted as key phenomena highly influencing the short-range screening of the Coulomb interaction. As a representative system to showcase this model, the screened interaction between doped holes in the CuO$_2$ planes of cuprate high-temperature superconductors is investigated. This leads to the emergence of striking direction-dependent short-range minima in their Coulomb repulsion, which can strongly reduce the need for retardation effects and allow for an enhancement of the attractive interaction resulting from the exchange of bosons between two electrons or holes. This in turn enhances T$_C$, shortens the Cooper pair coherence length and supports the materialization of the pseudogap phase anisotropy observed in many high-T$_C$ superconductors.

Title: Lattice-tunable substituted iron garnets for low-temperature magnonics
Authors: William Legrand, Yana Kemna, Stefan Schären, Hanchen Wang, Davit Petrosyan, Luise Holder, Richard Schlitz, Myriam H. Aguirre, Michaela Lammel, Pietro Gambardella
Abstract: The synthesis of nm-thick epitaxial films of iron garnets by physical vapor deposition has opened up exciting opportunities for the on-chip generation and processing of microwave signals encoded in magnons. However, iron garnet thin films suffer from demanding lattice-matching and stoichiometry requirements. Here a new approach to their synthesis is developed, enabling a precise and continuous tuning of iron garnet compositions based on the co-sputtering of binary oxides. By substituting a controlled proportion of iron with additional yttrium, Y$_{3}$(Y$_{x}$Fe$_{5-x}$)O$_{12}$ films of high crystalline quality are obtained, combining a widely tunable lattice parameter and excellent magnetization dynamics. This enables iron garnet thin films suited for cryogenic applications, which have long remained impractical due to microwave losses caused by paramagnetic garnet substrates. Low-temperature ferromagnetic resonance confirms the elimination of substrate paramagnetic losses for Y$_{3}$(Y$_{x}$Fe$_{5-x}$)O$_{12}$ films lattice-matched to Y$_{3}$Sc$_{2}$Ga$_{3}$O$_{12}$ (YSGG), a diamagnetic substrate. The Y$_{3}$(Y$_{x}$Fe$_{5-x}$)O$_{12}$ system can be matched to other substrates such as (Gd,Y)$_{3}$Sc$_{2}$Ga$_{3}$O$_{12}$. Bi-substituted films of (Bi$_{0.8}$Y$_{2.2}$)Fe$_{5}$O$_{12}$ also have ideal lattice matching to YSGG, demonstrating the versatility of this approach. This opens unprecedented options for cation substitutions in iron garnet films, offering a promising avenue to new properties and quantum magnonic devices operating in low-temperature environments.

Title: Towards a micromechanical qubit based on quantized oscillations in superfluid helium
Authors: Priya Sharma, Jens Koch, Eran Ginossar
Abstract: Superconducting circuits can exhibit quantized energy levels and long coherence times. Harnessing the anharmonicity offered by Josephson junctions, such circuits have been successfully employed as qubits, quantum limited amplifiers and sensors. Here, we consider superfluidity as the charge-neutral analogue of superconductivity. Both dissipationless mass flow and Josephson tunneling have been demonstrated in superfluid helium. We propose a quantum device, consisting of a superfluid weak link and a mechanical element. The superfluid motion in this device is quantized. The resulting discrete energy levels are resolvable at millikelvin temperatures essential to maintaining the superfluid state. Appropriate device engineering can yield the necessary nonlinearity to realize qubit functionality. Hence, this device can potentially operate as a charge-neutral, superfluid quantum bit with micron-sized dimensions and millisecond scale coherence time. We show that this quantum regime is within reach for a range of device designs.

Title: Flat bands in tight-binding lattices with anisotropic potentials
Authors: Arindam Mallick, Alexei Andreanov
Abstract: We consider tight-binding models on Bravais lattices with anisotropic onsite potentials that vary along a given direction and are constant along the transverse one. Inspired by our previous work on flat bands in anti-\(\mathcal{PT}\) symmetric Hamiltonians [Mallick et al., Phys.~Rev.~A 105, L021305 (2022)], we construct an anti-\(\mathcal{PT}\) symmetric Hamiltonians with an \(E=0\) flat band by tuning the hoppings and the shapes of potentials. This construction is illustrated for the square lattice with bounded and unbounded potentials. Unlike flat bands in short-ranged translationally invariant Hamiltonians, we conjecture that the considered \(E=0\) flat bands do not host compact localized states. Instead the flat-band eigenstates exhibit a localization transition along the potential direction upon increasing the potential strength for bounded potentials. For unbounded potentials flat-band eigenstates are always localized irrespective of the potential strength.

Title: Monte Carlo Study of Critical Fermi Surface with Spatially Disordered Interactions
Authors: Tu Hong, Xiao Yan Xu
Abstract: Non-Fermi liquids are an important topic in condensed matter physics, as their characteristics challenge the framework of traditional Fermi liquid theory and reveal the complex behavior of electrons in strongly interacting systems. Despite some progress in this field, linear-in-temperature resistivity and inverse-in-frequency tail of optical conductivity are unresolved issues in non-Fermi liquids. Both the experimentally observed smeared region and the theoretically predicted marginal Fermi liquid suggest that spatial disorder seems to be an important driver of these phenomena. By performing large-scale determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) simulations in the ferromagnetic spin-fermion model at finite $N$, beyond the large-$N$ used in previous theoretical work, we investigated the role of spatial disorder in the critical Fermi surface (FS) of this model. We proposed a corrected theory of our system, which is based on a modified Eliashberg theory and a universal theory of strange metals. This theory agrees well with the data obtained from DQMC, particularly in capturing the $\omega \ln \omega$ type self-energy characteristic of marginal Fermi liquid behavior, though temperature limitations prevent us from observing the linear-in-temperature scattering rate. Our findings offer strong and unbiased validation of the universal theory of strange metals, broaden the applicability of the modified Eliashberg theory, and provide insights for numerically searching for marginal Fermi liquid and linear-in-temperature resistivity.

Title: Does the Meissner effect violate the second law of thermodynamics? Comment on "The Law of Entropy Increase and the Meissner Effect" by A. Nikulov
Authors: J. E. Hirsch
Abstract: In Entropy 24, 83 (2022) [1], titled "The Law of Entropy Increase and the Meissner Effect", A. Nikulov claims that the Meissner effect exhibited by type I superconductors violates the second law of thermodynamics. Contrary to this claim, I show that the Meissner effect is consistent with the second law of thermodynamics provided that a mechanism exists for the supercurrent to start and stop without generation of Joule heat. The theory of hole superconductivity provides such a mechanism, the conventional theory of superconductivity does not. It requires the existence of hole carriers in the normal state of the system.

Title: Dynamic Competition Between Hubbard and Superexchange Interactions Selectively Localizes Electrons and Holes Through Polarons
Authors: Jocelyn L. Mendes, Hyun Jun Shin, Jae Yeon Seo, Nara Lee, Young Jai Choi, Joel B. Varley, Scott K. Cushing
Abstract: Controlling the effects of photoexcited polarons in transition metal oxides can enable the long timescale charge separation necessary for renewable energy applications as well as controlling new quantum phases through dynamically tunable electron-phonon coupling. In previously studied transition metal oxides, polaron formation is facilitated by a photoexcited ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT). When the polaron is formed, oxygen atoms move away from iron centers, which increases carrier localization at the metal center and decreases charge hopping. Studies of yttrium iron garnet and erbium iron oxide have suggested that strong electron and spin correlations can modulate photoexcited polaron formation. To understand the interplay between strong spin and electronic correlations in highly polar materials, we studied gadolinium iron oxide (GdFeO3), which selectively forms photoexcited polarons through an Fe-O-Fe superexchange inter-action. Excitation-wavelength-dependent transient extreme ultraviolet (XUV) spectroscopy selectively excites LMCT and metal-to-metal charge transfer transitions (MMCT). The LMCT transition suppresses photoexcited polaron formation due to the balance between superexchange and Hubbard interactions, while MMCT transitions result in photoexcited polaron formation within 250+/-40 fs. Ab initio theory demonstrates that electron and hole polarons localize on iron centers following MMCT. In addition to understanding how strong electronic and spin correlations can control strong electron-phonon coupling, these experiments separately measure electron and hole polaron interactions on neighboring metal centers for the first time, providing insight into a large range of charge-transfer and Mott-Hubbard insulators.

Title: Anyon polarons as a window into competing phases of the Kitaev honeycomb model under a Zeeman field
Authors: Chuan Chen, Inti Sodemann Villadiego
Abstract: We compute the spectra of anyon quasiparticles in all three super-selection sectors of the Kitaev model (i.e., visons, fermions and bosons), perturbed by a Zeeman field away from its exactly solvable limit, to gain insights on the competition of its non-abelian spin-liquid with other nearby phases, such as the mysterious intermediate state observed in the antiferromagnetic model. Both for the ferro- and antiferro-magnetic models we find that the fermions and visons become gapless at nearly identical critical Zeeman couplings. In the ferromagnetic model this is consistent with a direct transition into a polarized state. In the anti-ferromagnetic model this implies that previous theories of the intermediate phase viewed as a spin liquid with a different fermion Chern number are inadequate, as they presume that the vison gap does not close. In the antiferromagnetic model we also find that a bosonic quasiparticle becomes gapless at nearly the same critical field as the fermions and visons. This boson carries the quantum numbers of an anti-ferromagnetic order parameter, suggesting that the intermediate phase has spontaneously broken symmetry with this order.

Title: Superconducting Proximity Effect in Two-Dimensional Hole Gases
Authors: Serafim S. Babkin, Benjamin Joecker, Karsten Flensberg, Maksym Serbyn, Jeroen Danon
Abstract: Technology involving hybrid superconductor-semiconductor materials is a promising avenue for engineering quantum devices for information storage, manipulation, and transmission. Proximity-induced superconducting correlations are an essential part of such devices. While the proximity effect in the conduction band of common semiconductors is well understood, its manifestation in confined hole gases, realized for instance in germanium, is an active area of research. Lower-dimensional hole-based systems, particularly in germanium, are emerging as an attractive platform for a variety of solid-state quantum devices, due to their combination of efficient spin and charge control and long coherence times. The recent experimental realization of the proximity effect in germanium thus calls for a theoretical description that is tailored to hole gases. In this work, we propose a simple model to describe proximity-induced superconductivity in two-dimensional hole gases, incorporating both the heavy-hole (HH) and light-hole (LH) bands. We start from the Luttinger-Kohn model, introduce three parameters that characterize hopping across the superconductor-semiconductor interface, and derive explicit intraband and interband effective pairing terms for the HH and LH bands. Unlike previous approaches, our theory provides a quantitative relationship between induced pairings and interface properties. Restricting our general model to an experimentally relevant case where only the HH band crosses the chemical potential, we predict the coexistence of $s$-wave and $d$-wave singlet pairings, along with triplet-type pairings, and modified Zeeman and Rashba spin-orbit couplings. Our results thus present a starting point for theoretical modeling of quantum devices based on proximitized hole gases, fueling further progress in quantum technology.

Title: Polaronic dressing of bound states
Authors: Luis A. Peña Ardila, Arturo Camacho-Guardian
Abstract: Polarons have emerged as a powerful concept across many-fields in physics to study an impurity coupled to a quantum bath. The interplay between impurity physics and the formation of composite objects remains a relevant problem to understand how few- and many-body states are robust towards complex environments and polaron physics. In most cases, impurities are point-like objects. The question we address here is how quasiparticle properties are affected when impurities possess an internal structure. The simplest yet fundamental structure for the impurity is a dimer state. Here, we investigate the polaronic properties of a dimer dressed by the elementary excitations of a bosonic bath. We solve the two-body impurity-impurity problem to determine the position and broadening of the bound state and consider the polaron dressing using a field-theory approach. We demonstrate the emergence of different dressed dimer regimes, where polaron dressing drives a dimer from a well-defined to an ill-defined bound state.

Abstract: We present experimental wear data for polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) sliding on tile, sandpaper, and polished steel surfaces, as well as for soda-lime, borosilicate, and quartz glass sliding on sandpaper. The results are compared with a recently developed theory \cite{ToBe} of sliding wear based on crack propagation (fatigue), originally formulated for elastic contact and here extended to include plasticity. The elastoplastic wear model predicts wear rates that agree reasonably well with the experimental results for PMMA and soda-lime glass. However, deviations observed for quartz suggest that material-specific deformation mechanisms, particularly the differences between crystalline and amorphous structures, may need to be considered for accurate wear predictions across different materials. In addition, the model reveals a non-monotonic dependence of the wear rate on the penetration hardness $\sigma_{\rm P}$. Thus, for plastically soft material, the wear rate increases with increasing $\sigma_{\rm P}$, while for hard materials, it decreases. This contrasts with Archard's wear law, where the wear rate decreases monotonically with increasing $\sigma_{\rm P}$.

Title: New models of clean and hydrogenated amorphous silicon surfaces
Authors: Kishor Nepal, Aashish Gautam, Chinonso Ugwumadu, David Drabold
Abstract: We present new atomistic models of amorphous silicon (a-Si) and hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) surfaces. The a-Si model included 4096 atoms and was obtained using local orbital density functional theory. By analyzing a slab model (periodic in two dimensions with a slab about 44 Å thick), we observed a strong correlation between surface structure and surface charge density, which might be compared to STM experiments. Hydrogen atoms added near the under-coordinated surface atoms passivate dangling bonds and induce structural rearrangements. We analyze the electronic structure, including the localization of the states, and note resonant mixing between bulk and surface defect structures. We also compute the classical normal modes of the hydrogenated a-Si and compare them to experiments where possible. Our work is a step toward understanding the meaning of ``surface reconstruction" for a noncrystalline material.

Abstract: We present a study of low-concentration Zn (II) impurities in L-Alanine Single Crystal (ZNLA) employing resonant Raman scattering and optical absorption spectroscopy. By analyzing the relative integrated intensity of the selective vibrational modes, we observe a resonant enhancement of Raman-active modes near the UV absorption band, associated with vibrations of the amino and carboxyl groups in ZNLA. These findings suggest that zinc cations occupy an interstitial position coordinated by amino and carboxyl groups. Also, ZNLA single crystal shows a strong antiresonance behavior for some modes associated with amino and carboxyl groups. The antiresonance model in the cross-section allowed the estimation of the bandgap to be 3.8 eV, which perfectly agrees with the direct bandgap obtained from the absorption spectrum (3.75 eV). Finally, our approach proves to be useful for detecting interactions between transition metal ion impurities and intramolecular structures in other transition metal-doped organic amino acid systems.

Title: Theory of fractional corner charges in cylindrical crystal shapes
Authors: Hidetoshi Wada, Tiantian Zhang, Shuichi Murakami
Abstract: Recent studies showed that topologically trivial insulators may have fractionally quantized corner charges due to the topological invariant called a filling anomaly. Such crystal shapes in three dimensions are restricted to vertex-transitive polyhedra, which are classified into spherical and cylindrical families. The previous works derived formulas of the fractional corner charge for the spherical family, which corresponds to the tetrahedral and cubic space groups (SGs). In this study, we derive all the corner charge formulas for the cylindrical family, which corresponds to the orthorhombic, tetragonal, hexagonal, and trigonal crystal shapes. We show that all the real-space formulas of the filling anomaly for the cylindrical SGs are universally determined by the total charges at the Wyckoff position (WP) 1a. Moreover, we derive the k-space formulas of the corner charge for the cylindrical cases with time-reversal symmetry (TRS). From our results, we also show that CsLi$_{2}$Cl_{3}, KN_{3}, and Li_{3}N are candidate materials with a quantized corner charge by using the ab initio calculations. Together with our previous work, we exhaust corner charge formulas for all the SGs and crystal shapes having quantized corner charges.

Title: Theory of superconducting proximity effect in hole-based hybrid semiconductor-superconductor devices
Authors: D. Michel Pino, Rubén Seoane-Souto, Maria José Calderón, Ramón Aguado, José Carlos Abadillo-Uriel
Abstract: Hybrid superconductor-semiconductor systems have received a great deal of attention in the last few years because of their potential for quantum engineering, including novel qubits and topological devices. The proximity effect, the process by which the semiconductor inherits superconducting correlations, is an essential physical mechanism of such hybrids. Recent experiments have demonstrated the proximity effect in hole-based semiconductors, but, in contrast to electrons, the precise mechanism by which the hole bands acquire superconducting correlations remains an open question. In addition, hole spins exhibit a complex strong spin-orbit interaction, with largely anisotropic responses to electric and magnetic fields, further motivating the importance of understanding the interplay between such effects and the proximity effect. In this work, we analyze this physics with focus on germanium-based two-dimensional gases. Specifically, we develop an effective theory supported by full numerics, allowing us to extract various analytical expressions and predict different types of superconducting correlations including non-standard forms of singlet and triplet pairing mechanisms with non-trivial momentum dependence; as well as different Zeeman and Rashba spin-orbit contributions. This, together with their precise dependence on electric and magnetic fields, allows us to make specific experimental predictions, including the emergence of f-type superconductivity, Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces, and gapless regimes caused by large in-plane magnetic fields.

Title: Reentrant topological phases and spin density wave induced by 1D moiré potentials
Authors: Guo-Qing Zhang, Ling-Zhi Tang, L. F. Quezada, Shi-Hai Dong, Dan-Wei Zhang
Abstract: Recent studies of 2D moiré materials have opened opportunities for advancing condensed matter physics. However, the effect of 1D moiré potentials on topological and correlated phases remains largely unexplored. Here we reveal a sequence of trivial-to-topological transitions and periodic-moiré-spin density waves induced by the 1D commensurate moiré potentials for spin-1/2 fermionic atoms. Such reentrant topology from a trivial phase is absent without the moiré potential and can be understood as the renormalization of topological parameters by the moiré strength. We then unveil the critical exponent and localization properties of the single-particle eigenstates. The periodic spin density wave of many-body ground states is contributed by the moiré potential, and is enhanced by on-site interactions but suppressed by nearest-neighbor interactions. Our results enrich the topological physics with multiple transitions and spin-density orders in 1D moiré systems, and the realization of the proposed model is promising in near-future ultracold atom setups.

Title: Theory of Magnon Purcell Effect in Cavity Magnonic System
Authors: G. Zhao, Y. Wang, X.-F. Qian
Abstract: We conduct a systematic analysis of cavity effects on the decay dynamics of an open magnonic system. The Purcell effect on the magnon oscillator decay is thoroughly examined for both driven and non-driven scenarios. Analytical conditions are determined to distinguish between strong and weak coupling regimes, corresponding to oscillatory and pure decay behaviors respectively. Additionally, our theory also predicts the decay of the photon mode within the cavity-magnonic open system, demonstrating excellent agreement with existing experimental data. Our findings and methodologies can provide valuable insights for advancing research in cavity magnonic quantum control, quantum information processing, and the development of magnonic quantum devices.

Title: Theory of Irreversibility in Quantum Many-Body Systems
Authors: Takato Yoshimura, Lucas Sá
Abstract: We address the longstanding challenge in quantum many-body theory of reconciling unitary dynamics with irreversible relaxation. In classical chaos, the unitary evolution operator develops Ruelle-Pollicott (RP) resonances inside the unit circle in the continuum limit, leading to mixing. In the semiclassical limit, chaotic single-particle quantum systems relax with the same RP resonances. In contrast, the theory of quantum many-body RP resonances and their link to irreversibility remain underdeveloped. Here, we relate the spectral form factor to the sum of autocorrelation functions and, in generic many-body lattice systems without conservation laws, argue that all quantum many-body RP resonances converge inside the unit disk, highlighting the role of nonunitary and the thermodynamic limit. While we conjecture this picture to be general, we analytically prove the emergence of irreversibility in the random phase model (RPM), a paradigmatic Floquet quantum circuit model, in the limit of large local Hilbert space dimension. To this end, we couple it to local environments and compute the exact time evolution of autocorrelation functions, the dissipative form factor, and out-of-time-order correlation functions (OTOCs). Although valid for any dissipation strength, we then focus on weak dissipation to clarify the origin of irreversibility in unitary systems. When the dissipationless limit is taken after the thermodynamic limit, the unitary quantum map develops an infinite tower of decaying RP resonances -- chaotic systems display so-called anomalous relaxation. We also show that the OTOC in the RPM can undergo a two-stage relaxation and that during the second stage, the approach to the stationary value is again controlled by the leading RP resonance.

Title: Towards understanding structure-function relationships in random fiber networks
Authors: Peerasait Prachaseree, Emma Lejeune
Abstract: Random fiber networks form the structural foundation of numerous biological tissues and engineered materials. From a mechanics perspective, understanding the structure-function relationships of random fiber networks is particularly interesting because when external force is applied to these networks, only a small subset of fibers will actually carry the majority of the load. Specifically, these load-bearing fibers propagate through the network to form load paths, also called force chains. However, the relationship between fiber network geometric structure, force chains, and the overall mechanical behavior of random fiber network structures remains poorly understood. To this end, we implement a finite element model of random fiber networks with geometrically exact beam elements, and use this model to explore random fiber network mechanical behavior. Our focus is twofold. First, we explore the mechanical behavior of single fiber chains and random fiber networks. Second, we propose and validate an interpretable analytical approach to predicting fiber network mechanics from structural information alone. Key findings include insight into the critical strain-stiffening transition point for single fiber chains and fiber networks generated from a Voronoi diagram, and a connection between force chains and the distance-weighted graph shortest paths that arise by treating fiber networks as spatial graph structures. This work marks an important step towards mapping the structure-function relationships of random fiber networks undergoing large deformations. Additionally, with our code distributed under open-source licenses, we hope that future researchers can directly build on our work to address related problems beyond the scope defined here.

Sinnott, Vincent Crespi, Venkatraman Gopalan, Roman Engel-Herbert, John T. Heron, Jon-Paul Maria
Abstract: This manuscript presents a working model linking chemical disorder and transport properties in correlated-electron perovskites with high-entropy formulations and a framework to actively design them. We demonstrate this new learning in epitaxial Sr$x$(Ti,Cr,Nb,Mo,W)O$3$ thin films that exhibit exceptional crystalline fidelity despite a diverse chemical formulation where most B-site species are highly misfit with respect to valence and radius. X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy confirm a unique combination of chemical disorder and structural perfection in thick epitaxial layers. This combination produces significant electron correlation, low electrical resistivity, and an optical transparency window that surpasses that of constituent end-members, with a flattened frequency- and temperature-dependent response. We address the computational challenges of modeling such systems and investigate short-range ordering using cluster expansion. These results showcase that unusual d-metal combinations access an expanded property design space that is predictable using end-member characteristics -- though unavailable to them -- thus offering performance advances in optical, spintronic, and quantum devices.

Title: Metamaterials that learn to change shape
Authors: Yao Du, Jonas Veenstra, Ryan van Mastrigt, Corentin Coulais
Abstract: Learning to change shape is a fundamental strategy of adaptation and evolution of living organisms, from bacteria and cells to tissues and animals. Human-made materials can also exhibit advanced shape morphing capabilities, but lack the ability to learn. Here, we build metamaterials that can learn complex shape-changing responses using a contrastive learning scheme. By being shown examples of the target shape changes, our metamaterials are able to learn those shape changes by progressively updating internal learning degrees of freedom -- the local stiffnesses. Unlike traditional materials that are designed once and for all, our metamaterials have the ability to forget and learn new shape changes in sequence, to learn multiple shape changes that break reciprocity, and to learn multistable shape changes, which in turn allows them to perform reflex gripping actions and locomotion. Our findings establish metamaterials as an exciting platform for physical learning, which in turn opens avenues for the use of physical learning to design adaptive materials and robots.

Title: Pairing phase diagram for electron-doped cuprates in the square-lattice $t-U-V$ Hubbard model
Authors: Zhangkai Cao, Shuning Tan, Ji Liu, Xiaosen Yang, Tao Ying, Ho-Kin Tang, Cho-Tung Yip
Abstract: Motivated by significant discrepancies between experimental observations of electron-doped cuprates and numerical results of the Hubbard model, we investigate the role of nearest-neighbor (NN) electron interactions $V$ by studying the $t-U-V$ model on square lattices. Upon doping $\delta$= 0.153, by using constrained path quantum Monte Carlo (CPQMC) method, we find that NN electron attraction $V$ can notably drive an exotic $p$-wave spin-triplet pairing, while the NN electron repulsion $V$ will suppress the $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave ($d$-wave) pairing and triggers the $d_{xy}$-wave pairing. Especially in the intermediate coupling regime, as NN repulsion increases, the intensity of $d_{xy}$-wave pairing also increases, further suppressing the presence of $d$-wave pairing, which may help explain the notable suppression of $d$-wave pairing in electron-doped cuprate superconductors. Besides the pairing phase, we also find that the NN electron attraction $V$ has no significant effect on spin density wave (SDW) and charge density wave (CDW), but repulsion $V$ significantly enhanced CDW and suppressed SDW. Our study suggests the $t-U-V$ Hubbard model can serve as the minimal model to capture the essential physics of the electron-doped cuprates.

Title: Filtering Spin and Orbital Moment in Centrosymmetric Systems
Authors: Luciano Jacopo DOnofrio, Maria Teresa Mercaldo, Wojciech Brzezicki, Adam Klosinski, Federico Mazzola, Carmine Ortix, Mario Cuoco
Abstract: The control of spin and orbital angular momentum without relying on magnetic materials is commonly accomplished by breaking of inversion symmetry, which enables charge-to-spin conversion and spin selectivity in electron transfer processes occurring in chiral media. In contrast to this perspective, we show that orbital moment filtering can be accomplished in centrosymmetric systems: the electron states can be selectively manipulated allowing for the preferential transfer of electrons with a particular orbital momentum orientation. We find that orbital moment filtering is indeed efficiently controlled through orbital couplings that break both mirror and rotational symmetries. We provide the symmetry conditions required for the electron transmission to achieve orbital filtering and relate them to the orientation of the orbital moment. The presence of atomic spin-orbit interaction in the centrosymmetric transmission medium leads to the selective filtering of spin and orbital moments. Our findings allow to identify optimal regimes for having highly efficient simultaneous spin and orbital moment filtering.

Title: Enhanced magnetoelastic stress in disordered iron-gallium alloy thin films revealed by direct measurement
Authors: Adrián Begué, Maria Grazia Proietti, José Ignacio Arnaudas, Miguel Ciria
Abstract: The large magnetostriction in FeGa alloys is relevant for manifold applications, but for thin films, it can play a prominent role in controlling the strength of the magnetic anisotropy. Bulk samples show values depending on the extensive preparation procedure compendium, which is limited in its temperature range for high-quality thin-film synthesis. Here, we present a study of the magnetoelastic coupling coefficients $B_1$ and $B_2$ in epitaxial FeGa thin films below 50 nm deposited on the MgO(001) surface at 150 $^\circ$C by the cantilever method. Series of films with 22, 28, and 33 at. % Ga do not show thickness-dependent variations for $B_1$ and $B_2$, but $-B_1$ for the 22 at. % Ga composition is 10 MPa, roughly 2 times the bulk value and smaller than the bulk-like value of $-B_1$=12.1 MPa obtained for a film with 17 at. % Ga. This enhancement is correlated with the A2 crystal structure for the film rather than the coexistence with D0$_3$ or other ordered nanometric precipitates proposed for bulk samples. Synchrotron diffraction excludes the formation of long-range L6$_0$, or D0$_3$ precipitates in samples with (001)A2 peaks at concentrations around 25 at. % Ga, which implies partial chemical disorder. The analysis of extended x-ray absorption fine structure measurements points to a D0$_3$ local order with a residual number of Ga-Ga pairs. Considering that the substrate quenches the movable strain in the A2 phase described in dual-phase structures, our results point to the important role of the electronic structure of the iron atoms modified by the presence of Ga in the alloy. This effect enlarges $B_1$ in films with the A2 phase, stabilized using epitaxial growth.

Title: Theory of Photocurrent and High-Harmonic Generation with Chiral Fermions
Authors: Yuya Ominato, Masahito Mochizuki
Abstract: We theoretically discover possible dc-current induction and high-harmonic generation from photodriven chiral fermions in B20-type semimetals irradiated with circularly polarized light as nonlinear optical responses with several unconventional properties. First, we find multiple sign changes of the induced bulk dc photocurrent as a function of light parameters, which is ascribed to the nature of asymmetric photon-dressed bands in chiral systems. Moreover, we observe a parity-dependent directivity of high-harmonic generation where the odd- and even-order harmonics have intensities only in directions perpendicular and parallel to the polarization plane, respectively, which can be understood from dynamical symmetry of the present photodriven chiral systems.

Title: Glassy Behavior and Anomalous Transport in Chimney Ladder Crystals Induced by Low-Lying Optical Phonons
Authors: Srinivas V. Mandyam, Weicen Dong, Xiaoxian Yan, Binru Zhao, Elen Duverger-Nedellec, Junfa Lin, Tianlong Xia, Zhiying Zhao, Xi Chen, Jie Ma, Hui Xing, F. Malte Grosche, Matteo Baggioli
Abstract: Nowotny chimney ladder (NCL) crystals present physical properties in between the contrasting paradigms of ideal crystal and amorphous solid, making them promising candidates for thermoelectric applications due to their inherently low thermal conductivity. Here, we report an extensive experimental characterization of the thermodynamic and thermoelectric transport properties of a large class of NCL materials, focusing on the intermetallic compound Ru$_2$Sn$_{3}$. We show that the heat capacity of these NCL compounds exhibits a boson-peak-like glassy anomaly between $8$ K and $14$ K. By combining experimental measurements with density functional theory (DFT), we attribute its microscopic origin to extremely low-energy optical phonons that universally appear as a consequence of the chimney ladder sublattice structure. Additionally, the measured thermal conductivity and the thermoelectric response present distinct anomalous glass-like features that strongly correlate with the dynamics of the low-lying optical phonons revealed by DFT. Our work demonstrates that low-energy optical modes in ordered crystals can induce glassy behavior, outlining a pathway to design metallic materials with low thermal conductivity and unique thermoelectric properties without the need for disorder or strong electronic correlations.

Title: Flux-tunable parity-protected qubit based on a single full-shell nanowire Josephson junction
Authors: G. Giavaras, Ruben Seoane Souto, Maria Jose Calderon, Ramon Aguado
Abstract: Leveraging the higher harmonics content of the Josephson potential in a superconducting circuit offers a promising route in the search for new qubits with increased protection against decoherence. In this work, we demonstrate how the flux tunability of a hybrid semiconductor-superconductor Josephson junction based on a single full-shell nanowire enables this possibility. Near one flux quantum, $\Phi\approx \Phi_0=h/2e$, we find that the qubit system can be tuned from a gatemon regime to a parity-protected regime with qubit eigenstates localized in phase space in the $0$ and $\pi$ minima of the Josephson potential ($\cos 2\varphi_0$). Estimates of qubit coherence and relaxation times due to different noise sources are presented.

Title: Exact Chiral Symmetries of 3+1D Hamiltonian Lattice Fermions
Authors: Lei Gioia, Ryan Thorngren
Abstract: We construct Hamiltonian models on a 3+1d cubic lattice for a single Weyl fermion and for a single Weyl doublet protected by exact (as opposed to emergent) chiral symmetries. In the former, we find a not-on-site, non-compact chiral symmetry which can be viewed as a Hamiltonian analog of the Ginsparg-Wilson symmetry in Euclidean lattice models of Weyl fermions. In the latter, we combine an on-site $U(1)$ symmetry with a not-on-site $U(1)$ symmetry, which together generate the $SU(2)$ flavor symmetry of the doublet at low energies, while in the UV they generate an algebra known in integrability as the Onsager algebra. This latter model is in fact the celebrated magnetic Weyl semimetal which is known to have a chiral anomaly from the action of $U(1)$ and crystalline translation, that gives rise to an anomalous Hall response - however reinterpreted in our language, it has two exact $U(1)$ symmetries that gives rise to the global $SU(2)$ anomaly which protects the gaplessness even when crystalline translations are broken. We also construct an exact symmetry-protected single Dirac cone in 2+1d with the $U(1) \rtimes T$ parity anomaly. Our constructions evade both old and recently-proven no-go theorems by using not-on-siteness in a crucial way, showing our results are sharp.

Title: Stability of quasi-particle creation and multiband geometry in fractional Chern insulators under magnetic fields
Authors: Nozomi Higashino, Yasuhiro Tada
Abstract: We study creation of quasi-particles in fractional Chern insulators (FCI) under magnetic fields. We consider two representative models, the Kapit-Mueller model and the checkerboard model, which have distinct band properties in terms of the quantum geometry. The former satisfies the so-called ideal condition and well mimics the lowest Landau level, while the latter is not ideal for realization of FCI states. It is found within exact diagonalization that both quasi-holes and quasi-electrons are stably created by the magnetic fields in the Kapit-Mueller model. On the other hand, stability of the quasi-particle creation depends on directions of the magnetic field in the checkerboard model. Although the quasi-electron creation is stable under a magnetic field, the quasi-hole creation and the underlying FCI state are unstable for the opposite field direction, leading to a field-induced non-FCI state. We point out that this difference can be understood based on the multiband quantum geometry in the presence of the magnetic fields.

Title: Above-room-temperature multiferroic tunnel junction with altermagnetic CrSb
Authors: Long Zhang, Guangxin Ni, Junjie He, Guoying Gao
Abstract: Altermagnets with non-relativistic momentum-dependent spin splitting and compensated net magnetic moments have recently garnered significant interest in spintronics, particularly as pinning layers in magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs). However, room-temperature (RT) altermagnet-based MTJs with tunable tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) or electroresistance (TER) modulated by multiferroicity remains largely unexplored. Here, we propose an experimentally fabricable above-RT multiferroic MTJ, comprising an altermagnetic metal, ferroelectric barrier, and ferromagnetic metal-epitomized by a CrSb/In2Se3/Fe3GaTe2 heterostructure. Our calculations with first-principles and nonequilibrium Green function method indicate that the architecture enables magnetically switchable TER, electrically tunable TMR, and dual-mode controllable spin filtering. To disentangle the roles of ferroelectricity and the tunnel barrier, non-ferroelectric Sb2Se3 and a vacuum gap are exploited as control cases. Remarkably, the system achieves TMR up to 2308 %, TER of 707 %, and near-perfect spin filtering efficiency. Both TMR and TER are considerable for CrSb/In2Se3/Fe3GaTe2 with either Cr or Sb interface. These findings demonstrate the above-RT multiferroic altermagnet-based MTJs and highlight their exciting potential as a versatile platform for next-generation spin dynamics, magnetic-sensing and quantum logic nano-devices.

Title: Frustrated Frustration of Arrays with Four-Terminal Nb-Pt-Nb Josephson Junctions
Authors: Justus Teller, Christian Schäfer, Kristof Moors, Benjamin Bennemann, Matvey Lyatti, Florian Lentz, Detlev Grützmacher, Roman-Pascal Riwar, Thomas Schäpers
Abstract: We study the frustration pattern of a square lattice with in-situ fabricated Nb-Pt-Nb four-terminal Josephson junctions. The four-terminal geometry gives rise to a checker board pattern of alternating fluxes f, f' piercing the plaquettes, which stabilizes the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition even at irrational flux quanta per plaquette, due to an unequal repartition of integer flux sum f+f' into alternating plaquettes. This type of frustrated frustration manifests as a beating pattern of the dc resistance, with state configurations at the resistance dips gradually changing between the conventional zero-flux and half-flux states. Hence, the four-terminal Josephson junction array offers a promising platform to study previously unexplored flux and vortex configurations, and provides an estimate on the spatial expansion of the four-terminal Josephson junction central weak link area.

Title: Magnetic excitations of a trilayer antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model
Authors: Lan-Ye He, Xin-Man Ye, Dao-Xin Yao
Abstract: We investigate the squared sublattice magnetizations and magnetic excitations of a $S=1/2$ trilayer antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model with interlayer interaction $J_{\bot}$ and intralayer interaction $J_{//}$ by employing stochastic series expansion quantum Monte Carlo (SSE-QMC) and stochastic analytic continuation (SAC) methods. Compared with the bilayer model, the trilayer model has one inner layer and two outer layers. The change in its symmetry can lead to special magnetic excitations. Our study reveals that the maximum of the magnetization of the outer sublattice corresponds to smaller ratio parameter $g={J_{//}}/{J_{\bot}}$, a finding that is verified using the finite-size extrapolation. As $g$ decreases, the excitation spectra gradually evolve from a degenerate magnon mode with continua to low-energy and high-energy branches. Particularly when $g$ is small enough, like $0.02$, the high-energy spectrum further splits into characteristic doublon ($\approx J_{\bot}$) and quarton ($\approx 1.5 J_{\bot}$) spectral bands. Moreover, the accuracy of the magnetic excitations is confirmed through the SpinW software package and the dispersion relations derived through the linear spin wave theory. Our results provide an important reference for experiments, which can be directly compared with experimental data from inelastic neutron scattering results to verify and guide the accuracy of experimental detection.

Title: Effect of charge regulation on the screening properties of zwitterionic macroion solutions
Authors: Rashmi Kandari, Rudolf Podgornik, Sunita Kumari
Abstract: Precisely controlling the surface charge of zwitterionic macromolecules is crucial for tailoring their properties and optimizing them for specific applications. Here, we present a generalized calculation scheme for determining the screening length in solutions containing zwitterionic macroions, where the charge of the macroion is controlled by the electrolyte solution. This scheme bypasses the need to solve the Poisson Boltzmann equation by expressing the inverse screening parameter in terms of the derivative of pressure with respect to chemical potential. The scheme reveals that the screening length has two components: one related to the Debye length with effective charges, and another stemming from the macroion surface dissociation equilibrium, which exhibits a screening resonance behavior. Furthermore, we find that the nonuniform surface charge distribution induced by pH responsive charge regulation strongly affects the screening behavior. The charge regulation properties of macroions, even in dilute solutions, are a key factor in the screening of electrostatic interactions, offering insights into complex biological and nanomaterial systems.

Title: Mechanical stability of resonant Bose-Fermi mixtures
Authors: Christian Gualerzi, Leonardo Pisani, Pierbiagio Pieri
Abstract: We investigate the mechanical stability of Bose-Fermi mixtures at zero temperature in the presence of a tunable Feshbach resonance, which induces a competition between boson condensation and boson-fermion pairing when the boson density is smaller than the fermion density. Using a many-body diagrammatic approach validated by fixed-node Quantum Monte Carlo calculations and supported by recent experimental observations, we determine the minimal amount of boson-boson repulsion required to guarantee the stability of the mixture across the entire range of boson-fermion interactions from weak to strong coupling. Our stability phase diagrams indicate that mixtures with boson-to-fermion mass ratios near two, such as the $^{87}$Rb-$^{40}$K system, exhibit optimal stability conditions. Moreover, by applying our results to a recent experiment with a $^{23}$Na-$^{40}$K mixture, we find that the boson-boson repulsion was insufficient to ensure stability, suggesting that the experimental timescale was short enough to avoid mechanical collapse. On the other hand, we also show that even in the absence of boson-boson repulsion, Bose-Fermi mixtures become intrinsically stable beyond a certain coupling strength, preceding the quantum phase transition associated with the vanishing of the bosonic condensate. We thus propose an experimental protocol for observing this quantum phase transition in a mechanically stable configuration.

Title: Directional driving of vortex lines with oscillating magnetic field
Authors: A. E. Koshelev
Abstract: The possibility of driving vortex lines with an oscillating magnetic field could be useful in many applications. For example, it can be used for the removal of undesired trapped flux from contactless elements of superconducting devices. We investigate the dynamics of vortex lines in a superconducting film with a ratchet thickness profile driven by an oscillating magnetic field applied parallel to the film. We numerically simulate the dynamics of a single flux line modeled as an elastic string with a variable length. We explore the behavior for different frequencies and amplitudes of the oscillating magnetic field and find several dynamic regimes. For moderate frequencies, the average velocity is finite only within specific amplitude ranges. A notable feature is the presence of extended velocity plateaus, which correspond to regimes when the line moves by integer multiples of the spatial period $w$ during integer multiples of the time period $T$. The transitions to these plateau states are rather steep, especially at low frequencies. The plateau at velocity $w/T$ dominates at intermediate frequencies but vanishes at high frequencies. The onset field amplitude of finite velocity nonmonotonically depends on the frequency and passes through a minimum at a certain frequency value. At low frequencies, the velocity exceeds $w/T$ and progressively increases with the amplitude. These findings provide valuable insights into the dynamic behavior of vortex lines driven by oscillating magnetic field in patterned superconducting films, offering potential pathways for controlling the magnetic flux in superconducting devices.

Title: Interface-Induced Stability of Nontrivial Topological Spin Textures: Unveiling Room-Temperature Hopfions and Skyrmions

Abstract: Topological spin configurations, such as soliton-like spin texture and Dirac electron assemblies, have emerged in recent years in both fundamental science and technological applications. Achieving stable topological spin textures at room-temperature is crucial for enabling these structures as long-range information carriers. However, their creation and manipulation processes have encountered difficulties due to multi-step field training techniques and competitive interactions. Thus, a spontaneous ground state for multi-dimensional topological spin textures is desirable, as skyrmions form swirling, hedgehog-like spin structures in two dimensions, while hopfions emerge as their twisted three-dimensional counterparts. Here, we report the first observation of robust and reproducible topological spin textures of hopfions and skyrmions observed at room temperature and in zero magnetic field, which are stabilized by geometric confinement and protected by interfacial magnetism in a ferromagnet/topological insulator/ferromagnet trilayer heterostructure. These skyrmion-hopfion configurations are directly observed at room temperature with Lorenz transmission electron microscopy. Using micromagnetic modelling, the experimental observations of hopfion-skyrmion assemblies are reproduced. Our model reveals a complete picture of how spontaneously organized skyrmion lattices encircled by hopfion rings are controlled by surface electrons, uniaxial anisotropy and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, all at ambient temperature. Our study provides evidence that topological chiral spin textures can facilitate the development of magnetically defined information carriers. These stable structures hold promise for ultralow-power and high-density information processing, paving the way for the next generation of topologically defined devices.

Abstract: A prediction makes a claim about a system's future given knowledge of its past. A retrodiction makes a claim about its past given knowledge of its future. The bidirectional machine is an ambidextrous hidden Markov chain that does both optimally by making explicit in its state structure all statistical correlation in a stochastic process. We introduce an informational taxonomy to profile these correlations via a suite of multivariate information measures. While prior results laid out the different kinds of information contained in isolated measurement of a bit, the associated informations were challenging to calculate explicitly. Overcoming this via bidirectional machine states, we expand that analysis to prediction and retrodiction. The result highlights fourteen new interpretable and calculable measures that characterize a process' informational structure. In addition, we introduce a labeling and indexing scheme that systematizes information-theoretic analyses of complex multivariate systems. Operationalizing this, we provide algorithms to directly calculate all of these quantities in closed form for finitely-modeled processes.

Title: Extending Collinear Density Functionals to Noncollinear Cases under Periodic Boundary Condition
Authors: Xiaoyu Zhang, Taoni Bao
Abstract: Accurate modeling of spin-orbit coupling and noncollinear magnetism in materials requires noncollinear density functionals within the two-component generalized Kohn-Sham (GKS) framework, yet constructing and implementing noncollinear functionals remains challenging. Recently, a methodology was proposed to extend collinear functionals into noncollinear ones, successfully defining noncollinear functionals and their derivatives. However, the initial implementation involved a systematic approach to differentiate energy over density matrix elements rather than the derivatives of the energy functional with respect to density, presenting challenges for integration with periodic boundary condition-density functional theory (PBC-DFT) software. We have derived a novel set of working equations based on the original methodology, which provides noncollinear energy functionals and their derivatives. These working equations have been implemented in our noncollinear functional ensemble named NCXC, ensuring numerical stability and transferability without the need for incorporating derivatives of basis functions. This implementation is expected to facilitate compatibility with most DFT software packages. We demonstrate some preliminary applications in periodic systems, including noncollinear magnetism in spin spirals, band structures in topological insulators, and band gaps in semiconducting inorganic materials, using NCXC.

Title: Magnon Nesting in Driven Two-Dimensional Quantum Magnets
Authors: Hossein Hosseinabadi, Yaroslav Tserkovnyak, Eugene Demler, Jamir Marino
Abstract: We uncover a new class of dynamical quantum instability in driven magnets leading to emergent enhancement of antiferromagnetic correlations even for purely ferromagnetic microscopic couplings. A primary parametric amplification creates a frequency-tuned nested magnon distribution in momentum space, which seeds a secondary instability marked by the emergence of enhanced antiferromagnetic correlations, mirroring the instability of nested Fermi surfaces in electronic systems. In sharp contrast to the fermionic case, however, the magnon-driven instability is intrinsically non-equilibrium and fundamentally inaccessible in thermal physics. Its quantum mechanical origin sets it apart from classical instabilities such as Faraday and modulation instabilities, which underlie several instances of dynamical behavior observed in magnetic and cold-atom systems.

Title: Multiple-Nanowire Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices: Critical Currents, Symmetries, and Vorticity Stability Regions
Authors: Cliff Sun, Alexey Bezryadin
Abstract: An ordinary superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) contains two weak links connected in parallel. We model a multiple-wire SQUID (MW-SQUID), generalized in two ways. First, the number of weak links, which are provided by parallel superconducting nanowires, is larger than two. Second, the current-phase relationship of each nanowire is assumed linear, which is typical for a homogeneous superconducting thin wire. For such MW-SQUIDs, our model predicts that the critical current ($I_c$) is a multi-valued function of the magnetic field. We also calculate vorticity stability regions (VSR), i.e., regions in the current-magnetic field plane in which, for a given distribution of vortices, the currents in all wires are below their critical values, so the vortices do not move between the cells. The VSRs have rhombic shapes in the case of two-wire SQUIDS and have more complicated shapes in the case of many nanowires. We present a classification of such VSRs and determine conditions under which VSR is disjoint, leading to 100\% supercurrent modulation and quantum phase transitions. According to the model, the maximum critical current curves obey $IB$ symmetry, while each VSR obeys $IBV$ symmetry. The model predicts conditions at which MW-SQUID exhibits a perfect diode effect in which the critical current of one polarity is zero while it is not zero for the opposite polarity of the bias current. We also provide a classification of the stability regions produced by (1) completely symmetric, (2) phase disordered, (3) position disordered, (4) critical current disordered, and (5) completely disordered multi-wire SQUIDs.

Title: Electronic structures and magnetism in van der Waals flat-band material Ni$_{3}$GeTe$_{2}$
Authors: Yuanji Xu, Xintao Jin, Haoyuan Tang, Fuyang Tian
Abstract: The study of magnetism in two-dimensional materials has garnered significant interest, driven by fundamental investigations into low-dimensional magnetic phenomena and their potential for applications in spintronic devices. Through dynamical mean-field theory calculations, we demonstrate that Ni$_{3}$GeTe$_{2}$ exhibits flat-band characteristics resulting from the geometric frustration of its layered triangular lattice. These flat bands are further renormalized due to electronic correlation. Our calculations reveal that the magnetic order of Ni atoms is significantly influenced by both the Coulomb interaction and Hund's coupling, indicating that the physics of Ni atoms is situated in an intermediate region between Hundness and Mottness. Additionally, our results show that Ni atoms experience significant spin fluctuations in their local moments, maintaining paramagnetism at low temperatures. Furthermore, we investigate the effect of vacancies, finding a substantial suppression of the density of states at the Fermi level. The physical mechanisms uncovered by our study provide a comprehensive understanding of the novel properties exhibited in this material.

Title: Landau-Ginzburg Paradigm of Topological Phases
Authors: Yu Zhao, Yidun Wan
Abstract: Topologically ordered matter phases have been regarded as beyond the Landau-Ginzburg symmetry breaking paradigm of matter phases. Recent studies of anyon condensation in topological phases, however, may fit topological phases back in the Landau-Ginzburg paradigm. To truly do so, we realized that the string-net model of topological phases is in fact an effective lattice gauge theory coupled with anyonic matter once two modifications are made: (1) We reinterpret anyons as matter fields coupled to lattice gauge fields, thus extending the HGW model to a genuine Hamiltonian lattice gauge theory. (2) By explicitly incorporating the internal degrees of freedom of anyons, we construct an enlarged Hilbert space that supports well-defined gauge transformations and covariant coupling, restoring the analogy with conventional lattice gauge field theory. In this modified string-net model, topological phase transitions induced by anyon condensation and their consequent phenomena, such as order parameter fields, coherent states, Goldstone modes, and gapping gauge degrees of freedom, can be formulated exactly as Landau's effective theory of the Higgs mechanism. To facilitate the understanding, we also compare anyon condensation to/with the Higgs boson condensation in the electroweak theory and the Cooper pair condensation.

Title: Magnetic structure of the kagome metal YbFe6Ge6 in view of Bragg diffraction
Authors: S W Lovesey
Abstract: A material in possession of localized 4f-electron magnetism and delocalized 3d-electron or band magnetism can often present A material in possession of localized 4f-electron magnetism and delocalized 3d-electron or band magnetism can often present enigmatic physical phenomena, and there has been a longstanding interest in the kagome metal YbFe6Ge6. More recently, because of an investigation of a so-called anomalous Hall effect, or topological Hall effect, and magnetic neutron Bragg diffraction [W. Yao et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 186501 (2025)]. Iron moments in the two-dimensional layers of a hexagonal nuclear structure undergo collinear antiferromagnetic order below a temperature 500 K. The moments depart from the c axis in a spontaneous transition at 63 K to an orthorhombic structure. The magnetism of Yb ions appears to behave independently, which can be confirmed using resonant x-ray diffraction enhanced by a Fe atomic resonance. The inferred magnetic space group is a P(parity)T(time)-symmetric (anti-inversion collinear antiferromagnet. A linear magnetoelectric effect is allowed, as in historically important chromium sesquioxide, and Kerr rotation and the piezomagnetic effect are forbidden. Symmetry informed Bragg diffraction patterns for future x-ray and neutron experiments are shown to be rich in Fe magnetic properties of orthorhombic YbFe6Ge6, including space-spin correlations, anapoles and Dirac quadrupoles familiar in high-Tc ceramic superconductors.

Title: Temperature-Noise Interplay in a Coupled Model of Opinion Dynamics
Authors: Anna Chmiel, Julian Sienkiewicz
Abstract: We consider a coupled system mimicking opinion formation under the influence of a group of $q$ neighbors ($q$-lobby) that consists of an Ising part governed by temperature-like parameter $T$ and a voter dynamics parameterized by noise probability $p$ (independence of choice). Using rigorous analytical calculations backed by extensive Monte Carlo simulations, we examine the interplay between these two quantities. Based on the theory of phase transitions, we derive the relation between $T$ and $p$ at the critical line dividing the ordered and disordered phases, which takes a very simple and generic form $T(p-a)=b$ in the high temperature limit. For specific lobby sizes, we show where the temperature are noise are balanced, and we hint that for large $q$, the temperature-like dynamics prevails.

Title: Revealing the Dominance of the Orbital Hall Effect over Spin in Transition Metal Heterostructures
Authors: J. L. Costa, E. Santos, J. B. S. Mendes, A. Azevedo
Abstract: We study inverse spin and orbital Hall effects in 19 transition metals using spin-pumping driven by ferromagnetic resonance. Spin-to-charge conversion was measured in YIG/X(5), while orbital-to-charge conversion was probed in YIG/Pt(2)/X(5) heterostructures. Here, X represents the different transition metals. Surprisingly, the orbital contribution overwhelmingly dominates over the spin response, clarifying the challenge of disentangling these effects. Our results largely agree with first-principles predictions for spin and orbital Hall conductivities but reveal discrepancies in select materials. These findings emphasize the fundamental role of the orbital Hall effect, and position orbitronics as a pivotal frontier in condensed matter physics.

Title: Cavity-Mediated Gas-Liquid Transition
Authors: Fan Zhang, Haowei Li, Wei Yi
Abstract: We study the gas-liquid transition in a binary Bose-Einstein condensate, where the two Zeeman-shifted hyperfine spin components are coupled by cavity-assisted Raman processes. Below a critical Zeeman field, the cavity becomes superradiant for an infinitesimally small pumping strength, where the enhanced superradiance is facilitated by the simultaneous formation of quantum droplet, a self-bound liquid phase stabilized by quantum fluctuations. Above the critical Zeeman field, the gas-liquid transition only takes place at a finite pumping strength after the system becomes superradiant. As the back action of the gas-liquid transition, the superradiant cavity field undergoes an abrupt jump at the first-order transition point. Furthermore, as a result of the fixed density ratio of the quantum droplet, the cavity field exhibits a linear scaling with the pumping strength in the liquid phase. These features serve as prominent signals for the cavity-mediated gas-liquid transition and coexistence, which derive from the interplay of Zeeman field, cavity-assisted spin mixing, and quantum fluctuations.

Title: Half-integer thermal conductance in the absence of Majorana mode
Authors: Ujjal Roy, Sourav Manna, Souvik Chakraborty, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Ankur Das, Moshe Goldstein, Yuval Gefen, Anindya Das
Abstract: Considering a range of candidate quantum phases of matter, half-integer thermal conductance ($\kappa_{\text{th}}$) is believed to be an unambiguous evidence of non-Abelian states. It has been long known that such half-integer values arise due to the presence of Majorana edge modes, representing a significant step towards topological quantum computing platforms. Here, we challenge this prevailing notion by presenting a comprehensive theoretical and experimental study where half-integer two-terminal thermal conductance plateau is realized employing Abelian phases. Our proposed setup features a confined geometry of bilayer graphene, interfacing distinct particle-like and hole-like integer quantum Hall states. Each segment of the device exhibits full charge and thermal equilibration. Our approach is amenable to generalization to other quantum Hall platforms, and may give rise to other values of fractional (electrical and thermal) quantized transport. Our study demonstrates that the observation of robust non-integer values of thermal conductance can arise as a manifestation of mundane equilibration dynamics as opposed to underlying non-trivial topology.

Title: Machine learning potentials for modeling alloys across compositions
Authors: Killian Sheriff, Daniel Xiao, Yifan Cao, Lewis R. Owen, Rodrigo Freitas
Abstract: Materials properties depend strongly on chemical composition, i.e., the relative amounts of each chemical element. Changes in composition lead to entirely different chemical arrangements, which vary in complexity from perfectly ordered (i.e., stoichiometric compounds) to completely disordered (i.e., solid solutions). Accurately capturing this range of chemical arrangements remains a major challenge, limiting the predictive accuracy of machine learning potentials (MLPs) in materials modeling. Here, we combine information theory and machine learning to optimize the sampling of chemical motifs and design MLPs that effectively capture the behavior of metallic alloys across their entire compositional and structural landscape. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated by predicting the compositional dependence of various material properties - including stacking-fault energies, short-range order, heat capacities, and phase diagrams - for the AuPt and CuAu binary alloys, the ternary CrCoNi, and the TiTaVW high-entropy alloy. Extensive comparison against experimental data demonstrates the robustness of this approach in enabling materials modeling with high physical fidelity.

Title: Emergent quantum field theories on curved spacetimes in spinor Bose-Einstein condensates: from scalar to Proca fields
Authors: Simon Brunner, Christian F. Schmidt, Stefan Floerchinger
Abstract: We consider excitations of a spin-1 Bose-Einstein-condensate (BEC) in the vicinity of different mean-field configurations and derive mappings to emergent relativistic quantum field theories minimally coupled to curved acoustic spacetimes. The quantum fields are typically identified with Nambu-Goldstone bosons, such that the structure of the analogue quantum field theories on curved spacetimes depends on the (spontaneous) symmetry breaking pattern of the respective ground-state. The emergent spacetime geometries are independent of each other and exhibit bi-metricity in the polar and antiferromagnetic phase, whereas one has tri-metricity in the ferromagnetic phase. Compared to scalar BECs, the spinor degrees of freedom allow to investigate massive vector and scalar fields where the former is a spin-nematic rotation mode in the polar phase which can be cast into a Proca field that is minimally coupled to a curved spacetime that emerges on length scales larger than the spin-healing length. Finally, we specify the Zeeman couplings and the condensate trap to be spacetime-dependent such that a cosmological FLRW-metric can be achieved. This work enables a pathway towards quantum-simulating cosmological particle production of Proca quanta via quenching the quadratic Zeeman-coefficient or via magnetic field ramps, which both result in the creation of spin-nematic squeezed states.

Title: Scaling and Universality at Noisy Quench Dynamical Quantum Phase Transitions
Authors: Saeid Ansari, R. Jafari, Alireza Akbari, Mehdi Abdi
Abstract: Dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) have been studied in the extended XY model under both noiseless and noisy linear driven staggered field cases. In the time-independent staggered field case, the model exhibits a single critical point where the transition occurs from the spin-liquid phase to the antiferromagnetic phase. In the noiseless ramp case, unlike the transverse field XY model where DQPT always occurs for a quench crossing the single critical point, there is a critical sweep velocity above which the kinks corresponding to a DQPT are completely removed. Furthermore, in this case there are only two critical modes whose excitation probability is one-half. In the presence of a Gaussian white noise, we find that this critical sweep velocity decreases by increasing the noise strength, and scales linearly with the square of the noise intensity. A surprising result occurs when the noise intensity and sweep velocity are about the same order of magnitude, the number of critical modes is significantly increased, signalling a region with multiple critical modes. Furthermore, our findings indicate that the scaling of the dynamical free energy near the DQPTs time is the same for both noiseless and noisy ramp quenches.

Title: Dynamical Phase diagram of the Quantum Ising model with Cluster Interaction Under Noisy and Noiseless Driven field
Authors: Sasan Kheiri, R. Jafari, S. Mahdavifar, Ehsan Nedaaee Oskoee, Alireza Akbari
Abstract: In most lattice models, gap closing typically occurs at high-symmetry points in the Brillouin zone. In the transverse field Ising model with cluster interaction, besides the gap closing at high-symmetry points, the gap closing at the quantum phase transition between paramagnetic and cluster phases of the model can be moved by tuning the strength of the cluster interaction. We take advantage of this property to examine the nonequilibrium dynamics of the model in the framework of dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) after a noiseless and noisy ramp of the transverse magnetic field. The numerical results show that DQPTs always happen if the starting or ending point of the quench field is restricted between two critical points. In other ways, there is always critical sweep velocity above which DQPTs disappear. Our finding reveals that noise modifies drastically the dynamical phase diagram of the model. We find that the critical sweep velocity decreases by enhancing the noise intensity and scales linearly with the square of noise intensity for weak and strong noise. Moreover, the region with multi-critical modes induced in the dynamical phase diagram by noise. The sweep velocity under which the system enters the multi-critical modes (MCMs) region increases by enhancing the noise and scales linearly with the square of noise intensity

Title: Generative thermodynamic computing
Authors: Stephen Whitelam
Abstract: We introduce a generative modeling framework for thermodynamic computing, in which structured data is synthesized from noise by the natural time evolution of a physical system governed by Langevin dynamics. While conventional diffusion models use neural networks to perform denoising, here the information needed to generate structure from noise is encoded by the dynamics of a thermodynamic system. Training proceeds by maximizing the probability with which the computer generates the reverse of a noising trajectory, which ensures that the computer generates data with minimal heat emission. We demonstrate this framework within a digital simulation of a thermodynamic computer. If realized in analog hardware, such a system would function as a generative model that produces structured samples without the need for artificially-injected noise or active control of denoising.

Title: First Exit Times of Harmonically Trapped Particles: A Didactic Review
Authors: D. S. Grebenkov
Abstract: We revise the classical problem of characterizing first exit times of a harmonically trapped particle whose motion is described by one- or multi-dimensional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. We start by recalling the main derivation steps of a propagator using Langevin and Fokker-Planck equations. The mean exit time, the moment-generating function, and the survival probability are then expressed through confluent hypergeometric functions and thoroughly analyzed. We also present a rapidly converging series representation of confluent hypergeometric functions that is particularly well suited for numerical computation of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the governing Fokker-Planck operator. We discuss several applications of first exit times such as detection of time intervals during which motor proteins exert a constant force onto a tracer in optical tweezers single-particle tracking experiments; adhesion bond dissociation under mechanical stress; characterization of active periods of trend following and mean-reverting strategies in algorithmic trading on stock markets; relation to the distribution of first crossing times of a moving boundary by Brownian motion. Some extensions are described, including diffusion under quadratic double-well potential and anomalous diffusion.

Title: On the map-territory fallacy fallacy
Authors: Maxwell J D Ramstead, Dalton A R Sakthivadivel, Karl J Friston
Abstract: This paper presents a meta-theory of the usage of the free energy principle (FEP) and examines its scope in the modelling of physical systems. We consider the so-called `map-territory fallacy' and the fallacious reification of model properties. By showing that the FEP is a consistent, physics-inspired theory of inferences of inferences, we disprove the assertion that the map-territory fallacy contradicts the principled usage of the FEP. As such, we argue that deploying the map-territory fallacy to criticise the use of the FEP and Bayesian mechanics itself constitutes a fallacy: what we call the {\it map-territory fallacy fallacy}. In so doing, we emphasise a few key points: the uniqueness of the FEP as a model of particles or agents that model their environments; the restoration of convention to the FEP via its relation to the principle of constrained maximum entropy; the `Jaynes optimality' of the FEP under this relation; and finally, the way that this meta-theoretical approach to the FEP clarifies its utility and scope as a formal modelling tool. Taken together, these features make the FEP, uniquely, {\it the} ideal model of generic systems in statistical physics.

Title: Area laws and tensor networks for maximally mixed ground states
Authors: Itai Arad, Raz Firanko, Rahul Jain
Abstract: We show an area law in the mutual information for the maximally-mixed state $\Omega$ in the ground space of general Hamiltonians, which is independent of the underlying ground space degeneracy. Our result assumes the existence of a `good' approximation to the ground state projector (a good AGSP), a crucial ingredient in previous area-law proofs. Such approximations have been explicitly derived for 1D gapped local Hamiltonians and 2D frustration-free locally-gapped Hamiltonians. As a corollary, we show that in 1D gapped local Hamiltonians, for any $\varepsilon>0$ and any bi-partition $L\cup L^c$ of the system, \begin{align*} \mathrm I_{\max}^\varepsilon (L:L^c)_{\Omega} \le \mathrm O \big( \log (|L|\log(d))+\log(1/\varepsilon)\big), \end{align*} where $|L|$ represents the number of sites in $L$, $d$ is the dimension of a site and $ \mathrm I_{\max}^\varepsilon (L:L^c)_{\Omega} $ represents the $\varepsilon$-\emph{smoothed maximum mutual information} with respect to the $L:L^c$ partition in $\Omega$. From this bound we then conclude $\mathrm I (L:L^c)_\Omega \le \mathrm O\big(\log(|L|\log(d))\big)$ -- an area law for the mutual information in 1D systems with a logarithmic correction. In addition, we show that $\Omega$ can be approximated in trace norm up to $\varepsilon$ with a state of Schmidt rank of at most $\mathrm{poly}(|L|/\varepsilon)$, leading to a good MPO approximation for $\Omega$ with polynomial bond dimension. Similar corollaries are derived for the mutual information of 2D frustration-free and locally-gapped local Hamiltonians.

Title: Subsystem Information Capacity in Random Circuits and Hamiltonian Dynamics
Authors: Yu-Qin Chen, Shuo Liu, Shi-Xin Zhang
Abstract: In this study, we explore the information capacity of open quantum systems, focusing on the effective channels formed by the subsystem of random quantum circuits and quantum Hamiltonian evolution. By analyzing the subsystem information capacity, which is closely linked to quantum coherent information of these effective quantum channels, we uncover a diverse range of dynamical and steady behaviors depending on the types of evolution. Therefore, the subsystem information capacity serves as a valuable tool for studying the intrinsic nature of various dynamical phases, such as integrable, localized, thermalized, and topological systems. We also reveal the impact of different initial information encoding schemes on information dynamics including one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many. To support our findings, we provide representative examples for numerical simulations, including random quantum circuits with or without mid-circuit measurements, random Clifford Floquet circuits, free and interacting Aubry-André models, and Su-Schrieffer-Heeger models. These numerical results are further quantitatively explained using the effective statistical model mapping and the quasiparticle picture in the cases of random circuits and non-interacting Hamiltonian dynamics, respectively.

Title: A generalized neural tangent kernel for surrogate gradient learning
Authors: Luke Eilers, Raoul-Martin Memmesheimer, Sven Goedeke
Abstract: State-of-the-art neural network training methods depend on the gradient of the network function. Therefore, they cannot be applied to networks whose activation functions do not have useful derivatives, such as binary and discrete-time spiking neural networks. To overcome this problem, the activation function's derivative is commonly substituted with a surrogate derivative, giving rise to surrogate gradient learning (SGL). This method works well in practice but lacks theoretical foundation. The neural tangent kernel (NTK) has proven successful in the analysis of gradient descent. Here, we provide a generalization of the NTK, which we call the surrogate gradient NTK, that enables the analysis of SGL. First, we study a naive extension of the NTK to activation functions with jumps, demonstrating that gradient descent for such activation functions is also ill-posed in the infinite-width limit. To address this problem, we generalize the NTK to gradient descent with surrogate derivatives, i.e., SGL. We carefully define this generalization and expand the existing key theorems on the NTK with mathematical rigor. Further, we illustrate our findings with numerical experiments. Finally, we numerically compare SGL in networks with sign activation function and finite width to kernel regression with the surrogate gradient NTK; the results confirm that the surrogate gradient NTK provides a good characterization of SGL.

Title: An Explicit Categorical Construction of Instanton Density in Lattice Yang-Mills Theory
Authors: Peng Zhang, Jing-Yuan Chen
Abstract: Since the inception of lattice QCD, a natural definition for the Yang-Mills instanton on lattice has been long sought for. In a recent work, one of authors showed the natural solution has to be organized in terms of bundle gerbes in higher homotopy theory / higher category theory, and introduced the principles for such a categorical construction. To pave the way towards actual numerical implementation in the near future, nonetheless, an explicit construction is necessary. In this paper we provide such an explicit construction for $SU(2)$ gauge theory, with technical aspects inspired by Lüscher's 1982 geometrical construction. We will see how the latter is in a suitable sense a saddle point approximation to the full categorical construction. The generalization to $SU(N)$ will be discussed. The construction also allows for a natural definition of lattice Chern-Simons-Yang-Mills theory in three spacetime dimensions.

Title: All-passive upconversion of incoherent near-infrared light at intensities down to 10$^{-7}$ W/cm$^2$
Authors: Rabeeya Hamid, Demeng Feng, Pournima Narayanan, Justin S. Edwards, Manchen Hu, Emma Belliveau, Minjeong Kim, Sanket Deshpande, Chenghao Wan, Linda Pucurimay, David A. Czaplewski, Daniel N. Congreve, Mikhail A. Kats
Abstract: Frequency upconversion, which converts low-energy photons into higher-energy ones, typically requires intense coherent illumination to drive nonlinear processes or the use of externally driven optoelectronic devices. Here, we demonstrate an upconversion system that converts low-intensity (down to ~10-7 W/cm$^2$) incoherent near-infrared (NIR) light into the visible, reaching intensities perceptible by the human eye, without the use of any external power input. Our upconverting element is enabled by the following ingredients: (1) photon upconversion via triplet-triplet annihilation in a bulk heterojunction of the organic semiconductors Y6 and rubrene; (2) plasmonic enhancement of absorption and field intensity in the heterojunction layer; (3) collection enhancement using a dichroic thin-film assembly. To enable high-resolution imaging, the upconverting element is inserted at an intermediate image plane of a dual-wavelength telescope system, which preserves the relative directionality of rays between the incident NIR light and output visible light. Our all-passive upconversion imaging system will enable NIR imaging and sensing in low-light environments under energy constraints.

Title: Entangled states from sparsely coupled spins for metrology with neutral atoms
Authors: Sridevi Kuriyattil, Pablo M. Poggi, Jonathan D. Pritchard, Johannes Kombe, Andrew J. Daley
Abstract: Quantum states featuring extensive multipartite entanglement are a resource for quantum-enhanced metrology, with sensitivity up to the Heisenberg limit. However, robust generation of these states using unitary dynamics typically requires all-to-all interactions among particles. Here, we demonstrate that optimal states for quantum sensing can be generated with sparse interaction graphs featuring only a logarithmic number of couplings per particle. We show that specific sparse graphs with long-range interactions can approximate the dynamics of all-to-all spin models, such as the one-axis twisting model, even for large system sizes. The resulting sparse coupling graphs and protocol can also be efficiently implemented using dynamic reconfiguration of atoms in optical tweezers.

Title: Finite size scaling of survival statistics in metapopulation models
Authors: Alice Doimo, Giorgio Nicoletti, Davide Bernardi, Prajwal Padmanabha
Abstract: Spatial metapopulation models are fundamental to theoretical ecology, enabling to study how landscape structure influences global species dynamics. Traditional models, including recent generalizations, often rely on the deterministic limit of stochastic processes, assuming large population sizes. However, stochasticity - arising from dispersal events and population fluctuations - profoundly shapes ecological dynamics. In this work, we extend the classical metapopulation framework to account for finite populations, examining the impact of stochasticity on species persistence and dynamics. Specifically, we analyze how the limited capacity of local habitats influences survival, deriving analytical expressions for the finite-size scaling of the survival probability near the critical transition between survival and extinction. Crucially, we demonstrate that the deterministic metapopulation capacity plays a fundamental role in the statistics of survival probability and extinction time moments. These results provide a robust foundation for integrating demographic stochasticity into classical metapopulation models and their extensions.

Title: Page Curve and Entanglement Dynamics in an Interacting Fermionic Chain
Authors: Rishabh Jha, Salvatore R. Manmana, Stefan Kehrein
Abstract: Generic non-equilibrium many-body systems display a linear growth of bipartite entanglement entropy in time, followed by a volume law saturation. In stark contrast, the Page curve dynamics of black hole physics shows that the entropy peaks at the Page time $t_{\text{Page}}$ and then decreases to zero. Here, we investigate such Page-like behavior of the von Neumann entropy in a model of strongly correlated spinless fermions in a typical system-environment setup, and characterize the properties of the Page curve dynamics in the presence of interactions using numerically exact matrix product states methods. The two phases of growth, namely the linear growth and the bending down, are shown to be separated by a non-analyticity in the min-entropy before $t_{\text{Page}}$, which separates two different quantum phases, realized as the respective ground states of the corresponding entanglement (or equivalently, modular) Hamiltonian. We confirm and generalize, by introducing interactions, the findings of \href{this https URL}{Phys. Rev. B 109, 224308 (2024)} for a free spinless fermionic chain where the corresponding entanglement Hamiltonian undergoes a quantum phase transition at the point of non-analyticity. However, in the presence of interactions, a scaling analysis gives a non-zero critical time for the non-analyticity in the thermodynamic limit only for weak to intermediate interaction strengths, while the dynamics leading to the non-analyticity becomes \textit{instantaneous} for interactions large enough. We present a physical picture explaining these findings.

Title: Exactly solvable models for universal operator growth
Authors: Oleksandr Gamayun, Murtaza Ali Mir, Oleg Lychkovskiy, Zoran Ristivojevic
Abstract: Quantum observables of generic many-body systems exhibit a universal pattern of growth in the Krylov space of operators. This pattern becomes particularly manifest in the Lanczos basis, where the evolution superoperator assumes the tridiagonal form. According to the universal operator growth hypothesis, the nonzero elements of the superoperator, known as Lanczos coefficients, grow asymptotically linearly. We introduce and explore broad families of Lanczos coefficients that are consistent with the universal operator growth and lead to the exactly solvable dynamics. Within these families, the subleading terms of asymptotic expansion of the Lanczos sequence can be controlled and fine-tuned to produce diverse dynamical patterns. For one of the families, the Krylov complexity is computed exactly.

Title: Overcoming light scattering with high optical nonlinearity
Authors: Pawel Szczypkowski, Adrian Makowski, Wojciech Zwoliński, Katarzyna Prorok, Piotr Wasylczyk, Artur Bednarkiewicz, Radek Lapkiewicz
Abstract: Achieving high-resolution optical imaging deep within heterogeneous and scattering media remains a fundamental challenge in biological microscopy, where conventional techniques are hindered by multiple light scattering and absorption. Here, we present a non-invasive imaging approach that harnesses the nonlinear response of luminescent labels in conjunction with the statistical and spatial properties of speckle patterns - an effect of random light interference. Using avalanching nanoparticles (ANPs) with strong photoluminescence nonlinearity, we demonstrate that random speckle illumination can be converted into a single, localized, sub-diffraction excitation spot. This spot can be scanned across the sample using the angular memory effect, enabling high-resolution imaging through a scattering layer. Our method is general, fast, and cost-effective. It requires no wavefront shaping, no feedback, and no reconstruction algorithm, offering a powerful new route to deep, high-resolution imaging through complex media.

Title: Non-Gaussian Noise Magnetometry Using Local Spin Qubits
Authors: Jonathan B. Curtis, Amir Yacoby, Eugene Demler
Abstract: Atomic scale qubits, as may be realized in nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond, offer the opportunity to study magnetic field noise with nanometer scale spatial resolution. Using these spin qubits, one can learn a great deal about the magnetic-field noise correlations, and correspondingly the collective-mode spectra, in quantum materials and devices. However, to date these tools have been essentially restricted to studying Gaussian noise processes -- equivalent to linear-response. In this work we will show how to extend these techniques beyond the Gaussian regime and show how to unambiguously measure higher-order magnetic noise cumulants in a local, spatially resolved way. We unveil two protocols for doing this; the first uses a single spin-qubit and different dynamical decoupling sequences to extract non-Markovian and non-Gaussian spin-echo noise. The second protocol uses two-qubit coincidence measurements to study spatially non-local cumulants in the magnetic noise. We then demonstrate the utility of these protocols by considering a model of a bath of non-interacting two-level systems, as well as a model involving spatially correlated magnetic fluctuations near a second-order Ising phase transition. In both cases, we highlight how this technique can be used to measure in a real many-body system how fluctuation dynamics converge towards the central limit theorem as a function of effective bath size. We then conclude by discussing some promising applications and extensions of this method.

Title: The effect of preferential node deletion on the structure of networks that evolve via preferential attachment
Authors: Barak Budnick, Ofer Biham, Eytan Katzav
Abstract: We present analytical results for the effect of preferential node deletion on the structure of networks that evolve via node addition and preferential attachment. To this end, we consider a preferential-attachment-preferential-deletion (PAPD) model, in which at each time step, with probability $P_{\rm add}$ there is a growth step where an isolated node is added to the network, followed by the addition of $m$ edges, where each edge connects a node selected uniformly at random to a node selected preferentially in proportion to its degree. Alternatively, with probability $P_{\rm del}=1-P_{\rm add}$ there is a contraction step, in which a preferentially selected node is deleted and its links are erased. The balance between the growth and contraction processes is captured by the growth/contraction rate $\eta=P_{\rm add}-P_{\rm del}$. For $0 < \eta \le 1$ the overall process is of network growth, while for $-1\le\eta<0$ the overall process is of network contraction. Using the master equation and the generating function formalism, we study the time-dependent degree distribution $P_t(k)$. It is found that for each value of $m>0$ there is a critical value $\eta_c(m)=-(m-2)/(m+2)$ such that for $\eta_c(m)<\eta\le1$ the degree distribution $P_t(k)$ converges towards a stationary distribution $P_{\rm st}(k)$. In the special case of pure growth, where $\eta=1$, the model is reduced to a preferential attachment growth model and $P_{\rm st}(k)$ exhibits a power-law tail, which is a characteristic of scale-free networks. In contrast, for $\eta_c(m)<\eta<1$ the distribution $P_{\rm st}(k)$ exhibits an exponential tail, which has a well-defined this http URL implies a phase transition at $\eta=1$, in contrast with the preferential-attachment-random-deletion (PARD) model [B. Budnick, O. Biham and E. Katzav, J. Stat. Mech. 013401 (2025)], in which the power-law tail remains intact as long as $\eta>0$.

Title: State Engineering of Unsteerable Hamiltonians
Authors: Yi-Xuan Wang, Yuval Gefen
Abstract: Lindbladian dynamics of open systems may be employed to steer a many-body system towards a non-trivial ground state of a local Hamiltonian. Such protocols provide us with tunable platforms facilitating the engineering and study of non-trivial many-body states. Steering towards a degenerate ground state manifold provides us with a protected platform to employ many-body states as a resource for quantum information processing. Notably, ground states of frustrated local Hamiltonians have been known not to be amenable to steering protocols. Revisiting this intricate physics we report two new results: (i) we find a broad class of (geometrically) frustrated local Hamiltonians for which steering of the ground state manifold is possible through a sequence of discrete steering steps. Following the steering dynamics, states within the degenerate ground-state manifold keep evolving in a non-stationary manner. (ii) For the class of Hamiltonians with ground states which are non-steerable through local superoperators, we derive a "glass floor" on how close to the ground state one can get implementing a steering protocol. This is expressed invoking the concept of cooling-by-steering (a lower bound of the achievable temperature), or through an upper bound of the achievable fidelity. Our work provides a systematic outline for studying quantum state manipulation of a broad class of strongly correlated states.

Title: Measurement-Induced Dynamical Quantum Thermalization
Authors: Marvin Lenk, Sayak Biswas, Anna Posazhennikova, Johann Kroha
Abstract: One of the fundamental problems of quantum statistical physics is how an ideally isolated quantum system can ever reach thermal equilibrium behavior despite the unitary time evolution of quantum-mechanical systems. Here, we study, via explicit time evolution for the generic model system of an interacting, trapped Bose gas with discrete single-particle levels, how the measurement of one or more observables subdivides the system into observed and non-observed Hilbert subspaces and the tracing over the non-measured quantum numbers defines an effective, thermodynamic bath, induces the entanglement of the observed Hilbert subspace with the bath, and leads to a bi-exponential approach of the entanglement entropy and of the measured observables to thermal equilibrium behavior as a function of time. We find this to be more generally fulfilled than in the scenario of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), namely for both local particle occupation numbers and non-local density correlation functions, and independent of the specific initial quantum state of the time evolution.

Title: Memorization to Generalization: Emergence of Diffusion Models from Associative Memory
Authors: Bao Pham, Gabriel Raya, Matteo Negri, Mohammed J. Zaki, Luca Ambrogioni, Dmitry Krotov
Abstract: Hopfield networks are associative memory (AM) systems, designed for storing and retrieving patterns as local minima of an energy landscape. In the classical Hopfield model, an interesting phenomenon occurs when the amount of training data reaches its critical memory load $- spurious\,\,states$, or unintended stable points, emerge at the end of the retrieval dynamics, leading to incorrect recall. In this work, we examine diffusion models, commonly used in generative modeling, from the perspective of AMs. The training phase of diffusion model is conceptualized as memory encoding (training data is stored in the memory). The generation phase is viewed as an attempt of memory retrieval. In the small data regime the diffusion model exhibits a strong memorization phase, where the network creates distinct basins of attraction around each sample in the training set, akin to the Hopfield model below the critical memory load. In the large data regime, a different phase appears where an increase in the size of the training set fosters the creation of new attractor states that correspond to manifolds of the generated samples. Spurious states appear at the boundary of this transition and correspond to emergent attractor states, which are absent in the training set, but, at the same time, have distinct basins of attraction around them. Our findings provide: a novel perspective on the memorization-generalization phenomenon in diffusion models via the lens of AMs, theoretical prediction of existence of spurious states, empirical validation of this prediction in commonly-used diffusion models.

Title: Exciton--hyperbolic-phonon-polariton Hybridization in Biased Bilayer Graphene
Authors: Tomer Eini, N. M. R. Peres, Yarden Mazor, Itai Epstein
Abstract: Excitons in biased bilayer graphene are electrically tunable optical excitations residing in the mid-infrared (MIR) spectral range, where intrinsic optical transitions are typically scarce. Such a tunable material system with an excitonic response offer a rare platform for exploring light-matter interactions and optical hybridization of quasiparticles residing in the long wavelength spectrum. In this work, we demonstrate that when the bilayer is encapsulated in hexagonal-boron-nitride (hBN)-a material supporting optical phonons and hyperbolic-phonon-polaritons (HPhPs) in the MIR-the excitons can be tuned into resonance with the HPhP modes. We find that the overlap in energy and momentum of the two MIR quasiparticles facilitate the formation of multiple strongly coupled hybridized exciton-HPhP states. Using an electromagnetic transmission line model, we derive the dispersion relations of the hybridized states and show that they are highly affected and can be manipulated by the symmetry of the system, determining the hybridization selection rules. Our results establish a general tunable MIR platform for engineering strongly coupled quasiparticle states in biased graphene systems, opening new directions for studying and controlling light-matter interactions in the long-wavelength regime.

Title: Emergent Holographic Spacetime from Quantum Information
Authors: Tadashi Takayanagi
Abstract: Holographic duality describes gravitational theories in terms of quantum many-body systems. In holography, quantum information theory provides a crucial tool that directly connects microscopic structures of these systems to the geometries of gravitational spacetimes. One manifestation is that the entanglement entropy in quantum many-body systems can be calculated from the area of an extremal surface in the corresponding gravitational spacetime. This implies that a gravitational spacetime can emerge from an enormous number of entangled qubits. In this Essay, I will discuss open problems in this area of research, considering recent developments and outlining future prospects towards a complete understanding of quantum gravity. The first step in this direction is to understand what kind of quantum circuits each holographic spacetime corresponds to, drawing on recent developments in quantum complexity theories and studying concrete examples of holography in string theory. Next, we should extend the concept of holography to general spacetimes, e.g., those spacetimes which appear in realistic cosmologies, by utilizing the connections between quantum information and holography. To address the fundamental question of how time emerges, I will propose the concepts of pseudo-entropy and time-like entanglement as a useful tool in our exploration.

Title: Free Probability in a Minimal Quantum Circuit Model
Authors: Felix Fritzsch, Pieter W. Claeys
Abstract: Recent experimental and theoretical developments in many-body quantum systems motivate the study of their out-of-equilibrium properties through multi-time correlation functions. We consider the dynamics of higher-order out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs) in a minimal circuit model for quantum dynamics. This model mimics the dynamics of a structured subsystem locally coupled to a maximally random environment. We prove the exponential decay of all higher-order OTOCs and fully characterize the relevant time scales, showing how local operators approach free independence at late times. We show that the effects of the environment on the local subsystem can be captured in a higher-order influence matrix, which allows for a Markovian description of the dynamics provided an auxiliary degree of freedom is introduced. This degree of freedom directly yields a dynamical picture for the OTOCs in terms of free cumulants from free probability, consistent with recent predictions from the full eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH). This approach and the relevant influence matrix are expected to be applicable in more general settings and present a first step to characterizing quantum memory in higher-order OTOCs.
