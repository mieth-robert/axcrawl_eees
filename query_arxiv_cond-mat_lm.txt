Title: Constrained Search in Imaginary Time
Authors: Markus Penz, Robert van Leeuwen
Abstract: An optimization method for the expectation value of a self-adjoint operator under a finite number of expectation-value constraints based on imaginary-time evolution is introduced. It is formulated for finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces and uses linearly independent and commuting self-adjoint operators for the constraints. The method is applied to the problem of finding the universal functional of density-functional theory and allows theoretical insights into the density-potential mapping.

Title: First-passage properties of the jump process with a drift. Two exactly solvable cases
Authors: Ivan N. Burenev, Satya N. Majumdar
Abstract: We investigate the first-passage properties of a jump process with a constant drift, focusing on two key observables: the first-passage time $\tau$ and the number of jumps $n$ before the first-passage event. By mapping the problem onto an effective discrete-time random walk, we derive an exact expression for the Laplace transform of the joint distribution of $\tau$ and $n$ using the generalized Pollaczek-Spitzer formula. This result is then used to analyze the first-passage properties for two exactly solvable cases: (i) both the inter-jump intervals and jump amplitudes are exponentially distributed, and (ii) the inter-jump intervals are exponentially distributed while all jumps have the same fixed amplitude. We show the existence of two distinct regimes governed by the strength of the drift: (i) a survival regime, where the process remains positive indefinitely with finite probability; (ii) an absorption regime, where the first-passage eventually occurs; and (iii) a critical point at the boundary between these two phases. We characterize the asymptotic behavior of survival probabilities in each regime: they decay exponentially to a constant in the survival regime, vanish exponentially fast in the absorption regime, and exhibit power-law decay at the critical point. Furthermore, in the absorption regime, we derive large deviation forms for the marginal distributions of $\tau$ and n. The analytical predictions are validated through extensive numerical simulations.

Title: Realizing Scalable Chemical Vapour Deposition of Monolayer Graphene Films on Iron with Concurrent Surface Hardening by in situ Observations

Abstract: Graphene has been suggested as an ultimately thin functional coating for metallurgical alloys such as steels. However, even on pure iron (Fe), the parent phase of steels, growth of high quality graphene films remains largely elusive to date. We here report scalable chemical vapour deposition (CVD) of high quality monolayer graphene films on Fe substrates. To achieve this, we here elucidate the mechanisms of graphene growth on Fe using complementary in situ X-ray diffractometry (XRD) and in situ near ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (NAP XPS) during our scalable CVD conditions. As key factors that set Fe apart from other common graphene CVD catalyst supports such as Ni or Cu, we identify that for Fe (i) carbothermal reduction of persistent Fe-oxides and (ii) kinetic balancing of carbon uptake into the Fe during CVD near the Fe-C eutectoid because of the complex multi-phased Fe-C phase diagram are critical. Additionally, we establish that the carbon uptake into the Fe during graphene CVD is not only important in terms of growth mechanism but can also be advantageously utilized for concurrent surface hardening of the Fe during the graphene CVD process akin to carburization/case hardening. Our work thereby forms a framework for controlled and scalable high-quality monolayer graphene film CVD on Fe incl. the introduction of concurrent surface hardening during graphene CVD.

Title: Flux attachment theory of fractional excitonic insulators
Authors: Steven Gassner, Ady Stern, C. L. Kane
Abstract: The search for fractional quantized Hall phases in the absence of a magnetic field has primarily targeted flat-band systems that mimic the features of a Landau level. In an alternative approach, the fractional excitonic insulator (FEI) has been proposed as a correlated electron-hole fluid that arises near a band inversion between bands of different angular momentum with strong interactions. It remains an interesting challenge to find Hamiltonians with realistic interactions that stabilize this state. Here, we describe composite boson and composite fermion theories that highlight the importance of $(p_x+ip_y)^m$ excitonic pairing in stabilizing FEIs in a class of band inversion models. We predict a sequence of Jain-like and Laughlin-like FEI states, the simplest of which has the topological order of the bosonic $\nu=1/2$ fractional quantized Hall state. We discuss implications for recent numerical studies on a chiral spin liquid phase in interacting Chern insulator models.

Title: Investigating electron conductivity regimes in the bacterial cytochrome wire OmcS
Authors: 3. L.N. Mohanam, R. Umeda, L. Gu, Y. Song, D.J. Tobias, A.I. Hochbaum, R. Wu, S. Sharifzadeh
Abstract: The anaerobic bacterium \textit{Geobacter sulfurreducens} produces extracellular, electronically conductive cytochrome polymer wires that are conductive over micron length scales. Structure models from cryo-electron microscopy data show OmcS wires form a linear chain of hemes along the protein wire axis, which is proposed as the structural basis supporting their electronic properties. The geometric arrangement of heme along OmcS wires is conserved in many multiheme c-type cytochromes and other recently discovered microbial cytochrome wires. However, the mechanism by which this arrangement of heme molecules support electron transport through proteins and supramolecular heme wires is unclear. Here, we investigate the site energies, inter-heme coupling, and long-range electronic conductivity within OmcS. We introduce an approach to extract charge carrier site information directly from Kohn-Sham density functional theory, without employing projector schemes. We show that site and coupling energies are highly sensitive to changes in inter-heme geometry and the surrounding electrostatic environment, as intuitively expected. These parameters serve as inputs for a quantum charge carrier model that includes decoherence corrections with which we predict a diffusion coefficient comparable with other organic-based electronic materials. Based on these simulations, we propose that dynamic disorder, particularly due to perturbative inter-heme vibrations allow the carrier to overcome trapping due to the presence of static disorder \textit{via} small frequency-dependent fluctuations. These studies provide insights into molecular and electronic determinants of long-range electronic conductivity in microbial cytochrome wires and highlight design principles for bioinspired, heme-based conductive materials.

Title: Field-tunable quantum disordered ground state in the triangular-lattice antiferromagnet TlYbSe2
Authors: Bishnu P. Belbase, Arjun Unnikrishnan, Eun Sang Choi, Arnab Banerjee
Abstract: We introduce the triangular-lattice antiferromagnet TlYbSe2 belonging to the rare-earth delafossite family with a relatively disorder-free frustrated triangular lattice - extending the search for the quintessential chiral quantum spin liquid state. While DC magnetization suggests magnetic exchange interactions in the order of several kelvin, the zero-field AC magnetization and heat capacity measurements reveal no signs of long-range magnetic order down to 20 mK, indicating a highly frustrated quantum-disordered ground state. The high-field AC magnetization reveals a phase diagram generally consistent with a large family of Yb delafossites. We observe a spin glass transition around 35 mK at zero field, which we argue is due to free spins. A broad anomaly in the heat capacity measurements between 2 - 5 K - indicative of short-range spin correlations - along with a linear temperature dependence at low temperatures and the complete absence of long-range order at low fields, establishes the low-temperature, low-field regime of TlYbSe2 as a prime location for exploring field-tunable QSL behavior.

Title: Data-Driven Molecular Dynamics and TEM Analysis of Platinum Crystal Growth on Graphene and Reactive Hydrogen-Sensing Dynamics
Authors: Akram Ibrahim, Ahmed M. Hafez, Mahmooda Sultana, Can Ataca
Abstract: Pt-functionalized graphene harnesses graphene's exceptional carrier mobility with Pt's catalytic activity for hydrogen sensing, yet the mechanisms of Pt crystal growth, its interaction with graphene, and the consequent impact on hydrogen sensitivity remain incompletely understood. We develop a high-fidelity equivariant machine-learned interatomic potential (MLIP) to perform large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with near-density functional theory (DFT) accuracy. Our simulations capture key growth stages-including Pt nucleation, coalescence, and the formation of either polycrystalline clusters or epitaxial thin films-under varying deposition loadings and rates. Transmission electron microscopy and Raman measurements validate the predicted morphologies, revealing small approximately spherical clusters at lower Pt loadings that evolve into slightly thicker, more planar domains with increased loading. Reactive MD shows hydrogen dissociates predominantly on Pt nanostructures at room temperature, with minimal spillover onto pristine graphene. Furthermore, hydrogen uptake increases with Pt loading at a diminishing rate, while reaction kinetics are significantly faster at lower coverages and rapidly decline with increasing loading. DFT calculations indicate undercoordinated Pt clusters induce $n$-type doping in graphene, which is diminished when hydrogen adsorption depletes Pt electron density, thereby transducing the adsorption events from Pt-surfaces to the Pt-graphene interface. By correlating deposition conditions, nanostructure morphology, and hydrogen sensing dynamics, our findings suggest that moderate Pt loadings can effectively balance sufficient doping with a pronounced Pt-mediated electronic response to graphene. These insights underscore the importance of combining DFT and MLIP simulations with experiments to guide next-generation chemiresistive gas sensor design.

Title: QARPET: A Crossbar Chip for Benchmarking Semiconductor Spin Qubits
Authors: Alberto Tosato, Asser Elsayed, Federico Poggiali, Lucas Stehouwer, Davide Costa, Karina Hudson, Davide Degli Esposti, Giordano Scappucci
Abstract: Large-scale integration of semiconductor spin qubits into industrial quantum processors hinges on the ability to characterize the performance of quantum components at scale. While the semiconductor industry has addressed scalable testing for transistors using device matrix arrays, extending this approach to quantum dot spin qubits is challenged by their operation at sub-kelvin temperatures, in the presence of magnetic fields, and by the use of radio-frequency signals. Here, we present QARPET (Qubit-Array Research Platform for Engineering and Testing), a scalable architecture for characterizing spin qubits using a quantum dot crossbar array with sublinear scaling of interconnects. The crossbar features tightly pitched (1 {\mu}m), individually addressable spin qubit tiles and is implemented in planar germanium, by fabricating a large device with the potential to host 1058 hole spin qubits. We focus our measurements on a patch of 40 tiles and demonstrate key device functionality at millikelvin temperature including unique tile addressability, threshold voltage and charge noise statistics, and characterisation of hole spin qubits and their coherence times in a single tile. These demonstrations pave the way for a new generation of quantum devices designed for the statistical characterisation of spin qubits and for developing automated routines for quantum dot tuning and spin qubit operation.

Title: Contact theorems for electrolyte-filled hollow charged nanoparticles: Non-linear osmotic pressure in confined electrolytes
Authors: Marcelo Lozada-Cassou, Sócrates Aníbal Rivera-Cerecero
Abstract: Analytical expressions for the osmotic pressure of electrolytes confined within electrolyte-filled, hollow, charged nanoparticles are studied using contact theorems for cavity nanoshells immersed in a low-concentration electrolyte. Three shell geometries are considered: planar, cylindrical, and spherical. The nanoparticles are modeled as charged cavities of internal radius R and wall thickness d, and are assumed to be at infinite dilution in the surrounding bulk electrolyte. Numerical calculations of the osmotic pressure are presented as a function of several model parameters. For cylindrical and spherical shells, the osmotic pressure exhibits absolute maxima as a function of shell size. This behavior arises from the competition between the violation of the local electroneutrality condition (VLEC) within the shell cavity and the nonlinear profile of the effective electric field. In contrast, the osmotic pressure of the planar (slit-shell) geometry is a monotonic, nonlinear, decreasing function of cavity width. The results are analyzed in terms of the steric and electrostatic (Maxwell stress tensor) contributions appearing in the corresponding contact theorems. Because the analysis is restricted to low surface charge densities and low electrolyte concentrations, the electric double layers (EDLs) inside and outside the shells are obtained from analytical solutions of the linearized Poisson-Boltzmann equation. We report two novel phenomena: confinement charge reversal (CCR) and confinement overcharging (CO). These arise naturally from the topology of the system. By construction, the confined and bulk electrolytes are maintained at the same chemical potential. These findings have implications for the design of synthetic nanocapsules and ion-selective membranes.

Title: Electron-magnon dynamics triggered by an ultrashort laser pulse: A real-time Dual $GW$ study
Authors: Nagamalleswararao Dasari, Hugo U. R. Strand, Martin Eckstein, Alexander I. Lichtenstein, Evgeny A. Stepanov
Abstract: Ultrafast irradiation of correlated electronic systems triggers complex dynamics involving quasi-particle excitations, doublons, charge carriers, and spin fluctuations. To describe these effects, we develop an efficient non-equilibrium approach, dubbed D-$GW$, that enables a self-consistent treatment of local correlations within dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) and spatial charge and spin fluctuations, that are accounted for simultaneously within a diagrammatic framework. The method is formulated in the real-time domain and provides direct access to single- and two-particle momentum- and energy-dependent response functions without the need for analytical continuation, which is required in Matsubara frequency-based approaches. We apply the D-$GW$ method to investigate the dynamics of a photo-excited extended Hubbard model, the minimal system that simultaneously hosts strong charge and spin fluctuations. Focusing on the challenging parameter regime near the Mott transition, we demonstrate that correlated metals and narrow-gap Mott insulators undergo distinct thermalization processes involving complex energy transfer between single-particle and collective electronic excitations.

Title: Randomly measured quantum particle
Authors: V. Gurarie
Abstract: We consider the motion of a quantum particle whose position is measured in random places at random moments in time. We show that a freely moving particle measured in this way undergoes superdiffusion, while a charged particle moving in a magnetic field confined to the lowest Landau level undergoes conventional diffusion. We also look at a particle moving in one dimensional space in a random time-independent potential, so that it is Anderson localized, which is also measured at random points in space and randomly in time. We find that random measurements break localization and this particle also undergoes diffusion. To address these questions, we develop formalism similar to that employed when studying classical and quantum problems with time-dependent noise.

Title: Magnetic polaron formation in EuZn$_2$P$_2$
Authors: Matthew S. Cook, Elizabeth A. Peterson, Caitlin S. Kengle, E. R. Kennedy, J. Sheeran, Clément Girod, G.S. Freitas, Samuel M. Greer, Peter Abbamonte, P.G. Pagliuso, J. D. Thompson, Sean M. Thomas, P. F. S. Rosa
Abstract: Colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) has been observed across many Eu$^{2+}$-based materials; however, its origin is not completely understood. Here we investigate the antiferromagnetic insulator EuZn$_2$P$_2$ through single crystal x-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, electrical transport, magnetization, dilatometry, and electron spin resonance measurements complemented by density functional theory calculations. Our electrical resistivity data reveal a large negative magnetoresistance, $MR = [R(H)-R(0)]/R(0)$, that reaches $MR = -99.7\%$ at 9~T near the antiferromagnetic ordering temperature $T_N=23\ \text{K}$. Dilatometry measurements show an accompanying field-induced lattice strain. Additionally, Eu$^{2+}$ electron spin resonance reveals a strong ferromagnetic exchange interaction between Eu$^{2+}$ and conduction electrons. Our experimental results in EuZn$_2$P$_2$ are consistent with a magnetic polaron scenario and suggest magnetic polaron formation as a prevailing explanation of CMR in Eu$^{2+}$-based compounds.

Title: Tailoring Charge-Transfer at Metal-Organic Interfaces Using Designer Shockley Surface States
Authors: Anubhab Chakraborty, Oliver L.A. Monti
Abstract: Metal-organic interfaces determine critical processes in organic electronic devices. The frontier molecular orbitals (highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital, HOMO and LUMO) are crucial in determining charge-injection and -collection processes into and from the organic semiconductor films. Here we show that we are able to tune the interfacial electronic structure of a strongly interacting interfacial system formed by adsorption of the electron acceptor 1,4,5,8,9,11-hexaazatriphenylenehexacarbonitrile (HATCN, C18N12) on Ag thin films on Cu(111). The thickness-dependent Shockley surface state emerging on this layered metallic system couples to the LUMO, which allows precise control over the energetic position and filling of the charge-transfer interface state relative to the Fermi level (EF). Our ability to tune the interfacial electronic structure while maintaining the structure of the molecular film represents an important step towards designing organic semiconductor interfaces.

Title: Dial It Down: The Effect of Strongly Interacting Adsorbates on the BiAg2 Rashba Surface State
Authors: Anubhab Chakraborty, Torsten Fritz, Percy Zahl, Oliver L.A. Monti
Abstract: Organic semiconductors interfaced with spin-orbit coupled materials offer a rich playground for fundamental studies of controlling spin dynamics in spintronic devices. The adsorbate-surface interactions at such interfaces play a key role in determining the valence electronic and spin structure and consequently, the device physics as well. Here we present the adsorption and electronic structure of the strong organic electron acceptor 2,7-dinitropyrene-4,5,9,10-tetrone (NO2-PyT, C16H4N2O8) on the Rashba spin-orbit coupled surface alloy BiAg2/Ag(111). We show that the strong adsorbate-surface alloy interaction leads to weakening of the electronic coupling between the surface alloy atoms and quench the spin-orbit coupled surface state in BiAg2/Ag(111). Our findings demonstrate an important challenge associated with using molecular adsorbates to tailor the spin polarization in BiAg2/Ag(111), and our work provides guidelines to consider while designing interfacial systems to engineer the spin polarization in Rashba surface alloys.

Title: Towards "on-demand" van der Waals epitaxy with hpc-driven online ensemble sampling
Authors: Soumendu Bagchi, Ankita Biswas, Prasanna V. Balachandran, Ayana Ghosh, Panchapakesan Ganesh
Abstract: Traditional approaches to achieve targeted epitaxial growth involves exploring a vast parameter space of thermodynamical and kinetic drivers (e.g., temperature, pressure, chemical potential etc). This tedious and time-consuming approach becomes particularly cumbersome to accelerate synthesis and characterization of novel materials with complex dependencies on local chemical environment, temperature and lattice-strains, specifically nanoscale heterostructures of layered 2D materials. We combine the strength of next generation supercomputers at the extreme scale, machine learning and classical molecular dynamics simulations within an adaptive real time closed-loop virtual environment steered by Bayesian optimization to enable asynchronous ensemble sampling of the synthesis space, and apply it to the recrystallization phenomena of amorphous transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) bilayer to form stack moiré heterostructures under various growth parameters. We show that such asynchronous ensemble sampling frameworks for materials simulations can be promising towards achieving on-demand epitaxy of van der Waals stacked moiré devices, paving the way towards a robust autonomous materials synthesis pipeline to enable unprecedented discovery of new functionalities.

Title: Fast and direct preparation of a genuine lattice BEC via the quantum Mpemba effect
Authors: Philipp Westhoff, Sebastian Paeckel, Mattia Moroder
Abstract: We present an efficient method for dissipatively preparing a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) directly on a lattice, avoiding the need for a two-staged preparation procedure currently used in ultracold atom platforms. Our protocol is based on driving the lattice-subsystem into a non-equilibrium steady state, which we show to exhibit a lattice analog of a true BEC, where the depletion can be controlled via the dissipation strength. Furthermore, exploiting a symmetry-based Mpemba effect, we analytically identify a class of simple, experimentally-realizable states that converge exponentially faster to the steady state than typical random initializations. We also show how to tune the momentum of the created high-fidelity BEC by combining superfluid immersion with lattice shaking. Our theoretical predictions are confirmed by numerical simulations of the dissipative dynamics, quantitatively assessing the speedups yielded by our protocol, as well as the fidelities of the prepared BEC.

Title: Thermoelectric transport through a Majorana zero modes interferometer
Authors: Alejandro P. Garrido, David Zambrano, Juan Pablo ramos, Pedro Orellana
Abstract: In this study, we examine the thermoelectric characteristics of a system consisting of two topological superconducting nanowires, each exhibiting Majorana zero modes at their ends, connected to leads within an interferometer configuration. By employing Green's function formalism, we derive the spectral properties and transport coefficients. Our findings indicate that bound states in the continuum (BICs) manifest in symmetric setups, influenced by the length of the wires and coupling parameters. Deviations of the magnetic flux from specific values transform BICs into quasi-BICs with finite width, resulting in conductance antiresonances. The existence and interplay of Majorana zero modes enhance thermoelectric performance in asymmetric configurations. Modulating the magnetic flux transitions BICs into quasi-BICs significantly enhances the Seebeck coefficient and figure of merit, thereby proposing a strategy for optimizing thermoelectric efficiency in systems based on Majorana zero modes.

Title: Cross-functional transferability in universal machine learning interatomic potentials
Authors: Xu Huang, Bowen Deng, Peichen Zhong, Aaron D. Kaplan, Kristin A. Persson, Gerbrand Ceder
Abstract: The rapid development of universal machine learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs) has demonstrated the possibility for generalizable learning of the universal potential energy surface. In principle, the accuracy of uMLIPs can be further improved by bridging the model from lower-fidelity datasets to high-fidelity ones. In this work, we analyze the challenge of this transfer learning problem within the CHGNet framework. We show that significant energy scale shifts and poor correlations between GGA and r$^2$SCAN pose challenges to cross-functional data transferability in uMLIPs. By benchmarking different transfer learning approaches on the MP-r$^2$SCAN dataset of 0.24 million structures, we demonstrate the importance of elemental energy referencing in the transfer learning of uMLIPs. By comparing the scaling law with and without the pre-training on a low-fidelity dataset, we show that significant data efficiency can still be achieved through transfer learning, even with a target dataset of sub-million structures. We highlight the importance of proper transfer learning and multi-fidelity learning in creating next-generation uMLIPs on high-fidelity data.

Title: Entropic modulation of divalent cation transport through porous two-dimensional materials
Authors: Yechan Noh, Demian Riccardi, Alex Smolyanitsky
Abstract: Aqueous cations permeate subnanoscale pores in two-dimensional materials by crossing free energy barriers dominated by competing enthalpic contributions from transiently decreased ion-solvent and increased ion-pore electrostatic interactions. This commonly accepted view is rooted in the studies of \textit{monovalent} cation transport. Divalent cations, however, have significantly higher desolvation costs, requiring considerably larger pores to enable retention of the first hydration shell and subsequently transport. We show that this scenario gives rise to a strong enthalpy-entropy competition. More specifically, the first hydration shell is shown to undergo rotational ordering inside the pore, resulting in a tight transition state with an entropic cost of order $9k_BT$. Our results shed light on the basic mechanisms of transport barrier formation for aqueous divalent cations permeating nanoporous 2D membranes.

Title: Electron-Hole Separation Dynamics and Optoelectronic Properties of a PCE10:FOIC Blend
Authors: G. Ammirati, S. Turchini, F. Toschi, P. O Keeffe, A. Paladini, G. Mattioli, P. Moras, P. M. Sheverdyaeva, V. Milotti, C. J. Brabec, M. Wagner, I. McCulloch, A. Di Carlo, D. Catone
Abstract: Understanding charge separation dynamics in organic semiconductor blends is crucial for optimizing the performance of organic photovoltaic solar cells. In this study, we explored the optoelectronic properties and charge separation dynamics of a PCE10:FOIC blend, by combining steady-state and time-resolved spectroscopies with high-level DFT calculations. Femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy revealed a significant reduction of the exciton-exciton annihilation recombination rate in the acceptor when incorporated into the blend, compared to its pristine form. This reduction was attributed to a decrease in exciton density within the acceptor, driven by an efficient hole-separation process that was characterized by following the temporal evolution of the transient signals associated with the excited states of the donor when the acceptor was selectively excited within the blend. The analysis of these dynamics enabled the estimation of the hole separation time constant from the acceptor to the donor, yielding a time constant of (1.3 +- 0.3) ps. Additionally, this study allowed the quantification of exciton diffusion and revealed a charge separation efficiency of approximately 60%, providing valuable insights for the design of next-generation organic photovoltaic materials with enhanced charge separation and improved device efficiency.

Title: Interfacial Heat Transport via Evanescent Radiation by Hot Electrons
Authors: William D. Hutchins, Saman Zare, Mehran Habibzadeh, Sheila Edalatpour, Patrick E. Hopkins
Abstract: We predict an additional thermal transport pathway across metal/non-metal interfaces with large electron-phonon non-equilibrium via evanescent radiative heat transfer. In such systems, electron scattering processes vary drastically and can be leveraged to guide heat across interfaces via radiative heat transport without engaging the lattice directly. We employ the formalism of fluctuational electrodynamics to simulate the spectral radiative heat flux across the interface of a metal film and a non-metal substrate. We find that the radiative conductance can exceed 300 MW m$^{-2}$ K$^{-1}$ at an electron temperature of 5000 K for an emitting tungsten film on a hexagonal boron nitride substrate, becoming comparable to its conductive counterpart. This allows for a more holistic approach to the heat flow across interfaces, accounting for electron-phonon non-equilibrium and ultrafast near-field phonon-polariton coupling.

Title: Synthesis, crystal and electronic structures, and second harmonic generation of La 4Ge 3S12
Authors: Hiroya Ohtsuki, Suguru Nakata, Yu Yamane, Ryunosuke Takahashi, Koichi Kusakabe, Hiroki Wadati
Abstract: The crystal structure of La 4 Ge 3S 12 has been known to be noncentrosymmetric for almost four decades. This characteristic inversion symmetry breaking suggests the presence of nonlinear optical properties. Yet only recently have nonlinear optical phenomena such as second harmonic generation (SHG) been reported in this material. In this study, we synthesized La4Ge3S12 using the direct reaction method and characterized the composition, crystal structure, and electronic structure using electron probe microanalysis, powder and single-crystal X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The experimentally measured electronic structure is in line with that obtained using first-principles calculations. In addition, we observed the nonlinear optical properties of La4Ge3S12 in response to an ultrashort infrared pulsed laser. We found that the intensity of the SHG depends quadratically on the intensity of the incident light, mirroring the intrinsic nature of nonlinear optics.

Title: Influence of doping on non-equilibrium carrier dynamics in graphene
Authors: Leonard Weigl, Johannes Gradl, Peter Richter, Thomas Seyller, Domenica Convertino, Stiven Forti, Camilla Coletti, Isabella Gierz
Abstract: Controlling doping is key to optimizing graphene for high-speed electronic and optoelectronic devices. However, its impact on non-equilibrium carrier lifetimes remains debated. Here, we systematically tune the doping level of quasi-freestanding epitaxial graphene on SiC(0001) via potassium deposition and probe its ultrafast carrier dynamics directly in the band structure using time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (trARPES). We find that increased doping lowers both the peak electronic temperature and the cooling rate of Dirac carriers, which we attribute to higher electronic heat capacity and reduced phonon emission phase space. Comparing quasi-freestanding graphene with graphene on a carbon buffer layer reveals faster relaxation in the latter, likely due to additional phonon modes being available for heat dissipation. These findings offer new insights for optimizing graphene in electronic and photonic technologies.

Title: Limitations of the $g$-tensor formalism of semiconductor spin qubits
Authors: Zoltán György, András Pályi, Gábor Széchenyi
Abstract: The $g$-tensor formalism is a powerful method for describing the electrical driving of semiconductor spin qubits. However, up to now, this technique has only been applied to the simplest qubit dynamics, resonant monochromatic driving by a single gate. Here we study the description of (i) monochromatic driving using two driving gates and bichromatic driving via (ii) one or (iii) two gates. Assuming a general Hamiltonian with qubit states well separated from excited orbital states, we find that when (i) two driving gates are used for monochromatic driving or (ii) a single one for bichromatic, the $g$-tensor formalism successfully captures the leading-order dynamics. We express the Rabi frequency and the Bloch-Siegert shift using the $g$-tensor and its first and second derivatives with respect to the gate voltage. However, when (iii) bichromatic driving is realized using two distinct driving gates, we see a breakdown of $g$-tensor formalism: the Rabi frequency cannot be expressed using the $g$-tensor and its derivatives. We find that beyond the $g$-tensor and its derivatives, three additional parameters are needed to capture the dynamics. We demonstrate our general results by assuming an electron (hole) confined in a circular quantum dot, subjected to Rashba spin-orbit interaction.

Title: Dispersion-corrected Machine Learning Potentials for 2D van der Waals Materials
Authors: Mikkel Ohm Sauer, Peder Meisner Lyngby, Kristian Sommer Thygesen
Abstract: Machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) based on message passing neural networks hold promise to enable large-scale atomistic simulations of complex materials with ab initio accuracy. A number of MLIPs trained on energies and forces from density functional theory (DFT) calculations employing semi-local exchange-correlation (xc) functionals have recently been introduced. Here, we benchmark the performance of six dispersion-corrected MLIPs on a dataset of van der Waals heterobilayers containing between 4 and 300 atoms in the moiré cell. Using various structure similarity metrics, we compare the relaxed heterostructures to the ground truth DFT results. With some notable exceptions, the model precisions are comparable to the uncertainty on the DFT results stemming from the choice of xc-functional. We further explore how the structural inaccuracies propagate to the electronic properties, and find excellent performance with average errors on band energies as low as 35 meV. Our results demonstrate that recent MLIPs after dispersion corrections are on par with DFT for general vdW heterostructures, and thus justify their application to complex and experimentally relevant 2D materials.

Title: Magnetic Memory Driven by Orbital Current
Authors: Jingkai Xu, Dongxing Zheng, Meng Tang, Bin He, Man Yang, Hao Li, Yan Li, Aitian Chen, Senfu Zhang, Ziqiang Qiu, Xixiang Zhang
Abstract: Spin-orbitronics, based on both spin and orbital angular momentum, presents a promising pathway for energy-efficient memory and logic devices. Recent studies have demonstrated the emergence of orbital currents in light transition metals such as Ti, Cr, and Zr, broadening the scope of spin-orbit torque (SOT). In particular, the orbital Hall effect, which arises independently of spin-obit coupling, has shown potential for enhancing torque efficiency in spintronic devices. However, the direct integration of orbital current into magnetic random-access memory (MRAM) remains unexplored. In this work, we design a light metal/heavy metal/ferromagnet multilayer structure and experimentally demonstrate magnetization switching by orbital current. Furthermore, we have realized a robust SOT-MRAM cell by incorporating a reference layer that is pinned by a synthetic antiferromagnetic structure. We observed a tunnel magnetoresistance of 66%, evident in both magnetic field and current-driven switching processes. Our findings underscore the potential for employing orbital current in designing next-generation spintronic devices.

Title: Space-averaged non-equilibrium Green's function approach for quantum transport in 3D
Authors: Vahid Mosallanejad, Kuei-Lin Chiu, Wenjie Dou
Abstract: The non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) approach offers a practical framework for simulating various phenomena in mesoscopic systems. As the dimension of electronic devices shrinks to just a few nanometers, the need for new effective-mass based 3D implementations of NEGF has become increasingly apparent. This work extends our previous Finite-Volume implementation -- originally developed for the self-consistent solution of the Schrödinger and Poisson equations in 2D -- into a full 3D NEGF framework. Our implementation begins with exploring a few problems with the common textbook Finite Difference implementations of NEGF. We then concisely demonstrate how Finite-Volume discretization addresses few key implementation challenges. Importantly, we explain how this type of discretization enables evaluating the self-energies, which account for the effects of reservoirs. The potential applications of this new method are illustrated through two examples. We anticipate that this implementation will be broadly applicable to open quantum systems, especially in cases where a fully three-dimensional domain is essential.

Title: X-ray Strain and Stress Tensor Tomography
Authors: Peter Modregger, James. A.D. Ball, Felix Wittwer, Ahmar Khaliq, Jonathan Wright
Abstract: The microscopic distribution of strain and stress plays a crucial role for the performance, safety, and lifetime of components in aeronautics, automotive and critical infrastructure [1]. While non-destructive methods for measuring the stress close to the surface have long been long established, only a limited number of approaches for depth-resolved measurements based on x-rays or neutrons are available [2]. These feature significant limitations, including long scan times, intricate experimental set-ups, limited spatial resolution or anisotropic gauge volumes with aspect ratios of 1:10 or worse. Here, we present a method that overcomes these limitations and obtains tomographic reconstructions of the full six-dimensional strain and stress tensor components. Using a simple and wide spread experimental set-up that combines x-ray powder diffraction with single axis tomography, we achieve non-destructive determination of depth-resolved strain and stress distributions with isotropic resolution. The presented method could be of interest for additive manufacturing of metals [3,4], battery research [5], in-situ metallurgy [6] and the experimental validation of finite element simulations [7].

Title: Work statistics and thermal phase transitions
Authors: Kwai-Kong Ng, Min-Fong Yang
Abstract: The investigation of nonequilibrium thermodynamics in quantum many-body systems underscores the importance of quantum work, which differs from its classical counterpart due to its statistical nature. Recent studies have shown that quantum work can serve as an effective indicator of quantum phase transitions in systems subjected to sudden quenches. However, the potential of quantum work to identify thermal phase transitions remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we examine several types of thermal phase transitions in a sudden-quench hard-core boson model, including Ising, three-state Potts, and Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transitions. Through finite-size scaling analysis, we conclude that work statistics can also characterize the critical behaviors of thermal phase transitions in generic many-body systems. Our investigation paves the way for applying work statistics to characterize critical behavior in many-body systems, with implications that may extend to broader contexts.

Title: Evanescent Orbital Pumping by Magnetization Dynamics Without Spin-Orbit Coupling
Authors: Chengyuan Cai, Hanchen Wang, Tao Yu
Abstract: Converting magnetization spin to orbital current often relies on strong spin-orbit interaction that may cause additional angular momentum dissipation. We report that coherent magnetization dynamics in magnetic nanostructures can evanescently pump an orbital current into adjacent semiconductors due to the Zeeman coupling between its stray magnetic field and electron orbitals without relying on spin-orbit interaction. The underlying photonic spin of the AC magnetic field governs the orbital polarization that flows along the gradient of the driven field. Due to the orbital texture, the orbital Hall current that flows perpendicularly to the gradient of the AC field is also generated and does not suffer from the orbital torque. These findings extend the paradigm of orbital pumping to include photonic spin and pave the way for developing low-dissipation orbitronic devices.

Title: Work probability distribution of weakly driven process in overdamped dynamics
Authors: Pierre Nazé
Abstract: Analytical work probability distributions for open classical systems are scarce; they can only be calculated in a few examples. In this work, I present a new method to derive such quantities for weakly driven processes in the overdamped regime for any switching time. The white noise Brownian motion in a harmonic linear stiffening trap illustrates the result. The work probability distribution is non-tabulated, with positive, semi-finite support, diverging at the minimal value, and non-Gaussian. An analysis of the range of validity of linear response is made by using the self-consistent criterion of the fluctuation-dissipation relation. The first, second, third, and fourth moments are correctly calculated for small perturbations.

Title: Exact results for spin glass criticality
Authors: Gesualdo Delfino
Abstract: In recent years scale invariant scattering theory provided the first exact access to the magnetic critical properties of two-dimensional statistical systems with quenched disorder. We show how the theory extends to the overlap variables entering the characterization of spin glass properties. The resulting exact fixed point equations yield both the magnetic and, for the first time, the spin glass renormalization group fixed points. For the case of the random bond Ising model, on which we focus, the spin glass subspace of solutions is found to contain a line of fixed points. We discuss the implications of the results for Ising spin glass criticality and compare with the available numerical results.

Title: Structural and Electrical Transport Properties of NASICON type Na$_{3}$Zr$_{2-x}$Ti$_{x}$Si$_2$PO$_{\rm 12}$ ($x=$ 0.1-0.4) Solid Electrolyte Materials
Authors: Ramcharan Meena, Rajendra S. Dhaka
Abstract: We report the structural, resistivity, impedance, and dielectric studies of isovalent substituted Na$_{3}$Zr$_{2-x}$Ti$_{x}$Si$_2$PO$_{\rm 12}$ ($x=$ 0.1--0.4) NASICON type solid electrolyte materials. The Rietveld refinement of XRD patterns shows the monoclinic phase with space group of C 2/c for all the samples. The resistivity analysis shows the Arrhenius-type thermal conduction with an increase in activation energy with doping is explained based on decreased unit cell volume. We use Maxwell-Wagner-Sillars (MWS) relaxation and space charge or interfacial polarization models to explain the frequency and temperature-dependent variations of electric permittivity. The double relaxation peaks in the dielectric loss data show the two types of relaxation mechanisms of different activation energy. The real ($\epsilon^{'}$) and imaginary ($\epsilon^{''}$) parts of permittivity are fitted using the modified Cole-Cole equation, including the conductivity term, which show the non-Debye type relaxation over the measured frequency and temperature range. The impedance analysis shows the contributions from grain and grain boundary relaxation. The fitting performed using the impedance and constant-phase element (CPE) confirm the non-Debye type relaxation. Moreover, the electric modulus analysis confirms the ionic nature having thermally activated relaxation and the modulus scaling analysis shows a similar type of relaxation in the measured temperature range. The modified power law is used to understand the frequency dependence of {\it a.c.} conductivity data. The temperature dependence of exponent ($s$) in modified power law suggests the change in the conduction mechanism from near small polaron tunneling (NSPT) to correlated barrier hopping (CBH) above room temperature. The larger values of $\epsilon$$_{r}$ indicate these materials as a potential candidate for charge-storage devices.

Title: Gate-tunable hot electron extraction in a two-dimensional semiconductor heterojunction
Authors: Chenran Xu, Chen Xu, Jichen Zhou, Zhexu Shan, Wenjian Su, Wenbing Li, Xingqi Xu, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Shiyao Zhu, Da-Wei Wang, Yanhao Tang
Abstract: Hot carrier solar cells (HCSCs), harvesting excess energy of the hot carriers generated by above-band-gap photoexcitation, is crucial for pushing the solar cell efficiency beyond the Shockley Queisser limit, which is challenging to realize mainly due to fast hot-carrier cooling. By performing transient reflectance spectroscopy in a MoSe2/hBN/WS2 junction, we demonstrate the gate-tunable harvest of hot electrons from MoSe2 to WS2. By spectrally distinguishing hot-electron extraction from lattice temperature increase, we find that electrostatically doped electrons in MoSe2 can boost hot-electron extraction density (n_ET) by factor up to several tens. Such enhancement arises from interaction between hot excitons and doped electrons, which converts the excess energy of hot excitons to excitations of the Fermi sea and hence generates hot electrons. Moreover, n_ET can be further enhanced by reducing the conduction band offset with external electric field. Our results provide in-depth insights into design of HCSCs with electrostatic strategies.

Title: Tunable spin-orbit splitting in bilayer graphene/WSe$_2$ quantum devices
Authors: Jonas D. Gerber, Efe Ersoy, Michele Masseroni, Markus Niese, Michael Laumer, Artem O. Denisov, Hadrien Duprez, Wei Wister Huang, Christoph Adam, Lara Ostertag, Chuyao Tong, Takashi Taniguchi, Kenji Watanabe, Vladimir I. Fal'ko, Thomas Ihn, Klaus Ensslin, Angelika Knothe
Abstract: Bilayer graphene (BLG)-based quantum devices represent a promising platform for emerging technologies such as quantum computing and spintronics. However, their intrinsically weak spin-orbit coupling (SOC) presents a challenge for spin and valley manipulation, as these applications operate more efficiently in the presence of strong SOC. Integrating BLG with transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) significantly enhances SOC via proximity effects. While this enhancement has been experimentally demonstrated in 2D-layered structures, 1D and 0D-nanostructures in BLG/TMD remain unrealized, with open questions regarding device quality, SOC strength, and tunability. In this work, we investigate quantum point contacts and quantum dots in two BLG/WSe$_2$ heterostructures with different stacking orders. Across multiple devices, we demonstrate a reproducible enhancement of spin-orbit splitting ($\Delta_\mathrm{SO}$) reaching values of up to $1.5\mathrm{meV}$ - more than one order of magnitude higher than in pristine bilayer graphene ($\Delta_\mathrm{SO}=40-80\mu\mathrm{eV}$). Furthermore, we show that the induced SOC can be tuned in situ from its maximum value to near-complete suppression by varying the perpendicular electric field, thereby controlling layer polarization. This enhancement and in situ tunability establish SOC as an efficient control mechanism for dynamic spin and valley manipulation.

Title: Multipolar Phase Transition in the 4$f^2$ fcc lattice compound PrCdNi$_{4}$
Authors: Yuka Kusanose, Yasuyuki Shimura, Kazunori Umeo, Naomi Kawata, Toshiro Takabatake, Taichi Terashima, Naoki Kikugawa, Takako Konoike, Yuya Hattori, Kazuhiro Nawa, Hung-Cheng Wu, Taku J Sato, Takahiro Onimaru
Abstract: Transport and magnetic properties of a 4$f^{2}$ fcc lattice compound, PrCdNi$_4$, were studied. The magnetic susceptibility, $\chi(T)$, follows the Curie--Weiss law from 300 K to 20 K, as expected for a free Pr$^{3+}$ ion. As the temperature decreases below 5 K, $\chi(T)$ approaches a constant, indicating van-Vleck paramagnetic behavior. The specific heat, $C(T)$, displays a broad shoulder at around 4 K, which can be reproduced by a doublet triplet two-level model with an energy gap of 12 K. These results suggest a non-magnetic $\Gamma_3$ doublet ground state of the Pr$^{3+}$ ion in the cubic crystalline electric field. $C(T)$ exhibits a peak at $T_{\rm O}$ = 1.0 K and this peak remains robust against magnetic fields up to 5 T. In powder neutron diffraction measurements, no magnetic reflection was observed at 0.32 K $<$ $T_{\rm O}$. Two anomalies at $B$ = 2.1 and 5.3 T in magnetoresistance $\rho(B)$ at 0.05 K likely originate from switching in the order parameter. These results suggest that the phase transition at $T_{\rm O}$ is ascribed to an antiferro-type order of the electric quadrupole or magnetic octupole of the $\Gamma_3$ doublet in the 4$f^2$ fcc lattice.

Title: Inverse Design of Parameter-Controlled Disclination Paths
Authors: Yehonatan Tsubery, Hillel Aharoni
Abstract: Topological defects, such as disclination lines in nematic liquid crystals, are fundamental to many physical systems and applications. In this work, we study the behavior of nematic disclinations in thin parallel-plate geometries with strong patterned planar anchoring. Building on prior models, we solve both the forward problem -- predicting disclination trajectories from given surface patterns -- and an extended inverse problem -- designing surface patterns to produce a tunable family of disclination curves under varying system parameters. We present an explicit calculation for pattern construction, analyze parameter limitations and stability constraints, and highlight experimental and technological applications.

Title: Learning strategies for optimised fitness in a model of cyclic dominance
Authors: Honghao Yu, Robert L. Jack
Abstract: A major problem in evolutionary biology is how species learn and adapt under the constraint of environmental conditions and competition of other species. Models of cyclic dominance provide simplified settings in which such questions can be addressed using methods from theoretical physics. We investigate how a privileged ("smart") species optimises its population by adopting advantageous strategies in one such model. We use a reinforcement learning algorithm, which successfully identifies optimal strategies based on a survival-of-the-weakest effect, including directional incentives to avoid predators. We also characterise the steady-state behaviour of the system in the presence of the smart species and compare with the symmetric case where all species are equivalent.

Title: Comparative Investigation of MAPbBr$_x$I$_{1-x}$ and SbH$_4$Br$_x$I$_{1-x}$ Perovskites: Electronic and Structural Properties
Authors: Veysel Çelik
Abstract: This paper comparatively investigates the structural and electronic properties of hybrid perovskites MAPbBr$_x$I$_{1-x}$ and SbH$_4$PbBr$_x$I$_{1-x}$ by means of DFT-based calculations. The main aim is to check if the increase in band gap due to substitution of I$^-$ ions with Br$^-$ ions can be overcome by introducing the inorganic SbH$_4^+$ cation. Since the Br$^-$ ions merely enhance structural stability of the perovskite framework and SbH$_4^+$ not only sustains that stability but also reduces the band gap to nearly ideal values and thereby improves electronic performance, these are the leading candidates among them. Of them, the reduced band gap SbH$_4$PbI$_3$ ($\sim$1.37 eV) and the perfectly matched SbH$_4$PbBrI$_2$ with its band gap being exactly 1.51 eV are top prospects for being stable and having high-efficiency solar cell applications. The findings show that SbH$_4^+$-based perovskites have potential for future photovoltaic devices.

Title: Theory of scanning tunneling spectroscopy beyond one-electron molecular orbitals: can we image molecular orbitals?
Authors: Manish Kumar, Diego Soler, Marco Lozano, Enzo Monino, Libor Veis, Pavel Jelinek
Abstract: The interpretation of experimental spatially resolved scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) maps of close-shell molecules on surfaces is usually interpreted within the framework of oneelectron molecular orbitals. Although this standard practice often gives relatively good agreement with experimental data, it contradicts one of the basic assumptions of quantum mechanics, postulating the impossibility of direct observation of the wavefunction, i.e., individual molecular orbitals. The scanning probe community often considers this contradiction about observing molecular orbitals as a philosophical question rather than a genuine problem. Moreover, in the case of polyradical strongly correlated molecules, the interpretation of STS maps based on one-electron molecular orbitals often fails. Thus, for a precise interpretation of STS maps and their connection to the electronic structure of molecules, a theoretical description, including non-equilibrium tunneling processes going beyond one-electron process, is required. In this contribution, we first show why, in selected cases, it is possible to achieve good agreement with experimental data based on one-electron canonical molecular orbitals and Tersoff-Hamann approximation. Next, we will show that for an accurate interpretation of strongly correlated molecules, it is necessary to describe the process of removing/adding an electron within the formalism of many-electron wavefunctions for the neutral and charged states. This can be accomplished by the concept of so-called Dyson orbitals.

Title: Phonon mediated spin polarization in a one-dimensional Aubry-Andre-Harper chain
Authors: Moumita Mondal, Santanu K. Maiti
Abstract: A comparative study of electronic transport and spin polarization between clean and Aubry-Andre-Harper chains in the presence of electron-electron (e-e) and electron-phonon (e-ph) interactions is presented. The entire system is simulated within a tight-binding framework based on the Hubbard-Holstein model. Transmission probability and spin polarization are evaluated using the Green's function method under the Hartree-Fock mean-field approximation through a self-consistent procedure. The transmission profile is found to be consistent with the band structure, which is also discussed. An overall enhancement of spin polarization induced by e-ph interaction is reported for the first time, to the best of our knowledge. Our analysis may be useful for studying controlled spin-selective electron transmission in the presence of e-ph coupling.

Title: Testing the parquet equations and the U(1) Ward identity for real-frequency correlation functions from the multipoint numerical renormalization group
Authors: Nepomuk Ritz, Anxiang Ge, Markus Frankenbach, Mathias Pelz, Jan von Delft, Fabian B. Kugler
Abstract: Recently, it has become possible to compute real-frequency four-point correlation functions of quantum impurity models using a multipoint extension of the numerical renormalization group (mpNRG). In this work, we perform several numerical consistency checks of the output of mpNRG by investigating exact relations between two- and four-point functions. This includes the Bethe-Salpeter equations and the Schwinger-Dyson equation from the parquet formalism, which we evaluate in two formally identical but numerically nonequivalent ways. We also study the first-order U(1) Ward identity between the vertex and the self-energy, which we derive for the first time in full generality in the real-frequency Keldysh formalism. We generally find good agreement of all relations, often up to a few percent, both at weak and at strong interaction.

Title: The Interconnection Tensor Rank and the Neural Network Storage Capacity
Authors: Boris V. Kryzhanovsky
Abstract: Neural network properties are considered in the case of the interconnection tensor rank being higher than two. This sort of interconnection tensor occurs in realization of crossbar-based neural networks. It is intrinsic for a crossbar design to suffer from parasitic currents. It is shown that the interconnection tensor of a certain form makes the neural network much more efficient: the storage capacity and basin of attraction of the network increase considerably. A network like the Hopfield one is used in the study.

Title: Multi-modal strain mapping of steel crack tips with micrometer spatial resolution
Authors: Ahmar Khaliq, Felix Wittwer, Markus Hartmann, Matthias Thimm, Robert Brandt, Dennis Brueckner, Jan Garrevoet, Gerald Falkenberg, Peter Modregger
Abstract: Due to their superior fatigue strength, martensitic steels are the material of choice for high cyclic loading applications such as coil springs. However, crack propagation is influenced by residual stresses and their interaction is poorly understood. In fact, Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics predicts un-physical singularities in the strain around the crack tip. In this study, we have combined synchrotron-based x-ray diffraction, x-ray fluorescence, and optical microscopy to map the factual strain fields around crack tips with micrometer spatial resolution. X-ray fluorescence and optical images were co-registered to locate the crack in the x-ray diffraction maps. Observed crystal recovery close to cracks confirmed that the diffraction signal originates at least in parts from the cracks. The retrieved local strain field around the crack was further improved by averaging information over carefully selected diffraction peaks. This procedure provided strain maps around crack tips with a spatial resolution of about 1 micro meter and enabled a prediction of further crack growth.

Title: Contrasting magnetism in VPS3 and CrI3 monolayers with the common honeycomb S = 3/2 spin lattice
Authors: Ke Yang, Yueyue Ning, Yaozhenghang Ma, Yuxuan Zhou, Hua Wu
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) magnetic materials are promising candidates for spintronics and quantum technologies. One extensively studied example is the ferromagnetic (FM) CrI$_3$ monolayer with the honeycomb Cr$^{3+}$ ($t_{2g}^3$, $S$ = 3/2) spin lattice, while VPS$_3$ has a same honeycomb $S$ = 3/2 spin lattice (V$^{2+}$, $t_{2g}^3$) but displays N$\acute{e}$el antiferromagnetism (AFM). In this work, we study the electronic structure and particularly the contrasting magnetism of VPS$_3$ and CrI$_3$ monolayers. We find that VPS$_3$ is a Mott-Hubbard insulator but CrI$_3$ is a charge-transfer insulator, and therefore their magnetic exchange mechanisms are essentially different. The first nearest-neighbor (1NN) direct $d$-$d$ exchange dominates in VPS$_3$, thus leading to a strong antiferromagnetic (AF) coupling. However, the formation of vanadium vacancies, associated with instability of the low-valence V$^{2+}$ ions, suppresses the AF coupling and thus strongly reduces the N$\acute{e}$el temperature ($T_{\text{N}}$) in line with the experimental observation. In contrast, our results reveal that the major 1NN $d$-$p$-$d$ superexchanges in CrI$_3$ via different channels give rise to competing FM and AF couplings, ultimately resulting in a weak FM coupling as observed experimentally. After revisiting several important superexchange channels reported in the literature, based on our MLWFs and tight-binding analyses, we note that some antiphase contributions must be subtly and simultaneously considered, and thus we provide a deeper insight into the FM coupling of CrI$_3$. Moreover, we identify and compare the major contributions to the magnetic anisotropy, i.e., a weak shape anisotropy in VPS$_3$ and a relatively strong exchange anisotropy in CrI$_3$.

Title: Langevin dynamics with generalized time-reversal symmetry
Authors: Dario Lucente, Marco Baldovin, Massimiliano Viale, Angelo Vulpiani
Abstract: When analyzing the equilibrium properties of a stochastic process, identifying the parity of the variables under time-reversal is imperative. This initial step is required to assess the presence of detailed balance, and to compute the entropy production rate, which is, otherwise, ambiguously defined. In this work we deal with stochastic processes whose underlying time-reversal symmetry cannot be reduced to the usual parity rules (namely, flip of the momentum sign). We provide a systematic method to build equilibrium Langevin dynamics starting from their reversible deterministic counterparts: this strategy can be applied, in particular, to all stable one-dimensional Hamiltonian dynamics, exploiting the time-reversal symmetry unveiled in the action-angle framework. The case of the Lotka-Volterra model is discussed as an example. We also show that other stochastic versions of this system violate time-reversal symmetry and are, therefore, intrinsically out of equilibrium.

Title: Odd-parity ground state in dilute Yu-Shiba-Rusinov dimers and chains
Authors: Lisa M. Rütten, Harald Schmid, Werner M. J. van Weerdenburg, Eva Liebhaber, Kai Rossnagel, Katharina J. Franke
Abstract: Magnetic adatoms on superconductors induce Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states, which are key to the design of low-dimensional correlated systems and topological superconductivity. Competing magnetic interactions and superconducting pairing lead to a rich phase diagram. Using a scanning tunneling microscope (STM), we position Fe atoms on 2H-NbSe$_2$ to build a dimer with an odd-parity ground state, i.e., a partially screened YSR channel with the hybridized states spanning the Fermi level. This ground state makes the dimer a promising precursor for a topological YSR chain. By adding one atom at a time, we track the formation of YSR bands. The lowest-energy band crosses the Fermi level and we find strong site-dependent spectral variations especially at the chain's terminations. We attribute these features to quantum spin effects and ferromagnetic coupling influenced by the local chemical environment, rather than topological superconductivity or Majorana modes.

Title: 3D evolution of protein networks and lipid globules in heat-treated egg yolk
Authors: Felix Wittwer, Nimmi Das Anthuparambil, Frederik Unger, Randeer Pratap Gautam, Silja Flenner, Imke Greving, Christian Gutt, Peter Modregger
Abstract: Upon heating, egg yolk transforms from a liquid to a gel due to protein denaturation. This process can serve as a useful model to better understand protein denaturation in general. Using x-ray holographic tomography, we investigated the structural changes in egg yolk during boiling without the need for complex sample fixation or drying. Our results reveal a developing separation between proteins and lipids, with fatty components rapidly aggregating into large globules that subsequently evolve into bubbles.

Title: Exchange-Biased multi-ring Planar Hall Magnetoresistive Sensors with nT resolution in Non-Shielded Environments
Authors: Jan Schmidtpeter, Proloy Taran Das, Yevhen Zabila, Conrad Schubert, Thomas Gundrum, Thomas Wondrak, Denys Makarov
Abstract: Planar Hall magnetoresistive sensors (PHMR) are promising candidates for various magnetic sensing applications due to their high sensitivity, low power consumption, and compatibility with integrated circuit technology. However, their performance is often limited by inherent noise sources, impacting their resolution and overall sensitivity. Here the effect of three bilayer structures NiFe(10 nm)/IrMn(10 nm), NiFe(30 nm)/IrMn(10 nm), and NiFe(30 nm)/IrMn(20 nm) on noise levels is investigated at low-frequency (DC - 25 Hz). This study includes a detailed investigation on the optimization process and noise characteristics of multiring PHMR sensors, focusing on identifying and quantifying the dominant noise sources. The experimental measurements are complemented by a theoretical analysis of noise sources including thermal noise, 1/f noise, intermixing and environmental noise. The best magnetic resolution is observed for the NiFe(30 nm)/IrMn(10 nm) structure, which achieves a detectivity below 1.5 nT/sqrt(Hz) at 10 Hz in a non-shielded environment at room temperature. In addition, a substantial improvement in sensitivity is observed by annealing the sensors at 250 deg C for 1 hour. The findings of this study contribute to a deeper understanding of noise behavior in PHMR sensors, paving the way for developing strategies to improve their performance for demanding sensing applications at low frequencies.

Title: Characteristic exciton energy scales in antiferromagnetic NiPS$_3$
Authors: Jacob A. Warshauer, Huyongqing Chen, Qishuo Tan, Jing Tang, Xi Ling, Wanzheng Hu
Abstract: Two-dimensional antiferromagnets are promising materials for spintronics. The van der Waals antiferromagnet NiPS$_3$ has attracted extensive interest due to its ultra-narrow exciton feature which is closely linked with the magnetic ordering. Here, we use time-resolved terahertz spectroscopy to investigate photo-excited carriers in NiPS$_3$. We identify the onset of interband transitions and estimate the exciton dissociation energy from the excitation wavelength and fluence dependence of the transient spectral weight. Our results provide key insights to quantify the exciton characteristics and validate the band structure for NiPS$_3$.

Title: Fast summation of fermionic Feynman diagrams beyond Bravais Lattices and on-site Hubbard interactions
Authors: Boyuan Shi
Abstract: We designed new algorithms for summing bold-line Feynman diagrams in arbitrary channels, where it can be readily modified for bare interaction series as well. When applied to magnetic channel bold-line series with on-site Hubbard interactions, the algorithm achieves competitive performance compared with the state-of-art RPADet. We then generalize it beyond square lattice and on-site Hubbard interactions and achieve better scaling in the number of sites within a unit cell, while there is substantial increase when there are more types of interactions. This work paves the way of diagrammatic Monte Carlo simulations for real materials, holding the premise for a robust replacement of state-of-art simulation tools in the thermodynamical limit.

Title: Non-reciprocal waves in two-dimensional electron systems with temperature gradient
Authors: Aleksandr S. Petrov
Abstract: We demonstrate that the interaction of dc temperature gradient with ac magnetic field in temperature-biased two-dimensional electron systems leads to formation of a new electromagnetic mode, a two-dimensional thermomagnetic wave (2d TMW). This wave is transverse electric and non-reciprocal, and its damping rate can be lower than that of conventional 2d plasma waves. The Q-factor of 2d TMW is independent of the wave vector. Numerical estimates show that in state-of-the-art two-dimensional electrons systems the 2d TMW Q-factor is the order of $10^{-3}$. We discuss possible ways to overcome this issue.

Title: Timescales for thermalization, quantum chaos, and self-averaging
Authors: Isaías Vallejo-Fabila, Lea F. Santos
Abstract: This chapter discusses the conditions and timescales under which isolated many-body quantum systems, initially far from equilibrium, ultimately reach thermal equilibrium. We also examine quantities that, during the relaxation process, exhibit dynamical manifestations of spectral correlations as in random matrix theory and investigate how these manifestations affect their equilibration times. We refer to systems presenting these spectral correlations as chaotic quantum systems, although the correct term to be employed, whether chaotic or ergodic quantum systems, is debatable and both have limitations.

Title: Fractional chiral second-order topological insulator from a three-dimensional array of coupled wires
Authors: Viktoriia Pinchenkova, Katharina Laubscher, Jelena Klinovaja
Abstract: We construct a model of a three-dimensional chiral second-order topological insulator (SOTI) from an array of weakly coupled nanowires. We show that, in a suitable parameter regime, the interplay between rotating magnetic fields and spatially modulated interwire tunnelings leads to the opening of gaps in the bulk and surface spectrum of the system, while one or more chiral hinge states propagating along a closed path of one-dimensional hinges are left gapless. The exact path of these hinge states is determined by the hierarchy of interwire couplings and the boundary termination of the sample. Depending on the ratio between the period of the rotating magnetic field and the Fermi wavelength, our model can realize both integer and fractional chiral SOTIs. The fractional regime emerges in the presence of strong electron-electron interactions and features hinge states carrying only a fraction $e/p$ of the electronic charge $e$ for a positive odd integer $p$.

Title: Interplay between trimer structure and magnetic ground state in Ba5Ru3O12 probed by Neutron and muSR techniques
Authors: E. Kushwaha, S. Ghosh, J. Sannigrahi, G. Roy, M. Kumar, S.Cottrell, M. B. Stone, Y. Fang, D. T. Adroja, X. Ke, T. Basu
Abstract: We report a detailed inelastic neutron scattering (INS) and muon spin relaxation (muSR) investigations of a trimer Ruthenate Ba5Ru3O12 system, which undergoes long-range antiferromagnetic ordering at TN = 60 K. The INS reveals two distinct spin-wave excitations below TN : one around 5.6 meV and the other at 10 to 15 meV. The coexistence of such excitations at both low and high momentum transfer regions is speculated to be strong electronic correlation and spin-phonon coupling of Ruthenium. By accompanying the INS spectra based on a linear spin wave theory using SpinW software, we show that Ba5Ru3O12 exhibits spin frustration due to competing exchange interactions between neighboring and next-neighboring Ru-moments, exchange anisotropy and strong spin-orbit coupling, which yields a non-collinear spin structure, in contrast to other ruthenate trimers in this series. Interestingly, these magnetic excitations does not completely vanish even at high temperatures above TN , evidencing short-range magnetic correlations in this trimer system. This is further supported by muSR spectroscopy, which exhibits a gradual drop in the initial asymmetry around the magnetic phase transition and is further verified through maximum entropy analysis. The results of muSR spectroscopy indicates a dynamic nature of magnetic order, attributed to local magnetic anisotropy within the trimer as a result of local structural distortion and different hybridization, consistent with canted spin-structure. We predict the ground state of Ru3O12-isolated trimer through theoretical calculations which agree with the experimentally observed spin excitation.

Title: Coexistence of magnetic and dielectric glassy states in alternating kagome and triangular lattice LuBaCo$_4$O$_7$ cobaltite

Abstract: To date, the alternating kagome and triangular lattice cobaltites, RBaCo$_4$O$_7$ (R = Ca, Y, and rare earth elements), have been well studied for their large structural distortions, anisotropic exchange interactions, chiral spin liquid states, and giant multiferroic properties. Here, we report the co-existence of magnetic and dielectric glassy states in LuBaCo$_4$O$_7$ below 50 K. AC magnetization studies show an absence of conventional spin-freezing behavior. The cooling and heating in unequal fields (CHUF), thermal cycling, and time-dependent magnetization measurements at low temperature ($T$) show the presence of magnetic glassy state. The $T$-dependent dielectric constant $\epsilon'$ measurements exhibit a strong frequency-independent response at the first-order structural phase transition $T = 160$ K (trigonal $P31c$ to monoclinic $Cc$) and also significant features at the $T = 110$ K (monoclinic $Cc$ to orthorhombic $Pbn2_1$) phase transition. Further, $\epsilon'$ shows a frequency-independent peak at 43 K ($Pbn2_1$) and also dipolar glassy features below 20 K ($Cc$). The non-equilibrium magnetic glassy dynamics and dipolar glassy state at low-$T$ arises from the kinetic arrest of $Cc$ and $Pbn2_1$ phases. From the dielectric probe, we are able to clearly distinguish the kinetically arrested phases at low-$T$ , whereas the bulk magnetization studies are unable to do so as the arrested phases have low magnetic moments.

Title: Uniform deposition of particles in large scale by drying of binary droplets
Authors: Zechao Jiang, Liyiming Tao, Xiuyuan Yang, Masao Doi, Ye Xu, Xingkun Man
Abstract: The evaporation of liquid droplets often results in a ring-like deposition pattern of particles, presenting challenges for applications requiring highly uniform patterns. Despite extensive efforts to suppress the coffee ring effect, achieving a uniform particle distribution remains a great challenge due to the complex and non-equilibrium nature of the evaporation process. In this work, we introduce and demonstrate a one-step drying method for binary droplets (water and 2-methoxyethanol) that produces uniform deposition of nano- and micro-particles. By adjusting the initial water volume fraction, we effectively control the interplay between capillary and Marangoni flows, resulting in deposition patterns that vary from coffee ring to uniform and to volcano-like. Through both theoretical and experimental analyses, we determine the conditions necessary for achieving such high uniformity. This approach requires no special substrate treatment, particle modification, or controlled environments, and works for various particles, including silica and polystyrene. Our method provides a robust solution for fabricating uniform patterns that are crucial for many practical applications, ranging from printing to microelectronics to bio-pharmacy.

Authors: L. Saba, J. E. Gómez, D. J. Pérez-Morelo, S. Anguiano, D. Velázquez Rodriguez, A. Butera, M. Granada, L. Avilés-Félix
Abstract: The effects of the crystalline symmetry on the magnetotransport properties in ferromagnetic alloys are being reexamined in recent years particularly due to the role of the anisotropic magnetoresistance on the electrical detection of magnetization dynamics, which is relevant to estimate spin transport parameters such as the spin Hall angle or the damping constant. In this work we investigated the crystalline dependent anisotropic magnetoresistance in epitaxial Fe85Co15 films and discuss the magnetization process through the magnetotransport properties by varying the relative orientations between the electric current, the external magnetic field and the Fe85Co15 crystallographic directions. We have found that the anisotropic magnetoresistance ratio depends on the current direction with respect to the crystal axes of Fe85Co15 and determine a ratio of 0.20 % and 0.17 % when the current is applied along the [110] hard and [100] easy axes, respectively. We fit our experimental data using the Stoner-Wohlfarth model to describe the path followed by the magnetization during the magnetization process and to extract the anisotropy constants. The fitted cubic and uniaxial anisotropy constants are Kc = 21 kJ/m3 and Ku = 11 kJ/m3, which are comparable with reported values from the angular variation of ferromagnetic resonance experiments. Our results contribute to the understanding of the interplay between the crystalline structure and the magnetotransport properties of FeCo alloys.

Title: Antiferromagnetism and spin excitations in a two-dimensional non-Hermitian Hatano-Nelson flux model
Authors: Eduard Naichuk, Ilya M. Eremin, Jeroen van den Brink, Flavio S. Nogueira
Abstract: The one-dimensional Hatano-Nelson model with non-reciprocal hoppings is a prominent example of a relatively simple non-Hermitian quantum-mechanical system, which allows to study various phenomena in open quantum systems without adding extra gain and loss terms. Here we propose to use it as a building block to construct a correlated non-Hermitian Hamiltonian in two dimensions. It has the characteristic form of a flux model with clock-anticlockwise non-reciprocal hopping on each plaquette. Adding the on-site Hubbard type interaction we analyze the formation of the longe-range antiferromagnetic order and its spin excitations. Such a model is non-Hermitian, but $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric, which leads to the existence of two regions: a region of unbroken $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry (real-valued spectrum) and a region of broken $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry with exceptional lines and complex-valued energy spectrum. The transition from one region to another is controlled by the value of the on-site interaction parameter and coincides with the metal-insulator transition. We also analyze the spin wave spectrum, which is characterized by two diffusive d-wave type of modes corresponding to gain and loss.

Title: Quantum-stabilized states in magnetic dipolar quantum gases
Authors: Lauriane Chomaz
Abstract: A decade ago, a universal stabilization mechanism driven by quantum fluctuations was discovered in ultracold Bose gases of highly magnetic atoms. This mechanism prevents these systems from collapsing and instead allows exotic states of matter to arise, including ultradilute quantum droplets, crystallized quantum states, and specifically supersolids. We review the experimental and theoretical progress in understanding these quantum-stabilized states, their emergence, and intriguing properties.

Title: Radiation-induced Instability of Organic-Inorganic Halide Perovskite Single Crystals
Authors: Ruitian Chen, Mingyu Xie, Tianyi Lyu, Jincong Pang, Lewei Zeng, Jiahui Zhang, Changjun Cheng, Renfei Feng, Guangda Niu, Jiang Tang, Yu Zou
Abstract: Organic-inorganic halide perovskites (OIHPs) are promising optoelectronic materials, but their instability under radiation environments restricts their durability and practical applications. Here we employ electron and synchrotron X-ray beams, individually, to investigate the radiation-induced instability of two types of OIHP single crystals (FAPbBr3 and MAPbBr3). Under the electron beam, we observe that 3-point star-style cracks grow on the surface of FAPbBr3, and bricklayer-style cracks are formed on the surface of MAPbBr3. Under the X-ray beam, a new composition without organic components appears in both FAPbBr3 and MAPbBr3. Such cracking and composition changes are attributed to the volatilization of organic components. We propose a volume-strain-based mechanism, in which the energy conversion results from the organic cation loss. Using nanoindentation, we reveal that beam radiations reduce the Youngs modulus and increase the hardness of both OIHPs. This study provides valuable insights into the structural and mechanical stabilities of OIHP single crystals in radiation environments.

Title: Signatures of Candidate States of $ν=12/5$ in Shot Noise
Authors: Goutham Vinjamuri, Ankur Das
Abstract: Fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states are highly sought after because of their ability to host non-abelian anyons, whose braiding statistics make them excellent candidates for qubits in topological quantum computing. Multiple theoretical studies on the $\nu=\frac{12}{5}$ FQH state predict various quasi-particle states hosted by the $\frac{12}{5}$ plateau, which include $\mathbb Z_3$ parafermions and Majorana modes. In this work, we provide a systematic protocol to distinguish among four possible candidate wavefunctions of the $\frac{12}{5}$ plateau using zero-frequency short noise experiments on a filter-geometry. Qualitative comparisons of Fano-Factors provide a robust way to predict the candidate state across both the full and partial thermal equilibration regimes without prior knowledge of the experimental information, like thermal equilibration length, to allow for more realistic experiments.

Title: Orb-v3: atomistic simulation at scale
Authors: Benjamin Rhodes, Sander Vandenhaute, Vaidotas Šimkus, James Gin, Jonathan Godwin, Tim Duignan, Mark Neumann
Abstract: We introduce Orb-v3, the next generation of the Orb family of universal interatomic potentials. Models in this family expand the performance-speed-memory Pareto frontier, offering near SoTA performance across a range of evaluations with a >10x reduction in latency and > 8x reduction in memory. Our experiments systematically traverse this frontier, charting the trade-off induced by roto-equivariance, conservatism and graph sparsity. Contrary to recent literature, we find that non-equivariant, non-conservative architectures can accurately model physical properties, including those which require higher-order derivatives of the potential energy surface. This model release is guided by the principle that the most valuable foundation models for atomic simulation will excel on all fronts: accuracy, latency and system size scalability. The reward for doing so is a new era of computational chemistry driven by high-throughput and mesoscale all-atom simulations.

Title: The distinction between Ice phases VII, VIII and X
Authors: Graeme J Ackland, Andreas Hermann, Kazuki Komatsu, Keishiro Yamashita, J.S. Loveday
Abstract: Ice phases VII, VIII and X are all based on a body-centered cubic arrangement of molecules, the differences coming from molecular orientation. There is some debate as to whether these should even be considered distinct phases. The standard definition of a transition between distinct phases involves a discontinuity in any derivative of the free energy. This can be hard to prove experimentally, and most previous theoretical works have been based on models which either have continuously differentiable free energies, or no straightforward way to determine the free energy. Here we build a free energy model based on the common definitions of the phases ; ordered ice-VIII, orientationally disordered ice VII and proton-disordered ice X. All transitions in this model might or might not be associated with a discontinuity in the specific heat, depending on paramaterization. By comparing with data, we find that a VII-X transition line exists, but it ends in a critical point hidden within the stability field of phase VIII. If the model is correct, there is a discontinuity between VII and X, so they are separate phases. We propose that the hidden phase boundary might be demonstrated experimentally by compression of supercooled ice VII.

Title: Appearance of Multiple Spectral Gaps in Voltage-Biased Josephson Junctions Without Floquet Hybridization
Authors: Teng Zhang, Tatiana de Picoli, Tyler Lindemann, Jukka I. Väyrynen, Michael J. Manfra
Abstract: A time-periodic drive enables the engineering of non-equilibrium quantum systems by hybridizing Floquet sidebands. We investigated DC voltage-biased planar Josephson junctions built upon epitaxial Al/InAs heterostructures in which the intrinsic AC Josephson effect is theoretically expected to provide a time-periodic drive leading to Floquet hybridization. Tunneling spectroscopy is performed using probes positioned at the ends of the junction to study the evolution of the local density of states. With applied drive, we observe multiple coherence peaks which are studied as a function of DC voltage bias and in-plane magnetic field. Our analysis suggests that these spectral gaps arise from a direct mesoscopic coupling between the tunneling probe and the superconducting leads rather than from a Floquet-driven gap opening. Our numerical simulations indicate that an increase in the ratio of junction width to coherence length will enhance the contribution of Floquet hybridization. This work lays a foundation for the exploration of Floquet physics utilizing voltage-biased hybrid superconductor-semiconductor Josephson junctions and provides means for distinguishing direct couplings from genuine Floquet effects.

Title: Electronic Structure Guided Inverse Design Using Generative Models
Authors: Shuyi Jia, Panchapakesan Ganesh, Victor Fung
Abstract: The electronic structure of a material fundamentally determines its underlying physical, and by extension, its functional properties. Consequently, the ability to identify or generate materials with desired electronic properties would enable the design of tailored functional materials. Traditional approaches relying on human intuition or exhaustive computational screening of known materials remain inefficient and resource-prohibitive for this task. Here, we introduce DOSMatGen, the first instance of a machine learning method which generates crystal structures that match a given desired electronic density of states. DOSMatGen is an E(3)-equivariant joint diffusion framework, and utilizes classifier-free guidance to accurately condition the generated materials on the density of states. Our experiments find this approach can successfully yield materials which are both stable and match closely with the desired density of states. Furthermore, this method is highly flexible and allows for finely controlled generation which can target specific templates or even individual sites within a material. This method enables a more physics-driven approach to designing new materials for applications including catalysts, photovoltaics, and superconductors.

Title: Moiré enhanced flat band in rhombohedral graphene

Abstract: The fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect (FQAHE) is a fascinating emergent quantum state characterized by fractionally charged excitations in the absence of magnetic field,which could arise from the intricate interplay between electron correlation, nontrivial topology and spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking. Recently, FQAHE has been realized in aligned rhombohedral pentalayer graphene on BN superlattice (aligned R5G/BN), where the topological flat band is modulated by the moiré potential. However, intriguingly, the FQAHE is observed only when electrons are pushed away from the moiré interface. The apparently opposite implications from these experimental observations, along with different theoretical models, have sparked intense debates regarding the role of the moiré potential. Unambiguous experimental observation of the topological flat band as well as moiré bands with energy and momentum resolved information is therefore critical to elucidate the underlying mechanism. Here by performing nanospot angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (NanoARPES) measurements, we directly reveal the topological flat band electronic structures of R5G, from which key hopping parameters essential for determining the fundamental electronic structure of rhombohedral graphene are extracted. Moreover, a comparison of electronic structures between aligned and non-aligned samples reveals that the moiré potential plays a pivotal role in enhancing the topological flat band in the aligned sample. Our study provides experimental guiding lines to narrow down the phase space of rhombohedral graphene, laying an important foundation for understanding exotic quantum phenomena in this emerging platform.

Title: Two-Dimensional Ferroelectric Altermagnets: From Model to Material Realization
Authors: Ziye Zhu, Xunkai Duan, Jiayong Zhang, Bowen Hao, Igor Zutic, Tong Zhou
Abstract: Multiferroic altermagnets offer new opportunities for magnetoelectric coupling and electrically tunable spintronics. However, due to intrinsic symmetry conflicts between altermagnetism and ferroelectricity, achieving their coexistence, known as ferroelectric altermagnets (FEAM), remains an outstanding challenge, especially in two-dimensional (2D) systems. Here, we propose a universal, symmetry-based design principle for 2D FEAM, supported by tight-binding models and first-principles calculations. We show that ferroelectric lattice distortions can break spin equivalence and introduce the necessary rotational symmetry, enabling altermagnetism with electrically reversible spin splitting. Guided by this framework, we identify a family of 2D vanadium oxyhalides and sulfide halides as promising FEAM candidates. In these compounds, pseudo Jahn-Teller distortions and Peierls-like dimerization cooperatively establish the required symmetry conditions. We further propose the magneto-optical Kerr effect as an experimental probe to confirm FEAM and its electric spin reversal. Our findings provide a practical framework for 2D FEAM and advancing electrically controlled spintronic devices.

Title: Paraxial fluids of light
Authors: Quentin Glorieux, Clara Piekarski, Quentin Schibler, Tangui Aladjidi, Myrann Baker-Rasooli
Abstract: Paraxial fluids of light are a promising platform for exploring collective phenomena in a highly tunable environment. These systems, which map the propagation of light through nonlinear media onto the wavefunction of effective 2D quantum fluids, offer a complementary approach to traditional platforms such as cold atomic gases or superfluid helium. In this review, we present a detailed overview of the theoretical framework underlying paraxial fluids of light, including the nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLSE) and its mapping to the 2D+1 Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE). We explore the hydrodynamic formulation of these systems and we provide a comparative analysis of fluids of light and cold atomic gases, examining key parameters and figures of merit. We then review the recent experimental advances and the experimental platforms currently used to realize paraxial fluids of light, including hot atomic vapors, photorefractive crystals, and thermo-optic media. Additionally, we question the geometry of the system extending the analogy from 2D+1 to lower or higher dimensions. Looking forward, we outline the potential future directions for the field, including the use of laser cooled atoms as nonlinear media, the study of two-component mixtures, and the exploration of quantum effects beyond the mean-field approximation. These developments promise to deepen our understanding of quantum fluids and potentially contribute to advances in quantum technologies.

Title: Prethermalization of light and matter in cavity-coupled Rydberg arrays
Authors: Aleksandr N. Mikheev, Hossein Hosseinabadi, Jamir Marino
Abstract: We explore the dynamics of two-dimensional Rydberg atom arrays coupled to a single-mode optical cavity, employing nonequilibrium diagrammatic techniques to capture nonlinearities and fluctuations beyond mean-field theory. We discover a novel prethermalization regime driven by the interplay between short-range Rydberg interactions and long-range photon-mediated interactions. In this regime, matter and light equilibrate at distinct - and in some cases opposite - effective temperatures, resembling the original concept of prethermalization from particle physics. Our results establish strongly correlated AMO platforms as tools to investigate fundamental questions in statistical mechanics, including quantum thermalization in higher-dimensional systems.

Title: Entanglement Hamiltonian and effective temperature of non-Hermitian quantum spin ladders
Authors: Pei-Yun Yang, Yu-Chin Tzeng
Abstract: Quantum entanglement plays a crucial role not only in understanding Hermitian many-body systems but also in offering valuable insights into non-Hermitian quantum systems. In this paper, we analytically investigate the entanglement Hamiltonian and entanglement energy spectrum of a non-Hermitian spin ladder using perturbation theory in the biorthogonal basis. Specifically, we examine the entanglement properties between coupled non-Hermitian quantum spin chains. In the strong coupling limit ($J_\mathrm{rung}\gg1$), first-order perturbation theory reveals that the entanglement Hamiltonian closely resembles the single-chain Hamiltonian with renormalized coupling strengths, allowing for the definition of an ad hoc temperature. Our findings provide new insights into quantum entanglement in non-Hermitian systems and offer a foundation for developing novel approaches for studying finite temperature properties in non-Hermitian quantum many-body systems.

Title: Timelike Quantum Energy Teleportation
Authors: Kazuki Ikeda
Abstract: We establish a novel quantum protocol called Timelike Quantum Energy Teleportation (TQET), designed for transporting quantum energy across space-time. This protocol uses temporal and spatial quantum correlations between agents separated by space and time. The energy supplier injects energy into the system by measuring the ground state of a many-body system that evolves over time, while the distant recipient performs a conditional operation using feedback from the supplier. When both supplier and recipient operate within the same time frame, this is called Quantum Energy Teleportation (QET). A proof-of-concept was performed for the Ising model, utilizing quantum simulations. TQET increases energy efficiency from approximately 3% to around 40%, representing over a 13-fold improvement compared to QET. Furthermore, we analyzed the relationship between entanglement in time and TQET, validating the role of temporal correlations in energy activation between agents across space-time.

Title: Subexponential decay of local correlations from diffusion-limited dephasing
Authors: Ewan McCulloch, J. Alexander Jacoby, Curt von Keyserlingk, Sarang Gopalakrishnan
Abstract: Chaotic quantum systems at finite energy density are expected to act as their own heat baths, rapidly dephasing local quantum superpositions. We argue that in fact this dephasing is subexponential for chaotic dynamics with conservation laws in one spatial dimension: all local correlation functions decay as stretched exponentials or slower. The stretched exponential bound is saturated for operators that are orthogonal to all hydrodynamic modes. This anomalous decay is a quantum coherent effect, which lies beyond standard fluctuating hydrodynamics; it vanishes in the presence of extrinsic dephasing. Our arguments are general, subject principally to the assumption that there exist zero-entropy charge sectors (such as the particle vacuum) with no nontrivial dynamics: slow relaxation is due to the persistence of regions resembling these inert vacua, which we term "voids". In systems with energy conservation, this assumption is automatically satisfied because of the third law of thermodynamics.

Title: Topologically correlated bound states via a dynamical gauge field
Authors: Zhoutao Lei, Linhu Li
Abstract: Recent advances in topological phases have opened new frontiers in materials science and quantum physics. However, their emergence in strongly correlated systems are less understood due to the complex interplay between particle interactions and band topology. In this work, we consider a cold-atom-based spin-dependent Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with a non-Hermitian dynamical gauge field (DGF), where two kinds of topologically correlated bound states are found to emerge from the DGF. Specifically, edge bound states with co-localization of both spin species arise from the interplay between DGF and nontrivial single-particle topology, and bulk bound states with extended distribution in the lattice emerges from nontrivial topology of inter-species band inversion. These bound states can coexist in same parameter regimes and compete with each other, leading to distinguished dynamical signatures. This work bridges the gap between conventional band topology and strongly correlated physics, establishing a new paradigm for discovering emergent topological phenomena in quantum systems.

Title: Spectral Similarity Masks Structural Diversity at Hydrophobic Water Interfaces
Authors: Yong Wang, Yifan Li, Linhan Du, Chunyi Zhang, Lorenzo Agosta, Marcos Calegari Andrade, Annabella Selloni, Roberto Car
Abstract: The air-water and graphene-water interfaces represent quintessential examples of the liquid-gas and liquid-solid boundaries, respectively. While the sum-frequency generation (SFG) spectra of these interfaces exhibit certain similarities, a consensus on their signals and interpretations has yet to be reached. Leveraging deep learning, we accessed fully first-principles SFG spectra for both systems, addressing recent experimental discrepancies. Despite both interfaces exhibiting microscopically hydrophobic characteristics, our findings reveal that similarities in SFG signals do not translate into comparable interfacial microscopic properties. Instead, graphene-water and air-water interfaces exhibit fundamental differences in SFG-active thicknesses, hydrogen-bonding networks, and dynamic diffusion behavior. These distinctions underscore the stronger confinements imposed by the solid-liquid interface compared with the weaker constraints of the gas-liquid interface.

Title: High-efficiency broadband active metasurfaces via reversible metal electrodeposition
Authors: Qizhang Li, Sachin Prashant Kulkarni, Chenxi Sui, Ting-Hsuan Chen, Gangbin Yan, Ronghui Wu, Wen Chen, Pei-Jan Hung, Xubing Wu, Tadej Emersic, Koray Aydin, Po-Chun Hsu
Abstract: Realizing active metasurfaces with substantial tunability is important for many applications but remains challenging due to difficulties in dynamically tuning light-matter interactions at subwavelength scales. Here, we introduce reversible metal electrodeposition as a versatile approach for enabling active metasurfaces with exceptional tunability across a broad bandwidth. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate a dynamic beam-steering device by performing reversible copper (Cu) electrodeposition on a reflective gradient metasurface composed of metal-insulator-metal resonators. By applying different voltages, the Cu atoms can be uniformly and reversibly electrodeposited and stripped around the resonators, effectively controlling the gap-surface plasmon resonances and steering the reflected light. This process experimentally achieved >90% diffraction efficiencies and >60% reflection efficiencies in both specular and anomalous modes, even after thousands of cycles. Moreover, these high efficiencies can be extended from the visible to the near- and mid-infrared regimes, demonstrating the broad versatility of this approach in enabling various active optical and thermal devices with different working wavelengths and bandwidths.

Title: Improved Inference of Inverse Ising Problems under Missing Observations in Restricted Boltzmann Machines
Authors: Kaiji Sekimoto, Muneki Yasuda
Abstract: Restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) are energy-based models analogous to the Ising model and are widely applied in statistical machine learning. The standard inverse Ising problem with a complete dataset requires computing both data and model expectations and is computationally challenging because model expectations have a combinatorial explosion. Furthermore, in many applications, the available datasets are partially incomplete, making it difficult to compute even data expectations. In this study, we propose a approximation framework for these expectations in the practical inverse Ising problems that integrates mean-field approximation or persistent contrastive divergence to generate refined initial points and spatial Monte Carlo integration to enhance estimator accuracy. We demonstrate that the proposed method effectively and accurately tunes the model parameters in comparison to the conventional method.

Title: Infrared phonon Thermoreflectance in Polar Dielectrics
Authors: William D. Hutchins, Saman Zare, Daniel Hirt, Elizabeth Golightly, Patrick E. Hopkins
Abstract: In this work, we investigate dielectric materials for thermoreflectance-based thermal sensing by extracting key optical parameters using temperature-dependent spectroscopic ellipsometry in the mid-infrared regime. Leveraging optical phonon resonances, we demonstrate that the thermoreflectance coefficients in polar dielectrics rival, and in some cases exceed by an order of magnitude, those observed in commonly used metals that are typically used as temperature transducers in thermoreflectance measurements. We introduce a transducer figure of merit (FOM) that combines pump absorption and probe reflectance modulation at different wavelengths. Our findings reveal that materials such as sapphire and aluminum nitride can outperform metals by up to two orders of magnitude. These results position dielectric materials as compelling candidates for next-generation thermal metrology, broadening the design space for optical thermometry, with strong implications for high-resolution thermal mapping and characterization of layered device structures based on phonon probing.

Title: Simultaneous Multiphoton-Multiatom Processes in Atomic Gases under Laser Fields
Authors: Yongle Yu
Abstract: We investigate simultaneous multiphoton-multiatom processes in atomic gases exposed to laser fields under specific frequency conditions, where multiple atoms are simultaneously excited through the absorption of one laser photon each. These processes represent natural high-order quantum electrodynamics (QED) effects that occur independently of inter-atomic interactions. A characteristic length scale emerges, governing the physical range over which these phenomena manifest. We propose experiments to demonstrate the fundamental aspects of these collective QED processes.

Title: Mass-Spring Models for Passive Keyword Spotting: A Springtronics Approach
Authors: Finn Bohte, Theophile Louvet, Vincent Maillou, Marc Serra Garcia
Abstract: Mechanical systems played a foundational role in computing history, and have regained interest due to their unique properties, such as low damping and the ability to process mechanical signals without transduction. However, recent efforts have primarily focused on elementary computations, implemented in systems based on pre-defined reservoirs, or in periodic systems such as arrays of buckling beams. Here, we numerically demonstrate a passive mechanical system$\unicode{x2014}$in the form of a nonlinear mass-spring model$\unicode{x2014}$that tackles a real-world benchmark for keyword spotting in speech signals. The model is organized in a hierarchical architecture combining feature extraction and continuous-time convolution, with each individual stage tailored to the physics of the considered mass-spring systems. For each step in the computation, a subsystem is designed by combining a small set of low-order polynomial potentials. These potentials act as fundamental components that interconnect a network of masses. In analogy to electronic circuit design, where complex functional circuits are constructed by combining basic components into hierarchical designs, we refer to this framework as springtronics. We introduce springtronic systems with hundreds of degrees of freedom, achieving speech classification accuracy comparable to existing sub-mW electronic systems.

Title: Elongation-Induced Segregation in Periodically Textured Microfluidic Channels
Authors: Fatemeh S. Ahmadi, Hossein Hamzehpour, Reza Shaebani
Abstract: We numerically investigate the motion of elongated microparticles in microfluidic channels at low Reynolds numbers. In channels with smooth walls, asymmetric initial conditions -- including particle orientation and lateral position -- lead to continuous variations in particle trajectories, potentially exhibiting repeated behavior depending on the channel geometry and initial conditions. However, we find that introducing periodically textured walls induces alignment of the particle with the channel centerline within a specific range of texture wavelengths. This occurs as the textured pattern disrupts the uniformity of the flow, creating localized high-velocity nodes that repeatedly guide the particle toward the centerline as it moves downstream. Notably, the characteristic length scale over which this alignment forms reduces with increasing particle elongation and diverges with increasing Reynolds number. Our findings reveal that elongation-induced alignment can be leveraged for microfluidic filtering applications, enabling the efficient separation of microparticles based on their geometric properties. This work opens new avenues for designing microfluidic devices tailored for high-precision particle sorting, with broad implications for biomedical and industrial applications.

Title: Threshold-less and Flexibly Tunable Frequency Comb via Floquet Engineering
Authors: Sihan Wang, Cheng Wang, Matthijs H. J. de Jong, Laure Mercier de Lépinay, Jingwei Zhou, Mika A. Sillanpää, Yulong Liu
Abstract: Frequency combs have revolutionized communication, metrology and spectroscopy. Numerous efforts have been dedicated to developing integrated combs, predominantly relying on Pockels or Kerr mechanisms. In this work, we propose and demonstrate a new type of frequency comb-Floquet cavity frequency comb-that does not rely on intrinsic non-linearity. By periodically modulating the resonance frequency of a cavity, a giant-mode cavity with multiple equally spaced frequency components is created. The pump tone interacts with the pre-modulated cavity, generating the output frequency comb. This approach offers a flexible tuning range and operates in a threshold-less manner, obviating the need to overcome nonlinear initiation thresholds. We implement this on a microwave cavity optomechanical system on-chip. Compared to Kerr optomechanical combs, this approach efficiently generates comb with pump signal far from the cavity's intrinsic frequency, and the power required for detection is reduced by approximately a factor of ($10^6$), providing a promising platform for frequency comb generation.

Title: Endoscopic fiber-coupled diamond magnetometer for cancer surgery
Authors: A. J. Newman, S. M. Graham, C. J. Stephen, A. M. Edmonds, M. L. Markham, G. W. Morley
Abstract: Interoperative measurements using magnetic sensors is a valuable technique in cancer surgery for finding magnetic tracers. Here we present a fiber-coupled nitrogen-vacancy (N-V) center magnetometer capable of detecting iron oxide suspension (MagTrace from Endomagnetics Ltd.) used in breast cancer surgeries. Detection of an iron mass as low as 0.56~mg has been demonstrated, 100 times less than that of a recommended dose at a maximum distance of 5.8~mm. Detection of an iron concentration as low as 2.8 mg/ml has also been demonstrated, 20 times less than a recommended dose. The maximum working distance from the sensor can be as large as 14.6~mm for higher concentrations. The sensor head has a maximum diameter of 10~mm which would allow it to be used for endoscopy, laparoscopy and interoperative surgery.

Title: The complete trans-series for conserved charges in the Lieb-Liniger model
Authors: Zoltán Bajnok, János Balog, Ramon Miravitllas, Dennis le Plat, István Vona
Abstract: We determine the complete trans-series solution for the (non-relativistic) moments of the rapidity density in the Lieb-Liniger model. The trans-series is written explicitly in terms of a perturbative basis, which can be obtained from the already known perturbative expansion of the density by solving several ordinary differential equations. Unknown integration constants are fixed from Volin's method. We have checked that our solution satisfies the analytical consistency requirements including the newly derived resurgence relations and agrees with the high precision numerical solution. Our results also provides the full analytic trans-series for the capacitance of the coaxial circular plate capacitor.

Title: Ultrafast Coherent Bandgap Modulation Probed by Parametric Nonlinear Optics
Authors: Sebastian Klimmer, Thomas Lettau, Laura Valencia Molina, Daniil Kartashov, Ulf Peschel, Jan Wilhelm, Dragomir Neshev, Giancarlo Soavi
Abstract: Light-matter interactions in crystals are powerful tools that seamlessly allow both functionalities of sizeable bandgap modulation and non-invasive spectroscopy. While we often assume that the border between the two regimes of modulation and detection is sharp and well-defined, there are experiments where the boundaries fade. The study of these transition regions allows us to identify the real potentials and inherent limitations of the most commonly used optical spectroscopy techniques. Here, we measure and explain the co-existence between bandgap modulation and non-invasive spectroscopy in the case of resonant perturbative nonlinear optics in an atomically thin direct gap semiconductor. We report a clear deviation from the typical quadratic power scaling of second-harmonic generation near an exciton resonance, and we explain this unusual result based on all-optical modulation driven by the intensity-dependent optical Stark and Bloch-Siegert shifts in the $\pm$K valleys of the Brillouin zone. Our experimental results are corroborated by analytical and numerical analysis based on the semiconductor Bloch equations, from which we extract the resonant transition dipole moments and dephasing times of the used sample. These findings redefine the meaning of perturbative nonlinear optics by revealing how coherent light-matter interactions can modify the band structure of a crystal, even in the weak-field regime. Furthermore, our results strengthen the understanding of ultrafast all-optical control of electronic states in two-dimensional materials, with potential applications in valleytronics, Floquet engineering, and light-wave electronics.

Title: Symmetry breaking in chaotic many-body quantum systems at finite temperature
Authors: Angelo Russotto, Filiberto Ares, Pasquale Calabrese
Abstract: Recent work has shown that the entanglement of finite-temperature eigenstates in chaotic quantum many-body local Hamiltonians can be accurately described by an ensemble of random states with an internal $U(1)$ symmetry. We build upon this result to investigate the universal symmetry-breaking properties of such eigenstates. As a probe of symmetry breaking, we employ the entanglement asymmetry, a quantum information observable that quantifies the extent to which symmetry is broken in a subsystem. This measure enables us to explore the finer structure of finite-temperature eigenstates in terms of the $U(1)$-symmetric random state ensemble; in particular, the relation between the Hamiltonian and the effective conserved charge in the ensemble. Our analysis is supported by analytical calculations for the symmetric random states, as well as exact numerical results for the Mixed-Field Ising spin-$1/2$ chain, a paradigmatic model of quantum chaoticity.

Title: Direct measurement of broken time-reversal symmetry in centrosymmetric and non-centrosymmetric atomically thin crystals with nonlinear Kerr rotation
Authors: Florentine Friedrich, Paul Herrmann, Shridhar Sanjay Shanbhag, Sebastian Klimmer, Jan Wilhelm, Giancarlo Soavi
Abstract: Time-reversal symmetry, together with space-inversion symmetry, is one of the defining properties of crystals, underlying phenomena such as magnetism, topology and non-trivial spin textures. Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) provide an excellent tunable model system to study the interplay between time-reversal and space-inversion symmetry, since both can be engineered on demand by tuning the number of layers and via all-optical bandgap modulation. In this work, we modulate and study time-reversal symmetry using third harmonic Kerr rotation in mono- and bilayer TMDs. By illuminating the samples with elliptically polarized light, we achieve spin-selective bandgap modulation and consequent breaking of time-reversal symmetry. The reduced symmetry modifies the nonlinear susceptibility tensor, causing a rotation of the emitted third harmonic polarization. With this method, we are able to probe broken time-reversal symmetry in both non-centrosymmetric (monolayer) and centrosymmetric (bilayer) crystals. Furthermore, we discuss how the detected third harmonic rotation angle directly links to the spin-valley locking in monolayer TMDs and to the spin-valley-layer locking in bilayer TMDs. Thus, our results define a powerful approach to study broken time-reversal symmetry in crystals regardless of space-inversion symmetry, and shed light on the spin, valley and layer coupling of atomically thin semiconductors.

Title: Hydroxide Mobility in Aqueous Systems: Ab Initio Accuracy with Millisecond Timescales
Authors: Jonas Hänseroth, Daniel Sebastiani, Jakob Scholl, Karl Skadell, Christian Dreßler
Abstract: We present a multiscale simulation approach for hydroxide transport in aqueous solutions of potassium hydroxide, combining ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations with force field ensemble averaging and lattice Monte Carlo techniques. This method achieves near ab initio accuracy by capturing the femtosecond scale dielectric relaxation dynamics of the aqueous hydrogen bonding network, while extending the simulation capability to millisecond diffusion timescales. This extraordinary extension of the available length and time scales enables future studies of hydroxide mobility in functional materials such as nanostructured anion-exchange membranes, where hydroxide ions migrate through nanometer-sized channels. Remarkably, our approach demonstrates that a single AIMD trajectory is sufficient to predict hydroxide conductivity over a range of concentrations, underscoring its computational efficiency and relevance to the design of advanced energy materials.

Title: Factorizing Defects from Generalized Pinning Fields
Authors: Fedor K. Popov, Yifan Wang
Abstract: We introduce generalized pinning fields in conformal field theory that model a large class of critical impurities at large distance, enriching the familiar universality classes. We provide a rigorous definition of such defects as certain unbounded operators on the Hilbert space and prove that when inserted on codimension-one surfaces they factorize the spacetime into two halves. The factorization channels are further constrained by symmetries in the bulk. As a corollary, we solve such critical impurities in the 2d minimal models and establish the factorization phenomena previously observed for localized mass deformations in the 3d ${\rm O}(N)$ model.

Title: The Work Capacity of Channels with Memory: Maximum Extractable Work in Percept-Action Loops
Authors: Lukas J. Fiderer, Paul C. Barth, Isaac D. Smith, Hans J. Briegel
Abstract: Predicting future observations plays a central role in machine learning, biology, economics, and many other fields. It lies at the heart of organizational principles such as the variational free energy principle and has even been shown -- based on the second law of thermodynamics -- to be necessary for reaching the fundamental energetic limits of sequential information processing. While the usefulness of the predictive paradigm is undisputed, complex adaptive systems that interact with their environment are more than just predictive machines: they have the power to act upon their environment and cause change. In this work, we develop a framework to analyze the thermodynamics of information processing in percept-action loops -- a model of agent-environment interaction -- allowing us to investigate the thermodynamic implications of actions and percepts on equal footing. To this end, we introduce the concept of work capacity -- the maximum rate at which an agent can expect to extract work from its environment. Our results reveal that neither of two previously established design principles for work-efficient agents -- maximizing predictive power and forgetting past actions -- remains optimal in environments where actions have observable consequences. Instead, a trade-off emerges: work-efficient agents must balance prediction and forgetting, as remembering past actions can reduce the available free energy. This highlights a fundamental departure from the thermodynamics of passive observation, suggesting that prediction and energy efficiency may be at odds in active learning systems.

Title: Diagrammatic expansion for the mutual-information rate in the realm of limited statistics
Authors: Tobias Kühn, Gabriel Mahuas, Ulisse Ferrari
Abstract: Neurons in sensory systems encode stimulus information into their stochastic spiking response. The Mutual information has been broadly applied to these systems to quantify the neurons' capacity of transmitting such information. Yet, while for discrete stimuli, like flashed images or single tones, its computation is straightforward, for dynamical stimuli it is necessary to compute a (mutual) information rate (MIR), therefore integrating over the multiple temporal correlations which characterize sensory systems. Previous methods are based on extensive sampling of the neuronal response, require large amounts of data, and are therefore prone to biases and inaccuracy. Here, we develop Moba-MIRA (moment-based mutual-information-rate approximation), a computational method to estimate the mutual information rate. To derive Moba-MIRA, we use Feynman diagrams to expand the mutual information in arbitrary orders in the correlations around the corresponding value for the empirical spike count distributions of single binss. As a result, only the empirical estimation of the pairwise correlations between time bins and the single-bin entropies are required, without the need for the whole joint probability distributions. We tested Moba-MIRA on synthetic data generated with generalized linear models, and showed that it requires only a few tens of stimulus repetitions to provide an accurate estimate of the information rate. Finally, we applied it to ex-vivo electrophysiological recordings of rats retina, obtaining rates ranging between 5 to 20 bits per second, consistent with earlier estimates.

Title: Continuum Limit of Dendritic Deposition
Authors: Daniel Jacobson, Thomas F. Miller III
Abstract: Continuum models are commonly used to study dendritic deposition in fields ranging from nonequilibrium statistical mechanics to battery research. However, the continuum approximation underlying these models is poorly understood, even in the simplified case of Brownian particles depositing onto a small, reactive cluster. Specifically, this system transitions from a compact to a dendritic morphology at a critical radius that depends on the particle size. But in simulations of the continuum (small-particle) limit, the critical radius does not reproduce the scaling predicted by a purely continuum analysis. This discrepancy suggests that continuum models may not be able to capture the microscopic physics of dendrite formation, raising doubts about their experimental relevance. To clarify the continuum limit of dendritic deposition, here, we reexamine the critical radius scaling of the Brownian particle system using Brownian dynamics simulations. Compared to past studies, we probe larger system sizes, up to hundreds of millions of particles in some cases, and adopt an improved paradigm for the surface reaction. This paradigm allows us to converge our simulations and to work with well-defined physical parameters. Our results show that the critical radius scaling is, in fact, consistent with the continuum analysis, validating the continuum approach to modeling dendritic deposition. Nonetheless, the Brownian particle system converges to its continuum limit slowly. As a result, when applying continuum models to more complex deposition processes, the continuum approximation itself may be a significant source of error.

Title: Discontinuous shear thickening of a moderately dense inertial suspension of hydrodynamically interacting frictionless soft particles
Authors: Satoshi Takada, Kazuhiro Hara, Hisao Hayakawa
Abstract: We demonstrate that discontinuous shear thickening (DST) can occur even in moderately dense, inertial suspensions of hydrodynamically interacting, frictionless soft particles. Using the Lubrication-Friction Discrete Element Method, our simulations reveal that DST can emerge at lower particle densities, provided that both the inertia of the suspended particles and their softness are sufficiently pronounced. Furthermore, we show that, under these conditions, the DST behavior obtained from the simulation qualitatively agrees with that predicted by kinetic theory, even without accounting for hydrodynamic interactions. These findings expand the understanding of DST in soft particle systems and highlight the importance of particle inertia and softness in controlling rheological behavior.

Title: Scaling behaviors at quantum and classical first-order transitions
Authors: Andrea Pelissetto, Ettore Vicari
Abstract: We consider quantum and classical first-order transitions, at equilibrium and under out-of-equilibrium conditions, mainly focusing on quench and slow quasi-adiabatic protocols. For these phenomena, we review the finite-size scaling theory appropriate to describe the general features of the large-scale, and long-time for dynamic phenomena, behavior of finite-size systems.

Title: The electronic structure of intrinsic magnetic topological insulator MnBi2Te4 quantum wires
Authors: Jian Li, Zhu-Cai Yin, Qing-Xv Li, Jia-Ji Zhu
Abstract: The ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic nanostructure are crucial for fundamental spintronics devices, motivated by its potential application in spintronics, we theoretically investigate the electronic structure of the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases of the cylindrical intrinsically magnetic topological insulator $\mathrm{MnBi_{2}Te_{4}}$ quantum wires for both cases. We demonstrate that a few surface states exist between the bulk band gap in the ferromagnetic phase, with only one spin branch. In the antiferromagnetic phase, we show that three coexistent states exist between the energy gaps of the quantum wires.

Title: Engineering active motion in quantum matter
Authors: Yuanjian Zheng, Alexander P. Antonov, Benno Liebchen, Hartmut Löwen
Abstract: We introduce a framework for engineering active quantum matter that involves mimicking the role of self-propulsion through an external trapping potential that is moving along imposed trajectories traced by classical active dynamics. This approach in the presence of dissipation, not only recovers essential dynamical behavior of classical activity, including the ballistic to diffusive cross-over of its mean-square displacement, but also reveals additional features of activity that are of quantum origin. These quantum-active features are revealed in non-dissipative systems, and manifest as novel exponents of the mean-square displacement at short timescales.

Title: Explicit Solutions in Isotropic Planar Elastostatics
Authors: Andreas Granath, Per Åhag, Antti Perälä, Rafał Czyż
Abstract: Addressing the intricate challenges in plane elasticity, especially with non-vanishing traction and complex geometries, requires innovative methods. This paper offers a novel approach, drawing inspiration from the Neumann problem for the inhomogeneous Cauchy-Riemann equations. Our method applies to domains conformally equivalent to a unit disk or an annulus, focusing on deriving explicit solutions for the displacement field rather than the stress tensor, which distinguishes it from most traditional approaches. We explore solutions for specific classical cases to demonstrate its efficacy, such as a cardioid domain, a ring domain with a shifted hole, and a gear-like structure. This work enhances the toolkit for researchers and practitioners tackling isotropic planar elastostatic challenges with a unified and flexible approach.

Title: Low energy electrodynamics and a hidden Fermi liquid in the heavy-fermion CeCoIn$_5$
Authors: L.Y. Shi, Zhenisbek Tagay, Jiahao Liang, Khoan Duong, Yi Wu, F. Ronning, Darrell G. Schlom, K.M. Shen, N.P. Armitage
Abstract: We present time-domain THz spectroscopy of thin films of the heavy-fermion superconductor CeCoIn$_5$. Below the $\approx$ 40 K Kondo coherence temperature, a narrow Drude-like peak forms, as the result of the $f$ orbital - conduction electron hybridization and the formation of the heavy-fermion state. The complex optical conductivity is analyzed through a Drude model and extended Drude model analysis. Via the extended Drude model analysis, we measure the frequency-dependent scattering rate ($1/ \tau $) and effective mass ($m^*/m_b$). This scattering rate shows a linear dependence on temperature, which matches the dependence of the resistivity as expected. Nevertheless, the width of the low-frequency Drude peak itself that is set by the {\it renormalized} quasiparticle scattering rate ($1 / \tau^* = m_b/ m^* \tau $) shows a $T^2$ dependence. This is the scattering rate that characterizes the relaxation time of the renormalized quasiparticles. This gives evidence for Fermi liquid state, which in conventional transport experiments is hidden by the strong temperature dependent mass.

Title: Competing interlayer interactions in twisted monolayer-bilayer graphene: From spontaneous electric polarization to quasi-magic angle
Authors: Wei-En Tseng, Mei-Yin Chou
Abstract: The family of moiré materials provides a powerful platform for tuning interlayer couplings via the twist angle in systems with large spatial periodicity. In trilayer graphene systems, interlayer couplings at the two interfaces can possibly be tuned separately, and the competition between these interactions can therefore influence the electronic structure in a significant way. In this study, we investigate the electronic properties of twisted monolayer-bilayer graphene (aAB) beyond the continuum model, using first-principles calculations combined with an accurate tight-binding model. We find that at large twist angles, the electronic features of aAB are well described by the interaction between the parabolic bands of the Bernal AB-bilayer and the Dirac bands of the twisted monolayer, resulting in a spontaneous electric polarization in the former that splits the parabolic bands. As the twist angle decreases, the coupling between adjacent layers at the twisted interface becomes dominant, which makes aAB look like twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) interacting with the outer Bernal layer. A moiré potential emerges in the TBG-like layers, leading to charge localization, while the outer Bernal layer exhibits charge delocalization with substantial sublattice polarization at the atomic scale. Furthermore, we identify narrow bands with a minimum width at a quasi-magic angle of 1.16 degrees, closely matching the magic angle of TBG. The enhanced electron correlation expected in these narrow bands suggests that aAB is a promising platform for exploring correlated electronic phenomena.

Title: Exploiting bias in optimal finite-time copying protocols
Authors: Daan Mulder, Pieter Rein ten Wolde, Thomas E. Ouldridge
Abstract: We study a finite-time cyclic copy protocol that creates persisting correlations between a memory and a data bit. The average work to copy the two states of the data bit consists of the mutual information created between the memory and data bit after copying, a cost due to the difference between the initial and final states of the memory bit, and a finite-time cost. At low copy speeds, the optimal initial distribution of the memory bit matches the bias in the expected outcome, set by the bias in the data bit and the copying accuracies. However, if both states of the data are copied with the same accuracy, then in the high-speed regime copying the unlikely data bit state becomes prohibitively costly with a biased memory; the optimal initial distribution is then pushed towards 50:50. Copying with unequal accuracies, at fixed copy-generated mutual information, yields an opposite yet more effective strategy. Here, the initial memory distribution becomes increasingly biased as the copy speed increases, drastically lowering the work and raising the maximum speed. This strategy is so effective that it induces a symmetry breaking transition for an unbiased data bit.

Title: Universal quantum dynamics of Bose polarons
Authors: Jiří Etrych, Gevorg Martirosyan, Alec Cao, Christopher J. Ho, Zoran Hadzibabic, Christoph Eigen
Abstract: Predicting the emergent properties of impurities immersed in a quantum bath is a fundamental challenge that can defy quasiparticle treatments. Here, we measure the spectral properties and real-time dynamics of mobile impurities injected into a weakly interacting homogeneous Bose-Einstein condensate, using two broad Feshbach resonances to tune both the impurity-bath and intrabath interactions. For attractive impurity-bath interactions, the impurity spectrum features a single branch, which away from the resonance corresponds to a well-defined attractive polaron; near the resonance we observe dramatic broadening of this branch, suggesting a breakdown of the quasiparticle picture. For repulsive impurity-bath interactions, the spectrum features two branches: the attractive branch that is dominated by excitations with energy close to that of the Feshbach dimer, but has a many-body character, and the repulsive polaron branch. Our measurements show that the behavior of impurities in weakly interacting baths is remarkably universal, controlled only by the bath density and a single dimensionless interaction parameter.

Title: Oscillating-charged Andreev Bound States and Their Appearance in UTe$_2$
Authors: Satoshi Ando, Shingo Kobayashi, Andreas P. Schnyder, Yasuhiro Asano, Satoshi Ikegaya
Abstract: Surface Andreev bound states, including Majorana bound states in topological superconductors, are typically charge neutral. In this work, we demonstrate the emergence of unconventional charged Andreev bound states in a superconductor with a sublattice degree of freedom, where the sign of charge density of the Andreev bound states oscillates between the two sublattices. The oscillating-charged Andreev bound states lead to a complete breakdown of the proportionality among the electron part of the spectral function, the local density of states, and the tunneling conductance spectrum for energies below the superconducting gap. We also discuss the possible occurrence of these Andreev bound states in UTe$_2$ and locally noncentrosymmetric superconductors.

Title: Spin-polarized Specular Andreev Reflections in Altermagnets
Authors: Yutaro Nagae, Andreas P. Schnyder, Satoshi Ikegaya
Abstract: We show theoretically that specular Andreev reflection occurs stably at altermagnet--superconductor interfaces, which is a phenomenon that has previously been predicted only in a limited range of materials, such as Dirac/Weyl materials with fine-tuned chemical potentials. Furthermore, the characteristic spin-split bands of the altermagnet lead to a distinctive spin polarization in the specular Andreev reflections. By utilizing this feature, we propose a device that integrates the functions of both a Cooper pair splitter and a spin beam splitter, thereby creating energy-entangled electron pairs. The positive nonlocal conductance and the positive noise cross-correlation are unambiguous signatures of specular Andreev reflections in the proposed device.

Title: Entropy estimation in a spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate
Authors: Yannick Deller, Martin Gärttner, Tobias Haas, Markus K. Oberthaler, Moritz Reh, Helmut Strobel
Abstract: We investigate the information extractable from measurement distributions of two non-commuting spin observables in a multi-well spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate. We provide a variety of analytic and numerical evidence that suitably chosen classical entropies and classical mutual informations thereof contain the typical feature of quantum entropies known in quantum field theories, that is, the area law, even in the non-Gaussian regime and for a non-zero temperature. Towards a feasible experimental implementation, we estimate entropic quantities from a finite number of samples without any additional assumptions on the underlying quantum state using k-nearest neighbor estimators.

Title: Hall response in interacting bosonic and fermionic ladders
Authors: R. Citro, T. Giamarchi, E. Orignac
Abstract: We use bosonization, retaining band curvature terms, to analyze the Hall response of interacting bosonic and fermionic two-leg ladders threaded by a flux. We derive an explicit expression of the Hall imbalance in a perturbative expansion in the band curvature, retaining fully the interactions. We show that the flux dependence of the Hall imbalance allows to distinguish the two phases (Meissner and Vortex) that are present for a bosonic ladder. For small magnetic field we relate the Hall resistance, both for bosonic and fermionic ladders, to the density dependence of the charge sitffness of the system in absence of flux. Our expression unveil a universal interaction-independent behavior in the Galilean invariant case.

Title: Single Atom Substituents in Copper Surfaces May Adsorb Multiple CO Molecules
Authors: Magnus A. H. Christiansen, Alejandro Peña-Torres, Elvar Ö. Jónsson, Hannes Jónsson
Abstract: Copper is a good CO2 electroreduction catalyst as products beyond CO form, but efficiency and selectivity is low. Experiments have shown that admixture of other elements can help, and computational screening studies have pointed out various promising candidates based on the adsorption of a single CO molecule as a descriptor. Our calculations of CO adsorption on surfaces where a first row transition metal atom replaces a Cu atom show that multiple CO molecules, not just one, bind to the substitutional atom. For Fe, Co, and Ni atoms, a decrease in binding energy is found, but the reverse trend, namely increasing bond strength, is found for V, Cr, and Mn and the first three CO molecules. Magnetic moment, charge, and position of the substitutional atom are also strongly affected by the CO adsorption in most cases. Magnetic moment is stepwise reduced to zero, and the outward displacement of the substitutional atom increased.

Title: Tunable second harmornic in altermagnetic Josephson junctions
Authors: Hai-Peng Sun, Song-Bo Zhang, Chang-An Li, Björn Trauzettel
Abstract: We study the influence of external electric and Zeeman fields on the Josephson effect in a planar superconductor/altermagnet/superconductor junction. Remarkably, we find that the current-phase relation (CPR) can be forward or backward skewed due to a pronounced second harmonic term. It decisively depends on the altermagnetic field strength. This second harmonic can be measured directly using double SQUID devices. The CPR skewness can be effectively manipulated by electric gating. Moreover, we identify two additional impacts of external electric and magnetic fields on the Josephson current: (i) Fields can induce 0-$\pi$ transitions. (ii) Fields can substantially enhance the critical current. This enhancement is surprising since supercurrents are typically suppressed by magnetic fields.

Title: Extrinsic Orbital Hall Effect: Orbital Skew Scattering and Crossover Between Diffusive and Intrinsic Orbital Transport
Authors: Alessandro Veneri, Tatiana G. Rappoport, Aires Ferreira
Abstract: Despite the recent success of identifying experimental signatures of the orbital Hall effect (OHE), the research on the microscopic mechanisms behind this unique phenomenon is still in its infancy. Here, using a gapped 2D Dirac material as a model system of the OHE, we develop a microscopic theory of orbital transport which captures extrinsic disorder effects non-perturbatively. We show that it predicts several hitherto unknown effects, including (i) a strong dependence of the orbital Hall conductivity with the strength and symmetry of the impurity scattering potential, and (ii) a smooth crossover from intrinsic to extrinsic OHE as a function of the Fermi energy and impurity density. In contrast to previous (perturbative) studies, the OHE is found to exhibit bona fide diffusive behavior in the dilute impurity limit, which we trace back to the dominance of skew scattering-type processes. More generally, we argue that the newly unveiled orbital skew scattering mechanism governs the diffusive OHEs of a large class of 2D materials even when the crystal structure is inversion-symmetric. Our work unveils the crucial nature of non-perturbative vertex corrections for a complete description of orbital transport and confirms common short-range impurities as key enablers of the OHE.

Title: There is Nothing Anomalous about 'Anomalous' Underscreening in Concentrated Electrolytes
Authors: Sophie Baker, Gareth R. Elliott, Erica J. Wanless, Grant B. Webber, Vincent S. J. Craig, Alister J. Page
Abstract: Over the last decade, experimental measurements of electrostatic screening lengths in concentrated electrolytes have exceeded theoretical predictions by orders of magnitude. This disagreement has led to a paradigm in which such screening lengths are referred to as 'anomalous underscreening', while moderate screening lengths - predominantly those predicted by theory and molecular simulation - are referred to as 'normal underscreening'. Herein we use discrete Fourier analysis of the radial charge density obtained from molecular dynamics simulations to confirm the presence of many electrostatic screening modes present at any one time. We present a new approach for extracting screening lengths directly from the bulk charge density that reveals the origins of both normal and anomalous underscreening. These results reconcile a decades-old disagreement between experimental measurements and theoretical predictions of screening lengths in concentrated electrolytes.

Title: Ground State Phase Diagram of $\text{SU}(3)$ $t$-$J$ Chain
Authors: Junhao Zhang, Jie Hou, Jie Lou, Yan Chen
Abstract: Distinct from the $\text{SU}(2)$ case, the fermionic systems with $\text{SU}(N)$ symmetry are expected to exhibit novel physics, such as exotic singlet formation. Using the density matrix renormalization group technique, we obtain the ground state phase diagram of the $\text{SU}(3)$ $t$-$J$ chain for density $n<1$. The ground state phase diagram includes the Luttinger liquid, the extended Luther-Emery liquid characterized by a spin gap, and the phase separation state. We quantitatively assess the characteristics of the three phases by measuring spin gap, compressibility, various correlation functions and structure factors. We further study the extended Luther-Emery liquid phase and discover molecular superfluid quasi-long-range order. The mechanism of the molecular superfluid is the combination of three $\text{SU}(3)$ fermions on sites that are not completely connected. Accordingly, we can speculate the behavior of the $\text{SU}(N)$ $t$-$J$ chain model with larger $N$ values, operating within the same filling regime.

Title: Anomalous Order in $R_3\text{Ni}_{30}\text{B}_{10}$ $(R = \text{La}, \text{Ce})$
Authors: Maximilien F. Debbas, Takehito Suzuki, Joseph G. Checkelsky
Abstract: We report the synthesis of single crystals of the $R_3\text{Ni}_{30}\text{B}_{10}$ $(R = \text{La}, \text{Ce})$ system which realizes the tetragonal $P4/nmm$ (No. 129) space group. We performed single crystal, transmission X-ray diffraction measurements to determine the crystal structure. Additionally, we characterized the samples through magnetization, resistivity, and heat capacity measurements. The $R = \text{Ce}$ system exhibits mixed-valence states and we observe maxima in the heat capacity at $T_1^* = 6 \, \text{K}$ and $T_2^* = 2 \, \text{K}$ (both absent for $R = \text{La}$) with no corresponding features in the resistivity or magnetization. We discuss the potential roles of multipolar and short-ranged/partial order in connection to the $T_1^*$ anomalous order.

Title: Dual-Space Invariance as a Definitive Signature of Critical States in Anderson Localization
Authors: Tong Liu
Abstract: Critical states represent a fundamental and fascinating research frontier in Anderson localization physics, known for their non-ergodic properties, including multifractal structure and self-similarity. However, exactly characterizing critical states continues to pose a significant challenge up to now. In this work, we establish a universal mechanism demonstrating that critical states must maintain dual-space invariance in both position and momentum representations, leading to delocalized dynamics in both spaces. Therefore, our discovery soundly answers this long-standing unsolved puzzle regarding the definition of the critical state and its rigorous characterization. Furthermore, keeping pace with the idea of Liu-Xia criterion, we prove rigorously that physical quantities being directly observed in experiments, such as the inverse participation ratio and information entropy, exhibit invariance in both position and momentum spaces as expected. Subsequent numerical simulations provide the smoking gun for the correctness of the dual-space invariance, thereby not only highlighting the universality of the rigorous mechanism, but also establishing a robust foundation for future experimental validation of critical states.

Title: Comparing the 3D morphology of solid-oxide fuel cell anodes for different manufacturing processes, annealing times, and operating temperatures
Authors: Sabrina Weber, Benedikt Prifling, Martin Juckel, Yanting Liu, Matthias Wieler, Daniel Schneider, Britta Nestler, Norbert H. Menzler, Volker Schmidt
Abstract: Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) are becoming increasingly important due to their high electrical efficiency, the flexible choice of fuels and relatively low emissions of pollutants. However, the increasingly growing demands for electrochemical devices require further performance improvements. Since it is well known that the 3D morphology of the electrodes, which is significantly influenced by the underlying manufacturing process, has a profound impact on the resulting performance, a deeper understanding for the structural changes caused by modifications of the manufacturing process or degradation phenomena is desirable. In the present paper, we investigate the influence of the annealing time and the operating temperature on the 3D morphology of SOFC anodes using 3D image data obtained by focused-ion beam scanning electron microscopy, which is segmented into gadolinium-doped ceria, nickel and pore space. In addition, structural differences caused by manufacturing the anode via infiltration or powder technology, respectively, are analyzed quantitatively by means of various geometrical descriptors such as specific surface area, length of triple phase boundary per unit volume, mean geodesic tortuosity, and constrictivity. The computation of these descriptors from 3D image data is carried out both globally as well as locally to quantify the heterogeneity of the anode structure.

Title: Generator of Neural Network Potential for Molecular Dynamics: Constructing Robust and Accurate Potentials with Active Learning for Nanosecond-scale Simulations
Authors: Naoki Matsumura, Yuta Yoshimoto, Tamio Yamazaki, Tomohito Amano, Tomoyuki Noda, Naoki Ebata, Takatoshi Kasano, Yasufumi Sakai
Abstract: Neural network potentials (NNPs) enable large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of systems containing >10,000 atoms with the accuracy comparable to ab initio methods and play a crucial role in material studies. Although NNPs are valuable for short-duration MD simulations, maintaining the stability of long-duration MD simulations remains challenging due to the uncharted regions of the potential energy surface (PES). Currently, there is no effective methodology to address this issue. To overcome this challenge, we developed an automatic generator of robust and accurate NNPs based on an active learning (AL) framework. This generator provides a fully integrated solution encompassing initial dataset creation, NNP training, evaluation, sampling of additional structures, screening, and labeling. Crucially, our approach uses a sampling strategy that focuses on generating unstable structures with short interatomic distances, combined with a screening strategy that efficiently samples these configurations based on interatomic distances and structural features. This approach greatly enhances the MD simulation stability, enabling nanosecond-scale simulations. We evaluated the performance of our NNP generator in terms of its MD simulation stability and physical properties by applying it to liquid propylene glycol (PG) and polyethylene glycol (PEG). The generated NNPs enable stable MD simulations of systems with >10,000 atoms for 20 ns. The predicted physical properties, such as the density and self-diffusion coefficient, show excellent agreement with the experimental values. This work represents a remarkable advance in the generation of robust and accurate NNPs for organic materials, paving the way for long-duration MD simulations of complex systems.

Title: Chiral anomaly and internode scatterings in multifold semimetals
Authors: Ipsita Mandal
Abstract: In our quest to unravel the topological properties of nodal points in three-dimensional semimetals, one hallmark property which warrants our attention is the \textit{chiral anomaly}. In the Brillouin zone (BZ), the sign of the Berry-curvature field's monopole charge is referred to as the chirality ($\chi$) of the node, leading to the notion of chiral quasiparticles sourcing chiral currents, induced by internode scatterings proportional to the chiral anomaly. Here, we derive the generic form of the chiral conductivity when we have multifold nodes. Since the sum of all the monopole charges in the BZ is constrained to vanish, the nodes appear in pairs of $\chi =\pm 1$. Hence, the presence of band-crossing degeneracies of order higher than two make it possible to have two distinct scenarios: the pair of conjugate nodes in question comprise bands of (1) the same pseudospin variety and exhibiting Berry-curvature profiles differing by an overall factor of $\chi$, or (2) two distinct pseudospin representations. Covering these two possibilities, we apply our derived formula to semimetals harbouring triple-point (threefold-degenerate) and Rarita-Schwinger-Weyl (fourfold-degenerate) nodes, and show the resulting expressions for the conductivity featuring the chiral anomaly.

Title: Entropy estimation for partially accessible Markov networks based on imperfect observations: Role of finite resolution and finite statistics
Authors: Jonas H. Fritz, Benjamin Ertel, Udo Seifert
Abstract: Estimating entropy production from real observation data can be difficult due to finite resolution in both space and time and finite measurement statistics. We characterize the statistical error introduced by finite sample size and compare the performance of three different entropy estimators under these limitations for two different paradigmatic systems, a four-state Markov network and an augmented Michaelis-Menten reaction scheme. We consider the thermodynamic uncertainty relation, a waiting-time based estimator for resolved transitions and a waiting-time based estimator for blurred transitions in imperfect observation scenarios. For perfect measurement statistics and finite temporal resolution, the estimator based on resolved transitions performs best in all considered scenarios. The thermodynamic uncertainty relation gives a better estimate than the estimator based on blurred transitions at low driving affinities, whereas the latter performs better at high driving affinities. Furthermore, we find that a higher temporal and spatial resolution leads to slower convergence of measurement statistics, implying that for short measurement times, a lower resolution may be beneficial. Additionally, we identify a self-averaging effect for the waiting-time based entropy estimators that can reduce their variance for observations with finite statistics.

Title: Vision transformer based Deep Learning of Topological indicators in Majorana Nanowires
Authors: Jacob R. Taylor, Sankar Das Sarma
Abstract: 1D superconductor-semiconductor nanowires are the leading candidates for topological quantum computation due to their ability to host non-Abelian Majorana zero modes (MZMs). However, the standard methods for identifying MZMs are often inadequate, particularly in the presence of disorder, where many properties considered to be heralds of MZMs are often generated by trivial disorder induced Andreev bound states. Recent works clearly indicate the need for developing new techniques for identifying and diagnosing MZMs. In this study, we utilize a generalized Vision Transformer-based neural network to predict, using tunnel conductance measurements, both whether a device manifests a topological MZMs phase in the presence of disorder, and also to map out the entire topological phase diagram. We show the ability of our method up to arbitrary confidence ($P>0.9998$) in classifying a device as possessing a non-trivial MZM-carrying topological phase for a wide variety of disorder parameters. We demonstrate an ability to predict from conductance measurements alternative (to the extensively used scattering-matrix-invariant topological indicator) Majorana indicators based on local density of states (LDOS). This is relevant since topology may not be uniquely defined by the scattering invariant in short disordered wires. This work serves as a significant advance offering a step towards the practical realization of Majorana-based quantum devices, enabling a deep-learning understanding of the topological properties in disordered nanowire systems. We validate our method using extensive simulated Majorana results in the presence of disorder, and suggest using this technique for the analysis of experimental data in superconductor-semiconductor hybrid Majorana platforms.

Title: Tunable Enhancement of Magnetization Dynamics by Crystal Cut at Interface Exchange Coupled $α$-Fe$_2$O$_3$/NiFe Heterostructures
Authors: Hassan Al-Hamdo, Tobias Wagner, Philipp Schwenke, Gutenberg Kendzo, Maximilian Dausend, Laura Scheuer, Misbah Yaqoob, Vitaliy I. Vasyuchka, Philipp Pirro, Olena Gomonay, Mathias Weiler
Abstract: We investigate spin dynamics in $\alpha$-Fe$_{2}$O$_{3}$/Ni$_{80}$Fe$_{20}$ (Py) heterostructures, uncovering a robust mechanism for in-situ modulation of ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) through precise control of temperature, applied magnetic field and crystal orientation. Employing cryogenic ferromagnetic resonance spectroscopy, we demonstrate that the interfacial coupling between the Néel vector of $\alpha$-Fe$_{2}$O$_{3}$ and the magnetization of the Py layer is highly tunable across the Morin transition temperature $(T_M)$. Our experiments reveal distinct resonance behavior for different crystal orientations, highlighting the pivotal role of exchange coupling strength in dictating FMR frequencies. Theoretical modeling corroborates the experimental findings, elucidating the dependence of coupling on the relative alignment of the Néel vector and ferromagnetic magnetization. Notably, we achieve significant modulation of FMR frequencies by manipulating the Néel vector configuration, facilitated by temperature variations, applied magnetic fields and crystal orientation adjustments. These advancements demonstrate the potential for dynamic control of spin interactions in AFM/FM heterostructures, paving the way for the development of advanced spintronic devices with tunable magnetic properties. Our work provides critical insights into the fundamental interactions governing hybrid spin systems and opens new avenues for the design of versatile, temperature-responsive magnetoelectronic applications.

Title: Stochastic Resetting and Large Deviations

Abstract: Stochastic resetting has been a subject of considerable interest within statistical physics, both as means of improving completion times of complex processes such as searches and as a paradigm for generating nonequilibrium stationary states. In these lecture notes we give a self-contained introduction to the toy model of diffusion with stochastic resetting. We also discuss large deviation properties of additive functionals of the process such as the cost of resetting. Finally, we consider the generalisation from Poissonian resetting, where the resetting process occurs with a constant rate, to non-Poissonian resetting.

Title: Subband structure of a cylindrical HgTe nanowire: transition from normal type to inverted type
Authors: Rui Li
Abstract: Based on the $6\times6$ Kane model in the spherical approximation, both the electron and the hole subband dispersions in a cylindrical HgTe nanowire are calculated using analytical method. The transcendental equations determining the subband energies in the nanowire are analytically derived by utilizing both the total angular momentum conservation and the hard wall boundary condition. We show there exists topological band transition in the HgTe nanowire, very similar to that demonstrated in a HgTe quantum well. Via tuning the radius of the nanowire, we find there is a gap-closing-and-reopening transition in the subband structure. When the radius is larger than the critical radius $R_{\rm c}\approx3.2$ nm, the HgTe nanowire is in the inverted regime.

Title: Lattice T-duality from non-invertible symmetries in quantum spin chains
Authors: Salvatore D. Pace, Arkya Chatterjee, Shu-Heng Shao
Abstract: Dualities of quantum field theories are challenging to realize in lattice models of qubits. In this work, we explore one of the simplest dualities, T-duality of the compact boson CFT, and its realization in quantum spin chains. In the special case of the XX model, we uncover an exact lattice T-duality, which is associated with a non-invertible symmetry that exchanges two lattice U(1) symmetries. The latter symmetries flow to the momentum and winding U(1) symmetries with a mixed anomaly in the CFT. However, the charge operators of the two U(1) symmetries do not commute on the lattice and instead generate the Onsager algebra. We discuss how some of the anomalies in the CFT are nonetheless still exactly realized on the lattice and how the lattice U(1) symmetries enforce gaplessness. We further explore lattice deformations preserving both U(1) symmetries and find a rich gapless phase diagram with special $\mathrm{Spin}(2k)_1$ WZW model points and whose phase transitions all have dynamical exponent ${z>1}$.

Title: The Smearing of Quasi-Particles: Signatures in the Entanglement Entropy of Excited Many-Particle Systems
Authors: Jagannath Sutradhar, Jonathan Ruhman, Avraham Klein, Dimitri Gutman, Richard Berkovits
Abstract: The entanglement spectrum serves as a powerful tool for probing the structure and dynamics of quantum many-body systems, revealing key information about symmetry, topology, and excitations. While the entanglement entropy (EE) of ground states typically follows an area law, highly excited states obey a volume law, leading to a striking contrast in their scaling behavior. In this paper, we investigate the crossover between these two regimes, focusing on the role of quasi-particles (QPs) in mediating this transition. By analyzing the energy dependence of EE in various many-body systems, we explore how the presence of long-lived QPs influences the entanglement structure of excited states. We present numerical results for spinless fermions, a spin chain near a many-body localization transition, and the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, which lacks a conventional QP description. Our findings are complemented by a theoretical model based on Fermi liquid theory, providing insight into the interaction-dependent scaling of EE and its consistency with numerical simulations. We find that a hallmark of QPs is a linear dependence of the eigenstate EE on energy, which breaks down at high energy and in the limit of strong interaction. The slope of this linear dependence reflects the QP weight, which reduces with interaction strength.

Title: Active and transfer learning with partially Bayesian neural networks for materials and chemicals
Authors: Sarah I. Allec, Maxim Ziatdinov
Abstract: Active learning, an iterative process of selecting the most informative data points for exploration, is crucial for efficient characterization of materials and chemicals property space. Neural networks excel at predicting these properties but lack the uncertainty quantification needed for active learning-driven exploration. Fully Bayesian neural networks, in which weights are treated as probability distributions inferred via advanced Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, offer robust uncertainty quantification but at high computational cost. Here, we show that partially Bayesian neural networks (PBNNs), where only selected layers have probabilistic weights while others remain deterministic, can achieve accuracy and uncertainty estimates on active learning tasks comparable to fully Bayesian networks at lower computational cost. Furthermore, by initializing prior distributions with weights pre-trained on theoretical calculations, we demonstrate that PBNNs can effectively leverage computational predictions to accelerate active learning of experimental data. We validate these approaches on both molecular property prediction and materials science tasks, establishing PBNNs as a practical tool for active learning with limited, complex datasets.

Title: Rare Events and Single Big Jump Effects in Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Processes
Authors: Alberto Bassanoni, Alessandro Vezzani, Eli Barkai, Raffaella Burioni
Abstract: Even in a simple stochastic process, the study of the full distribution of time integrated observables can be a difficult task. This is the case of a much-studied process such as the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process where, recently, anomalous dynamical scaling of large deviations of time integrated functionals has been highlighted. Using the mapping of a continuous stochastic process to a continuous time random walk via the "excursions technique'', we introduce a comprehensive formalism that enables the calculation of the complete distribution of the time-integrated observable $A = \int_0^T v^n(t) dt$, where $n$ is a positive integer and $v(t)$ is the random velocity of a particle following Ornstein-Uhlenbeck dynamics. We reveal an interesting connection between the anomalous rate function associated with the observable $A$ and the statistics of the area under the first-passage functional during an excursion. The rate function of the latter, analyzed here for the first time, exhibits anomalous scaling behavior and a dynamical phase transition, both of which are explored in detail. The case of the anomalous scaling of large deviations, originally associated to the presence of an instantonic solution in the weak noise regime of a path integral approach, is here produced by a so called "big jump effect'', in which the contribution to rare events is dominated by the largest excursion. Our approach, which is quite general for continuous stochastic processes, allows to associate a physical meaning to the anomalous scaling of large deviations, through the big jump principle.

Title: Magnetism in symmetry-enforced nodal-line semimetals
Authors: Andressa R. Medeiros-Silva, Mariana Malard, Rodrigo G. Pereira, Thereza Paiva
Abstract: Nodal-line semimetals (NLSMs) harbor a variety of novel physical properties owing to the particularities of the band degeneracies that characterize the spectrum of these materials. In symmetry-enforced NLSMs, band degeneracies, being imposed by symmetries, are robust to arbitrarily strong perturbations that preserve the symmetries. We investigate the effects of electron-electron interactions on a recently proposed vacancy-engineered NLSM known as holey graphene. Using mean-field calculations and quantum Monte Carlo simulation, we show that the Hubbard model on the depleted holey-graphene lattice at half-filling exhibits a transition from a NLSM to an insulating antiferromagnetic phase for an arbitrarily weak repulsive interaction $U$. In contrast to the semi-metal-insulator transition in the pristine honeycomb lattice, which occurs at a finite critical value of $U$, in the depleted lattice, the transition at $U=0$ is associated with a van Hove singularity arising from the crossing of accidental nodal lines enforced by symmetry. We also employ linear spin wave theory (LSWT) to the effective Heisenberg model in the strong-coupling limit and obtain the global antiferromagnetic order parameter $m_{\rm AFM} \approx 0.146$. The order parameters from both QMC and LSWT agree quantitatively. Our findings indicate that vacancy engineering offers an effective way to tailor the magnetic properties of quantum materials.

Title: Tailoring Synthetic Gauge Fields in Ultracold Atoms via Spatially Engineered Vector Beams
Authors: Huan Wang, Shangguo Zhu, Yun Long, Mingbo Pu, Xiangang Luo
Abstract: Ultracold atoms, typically manipulated by scalar beams with uniform polarization, have propelled advances in quantum simulation, computation, and metrology. Yet, vector beams (VBs) -- structured light with spatially varying polarization -- remain unexplored in this context, despite their enhanced tunability and broad optical applications. Here, we demonstrate a novel scheme to generate synthetic gauge fields in ultracold atoms via VB-mediated coupling of internal states. This approach enables angular stripe phases across an expanded parameter range, achieving a three-order-of-magnitude enhancement in the phase diagram and facilitating experimental observation. We further present an all-optical method to create topologically nontrivial giant skyrmions in spin space, with tunable topology governed by VB parameters. Our findings establish VBs as powerful tools for quantum control and the exploration of exotic quantum states and phases.

Title: Exploring the defect landscape and dopability of chalcogenide perovskite BaZrS3
Authors: Rushik Desai (1), Shubhanshu Agarwal (2), Kiruba Catherine Vincent (2), Alejandro Strachan (1), Rakesh Agrawal (2), Arun Mannodi-Kanakkithodi (1) ((1) School of Materials Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA (2) School of Chemical Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA)
Abstract: BaZrS3 is a chalcogenide perovskite that has shown promise as a photovoltaic absorber, but its performance is limited because of defects and impurities that have a direct influence on carrier concentrations. Functional dopants that show lower donor-type or acceptor-type formation energies than naturally occurring defects can help tune the optoelectronic properties of BaZrS3. In this work, we applied first principles computations to comprehensively investigate the defect landscape of BaZrS3, including all intrinsic defects and a set of selected impurities and dopants. BaZrS3 intrinsically exhibits n-type equilibrium conductivity under both S-poor and S-rich conditions, which remains largely unchanged in the presence of O and H impurities. La and Nb dopants created stable donor-type defects, which made BaZrS3 even more n-type, whereas As and P dopants formed amphoteric defects with relatively high formation energies. This work highlights the difficulty of creating p-type BaZrS3 owing to the low formation energies of donor defects, both intrinsic and extrinsic. Defect formation energies were also used to compute expected defect concentrations and make comparisons with experimentally reported values. Our dataset of defects in BaZrS3 paves the path for training machine learning models to subsequently perform larger-scale prediction and screening of defects and dopants across many chalcogenide perovskites, including cation-site or anion-site alloys.

Title: Tunable pairing with local spin-dependent Rydberg molecule potentials in an atomic Fermi superfluid
Authors: Chih-Chun Chien, Seth T. Rittenhouse, S. I. Mistakidis, H. R. Sadeghpour
Abstract: We explore the energy spectrum and eigenstates of two-component atomic Fermi superfluids with tunable pairing interactions in the presence of spin-dependent ultra long-range Rydberg molecule (ULRM) potentials, within the Bogoliubov-de Gennes formalism. The attractive ULRM potentials lead to local density accumulation, while their difference results in a local polarization potential and induces the in-gap Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states whose energies lie below the bulk energy gap. A transition from equal-population to population-imbalance occurs as the pairing strength falls below a critical value, accompanied by the emergence of local Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) like states characterized by out-of-phase wave functions and lower energies compared to the YSR states. The negative contribution emanating from the FFLO-like states also causes a sign change in the gap function within the ULRM potentials. Depending on the Rydberg state generating the ULRM potentials, the transition towards population-imbalance can be on either the BCS or the Bose-Einstein condensation side of the Fermi superfluid. Additionally, spin-polarized bound states arise along with oscillatory ``clumpy states" to compensate for the local density difference. Finally, we discuss possible experimental realizations and measurements of the composite Rydberg atom-Fermi superfluid system.

Title: Experimental evidence of Tc enhancement above 50 K and diode and paramagnetic-Meissner effects, in Nickelate films on highly reduced $SrTiO_3$
Authors: Anna Eyal, Gad Koren
Abstract: Since the discovery of superconductivity in nickelate thin films in 2019, the quest for enhancing their $T_c$ has been ongoing. Here we provide experimental evidence for $T_c$ enhancement in oxygen deficient films on highly reduced and conducting $SrTiO_3$ substrates. $T_c$ onset of 50-70 K was found in Meissner and transport measurements, which indicates superconductivity in islands or domains in our films, where $T_c$ of zero resistance is obtained at 20-25 K. In addition, we observed a giant paramagnetic-Meissner effect peak at about 48 K, which further supports the existence of a superconductive transition just above it. Furthermore, an asymmetric or nonreciprocal and non-hysteretic superconductive diode effect was observed. The later could be fully polarized, and its polarity could be reversed. In our films we identified the infinite-layer 112 and the perovskite 113 phases, with a variety of oxygen stoichiometries in between.

Title: Symmetry breaking of large-amplitude parametric oscillations in few-layer graphene nanomechanical resonators
Authors: Chen Yang, YuBin Zhang, Heng Lu, Ce Zhang, FengNan Chen, Ying Yan, Fei Xue, Alexander Eichler, Joel Moser
Abstract: Graphene nanomechanical resonators are well suited for the study of parametric oscillations. Their large frequency tunability and their pronounced nonlinearities enable an efficient modulation of their resonant frequencies. Here, we present measurements of the response of few-layer graphene nanomechanical resonators, each driven by a large parametric pump at frequency $2\omega$ and a weak external drive at $\omega$, where $\omega$ is set near the mechanical resonant frequency $\omega_0$. The pump actuates the resonator beyond the threshold for large-amplitude parametric oscillations, while the drive breaks the symmetry between the parametric phase states. By increasing and decreasing a gate voltage to detune $\omega_0$ in the presence of the pump and the drive, we observe a double hysteresis in the response. The double hysteresis reveals the existence of two possible large-amplitude vibrational states whose phase difference is nearly $\pi$ radians. We deterministically prepare the resonator in either one of these states by cycling the gate voltage. We measure the stationary occupation probabilities of the two states in the presence of a white Gaussian force noise, and find that they strongly depend on the amplitude and on the phase of the external drive. The phase states of parametric oscillations with broken amplitude symmetry can be mapped to biased bi-modal degrees of freedom, such as Ising spins in an external magnetic field. Therefore, they hold promise as units of binary information.

Title: Electrical switching of Chern insulators in moire rhombohedral heptalayer graphene

Abstract: In orbital Chern insulators, the chemical potential acts as a tuning knob to reverse chirality in dissipationless edge currents, enabling electric-field control of magnetic order-key for future quantum electronics. Despite the rise of orbital Chern insulators, electrically switchable quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) remains rare, necessitating further investigation. Here, we demonstrate electric-field-induced reversal of orbital Chern insulators in a moire superlattice composed of rhombohedral heptalayer graphene (r-7LG) aligned with hexagonal boron nitride. At one electron per moire unit cell, two emerging Chern insulating phases - one pointing away from and the other toward graphene's charge neutrality point in the phase diagram of carrier density (n) versus magnetic field (B) - exhibit energetic competition modulated by both n and B. This switchable QAHE chirality in r-7LG demonstrates a layer-number dependent response: similar phenomena in moire r-6LG require much higher magnetic fields and are absent in thinner rhombohedral graphene. Our findings establish moire-engineered rhombohedral graphene as a promising platform for exploring topological quantum materials with electrically controllable chiral edge modes and magnetic order.

Title: A Materials Map Integrating Experimental and Computational Data via Graph-Based Machine Learning for Enhanced Materials Discovery
Authors: Yusuke Hashimoto, Xue Jia, Hao Li, Takaaki Tomai
Abstract: Materials informatics (MI), emerging from the integration of materials science and data science, is expected to significantly accelerate material development and discovery. The data used in MI are derived from both computational and experimental studies; however, their integration remains challenging. In our previous study, we reported the integration of these datasets by applying a machine learning model that is trained on the experimental dataset to the compositional data stored in the computational database. In this study, we use the obtained datasets to construct materials maps, which visualize the relationships between material properties and structural features, aiming to support experimental researchers. The materials map is constructed using the MatDeepLearn (MDL) framework, which implements materials property prediction using graph-based representations of material structure and deep learning modeling. Through statistical analysis, we find that the MDL framework using the message passing neural network (MPNN) architecture efficiently extracts features reflecting the structural complexity of materials. Moreover, we find that this advantage does not necessarily translate into improved accuracy in the prediction of material properties. We attribute this unexpected outcome to the high learning performance inherent in MPNN, which can contribute to the structuring of data points within the materials map.

Title: Charge-polarized superconducting state emerged in a superatomic antipolar metal

Abstract: Symmetry-defined order states play essential roles in determining the emergent exotic physical properties in condensed matter physics, including charge density wave (CDW), polar charge order, and superconducting (SC) states. Recently, the interweaved CDW and antipolar states have been discovered in a low-symmetric superatomic crystal of (Au6Te12Se8, ATS), while their delicate interplay with the following emergent SC state at lower temperature remains elusive. Here, we report a real-space experimental investigation on the coexistence and competition of CDW, polar and SC states in the metallic crystal of ATS using scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy combined with transport and Raman measurements. We show that the CDW order is gradually suppressed with the decreased temperature, and a further transformation from antipolar to ferrielectric-like order occurs with the inversion-symmetric broken at the SC state. These spatially observed the emergence and competition of the above ordered states coincide with the temperature-dependent transport and Raman measurements. We predict that the delicate interplay among these states may contribute exotic "hidden" orders in this superatomic metal, suggesting a unique platform for the exploration of intriguing quantum materials.

Title: Evolving transport properties of dynamic hydrogels enable self-tuning of short- and long-term cargo delivery
Authors: Samya Sen, Changxin Dong, Carolyn K. Jons, Ye Eun Song, Alexander N. Prossnitz, Eric A. Appel
Abstract: Hydrogels are crosslinked polymer networks with high water content widely utilized in biomedical applications. Injectable depot-forming hydrogels for drug delivery offer sustained release of biomolecular cargo, leveraging controlled macromolecular diffusion within dynamic networks to promote extended immunity and favorable immunological responses. However, mitigating burst release while maintaining sustained-release properties remains a challenge due to network disruption during needle extrusion, leading to excessive short-term cargo release and local toxicity. While controlling both short- and long-term release profiles would mitigate this issue, it remains a persistent challenge. Here, we present a hydrogel formulation strategy for self-regulating, post-injection network evolution enabled by exchange of functional molecules with physiological environment, achieving controlled cargo release over both short and long durations. By tuning network viscoelasticity, we optimized rheological properties to minimize burst release while preserving sustained-release profiles. Using model protein cargo, in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated reduced burst release and comparable sustained-release to unmodified control formulations. These findings highlight a novel strategy for precise cargo delivery in biomedical applications.

Title: Observation of Persistent Zero Modes and Superconducting Vortex Doublets in UTe$_2$
Authors: Nileema Sharma, Matthew Toole, James McKenzie, Fangjun Cheng, Sean Michael Thomas, Priscila F. S. Rosa, Yi-Ting Hsu, Xiaolong Liu
Abstract: Superconducting vortices can reveal electron pairing details and nucleate topologically protected states. Yet, vortices of bulk spin-triplet superconductors have never been visualized. Recently, UTe$_2$ has emerged as a nominative spin-triplet superconductor, but its superconducting order parameter is elusive, and whether time-reversal symmetry is broken remains unsettled. Here, we visualize superconducting vortices on the (011) surface of ultra-clean UTe$_2$ single crystals ($T_c=2.1 K$) using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). We introduce $\frac{d^2 I}{dV^2}$ imaging as an effective method for vortex visualization in superconductors with substantial residual zero-energy density of states (DOS), as in UTe$_2$. Anisotropic single-flux-quantum vortices, with coherence lengths of $\sim$ 12 nm (4 nm) parallel (perpendicular) to the a-axis, form a triangular vortex lattice (VL) under small out-of-plane magnetic fields. The vortex size decreases at higher fields, suggesting multi-band superconductivity. The robustness of vortex structures and VL against magnetic field polarity and cooling history strongly supports time-reversal invariant superconductivity. Spatially non-splitting and spectroscopically narrow zero-bias peaks (ZBPs) of differential conductance at vortex cores (VCs) persist up $8T$, well beyond the Pauli limit ($3.9T$), consistent with Majorana zero modes (MZMs) in a topological vortex line protected by a combination of mirror, time-reversal, and particle-hole symmetries. Close examination of vortex structures reveals a mirror-asymmetric doublet $--$ one with a singular core and another with an enhanced energy gap. Such unconventional vortices in a non-chiral $p$-wave superconductor could originate from the induction of a subdominant order parameter close to the VCs.

Title: Automated evaluation of imaginary time strong coupling diagrams by sum-of-exponentials hybridization fitting
Authors: Zhen Huang, Denis Golež, Hugo U. R. Strand, Jason Kaye
Abstract: We present an efficient separation of variables algorithm for the evaluation of imaginary time Feynman diagrams appearing in the bold pseudo-particle strong coupling expansion of the Anderson impurity model. The algorithm uses a fitting method based on AAA rational approximation and numerical optimization to obtain a sum-of-exponentials expansion of the hybridization function, which is then used to decompose the diagrams. A diagrammatic formulation of the algorithm leads to an automated procedure for diagrams of arbitrary order and topology. We also present methods of stabilizing the self-consistent solution of the pseudo-particle Dyson equation. The result is a low-cost and high-order accurate impurity solver for quantum embedding methods using general multi-orbital hybridization functions at low temperatures, appropriate for low-to-intermediate expansion orders. In addition to other benchmark examples, we use our solver to perform a dynamical mean-field theory study of a minimal model of the strongly correlated compound Ca$_2$RuO$_4$, describing the anti-ferromagnetic transition and the in- and out-of-plane anisotropy induced by spin-orbit coupling.

Title: The Fermi surface of RuO2 measured by quantum oscillations

Abstract: The metallic oxide RuO$_2$ has emerged as a promising altermagnet candidate, owing to reports of this material hosting antiferromagnetic ordering accompanied by a spin-split electronic band structure characteristic of time-reversal symmetry-breaking. However, recent studies have robustly questioned this scenario. Here we map the Fermi surface of pristine single-crystalline RuO$_2$. By measuring magnetic quantum oscillations of a bulk thermodynamic property, our study resolves the electronic structure present in the bulk of RuO$_2$. Several Fermi sheets are discerned, with a range of effective quasiparticle masses up to five times that of the bare electron mass. We compare our measurements with the predictions for altermagnetic and nonmagnetic Fermi surfaces deduced from density functional theory calculations. The quantum oscillatory frequency spectra correspond very poorly to the profile expected for the case of altermagnetism; by contrast, they correspond well to the nonmagnetic scenario. Our findings place significant constraints on the bulk magnetic properties of RuO$_2$, and strongly suggest that this material is a paramagnet.

Title: Momentum-Space AC Josephson Effect and Intervalley Coherence in Multilayer Graphene
Authors: Mainak Das, Chunli Huang
Abstract: Electron transport driven by the phase coherence and interference of quantum many-body wavefunctions is a fascinating phenomenon with potential technological significance. Superconductivity, for example, enables dissipationless transport through macroscopic phase twisting. Similarly, in charge-density waves, once the phase degree of freedom-representing the collective position of electrons relative to the lattice-is depinned, it generates characteristic broadband noise and intriguing AC-DC interference patterns. In this work, we point out a phase-coherent dynamics in the intervalley coherent (IVC) state, also known as the bond-ordered or Kekulé distorted state, frequently reported in rhombohedral multilayer graphene. Under a static magnetic field, the IVC state responds with an oscillating intervalley current, which in turn causes oscillating orbital magnetization, thereby inducing a detectable AC Hall effect. This mechanism mirrors the AC Josephson effect observed in superconductors but now happening in momentum space. In this analogy, the static magnetic field acts as the DC voltage, while the oscillating intervalley current assumes the role of the AC Josephson current. We present detailed microscopic calculations for all the parameters of the phase-number free-energy in rhombohedral trilayer graphene, predicting an orbital magnetization oscillation frequency of approximately 12 GHz at 0.1 Tesla. We comment on this phase-coherent dynamics in other 2D materials like twisted homobilayer transition metal dichalcogenides.

Title: A quantitative theory and atomistic simulation study on the soft-sphere crystal-melt interfacial properties: II. Interfacial free energies
Authors: Ya-Shen Wang, Zun Liang, Brian B. Laird, Yang Yang
Abstract: This study proposes a new method for predicting the crystal-melt interfacial free energy ($\gamma$) using the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) model, enhanced by atomistic simulation data for more accurate density wave profiles. The analysis focuses on the soft-sphere system governed by an inverse power potential that stabilizes both BCC and FCC phases. Equilibrium molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are used to obtain density wave amplitude distributions, which serve as inputs for the GL model to predict $\gamma$ and its anisotropy. The predicted $\gamma$ values exhibit strong agreement with prior benchmark simulation experimental studies, particularly for FCC crystal-melt interfaces (CMIs). The GL models for the CMI $\gamma$ are proved to be both computationally efficient and reasonably valid, offering quantitative predictions of $\gamma$ while providing insights into the factors controlling its magnitude and anisotropy. Key improvement is suggested for the variational procedure used in the two-mode CMI free energy functionals, and potential upgrades to the GL model are also proposed to further enhance predictive accuracy.

Title: Negative and positive anisotropic thermal expansion in 2D fullerene networks
Authors: Armaan Shaikh, Bo Peng
Abstract: We find a design principle for tailoring thermal expansion properties in molecular networks. Using 2D fullerene networks as a representative system, we realize positive thermal expansion along intermolecular [2+2] cycloaddition bonds and negative thermal expansion along intermolecular C$-$C single bonds by varying the structural frameworks of molecules. The microscopic mechanism originates from a combination of the framework's geometric flexibility and its transverse vibrational characteristics. Based on this insight, we find molecular networks beyond C$_{60}$ with tunable thermal expansion. These findings shed light on the fundamental mechanisms governing thermal expansion in molecular networks towards rational materials design.

Title: SymPlex Plots for Visualizing Properties in High-Dimensional Alloy Spaces
Authors: John Cavin, Pravan Omprakash, Adrien Couet, Rohan Mishra
Abstract: Conventional visualization tools such as phase diagrams and convex hulls are ill-suited to visualize multiple principal element alloys (MPEAs) due to their large compositional space that cannot be easily projected onto two dimensions. Here, SymPlex plots are introduced to enable the visualization of various properties along special paths in high-dimensional phase spaces of MPEAs. These are polar heatmaps that plot properties along high-symmetry paths radiating from the parent equimolar MPEA to a set of chosen lower-order compositions. SymPlex plots capture the changes in the energy landscape along the special paths and help visualize the effect of addition or substitution of components on the alloy stability, which can be especially useful to assess processing pathways for additive manufacturing. Thus, SymPlex plots can help guide design of MPEAs by showing connections between compositions and their properties in the high-dimensional phase space with more information concentrated near the equimolar region.

Title: Electronic Energy Scales of Cr$X_3$ ($X$ = Cl, Br, and I) using High-resolution X-ray Scattering
Authors: Chamini Pathiraja, Jayajeewana N. Ranhili, Deniz Wong, Christian Schulz, Yi-De Chuang, Yu-Cheng Shao, Di-Jing Huang, Hsiao-Yu Huang, Amol Singh, Byron Freelon
Abstract: Chromium tri-halides Cr$X_3$ ($X$ = Cl, Br, and I) have recently become a focal point of research due to their intriguing low-temperature,layer-dependent magnetism that can be manipulated by an electric field. This makes them essential candidates for spintronics applications. These magnetic orders are often related to the electronic structure parameters, such as spin-orbit coupling (SOC), Hund's coupling ($J_H$), $p-d$ covalency, and inter-orbital Coulomb interactions. Accurately determining such parameters is paramount for understanding Cr$X_3$ physics. We have used ultra high-resolution resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) spectroscopy to study Cr$X_3$ across phase transition temperatures. Ligand field multiplet calculations were used to determine the electronic structure parameters by incorporating the crystal field interactions in a distorted octahedral with $C_3$ symmetry. These methods provide the most detailed description of Cr$X_3$ magneto-optical and electronic energetic (terms) to date. For the first time, the crystal field distortion parameters $D\sigma$ and $D\tau$ were calculated, and the energies of $d$ orbitals have been reported. Our RIXS spectroscopic measurements reveal a clear energy separation between spin-allowed quartet states and spin-forbidden doublet states in Cr$X_3$. The role of SOC in Cr $2p$ orbitals for the spin-flip excitations has been demonstrated. The determined 10$Dq$ values are in good agreement with the spectrochemical series, and Racah B follows the Nephelauxetic effect. Such precise measurements offer insights into the energy design of spintronic devices that utilize quantum state tuning within 2D magnetic materials.

Title: Phonon properties and unconventional heat transfer in quasi-2D $Bi_2O_2Se$ crystal
Authors: Jan Zich, Antonín Sojka, Petr Levinský, Martin Míšek, Kyo-Hoon Ahn, Jiří Navrátil, Jiří Hejtmánek, Karel Knížek, Václav Holý, Dmitry Nuzhnyy, Fedir Borodavka, Stanislav Kamba, Čestmír Drašar
Abstract: Bi2O2Se belongs to a group of quasi-2D semiconductors that can replace silicon in future high-speed/low-power electronics. However, the correlation between crystal/band structure and other physical properties still eludes understanding: carrier mobility increases non-intuitively with carrier concentration; the observed $T^2$ temperature dependence of resistivity lacks explanation. Moreover, a very high relative out-of-plane permittivity of about 150 has been reported in the literature. A proper explanation for such a high permittivity is still lacking. We have performed infrared (IR) reflectivity and Raman scattering experiments on a large perfect single crystal with defined mosaicity, carrier concentration and mobility. Five of the eight phonons allowed by factor group theory have been observed and their symmetries determined. The IR spectra show that the permittivity measured in the tetragonal plane is as high as ${\epsilon}_r{\approx}500$, and this high value is due to a strong polar phonon with a low frequency of ~34 $cm^{-1}$ (~1 THz). Such an unusually high permittivity allows the screening of charge defects, leading to the observation of high electron mobility at low temperatures. It also allows effective modulation doping providing a platform for high performance 2D electronics. DFT calculations suggest the existence of a very low frequency acoustic phonon ~14 $cm^{-1}$ (~0.4 THz). Both the low frequency phonons cause anomalous phonon DOS, which is reflected in the unconventional temperature dependence of the heat capacity, $c_M{\approx}T^{3.5}$. The temperature-dependent, two-component group velocity is proposed to explains the unusual temperature dependence of the thermal conductivity, ${\kappa}{\approx}T^{1.5}$

Title: Efficient algorithms to solve atom reconfiguration problems. I. The redistribution-reconfiguration (red-rec) algorithm
Authors: Barry Cimring, Remy El Sabeh, Marc Bacvanski, Stephanie Maaz, Izzat El Hajj, Naomi Nishimura, Amer E. Mouawad, Alexandre Cooper
Abstract: We propose the redistribution-reconfiguration (red-rec) algorithm to prepare large configurations of atoms using arrays of dynamic optical traps. Red-rec exploits simple heuristics and exact subroutines to solve atom reconfiguration problems on grids. It admits a fast and efficient implementation suitable for real-time operation. We numerically quantify its performance using realistic physical parameters and operational constraints, both in the absence and presence of loss. Red-rec enables assembling large configurations of atoms with high mean success probability. Fast preparation times are achieved by harnessing parallel control operations that actuate multiple traps simultaneously. Faster preparation times are achieved by rejecting configurations of atoms containing fewer atoms than a given threshold. However, the number of traps required to prepare a compact-centered configuration of atoms on a grid with a probability of 0.5 scales as the 3/2 power of the number of desired atoms. This finding highlights some of the challenges associated with scaling up configurations of atoms beyond tens of thousands of atoms.

Title: Efficient algorithms to solve atom reconfiguration problems. II. The assignment-rerouting-ordering (aro) algorithm
Authors: Remy El Sabeh, Jessica Bohm, Zhiqian Ding, Stephanie Maaz, Naomi Nishimura, Izzat El Hajj, Amer E. Mouawad, Alexandre Cooper
Abstract: Programmable arrays of optical traps enable the assembly of configurations of single atoms to perform controlled experiments on quantum many-body systems. Finding the sequence of control operations to transform an arbitrary configuration of atoms into a predetermined one requires solving an atom reconfiguration problem quickly and efficiently. A typical approach to solve atom reconfiguration problems is to use an assignment algorithm to determine which atoms to move to which traps. This approach results in control protocols that exactly minimize the number of displacement operations; however, this approach does not optimize for the number of displaced atoms or the number of times each atom is displaced, resulting in unnecessary control operations that increase the execution time and failure rate of the control protocol. In this work, we propose the assignment-rerouting-ordering (aro) algorithm to improve the performance of assignment-based algorithms in solving atom reconfiguration problems. The aro algorithm uses an assignment subroutine to minimize the total distance traveled by all atoms, a rerouting subroutine to reduce the number of displaced atoms, and an ordering subroutine to guarantee that each atom is displaced at most once. The ordering subroutine relies on the existence of a partial ordering of moves that can be obtained using a polynomial-time algorithm that we introduce within the formal framework of graph theory. We numerically quantify the performance of the aro algorithm in the presence and in the absence of loss, and show that it outperforms the exact, approximation, and heuristic algorithms that we use as benchmarks. Our results are useful for assembling large configurations of atoms with high success probability and fast preparation time, as well as for designing and benchmarking novel atom reconfiguration algorithms.

Title: Classifying fermionic states via many-body correlation measures
Authors: Mykola Semenyakin, Yevheniia Cheipesh, Yaroslav Herasymenko
Abstract: Understanding the structure of quantum correlations in a many-body system is key to its computational treatment. For fermionic systems, correlations can be defined as deviations from Slater determinant states. The link between fermionic correlations and efficient computational physics methods is actively studied but remains ambiguous. We make progress in establishing this connection mathematically. In particular, we find a rigorous classification of states relative to $k$-fermion correlations, which admits a computational physics interpretation. Correlations are captured by a measure $\omega_k$, a function of $k$-fermion reduced density matrix that we call twisted purity. A condition $\omega_k=0$ for a given $k$ puts the state in a class $G_k$ of correlated states. Sets $G_k$ are nested in $k$, and Slater determinants correspond to $k = 1$. Classes $G_{k=O(1)}$ are shown to be physically relevant, as $\omega_k$ vanishes or nearly vanishes for truncated configuration-interaction states, perturbation series around Slater determinants, and some nonperturbative eigenstates of the 1D Hubbard model. For each $k = O(1)$, we give an explicit ansatz with a polynomial number of parameters that covers all states in $G_k$. Potential applications of this ansatz and its connections to the coupled-cluster wavefunction are discussed.

Title: Simplified functional flow equation
Authors: C. Wetterich
Abstract: We adapt the precise definition of the flowing effective action in order to obtain a functional flow equation with simple properties close to physical intuition. The simplified flow equation is invariant under local gauge transformations and suitable for both euclidean and Minkowski signature and analytic continuation. The cutoff always removes fluctuations close to zeros of the inverse full propagator. A formulation of the simplified flow equation in terms of renormalized scale invariant fields permits direct access to scaling solutions and associated fixed points. Our setting is based on a particular choice of cutoff function which depends on the macroscopic fields. Corrections to the simplified flow equation involve a field-dependent modification of the cutoff for which we discuss a systematic expansion. Truncated solutions for a scalar field theory in four dimensions suggest a new fixed point with a field-dependent coefficient of the kinetic term.

Title: Projected Augmented Waves (PAW) motivated mixed basis sets for small molecules
Authors: Garry Goldstein
Abstract: The success behind many pseudopotential methods, such as the Projected Augmented Waves (PAW) and the Phillips-Kleinman pseudopotential methods, is that these methods are nearly all electron methods in disguise. For the Phillips-Kleinman and PAW pseudopotential methods we show that there is an explicit all electron reformulation (which is nearly equivalent). In the all electron reformulation, as part of the basis set, there are regular low wavevector basis wave functions (plane waves) and several, specially chosen, high wavevector basis wave functions that are specialized to the atomic environment relevant to nuclei of the substances studied. Using this as motivation, here we propose a new, PAW method motivated, basis set for small molecules, where we use the LO or lo (Localized Orbitals) basis wave functions, and pair them with a Gaussian basis, e.g. Gaussian Type Orbitals (GTO), for a hybrid basis for small molecules. Contracted Gaussian functions are also possible (CGFs). Several different, but related, LO (lo) basis wave functions are considered. We also show how to extend this idea to Slater basis set, Slater type orbitals (STO), instead of GTO orbitals, combined with LO or lo orbitals. This is done using shape functions.

Title: Non-onsite symmetries and quantum teleportation in split-index matrix product states
Authors: David T. Stephen
Abstract: We describe a class of spin chains with new physical and computational properties. On the physical side, the spin chains give examples of symmetry-protected topological phases that are defined by non-onsite symmetries, i.e. symmetries that are not a tensor product of single-site operators. These phases can be detected by string-order parameters, but notably do not exhibit entanglement spectrum degeneracy. On the computational side, the spin chains represent a new class of states that can be used to deterministically teleport information across long distances, with the novel property that the necessary classical side processing is a non-linear function of the measurement outcomes. We also give examples of states that can serve as universal resources for measurement-based quantum computation, providing the first examples of such resources without entanglement spectrum degeneracy. The key tool in our analysis is a new kind of tensor network representation which we call split-index matrix product states (SIMPS). We develop the basic formalism of SIMPS, compare them to matrix product states, show how they are better equipped to describe certain kinds of non-onsite symmetries including anomalous symmetries, and discuss how they are also well-suited to describing quantum teleportation and constrained spin chains.

Title: Dipole-dipole interactions mediated by a photonic flat band
Authors: Enrico Di Benedetto, Alejandro Gonzalez-Tudela, Francesco Ciccarello
Abstract: Flat bands (FBs) are energy bands with zero group velocity, which in electronic systems were shown to favor strongly correlated phenomena. Indeed, a FB can be spanned with a basis of strictly localized states, the so called "compact localized states" (CLSs), which are yet generally non-orthogonal. Here, we study emergent dipole-dipole interactions between emitters dispersively coupled to the photonic analogue of a FB, a setup within reach in state-of the-art experimental platforms. We show that the strength of such photon-mediated interactions decays exponentially with distance with a characteristic localization length which, unlike typical behaviours with standard bands, saturates to a finite value as the emitter's energy approaches the FB. Remarkably, we find that the localization length grows with the overlap between CLSs according to an analytically-derived universal scaling law valid for a large class of FBs both in 1D and 2D. Using giant atoms (non-local atom-field coupling) allows to tailor interaction potentials having the same shape of a CLS or a superposition of a few of these.

Title: Asymmetries of thermal processes in open quantum systems
Authors: Álvaro Tejero, Rafael Sánchez, Laiachi El Kaoutit, Daniel Manzano, Antonio Lasanta
Abstract: An intriguing phenomenon in non-equilibrium quantum thermodynamics is the asymmetry of thermal processes. Relaxation to thermal equilibrium is the most important dissipative process, being a key concept for the design of heat engines and refrigerators, contributing to the study of foundational questions of thermodynamics, and being relevant for quantum computing through the process of algorithmic cooling. Despite their importance, the dynamics of these processes are far from being understood. We show that the free relaxation to thermal equilibrium follows intrinsically different paths depending on whether it involves the temperature of the system to increase or to decrease. Our theory is exemplified using the recently developed thermal kinematics based on information geometry theory, utilizing three prototypical examples: a two-level system, the quantum harmonic oscillator, and a trapped quantum Brownian particle, in all cases showing faster heating than cooling under the appropriate conditions. A general understanding is obtained based on the spectral decomposition of the Liouvillian and the spectral gap of reciprocal processes.

Title: Resonant Excitation of Quasinormal Modes of Black Holes
Authors: Hayato Motohashi
Abstract: We elucidate that a distinctive resonant excitation between quasinormal modes (QNMs) of black holes emerges as a universal phenomenon at an avoided crossing near the exceptional point through high-precision numerical analysis and theory of QNMs based on the framework of non-Hermitian physics. This resonant phenomenon not only allows us to decipher a long-standing mystery concerning the peculiar behaviors of QNMs but also stands as a novel beacon for characterizing black hole spacetime geometry. Our findings pave the way for rigorous examinations of black holes and the exploration of new physics in gravity.

Title: Experimentally probing Landauer's principle in the quantum many-body regime
Authors: Stefan Aimet, Mohammadamin Tajik, Gabrielle Tournaire, Philipp Schüttelkopf, João Sabino, Spyros Sotiriadis, Giacomo Guarnieri, Jörg Schmiedmayer, Jens Eisert
Abstract: Landauer's principle bridges information theory and thermodynamics by linking the entropy change of a system during a process to the average energy dissipated to its environment. Although typically discussed in the context of erasing a single bit of information, Landauer's principle can be generalised to characterise irreversibility in out-of-equilibrium processes, such as those involving complex quantum many-body systems. Specifically, the relationship between the entropy change of the system and the energy dissipated to its environment can be decomposed into changes in quantum mutual information and a difference in relative entropies of the environment. Here we experimentally probe Landauer's principle in the quantum many-body regime using a quantum field simulator of ultracold Bose gases. Employing a dynamical tomographic reconstruction scheme, we track the temporal evolution of the quantum field following a global mass quench from a massive to massless Klein-Gordon model and analyse the thermodynamic and information-theoretic contributions to a generalised entropy production for various system-environment partitions of the composite system. Our results verify the quantum field theoretical calculations, interpreted using a semi-classical quasiparticle picture. Our work demonstrates the ability of ultracold atom-based quantum field simulators to experimentally investigate quantum thermodynamics.

Title: Local quantum channels giving rise to quasi-local Gibbs states
Authors: Itai Arad, Raz Firanko, Omer Gurevich
Abstract: We study the steady-state properties of quantum channels with local Kraus operators. We consider a large family that consists of general ergodic 1-local (non-interacting) terms and general 2-local (interacting) terms. Physically, a repeated application of these channels can be seen as a simple model for the thermalization process of a many-body system. We study its steady state perturbatively, by interpolating between the 1-local and 2-local channels with a perturbation parameter $\epsilon$. We prove that under very general conditions, these states are Gibbs states of a quasi-local Hamiltonian. Expanding this Hamiltonian as a series in $\epsilon$, we show that the $k$'th order term corresponds to a $(k+1)$-local interaction term in the Hamiltonian, which follows the same interaction graph as the Kraus channel. We also prove a complementary result suggesting the existence of an interaction strength threshold, under which the total weight of the high-order terms in the Hamiltonian decays exponentially fast. For sufficiently small $\epsilon$, this implies both exponential decay of local correlation functions and a classical algorithm for computing expectation value of local observables in such steady states. Finally, we present numerical simulations of various channels that support our theoretical results.

Title: Time-Varying Energy Landscapes and Temperature paths: Dynamic Transition Rates in locally Ultrametric Complex Systems
Authors: Ángel Morán Ledezma
Abstract: In this work, we study the dynamics of complex systems with time-dependent transition rates, focusing on $p$-adic analysis in modeling such systems. Starting from the master equation that governs the stochastic dynamics of a system with a large number of interacting components, we generalize it by $p$-adically parametrizing the metabasins to account for states that are organized in a fractal and hierarchical manner within the energy landscape. This leads to a not necessarily time homogeneous Markov process described by a time-dependent operator acting on an ultrametric space. We prove well-posedness of the initial value problem and analyze the stochastic nature of the master equation with time-dependent transition-operator. We demonstrate how ultrametricity simplifies the description of intra-metabasin dynamics without increasing computational complexity. We apply our theoretical framework to two scenarios: glass relaxation under rapid cooling and protein folding dynamics influenced by temperature variations. In the glass relaxation model, we observe anomalous relaxation behavior where the dynamics slow down during cooling, with lasting effects depending on how drastic the temperature drop is. In the protein folding model, we incorporate temperature-dependent transition rates to simulate folding and unfolding processes across the melting temperature. Our results capture a "whiplash" effect: from an unfolded state, the system folds and then returns to an unfolded state (which may differ from the initial one) in response to temperature changes. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of $p$-adic parametrization and ultrametric analysis in modeling complex systems with dynamic transition rate, providing analytical solutions that improve our understanding of relaxation processes in material and biological systems.

Title: Versatile Control of Nonlinear Topological States in Non-Hermitian Systems
Authors: Zhao-Fan Cai, Yu-Chun Wang, Yu-Ran Zhang, Tao Liu, Franco Nori
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) and nonlinearity can both delocalize topological modes (TMs) from the interface. However, the NHSE requires precise parameter tuning, while nonlinearity in Hermitian systems results in partial delocalization with limited mode capacity. To overcome these limitations, we propose a non-Hermitian nonlinear topological interface model that integrates Hermitian and non-Hermitian lattices with nonreciprocal hopping and nonlinearity. This system enables the complete delocalization of TMs across the entire lattice without fine-tuning, while allowing precise control over the wavefunction profile and spatial distribution through the intrinsic configuration and intensity of the nonlinearity. Using the spectral localizer, we demonstrate the topological protection and robustness of these extended non-Hermitian TMs against disorder. Furthermore, we show that under external pumping, localized excitations evolve into predefined profiles and generate long-range patterns, an effect unattainable in Hermitian systems. These findings reveal how the interplay of nonlinearity and NHSE shapes topological states, paving the way for compact topological devices.

Title: Quantum trails and memory effects in the phase space of chaotic quantum systems
Authors: Andrea Pizzi
Abstract: The eigenstates of a chaotic system can be enhanced along underlying unstable periodic orbits in so-called quantum scars, making it more likely for a particle launched along one such orbits to be found still there at long times. Unstable periodic orbits are, however, a negligible part of the phase space, and a question arises regarding the structure of the wave function elsewhere. Here, we address this question and show that a weakly-dispersing dynamics of a localized wave packet in phase space leaves a "quantum trail" on the eigenstates, that is, makes them vary slowly when moving along trajectories in phase space, even if not periodic. The quantum trails underpin a remarkable dynamical effect: for a system initialized in a localized wave packet, the long-time phase-space distribution is enhanced along the short-time trajectory, which can result in ergodicity breaking. We provide the general intuition for these effects and prove them in the stadium billiard, for which an unwarping procedure allows us to visualize the phase space on the two-dimensional space of the page.

Title: Soft cells, Kelvin's foam and the minimal surfaces of Schwarz
Authors: Gábor Domokos, Alain Goriely, Ákos G. Horváth, Krisztina Regős
Abstract: Recently, we introduced a new class of shapes, called soft cells which fill space as soft tilings without gaps and overlaps while minimizing the number of sharp corners. We introduced the edge bending algorithm that deforms a polyhedral tiling into a soft tiling and we proved that an infinite class of polyhedral tilings can be smoothly deformed into standard soft tilings. Here, we demonstrate that certain triply periodic minimal surfaces naturally give rise to non-standard soft tilings. By extending the edge-bending algorithm, we further establish that the soft tilings derived from the Schwarz P and Schwarz D surfaces can be continuously transformed into one another through a one-parameter family of intermediate non-standard soft tilings. Notably, by carrying its combinatorial structure, both resulting tilings belong to the first order equivalence class of the Dirichlet-Voronoi tiling on the body-centered cubic bcc lattice, highlighting a deep geometric connection underlying these minimal surface configurations. By requiring identical end-tangents for edges in a first order class, we also define second order equivalence classes among tilings and prove that there exist exactly two such classes among soft tilings which share the full symmetry group of the DV-bcc tiling. Additionally, we construct a one-parameter family of tilings bridging standard and non-standard soft tilings, explicitly including the classic Kelvin foam structure as an intermediate configuration. This construction highlights that both the soft cells themselves and the geometric methods employed in their generation provide valuable insights into the structural principles underlying natural forms. We also present the soft tiling induced by the gyroid structure.

Title: Transport coefficients of dense nucleon matter at low temperature
Authors: Jianing Li, Weiyao Ke
Abstract: The transport property of cold and dense nucleon matter is important for nuclear physics but is relatively less studied than that at finite temperatures. In this paper, we present a primary study of bulk and shear viscosities in the limit $T/\mu_B \ll 1$, where $T$ and $\mu_B$ are the temperature and the baryon chemical potential. The analysis is performed for a generic system where nucleons are dressed by the condensation of both scalar and vector interactions. Under the relaxation time approximation of the Boltzmann equation, we compute the viscosities of the system to leading power in $T/\mu_B$ expansion and establish a relation between the thermodynamic potential and transport coefficients, including bulk viscosity ($\zeta$) and shear viscosity ($\eta$). It is found that hydrodynamic stability ($\zeta>0$) imposes additional constraints on the thermodynamic potential. As an example, these relations are applied to the Walecka model. The fluid properties of the cold and dense nucleon matter are characterized by the dimensionless combination of viscosities times the quasi-Fermi momentum over the enthalpy. Furthermore, we discuss the implication of the stability condition on the range of applicability of the model.

Title: Nonlinear optomechanical systems with quasi-periodic and chaotic dynamics
Authors: A.P. Saiko, G.A. Rusetsky, S.A. Markevich, R. Fedaruk
Abstract: Model optomechanical systems with photon-vibration interactions linear, quadratic, and cubic in mechanical displacements are studied under conditions for adiabatic elimination of the photon field. The opportunity of transformation of effective potential describing the dynamics of the mechanical resonator from single-well to double-well is demonstrated. The dynamics of the mechanical resonator is considered in the presence of (i) only linear interaction, (ii) only quadratic interaction, (iii) both linear and quadratic interactions, and (iv) all three interactions, while other parameters of the optomechanical system, the modulation optical field, and the initial conditions remain fixed. Quasiperiodic oscillations of the mechanical resonator in the case (i) are replaced by chaotic ones when the cases (ii) or (iii) are realized. It is interesting that in the presence of all three interactions, the chaotic behavior of the mechanical oscillator becomes quasi-periodic. However, increasing the power of the modulation field again leads to chaos.

Title: Noise-resilient solid host for electron qubits above 100 mK
Authors: Xinhao Li, Christopher S. Wang, Brennan Dizdar, Yizhong Huang, Yutian Wen, Wei Guo, Xufeng Zhang, Xu Han, Xianjing Zhou, Dafei Jin
Abstract: Cryogenic solid neon has recently emerged as a pristine solid host for single electron qubits. At ~10 mK temperatures, electron-on-solid-neon (eNe) charge qubits have exhibited exceptionally long coherence times and high operation fidelities. To advance this platform towards a scalable quantum information architecture, systematic characterization of its noise feature is imperative. Here, we show the remarkable resilience of solid neon against charge and thermal noises when eNe qubits are operated away from the charge-insensitive sweet-spot and at elevated temperatures. Without optimizing neon growth, the measured charge (voltage) noise on solid neon is already orders of magnitude lower than that in most stringently grown semiconductors, rivaling the best records to date. Up to 400 mK, the eNe charge qubits operated at ~5 GHz can maintain their echo coherence times over 1 microsecond. These observations highlight solid neon as an ideal host for quantum information processing at higher temperatures and larger scales.

Title: Oddities in the Entanglement Scaling of the Quantum Six-Vertex Model
Authors: Sunny Pradhan, Jesús Cobos, Enrique Rico, Germán Sierra
Abstract: We investigate the entanglement properties of the Quantum Six-Vertex Model on a cylinder, focusing on the Shannon-Renyi entropy in the limit of Renyi order $n = \infty$. This entropy, calculated from the ground state amplitudes of the equivalent XXZ spin-1/2 chain, allows us to determine the Renyi entanglement entropy of the corresponding Rokhsar-Kivelson wavefunctions, which describe the ground states of certain conformal quantum critical points. Our analysis reveals a novel logarithmic correction to the expected entanglement scaling when the system size is odd. This anomaly arises from the geometric frustration of spin configurations imposed by periodic boundary conditions on odd-sized chains. We demonstrate that the scaling prefactor of this logarithmic term is directly related to the compactification radius of the low-energy bosonic field theory description, or equivalently, the Luttinger parameter. Thus, this correction provides a direct probe of the underlying Conformal Field Theory (CFT) describing the critical point. Our findings highlight the crucial role of system size parity in determining the entanglement properties of this model and offer insights into the interplay between geometry, frustration, and criticality.

Title: The Large-Scale Structure of Entanglement in Quantum Many-body Systems
Authors: Lauritz van Luijk, Alexander Stottmeister, Henrik Wilming
Abstract: We show that the thermodynamic limit of a many-body system can reveal entanglement properties that are hard to detect in finite-size systems -- similar to how phase transitions only sharply emerge in the thermodynamic limit. The resulting operational entanglement properties are in one-to-one correspondence with abstract properties of the local observable algebras that emerge in the thermodynamic limit. These properties are insensitive to finite perturbations and hence describe the $\textit{large-scale structure of entanglement}$ of many-body systems. We formulate and discuss the emerging structures and open questions, both for gapped and gapless many-body systems. In particular, we show that every gapped phase of matter, even the trivial one, in $D\geq 2$ dimensions contains models with the strongest possible bipartite large-scale entanglement. Conversely, we conjecture the existence of topological phases of matter, where all representatives have the strongest form of entanglement.

Title: Universality of Rényi Entropy in Conformal Field Theory
Authors: Yuya Kusuki, Hirosi Ooguri, Sridip Pal
Abstract: We use the thermal effective theory to prove that, for the vacuum state in any conformal field theory in $d$ dimensions, the $n$-th Rényi entropy $S_A^{(n)}$ behaves as $S_A^{(n)} = \frac{f}{(2\pi n)^{d-1}} \frac{ {\rm Area}(\partial A)}{(d-2)\epsilon^{d-2}}\left(1+O(n)\right)$ in the $n \rightarrow 0$ limit when the boundary of the entanglement domain $A$ is spherical with the UV cutoff $\epsilon$.The theory dependence is encapsulated in the cosmological constant $f$ in the thermal effective action. Using this result, we estimate the density of states for large eigenvalues of the modular Hamiltonian for the domain $A$. In two dimensions, we can use the hot spot idea to derive more powerful formulas valid for arbitrary positive $n$. We discuss the difference between two and higher dimensions and clarify the applicability of the hot spot idea. We also use the thermal effective theory to derive an analog of the Cardy formula for boundary operators in higher dimensions.
