Title: Bootstrapping the Electronic Structure of Quantum Materials
Authors: Anna O. Schouten, Simon Ewing, David A. Mazziotti
Abstract: The last several decades have seen significant advances in the theoretical modeling of materials within the fields of solid-state physics and materials science, but many methods commonly applied to this problem struggle to capture strong electron correlation accurately. Recent widespread interest in quantum materials -- where strong correlation plays a crucial role in the quantum effects governing their behavior -- further highlights the need for theoretical methods capable of rigorously treating such correlation. Here, we present a periodic generalization of variational two-electron reduced density matrix (2-RDM) theory, a bootstrapping-type method that minimizes the ground-state energy as a functional of the 2-RDM without relying on the wavefunction. The 2-RDM is computed directly by semidefinite programming with $N$-representability conditions, ensuring accurate treatment of strongly correlated electronic systems. By exploiting translational symmetry, we significantly reduce computational scaling, enabling applications to realistic materials-scale systems. Additionally, we introduce an alternative to conventional energy band structures: natural-orbital occupation-number bands, which, being independent of mean-field assumptions, offer deeper insights into electron correlation effects. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by applying the theory to hydrogen chains, molybdenum disulfide, and nickel oxide, showing that natural-orbital occupation bands correctly capture electronic character in regimes where density functional theory fails. This work represents a major step toward accurately describing the electronic structure of quantum materials using reduced density matrices rather than wavefunctions.

Title: Excitonic and magnetic phases in doped WTe$_2$ monolayers: a Hartree-Fock approach
Authors: Guillermo Parra-Martínez, Daniel Muñoz-Segovia, Héctor Ochoa, Jose Angel Silva-Guillén
Abstract: Transport and local spectroscopy measurements have revealed that monolayers of tungsten ditelluride ($1T'$-WTe$_2$) display a quantum spin Hall effect and an excitonic gap at neutrality, besides becoming superconducting at low electron concentrations. With the aim of studying the competition among different broken-symmetry phases upon electron doping, we have performed extensive Hartree-Fock calculations as a function of electron density and Coulomb interaction strength. At charge neutrality, we reproduce the emergence of a spin density wave and a spin spiral state surrounding a quantum spin Hall insulator at intermediate interaction strengths. For stronger interactions, the spin spiral is disrupted by a state breaking both inversion and time-reversal symmetries (but not their product) before the system becomes a trivial band insulator. With electron doping the quantum spin Hall insulator evolves into an easy-plane ferromagnet due to a Stoner-like instability of the conduction band. This phase competes energetically with the spin spiral state. We discuss how our results may help to interpret past and future measurements.

Title: Perfect supercurrent diode efficiency in chiral nanotube-based Josephson junctions
Authors: Joseph J. Cuozzo, François Léonard
Abstract: The supercurrent diode effect (SDE) describes superconducting systems where the magnitude of the superconducting-to-normal state switching current differs for positive and negative current bias. Despite the ubiquity of such diode effects in Josephson devices, the fundamental conditions to observe a diode effect in a Josephson junction and achieve perfect diode efficiency remain unclear. In this work, we analyze the supercurrent diode properties of a chiral nanotube-based Josephson junction within a Ginzburg-Landau theory. We find a diode effect and anomalous phase develops across the junction when a magnetic field is applied parallel to the tube despite the absence of spin-orbit interactions in the system. Unexpectedly, the SDE in the junction is independent of the anomalous phase. Alternatively, we determine a non-reciprocal persistent current that is protected by fluxoid quantization can activate SDE, even in the absence of higher-order pair tunneling processes. We show this new type of SDE can lead to, in principle, a perfect diode efficiency, highlighting how persistent currents can be used to engineer high efficiency supercurrent diodes.

Title: Quantum shockwave at the quasi-relativistic resonance
Authors: Marinko Jablan
Abstract: We analyze the electromagnetic field travelling on resonance with the limiting velocity of the quasi-relativistic particle. We show that a strong longitudinal field leads to the quantum wave function singularity in the form of a shockwave, accompanied by strong energy dissipation. We show that the effect is particularly strong in the case of Dirac electrons in graphene due to the small effective mass. We discuss several experimental tests of these predictions.

Title: Composite Bosons Superposition Ansatz Approach to One-Dimensional Trapped Few-Fermion Systems
Authors: Francisco Figueiredo, Itzhak Roditi
Abstract: Ultra-cold atomic systems provide a versatile platform for exploring quantum phenomena, offering tunable interactions and diverse trapping geometries. In this study, we investigate a one-dimensional system of trapped fermionic atoms using the composite boson formalism, which describes pairs of opposite-spin fermions as cobosons (short for composite bosons). By constructing a superposition ansatz of coboson states, we solve the Schrödinger equation for two fermion pairs under both attractive and repulsive interactions. We determine key observables such as particle density profiles and two-body correlations. Additionally, we compute the low-lying energy spectrum and estimate the pairing gap. Our results highlight the potential of the coboson formalism for exploring quantum phenomena in strongly correlated few-body systems, achieving results comparable to standard exact diagonalization techniques.

Title: Noise-Affected Dynamical Quantum Phase Transitions
Authors: R. Jafari, Alireza Akbari, Mehdi Biderang, Jesko Sirker
Abstract: We investigate the effects of uncorrelated noise on dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) following a quantum ramp across critical points in two different scenarios. First, we show that for a slow ramp in the XY model caused by a stochastically driven field an intriguing and counterintuitive phenomenon arises where the Loschmidt amplitude vanishes in an entire critical region in time. At the boundaries of such a region, DQPTs in the return rate with diverging slopes appear in contrast to the regular DQPTs with finite slopes for a ramp without noise. We also show that the critical ramp velocity beyond which DQPTs disappear entirely, as well as the critical ramp velocity separating the regime with critical regions in time from the regime with standard DQPTs, are both described by universal scaling functions. Second, we study the impact of the environment on DQPTs based on the Kubo-Anderson spectral diffusion process, where the environmental effects on the system are simulated as stochastic fluctuations in the energy levels of the post-ramp Hamiltonian. In this framework, the noise master equation can be solved analytically both for uncorrelated and correlated noise. The obtained analytical expression for the return rate reveals that DQPTs in this case are always completely eliminated.

Title: Selective colloid transport across planar polymer brushes

Borisov (1,2,5) ((1) <a href="http://St.Petersburg" rel="external noopener nofollow" class="link-external link-http">this http URL</a> National Research University of Information Technologies Mechanics and Optics, (2) Institute of Macromolecular Compounds Russian Academy of Sciences, (3) Department of Physics American University of Beirut, (4) School of Biomedical Sciences University of Leeds, (5) CNRS Université de Pau et des Pays de l'Adour UMR 5254 Institut des Sciences Analytiques et de Physico-Chimie pour l'Environnement et les Matériaux)
Abstract: Polymer brushes are attractive as surface coatings for a wide range of applications, from fundamental research to everyday life, and also play important roles in biological systems. How colloids (e.g., functional nanoparticles, proteins, viruses) bind and move across polymer brushes is an important yet under-studied problem. We present a mean-field theoretical approach to analyze the binding and transport of colloids in planar polymer brushes. The theory explicitly considers the effect of solvent strength on brush conformation and of colloid-polymer affinity on colloid binding and transport. We derive the position-dependent free energy of the colloid insertion into the polymer brush which controls the rate of colloid transport across the brush. We show how the properties of the brush can be adjusted for brushes to be highly selective, effectively serving as tuneable gates with respect to colloid size and affinity to the brush-forming polymer. The most important parameter regime simultaneously allowing for high brush permeability and selectivity corresponds to a condition when the repulsive and attractive contributions to the colloid insertion free energy nearly cancel. Our theory should be useful to design sensing and purification devices with enhanced selectivity and to better understand mechanisms underpinning the functions of biopolymer brushes.

Title: Theory of polyelectrolyte dendrigrafts
Authors: Oleg V. Borisov (1), Oleg V. Shavykin (1,2), Ekaterina B. Zhulina (2) ((1) CNRS Institut des Sciences Analytiques et de Physico-Chimie pour l'Environnement et les Matériaux Université de Pau et des Pays de l'Adour, (2) Institute of Macromolecular Compounds of the Russian Academy of Sciences)
Abstract: A mean-field approach is used to analyze equilibrium conformations of polyelectrolyte dendrigrafts comprising ionically charged dendrons attached by focal points to a flexible linear backbone. Power law dependences for local structural parameters, cross-sectional thickness and intergraft distance, are derived as a function of grafting density and degree of branching of the dendrons. The cases of quenched and pH-sensitive ionization of the dendrons are considered. The finite extensibility of the backbone is taken into account. It is demonstrated that an increase in the degree of branching of the dendrons leads to a decrease in the dendrigraft thickness compared with that of the polyelectrolyte molecular brush with the same degree of polymerization of the side chains, while intergraft distance either increases or stays close to counter length of fully extended backbone spacer. The analytical mean-field theory predictions are confirmed by results of numerical self-consistent field modelling.

Title: Micelle Formation of Diblock Copolymers Driven by Cononsolvency Effect
Authors: Xiangyu Zhang, Jing Zong, Dong Meng
Abstract: This study utilizes self-consistent field theory to characterize various features of cononsolvency-driven spherical micelles formed by double hydrophilic block copolymers (DHBCs). Micelles are observed only at an intermediate cosolvent fraction, forming abruptly at a specific solvent/cosolvent mixing ratio and gradually disappearing with further cosolvent addition. A stronger core-block - cosolvent attractive interaction leads to a lower critical micelle concentration and a higher aggregation number. The density profile of cononsolvency-driven micelles is compared with that of conventional micelles, which form due to core-block - solvent repulsive interactions. In conventional micelles, the core is primarily occupied by polymer segments, whereas in cononsolvency-driven micelles, the core consists mainly of solvents and cosolvents. This fundamental difference can be explained through thermodynamic analysis. Conventional micelle formation is driven by the reduction of core-block - solvent contact due to repulsive interactions. In contrast, cononsolvency-driven micelle formation is governed by an increase in core-block - cosolvent contact area, playing the major role to minimize the total free energy-an essential distinction from conventional micelles.

Title: Formation of multiple quantum dots in ZnO heterostructures
Authors: Koichi Baba, Kosuke Noro, Yusuke Kozuka, Takeshi Kumasaka, Motoya Shinozaki, Masashi Kawasaki, Tomohiro Otsuka
Abstract: In recent years, advancements in semiconductor manufacturing technology have enabled the formation of high-quality, high-mobility two-dimensional electron gases in zinc oxide (ZnO) heterostructures, making the electrostatic formation of quantum dots possible. ZnO, with its low natural abundance of isotopes possessing nuclear spin and its direct bandgap, is considered a potentially suitable material for quantum bit applications. In this study, we achieve the formation of triple quantum dots and the realization of a few-electron state in ZnO heterostructure devices. We also confirm that by varying the gate voltage between the quantum dots, it is possible to control the interdot spacing. Additionally, we observe a tunneling phenomenon called a quantum cellular automata effect, where multiple electrons move simultaneously, which is not seen in single or double quantum dots, due to Coulomb interactions. Our results demonstrate that ZnO nanostructures have reached a level where they can function as controllable multiple quantum dot systems.

Title: Thermodynamic Properties and Magnetocaloric Effect in a Rotating 2DEG under the Sagnac Effect
Authors: Cleverson Filgueiras, Moises Rojas, Vinicius T. Pieve, Edilberto O. Silva
Abstract: This work investigates the impact of the Sagnac effect on the thermodynamic properties of a non-interacting two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in a rotating sample under the influence of a uniform magnetic field. We analyze how rotation and the distinction between effective mass ($m^*$) and gravitational mass ($m_G$) affect the energy levels and resulting thermodynamic properties. The results show that rotation modifies the energy levels, the application of a magnetic field leads to the formation of Landau levels further altered by rotation and gravitational mass, and thermodynamic quantities (internal energy, specific heat, free energy, entropy, magnetization, and magnetocaloric effect) exhibit a strong dependence on these parameters. In particular, the difference between $m^*$ and $m_G$ influences magnetization and the magnetocaloric effect, with negative rotations potentially inducing a cooling effect when these masses are distinct. We conclude that rotational effects and effective mass properties are crucial for understanding the thermodynamics of electronic systems under magnetic fields, with implications for thermal modulation in semiconductor materials.

Title: Typical reconstruction limit and phase transition of maximum entropy method
Authors: Masaru Hitomi, Masayuki Ohzeki
Abstract: We investigate the dependence of the maximum entropy method (MEM) reconstruction performance on the default model. The maximum entropy method is a reconstruction technique that utilizes prior information, referred to as the default model, to recover original signals from observed data, and it is widely used in underdetermined systems. The broad applications have been reported in fields ranging from the analysis of observational data in seismology and astronomy, to large-scale computations in quantum chemistry, and even in social sciences such as linguistics. However, a known drawback of MEM is that its results depend on the assumed default model. In this study, we employ the replica method to elucidate how discrepancies in the default model affect the reconstruction of signals with specific distributions. We report that in certain cases, even small discrepancies can induce phase transitions, leading to reconstruction failure. Additionally, by comparing MEM with reconstruction based on L1-norm optimization, a method proposed in recent years, we demonstrate that MEM exhibits lower reconstruction accuracy under certain conditions.

Title: Metastable short-range charge order in superconducting CuxTiSe2
Authors: Thomas Sutter, Colleen Lindenau, Shivani Sharma, Andrei Fluerasu, Lutz Wiegart, Goran Karapetrov, Anshul Kogar, Xiaoqian M Chen
Abstract: In a vast array of materials, including cuprates, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and rare earth tritellurides, superconductivity is found in the vicinity of short-range charge density wave (CDW) order. The crossover from long-range to short-range charge order often occurs as quenched disorder is introduced, yet it is unclear how this disorder disrupts the CDW. Here, using x-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS), we investigate the prototypical TMD superconductor CuxTiSe2 and show that disorder induces substantial CDW dynamics. We observed the CDW phase fluctuation on a timescale of minutes to hours above the nominal transition temperature while the order parameter amplitude remains finite. These long timescale fluctuations prevent the system from finding the global free energy minimum upon cooling and ultimately traps it in a short-range ordered metastable state. Our findings demonstrate how correlated disorder can give rise to a distinct mechanism of domain formation that may be advantageous to the emergence of superconductivity.

Title: Magnetic-field-tuned randomness in inhomogeneous altermagnets
Authors: Anzumaan R. Chakraborty, Jörg Schmalian, Rafael M. Fernandes
Abstract: Altermagnetic (AM) states have compensated collinear magnetic configurations that are invariant under a combination of real-space rotation and time reversal. While these symmetries forbid a direct bilinear coupling of the AM order parameter with a magnetic field, they generally enable piezomagnetism, manifested as a trilinear coupling with magnetic field and strain. Here, we show that, because of this coupling, in an altermagnet subjected to random strain, the magnetic field triggers an effective random field conjugate to the AM order parameter, providing a rare realization of a tunable random-field Ising model. Specifically, we find two competing effects promoted by an external magnetic field: an increasing random-field disorder, which suppresses long-range AM order, and an enhanced coupling to elastic fluctuations, which favors AM order. By solving the corresponding random-field transverse-field Ising model via a mean-field approach, we obtain the temperature-magnetic field phase diagram of an inhomogeneous AM state for different strengths of random-strain disorder, unveiling the emergence of a field-induced reentrant AM phase. We also discuss the fingerprints of this rich behavior on several experimentally-accessible quantities, such as the shear modulus, the elasto-caloric effect coefficient, and the AM order parameter. Our results reveal an unusual but experimentally-feasible path to tune AM order with uniform magnetic fields.

Title: Optical detection of charge defects near a graphene transistor using the Stark shift of fluorescent molecules
Authors: Carlotta Ciancico, Iacopo Torre, Bernat Terrés, Alvaro Moreno, Robert Smit, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Michel Orrit, Frank Koppens, Antoine Reserbat-Plantey
Abstract: Two-dimensional crystals and their heterostructures unlock access to a class of photonic devices, bringing nanophotonics from the nanometer scale down to the atomic level where quantum effects are relevant. Single-photon emitters (SPEs) are central in quantum photonics as quantum markers linked to their electrostatic, thermal, magnetic, or dielectric environment. This aspect is exciting in two-dimensional (2D) crystals and their heterostructures, where the environment can be abruptly modified through vertical stacking or lateral structuring, such as moiré or nano-patterned gates. To further develop 2D-based quantum photonic devices, there is a need for quantum markers that are capable of integration into various device geometries, and that can be read out individually, non-destructively, and without additional electrodes. Here, we show how to optically detect charge carrier accumulation using sub-GHz linewidth single-photon emitters coupled to a graphene device. We employ the single molecule Stark effect, sensitive to the electric fields generated by charge puddles, such as those at the graphene edge. The same approach enables dynamic sensing of electronic noise, and we demonstrate the optical read-out of low-frequency white noise in a biased graphene device. The approach described here can be further exploited to explore charge dynamics in 2D heterostructures using quantum emitter markers.

Title: Successive Antiferromagnetic Transition in the Frustrated Compound CeMgIn
Authors: Kou Onishi, Hitoshi Sugawara, Takahiro Sakurai, Hitoshi Ohta, Eiichi Matsuoka
Abstract: We report on the magnetic, transport, and thermal properties of the hexagonal ZrNiAl-type compound CeMgIn with Ce atoms forming a distorted kagome network. This compound exhibits successive antiferromagnetic transition at $T_\text{N1} =$ 2.1 K, $T_\text{N2} =$ 1.7 K, and possibly $T_\text{N3} =$ 1.3 K. The electrical resistivity exhibits a minimum at 11 K and a nonlogarithmic increase with decreasing temperature down to $T_\text{N2}$. We found that CeMgIn is the first ZrNiAl-type compound whose resistivity increase can be well explained by considering a model in which the electron-spin scattering is enhanced by the magnetic frustration and the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interaction. These results suggest that CeMgIn is a notable compound whose physical properties are strongly affected by geometrical frustration. Since the Sommerfeld coefficient is 97 mJ/mol K$^2$, CeMgIn is classified as a moderate heavy-fermion compound.

Title: The strain-stiffening critical exponents in polymer networks and their universality
Authors: Zibin Zhang, Eran Bouchbinder, Edan Lerner
Abstract: Disordered athermal biopolymer materials, such as collagen networks that constitute a major component in extracellular matrices and various connective tissues, are initially soft and compliant but stiffen dramatically under strain. Such network materials are topologically sub-isostatic and feature strong rigidity scale separation between the bending and stretching response of the constituent polymer fibers. Recently, a comprehensive scaling theory of the athermal strain-stiffening phase transition has been developed, providing predictions for all critical exponents characterising the transition in terms of the distance to the critical strain and of the small rigidity scales ratio. Here, we employ large-scale computer simulations, at and away from criticality, to test the analytic predictions. We find that all numerical critical exponents are in quantitative agreement with the analytically-predicted ones. Moreover, we find that all predicted exponents remain valid whether the driving strain is shear, i.e., volume-preserving, or dilation, and independent of the degree of the network's sub-isostaticity, thus establishing the universality of the strain-stiffening phase transition with respect to the symmetry of the driving strain and the network's topology.

Title: Transfer of active motion from medium to probe via the induced friction and noise
Authors: Ji-Hui Pei, Christian Maes
Abstract: Can activity be transmitted from smaller to larger scales? We report on such a transfer from a homogeneous active medium to a Newtonian spherical probe. The active medium consists of faster and dilute self-propelled particles, modeled as run-and-tumble particles in 1D or as active Brownian particles in 2D. We derive the reduced fluctuating dynamics of the probe valid for arbitrary probe velocity, characterized by a nonlinear friction and a velocity-dependent noise. There appear several distinct regimes: a standard regime where the probe exhibits passive Brownian motion, and peculiar active regimes where the probe becomes self-propelled with high persistence, and its velocity distribution begets peaks at nonzero values. The resulting propulsion speeds and their persistence are quantitatively obtained and are confirmed by numerical simulations of the joint probe-medium system. The emergence of active regimes depends not only on the far-from-equilibrium nature of the medium but also on the probe-medium coupling. In 1D, a soft coupling is necessary, whereas in 2D, more realistic interactions, such as Lennard-Jones, suffice. Our findings thus reveal how, solely via the induced friction and noise, persistence can cross different scales to transfer active motion.

Title: Topological sorting of magnetic colloidal bipeds
Authors: Aneena Rinu Perayil, Piotr Kuświk, Maciej Urbaniak, Feliks Stobiecki, Sapida Akhundzada, Arno Ehresmann, Daniel de las Heras, Thomas M. Fischer
Abstract: Topologically nontrivial adiabatic loops of the orientation of a homogeneous external magnetic field drive the walking of paramagnetic colloidal bipeds above a deformed quasi-periodic magnetic square pattern. Depending on the topological properties of the loop we can simultaneously control the walking directions of colloidal bipeds as a function of their size and as a function of the size of a deformed unit cell of the pattern. The bipeds walk performing steps with their two feet alternatingly grounding one foot and lifting the other. The step width of the bipeds is given by a set of winding numbers $(w_x,w_{y})\in Z^2$ -- a set of topological invariants -- that can only change by integers as we continuously increase the length of the bipeds. We experimentally use this discrete size dependence for the robust sorting of bipeds according to their length.

Title: Spin-to-orbital angular momentum conversion in non-Hermitian photonic graphene
Authors: Zhaoyang Zhang, Pavel Kokhanchik, Zhenzhi Liu, Yutong Shen, Fu Liu, Maochang Liu, Yanpeng Zhang, Min Xiao, Guillaume Malpuech, Dmitry Solnyshkov
Abstract: Optical beams with orbital angular momentum (OAM) have numerous potential applications, but the means used for their generation often lack crucial on-demand control. In this work, we present a mechanism of converting spin angular momentum (SAM) to OAM in a non-structured beam. The conversion occurs through spin-orbit coupling in a reconfigurable photonic honeycomb lattice with staggering implemented by electromagnetically-induced transparency in an atomic vapor cell. The spin-orbit coupling allows to outcouple the OAM signal from a particular band in a given valley determined by the chirality of light or the lattice staggering, providing a non-zero Berry curvature for generating OAM. The dependence of the output OAM on the chirality of the input beam is the first control knob. The staggering works as a second control knob, flipping the sign of OAM for the fixed chirality. The demonstrated conversion between SAM and OAM is important for optical communications. Our results can be extended to other implementations of paraxial photonic graphene.

Title: Spin-orbit interactions, time-reversal symmetry, and spin selection
Authors: Amnon Aharony, Ora Entin-Wohlman
Abstract: Spin selective transport is usually associated with spin-orbit interactions. However, these interactions are invariant under time-reversal symmetry, and the Onsager relations and Bardarson's theorem imply that such interactions cannot yield spin selectivity for transport through a junction between two electronic reservoirs. Here, we review several ways to overcome this restriction, using a Zeeman magnetic field, the Aharonov-Bohm phase, time-dependent electric fields that generate time-dependent spin-orbit interactions, time-dependent transients, more than two terminals, leakage, and more than one level per ion on the junction. Our considerations focus on the transport of noninteracting electrons at low temperatures. A possible connection with the phenomenon of chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS) is pointed out in one of the systems considered.

Title: Evaluation of strain and charge-transfer doping in wet-polymeric transferred monolayer MoS2: implications for field effect transistors
Authors: C. Abinash Bhuyan, Kishore K. Madapu, K. Prabhakar, Jagnaseni Pradhan, Arup Dasgupta, S R Polaki, Sandip Dhara
Abstract: Two-dimensional materials offer exceptional tunability of electronic and optical properties via strain and doping engineering. However, the unintentional introduction of polymeric residues during wet chemical 2D film transfer processes such as wet chemical etching and surface energy assisted methods remains critical, yet unexplored. This study systematically investigates the impact of such residues on the optical and electrical properties of monolayer MoS\textsubscript{2} using Raman and photoluminescence spectroscopy. We reveal that polymer residues in transferred films from wet chemical etching induce distinct strain and doping behaviors: PMMA-existed regions exhibit biaxial tensile strain and \textit{p}-type doping, while PMMA-free regions show compressive strain. In contrast, the surface energy assisted transfer method introduces compressive strain and \textit{n}-type doping in the transferred film due to residue interactions. Field-effect transistor measurements corroborate these findings, showing polymer residue-influenced modulation of charge transport. Notably, the surface energy assisted technique minimizes transfer-induced defects, highlighting its superiority for fabricating high-performance 2D optoelectronic devices. These results underscore the critical role of transfer methodologies in tailoring optoelectronic properties and provide practical insights for optimizing 2D material integration in advanced technologies.

Title: Topological defects in polar active matter
Authors: Luiza Angheluta, Anna Lång, Emma Lång, Stig Ove Bøe
Abstract: Polar active matter - including animal herds, aggregates of motile cells and active colloids - often forms coordinated migration patterns, such as flocking. This orderly motion can be disrupted by full-integer topological defects representing localized disturbances where polar alignment is lost. Such polar defects can serve as key organizing centers across scales, sustaining collective behavior, such as swirling motion and other large-scale coherent states. While significant progress in understanding active matter principles have been made in recent years, a quantitative understanding of how topological defects influence active polar matter is needed. We present a brief overview of recent experimental observations in synthetic active colloids and various biological systems. We describe how polar defects mediate dynamical transitions and contribute to the spontaneous emergence of large-scale coherent states. We also discuss theoretical advancements in physical modeling of coupled processes involving polar defects and collective behavior in active polar matter.

Title: Chemo-mechanical motility modes of partially wetting liquid droplets
Authors: Florian Voss, Uwe Thiele
Abstract: We consider a simple thermodynamically consistent model that captures the interplay between autocatalytically reacting surfactants, the Marangoni effect and wetting dynamics. An ambient bath of surfactant acts as a chemostat and provides the system with chemical fuel, thereby driving it away from thermodynamic equilibrium. We find that a positive feedback loop between the local reactions and the Marangoni effect induces surface tension gradients that allow for self-propelled droplets. Besides simple directional motion, we find crawling and shuttling droplets as well as droplets performing random walks, thus exploring the entire substrate. We study the occurring dynamics and show how the observed states emerge from local and global bifurcations. Due to the underlying generic thermodynamic structure, we expect that our results are relevant not only to directly related biomimetic droplet systems but also to structurally similar systems like chemically active phase separating mixtures.

Title: Maximal critical temperature dependence on number of layers due to phonon d-wave pairing in hole doped cuprates
Authors: Baruch Rosenstein, B. Ya. Shapiro, Guy Leshem
Abstract: Recently an apical oxygen atoms vibrations exchange mechanism of d-wave pairing in cuprates was proposed. The phonon mode in an insulating layer generates attraction of holes in metallic cuper oxygen planes. The pairing has a maximum at the crystallographic gamma point leading to d-wave channel. The idea is generalized here to include the in-plane breathers and half - breather modes in a multi-layer cuprate generating the pairing in an adjacent cuper oxygen layer of the same multi-layer. It is demonstrated that the phonon exchange and the spin fluctuation pairing constructively enhance each other since the paramagnon pairing peaks at crystallographic M point. The phonon contribution explains the maximal critical temperature dependence on the number of layers N. It rises equidistantly by 15K from N=1 to N=3 and then saturates. The strength of the onsite Coulomb on site repulsion at optimal doping is to obtain the observed values of maximal critical temperature in the intermediate range of the effective on-site repulsion U=(1.5-2) eV, smaller than commonly used in purely in-plane (spin fluctuation) theory of high temperature superconductivity.

Title: Multicolor phonon excitation in terahertz cavities
Authors: Omer Yaniv, Dominik M. Juraschek
Abstract: Driving materials using light with more than one frequency component is an emerging technique, enabled by advanced pulse-shaping capabilities in recent years. Here, we translate this technique to lattice vibrations, by exciting multicolor phonons using terahertz cavities. In contrast to light, phonon frequencies are determined by the crystal structure and cannot readily be changed. We overcome this problem by tuning the frequencies of phonon polaritons in terahertz cavities to achieve the desired frequency ratios necessary for phononic Lissajous figures. This methodology enables dynamical crystallographic symmetry breaking and the creation of staggered phonon angular momentum and magnetic moment patterns.

Title: Exotic Doublon-Holon Pairing State in Photodoped Mott Insulators
Authors: Ryota Ueda, Madhumita Sarkar, Zala Lenarčič, Denis Golež, Kazuhiko Kuroki, Tatsuya Kaneko
Abstract: We demonstrate the existence of a unique pairing state in photodoped Mott insulators on ladder geometries, characterized by quasi-long-ranged doublon-holon correlations, using the density matrix renormalization group method. This phase exhibits doublon-holon pairing correlations with opposite signs along the rung and chain directions, reminiscent of d-wave pairing in chemically doped ladder systems. By constructing the phase diagram, we reveal that the doublon-holon pairing state emerges between the spin-singlet phase and the charge-density-wave/$\eta$-pairing phase. Our study suggests that the interplay of charge, spin, and $\eta$-spin degrees of freedom can give rise to exotic quantum many-body states in photodoped Mott insulators.

Title: Chiral phonons in polar LiNbO3
Authors: Hiroki Ueda, Abhishek Nag, Carl P. Romao, Mirian García-Fernández, Ke-Jin Zhou, Urs Staub
Abstract: Quasiparticles describe collective excitations in many-body systems, and their symmetry classification is of fundamental importance because they govern physical processes on various timescales, e.g., excited states, transport phenomena, and phase transitions. Recent studies have revealed that quasiparticles can possess chirality and that this degree of freedom leads to various important phenomena. Among them, chiral phonons have recently attracted significant interest because of their intrinsic magnetism, which non-trivially bridges the spin system and the lattice. Here, we directly prove the presence of chiral phonons in a prototypical polar crystal LiNbO3. Our demonstration adds a polar crystal in the showcase of materials hosting chiral phonons and, furthermore, creates a substantial potential in chiral phononics because of its expected in-situ switchable phonon chirality and associated control of phonon angular momentum.

Title: A silicon spin vacuum: isotopically enriched $^{28}$silicon-on-insulator and $^{28}$silicon from ultra-high fluence ion implantation
Authors: Shao Qi Lim, Brett C. Johnson, Sergey Rubanov, Nico Klingner, Bin Gong, Alexander M. Jakob, Danielle Holmes, David N. Jamieson, Jim S. Williams, Jeffrey C. McCallum
Abstract: Isotopically enriched silicon (Si) can greatly enhance qubit coherence times by minimizing naturally occurring $^{29}$Si which has a non-zero nuclear spin. Ultra-high fluence $^{28}$Si ion implantation of bulk natural Si substrates was recently demonstrated as an attractive technique to ultra-high $^{28}$Si isotopic purity. In this work, we apply this $^{28}$Si enrichment process to produce $^{28}$Si and $^{28}$Si-on-insulator (SOI) samples. Experimentally, we produced a $^{28}$Si sample on natural Si substrate with $^{29}$Si depleted to 7~ppm (limited by measurement noise floor), that is at least 100 nm thick. This is achieved with an ion energy that results in a sputter yield of less than one and a high ion fluence, as supported by simulations. Further, our simulations predict the $^{29}$Si and $^{30}$Si depletion in our sample to be less than 1~ppm. In the case of SOI, ion implantation conditions are found to be more stringent than those of bulk natural Si in terms of minimizing threading dislocations upon subsequent solid phase epitaxy annealing. Finally, we report the observation of nanoscopic voids in our $^{28}$SOI and $^{28}$Si samples located in the depth region between the surface and 70~nm. These voids appear to be stabilized by the presence of gold impurities and can be annealed out completely by a standard SPE annealing protocol at 620°C for 10 minutes in the absence of gold.

Title: Magnetically Compensated Nanometer-thin Ga-Substituted Yttrium Iron Garnet (Ga:YIG) Films with Robust Perpendicular Magnetic Anisotropy
Authors: Carsten Dubs, Oleksii Surzhenko
Abstract: Magnetically full or partially compensated insulating ferrimagnets with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) offer valuable insights into fundamental spin-wave physics and high-speed magnonic applications. This study reports on key magnetic parameters of nanometer-thin Ga substituted yttrium iron garnet (Ga:YIG) films with saturation magnetization 4PiMs below 200 G. Vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM) is used to determine the remanent magnetization 4PiMr and the polar orientation of the magnetic easy axis in samples with very low net magnetic moments. Additionally, the temperature dependence of the net magnetization of magnetically compensated Ga:YIG films, with compensation points Tcomp near room temperature is investigated. For films with remanent magnetization values below 60 G at room temperature, the compensation points Tcomp are determined and correlated with their Curie temperatures TC. Ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) measurements at 6.5 GHz show that the FMR linewidths Delta H FWHM correlate inversely proportional with the remanent magnetization. The reduced saturation magnetization in the Ga:YIG films leads to a significant increase in the effective magnetization 4PiMeff and thus enables films with robust PMA. This opens up a new parameter space for the fine-tuning of potential magnonic spin-wave devices on commonly used GGG substrates.

Title: Signatures of Orbital Order and Disorder in Fluoro-Perovskites with $t_{2g}$ Electronic Degeneracies
Authors: C. A. Crawford, C. I. Hiley, J. Gainza, C. Ritter, R. I. Walton, Mark S. Senn
Abstract: A detailed high-resolution, variable temperature powder diffraction study of the fluoro-perovskites NaFeF$_3$ and NaCoF$_3$ is performed to probe their orbital ordering transitions. Through analysis of the symmetry adapted macrostrains and atomic distortions, we show that NaFeF$_3$ undergoes a C-type orbital order transition associated with the $t_{2g}^4$ states of Fe$^{2+}$. Counter-intuitively, the phase transition leading to the orbital order appears second order-like, which contradicts the thermodynamic requirements for electronic and isosymmeric phase transitions, implying that there must be an associated hidden symmetry breaking. On the other hand, for NaCoF$_3$, consideration of the symmetry adapted strains allows us to confidently rule out the occurrence of any long-range orbital orders down to 4 K. Since NaCoF$_3$ is an insulator with quenched orbital angular momentum at this temperature, our findings point towards a novel kind of orbital disorder associated to the $t_{2g}^5$ electronic degeneracy.

Title: Competition of light- and phonon-dressing in microwave-dressed Bose polarons
Authors: G. M. Koutentakis, S. I. Mistakidis, F. Grusdt, H. R. Sadeghpour, P. Schmelcher
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the stationary properties of a spin-1/2 impurity immersed in a one-dimensional confined Bose gas. In particular, we consider coherently coupled spin states with an external field, where only one spin component interacts with the bath, enabling light dressing of the impurity and spin-dependent bath-impurity interactions. Through detailed comparisons with ab-initio many-body simulations, we demonstrate that the composite system is accurately described by a simplified effective Hamiltonian. The latter builds upon previously developed effective potential approaches in the absence of light dressing. It can be used to extract the impurity energy, residue, effective mass, and anharmonicity induced by the phononic dressing. Light-dressing is shown to increase the polaron residue, undressing the impurity from phononic excitations because of strong spin coupling. For strong repulsions-previously shown to trigger dynamical Bose polaron decay (a phenomenon called temporal orthogonality catastrophe), it is explained that strong light-dressing stabilizes a repulsive polaron-dressed state. Our results establish the effective Hamiltonian framework as a powerful tool for exploring strongly interacting polaronic systems and corroborating forthcoming experimental realizations.

Title: Martingale approach for first-passage problems of time-additive observables in Markov processes
Authors: Izaak Neri
Abstract: We develop a method based on martingales to study first-passage problems of time-additive observables exiting an interval of finite width in a Markov process. In the limit that the interval width is large, we derive generic expressions for the splitting probability and the cumulants of the first-passage time. These expressions relate first-passage quantities to the large deviation properties of the time-additive observable. We find that there are three qualitatively different regimes depending on the properties of the large deviation rate function of the time-additive observable. These regimes correspond to exponential, super-exponential, or sub-exponential suppression of events at the unlikely boundary of the interval. Furthermore, we show that the statistics of first-passage times at both interval boundaries are in general different, even for symmetric thresholds and in the limit of large interval widths. While the statistics of the times to reach the likely boundary are determined by the cumulants of the time-additive observables in the original process, those at the unlikely boundary are determined by a dual process. We obtain these results from a one-parameter family of positive martingales that we call Perron martingales, as these are related to the Perron root of a tilted version of the transition rate matrix defining the Markov process. Furthermore, we show that each eigenpair of the tilted matrix has a one-parameter family of martingales. To solve first-passage problems at finite thresholds, we generally require all one-parameter families of martingales, including the non-positive ones. We illustrate this by solving the first-passage problem for run-and-tumble particles exiting an interval of finite width.

Title: Graph theory and tunable slow dynamics in quantum East Hamiltonians
Authors: Heiko Georg Menzler, Mari Carmen Bañuls, Fabian Heidrich-Meisner
Abstract: We show how graph theory concepts can provide an insight into the origin of slow dynamics in systems with kinetic constraints. In particular, we observe that slow dynamics is related to the presence of strong hierarchies between nodes on the Fock-space graph in the particle occupation basis, which encodes configurations connected by a given Hamiltonian. To quantify hierarchical structures, we develop a measure of centrality of the nodes, which is applicable to generic Hamiltonian matrices and inspired by established centrality measures from graph theory. We illustrate these ideas in the quantum East (QE) model. We introduce several ways of detuning nodes in the corresponding graph that alter the hierarchical structure, defining a family of QE models. We numerically demonstrate how these detunings affect the degree of non-ergodicity on finite systems, as evidenced by both the time dependence of density autocorrelations and eigenstate properties in the detuned QE models.

Title: Hierarchical woven fibrillar structures in developing single gyroids in butterflies

Abstract: Nature offers a remarkable diversity of nanomaterials that have extraordinary functional and structural properties. Intrinsic to nature is the impressive ability to form complex ordered nanomaterials via self-organization. One particularly intriguing nanostructure is the Gyroid, a network-like structure exhibiting high symmetry and complex topology. Although its existence in cells and tissues across many biological kingdoms is well documented, how and why it forms remains elusive and uncovering these formation mechanisms will undoubtedly inform bioinspired designs. A beautiful example is the smooth single gyroid that is found in the wing scales of several butterflies, where it behaves as a photonic crystal generating a vibrant green colour. Here, we report that the gyroid structures of the Emerald-patched Cattleheart, Parides sesostris, develop as woven fibrillar structures, disputing the commonly held assumption that they form as smooth constructs. Ultramicroscopy of pupal tissue reveals that the gyroid geometry consists of helical weavings of fibres, akin to hyperbolic line patterns decorating the gyroid. Interestingly, despite their fibrillar nature, electron diffraction reveals the absence of crystalline order within this material. Similar fibrillar structures are also observed in the mature wing scales of P. sesostris specimens with surgically altered pupal development, leading to a blue colouration. Our findings not only introduce a fundamentally new variation of the gyroid in biology but also have significant implications for our understanding of its formation in nature.

Title: Supersolid phase in two-dimensional soft-core bosons at finite temperature
Authors: Sebastiano Peotta, Gabriele Spada, Stefano Giorgini, Sebastiano Pilati, Alessio Recati
Abstract: The supersolid phase of soft-core bosons in two dimensions is investigated using the self-consistent Hartree-Fock and quantum Monte Carlo methods. An approximate phase diagram at finite temperatures is initially constructed using the mean-field approach, which is subsequently validated through precise path-integral simulations, enabling a microscopic characterization of the various phases. Superfluid and melting/freezing transitions are analyzed through the superfluid density and the long-range behavior of correlation functions associated with positional and orientational order, in accordance with the general picture of Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transitions. A broad region at low temperatures is identified where the supersolid phase exists, separating the uniform superfluid phase from the normal quasi-crystal phase. Additionally, a potential intermediate hexatic phase with quasi long-range orientational order is identified in a narrow region between the normal solid and fluid phases. These findings establish self-consistent Hartree-Fock theory beyond the local density approximation as an effective tool, complementary to computationally intensive quantum Monte Carlo simulations, for investigating the melting of the supersolid phase and the possible emergence of the hexatic superfluid phase in bosonic systems with various interaction potentials.

Title: Mitigating boundary effects in finite temperature simulations of false vacuum decay
Authors: Kate Brown, Ian G. Moss, Thomas P. Billam
Abstract: The physics of false vacuum decay during first-order phase transitions in the early universe may be studied in the laboratory via cold-atom analogue simulators. However, a key difference between analogue experiments and the early universe is the trap potential confining the atoms. Rapid seeded bubble nucleation has been shown to occur at the boundary of typical trap potentials, obscuring the bulk bubble nucleation rate. This difficulty must be overcome in order to reliably probe the bulk bubble nucleation rate in an analogue simulator experiment. In this paper we show that, at finite temperature, this deleterious boundary nucleation can be mitigated by adding a 'trench' to the potential, effectively screening the boundary with a region of higher atomic density. We show that this technique is effective in two different cold-atom analogue systems, but is not needed in ferromagnetic analogue simulators.

Title: Multiscale Energy Spreading in Hard-Particle Chains
Authors: Arkady Pikovsky
Abstract: We consider a one-dimensional array of particles interacting via an infinite well potential. We explore the properties of energy spreading from an initial state where only a group of particles has non-zero velocities while others are resting. We characterize anomalous diffusion of the active domain via moments and entropies of the energy distribution. Only in the special cases of a single-well potential (hard-particle gas) and of the distance between the particles being half of the potential width does the diffusion have a single scale; otherwise, a multiscale anomalous diffusion is observed.

Title: Dynamic Training Enhances Machine Learning Potentials for Long-Lasting Molecular Dynamics
Authors: Ivan Žugec, Tin Hadži Veljković, Maite Alducin, J. Iñaki Juaristi
Abstract: Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations are vital for exploring complex systems in computational physics and chemistry. While machine learning methods dramatically reduce computational costs relative to ab initio methods, their accuracy in long-lasting simulations remains limited. Here we propose dynamic training (DT), a method designed to enhance model performance over extended MD simulations. Applying DT to an equivariant graph neural network (EGNN) on the challenging system of a hydrogen molecule interacting with a palladium cluster anchored to a graphene vacancy demonstrates a superior prediction accuracy compared to conventional approaches. Crucially, the DT architecture-independent design ensures its applicability across diverse machine learning potentials, making it a practical tool for advancing MD simulations.

Abstract: Metastability is a phenomenon encountered in many different physical systems, ranging from chemical reactions to magnetic structures. The characteristic decay timescale from a metastable to a stable state is not always straightforward to estimate since it depends on the microscopic details of the system. A paradigmatic example in quantum field theories is the decay of the false vacuum, manifested via the nucleation of bubbles. In this paper, we measure the temperature dependence of the timescale for the false vacuum decay mechanism in an ultracold atomic quantum spin mixture which exhibits ferromagnetic properties. Our results show that the false vacuum decay rate scales with temperature as predicted by the finite-temperature extension of the instanton theory, and confirm atomic systems as an ideal platform where to study out-of-equilibrium field theories.

Title: Splash in an inhomogeneous gas in one dimension: Exact analysis and molecular dynamics simulations
Authors: Amit Kumar, R. Rajesh
Abstract: We investigate the splash phenomenon resulting from the energy input at the interface between a vacuum and an inhomogeneous gas with density profile $\rho(r) = \rho_0 r^{-\beta}$. The energy input causes the formation of ballistic spatters that propagate into the vacuum, leading to a decay of the total energy in the inhomogeneous medium following a power law, $E(t) \sim t^{-\delta_s}$. We determine exactly the exponents $\delta_s$ by solving the Euler equation using a self-similar solution of second kind for different values of $\beta$. These exponents are further validated through event-driven molecular dynamics simulations. The determination of these exponents also allows us to numerically determine the spatio-temporal dependence of the density, velocity and temperature.

Title: Large plastic deformation of voids in crystals
Authors: Jalal Smiri, Joseph Paux, Oguz Umut Salman, Ioan R. Ionescu
Abstract: The mechanisms of void growth and coalescence are key contributors to the ductile failure of crystalline materials. At the grain scale, single crystal plastic anisotropy induces large strain localization leading to complex shape evolutions. In this study, an Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) framework for 2D crystal plasticity combined with dynamic remeshing is used to study the 2D shape evolution of cylindrical voids in single crystals. The large deformation and shape evolution of the voids under two types of loading are considered: (i) radial and (ii) uni-axial loadings. In both cases, the voids undergo complex shape evolutions induced by the interactions between slip bands, lattice rotations and large strain phenomena. In case (i), the onset of the deformation revealed the formation of a complex fractal network of slip bands around the voids. Then, large deformations unearth an unexpected evolution of the slip bands network associated with significant lattice rotations, leading to a final hexagonal shape for the void. In case (ii), we obtain shear bands with very large accumulated plastic strain (> 200%) compared to the macroscopic engineering strains (< 15%). A high dependence between crystalline orientations, slip band localization and therefore shape evolution was observed, concluding in a high dependency between crystalline orientation and void shape elongation, which is of prime importance regarding coalescence of the voids, thus to the formation of macro-cracks.

Authors: S. Rakhmanov, K. Matchonov, H. Yusupov, K. Nasriddinov, D. Matrasulov
Abstract: We study high-order harmonic generation by optically driven one- and two-dimensional hydrogenlike atoms formed by Coulomb imurities in graphene. The time-dependent Dirac equations with Coulomb plus time-periodic monochromatic field potentials are solved for both cases. Such characteristics of the optical high harmonic generation, as average dipole moment and high harmonic generation spectra, are computed. A sketch for table-top experimental realization of the considered models is proposed.

Title: Quantum geometry of the surface states of rhombohedral graphite and its effects on the surface superconductivity
Authors: Guodong Jiang, Tero Heikkilä, Päivi Törmä
Abstract: We investigate the quantum geometry of rhombohedral graphite/graphene (RG) surface electronic states and its effects on superconductivity. We find that the RG surface bands have a non-vanishing quantum metric at the center of the drumhead region, and the local inequality between quantum metric and Berry curvature is an equality. Therefore, their quantum geometry is analogous to the lowest Landau level (LLL). The superconducting order parameters on the two surface orbitals of RG can be polarized by the surface potential, which boosts the superconducting transition in trilayer RG triggered by the displacement field. Analyzing the superfluid properties of multilayer RG, we make a connection with the topological heavy fermion model suggested to describe magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG). It shows that RG fits in an unusual heavy-fermion picture with the flattest part of the surface bands carrying a nonzero supercurrent. These results may constrain the models constructed for the correlated phases of RG.

Title: Towards data analysis with diagrammatics
Authors: Tobias Kühn
Abstract: Systems with many interacting stochastic constituents are fully characterized by their free energy. Computing this quantity is therefore the objective of various approaches, notably perturbative expansions, which are applied in problems ranging from high-dimensional statistics to complex systems. However, a lot of these techniques are complicated to apply in practice because they lack a sufficient organization of the terms of the perturbative series. In this manuscript, we tackle this problem by using Feynman diagrams, extending a framework introduced earlier to the case of free energies at fixed variances. These diagrammatics do not require the theory to expand around to be Gaussian, which allows its application to the free energy of a spin system studied to derive message-passing algorithms by Maillard et al. 2019. We complete their perturbative derivation of the free energy in the thermodynamic limit. Furthermore, we derive resummations to estimate the entropies of poorly sampled systems requiring only limited statistics and we revisit earlier approaches to compute the free energy of the Ising model, revealing new insights due to the extension of our framework to the free energy at fixed variances. We expect our approach to be useful also for future applications, notably for problems of high-dimensional statistics, like matrix factorization, and the study of complex networks.

Title: Transfer learning from first-principles calculations to experiments with chemistry-informed domain transformation
Authors: Yuta Yahagi, Kiichi Obuchi, Fumihiko Kosaka, Kota Matsui
Abstract: Simulation-to-Real (Sim2Real) transfer learning, the machine learning technique that efficiently solves a real-world task by leveraging knowledge from computational data, has received increasing attention in materials science as a promising solution to the scarcity of experimental data. We proposed an efficient transfer learning scheme from first-principles calculations to experiments based on the chemistry-informed domain transformation, that integrates the heterogeneous source and target domains by harnessing the underlying physics and chemistry. The proposed method maps the computational data from the simulation space (source domain) into the space of experimental data (target domain). During this process, these qualitatively different domains are efficiently bridged by prior knowledge of chemistry, the statistical ensemble and the relationship between source and target quantities. As a proof-of-concept, we predict the catalyst activity for the reverse water-gas shift reaction by using the abundant first-principles data in addition to the experimental data. Through the demonstration, we confirmed that the transfer learning model exhibits positive transfer in accuracy and data efficiency. In particular, a significantly high accuracy was achieved despite using a few (less than ten) target data in domain transformation, whose accuracy is one order of magnitude smaller than that of a full scratch model trained with over 100 target data. This result indicates that the proposed method leverages the high prediction performance with few target data, which helps to save the number of trials in real laboratories.

Title: Atomistic insights on prebiotic phosphorylation of methanol from Schreibersite (Fe2NiP) corrosion: ab-initio computational study
Authors: Stefano Pantaleone, Giulia De Gasperis, Marta Corno, Albert Rimola, Nadia Balucani, Piero Ugliengo
Abstract: The prebiotic history of phosphorus is a matter of debate in the scientific community: its origin, how it landed on Earth, the selective speciation of the phosphate, and its inclusion into the organic matrix are the main unsolved issues. In this regard, Schreibersite ((Fe,Ni)3P), a mineral present in iron meteorites, can play a fundamental role as a carrier of reactive P which, as a result of the weathering processes, produces oxygenated phosphorus compounds, even the phosphate among others. In the present paper, we studied the interaction of methanol (alone and mixed with water) with the Schreibersite surfaces throughout periodic density functional theory calculations at PBE level. The results indicate that Schreibersite promotes the deprotonation of methanol and water both from thermodynamic and kinetic points of view, thus enabling the first step towards corrosion. We have simulated advanced stages of the corrosion process up to the formation of the phosphate and the phosphorylated form of methanol (methyl phosphate), showing that the formation of both products is thermodynamically favoured, as well as its solubilization, which allows other water molecules to proceed with further corrosion of Schreibersite.

Title: An optimal bound on long-range distillable entanglement
Authors: Jonah Kudler-Flam, Vladimir Narovlansky, Nikita Sopenko
Abstract: We prove an upper bound on long-range distillable entanglement in $D$ spatial dimensions. Namely, it must decay faster than $1/r$, where $r$ is the distance between entangled regions. For states that are asymptotically rotationally invariant, the bound is strengthened to $1/r^D$. We then find explicit examples of quantum states with decay arbitrarily close to the bound. In one dimension, we construct free fermion Hamiltonians with nearest neighbor couplings that have these states as ground states. Curiously, states in conformal field theory are far from saturation, with distillable entanglement decaying faster than any polynomial.

Title: Determining Spin-Dependent Light Dark Matter Rates from Neutron Scattering
Authors: Asher Berlin, Alexander J. Millar, Tanner Trickle, Kevin Zhou
Abstract: The scattering and absorption rates of light dark matter with electron spin-dependent interactions depend on the target's spin response. We show how this response is encoded by the target's dynamical magnetic susceptibility, which can be measured using neutron scattering. We directly use existing neutron scattering data to compute the dark matter scattering rate in a candidate target material, finding close agreement with the previous first-principles calculation at MeV dark matter masses. Complementary experiments and measurements can extend the reach of this technique to other dark matter models and masses, and identify promising target materials for future experiments.

Title: Asymptotic Exceptional Steady States in Dissipative Dynamics
Authors: Yu-Min Hu, Jan Carl Budich
Abstract: Spectral degeneracies in Liouvillian generators of dissipative dynamics generically occur as exceptional points, where the corresponding non-Hermitian operator becomes non-diagonalizable. Steady states, i.e. zero-modes of Liouvillians, are considered a fundamental exception to this rule since a no-go theorem excludes non-diagonalizable degeneracies there. Here, we demonstrate in the context of dissipative state preparation how a system may asymptotically approach the forbidden scenario of an exceptional steady state in the thermodynamic limit. Building on case studies ranging from NP-complete satisfiability problems encoded in a quantum master equation to the dissipative preparation of a symmetry protected topological phase, we reveal the close relation between the computational complexity of the problem at hand, and the finite size scaling towards the exceptional steady state, exemplifying both exponential and polynomial scaling. Treating the strength $W$ of quantum jumps in the Lindblad master equation as a parameter, we show that exceptional steady states at the physical value $W=1$ may be understood as a critical point hallmarking the onset of dynamical instability.

Title: Topological response in open quantum systems with weak symmetries
Authors: Ze-Min Huang, Sebastian Diehl, Xiao-Qi Sun
Abstract: In open quantum systems, the interaction of the system with its environment gives rise to two types of symmetry: a strong one, where the system's symmetry charge is conserved exactly, and a weak one, where the symmetry charge can be exchanged with the environment but remains conserved on average. While generic open quantum systems feature weak symmetries only, the symmetry protected topological response for bosonic/spin systems has only been considered in the stricter setup with additional strong symmetries. Here, we address the generic case and demonstrate that weak symmetries alone can protect topological responses that distinguish different phases of matter. For bosonic systems, focusing on one-dimensional mixed states described by locally purifiable density operators, we propose a quantized response characterizing qualitatively distinct phases. It is detectable via the decay behavior of different string order parameters. We validate our general results through a noisy Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki model. In particular, we show that the coupling to the environment can induce a phase transition to a state protected by weak symmetries, without a pure-state or strong-symmetry analog.

Title: Elastic instability of wormlike micelle solution flow in serpentine channels
Authors: Emily Y. Chen, Sujit S. Datta
Abstract: Wormlike micelle (WLM) solutions are abundant in energy, environmental, and industrial applications, which often rely on their flow through tortuous channels. How does the interplay between fluid rheology and channel geometry influence the flow behavior? Here, we address this question by experimentally visualizing and quantifying the flow of a semi-dilute WLM solution in millifluidic serpentine channels. At low flow rates, the base flow is steady and laminar, with strong asymmetry and wall slip. When the flow rate exceeds a critical threshold, the flow exhibits an elastic instability, producing spatially-heterogeneous, unsteady three-dimensional (3D) flow characterized by two notable features: (i) the formation and persistence of stagnant but strongly-fluctuating and multistable "dead zones" in channel bends, and (ii) intermittent 3D "twists" throughout the bulk flow. The geometry of these dead zones and twisting events can be rationalized by considering the minimization of local streamline curvature to reduce flow-generated elastic stresses. Altogether, our results shed new light into how the interplay between solution rheology and tortuous boundary geometry influences WLM flow behavior, with implications for predicting and controlling WLM flows in a broad range of complex environments.

Title: Two-dimensional turbulent condensates without bottom drag
Authors: Adrian van Kan, Alexandros Alexakis, Edgar Knobloch
Abstract: The extent to which statistical equilibrium theory is applicable to driven dissipative dynamics remains an important open question in many systems. We use extensive direct numerical simulations of the incompressible two-dimensional (2D) Navier-Stokes equation to examine the steady state of large-scale condensates in 2D turbulence at finite Reynolds number $Re$ in the absence of bottom drag. Large-scale condensates appear above a critical Reynolds number $Re_c\approx 4.19$. Close to this onset, we find a power-law scaling of the energy with $Re-Re_c$, with the energy spectrum at large scales following the absolute equilibrium form proposed by Kraichnan. At larger $Re$, the energy spectrum deviates from this form, displaying a steep power-law range at low wave numbers with exponent $-5$, with most of the energy dissipation occurring within the condensate at large scales. We show that this spectral exponent is consistent with the logarithmic radial vorticity profile of the condensate vortices predicted by quasi-linear theory for a viscously saturated condensate. Our findings shed new light on the classical problem of large-scale turbulent condensation in forced dissipative 2D flows in finite domains, showing that the large scales are close to equilibrium dynamics in weakly turbulent flows but not in the strong condensate regime with $Re\gg1$.

Title: Modelling Interfacial Dynamics Using Hydrodynamic Density Functional Theory: Dynamic Contact Angles and the Role of Local Viscosity
Authors: Benjamin Bursik, Rolf Stierle, Hamza Oukili, Martin Schneider, Gernot Bauer, Joachim Gross
Abstract: Hydrodynamic density functional theory (DFT) is applied to analyse dynamic contact angles of droplets in order to assess its predictive capability regarding wetting phenomena at the microscopic scale and to evaluate its feasibility for multiscale modelling. Hydrodynamic DFT incorporates the influence of fluid-fluid and solid-fluid interfaces into a hydrodynamic theory by including a thermodynamic model based on classical DFT for the chemical potential of inhomogeneous fluids. It simplifies to the isothermal Navier-Stokes equations far away from interfaces, thus connecting microscopic molecular modelling and continuum fluid dynamics. In this work we use a Helmholtz energy functional based on the perturbed-chain statistical associating fluid theory (PC-SAFT) and the viscosity is obtained from generalised entropy scaling, a one-parameter model which takes microscopic information of the fluid and solid phase into account. Deterministic (noise-free) density and velocity profiles reveal wetting phenomena including different advancing and receding contact angles, the transition from equilibrium to steady state and the rolling motion of droplets. Compared to a viscosity model based on bulk values, generalised entropy scaling provides more accurate results, which stresses the importance of including microscopic information in the local viscosity model. Hydrodynamic DFT is transferable as it captures the influence of different external forces, wetting strengths and (molecular) solid roughness. For all results good quantitative agreement with non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations is found, which emphasises that hydrodynamic DFT is able to predict wetting phenomena at the microscopic scale.

Title: Simulation of Atomic Layer Deposition with a Quantum Computer
Authors: Evgeny Plekhanov, Georgia Prokopiou, Michal Krompiec, Viktor Radovic, Pierre Desjardins, Pluton Pullumbi, David Muñoz Ramo
Abstract: In this work, we present the study of an atomic layer deposition (ALD) of zirconium by means of a quantum computation on an emulator representing the features of an architecture based on qubits implemented on carbon nanotubes. ALD process control is key in several technological applications such as spintronics, catalysis and renewable energy storage. We first derive a large ab-initio model of the precursor molecule approaching the infinite hydroxylated silicon (100) surface. In particular, we optimize geometry in three configurations: reactants, transition state and products. Subsequently, we derive an effective small cluster model for each state. Atomic valence active space (AVAS) transformation is then performed on these small clusters, leading to an effective qubit Hamiltonian, which is solved using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm. We study the convergence of the reaction activation barrier with respect to the active space size and benchmark quantum calculations on a noiseless emulator and on an emulator representing a carbon nanotube qubit architecture, including an appropriate noise model and post-selection error mitigation. These calculations reveal an excellent agreement between the two emulation modes. Our VQE calculations provide the multi-configurational corrections to the single determinant DFT and HF states and pave the way for the routine quantum calculations of ALD reactions.

Title: Controllable diatomic molecular quantum thermodynamic machines
Authors: C.O. Edet, E. P. Inyang, P. O. Amadi, O. Abah, N. Ali
Abstract: We present quantum heat machines using a diatomic molecule modelled by a $q$-deformed potential as a working medium. We analyze the effect of the deformation parameter and other potential parameters on the work output and efficiency of the quantum Otto and quantum Carnot heat cycles. Furthermore, we derive the analytical expressions of work and efficiency as a function of these parameters. Interestingly, our system reveals different operational phases for the range of parameter regimes considered, such as a quantum heat engine. In addition, the efficiency of the quantum Otto heat engine is seen to be tunable by the deformation parameter. Our findings provide useful insight for understanding the impact of anharmonicity on the design of quantum thermal machines.

Title: Behavior of the scaling correlation functions under severe subsampling
Authors: Sabrina Camargo, Nahuel Zamponi, Daniel A. Martin, Tatyana Turova, Tomás S. Grigera, Qian-Yuan Tang, Dante R. Chialvo
Abstract: Scale-invariance is a ubiquitous observation in the dynamics of large distributed complex systems. The computation of its scaling exponents, which provide clues on its origin, is often hampered by the limited available sampling data, making an appropriate mathematical description a challenge. This work investigates the behavior of correlation functions in fractal systems under conditions of severe subsampling. Analytical and numerical results reveal a striking robustness: the correlation functions continue to capture the expected scaling exponents despite substantial data reduction. This behavior is demonstrated numerically for the random 2-D Cantor set and the Sierpinski gasket, both consistent with exact analytical predictions. Similar robustness is observed in 1-D time series both synthetic and experimental, as well as in high-resolution images of a neuronal structure. Overall, these findings are broadly relevant for the structural characterization of biological systems under realistic sampling constraints.

Title: Accurate stochastic simulation of nonlinear reactions between closest particles
Authors: Taylor Kearney, Ricardo Ruiz-Baier, Mark B. Flegg
Abstract: We study a system of diffusing point particles in which any triplet of particles reacts and is removed from the system when the relative proximity of the constituent particles satisfies a predefined condition. Proximity-based reaction conditions of this kind are commonly used in particle-based simulations of chemical kinetics to mimic bimolecular reactions, those involving just two reactants, and have been extensively studied. The rate at which particles react within the system is determined by the reaction condition and particulate diffusion. In the bimolecular case, analytic relations exist between the reaction rate and the distance at which particles react allowing modellers to tune the rate of the reaction within their simulations by simply altering the reaction condition. However, generalising proximity-based reaction conditions to trimolecular reactions, those involving three particles, is more complicated because it requires understanding the distribution of the closest diffusing particle to a point in the vicinity of a spatially dependent absorbing boundary condition. We find that in this case the evolution of the system is described by a nonlinear partial integro-differential equation with no known analytic solution, which makes it difficult to relate the reaction rate to the reaction condition. To resolve this, we use singular perturbation theory to obtain a leading-order solution and show how to derive an approximate expression for the reaction rate. We then use finite element methods to quantify the higher-order corrections to this solution and the reaction rate, which are difficult to obtain analytically. Leveraging the insights gathered from this analysis, we demonstrate how to correct for the errors that arise from adopting the approximate expression for the reaction rate, enabling for the construction of more accurate particle-based simulations than previously possible.

Title: Improved Strategies for Fermionic Quantum Simulation with Global Interactions
Authors: Thierry N. Kaldenbach, Gabriel Breuil
Abstract: We present efficient quantum circuits for fermionic excitation operators tailored for ion trap quantum computers exhibiting the Mølmer-Sørensen (MS) gate. Such operators commonly arise in the study of static and dynamic properties in electronic structure problems using Unitary Coupled Cluster theory or Trotterized time evolution. We detail how the global MS interaction naturally suits the non-local structure of fermionic excitation operators under the Jordan-Wigner mapping and simultaneously provides optimal parallelism in their circuit decompositions. Compared to previous schemes on ion traps, our approach reduces the number of MS gates by factors of 2-, and 4, for single-, and double excitations, respectively. This improvement promises significant speedups and error reductions.

Title: Accurate extrapolation of MP2 correlation energies for small correlation-consistent core-valence basis sets
Authors: E. Fabiano, F. Della Sala
Abstract: The Atom-Calibrated Basis-set Extrapolation (ACBE) method is introduced as a robust approach for extrapolating MP2 correlation energies from small basis sets. Unlike conventional extrapolation techniques, ACBE incorporates system- and environment-specific parameters to enhance predictive accuracy, effectively mitigating errors associated with finite basis sets. Evaluated using the aug-cc-pwCV$n$Z basis set family across a diverse set of molecular systems, including first- and second-row species, ACBE consistently delivers reliable energy estimates, even when double- and triple-zeta basis sets are employed. These results highlight the computational efficiency of the method, making it a promising option for large MP2 studies.

Title: Silicon nanoantennas for tailoring the optical properties of MoS2 monolayers
Authors: Danae Katrisioti, Peter R. Wiecha, Aurélien Cuche, Sotiris Psilodimitrakopoulos, Guilhem Larrieu, Jonas Müller, Vincent Larrey, Bernhard Urbaszek, Xavier Marie, Emmanuel Stratakis, George Kioseoglou, Vincent Paillard, Jean-Marie Poumirol, Ioannis Paradisanos
Abstract: Silicon-based dielectric nanoantennas provide an effective platform for engineering light-matter interactions in van der Waals semiconductors. Here, we demonstrate near-field coupling between monolayer MoS2 and silicon nanoantennas arranged in hexagonal lattices with tunable geometric parameters, leading to a three-fold enhancement in photoluminescence and an excitation-wavelength-dependent emission that aligns with Mie-resonant modes. Raman spectroscopy reveals an up to 8-fold enhancement in the vibrational modes of MoS2, while second-harmonic generation exhibits a 20 to 30-fold increase in efficiency, closely correlating with the presence of the underlying nanoantennas. Our experiments and simulations quantify the tunable benefits of the near-field interactions, taking into account thin-film interference and strain-induced effects. Our findings present dielectric nanoantennas as a promising platform for tailoring linear and nonlinear optical properties in 2D materials, with potential applications in nanophotonic devices and integrated photonics.

Title: Exactly solvable models for universal operator growth
Authors: Oleksandr Gamayun, Murtaza Ali Mir, Oleg Lychkovskiy, Zoran Ristivojevic
Abstract: Quantum observables of generic many-body systems exhibit a universal pattern of growth in the Krylov space of operators. This pattern becomes particularly manifest in the Lanczos basis, where the evolution superoperator assumes the tridiagonal form. According to the universal operator growth hypothesis, the nonzero elements of the superoperator, known as Lanczos coefficients, grow asymptotically linearly. We introduce and explore broad families of Lanczos coefficients that are consistent with the universal operator growth and lead to the exactly solvable dynamics. Within these families, the subleading terms of asymptotic expansion of the Lanczos sequence can be controlled and fine-tuned to produce diverse dynamical patterns. For one of the families, the Krylov complexity is computed exactly.

Title: Quantum conditional mutual information as a probe of measurement-induced entanglement phase transitions
Authors: Yuichi Otsuka, Kazuhiro Seki, Seiji Yunoki
Abstract: We propose that the quantum conditional mutual information (QCMI), computed with a suitably chosen partition of the system, serves as a powerful probe for detecting measurement-induced entanglement phase transitions in monitored quantum circuits. To demonstrate this, we investigate monitored variable-range Clifford circuits and identify the phase boundary between volume-law and area-law entanglement phases by performing finite-size scaling analyses of the QCMI. Assuming that the entanglement entropy exhibits a logarithmic dependence on system size at criticality in short-range interacting cases, we further show that the QCMI allows for the simultaneous determination of both the critical point and the universal coefficient of the logarithmic term in the entanglement entropy via a crossing-point analysis. For the shortest-range interacting case studied, we obtain the thermodynamic-limit value of the coefficient as $\tilde{c}=1.519(3)$, which is significantly smaller than values reported in previous studies.

Title: Modeling and computing many-body electronic properties of twisted bilayer graphene with mechanical relaxation
Authors: Tianyu Kong, Alexander B. Watson, Mitchell Luskin, Kevin D. Stubbs
Abstract: We introduce and compute solutions of a many-body model of the electronic properties of twisted bilayer graphene which systematically accounts for the effects of structural relaxation. We model mechanical relaxation by coupling linear elasticity to a stacking energy that penalizes disregistry. Minimizers of the resulting functional are then input into a tight-binding model of twisted bilayer graphene, from which a single-particle continuum moiré-scale (Bistritzer-MacDonald-like) model is systematically derived. We then project this model together with a Coulomb electron-electron interaction term into the single-particle model's flat moiré bands. We numerically compute Hartree-Fock ground states of this model, comparing the relative energies of competing many-body ground states.

Title: Independent e- and m-anyon confinement in the parallel field toric code on non-square lattices
Authors: Simon M. Linsel, Lode Pollet, Fabian Grusdt
Abstract: Kitaev's toric code has become one of the most studied models in physics and is highly relevant to the fields of both quantum error correction and condensed matter physics. Most notably, it is the simplest known model hosting an extended, deconfined topological bulk phase. To this day, it remains challenging to reliably and robustly probe topological phases, as many state-of-the-art order parameters are sensitive to specific models and even specific parameter regimes. With the emergence of powerful quantum simulators which are approaching the regimes of topological bulk phases, there is a timely need for experimentally accessible order parameters. Here we study the ground state physics of the parallel field toric code on the honeycomb, triangular and cubic lattices using continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo. By extending the concept of experimentally accessible percolation-inspired order parameters (POPs) we show that electric and magnetic anyons are independently confined on the honeycomb and triangular lattices, unlike on the square lattice. Our work manifestly demonstrates that, even in the ground state, we must make a distinction between topological order and \mbox{(de-)confinement}. Moreover, we report multi-critical points in the aforementioned confinement phase diagrams. Finally, we map out the topological phase diagrams on the honeycomb, triangular and cubic lattices and compare the performance of the POPs with other topological order parameters. Our work paves the way for studies of confinement involving dynamical matter and the associated multi-critical points in contemporary quantum simulation platforms for $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theories.

Title: Higgsing Transitions from Topological Field Theory & Non-Invertible Symmetry in Chern-Simons Matter Theories
Authors: Clay Cordova, Diego García-Sepúlveda, Kantaro Ohmori
Abstract: Non-invertible one-form symmetries are naturally realized in (2+1)d topological quantum field theories. In this work, we consider the potential realization of such symmetries in (2+1)d conformal field theories, investigating whether gapless systems can exhibit similar symmetry structures. To that end, we discuss transitions between topological field theories in (2+1)d which are driven by the Higgs mechanism in Chern-Simons matter theories. Such transitions can be modeled mesoscopically by filling spacetime with a lattice-shaped domain wall network separating the two topological phases. Along the domain walls are coset conformal field theories describing gapless chiral modes trapped by a locally vanishing scalar mass. In this presentation, the one-form symmetries of the transition point can be deduced by using anyon condensation to track lines through the domain wall network. Using this framework, we discuss a variety of concrete examples of non-invertible one-form symmetry in fixed-point theories. For instance, $SU(k)_{2}$ Chern-Simons theory coupled to a scalar in the symmetric tensor representation produces a transition from an $SU(k)_{2}$ phase to an $SO(k)_{4}$ phase and has non-invertible one-form symmetry $PSU(2)_{-k}$ at the fixed point. We also discuss theories with $Spin(2N)$ and $E_{7}$ gauge groups manifesting other patterns of non-invertible one-form symmetry. In many of our examples, the non-invertible one-form symmetry is not a modular invariant TQFT on its own and thus is an intrinsic part of the fixed-point dynamics.

Title: Healing of a Topological Scar: Coordination Defects in a Honeycomb Lattice
Authors: Benjamin N Katz, Vincent Crespi
Abstract: A crystal structure with a point defect typically returns to its ideal local structure upon moving a few bond lengths away from the defect; topological defects such as dislocations or disclinations also heal rapidly in this regard. Here we describe a simple point defect -- a two-fold atom incorporated at the growth edge of a 2D hexagonal honeycomb material -- whose healing may require a defect complex with 50 or more atoms. $\textit{Topologically}$ the two-fold atom disappears into a single 'long bond' between its neighbors, thereby inducing a pentagonal disclination. However, $\textit{chemically}$ this disclination occupies as much physical space as a six-fold ring. This incompatibility of chemistry and topology can cause a ''ringing'' of the Gaussian curvature that creates an expansive healing region and may even spawn a semi-infinite grain boundary propagating outwards from the topological scar.

Title: Quantum many-body thermal machines enabled by atom-atom correlations
Authors: R. S. Watson, K. V. Kheruntsyan
Abstract: Particle-particle correlations, characterized by Glauber's second-order correlation function,play an important role in the understanding of various phenomena in radio and optical astronomy, quantum and atom optics, particle physics, condensed matter physics, and quantum many-body theory. However, the relevance of such correlations to quantum thermodynamics has so far remained illusive. Here, we propose and investigate a class of quantum many-body thermal machines whose operation is directly enabled by second-order atom-atom correlations in an ultracold atomic gas. More specifically, we study quantum thermal machines that operate in a sudden interaction-quench Otto cycle and utilize a one-dimensional Lieb-Liniger gas of repulsively interacting bosons as the working fluid. The atom-atom correlations in such a gas are different to those of a classical ideal gas, and are a result of the interplay between interparticle interactions, quantum statistics, and thermal fluctuations. We show that operating these thermal machines in the intended regimes, such as a heat engine, refrigerator, thermal accelerator, or heater, would be impossible without such atom-atom correlations. Our results constitute a step forward in the design of conceptually new quantum thermodynamic devices which take advantage of uniquely quantum resources such as quantum coherence, correlations, and entanglement.

Title: FeGe as a building block for the kagome 1:1, 1:6:6, and 1:3:5 families: hidden d-orbital decoupling of flat band sectors, effective models and interaction Hamiltonians
Authors: Yi Jiang, Haoyu Hu, Dumitru Călugăru, Claudia Felser, Santiago Blanco-Canosa, Hongming Weng, Yuanfeng Xu, B. Andrei Bernevig
Abstract: The electronic structure and interactions of kagome materials, such as the 1:1 (FeGe) and 1:6:6 (MgFe6Ge6) classes, are complicated and involve many orbitals and bands around the Fermi level. Current theoretical models treat the systems in an $s$-orbital kagome representation, unsuited and incorrect both quantitatively and qualitatively to the material realities. In this work, we lay the basis of a faithful framework of the electronic model for this large class of materials. We show that the complicated ``spaghetti" of electronic bands near the Fermi level can be decomposed into three groups of Fe d orbitals coupled to specific Ge orbitals via symmetry and chemical analysis. Such a decomposition allows for a clear analytical understanding (leading to different results than the simple s-orbital kagome models) of the flat bands in the system based on the S-matrix formalism of generalized bipartite lattices. Our three minimal Hamiltonians can reproduce the quasiflat bands, van Hove singularities, topology, and Dirac points close to the Fermi level, which we prove by extensive ab initio studies. We also obtain the interacting Hamiltonian for the d orbitals in FeGe using the constraint random phase approximation (cRPA) method, which faithfully describes the antiferromagnetic phase. We then use FeGe as a fundamental LEGO-like building block for a large family of 1:6:6 kagome materials, which can be obtained by doubling and perturbing the FeGe Hamiltonian. We apply the model to its kagome siblings FeSn and CoSn, and also MgFe6Ge6. We further extend the formalism developed for the 1:1 family to the 1:3:5 family AB3Z5 (A = K, Rb, Cs; B = Cr, V, Ti; Z = Sb, Bi), demonstrating the broad applicability of the LEGO-like building block approach. Our work serves as the first complete framework for the study of the interacting phase diagram of kagome compounds.

Title: Quantum Many-Body Scarring in a Non-Abelian Lattice Gauge Theory
Authors: Giuseppe Calajò, Giovanni Cataldi, Marco Rigobello, Darvin Wanisch, Giuseppe Magnifico, Pietro Silvi, Simone Montangero, Jad C. Halimeh
Abstract: Quantum many-body scarring (QMBS) is an intriguing mechanism of weak ergodicity breaking that has recently spurred significant attention. Particularly prominent in Abelian lattice gauge theories (LGTs), an open question is whether QMBS nontrivially arises in non-Abelian LGTs. Here, we present evidence of robust QMBS in a non-Abelian SU(2) LGT with dynamical matter. Starting in product states that require little experimental overhead, we show that prominent QMBS arises for certain quenches, facilitated through meson and baryon-antibaryon excitations, highlighting its non-Abelian nature. The uncovered scarred dynamics manifests as long-lived coherent oscillations in experimentally accessible local observables as well as prominent revivals in the state fidelity. Our findings bring QMBS to the realm of non-Abelian LGTs, highlighting the intimate connection between scarring and gauge symmetry, and are amenable for observation in a recently proposed trapped-ion qudit quantum computer.

Title: Quantum effects and temperature dependence of the free energy barrier and shear frequency in bilayer graphene
Authors: Jean Paul Nery, Lorenzo Monacelli, Francesco Mauri
Abstract: Little is known about the quantum effects of friction, and first-principles studies are virtually non-existent. In multilayer graphene, the order of the stacking of the layers plays a crucial role in the electronic properties and the manifestation of superconductivity, and friction affects how layers slide to change the stacking. Here, we study the effects of friction in bilayer graphene by focusing on quantum fluctuations in the free energy barrier that layers have to overcome to slide with respect to each other. We evaluate the free energy at the barrier in bilayer graphene through the self-consistent harmonic approximation, accounting for quantum and thermal ionic fluctuations. We obtain a very large reduction of the barrier of more than 30%. Temperature effects are weaker, although high temperatures induce a significant reduction of the barrier as well. Our approach is general and paves the way for systematically accounting for nuclear quantum and thermal effects in free energy barriers of other macroscopic systems.

Title: Stabilizing an individual charge fluctuator in a Si/SiGe quantum dot
Authors: Feiyang Ye, Ammar Ellaboudy, John M. Nichol
Abstract: Charge noise is a major obstacle to improved gate fidelities in silicon spin qubits. Numerous methods exist to mitigate charge noise, including improving device fabrication, dynamical decoupling, and real-time parameter estimation. In this work, we demonstrate a new class of techniques to mitigate charge noise in semiconductor quantum dots by controlling the noise sources themselves. Using two different classical feedback methods, we stabilize an individual charged two-level fluctuator in a Si/SiGe quantum dot by exploiting sensitive gate-voltage dependence of the switching times. These control methods reduce the low-frequency component of the noise power spectrum by an order of magnitude. These techniques also enable stabilizing the fluctuator in either of its states. In the future, such techniques may enable improved coherence times in quantum-dot spin qubits.

Title: Vortex ratchet effect in superconductor open nanotubes and nanopetals
Authors: Igor Bogush, Rodrigo H. de Bragança, Vladimir M. Fomin, Oleksandr V. Dobrovolskiy
Abstract: Advancements in the fabrication of superconducting 3D nanostructures and the creation of artificial pinning sites pave the way to novel applications and enhancement of nanosensors, bolometers, and quantum interferometers. The dynamics of magnetic flux quanta (Abrikosov vortices) in 3D nanoarchitectures reveal a rich palette of phenomena unseen in planar counterparts. Here, we consider two types of superconductor 3D nanostructures -- open nanotubes and nanopetals -- carrying an azimuthal transport current in a homogeneous external magnetic field. The complex 3D geometry of the structures induces an inhomogeneity of the normal magnetic field and makes the vortices move along preferred paths. By introducing a series of asymmetric pinning sites along these paths, we demonstrate non-reciprocity in the flux transport, which, in the 3D nanostructures, is stronger than in the planar membranes. The enhancement of the vortex ratchet effect manifests via a difference in the vortex depinning current under current reversal in a wider range of magnetic fields. The revealed effect is attributed to the inhomogeneous field-induced vortex channeling through the areas containing the asymmetric pinning sites. Our results demonstrate that the ratchet effect can persist up to higher magnetic fields via extending a superconducting film into the third dimension, without an increase in the number of asymmetric pinning sites.

Title: Dephasing of planar Ge hole spin qubits due to 1/$\textit{f}$ charge noise
Authors: Zhanning Wang, Sina Gholizadeh, Xuedong Hu, S. Das Sarma, Dimitrie Culcer
Abstract: Hole spin qubits in Ge, investigated for all-electrical spin manipulation because of its large spin-orbit coupling, are exposed to charge noise leading to decoherence. Here we construct a model of $1/f$ noise from individual fluctuators and determine the dephasing time $T_2^*$ as a function of qubit properties. $T_2^*$ decreases with increasing magnetic field and is an order of magnitude longer for out-of-plane than for in-plane fields for the same Zeeman energy. $T_2^*$ shows little variation as a function of the top gate field and is a complex function of the dot radius. Our results should help experiments to enhance coherence in hole qubit architectures.

Title: Shock propagation in a driven hard sphere gas: molecular dynamics simulations and hydrodynamics
Authors: Amit Kumar, R. Rajesh
Abstract: The continuous injection of energy in a stationary gas creates a shock wave that propagates radially outwards. We study the hydrodynamics of this disturbance using event driven molecular dynamics of a hard sphere gas in two and three dimensions, the numerical solution of the Euler equation with a virial equation of state for the gas, and the numerical solution of the Navier-Stokes equation, for the cases when the driving is localised in space and when it is uniform throughout the shock. We show that the results from the Euler equation do not agree with the data from hard sphere simulations when the driving is uniform and has singularities when the driving is localised. Including dissipative terms through the Navier-Stokes equation results in reasonably good description of the data, when the coefficients of dissipation are chose parametrically.

Title: Phase Separation on Deformable Membranes: interplay of mechanical coupling and dynamic surface geometry
Authors: Antonia Winter (1), Yuhao Liu (1), Alexander Ziepke (1), George Dadunashvili (1), Erwin Frey (1,2) ((1) Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München, (2) Max Planck School Matter to Life)
Abstract: The self-organization of proteins into enriched compartments and the formation of complex patterns are crucial processes for life on the cellular level. Liquid-liquid phase separation is one mechanism for forming such enriched compartments. When phase-separating proteins are membrane-bound and locally disturb it, the mechanical response of the membrane mediates interactions between these proteins. How these membrane-mediated interactions influence the steady state of the protein density distribution is thus an important question to investigate in order to understand the rich diversity of protein and membrane-shape patterns present at the cellular level. This work starts with a widely used model for membrane-bound phase-separating proteins. We numerically solve our system to map out its phase space and perform a careful, systematic expansion of the model equations to characterize the phase transitions through linear stability analysis and free energy arguments. We observe that the membrane-mediated interactions, due to their long-range nature, are capable of qualitatively altering the equilibrium state of the proteins. This leads to arrested coarsening and length-scale selection instead of simple demixing and complete coarsening. In this study, we unambiguously show that long-range membrane-mediated interactions lead to pattern formation in a system that otherwise would not do so. This work provides a basis for further systematic study of membrane-bound pattern-forming systems.

Title: A Novel Liquid-Liquid Interface Deposition Method for the Production of Thin Films and van der Waals Heterostructures of Two-Dimensional Solids
Authors: Amy R. Smith, Muhammad Zulqurnain, Angus G.M. Mathieson, Marek Szablewski, Michael R.C. Hunt
Abstract: Thin films and van der Waals heterostructures derived from two-dimensional solids offer enormous potential for a broad range of novel, energy efficient devices, however, their use is currently hampered by slow, labor-intensive fabrication methods often employing hazardous chemicals. We demonstrate a novel technique for rapid, low-cost and environmentally-friendly production of ultra-thin films and van der Waals heterostructures of two-dimensional solids from aqueous surfactant-stabilized suspensions, which we term `Liquid Interface Deposition'. Films are produced by the transfer of platelets of two-dimensional materials assembled at the interface between two immiscible liquids (water and dicholoromethane), at which surfactants which stabilize the two-dimensional materials in the aqueous phase are `stripped' from the platelets due to preferential partitioning of the surfactant to the non-aqeuous phase. The approach is generic to two-dimensional materials which can be stabilized in aqueous suspension by a surfactant and the resulting films can then be transferred to an arbitrary substrate by a range of approaches. The generic applicability of this technique is demonstrated through production of thin films on a variety of substrates, deposition of transparent, highly conductive, graphene films with conductivities between $7.7 \times 10^{3} - 1.26\times 10^{5}~\textrm{S m}^{-1}$ and transmittances of 55-75%, and by the fabrication of van der Waals heterostructures of MoS$_2$, WS$_2$, and few-layer graphene.

Title: Crystal structure evolution induced by the Jahn-Teller effect in mixed-valence silver fluoride Ag$_3$F$_5$
Authors: Dmitry M. Korotin, Dmitry Y. Novoselov, Yaroslav M. Plotnikov, Vladimir I. Anisimov
Abstract: The silver fluoride Ag$_3$F$_5$ consists structurally of square-planar units formed by four fluoride ions coordinated to a central silver ion, which possesses a partially filled $d$-subshell and the formal valence of +5/3. In this study, we demonstrate that the previously published crystal structure of Ag$_3$F$_5$ is unstable due to the Jahn-Teller effect, arising from the presence of two energetically degenerate $d_{x^2-y^2}$ states sharing a single electron hole. Through a full structural relaxation within the DFT+U framework, we identified a new crystal structure for Ag$_3$F$_5$ with reduced symmetry and an energy gain of 151~meV per formula unit relative to the published structure. In this relaxed structure, magnetic chains are formed by silver ions with an electronic hole occupying the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital. These results highlight the crucial role of electron correlation effects and related structural distortions in determining the properties of such materials.

Title: On the distributed resistor-constant phase element transmission line in a reflective bounded domain
Authors: Anis Allagui, Enrique H. Balaguera, Chunlei Wang
Abstract: In this work we derive and study the analytical solution of the voltage and current diffusion equation for the case of a finite-length resistor-constant phase element (CPE) transmission line (TL) network that can represent a model for porous electrodes in the absence of any Faradic processes. The energy storage component is considered to be an elemental CPE per unit length of impedance $z_c(s)={1}/{(c_{\alpha} s^{\alpha})}$ with constant parameters $(c_{\alpha},\alpha)$ instead of the ideal capacitor of impedance $z(s)={1}/{(c\, s)}$ usually assumed in TL modeling. The problem becomes a time-fractional diffusion equation for the voltage that we solve under galvanostatic charging, and derive from it a reduced impedance function of the form $z_{\alpha}(s_n)=s_n^{-\alpha/2}\coth({s_n^{\alpha/2}})$, where $s_n = j\omega_n$ is a normalized frequency. We also derive the system's step response, and the distribution function of relaxation times associated with it. The analysis can be viewed and used as a support for the fractal finite-length Warburg model.

Title: The Higgs-Amplitude mode in the optical conductivity in the presence of a supercurrent: Gauge-invariant formulation with disorder
Authors: Ke Wang, Rufus Boyack, K. Levin
Abstract: Observing the ``Higgs" or amplitude mode in superconductors has been a central challenge in condensed matter physics. Moreover, arriving at a theoretical understanding of this mode and how it is accessible in, say, conductivity experiments presents an additional challenge as here one needs to satisfy gauge invariance in the presence of disorder. In this paper, we characterize the Higgs contribution within a fully gauge-invariant treatment of the linear optical conductivity, $\sigma(\omega)$, for a disordered superconductor carrying a uniform supercurrent. As a consequence of gauge invariance, there are two distinct charge conservation laws underlying the linear electromagnetic response with two associated sets of $f$-sum rules. An interesting finding from the Higgs-related sum rule is that the imaginary part of $\sigma(\omega)$ yields an anisotropic, \textit{negative} $1/\omega$ contribution in the THz regime. This is relevant to device applications and appears to be consistent with recent experiments. The work presented here emphasizes how difficult it is to disentangle the neutral amplitude mode contributions from those of the charged quasi-particles and we demonstrate why this is the case.

Title: Interaction-induced phases in the half-filled Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model in one dimension
Authors: Roberta Favata, Davide Piccioni, Alberto Parola, Federico Becca
Abstract: We explore the ground-state properties of a one-dimensional model with two orbitals per site, where, in addition to atomic energies $\pm M$, intra- and inter-orbital hoppings, the intra-orbital Hubbard ($U$) and nearest-neighbor density-density ($V$) repulsions are included. Our results are primarily based on a Jastrow-Slater wave function and variational Monte Carlo methods, but also corroborated by density-matrix renormalization group calculations. In the non-interacting limit, when varying $M>0$, a gapless point separates a trivial phase from a topological one. The inclusion of a finite Hubbard-$U$ repulsion does not give rise to any phase transition within the topological region, inducing a smooth crossover into a Haldane (spin gapped) insulator; notably, the string-order parameter, which characterizes the latter phase, is already finite in the non-interacting limit. Most importantly, at finite values of $U$, the transition between the trivial and topological states is not direct, since an emergent insulator, which shows evidence of sustaining gapless spin excitations, intrudes between them. A small $V$ interaction further stabilizes the intermediate insulator, while a sufficiently large value of this nearest-neighbor repulsion gives rise to two different charge-density wave insulators, one fully gapped and another still supporting gapless spin excitations. Our results demonstrate the richness of multi-orbital Hubbard models, in the presence of a topologically non-trivial band structure, and serve as a basis for future investigations on similar two-dimensional models.

Title: Characteristic oscillations in frequency-resolved heat dissipation of linear time-delayed Langevin systems: Approach from the violation of the fluctuation-response relation
Authors: Xin Wang, Ruicheng Bao, Naruo Ohga
Abstract: Time-delayed effects are widely present in nature, often accompanied by distinctive nonequilibrium features, such as negative apparent heat dissipation. To elucidate detailed structures of the dissipation, we study the frequency decomposition of the heat dissipation in linear time-delayed Langevin systems. We decompose the heat dissipation into frequency spectrum using the Harada-Sasa equality, which relates the heat dissipation to the violation of the fluctuation-response relation (FRR). We find a characteristic oscillatory behavior in the spectrum, and the oscillation asymptotically decays with an envelope inversely proportional to the frequency in the high-frequency region. Furthermore, the oscillation over the low-frequency region reflects the magnitude and sign of the heat dissipation. We confirm the generality of the results by extending our analysis to systems with multiple delay times. Since the violation of FRR is experimentally accessible, our results suggest an experimental direction for detecting and analyzing detailed characteristics of dissipation in time-delayed systems.

Title: On the pseudo-doublet ground state of the non-Kramers compound SrTm2O4 and its frustrated antiferromagnetic interactions
Authors: D. L. Quintero Castro, A. Bhat Kademane, M. Pregelj, R. Toft-Petersen, D. G. Mazzone, G. S. Tucker, C. Salazar Mejia, J. Gronemann, H.-F. Li
Abstract: Here we present experimental evidence of the pseudo-doublet ground state of the non-Kramers compound SrTm2O4, based on specific heat, magnetic entropy and electron paramagnetic resonance. We demonstrate that the two crystallographic Tm3+ sites give rise to distinct single-ion anisotropies, and by extension, SrTm2O4 hosts two magnetic sublattices. Inelastic neutron scattering reveals low-lying dispersing crystal-field excitations, which we modelled using an effective charge model and mean field random phase approximation. The extracted magnetic exchange interactions are both antiferromagnetic and frustrated for both chains. Interchain magnetic exchange interactions are negligible. The strength of the magnetic exchange interactions in relation to the size of crystal field gaps, together with the frustration and low dimensionality, force the system to remain paramagnetic down to the lowest experimentally reachable temperature despite the pseudo-doublet nature of its ground state.

Title: Thermodynamics of $s_{\pm}-to-s_{++}$ transition in iron pnictides in the vicinity of the Born limit
Authors: Vadim Shestakov, Maxim M. Korshunov
Abstract: To study thermodynamical properties of the disorder-induced transition between $s_{\pm}$ and $s_{++}$ superconducting gap functions, we calculate the grand thermodynamic potential $\Omega$ in the normal and the superconducting states. Expression for the difference between the two, $\Delta\Omega$, is derived for a two-band model for Fe-based systems with nonmagnetic impurities. The disorder is considered in a $\mathcal{T}$-matrix approximation within the multiband Eliashberg theory. In the vicinity of the Born limit near the $s_{\pm}$-to-$s_{++}$ transition, we find two solutions obtained for opposite directions of the system's evolution with respect to the impurity scattering rate. By calculating the change in entropy $\Delta S$ and the change in electronic specific heat $\Delta C$ from $\Delta\Omega$, we show that such a hysteresis is not due to the time-reversal symmetry breaking state, but it rather points out to the first order phase transition induced by the nonmagnetic disorder. Based on the $\Delta\Omega$ calculations, phase diagram is plotted representing the energetically favourable $s_{\pm}$ and $s_{++}$ states and the transition between them. At finite temperature, a first order phase transition line there is limited by a critical end point. Above that point, the sharp $s_{\pm} \to s_{++}$ transition transforms to a crossover between $s_{\pm}$ and $s_{++}$ states.

Title: Polarization-Resolved Core Exciton Dynamics in LiF Using Attosecond Transient Absorption Spectroscopy
Authors: Kylie J Gannan, Lauren B Drescher, Rafael Quintero-Bermudez, Navdeep Rana, Chengye Huang, Kenneth Schafer, Mette B Gaarde, Stephen R Leone
Abstract: The ability to control absorption by modifying the polarization of light presents an exciting opportunity to experimentally determine the orbital alignment of absorption features. Here, attosecond extreme ultraviolet (XUV) transient absorption spectroscopy is used to investigate the polarization dependence of core exciton dynamics in LiF thin films at the Li+ K edge. XUV pulses excite electrons from the Li 1s core level into the conduction band, allowing for the formation of a p-orbital-like core exciton, aligned along the XUV light polarization axis. A sub-5 fs near-infrared (NIR) probe pulse then arrives at variable time delays, perturbing the XUV-excited states and allowing the coherence decay of the core exciton to be mapped. The coherence lifetimes are found to be ~2.4 +- 0.4 fs, which is attributed to a phonon-mediated dephasing mechanism as in previous core exciton studies. The differential absorption features are also shown to be sensitive to the relative polarization of the XUV and NIR fields. The parallel NIR probe induces couplings between the initial XUV-excited p-like bright exciton and s-like dark excitons. When crossed pump and probe polarizations are used, the coupling between the bright and dark states is no longer dipole-allowed, and the transient absorption signal associated with the coupling is suppressed by approximately 90%. This interpretation is supported by simulations of a few-level model system, as well as analysis of the calculated band structure. The results indicate that laser polarization can serve as a powerful experimental tool for exploring the orbital alignment of core excitonic states in solid-state materials.

Title: Floquet-Engineered Hybrid Topological Orders with Majorana Edge Modes in Number-Conserving Fermionic Quantum Simulators
Authors: Zhi Lin, Qi Song, Sheng Yue, Ming Yang, Jie Lou, Yan Chen
Abstract: We develop an experimental protocol based on Floquet-engineered ultracold fermions in optical lattices, enabling the emulation of pair-hopping and competing singlet/triplet pairing interactions. Through large-scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations, we uncover three emergent topological phases: (i) A Majorana-enabled spin-density-wave (MS) phase featuring exponentially localized edge charges, non-local fermionic edge correlations, and doubly degenerate entanglement spectra; (ii) A z-axis polarized triplet superconducting (TS) phase exhibiting fractionalized edge spins (S=1/4 per edge), two-fold ground state degeneracy and a bulk single-particle gap; (iii) A hybrid x-directional triplet superconducting (XTS) phase that uniquely combines fractional spin textures and Majorana-type edge correlations, defining a new universality class of hybrid orders in number-conserving systems. These findings establish a universal framework for engineering non-Abelian topological matter, crucially bypassing the need for external pairing fields while maintaining experimental feasibility with current cold-atom techniques.

Title: Superconducting diode efficiency from singlet-triplet mixing in disordered systems
Authors: Jaglul Hasan, Daniel Shaffer, Maxim Khodas, Alex Levchenko
Abstract: The superconducting diode effect (SDE) -- the nonreciprocity of the critical current in a bulk superconductor -- has garnered significant attention due to its potential applications in superconducting electronics. However, the role of disorder scattering in SDE has rarely been considered, despite its potential qualitative impact, as we demonstrate in this work. We investigate SDE in a disordered Rashba superconductor under an in-plane magnetic field, employing a self-consistent Born approximation to derive the corresponding Ginzburg-Landau theory. Our analysis reveals two surprising effects. First, in the weak Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) regime, disorder can reverse the direction of the diode effect, indicated by a sign change in the superconducting diode efficiency coefficient. Second, in the strong Rashba SOC regime, disorder becomes the driving mechanism of SDE, which vanishes in its absence. In this case, we show that disorder-induced mixing of singlet and triplet superconducting orders underlies the effect.

Title: Predicting the Néel temperatures in general helimagnetic materials: a comparison between mean field theory, random phase approximation, renormalized spin wave theory and classical Monte Carlo simulations
Authors: Varun Rajeev Pavizhakumari, Thomas Olsen
Abstract: The critical temperature for magnetic order comprises a crucial property of any magnetic material and ranges from a few Kelvin in certain antiferromagnets to 1400 K in ferromagnetic Co. However, the prediction of critical temperatures based on, for example, a spin wave dispersion is in general non-trivial. For ferromagnets and simple collinear antiferromagnets, estimates may be obtained from the Heisenberg model using either renormalized spin wave theory or the Green's function random phase approximation (RPA), but a systematic assessment of the accuracy of such approaches seems to be lacking in the literature. In this work, we propose generalizations of both renormalized spin wave theory and RPA to calculate the critical temperatures of single-$Q$ helimagnetic ground states, which include ferromagnets and antiferromagnets as special cases. We compare the methods to classical Monte Carlo simulations and Mean field theory, using experimental exchange parameters for a wide range of materials; MnO and NiO (single site Néel ground states), MnF$_2$ (altermagnet), Cr$_2$O$_3$ and Fe$_2$O$_3$ (two site Néel states) and Ba$_3$NbFe$_3$Si$_2$O$_{14}$ (incommensurate helimagnet). In all cases, we observe that predictions from RPA are in excellent agreement with experimental values and RPA thus constitutes a rather reliable all-purpose method for calculating critical temperatures.

Title: Understanding entropy production via a thermal zero-player game
Authors: Mehmet Süzen
Abstract: A new thermal bath scheme for Ising-Conway Entropy Game (ICEg) is introduced. New game moves in sampling the given temperature is achieved via Monte Carlo dynamics of both Metropolis and Glauber as a stochastic game. This kind of approach makes the game an ideal tool for demonstrating thermal dependency of entropy production in a novel way. Using this new approach, Ising-Conway Entropy game's rate of entropy production depending on different temperatures are explored. Thermalized game is shown to be physically interesting and plausible test bed for studying complex dynamical systems in classical statistical mechanics, that is conceptually simple, pedagogically accessible, yet realistic.

Title: Electron-Chiral Phonon Coupling, Crystal Angular Momentum, and Phonon Chirality
Authors: Tomomi Tateishi, Akihito Kato, Jun-ichiro Kishine
Abstract: We explicitly derive the wavefunctions of chiral phonons propagating along the helical axis in chiral crystals and clarify the characteristics of electron-phonon interactions in chiral helical crystals. In particular, we elucidate how the conservation of not only the crystal momentum (CM) but also the crystal angular momentum (CAM) manifests in the interaction vertex. This formulation provides a microscopic framework for describing physical processes involving chiral phonons. Furthermore, we construct a phononic analogue of Zilch, a known measure of chirality carried by light, and discuss its relationship with phonon angular momentum.

Title: Dielectric permittivity of water confined in stacks of charged lipid layers: extracting profiles from molecular dynamics simulations using a modified Poisson-Boltzmann equation
Authors: Ludovic Gardré, Swen Helstroffer, Pierre Muller, Fabrice Thalmann, Thierry Charitat, Laurent Joly, Claire Loison
Abstract: Most organic and inorganic surfaces (e.g., glass, nucleic acids or lipid membranes) become charged in aqueous solutions. The resulting ionic distribution induces effective interactions between the charged surfaces. Stacks of like-charged lipid bilayers immersed in multivalent ion solutions exhibit strong coupling (SC) effects, where ion correlations cause counter-intuitive membrane attraction. A similar attraction observed with monovalent ions is explained by SC theory through reduced dielectric permittivity under confinement. To explore this phenomenon, we propose a modified Poisson-Boltzmann (mPB) model with spatially varying dielectric permittivity and explicit Born solvation energy for ions. We use the model to investigate the dielectric permittivity profile of confined water in molecular dynamics simulations of charged lipid layers stacks at varying hydration levels, and compare the results with alternative computational methods. The model captures a sharp decrease in permittivity as the system enters the attractive regime, converging to a plateau value that we attribute to lipid headgroups. The generic nature of the mPB framework allows application to other systems, such as other biological interfaces or solid walls, provided ions follow Boltzmann statistics.

Title: First-Principle Investigation On Chromium Decorated Graphene-based Systems for Hydrogen Storage
Authors: Pratyasha Tripathy, Hetvi Jadav, Himanshu Pandey
Abstract: Sorbent materials like Cr decorated 2D materials are explored among its storage options. 2D material like graphene has been used as it has a high surface to volume ratio. A comparative study is done with Cr adsorbed in defect-free and single vacancy defect graphene systems. Ab-initio calculations are performed with and without Van der Waals interaction to check the hydrogen storage efficiency. Efficiency is determined by calculating the binding energy of the system. The preferred range for binding energy for reversible hydrogen storage, as determined by the Department of Energy, US, is between 0.2-0.6 eV. This work also visualizes the thermal stability spectrum of the efficient materials at 300 K using molecular dynamics calculations, predicting their stability at room temperature.

Title: Condensations in higher categories
Authors: Davide Gaiotto, Theo Johnson-Freyd
Abstract: We present a higher-categorical generalization of the "Karoubi envelope" construction from ordinary category theory, and prove that, like the ordinary Karoubi envelope, our higher Karoubi envelope is the closure for absolute limits. Our construction replaces the idempotents in the ordinary version with a notion that we call "condensations." The name is justified by the direct physical interpretation of the notion of condensation: it encodes a general class of constructions which produce a new topological phase of matter by turning on a commuting projector Hamiltonian on a lattice of defects within a different topological phase, which may be the trivial phase. We also identify our higher Karoubi envelopes with categories of fully-dualizable objects. Together with the Cobordism Hypothesis, we argue that this realizes an equivalence between a very broad class of gapped topological phases of matter and fully extended topological field theories, in any number of dimensions.

Title: Data assimilation for networks of coupled oscillators: Inferring unknown model parameters from partial observations
Authors: Lauren D. Smith, Georg A. Gottwald
Abstract: Inferring the state and unknown parameters of a network of coupled oscillators is of utmost importance. This task is made harder when only partial and noisy observations are available, which is a typical scenario in realistic high-dimensional systems. The general task of inference falls under data assimilation, and a commonly used assimilation method is the Ensemble Kalman Filter. Employing network-specific localization of the forecast covariance, an Ensemble Kalman Filter with state space augmentation is shown to yield highly accurate estimates of both the oscillator phases and unknown model parameters in the case where only a subset of oscillator phases are observed. In contrast, standard data assimilation methods yield poor results. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for Kuramoto oscillators and for networks of theta neurons, using a variety of network topologies.

Title: A universal approximation theorem for nonlinear resistive networks
Authors: Benjamin Scellier, Siddhartha Mishra
Abstract: Resistor networks have recently been studied as analog computing platforms for machine learning, particularly due to their compatibility with the Equilibrium Propagation training framework. In this work, we explore the computational capabilities of these networks. We prove that electrical networks consisting of voltage sources, linear resistors, diodes, and voltage-controlled voltage sources (VCVSs) can approximate any continuous function to arbitrary precision. Central to our proof is a method for translating a neural network with rectified linear units into an approximately equivalent electrical network comprising these four elements. Our proof relies on two assumptions: (a) that circuit elements are ideal, and (b) that variable resistor conductances and VCVS amplification factors can take any value (arbitrarily small or large). Our findings provide insights that could guide the development of universal self-learning electrical networks.

Title: Dynamical excitation control and multimode emission of an atom-photon bound state
Authors: Claudia Castillo-Moreno, Kazi Rafsanjani Amin, Ingrid Strandberg, Mikael Kervinen, Amr Osman, Simone Gasparinetti
Abstract: Atom-photon bound states arise from the coupling of quantum emitters to the band edge of dispersion-engineered waveguides. Thanks to their tunable-range interactions, they are promising building blocks for quantum simulators. Here, we study the dynamics of an atom-photon bound state emerging from coupling a frequency-tunable quantum emitter - a transmon-type superconducting circuit - to the band edge of a microwave metamaterial. Employing precise temporal control over the frequency detuning of the emitter from the band edge, we examine the transition from adiabatic to non-adiabatic behavior in the formation of the bound state and its melting into the propagating modes of the metamaterial. Moreover, we experimentally observe multi-mode emission from the bound state, triggered by a fast change of the emitter's frequency. Our study offers insight into the dynamic preparation of atom-photon bound states and provides a method to characterize their photonic content, with implications in quantum optics and quantum simulation.

Title: Entanglement Hamiltonians and the quasiparticle picture
Authors: Federico Rottoli, Colin Rylands, Pasquale Calabrese
Abstract: The entanglement Hamiltonian (EH) provides the most comprehensive characterization of bipartite entanglement in many-body quantum systems. Ground states of local Hamiltonians inherit this locality, resulting in EHs that are dominated by local, few-body terms. Unfortunately, in non-equilibrium situations, analytic results are rare and largely confined to continuous field theories, which fail to accurately describe microscopic models. To address this gap, we present an analytic result for the EH following a quantum quench in non-interacting fermionic models, valid in the ballistic scaling regime. The derivation adapts the celebrated quasiparticle picture to operators, providing detailed insights into its physical properties. The resulting analytic formula serves as a foundation for engineering EHs in quantum optics experiments.

Title: Anomalous dimensions from conformal field theory: Generalized $ϕ^{2n+1}$ theories
Authors: Yongwei Guo, Wenliang Li
Abstract: We investigate $\phi^{2n+1}$ deformations of the generalized free theory in the $\epsilon$ expansion, where the canonical kinetic term is generalized to a higher-derivative version. For $n=1$, we use the conformal multiplet recombination method to determine the leading anomalous dimensions of the fundamental scalar operator $\phi$ and the bilinear composite operators $\mathcal J$. Then we extend the $n=1$ analysis to the Potts model with $S_{N+1}$ symmetry and its higher-derivative generalization, in which $\phi$ is promoted to an $N$-component field. We further examine the Chew-Frautschi plots and their $N$ dependence. However, for each integer $n>1$, the leading anomalous dimensions of $\phi$ and $ \mathcal{J}$ are not fully determined and contain one unconstrained constant, which in the canonical cases can be fixed by the results from the traditional diagrammatic method. In all cases, we verify that the multiplet-recombination results are consistent with crossing symmetry using the analytic bootstrap methods.

Title: Emergent chirality and superfluidity of parity-doubled baryons in neutron stars
Authors: Shigehiro Yasui, Muneto Nitta, Chihiro Sasaki
Abstract: We propose novel superfluids induced by the parity-doubled baryons. The parity-doubled baryons, i.e., a nucleon $N(940)$ with spin-parity $J^{P}=1/2^{+}$ and an excited nucleon $N^{\ast}(1535)$ with $J^{P}=1/2^{-}$ in vacuum, become degenerate at sufficiently high density where the chiral symmetry is restored. In this study, we extend the conventional $\mathrm{U}(1)$ chiral symmetry to the higher dimensional symmetries, dubbed emergent chiral symmetries, including the naive and mirror assignments as their subgroups. Starting with the Lagrangian up to four-point interactions among the neutron $n$ and its chiral partner $n^{\ast}$, neutral components in $N$ and $N^{\ast}$, in pure neutron matter, we investigate the properties of the ground state with a pairing gap generated by the $n$ and $n^{\ast}$ in the mean-field approximation. We find vector-type condensates that induce the dynamical breaking of a new class of internal symmetries, emergent chiral symmetries, as well as the baryon number and the rotational symmetries of the real space, indicating the appearance of massless Nambu-Goldstone bosons consisting of six quarks: emergent pions, superfluid phonons, and magnons, respectively. We also study the fermionic excitation modes at low-energy scales, and show that they exhibit a spatial anisotropy of the propagation at the Dirac cone in momentum space. Some phenomenological implications are advocated, shedding new light on the properties of neutron stars.

Title: Temporal Bell inequalities in non-relativistic many-body physics
Authors: A. Tononi, M. Lewenstein
Abstract: Analyzing the spreading of information in many-body systems is crucial to understanding their quantum dynamics. At the most fundamental level, this task is accomplished by Bell inequalities, whose violation by quantum mechanics implies that information cannot always be stored locally. While Bell-like inequalities, such as the one of Clauser and Horne, envisage a situation in which two parties perform measurements on systems at different positions, one could formulate temporal inequalities, in which the two parties measure at different times. However, for causally-connected measurement events, these extensions are compatible with a local description, so that no intrinsically-quantum information spreading is involved in such temporal correlations. Here we show that a temporal Clauser-Horne inequality for two spins is violated for a nonzero time interval between the measurements if the two measured parties are connected by a spin chain. Since the chain constitutes the sole medium for the spreading of quantum information, it prevents the immediate vanishing of Bell correlations after the first measurement and it induces violation revivals. The dynamics we analyze shows that, as expected in a non-relativistic setup, the spreading of information is fundamentally limited by the Lieb-Robinson bound. New insights on many-body quantum dynamics could emerge through future applications of our temporal Bell inequality to more general systems.

Title: How Feature Learning Can Improve Neural Scaling Laws
Authors: Blake Bordelon, Alexander Atanasov, Cengiz Pehlevan
Abstract: We develop a solvable model of neural scaling laws beyond the kernel limit. Theoretical analysis of this model shows how performance scales with model size, training time, and the total amount of available data. We identify three scaling regimes corresponding to varying task difficulties: hard, easy, and super easy tasks. For easy and super-easy target functions, which lie in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) defined by the initial infinite-width Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK), the scaling exponents remain unchanged between feature learning and kernel regime models. For hard tasks, defined as those outside the RKHS of the initial NTK, we demonstrate both analytically and empirically that feature learning can improve scaling with training time and compute, nearly doubling the exponent for hard tasks. This leads to a different compute optimal strategy to scale parameters and training time in the feature learning regime. We support our finding that feature learning improves the scaling law for hard tasks but not for easy and super-easy tasks with experiments of nonlinear MLPs fitting functions with power-law Fourier spectra on the circle and CNNs learning vision tasks.

Title: Effects of dissipation in reservoir computing using a spin qubit array
Authors: Shion Mifune, Taro Kanao, Tetsufumi Tanamoto
Abstract: Reservoir computing (RC) is one of the hottest research topic as an application of many physical devices because the device characteristics can be used directly in computing sequences. Quantum RC is also a promising candidate for application in small-number qubit systems. Here, we propose a quantum RC based on the spin qubit system that reflects the status of the spin qubits in experiments comprising a one-dimensional qubit array. Spin qubits are coupled via the Heisenberg interaction, and data sequences are inputted to one of the spin qubits via pulsed rotations. By introducing dissipation, we obtained a relatively good performance in the quantum RC.

Title: Modelling floral and arthropod electrostatics using a two-domain AAA-least squares algorithm
Authors: Samuel J. Harris, Ryan A. Palmer, N. R. McDonald
Abstract: Relationships between plants and insects vitally underpin the health of global ecosystems and food production. Through co-evolution, insects have acquired a variety of senses in response to the emergence of floral cues such as scent, colour and shape. Therefore, the recent discovery of electroreception among terrestrial arthropods motivates the investigation of floral electrics as part of their wider sensory ecology. We examine how a flower's morphology and material properties produce and propagate detectable, ecologically relevant electrical signals in several biologically inspired scenarios. As the electrical field both interior and exterior to the flower must be solved for, we develop an extension of the two-dimensional AAA-least squares algorithm for solving such two-domain electrostatics problems. It is found that the electrical signals produced by the plant can reveal information to the insect about the flower shape, available pollen and the presence of other nearby arthropods. These results show good qualitative agreement with an equivalent three-dimensional scenario, computed using finite element methods. The extension of the AAA-least squares algorithm to two-domain problems provides a fast and accurate method for modelling electrostatic problems, with possible further application in fluid dynamics and magnetostatics. Biologically, our results highlight the significant role floral electrics may play in plant-pollinator and predator-prey relationships, unveiling previously unstudied facets of these key relationships.

Title: Topological Responses of the Standard Model Gauge Group
Authors: Zheyan Wan, Juven Wang, Yi-Zhuang You
Abstract: The local Lie algebra of the Standard Model (SM) is $su(3)\times su(2) \times u(1)$, yet its global gauge group, $G_{{\rm SM}_{\rm q}}=$SU(3)$\times$SU(2)$\times$U(1)/$\mathbb{Z}_{\rm q}$, q$=1,2,3,6$ remains undetermined. Building on previous work on 4d anomalies and 5d cobordism invariants, we classify lower-dimensional invertible field theories (iFTs) or symmetry-protected topological states (SPTs) in 4d, 3d, 2d, and 1d. While the integer SPTs are hard to detect, the fractional SPTs produce measurable topological responses. In particular, the symmetry fractionalization labeled by $k\in\mathbb{Z}_{6/{\rm q}}$ in [arXiv:2411.18160] introduces the symmetry-enriched SM variants, denoted as SM$_{({\rm q},k)}$. We further introduce a new integer $n$ series of baryon-minus-lepton $({\bf B}-{\bf L})$-like U(1) symmetries, $X_n \equiv n (\mathbf{B}-\mathbf{L}) + (1-\frac{n}{N_c})\tilde{Y}$ with electroweak hypercharge $\tilde{Y}$, $n\ge1$, $N_c=3$, where the charge $q_{X_n} = q_{\tilde{Y}} \mod n$. Analyzing the symmetry-enriched SM with 0-form and 1-form symmetries $(G_{[0]}, G_{[1]})$, symmetry-twist group homomorphism $\rho$, and symmetry frationalization obstruction $[\beta]$, their spacetime-internal gauge bundle constraints, and their mixed anomalies, we derive the fractional topological response $\sigma_n({\rm q},k)=\frac{{\rm q}(1-n)\gcd(2,n)}{2n}+\frac{k{\rm q}}{6}\mod1.$ Our $\sigma_n$ response requires more general Spin$^c$ manifolds for odd $n$ and Spin manifolds for even $n$. For a given $n$ (with $n\ge 7$ and $n\ne 10,12,15,30$), $\sigma_n$ uniquely fixes the gauge group parameter q and fractionalization label $k$. Moreover, using pairs such as $(n_1,n_2)=(2,3),(2,5),(3,4),(3,5),(4,5)$, etc. uniquely distinguishes SM$_{({\rm q},k)}$. Our results illuminate the global structure of the SM gauge group via measurable topological responses.

Title: Nonlinear dynamics of air invasion in one-dimensional compliant fluid networks
Authors: Ludovic Jami, François-Xavier Gauci, Céline Cohen, Xavier Noblin, Ludovic Keiser
Abstract: Vascular networks exhibit a remarkable diversity of architectures and transport mechanisms across biological systems. Inspired by embolism propagation in plant xylem - where air invades water-filled conduits under negative pressure - we study air penetration in compliant one-dimensional hydrodynamic networks experiencing mass loss by pervaporation. Using a theoretical framework grounded in biomimetic models, we show that embolism dynamics are shaped by the interplay between network compliance and viscous dissipation. In particular, the competition between two timescales - the pressure diffusion time, $\tau_\mathrm{diff}$, and the pervaporation time, $\tau_\mathrm{pv}$ - governs the emergence of complex, history-dependent behaviors. When these two timescales are comparable, we uncover previously unreported nonlinear feedback between the internal pressure field and the embolism front, leading to transient depressurization and delayed interface motion. These results offer a minimal framework for understanding embolism dynamics in slow-relaxing vascular systems and provide design principles for soft microfluidic circuits with tunable, nonlinear response.

Title: The BPHZL renormalization of a planar quantum electrodynamics up to 2-loops and beyond
Authors: D.O.R. Azevedo, O.M. Del Cima, L.S. Lima, E.S. Miranda
Abstract: The renormalization of a parity-even massless $U(1)\times U(1)$ quantum electrodynamics in three space-time dimensions (QED$_3$) is studied by adopting the Bogoliubov-Parasiuk-Hepp-Zimmermann-Lowenstein (BPHZL) renormalization method. The presence of two massless fermions requires the Lowenstein-Zimmermann (LZ) subtraction scheme to renormalize the infrared divergences induced by the ultraviolet subtractions at 1- and 2-loops, moreover due to the model superrenormalizability the ultraviolet divergences are bounded up to 2-loops. Finally, through the BPHZL renormalization method together with the LZ subtraction scheme the ultraviolet and infrared finiteness of the model is proved up to 2-loops and beyond.

Title: Quantum Signatures of Chaos from Free Probability
Authors: Hugo A. Camargo, Yichao Fu, Viktor Jahnke, Kuntal Pal, Keun-Young Kim
Abstract: A classical dynamical system can be viewed as a probability space equipped with a measure-preserving time evolution map, admitting a purely algebraic formulation in terms of the algebra of bounded functions on the phase space. Similarly, a quantum dynamical system can be formulated using an algebra of bounded operators in a non-commutative probability space equipped with a time evolution map. Chaos, in either setting, can be characterized by statistical independence between observables at $ t = 0 $ and $ t \to \infty $, leading to the vanishing of cumulants involving these observables. In the quantum case, the notion of independence is replaced by free independence, which only emerges in the thermodynamic limit (asymptotic freeness). In this work, we propose a definition of quantum chaos based on asymptotic freeness and investigate its emergence in quantum many-body systems including the mixed-field Ising model with a random magnetic field, a higher spin version of the same model, and the SYK model. The hallmark of asymptotic freeness is the emergence of the free convolution prediction for the spectrum of operators of the form $ A(0) + B(t) $, implying the vanishing of all free cumulants between $A(0)$ and $B(t)$ in the thermodynamic limit for an infinite-temperature thermal state. We systematically investigate the spectral properties of $ A(0) + B(t) $ in the above-mentioned models, show that fluctuations on top of the free convolution prediction follow universal Wigner-Dyson statistics, and discuss the connection with quantum chaos. Finally, we argue that free probability theory provides a rigorous framework for understanding quantum chaos, offering a unifying perspective that connects many different manifestations of it.
