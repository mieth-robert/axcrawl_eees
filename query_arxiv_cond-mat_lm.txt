Title: What is missing from existing Lithium-Sulfur models to capture coin-cell behaviour?
Authors: Miss. Elizabeth Olisa Monica Marinescu
Abstract: Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries offer a promising alternative to current lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries, with a high theoretical energy density, improved safety and high abundance, low cost of materials. For Li-S to reach commercial application, it is essential to understand how the behaviour scales between cell formats; new material development is predominately completed at coin-cell level, whilst pouch-cells will be used for commercial applications. Differences such as reduced electrolyte-to-sulfur (E/S) ratios and increased geometric size at larger cell formats contribute to the behavioural differences, in terms of achievable capacity, cyclability and potential degradation mechanisms. This work focuses on the steps required to capture and test coin-cell behaviour, building upon the existing models within the literature, which predominately focus on pouch-cells. The areas investigated throughout this study, to improve the capability of the model in terms of scaling ability and causality of predictions, include the cathode surface area, precipitation dynamics and C-rate dependence.

Title: Transitional supersolidity in ion doped helium droplets
Authors: Juan Carlos Acosta Matos, Panos Giannakeas, Matteo Ciardi, Thomas Pohl, Jan M. Rost
Abstract: $^4$He nanodroplets doped with an alkali ion feature a snowball of crystallized layers surrounded by superfluid helium. For large droplets, we predict that a transitional supersolid layer can form, bridging between the solid core and the liquid bulk, where the $^4$He density displays modulations of icosahedral group symmetry. To identify the different phases, we combine density functional theory with the semiclassical Gaussian time-dependent Hartree method for localized many-body systems. This hybrid approach can handle large particle numbers and provides insight into the physical origin of the supersolid layer. For small droplets, we verify that the predictions of our approach are in excellent agreement with Path-Integral Monte Carlo calculations.

Title: Quantum phase diagram of the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the square-kagome lattice: a tensor network study
Authors: Saeed S. Jahromi, Yasir Iqbal
Abstract: We assess the quantum phase diagram of the spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnetic model on the square-kagome lattice upon varying the two symmetry inequivalent nearest-neighbor couplings, $J_{1}$ on squares and $J$ on triangles. Employing large-scale tensor network simulations based on infinite projected entangled pair states, we find four distinct valence bond crystal (VBC) states and a ferrimagnetically ordered region. Starting from the limit of weakly interacting squares for small $J/J_{1}$ where a plaquette cross-dimer VBC with long-range singlets is stabilized, we show that with increasing $J/J_{1}$ it transitions to a VBC with resonances over hexagons, the so-called loop-six VBC, which persists across the isotropic point. Interestingly, a generalized version of the pinwheel VBC, earlier reported to be a closely competing state for the isotropic model is energetically stabilized in a sliver of parameter space right beyond the isotropic point. For further increases in $J/J_{1}$, a decorated loop-six VBC occupies an appreciable region of parameter space before transitioning into an imperfect ferrimagnet which finally evolves into a Lieb ferrimagnet. Our characterization of the underlying phases and phase transitions is based on a careful analysis of the energy, magnetization, spin-spin correlations, and bond entanglement entropy.

Title: Geometric Delocalization in Two Dimensions
Authors: Laura Shou, Alireza Parhizkar, Victor Galitski
Abstract: We demonstrate the existence of transient two-dimensional surfaces where a random-walking particle escapes to infinity in contrast to localization in standard flat 2D space. We first prove that any rotationally symmetric 2D membrane embedded in flat 3D space cannot be transient. Then we formulate a criterion for the transience of a general asymmetric 2D membrane. We use it to explicitly construct a class of transient 2D manifolds with a non-trivial metric and height function but ``zero average curvature,'' which we dub tablecloth manifolds. The absence of the logarithmic infrared divergence of the Laplace-Beltrami operator in turn implies the absence of weak localization, non-existence of bound states in shallow potentials, and breakdown of the Mermin-Wagner theorem and Kosterlitz-Thouless transition on the tablecloth manifolds, which may be realizable in both quantum simulators and corrugated two-dimensional materials.

Title: Exact Chiral Symmetries of 3+1D Hamiltonian Lattice Fermions
Authors: Lei Gioia, Ryan Thorngren
Abstract: We construct Hamiltonian models on a 3+1d cubic lattice for a single Weyl fermion and for a single Weyl doublet protected by exact (as opposed to emergent) chiral symmetries. In the former, we find a not-on-site, non-compact chiral symmetry which can be viewed as a Hamiltonian analog of the Ginsparg-Wilson symmetry in Euclidean lattice models of Weyl fermions. In the latter, we combine an on-site $U(1)$ symmetry with a not-on-site $U(1)$ symmetry, which together generate the $SU(2)$ flavor symmetry of the doublet at low energies, while in the UV they generate an algebra known in integrability as the Onsager algebra. This latter model is in fact the celebrated magnetic Weyl semimetal which is known to have a chiral anomaly from the action of $U(1)$ and crystalline translation, that gives rise to an anomalous Hall response - however reinterpreted in our language, it has two exact $U(1)$ symmetries that gives rise to the global $SU(2)$ anomaly which protects the gaplessness even when crystalline translations are broken. We also construct an exact symmetry-protected single Dirac cone in 2+1d with the $U(1) \rtimes T$ parity anomaly. Our constructions evade both old and recently-proven no-go theorems by using not-on-siteness in a crucial way, showing our results are sharp.

Title: Purely Electronic Model for Exciton-Polaron Formation in Moiré Heterostructures
Authors: Fabian Pichler, Mohammad Hafezi, Michael Knap
Abstract: Understanding interactions between excitons and correlated electronic states presents a fundamental challenge in quantum many-body physics. Here, we introduce a purely electronic model for the formation of exciton-polarons in moiré lattices. Unlike conventional approaches that treat excitons as tightly-bound bosonic particles, our model considers only electronic degrees of freedom, describing excitons as electron-hole bound states. Our findings reveal a pronounced renormalization of the polaron mass as a function of electron density, particularly near correlated insulators, consistent with recent transport experiments. Additionally, we predict an observable sign change in the effective polaron mass when increasing the electron density that can be measured in Hall-type experiments. Our purely electronic model provides a unified framework to investigate the formation and renormalization of exciton-polarons in correlated states.

Title: Robustness of Vacancy-Bound Non-Abelian Anyons in the Kitaev Model in a Magnetic Field
Authors: Bo Xiao, Gonzalo Alvarez, Gábor Halász
Abstract: The search for non-Abelian anyons in quantum spin liquids (QSLs) is crucial for advancing fault-tolerant topological quantum computation. In the exactly solvable Kitaev honeycomb model, nonmagnetic spin vacancies are known to bind emergent gauge fluxes of the QSL ground state, which in turn become non-Abelian anyons for an infinitesimal magnetic field. Here, we investigate how this approach for stabilizing non-Abelian anyons at spin vacancies extends to a finite magnetic field represented by a proper Zeeman term. Specifically, we use large-scale density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations to compute the vacancy-anyon binding energy as a function of magnetic field for both the ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) Kitaev models. We find that, while the inclusion of the field weakens anyon binding in both cases, there is a pronounced difference in the finite-field behavior; the binding energy remains finite within the entire QSL phase for the FM Kitaev model but approaches zero already inside this phase for the AFM Kitaev model. To reliably compute a very small binding energy that is three orders of magnitude below the magnetic interaction strength, we also introduce a refined definition for the binding energy and an extrapolation scheme for its accurate extraction through exclusively ground-state properties using DMRG.

Title: Majorana polarization in disordered heterostructures
Authors: Shubhanshu Karoliya, Sumanta Tewari, Gargee Sharma
Abstract: Recent studies propose Majorana polarization (MP) as a tool for identifying topological Majorana bound states (MBS). We analyze MP in two systems: a one-dimensional (1d) semiconducting nanowire and a finite-size graphene strip, both with Rashba spin-orbit coupling, proximity-induced superconductivity, and disorder. While MP reflects topological features, it does not always distinguish true MBS from partially separated Andreev bound states (psABS) or quasi-Majorana modes. True MBS are expected to satisfy $\mathcal{P}^\mathrm{left} \cdot \mathcal{P}^\mathrm{right} \sim -1$, but two additional criteria - a topological bandgap and edge-localized wavefunctions - are also necessary for their identification and use in topological quantum computation (TQC). We highlight cases where the polarization product condition holds without meeting these extra requirements. In finite graphene strips, disorder blurs the complex topological phase diagram, with isolated regions showing $\mathcal{P}^\mathrm{right}\approx-\mathcal{P}^\mathrm{left}$ and $|\mathcal{P}^\mathrm{left}|\gtrsim \frac{1}{2}$. Even here, MP alone cannot reliably distinguish true MBS from quasi-Majorana or trivial states. Robust MBS identification for TQC demands combining MP with energy spectra and wavefunction localization, especially in disordered systems.

Title: The Low-Temperature Phenomenology of Gap Inhomogeneity in the Cuprate Superconductors: High-Energy Granularity, Low-Energy Homogeneity, and Spectral Kinks
Authors: Miguel Antonio Sulangi
Abstract: Scanning tunneling spectroscopy experiments on a number of cuprate superconductors have revealed that these materials are highly inhomogeneous. However, even though this inhomogeneity is well-characterized experimentally, a theoretical understanding of the effect of an inhomogeneous superconducting $d$-wave order parameter on various observables is still not complete. Here, we focus on the particular role played by the length scale of superconducting order-parameter inhomogeneity. We make use of a model involving square patches tiling the system, with each patch hosting a broadly distributed random value of the $d$-wave parameter. By using large-scale simulations, we are able to study how the size of the patches affects the correspondence between various measures of the superconducting gap and the underlying order parameter. If the length scale of the inhomogeneity is smaller than the average superconducting coherence length, the resulting $d$-wave superconductor is homogeneous. However, when the order parameter varies on the scale of the coherence length, we find the emergence of a striking low-/high-energy dichotomy, in which the low-energy regime is homogeneous while the high-energy states are strongly inhomogeneous. Kinks in the local spectra are found at the energy demarcating the homogeneous-inhomogeneous transition. We also observe that the gap extracted from the low-energy slope of the LDOS is extremely uniform. We find in both of these regimes that the distribution of the spectral gap is narrower than that of the order parameter; these start to match only when the size of the patches becomes parametrically larger than the coherence length. We comment on the applicability of these results to the cuprates, discuss the limitations of the inhomogeneous $d$-wave model, and point out where beyond-mean-field correlation effects are likely to be present in addition to inhomogeneity.

Title: Untwisted and Twisted Rényi Negativities: Toward a Rényi Proxy for Logarithmic Negativity in Fermionic Systems
Authors: Fo-Hong Wang, Xiao Yan Xu
Abstract: Entanglement entropy is a fundamental measure of quantum entanglement for pure states, but for large-scale many-body systems, Rényi entanglement entropy is much more computationally accessible. For mixed states, logarithmic negativity (LN) serves as a widely used entanglement measure, but its direct computation is often intractable, leaving Rényi negativity (RN) as the practical alternative. In fermionic systems, RN is further classified into untwisted and twisted types, depending on the definition of the fermionic partial transpose. However, which of these serves as the true Rényi proxy for LN has remained unclear -- until now. In this work, we address this question by developing a robust quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) method to compute both untwisted and twisted RNs, focusing on the rank-4 twisted RN, where non-trivial behavior emerges. We identify and overcome two major challenges: the singularity of the Green's function matrix and the exponentially large variance of RN estimators. Our method is demonstrated in the Hubbard model and the spinless $t$-$V$ model, revealing critical distinctions between untwisted and twisted RNs, as well as between rank-2 and high-rank RNs. Remarkably, we find that the twisted Rényi negativity ratio (RNR) adheres to the area law and decreases monotonically with temperature, in contrast to the untwisted RNR but consistent with prior studies of bosonic systems. This study not only establishes the twisted RNR as a more pertinent Rényi proxy for LN in fermionic systems but also provides comprehensive technical details for the stable and efficient computation of high-rank RNs. Our work lays the foundation for future studies of mixed-state entanglement in large-scale fermionic many-body systems.

Title: Critical behavior of a programmable time-crystal lattice gas
Authors: R. Hurtado-Gutiérrez, C. Pérez-Espigares, P.I. Hurtado
Abstract: Time crystals are many-body systems whose ground state spontaneously breaks time-translation symmetry and thus exhibits long-range spatiotemporal order and robust periodic motion. Using hydrodynamics, we have recently shown how an $m$th-order external packing field coupled to density fluctuations in driven diffusive fluids can induce the spontaneous emergence of time-crystalline order in the form of $m$ rotating condensates, which can be further controlled and modulated. Here we analyze this phenomenon at the microscopic level in a paradigmatic model of particle diffusion under exclusion interactions, a generalization of the weakly asymmetric simple exclusion process with a configuration-dependent field called the time-crystal lattice gas. Using extensive Monte Carlo simulations, we characterize the nonequilibrium phase transition to these complex time-crystal phases for different values of $m$, including the order parameter, the susceptibility and the Binder cumulant, from which we measure the critical exponents, which turn out to be within the Kuramoto universality class for oscillator synchronization. We also elucidate the condensates density profiles and velocities, confirming along the way a scaling property predicted for the higher-order condensate shapes in terms of first-order ones, discussing also novel possibilities for this promising route to time crystals.

Title: Andreev versus Tunneling Spectroscopy of Unconventional Flat Band Superconductors
Authors: Sayak Biswas, Saurav Suman, Mohit Randeria, Rajdeep Sensarma
Abstract: STM experiments in the tunneling and Andreev regimes on graphene-based moire superconductors (SC) show two distinct energy scales whose origin is mysterious. We express the conductance of a normal-SC interface in terms of Green's functions, which allows us to sharpen the issues in two ways. First, we show that the two distinct energy scales cannot be understood in terms of a pseudogap in tunneling and a superconducting gap in the Andreev spectra. Second, the large Fermi velocity vF mismatch between the STM tip and the at band SC renormalizes a transparent interface towards the tunneling regime, and the ballistic Andreev regime cannot be realized in moire SCs. We also discuss self energy corrections to vF that determines the conductance. Finally, we offer a resolution to these problems by modeling the Andreev experiment as a circular metallic disc embedded in an unconventional SC. We show that with strong vF mismatch the low bias conductance is dominated by Andreev bound states induced by the tip at the interface with the unconventional SC. The ABS give rise to the low energy scale seen in Andreev experiments, smaller than the SC gap in tunneling spectroscopy.

Title: Constraints from anti-unitary symmetries on phase diagrams of sign problem-free models
Authors: Xu Zhang, Nick Bultinck
Abstract: A powerful way to guarantee the absence of a sign problem in determinantal quantum Monte Carlo simulations is imposing a particular type of anti-unitary symmetries. It is shown that these same symmetries give rise to constraints on correlation functions, which can be used to identify local operators whose correlations upper bound those of a large class of physically relevant operators, including for example superconducting order parameters. Our results also help understand why it is difficult to realize generic finite-momentum orders in sign problem-free models.

Title: BCS-like formula for $T_c$ does not necessarily imply BCS pairing mechanism
Authors: Yuxuan Wang, Andrey V. Chubukov
Abstract: In the BCS theory of superconductivity, an instability towards pairing develops at arbitrary weak dimensionless coupling $\lambda$ due to a divergence of logarithmic perturbative series for the pairing susceptibility (Cooper logarithms) at $T_c \sim \omega_0 e^{-1/\lambda}$, where $\omega_0$ is an energy cutoff. On the contrary, in many models of superconductivity out of a non-Fermi liquid, Cooper logarithm is absent and superconductivity emerges only when $\lambda$ exceeds a certain threshold. We argue that there are situations when there is no threshold and at weak coupling the formula for $T_c$ is BCS-like, yet the origin of the pairing instability is fundamentally different from that in the BCS scenario. As an example, we revisit superconductivity in a metal at the onset of $(\pi,\pi)$ spin-density-wave order. Earlier studies of this problem found no threshold and a BCS-like expression for $T_c$ at weak coupling. We argue that, despite this, the pairing is not caused by the Cooper logarithm and in many respects is qualitatively similar to that in non-Fermi liquids.

Title: Heat-to-motion conversion for quantum active matter
Authors: Alexander-Georg Penner, Ludmila Viotti, Rosario Fazio, Liliana Arrachea, Felix von Oppen
Abstract: We introduce a model of an active quantum particle and discuss its properties. The particle has a set of internal states that mediate exchanges of heat with external reservoirs. Heat is then converted into motion by means of a spin-orbit term that couples internal and translational degrees of freedom. The quantum features of the active particle manifest both in the motion and in the heat-to-motion conversion. Furthermore, the stochastic nature of heat exchanges impacts the motion of the active particle and fluctuations can be orders of magnitude larger than the average values. The combination of spin-orbit interaction under nonequilibrium driving may bring active matter into the realm of cold atomic gases where our proposal can be implemented.

Title: Ab initio thermal conductivity of Ge$_x$Sn$_{1-x}$O$_2$ alloys
Authors: Xiao Zhang, Emmanouil Kioupakis
Abstract: Rutile GeO2 is an emerging ultra-wide band gap semiconductor (UWBG) that has demonstrated excellent potential for applications in power electronic devices. Alloys of rutile SnO2, a well-established UWBG semiconducting oxide, with GeO2 are promising for tuning the material properties for applications. The thermal conductivity, in particular, is a key property which is significantly impacted by alloy disorder, but which is also essential in assessing the operation and degradation of materials in high-power electronic applications. Here, we present first-principles calculations of the thermal conductivity of rutile GeO2, SnO2, and their alloys, and quantify the effects of scattering by alloy disorder, temperature, and isotope mass distribution. We show that the relatively high thermal conductivity of the binary compounds is reduced by alloying, grain boundaries, and isotope disorder. However, we also find that the room-temperature thermal conductivity of the alloys is still comparable to or surpasses the values for beta-Ga2O3, an established UWBG semiconducting oxide. Our findings provide a roadmap for the codesign of the thermal properties of rutile GexSn1-xO2 alloys for electronic device applications.

Title: Path-dependency and emergent computing under vectorial driving
Authors: Colin M. Meulblok, Amitesh Singh, Matthieu Labousse, Martin van Hecke
Abstract: The sequential response of frustrated materials - ranging from crumpled sheets and amorphous media to metamaterials - reveals their memory effects and emergent computational potential. Despite their spatial extension, most studies rely on a single global stimulus, such as compression, effectively reducing the problem to scalar driving. Here, we introduce vectorial driving by applying multiple spatially localized stimuli to explore path-dependent, sequential responses. We uncover a wealth of phenomena absent in scalar driving, including non-Abelian responses, mixed-mode behavior, and chiral loop transients. We find that such path dependencies arise from elementary motifs linked to fold singularities, which connect triplets of states - ancestor, descendant, and sibling; and develop a general framework using pt-graphs to describe responses under any vectorial driving protocol. Leveraging binarized vectorial driving, we establish a natural connection to computation, showing that a single sample can encode multiple sequential Boolean circuits, which are selectable by driving strength and reprogrammable via additional inputs. Finally, we introduce graph-based motifs to manage the complexity of high-dimensional driving. Our work paves the way for strategies to explore, harness, and understand complex materials and memory, while advancing embodied intelligence and in-materia computing.

Title: Effect of imaginary gauge on wave transport in driven-dissipative systems
Authors: I. Komis, K. G. Makris, K. Busch, R. El-Ganainy
Abstract: Wave transport in disordered media is a fundamental problem with direct implications in condensed matter, materials science, optics, atomic physics, and even biology. The majority of studies are focused on Hermitian systems to understand disorder-induced localization. However, recent studies of non-Hermitian disordered media have revealed unique behaviors, with a universal principle emerging that links the eigenvalue spectrum of the disordered Hamiltonian and its statistics with its transport properties. In this work we show that the situation can be very different in driven-dissipative lattices of cavities, where a uniform gain applied equally to all the components of the system can act as a knob for controlling the wave transport properties without altering the eigenvalue statistics of the underlying Hamiltonian. Our results open a new avenue for developing a deeper insight into the transport properties in disordered media and will aid in building new devices as well. Our work which is presented in the context of optics generalizes to any physical platforms where gain can be implemented. These include acoustics, electronics, and coupled quantum oscillators such as atoms, diamond centers and superconducting qubits.

Title: Diffusive hydrodynamics of hard rods from microscopics
Authors: Friedrich Hübner, Leonardo Biagetti, Jacopo De Nardis, Benjamin Doyon
Abstract: We derive exact equations governing the large-scale dynamics of hard rods, including diffusive effects that go beyond ballistic transport. Diffusive corrections are the first-order terms in the hydrodynamic gradient expansion and we obtain them through an explicit microscopic calculation of the dynamics of hard rods. We show that they differ significantly from the prediction of Navier-Stokes hydrodynamics, as the correct hydrodynamics description is instead given by two coupled equations, giving respectively the evolution of the one point functions and of the connected two-point correlations. The resulting equations are time-reversible and reduce to the usual Navier-Stokes hydrodynamic equations in the limit of near-equilibrium evolution. This represents the first exact microscopic calculation showing how ballistic dynamics generates long-range correlations, in agreement with general results from the recently developed ballistic macroscopic fluctuation theory, and showing how such long range-correlations directly affect the diffusive hydrodynamic terms, in agreement with, and clarifying, recent related results.

Title: Computational study of indium oxide photoelectrodes
Authors: Matthew Bousquet, Jiawei Zhan, Chunxin Luo, Alex B. Martinson, Francois Gygi, Giulia Galli
Abstract: Using a combination of first principles molecular dynamics simulations (FPMD) and electronic structure calculations, we characterize the atomistic structure and vibrational properties of a photocatalytic surface of In$_2$O$_3$, a promising photoelectrode for the production of hydrogen peroxide. We then investigate the surface in contact with water and show that the electronic states of In$_2$O$_3$ are appropriately positioned in energy to facilitate the two-electron water oxidation reaction (WOR) over the competing four-electron oxygen evolution reaction. We further propose that the use of strained thin films interfaced with water is beneficial in decreasing the optical gap of In$_2$O$_3$ and thus utilizing a wider portion of the solar spectrum for the WOR.

Title: Topological mechanical neural networks as classifiers through in situ backpropagation learning
Authors: Shuaifeng Li, Xiaoming Mao
Abstract: Recently, a new frontier in computing has emerged with physical neural networks(PNNs) harnessing intrinsic physical processes for learning. Here, we explore topological mechanical neural networks(TMNNs) inspired by the quantum spin Hall effect(QSHE) in topological metamaterials, for machine learning classification tasks. TMNNs utilize pseudospin states and the robustness of the QSHE, making them damage-tolerant for binary classification. We first demonstrate data clustering using untrained TMNNs. Then, for specific tasks, we derive an in situ backpropagation algorithm - a two-step, local-rule method that updates TMNNs using only local information, enabling in situ physical learning. TMNNs achieve high accuracy in classifications of Iris flowers, Penguins, and Seeds while maintaining robustness against bond pruning. Furthermore, we demonstrate parallel classification via frequency-division multiplexing, assigning different tasks to distinct frequencies for enhanced efficiency. Our work introduces in situ backpropagation for wave-based mechanical neural networks and positions TMNNs as promising neuromorphic computing hardware for classification tasks.

Title: Effect of the Coulomb repulsion and oxygen level on charge distribution and superconductivity in the Emery model for cuprates superconductors
Authors: Louis-Bernard St-Cyr, David Sénéchal
Abstract: The Emery model (aka the three-band Hubbard model) offers a simplified description of the copper-oxide planes that form the building blocks of high-temperature superconductors. By contrast with the even simpler one-band Hubbard model, it differentiates between copper and oxygen orbitals and thus between oxygen occupation ($n_p$) and copper occupation ($n_d$). Here we demonstrate, using cluster dynamical mean field theory, how the two occupations are related to the on-site Coulomb repulsion $U$ on the copper orbital and to the energy difference $\epsilon_p$ between oxygen and copper orbitals. Since the occupations ($n_p$ and $n_d$) have been estimated from NMR for a few materials (LCO, YBCO and NCCO), this allows us to estimate the value of $U-\epsilon_p$ for these materials, within this model. We compute the density of states for these and the effect of $(U,\epsilon_p)$ on the $n_d$-$n_p$ curve, superconductivity, and antiferromagnetism.

Title: Catenary-like rippled biphenylene/graphene lateral heterojunction
Authors: Victor M. S. da C. Dias, Danilo de P. Kuritza, Igor S. S. de Oliveira, Jose E. Padilha, Roberto H. Miwa
Abstract: In this study, we conduct a first-principles analysis to explore the structural and electronic properties of curved biphenylene/graphene lateral junctions (BPN/G). We start our investigation focusing on the energetic stability of BPN/G by varying the width of the graphene region, BPN/Gn. The electronic structure of BPN/Gn reveals (i) the formation of metallic channels mostly localized along the BPN stripes, where (ii) the features of the energy bands near the Fermi level are ruled by the width (n) of the graphene regions, Gn. In the sequence, we find that the hydrogenation of BPN/Gn results in a semiconductor system with a catenary-like rippled geometry. The electronic states of the hydrogenated system are mainly confined in the curved Gn regions, and the dependence of the bandgap on the width of Gn is similar to that of hydrogenated armchair graphene nanoribbons. The effects of curvature on the electronic structure, analyzed in terms of external mechanical strain, revealed that the increase/decrease of the band gap is also dictated by the width of the Gn region. Further electronic transport calculations reveal a combination of strong transmission anisotropy and the emergence of negative differential resistance. Based on these findings, we believe that rippled biphenylene/graphene systems can be useful for the design of two-dimensional nanodevices.

Title: Orbital Longitudinal Magneto-electric Coupling in Multilayer Graphene
Authors: Jin-Xin Hu, Justin C. W. Song
Abstract: Magneto-electric coupling enables the manipulation of magnetization by electric fields and vice versa. While typically found in heavy element materials with large spin-orbit coupling, recent experiments on rhombohedral-stacked pentalayer graphene (RPG) have demonstrated a {\it longitudinal magneto-electric coupling} (LMC) without spin-orbit coupling. Here we present a microscopic theory of LMC in multilayer graphene and identify how it is controlled by a ``layer-space'' quantum geometry and interaction-driven valley polarization. Strikingly, we find that the interplay between valley-polarized order and LMC produces a butterfly shaped magnetic hysteresis controlled by out-of-plane electric field: a signature of LMC and a multiferroic valley order. Furthermore, we identify a nonlinear LMC in multilayer graphene under time-reversal symmetry, while the absence of centrosymmetry enables the generation of a second-order nonlinear electric dipole moment in response to an out-of-plane magnetic field. Our theoretical framework provides a quantitative understanding of LMC, as well as the emergent magneto-electric properties of multilayer graphene.

Title: Directional Locking and Hysteresis in Stripe and Bubble Forming Systems on One-Dimensional Periodic Substrates with a Rotating Drive
Authors: C. Reichhardt, C.J.O. Reichhardt
Abstract: We examine the dynamics of a two-dimensional stripe, bubble, and crystal forming system interacting with a periodic one-dimensional substrate under an applied drive that is rotated with respect to the substrate periodicity direction $x$. We find that the stripes remain strongly directionally locked to the $x$ direction for an extended range of drives before undergoing motion parallel to the drive. In some cases, the stripes break apart at the unlocking transition, but can dynamically reform into stripes aligned perpendicular to the $x$ direction, producing hysteresis in the directional locking and unlocking transitions. In contrast, moving anisotropic crystal and bubble phases exhibit weaker directional locking and reduced or no hysteresis. The hysteresis occurs in regimes where the particle rearrangements occur and is most pronounced near the stripe phase. We also show that for varied substrate strength, substrate spacing, and particle density, a number of novel dynamical patterns can form that include a combination of stripe, bubble, and crystal morphologies.

Title: Tuning the Size and Stiffness of Inflatable Particles
Authors: Nidhi Pashine, Dong Wang, Robert Baines, Medha Goyal, Mark D. Shattuck, Corey S. O'Hern, Rebecca Kramer-Bottiglio
Abstract: We describe size-varying cylindrical particles made from silicone elastomers that can serve as building blocks for robotic granular materials. The particle size variation, which is achieved by inflation, gives rise to changes in stiffness under compression. We design and fabricate inflatable particles that can become stiffer or softer during inflation, depending on key parameters of the particle geometry, such as the ratio of the fillet radius to the wall thickness, r/t. We also conduct numerical simulations of the inflatable particles and show that they only soften during inflation when localization of large strains occurs in the regime r/t -> 0. This work introduces novel particle systems with tunable size and stiffness that can be implemented in numerous soft robotic applications.

Title: Semiconducting character in Ruddlesden-Popper bilayer nickelate Y$_{0.5}$Sr$_{2.5}$Ni$_{2-x}$Al$_{x}$O$_7$
Authors: H. Yilmaz, P. Sosa-Lizama, M. Knauft, K. Küster, U. Starke, M. Isobe, O. Clemens, P. A. van Aken, Y. E. Suyolcu, P. Puphal
Abstract: With the discovery of superconductivity under pressure in the Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) bilayer La$_3$Ni$^{2.5+}_2$O$_7$ and trilayer La$_4$Ni$^{2.66+}_3$O$_{10}$, a new field of nickelate superconductors opened up. In this respect, Sr-Ni-O RP-type phases represent alternative systems that exist with partial cation substitution. We demonstrate that by Y-doping in Sr$_{3}$Ni$_{2-x}$Al$_{x}$O$_7$ (SNAO), as Y$_{y}$Sr$_{3-y}$Ni$_{2-x}$Al$_{x}$O$_7$ (YSNAO), the drawback of an insulating ground state is overcome, and a significant decrease in resistivity is achieved with crystals exhibiting semiconducting behavior. Using extensive diffraction and spectroscopy, as well as transport and magnetization measurements, the structural, chemical, electrical, and magnetic properties of the as-grown and reduced compounds were investigated. In the Al-free growth, a known $n=1$ RP system with Sr$_{1.66}$Y$_{0.33}$NiO$_{4-\delta}$, from which the first single crystals were obtained, was further confirmed, opening the door for future exploration of \textit{A}-site substituted RP-type phases without Ni-site disorder.

Abstract: High-entropy oxide (HEO) thermodynamics transcend temperature-centric approaches, spanning a multidimensional landscape where oxygen chemical potential plays a decisive role. Here, we experimentally demonstrate how controlling the oxygen chemical potential coerces multivalent cations into divalent states in rock salt HEOs. We construct a preferred valence phase diagram based on thermodynamic stability and equilibrium analysis, alongside a high throughput enthalpic stability map derived from atomistic calculations leveraging machine learning interatomic potentials. We identify and synthesize seven equimolar single-phase rock salt compositions that accommodate multivalent Mn, Fe, or both, as confirmed by X-ray diffraction and fluorescence. X-ray absorption fine structure spectra reveal predominantly divalent cations. Ultimately, we introduce oxygen chemical potential overlap as a key complementary descriptor predicting HEO stability and synthesizability. Although we focus on rock salt HEOs, our methods are chemically and structurally agnostic, providing a broadly adaptable framework for navigating HEOs thermodynamics and enabling a broader compositional range with contemporary property interest.

Authors: Yoshiaki Uchida, Go Watanabe
Abstract: This study explores the mechanisms behind the helical structures in cholesteric liquid crystalline (CLC) phases using molecular dynamics simulations. By adding chiral agents to the nematic liquid crystalline (NLC) compound, 5CB, the research examines how the shape and motion chirality of the agents influence the overall twisting behavior. The results show that chiral agents induce shape chirality in the 5CB molecules, but dynamic chirality is not detectable at this stage. The study suggests that equilibrium is required for motion chirality to become evident, highlighting the need for further investigation.

Title: Geometry-Driven Moiré Engineering in Twisted Bilayers of High-Pseudospin Fermions
Authors: Yi-Chun Hung, Xiaoting Zhou, Arun Bansil
Abstract: Moiré engineering offers new pathways for manipulating emergent states in twisted layered materials and lattice-mismatched heterostructures. With the key role of the geometry of the underlying lattice in mind, here we introduce the watermill lattice, a two-dimensional structure with low-energy states characterized by massless pseudospin-3/2 fermions with high winding numbers. Its twisted bilayer is shown to exhibit magic angles, where four isolated flat bands emerge around the Fermi level, featuring elevated Wilson-loop windings and enhanced quantum geometric effects, such as an increase in the ratio of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition temperature to the mean-field critical temperature under a weak Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) pairing. We discuss how the watermill lattice could be realized in the MXene and group-IV materials. Our study highlights the potential of exploiting lattice geometry in moiré engineering to uncover novel quantum phenomena and tailor emergent electronic properties in materials.

Title: Surface Chemistry-Driven Oxidation Mechanisms in Ti$_{\text{3}}$C$_{\text{2}}$T$_{\textit{x}}$ MXenes
Authors: Bradlee J. McIntosh, Bence G. Márkus, Anna Nyáry, Ferenc Simon, László Forró, Dávid Beke
Abstract: Ti$_3$C$_2$T$_x$ is a leading compound within the MXenes family and can find host in widespread applications. It is synthesized by selectively etching layers from the Ti$_3$AlC$_2$ precursor, and this process typically introduces surface terminations, T$_x$, such as $-$OH, $=$O, or $-$F. However, the aggressive chemical conditions required for its preparation, as well as exposure to air, humidity, and heat, can lead to impurity phases that potentially compromise its desirable properties. We reveal a two-step oxidation process during heat treatment, where initial oxidation occurs between layers without altering the integrity of the Ti$_3$C$_2$ layered structure, followed by the formation of anatase TiO$_2$ at elevated temperatures. The process was carefully monitored using \emph{in situ} Raman spectroscopy and \emph{in situ} microwave conductivity measurements, employed to Ti$_3$C$_2$T$_x$ prepared using various etching techniques involving concentrated HF, LiF + HCl, and HF + HCl mixtures. The oxidation process is heavily influenced by the synthesis route and surface chemistry of Ti$_3$C$_2$T$_x$, with fluoride and oxyfluoride groups playing a pivotal role in stabilizing the anatase phase. The absence of these groups, in contrast, can lead to the formation of rutile TiO$_2$.

Title: Unprecedented Spin-Lifetime of Itinerant Electrons in Natural Graphite Crystals
Authors: Bence G. Márkus, Dávid Beke, Lili Vajtai, András Jánossy, László Forró, Ferenc Simon
Abstract: A long spin-lifetime of electrons is the holy grail of spintronics, a field exploiting the electron angular momentum as information carrier and storage unit. Previous reports indicated a spin lifetime, $\tau_{\text{s}}$ near $10$ ns at best in graphene-based devices at low temperatures. We detail the observation of $\tau_{\text{s}}$ approaching the ultralong $1{,}000$~ns at room temperature in natural graphite crystals using magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The relaxation time shows a giant anisotropy: the lifetime of spins, polarized perpendicular to the graphite plane, is more than $50$ times longer than for the in-plane polarization. The temperature dependence of $\tau_{\text{s}}$ proves that diffusion of spins to the crystallite edges, where relaxation occurs, limits the lifetime. This suggests that graphite is an excellent candidate for spintronic applications, seamlessly integrating with emerging 2D van der Waals technologies.

Title: Magnetic phases and electron-phonon coupling in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure
Authors: Cong Zhu, Bin Li, Yuxiang Fan, Chuanhui Yin, Junjie Zhai, Jie Cheng, Shengli Liu, Zhixiang Shi
Abstract: Motivated by recent reports of pressure-induced superconductivity in bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, we present a comprehensive investigation into the structural, electronic, magnetic, and phonon properties of this compound across a pressure range of 0 to 29.5 GPa. DFT+U calculations reveal that the A-type antiferromagnetic ground state of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ persists throughout the studied pressure range. Electronic structure analysis shows that the Ni-$d_{xy}$ and Ni-$d_{z^2}$ orbitals dominate near the Fermi level in both the $Fmmm$ and $Amam$ phases of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Phonon dispersion calculations for the $Fmmm$ phase reveal no imaginary modes from 12 to 29.5 GPa, confirming its dynamical stability in this pressure range. The vibrational frequencies of O atoms are substantially higher than those of Ni and La atoms, primarily due to the lower mass of oxygen. At 29.5 GPa, the electron-phonon coupling constant $\lambda$ for the $Fmmm$ phase is calculated to be 0.13. This small value suggests that conventional electron-phonon coupling is insufficient to explain the reported superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, indicating a potentially unconventional mechanism. The study offers nuanced, actionable insights that can strategically inform and direct subsequent experimental investigations into the design and optimization of nickel-based superconducting materials.

Title: Kagome goldene with flat bands and Dirac nodal line fermions via line-graph epitaxy
Authors: Qiwei Tian, Sahar Izadi Vishkayi, Chen Zhang, Jiang Zeng, Bo Li, Li Zhang, Long-Jing Yin, Yuan Tian, Meysam Bagheri Tagani, Lijie Zhang, Zhihui Qin
Abstract: The kagome lattice is a promising platform for exploring exotic quantum phases. However, achieving a single-atomic-layer kagome lattice in elemental materials has remained a significant challenge. Here we introduce line-graph epitaxy, a novel approach that enables the synthesis of single-atomic-layer goldene with a kagome lattice. Through scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS), alongside density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we provide direct evidence of kagome goldene, which exhibits a flat band with a van Hove singularity approximately 1.1 eV below the Fermi level, indicative of strong electron correlation effects. Notably, the flat band breaks down at the zigzag edges of the goldene nanoflakes, underlining the role of edge effects. Additionally, our calculations reveal that weak interlayer interactions between goldene and the Au$_2$Ge substrate give rise to dual Dirac nodal lines due to a proximity effect. These findings offer a strategy for constructing elemental kagome lattices and provide a generalizable approach for fabricating and controlling line-graph materials. This work paves the way for exploring quantum phases driven by strong correlations and designing materials for quantum technologies.

Title: Spin supercurrent in parity mixed superconductors with structural chirality
Authors: Keito Hara, Youichi Yanase
Abstract: Chiral materials exhibit a spin filtering effect, so-called chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS). A recent observation of spin accumulation at the ends of a chiral-structured superconductor has opened up a new pathway for studying the CISS effect in superconductors. In chiral-structured superconductors, the admixture of the spin-singlet and spin-triplet order parameters significantly influences the properties of superconductivity. In this paper, we investigate the interplay between the superconducting order parameter and supercurrent-induced spin current, namely, the superconducting CISS effect. In weakly party-mixed superconductors, the spin current, which is predominantly temperature-independent, is carried by spin-polarized Cooper pairs with finite center-of-mass momentum. In contrast, in strongly party-mixed superconductors the temperature-dependent spin current is also carried by electrons with opposite momentum and antiparallel spins forming a Cooper pair. Chiral-structured superconductors will offer a novel platform for exploring the CISS effect and may provide deeper insights into its underlying mechanisms related to the parity-mixed order parameter.

Title: Symmetry and Minimal Hamiltonian of Nonsymmorphic Collinear Antiferromagnet MnTe
Authors: Koichiro Takahashi, Hong-Fei Huang, Jie-Xiang Yu, Jiadong Zang
Abstract: $\alpha$-MnTe, an $A$-type collinear antiferromagnet, has recently attracted significant attention due to its pronounced spin splitting despite having net zero magnetization, a phenomenon unique for a new class of magnetism dubbed altermagnetism. In this work, we develop a minimal effective Hamiltonian for $\alpha$-MnTe based on realistic orbitals near the Fermi level at both the $\Gamma$ and $A$ points. Our model is derived using group representation theory, first-principles calculations, and tight-binding modeling. The resulting effective Hamiltonian exhibits qualitatively distinct electron transport characteristics between these high-symmetry points and for different in-plane Néel vector orientations along the $[11\bar{2}0]$ and $[1\bar{1}00]$ directions. Although relativistic correction of the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is believed to be not important in altermagnets, we show the dominant role of SOC in the spin splitting and valence electrons of MnTe. These findings provide critical insights into altermagnetic electron transport in MnTe and establish a model playground for future theoretical and experimental studies.

Title: Orbital Magnetization as the Origin of the Nonlinear Hall Effect and Its Implications
Authors: Zesheng Zhang, Xin-Zhi Li, Wen-Yu He
Abstract: The nonlinear Hall effect is a new type of Hall effect that has recently attracted significant attention. For the physical origin of the nonlinear Hall effect, while orbital magnetization has long been hypothesized to underpin the nonlinear Hall effect, quantitative connections between the two remain elusive. Here, we resolve the problem by deriving the first explicit formula connecting the electric field induced orbital magnetization to the second order nonlinear Hall conductivity. Our theory reveals that the applied electric field plays dual roles in generating the nonlinear Hall effect: it first generates nonequlibrium orbital magnetization and subsequently perturbs the circulating edge states to produce transverse Hall voltage. Based on this scenario, we point out that in isotropic chiral metals of T and O point groups, although the nonlinear Hall response of a monochromatic linear polarized electric field is forced to vanish due to the crystalline symmetry, applying a non-collinear bichromatic electric field can give rise to a nonvanishing nonlinear Hall current that directly manifests the chiral correlation of the applied electric field. This discovery in isotropic chiral crystals enables us to incoporate both the nonlinear Hall effect and the circulat photo-galvanic effect into the framework of orbital magnetization.

Title: Condensate ground states of hardcore bosons induced by an array of impurities
Authors: J. Y. Liu-Sun, E. S. Ma, Z. Song
Abstract: Neither hardcore bosons nor fermions can occupy the same lattice site-state. However, a nearest neighbour interaction may counteract the hardcore effect, resulting in condensate states in a bosonic system. In this work, we unveil the underlying mechanism by developing a general method to construct the condensate eigenstates from those of sub-Hamiltonians. As an application, we find that a local on-site potential can induce an evanescent condensate mode. Based on this, exact condensate ground states of hardcore bosons, possessing off-diagonal long-range order, can be constructed when an array of impurities is applied. The effect of the off-resonance impurity on the condensate ground states is also investigated using numerical simulations of the dynamic response.

Title: Robust Anisotropic Spin Hall Effect in Rutile RuO2
Authors: Yu-Chun Wang, Zhe-Yu Shen, Chia-Hsi Lin, Wei-Chih Hsu, Yi-Ying Chin, Akhilesh Kr. Singh, Wei-Li Lee, Ssu-Yen Huang, Danru Qu
Abstract: Altermagnets, which exhibit the advantages of both antiferromagnets and ferromagnets, have attracted significant attention recently. Among them, ruthenium dioxide (RuO2), a prototypical altermagnet candidate, is under intensive debate on its magnetic order and altermagnetic characters. In this work, we provide a comprehensive study of the spin-to-charge conversion in epitaxial RuO2 thin films with various orientations and fabrication methods. By utilizing thermal spin injections from a ferrimagnetic insulator, we unambiguously reveal a negative spin Hall angle for RuO2, which is opposite to all the previous reports using ferromagnetic metals. Most importantly, we observe robust anisotropic spin-to-charge conversion in RuO2, with voltage ratios of 30% for the (100)- and (110)-orientations and 40% for the (101)-orientations. The ratio remains consistent across RuO2 films fabricated by sputtering, pulsed laser deposition, and molecular-beam epitaxy. These results conclusively show a robust and anisotropic spin Hall effect in RuO2 with the absence of altermagnetic spin-splitting contributions. Our study provides crucial insights and advances the understanding of spin-to-charge conversions in emerging materials with low crystal symmetries.

Title: Bloch oscillations in interacting systems driven by a time-dependent magnetic field
Authors: H. P. Zhang, Z.Song
Abstract: According to Faraday's law in classical physics, a varying magnetic field stimulates an electric eddy field. Intuitively, when a classical field is constant and imposed on a lattice, the Wannier-Stark ladders (WSL) can be established, resulting in Bloch oscillations. In this work, we investigate the dynamics of an interacting system on a (generalized) ring lattice threaded by a varying magnetic flux. Based on the rigorious results, we demonstrate that there exist many invariant subspaces in which the dynamics is periodic when the flux varies linearly over time. Nevertheless, for a given initial state, the evolved state differs from that driven by a linear field. However, the probability distributions of the two states are identical, referred to as the quantum analogue of Faraday's law. Our results are ubiquitous for a wide variety of interacting systems. We demonstrate these results through numerical simulations in an extended fermi-Hubbard model.

Title: First principal investigation of Structural optical and thermoelectric properties of hybrid organic-inorganic perovskite $[NH_3-(CH_2)_4-NH_3]CdCl_4$ compound
Authors: Hafida Ziouani, Sanaa Mazouar, Jean-Pierre Tchapet Njafa, Taoufik Abdelilah, Mahmoud Ettakni, El Mostafa Khechoubi
Abstract: The structural, thermoelectric, and optical properties of $[NH_3-(CH_2)_4-NH_3]CdCl_4$ were studied using Density Functional Theory (DFT) within the ABINIT code. The GGA-PBE functional, plane wave pseudopotentials, a kinetic energy cutoff of $35Ha$, and an 11x8x8 Monkhorst-Pack $k$-point grid were employed. The material comprises inorganic $[CdCl_4]^{2-}$ sheets, organic $[NH_3-(CH_2)_4-NH_3]^{2+}$ layers, and $N-H-Cl$ hydrogen bonds, ensuring sublattice cohesion. Structural optimization used reference crystal data, enabling analysis of alkylene-diammonium chain conformation, intermolecular interactions, and crystal stability. The study highlights the role of $Cd$ in influencing optical and thermoelectric properties. Temperature-induced changes lead to a reduced band gap and enhanced optical absorption, indicating significant electronic structure modifications. These findings propose $[NH_3-(CH_2)_4-NH_3]CdCl_4$ as a promising candidate for optoelectronic applications, particularly after thermal cycling, due to its improved performance under varying conditions.

Title: Observation of the nonlinear chiral thermoelectric Hall effect in tellurium
Authors: Tetsuya Nomoto, Akiko Kikkawa, Kazuki Nakazawa, Terufumi Yamaguchi, Fumitaka Kagawa
Abstract: The nonlinear thermoelectric effect is a key factor for realising unconventional thermoelectric phenomena, such as heat rectification and power generation using thermal fluctuations. Recent theoretical advances have indicated that chiral materials can host a variety of exotic nonlinear thermoelectric transport arising from inversion-symmetry breaking. However, experimental demonstration has yet to be achieved. Here, we report the observation of the nonlinear chiral thermoelectric Hall effect in chiral tellurium at room temperature, where a voltage is generated as a cross product of the temperature gradient and electric field. The resulting thermoelectric Hall voltage is on the order of {\mu}V, consistent with the prediction from the ab initio calculation. Furthermore, the sign of the thermoelectric Hall voltage is reversed depending on the crystal chirality, demonstrating a novel functionality of sign control of the thermoelectric effect by the chirality degrees of freedom. Our findings reveal the potential of chiral systems as nonlinear thermoelectric materials for advanced thermal management and energy harvesting.

Title: Flow Matching for Discrete Systems: Efficient Free Energy Sampling Across Lattice Sizes and Temperatures
Authors: Ping Tuo, ZeZhu Zeng, Jiale Chen, Bingqing Cheng
Abstract: Generative models have advanced significantly in sampling material systems with continuous variables, such as atomistic structures. However, their application to discrete variables, like atom types or spin states, remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce a Boltzmann generator built on discrete flow matching, specifically tailored for systems with discrete phase-space coordinates (e.g., the Ising model or crystalline compounds). This approach enables a single model to sample free energy surfaces over a wide temperature range with minimal training overhead. In addition, the model generation is scalable to larger lattice sizes than those in the training set. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the 2D Ising model, showing efficient and reliable free energy sampling. This framework provides a scalable and computationally efficient solution for discrete coordinate systems and can be extended to sample the alchemical degrees of freedom in crystalline compounds.

Title: Anisotropic response of defect bound states to magnetic field in epitaxial FeSn films
Authors: Huimin Zhang, Zhengfei Wang, Michael Weinert, Lian Li
Abstract: Crystal defects, whether intrinsic or engineered, drive many fundamental phenomena and novel functionalities of quantum materials. Here, we report symmetry-breaking phenomena induced by Sn-vacancy defects on the surface of epitaxial Kagome antiferromagnet FeSn films using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy. Near the Sn-vacancy defects, anisotropic quasiparticle interference patterns are observed in the differential conductance dI/dV maps, indicating two-fold electronic states that break the 6-fold rotational symmetry of the Kagome layer. Furthermore, the Sn-vacancy defects induce bound states that exhibit anomalous Zeeman shifts under an out-of-plane magnetic field, where their energy shifts linearly towards higher energy independent of the direction of the magnetic field. Under an in-plane magnetic field, the shift of the bound state energy also shows a two-fold oscillating behavior as a function of the azimuth angle. These findings demonstrate defect-enabled new functionalities in Kagome antiferromagnets for potential applications in nanoscale spintronic devices.

Title: Functional Unit: A New Perspective on Materials Science Research Paradigms
Authors: Caichao Ye, Tao Feng, Weishu Liu, Wenqing Zhang
Abstract: New materials have long marked the civilization level, serving as an impetus for technological progress and societal transformation. The classic structure-property correlations were key of materials science and engineering. However, the knowledge of materials faces significant challenges in adapting to exclusively data-driven approaches for new material discovery. This perspective introduces the concepts of functional units (FUs) to fill the gap in understanding of material structure-property correlations and knowledge inheritance as the "composition-microstructure" paradigm transitions to a data-driven AI paradigm transitions. Firstly, we provide a bird's-eye view of the research paradigm evolution from early "process-structure-properties-performance" to contemporary data-driven AI new trend. Next, we highlight recent advancements in the characterization of functional units across diverse material systems, emphasizing their critical role in multiscale material design. Finally, we discuss the integration of functional units into the new AI-driven paradigm of materials science, addressing both opportunities and challenges in computational materials innovation.

Title: Probing Electron Localization and Delocalization in the Selective Long-Range Tight-Binding Model
Authors: Mohammad Pouranvari
Abstract: In this study, we perform a detailed investigation into the interplay between disorder-induced electron localization and long-range hopping amplitudes within the Selective Long-Range Tight-Binding Model (SLRTB). Through numerical simulations, we analyze the electronic properties of the system, with a focus on the participation ratio (PR), entanglement entropy (EE), energy spectrum, and the ratio of level spacings ($r_n$). Our results reveal a marked distinction between negative and positive long-range hopping amplitudes, manifesting in different electronic behaviors and transitions. Notably, we carry out a finite-size scaling analysis, identifying the critical point and exponents that characterize the system's behavior near the transition. The investigation highlights the role of gapless regions in shaping the system's PR, $r_n$, and EE, and the influence of disorder on these properties. The SLRTB model proves to be an effective framework for understanding the effects of disorder and long-range hopping on electron dynamics, offering valuable insights into localization and delocalization phenomena.

Title: Topological Nature of Orbital Chern Insulators
Authors: Yueh-Ting Yao, Chia-Hung Chu, Arun Bansil, Hsin Lin, Tay-Rong Chang
Abstract: Ground state topologies in quantum materials have unveiled many unique topological phases with novel Hall responses. Recently, the orbital Hall effect in insulators has suggested the existence of orbital Chern insulators (OCIs) in which the orbital angular momentum drives the Hall response. Studies on OCIs, however, have so far been restricted to valley-locked or spinful systems, but candidate materials for systematic studies of OCIs are lacking. Here we discuss a framework for investigating OCIs using the feature-spectrum topology approach. To characterize the ground-state topology in the orbital degree of freedom, we introduce the orbital Chern number and orbital-feature Berry curvature and demonstrate the bulk-boundary correspondence and orbital Hall response. We also uncover a parameter-driven topological phase transition, which would offer tunability of the OCIs. In this way, we identify monolayer blue-phosphorene (traditionally considered topologically trivial) as the primal 'hydrogen atom' of OCIs as a spinless, valley-free OCI material. Our study gives insight into the nature of orbital-driven topological phases and reveals a new facet of blue-phosphorene, and provides a new pathway for advancements in orbitronics and the discovery of novel topological materials.

Title: Phase Transitions and Critical Behavior in Quasi-One-Dimensional Two-Channel Systems with Quasiperiodic Disorder
Authors: Mohammad Pouranvari
Abstract: We investigate the localization properties of a quasi-one-dimensional two-channel system with symmetric and asymmetric onsite energies using the Aubry-André model. By analyzing the Lyapunov exponent and localization length, we characterize the phase transitions and critical behavior of the system. For the symmetric model, we obtain the phase diagram for the entire spectrum, revealing mobility edges between delocalized and localized states. In contrast, for the asymmetric model, we identify a critical line $ \lambda_1^c + \lambda_2^c \approx 0.5 $ marking the phase transition between delocalized and localized states. We also study the effects of the inter-channel coupling $ \tilde{t} $, and observe that increasing $ \tilde{t} $ reduces the delocalized phase space, shifting the transition from $ \lambda_1 = \lambda_2 = 1 $ at $ \tilde{t} = 0 $ to $ \lambda_1^c + \lambda_2^c \approx 0.5 $ at larger $ \tilde{t} $. Furthermore, the phase transition point is found to be sensitive to both $ \tilde{t} $ and the incommensurate modulation parameter $ b $. While the general phase transition behavior is preserved, subtle differences arise for different values of $ b $, indicating a dependence of the phase boundary on both parameters. Using the cost function approach, we calculate the critical potential strength $ \lambda_c $ and the critical exponent $ \nu $, with $ \nu \approx 0.5 $ for the middle of the spectrum in both symmetric and asymmetric models.

Title: Directional Localization in Disordered 2D Tight-Binding Systems: Insights from Single Particle Entanglement Measures
Authors: Mohammad Pouranvari
Abstract: We investigate the directional localization properties of wave-functions in a two-dimensional tight-binding model with uniform hopping and correlated random on-site energies. By controlling the disorder correlation strength with a parameter $\alpha$, we explore the effects of disorder on wave-function localization using Single Particle Entanglement Entropy (SPEE) and Single Particle Rényi Entropy (SPRE) at different values of $q$. Our analysis includes two distinct randomness structures: row-wise and fully correlated disorder. We find that row-wise disorder maintains maximal entanglement for horizontal cuts while enhancing horizontal spread for vertical cuts as $\alpha$ increases. In contrast, fully correlated disorder leads to reduced vertical entanglement for horizontal cuts and increased horizontal entanglement for vertical cuts with rising $\alpha$. Additionally, our results show that the difference between SPEE and SPRE provides valuable insights into localization behavior. These findings highlight the significance of directional properties in understanding localization transitions in disordered systems.

Title: Spin-lattice coupling and lattice anharmonicity across structural phase transitions in spin-orbit coupled K2IrBr6

Abstract: The interplay between lattice distortions, magnetism, and spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in 5d transition-metal halides offers a platform for studying correlated spin-lattice dynamics. Here, we investigate the impact of the temperature-driven structural phase transitions on local spin environments and lattice vibrations in the antifluorite compound K2IrBr6 using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), Raman scattering, and first-principles calculations. K2IrBr6 undergoes two structural transitions at nominal temperatures: cubic-to-tetragonal near 170 K and tetragonal-to-monoclinic at ~122 K. EPR reveals persistent spin-spin correlations emerging well above the Néel temperature (12 K), accompanied by strong exchange narrowing and anisotropic g-factors, highlighting the role of SOC and structural symmetry breaking in modifying spin-lattice interactions. Raman scattering identifies phonon anomalies at the transition temperatures, with increasing lattice anharmonicity as symmetry is reduced. While no soft phonons are observed, the systematic enhancement of anharmonic effects suggests that evolving spin correlations may contribute to phonon renormalization. These findings establish K2IrBr6 as a model system for investigating coupled spin-lattice effects in SOC-driven materials.

Title: High-throughput computation and machine learning modeling of magnetic moments and Mössbauer parameters for Fe-based intermetallics
Authors: Bo Zhao, Hongbin Zhang
Abstract: Based on high-throughput density functional theory calculations, we evaluate the local magnetic moments and Mössbauer properties for Fe-based intermetallic compounds and exploy machine learning to map the local crystalline environments to such properties. It is observed that magnetic moments and Mössbauer parameters provide complementary insights into the local crystalline environment, where the statistical features cannot be captured using phenomenological models. Furthermore, we find that the scarcity of existing data in Materials Project (MP) poses a significant challenge in developing predictive machine learning models, whereas SOAP-based descriptors can be applied for reliable modeling of the enriched datasets with extra structural prototypes. This work advances the mapping of local crystalline structures to magnetic and spectroscopic properties, bridging the gap between empirical observations and theoretical models.

Title: Sampling the space of solutions of an artificial neural network
Authors: Alessandro Zambon, Enrico M. Malatesta, Guido Tiana, Riccardo Zecchina
Abstract: The weight space of an artificial neural network can be systematically explored using tools from statistical mechanics. We employ a combination of a hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm which performs long exploration steps, a ratchet-based algorithm to investigate connectivity paths, and coupled replica models simulations to study subdominant flat regions. Our analysis focuses on one hidden layer networks and spans a range of energy levels and constrained density regimes. Near the interpolation threshold, the low-energy manifold shows a spiky topology. While these spikes aid gradient descent, they can trap general sampling algorithms at low temperatures; they remain connected by complex paths in a confined, non-flat region. In the overparameterized regime, however, the low-energy manifold becomes entirely flat, forming an extended complex structure that is easy to sample. These numerical results are supported by an analytical study of the training error landscape, and we show numerically that the qualitative features of the loss landscape are robust across different data structures. Our study aims to provide new methodological insights for developing scalable methods for large networks.

Title: Neural network learning of multi-scale and discrete temporal features in directed percolation
Authors: Feng Gao, Jianmin Shen, Shanshan Wang, Wei Li, Dian Xu
Abstract: Neural network methods are increasingly applied to solve phase transition problems, particularly in identifying critical points in non-equilibrium phase transitions, offering more convenience compared to traditional methods. In this paper, we analyze the (1+1)-dimensional and (2+1)-dimensional directed percolation models using an autoencoder network. We demonstrate that single-step configurations after reaching steady state can replace traditional full configurations for learning purposes. This approach significantly reduces data size and accelerates training this http URL, we introduce a multi-input branch autoencoder network to extract shared features from systems of different sizes. The neural network is capable of learning results from finite-size scaling. By modifying the network input to include configurations at discrete time steps, the network can also capture temporal information, enabling dynamic analysis of non-equilibrium phase boundaries. Our proposed method allows for high-precision identification of critical points using both spatial and temporal features.

Title: Linear Response Conductance of Metallic Single Electron Pump
Authors: Prathan Srivilai, Tawan Thongsuk, Pipat Harata
Abstract: We calculate the linear-response conductance of a metallic single-electron pump using the path-integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) method. The Coulomb oscillations of the conductance are calculated to illustrate the influence of the Coulomb blockade effect on the system. Furthermore, the experimental conductance is compared with the calculated conductance of various gate voltage configurations and temperatures. The results are consistent even in the low-temperature regime, where significant quantum fluctuation occurs, and the semiclassical approximation fails. Consequently, the present investigation replicates the success of the PIMC approach while precisely describing the quantum fluctuation phenomena of single-electron devices.

Title: Charge compensation by phase segregated Sb2Se3 phase in Bi1.95Sb0.05Se3 topological insulator by laser fluence
Authors: Shivani Soni, Akhilesh Kumar, Edward Prabu Amaladass, Jegadeesan P, S. Amirthapandian, Kishore K. Madapu, Ramanathaswamy Pandian, Awadhesh Mani
Abstract: We report the charge compensation in topological insulator thin films due to the laser fluence-induced segregation of the Sb2Se3 phase. Sb doped Bi2Se3 films were deposited on commercial Si substrates coated with 300 nm of amorphous SiO2 using the Pulsed Laser Deposition technique at different laser fluence of 1.25 J-cm-2, 1.87 J-cm-2, 2.75 J-cm-2, and 3.25 J-cm-2. The grazing x-ray diffraction measurements revealed the growth of rhombohedral Bi2Se3 films on SiO2 with additional peaks corresponding to the Sb2Se3 peaks. The phase fraction of the segregated Sb2Se3 systematically reduces as the laser fluence increases. The magnetoresistance measured at temperatures 3K-20K was compared across different samples deposited at various laser fluences. The sample deposited at 1.25 J-cm-2 exhibits a bulk-insulating nature with an order decrease in the carrier density. The weak antilocalization quantum correction to the magneto conductivity was analyzed using the Hikami Larkin Nagaoka Theory. As the laser fluence increases the deduced value of coefficient alpha, number of conduction channels was found to be 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, and 5.0, and the quantum phase coherence length lphi ranges from 10 nm to 150 nm. The power factor gamma of the temperature dependence of lphi also varies as 0.37, 0.45, 0.69, and 0.92, respectively. The charge compensation due to the non-TI, ptype Sb2Se3 phase is believed to cause the reduction in the bulk carrier density n, and enhanced surface state contribution.

Title: Josephson diode effect with Andreev and Majorana bound states
Authors: Sayan Mondal, Pei-Hao Fu, Jorge Cayao
Abstract: Superconductor-semiconductor hybrids are useful for realizing the Josephson diode effect, where nonreciprocity in the supercurrents occurs due to the interplay of the Josephson effect and applied magnetic fields. These junctions can host Andreev and Majorana states with the same ingredients, though their interplay with the Josephson diode effect is unclear. In this work, we consider short Josephson junctions based on superconductor-semiconductor systems under homogeneous Zeeman fields and investigate the Josephson diode effect in the presence of Andreev and Majorana states. Under generic conditions, the Zeeman field component parallel to the spin-orbit axis promotes an asymmetric low-energy energy spectrum as a function of the superconducting phase, which persists in the trivial and topological phases hosting Andreev and Majorana bound states, respectively. Interestingly, this asymmetry creates supercurrents that are not odd functions of the phase difference, leading to a nonreciprocal behaviour and the Josephson diode effect. We show that the Josephson diode effect is particularly promoted under the presence of both zero-energy Andreev and Majorana bound states, revealing that Josephson diodes can be realized in the trivial and topological phases of superconductor-semiconductor hybrids. We then demonstrate that the Zeeman field evolution of the diode's efficiencies can map the topological phase transition and the formation of Majorana bound states via an oscillatory behavior that becomes more visible in long superconductors. While Josephson diodes generally exist in the trivial and topological phases of Josephson junctions, we discover that in the tunneling regime only a Josephson diode effect in the topological phase remains due to the finite contribution of Majorana bound states. Our findings clarify the Josephson diode effect and aid in realizing Majorana-only Josephson diodes.

Title: Altermagnetism and beyond in the $t$-$t^\prime$-$δ$ Fermi-Hubbard model
Authors: Saisai He, Jize Zhao, Hong-Gang Luo, Shijie Hu
Abstract: In this work, we revisit the phase diagram of the $t$-$t^\prime$-$\delta$ Fermi-Hubbard model on the square lattice to gain a more comprehensive understanding of this correlated model at half filling. This model has recently become a prominent topic of research because it hosts altermagnetic phases. Using mean-field analysis, we identify four metallic phases and two insulating phases with nontrivial magnetic orders at an intermediate value of $\delta = 0.5$, presenting a rich ground-state phase diagram in the $U$-$t^\prime$ plane. We also highlight the distinct features of the Fermi surface topology for each metallic phase. To go beyond the mean-field theory, we employ the density-matrix renormalization group method to simulate the ground state numerically. The phase boundaries are determined from the discontinuities and peaks in the entanglement entropy and magnetizations. In addition to the phases identified in the mean-field theory, we find a valence-bond solid state in a narrow intermediate-$t'$ region. Our work offers a firm step forward in understanding the complex behaviors of correlated electrons in the $t$-$t^\prime$-$\delta$ Hubbard model over a large parameter space.

Title: Hydrodynamic Interaction and Geometric Memory Effect Drive Directed Swimming of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii near Periodic Microstructures
Authors: Chunhe Li, Hongyi Bian, Zixiang Lin, Yi Man, Zijie Qu
Abstract: The movement of microorganisms near solid-liquid interfaces is a topic of significant scientific interest due to its relevance in various natural and industrial contexts, such as biofilm formation and marine biofouling. In this study, we investigate the swimming behavior of C. reinhardtii near a sinusoidal periodic microstructure (SPM). Using fluorescence microscopy and three-dimensional tracking, we observe that the swimming direction of C. reinhardtii is strongly influenced by the geometric constraints of the SPM. Our results show that cells tend to aggregate at the bottom of the SPM rather than the top, and exhibit a speed orientation tendency near the microstructure. We attribute this behavior to a combination of the "memory effect" and hydrodynamic attraction. By altering the shape of the periodic microstructure, we successfully achieve directed induction of cell swimming, which has potential applications in micro-nano robot control and biofouling prevention. This work provides new insights into the movement mechanisms of microorganisms near solid-liquid surfaces and highlights the potential for manipulating their behavior through microstructure design.

Title: Magnetic Correlation Spectroscopy in CrSBr
Authors: Lukas Krelle, Ryan Tan, Daria Markina, Priyanka Mondal, Kseniia Mosina, Kevin Hagmann, Regine von Klitzing, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Zdenek Sofer, Bernhard Urbaszek
Abstract: CrSBr is an air-stable magnetic van der Waals semiconductor with strong magnetic anisotropy, where the interaction of excitons with the magnetic order enables the optical identification of different magnetic phases. Here, we study the magnetic anisotropy of multi-layer CrSBr inside a three-axis vector magnet and correlate magnetic order and optical transitions in emission and absorption. We identify layer by layer switching of the magnetization through drastic changes of the optical emission and absorption energy and strength as a function of the applied magnetic field. We correlate optical transitions in reflection spectra with photoluminescence (PL) emission using a transfer-matrix analysis and find that ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic order between layers can coexist in the same crystal. In the multi-peak PL emission the intensity of energetically lower lying transitions reduces monotonously with increasing field strength whereas energetically higher lying transitions around the bright exciton $X_B$ brighten close to the saturation field. Using this contrasting behavior we can therefore correlate transitions with each other.

Title: The effect of boron incorporation on leakage and wake-up in ferroelectric Al_{1-x}Sc_xN
Authors: Maike Gremmel (1), Chandrashekhar Prakash Savant (2), Debaditya Bhattacharya (3), Georg Schönweger (1, 4), Debdeep Jena (2, 3, 5), Simon Fichtner (1, 4) ((1) Institute of Material Science, Kiel University, Germany (2) Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Cornell University, United States (3) School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Cornell University, United States (4) Fraunhofer Institute for Silicon Technology (ISIT), Germany (5) Kavli Institute at Cornell for Nanoscale Science, Cornell University, United States)
Abstract: This study explores the influence of boron incorporation on the structural and electrical properties of ferroelectric Aluminum Scandium Nitride (Al_{1-x}Sc_xN ) thin films, focusing on leakage currents, wake-up effects, and imprint behavior. Al_{1-x}Sc_xN films were incorporated with varying boron concentrations and analyzed under different deposition conditions to determine their structural integrity and ferroelectric performance. Key findings include a reduction in leakage currents, non-trivial alterations in bandgap energy as well as an increasing coercive fields with increasing boron content. Films with 6-13 at.% boron exhibited N-polar growth, while those with 16 at.% boron showed mixed polarity after deposition, which affected their ferroelectric response during the initial switching cycles - as did the addition of boron itself compared to pure Al1-xScxN . With increasing boron content, wake-up became gradually more pronounced and was strongest for pure Al_{1-x}B_xN .

Title: Multi-particle-collision simulation of heat transfer in low-dimensional fluids
Authors: Rongxiang Luo, Stefano Lepri
Abstract: Simulation of transport properties of confined, low-dimensional fluids can be performed efficiently by means of Multi-Particle Collision (MPC) dynamics with suitable thermal-wall boundary conditions. We illustrate the effectiveness of the method by studying dimensionality effects and size-dependence of thermal conduction, properties of crucial importance for understanding heat transfer at the micro-nanoscale. We provide a sound numerical evidence that the simple MPC fluid displays the features previously predicted from hydrodynamics of lattice systems: (1) in 1D, the thermal conductivity $\kappa$ diverges with the system size $L$ as $\kappa\sim L^{1/3}$ and its total heat current autocorrelation function $C(t)$ decays with the time $t$ as $C(t)\sim t^{-2/3}$; (2) in 2D, $\kappa$ diverges with $L$ as $\kappa\sim \mathrm{ln} (L)$ and its $C(t)$ decays with $t$ as $C(t)\sim t^{-1}$; (3) in 3D, its $\kappa$ is independent with $L$ and its $C(t)$ decays with $t$ as $C(t)\sim t^{-3/2}$. For weak interaction (the nearly integrable case) in 1D and 2D, there exists an intermediate regime of sizes where kinetic effects dominate and transport is diffusive before crossing over to expected anomalous regime. The crossover can be studied by decomposing the heat current in two contributions, which allows for a very accurate test of the predictions. In addition, we also show that upon increasing the aspect ratio of the system, there exists a dimensional crossover from 2D or 3D dimensional behavior to the 1D one. Finally, we show that an applied magnetic field renders the transport normal, indicating that pseudomomentum conservation is not sufficient for the anomalous heat conduction behavior to occur.

Title: Image-potential states on a 2D Gr-ferromagnet hybrid: enhancing spin and stacking sensing
Authors: Maciej Bazarnik, Anika Schlenhoff
Abstract: Spin-resolved scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy studies of image-potential states on Gr/Fe/Ir(111) show their sensitivity to the spatial variation of the Gr-Fe distance, and of the interfacial charge and spin transfer within the moiré unit cell. A stacking contrast between fcc and hcp sites, indistinguishable in the direct tunneling mode, is provided by the image-potential states in both resonant tunneling topography and spectroscopy images. The spin-polarized measurements reveal a site- and energy-dependent spin-polarization of the image-potential states that is mapped across the moiré unit cell with a spin contrast between hcp and fcc sites unobservable in direct tunneling mode. On the on-top sites, the lowest image-potential states are found to exhibit a high spin-polarization, in contrast to the electronic states around the Fermi energy evanescent into vacuum, and attributed to their interfacial character at the respective Gr-Fe distance. Since the physisorbed graphene is only weakly spin-polarized on these sites, image-potential states reflect the spin density at buried interfaces covered by non-magnetic passivation layers. The simultaneous imaging of structural, electronic and magnetic properties, both at the surface and the buried interface will prove invaluable in research of 2D hybrids and heterostructures.

Title: Contribution of Geometry and Non-Abelian Gauge Fields to Aharonov-Bohm Scattering of Massless Fermions in Graphene with Disclinations
Authors: M. J. Bueno, G. Q. Garcia, A. M. de M. Carvalho, C. Furtado
Abstract: This work examines the effect of disclinations on the scattering of quasipaticles in graphene with the presence of a topological defect. Using the tight-binding method, the electronic properties of graphene with disclination are described, where the topological defects are introduced in the lattice via geometric theory. The massless Dirac equation is modified to account for the curvature induced by these defects, incorporating a gauge field. The results show that disclinations significantly affect the scattering process, altering phase shifts and interference patterns. The differential cross-section and its dependence on the scattering angle are analyzed, highlighting the role of geometric factors like the parameter {\alpha} in shaping the scattering dynamics.

Title: Influence of Crystal Structure and Composition on Optical and Electronic Properties of Pyridinium-based Bismuth Iodide Complexes
Authors: Gisya Abdi, Marlena Gryl, Andrzej Sławek, Ewelina Kowalewska, Tomasz Mazur, Agnieszka Podborska, Krzysztof Mech, Piotr Zawal, Anurag Pritam, Angelika Kmita, Lulu Alluhaibi, Alexey Maximenko, Chakkooth Vijayakumar, Konrad Szaciłowski
Abstract: This study investigates the impacts of structure and composition on the optical and electronic properties of a series of pyridinium-based bismuth iodide complexes. Organic substrates with various functional groups, such as 4-aminopyridine (4-Ampy), 4-methylpyridine (4-Mepy), 4-dimethyaminopyridine (4-Dmapy), and 4-pyridinecarbonitrile (4-CNpy) with different electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups at the para position of the pyridine ring were employed. Crystallographic analysis reveals various bismuth iodide structures, including 1D chains and discrete 0D motifs. The optical band gap of these materials, identified via Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) and verified with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, is influenced by the crystal packing and stabilising interactions. Through a comprehensive analysis, including Hirshfeld surface (HS) and void assessment, the study underscores the influence of noncovalent intermolecular interactions on crystal packing. Spectroscopic evaluations provide insights into electronic interactions, elucidating the role of electron donor and acceptor substituents within the lattice. Thermogravimetric differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA) indicates structural stability up to 250°C. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) reveals significant conductivity in the range of 10-20 mS/pixel at 298.15 K. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) at the Bi L3 edge indicates a similar oxidation state and electronic environment across all samples, underscoring the role of bismuth centres surrounded by iodides.

Title: Computation Kernel for Feynman Diagrams
Authors: Daria Gazizova, Rayan Farid, B. D. E. McNiven, I. Assi, Ethan G. Armstrong, J. P. F. LeBlanc
Abstract: We present a general representation for solving problems in many-body perturbation theory. By defining an overcomplete representation for the single-particle Green's function we show how one can convert an arbitrary Feynman graph to a universal kernel representation. Once constructed, the computation kernel contains no problem specific information yet contains all explicit temperature and frequency dependence of the diagram. This computation kernel is problem agnostic, and valid for any physical problem that would normally leverage the Matsubara formalism of many-body perturbation theory. The result of any diagram can be written as a linear combination of these computation kernel elements with coefficients given by a sum over products of known tensor elements that are themselves problem specific and represent spatial degrees of freedom. We probe the efficacy of this approach by generating the computation kernel for a low order self-energy diagram which we then use to construct solutions to distinct problems.

Title: A hybrid method integrating Green's function Monte Carlo and projected entangled pair states
Authors: He-Yu Lin, Rong-Qiang He, Yibin Guo, Zhong-Yi Lu
Abstract: This paper introduces a hybrid approach combining Green's function Monte Carlo (GFMC) method with projected entangled pair state (PEPS) ansatz. This hybrid method regards PEPS as a trial state and a guiding wave function in GFMC. By leveraging PEPS's proficiency in capturing quantum state entanglement and GFMC's efficient parallel architecture, the hybrid method is well-suited for the accurate and efficient treatment of frustrated quantum spin systems. As a benchmark, we applied this approach to study the frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model on a square lattice with periodic boundary conditions (PBC). Compared with other numerical methods, our approach integrating PEPS and GFMC shows competitive accuracy in the performance of ground-state energy. This paper provides systematic and comprehensive discussion of the approach of our previous work.

Title: Magnetic ordering in out-of-plane artificial spin systems based on the Archimedean lattices
Authors: Aleksandra Pac, Gavin M. Macauley, Jamie R. Massey, Aleksandr Kurenkov, Frédéric Mila, Peter M. Derlet, Laura J. Heyderman
Abstract: Artificial spin systems, sometimes referred to as artificial spin ices, are arrays of coupled nanoscale magnets that order according to the lattice geometry, nanomagnet shape and magnetic anisotropy. Here we characterize a family of artificial spin systems that are formed by placing arrays of out-of-plane nanomagnets on the vertices of the Archimedean lattices. On demagnetizing these nanomagnet arrays using a magnetic field protocol and subsequently imaging the magnetic configuration using magnetic force microscopy, we observe different types of magnetic order. We compare our experimental results with those predicted by Monte Carlo simulations to assign an effective temperature to each lattice. We find that, for all of the lattices, the assigned effective temperature is above the transition temperature. This reflects the difficulty of obtaining system-spanning order in lattices with out-of-plane nanomagnets. We consider to what extent further-neighbor interactions affect the phase diagram and spin-spin correlations in each lattice, illustrating our results with four example lattices. We can divide the lattices into three main categories: bipartite lattices that admit a perfect antiferromagnetic ground state, frustrated lattices where ordering proceeds via a single step, and frustrated lattices with two-step-ordering. Our work highlights the diversity of magnetic ordering that can be hosted in two-dimensional artificial spin systems with out-of-plane nanomagnets, and demonstrates the importance of including long-range interactions to explain the magnetic ordering. Such insights will be important for incorporating artificial spin systems into novel computing applications.

Title: XY-like Incommensurate Magnetic Order in Ce$_2$SnS$_5$
Authors: Maximilien F. Debbas, Takehito Suzuki, Joseph G. Checkelsky
Abstract: We report the synthesis of single crystals of Ce$_2$SnS$_5$ through a two-stage chemical vapor transport method. The Ce$_2$SnS$_5$ system is a member of the orthorhombic $Pbam$ (No. 55) space group and realizes a distorted trigonal tricapped prism (TTP) crystal field around each cerium site. We characterized the sample through orientation-dependent magnetization and heat capacity measurements to probe the magnetic anisotropy in the system characteristic of XY-like anisotropic Heisenberg model behavior. Ce$_2$SnS$_5$ furthermore enters a zero-field ordered phase under $T_N =$ 2.4 K; powder neutron diffraction measurements reveal incommensurate magnetic order near $T_N$. The system locks into a commensurate structure with a $(q_x, q_y, q_z) = (1/3,0,0)$ propagation vector below approximately 1.2 K.

Title: Non-magnetic Fractional Conductance in High Mobility InAs Quantum Point Contacts
Authors: I. Villar Rodriguez, Y. Gul, C.P. Dempsey, J.T. Dong, S.N. Holmes, C.J. Palmstrom, M. Pepper
Abstract: In this letter, we report the magneto-electronic properties of high mobility InAs quantum point contacts grown on InP substrates. The 1D conductance reaches a maximum value of 17 plateaus, quantized in units of 2e^2/h, where e is the fundamental unit of charge and h is Planck's constant. The in-plane effective g-factor was estimated to be -10.9 +/- 1.5 for subband N = 1 and -10.8 +/- 1.6 for subband N = 2. Furthermore, a study of the non-magnetic fractional conductance states at 0.2 (e^2/h) and 0.1(e2/h is provided. While their origin remains under discussion, evidence suggests that they arise from strong electron-electron interactions and momentum-conserving backscattering between electrons in two distinct channels within the 1D region. This phenomenon may also be interpreted as an entanglement between the two channel directions facilitated by momentum-conserving backscattering.

Title: Improved thermal stability of dielectric properties and energy storage properties of lead-free relaxor Ba(1-x)LaxTi0.89Sn0.11O3 ceramics
Authors: S. Khardazi, D. Mezzane, M. Amjoud, N. Novak, E. Choukri, S. Lyubchyk, Z. Kutnjak, B. Rožič, S. Terenchuk, I. Lukyanchuk
Abstract: Lead-free perovskite ceramics Ba(1-x)LaxTi0.89Sn0.11O3 with x= 0, 0.015, 0.025, and 0.035 (BLTSnx) were synthesized by solid-state reaction method. The enhanced energy storage properties were studied across the ferroelectric relaxor conversion. The pure perovskite structure of all prepared samples was confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis and the Raman spectroscopy technique. Scanning electron microscopy micrographs show a drastic decrease in the grain size in La-doped ceramics. Furthermore, the doped samples exhibit smeared phase transition and frequency dispersion in dielectric permittivity, typical for relaxors. The P-E hysteresis loops become thin with the increase of the La-doping, demonstrating the ferroelectric-relaxor phase conversion. The enhanced recovered energy density and the energy storage efficiency of 158.8 mJ/cm3 and 82.73 % were observed in the BLTSn2.5 sample at room temperature, respectively. These properties indicate that environmentally friendly BLTSn2.5 is a viable candidate for energy-storage capacitor applications near room temperature.

Title: Fermiology and Band Structure of Oxygen-Terminated Ti3C2Tx MXene
Authors: Martin Magnuson, Per Eklund, Craig Polley
Abstract: The class of two-dimensional carbides and nitrides known as MXenes exhibit remarkable electronic properties. Tailoring these properties, however, requires an in-depth understanding of the band structure and Fermi-surface topology. Surface oxidation of MXenes has previously hampered the characterization of their Fermi surface, which is crucial for understanding the topology and anisotropy in the electronic structure and, ultimately, for tailoring electronic properties. Here, we reveal the Fermi surface topology and band structure of purely oxygen-terminated Ti3C2Tx MXene achieved through rigorous thin film sample preparation and ultrahigh vacuum annealing. Polarized synchrotron radiation-based angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy reveals electron pockets, bulk band gaps, and a Dirac-like feature in the anisotropic electronic band structure. This paves the way for a fundamental understanding of band engineering of electronic transport properties, providing insights of importance for energy storage devices, transparent conductors, and catalysis.

Title: Kramers nodal lines in intercalated TaS$_2$ superconductors

Hallas, Robert J. Birgeneau, Luis Balicas, Ján Minár, Pavan Hosur, Kam Tuen Law, Emilia Morosan, Ming Yi
Abstract: Kramers degeneracy is one fundamental embodiment of the quantum mechanical nature of particles with half-integer spin under time reversal symmetry. Under the chiral and noncentrosymmetric achiral crystalline symmetries, Kramers degeneracy emerges respectively as topological quasiparticles of Weyl fermions and Kramers nodal lines, anchoring the Berry phase-related physics of electrons. However, an experimental demonstration for ideal Kramers nodal lines (KNLs) well isolated at the Fermi level is lacking. Here, we establish a class of noncentrosymmetric achiral intercalated transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) superconductors with large Ising-type spin-orbit coupling, represented by In$_x$TaS$_2$, to host an ideal KNL phase. We provide evidence from angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) with spin resolution, angle-dependent quantum oscillation (QO) measurements, and ab-initio calculations. Our work not only provides a realistic platform for realizing and tuning KNLs in layered materials, but also paves the way for exploring the interplay between KNLs and superconductivity, as well as applications pertaining to spintronics, valleytronics, and nonlinear transport.

Title: Tunable Octdong and Spindle-Torus Fermi Surfaces in Kramers Nodal Line Metals
Authors: Gabriele Domaine, Moritz H. Hirschmann, Kirill Parshukov, Mihir Date, Matthew D. Watson, Sydney K. Y. Dufresne, Shigemi Terakawa, Marcin Rosmus, Natalia Olszowska, Stuart S. P. Parkin, Andreas P. Schnyder, Niels B. M. Schröter
Abstract: It has recently been proposed that all achiral non-centrosymmetric crystals host so-called Kramers nodal lines, which are doubly degenerate band crossings connecting time-reversal invariant momenta in the Brillouin zone that arise due to spin-orbit coupling. When Kramers nodal lines intersect the Fermi level, they form exotic three-dimensional Fermi surfaces which is certain configurations can be fully described by two-dimensional massless Dirac fermions. These Fermi surfaces are predicted to realize a quantized optical conductivity with multiple quantized levels a large light- and field-induced anomalous Hall effect. However, until now, no Kramers nodal line metal with such unconventional Fermi surfaces has been experimentally observed. Here, we extend the search for Kramers nodal line metals beyond the previously considered case in which the Fermi surfaces enclose a single time-reversal invariant momentum. Using angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy measurements and ab-initio calculations, we present evidence that the 3R polytypes of TaS$_2$ and NbS$_2$ are Kramers nodal line metals with open Octdong and Spindle-torus Fermi surfaces, respectively. We show that by reducing the band filling, a transition between these two configurations can be observed. Moreover, our data suggests a naturally occurring size quantization effect of inclusions of 3R-TaS$_2$ in commercially available 2H-TaS$_2$ crystals, which could enable the observation of quantized optical conductivity. Finally, since the open Fermi-surfaces encircle two time-reversal invariant momenta each, we predict a phase transition from a Kramers nodal line metal to a conventional metal by strain or uniaxial pressure. Our work establishes the 3R phase of metallic transition metal dichalcogenides as a tunable platform to explore new phenomena expected from exotic Fermi surfaces in Kramers nodal line metals.

Title: Spin wave eigenmodes in nanoscale magnetic tunnel junctions with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy
Authors: Andrea Meo, Chengcen Sha, Emily Darwin, Riccardo Tomasello, Mario Carpentieri, Ilya N. Krivorotov, Giovanni Finocchio
Abstract: Magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) are key enablers of spintronic technologies used in a variety of applications including information storage, microwave generation and detection, as well as unconventional computing. Here, we present experimental and theoretical studies of quantized spin wave eigenmodes in perpendicular MTJs focusing on a coupled magnetization dynamics in the free (FL) and reference (RL) layers of the MTJ, where the RL is a synthetic antiferromagnet (SAF). Spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance (ST-FMR) measurements reveal excitation of two spin wave eigenmodes in response to applied microwave current. These modes show opposite frequency shifts as a function of out-of-plane magnetic field. Our micromagnetic simulations accurately reproduce the dependence of the mode frequencies on magnetic field and reveal the spatial profiles of the excitations in the FL and RL. The FL and RL modes generate rectified voltage signals of opposite polarity, which makes this device a promising candidate for a tunable dual-frequency microwave signal detector. The simulations show that weak interlayer exchange coupling within the SAF enhances the mode amplitudes. We also calculate the response of the detector as a function of in-plane magnetic field bias and find that its sensitivity significantly increases with increasing field. We experimentally confirm this prediction via ST-FMR measurements as a function of in-plane magnetic field. Our results provide deeper understanding of quantized spin wave eigenmodes in nanoscale MTJs with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and demonstrate the potential of these devices for frequency-selective dual-channel microwave signal detectors.

Title: Hierarchical autoregressive neural networks in three-dimensional statistical system
Authors: Piotr Białas, Vaibhav Chahar, Piotr Korcyl, Tomasz Stebel, Mateusz Winiarski, Dawid Zapolski
Abstract: Autoregressive Neural Networks (ANN) have been recently proposed as a mechanism to improve the efficiency of Monte Carlo algorithms for several spin systems. The idea relies on the fact that the total probability of a configuration can be factorized into conditional probabilities of each spin, which in turn can be approximated by a neural network. Once trained, the ANNs can be used to sample configurations from the approximated probability distribution and to evaluate explicitly this probability for a given configuration. It has also been observed that such conditional probabilities give access to information-theoretic observables such as mutual information or entanglement entropy. So far, these methods have been applied to two-dimensional statistical systems or one-dimensional quantum systems. In this paper, we describe a generalization of the hierarchical algorithm to three spatial dimensions and study its performance on the example of the Ising model. We discuss the efficiency of the training and also describe the scaling with the system's dimensionality by comparing results for two- and three-dimensional Ising models with the same number of spins. Finally, we provide estimates of thermodynamical observables for the three-dimensional Ising model, such as the entropy and free energy in a range of temperatures across the phase transition.

Title: Shear-Rate Dependent Surface Tension of Glass-Forming Fluids
Authors: Linnea Heitmeier, Thomas Voigtmann
Abstract: We investigate the interface of a glass-forming fluid showing non-Newtonian rheology. By applying shear flow in the interface, we detect that the surface tension depends on the shear rate. Importantly, the standard way of determining surface tension from the pressure drop across the interface gives rise to an effective surface tension in the non-Newtonian fluid that mixes bulk and interface properties. We show how the pressure anisotropy can be used to clearly define the bulk and interface regions and extract a genuine shear-rate dependent surface tension. The results have implications for measurement techniques related to interfacial rheology of complex fluids.

Abstract: Nanoscale electrostatic control of oxide interfaces enables physical phenomena and exotic functionalities beyond the realm of the bulk material. In technologically-relevant ferroelectric thin films, the interface-mediated polarization control is usually exerted by engineering the depolarizing field. Here, in contrast, we introduce polarizing surfaces and lattice chemistry engineering as an alternative strategy. Specifically, we engineer the electric-dipole ordering in ferroelectric oxide heterostructures by exploiting the charged sheets of the layered Aurivillius model system. By tracking in-situ the formation of the Aurivillius charged Bi$_{2}$O$_{2}$ sheets, we reveal their polarizing effect leading to the characteristic Aurivillius out-of-plane antipolar ordering. Next, we use the polarizing Bi$_{2}$O$_{2}$ stacking as a versatile electrostatic environment to create new electric dipole configurations. We insert multiferroic BiFeO$_3$ into the Aurivillius framework to stabilize a ferrielectric-like non-collinear electric-dipole order in the final heterostructure while maintaining the antiferromagnetic order of BiFeO$_3$. We thus demonstrate that engineering the lattice chemistry stabilizes unconventional ferroic orderings at the nanoscale, a strategy that may be expanded beyond the realm of electrically ordered materials.

Title: Optical probes of coherence in two dimensional Bose gases of polaritons
Authors: Joseph Jachinowski, Hassan Alnatah, David W. Snoke, Peter B. Littlewood
Abstract: Due to their photonic components, exciton-polariton systems provide a convenient platform to study the coherence properties of weakly-interacting Bose gases and the Bose-Einstein condensate transition. In particular, optical interferometry enables the measurement of the first-order coherence function which provides insight into the phase of the system. In this paper, we analyze the buildup of coherence in finite-sized, noninteracting, equilibrium Bose gases through the condensate fraction and the related coherent fraction, defined via the first-order coherence function. Our results provide a baseline to compare against experimental data. Discrepancies may indicate where interacting or nonequilibrium models are necessary to describe the system. In the normal phase, before the Bose-Einstein condensate transition, Bose gases exhibit partial spatial and temporal coherence. This significantly alters the paraxial propagation and interference of optical signals from exciton-polariton systems. Therefore, we also analyze diffraction related to the introduction of apertures and time-delay between interferometry arms, given the partial coherence of the source. Comparison to experiment shows remarkable agreement with the noninteracting Bose gas theory, even approaching the quasi-condensate regime.

Title: Elastic Plateau-Rayleigh instability in soft cylinders: Surface elasticity and periodic beading
Authors: F. Magni, D. Riccobelli
Abstract: The Plateau-Rayleigh instability shows that a cylindrical fluid flow can be destabilized by surface tension. Similarly, capillary forces can make an elastic cylinder unstable when the elastocapillary length is comparable to the cylinder's radius. While existing models predict a single isolated bulge as the result of an instability, experiments reveal a periodic sequence of bulges spaced out by thinned regions, a phenomenon known as beading instability. Most models assume that surface tension is independent of the deformation of the solid, neglecting variations due to surface stretch. In this work, we assume that surface tension arises from the deformation of material particles near the free surface, treating it as a pre-stretched elastic surface surrounding the body. Using the theoretical framework proposed by Gurtin and Murdoch, we show that a cylindrical solid can undergo a mechanical instability with a finite critical wavelength if the body is sufficiently soft or axially stretched. Post-buckling numerical simulations reveal a morphology in qualitative agreement with experimental observations. Period-halving secondary bifurcations are also observed. The results of this research have broad implications for soft materials, biomechanics, and microfabrication applications where surface tension plays a crucial role.

Title: Two key factors to superconductivity of Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates: enhanced quasi-particle weight and strong local spin fluctuation
Authors: Zhenfeng Ouyang, Rong-Qiang He, Zhong-Yi Lu
Abstract: By means of density functional theory plus dynamical mean-field theory, we systematically studies film bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ (2222-La327), hybrid monolayer-bilayer La$_5$Ni$_3$O$_{11}$ (1212-La5311), and La$_2$NiO$_4$ under doping or high-pressure conditions. We find that enhanced quasi-particle weights and local spin fluctuation of the Ni-$e_g$ orbitals are commonly realized by hole doping or high pressure in the known superconducting Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) nickelates, suggesting that they are key to the superconductivity. We also summarize experimentally synthesized RP nickelates into a phase diagram with local spin moment as a parameter, where phases of spin density wave/antiferromagnetism (SDW/AFM), superconductivity, and Fermi liquid are distinguished surprisingly. At last, we predict a promising candidate of superconducting RP nickelate, which is constructed in a ``bilayer-trilayer'' stacking sequence.

Title: Optimizing two-qubit gates for ultracold atoms using Fermi-Hubbard models
Authors: Juhi Singh, Jan A. P. Reuter, Tommaso Calarco, Felix Motzoi, Robert Zeier
Abstract: Ultracold atoms trapped in optical lattices have emerged as a scalable and promising platform for quantum simulation and computation. However, gate speeds remain a significant limitation for practical applications. In this work, we employ quantum optimal control to design fast, collision-based two-qubit gates within a superlattice based on a Fermi-Hubbard description, reaching errors in the range of $10^{-3}$ for realistic parameters. Numerically optimizing the lattice depths and the scattering length, we effectively manipulate hopping and interaction strengths intrinsic to the Fermi-Hubbard model. Our results provide five times shorter gate durations by allowing for higher energy bands in the optimization, suggesting that standard modeling with a two-band Fermi-Hubbard model is insufficient for describing the dynamics of fast gates and we find that four to six bands are required. Additionally, we achieve non-adiabatic gates by employing time-dependent lattice depths rather than using only fixed depths. The optimized control pulses not only maintain high efficacy in the presence of laser intensity and phase noise but also result in negligible inter-well couplings.

Title: Fine Spectrum from Crude Analytic Bootstrap
Authors: Jake Belton, Nadav Drukker, Ziwen Kong, Andreas Stergiou
Abstract: The magnetic line defect in the $O(N)$ model gives rise to a non-trivial one-dimensional defect conformal field theory of theoretical and experimental value. This model is considered here in $d=4-\varepsilon$ and the full spectrum of defect operators with dimensions close to one, two and three at order $\varepsilon$ is presented. The spectrum of several classes of operators of dimension close to four and operators of large charge are also discussed. Analytic bootstrap techniques are used extensively, and efficient tools to deal with the unmixing of nearly degenerate operators are developed. Integral identities are also incorporated, and it is shown that they lead to constraints on some three-point function coefficients and anomalous dimensions to order $\varepsilon^2$.

Title: Counting with the quantum alternating operator ansatz
Authors: Julien Drapeau, Shreya Banerjee, Stefanos Kourtis
Abstract: We introduce a variational algorithm based on the quantum alternating operator ansatz (QAOA) for the approximate solution of computationally hard counting problems. Our algorithm, dubbed VQCount, is based on the equivalence between random sampling and approximate counting and employs QAOA as a solution sampler. We first prove that VQCount improves upon previous work by reducing exponentially the number of samples needed to obtain an approximation within a multiplicative factor of the exact count. Using tensor network simulations, we then study the typical performance of VQCount with shallow circuits on synthetic instances of two #P-hard problems, positive #NAE3SAT and positive #1-in-3SAT. We employ the original quantum approximate optimization algorithm version of QAOA, as well as the Grover-mixer variant which guarantees a uniform solution probability distribution. We observe a tradeoff between QAOA success probability and sampling uniformity, which we exploit to achieve an exponential gain in efficiency over naive rejection sampling. Our results highlight the potential and limitations of variational algorithms for approximate counting.

Title: Bypassing eigenstate thermalization with experimentally accessible quantum dynamics
Authors: Amit Vikram
Abstract: Eigenstate thermalization has played a prominent role as a determiner of the validity of quantum statistical mechanics since von Neumann's early works on quantum ergodicity. However, its connection to the dynamical process of quantum thermalization relies sensitively on nondegeneracy properties of the energy spectrum, as well as detailed features of individual eigenstates that are effective only over correspondingly large timescales, rendering it generically inaccessible given practical timescales and finite experimental resources. Here, we introduce the notion of energy-band thermalization to address these limitations, which coarse-grains over energy level spacings with a finite energy resolution. We show that energy-band thermalization implies the thermalization of an observable in almost all physical states over accessible timescales without relying on microscopic properties of the energy eigenvalues or eigenstates, and conversely, can be efficiently accessed in experiments via the dynamics of a single initial state (for a given observable) with only polynomially many resources in the system size. This allows us to directly determine thermalization, including in the presence of conserved charges, from this state: Most strikingly, if an observable thermalizes in this initial state over a finite range of times, then it must thermalize in almost all physical initial states over all longer timescales. As applications, we derive a finite-time Mazur-Suzuki inequality for quantum transport with approximately conserved charges, and establish the thermalization of local observables over finite timescales in almost all accessible states in (generally inhomogeneous) dual-unitary quantum circuits. We also propose measurement protocols for general many-qubit systems. This work initiates a rigorous treatment of quantum thermalization in terms of experimentally accessible quantities.

Title: Fermionic Partial Transpose in the Overlap Matrix Framework for Entanglement Negativity
Authors: Jun Qi Fang, Xiao Yan Xu
Abstract: Over the past two decades, the overlap matrix approach has been developed to compute quantum entanglement in free-fermion systems, particularly to calculate entanglement entropy and entanglement negativity. This method involves the use of partial trace and partial transpose operations within the overlap matrix framework. However, previous studies have only considered the conventional partial transpose in fermionic systems, which does not account for fermionic anticommutation relations. Although the concept of a fermionic partial transpose was introduced in \cite{Shapourian2017prb}, it has not yet been systematically incorporated into the overlap matrix framework. In this paper, we introduce the fermionic partial transpose into the overlap matrix approach, provide a systematic analysis of the validity of partial trace and partial transpose operations, and derive an explicit formula for calculating entanglement negativity in bipartite systems. Additionally, we numerically compute the logarithmic negativity of two lattice models to verify the Gioev-Klich-Widom scaling law. For tripartite geometries, we uncover limitations of the overlap matrix method and demonstrate that the previously reported logarithmic negativity result for a homogeneous one-dimensional chain in a disjoint interval geometry exceeds its theoretical upper bound. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of partial trace and partial transpose operations in different representations.

Title: Non-positive energy quasidistributions in coherent collision models
Authors: Marco Pezzutto, Gabriele De Chiara, Stefano Gherardini
Abstract: We determine the Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobability (KDQ) distribution associated to the stochastic instances of internal energy variations for the quantum system and environment particles in coherent Markovian collision models. In the case the interactions between the quantum system and the particles do not conserve energy, the KDQ of the non-energy-preserving stochastic work is also derived. These KDQ distributions can account for non-commutativity, and return the unperturbed average values and variances for a generic interaction-time, and generic local initial states of the quantum system and environment particles. Using this nonequilibrium-physics approach, we certify the conditions under which the collision process of the model exhibits quantum traits, and we quantify the rate of energy exchanged by the quantum system by looking at the variance of the KDQ energy distributions. Finally, we propose an experimental test of our results on a superconducting quantum circuit implementing a qubit system, with microwave photons representing the environment particles.

Title: Cauchy-Schwarz bound on the accuracy of truncated models in non-relativistic quantum electrodynamics
Authors: Daniel Eyles, Adam Stokes, Ahsan Nazir
Abstract: We show that the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality provides a simple yet general bound that limits the accuracy of light-matter theories which retain only finite numbers of material energy levels. A corollary is that unitary rotations within a truncated space cannot transform between gauges, because the contrary assumption yields incorrect predictions. In particular, a widespread model obtained using such a rotation and treated as a Coulomb gauge model within a substantial body of literature, yields incorrect predictions under this assumption. The simplest system of a single dipole coupled to a single photonic mode in one spatial dimension is analysed in detail.

Title: Intersubband optical absorption in the GaN/AlN qunatum wire with donor-doping
Authors: Sami Ortakaya
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the optical absorption within the conduction-subbands of a cylindrical GaN/AlN quantum wire. We analyze the optical absorption rate and the real part of the dielectric function for both quantum wire (QWR) and quantum dot (QD) structures in the presence of donor-impurity states. The results cover that the density of states associated with free motion in the QWR structure leads to a lower optical absorption compared to the QDs, as evidenced by the optical spectra. This study advances the understanding of GaN/AlN heterostructures by offering a comprehensive analysis of the optical properties of QWRs and QDs, especially under donor-doping situation. As a result, the outcomes provide a clear evidence of the effect of semiconductor nanostructures on the optical properties of optoelectronic devices.

Title: Active magneto-mechanical metamaterial with the wave transmission and Poisson's ratio controlled via the magnetic field
Authors: K. K. Dudek, J.A. Iglesias Martínez, L. Hirsinger, M. Kadic, M. Devel
Abstract: In recent years, there has been a notable increase in the significance of active mechanical metamaterials capable of being remotely manipulated through changes in external stimuli. While research in this area has achieved considerable success in controlling reconfiguration to induce shape morphing or alter static mechanical properties, the active control of wave propagation within these systems remains largely unexplored. In this study, we propose a magneto-mechanical metamaterial that can be entirely governed by adjusting the magnitude and direction of an external magnetic field. We demonstrate that such a system offers remote control over its Poisson's ratio, allowing for transitions from strongly auxetic to positive Poisson's ratio configurations. Additionally, our system enables manipulation of the phononic band structure, facilitating the formation of complete band gaps across different frequency ranges depending on the stage of the magnetically guided reconfiguration process. The potential for achieving such active control over the properties and behavior of these materials holds great promise for various applications, including robotics and smart vibration dampers that can be remotely controlled.

Title: Observation of Topological Armchair Edge States in Photonic Biphenylene Network
Authors: Qi Zhong, Yongsheng Liang, Shiqi Xia, Daohong Song, Zhigang Chen
Abstract: Edge states in 2D materials are vital for advancements in spintronics, quantum computing, and logic transistors. For graphene nanoribbons, it is well known that the zigzag edges can host edge states, but realization of armchair edge states has been challenging without breaking the time-reversal symmetry. Here, by using a photonic analog of recently synthesized graphene-like biphenylene network (BPN), we demonstrate topological in-gap edge states particularly at the armchair edges. Interestingly, several bulk states preserve the characteristics of edge states along the armchair boundaries, manifesting an unusual hybridization between the edge and bulk states. Experimentally, we observe both zigzag and armchair edge states in photonic BPN lattices written in a nonlinear crystal. Furthermore, we clarify the different features of the armchair boundary between the BPN and graphene lattices. Our results demonstrated here may be applicable to carbon-based BPNs and other artificial platforms beyond photonics, holding promise for expanding the application scope of 2D materials.

Title: A quantum Monte Carlo algorithm for arbitrary high-spin Hamiltonians
Authors: Arman Babakhani, Lev Barash, Itay Hen
Abstract: We present a universal parameter-free quantum Monte Carlo algorithm for simulating arbitrary high-spin (spin greater than $1/2$) Hamiltonians. This approach extends a previously developed method by the authors for spin-$1/2$ Hamiltonians [Phys. Rev. Research 6, 013281 (2024)]. To demonstrate its applicability and versatility, we apply our method to the spin-$1$ and spin-$3/2$ quantum Heisenberg models on the square lattice. Additionally, we detail how the approach naturally extends to general Hamiltonians involving mixtures of particle species, including bosons and fermions. We have made our program code freely accessible on GitHub.

Title: Phase-matching of high harmonic generation in twisted solids
Authors: Chenjun Ma, Chen Huang, Yilong You, Huazhan Liu, Zhitong Ding, Mingchao Ding, Jin Zhang, Guixin Li, Zhipei Sun, Shiwei Wu, Chaojie Ma, Enge Wang, Hao Hong, Kaihui Liu
Abstract: High harmonic generation (HHG) in solids could enable attosecond and ultraviolet light sources with high compactness, great controllability and rich functions. However, the HHG process is accompanied by a quite large wavevector mismatch that is uncompensated by any traditional phase-matching method, directly limiting its energy conversion efficiency. Here, we propose an effective strategy for phase-matching of HHG with arbitrary harmonic orders in solids. Two flakes of solids with an interlayer twist induce a nonlinear optical phase that depends on the crystal symmetry, twist angle and harmonic order, which can be accurately designed to compensate for the phase mismatch in HHG. Guided by the twist-phase-matching theory, we achieved a record-high conversion efficiency of $~1.5\times10^{-5}$ for the fifth HHG in twisted hexagonal boron nitride crystals with a total thickness of only 1 ${\mu}m$. Our work establishes a foundation for developing ultrashort-wavelength and ultrafast-pulse laser sources in compact solid-state tabletop systems for fundamental and applied sciences.

Title: Freezing chaos without synaptic plasticity
Authors: Weizhong Huang, Haiping Huang
Abstract: Chaos is ubiquitous in high-dimensional neural dynamics. A strong chaotic fluctuation may be harmful to information processing. A traditional way to mitigate this issue is to introduce Hebbian plasticity, which can stabilize the dynamics. Here, we introduce another distinct way without synaptic plasticity. An Onsager reaction term due to the feedback of the neuron itself is added to the vanilla recurrent dynamics, making the driving force a gradient form. The original unstable fixed points supporting the chaotic fluctuation can then be approached by further decreasing the kinetic energy of the dynamics. We show that this freezing effect also holds in more biologically realistic networks, such as those composed of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. The gradient dynamics are also useful for computational tasks such as recalling or predicting external time-dependent stimuli.

Title: Non-hermitian integrable systems from constant non-invertible solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation
Authors: Somnath Maity, Pramod Padmanabhan, Vladimir Korepin
Abstract: We construct invertible spectral parameter dependent Yang-Baxter solutions ($R$-matrices) by Baxterizing constant non-invertible Yang-Baxter solutions. The solutions are algebraic (representation independent). They are constructed using supersymmetry (SUSY) algebras. The resulting $R$-matrices are regular leading to local non-hermitian Hamiltonians written in terms of the SUSY generators. As particular examples we Baxterize the $4\times 4$ constant non-invertible solutions of Hietarinta leading to nearest-neighbor Hamiltonians. On comparing with the literature we find two of the models are new. Apart from being non-hermitian, many of them are also non-diagonalizable with interesting spectrums. With appropriate representations of the SUSY generators we obtain spin chains in all local Hilbert space dimensions.

Title: Sisyphus random walks in the presence of moving traps
Authors: Shahar Hod
Abstract: It has recently been proved that, in the presence of a static absorbing trap, Sisyphus random walkers with a restart mechanism are characterized by {\it exponentially} decreasing asymptotic survival probability functions. Interestingly, in the present compact paper we prove analytically that, in the presence of a moving trap whose velocity approaches zero asymptotically in time as $v_{\text{trap}}\sim 1/t$, the survival probabilities of the Sisyphus walkers are dramatically changed into inverse {\it power-law} decaying tails.

Title: Rayleigh-B{é}nard Convection with Phase Change Close to the Critical Point
Authors: Valentin Mouet (LPENS, PSL, CNRS, SU), Guillaume Michel (SU, CNRS, DALEMBERT), François Pétrélis (LPENS, PSL, CNRS, SU), Stephan Fauve (LPENS, PSL, CNRS, SU)
Abstract: Rayleigh-B{é}nard convection is investigated with sulfur hexafluoride (SF$_6$) in the vicinity of its critical point. In the supercritical domain, direct measurements of the heat flux $Q$ as a function of the temperature difference $\Delta T$ are consistent with the usual scaling laws of single-phase turbulent convection. Along the liquid-vapor coexistence curve, heat fluxes are dramatically enhanced by condensation and boiling. Optical measurements are performed to document the size and velocity of the bubbles. We report $Q(\Delta T, \epsilon)$ in both domains, with $\epsilon$ the dimensionless distance to the critical point. Critical scaling laws are observed that can guide the development of theoretical models. In addition, this documents a system of diverging heat transfer coefficient, i.e., in which a significant heat flux can be achieved with an arbitrarily small temperature difference as $\epsilon\to 0$.

Title: To Use or Not to Use a Universal Force Field
Authors: Denan Li, Jiyuan Yang, Xiangkai Chen, Lintao Yu, Shi Liu
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing scientific research, particularly in computational materials science, by enabling more accurate and efficient simulations. Machine learning force fields (MLFFs) have emerged as powerful tools for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, potentially offering quantum-mechanical accuracy with the efficiency of classical MD. This Perspective evaluates the viability of universal MLFFs for simulating complex materials systems from the standpoint of a potential practitioner. Using the temperature-driven ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transition of PbTiO$_3$ as a benchmark, we assess leading universal force fields, including CHGNet, MACE, M3GNet, and GPTFF, alongside specialized models like UniPero. While universal MLFFs trained on PBE-derived datasets perform well in predicting equilibrium properties, they largely fail to capture realistic finite-temperature phase transitions under constant-pressure MD, often exhibiting unphysical instabilities. These shortcomings stem from inherited biases in exchange-correlation functionals and limited generalization to anharmonic interactions governing dynamic behavior. However, fine-tuning universal models or employing system-specific MLFFs like UniPero successfully restores predictive accuracy. We advocates for hybrid approaches combining universal pretraining with targeted optimization, improved error quantification frameworks, and community-driven benchmarks to advance MLFFs as robust tools for computational materials discovery.

Title: Gyrotropic metamaterials with tailored magnetization
Authors: Nazar Pyvovar, Sadi Ayhan, Carl Pfeiffer, Igor Anisimov, Ilya Vitebskiy, Andrey A. Chabanov
Abstract: Magnetic materials are crucial in nonreciprocal electromagnetic devices, such as isolators, circulators, and nonreciprocal phase shifters. However, their use is often limited by the need for a uniform bias magnetic field and nonuniform demagnetizing fields, resulting in the restricted aperture of free-space devices, poor temperature stability, and incompatibility with magnetic field-sensitive applications. Alternative methods have been developed to achieve nonreciprocity using active, nonlinear, and time-varying metamaterials, each with its own advantages and limitations. Here, we present a new approach based on self-biased gyrotropic metamaterials composed of magnetically hard magnets (specifically NdFeB) embedded in a magnetically soft ferrite matrix. In this configuration, the NdFeB magnets provide the magnetic bias for the ferrite matrix, which produces a nonreciprocal response. This gyrotropic metamaterial can exhibit zero net magnetization while producing strong and uniform Faraday rotation over a broad temperature range. Without bias and demagnetizing fields, the aperture of this Faraday rotator can be virtually unlimited. Using this method, we demonstrate uniform 45-degree Faraday rotation and effective isolation across the microwave X-band.

Title: Geometric quantum drives: Hyperbolically driven quantum systems and beyond
Authors: Jihong Wu, Chuan Liu, Daniel Bulmash, Wen Wei Ho
Abstract: We present a geometrical construction of driven quantum systems, in which the position of a classical particle moving autonomously on a smooth connected manifold is used to steer a quantum Hamiltonian over time. This results in a time-dependent quantum Hamiltonian with a structured temporal profile and properties dependent on the local and global nature of the underlying choice of manifold. We explain how our construction recovers the well-known classes of periodically-driven and quasiperiodically-driven quantum systems, but also unveils fundamentally novel classes of quantum dynamics: by steering a quantum Hamiltonian using a classical particle freely moving on a compact 2d hyperbolic Riemann surface called the Bolza surface, we demonstrate an example of a hyperbolically driven quantum system. We show that fully gapped hyperbolically driven quantum systems in the adiabatic limit are topologically classified by a quantized dynamical response. We propose geometric quantum driving to be a general framework to chart the landscape of time-dependent quantum systems, which can be realized with time-dependent controls available in modern day quantum simulators.

Authors: V. I. Gerasimenko, I. V. Gapyak
Abstract: The article presents the concept of a cumulant representation for distribution functions describing the states of many-particle systems with topological nearest-neighbor interaction. A solution to the Cauchy problem for the hierarchy of nonlinear evolution equations for the cumulants of distribution functions of such systems is constructed. The connection between the constructed solution and the series expansion structure for a solution to the Cauchy problem of the BBGKY hierarchy has been established. Furthermore, the expansion structure for a solution to the Cauchy problem of the hierarchy of evolution equations for reduced observables of topologically interacting particles is established.

Title: Chemical reasoning in LLMs unlocks steerable synthesis planning and reaction mechanism elucidation
Authors: Andres M Bran, Theo A Neukomm, Daniel P Armstrong, Zlatko Jončev, Philippe Schwaller
Abstract: While machine learning algorithms have been shown to excel at specific chemical tasks, they have struggled to capture the strategic thinking that characterizes expert chemical reasoning, limiting their widespread adoption. Here we demonstrate that large language models (LLMs) can serve as powerful chemical reasoning engines when integrated with traditional search algorithms, enabling a new approach to computer-aided chemistry that mirrors human expert thinking. Rather than using LLMs to directly manipulate chemical structures, we leverage their ability to evaluate chemical strategies and guide search algorithms toward chemically meaningful solutions. We demonstrate this paradigm through two fundamental challenges: strategy-aware retrosynthetic planning and mechanism elucidation. In retrosynthetic planning, our method allows chemists to specify desired synthetic strategies in natural language to find routes that satisfy these constraints in vast searches. In mechanism elucidation, LLMs guide the search for plausible reaction mechanisms by combining chemical principles with systematic exploration. Our approach shows strong performance across diverse chemical tasks, with larger models demonstrating increasingly sophisticated chemical reasoning. Our approach establishes a new paradigm for computer-aided chemistry that combines the strategic understanding of LLMs with the precision of traditional chemical tools, opening possibilities for more intuitive and powerful chemical reasoning systems.

Title: Nonlinear Tripartite Coupling of Single Electrons on Solid Neon with Magnons in a Hybrid Quantum System
Authors: Xue-Feng Pan, Peng-Bo Li
Abstract: Coherent nonlinear tripartite interactions are critical for advancing quantum simulation and information processing in hybrid quantum systems, yet they remain experimentally challenging and still evade comprehensive exploration. Here, we predict a nonlinear tripartite coupling mechanism in a hybrid setup comprising a single electron trapped on a solid neon surface and a nearby micromagnet. The tripartite coupling here leverages the electron's intrinsic charge (motional) and spin degrees of freedom interacting with the magnon modes of the micromagnet. Thanks to the large spatial extent of the electron zero-point motion, we show that it is possible to obtain a tunable and strong spin-magnon-motion coupling at the single quantum level, with two phonons simultaneously interacting with a single spin and magnon excitation. This enables, for example, dissipative interactions between the electron's charge and spin degrees of freedom, permitting controlled phonon addition/subtraction in the electron's motional state and the preparation of steady-state non-Gaussian motional states. This protocol can be readily implemented with the well-developed techniques in electron traps and may open new avenues for general applications in quantum simulations and information processing based on strongly coupled hybrid quantum systems.

Title: Interplay of entanglement structures and stabilizer entropy in spin models
Authors: Michele Viscardi, Marcello Dalmonte, Alioscia Hamma, Emanuele Tirrito
Abstract: Understanding the interplay between nonstabilizerness and entanglement is crucial for uncovering the fundamental origins of quantum complexity. Recent studies have proposed entanglement spectral quantities, such as antiflatness of the entanglement spectrum and entanglement capacity, as effective complexity measures, establishing direct connections to stabilizer Rényi entropies. In this work, we systematically investigate quantum complexity across a diverse range of spin models, analyzing how entanglement structure and nonstabilizerness serve as distinctive signatures of quantum phases. By studying entanglement spectra and stabilizer entropy measures, we demonstrate that these quantities consistently differentiate between distinct phases of matter. Specifically, we provide a detailed analysis of spin chains including the XXZ model, the transverse-field XY model, its extension with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, as well as the Cluster Ising and Cluster XY models. Our findings reveal that entanglement spectral properties and magic-based measures serve as intertwined, robust indicators of quantum phase transitions, highlighting their significance in characterizing quantum complexity in many-body systems.

Abstract: Flux-tunable qubits and couplers are common components in superconducting quantum processors. However, dynamically controlling these elements via current pulses poses challenges due to distortions and transients in the propagating signals. In particular, long-time transients can persist, adversely affecting subsequent qubit control operations. We model the flux control line as a first-order RC circuit and introduce a class of pulses designed to mitigate long-time transients. We theoretically demonstrate the robustness of these pulses against parameter mischaracterization and provide experimental evidence of their effectiveness in mitigating transients when applied to a flux-tunable qubit coupler. The proposed pulse design offers a practical solution for mitigating long-time transients, enabling efficient and reliable experiment tune-ups without requiring detailed flux line characterization.

Title: Understanding and Mitigating Distribution Shifts For Machine Learning Force Fields
Authors: Tobias Kreiman, Aditi S. Krishnapriyan
Abstract: Machine Learning Force Fields (MLFFs) are a promising alternative to expensive ab initio quantum mechanical molecular simulations. Given the diversity of chemical spaces that are of interest and the cost of generating new data, it is important to understand how MLFFs generalize beyond their training distributions. In order to characterize and better understand distribution shifts in MLFFs, we conduct diagnostic experiments on chemical datasets, revealing common shifts that pose significant challenges, even for large foundation models trained on extensive data. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that current supervised training methods inadequately regularize MLFFs, resulting in overfitting and learning poor representations of out-of-distribution systems. We then propose two new methods as initial steps for mitigating distribution shifts for MLFFs. Our methods focus on test-time refinement strategies that incur minimal computational cost and do not use expensive ab initio reference labels. The first strategy, based on spectral graph theory, modifies the edges of test graphs to align with graph structures seen during training. Our second strategy improves representations for out-of-distribution systems at test-time by taking gradient steps using an auxiliary objective, such as a cheap physical prior. Our test-time refinement strategies significantly reduce errors on out-of-distribution systems, suggesting that MLFFs are capable of and can move towards modeling diverse chemical spaces, but are not being effectively trained to do so. Our experiments establish clear benchmarks for evaluating the generalization capabilities of the next generation of MLFFs. Our code is available at this https URL.

Title: Metallic quantum criticality enabled by flat bands in a kagome lattice
Authors: Lei Chen, Fang Xie, Shouvik Sur, Haoyu Hu, Silke Paschen, Jennifer Cano, Qimiao Si
Abstract: Strange metals arise in a variety of platforms for strongly correlated electrons, ranging from the cuprates, heavy fermions to flat band systems. Motivated by recent experiments in kagome metals, we study a Hubbard model on a kagome lattice whose noninteracting limit contains flat bands. A Kondo lattice description is constructed, in which the correlation effects are captured by symmetry preserving and exponentially localized molecular orbitals. These compact molecular orbitals represent the local degrees of freedom that emerge from topological flat bands. We identify a quantum critical point at which quasiparticles are lost and strange metallicity emerges. Our theoretical work opens up a new route for realizing beyond-Landau quantum criticality, as well as the associated strange metallicity and emergent quantum phases.

Title: X-type antiferromagnetic stacking for spintronics

Abstract: Physical phenomena in condensed matter normally arise from the collective effect of all atoms, while selectively addressing a lone atomic sublattice by external stimulus is elusive. The later functionality may, however, be useful for different applications due to a possible response being different from that occurring when the external stimulus affects the whole solid. Here, we introduce cross-chain antiferromagnets, where the stacking of two magnetic sublattices form a pattern of intersecting atomic chains, supportive to the sublattice selectivity. We dub this antiferromagnetic (AFM) stacking X-type and demonstrate that it reveals unique spin-dependent transport properties not present in conventional magnets. Based on high-throughput analyses and computations, we unveil three prototypes of X-type AFM stacking and identify 15 X-type AFM candidates. Using $\beta$-Fe$_{2}$PO$_{5}$ as a representative example, we predict the sublattice-selective spin-polarized transport driven by the X-type AFM stacking, where one magnetic sublattice is conducting, while the other is not. As a result, a spin torque can be exerted solely on a single sublattice, leading to unconventional ultrafast dynamics of the Nèel vector capable of deterministic switching of the AFM domains. Our work uncovers a previously overlooked type of magnetic moment stacking and reveals sublattice-selective physical properties promising for high-performance spintronic applications.

Title: Interaction quench of dipolar bosons in a one-dimensional optical lattice
Authors: Paolo Molignini, Barnali Chakrabarti
Abstract: A Tonks-Girardeau (TG) gas is a highly correlated quantum state of strongly interacting bosons confined to one dimension, where repulsive interactions make the particles behave like impenetrable fermions. By suddenly tuning these interactions to the attractive regime, it is possible to realize a super-Tonks-Girardeau (sTG) gas -- a highly excited, metastable state of strongly attractive bosons with unique stability properties. Inspired by the sTG quench scenario, we investigate a similar setup but with the inclusion of long-range dipolar interactions, which modify the system away from the TG Mott insulating limit. We simulate an interaction quench on dipolar bosons initially prepared in various states and fillings, using real-space densities, orbital occupations, Glauber correlation functions, and autocorrelation functions to probe post-quench stability. Our results reveal that stability is maintained only at very weak dipolar interaction strengths when starting from a unit-filled TG Mott state. In contrast, all cluster states -- whether unit-filled or doubly-filled -- eventually collapse under attractive interactions. This collapse is not always visible in the density profile but becomes apparent in the autocorrelation function, indicating complex many-body restructuring of the quantum state. Our findings underscore the potential of dipolar interactions to drive novel quantum dynamics and highlight the delicate balance required to stabilize excited states in long-range interacting systems.

Title: Layer-Dependent Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect in Rhombohedral Graphene
Authors: Zhaochen Liu, Jing Wang
Abstract: The quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect, first proposed in the Haldane model, is a paradigmatic example of the application of band topology in condensed matter physics. The recent experimental discoveries of high Chern number QAH effect in pentalayer and tetralayer rhombohedral graphene highlight the intriguing interplay between strong interactions and spin-orbit coupling (SOC). Here we propose a minimal interacting model for spin-orbit-coupled rhombohedral graphene and use the Hartree-Fock analysis to explore the phase diagram at charge neutrality. We find that with Ising SOC on one outmost graphene layer, the in-plane layer-antiferromagnetic order is the insulating ground state without displacement field. Upon increasing the gate displacement field, we find that the QAH state with Chern number being equal to the layer number emerges between layer-antiferromagnetic state and layer-polarized state, which is consistent with experimental observations. Remarkably, we study the phase diagram for different thicknesses and find pentalayer is optimal for the QAH effect. Finally, we propose that the QAH state is enlarged by engineering opposite Ising SOC on the opposite outmost layers of rhombohedral graphene. These results will facilitate the realization of QAH states in rhombohedral graphene with different thicknesses. Our work serves as a foundation for further exploration of correlated physics of insulating state in rhombohedral graphene.

Title: Tagged particle behavior in a harmonic chain of direction reversing active Brownian particles
Authors: Shashank Prakash, Urna Basu, Sanjib Sabhapandit
Abstract: We study the tagged particle dynamics in a harmonic chain of direction reversing active Brownian particles, with spring constant $k$, rotation diffusion coefficient $D_{\text{r}}$, and directional reversal rate $\gamma$. We exactly compute the tagged particle position variance for quenched and annealed initial orientations of the particles. For well-separated time scales, $k^{-1}$, $D_{\text{r}}^{-1}$ and $\gamma^{-1}$, the strength of spring constant $k$ relative to $D_{\text{r}}$ and $\gamma$ gives rise to different coupling limits and for each coupling limit there are short, intermediate, and long time regimes. In the thermodynamic limit, we show that, to the leading order, the tagged particle variance exhibits an algebraic growth $t^{\nu}$, where the value of the exponent $\nu$ depends on the specific regime. For a quenched initial orientation, the exponent $\nu$ crosses over from $3$ to $1/2$, via intermediate values $5/2$ or $1$, depending on the specific coupling limits. On the other hand, for the annealed initial orientation, $\nu$ crosses over from $2$ to $1/2$ via an intermediate value $3/2$ or $1$ for strong coupling limit and weak coupling limit respectively. An additional time scale $t_N=N^2/k$ emerges for a system with a finite number of oscillators $N$. We show that the behavior of the tagged particle variance across $t_N$ can be expressed in terms of a crossover scaling function, which we find exactly. Finally, we characterize the stationary state behavior of the separation between two consecutive particles by calculating the corresponding spatio-temporal correlation function.

Title: Typicality from concentration of measure in models with binary state variables
Authors: Nicolas Nessi
Abstract: We study the emergence of typicality in classical systems with a large number of binary state variables. We show analytically that for sufficiently large subsets of the complete state space, state functions which can be associated with macroscopic observables, such as density or energy, are sharply concentrated around a typical value, i.e., the vast majority of microscopic states show the same macroscopic behavior. From this static typicality result we obtain the dynamical counterpart, which states that if two initial conditions are drawn from a sufficiently large subset of the state space, the dynamical trajectories of the macroscopic observables would be approximately the same, provided that the dynamics does not compress abruptly the size of sets of states under evolution. The ensuing dynamical typicality phenomenon is very similar to what was recently found in the context of the dynamics of isolated quantum systems. We illustrate and apply our analytical results by analyzing one-dimensional cellular automata.

Title: Hydrodynamics of a hard-core active lattice gas
Authors: Ritwik Mukherjee, Soumyabrata Saha, Tridib Sadhu, Abhishek Dhar, Sanjib Sabhapandit
Abstract: We present a fluctuating hydrodynamic description of an active lattice gas model with excluded volume interactions that exhibits motility-induced phase separation under appropriate conditions. For quasi-one dimension and higher, stability analysis of the noiseless hydrodynamics gives quantitative bounds on the phase boundary of the motility-induced phase separation in terms of spinodal and binodal. Inclusion of the multiplicative noise in the fluctuating hydrodynamics describes the exponentially decaying two-point correlations in the stationary-state homogeneous phase. Our hydrodynamic description and theoretical predictions based on it are in excellent agreement with our Monte Carlo simulations and pseudospectral iteration of the hydrodynamics equations. Our construction of hydrodynamics for this model is not suitable in strictly one-dimension with single-file constraints, and we argue that this breakdown is associated with micro-phase separation.

Title: Fermion-fermion interaction driven phase transitions in rhombohedral trilayer graphene
Authors: Qiao-Chu Zhang, Jing Wang
Abstract: The effects of short-range fermion-fermion interactions on the low-energy properties of rhombohedral trilayer graphene are comprehensively investigated using the momentum-shell renormalization group method. We take into account all one-loop corrections and establish the energy-dependent coupled evolutions of independent fermionic couplings that carry the physical information stemming from the interplay of various fermion-fermion interactions. With detailed numerical analysis, we observe that the ferocious competition among all fermion-fermion interactions can drive fermionic couplings to four distinct fixed points, dubbed $\textrm{FP}_{1}$, $\textrm{FP}_{2}$, $\textrm{FP}_{3}$, and $\textrm{FP}_{4}$, in the interaction-parameter space. These fixed points primarily dictate the fate of the system in the low-energy regime and are always associated with some instabilities characterized by specific symmetry breakings, leading to certain phase transitions. To determine the favorable states arising from the potential phase transitions, we introduce a number of fermion-bilinear source terms to characterize the underlying candidate states. By comparing their related susceptibilities, we find that the dominant states correspond to spin-singlet superconductivity, spin-triplet pair-density-waves, and spin-triplet superconductivity for fixed points $\textrm{FP}_{1,3}$, $\textrm{FP}_{2}$, and $\textrm{FP}_{4}$, respectively. These provide valuable insights into the low-energy properties of rhombohedral trilayer graphene and analogous materials.

Title: Emergence of topological states in relaxation dynamics of interacting bosons
Authors: Wang Huang, Xu-Chen Yang, Rui Cao, Ying-Hai Wu, Jianmin Yuan, Yongqiang Li
Abstract: Topological concepts have been employed to understand the ground states of many strongly correlated systems, but it is still quite unclear if and how topology manifests itself in the relaxation dynamics. Here we uncover emergent topological phenomena in the time evolution of far-from-equilibrium one-dimensional interacting bosons. Beginning with simple product states, the system evolves into long-time stationary states with high energy that are nonthermal for a wide range of parameters, and they exhibit nonlocal string correlation that is characteristic of the symmetry-protected topological ground state of the Hamiltonian. In contrast, no topological feature is found in the stationary state as long as the system thermalizes. This difference is further corroborated by the distinct behaviour of quantum entanglement and edge states of the system. Our theoretical prediction can be examined by current experimental techniques and paves the way for a more comprehensive understanding of topological phases in nonequilibrium settings.

Title: Scaling of the Integrated Quantum Metric in Disordered Topological Phases
Authors: Jorge Martínez Romeral, Aron W.Cummings, Stephan Roche
Abstract: We report a study of a disorder-dependent real-space representation of the quantum geometry in topological systems. Thanks to the development of an efficient linear-scaling numerical methodology based on the kernel polynomial method, we can explore nontrivial behavior of the integrated quantum metric and Chern number in disordered systems with sizes reaching the experimental scale. We illustrate this approach in the disordered Haldane model, examining the impact of Anderson disorder and vacancies on the trivial and topological phases captured by this model.

Title: Quantum rotor in a two-dimensional mesoscopic Bose gas
Authors: Michał Suchorowski, Alina Badamshina, Mikhail Lemeshko, Michał Tomza, Artem G. Volosniev
Abstract: We investigate a molecular quantum rotor in a two-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate. The focus is on studying the angulon quasiparticle concept in the crossover from few- to many-body physics. To this end, we formulate the problem in real space and solve it with a mean-field approach in the frame co-rotating with the impurity. We show that the system starts to feature angulon characteristics when the size of the bosonic cloud is large enough to screen the rotor. More importantly, we demonstrate the departure from the angulon picture for large system sizes or large angular momenta where the properties of the system are determined by collective excitations of the Bose gas.

Title: Real-Time Out-of-Equilibrium Quantum Dynamics in Disordered Materials
Authors: Luis M. Canonico, Stephan Roche, Aron W. Cummings
Abstract: We report a linear-scaling numerical method for exploring nonequilibrium electron dynamics in systems of arbitrary complexity. Based on the Chebyshev expansion of the time evolution of the single-particle density matrix, the method gives access to nonperturbative excitation and relaxation phenomena in models of disordered materials with sizes on the experimental scale. After validating the method by applying it to saturable optical absorption in clean graphene, we uncover that disorder can enhance absorption in graphene and that the interplay between light, anisotropy, and disorder in nanoporous graphene might be appealing for sensing applications. Beyond the optical properties of graphene-like materials, the method can be applied to a wide range of large-area materials and systems with arbitrary descriptions of defects and disorder.

Title: Hedgehog topological defects in 3D amorphous solids
Authors: Arabinda Bera, Alessio Zaccone, Matteo Baggioli
Abstract: The underlying structural disorder renders the concept of topological defects in amorphous solids difficult to apply and hinders a first-principle identification of the microscopic carriers of plasticity and of the regions more prone to structural rearrangements (``soft spots''). Recently, it has been proposed that well-defined topological defects can still be identified in glasses, and correlated to local and global plasticity, by looking at the eigenvector field or the particle displacement field. Nevertheless, all the existing proposals and analyses are only valid in two spatial dimensions. In this work, we propose the idea of using hedgehog topological defects to characterize the plasticity of 3D glasses and to geometrically predict the location of their soft spots. We corroborate our proposal by simulating a Kremer-Grest 3D polymer glass, and by using both the normal mode eigenvector field and the displacement field around large plastic events. Contrary to the 2D case, the sign of the topological charge defined from the eigenvector field is ambiguous and the geometry of the topological defects, whether radial or hyperbolic, plays a fundamental role in 3D. In fact, we find that the topological hedgehog defects relevant for plasticity are those exhibiting hyperbolic geometry, resembling the saddle-point structure of 2D topological defects with negative winding number (anti-vortices). Our results confirm that a topological characterization of plasticity in glasses is feasible and provide a concrete realization of this program in 3D amorphous systems.

Title: Shockwave-Enhanced Floquet Engineering in Relativistic Quasiparticles
Authors: Takashi Oka
Abstract: We investigate Floquet engineering of three-dimensional Dirac fermions driven by propagating waves, identifying distinct quantum states and phase transitions in the time-like, light-like, and space-like regimes. Notably, we uncover a novel regime where Floquet Weyl bands emerge and transition into Type-II Weyl states as the wave speed nears the Fermi velocity. Using Floquet-Bloch theory, we demonstrate that Lorentz contraction strongly amplifies Floquet band modulation effects, leading to a shockwave-like state synchronized with the wave motion. These findings extend beyond electrons to quasiparticles with relativistic dispersions, opening new avenues for dynamic band engineering in quantum materials.

Title: Competition between dimerization and vector chirality in the spin-$3/2$ $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg chain with uniaxial single-ion anisotropy
Authors: Ji-Lu He, Sebastian Eggert, Haiqing Lin, Xiaoqun Wang, Shi-Jie Hu
Abstract: The spin-$3/2$ chain is a versatile prototypical platform for the study of competition between different kinds of magnetic orders, with the objective of obtaining a deeper understanding of the corresponding quantum phase transitions. In this work, we investigate the spin-$3/2$ chain with nearest-neighbor $J_1$, next-nearest-neighbor $J_2$, and uniaxial single-ion anisotropy $D$ terms in the absence of a magnetic field. For positive values of $J_2/J_1$ and $D/J_1$, we find seven different phases in a rich phase diagram. Without frustration $J_2=0$, a gapless Luttinger liquid phase remains stable for all $D>0$. As $J_2$ increases, we observe three phases with distinct dimerized valence bond orders, which show an intricate competition with vector chiral order and incommensurate correlations. For large $J_2$, regions of phase coexistence between the dimerized and vector chiral orders emerge. We present large-scale numerical data for the determination of transition lines, order parameters, and the nature of the phase transitions.

Title: Fingerprints of supersymmetric spin and charge dynamics observed by inelastic neutron scattering

Abstract: Supersymmetry is an algebraic property of a quantum Hamiltonian that, by giving every boson a fermionic superpartner and vice versa, may underpin physics beyond the Standard Model. Fractional bosonic and fermionic quasiparticles are familiar in condensed matter, as in the spin and charge excitations of the $t$-$J$ model describing electron dynamics in one-dimensional materials, but this type of symmetry is almost unknown. However, the triplet excitations of a quantum spin ladder in an applied magnetic field provide a supersymmetric analogue of the $t$-$J$ chain. Here we perform neutron spectroscopy on the spin-ladder compounds (C$_5$D$_{12}$N)$_2$CuBr$_4$ and (C$_5$D$_{12}$N)$_2$CuCl$_4$ over a range of applied fields and temperatures, and apply matrix-product-state methods to the ladder and equivalent chain models. From the momentum-resolved dynamics of a single charge-like excitation in a bath of fractional spins, we find essential differences in thermal broadening between the supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric sectors. The persistence of a strict zone-centre pole at all temperatures constitutes an observable consequence of supersymmetry that marks the beginning of supersymmetric studies in experimental condensed matter.

Authors: F. Ahrens, N. Crescini, A. Irace, G. Rastelli, P. Falferi, A. Giachero, B. Margesin, R. Mezzena, A. Vinante, I. Carusotto, F. Mantegazzini
Abstract: Frequency-based synthetic dimensions are a promising avenue to extend the dimensionality of photonic systems. In this work, we show how a tilted synthetic lattice is naturally realised by periodically modulating a single-mode resonator under a coherent monochromatic drive. We theoretically study the Bloch wave dynamics in the tilted synthetic lattice, which gives rise to peculiar features in the spectral distribution of the cavity field. Our predictions are experimentally confirmed using a planar tunable superconducting microwave resonator.

Title: Classical $\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquid on the generalized four-color Kitaev model
Authors: Han Yan, Rico Pohle
Abstract: While $U$(1) spin liquids have been extensively studied in both quantum and classical regimes, exact classical $\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquids arising from models with nearest-neighbor, bilinear spin interactions are still rare. In this Letter, we explore the four-color Kitaev model as a minimal model for stabilizing classical $\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquids across a broad family of tricoordinated lattices. By formulating a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory, we identify this spin liquid as being described by an emergent Gauss's law with effective charge-2 condensation, and deconfined fractionalized bond-charge excitations. We complement our findings with Monte Carlo simulations, revealing a crossover from a high-temperature paramagnet to a low-temperature liquid phase characterized by residual entropy, classical $\mathbb{Z}_2$ flux order, and diffuse spin structure factors.

Title: On the topology of solutions to random continuous constraint satisfaction problems
Authors: Jaron Kent-Dobias
Abstract: We consider the set of solutions to $M$ random polynomial equations whose $N$ variables are restricted to the $(N-1)$-sphere. Each equation has independent Gaussian coefficients and a target value $V_0$. When solutions exist, they form a manifold. We compute the average Euler characteristic of this manifold in the limit of large $N$, and find different behavior depending on the target value $V_0$, the ratio $\alpha=M/N$, and the variances of the coefficients. We divide this behavior into five phases with different implications for the topology of the solution manifold. When $M=1$ there is a correspondence between this problem and level sets of the energy in the spherical spin glasses. We conjecture that the transition energy dividing two of the topological phases corresponds to the energy asymptotically reached by gradient descent from a random initial condition, possibly resolving an open problem in out-of-equilibrium dynamics. However, the quality of the available data leaves the question open for now.

Title: Pulsed magnetic field gradient on a tip for nanoscale imaging of spins
Authors: Leora Schein-Lubomirsky, Yarden Mazor, Rainer Stöhr, Andrej Denisenko, Amit Finkler
Abstract: Nanoscale magnetic resonance imaging (nanoMRI) aims at obtaining structure at the single molecule level. Most of the techniques for effecting a nanoMRI gradient use small permanent magnets. Here, we present a switchable magnetic field gradient on a tip, which is designed to provide a local and controllable magnetic field with a high gradient on the nanometer scale. We incorporate the gradient field with a nanoscale magnetic resonance sensor, a single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond, to provide high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging. The device is a metal microwire deposited along a quartz tip, with the current flowing along the tip inducing a magnetic field around its apex. This field can be manipulated throughout a measurement by controlling the current along the wire. We achieved gradients as high as 1 $\mathrm{\mu}\text{T/nm}$ at fields weaker than 200 $\mathrm{\mu}\text{T}$. Such a gradient can facilitate electron spin mapping with 1 nm resolution using single NV sensors, allowing for nanoscale imaging of electrons. The ability to switch the current on and off and to position the device with high precision overcomes limitations such as limited emitter contrast and the flexibility in sample preparation. Moreover, we show that proximity of the metallic tip to the sensor modifies the Rabi power in a spatially dependent manner, providing regions with enhanced ($\times$3.5) and decreased Rabi power. This spatial gradient, induced by the tip, offers the opportunity for selective pulses on nearby spin species where the same microwave power will result in different spin manipulation characteristics.

Title: Anomalous Order in $R_3\text{Ni}_{30}\text{B}_{10}$ $(R = \text{La}, \text{Ce})$
Authors: Maximilien F. Debbas, Takehito Suzuki, Joseph G. Checkelsky
Abstract: We report the synthesis of single crystals of the $R_3\text{Ni}_{30}\text{B}_{10}$ $(R = \text{La}, \text{Ce})$ system which realizes the tetragonal $P4/nmm$ (No. 129) space group. We performed single crystal, transmission X-ray diffraction measurements to determine the crystal structure. Additionally, we characterized the samples through magnetization, resistivity, and heat capacity measurements. The $R = \text{Ce}$ system exhibits mixed-valence states and we observe maxima in the heat capacity at $T_1^* = 6 \, \text{K}$ and $T_2^* = 2 \, \text{K}$ (both absent for $R = \text{La}$) with no corresponding features in the resistivity or magnetization. We discuss the potential roles of multipolar and short-ranged/partial order in connection to the $T_1^*$ anomalous order.

Title: Effective K Valley Hamiltonian for Twisted TMDs which Exhibit Pressure Dependent Topological Phase Transitions
Authors: Miftah Hadi Syahputra Anfa, Sabri Elatresh, Hocine Bahlouli, Michael Vogl
Abstract: Motivated by recent studies on topologically nontrivial moiré bands in twisted bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), we study twisted MoTe\textsubscript{2} bilayer systems subject to pressure, which is applied perpendicular to the material surface. We start our investigation by first considering untwisted bilayer systems with an arbitrary relative shift between layers; a symmetry analysis for this case permits us to obtain a simplified effective low-energy Hamiltonian valid near the important $\mathbf{K}$ valley region of the Brillouin zone. Ab initio density functional theory (DFT) was then employed to obtain relaxed geometric structures for pressures within the range of 0.0 - 3.5 GPa and corresponding band structures. The DFT data was then fitted to the low-energy Hamiltonian to obtain a pressure-dependent Hamiltonian. We then could model a twisted system by treating the twist as a position-dependent shift between layers. In summary, this approach allowed us to obtain the explicit analytical expressions for a Hamiltonian that describes a twisted MoTe\textsubscript{2} bilayer under pressure. Our Hamiltonian then permitted us to study the impact of pressure on the band topology of the twisted system. As a result, we identified many pressure-induced topological phase transitions as indicated by changes in valley Chern numbers. Moreover, we found that pressure could be employed to flatten bands in some of the cases we considered.

Title: Triplets of local minima in a high-dimensional random landscape: Correlations, clustering, and memoryless activated jumps
Authors: Alessandro Pacco, Alberto Rosso, Valentina Ros
Abstract: We compute the distribution of triplets of stationary points in the energy landscape of the spherical p-spin model, by evaluating the quenched three-point complexity by means of the Kac-Rice formalism. We show the occurrence of transitions in the organization of stationary points in the landscape, identifying regions where local minima and saddles accumulate and cluster around other stationary points, thus displaying the presence of correlations in the landscape. We discuss the implications of these findings for the dynamical exploration of the energy landscape in the activated regime, specifying conditions under which transitions between local minima are expected to exhibit correlated rates and when, conversely, activated jumps are likely to be memoryless.

Title: Adiabatic demagnetization refrigeration with antiferromagnetically ordered NaGdP$_2$O$_7$
Authors: P. Telang, T. Treu, M. Klinger, A. A. Tsirlin, P. Gegenwart, A. Jesche
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of the structural, magnetic, and thermodynamic properties, as well as the adiabatic demagnetization refrigeration (ADR) performance of NaGdP$_2$O$_7$. Although NaGdP$_2$O$_7$ exhibits antiferromagnetic ordering at a Néel temperature of $T_{\rm N} = 570$ mK in zero field, ADR experiments achieved a minimum temperature of 220 mK starting from $T = 2$ K under an applied magnetic field of $\mu_0H = 5$ T. The warm-up time back to $T = 2$ K exceeds 60 hours, which is roughly 50 times longer than that of its Yb-based analogue, underscoring the potential of NaGdP$_2$O$_7$ as an efficient precooling stage in double-stage ADR systems. We show that NaGdP$_2$O$_7$ can be seen as a network of ferromagnetic spin chains with antiferromagnetic interchain couplings and also investigate the influence of antiferromagnetic ordering on the magnetic entropy. We find that the temperature dependence of the entropy plays a more dominant role than its magnetic field dependence in the magnetically ordered state.

Title: Integrable fishnet circuits and Brownian solitons
Authors: Žiga Krajnik, Enej Ilievski, Tomaž Prosen, Benjamin J. A. Héry, Vincent Pasquier
Abstract: We introduce classical many-body dynamics on a one-dimensional lattice comprising local two-body maps arranged on discrete space-time mesh that serve as discretizations of Hamiltonian dynamics with arbitrarily time-varying coupling constants. Time evolution is generated by passing an auxiliary degree of freedom along the lattice, resulting in a `fishnet' circuit structure. We construct integrable circuits consisting of Yang-Baxter maps and demonstrate their general properties, using the Toda and anisotropic Landau-Lifschitz models as examples. Upon stochastically rescaling time, the dynamics is dominated by fluctuations and we observe solitons undergoing Brownian motion.

Title: Effective dimensional reduction of complex systems based on tensor networks
Authors: Wout Merbis, Madelon Geurts, Clélia de Mulatier, Philippe Corboz
Abstract: The exact treatment of Markovian models of complex systems requires knowledge of probability distributions exponentially large in the number of components $n$. Mean-field approximations provide an effective reduction in complexity of the models, requiring only a number of phase space variables polynomial in system size. However, this comes at the cost of losing accuracy close to critical points in the systems dynamics and an inability to capture correlations in the system. In this work, we introduce a tunable approximation scheme for Markovian spreading models on networks based on Matrix Product States (MPS). By controlling the bond dimensions of the MPS, we can investigate the effective dimensionality needed to accurately represent the exact $2^n$ dimensional steady-state distribution. We introduce the entanglement entropy as a measure of the compressibility of the system and find that it peaks just after the phase transition on the disordered side, in line with the intuition that more complex states are at the 'edge of chaos'. We compare the accuracy of the MPS with exact methods on different types of small random networks and with Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods for a simplified version of the railway network of the Netherlands with 55 nodes. The MPS provides a systematic way to tune the accuracy of the approximation by reducing the dimensionality of the systems state vector, leading to an improvement over second-order mean-field approximations for sufficiently large bond dimensions.

Title: Fermi Velocity Dependent Critical Current in Ballistic Bilayer Graphene Josephson Junctions
Authors: Amis Sharma, Chun-Chia Chen, Jordan McCourt, Mingi Kim, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Leonid Rokhinson, Gleb Finkelstein, Ivan Borzenets
Abstract: We perform transport measurements on proximitized, ballistic, bilayer graphene Josephson junctions (BGJJs) in the intermediate-to-long junction regime ($L>\xi$). We measure the device's differential resistance as a function of bias current and gate voltage for a range of different temperatures. The extracted critical current $I_{C}$ follows an exponential trend with temperature: $ \exp(-k_{B} T/ \delta E)$. Here $\delta E = \hbar \nu_F /2\pi L $: an expected trend for intermediate-to-long junctions. From $\delta E$, we determine the Fermi velocity of the bilayer graphene, which is found to increase with gate voltage. Simultaneously, we show the carrier density dependence of $\delta E$, which is attributed to the quadratic dispersion of bilayer graphene. This is in contrast to single layer graphene Josephson junctions, where $\delta E$ and the Fermi velocity are independent of the carrier density. The carrier density dependence in BGJJs allows for additional tuning parameters in graphene-based Josephson Junction devices.

Title: Nonflat bands and chiral symmetry in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene
Authors: Miguel Sánchez Sánchez, José González, Tobias Stauber
Abstract: In this work, we study an interacting tight-binding model of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG), with a twist angle of $1.05^\circ$. We derive effective theories based on a mean-field normal state at charge neutrality, thereby including the renormalizations coming from integrating out high-energy modes. In these theories, the flat bands display a sizable increase of the bandwidth, suggesting a renormalization of the magic angle. Additionally, the corresponding wavefunctions flow towards the limit of perfect particle-hole symmetry and sublattice polarization (the 'chiral' limit). We further represent the flat bands in the 'vortex Chern' basis and discuss the implications on the dynamics regarding the 'flat' and 'chiral' symmetries of MATBG, as manifested in the symmetry-broken states at neutrality.

Title: Nonequilibrium Green's Function Formalism Applicable to Discrete Impurities in Semiconductor Nanostructures
Authors: Nobuyuki Sano
Abstract: A new theoretical framework for the nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) scheme is presented to account for the discrete nature of impurities doped in semiconductor nanostructures. The short-range part of impurity potential is included as scattering potential in the self-energy due to spatially localized impurity scattering, and the long-range part of impurity potential is treated as the self-consistent Hartree potential by coupling with the Poisson equation. The position-dependent impurity scattering rate under inhomogeneous impurity profiles is systematically derived so that its physical meaning is clarified. The position dependence of the scattering rate turns out to be represented by the `center of mass' coordinates in the Wigner coordinates, rather than the real-space coordinates. Consequently, impurity scattering is intrinsically nonlocal in space. The proposed framework is applied to cylindrical thin wires under the quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) approximation. We show explicitly how the discrete nature of impurities affects the transport properties such as electrostatic potential, local density of states, carrier density, scattering rates, and mobility.

Title: Transition Metal-Vacancy Point Defects in Zinc Oxide as Deep-Level Spin Qubits
Authors: Shimin Zhang, Taejoon Park, Erik Perez, Kejun Li, Xingyi Wang, Yanyong Wang, Jorge D Vega Bazantes, Ruiqi Zhang, Jianwei Sun, Kai-Mei C. Fu, Hosung Seo, Yuan Ping
Abstract: Wide band gap oxides are promising host materials for spin defect qubits, offering unique advantages such as a dilute nuclear spin environment. Zinc oxide (ZnO), in particular, can achieve exceptional high purity, which enables long spin coherence time. In this work, we theoretically search for deep-level point defects in ZnO with optimal physical properties for optically-addressable spin qubits. Using first-principles calculations, we predict the Molybdenum-vacancy complex defect $Mo_{Zn}v_O$ in ZnO to own promising spin and optical properties, including spin-triplet ground state, optical transition in the visible to near-infrared range with high quantum yield, allowed intersystem crossings with a sizable optically-detected magnetic resonance contrast, and long spin T$_2$ and T$^*_2$. Notably, we find the Huang-Rhys factor of the defect to be around 5, which is significantly smaller than the typical range of 10-30 for most known defects in ZnO. Furthermore, we compare the spin decoherence driven by the nuclear spin bath and paramagnetic impurity baths. We find that the paramagnetic impurities are very effective in causing spin decoherence even with very low concentrations, implying that they can likely dominate the spin decoherence in ZnO even after isotopic purification. Using the computed excited-state energies and kinetic rates as inputs, we predict the ODMR contrast and propose a new protocol for spin qubit initialization and readout, which could be generalized to other systems with forbidden axial intersystem crossings.

Title: Spontaneous emergence of run-and-tumble-like dynamics in coupled self-propelled robots: experiment and theory
Authors: Somnath Paramanick, Umashankar Pardhi, Harsh Soni, Nitin Kumar
Abstract: Run-and-tumble (RT) motion is commonly observed in flagellated microswimmers, arising from synchronous and asynchronous flagellar beating. In addition to hydrodynamic interactions, mechanical coupling has recently been recognized to play a key role in flagellar synchronization. To explore this, we design a macroscopic model system that comprises dry, self-propelled robots linked by a rigid rod to model a biflagellated microorganism. To mimic a low Reynolds number environment, we program each robot to undergo overdamped active Brownian (AB) motion. We find that such a system exhibits RT-like behavior, characterized by sharp tumbles and exponentially distributed run times, consistent with real microswimmers. We quantify tumbling frequency and demonstrate its tunability across experimental parameters. Additionally, we provide a theoretical model that reproduces our results, elucidating physical mechanisms governing RT dynamics.

Title: Probing the many-body localized spin-glass phase through quench dynamics
Authors: Pietro Brighi, Marko Ljubotina, Maksym Serbyn
Abstract: Eigenstates of quantum many-body systems are often used to define phases of matter in and out of equilibrium; however, experimentally accessing highly excited eigenstates is a challenging task, calling for alternative strategies to dynamically probe nonequilibrium phases. In this work, we characterize the dynamical properties of a disordered spin chain, focusing on the spin-glass regime. Using tensor-network simulations, we observe oscillatory behavior of local expectation values and bipartite entanglement entropy. We explain these oscillations deep in the many-body localized spin glass regime via a simple theoretical model. From perturbation theory, we predict the timescales up to which our analytical description is valid and confirm it with numerical simulations. Finally, we study the correlation length dynamics, which, after a long-time plateau, resumes growing in line with renormalization group (RG) expectations. Our work suggests that RG predictions can be quantitatively tested against numerical simulations and experiments, potentially enabling microscopic descriptions of dynamical phases in large systems.

Title: Particle Geometry Space: An integrated characterization of particle shape, surface area, volume, specific surface, and size distribution
Authors: Priya Tripathi, Seung Jae Lee
Abstract: Particle size and shape are the key 3D particle geometry parameters that govern the complex behavior of granular materials. The effect of particle size and shape has often been examined in isolation, typically through separate analyses of particle size distribution (PSD) and shape distribution, leading to an unaddressed knowledge gap. Beyond size and shape, 3D particle geometry also includes attributes such as surface area and volume, which together defines the surface-area-to-volume ratio, commonly known as the specific surface. To comprehensively understand the influence of particle geometry on the behavior of granular materials, it is important to integrate these parameters, ideally into a single analytical framework. To this end, this paper presents a new approach, particle geometry space (PGS), formulated based on the principle that the key 3D particle geometry attributes - volume, surface area, and shape - can be uniformly expressed as a function of specific surface. The PGS not only encompasses all 3D particle geometry attributes but also extends its scope by integrating the conventional PSD concept. This innovation enables engineers and researchers who are already familiar with PSD to perform a more systematic characterization of 3D particle geometries. The paper (i) discusses the limitations of existing methods for characterizing 3D particle geometry, (ii) offers an overview of the PGS, (iii) proposes a method for integrating PSD into the PGS, and (iv) demonstrates its application with a set of 3D mineral particle geometry data.

Title: Z-basis measurements using mixed parity and direct readout
Authors: Pieter Thijs Eendebak, Önder Gül
Abstract: Many architectures for quantum information processing rely on qubits dedicated for the readout of a larger quantum register. These ancilla readout qubits present a physical overhead not contributing to the computational resource. A common implementation in spin qubit architectures is the readout schemes based on Pauli exclusion of charges confined in a double quantum dot, with one dot serving as the ancilla qubit. Here, using a three-qubit spin register and a Pauli exclusion-based readout, we present z-basis measurements of the entire register constructed with tomography, eliminating the physical overhead. We validate our approach with simulations which provide insight into potential sources of errors in the reconstruction. We also demonstrate our reconstruction by performing quantum state tomography on a GHZ state of a spin-qubit based device.

Title: A novel spectroscopic probe of ultrafast magnetization dynamics in the extreme ultraviolet spectral range
Authors: Johanna Richter, Somnath Jana, Robert Behrends, Carl S. Davies, Dieter W. Engel, Martin Hennecke, Daniel Schick, Clemens von Korff Schmising, Stefan Eisebitt
Abstract: The development of spectroscopic techniques in the extreme ultraviolet (XUV) spectral range has significantly advanced the understanding of ultrafast interactions in magnetic systems triggered by optical excitation. In this work, we introduce a previously missing geometry that facilitates the observation of the ultrafast magnetization dynamics of magnetic systems with an out-of-plane magnetization grown on XUV opaque substrates. This novel approach to probe ultrafast magnetization dynamics combines the magneto-optical Kerr effect with the strong dependence of a sample's reflectance near its Brewster angle. It therefore works with linearly polarized light and does not require any additional polarizing optics. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the technique by presenting both simulations and experimental data as a function of the energy and the polarization of the XUV probe radiation as well as of the delay time after optical excitation.

Title: Geometry and Mechanics of Non-Euclidean Curved-Crease Origami
Authors: Zhixuan Wen, Tian Yu, Fan Feng
Abstract: Recently there have been extensive theoretical, numerical and experimental works on curved-fold origami. However, we notice that a unified and complete geometric framework for describing the geometry and mechanics of curved-fold origami, especially those with nontrivial Gaussian curvature at the crease (non-Euclidean crease), is still absent. Herein we provide a unified geometric framework that describes the shape of a generic curved-fold origami composed of two general strips. The explicit description indicates that four configurations emerge, determined by its spatial crease and configuration branch. Within this geometric framework, we derive the equilibrium equations and study the mechanical response of the curved-crease origami, focusing on Euler's buckling behavior. Both linear stability analysis and finite element simulation indicate that the overlaid configuration exhibits a lower buckling threshold. To further capture the large deformation behavior efficiently, we develop a bistrip model based on the anisotropic Kirchhoff rod theory, which predicts the main features successfully. This work bridges the geometry and mechanics of curved-crease origami, offering insights for applications in robotics, actuators, and deployable space structures.

Title: The Orbital Angular Momentum of Azimuthal Spin-Waves
Authors: Thierry Valet, Kei Yamamoto, Benjamin Pigeau, Grégoire de Loubens, Olivier Klein
Abstract: In the context of a growing interdisciplinary interest in the angular momentum of wave fields, the spin-wave case has yet to be fully explored, with the extensively studied notion of spin transport being only part of the broader picture. Here we report experimental evidence for magnon orbital angular momentum, demonstrating that the mode exhibits rotation rather than remaining stationary. This conclusion is drawn from observations of the lifted degeneracy of waves with counter-rotating wave fronts. This requires an unambiguous formulation of spin and orbital angular momenta for spin waves, which we provide in full generality based on a systematic application of quantum field theory techniques. The results unequivocally establish magnetic dipole-dipole interactions as a magnetic-field controllable spin-orbit interaction for magnons. Our findings open a new research direction, leveraging the spectroscopic readability of angular momentum for azimuthal spin waves and other related systems.

Title: Field Theory of Linear Spin-Waves in Finite Textured Ferromagnets
Authors: Thierry Valet, Kei Yamamoto, Benjamin Pigeau, Grégoire de Loubens, Olivier Klein
Abstract: In the context of an ever-expanding experimental and theoretical interest in the magnetization dynamics of mesoscopic magnetic structures, both in the classical and quantum regimes, we formulate a low energy field theory for the linear spin-waves in finite and textured ferromagnets and we perform its constrained canonical quantization. The introduction of a manifestly gauge invariant Lagrangian enables a straightforward application of the Noether's theorem. Taking advantage of this in the context of a broad class of axisymmetric ferromagnets of special conceptual and experimental relevance, a general expression of the conserved and quantized spin-wave total angular momentum is rigorously derived, while separate conservation and quantization of its orbital and spin components are established for a more restricted class of uniaxial exchange ferromagnets. Further particularizing this general framework to the case of axially saturated magnetic thin disks, we develop a semi-analytic theory of the low frequency part of the exchange-dipole azimuthal spin wave spectrum, providing a powerful theoretical platform for the analysis and interpretation of magnetic resonance experiments on magnetic microdots as further demonstrated in a joint paper [arxiv The Orbital Angular Momentum of Azimuthal Spin-Waves]

Mayorov, Konstantin S. Novoselov, Baigeng Wang, Kai Chang, Hongxin Yang, Lei Wang, Geliang Yu
Abstract: Introducing topologically protected skyrmions in graphene holds significant importance for developing high-speed, low-energy spintronic devices. Here, we present a centrosymmetric ferromagnetic graphene/trilayer Cr2Ge2Te6/graphene heterostructure, demonstrating the anomalous and topological Hall effect due to the magnetic proximity effect. Through gate voltage control, we effectively tune the emergence and size of skyrmions. Micromagnetic simulations reveal the formation of skyrmions and antiskyrmions, which respond differently to external magnetic fields, leading to oscillations in the topological Hall signal. Our findings provide a novel pathway for the formation and manipulation of skyrmions in centrosymmetric two-dimensional magnetic systems, offering significant insights for developing topological spintronics.

Title: Materials Map Integrating Experimental and Computational Data through Graph-Based Machine Learning for Enhanced Materials Discovery
Authors: Yusuke Hashimoto, Xue Jia, Hao Li, Takaaki Tomai
Abstract: Materials informatics (MI), which emerges from the integration of materials science and data science, is expected to greatly streamline the material discovery and development. The data used for MI are obtained from both computational and experimental studies, while their integration remains challenging. In our previous study, we reported the integration of these datasets by applying a machine learning model that captures trends hidden in the experimental datasets to compositional data stored in the computational database. In this study, we use the obtained data to construct materials maps, which visualize the relation in the structural features of materials, aiming to support study by the experimental researchers. The map is constructed using the MatDeepLearn (MDL) framework, which implements the graph-based representation of material structures, deep learning, and dimensional reduction for the map construction. We evaluate the obtained materials maps through statistical analysis and found that the MDL using message passing neural network (MPNN) enables efficient extraction of features that reflect the structural complexity of materials. Moreover, we found that this advantage does not necessarily translate into improved accuracy in predicting material properties. We attribute this unexpected outcome to the high learning performance inherent in MPNN, which can contribute to the structuring of data points within the materials map.

Title: Stability of Objective Structures: General Criteria and Applications
Authors: Bernd Schmidt, Martin Steinbach
Abstract: We develop a general stability analysis for objective structures, which constitute a far reaching generalization of crystal lattice systems. We show that these particle systems, although in general neither periodic nor space filling, allow for the identification of stability constants in terms of representations of the underlying symmetry group and interaction potentials. Our main results provide general stability criteria and second order energy bounds for equilibrium configurations. In particular, a general computational algorithm to test objective structures for their stability is derived. By way of example we show that our method can be applied to verify the stability of carbon nanotubes with chirality.

Title: Quantum Computer-Based Verification of Quantum Thermodynamic Uncertainty Relation
Authors: Nobumasa Ishida, Yoshihiko Hasegawa
Abstract: Quantum thermodynamic uncertainty relations reveal fundamental trade-offs between precision and thermodynamic quantities, yet their empirical verification remains limited. We present an approach using quantum computers to verify a general quantum thermodynamic uncertainty relation. Our method, which implements quantum dynamics on physical qubits, enables us to investigate the measurability of relevant quantities, the relation's validity under physical noise, and its empirical tightness. Specifically, quantum computers' versatility allows for the examination of arbitrary observables. We address current quantum processor limitations through a three-fold strategy: generalizing the relation to generic observables under arbitrary quantum channels, proposing a method to measure the target thermodynamic quantity (survival activity) in the weak coupling regime, and reducing circuit depth by leveraging relation properties. Demonstrations on IBM's cloud-based quantum processor validate our relation in open qubit systems and achieve saturation with an optimal observable requiring entangled measurements. The relation is further verified in a quantum time correlator measurement protocol, confirming the broad applicability of our method. This study highlights the potential of noisy quantum computers for demonstrating quantum thermodynamic trade-offs.

Title: Linear-T Resistivity from Spatially Random Vector Coupling
Authors: Yi-Li Wang, Xian-Hui Ge, Sang-Jin Sin
Abstract: Recently, Patel et al. introduced a higher dimensional version of the SYK model with random coupling in a Yukawa interaction to find the linear-$T$ resistivity. We test the universality of the mechanism by replacing the scalar field with a vector field in various dimensions. We find that it works for vector and scalar interactions, although the details are largely different. However, this mechanism for the linear-$T$ resistivity works only in $(2+1)$ dimensions and not in higher dimensions, regardless of the interaction type. Based on these results, we explore the rôle of spatial random disorder and find a simple explanation of how such random scattering converts the Fermi liquid to a strange metal by changing the self-energies of the involved bosons and fermions.

Title: Dynamic thermalization on noisy quantum hardware
Authors: H. Perrin, T. Scoquart, A. I. Pavlov, N. V. Gnezdilov
Abstract: Emulating thermal observables on a digital quantum computer is essential for quantum simulation of many-body physics. However, thermalization typically requires a large system size due to incorporating a thermal bath, whilst limited resources of near-term digital quantum processors allow for simulating relatively small systems. We show that thermal observables and fluctuations may be obtained for a small closed system without a thermal bath. Thermal observables occur upon classically averaging quantum mechanical observables over randomized variants of their time evolution that run independently on a digital quantum processor. Using an IBM quantum computer, we experimentally find thermal occupation probabilities with finite positive and negative temperatures defined by the initial state's energy. Averaging over random evolutions facilitates error mitigation, with the noise contributing to the temperature in the simulated observables. This result fosters probing the dynamical emergence of equilibrium properties of matter at finite temperatures on noisy intermediate-scale quantum hardware.

Title: Many-Body Open Quantum Systems
Authors: Rosario Fazio, Jonathan Keeling, Leonardo Mazza, Marco Schirò
Abstract: These Lecture Notes discuss the recent theoretical advances in the understanding of open quantum many-body physics in platforms where both dissipative and coherent processes can be tuned and controlled to a high degree. We start by reviewing the theoretical frameworks and methods used to describe and tackle open quantum many-body systems. We then discuss the use of dissipative processes to engineer many-body stationary states with desired properties and the emergence of dissipative phase transitions arising out of the competition between coherent evolution and dissipation. We review the dynamics of open quantum many body systems in the presence of correlated many-body dissipative processes, such as heating and many-body losses. Finally we provide a different perspective on open quantum many-body systems by looking at stochastic quantum trajectories, relevant for the case in which the environment represents a monitoring device, and the associated measurement-induced phase transitions.

Title: Color symmetry breaking in the Potts spin glass
Authors: Jean-Christophe Mourrat
Abstract: The Potts spin glass is an analogue of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model in which each spin can take one of $\kappa$ possible values, which we interpret as colors. It was suggested in arXiv:2310.06745 that the order parameter for this model is always invariant with respect to permutations of the colors. We show here that this is false whenever $\kappa \ge 58$.

Title: Simulation of the 1d XY model on a quantum computer
Authors: Marc Farreras, Alba Cervera-Lierta
Abstract: The field of quantum computing has grown fast in recent years, both in theoretical advancements and the practical construction of quantum computers. These computers were initially proposed, among other reasons, to efficiently simulate and comprehend the complexities of quantum physics. In this paper, we present a comprehensive scheme for the exact simulation of the 1-D XY model on a quantum computer. We successfully diagonalize the proposed Hamiltonian, enabling access to the complete energy spectrum. Furthermore, we propose a novel approach to design a quantum circuit to perform exact time evolution. Among all the possibilities this opens, we compute the ground and excited state energies for the symmetric XY model with spin chains of $n=4$ and $n=8$ spins. Further, we calculate the expected value of transverse magnetization for the ground state in the transverse Ising model. Both studies allow the observation of a quantum phase transition from an antiferromagnetic to a paramagnetic state. Additionally, we have simulated the time evolution of the state all spins up in the transverse Ising model. The scalability and high performance of our algorithm make it an ideal candidate for benchmarking purposes, while also laying the foundation for simulating other integrable models on quantum computers.

Title: Characterizing topological pumping of charges in exactly solvable Rice-Mele chains of the non-Hermitian variety
Authors: Ipsita Mandal
Abstract: We address the nature of the Thouless charge-pumping for a non-Hermitian (NH) generalization of the one-dimensional (1d) Rice-Mele model, considering a variety which allows closed-form analytical solutions for the eigensystems. The two-band system is subjected to an ``adiabatic'' time-periodic drive, which effectively gives us a closed two-dimensional (2d) manifold in the momentum-frequency space, mimicking a 2d Brillouin zone (BZ) for periodic boundary conditions. For open boundary conditions, we formulate the non-Bloch generalized Brillouin zone (GBZ). All these allow us to compute the Chern numbers of the 2d manifolds emerging for various parameter values, using the BZ or GBZ, which are well-defined integers in the gapped regions of the spectra. If Thouless pumping still holds for NH situations, the expectation values of the net displacement for the particles occupying a given band within a cycle, calculated using the right and left eigenvectors of a biorthogonal basis for the complex Hamiltonians, would coincide with the Chern numbers. However, we find that there are deviations from the expected quantized values whenever the spectra exhibit strongly-fluctuating magnitudes of the imaginary parts of the (generically) complex eigenvalues. This implies that we need to address the question of how to meaningfully define time-evolution, as well as adiabaticity, in the context of NH systems.

Title: Entanglement entropy dynamics of non-Gaussian states in free boson systems: Random sampling approach
Authors: Ryui Kaneko, Daichi Kagamihara, Ippei Danshita
Abstract: We develop a random sampling method for calculating the time evolution of the Rényi entanglement entropy after a quantum quench from an insulating state in free boson systems. Because of the non-Gaussian nature of the initial state, calculating the Rényi entanglement entropy calls for the exponential cost of computing a matrix permanent. We numerically demonstrate that a simple random sampling method reduces the computational cost of a permanent; for an $N_{\mathrm{s}}\times N_{\mathrm{s}}$ matrix corresponding to $N_{\mathrm{s}}$ sites at half filling, the sampling cost becomes $\mathcal{O}(2^{\alpha N_{\mathrm{s}}})$ with a constant $\alpha\ll 1$, in contrast to the conventional algorithm with the $\mathcal{O}(2^{N_{\mathrm{s}}})$ number of summations requiring the exponential time cost. Although the computational cost is still exponential, this improvement allows us to obtain the entanglement entropy dynamics in free boson systems for more than $100$ sites. We present several examples of the entanglement entropy dynamics in low-dimensional free boson systems.

Title: Multiplexed readout of Superconductor--Normal-Conductor--Superconductor bolometers
Authors: Priyank Singh, András Gunyhó, Heikki Suominen, Giacomo Catto, Florian Blanchet, Qi-Ming Chen, Arman Alizadeh, Aarne Keränen, Jian Ma, Timm Mörstedt, Wei Liu, Mikko Möttonen
Abstract: Recently, ultrasensitive calorimeters have been proposed as a resource-efficient solution for multiplexed qubit readout in superconducting large-scale quantum processors. However, experiments demonstrating frequency multiplexing of these superconductor--normal--conductor--superconductor (SNS) sensors are are lacking in the literature. To this end, we present the design, fabrication, and operation of three SNS sensors with frequency-multiplexed input and probe circuits, all on a single chip. These devices have their probe frequencies in the range 150 MHz--200 MHz, which is well detuned from the heater frequencies of 4.4 GHz--7.6 GHz compatible with typical readout frequencies of superconducting qubits. Importantly, we show on-demand triggering of both individual and multiple low-noise SNS bolometers with very low cross talk. These experiments pave the way for multiplexed bolometric characterization and calorimetric readout of multiple qubits, a promising step in minimizing related resources such as the number of readout lines and microwave isolators in large-scale superconducting quantum computers.

Title: Exact solution for a class of quantum models of interacting bosons
Authors: Valery Shchesnovich
Abstract: Quantum models of interacting bosons have a wide range of applications, including the propagation of optical modes in nonlinear media, such as the $k$-photon down-conversion. Many of these models are related to nonlinear deformations of finite group algebras and, in this sense, are exactly solvable. While advanced group-theoretic methods were developed to study the eigenvalue spectrum, in quantum optics, the primary focus is not on the spectrum of the Hamiltonian but rather on the evolution of an initial state -- such as the generation of optical signal modes by a strong pump mode propagating through a nonlinear medium. I propose a simple and general method to solve the state evolution problem, applicable to a broad class of quantum models of interacting bosons. For the k-photon down-conversion model and its generalizations, the solution to the state evolution problem is expressed as an infinite series expansion in powers of the propagation time, with coefficients determined by a recursion relation involving only a single polynomial function. This polynomial function is unique to each nonlinear model. As an application, I compare the exact solution of the parametric down-conversion process with the semiclassical parametric approximation.

Title: Kramers-protected hardware-efficient error correction with Andreev spin qubits
Authors: Haoran Lu, Isidora Araya Day, Anton R. Akhmerov, Bernard van Heck, Valla Fatemi
Abstract: We propose an architecture for bit-flip error correction of Andreev spins that is protected by Kramers' degeneracy. Specifically, we show that a coupling network of linear inductors and Andreev spin qubits results in a static Hamiltonian composed of the stabilizers of a bit-flip code. The electrodynamics of the many-body spin states also respect these stabilizers, and we show how reflectometry off a single coupled resonator can thereby accomplish their projective measurement. We further show how circuit-mediated spin couplings enable error correction operations and a complete set of single- and two-module logical quantum gates. The concept, which we dub the Ising molecule qubit (or Isene), is experimentally feasible and provides a path for compact noise-biased qubits.

Title: Inductively coupled Josephson junctions: a platform for rich neuromorphic dynamics
Authors: G. Baxevanis, J. Hizanidis
Abstract: Josephson junctions (JJs) are by nature neuromorphic hardware devices capable of mimicking excitability and spiking dynamics. When coupled together or combined with other superconducting elements, they can emulate additional behaviors found in biological neurons. From a technological point of view, JJ-based neuromorphic systems are particularly appealing since they present THz-speed processing and they operate with near-zero power dissipation. In this work we study a system of inductively coupled JJs and focus on the nonlinear dynamical aspects of its neurocomputational properties. In particular, we report on spiking behavior related to a saddle-node off invariant cycle bifurcation and excitability type 2, synchronization, first spike latency effects, and multistability. Special emphasis is placed on the bursting dynamics the system is capable of reproducing, and a new underlying mechanism is proposed beyond the approach followed in prior works.

Title: An ultra-compact deterministic source of maximally entangled photon pairs

Abstract: We present an ultra-compact source of maximally entangled on-demand photon pairs. Our results are based on coupling of single GaAs quantum dots that are embedded in monolithic micro-lenses to a single-mode fiber with directly attached to 3D-printed micro-optics (NA of 0.6) inside a cryogenic environment. This approach, which is geared towards future integration into industrial environments, yields state-of-the-art entangled photon pair creation performance while retaining flexibility and adjustability required for long-term operation of such a device - all while dramatically reducing the overall system footprint. We demonstrate near diffraction-limited performance and hyperspectral imaging utilizing a 3D-printed micro-objective with a full width at half maximum resolution limit of 604(16) nm when operating the system at a cryogenic temperature of 3.8 K. Furthermore, we prove that this system can be used to achieve single photon emission rates of 392(20) kHz at a 76 MHz pump rate and purities of 99.2(5) % using two-photon resonant excitation. Utilizing the exciton-biexciton emission cascade available in GaAs quantum dots under resonant excitation, near maximally entangled photon pairs with peak entanglement negatives 2n of 0.96(2) in a 4 ps time window, and 0.81(1) when averaged over one exciton lifetime, are demonstrated.

Title: Unification of Stochastic and Quantum Thermodynamics in Scalar Field Theory via a Model with Brownian Thermostat
Authors: T. Koide, F. Nicacio
Abstract: We present a systematic procedure to derive a quantum master equation for thermal relaxation in real scalar field theory, expanding on the method proposed in [Koide and Nicacio, Phys. Lett. A494, 129277 (2024)]. We begin by introducing a generalized model for a classical scalar field interacting with a Brownian thermostat, consistent with stochastic thermodynamics. Applying canonical quantization to this model, we derive the corresponding quantum master equation, that is applicable to any form of the scalar field Hamiltonian. While its evolution is generally non-CPTP (Completely Positive and Trace-Preserving), it can be adjusted to describe a CPTP evolution, such as those found in the GKSL (Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad) equation by appropriately tuning the parameters of the model. In this framework, we define heat, work, and entropy in a way that satisfies the first and second laws of quantum thermodynamics. This suggests that the quantum-classical correspondence extends beyond closed systems governed by unitary time evolution to open systems as well. We further investigate the relation between the second law in quantum thermodynamics and relative entropy, providing insights into the study of quantum fluctuations through information-theoretical techniques in quantum field theory.

Title: Note on surface defects in multiscalar critical models
Authors: Andrii Anataichuk, Sabine Harribey
Abstract: This paper studies generic surface defects for multiscalar critical models using a perturbative $\epsilon$ expansion in $4-\epsilon$ dimensions. The beta functions of the defect couplings for a generic multiscalar bulk with quartic interactions are computed at first non-trivial order in $\epsilon$. Specific bulks of interest are then considered: $O(N)$, hypercubic, hypertetrahdral, and biconical $O(m)\times O(n)$. In each case, we compute fixed points for the defect couplings and determine the remaining bulk symmetry. Expanding beyond the $O(N)$ model, we find a greater variety of patterns of symmetry breaking.

Title: Lindblad many-body scars
Authors: Antonio M. García-García, Zhongling Lu, Lucas Sá, Jacobus J. M. Verbaarschot
Abstract: Quantum many-body scars have received much recent attention for being both intriguing non-ergodic states in otherwise quantum chaotic systems and promising candidates to encode quantum information efficiently. So far, these studies have mostly been restricted to Hermitian systems. Here, we study many-body scars in many-body quantum chaotic systems coupled to a Markovian bath, which we term Lindblad many-body scars. They are defined as simultaneous eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian and dissipative parts of the vectorized Liouvillian. Importantly, because their eigenvalues are purely real, they are not related to revivals. The number and nature of the scars depend on both the symmetry of the Hamiltonian and the choice of jump operators. For a dissipative four-body Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model with $N$ fermions, either Majorana or complex, we construct analytically some of these Lindblad scars while others could only be obtained numerically. As an example of the former, we identify $N/2+1$ scars for complex fermions due to the $U(1)$ symmetry of the model and two scars for Majorana fermions as a consequence of the parity symmetry. Similar results are obtained for a dissipative XXZ spin chain. We also characterize the physical properties of Lindblad scars. First, the operator size is independent of the disorder realization and has a vanishing variance. By contrast, the operator size for non-scarred states, believed to be quantum chaotic, is well described by a distribution centered around a specific size and a finite variance, which could be relevant for a precise definition of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis in dissipative quantum chaos. Moreover, the entanglement entropy of these scars has distinct features such as a strong dependence on the partition choice and, in certain cases, a large entanglement.

Title: Negative Local Partial Density of States
Authors: Kanchan Meena, Souvik Ghosh, P. Singha Deo
Abstract: Real quantum systems can exhibit a local object called local partial density of states (LPDOS) that cannot be proved within the axiomatic approach of quantum mechanics. We demonstrate that real mesoscopic system that can exhibit Fano resonances will show this object and also very counterintuitively it can become negative, resulting in the enhancement of coherent currents.
