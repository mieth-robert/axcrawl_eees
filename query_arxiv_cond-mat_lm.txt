Title: Stochastic Calculus Approach to Thermodynamics of Jump Processes
Authors: Lars Torbjørn Stutzer
Abstract: Stochastic thermodynamics is the field of study relating fluctuations in stochastic systems to thermodynamic quantities. The total entropy production (EP), is central to the thermodynamic classification of systems. Non-equilibrium systems manifestly all have non-zero EP and therefore impose an "arrow of time". Thermodynamic inequalities are lower bounds on the total EP and are especially useful when only parts of systems are operationally accessible. We use a stochastic calculus approach to directly derive and generalise three classes of inequalities for Markov jump processes using correlations of path observables, e.g., currents and densities. Our theoretical predictions are compared with simulations, where a good agreement is observed. The thermodynamic bounds we investigate include the thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR), thermodynamic transport bound (TB), and thermodynamic correlation bound (CB). We provide insight into the saturation conditions for these bounds and to what degree saturation can be achieved. Additionally, for the TUR and TB, we show how the bounds are related, which includes identifying a diffusion coefficient for jump dynamics. %An example using a toy model shows how the CB may yield a negative lower bound on the total entropy production, contrary to the non-negative bound that the TUR and TB yield. Comparisons are drawn between the TUR and TB for relaxation and stationary processes in biologically relevant settings. Specifically, calmodulin folding dynamics and secondary active transport, where differences in long-time relaxation and convergence are observed. For a systematic way to construct models, we formulate two methods to drive systems out of equilibrium without changing the stationary probability distribution.

Title: Quantum thermalization and the route to ergodicity
Authors: Amichay Vardi, Doron Cohen
Abstract: We consider a minimal model for quantum thermalization of coupled chaotic subsystems. The route towards ergodicity is explored as a function of the coupling strength. The results are contrasted with the predictions of standard Random Matrix Theory (RMT) and the Eigenstates Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH). We highlight a coupling regime of disparity between the spectral statistics that indicates chaos, and ergodicity measures that indicate lack of ETH thermalization. The analysis involves a revision of the energy shell concept, in a way that is consistent but independent of the semiclassical perspective.

Title: Topolectrical circuit theory and realizations of topological, non-linear, and non-Hermitian phenomena
Authors: Haydar Sahin
Abstract: Electrical circuits offer a unique platform to explore physical phenomena, from topology to non-Hermitian effects. Investigations of the fundamental properties of this metamaterial platform are crucial to distinguish observed/measured quantities from intrinsic circuit responses. In this thesis, we delve into the analysis of voltage and impedance responses and their role in unveiling complex dynamics and profound physical principles. We reveal that even the simplest one-dimensional circuits exhibit intriguing voltage profiles. Our study of multi-dimensional and multi-structural lattice models shows size-dependent impedance responses, which challenge our current textbook knowledge. Building on these insights, we will present non-linear and non-Hermitian circuit applications, showcasing how electrical circuits provide a suitable platform for realizing intriguing physical phenomena.

Title: High-magnitude, spatially variable, and sustained strain engineering of 2D semiconductors
Authors: Boran Kumral, Peter Serles, Pedro Guerra Demingos, Shuo Yang, Da Bin Kim, Dian Yu, Akhil Nair, Akshat Rastogi, Nima Barri, Md Akibul Islam, Jane Howe, Cristina H Amon, Sjoerd Hoogland, Edward H. Sargent, Chandra Veer Singh, Tobin Filleter
Abstract: Crystalline two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors often combine high elasticity and in-plane strength, making them ideal for strain-induced tuning of electronic characteristics, akin to strategies used in silicon electronics. However, current techniques fall short in achieving high-magnitude (>1%), spatially resolved, and stable strain in these materials. Here, we apply biaxial tensile strain up to 2.2%, with +/-0.12% resolution over micrometre-scale regions in monolayer MoS2 via conformal transfer onto patterned substrates fabricated using two-photon lithography. The induced strain is stable for months and enables local band gap tuning of ~0.4 eV in monolayer MoS2, ~25% of its intrinsic band gap. This represents a distinct demonstration of simultaneous high-magnitude, spatially resolved, and sustained strain in 2D monolayers. We further extend the approach to bilayer WS2-MoS2 heterostructures. This strain-engineering technique opens a new regime of strain-enabled control in 2D semiconductors to support the development of wide-spectrum optoelectronic devices and nanoelectronics with engineered electronic landscapes.

Title: Nematic and partially polarized phases in rhombohedral graphene with varying number of layers: An extensive Hartree-Fock Study
Authors: Guillermo Parra-Martínez, Alejandro Jimeno-Pozo, Jose Angel Silva-Guillén, Francisco Guinea
Abstract: Rhombohedral graphene systems with different number of layers feature an abundance of correlated phases and superconducting states in experimental measurements with different doping and displacement fields. Some of the superconducting pockets can emerge from - or close to - one of the correlated states. Therefore, studying the phase diagram of the correlated phases for varying number of layers could be useful to interpret the experimental observations. To achieve this, systematic Hartree-Fock calculations have been performed to build the phase diagram of rhombohedral (ABC-stacked) graphene for different number of layers, in the presence of long-range Coulomb interactions. By varying the external displacement field and carrier density, a cascade of metallic partially-isospin-polarized phases that spontaneously break spin and/or valley (flavor) symmetries is found. In addition, these states can present nematicity, stabilized by electron-electron interactions, exhibiting rich internal complexity. Polarized states are more stable for electron doping, and they are found for systems with up to 20 layers. Moreover, the tunability of the phase diagram via substrate screening and spin-orbit coupling proximity effects has been studied. Our results offer new insights into the role of correlations and symmetry breaking in graphitic systems which will motivate future experimental and theoretical works.

Title: Mean-field model for the bubble size distribution in coarsening wet foams
Authors: Jacob Morgan (1), Simon Cox (1) ((1) Department of Mathematics, Aberystwyth University, UK)
Abstract: Aqueous foams are subject to coarsening, whereby gas from the bubbles diffuses through the liquid phase. Gas is preferentially transported from small to large bubbles, resulting in a gradual decrease of the number of bubbles and an increase in the average bubble size. Coarsening foams are expected to approach a scaling state at late times in which their statistical properties are invariant. Understanding of coarsening in foams with a moderate liquid content has been improved by recent experiments. However, a model predicting the observed bubble-size distribution in the scaling state, as a function of the liquid fraction $\phi$, has not yet been developed. To this end, we propose a three-dimensional mean-field bubble growth law for foams without inter-bubble adhesion, validated against bubble-scale simulations, and use it to derive a prediction of the scaling-state bubble-size distribution for any $\phi$ from zero up to the unjamming transition $\phi_\text{c} \approx 36\%$. We verify that the derived scaling state is approached from a variety of initial conditions using mean-field simulations implementing the proposed growth law. Comparing our predicted bubble-size distribution with previous simulations and experimental results, we likewise find a large population of small bubbles when $\phi > 0$, but there are qualitative differences from prior results which we attribute to the absence of rattlers, i.e. bubbles not pressed into contact with their neighbours, in our model.

Title: Extraordinary transition at the edge of a correlated topological insulator
Authors: Francesco Parisen Toldin, Fakher F. Assaad, Max A. Metlitski
Abstract: The interplay of topology and correlations defines a new playground to study boundary criticality in quantum systems. We employ large scale auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo simulations to study a two-dimensional Kane-Mele-Hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice with zig-zag edges and the Hubbard U-term tuned to the three-dimensional XY bulk critical point. Upon varying the Hubbard-U term on the edge we observe a boundary phase transition from an ordinary phase with a helical Luttinger liquid edge decoupled from the critical bulk to an extraordinary-log phase characterized by a logarithmically diverging spin stiffness. We find that the spectral functions exhibit distinct features in the two phases giving potential experimental signatures.

Title: Quantum Annealing in SK Model Employing Suzuki-Kubo-deGennes Quantum Ising Mean Field Dynamics
Authors: Soumyaditya Das, Soumyajyoti Biswas, Bikas K. Chakrabarti
Abstract: We study a quantum annealing approach for estimating the ground state energy of the Sherrington-Kirpatrick mean field spin glass model using the Suzuki-Kubo dynamics applied for individual local magnetization components. The solutions of the coupled differential equations, in discretized state, give a fast annealing algorithm (cost $N^3$) in estimating the ground state of the model: Classical ($E^0= -0.7629 \pm 0.0002$), Quantum ($E^0=-0.7623 \pm 0.0001$) and Mixed ($E^0=-0.7626 \pm 0.0001$), all of which are to be compared with the best known estimate $E^0= -0.763166726 \dots$ . We infer that the continuous nature of the magnetization variable used in the dynamics here is the reason for reaching close to the ground state quickly and also the reason for not observing the de-Almeida-Thouless line in this approach.

Title: Band mixing effects in one-dimensional charge transfer insulators
Authors: Samuel Milner, Steven Johnston, Adrian Feiguin
Abstract: The low-energy properties of transition metal oxides (TMOs) are governed by the electrons occupying strongly correlated $d$-orbitals that are hybridized with surrounding ligand oxygen $p$ orbitals to varying degrees. Their physics is thus established by a complex interplay between the transition-metal (TM)-ligand hopping $t$, charge transfer energy $\Delta_\mathrm{CT}$, and on-site TM Hubbard repulsion $U$. Here, we study the spectral properties of a one-dimensional (1D) analog of such a $pd$ system, with alternating TM $d$ and ligand anion $p$ orbitals situated along a chain. Using the density matrix renormalization group method, we study the model's single-particle spectral function, x-ray absorption spectrum, and dynamical spin structure factor as a function of $\Delta_\mathrm{CT}$ and $U$. In particular, we present results spanning from the Mott insulating ($\Delta_\mathrm{CT} > U$) to negative charge transfer regime $\Delta_\mathrm{CT} < 0$ to better understand the ground and momentum-resolved excited state properties of these different regimes. Our results can guide new studies on TMOs that seek to situate them within the Mott-Hubbard/charge transfer insulator classification scheme.

Title: First-principles phonon physics using the Pheasy code
Authors: Changpeng Lin, Jian Han, Ben Xu, Nicola Marzari
Abstract: Parameter-free calculations of lattice dynamics from first principles have achieved significant progress in the past decades, with a wealth of applications in thermodynamics, phase transitions, and transport properties of materials. Current approaches to derive the interatomic force constants (IFCs) of lattice potential become challenging and sometimes infeasible when going beyond third-order anharmonicity, due to the combinatorial explosion in the number of higher-order IFCs. In this work, we present a robust and user-friendly program, Pheasy, which accurately reconstructs the potential energy surface of crystalline solids via a Taylor expansion of arbitrarily high order. Given force-displacement datasets, the program enables an efficient and accurate extraction of IFCs using advanced machine-learning algorithms, and further calculates a wide range of harmonic and anharmonic phonon related properties. We show in three prototypical examples how the obtained IFCs have been successfully applied to study anharmonic lattice dynamics and thermal transport. Through these detailed benchmarks, we have also identified the optimal approach for IFC extractions and offered general guidelines for high-fidelity lattice-dynamical simulations, addressing the large uncertainties in the IFCs extracted from existing various schemes. Overall, the Pheasy project aims to create a phonon code ecosystem that connects diverse phonon simulation platforms and offers access to the broad research community.

Title: Substrate stiffness governs dynamics and self-organization of nascent biofilms
Authors: Garima Rani, Anupam Sengupta
Abstract: The evolutionary success of bacteria lies in their ability to form complex surface-associated communities in diverse biophysical settings. However, it remains poorly understood how compliance of soft surfaces, measured in terms of their elastic deformability, impacts the dynamics and self-organization of bacterial cells proliferating into colonies. Using experiments and biomechanical modelling, here we study the expansion and self-organization of bacterial cells into sessile colonies on soft substrates. The dynamics and spatiotemporal structures were captured by visualising growing bacterial colonies on nutrient-rich, soft agarose pads, with elastic modulus in the range ~0.3 kPA to ~100 kPA by varying the concentration of the agarose in the underlying substrate. Our results show that, at the scale of the colonies, significant differences emerge in the spreading dynamics and colony geometry as the substrate stiffness is altered: softer substrates promote distinct, multilayered colony structures, and as revealed by fractal analysis of the colony boundaries, they exhibit higher boundary roughness. In contrast, colonies growing on harder substrates first grow up to large monolayers, before undergoing the mono-to-multilayer transition (MTMT), showing nearly 300% increase in the overall colony area at MTMT. A simple biomechanical model captures the role of effective drag forces at different scales, acting on the colonies as they spread on substrates with different stiffness: higher drag in soft substrates drive early verticalisation of the colonies, while lower effective drag delays the MTMT, resulting in larger colony areas. Based on the results and biomechanical insights, a comprehensive data-backed numerical model is currently being developed. Our findings highlight the role of surface stiffness in determining the self-organization of bacterial cells into an expanding multi-scale colony.

Title: Dynamic Interfacial Quantum Dipoles in Charge Transfer Heterostructures
Authors: Ziyu Liu, Emil Viñas Boström, Dihao Sun, Jordan Pack, Matthew Cothrine, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, David G. Mandrus, Angel Rubio, Cory R. Dean
Abstract: Hysteretic gate responses of two-dimensional material heterostructures serve as sensitive probes of the underlying electronic states and hold significant promise for the development of novel nanoelectronic devices. Here we identify a new mechanism of hysteretic behavior in graphene/$h$BN/$\alpha$-$\mathrm{RuCl_3}$ charge transfer field effect devices. The hysteresis loop exhibits a sharp onset under low temperatures and evolves symmetrically relative to the charge transfer equilibrium. Unlike conventional flash memory devices, the charge transfer heterostructure features a transparent tunneling barrier and its hysteretic gate response is induced by the dynamic tuning of interfacial dipoles originating from quantum exchange interactions. The system acts effectively as a ferroelectric and gives rise to remarkable tunability of the hysteretic gate response under external electrical bias. Our work unveils a novel mechanism for engineering hysteretic behaviors via dynamic interfacial quantum dipoles.

Title: Construction and Tuning of CALPHAD Models Using Machine-Learned Interatomic Potentials and Experimental Data: A Case Study of the Pt-W System
Authors: Courtney Kunselman, Siya Zhu, Doguhan Sariturk, Raymundo Arroyave
Abstract: This work introduces PhaseForgePlus -- a computationally efficient, fully open-source workflow for physically-informed CALPHAD model generation and parameter fitting. Using the Pt-W system as an example, we show that the integration of Machine Learning Potentials into the Alloy Theoretic Automated Toolkit can produce physically grounded Gibbs energy descriptions requiring only slight adjustments to produce accurate phase diagrams. Employing the Jansson derivative method in the context of experimental observations, such adjustments can be efficiently and robustly determined through gradient-informed optimization procedures.

Title: Optimizing $α''$-Fe$_{16}$N$_2$ as permanent magnet via alloying
Authors: Bo Zhao, Ruiwen Xie, Imants Dirba, Lambert Alff, Oliver Gutfleisch, Hongbin Zhang
Abstract: Based on systematic first-principles calculations, we investigate the effects of 27 alloying elements on the intrinsic magnetic properties of Fe$_{16}$N$_2$, in order to further optimize its properties for permanent magnet applications. Analysis on the thermodynamic stabilities based on formation energy and distance to the convex hull reveals that 20 elements can be substituted into Fe$_{16}$N$_2$, where there is no strong site-preference upon doping. It is observed that all alloying elements can essentially reduce the saturation magnetization, whereas the magnetic anisotropy can be significantly modified. In terms of the Boltzmann-average intrinsic properties, we identify 8 elements as interesting candidates, with Co, Mo, and W as the most promising cases for further experimental validations.

Title: Correlated cell movements drive epithelial finger formation
Authors: Sander C. Kammeraat, Yann-Edwin Keta, Paul Appleton, Ian P. Newton, Tanniemola B. Liverpool, Rastko Sknepnek, Inke Näthke, Silke Henkes
Abstract: Epithelia form protective barriers in multicellular organisms. To maintain homeostasis, they must be able to regenerate and heal damaged areas. This occurs through collective cell migration, during which finger-like protrusions commonly appear. Whether these protrusions are driven by specialised leader cells, biochemical cues, or generic physical interactions remains unclear. Integrating in vitro imaging, agent-based simulations, and continuum modelling, we show that correlated active cell motion alone suffices to produce fingers. Leader cells, signalling, and proliferation modulate, but do not trigger, this pattern. Our results show that the key mechanism underlying a complex biological process can be understood using a general framework of the physics of dense active matter.

Title: Nondestructive optomechanical detection scheme for Bose-Einstein condensates
Authors: Cisco Gooding, Cameron R. D. Bunney, Samin Tajik, Sebastian Erne, Steffen Biermann, Jörg Schmiedmayer, Jorma Louko, William G. Unruh, Silke Weinfurtner
Abstract: We present a two-tone heterodyne optical readout scheme to extract unequal-time density correlations along an arbitrary stationary interaction path from a pancake-shaped Bose-Einstein condensate, using a modulated laser probe. Analysing the measurement noise both from imprecision and backaction, we identify the standard quantum limit for the signal-extraction scheme, and examine how a class of two-mode squeezed initial states can be used to push beyond this limit. As an application, we show how the readout scheme can be used for an experimental realisation of acceleration-dependence of quantum-vacuum fluctuations in the system, including the analogue spacetime circular motion Unruh effect.

Title: Collisional decoherence in a BEC double-well accelerometer
Authors: Kateryna Korshynska, Sebastian Ulbricht
Abstract: BEC-based quantum sensors offer a huge, yet not fully explored potential in gravimetry and accelerometry. In this paper, we study a possible setup for such a device, which is a weakly interacting Bose gas trapped in a double-well potential. In such a trap, the gas is known to exhibit Josephson oscillations, which rely on the coherence between the potential wells. Applying the density matrix approach, we consider transitions between the coherent, partially incoherent, and fully incoherent states of the Bose gas. We show how, due to the presence of weak interactions, collisional decoherence causes the Josephson oscillations to decay with time. We further study the interplay of collisional interaction and external acceleration, which leads to shifts of the oscillation frequency. Finally, we investigate how this effect can be used to build a BEC double-well accelerometer and give analytical expressions for its expected sensitivity.

Title: A Crystallographic Metric for Continuous Quantification of Unit Cell Deformation
Authors: Shannon Bernier, Gregory Bassen, Matthew Brem, Davor Tolj, Quentin Simmons, Tyrel M. McQueen
Abstract: Describing the deviation of a real structure from a hypothetical higher-symmetry ideal can be a powerful tool to understand and interpret phase transitions. Here we introduce a simple yet effective metric that quantifies the degree of unit cell distortion relative to a cube, called the cubic deviation metric. This enables continuous comparisons between unit cells of different geometries. We demonstrate the potential of this tool with four separate case study applications to real material systems: 1) discontinuous structural phase transitions in pseudobrookites; 2) homological structure classification; 3) structure-correlated piezoelectricity in hexagonal materials; and 4) superconducting materials design in the cuprate family. Although this metric does not replace detailed structural or group theory analysis, it enables comparison across different compositional and structural compound variants, even in the presence of disorder or absence of group-subgroup correlation.

Title: Prediction of Large Events in Directed Sandpiles
Authors: Dhruv Shah
Abstract: The degree of predictability of large avalanche events in the directed sandpile model is studied. A waiting time based prediction strategy which exploits the local anticorrelation of large events is discussed. With this strategy we show analytically and numerically that large events are predictable to some extent, and that this predictability persists in the thermodynamic limit. We introduce another strategy which predicts large avalanches in the future based on the present excess density in the sandpile. We obtain the exact conditional probabilities for large events given an excess density, and use this to determine the exact form of the ROC predictability curves. We show that for this strategy, the model is predictable only for finite lattice sizes, and unpredictable in the thermodynamic limit. This behaviour is to be contrasted with previously established numerical studies carried out for Manna sandpiles.

Title: Magnetism at the interface of $MoSe_2/V_2O_5$ heterostructures
Authors: Rohin Sharma, Diem Thi-Xuan Dang, Lilia M. Woods
Abstract: Magnetism in doped transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers and van der Waals interfaced materials have motivated the search for sustainable magnetic states at the nanoscale with the prospect of building devices for spintronics applications. In this study, we report the existence of magnetism in a heterostructure made up of an $MoSe_2$ transition metal dichalcogenide monolayer and a $V_2O_5$ substrate. Using density functional theory simulations, we find that ferromagnetic ordering can be found in the $MoSe_2/V_2O_5$ heterostructure even though the individual components are nonmagnetic. By examining the electronic structure and magnetic properties of this system we find how the occurring ferromagnetism evolves if the transition metal dichalcogenide or the $V_2O_5$ substrate can host point defects. Our study suggests that the balance between charge transfer and spin reorganization can lead to interface magnetism in novel hybrid materials.

Title: Sliding two-dimensional superconductivity and charge-density-wave state in a bulk crystal
Authors: Xiangqi Liu, Chen Xu, Jing Jiang, Haonan Wang, Shaobo Liu, Gan Liu, Ziyi Zhu, Jian Yuan, Wei Xia, Lianbing Wen, Jiawei Luo, Yixuan Luo, Xia Wang, Na Yu, Peihong Cheng, Leiming Chen, Rui Zhou, Jun Li, Yulin Chen, Shiwei Wu, Ke Qu, Wei Li, Guangming Zhang, Chungang Duan, Jianhao Chen, Xiaoxiang Xi, Zhenzhong Yang, Kai Liu, Yanfeng Guo
Abstract: Superconductivity in the two-dimensional (2D) limit is a fertile ground for exotic quantum phenomena-many of which remain elusive in their 3D counterparts. While studies of 2D superconductivity have predominantly focused on mono- or few-layer systems, we demonstrate an alternative route-interlayer sliding in bulk crystals. Through a precisely controlled growth strategy, we engineer interlayer sliding in bulk 3R-NbSe2, deliberately disrupting [001] mirror symmetry and drastically suppressing interlayer coupling. Remarkably, this structural manipulation stabilizes Ising-type superconductivity coexisting with an unconventional charge-density-wave (CDW) state akin to that of monolayer 2H-NbSe2. The sliding phase exhibits a pronounced suppression of the upper critical field at low temperatures, revealing a delicate competition between Ising and Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in the globally noncentrosymmetric lattice. Intriguingly, the superconducting state displays two-fold symmetry, a signature that may arise from asymmetric SOC or a multi-component pairing order parameter. Our work establishes interlayer sliding as a symmetry-breaking tool to promote 2D superconductivity in bulk materials-without resorting to extrinsic intercalation or doping. More broadly, this approach sets a paradigm for unlocking hidden quantum states in layered materials, offering a new dimension in design of quantum matter.

Title: Mixed spin states for robust ferromagnetism in strained SrCoO$_3$ thin films
Authors: Xiquan Zheng, Nicholas B. Brookes, Flora Yakhou-Harris, Yingjie Lyu, Jianbing Zhang, Qian Xiao, Xinyi Jiang, Qingzheng Qiu, Qizhi Li, Shilong Zhang, Xinqiang Cai, Pu Yu, Yi Lu, Yingying Peng
Abstract: Epitaxial strain in transition-metal oxides can induce dramatic changes in electronic and magnetic properties. A recent study on the epitaxially strained SrCoO$_3$ thin films revealed persistent ferromagnetism even across a metal-insulator transition. This challenges the current theoretical predictions, and the nature of the local spin state underlying this robustness remains unresolved. Here, we employ high-resolution resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) at the Co-$L_3$ edge to probe the spin states of strained SrCoO$_3$ thin films. Compared with CoO$_6$ cluster multiplet calculations, we identify a ground state composed of a mixed high- and low-spin configuration, distinct from the previously proposed intermediate-spin state. Our results demonstrate that the robustness of ferromagnetism arises from the interplay between this mixed spin state and the presence of ligand holes associated with negative charge transfer. These findings provide direct experimental evidence for a nontrivial magnetic ground state in SrCoO$_3$ and offer new pathways for designing robust ferromagnetic systems in correlated oxides.

Authors: Meysam Bagheri, Thorsten Pöschel
Abstract: We consider a homogeneous chain of spheres linked by liquid bridges under tension. The rupture of a single liquid bridge leads to a fragmentation cascade driven by the inverse relation between the capillary force and the sphere distances. The initial length of the liquid bridges determines the number and size of the fragments and the velocity of the fragmentation front.

Title: Study of Optical Properties of MOCVD-Grown Rutile GeO2 Films
Authors: Imteaz Rahaman, Anthony Bolda, Botong Li, Hunter D. Ellis, Kai Fu
Abstract: Rutile germanium dioxide (r-GeO$_2$) is a promising ultra-wide bandgap (UWBG) semiconductor, offering a high theoretical Baliga figure of merit, potential for p-type doping, and favorable thermal and electrical properties. In this work, we present a comprehensive optical investigation of crystalline r-GeO$_2$ thin films grown on r-TiO$_2$ (001) substrates via metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). Cathodoluminescence (CL) spectroscopy reveals broad visible emissions with distinct peaks near 470~nm and 520~nm. CL mapping indicates enhanced emission intensity in regions with larger crystalline domains, highlighting the correlation between domain size and optical quality. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) confirms the presence of Ge$^{4+}$ oxidation state and provides a bandgap estimation of $\sim$4.75~eV based on valence band and secondary electron cutoff analysis. UV--Vis transmittance measurements show a sharp absorption edge near 250--260~nm, corresponding to an optical bandgap in the range of 4.81--5.0~eV. These findings offer valuable insights into the defect-related emission behavior and band-edge characteristics of r-GeO$_2$, reinforcing its potential for future applications in power electronics and deep-ultraviolet optoelectronic devices.

Title: Opto- and magneto-tunable exceptional degeneracies in non-Hermitian ferromagnet/$p$-wave magnet junctions
Authors: Mohammad Alipourzadeh, Davood Afshar, Yaser Hajati
Abstract: Unconventional $p$-wave magnets (UPMs) with odd-parity spin textures have attracted interest for their zero net magnetization and anisotropic spin-split Fermi surfaces. Here, we explore a non-Hermitian open quantum system composed of a ferromagnet and a UPM, subjected to an external magnetic field and off-resonant circularly polarized light (CPL), serving as tunable control parameters. We demonstrate the emergence of exceptional points (EPs) in the proposed junction, whose locations can be modulated by the intrinsic properties of the UPM. These EPs exhibit different multiplicities and formation conditions compared to those in even-parity magnets (dubbed $d$- wave altermagnets), a distinction attributable to the preserved time-reversal and broken inversion symmetries characteristic of UPMs. We find that both the unidirectional magnetic field (with adjustable strength and orientation) and the CPL induce momentum-direction-dependent modifications to the EPs, such as their shifting, tilting, merging, or annihilation, supported by analyses of spin projection and eigenvector overlap. Although both perturbations influence the EP structure, they operate via distinct mechanisms: CPL induces a global Floquet re-normalization, enabling dynamic tunability through light, whereas the unidirectional magnetic field selectively alters orientation-aligned terms, lacking such tunability. Beyond revealing EP dynamics in UPM-based junctions, our results highlight UPMs as promising platforms for non-Hermitian phenomena in future spintronics.

Title: Unified description of cuprate superconductors by fractionalized electrons emerging from integrated analyses of photoemission spectra and quasiparticle interference
Authors: Shiro Sakai, Youhei Yamaji, Fumihiro Imoto, Tsuyoshi Tamegai, Adam Kaminski, Takeshi Kondo, Yuhki Kohsaka, Tetsuo Hanaguri, Masatoshi Imada
Abstract: Electronic structure of high-temperature superconducting cuprates is studied by analyzing experimental data independently obtained from two complementary spectroscopies, one, quasiparticle interference (QPI) measured by scanning-tunneling microscopy and the other, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and by combining these two sets of data in a unified theoretical analysis. Through explicit calculations of experimentally measurable quantities, we show that a simple two-component fermion model (TCFM) representing electron fractionalization succeeds in reproducing various detailed features of these experimental data: ARPES and QPI data are concomitantly reproduced by the TCFM in full energy and momentum spaces. The measured QPI pattern reveals a signature characteristic of the TCFM, distinct from the conventional single-component prediction, supporting the validity of the electron fractionalization in the cuprate. The integrated analysis also solves the puzzles of ARPES and QPI data that are seemingly inconsistent with each other. The overall success of the TCFM offers a comprehensive understanding of the electronic structure of the cuprates. We further predict that a characteristic QPI pattern should appear in the unoccupied high-energy part if the fractionalization is at work. We propose that integrated-spectroscopy analyses offer a promising way to explore challenging issues of strongly correlated electron systems.

Title: Percolation of random compact diamond-shaped systems on the square lattice
Authors: Charles S. do Amaral, Mateus G. Soares, Robert M. Ziff
Abstract: We study site percolation on a square lattice with random compact diamond-shaped neighborhoods. Each site $s$ is connected to others within a neighborhood in the shape of a diamond of radius $r_s$, where $r_s$ is uniformly chosen from the set $\{i, i+1, \ldots, m\}$ with $i \leq m$. The model is analyzed for all values of $i = 0, \ldots, 7$ and $m = i, \ldots, 10$, where $\overline{z}(i,m)$ denotes the average number of neighbors per site and $p_c(i,m)$ is the critical percolation threshold. For each fixed $i$, the product $\overline{z}(i,m)\,p_c(i,m)$ is found to converge to a constant as $m \to \infty$. Such behavior is expected when $i=m$ (single diamond sizes), for which the product $\overline{z}(i)\,p_c(i)$ tends toward $2^d\eta_c$, where $\eta_c$ is the continuum percolation threshold for diamond-shaped regions or aligned squares in two dimensions ($d=2$). This case is further examined for $i = 1, \ldots, 10$, and the expected convergence is confirmed. The particular case $i = m$ was first studied numerically by Gouker and Family in 1983. We also study the relation to systems of deposited diamond-shaped objects on a square lattice. For monodisperse diamonds of radius $r$, there is a direct mapping to percolation with a diamond-shaped neighborhood of radius $2r+1$, but when there is a distribution of object sizes, there is no such mapping. We study the case of mixtures of diamonds of radius $r=0$ and $r=1$, and compare it to the continuum percolation of disks of two sizes.

Title: $1/f$ noise in extremal dynamics
Authors: Rahul Chhimpa, Abha Singh, Avinash Chand Yadav
Abstract: The Bak-Sneppen (BS) evolution model remains a well-studied example of self-organized criticality (SOC). We propose a simple variant of the BS model, where the global fitness fluctuations show $1/f^{\alpha}$ noise with a spectral exponent nearly equal to 1 (pink noise). To further corroborate, we compute the two-time autocorrelation function that decays logarithmically. The $1/f$ noise in the global fitness is robust and hyper-universal. We identify the dominance of non-trivial local fitness cross-power spectra.

Title: Electrostatic Depletion Force in Complex Coacervates
Authors: Zongpei Wu, Shensheng Chen
Abstract: The functionalities and applications of complex coacervates -- liquid condensates resulting from liquid-liquid phase separation of charged polymers -- are significantly influenced by the dispersion and aggregation states of guest macromolecules. Intriguingly, guest macromolecules exhibit a strong tendency to aggregate within coacervates even in the absence of apparent chemical incompatibility, indicating a universal aggregation mechanism at play in these environments. Using extensive MD simulations, we identify electrostatic depletion -- a strong force arising from electrostatic correlations within the host polyelectrolyte network that drives guest aggregations. Due to electrostatic depletion, neutral polymers, low-charge-density polyelectrolytes, and intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) exhibit effective attractions in coacervates, in stark contrast to their behavior in dilute solutions. Unlike traditional depletion effect that requires mismatched length scale and morphology, electrostatic depletion is relevant in fluid systems where solute and solvent are both polymers with comparable size. Our discovery bridges a critical knowledge gap in the molecular physics of densely charged, crowded liquids and holds significant implications for the design of synthetic protocells and advanced drug delivery systems.

Title: Supercurrent Amplification in Nonequilibrium Superconductors
Authors: Qinghong Yang, Yuqi Cao, Dante M. Kennes, Zhiyuan Sun
Abstract: In ultrafast experiments on superconductors, a pump laser pulse often heats up the electronic system and suppresses the density of superfluid electrons. Subsequently, the electrons undergo a cooling process due to electron-phonon thermalization so that the superfluid density recovers in time. We show that if a supercurrent is initiated by a probe pulse in the cooling process, an intriguing phenomenon of 'supercurrent amplification' occurs, meaning that the net current grows in time with the increasing superfluid density. Using the Boltzmann kinetic equation, we uncover its microscopic origin as the momentum-relaxing scattering of quasi-particles by impurities and phonons, in stark contrast to the widely accepted intuition that impurities always attenuate currents. We further show that supercurrent amplification has important experimental manifestations, including the ultrafast Meissener effect and an optical reflectivity exceeding unity.

Title: Transport in Single Quantum Dots: A Review from Linear Response to Nonlinear Regimes
Authors: Gustavo Diniz, Silvio Quintino, Vivian V. França
Abstract: Quantum dots are versatile systems for exploring quantum transport, electron correlations, and many-body phenomena such as the Kondo effect. While equilibrium properties are well understood through methods like the numerical renormalization group and density matrix renormalization group, nonequilibrium transport remains a major theoretical challenge. From the experimental point of view, recent advances in nanofabrication and measurement techniques have enabled the investigation of far-from-equilibrium regimes. These conditions give rise to new transport phenomena, where strong correlations and nonequilibrium dynamics interplay in complex ways; beyond the reach of conventional linear response theory. To meet these challenges, new approaches such as nonequilibrium Green's functions, real-time NRG, and time-dependent DMRG have emerged. This work reviews the established results for quantum dot transport in and beyond the linear regime, highlights recent theoretical and experimental advances, and discusses open problems and future prospects.

Title: Force and geometric signatures of the creep-to-failure transition in a granular pile
Authors: Qing Hao, Luca Montoya, Elena Lee, Luke K. Davis, Cacey Stevens Bester
Abstract: Granular creep is the slow, sub-yield movement of constituents in a granular packing due to the disordered nature of its grain-scale interactions. Despite the ubiquity of creep in disordered materials, it is still not understood how to best predict the creep-to-failure regime based on the forces and interactions among constituents. To address this gap, we perform experiments to explore creep and failure in quasi two-dimensional piles of photoelastic disks, allowing the quantification of both grain movements and grain-scale contact force networks. Through controlled external disturbances, we investigate the emergence and evolution of grain rearrangements, force networks, and voids to illuminate signatures of creep and failure. Surprisingly, the force chain structure remains dynamic even in the absence of particle motion. We find that shifts in force chains provide an indication to larger, avalanche-scale disruptions. We reveal connections between these force signatures and the geometry of the voids in the pile. Overall, our novel experiments and analyses deepen our mechanical and geometric understanding of the creep-to-failure transition in granular systems.

Title: Metallophilicity Enhances Electron Transport through Parallel Organometallic 1D Chain Junctions Formed In Situ
Authors: Sigifredo Luna, Hannah E Skipper, Brent Lawson, Eric S Cueny, Maria Kamenetska
Abstract: We reveal the role of aurophilic interactions in the formation and conductance of gold cyanide molecular wires of variable length-to-width ratios assembled at the tip of an STM break junction in ambient conditions. Specifically, we identify electron transport signatures through 1D single chains containing variable number of monomeric repeats of gold cyanide AuCN, linked in series (AuCN)n, and through adjacent molecular wires linked in parallel. When bound in series, destructive quantum interference causes an exponential decay of conductance in (AuCN)n 1D wires for n=1-3. But when bound in parallel, aurophilic coupling through the gold atoms of neighboring chains reorders electronic states and results in significant enhancement of conductance. Our work reveals that metallophilicity can play a significant role in junction assembly and electron transport characteristics.

Title: Impact of quantum coherence on the dynamics and thermodynamics of quenched free fermions coupled to a localized defect
Authors: Beatrice Donelli, Gabriele De Chiara, Francesco Scazza, Stefano Gherardini
Abstract: We investigate the non-equilibrium quantum dynamics and thermodynamics of free fermions suddenly coupled to a localized defect in a one-dimensional harmonic trap. This setup realizes a quantum quench transformation that gives rise to the orthogonalization of the system's wave-function as an effect of the localized perturbation. Using the Loschmidt echo and the Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobability (KDQ) distribution of the work done by the defect, we quantify the extent and rate of the orthogonalization dynamics. In particular, we show that initializing the system in a coherent superpositions of energy eigenstates leads to non-classical features, such as Wigner function's negativity and non-positivity of the work KDQ distribution. Starting from simple single-particle superpositions and then progressing with coherent and cat states of few-body fermionic systems, we uncover how quantum coherence and few-body correlations shape the out-of-equilibrium response due to the presence of the defect.

Title: Confinement geometry governs the impact of external shear stress on active stress-driven flows in microtubule-kinesin active fluids
Authors: Joshua H. Dickie, Tianxing Weng, Yen-Chen Chen, Yutian He, Saloni Saxena, Robert A. Pelcovits, Thomas R. Powers, Kun-Ta Wu
Abstract: Active fluids generate internal active stress and exhibit unique responses to external forces such as superfluidity and self-yielding transitions. However, how confinement geometry influences these responses remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate microtubule-kinesin active fluids under external shear stresses in two geometries. In slab-like confinement (a narrow-gap cavity), external stresses propagated throughout the system, leading to stress competition and a kinematic transition that shifted dynamics from active stress-dominated to shear stress-dominated flow. At the transition, we estimate the active stress to be ~1.5 mPa. Simulation supported that this transition arises from stress competition. In contrast, in ring-like confinement (a toroidal system), external forces acted locally, inducing a mini cavity flow that triggered self-organized reconfiguration rather than direct entrainment. These findings show that the response of active fluids to external forcing depends not only on the magnitude of the applied stress but also on how confinement geometry directs and redistributes that stress, revealing a new approach to controlling active fluid behavior by combining static geometrical design with dynamic external stimuli for real-time modulation of flow patterns. Such control strategies may be applied to microfluidic systems, where external inputs such as micromechanical actuators can dynamically tune active fluid behavior within fixed device geometries, enabling transitions between chaotic and coherent flows for tasks such as mixing, sorting, or directed transport.

Title: Experimental evidence of disordered crystalline premixing in sputter-deposited Ni(V)/Al multilayers
Authors: Michael J Abere, Paul G. Kotula, Jonathan S. Paras, David P. Adams
Abstract: The sputter deposition of alternating layers of Ni(V) and Al forms a reactive multilayer known to undergo self-propagating formation reactions when ignited. The sequential deposition process leads to nm-scale premixing of reactants at each included interface which ultimately affects multilayer exothermicity. This work performs the direct measurement of a disordered face-centered cubic (FCC) solid solution premixed phase at the interfaces of Ni(V)/Al multilayers via scanning transmission electron microscopy. The crystallinity of the observed phase differs from previously reported a priori predictions of an amorphous interlayer. The disordered FCC phase retains its symmetry after annealing for 16 h at 135 C, but the lattice parameter shifts consistent with an Al-rich composition. The existence of a crystalline premix in Ni(V)/Al is attributed to the electronic contribution to the entropy of crystallization.

Title: Local interface effects modulate global charge order and optical properties of 1T-TaS$_2$/1H-WSe$_2$ heterostructures
Authors: Samra Husremović, Valerie S. McGraw, Medha Dandu, Lilia S. Xie, Sae Hee Ryu, Oscar Gonzalez, Shannon S. Fender, Madeline Van Winkle, Karen C. Bustillo, Takashi Taniguchi, Kenji Watanabe, Chris Jozwiak, Aaron Bostwick, Eli Rotenberg, Archana Raja, Katherine Inzani, D. Kwabena Bediako
Abstract: 1T-TaS$_2$ is a layered charge density wave (CDW) crystal exhibiting sharp phase transitions and associated resistance changes. These resistance steps could be exploited for information storage, underscoring the importance of controlling and tuning CDW states. Given the importance of out-of-plane interactions in 1T-TaS$_2$, modulating interlayer interactions by heterostructuring is a promising method for tailoring CDW phase transitions. In this work, we investigate the optical and electronic properties of heterostructures comprising 1T-TaS$_2$ and monolayer 1H-WSe$_2$. By systematically varying the thickness of 1T-TaS$_2$ and its azimuthal alignment with 1H-WSe$_2$, we find that intrinsic moiré strain and interfacial charge transfer introduce CDW disorder in 1T-TaS$_2$ and modify the CDW ordering temperature. Furthermore, our studies reveal that the interlayer alignment impacts the exciton dynamics in 1H-WSe$_2$, indicating that heterostructuring can concurrently tailor the electronic phases in 1T-TaS$_2$ and the optical properties of 1H-WSe$_2$. This work presents a promising approach for engineering optoelectronic behavior of heterostructures that integrate CDW materials and semiconductors.

Title: Primitive chain network simulations of the creep of entangled polymers
Authors: Yuichi Masubuchi, Giovanni Ianniruberto, Giuseppe Marrucci
Abstract: Although the behavior of entangled polymers in startup shear flows with constant shear rates has been thoroughly investigated, the response under creep has not been frequently considered. In this study, primitive chain network simulations, based on a multi-chain sliplink model, are modified so as to describe creep experiments. Creep simulations are compared to a literature dataset of an entangled polybutadiene solution, and qualitative agreement is found in the nonlinear range, i.e., under large stresses. Simulations allow one to extract details of the transient molecular motion, and results suggest that the deformation-induced disentanglement is relatively mild in the stress-controlled mode as compared to the rate-controlled one, because coherent molecular tumbling at the start of flow is disrupted.

Title: Unconventional Altermagnetism in Quasicrystals: A Hyperspatial Projective Construction
Authors: Yiming Li, Mingxiang Pan, Jun Leng, Yuxiao Chen, Huaqing Huang
Abstract: Altermagnetism, a novel magnetic phase characterized by symmetry-protected, momentum-dependent spin splitting and collinear compensated magnetic moments, has thus far been explored primarily in periodic crystals. In this Letter, we extend the concept of altermagnetism to quasicrystals -- aperiodic systems with long-range order and noncrystallographic rotational symmetries. Using a hyperspatial projection framework, we construct decorated Ammann-Beenker and Penrose quasicrystalline lattices with inequivalent sublattices and investigate a Hubbard model with anisotropic hopping. We demonstrate that interaction-induced Néel order on such lattices gives rise to alternating spin-polarized spectral functions that reflect the underlying quasicrystalline symmetry, revealing the emergence of unconventional $g$-wave (octagonal) and $h$-wave (decagonal) altermagnetism. Our symmetry analysis and low-energy effective theory further reveal unconventional altermagnetic spin splitting, which is compatible with quasicrystalline rotational symmetry. Our work shows that quasicrystals provide a fertile ground for realizing unconventional altermagnetic phases beyond crystallographic constraints, offering a platform for novel magnetisms and transport phenomena unique to quasiperiodic systems.

Title: Resonant Fields Inducing Energy Towers in Lieb Quantum Spin Lattice
Authors: J. Y. Liu-Sun, Z. Song
Abstract: We study a ferromagnetic XXZ Heisenberg model on a Lieb lattice. A set of exact eigenstates is constructed based on the restricted spectrum generating algebra (RSGA) when a resonant staggered magnetic field is applied. These states are identical to the eigenstates of a system of two coupled angular momenta. Furthermore, we find that the RSGA can be applied to other eigenstates of the Lieb lattice in an approximate manner. Numerical simulations reveal that there exist sets of eigenstates, which obey a quasi-RSGA. These states act as energy towers within the low-lying excited spectrum, indicating that they are quantum many-body scars.

Title: Momentum distribution and correlation of free particles in the Tsallis statistics using conventional expectation value and equilibrium temperature
Authors: Masamichi Ishihara
Abstract: We applied the Tsallis statistics with the conventional expectation value to a system of free particles, adopting the equilibrium temperature which is often called the physical temperature. The entropic parameter $q$ in the Tsallis statistics is less than one for power-law-like distribution. The well-known relation between the energy and the temperature in the Boltzmann--Gibbs statistics holds in the Tsallis statistics, when the equilibrium temperature is adopted. We derived the momentum distribution and the correlation in the Tsallis statistics. The momentum distribution and the correlation in the Tsallis statistics are different from those in the Boltzmann--Gibbs statistics, even when the equilibrium temperature is adopted. These quantities depend on $q$ and $N$, where $N$ is the number of particles. The correlation exists even for free particles. The parameter $q$ satisfies the inequality $1-1/(3N/2+1) < q < 1$.

Title: Thermal transport and the impact of hydrogen adsorption in Linde Type A zeolitic imidazolate frameworks
Authors: Hyunseok Oh, Taeyong Kim
Abstract: Thermal transport in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) is of practical interest in diverse applications such as gas storage and separations, since insufficient heat dissipation can lead to detrimental effects. Despite investigations, influence of molecular infiltration on the heat transport remains unclear in many of MOFs due to poor understanding of mechanisms governing heat conductions. Here, we report molecular dynamics investigations of thermal transport properties in zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs). We investigated Linde Type A topological ZIFs (ZIF-lta) exhibiting exceptionally low thermal conductivity with unusual trend of temperature dependence deviating from many crystalline materials, despite long-range crystalline order in them. We demonstrate that heat is predominantly carried by phonons with mean free paths comparable to their wavelengths, analogous to diffusons in amorphous solids owing to strong anharmonicity caused by complexity of unit cell consisting of a large number of metal centers. We further show that adsorbed hydrogen molecules increase thermal conductivity of ZIFs, mainly contributed by additional vibrational modes, as a result of gas-gas or gas-framework interactions. Our work advances fundamental understanding into the thermal transport in MOFs and suggests a means to engineer heat conduction via gas infiltrations.

Title: Using surface plasmons to detect spin inertia
Authors: H. Y. Yuan
Abstract: Recent experiments demonstrate that spin dynamics may acquire an inertial effect in a few metallic magnets, deviating from the traditional inertia-free dynamics. It remains an open question to ascertain the physical mechanisms and universality of the spin inertia across diverse magnetic systems. Here, we show that spin inertia generates nutation spin waves in the terahertz regime, which can hybridize with the surface plasmons in two-dimensional (2D) conducting materials such as graphene. By exciting hybrid spin wave-plasmon modes and analyzing the reflection spectrum of a 2D material$|$magnet heterostructure, we propose a method to quantitatively determine the strength of spin inertia in magnetic layers. Our approach is universally applicable to all types of magnetic insulators and could advance the future exploration of the magnitude and physical mechanism of spin inertia.

Title: Parametric pair production of collective excitations in a Bose-Einstein condensate
Authors: Victor Gondret, Rui Dias, Clothilde Lamirault, Léa Camier, Amaury Micheli, Charlie Leprince, Quentin Marolleau, Scott Robertson, Denis Boiron, Christoph I. Westbrook
Abstract: By exciting the transverse breathing mode of an elongated Bose-Einstein condensate, we parametrically produce longitudinal collective excitations in a pairwise manner. This process also referred to as Faraday wave generation, can be seen as an analog to cosmological particle production. Building upon single particle detection, we investigate the early time dynamics of the exponential growth and compare our observation with a Bogoliubov description. The growth rate we observe experimentally is in very good agreement with theoretical predictions, demonstrating the validity of the Bogoliubov description and thereby confirming the smallness of quasiparticle interactions in such an elongated gas. We also discuss the presence of oscillations in the atom number, which are due to pair correlations and to the rate at which interactions are switched off.

Title: The planar parafermion algebra: The $\mathbb{Z}_{N}$ clock model and the coupled Temperley-Lieb algebra
Authors: Remy Adderton, Murray T. Batchelor
Abstract: The Hamiltonian of the $N$-state clock model is written in terms of a coupled Temperley-Lieb (TL) algebra defined by $N-1$ types of TL generators. This generalizes a previous result for $N=3$ obtained by J. F. Fjelstad and T. Månsson [J. Phys. A {\bf 45} (2012) 155208]. The $\mathbb{Z}_{N}$-symmetric clock chain Hamiltonian expressed in terms of the coupled TL algebra generalizes the well known correspondence between the $N$-state Potts model and the TL algebra. The algebra admits a pictorial description in terms of a planar algebra involving parafermionic operators attached to $n$ strands. A key ingredient in the resolution of diagrams is the string Fourier transform. The pictorial presentation also allows a description of the Hilbert space. We also give a pictorial description of the representation related to the staggered XX spin chain. Just as the pictorial representation of the TL algebra has proven to be particularly useful in providing a visual and intuitive way to understand and manipulate algebraic expressions, it is anticipated that the pictorial representation of the coupled TL algebra may lead to further progress in understanding various aspects of the $\mathbb{Z}_{N}$ clock model, including the superintegrable chiral Potts model.

Title: A Non-Local Orientation Field Phase-Field Model for Misorientation- and Inclination- Dependent Grain Boundaries
Authors: Xiao Han, Axel van de Walle
Abstract: We propose to incorporate grain boundary (GB) anisotropy in phase-field modeling by extending the standard partial differential equations formulation to include a non-local functional of an orientation field. Regardless of the number of grains in the simulation, the model uses a single orientation field and incorporates grain misorientation and inclination information obtained from sampling the orientation field at optimized locations in the vicinity of the grain boundary. The formalism enables simple and precise tuning of GB energy anisotropy while avoiding an extensive fitting procedure. The functional includes an explicit GB anisotropy function to control the GB energy as a function of both misorientation and inclination. The model is validated by reproducing the linear grain growth rate, Wulff shapes with varying misorientations and anisotropic coefficients, and analytical equilibrium dihedral angles at triple junctions. Polycrystalline simulations demonstrate grain growth, coalescence, triple junction behavior, and the influence of anisotropy on grain morphology.

Title: Bose-Hubbard model in the canonical ensemble: a beyond mean-field approach
Authors: Tista Banerjee
Abstract: Ultracold atoms in optical lattices are versatile testbeds to study and manipulate equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium aspects of quantum many-body systems whose behavior can be described by Hubbard-type Hamiltonians. In this paper, we consider an ansatz wave-function which respects total particle-number conservation for such systems and goes beyond mean-field theory; this wave-function has the same complexity in the number of parameters as the mean-field Gutzwiller ansatz, and captures quantum correlations and entanglement via projection onto an effective low-energy manifold. This ansatz can be exploited to study quantum phases observed in a large class of systems realizable in such experimental platforms and is useful to study quantum dynamics. We show that the relaxation dynamics of various out-of-equilibrium initial states under sudden quench of Hamiltonian parameters can be studied with this ansatz wavefunction within the framework of time-dependent variational principle. We present a quantitative comparison with small-scale exact diagonalization results in the 1D Bose-Hubbard model with and without external trapping potentials.

Title: A Novel Methodology of Visualizing Orthorhombic Phase Uniformity in Ferroelectric Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 Devices Using Piezoresponse Force Microscopy
Authors: Wei-Cheng Peng, Hsien-Yang Liu, Cheng-Yu Yu, Artur Useinov, Tian-Li Wu
Abstract: Ferroelectric Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 (HZO) thin films are promising for next-generation memory and logic devices due to their CMOS compatibility and scalability. The spatial uniformity of the orthorhombic (O) phase is crucial for optimizing ferroelectric properties like remnant polarization. This work introduces a novel piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) approach for 2D mapping of O-phase uniformity in HZO films (5 nm, 9 nm, and 20 nm), further quantifing O-phase distribution by distinguishing polarized O-phase regions from non-polarized tetragonal/monoclinic (T/M) phases. Our results reveal that the 9 nm film exhibits the most uniform O-phase and highest remnant polarization. This PFM-based method enables comprehensive phase characterization without requiring complicated facilities, broadening access to phase analysis and advancing ferroelectric thin-film research for memory and logic applications.

Title: Exact diagonalization study of energy level statistics in harmonically confined interacting bosons
Authors: Mohd Talib, M. A. H. Ahsan
Abstract: We present an exact diagonalization study of the spectral properties of bosons harmonically confined in a quasi-2D plane and interacting via repulsive Gaussian potential. We consider the lowest $100$ energy levels for systems of $N=12, 16$ and $20$ bosons both for the moderate and strong interaction regimes for the non-rotating ($L_{z}=0$) and the rotating single-vortex state ($L_{z}=N$). For higher angular momenta, $L_{z}=2N$ and $L_{z}=3N$, only the strong interaction regime is considered. While the nearest-neighbor spacing distribution (NNSD) $P(s)$ and the ratios of consecutive level spacings distribution $P(r)$ are used to study the short-range correlations, the Dyson-Mehta $\Delta_3$ statistic and the level number variance $\Sigma^2(L)$ are used to examine the long-range correlations. In the moderate interaction regime when the interaction energy is small compared to the trap energy, the non-rotating system exhibits a Poisson distribution, characteristic of the regular energy spectra. In the strong interaction regime when the interaction energy is comparable to the trap energy, the non-rotating system exhibits chaotic behavior signified by GOE distribution. Furthermore, in the rotating case for the single-vortex state ($L_{z} = N$) in the moderate interaction regime, the system exhibits signatures of weak chaos with some degree of regularity in the energy-level spectra. However, in the strong interaction regime for the rotating case with $L_{z} = N$, $2N$ and $3N$, the system exhibits strong chaotic behavior. The rotation is found to contribute to an enhancement of chaotic behavior in the system for both the moderate and the strong interaction regimes. Our results of NNSD analysis are supported by the analysis of the ratios of consecutive level spacings distribution $P(r)$.

Title: Photoinduced Low Spin to High Spin Transition in a [2x2] Fe(II) Metallogrid: Diode Laser-Pumped Photocrystallography at the P11 Beamline in PETRA III, DESY
Authors: Krishnayan Basuroy, Jose de Jesus Velazquez-Garcia, Sreeju Sreekantan Nair Lalithambika, Argha Barman, Torben Reuss, Guillaume Pompidor, Alexander Grebentsov, Önder Akçaalan, Simone Techert
Abstract: We report on the photoinduced spin crossover (SCO) transition from a 2HS-2LS to a 3HS-1LS state in a [2x2] Fe(II) metallogrid complex using molecular crystals with static photocrystallography at a first ever attempt in the beamline P11 of the PETRA III synchrotron, DESY. A class 3B diode laser was used to induce the transition under controlled irradiation conditions. Structural characterization was achieved through single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) measurements post-irradiation, revealing significant changes in average Fe-N distances, consistent with SCO behavior. Our experimental setup enables precise alignment necessary for photo-excitation using a class 3B diode laser along with a compact focusing optics. The longest dimension of the combined setup of the diode head and the focusing optics is not more than 32cm. The setup showcasing the utility of a compact diode laser system which can even be conveniently used in synchrotron-based pump-probe photocrystallography experiments for a wide range of molecular crystals.

Title: Optical properties of emeraldine salt polymers from ab initio calculations: comparison with recent experimental data
Authors: Renato Colle, Pietro Parruccini, Andrea Benassi, Carlo Cavazzoni
Abstract: We present absorption coefficient {\alpha}({\omega}), transverse dielectric function {\epsilon}({\omega}), optical conductivity {\sigma}({\omega}), and reflectance R({\omega}) calculated for an emeraldine salt conducting polymer in its crystalline three-dimensional polaronic structure. We utilize Kohn-Sham DFT electronic wavefunctions and energies implemented in the expression of the macroscopic transverse dielectric function in the framework of the band theory without the electron-hole interaction. Contributions of intra-band transitions are taken into account by adding a Drude-like term to the dielectric function calculated ab-initio. Comparison with optical properties, recently measured on high-quality emeraldine salts (Nature 441(2006)65-68), and with optical absorption spectra, recorded on other emeraldine salts, is very satisfactory. The calculated spectra are discussed in terms of energy-band structure, density of states, inter- and intra-band transitions and transverse dielectric function.

Title: Quantum Path-integral Method for Fictitious Particle Hubbard Model
Authors: Zhijie Fan, Tianning Xiao, Youjin Deng
Abstract: We formulate a path-integral Monte Carlo algorithm for simulating lattice systems consisting of fictitious particles governed by a generalized exchange statistics. This method, initially proposed for continuum systems, introduces a continuous parameter $\xi$ in the partition function that interpolates between bosonic ($\xi = 1$) and fermionic ($\xi = -1$) statistics. We generalize this approach to discrete lattice models and apply it to the two-dimensional Hubbard model of fictitious particles, including the Bose- and Fermi-Hubbard models as special cases. By combining reweighting and $\xi$-extrapolation techniques, we access both half-filled and doped regimes. In particular, we demonstrate that the method remains effective even in strongly correlated, doped systems where the fermion sign problem hinders conventional quantum Monte Carlo approaches. Our results validate the applicability of the fictitious particle framework on lattice models and establish it as a promising tool for sign-problem mitigation in strongly interacting fermionic systems.

Title: Floquet theory and applications in open quantum and classical systems
Authors: Masahiro Sato, Tatsuhiko N. Ikeda
Abstract: This article reviews theoretical methods for analyzing Floquet engineering (FE) phenomena in open (dissipative) quantum or classical systems, with an emphasis on our recent results. In many theoretical studies for FE in quantum systems, researchers have used the Floquet theory for closed (isolated) quantum systems, that is based on the Schrödinger equation. However, if we consider the FE in materials driven by an oscillating field like a laser, a weak but finite interaction between a target system and an environment (bath) is inevitable. In this article, we describe these periodically driven dissipative systems by means of the quantum master (GKSL) equation. In particular, we show that a nonequilibrium steady state appears after a long driving due to the balance between the energy injection by the driving field and the release to the bath. In addition to quantum systems, if we try to simply apply Floquet theory to periodically driven classical systems, it failed because the equation of motion (EOM) is generally nonlinear, and the Floquet theorem can be applied only to linear differential equations. Instead, by considering the distribution function of the classical variables (i.e., Fokker-Planck equation), one can arrive at the effective EOM for the driven systems. We illustrate the essence of the Floquet theory for classical systems. On top of fundamentals of the Floquet theory, we review representative examples of FEs (Floquet topological insulators, inverse Faraday effects in metals and magnets, Kapitza pendulum, etc.) and dissipation-assisted FEs.

Title: Deep Learning-Driven Prediction of Microstructure Evolution via Latent Space Interpolation
Authors: Sachin Gaikwad, Thejas Kasilingam, Owais Ahmad, Rajdip Mukherjee, Somnath Bhowmick
Abstract: Phase-field models accurately simulate microstructure evolution, but their dependence on solving complex differential equations makes them computationally expensive. This work achieves a significant acceleration via a novel deep learning-based framework, utilizing a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) coupled with Cubic Spline Interpolation and Spherical Linear Interpolation (SLERP). We demonstrate the method for binary spinodal decomposition by predicting microstructure evolution for intermediate alloy compositions from a limited set of training compositions. First, using microstructures from phase-field simulations of binary spinodal decomposition, we train the CVAE, which learns compact latent representations that encode essential morphological features. Next, we use cubic spline interpolation in the latent space to predict microstructures for any unknown composition. Finally, SLERP ensures smooth morphological evolution with time that closely resembles coarsening. The predicted microstructures exhibit high visual and statistical similarity to phase-field simulations. This framework offers a scalable and efficient surrogate model for microstructure evolution, enabling accelerated materials design and composition optimization.

Title: Supercurrents and tunneling in massive many-vortex necklaces and star-lattices
Authors: Alice Bellettini, Vittorio Penna
Abstract: Recently, cold atoms mixtures have attracted broad interest due to their novel properties and exotic quantum effects with respect to single-component systems. In this paper the focus is on massive many-vortex states and their dynamics. Vortex configurations characterized by the same discrete rotational symmetry are investigated when confined within topologically nonequivalent geometries, and the relative stability properties at varying number of vortices and infilling mass are highlighted. It is numerically shown how massive many-vortex systems, in a mixture of Bose-Einstein condensates, can host the bosonic tunneling of the infilling component both in a disordered way, with tunneling events involving two or more close vortices, or in an almost-periodic way when the vortices are organized in persisting necklaces or star-lattices. The purpose is to explore a variety of situations involving the interplay between the highly-nonlinear vortex dynamics and the inter-vortex atomic transfer, and so to better understand the conditions for the onset of Josephson supercurrents in rotating systems, or to reveal phenomena that could be of interest for a future application e.g. in the context of atomtronics.

Title: Mesoscale variations of chemical and electronic landscape on the surface of Weyl semimetal Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ visualized by ARPES and XPS
Authors: Sudheer Anand Sreedhar, Matthew Staab, Mingkun Chen, Robert Prater, Zihao Shen, Giuseppina Conti, Ittai Sidilkover, Zhenghong Wu, Eli Rotenberg, Aaron Bostwick, Chris Jozwiak, Hadas Soifer, Slavomir Nemsak, Sergey Y. Savrasov, Vsevolod Ivanov, Valentin Taufour, Inna M. Vishik
Abstract: The multiple crystalline terminations in magnetic Weyl semimetal Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ display distinct topological and trivial surface states, which have successfully been distinguished experimentally. However, a model of pure terminations is known to be inadequate because these surfaces exhibit a high degree of spatial heterogeneity and point disorder. Here we perform a spectromicroscopy study of the surface chemistry and surface electronic structure using photoemission measurements in combination with first-principles calculations of core levels. We identify an intermediate region with properties distinct from both the sulfur and tin terminations, and demonstrate that the spectral features in this region can be associated with a disordered tin termination with a varying density of surface tin-vacancies. Finally, we show how a combination of algorithmic and machine learning analysis of photoemission data can be used to extract identifying features, classify spatial regions, and correlate local chemistry with local electronic structure.

Title: Focused Ion Beam patterning of MnSb(1-101) based spintronic devcies
Authors: Stuart N. Holmes, Jonathan Gough, Ethan Dommett, Gavin R. Bell
Abstract: Low temperature transport measurements are presented of ferromagnetic MnSb devices with the magnetic properties patterned using a Ga focused ion beam FIB system at 30 keV. FIB patterning introduces disorder and this is quantified in this paper through measurements of the longitudinal resistivity and the anomalous Hall effect contribution to the Hall conductivity. The MnSb structural phase is the niccolite phase with a surface state in addition to bulk states. FIB doses up to 1E16 Ga ions per square cm reduces the anisotropic magnetoresistance signal but increases the size of the anomalous Hall effect signal in out of plane magnetic fields, B. The anomalous Hall effect contribution to the Hall conductivity is e squared divided by h in the undamaged devices, where e is the electronic charge and h is Plancks constant. This quantity is sensitive to the level of disorder induced by the Ga ion beam, reducing to zero at dose levels greater than 1E16 Ga ions per square cm. The resistivity shows a logarithmic B dependence after the magnetization has saturated with the low field anisotropic magnetoresistance contribution of 0.12 percent. The conductivity change is e squared divided by h in the magnetic field range of logarithmic B behavior. The resistivity shows a reduced fit to a logarithmic B dependence at high FIB dose levels and is dependent on the damage uniformity.

Title: Unraveling the Molecular Structure of Lipid Nanoparticles through in-silico Self-Assembly for Rational Delivery Design
Authors: Xuan Bai, Yu Lu, Tianhao Yu, Kangjie Lv, Cai Yao, Feng Shi, Andong Liu, Kai Wang, Wenshou Wang, Chris Lai
Abstract: Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are a leading platform in the delivery of RNA-based therapeutics, playing a pivotal role in the clinical success of mRNA vaccines and other nucleic acid drugs. Their performance in RNA encapsulation and delivery is critically governed by the molecular structure of ionizable lipids and the overall formulation composition. However, mechanistic insight into how these factors govern LNP architecture and function remains limited, primarily owing to the challenges of capturing nanoscale assembly and organization using experimental techniques. Here, we employ coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to systematically investigate how ionizable lipid chemistry influences LNP self-assembly, internal organization, and surface properties. We further explore the effects of formulation ratios and pH-dependent deprotonation on both the internal structure and surface morphology of LNPs. Leveraging these insights, we demonstrate how in silico structural characteristics can inform the rational design of novel ionizable lipids and optimization of formulation ratios, supported with experimental validations. Our findings offer a molecular-level understanding of LNP assembly dynamics and architecture, thereby establishing a computational framework linking lipid chemistry and LNP formulation to the structure and performance of LNP, to advance the rational design of novel LNP delivery systems.

Title: Self-organisation -- the underlying principle and a general model
Authors: Raphael Blumenfeld
Abstract: Recent observations of coordinated self-organisation (SO) of stress and structure in granular systems provide insight into the fundamental principle underlying this phenomenon. It is first argued here that SO emerges when a minute subset of configurations are significantly more stable than the rest and therefore survive the noise in the system much longer to be observed. This principle goes deeper than recently proposed energy considerations. Guided by this principle, a statistical mechanics model is formulated then for SO in these systems and its extension to three dimensions is outlined. The principle holds beyond granular systems and the model is extended next to describe emergence of SO in more general systems. The application of the model is illustrated for the specific example of laning. Parallels of the modelling approach to traditional statistical mechanics provide useful insight that should assist in modelling SO in other out-of-equilibrium systems.

Title: Data-driven ANN model for estimating unfrozen water content in the thermo-hydraulic simulation of frozen soils
Authors: Mingpeng Liu, Peizhi Zhuang, Raul Fuentes
Abstract: This study integrates a data-driven model for estimating the unfrozen water content into the thermo-hydraulic coupling simulation of frozen soils. An artificial neural network (ANN) was employed to develop this data-driven model using a dataset from the literature. Thereafter, a numerical algorithm was developed to implement the data-driven model into the thermo-hydraulic simulation. In the numerical algorithm, the frozen and unfrozen zones are distinguished first according to the freezing temperature, where the unfrozen water at frozen nodes is updated using the ANN model. Subsequently, discretized hydraulic and thermal equations are solved sequentially and iteratively using Newton-Raphson method until the temperature and unfrozen water content satisfy the tolerance simultaneously. Horizontal and vertical freezing experiments are used to verify the reliability of the proposed algorithm. The computed variations in temperature, total water, unfrozen water, and ice content achieve good agreements with measured data. Some key features of frozen soils, such as water migration and ice formation, and the increase in total water content, are reproduced by the developed algorithm. Additionally, the comparison between the ANN model and existing empirical equations for determining unfrozen water content demonstrates that the ANN model offers a better performance.

Title: Exploring Weak Turbulence of Phonon and Magnon Beams in Magneto-Acoustic Ultrathin Films
Authors: Vladimir L. Safonov, Derek A. Bas, Andrew Franson, Piyush J. Shah, Michael E. McConney, Michael Newburger, Michael R. Page
Abstract: This study presents a simple theoretical model describing narrow envelope surface acoustic waves (phonons) and spin waves (magnons) in an ultrathin ferromagnetic film. Based on the general principles of weak wave turbulence, the model considers interactions between beams of an ideal phonon gas and a weakly non-ideal magnon gas, which represent magnetoacoustic oscillations in the system. Equations for the wave envelopes of phonons and magnons, along with their harmonics, are derived, incorporating nonlinear effects from three- and four-particle interactions. In the general non-resonant case, linear stationary envelope simulations are sufficient. These clarify the experimentally observed angular dependence of the transmitted acoustic signal with respect to the orientation of the magnetic field. The study highlights increased energy losses associated with enhanced magnetoacoustic coupling. Given the broad interdisciplinary interest in weak turbulence phenomena within condensed matter physics and nonlinear wave dynamics, our model offers significant predictive capabilities and greatly simplifies calculations of quasiparticle beam interactions.

Title: Characterizing and modeling the mechanical behavior of an anion exchange membrane for carbon capture applications
Authors: Sara Sarbaz, Zhi Xin Liu, Heidi Feigenbaum, Samaneh Bayati, Winston Wang, Jennifer Wade, Husain Mithaiwala, Matthew D. Green
Abstract: A new direct air capture (DAC) technology uses a moisture swing (MS) process with anion exchange membranes, potentially offering a more energy-efficient way to remove CO2 from the air. In this MS process, the membrane absorbs CO2 as it dries and releases it when water is added. Understanding the mechanical behavior of these membranes is essential for improving the design and efficiency of DAC systems and prolonging sorbent lifetime. This study tested one anion exchange membrane, Fumasep FAA-3, under mechanical loading and various temperature and humidity conditions to measure its swelling, stiffness, strength, plastic deformation, and stress relaxation. Experimental results were used to identify a mechanical model for FAA-3 that can be used to predict the material's nonlinear viscous behavior under various loads and environments.

Abstract: Superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) are exceptionally sensitive magnetometers capable of detecting weak magnetic fields. Miniaturizing these devices and integrating them onto scanning probes enables high-resolution imaging at low-temperature. Here, we fabricate nanometer-scale niobium SQUIDs with inner-loop sizes down to 10 nm at the apex of individual planar silicon cantilevers via a combination of wafer-scale optical lithography and focused-ion-beam (FIB) milling. These robust SQUID-on-lever probes overcome many of the limitations of existing devices, achieving spatial resolution better than 100 nm, magnetic flux sensitivity of $0.3~\mu\Phi_0/\sqrt{\rm{Hz}}$, and operation in magnetic fields up to about 0.5 T at 4.2 K. Nanopatterning via Ne- or He-FIB allows for the incorporation of a modulation line for coupling magnetic flux into the SQUID or a third Josephson junction for shifting its phase. Such advanced functionality, combined with high spatial resolution, large magnetic field range, and the ease of use of a cantilever-based scanning probe, extends the applicability of scanning SQUID microscopy to a wide range of magnetic, normal conducting, superconducting, and quantum Hall systems. We demonstrate magnetic imaging of skyrmions at the surface of bulk Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$. Analysis of the point spread function determined from imaging a single skyrmion yields a full-width-half-maximum of 87 nm. Moreover, we image modulated magnetization patterns with a period of 65 nm.

Title: The birefringent spin-laser as a system of coupled harmonic oscillators
Authors: Velimir Labinac, Jiayu David Cao, Gaofeng Xu, Igor Žutić
Abstract: Adding spin-polarized carriers to semiconductor lasers strongly changes their properties and, through the transfer of angular momentum, leads to the emission of the circularly polarized light. In such spin-lasers the polarization of the emitted light can be modulated an order of magnitude faster than its intensity in the best conventional lasers. This ultrafast operation in spin-lasers relies on the large linear birefringence, usually viewed as detrimental in spin and conventional lasers, which couples the two linearly-polarized emission modes. We show that the dynamical properties of birefringent spin-lasers under intensity and polarization modulation are accurately described as coupled harmonic oscillators. Our model agrees with the intensity-equation description which, unlike the common complex field components describing the role of birefringence in laser dynamics, uses simpler real quantities and allows analytical solutions. We further predict unexplored operation regimes and elucidate the difference between the weak and strong coupling in spin-lasers.

Title: Orbital Inverse Faraday and Cotton-Mouton Effects in Hall Fluids
Authors: Gabriel Cardoso, Erlend Syljuåsen, Alexander V. Balatsky
Abstract: We report two light-induced orbital magnetization effects in quantum Hall (QH) fluids, stemming from their transverse response. The first is a purely transverse contribution to the inverse Faraday effect (IFE), where circularly polarized light induces a DC magnetization by stirring the charged fluid. This contribution dominates the IFE in the QH regime. The second is the orbital inverse Cotton-Mouton effect (ICME), in which linearly polarized light generates a DC magnetization. Since the applied field in the ICME does not break time-reversal symmetry, the induced magnetization directly probes the chiral orbital response of the fluid at the driving frequency. We estimate that the resulting magnetization lies in the range of 0.5-10 Bohr magnetons per charge carrier in materials such as graphene and transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) in the QH regime. Finally, we show that the induced magnetization is accompanied by a local correction to the static particle density, enabling optical quantum printing of density profiles into the QH fluid.

Title: From trigonal to triclinic: Symmetry-tuned Rashba effects in buckled honeycomb SrHfO$_{3}$-based heterostructures
Authors: Okan Köksal
Abstract: Harnessing the interplay of symmetry breaking and spin-orbit coupling, we investigate Rashba spin splitting in buckled honeycomb (SrHfO$_3$)$_2$/(LaAlO$_3$)$_4$(111) superlattices using density functional theory (DFT) calculations with a Hubbard $U$ term and a Wannier-based tight-binding (TB) model. In the non-centrosymmetric $P1$ phase, pronounced Rashba-type splitting emerges near the $M$ and $K$ points accompanied by a helical in-plane spin texture, while the centrosymmetric $P321$ phase remains spin-degenerate. A Wannier-based tight-binding Hamiltonian, extended analytically with on-site spin-orbit coupling, reproduces the DFT results. A Rashba coefficient of $\alpha_R = 0.34$ eV$ \cdot$ Angstrom and energy $E_R = 29$ meV are extracted directly from the DFT band structure placing the system among moderately strong oxide Rashba materials. $\Gamma$-phonon calculation confirms the dynamical stability of the $P1$ structure and the results reveal the critical role of symmetry breaking and inter-orbital hybridization in enabling Rashba effects, supported by enhanced imaginary second-nearest-neighbor hoppings and Berry curvature. These findings establish SrHfO$_3$-based buckled heterostructures as a promising platform for engineering Rashba effects in oxide-based spintronic devices.

Title: Benchmarking total energies with Hund's J terms in Hubbard-corrected spin-crossover chemistry
Authors: Lórien MacEnulty, João Paulo Almeida de Mendonça, Roberta Poloni, David D. O'Regan
Abstract: The effect of the Hund's J terms in various DFT+U+J corrections to semi-local spin-density functional theory is assessed for a series of four octahedrally coordinated Fe(II) spin-crossover molecules spanning the covalent end of the ligand field spectrum. We report values and analyze trends for the Hubbard U and Hund's J parameters determined via minimum-tracking linear response for all valence atomic subspaces and relevant spin states in these molecules. We then methodically apply them via simplified rotationally-invariant Hubbard functionals in search of the simplest combination to yield reliable adiabatic energy differences with respect to those obtained using CASPT2/CC. The observed failure of canonical, positively-signed Hund's J terms in furthering the already robust capacity of DFT+U to obtain accurate energetics prompts an evaluation of their limitations when seeking to account for the static correlation phenomena in such strongly covalent systems and suggests directions for their improvement.

Title: Topological phases and spontaneous symmetry breaking: the revenge of the original Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model
Authors: Polina Matveeva, Dmitri Gutman, Sam T. Carr
Abstract: We study the interplay of spontaneous symmetry breaking and topological properties in interacting one-dimensional models. We solve these models using bozonization and identify topologically non-trivial phases by counting the additional degeneracy (affiliated with the edge modes) of a finite-size system relative to the infinite one. We find even if the mean-field solution is topological, this may not be true when it arises from spontaneous symmetry breaking, including in the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. This implies that the original SSH model, as presented by Su, Schrieffer, and Heeger, is topologically trivial, as opposed to its mean-field version. A spinful version, on the other hand, does exhibit a topologically non-trivial phase. In that state, both mean-field solutions are topologically non-trivial and correspond to non-interacting SSH chains in the opposite phases with the winding number $\nu=1$. We show that this phase is protected by a chiral symmetry, similar to the non-interacting phases.

Title: Path-Integral Formulation of Bosonic Markovian Open Quantum Dynamics with Monte Carlo stochastic trajectories using the Glauber-Sudarshan P, Wigner, and Husimi Q Functions and Hybrids
Authors: Toma Yoneya, Kazuya Fujimoto, Yuki Kawaguchi
Abstract: The Monte Carlo (MC) trajectory sampling of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) based on the quasiprobabilities, such as the Glauber-Sudarshan P, Wigner, and Husimi Q functions, enables us to investigate bosonic open quantum many-body dynamics described by the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) equation. In this method, the MC samplings for the initial distribution and stochastic noises incorporate quantum fluctuations, and thus, we can go beyond the mean-field approximation. However, description using SDEs is possible only when the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation has a positive-semidefinite diffusion matrix. In this work, we analytically derive the SDEs for arbitrary Hamiltonian and jump operators based on the path-integral formula, independently of the derivation of the Fokker-Planck equation (FPE). In the course of the derivation, we formulate the path-integral representation of the GKSL equation by using the $s$-ordered quasiprobability, which systematically describes the aforementioned quasiprobabilities by changing the real parameter $s$. The essential point of this derivation is that we employ the Hubbard-Stratonovich (HS) transformation in the path integral, and its application is not always feasible. We find that the feasible condition of the HS transformation is identical to the positive-semidefiniteness condition of the diffusion matrix in the FPE. In the benchmark calculations, we confirm that the MC simulations of the obtained SDEs well reproduce the exact dynamics of physical quantities and non-equal time correlation functions of numerically solvable models, including the Bose-Hubbard model. This work clarifies the applicability of the approximation and gives systematic and simplified procedures to obtain the SDEs to be numerically solved.

Title: Significant Mobility Enhancement in Coupled AlGaN/GaN Quantum Wells considering Inter-Well Distance and Asymmetric Widths
Authors: Le Tri Dat, Tran Trong Tai, Truong Van Tuan, Vo Van Tai, Nguyen Duy Vy
Abstract: We demonstrate that coupled AlGaN/GaN quantum wells with asymmetric widths ($L_1-L_2<30 $ A achieve up to 4.5 times higher mobility than single wells at optimal separation (d = 100 A). Crucially, mobility surpasses single wells when d>40 A reversing the trend at smaller distances. This enhancement stems from double-layer screening that suppresses remote/background impurities and dislocations, while LO phonon scattering remains unaffected. For identical wells, coupled systems underperform single wells at d<40 A but exceed them beyond this threshold. Peak gains occur at cryogenic temperatures (77 K). Our results provide a robust theoretical framework to optimize mobility in AlGaN/GaN heterostructures, reducing experimental trial-and-error in quantum device engineering.

Title: A Clarification on Quantum-Metric-Induced Nonlinear Transport
Authors: Xiao-Bin Qiang, Tianyu Liu, Zi-Xuan Gao, Hai-Zhou Lu, X. C. Xie
Abstract: Over the years, Berry curvature, which is associated with the imaginary part of the quantum geometric tensor, has profoundly impacted many branches of physics. Recently, quantum metric, the real part of the quantum geometric tensor, has been recognized as indispensable in comprehensively characterizing the intrinsic properties of condensed matter systems. The intrinsic second-order nonlinear conductivity induced by the quantum metric has attracted significant recent interest. However, its expression varies across the literature. Here, we reconcile this discrepancy by systematically examining the nonlinear conductivity using the standard perturbation theory, the wave packet dynamics, and the Luttinger-Kohn approach. Moreover, inspired by the Dirac model, we propose a toy model that suppresses the Berry-curvature-induced nonlinear transport, making it suitable for studying the quantum-metric-induced nonlinear conductivity. Our theory can be further extended to include disorder effects and higher-order quantum geometric contributions, paving the way for a more comprehensive and systematic understanding of nonlinear transport.

Title: Symmetry-adapted models for multifold fermions with spin-orbit coupling
Authors: Koki Satow, Ai Yamakage
Abstract: Multifold fermions, quasiparticles with multiple degeneracy protected by crystalline symmetries, exhibit a variety of intriguing phenomena stemming from their large topological charges and unique band structures. A comprehensive understanding of their response to external stimuli remains challenging, especially for types protected by nonsymmorphic symmetries where various degrees of freedom are intricately coupled. Here, we systematically construct effective models for multifold fermions that incorporate external fields based on crystalline symmetry. Specifically, we develop a $\boldsymbol{k} \cdot \boldsymbol{p}$ model for the threefold fermion protected by space group I2$_1$3 (No.~199) in the presence of spin--orbit coupling, and derive the terms for external fields. By complementing this with a tight-binding model, we investigate the magnetic field response and reveal the pair annihilation of magnetic monopoles. Furthermore, we construct a $\boldsymbol{k} \cdot \boldsymbol{p}$ model for the eightfold fermion in space group P$\bar{4}3n1'$ (No.~218), including its coupling to external fields. This work provides a robust theoretical foundation for advancing the study of external field responses and transport phenomena in multifold fermions, opening new avenues to explore their rich physics.

Title: Inertial Imaging of Dual Mass Distributions on a Graphene Nanodrum: A Computational Study
Authors: Adhinarayan Naembin Ashok, Sanjam Bedi, Taha Ashraf Ali Shaikh, Jai Aadhithya Ramesh, Adarsh Ganesan
Abstract: This paper presents the possibility for inertial imaging of spatially patterned annular mass distributions of a circular graphene nanodrum resonator. By placing two distinct analytes in concentric annular regions, we harness the vibrational mode-specific sensitivities of the nanodrum to estimate their respective mass densities. An analytical formulation based on the Rayleigh-Ritz principle is developed to relate radial mass loading to modal frequency shifts. Finite element simulations are performed in COMSOL Multiphysics to obtain the shifts in the resonance frequency of vibrational modes under varying geometrical configurations of annular rings. By processing these frequency shifts through a transformation matrix, we estimate the concomitant mass distributions of annular rings. The results indicate that the estimation errors are lower for analytes placed near the antinodal regions of the dominant vibration mode, with the lowest error being 1.82 % for analyte A and 2.03 % for analyte B. Furthermore, thinner annular rings demonstrate enhanced detection accuracy due to reduced modal overlap. This study demonstrates an analytical strategy for mass detection using a graphene nanodrum by providing insights into optimal analyte placement and structural design for high-precision multi-target mass sensing applications.

Title: Reducing critical current for spin-transfer-torque-induced magnetization reversal in CPP-GMR devices: effect of low damping and enhanced spin scattering asymmetry in $Co_2FeGa_{0.5}Ge_{0.5}$ Heusler alloy
Authors: Vineet Barwal, Hirofumi Suto, Yuya Sakuraba
Abstract: Spin-transfer torque (STT) in magnetoresistance devices has enabled key applications such as STT-magnetoresistive random access memory, spin torque oscillators, and energy-assisted magnetic recording. In the device structures, where a free layer (FL) magnetization is manipulated by spin injection from a spin injection layer (SIL), the critical current density required for operation is directly proportional to the damping ($\alpha$) constant of FL and inversely proportional to the STT efficiency, which depends on the spin polarization ($P$) of the materials. Here, we investigate the effect of low $\alpha$ and high $P$ of $Co_2FeGa_{0.5}Ge_{0.5}$(CFGG) Heusler alloy on the operation current required for STT-induced magnetization reversal in current perpendicular-to-plane giant magnetoresistance devices. Devices with CFGG as a FL material achieved a large reduction in the operation current, as compared to those with conventional NiFe-FL owing to the very low $\alpha$ of CFGG, demonstrating the advantage of CFGG as a FL material. As the advantage of high spin polarization CFGG for SIL, we analyzed the effect of bilayer SIL consisting of CoFe and thin CFGG layers, focusing on utilizing the spin scattering asymmetry at the CoFe/CFGG interface. Devices with the CoFe/CFGG-SIL exhibited the lowest critical current, demonstrating enhanced STT efficiency. In addition, the correlation of STT efficiency with magnetoresistance ratio were comprehensively investigated, showing that device-to-device distribution in STT-efficiency was smaller in CoFe/CFGG-SIL. These findings highlight the potential of CFGG Heusler alloy and CoFe/CFGG bilayer structures as key components for the development of efficient and stable STT-based spintronic devices.

Title: Efforts in Modeling the Mechanics and Chemistry of Energetic Materials Across Scales
Authors: Paul Lafourcade, Nicolas Bruzy, Paul Bouteiller, Jean-Bernard Maillet, Christophe Denoual
Abstract: Recent developments dedicated to the building of multiscale mechanical and chemical constitutive laws for energetic molecular crystals are presented and discussed. In particular, various tools have been specifically incorporated in molecular dynamics codes to facilitate the subsequent information transfer to the continuum, i.e. finite elements simulation codes. Atomistic simulations have been augmented with the capability to follow specific deformation paths as well as local Lagrangian mechanical metrics, enabling the computation of materials flow stress surface. This mechanistic library allowed the construction of a comprehensive non-linear hyperelastic continuum model including crystal plasticity and twinning for TATB. Besides, recent advances in analyzing reactive molecular dynamics simulations with unsupervised learning algorithms has enabled the identification and calibration of chemical decomposition kinetics for RDX and TATB single crystal. In the present work, the procedure is applied to $\beta$-HMX and extended with the calibration of a multi-components equation of state. These two ingredients are implemented in a finite-element code in order to model the shock-to-detonation transition at the mesoscale level and to study dimensionality effects in quasi-static hotspots. Finally, these dedicated efforts towards a comprehensive multiscale modeling of explosives has also given rise to the need for new prospective experiments, discussed throughout the paper.

Title: Intrinsic physical properties of flexible van der Waals semiconductor InSe
Authors: Jacob Svane, Kim-Khuong Huynh, Yong P. Chen, Bo Brummerstedt Iversen
Abstract: InSe is a van der Waals semiconductor in which mechanical flexibility, high electronic mobility, and non-trivial electronic structures converge, making it an attractive platform for both intriguing fundamental studies and promising device developments. However, the nucleation and growth of phase-pure, intrinsic InSe crystals require stringent thermodynamical conditions, and have therefore remained elusive. Since InSe melts incongruently, the widely used synthesis methods based on cooling of a 1:1 In-Se mixture will produce either aggregates of multiphase crystallites or uncontrolled In-rich, heavily electron-doped InSe. This fundamental thermodynamic constraint provides a compelling explanation for the large discrepancies observed in the reported physical properties of InSe. We overcome these limitations by utilizing the traveling solvent floating zone (TSFZ) method to produce high quality, centimeter-size InSe single crystals. Electrical, thermal, and thermoelectric transport measurements demonstrate that TSFZ-InSe single crystals closely approach the intrinsic limit, establishing it as a benchmark material for the future studies of this important material.

Title: Emerging electro-optic molecular crystals for optoelectronic integration
Authors: Keishi Sunami, Sachio Horiuchi, Yoriko Sonoda, Naomi Fujiki, Toshiki Higashino, Yuki Atsumi, Shoji Ishibashi, Jun'ya Tsutsumi
Abstract: The rapid advancement of communication technology necessitates the development of hybrid optical modulators that integrate silicon photonics with electro-optic (EO) materials to enable ultrafast, low-power, and compact photonic devices. However, no existing material simultaneously meets the requirements for high EO performance, process compatibility, and thermal stability, which are essential for practical optoelectronic integration. Here, we present 4-(4'-nitrophenylazo)diphenylamine (NDPA) and its derivative, novel nonlinear optical molecular crystals discovered through materials screening incorporating crystal habit prediction. They demonstrate crystallization into high-quality aligned thin films and ultrafine silicon slot fillings through the capillary action of melts. The resulting EO performance much exceed that of conventional lithium niobate and are comparable to state-of-the-art EO polymers, with excellent thermal stability maintained for over 1000 hours at 393 K. The present EO materials satisfying all the requirements above are promising candidates for silicon-organic hybrid optical modulators, opening a significant step toward scalable and high-performance optoelectronic technologies.

Title: Comparative molecular dynamics simulations of charged solid-liquid interfaces with different water models
Authors: Mahdi Tavakol, Kislon Voïtchovsky
Abstract: Aqueous solid-liquid interfaces (SLI) are ubiquitous in nature and technology, often hosting molecular-level processes with macroscopic consequences. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations offer a tool of choice to investigate interfacial phenomena with atomistic precision, but there exists a large number of water models, each optimised for a different purpose. Here we compare the ability of common water models to accurately simulate the interface between a charged silica surface and an aqueous solution containing NaCl. We first compare the bulk dielectric constant of water and its dependence on salt concentration for SPC/Fw, SPC/e, TIPS3p, H2O/DC, TIP3P-Fw, OPC3, TIP3P, TIP3P-FB, TIP3P-ST, FBA/e, and TIPS3p-PPPM, revealing large variations between models. Simulating the interface with silica for the most suitable water models (SPC/Fw, H2O/DC, TIP3-ST and TIPS3p-PPPM) show some intrinsic consistency with continuum predictions (Poisson-Boltzmann) whereby the free energy minima obtained from MD and the analytical model are in agreement, provided the latter includes the MD-determined total charge of ions in the Stern layer and dielectric constant. This consistency stands even for water models with a dielectric constant off by 10%. For salt concentrations higher than 0.21 M NaCl, the formation of random ion-ion pairs limits the reproducibility of the MD results and the applicability of the analytical method. The results highlight the applicability of the analytical model down to the nanoscale, provided a priory knowledge of the Stern layer charge is available. The findings could have significant implications for MD simulations of SLIs, especially at charged or electrified interfaces.

Title: Quantum Skyrmion Qudit in a Triangular-lattice magnet
Authors: D. Maroulakos, A. Wal, A. Ugulava, O. Kharshiladze, L. Chotorlishvili
Abstract: Since the pioneering work Lohani et. al., Phys. Rev. X 9, 041063 (2019), it became clear that quantum skyrmions have highly unusual properties as compared to the classical skyrmions and, due to their quantumness, cannot be described by continuous magnetic textures akin to the classical skyrmions. Competing nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions in triangular spin-frustrated magnets lead to the formation of quantum skyrmion states. In frustrated magnets, skyrmions are characterized by the helical degree of freedom, which can store quantum information. In the limit of a weak electric field, the system can be described as a two-level system, i.e., a skyrmion qubit. Here, we propose a more general formulation of the problem and obtain general analytic solution of the model previously introduced in Psaroudaki et. al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 067201 (2021). Our solution is valid not only for small barrier but for the arbitrary electric field. In the case of a significant barrier, we prove that the system's state is not a Skyrmion qubit as it was thought before, but a Skyrmion qudit. We constructed the density matrix of the Skyrmion qudit and studied its evolution in time. The obtained results suggest that the proposed model can be exploited further to meet the needs of quantum information theory and quantum skyrmionics. We showed that the $l_1$ norm of coherence of the skyrmion quantum qudit is a thousand times larger than the coherence of the skyrmion quantum qubit. The obtained result opens new perspectives for quantum skyrmion-based resource theory.

Title: Contact-induced molecular reorganization in E. coli model lipid membranes
Authors: Nicolo Tormena, Teuta Pilizota, Kislon Voïtchovsky
Abstract: Biological membranes are complex, dynamic structures essential for cellular compartmentalization, signaling, and mechanical integrity. The molecular organization of eukaryotic membranes has been extensively studied, including the lipid raft-mediated lateral organization and the influence of the specific molecular interactions. Bacterial membranes were traditionally viewed as compositionally simpler and structurally uniform. Recent evidence, however, reveals that they possess significant lipid diversity and can form functional microdomains reminiscent of eukaryotic lipid rafts, despite lacking sterols and sphingolipids. Yet, the impact of unspecific physical contacts on the local molecular organization and evolution of the prokaryotic membranes remains poorly understood. Here we use a model lipid membrane mimicking the composition of Escherichia coli's inner membrane to investigate the impact of contacting substrates on the membrane nanoscale evolution, when close to its transition temperature, $T_m$. As expected, the presence of a substrate lowers the $T_m$ by $\sim$10 °C and induces a differential leaflet transition. However, it also slows down the phase transition kinetics by almost 2 orders of magnitude while simultaneously enabling a spinodal-like lateral molecular reorganization. This creates local alterations of the phase of the membrane, with the emergence of mechanically stiffer, yet still fluid nanodomains evolving over substrate-dependent timescales, consistent with a substrate-biased lipid flip-flop mechanism. The results verify previous theoretical predictions and demonstrate that a general physical mechanism -- driven by membrane-surface interactions -- can spontaneously induce lipid domain formation in bacterial membranes. This is bound to have notable consequences for its function and mechanical role, including in processes like osmotic pressure regulation.

Title: The Magnetic Ground State of Atacamite Cu$_2$Cl(OH)$_3$: The Crucial Role of Frustrated Zigzag Chains Revealed by Inelastic Neutron Scattering
Authors: J. L. Allen, L. Heinze, R. A. Mole, S. Süllow, O. Janson, S. Nishimoto, R. A. Lewis, K. C. Rule
Abstract: We report inelastic neutron scattering (INS) measurements on the magnetically frustrated $S=\frac12$ sawtooth-chain compound atacamite Cu$_2$Cl(OH)$_3$ featuring inequivalent Cu(1) and Cu(2) sites. Transverse to the sawtooth chains, INS reveals two dispersive spin-wave modes and a gap of at least 0.75 meV. This behavior is rationalized within a zigzag-chain model of Cu(2) spins in an effective magnetic field of Cu(1) spins. The model is compatible with first-principles calculations and accounts for INS dispersions within linear spin-wave theory calculations. Our results reveal a unique case of an effective separation of energy scales between two differently oriented one-dimensional chains, with the zigzag-chain model being essential to fully characterize atacamite's low-energy magnetism.

Title: A theory of strange metals
Authors: Simone Fratini
Abstract: I present a theory of strange metals that is based on the following asumptions: (i) wavelike coherence is lost at each hop between neighboring atoms in the solid, i.e. the metal is bad, (ii) the carriers move independently from one another and (iii) the motion of the charge carriers obeys the correspondence principle, i.e. the quantum-mechanically averaged carrier diffusion in time is the same as in the classical case. The theory explains $T$-linear resistivity with apparently Planckian scattering rates as well as both the stretched Drude and displaced Drude peaks that are commonly observed in optical absorption experiments. The present framework might also indicate a solution to the problem of universal dielectric relaxation in insulators.

Title: Shear-driven memory effects in carbon black gels
Authors: Julien Bauland, Thomas Gibaud
Abstract: In recent years, significant effort has been devoted to developing smart materials whose mechanical properties can adapt under physical stimuli. Particulate colloidal gels, which behave as solids but can also flow under stress, have emerged as promising candidates. Resulting from the attractive interaction between their constituents, their network architecture exhibit solid-like properties even at very low volume fractions. This structural flexibility allows them to adopt various configurations and store structural information making them highly susceptible to memory effects. Shear flow, applied through rheometry, offers a simple and effective way to tune their properties and imprint a ``rheological memory'' of the flow history. However, the precise relationship between flow history and viscoelastic response remains elusive, largely due to the limited structural characterization of these systems during flow and after flow cessation. Here, we use ultra-small angle X-ray scattering (USAXS) to reveal a strong structural memory in the solid state, where the microstructure formed under shear is retained after flow cessation. We identify two distinct mechanisms of structural memory, as governed by the ratio of viscous to attractive forces, namely, the Mason number. Using recently developed fractal scaling laws, we show that the rheology is fully determined by the gel microstructure. Notably, these gels exhibit a double-fractal architecture, highlighting the remarkably broad range of length scales over which these disordered materials are structured. By clarifying how memory is encoded, our results offer strategies to tune shear sensitivity of colloidal gels and design smart materials.

Title: Solving Sudoku Using Oscillatory Neural Networks
Authors: Stefan Porfir, Bram F. Haverkort, Federico Sbravati, Aida Todri-Sanial
Abstract: This paper explores the application of Oscillatory Neural Networks (ONNs) to solving Sudoku puzzles, presenting a biologically inspired approach based on phase synchronization. Each cell is represented by an oscillator whose phase encodes a digit, and the synchronization is governed by the Kuramoto model. The system dynamically evolves towards a valid solution by having the puzzle constraints encoded into the weight matrix of the network, and through a proposed novel phase mapping of the Sudoku digits. Experimental results show that ONNs achieve high performance for puzzles with moderate difficulty and outperform Hopfield Neural Networks, particularly in cases with up to 20 initially unknown values. Although the performance decreases with increased ambiguity, ONNs still produce correct solutions in some of the iterations, cases in which the baseline Hopfield Neural Network algorithm fails. The findings support ONNs as a viable alternative for solving constraint optimization problems and reinforce their relevance within emerging non-von Neumann computing paradigms.

Title: Orientational Effects in the Low Pair Continuum of Aluminium
Authors: Thomas Gawne, Zhandos A Moldabekov, Oliver S Humphries, Motoaki Nakatsutsumi, Sebastian Schwalbe, Jan Vorberger, Ulf Zastrau, Tobias Dornheim, Thomas R Preston
Abstract: We compare the predictions of the dynamic structure factor (DSF) of ambient polycrystalline aluminium from time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) in the pair continuum regime to recent ultrahigh resolution x-ray Thomson scattering measurements, collected at the European XFEL. TDDFT predicts strong anisotropy in the DSF at the wavenumber examined here, even with $q$-blurring accounted for. The experimental spectrum has more than sufficient resolution and signal-to-noise levels to resolve these orientation dependencies, and therefore the orientational averaging of the polycrystalline sample is observed rigorously. Once the orientation averaging is accounted for, TDDFT is able to reproduce the experimental spectrum adequately. Finally, comparisons of predicted DSFs from jellium to experiment demonstrates the importance of accounting for lattice effects in modelling the spectrum from a polycrystal.

Title: Breaking Peierls theorem in polyacetylene chains via topological design
Authors: Xinnan Peng, Marco Lozano, Jie Su, Lulu Wang, Diego Soler-Polo, Thomas Tuloup, Junting Wang, Shaotang Song, Ming Wah Wong, Jiangbin Gong, Junzhi Liu, Franz J Giessibl, Pavel Jelínek, Jiong Lu
Abstract: Peierls theorem postulates that a one-dimensional (1D) metallic chain must undergo a metal-to-insulator transition via lattice distortion, resulting in bond length alternation (BLA) within the chain. The validity of this theorem has been repeatedly proven in practice, as evidenced by the absence of a metallic phase in low-dimensional atomic lattices and electronic crystals, including conjugated polymers, artificial 1D quantum nanowires, and anisotropic inorganic crystals. Overcoming this transition enables realizing long-sought organic quantum phases of matter, including 1D synthetic organic metals and even high-temperature organic superconductors. Herein, we demonstrate that the Peierls transition can be globally suppressed by employing lattice topology engineering of classic trans-polyacetylene chains connected to open-shell nanographene terminals. The appropriate topology connection enables an effective interplay between the zero-energy modes (ZMs) of terminal and the finite odd-membered polyacetylene (OPA) chains. This creates a critical topology-defined highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) that compensates for bond density variations, thereby suppressing BLA and reestablishing their quasi-1D metallic character. Moreover, it also causes the formation of an unconventional boundary-free resonance state, being delocalized over the entire chain with non-decaying spectral weight, distinguishing them from traditional solitons observed in polyacetylene. Our finding sets the stage for pioneering the suppression of material instability and the creation of synthetic organic quantum materials with unconventional quantum phases previously prohibited by the Peierls transition.

Title: Dynamical axion fields coupled with one-dimensional spinless fermions
Authors: Yuto Hosogi, Koichiro Furutani, Yuki Kawaguchi
Abstract: We investigate coupled dynamics of spinless fermions on a one-dimensional lattice and spins on the links. When the hopping integral and the on-site potential of the fermions depend on the direction of the link spins, the low-energy effective theory predicts that the link spins behave as a dynamical axion field in 1+1 dimensions. The axion field $\theta$ is coupled to the electric field $E$ as $\theta E$, through which the link spins rotate in response to the applied electric field or the chemical potential gradient for charge-neutral fermions. This is the inverse phenomenon of Thouless pumping in the Rice-Mele model. After analyzing the dynamics by approximating the link spins with the classical ones and utilizing the axion Lagrangian, we show the full-quantum dynamics using the tensor network method. Even though we do not explicitly introduce the axion Lagrangian in solving the fermion-spin coupled many-body dynamics, the full-quantum results agree well with those with the classical spin approximation, including the dynamics of the axion field and fermion transport. In addition, we find that the quantum correlation between spins accelerates the dynamics of axion fields as the suppression of the expectation values of the link spins allows them to rotate easily. We also propose a possible experimental setup for cold-atomic systems to implement the Hamiltonian in this study.

Title: Detecting entanglement with transport measurement in weakly interacting and fluctuating systems
Authors: Zhenhua Zhu, Gu Zhang, Dong E. Liu
Abstract: Measuring entanglement entropy in interacting, multipartite systems remains a significant experimental challenge. We address this challenge by developing a protocol to measure von Neumann entropy (VNE) and mutual information in quantum transport systems with both many-body interactions and multiple subsystems. Our analysis indicates that the vital connection between VNE and two-point correlation functions persists under these realistic conditions. The measurement is shown to be feasible for systems with boundary interactions and, critically, for bulk-interacting systems subject to a quantum quench of their internal couplings. Our work provides a pathway to experimentally quantify entanglement in complex interacting systems and establishes mutual information as an experimentally accessible indicator for system-environment entanglement.

Title: Classical-to-Quantum Crossover in 2D TMD Field-Effect Transistors: A First-Principles Study via Sub-10 nm Channel Scaling Beyond the Boltzmann Tyranny
Authors: Yu-Chang Chen, Ken-Ming Lin
Abstract: Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides present compelling prospects for next-generation low-power and high-frequency field-effect transistors. However, scaling 2D TMD FETs into the sub-10 nm regime remains challenging due to technical complexity. Moreover, short-channel effects in this length scale are not yet fully understood. In this work, we investigate the transport properties of 2D TMD nanojunctions with channel lengths from 12 down to 3 nm, using first-principles calculations that integrate the nonequilibrium Green function formalism implemented in density functional theory (NEGF-DFT) and an effective gate model. Our simulations reveal a classical-to-quantum crossover in electron transport during transistor downscaling, governed by two critical temperatures: Tc, which marks the crossover from thermionic emission to quantum tunneling, and Tt, beyond which thermionic emission dominates and the subthreshold swing approaches its classical limit. The shortest 3 nm junction exhibits pronounced quantum tunneling up to 500 K and achieves a subthreshold swing superior to the Boltzmann tyranny, enabled by the steep energy dependence of the transmission coefficient. This quantum-tunneling-enhanced switching behavior demonstrates the potential of ultra-scaled 2D FETs to surpass classical efficiency constraints, offering a promising route toward energy-efficient, quantum-enabled computing technologies. This study presents a predictive, atomistic methodology for quantifying quantum transport and identifies the transition in electron transport mechanisms from semiclassical thermionic current in long-channel to quantum tunneling in short-channel 2D TMD FETs, offering critical design insights for leveraging quantum-classical hybrid transistor technology.

Title: Cavity-QED-controlled two-dimensional Moiré Excitons without twisting
Authors: Francesco Troisi, Hannes Hübener, Angel Rubio, Simone Latini
Abstract: We propose an all-optical Moiré-like exciton confinement by means of spatially periodic optical cavities. Such periodic photonic structures can control the material properties by coupling the matter excitations to the confined photons and their quantum fluctuations. We develop a low energy non-perturbative quantum electro-dynamical description of strongly coupled excitons and photons at finite momentum transfer. We find that in the classical limit of a laser driven cavity the induced optical confinement directly emulates Moiré physics. In a dark cavity instead, the sole presence of quantum fluctuations of light generates a sizable renormalization of the excitonic bands and effective mass. We attribute these effects to long-range cavity-mediated exciton-exciton interactions which can only be captured in a non-perturbative treatment. With these findings we propose spatially structured cavities as a promising avenue for cavity material engineering.

Title: Avalanche Dynamics in Stick-Slip Cutting of Molybdenum Disulfide
Authors: Pawel Koczanowski, Paolo Nicolini, Hesam Khaksar, Enrico Gnecco
Abstract: We have investigated nanoscale wear on multilayered MoS2, the flagship transition metal dichalcogenide, by elastically driving sharp diamond tips under normal loads sufficient to induce in-plane fracture. The accompanying friction and the resulting wear structures were first characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM), revealing a stick-slip regime that drives progressive exfoliation of MoS2 chips. At high normal forces, the slip phase displays hallmark signatures of avalanche dynamics, observed for the first time at the nanoscale, evidenced by a Generalized Extreme Value distribution of friction force drops. The AFM characterization is corroborated by molecular dynamics simulations, which reproduce experimental trends and uncover atomistic details of the wear process, including local amorphization, layer curving, and the involvement of distinct dissipative channels. Notably, it appears that only one-fifth of the energy inputted into the system is used to damage the MoS2 surface irreversibly. These results offer new insight into the physical mechanisms governing friction and wear in layered solids and provide a framework for precision cutting and nanomachining in van der Waals materials, relevant to next-generation devices at sub-micrometer scales.

Title: Quantum thermalization in a dimerized J1-J2 model
Authors: Smitarani Mishra, Shaon Sahoo
Abstract: We revisit the J1-J2 frustrated Heisenberg spin-1/2 chain with dimerization ({\delta}) or modulation in the nearest-neighbor couplings to investigate its thermalization behavior. While the dimerization tends to induce localization, the next-nearest-neighbor interaction J2 generally favors thermalization, making the assessment of the model's compliance with the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH) particularly subtle. The challenge is further compounded by the model's SU(2) symmetry; the study of ETH compliance is necessarily done for each symmetry sector but separating different sectors of this symmetry is known to be a computationally demanding task. The current study is driven by two main motivations: first, to explore whether the well-known ground-state phases of the model have any bearing on its thermalization properties; and second, to understand how the interplay between two competing factors, namely, the non-uniformity (via {\delta}) and the beyond-nearest-neighbor interactions (via J2) governs the system's approach to thermal equilibrium. A systematic analysis shows that the ETH is most strongly satisfied for intermediate values of {\delta} (~ 0.5) with J2 ranging from intermediate (~ 0.5) to large (~ 1)- a parameter regime falls within the spiral ground-state phase. It is also found that when the system is in the gapless ground-state phase (which falls within the N'eel phase), the ETH is more prone to violation. In the regime of large {\delta} and small J2, the system is seen to enter a localized phase (characterized here by modulation in density-of-states; assessing ETH compliance is less meaningful for this phase.

Title: Oscillating chemical reactions enable communication between responsive hydrogels
Authors: Joseph J. Webber, Thomas D. Montenegro-Johnson
Abstract: Responsive hydrogels can sense environmental stimuli and respond as actuators by expelling water and changing shape. In this article, we develop theory to demonstrate that groups of responsive hydrogels can also communicate with each other, by utilising the effect of elastic deformation on chemical reaction dynamics. Specifically, we consider a system of two spatially-separated chemically responsive hydrogels suspended in a solution in which a Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ)-type reaction occurs. Solving for the gel dynamics with the transport of solvent through the poroelastic network and the chemical kinetics, we show how the periodic swelling-deswelling oscillations of each gel can become coupled, and how this coupling can be exploited to send signals from one gel to the other via mechanical manipulation of the sender that affect the local (and thus global) frequency of oscillation.

Title: Efficient spin-pumping and spin-to-charge conversion in epitaxial Mn$_3$Sn(0001) noncollinear antiferromagnetic films
Authors: Surya N. Panda, Ning Mao, Nikolai Peshcherenko, Xiaolong Feng, Yang Zhang, Anastasios Markou, Claudia Felser, Edouard Lesne
Abstract: The generation and control of spin currents are crucial for advancing next-generation spintronic technologies. These technologies depend on materials capable of efficiently sourcing and interconverting spin and charge currents, while overcoming some limitations associated with conventional ferromagnets and heavy metals. Kagome topological antiferromagnetic Weyl semimetals, such as Mn$_3$Sn, present unique advantages owing to their distinct magnetic order and significant Berry curvature-driven transport phenomena. In this study, we systematically investigate spin current generation and spin-to-charge conversion phenomena in epitaxial (0001)-oriented Mn$_3$Sn thin films. Our findings reveal a spin Hall angle of 0.9$\%$ and a nearly isotropic in-plane spin Hall conductivity of 44.4~($\hbar$/e) $\Omega^{-1}$.cm$^{-1}$ at room temperature, originating from a combination of intrinsic and extrinsic contributions, as discussed in light of first-principle calculations. Furthermore, in Mn$_3$Sn(0001)/Ni$_{81}$Fe$_{19}$ heterostructures, we observe a high spin-mixing conductance of 28.52 nm$^{-2}$ and an interfacial spin-transparency of approximately 72$\%$. Notably, we also find that the spin diffusion length in Mn$_3$Sn(0001) epitaxial films exceeds 15 nm at room temperature. Our results highlight the potential of the topological Weyl noncollinear antiferromagnet Mn$_3$Sn as an efficient material for spin transport and conversion in prospective spintronic applications.

Title: Droplet Removal by Capillary Lifting
Authors: Ke Sun, Jack R. Panter, Alvin C. M. Shek, Yonas Gizaw, Kislon Voïtchovsky, Halim Kusumaatmaja
Abstract: The removal of liquid droplets from solid surfaces is central to cleaning, coatings and oil recovery. Here we investigate liquid droplets capillary lifted by an immiscible working liquid. The rising working liquid triggers the formation of a capillary bridge between the solid and the air interface, which can lead to full, partial, or no droplet dewetting. Our theoretical model predicts, and experiments confirm, that the effectiveness of droplet removal can be tuned by manipulating the droplet contact angle with the solid and the interfacial tensions at play. Significantly, dewetting can be enhanced by employing working liquids with high interfacial tension, in contrast to common surface cleaning strategies where surfactants are used to reduce interfacial tension. Our findings can open new avenues for droplet manipulation with reduced resources and more sustainable environmental impact.

Title: Three-magnon scattering of spin wave on edge-localized mode in thin ferromagnetic film
Authors: Julia Kharlan, Roman Verba, Krzysztof Sobucki, Paweł Gruszecki, Maciej Krawczyk
Abstract: Three-wave scattering is a fascinating phenomenon with many applications in various technologies. Reducing the system symmetry greatly affects three-wave scattering, which, in this case, goes beyond the simple momentum conservation law. In this study, we examine three-magnon scattering at the edge of a thin ferromagnetic film, when a bulk spin wave interacts with an edge-localized propagating spin-wave upon the reflection. This creates new bulk spin waves at mixed frequencies by means of three-magnon confluence or stimulated splitting processes. Using our developed analytical theory, which has been confirmed by full micromagnetic simulations, we demonstrate that the amplitude of the wave generated in the stimulated splitting process is several times larger than that generated in the confluence process, primarily due to the lower group velocity. Furthermore, intensity of inelastically scattered waves exhibit a pronounced dependence on the incidence angle and frequency of the edge spin wave that goes beyond existing qualitative models. We show that the observed behaviors can only be explained by taking into account, that the scattered waves are created by several elementary three-magnon processes involving the incident and reflected waves. The complex nature of the scattered wave creation results in a strong sensitivity of its amplitude to the phase accumulation of spin waves upon reflection.

Title: Theory of nonlinear magnetoelectric transport effects in normal-metal $-$ magnetic-insulator heterostructures
Authors: Oliver Franke, Piet W. Brouwer
Abstract: Heterostructures of normal metals (N) and magnetic insulators (F) show paradigmatic effects, such as spin-Hall magnetoresistance and electric drag currents. These effects are linear in the applied electric field $E(\omega)$. Normal-metal $-$ magnetic-insulator heterostructures also exhibit a characteristic nonlinear response quadratic in $E(\omega)$, referred to as unidirectional spin-Hall magnetoresistance or spin-torque diode effect. In this article, we develop a theory of the bilinear response of FN bilayers and NFN trilayers for finite frequencies $\omega$ of the driving field and for four contributions that have been previously considered in the literature: Joule heating, phonon-mediated unidirectional magnetoresistance, the spin-torque diode effect, and magnonic unidirectional spin-Hall magnetoresistance. We identify their distinct dependencies on frequency and the magnetization direction of the magnetic insulator and examine their scaling with magnetic field and system geometry, providing a framework for experimental differentiation.

Title: On thermalization of a system with discrete phase space
Authors: A. Imparato
Abstract: We investigate the thermalization of a stochastic system with discrete phase space, initially at equilibrium at temperature $T_i$ and then termalizing in an environment at temperature $T_f$ , considering both cases $T_i > T_f$ and $T_i < T_f$. For the simple case of a system with constant energy gaps, we show that the relation between the time scales of the cooling and heating processes is not univocal, and depends on the magnitude of the energy gap itself. Specifically the eigenvalues of the corresponding stochastic matrix set the time scales of the relaxation process and for large energy gaps the cooling process is found to exhibit the shortest relaxation times to equilibrium while the heating process is found to be faster at all scales for small gaps. We consider both the Kullback-Leibler divergence and the Fisher information and its related quantities to quantify the degree of thermalization of the system. In the intermediate to long time regime both quantities are found to bear the same type of information concerning the rate of thermalization, and follow the ordering predicted by the dynamic eigenvalues. We then consider a more complex system with a more intricate stochastic matrix, namely a 1D Ising model, and confirm the findings on the existence of two regimes, one in which cooling becomes faster than heating. We make contact with a previous work where an harmonic oscillator was used as working fluid and the heating process was always found to be faster than the cooling one.

Title: Complexation of a Thermoresponsive Brush-Type Polyelectrolyte with an Oppositely Charged Surfactant: Effect of Temperature and Surfactant Concentration
Authors: Hernán A. Ritacco, Macos D. Fernández Leyes, Zulma Quirolo, M. M. Soledad Lencina, Cecilia del Barrio, Rafael Márquez, Jaqueline Fernández, Jhon Sánchez Morales
Abstract: Responsive drug delivery vectors can be designed using oppositely charged polyelectrolyte-surfactant complexes. As a model, we created a brush-type copolymer (PECop), combining alginate and Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm), whose side chains respond to temperature. Aggregation of PECop with the cationic surfactant dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide (DTAB) was examined versus surfactant concentration and temperature. We used surface tension, electrophoretic mobility, zeta potential, potentiometry, light scattering, and atomic force microscopy to analyze the complexes. PECop/DTAB complexes form spherical, monodisperse aggregates in certain surfactant ranges, even though the copolymer itself is polydisperse. The binding isotherms combine features of oppositely charged polyelectrolyte/surfactant systems and hydrophobically modified polymers. Compared to alginate alone, PECop binds six times more DTAB at 1 mM surfactant concentration. Temperature responsiveness depends on surfactant concentration (cs). The surfactant triggers progressive collapse of polymer chains, maximized at cs = 2.8 mM, where thermo-responsiveness is lost. For cs 10 mM, size increases above LCST. This inversion in thermal response with rising surfactant concentration suggests changing aggregate structure, offering new avenues for drug delivery system design using these polymer-surfactant complexes.

Title: Floquet odd-parity collinear magnets
Authors: Tongshuai Zhu, Di Zhou, Huaiqiang Wang, Jiawei Ruan
Abstract: Altermagnets (AMs), recently discovered unconventional magnets distinct from ferro- and antiferromagnets, have rapidly emerged as a prominent frontier in condensed matter physics. AMs are characterized by alternating collinear magnetic moments with zero net magnetization in real space, and spin splittings with even-parity symmetry in momentum space. However, their counterparts exhibiting odd-parity spin splitting remain largely unexplored. Here, based on symmetry argument, we show that such unconventional odd-parity magnets can be induced from collinear antiferromagnets. Remarkably, using effective model analysis within Floquet-theory framework, we demonstrate that circularly polarized light irradiation of conventional antiferromagnetic lattices induces both $p$- and $f$-wave magnets, realizing novel magnetic states dubbed Floquet odd-parity collinear magnets. Moreover, we also uncover light-induced antiferromagnetic Chern insulating states in the $f$-wave magnets. The proposed Floquet odd-parity magnet is confirmed by first-principles calculations of MnPSe$_{3}$ under circularly polarized light. Our work not only proposes a new class of unconventional magnets, but also opens an avenue for light-induced magnetic phenomena in spintronic applications.

Title: Automated Construction of Artificial Lattice Structures with Designer Electronic States
Authors: Ganesh Narasimha, Mykola Telychko, Wooin Yang, Arthur P. Baddorf, P. Ganesh, An-Ping Li, Rama Vasudevan
Abstract: Manipulating matter with a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) enables creation of atomically defined artificial structures that host designer quantum states. However, the time-consuming nature of the manipulation process, coupled with the sensitivity of the STM tip, constrains the exploration of diverse configurations and limits the size of designed features. In this study, we present a reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework for creating artificial structures by spatially manipulating carbon monoxide (CO) molecules on a copper substrate using the STM tip. The automated workflow combines molecule detection and manipulation, employing deep learning-based object detection to locate CO molecules and linear assignment algorithms to allocate these molecules to designated target sites. We initially perform molecule maneuvering based on randomized parameter sampling for sample bias, tunneling current setpoint and manipulation speed. This dataset is then structured into an action trajectory used to train an RL agent. The model is subsequently deployed on the STM for real-time fine-tuning of manipulation parameters during structure construction. Our approach incorporates path planning protocols coupled with active drift compensation to enable atomically precise fabrication of structures with significantly reduced human input while realizing larger-scale artificial lattices with desired electronic properties. To underpin of efficiency of our approach we demonstrate the automated construction of an extended artificial graphene lattice and confirm the existence of characteristic Dirac point in its electronic structure. Further challenges to RL-based structural assembly scalability are discussed.

Title: Ferroelectric Epsilon-WO3 Nanoparticles and Its Bipolaron Driven Opto-electronic Properties at Room Temperature
Authors: Mohammad M. Rahaman, Jose Flores, Mohamed Y. Noor, Md Mohsinur R. Adnan, Alex Blackston, Enam Chowdhury, Roberto C. Myers, Michael Newburger, Pelagia-Irene Gouma
Abstract: A unique polymorph of binary tungsten trioxide, the epsilon phase of WO3, has non-centrosymmetric ferroelectric structure, typically stable below -43 degree C in bulk. We have stabilized the epsilon-WO3 at room temperature (RT) and nanostructured powders via flame spray pyrolysis synthesis. These nanopowders are drop cast into uniform thin films to enable RT measurement of ferroelectric and optoelectronic properties. We report ferroelectric hysteresis, nanoscale domains, and dipole switching measured via Piezo-response force microscopy (PFM). The epsilon-WO3 films also display optical second harmonic generation (SHG) and anticlockwise ferroelectric butterfly capacitance versus voltage hysteresis, further demonstrating the ferroelectric nature of epsilon-WO3. Remarkably, epsilon-WO3 shows ferroelectric polarization responses to optical stimuli and form bipolaron at RT, a spin-zero quasiparticle previously found only in cryogenic temperatures. The bipolaron formation and its interaction with electro-optical stimuli results in a single layer solid-state blue coloration, a ferrochromic effect. A mechanism of the ferrochromic effect is discussed. In summary, epsilon-WO3 appears to be a ferroelectric with the simplest structure, forming bosonic spin-zero bipolaron at RT, and it's dipoles respond to opto-electrical signals; therefore, this material holds significant promise for transforming the field of optoelectronics.

Title: Interface Structure and Electronic Properties in Cubic Boron Nitride - Diamond Heterostructures
Authors: Cody L. Milne, Hector Gomez, Adway Gupta, A. Glen Birdwell, Sergey Rudin, Elias J. Garratt, Bradford B. Pate, Tony G. Ivanov, Arunima K. Singh, Mahesh R. Neupane
Abstract: Heterointerfaces of cubic boron nitride (cBN) with diamond have garnered significant interest due to their ultra-wide bandgaps and small lattice mismatch ($\sim1.5$\%), offering promising advancements in high-power and high-frequency electronic devices. However, the realization of this heterointerface has been limited by challenging growth conditions and insufficient understanding of interfacial properties. In this work, we employ density-functional theory to investigate the structural and electronic properties of diamond/cBN heterostructures as a function of interfacial stoichiometry, cBN thickness, and surface termination and passivation. Formation energies and interfacial bond lengths reveal that boron-terminated heterojunctions are the most stable while abrupt nitrogen-terminated heterojunctions are least stable, but can be stabilized by carbon-mixing. Bandstructures are computed for the heterostructures using hybrid functionals, where we find the abrupt boron-terminated and nitrogen-terminated heterojunctions exhibit $p$-type and $n$-type conductivity, respectively, while carbon-mixed heterojunctions retain wide insulating bandgaps ($4.2-4.4$ eV). The effective masses of the abrupt interfaces are found to vary strongly with stoichiometry. Intriguingly, charge analysis reveals two-dimensional electron or hole gas regions with ultra-high densities on the order of $10^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$, with distinct spatial localization on either side of the interface. Band alignments show type-I and type-II band offsets tunable by interfacial composition. Further analysis of the band alignments reveals that the diamond valence bands consistently lie above the cBN valence bands by $0.25-2.1$ eV. Interestingly, the interface termination type switches the relative conduction band position of diamond relative to the cBN conduction band, exhibiting a type-I to type-II band alignment transition.

Title: Design and demonstration of a direct air capture system with moisture-driven CO2 delivery into aqueous medium
Authors: Justin Flory, Samantha Taylor, Shuqin Li, Sunil Tiwari, Garrett Cole, Amory Lowe, Lindsey Hamblin, Samuel Piorkowski, Matthew Ryan, Thiago Stangherlin Barbosa, Jason Kmon, Nick Lowery, Joel Eliston, Jason C. Quinn, John McGowen, Matthew D. Green, Klaus Lackner, Wim Vermaas
Abstract: A moisture-driven air capture (DAC) system was designed and demonstrated. A laboratory-scale system delivering ~1 g CO2 per day was demonstrated in a laminar flow hood and a small pilot-scale system that could deliver ~100 g CO2 daily was operated outdoors in a 4.2 m2 (areal surface area) raceway pond. Elongated mesh tube packets were designed to contain AER beads with high surface area for contacting the air and were found to reduce drying and CO2 loading time ~4-fold over larger mesh bags. Whereas this system was designed for CO2 delivery for cultivating photosynthetic microbes, its potential uses are much broader and include CO2 use in the food and beverage industry, conversion to fuels and chemicals, and sequestration. Techno-economic assessments for a practical scenario based on current results are \$670/tonne to capture CO2 into an alkaline solution and an additional \$280/tonne to extract CO2 from solution, purify and compress to 15 MPa for sequestration. An aspirational scenario modelling reasonable improvements to develop AER sorbents with a capacity of 4 mmol CO2 per gram of sorbent and water uptake of 50 wt.%, which leads to sorbent drying and loading within 1 h, shows a potential to reach \$51/tonne to capture CO2 into an alkaline solution and an additional \$109/tonne to get to 15 MPa for sequestration. Life cycle analysis shows the aspirational moisture-driven process uses up to 87% less energy than thermal and/or vacuum swing DAC by using energy from water evaporation; however, ~330 wt.% water uptake by the sorbent contained in a hydrophilic mesh packets leads to ~33-fold higher water use than the thermodynamic limits, which emphasizes future research is needed to increase sorbent hydrophobicity while maintaining and further increasing ion exchange capacity needed to bind CO2.

Title: Enhancing the ergodicity of Worldvolume HMC via embedding Generalized-thimble HMC
Authors: Masafumi Fukuma, Yusuke Namekawa
Abstract: The Worldvolume Hybrid Monte Carlo (WV-HMC) method [arXiv:2012.08468] is an efficient and versatile algorithm that simultaneously mitigates both the sign problem and the ergodicity problem -- the latter being intrinsic to algorithms based on Lefschetz thimbles. We consider a situation in which the maximum flow time can be set to a small value, as occurs when WV-HMC is applied to the doped Hubbard model using a nonphysical redundant parameter. An optimal choice of this parameter significantly reduces the sign problem on the original integration surface and allows the maximum flow time to remain small, a feature that facilitates increasing the system size while keeping the computation time modest. However, as the worldvolume becomes a thin layer, it becomes increasingly difficult to explore it efficiently, leading to potential ergodicity issues. To overcome this limitation, we propose embedding the Generalized-thimble HMC (GT-HMC) into the WV-HMC framework. GT-HMC performs HMC updates on a deformed surface at a fixed flow time. Although it suffers from ergodicity issues due to infinitely high potential barriers at the zeros of the Boltzmann weight, it enables more efficient exploration within the allowed region. Furthermore, its molecular dynamics step size can typically be taken to be larger than in WV-HMC. GT-HMC is thus better suited for sampling regions where ergodicity issues are not serious. We provide a proof that GT-HMC can be embedded within the WV-HMC algorithm, and verify that the two methods -- the pure WV-HMC and the combined version -- yield consistent results within statistical errors for the two-dimensional doped Hubbard model on a $6 \times 6$ spatial lattice at $T/\kappa = 1/6.4\simeq 0.156$ and $U/\kappa = 8.0$ with Trotter number $N_t = 20$ ($\kappa$: hopping parameter).

Title: Classification of Average Crystalline Topological Superconductors through a Generalized Real-Space Construction
Authors: Sarvesh Srinivasan, Jian-Hao Zhang, Yang Qi, Zhen Bi
Abstract: We investigate a novel class of topological superconducting phases protected by exact fermion-parity symmetry and average crystalline symmetries. These phases belong to the broader class of average crystalline symmetry-protected topological (ACSPT) states and include numerous examples of intrinsic ACSPTs -- topological phases that arise only in the presence of disorder or decoherence. Unlike conventional symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases, which require exact symmetry protection, average SPT (ASPT) phases remain robust as long as the symmetry is restored on average across disorder realizations or mixed-state ensembles. To classify these phases, we extend the real-space block state construction framework to account for average crystalline symmetries. In this generalized setting, lower-dimensional cells are decorated with ASPT phases, and the obstruction-free conditions are reformulated to incorporate the constraints imposed by average symmetry at block intersections. This provides a physically transparent and systematic method for classifying ASPTs with spatial symmetries that are only preserved statistically. We further validate our classification using a generalized spectral sequence analysis, which serves as an independent consistency check. Our results demonstrate that many crystalline topological superconductors remain well defined under realistic imperfections, and they uncover a rich landscape of intrinsically average-symmetry-protected phases that have no analog in clean systems.

Title: Simulating high-temperature superconductivity in moiré WSe2
Authors: Yiyu Xia, Zhongdong Han, Jiacheng Zhu, Yichi Zhang, Patrick Knüppel, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Kin Fai Mak, Jie Shan
Abstract: The emergence of high transition temperature (Tc) superconductivity in strongly correlated materials remains a major unsolved problem in physics. High-Tc materials, such as cuprates, are generally complex and not easily tunable, making theoretical modelling difficult. Although the Hubbard model--a simple theoretical model of interacting electrons on a lattice--is believed to capture the essential physics of high-Tc materials, obtaining accurate solutions of the model, especially in the relevant regime of moderate correlation, is challenging. The recent demonstration of robust superconductivity in moiré WSe2, whose low-energy electronic bands can be described by the Hubbard model and are highly tunable, presents a new platform for tackling the high-Tc problem. Here, we tune moiré WSe2 bilayers to the moderate correlation regime through the twist angle and map the phase diagram around one hole per moiré unit cell (v = 1) by electrostatic gating and electrical transport and magneto-optical measurements. We observe a range of high-Tc phenomenology, including an antiferromagnetic insulator at v = 1, superconducting domes upon electron and hole doping, and unusual metallic states at elevated temperatures including strange metallicity. The highest Tc occurs adjacent to the Mott transition, reaching about 6% of the effective Fermi temperature. Our results establish a new material system based on transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) moiré superlattices that can be used to study high-Tc superconductivity in a highly controllable manner and beyond.

Title: Deep Kernel Bayesian Optimisation for Closed-Loop Electrode Microstructure Design with User-Defined Properties based on GANs
Authors: Andrea Gayon-Lombardo, Ehecatl A. del Rio-Chanona, Catalina A. Pino-Munoz, Nigel P. Brandon
Abstract: The generation of multiphase porous electrode microstructures with optimum morphological and transport properties is essential in the design of improved electrochemical energy storage devices, such as lithium-ion batteries. Electrode characteristics directly influence battery performance by acting as the main sites where the electrochemical reactions coupled with transport processes occur. This work presents a generation-optimisation closed-loop algorithm for the design of microstructures with tailored properties. A deep convolutional Generative Adversarial Network is used as a deep kernel and employed to generate synthetic three-phase three-dimensional images of a porous lithium-ion battery cathode material. A Gaussian Process Regression uses the latent space of the generator and serves as a surrogate model to correlate the morphological and transport properties of the synthetic microstructures. This surrogate model is integrated into a deep kernel Bayesian optimisation framework, which optimises cathode properties as a function of the latent space of the generator. A set of objective functions were defined to perform the maximisation of morphological properties (e.g., volume fraction, specific surface area) and transport properties (relative diffusivity). We demonstrate the ability to perform simultaneous maximisation of correlated properties (specific surface area and relative diffusivity), as well as constrained optimisation of these properties. This is the maximisation of morphological or transport properties constrained by constant values of the volume fraction of the phase of interest. Visualising the optimised latent space reveals its correlation with morphological properties, enabling the fast generation of visually realistic microstructures with customised properties.

Title: A Data-Driven Machine Learning Approach for Predicting Axial Load Capacity in Steel Storage Rack Columns
Authors: Bakhtiyar Mammadli, Casim Yazici, Muhammed Gürbüz, İrfan Kocaman, F. Javier Dominguez-Gutierrez, Fatih Mehmet Özkal
Abstract: In this study, we present a machine learning (ML) framework to predict the axial load-bearing capacity, (kN), of cold-formed steel structural members. The methodology emphasizes robust model selection and interpretability, addressing the limitations of traditional analytical approaches in capturing the nonlinearities and geometrical complexities inherent to buckling behavior. The dataset, comprising key geometric and mechanical parameters of steel columns, was curated with appropriate pre-processing steps including removal of non-informative identifiers and imputation of missing values. A comprehensive suite of regression algorithms, ranging from linear models to kernel-based regressors and ensemble tree methods was evaluated. Among these, Gradient Boosting Regression exhibited superior predictive performance across multiple metrics, including the coefficient of determination (R2), root mean squared error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE), and was consequently selected as the final model. Model interpretability was addressed using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), enabling insight into the relative importance and interaction of input features influencing the predicted axial capacity. To facilitate practical deployment, the model was integrated into an interactive, Python-based web interface via Streamlit. This tool allows end-users-such as structural engineers and designers, to input design parameters manually or through CSV upload, and to obtain real-time predictions of axial load capacity without the need for programming expertise. Applied to the context of steel storage rack columns, the framework demonstrates how data-driven tools can enhance design safety, streamline validation workflows, and inform decision-making in structural applications where buckling is a critical failure mode

Title: Additive Manufacturing of PEEK/Lunar Regolith Composites for Sustainable Lunar Manufacturing
Authors: Mohammad Azami, Pierre-Lucas Aubin-Fournier, Mehdi Hojjati, Krzysztof Skonieczny
Abstract: As humanity advances toward long-term lunar presence under NASA's Artemis program, the development of lunar-based manufacturing and construction (LBMC) capabilities has become increasingly critical. The high cost of transporting materials from Earth makes in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) essential, with lunar regolith serving as a promising local feedstock. Additive manufacturing (AM) offers a compelling platform for LBMC due to its geometric flexibility, material efficiency, and capacity for on-demand, site-specific production. This study investigates material extrusion (MEX) AM of polyether-ether-ketone (PEEK) composites containing 10 to 50 wt% lunar regolith simulant (LRS). PEEK and LMS-1D powders were melt-compounded via twin-screw extrusion, printed using a high-temperature chamber, and annealed at 300 degrees C. The samples were characterized through density measurements, thermal analysis, tensile testing, and microstructural and elemental mapping. All filaments exhibited densities above 96%, though as-printed porosity increased from less than 1% in neat PEEK to 7.5% at 50 wt% LRS due to elevated melt viscosity. Regolith incorporation enhanced crystallinity (17.4 to 20.5%) and elastic modulus (by 6-41%), while reducing delamination and warping, which improved dimensional accuracy and print success rates. Tensile strength declined gradually from 107 MPa to 90 MPa up to 40 wt% LRS, then dropped sharply to approximately 70 MPa at 50 wt%. Annealing improved density and stiffness for composites containing up to 30 wt% LRS, with marginal benefit at higher contents. Microstructural and elemental analyses confirmed a continuous PEEK matrix with uniformly dispersed regolith particles. This work establishes processing windows and trade-offs for regolith-rich PEEK composites, supporting ISRU-enabled AM of future lunar infrastructure.

Title: Phase-fraction guided denoising diffusion model for augmenting multiphase steel microstructure segmentation via micrograph image-mask pair synthesis
Authors: Hoang Hai Nam Nguyen, Minh Tien Tran, Hoheok Kim, Ho Won Lee
Abstract: The effectiveness of machine learning in metallographic microstructure segmentation is often constrained by the lack of human-annotated phase masks, particularly for rare or compositionally complex morphologies within the metal alloy. We introduce PF-DiffSeg, a phase-fraction controlled, one-stage denoising diffusion framework that jointly synthesizes microstructure images and their corresponding segmentation masks in a single generative trajectory to further improve segmentation accuracy. By conditioning on global phase-fraction vectors, augmented to represent real data distribution and emphasize minority classes, our model generates compositionally valid and structurally coherent microstructure image and mask samples that improve both data diversity and training efficiency. Evaluated on the MetalDAM benchmark for additively manufactured multiphase steel, our synthetic augmentation method yields notable improvements in segmentation accuracy compared to standard augmentation strategies especially in minority classes and further outperforms a two-stage mask-guided diffusion and generative adversarial network (GAN) baselines, while also reducing inference time compared to conventional approach. The method integrates generation and conditioning into a unified framework, offering a scalable solution for data augmentation in metallographic applications.

Title: Categorical Anomaly Matching
Authors: Andrea Antinucci, Christian Copetti, Yuhan Gai, Sakura Schafer-Nameki
Abstract: Matching 't Hooft anomalies is a powerful tool for constraining the low-energy dynamics of quantum systems and their allowed renormalization group (RG) flows. For non-invertible (or categorical) symmetries, however, a key challenge has been the lack of a precise framework to characterize and quantify anomalies. We address this by identifying tensor functors between UV and IR symmetry categories as central to capturing these constraints. To this end, we introduce Anomalous Simple Categories (ASCies) as fundamental building blocks of categorical anomalies. A given symmetry category may support multiple ASCies, each encoding distinct anomalous features. These structures naturally arise in the context of the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT), where tensor functors correspond to RG-interfaces between UV and IR SymTFTs, and ASCies are realized as particular such interfaces satisfying simple, universal criteria. We demonstrate the utility of this framework through examples involving anomalous 0-form, higher-form, and crucially, non-invertible symmetries in various spacetime dimensions.

Title: Demonstration of an always-on exchange-only spin qubit
Authors: Joseph D. Broz, Jesse C. Hoke, Edwin Acuna, Jason R. Petta
Abstract: In conventional exchange-only (EO) spin qubit demonstrations, quantum gates have been implemented using sequences of individually pulsed pairwise exchange interactions with only one exchange coupling active at a time. Alternatively, multiple non-commuting exchange interactions can be pulsed simultaneously, reducing circuit depths and providing protection against leakage. We demonstrate high-fidelity quantum control of an always-on exchange-only (AEON) qubit, operated using simultaneous exchange pulses in a triangular quantum dot (QD) array. We use blind randomized benchmarking to characterize the performance of the full AEON single-qubit Clifford gate set, achieving an average Clifford gate fidelity $F_{\rm C1}$ = 99.86\%. Extensions of this work may enable more efficient EO two-qubit entangling gates as well as the implementation of native $i$-Toffoli gates in Loss-DiVincenzo single-spin qubits.

Title: Learning the action for long-time-step simulations of molecular dynamics
Authors: Filippo Bigi, Michele Ceriotti
Abstract: The equations of classical mechanics can be used to model the time evolution of countless physical systems, from the astrophysical to the atomic scale. Accurate numerical integration requires small time steps, which limits the computational efficiency -- especially in cases such as molecular dynamics that span wildly different time scales. Using machine-learning (ML) algorithms to predict trajectories allows one to greatly extend the integration time step, at the cost of introducing artifacts such as lack of energy conservation and loss of equipartition between different degrees of freedom of a system. We propose learning data-driven structure-preserving (symplectic and time-reversible) maps to generate long-time-step classical dynamics, showing that this method is equivalent to learning the mechanical action of the system of interest. We show that an action-derived ML integrator eliminates the pathological behavior of non-structure-preserving ML predictors, and that the method can be applied iteratively, serving as a correction to computationally cheaper direct predictors.

Title: Biorthogonal Neural Network Approach to Two-Dimensional Non-Hermitian Systems
Authors: Massimo Solinas, Brandon Barton, Yuxuan Zhang, Jannes Nys, Juan Carrasquilla
Abstract: Non-Hermitian quantum many-body systems exhibit a rich array of physical phenomena, including non-Hermitian skin effects and exceptional points, that remain largely inaccessible to existing numerical techniques. In this work, we investigate the application of variational Monte Carlo and neural network wavefunction representations to examine their ground-state (the eigenstate with the smallest real part energy) properties. Due to the breakdown of the Rayleigh-Ritz variational principle in non-Hermitian settings, we develop a self-consistent symmetric optimization framework based on variance minimization with a dynamically updated energy estimate. Our approach respects the biorthogonal structure of left and right eigenstates, and is further strengthened by exploiting system symmetries and pseudo-Hermiticity. Tested on a two-dimensional non-Hermitian transverse field Ising model endowed with a complex longitudinal field, our method achieves high accuracy across both parity-time symmetric and broken phases. Moreover, we propose novel optimization routines that address the challenges posed by exceptional points and provide reliable convergence to the ground state in regimes where standard variational techniques fail. Lastly, we show, through extensive numerical evidence, that our method offers a scalable and flexible computational tool to investigate non-Hermitian quantum many-body systems, beyond the reach of conventional numerical techniques such as the density-matrix renormalization group algorithm.

Title: In situ Al2O3 passivation of epitaxial tantalum and aluminum films enables long-term stability in superconducting microwave resonators
Authors: Yi-Ting Cheng, Hsien-Wen Wan, Wei-Jie Yan, Lawrence Boyu Young, Yen-Hsun Glen Lin, Kuan-Hui Lai, Wan-Sin Chen, Chao-Kai Cheng, Ko-Hsuan Mandy Chen, Tun-Wen Pi, Yen-Hsiang Lin, Jueinai Kwo, Minghwei Hong
Abstract: Long-term stability of superconducting microwave resonators is essential for scalable quantum technologies; however, surface and interface degradation continue to limit device stability. Here, we demonstrate exceptional stability in microstrip resonators fabricated from epitaxial tantalum and aluminum films, protected by in situ deposited Al2O3 under ultra-high vacuum. These resonators initially exhibit internal quality factors (Qi) exceeding one million and maintain high performance with minimal degradation after up to fourteen months of air exposure. In contrast, devices relying on native surface oxides show substantial declines in Qi over time, indicating increased microwave losses. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveals that the in situ Al2O3 effectively suppresses interfacial oxidation and preserves the chemical integrity of the underlying superconducting films, whereas native oxides permit progressive oxidation, leading to device degradation. These findings establish a robust, scalable passivation strategy that addresses a longstanding materials challenge in the development of superconducting quantum circuits.

Title: Entanglement in Elastic Electron Scattering: Perturbation theory misses fundamental aspects of Bragg scattering
Authors: Stefan Löffler, Peter Schattschneider
Abstract: Elastic electron scattering is one of the primary means of investigating materials on the atomic scale. It is usually described by modeling the sample as a fixed, static, perturbative potential, thereby completely neglecting the quantum nature of the atoms inside. In this work, we present a quantum treatment of elastic electron scattering. We show that the interaction of the probe beam and the sample results in entanglement between the two systems, which can have far-reaching consequences, particularly on coherence and image contrast. As a timely example, we discuss decoherence in Bragg scattering on nanoparticles. We also investigate under which conditions the conventional scattering theory is recovered.

Title: Thermal and quantum phase transitions in a holographic anisotropic Dirac semimetal
Authors: Sebastián Bahamondes
Abstract: In this thesis we build a phenomenological, strongly coupled quantum field theory in $2+1$-dimensions through AdS/CFT holography, by building a $3+1$-dimensional, negatively curved gravity theory with a $SU(2)$ gauge field, and a scalar field in the adjoint of $SU(2)$. We locate a phase transition between two distinct phases at zero and finite temperature, which are characterized through the dispersion relation of quasi-normal modes of probe fermions in the bulk, and correspond either to a Dirac semimetal or a band insulator. These phases are separated by a critical phase/critical point (depending if $T>0$ or $T=0$, respectively) where the band structure of boundary fermions exhibits semi-Dirac anisotropy. We characterize each phase at $T=0$ by explicit solutions to the bulk equations of motion in the infra-red, and determine that the critical point's spacetime is a Lifshitz geometry, whose dynamical critical exponent is approximately equal to $2$. We also find that this anisotropy induces a non-trivial scaling of the shear viscosity-entropy density ratio with respect to temperature in the $T\to 0$ limit, and find evidence that the anisotropic phase of the system corresponds to a finite-temperature quantum critical phase.

Title: RinQ: Predicting central sites in proteins on current quantum computers
Authors: Shah Ishmam Mohtashim
Abstract: We introduce RinQ, a hybrid quantum-classical framework for identifying functionally critical residues in proteins, utilizing techniques in quantum optimization. To that end, protein structures are modeled as residue interaction networks (RINs), and the centrality detection task is cast as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem. Solved using D-Wave's simulated annealing, this approach is applied to a diverse set of proteins, including small peptides and biologically significant regulatory proteins. RinQ consistently finds residues that align with classical centrality benchmarks, underscoring the accuracy and reliability of the approach. This work highlights the promise of near-term quantum and quantum-inspired methods for advancing protein network analysis and lays the groundwork for future extensions to larger systems using real quantum hardware.

Title: The Philosophy and Physics of Duality
Authors: Sebastian De Haro, Jeremy Butterfield
Abstract: This monograph discusses dualities in physics: what dualities are, their main examples--from quantum mechanics and electrodynamics to statistical mechanics, quantum field theory and string theory--and the philosophical questions they raise. Part I first conceptualises dualities and discusses their main roles and themes, including how they are related to familiar notions like symmetry and interpretation. It also discusses the main simple examples of dualities: position-momentum, wave-particle, electric-magnetic, and Kramers-Wannier dualities. Part II discusses advanced examples and their inter-relations: particle-soliton dualities, electric-magnetic dualities in quantum field theories, dualities in string theory, and gauge-gravity duality. This Part ends with discussions of the hole argument, and how string theory counts the microstates of a black hole. Part III is an in-depth discussion of general philosophical issues on which dualities bear: theoretical equivalence (two theories 'saying the same thing, in different words'), scientific realism and the under-determination of theories by data, theory succession and the M-theory programme, explanation, and scientific understanding. It proposes a view of scientific theories that it dubs 'the geometric view of theories'. The book's treatment of the examples is at the advanced undergraduate and graduate level, starting from elementary and progressing to more advanced examples. The discussions of philosophical topics, such as referential semantics, theoretical equivalence, scientific realism and scientific understanding, are both self-contained and in-depth. Thus the book is aimed at students and researchers with an interest in the physical examples and philosophical questions about dualities, and also in how physics and philosophy can fruitfully interact with each other.

Title: Topology in Holographic Mean-Field Theory at Zero and Finite Temperature
Authors: Moongul Byun, Taewon Yuk, Young-Kwon Han, Debabrata Ghorai, Sang-Jin Sin
Abstract: We investigate topological invariants in strongly interacting many-body systems within holographic mean-field theory (H-MFT) framework. Analytic expressions for retarded Green's functions are obtained for all possible fermionic bilinear interactions in the limit of probe background limit $\mathrm{AdS}_4$, from which we construct topological Hamiltonians. Integrating Berry curvature over the momentum domain for the gapped spectra yields well-defined and quantized Chern numbers, enabling a systematic classification of them across interaction types. These topological invariants remain robust under deformation parameters like interaction and temperature, indicating that H-MFT encodes effective single-particle-state topology near a quantum critical point in strongly correlated systems. We point out why topological number is defined in the holographic theories while it is not in the perturbative field theory.

Title: A rigorous Keldysh functional integral for fermions
Authors: Philipp Benjamin Aretz, Manfred Salmhofer
Abstract: We provide a mathematically rigorous Keldysh functional integral for fermionic quantum field theories. We show convergence of a discrete-time Grassmann Gaussian integral representation in the time-continuum limit under very general hypotheses. We also prove analyticity of the effective action and explicit bounds for the truncated (connected) expectation values of the non-equilibrium system. These bounds imply clustering with a summable decay in the thermodynamic limit, provided these properties hold at time zero, and provided that the determinant bound and decay constant of the fermionic Keldysh covariance are bounded uniformly in the volume. We then give bounds for these constants and show that uniformity in the volume indeed holds for a general class of systems. Finally we show that in the setting of dissipative quantum systems, these bounds are not necessarily restricted to short times.

Title: Boosting hydrogen and methane formation on a high-entropy photocatalyst by integrating atomic d0/d10 electronic junctions and microscopic P/N heterojunctions
Authors: Ho Truong Nam Hai, Jacqueline Hidalgo-Jiménez, Kaveh Edalati
Abstract: The formation of green energy carriers such as hydrogen (H2) and methane (CH4) via photocatalytic processes provides a clean method for addressing environmental and energy issues. To achieve highly efficient photocatalysts for H2 and CH4 generation, the present work introduces the P/N heterojunctions in a high-entropy oxide (HEO) with d0/d10 electronic junctions. The study uses CuO as a P-type semiconductor and the HEO containing d0 (Ti, Zr, Nb, Ta) and d10 (Zn) cations as an N-type semiconductor. The material exhibits improvements in optical properties, such as light absorption, charge mobility and reduced electron-hole recombination. The integration of two concepts, atomic-scale d0/d10 electronic junctions and micro-scale P/N heterojunctions, leads to enhanced H2 and CH4 production. Particularly after the partial removal of vacancies in the heterojunction, H2 production from photocatalytic water splitting reaches 0.71 mmol/g.h, and CH4 evolution from CO2 conversion reaches 2.40 umol/g.h with 72% selectivity for methanation. The integrated strategy of this study has a high potential in developing active heterostructured catalysts for clean fuel production.

Title: Upper bounds for the connective constant of weighted self-avoiding walks
Authors: Qidong He
Abstract: Building on an earlier work by Alm, we consider a model of weighted self-avoiding walks on a generic lattice and develop a systematic method for deriving upper bounds on the corresponding weighted connective constant. These bounds are obtained as the dominant eigenvalues of certain matrices and provide detailed information about the domain of convergence of the model's multivariate generating function. We discuss potential applications of this framework to developing Peierls-type estimates for contour models in statistical physics with anisotropic weights, generalizing a technique recently introduced by Fahrbach--Randall.

Title: Flat bands, Dirac cones, and higher-order band crossings in twisted multilayer graphene
Authors: Bryan Li, Mengxuan Yang
Abstract: For the chiral limit of two sheets of $n$-layer Bernal-stacked graphene established in the Physical Review Letters arXiv:2109.10325 and arXiv:2109.11514, we prove a trichotomy: depending on the twisting angle, we have either (1) generically, the band crossing of the first two bands is of order $n$; or (2) at a discrete set of magic angles, the first two bands are completely flat; or (3) for another discrete set of twisting parameters, the bands exhibit Dirac cones. This new mathematical discovery disproves the common belief in physics that such a twisted multilayer graphene model can only have higher order band crossings or flat bands, and it leads to a new type of topological phase transition.

Title: Size-Dependent Skin Effect Transitions in Weakly Coupled Non-Reciprocal Chains
Authors: Yixuan Li, Linhu Li, Zhihao Xu
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems exhibit unique boundary phenomena absent in their Hermitian counterparts, most notably the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE). In this work, we explore a lattice model consisting of two coupled non-reciprocal chains, focusing on the interplay between system size, inter-chain coupling, and spectral topology. Using both analytical and numerical approaches, we systematically examine the evolution of the complex energy spectra and spectral winding numbers under periodic and open boundary conditions. Our results uncover a variety of size-dependent localization transitions, including the emergence and instability of concurrent bipolar skin effects (CBSE) in the $W=0$ region, and their crossover to unipolar and conventional bipolar NHSE as the system size increases. Notably, we demonstrate that these size-dependent behaviors persist even beyond the weak-coupling regime, highlighting their universality in non-Hermitian systems with complex spectral structures. This study provides new insights into the mechanisms governing skin effects and offers practical guidelines for engineering non-Hermitian topological phases in synthetic lattices.

Title: Soliton Transitions Mediated by Skin-Mode Localization and Band Nonreciprocity
Authors: Shanyue Li, Mengying Hu, Jing Lin, Chen Fang, Zhensheng Tao, Kun Ding
Abstract: Solitons, typically resulting from a competition between band dispersion and nonlinearity, occur in lattices featuring the non-Hermitian skin effect as nonlinearity increases, accompanied by a transition in localization from linear skin modes to solitons. However, localization does not disentangle the role of skin modes in the soliton formation from that of band dispersion. Here, in such lattices, we uncover two distinct soliton phases, skin-mode-assisted solitons (SMASs) and nonreciprocity-dressed solitons (NRDSs). Rooted in fundamentally different mechanisms, SMASs originate from skin effect, while NRDSs stem from band nonreciprocity, each exhibiting unique spatial profiles. Using a stacked Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-like model as a prototype, we delineate the phase diagram of SMASs and NRDSs, each having clear phase boundaries. To interpret them, we formulate a Wannier-function-based nonlinear Hamiltonian, showing that soliton formation depends critically on how skin-mode localization and band nonreciprocity suppress or enhance wave dispersion. For SMASs, skin-mode localization reduces wave broadening at the localization sites, thereby lowering the formation threshold. This soliton phase is observable from edge dynamics and accompanied by a dynamical stability reentrance when transitioning from linear skin modes. In contrast, NRDSs, as well as their thresholds, originate from bulk band nonreciprocity and persist under periodic boundary conditions. Our framework offers predictive tools for characterizing and engineering solitons in experimentally realizable non-Hermitian systems, spanning optics to mechanics.

Title: Hollow Lattice Tensor Gauge Theories with Bosonic Matter
Authors: José M. Cruz, Masafumi Udagawa, Pedro Bicudo, Pedro Ribeiro, Paul A. McClarty
Abstract: Higher rank gauge theories are generalizations of electromagnetism where, in addition to overall charge conservation, there is also conservation of higher rank multipoles such as the total dipole moment. In this work we study a four dimensional lattice tensor gauge theory coupled to bosonic matter which has second rank tensor electric and magnetic fields and charge conservation on individual planes. Starting from the Hamiltonian, we derive the lattice action for the gauge fields coupled to $q=1,2$ charged scalars. We use the action formulation to carry out Monte Carlo simulations to map the phase diagram as a function of the gauge ($\beta$) and matter ($\kappa$) couplings. We compute the nature of correlators at strong and weak coupling in the pure gauge theory and compare the results to numerical simulations. Simulations show that the naive weak coupling regime (small $\kappa$, large $\beta$) does not survive in the thermodynamic limit. Instead, the strong coupling confined phase, spans the whole phase diagram. It is a proliferation of instantons that destroys the weak coupling phase and we show, via a duality transformation, that the expected strong confinement is present in the analog of Wilson line correlators. For finite matter coupling at $q=1$ we find a single thermodynamic phase albeit with a first order phase transition terminating in a critical this http URL $q=2$ it is known that the the X-cube model with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ fractonic topological order is recovered deep in the Higgs regime. The simulations indeed reveal a distinct Higgs phase in this case.

Title: Quantum Cluster State Spin Chain with Ising Fusion Category Symmetry: A Perspective from Weak Hopf SymTFT
Authors: Zhian Jia
Abstract: In this work, we present a construction of a cluster state lattice Hamiltonian that exhibits the symmetry of the Ising fusion algebra. This construction is formulated within the framework of weak Hopf symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT), where we assign smooth and rough boundaries to the weak Hopf quantum double model, thereby extending the conventional cluster state model. Central to our construction is the weak Hopf Ising boundary tube algebra $\mathcal{T}_{\mathsf{Ising}}$, whose representation category is equivalent to the Ising fusion category $\mathsf{Ising}$. We take this algebra as the input data for the weak Hopf quantum double model. The resulting model exhibits Ising fusion symmetry on both open and closed $1\text{d}$ manifolds. On open manifolds, the symmetry is governed by $\mathcal{T}_{\mathsf{Ising}} \otimes \mathcal{T}_{\mathsf{Ising}}^{\vee}$; on closed manifolds, it reduces to $\operatorname{Cocom}(\mathcal{T}_{\mathsf{Ising}}) \otimes \operatorname{Cocom}(\mathcal{T}_{\mathsf{Ising}}^{\vee})$. Since the Ising fusion algebra embeds into $\operatorname{Cocom}(\mathcal{T}_{\mathsf{Ising}}^{\vee})$, the model faithfully realizes the symmetry of the Ising fusion category.

Title: Gauge theory approach to describe ice crystals habit evolution in ice clouds
Authors: Gianluca Di Natale, Francesco Pio De Cosmo, Leandro Cieri
Abstract: Ice clouds, particularly cirrus clouds, significantly influence Earth's radiative balance but remain poorly characterized in current climate models. A major uncertainty arises from the variability of their microphysical properties, especially the evolution of ice crystal habits under depositional growth. We propose a heuristic method to describe habit evolution based on four fundamental shapes identified in the literature and from in situ observations: droxtals, plates, columns, and rosettes. These represent the primary forms that are relevant under depositional growth, excluding aggregation. In this study, we employ a non-Abelian gauge theory within a field-theoretical framework, imposing an SU(2) $\otimes$ U(1) symmetry on the fields associated with each habit probability growth. This symmetry enables the derivation of a modified system of coupled Fokker-Planck equations, capturing the stochastic growth dynamics of ice crystals while incorporating phenomenological mutual influences among habits. This framework outlines a novel theoretical direction for integrating symmetry principles and field-theoretical tools into the modelling of habit dynamics in ice clouds.

Title: Co-designed reflective and leaky-waveguide low-pass filter for superconducting circuits
Authors: Linus Andersson, Benjamin Olsson, Simone Gasparinetti, Robert Rehammar
Abstract: A stepped-impedance low-pass filter with integrated hollow waveguide absorbers is presented. The filter combines low insertion loss in the passband with strong attenuation at high frequencies, making it well suited for superconducting quantum computing applications, where qubits are sensitive to both near-band and far out-of-band radiation. The structure is implemented in a rectangular coaxial geometry, with inductive sections coupled to circular hollow waveguides oriented orthogonally to the transmission axis. Above their cutoff frequency, these waveguides efficiently couple to radiation inside the stepped-impedance filter, absorbing energy that would otherwise cause Cooper pair breaking in conventional superconductors. Optimal dimensions were obtained using a differential evolution algorithm applied to interpolated electromagnetic simulation data. A prototype was fabricated and characterized using a calibrated vector network analyzer up to 67 GHz. Measurements confirm a 3 dB cutoff frequency at 13.5 GHz, insertion loss below 0.45 dB for frequencies under 8 GHz, and more than 52.7 dB rejection above 17.3 GHz. The design offers a compact, low-loss solution for near-band filtering and suppression of quasiparticle-generating radiation in cryogenic quantum systems.

Title: Thermal effects in conformal field theories
Authors: Alessio Miscioscia
Abstract: Conformal Field Theories (CFTs) are special classes of quantum field theories that find applications ranging from critical phenomena to theories of quantum gravity via holography. Understanding thermal effects in CFTs is crucial: criticality is experimentally probed at finite temperature, and, from the holographic perspective, the study of thermal CFTs is dual to the study of black holes in Anti-de Sitter space. In this thesis, we explore the kinematics and dynamics of finite-temperature CFTs by analyzing broken and unbroken symmetries and adapting various analytical and numerical bootstrap approaches to finite-temperature correlation functions. These methods are non-perturbatively valid and can be tested against exactly solvable models, such as free theories and two-dimensional systems, as well as compared with perturbative calculations. The main applications discussed in this thesis concern one- and two-point functions and the free energy density in the O(N) models in three dimensions, with particular focus on the 3d Ising, XY, and Heisenberg models (N = 1,2,3).

Title: The analytically tractable zoo of similarity-induced exceptional structures
Authors: Anton Montag, Jordan Isaacs, Marcus Stålhammar, Flore K. Kunst
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs) are non-Hermitian spectral degeneracies marking a simultaneous coalescence of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Despite the fact that multiband $n$-fold EPs (EP$n$s) generically emerge as special points on manifolds of EP$m$s, where $m<n$, EP$n$s as well as their topological properties have hitherto been studied as isolated objects. In this work we address this issue and carefully map out the emerging properties of multifold exceptional structures in three and four dimensions under the influence of one or multiple generalized similarities, revealing diverse combinations of EP$m$s in direct connection to EP$n$s. We find that simply counting the number of constraints defining the EP$n$s is not sufficient in the presence of similarities; the constraints can also be satisfied by the EP$m$-manifolds obeying certain spectral symmetries in the complex eigenvalue plane, reducing their dimension beyond what is expected from counting the number of constraints. Furthermore, the induced spectral symmetries not always allow for any EP$m$-manifold to emerge in $n$-band systems, making the plethora of exceptional structures deviate further from naive expectations. We illustrate our findings in simple periodic toy models. By relying on similarity relations instead of the less general symmetries, we simultaneously cover several physically relevant scenarios, ranging from optics and topolectrical circuits, to open quantum systems. This makes our predictions highly relevant and broadly applicable in modern research, as well as experimentally viable within various branches of physics.

Abstract: The Markov length was recently proposed as an information-theoretic diagnostic for quantum mixed-state phase transitions [Sang & Hsieh, Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 070403 (2025)]. Here, we show that the Markov length diverges even under classical stochastic dynamics, when a low-temperature ordered state is quenched into the high temperature phase. Conventional observables do not exhibit growing length scales upon quenching into the high-temperature phase; however, the Markov length grows exponentially in time. Consequently, the state of a system as it heats becomes increasingly non-Gibbsian, and the range of its putative "parent Hamiltonian" must diverge with the Markov length. From this information-theoretic point of view the late-time limit of thermalization is singular. We introduce a numerical technique for computing the Markov length based on matrix-product states, and explore its dynamics under general thermal quenches in the one-dimensional classical Ising model. For all cases, we provide simple information-theoretic arguments that explain our results.

Title: Neural subspaces, minimax entropy, and mean-field theory for networks of neurons
Authors: Luca Di Carlo, Francesca Mignacco, Christopher W. Lynn, William Bialek
Abstract: Recent advances in experimental techniques enable the simultaneous recording of activity from thousands of neurons in the brain, presenting both an opportunity and a challenge: to build meaningful, scalable models of large neural populations. Correlations in the brain are typically weak but widespread, suggesting that a mean-field approach might be effective in describing real neural populations, and we explore a hierarchy of maximum entropy models guided by this idea. We begin with models that match only the mean and variance of the total population activity, and extend to models that match the experimentally observed mean and variance of activity along multiple projections of the neural state. Confronted by data from several different brain regions, these models are driven toward a first-order phase transition, characterized by the presence of two nearly degenerate minima in the energy landscape, and this leads to predictions in qualitative disagreement with other features of the data. To resolve this problem we introduce a novel class of models that constrain the full probability distribution of activity along selected projections. We develop the mean-field theory for this class of models and apply it to recordings from 1000+ neurons in the mouse hippocampus. This 'distributional mean--field' model provides an accurate and consistent description of the data, offering a scalable and principled approach to modeling complex neural population dynamics.

Title: A magnetic tight-binding model: surface properties of transition metals and cobalt nanoparticles
Authors: Jacques R. Eone
Abstract: The magnetic and surface properties of some transition metals have been investigated within the tight-binding approximation, including Coulomb correlations. These surface properties are calculated after applying a charge neutrality rule that is restricted to the d-band. This formalism gives a charge distribution containing delocalized sp-states in agreement with a linear muffin-tin orbital calculation. It enables the description of local magnetism, surface energies, and work functions without recourse to the total energy. The present investigation is focused on the study of fcc cobalt, bcc iron, fcc nickel, and fcc platinum surfaces, as well as an exploration of fcc cobalt nanoparticles.

Title: Tight-binding model: correction of the d-band approximation
Authors: Jacques R. Eone
Abstract: The electronic structure, when restricted to the d-band approximation, is a computational model that is both efficient and useful for describing transition metals. In the absence of considering delocalized sp-states, this approximation gives rise to incorrect surface energies, binding energies, and an inaccurate description of ferromagnetic transition metals. The present work compares the complexity of implementing corrections with the possibility of using an accurate sp-d approach. Basic force fields based on the second moment approximation continue to be utilized for the description of interactions in transition metals. In contrast, the present study proposes an elementary and more accurate interatomic potential based on hopping parameters depending on distances. The charge distribution and the Stoner model are also analyzed to provide appropriate corrections to the tight-binding picture used to describe ferromagnetic metals and alloys.

Title: Three-band extension for the Glashow-Weinberg-Salam model
Authors: Konstantin V. Grigorishin
Abstract: By analogy with the Ginzburg-Landau theory of multi-band superconductors with inner (interband) Josephson couplings we formulate the three-band Glashow-Weinberg-Salam model with weak Josephson couplings between strongly asymmetrical condensates of scalar (Higgs) fields. Unlike usual single-band model, we found three Higgs bosons corresponding to three generations of particles, moreover the heaviest of them corresponds to the already discovered H-boson and decays into fermions of only the third generation through Yukawa interaction. The other two decay into fermions of the first and second generations accordingly, but they are difficult to observe due to very poor conditions for production. We found two sterile ultra-light Leggett bosons, the Bose condensates of which form the dark halos of galaxies and their clusters (i.e so called "dark matter"). The masses of the Leggett bosons are determined by the coefficient of the interband coupling and can be arbitrarily small ($\sim 10^{-20}\mathrm{eV}$) due to non-perturbativeness of the interband coupling. Since propagation of Leggett bosons is not accompanied by current, these bosons are not absorbed by gauge fields unlike the common-mode Goldstone bosons. Three coupled condensates of the scalar fields are related to the existence of three generations of leptons, where each generation interacts with the corresponding condensate getting mass. The interflavour mixing between the generations of active neutrinos and sterile right-handed neutrinos in the three-band system causes the existence of mass states of neutrino without interaction with the Higgs condensates.

Title: Discovery of Itinerant Magnetic Domain Wall and Quasiparticle Boundary State in Spin-Density-Waves
Authors: Yining Hu, Xu Wang, Chen Chen, Qingle Zhang, Dongming Zhao, Tianzhen Zhang, Chenxi Wang, Qiang-Hua Wang, Donglai Feng, Tong Zhang
Abstract: Conventional magnetic domain walls are characterized by reorientation of local spins. However, what occurs at the boundary of itinerant magnets is largely unknown. Here using spin-sensitive scanning tunneling microscopy, we investigated the microscopic domain wall structure of the spin-density-wave (SDW) state in a prototypical itinerant antiferromagnet - chromium (Cr). At the boundary of two incommensurate SDW domains, we found the spins undergo finite-scale decay rather than reorientation. This generates a double-Q SDW state, which is further evidenced by an accompanying second-order charge modulation. In the commensurate SDW domains, a clear SDW energy gap is observed. Interestingly, the screw dislocations induced half vortex and anti-vortex of SDW, paired by antiphase domain wall. The spin density vanished at such antiphase domain walls. Remarkably, for the first time we observed the SDW quasiparticle states at the boundary, resembling the Andreev bound states in superconductors. These unique SDW boundary structures can be viewed as consequences of local interference of two SDWs, either with different Q or reversed phases. Our findings thus reveal a new type of domain wall distinct to that of local moment magnetism, with a mechanism rooted in the itinerant nature of SDW.

Title: Supercurrent diode with high winding vortex
Authors: Yuri Fukaya, Maria Teresa Mercaldo, Daniel Margineda, Alessandro Crippa, Elia Strambini, Francesco Giazotto, Carmine Ortix, Mario Cuoco
Abstract: We investigate supercurrent nonreciprocal effects in a superconducting weak-link hosting distinct types of vortices. We demonstrate how the winding number of the vortex, its spatial configuration, and the shape of the superconducting lead can steer the sign and amplitude of the supercurrent rectification. We find a general criterion for the vortex pattern to maximize the rectification amplitude of the supercurrent. The underlying strategy is the search for specific vortex core positions yielding a vanishing amplitude of the supercurrent first harmonic. We also prove that supercurrent nonreciprocal effects can be used to diagnose high-winding vortex and to distinguish between different types of vorticity. Our results thus provide a toolkit to control the supercurrent rectification by means of vortex phase textures and nonreciprocal signatures to detect vortex states with nonstandard phase patterns.

Title: Entanglement patterns of quantum chaotic Hamiltonians with a scalar U(1) charge
Authors: Christopher M. Langlett, Joaquin F. Rodriguez-Nieva
Abstract: Our current understanding of quantum chaos in many-body quantum systems hinges on the random matrix theory(RMT) behavior of eigenstates and their energy level statistics. Although RMT has been remarkably successful in describing `coarse' features of many-body quantum Hamiltonians in chaotic regimes, such as the Wigner-Dyson level spacing statistics or the volume-law behavior of eigenstate entanglement entropy, it remains a challenge to describe their `finer' features, particularly those arising from spatial locality. Here, we show that we can accurately describe the statistical behavior of eigenstate ensembles in many-body Hamiltonians by using pure random states with physical constraints that capture the essential features of the Hamiltonian, specifically spatial locality and symmetries. We demonstrate our approach on local spin Hamiltonians with a scalar U(1) charge. By constructing ensembles of constrained random states that account for two commuting scalar charges playing the role of energy and magnetization, we describe the patterns of entanglement of mid-spectrum eigenstates beyond their average volume-law behavior, including $O(1)$ corrections and fluctuations, analytically and numerically. When defining the correspondence between quantum chaotic eigenstates in many-body Hamiltonians and RMT ensembles, our work highlights the important role played by spatial locality in describing universal features beyond the volume-law behavior.

Title: Topology in the Random Scattering of Light
Authors: Tobias Micklitz, Alexander Altland
Abstract: Light scattering in random media is usually considered within the framework of the three-dimensional Anderson universality class, with modifications for the vector nature of electromagnetic waves. We propose that the linear dispersiveness of light introduces topological aspects into the picture. The dynamics of electromagnetic waves follow the same differential equations as those of a spin-$1$ Weyl semimetal. In the presence of disorder, this equivalence leads to a range of phenomena explored in this paper. These include topological protection against localization when helicity hybridization is weak, the emergence of exotic phases in weakly scattering media, and anomalies in optical transparency in the presence of synthetic `magnetic fields'. We argue that some of these effects should be visible and investigated already in weakly disordered optical materials.

Title: Interplay between aging and rejuvenation in spin glasses
Authors: J. Freedberg, D.L.Schlagel, R. L. Orbach, E. Dan Dahlberg
Abstract: Aging in a single crystal spin glass ($\mathrm{Cu}_{0.92}\mathrm{Mn}_{0.08}$) has been measured using ac susceptibility techniques over a temperature range of $0.3 - 0.8 \, T_g$. In these studies, traditional aging experiments (or ``quench'' aging protocols) are compared to aging curves constructed from finite-cooling-rate curves. By comparing the growth rates of spin glass order between the two types of aging curves, it is determined that quantitative comparisons between protocols which are taken by quenching and protocols using a finite cooling rate are not possible without a deeper understanding of the interplay between aging and rejuvenation. We then demonstrate that the data presented indicate that rejuvenation, rather than cumulative aging, is the cause for the discrepancies between the two growth rates.

Title: Proper Definition of Intrinsic Nonlinear Current
Authors: Cong Xiao, Jin Cao, Qian Niu, Shengyuan A. Yang
Abstract: We show that the three commonly employed approaches that define the same dc (or low-frequency) intrinsic linear anomalous Hall response actually lead to different results for intrinsic nonlinear transport. The difference is due to an intrinsic anomalous distribution (IAD). It originates from a nonlinear field effect during scattering, but its value is completely independent of scattering, because it represents the local equilibration of electron wave packets with field corrected energy. The proper definition of intrinsic current that is detectable in experiment must incorporate the effect of IAD. We also show that IAD is indispensable for consistency with fundamental physical relations. In addition, we predict that under ac driving, the intrinsic reponses in rectified and double-frequency channels exhibit distinct frequency dependence, for which we estimate the signals that can be probed in antiferromagnetic CuMnAs.

Title: Destabilisation of local magnetic anisotropy in heavy-fermion compounds
Authors: Ewan Scott, Michal Kwasigroch
Abstract: The local magnetic anisotropy of a typical crystalline compound is usually attributed to the combined effect of crystal electric fields and spin-orbit coupling. We show that this simple local picture is transformed in heavy-fermion compounds by the development of coherent electron scattering from local spin degrees of freedom. Provided the dominance of the coherence energy scale over the magnetic energy scale is strong enough, the fractionalisation and delocalisation of the spins destabilises their single-ion anisotropy by generating an opposing anisotropy in the exchange. Experimentally, this can manifest as competing splittings in the Curie-Weiss constants and effective moments. We show that in the presence of orthorhombic or tetragonal symmetry the destabilisation of the anisotropy can result in either ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic order that is perpendicular to the high-temperature easy axis. In the absence of destabilisation, we show that the order is more likely to be antiferromagnetic. In agreement with our theory, we also observe that the temperature at which the anisotropy of the uniform magnetic response changes tracks the coherence energy scale in a wide range of actinide and lanthanide compounds.

Title: Fundamental limits on the electron-phonon coupling and superconducting $T_c$
Authors: Dmitrii V. Semenok, Boris L. Altshuler, Emil A. Yuzbashyan
Abstract: Fundamental upper bounds on the electron-phonon interaction strength and superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ in metals are established based on the intrinsic instability of the equilibrium between electrons and the crystal lattice under strong interaction. This instability explains why observed electron-phonon coupling constants are limited to $\lambda \lesssim 4$. The theory also accounts for the mechanism of metastable superconductivity with enhanced $T_c$, which emerges near the instability threshold. Based on theoretical analysis and comparison with experimental data, room-temperature phonon-mediated superconductivity is found to be feasible exclusively in hydrogen compounds.

Title: Magnetic-field-tunable anisotropic blackbody radiation and condensation of slow thermal light in dynamical axion insulators
Authors: Eric Kochems, Gretel Quintero Angulo, Reinhold Egger, Carsten Müller, Selym Villalba-Chávez
Abstract: Thermal radiation features of dynamical axion insulators, which are characterized by an antiferromagnetic order with simultaneously broken time-reversal and space-inversion symmetries, are investigated. Planck's radiation law is shown to exhibit remarkable anisotropic behavior as a result of the strong dispersion caused by the light-matter interaction. A crossover scenario at low temperature is identified and an associated phase highly populated by slow thermal photons is revealed. We show that the asymmetry degree of the heat radiation and its angular distribution can be controlled via a magnetic field, paving the way toward a directional-tunable mechanism for thermal quantum manipulation and storage. Analogies are drawn with the expected behavior of blackbody radiation in the core of neutron stars.

Title: Antiferroelectric Hafnia Down to the 2D Limit

Abstract: Antiferroelectricity is a material property characterized by alternating electric dipoles spontaneously ordered in antiparallel directions. Antiferroelectrics are promising for energy storage, solid-state cooling, and memory technologies; however, these materials are scarce, and their scalability remains largely unexplored. In this work, we demonstrate that single-crystalline hafnia, a lead-free CMOS-compatible material, exhibits antiferroelectricity under compressive-strain conditions. We observe antiparallel sublattice polarization and stable double-hysteresis in single-crystalline (111)-oriented epitaxial La-doped hafnia films grown on yttrium-stabilized zirconia and show that the antipolar orthorhombic phase of hafnia adheres to the Kittel model of antiferroelectricity. Notably, compressive strain strengthens the antiferroelectric order in thinner La-doped hafnia films, achieving an unprecedented 850 C ordering temperature in the two-dimensional limit, highlighting hafnia's potential for advanced antiferroelectric devices.

Title: Multifractal critical phase driven by coupling quasiperiodic systems to electromagnetic cavities
Authors: Thales F. Macedo, Julián Faúndez, Raimundo R. dos Santos, Natanael C. Costa, Felipe A. Pinheiro
Abstract: We theoretically investigate criticality and multifractal states in a one-dimensional Aubry-Andre-Harper model coupled to electromagnetic cavities. We focus on two specific cases where the phonon frequencies are $\omega_{0}=1$ and $\omega_{0}=2$, respectively. Phase transitions are analyzed using both the average and minimum inverse participation ratio to identify metallic, fractal, and insulating states. We provide numerical evidence to show that the presence of the optical cavity induces a critical, intermediate phase in between the extended and localized phases, hence drastically modifying the traditional transport phase diagram of the Aubry-Andre-Harper model, in which critical states can only exist at the well-defined metal-insulator critical point. We also investigate the probability distribution of the inverse participation ratio and conduct a multifractal analysis to characterize the nature of the critical phase, in which we show that extended, localized, and fractal eigenstates coexist. Altogether, our findings reveal the pivotal role that the coupling to electromagnetic cavities plays in tailoring critical transport phenomena at the microscopic level of the eigenstates.

Title: Magnon-mediated current drag and nonlocal spin-Peltier effect in the ac regime
Authors: Oliver Franke, Duje Akrap, Piet W. Brouwer
Abstract: Electron-magnon coupling at the interface between a normal metal and a magnetically ordered insulator modifies the electrical conductivity of the normal metal, an effect known as spin-Hall magnetoresistance. It can also facilitate magnon-mediated current drag, the nonlocal electric current response of two normal metal layers separated by a magnetic insulator. Additionally, spin and heat transport are coupled both in the magnetic insulator and across the interfaces to normal metals. In this article, we present a theory of these spintronic and spin-caloritronic effects for time-dependent applied electric fields $E(\omega)$, with driving frequencies $\omega$ up to the THz regime. Our model describes how the dominant transport mechanism, coherent or incoherent magnons, evolves with the driving frequency $\omega$.

Title: Slow and fast topological dynamical phase transitions in a Duffing resonator driven by two detuned tones
Authors: Letizia Catalini, Javier del Pino, Soumya S. Kumar, Vincent Dumont, Gabriel Margiani, Oded Zilberberg, Alexander Eichler
Abstract: The combination of a strong pump and a weak probe has been widely applied to investigate both optical and nanomechanical devices. Such pump-probe measurements allows for the exploration of nonlinear dynamics, driven by the large pump tone, by measuring the system response to a probe tone. In contrast, here we report on the dynamics of a mechanical Duffing resonator driven with a combination of two large tones at different frequencies. Our results indicate the presence of various distinct regimes with very different dynamics. We systematically investigate the impact of the relative strength and detuning between the two drives on the dynamical response. This provides an illustrative example of dynamical phase transitions in out-of-equilibrium systems.

Title: Solvent-induced ion clusters generate long-ranged double-layer forces at high ionic strengths
Authors: David Ribar, Clifford E. Woodward, Jan Forsman
Abstract: Recent experimental results by the Surface Force Apparatus (SFA) have identified a dramatic deviation from previously established theories of simple electrolytes. This deviation, referred to as anomalous underscreening, suggests that the range of electrostatic interactions increase upon a further addition of salt, beyond some threshold concentration (usually about 1M). In this theoretical work, we explore an extension of the Restricted Primitive Model (RPM) wherein a short-ranged pair potential of mean force (sPMF) is added to the usual Coulombic interactions so as to mimic changes of the hydration as two ions approach one another. The strength of this potential is adjusted so that the modified RPM saturates at a realistic concentration level (within a range 4-7M, typical to aqueous 1:1 salts). We utilise grand canonical simulations to establish surface forces predicted by the model and compare them directly with SFA data. We explore different sPMF models, which in all cases display significant clustering at concentrations above about 1M. In these models, we find significant double-layer repulsion at separations that significantly exceed those expected from standard RPM predictions. We do not, however, observe an increase of the screening length with salt concentration, but rather that this screening length seemingly saturates at a (rather high) value. The simulated long-ranged interactions are shown to correlate with ion cluster formation, implicating the important role of accompanying {\em cluster-cluster} interactions. In particular, steric interactions between clusters (manifested in density-density correlations) are quite relevant in these systems.

Title: Anomalous and Topological Hall Effects with Phase-Space Berry Curvatures: Electric, Thermal, and Thermoelectric Transport in Magnets
Authors: Zachariah Addison, Lauren Keyes, Mohit Randeria
Abstract: We develop a theory for the electrical and thermal transverse linear response functions such as the Hall, Nernst and thermal Hall effects in magnetic materials that harbor topological spin textures like skyrmions. In addition to the ordinary transverse response that arises from the Lorentz force due to the external magnetic field, there is an anomalous and a topological response. The intrinsic anomalous response derives from the momentum space Berry curvature arising from the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in a system with a nonzero magnetization, while the topological response arises from real space Berry curvature related to the the topological charge density of the spin texture. To take into account all these effects on an equal footing, we develop a semiclassical theory that incorporates all phase-space Berry curvatures. We show within a controlled, semiclassical approach that all conductivities -- electrical, thermoelectric, and thermal Hall -- can be written as the sum of three contributions: ordinary, anomalous and topological, when the conduction electron SOC is weaker than the exchange coupling to the spin texture. All other contributions, including those arising from mixed real-momentum space Berry curvature, are negligible in the regime where our calculations are controlled. We derive various general relations that remain valid at low temperatures including the Weidemann-Franz relation between the electrical and thermal conductivities and the Mott relation between the thermoelectric and electrical conductivities. We also discuss how an in-plane Hall response arises in three-dimensional materials with sufficiently low symmetry. Finally, the Hall response is qualitatively different when the conduction electron SOC is stronger than the exchange coupling to the spin texture, where we find that the anomalous term dominates and the topological term vanishes.

Title: Enhanced metrology based on flipping trajectory of cold Rydberg gases
Authors: Ya-Jun Wang, Jun Zhang, Zheng-Yuan Zhang, Shi-Yao Shao, Qing Li, Han-Chao Chen, Yu Ma, Tian-Yu Han, Qi-Feng Wang, Jia-Dou Nan, Yi-Ming Yin, Dong-Yang Zhu, Qiao-Qiao Fang, Chao Yu, Xin Liu, Guang-Can Guo, Bang Liu, Li-Hua Zhang, Dong-Sheng Ding, Bao-Sen Shi
Abstract: The dynamical trajectory of a dissipative Rydberg many-body system could be flipped under a microwave field driving, displaying an enhanced sensitivity. This is because the intersection of the folded hysteresis trajectories exhibits a sharp peak near the phase transition, amplifying the response to small changes in the microwave field. Here, we demonstrate an experiment of enhanced metrology through flipping the hysteresis trajectory in a cold atomic system, displaying an approach to improve sensitivity near the gap-closing points. By measuring the intersection points of hysteresis trajectories versus Rabi frequency of the microwave field, we quantify the equivalent sensitivity to be 1.6(5) nV cm-1 Hz-1/2. The measurement is also dependent on the interaction time, optical depth and principal quantum number since the long-range interaction between Rydberg atoms could dramatically change the shape of hysteresis trajectories. The reported results suggest that flipping trajectory features in cold Rydberg many-body systems could advance sensing and metrology applications.

Title: Universal Linear Response of First-Passage Kinetics: A Framework for Prediction and Inference
Authors: Tommer D. Keidar, Shlomi Reuveni
Abstract: First-passage processes are pervasive across numerous scientific fields, yet a general framework for understanding their response to external perturbations remains elusive. While the fluctuation-dissipation theorem offers a complete linear response theory for systems in steady-state, it fails to apply to transient first-passage processes. We address this challenge by focusing on rare - rather than weak - perturbations. Surprisingly, we discover that the linear response of the mean first-passage time (MFPT) to such perturbations is universal. It depends solely on the first two moments of the unperturbed first-passage time and the mean completion time following perturbation activation, without any assumptions about the underlying system's dynamics. To demonstrate the utility of our findings, we analyze the MFPT response of drift-diffusion processes in two scenarios: (i) stochastic resetting with information feedback, and (ii) an abrupt transition from a linear to a logarithmic potential. In both cases, our approach bypasses the need for explicit determination of the perturbed dynamics, unraveling a highly non-trivial response landscape with minimal effort. Finally, we show how our framework enables a new type of experiment - inferring molecular-level fluctuations from bulk measurements, a feat previously believed to be impossible. Overall, the newly discovered universality reported herein offers a powerful tool for predicting the impact of perturbations on kinetic processes - and, remarkably, for extracting hidden single-molecule fluctuations from accessible bulk measurements.

Title: More on the Operator Space Entanglement (OSE): Rényi OSE, revivals, and integrability breaking
Authors: Vincenzo Alba
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of the Rényi Operator Space Entanglement ($OSE$) entropies $S_n$ across several one-dimensional integrable and chaotic models. As a paradigmatic integrable system, we first consider the so-called rule $54$ chain. Our numerical results reveal that the Rényi $OSE$ entropies of diagonal operators with nonzero trace saturate at long times, in contrast with the behavior of von Neumann entropy. Oppositely, the Rényi entropies of traceless operators exhibit logarithmic growth with time, with the prefactor of this growth depending in a nontrivial manner on $n$. Notably, at long times, the complete operator entanglement spectrum ($ES$) of an operator can be reconstructed from the spectrum of its traceless part. We observe a similar pattern in the $XXZ$ chain, suggesting universal behavior. Additionally, we consider dynamics in nonintegrable deformations of the $XXZ$ chain. Finite-time corrections do not allow to access the long-time behavior of the von Neumann entropy. On the other hand, for $n>1$ the growth of the entropies is milder, and it is compatible with a sublinear growth, at least for operators associated with global conserved quantities. Finally, we show that in finite-size integrable systems, $S_n$ exhibit strong revivals, which are washed out when integrability is broken.

Title: Two-spinon effects on the thermal Tonks-Girardeau gas
Authors: Felipe Taha Sant'Ana, Hui Liu
Abstract: We study the effects of the two-spinon excitations on the field-field correlator of the Tonks-Girardeau gas. While these excitations have been previously examined in the ground state of the system, their role at finite temperatures remains unexplored. Here, we extend the analysis to the one-dimensional interacting Bose gas at thermal equilibrium, focusing on the one-body correlation function of the infinitely repulsive Lieb-Liniger model. We demonstrate that two-spinon excitations, characterized by two holes within the rapidity distribution, constitute the dominant contribution to the field-field correlator at low temperatures. Furthermore, we analytically show that incorporating additional particle-hole excitations diminishes their contribution, highlighting the efficacy of the two-spinon framework in capturing the essential physics of the system. Numerical evaluations of both the Fredholm determinant and the spectral sum stemming from the two-spinon program, with the addition of particle-hole excitations, reveal convergence at low temperatures.

Title: Spin amplitude wave due to dipole-quadrupole hybridization in spin-1 pyrochlore magnets
Authors: Hiroki Nakai, Chisa Hotta
Abstract: We explore the quantum pseudospin-1 pyrochlore magnet featuring Fe$^{2+}$-based spinel oxides that addresses the formation of amplitude-modulated spin-density waves. We propose that the relatively small spin-orbit coupling and the small extra crystal field splitting in these materials create anisotropic exchange interactions and strong single-ion anisotropy, respectively, whose interplay becomes the source of quadrupolar moments selectively appearing on certain sublattices, leading to a spatially modulated hybrid of dipolar and quadrupolar moments. This mechanism represents the possibility of insulating magnets to form an exotic phase with coexisting liquid-solid properties.

Title: Berry Phase Dynamics of Sliding Electron Crystals
Authors: Yongxin Zeng, Andrew J. Millis
Abstract: Systems such as Wigner crystals and incommensurate charge density waves that spontaneously break a continuous translation symmetry have unusual transport properties arising from their ability to slide coherently in space. Recent experimental and theoretical studies suggest that spontaneous translation symmetry breaking in some two-dimensional materials with nontrivial quantum geometry (e.g., rhombohedral pentalayer graphene) leads to a topologically nontrivial electron crystal state called the anomalous Hall crystal and characterized by a vanishing linear-response dc longitudinal conductivity and a non-vanishing Hall conductivity. In this work we present a theoretical investigation of the sliding dynamics of this new type of electron crystal, taking into account the system's nontrivial quantum geometry. We find that when accelerated by an external electric field, the crystal acquires a transverse anomalous velocity that stems from not only the Berry curvature of the parent band but also the Galilean non-invariance of the crystal state (i.e., crystal states with different momenta are not related by simple momentum boosts). We further show that acceleration of the crystal modifies its internal current from the static crystal value that is determined by the Chern number of the crystal state. The net Hall conductance including contributions from center-of-mass motion and internal current is in general not quantized. As an experimentally relevant example, we present numerical results in rhombohedral pentalayer graphene and discuss possible experimental implications.

Title: Flat bands on spherical surface: from Landau levels to giant-quantum-number orbitals
Authors: Chen-Xin Jiang, Zi-Xiang Hu, Bo Yang
Abstract: Flat bands result in a divergent density of states and high sensitivity to interactions in physical systems. While such bands are well known in systems under magnetic fields, their realization and behavior in zero-field settings remain largely unexplored. Here we compare the behavior of electrons confined to a single flat band on the surface of a sphere to those in flat bands under a magnetic field. The zero-field flat band exhibits an additional C(2) symmetry, which causes electrons to symmetrically cluster on opposite sides of the sphere's center when a trapping potential is introduced, resulting in a unique form of long-range "entanglement". To explore these findings experimentally, we propose a feasible setup to explore the unique properties of zero-field flat bands on spherical substrates, offering a promising route for studying interaction-driven states in spherical geometry without external fields.

Title: Rainbow chains and numerical renormalisation group for accurate chiral conformal spectra
Authors: Attila Szabó
Abstract: Based on the relationship between reduced and thermal density matrices in conformal field theory (CFT), we show that the entanglement spectrum of a conformal critical chain with exponentially decaying terms consists of conformal towers of the associated chiral CFT, with only weak finite-size effects. Through free-fermion and interacting examples, we show that these entanglement spectra present a reliable method to extract detailed CFT spectra from single wave functions without access to the parent Hamiltonian. We complement our method with a Wilsonian numerical renormalisation group algorithm for solving interacting, exponentially decaying chain Hamiltonians.

Title: Fermi Velocity Dependent Critical Current in Ballistic Bilayer Graphene Josephson Junctions
Authors: Amis Sharma, Chun-Chia Chen, Jordan McCourt, Mingi Kim, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Leonid Rokhinson, Gleb Finkelstein, Ivan Borzenets
Abstract: We perform transport measurements on proximitized, ballistic, bilayer graphene Josephson junctions (BGJJs) in the intermediate-to-long junction regime ($L>\xi$). We measure the device's differential resistance as a function of bias current and gate voltage for a range of different temperatures. The extracted critical current $I_{C}$ follows an exponential trend with temperature: $ \exp(-k_{B} T/ \delta E)$. Here $\delta E = \hbar \nu_F /2\pi L $: an expected trend for intermediate-to-long junctions. From $\delta E$, we determine the Fermi velocity of the bilayer graphene, which is found to increase with gate voltage. Simultaneously, we show the carrier density dependence of $\delta E$, which is attributed to the quadratic dispersion of bilayer graphene. This is in contrast to single layer graphene Josephson junctions, where $\delta E$ and the Fermi velocity are independent of the carrier density. The carrier density dependence in BGJJs allows for additional tuning parameters in graphene-based Josephson Junction devices.

Title: Tunable Coupling, Topology, and Chirality by Antimagnons in Magnetic Multilayer
Authors: Yifan Liu, Zehan Chen, Qiming Shao
Abstract: Realizing novel topological states in magnonic systems unlocks robust, low-power spin-wave devices. In this letter, we show that incorporating left-handed spin waves (antimagnons) fundamentally reorganizes band topology, and enables tunable spin-wave coupling and chirality. We proposed a two-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger like model, the 2D-SSH4 chain, where dipolar interactions between magnons and antimagnons generate topological bands with nonzero Chern numbers. This framework explains the origin of topological surface states in ferromagnetic multilayer and shows they share the same topological origin as classic magnetostatic surface spin waves. Our model also offers a straightforward framework for designing more complex magnetic multilayer connected by dipolar interactions, such as antiferromagnetic/ferromagnetic multilayer. In these dipolar-coupled multilayers, both coherent and dissipative interlayer spin-wave couplings together with the layer resolved chirality, are tunable via external magnetic fields and spin torques. Our results provide a practical platform for topological magnonics, enabling control of magnon chirality and coupling in future devices.

Title: Hydrodynamics of Cooperation and Self-Interest in a Two-Population Occupation Model

Abstract: We study the hydrodynamics of a system of agents who optimize either their individual utility (self-interest) or the collective welfare (cooperation). When agents act selfishly, their interactions are non-reciprocal, driving the system out of equilibrium; by contrast, purely altruistic dynamics restore reciprocity and yield an equilibrium-like description. We investigate how mixtures of these two behaviors shape the macroscopic properties of the liquid of agents. For highly rational agents, we find that introducing a small fraction of altruists can suppress the sub-optimal clustering induced by selfish dynamics. This phenomenon can be attributed to altruists localizing at interfaces and acting as effective surfactants, shedding a new light on earlier findings in fixed neighborhood-based models [Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{120}, 208301 (2018)]. When agents are boundedly rational, we introduce a well-mixed approximation that reduces the two-population model to a single effective scalar field theory. This allows us to leverage state-of-the-art tools from active matter to analytically characterize how altruism modifies surface tension and nucleation dynamics.

Title: Anomalous frequency scaling of acoustic phonon damping in nickel cavities fabricated by ps-laser delamination

Abstract: Single-shot picosecond (ps) laser induced delamination allows for the direct generation of suspended membranes from a continuous metallic film, offering a promising platform for control of ultrafast magnetization dynamics driven by acoustic waves. Using the picosecond-ultrasonics method, we demonstrate that long-lived low-frequency acoustic waves can be optically-excited in the delaminated cavities. At the same time, higher-frequency modes >60GHz exhibit a surprisingly fast damping, following a scaling law incompatible with the expected attenuation mediated by phonon-phonon scattering. Comparing measurements between delaminated cavities and a benchmark nickel film in contact with the substrate, we link our findings with structural modifications of the nickel crystal induced by the delamination process.

Title: Crystalline superconductor-semiconductor Josephson junctions for compact superconducting qubits
Authors: Jesse Balgley, Jinho Park, Xuanjing Chu, Ethan G. Arnault, Martin V. Gustafsson, Leonardo Ranzani, Madisen Holbrook, Yangchen He, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Daniel Rhodes, Vasili Perebeinos, James Hone, Kin Chung Fong
Abstract: The narrow bandgap of semiconductors allows for thick, uniform Josephson junction barriers, potentially enabling reproducible, stable, and compact superconducting qubits. We study vertically stacked van der Waals Josephson junctions with semiconducting weak links, whose crystalline structures and clean interfaces offer a promising platform for quantum devices. We observe robust Josephson coupling across 2--12 nm (3--18 atomic layers) of semiconducting WSe$_2$ and, notably, a crossover from proximity- to tunneling-type behavior with increasing weak link thickness. Building on these results, we fabricate a prototype all-crystalline merged-element transmon qubit with transmon frequency and anharmonicity closely matching design parameters. We demonstrate dispersive coupling between this transmon and a microwave resonator, highlighting the potential of crystalline superconductor-semiconductor structures for compact, tailored superconducting quantum devices.

Title: Quantum Phase Transitions between Symmetry-Enriched Fracton Phases
Authors: Julian Boesl, Yu-Jie Liu, Wen-Tao Xu, Frank Pollmann, Michael Knap
Abstract: Topologically ordered phases exhibit further complexity in the presence of global symmetries: Their anyonic excitations may exhibit different transformation patterns under these symmetries, leading to a classification in terms of symmetry-enriched topological orders. We develop a generic scheme to study an analogous situation for three-dimensional fracton phases by means of isometric tensor network states (isoTNS) with finite bond dimension, which allow us to tune phase transitions between different symmetry fractionalization patterns. We focus on the X-Cube model, a paradigmatic fracton model hosting two types of excitations: lineons, which are mobile in a single direction only, and fractons that are immobile on their own. By deforming the local tensors of the fixed point ground state, we find a family of exact wavefunctions for which the symmetry fractionalization under an anti-unitary symmetry on both types of excitations is directly visible. These wavefunctions are non-stabilizer states and have non-vanishing correlation lengths. They even exhibit power-law correlations at criticality between two symmetry-enriched topological orders. Furthermore, the isoTNS description allows for the explicit construction of a linear-depth quantum circuit to sequentially realize these exotic 3D states on a quantum processor, including a holographic scheme using only a pair of two-dimensional qubit arrays alongside measurements. Our approach provides a construction to enrich phases with exotic topological or fracton order and to study 3D quantum phase transition with exact wavefunctions, and offers a tractable route to implement and characterize fracton order on quantum devices.

Title: Learning Continuum-level Closures For Control of Interacting Active Particles
Authors: Titus Quah, Sho C. Takatori, James B. Rawlings
Abstract: Active matter swarms -- collectives of self-propelled particles that could self-assemble, ferry microscopic cargo, or endow materials with dynamic properties -- remain hard to steer. In crowded systems, tracking or controlling individual agents becomes challenging, so strategies should operate on macroscopic fields like particle density. Yet predicting how density evolves is difficult due to inter-agent interactions. For model-based feedback control methods -- like Model Predictive Control (MPC) -- fast, accurate, and differentiable models are crucial. Detailed agent-based simulations are too slow, necessitating coarse-grained continuum models. However, constructing accurate closures -- approximations expressing the effect of unresolved microscopic states (e.g., agent positions) on continuum dynamics -- is challenging for active matter swarms. We present a learning-for-control framework that learns continuum closures from agent simulations, demonstrated with active Brownian particles under a controllable external field. Our Universal Differential Equation (UDE) framework represents the continuum as an advection-diffusion equation. A neural operator learns the advection term, providing closure relations for microscopic effects like self-propulsion, interactions, and external field responses. This UDE approach, embedding universal function approximators in differential equations, ensures adherence to physical laws (e.g., conservation) while learning complex dynamics directly from data. We embed this learned continuum model into MPC for precise agent simulation control. We demonstrate this framework's capabilities by dynamically exchanging particle densities between two groups, and simultaneously controlling particle density and mean flux to follow a prescribed sinusoidal profile. These results highlight the framework's potential to control complex active matter dynamics.

Title: Quantum kinetic theory of the semiclassical side jump, skew scattering and longitudinal velocity
Authors: Da Ma, Zhi-Fan Zhang, Hua Jiang, X. C. Xie
Abstract: The semiclassical Boltzmann equation is widely used to study transport effects. However, being semiclassical and borrowing heavily from classical mechanics, the formalism calls for verification from the perspective of quantum mechanics. Although previous works discussed the relation between the quantum density matrix and the semiclassical formalism, direct comparison, especially of disorder effects, including side jumps and skew scattering in the two approaches, has not been fully conducted. In this work, we systematically and directly compare the semiclassical Boltzmann equation and its counterpart arising from the density matrix. We find that there is an additional correction to the side-jump velocity, the longitudinal velocity, which is longitudinal in the leading order, and its resultant current does not require time-reversal symmetry breaking. Moreover, we find the semiclassical side-jump collision integral is an approximation of the quantum result at moderate temperatures, and it also contains a correction induced by the longitudinal velocity. We also show that the scattering rate obtained from the density matrix agrees with the semiclassical results. Our work illuminates the quantum roots of the semiclassical Boltzmann equation.

Title: Superconducting phenomena in systems with unconventional magnets
Authors: Yuri Fukaya, Bo Lu, Keiji Yada, Yukio Tanaka, Jorge Cayao
Abstract: In this work we review the recent advances on superconducting phenomena in junctions formed by superconductors and unconventional magnets. Conventional magnets, such as ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, are characterized by broken time-reversal symmetry but only ferromagnets produce a finite net magnetization due to parallel spin alignment and spin-split bands in momentum. Very recently, a new type of magnets has been reported and here we refer to them as unconventional magnets because they exhibit special properties of both ferromagnets and antiferromagnets: they exhibit zero net magnetization (like antiferromagnets) and a nonrelativistic spin splitting of energy bands (like ferromagnets), both leading to anisotropic spin-polarized Fermi surfaces. An interesting property of unconventional magnets is that their magnetic order can be even or odd with respect to momentum, where $d$-wave altermagnets and $p$-wave magnets are the most representative examples. In this regard, $d$-wave altermagnets and $p$-wave magnets are seen as counterparts in magnetism of the unconventional $d$- and $p$-wave superconducting states, respectively. While the impact of conventional magnetism on superconductivity has been largely studied, the combination of unconventional magnets and superconductivity has only lately attracted considerably attention. This work provides a comprehensive review of the recent progress on the interplay between superconductivity and unconventional magnets. In particular, we focus on the fundamental emerging superconducting phenomena and also discuss the potential implications towards quantum applications.

Title: From Champagne to Confined Polymer:Natural and Artificial Bubble Nucleation
Authors: Carlos Arauz-Moreno, Keyvan Piroird, Elise Lorenceau
Abstract: In this study, we present an experimental work on bubble nucleation and growth using a model system comprised of viscoelastic polyvinyl butyral confined in a Hele-Shaw cell geometry that is decompressed at elevated temperatures. The appearance and growth of bubbles are connected to the temperature-induced shift in chemical equilibrium experienced simultaneously by two gases present in the bulk. The latter becomes simultaneously oversaturated with water vapor and slightly undersaturated in air. Our bubbles grow with various shapes and sizes depending on the initial morphology of the nucleus or the presence of neighboring bubbles. For large nuclei, bubbles grow anisotropically because of contact line pinning. The likelihood of nucleation is related to the amount of water dissolved in the bulk and the imposed temperature. Counter-intuitively, the number of nuclei whence a bubble can grow is inversely correlated with said temperature. In an analogy with champagne, we show that nucleation can either be natural, at trapped fibers or dust particles, or artificial, at crenels we purposefully made in the glass surface. Our results indicate that the growth rate of bubbles can be impacted by the nucleation mechanism.

Title: Gate-voltage-driven quantum phase transition at $0.7 (2e^2/h)$ in quantum point contacts
Authors: Jongbae Hong
Abstract: We investigate a quantum phase transition (QPT) in quantum point contacts by analyzing the gate-voltage-dependent quasiparticle energy at the Fermi level at zero temperature. This energy is computed using the local density of states at the site of the localized spin, which is extracted from the replicated gate-voltage-dependent differential conductance shaped by entangled-state tunneling. The QPT occurs between symmetric ($G \geq 0.7 G_0$) and asymmetric ($G < 0.7 G_0$) Kondo coupling states, where $G_0 = 2e^2/h$, and is driven by the migration of a localized spin in response to the side-gate voltage. The asymmetric state exhibits two distinct Kondo temperatures, while the symmetric state has only one. The existence of two Kondo temperatures in the $G < 0.7 G_0$ regime accounts for both the anomalous gate-voltage dependence of the zero-bias anomaly width and the inability to define a Kondo temperature in the $G < 0.7 G_0$ region.

Title: Uniaxial spin texture in a superconducting electron gas revealed by exchange interactions
Authors: Junyi Yang, Changjiang Liu, Xianjing Zhou, Hanyu Hou, Kaijun Yin, Jianguo Wen, John Pearson, Alexey Suslov, Dafei Jin, Jidong S. Jiang, Ulrich Welp, Jian-Min Zuo, Michael R. Norman, Anand Bhattacharya
Abstract: Two-dimensional superconductors with spin-textured Fermi surfaces can be a platform for realizing unconventional pairing states and are of substantial interest in the context of quantum information science, and superconducting spintronics/orbitronics. We observed an unusual in-plane uniaxial anisotropy in the superconducting 2D electron gas (2DEG) formed at EuOx/KTaO3 (110) interfaces, where the EuOx is magnetic. This anisotropy is not evident in AlOx/KTaO3 (110) where the overlayer is non-magnetic. Our results are consistent with a highly anisotropic 'half-Rashba' spin-textured Fermi surface in 2DEGs formed at the KTaO3 (110) interface that is hidden from external magnetic fields due to a near cancellation between orbital and spin moments but revealed by exchange interactions of the electrons in the 2DEG with Eu moments near the EuOx/KTaO3 (110) interface. The interactions between the uniaxial spin texture and the magnetic overlayer offer new ways to explore the interplay between magnetism and 2D superconductivity.

Title: Angular Dependence of Specific Heat and Magnetization Effects in the Kitaev Model
Authors: Takao Morinari, Hibiki Takegami
Abstract: We investigate the effect of a magnetic field on the Kitaev model using the equation of motion approach for the spin Green's function, considering both the case of suppressed magnetization ($m = 0$) and finite magnetization ($m \neq 0$). When magnetization is suppressed, the specific heat exhibits a clear $60^\circ$ periodicity in its angular dependence, with the locations of maxima and minima consistent with recent experimental observations in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. A qualitative difference in their temperature dependence is observed: the minima show gap-like behavior that may signal Majorana gap formation due to time-reversal symmetry breaking, while the maxima do not exhibit the expected gapless Majorana fermion signature. In addition, a linear-in-field effect -- distinct from magnetization -- emerges, with the characteristic temperature below which angular dependence appears increasing linearly with the magnetic field. Importantly, this directional dependence becomes quantitatively significant only at very low temperatures. When finite magnetization is included, the angular dependence of the specific heat remains, and the qualitative behavior is similar to the $m = 0$ case: the minima continue to exhibit gap-like features, while the maxima do not show signatures of gapless Majorana fermions. These results suggest that suppressing magnetization alone is insufficient to realize quantum spin liquid behavior in the Kitaev model under a magnetic field.

Title: Towards Identifying the PL6 Center in SiC: From First-Principles Screening to Hyperfine Validation of Competing Defect Candidates
Authors: Xin Zhao, Mingzhe Liu, Yu Chen, Qi Zhang, Chang-Kui Duan
Abstract: The PL6 color center in 4H-SiC, known for its excellent ambient-temperature spin and optical properties, has an unresolved microscopic origin. In this first-principles study, we systematically investigate potential structures to clarify its nature. We first rigorously examine the DV-antisite hypothesis (a divacancy paired with a carbon antisite, $\mathrm{C_{Si}}$), analyzing the energetic, electronic, and spin properties of various $V_\mathrm{Si}V_\mathrm{C}+\mathrm{C_{Si}}$ configurations. Two $\mathrm{C_{3v}}$-symmetric $\mathrm{kk+C_{Si}}$ complexes emerge as strong candidates within this framework. Subsequently, a critical comparison of hyperfine interaction signatures is performed between these candidates, the alternative OV model [specifically OV(hh) and OV(kk), an oxygen replacing C together with a Si vacancy], and experimental data. This analysis demonstrates that the OV(hh) structure more accurately reproduces PL6's hyperfine features. Furthermore, re-evaluation of the proposed OV(hk) model for the related PL5 center reveals zero-field splitting parameter $E$ inconsistencies with experimental results, suggesting that PL5 and PL6 may have distinct origins. These findings provide crucial theoretical insights and motivate targeted experimental validation for these quantum defects.

Title: Using Thermodynamics and Microstructure to Mitigate Overfitting in Pellet Reduction Models
Authors: Ömer K. Büyükuslu, Fabrice Yang, Dierk Raabe, Moritz to Baben, Anna L. Ravensburg
Abstract: Direct reduction of iron using hydrogen-rich gas is rapidly emerging as a key strategy for green steel production. This process involves complex, multiscale phenomena, encompassing solid-state phase transformations and gas transport through pores, that must be accurately represented for predictive industrial implementation. Here, we present a thermodynamically sound pellet-scale model that describes these mechanisms and can serve as a foundation for improving the understanding of pellet reduction kinetics in H$_2$/CO-containing atmospheres. The model assumes that the gas phase remains in thermodynamic equilibrium, meaning that the composition of the gas instantaneously adjusts to any changes in the system. This reduces the number of fitting parameters drastically compared to other existing models, while maintaining a strict thermodynamic upper bound estimate. A driving force term is included in the reaction rate equation based on the partial pressure of O$_2$ in the equilibrated gas phase. This constrained equilibrium-based approach ensures that the three iron oxide reduction steps and the formation of graphite and cementite in carbon-containing gases occur only if they are thermodynamically possible. It is demonstrated that fitting kinetic parameters based on conversion degree data alone leads to overfitting. This is true both for existing models and the model introduced here, despite the fact that the latter contains fewer parameters. To overcome this overfitting problem, spatially resolved microstructural data at key reduction stages can be considered, as shown here for recently reported data for a pellet reduced in H$_2$ atmosphere.

Title: Bose-Einstein condensation on axially-symmetric surfaces
Authors: A. Tononi, G. E. Astrakharchik
Abstract: We investigate the phenomenon of Bose-Einstein condensation in ideal bosonic gases confined to axially-symmetric surfaces of revolution. The single-particle Schrödinger equation is formulated on a general surface and then explicitly solved in the ellipsoidal and toroidal geometries to determine the one-body energy spectrum. We discuss how the curved geometry impacts the quantum statistical properties of ideal Bose gases confined on these surfaces. Specifically, we observe that Bose-Einstein condensation is suppressed when the surface aspect ratio is increased and, correspondingly, it becomes highly elongated and acquires a one-dimensional character. We also evaluate the Bogoliubov excitation spectrum, providing insights into the collective excitations of the condensate. Our results establish the conditions to achieve quantum degeneracy in curved manifolds, thus guiding forthcoming experiments with thin shells, and set the basis for solving the few-to-many body problem in general surfaces of revolution.

Title: Valley-polarized Quantum Anomalous Hall and Topological Metal Phase in Rashba induced pseudospin-1 lattice
Authors: Puspita Parui, Bheema Lingam Chittari
Abstract: We study the topological properties of Rashba spin-orbit coupling and exchange coupling induced pseudospin-$1$ system Dice lattice under the influence of a staggered electric potential and magnetization. The band structure and topological phases of the system are investigated and compared with the pseudospin-$\frac{1}{2}$ system honeycomb lattice. Under individual influence of the staggered electric field and magnetization, the system undergoes a distinct phase transition: (i) a staggered electric potential drives the system from a quantum anomalous Hall $(C_n = 2)$ to a valley polarized quantum anomalous Hall phase $(C_n = -1)$ associated with edge modes with a flip in the chirality; while (ii) a staggered magnetization changes the system to a topological metal associated with unconventional antichiral edge bands, from a topological insulator. These results are further supported by calculations of the Chern phase diagrams, Hall conductance, zigzag, and armchair edge states. Our findings enhance the understanding of new topological phases in the 2D pseudospin-$1$ system and open up a new platform to explore the anti-chiral edge states.

Title: Plasmons in N-layer systems
Authors: Taehun Kim, E. H. Hwang, Hongki Min
Abstract: In multilayer structures, the coupling between layers gives rise to unique plasmon modes, but analytic solutions are typically available only for bilayers due to the increasing complexity as the number of layers increases. We investigate plasmons in multilayer structures, including the effects of interlayer tunneling. By introducing the Coulomb eigenvector basis for multilayer systems, which can be solved exactly using Kac-Murdock-Szegő Toeplitz matrices, we analytically derive the long-wavelength plasmon dispersions both with and without interlayer tunneling. In the $N$-layer systems, we find that, in the absence of interlayer tunneling, the out-of-phase acoustic or charge neutral plasmon modes with linear dispersions ($\omega_\alpha\propto q/\sqrt{{1-\cos{\left(\frac{\alpha-1}{N}\pi\right)}}}$ for $\alpha = 2, 3, \cdots, N$) exist, while the in-phase classical plasmon mode exhibits its conventional dispersion ($\omega_1\propto \sqrt{q}$). When interlayer tunneling is present, the out-of-phase modes develop plasmon gaps that are governed by specific interband transitions, whereas the classical mode remains unaffected. These findings have broad applicability to general coupled-layer structures.

Title: How chiral vibrations drive molecular rotation
Authors: Ivan Pasqua, Gregorio Staffieri, Michele Fabrizio
Abstract: We analyze two simple model planar molecules: an ionic molecule with D3 symmetry and a covalent molecule with D6 symmetry. Both symmetries allow the existence of chiral molecular orbitals and normal modes that are coupled to each other in a Jahn-Teller manner, invariant under U (1) symmetry with generator a pseudo angular momentum. In the ionic molecule, the chiral mode possesses an electric dipole but lacks physical angular momentum, whereas, in the covalent molecule, the situation is reversed. In spite of that, we show that in both cases the chiral modes can be excited by a circularly polarized light and are subsequently able to induce rotational motion of the entire molecule.

Title: Stability of spin dynamics for a spin-orbit coupled boson in a driven non-Hermitian double well
Authors: Zhida Luo, Yurui Yang, Jiaxi Cui, Wenjuan Li, Miaoqian Lu, Xinzhou Guan, Wenhua Hai, Yunrong Luo
Abstract: We study the stability of spin dynamics for a spin-orbit (SO) coupled boson held in a driven non-Hermitian double-well potential. Under high-frequency approximation, we analytically derive the Floquet states and complex Floquet quasienergies of the system and reveal a striking parity-dependent stability criterion: when the ratio of the Zeeman field strength to the driving frequency $\Omega/\omega$ is even, stable spin dynamics can be achieved for \emph{arbitrary} SO coupling strength. However, when $\Omega/\omega$ is odd, stability requires the SO coupling strength to be integer or half-integer values. Particularly, we find four types of stability boundary lines for non-zero bias field strength, in sharp contrast to the commonly observed stability regions. These results establish a tunable parity-governed mechanism for stabilizing spin dynamics in non-Hermitian cold atomic systems.

Title: Inverse Design of Parameter-Controlled Disclination Paths
Authors: Yehonatan Tsubery, Hillel Aharoni
Abstract: Topological defects, such as disclination lines in nematic liquid crystals, are fundamental to many physical systems and applications. In this work, we study the behavior of nematic disclinations in thin parallel-plate geometries with strong patterned planar anchoring. Building on prior models, we solve both the forward problem -- predicting disclination trajectories from given surface patterns -- and an extended inverse problem -- designing surface patterns to produce a tunable family of disclination curves under varying system parameters. We present an explicit calculation for pattern construction, analyze parameter limitations and stability constraints, and highlight experimental and technological applications.

Title: SymTFT construction of gapless exotic-foliated dual models
Authors: Fabio Apruzzi, Francesco Bedogna, Salvo Mancani
Abstract: We construct Symmetry Topological Field Theories (SymTFTs) for continuous subsystem symmetries, which are inherently non-Lorentz-invariant. Our framework produces dual bulk descriptions -- gapped foliated and exotic SymTFTs -- that generate gapless boundary theories with spontaneous subsystem symmetry breaking via interval compactification. In analogy with the sandwich construction of SymTFT, we call this Mille-feuille. This is done by specifying gapped and symmetry-breaking boundary conditions. In this way we obtain the foliated dual realizations of various models, including the XY plaquette, XYZ cube, and $\phi$, $\hat{\phi}$ theories. This also captures self-duality symmetries as condensation defects and provides a systematic method for generating free theories that non-linearly realize subsystem symmetries.

Title: Geometry of T1 transitions in epithelia
Authors: Pierre A. Haas
Abstract: The flows of tissues of epithelial cells often involve T1 transitions. These neighbour exchanges are irreversible rearrangements crossing an energy barrier. Here, by an exact geometric construction, I determine this energy barrier for general, isolated T1 transitions dominated by line tensions. I~show how deviations from regular cell packing reduce this energy barrier, but find that line tension fluctuations increase it on average. By another exact construction, I prove that the nonlinear tensions in vertex models of tissues also resist T1 transitions. My results thus form the basis for coarse-grained understanding of cell neighbour exchanges for continuum descriptions of epithelia.

Title: Soft-X-ray momentum microscopy of nonlinear magnon interactions below 100-nm wavelength
Authors: Steffen Wittrock, Christopher Klose, Salvatore Perna, Korbinian Baumgaertl, Andrea Mucchietto, Michael Schneider, Josefin Fuchs, Victor Deinhart, Tamer Karaman, Dirk Grundler, Stefan Eisebitt, Bastian Pfau, Daniel Schick
Abstract: Magnons represent quantised collective motions of long-range ordered spins. For wavelength below 100 nm, exchange interactions dominate their physics, which gives rise to a so far unexplored regime of nonlinearities and couplings between magnons and other quasiparticles. Besides their selective excitation, also the detection of such short-wavelength spin waves remains a challenge of current research and technology. Here, we probe the intensity and wave vector of magnons by means of quasi-elastic, resonant soft-X-ray scattering. This Magnon Momentum Microscopy (MMM) can access magnons directly in momentum space with remarkable sensitivity and high photon efficiency up to THz frequencies and down to few-nanometre wavelengths. The two-dimensional information obtained by this light-scattering-based technique is especially valuable for studying the nonlinear interactions of exchange-dominated magnons within technologically relevant thin-film samples. In doing so, we uncover a rich variety of deeply nonlinear magnon interactions, highlighting their potential for applications in novel computing schemes. With its intrinsic element-selectivity and ability to probe also buried layers, soft-X-ray MMM has the potential to establish itself as an advanced tool for ultrabroadband studies of short-wavelength magnonics.

Title: Expansion of one-dimensional spinor gases from power-law traps
Authors: Ovidiu I. Patu, Gianni Aupetit-Diallo
Abstract: Free expansion following the removal of axial confinement represents a fundamental nonequilibrium scenario in the study of many-body ultracold gases. Using the stationary phase approximation, we analytically demonstrate that for all one-dimensional spinor gases with repulsive contact interactions, whether bosonic or fermionic, the asymptotic density and momentum distribution can be directly determined from the quasimomentum distribution (Bethe rapidities) of the trapped gas. We efficiently obtain the quasimomentum distribution numerically by solving the integral equations that characterize the ground state of the integrable system within the local density approximation. Additionally, we derive analytical solutions for both weakly and strongly interacting regimes. Unlike in bosonic gases, where rapidity distributions and density profiles vary significantly across interaction regimes, fermionic gases maintain similar profiles in both weakly and strongly interacting limits. Notably, the gas expands self-similarly only when released from a harmonic trap. For other power-law trapping potentials, the asymptotic density profile is strongly influenced by the initial confinement geometry. Our results extend readily to Bose-Fermi mixtures and finite temperatures.

Title: Intrinsic layer polarization and multi-flatband transport in non-centrosymmetric mixed-stacked multilayer graphene
Authors: Kai Liu, Yating Sha, Bo Yin, Hongyun Zhang, Jinxi Lu, Shuhan Liu, Size Wu, Yulu Ren, Zhongxun Guo, Jingjing Gao, Ming Tian, Neng Wan, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Bingbing Tong, Guangtong Liu, Li Lu, Yuanbo Zhang, Weidong Luo, Zhiwen Shi, Shuyun Zhou, Quansheng Wu, Guorui Chen
Abstract: Graphene multilayers exhibit electronic spectra that depend sensitively on both the number of layers and their stacking order. Beyond trilayer graphene, mixed stacking sequences (alternating Bernal and rhombohedral layers) give rise to multiple coexisting low-energy bands. Here we investigate ABCBC-stacked pentalayer graphene, a less-studied non-centrosymmetric mixed sequence. This stacking can be regarded as an ABC (rhombohedral) trilayer on top of an AB (Bernal) bilayer, so its low-energy band structure contains both a cubic band and a parabolic band that hybridize. In transport measurements, we observe an intrinsic band gap at charge neutrality whose magnitude changes asymmetrically under an applied perpendicular displacement field. This behavior reflects the spontaneous layer polarization inherent to the broken inversion symmetry and mirror symmetry. By tuning the displacement field and carrier density, we drive multiple Lifshitz transitions in the Fermi surface topology and realize Landau levels with different degeneracies arising from the multi-flatband system. Remarkably, a v = -6 quantum Hall state emerges at an exceptionally low magnetic field (~20 mT), indicating the interplay between spontaneous symmetry breaking and Berry curvatures. Our results establish mixed-stacked multilayer graphene as a tunable platform with various broken symmetries and multiple flatbands, suitable for exploring emergent correlated electronic states.

Title: Thermodynamic Uncertainty Relation in Hybrid Normal-Superconducting Systems: The Role of superconducting coherence
Authors: Franco Mayo, Nahual Sobrino, Rosario Fazio, Fabio Taddei, Michele Governale
Abstract: We study the violation of thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs) in hybrid superconducting/normal metal leads coupled to a central region containing localized levels. We find violations of the TUR, also in its formulation recently derived for coherent conductors [Phys. Rev. Lett. 135, 046302 (2025)], due to the presence of macroscopic quantum coherence related to the superconducting condensate. To support our conclusion, we introduce a dephasing probe, demonstrating that the violation is directly correlated with the superconducting coherence, as measured by the pair amplitude in the central region. When the central region is a Cooper-pair splitter, crossed Andreev processes introduce nonlocal superconducting correlations that further enhance the violation. Finally, we derived a new inequality, fulfilled in hybrid superconducting - normal metal systems, in the limit in which quasi-particle tunneling can be ignored.

Title: Bath parameterization in multi-band cluster Dynamical Mean-Field Theory
Authors: Diego Florez-Ablan, Carlos Mejuto-Zaera, Massimo Capone
Abstract: Accurate and reliable algorithms to solve complex impurity problems are instrumental to a routine use of quantum embedding methods for material discovery. In this context, we employ an efficient selected configuration interaction impurity solver to investigate the role of bath discretization, specifically, bath size and parameterization, in Hamiltonian-based cluster dynamical mean field theory (CDMFT) for the one- and two-orbital Hubbard models. We consider two- and four-site clusters for the single-orbital model and a two-site cluster for the two-orbital model. Our results demonstrate that, for small bath sizes, the choice of parameterization can significantly influence the solution, highlighting the importance of systematic convergence checks. Comparing different bath parameterizations not only reveals the robustness of a given solution but can also provide insights into the nature of different solutions and potential instabilities of the paramagnetic state. We present an extensive analysis of the zero-temperature Mott transition of the paramagnetic half-filled single-band Hubbard model, benchmarking our findings against previous literature. We find that for the single-band model the dependence on parameterization is weak for the largest bath sizes accessible with ASCI, while a tendency towards a nematic solution can be seen when the bath size is small. Building on this, we extend our study to the multi-band regime, where we present the first systematic analysis at zero temperature for two orbitals and a two-site cluster. This setup allows us to assess the effect of nearest-neighbor dynamical correlations on the multi-orbital Mott transition. In this case, some quantitative dependence on the parameterization is retained for the two-orbital model, for instance in the value of the critical interaction for a Mott transition.

Title: Physical properties of $R$Co$_{2}$Al$_{8}$ ($R=$ La, Ce, Pr, Nd and Sm) single crystals: An emerging structure-type for anisotropic Kondo lattice studies
Authors: Fernando A. Garcia, Sushma Kumari, Juan Schmidt, Cris Adriano, Aashish Sapkota, Paul C. Canfield, Rebecca Flint, Raquel A. Ribeiro
Abstract: Systematic investigations of rare-earth ($R$) based intermetallic materials are a leading strategy to reveal the underlying mechanisms governing a range of physical phenomena, such as the formation of a Kondo lattice and competing electronic and magnetic anisotropies. In this work, the magnetic, thermal and transport properties of $R$Co$_{2}$Al$_{8}$ ($R=$ La, Ce, Pr, Nd and Sm) single crystals are presented. LaCo$_{2}$Al$_{8}$ is characterized as a Pauli paramagnet and transport measurements, with the current along and perpendicular to the orthorhombic $c$-axis ($\rho_{c}$ and $\rho_{ab}$, respectively), reveal a clear electronic anisotropy, with $\rho_{ab }\approx(4-7)\rho_{c }$ at $300$ K. We show that CeCo$_{2}$Al$_{8}$ is a Kondo-lattice for which the Kondo coherence temperature $T_{\text{K}}^{*}$, deduced from broad maximums in $\rho_{c}$ and $\rho_{ab}$ at $\approx$ 68 and 46 K, respectively, is also anisotropic. This finding is related to a possible underlying anisotropy of the Kondo coupling in CeCo$_{2}$Al$_{8}$. The Pr- and Nd-based materials present strong easy-axis anisotropy ($c$-axis) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) orders below $T=4.84$ K and $T=8.1$ K, respectively. Metamagnetic transitions from this AFM to a spin-polarized paramagnetic phase state are investigated by isothermal magnetization measurements. The Sm-based compound is also an easy-axis AFM with a transition at $T=21.6$ K.

Title: Fundamentals and advances in transverse thermoelectrics

Abstract: Transverse thermoelectric effects interconvert charge and heat currents in orthogonal directions due to the breaking of either time-reversal symmetry or structural symmetry, enabling simple and versatile thermal energy harvesting and solid-state cooling/heating within single materials. In comparison to the complex module structures required for the conventional Seebeck and Peltier effects, the transverse thermoelectric effects provide the complete device structures, potentially resolving the fundamental issue of multi-module degradation of thermoelectric conversion performance. This review article provides an overview of all currently known transverse thermoelectric conversion phenomena and principles, as well as their characteristics, and reclassifies them in a unified manner. The performance of the transverse thermoelectric generator, refrigerator, and active cooler is formulated, showing that thermal boundary conditions play an essential role to discuss their behaviors. Examples of recent application research and material development in transverse thermoelectrics are also introduced, followed by a discussion of future prospects.

Title: Anisotropic Josephson coupling of d-vectors in triplet superconductors arising from frustrated spin textures
Authors: Grayson R. Frazier, Junyi Zhang, Yi Li
Abstract: We demonstrate that coupling itinerant electrons to a noncollinear classical exchange field can induce anisotropic Josephson coupling between superconducting $d$-vectors, analogous to the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya and $\Gamma$-type interactions in magnetism. Using perturbative methods, we analyze an $s$-$d$ model on a geometrically frustrated lattice. Noncollinear local spin textures generate spin triplet pairing correlations and can favor spatially varying superconducting order due to anisotropic Josephson couplings between $d$-vectors, endowing a ``pliability'' to the pairing order that competes with the superfluid stiffness. For nonunitary pairing, this spatial texture of $d$-vectors can give rise to anomalous vortices in the absence of an external magnetic field. We further predict a Josephson diode effect with efficiency proportional to the spin chirality of the underlying magnetic texture. These results establish a link between frustrated magnetism and spatial textures of triplet superconducting pairing, with implications for a range of materials such as Mn$_3$Ge and $4$Hb-TaS$_2$, where superconductivity can be proximity-induced or intrinsic.

Title: Superfluid stiffness bounds in time-reversal symmetric superconductors
Authors: Yongxin Zeng, Andrew J. Millis
Abstract: Quantum geometry has been shown to make an important contribution to the superfluid stiffness of superconductors, especially for flat-band systems such as moiré materials. In this work we use mean-field theory to derive an expression for the superfluid stiffness of time-reversal symmetric superconductors at zero temperature by computing the energy of the mean-field ground state as a function of pairing momentum. We show that the quantum geometric contribution to superfluid stiffness is a consequence of broken Galilean invariance in the interaction Hamiltonian, arising from momentum-dependent form factors related to the momentum dependence of Bloch states. The effects of broken Galilean invariance are not fully parametrized by the quantum metric considered in previous work. We obtain general lower and upper bounds that apply to both continuum and lattice models and present numerical calculations of the precise value in several important cases. The superfluid stiffness of superconductivity in a Landau level saturates the lower bound and the superfluid stiffness of the other cases we consider is close to the general lower bound we derive. In multilayer rhombohedral graphene the geometric contribution is shown not to be the dominant contribution to the superfluid stiffness, despite the flat band behavior in the vicinity of the Fermi level. Finally, assuming contact interaction and uniform pairing, we show that the superfluid stiffness is proportional to the ``minimal quantum metric" introduced in previous work. We provide a continuum version of the minimal quantum metric and explain its physical origin.

Title: From Bulk to Nanowire: A Dimensional Journey with CeIn$_3$
Authors: M. H. Carvalho, D. Zau, A. P. Reyes, R. Cong, S. D. House, H. P. Pizzi, A. M. Caffer, D.S. Passos, R. C. Santos, G. S. Freitas, K. R. Pirota, R. R. Urbano, P. J. G. Pagliuso
Abstract: In this work, we have explored the Metallic-Flux Nanonucleation method to synthesize single crystals and nanowires (diameter $\approx$ 170 nm) of CeIn$_{3}$ and compare their properties. The effects of reduced dimensionality were systematically investigated using Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS), Selected area electron diffraction (SAED), magnetic susceptibility, heat capacity, and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). Semi-quantitative EDS analysis revealed a Ce:In ratio of 1:3.1(1), and the SAED results confirmed that the nanowires are polycrystalline with a cubic unit cell. Magnetic susceptibility, specific heat, and NMR data indicated a suppression of the antiferromagnetic transition to $T_N$ $\approx$ 2.4 K compared to the bulk value ($\approx$ 10 K). Furthermore, NMR analysis at temperatures below 2.8 K showed a reduced quadrupole frequency, $\nu_Q$ $\approx$ 1.77(2) MHz, and provided evidence of polycrystalline nanowires formed within the nanoporous alumina template, in agreement with SAED results. We attribute these findings to an increasing magnetic order frustration induced by dimensionality in CeIn$_{3}$ nanowires.

Title: Irreversibility in scalar active turbulence: The role of topological defects
Authors: Byjesh N. Radhakrishnan, Francesco Serafin, Thomas L. Schmidt, Étienne Fodor
Abstract: In many active systems, swimmers collectively stir the surrounding fluid to stabilize some self-sustained vortices. The resulting nonequilibrium state is often referred to as active turbulence, by analogy with the turbulence of passive fluids under external stirring. Although active turbulence clearly operates far from equilibrium, it can be challenging to pinpoint which emergent features primarily control the deviation from an equilibrium reversible dynamics. Here, we reveal that dynamical irreversibility essentially stems from singularities in the active stress. Specifically, considering the coupled dynamics of the swimmer density and the stream function, we demonstrate that the symmetries of vortical flows around defects determine the overall irreversibility. Our detailed analysis leads to identifying specific configurations of defect pairs as the dominant contribution to irreversibility.

Title: Cryogenic magnetization dynamics in tensile-strained ultrathin yttrium iron garnets with tunable magnetic anisotropy
Authors: Jihyung Kim, Dongchang Kim, Seung-Gi Lee, Yung-Cheng Li, Jae-Chun Jeon, Jiho Yoon, Sachio Komori, Ryotaro Arakawa, Tomoyasu Taniyama, Stuart S. P. Parkin, Kun-Rok Jeon
Abstract: We report a significant reduction of low-temperature damping losses in tensile-strained, ultrathin Y3Fe5O12 (YIG) films grown by pulsed laser deposition, exhibiting ultralow damping constants and tunable magnetic anisotropy. Comparative broadband FMR measurements show that tensile-strained YIG films on Gd3Sc2Ga3O12 (GSGG) retain low damping even at nanometer thicknesses and cryogenic temperatures, outperforming relaxed films on Gd3Ga5O12. Based on static magnetometry measurements and microstructural characterization, we attribute these enhanced dynamic properties to the suppression of interdiffusion across the YIG/GSGG interface, resulting from enhanced chemical stability and favorable growth kinetics by the presence of Sc. Our findings highlight the importance of chemical and kinetic factors in achieving few-nanometer-thick YIG film with negligible low-temperature damping dissipation and perpendicular magnetic anisotropy for cryogenic spintronic applications.

Title: Artificial Intelligence for Quantum Matter: Finding a Needle in a Haystack
Authors: Khachatur Nazaryan, Filippo Gaggioli, Yi Teng, Liang Fu
Abstract: Neural networks (NNs) have great potential in solving the ground state of various many-body problems. However, several key challenges remain to be overcome before NNs can tackle problems and system sizes inaccessible with more established tools. Here, we present a general and efficient method for learning the NN representation of an arbitrary many-body complex wave function from its $N$-particle probability density and probability current density. Having reached overlaps as large as $99.9\%$, we employ our neural wave function for pre-training to effortlessly solve the fractional quantum Hall problem with Coulomb interactions and realistic Landau-level mixing for as many as $25$ particles. Our work demonstrates efficient, accurate simulation of highly-entangled quantum matter using general-purpose deep NNs enhanced with physics-informed initialization.

Title: Exact downfolding and its perturbative approximation
Authors: Jonas B. Profe, Jakša Vučičević, P. Peter Stavropoulos, Malte Rösner, Roser Valentí, Lennart Klebl
Abstract: Solving the many-electron problem, even approximately, is one of the most challenging and simultaneously most important problems in contemporary condensed matter physics with various connections to other fields. The standard approach is to follow a divide and conquer strategy that combines various numerical and analytical techniques. A crucial step in this strategy is the derivation of an effective model for a subset of degrees of freedom by a procedure called downfolding, which often corresponds to integrating out energy scales far away from the Fermi level. In this work we present a rigorous formulation of this downfolding procedure, which complements the renormalization group picture put forward by Honerkamp [PRB 85, 195129 (2012)}]. We derive an exact effective model in an arbitrarily chosen target space (e.g. low-energy degrees of freedom) by explicitly integrating out the the rest space (e.g. high-energy degrees of freedom). Within this formalism we state conditions that justify a perturbative truncation of the downfolded effective interactions to just a few low-order terms. Furthermore, we utilize the exact formalism to formally derive the widely used constrained random phase approximation (cRPA), uncovering underlying approximations and highlighting relevant corrections in the process. Lastly, we detail different contributions in the material examples of fcc Nickel and the infinite-layer cuprate SrCuO$_2$. Our results open up a new pathway to obtain effective models in a controlled fashion and to judge whether a chosen target space is suitable.

Title: Approximate solutions to the shrinking core model and their interpretation
Authors: Cristian Moreno-Pulido, Rachael Olwande, Tim Myers, Francesc Font
Abstract: The shrinking core model describes the reaction of a spherical solid particle with a surrounding fluid. In this work, we revisit the SCM by deriving it from the underlying physical processes and performing a careful non-dimensionalisation, which highlights the limitations of the commonly used pseudo-steady-state approximation, particularly in liquid-solid systems where fluid and solid densities are comparable. To address these limitations, we derive approximate analytical solutions using a perturbation method that improves upon the pseudo-steady-state model. We also obtain a small-time solution capturing early transient behavior. A semi-implicit finite difference scheme is implemented to solve the full model numerically and benchmark the analytical approximations. We demonstrate that the perturbation solution provides significantly improved accuracy over the pseudo-steady-state model, especially in diffusion-limited regimes. Finally, we propose a simple fitting procedure combining the perturbation with the early-time solutions to estimate physical parameters from experimental data at minimal computational cost.

Title: Electrochemically-driven formation of Intermetallic Cu3ZnLi2 alters Li-transport in nanostructured bimetallic battery anode

Abstract: The role of Li-based batteries in the electrification of society cannot be understated, however their operational lifetime is often limited by the formation of dendrites, i.e. the localised deposition of Li that can cause shorts between the two electrodes leading to the failure of the battery. Nanocrystalline bimetallic current collectors can be used for anode-free Li-metal batteries, with improved Li plating and limited or suppressed formation of dendrites. Here, we demonstrate that the microstructure of an alpha-Brass current collector, Cu 63% Zn 37%, used in an anode-free Li-metal battery evolves during cycling. It initially had a nanocrystalline deformation layer approximately 80 nm in thickness after polishing. After 100 cycles, the initial deformed brass layer was partially converted to a ternary Laves phase Cu3ZnLi2 within a nanocrystalline brass matrix that grew to 200 - 250 nm in thickness. Upon Li stripping, the phase partially decomposes electrochemically, but what remains can sequester Li thus forming "dead Li" thereby contributing to capacity loss. We propose a mechanism for the microstructural evolution including dynamic recrystallization and phase formation. Since this ternary Laves phase emerges during electrochemical cycling alone, binary alloy current collectors must be assessed for metastable ternary phase formation under different cycling conditions to either stabilize and exploit such phases or electrochemically fully strip them.

Title: Strain-Controlled Topological Phase Transitions and Chern Number Reversal in Two-Dimensional Altermagnets
Authors: Zesen Fu, Mengli Hu, Aolin Li, Haiming Duan, Junwei Liu, Fangping Ouyang
Abstract: We present a theoretical and first-principles study of a two-dimensional altermagnet exhibiting spin-valley locking and strain-tunable topological phases. By constructing a minimal tight-binding model constrained by altermagnetic symmetry, we show that biaxial strain can drive a transition from a trivial insulator to a type-II quantum spin Hall (QSH) phase. Furthermore, we derive an analytical strain-induced perturbation theory that identifies two critical curves, dividing the phase space into four regions corresponding to a trivial insulator, a type-II QSH phase, and two quantum anomalous Hall phases with opposite Chern numbers. Remarkably, the Chern number can be reversed purely by changing the strain direction --without modifying magnetization or applying magnetic fields. The model reveals a universal phase diagram for materials with the same symmetry and valley structure. First-principles calculations on monolayer CrO confirm the predicted topological transitions, establishing strain engineering as an effective route for topological control in two-dimensional altermagnetic materials.

Title: Lattice tuning of charge and spin transport in $β_{12}$-borophene nanoribbons
Authors: Masoumeh Davoudiniya, Jonas Fransson, Biplab Sanyal
Abstract: $\beta_{12}$-borophene nanoribbons (BNRs) exhibit magnetic zigzag edges, while other edge configurations are nonmagnetic. However, when the source, central, and drain regions of a logic device are all composed of zigzag BNRs (ZBNRs), the resulting spin polarization remains weak, unless a high voltage is applied. In this work, we demonstrate that lattice vibrations-introduced for example, via a thermal bath coupled to the central BNR-can enhance spin polarization in ZBNRs. This enhancement manifests as marked changes in the current-voltage characteristics, enabling direct experimental probing. In contrast, nonmagnetic edge configurations exhibit phonon-enhanced charge transport. We employ a tight-binding approach augmented with local electron-phonon interactions described by the Holstein model, and compute the phonon-renormalized Green's functions and transport currents using the Landauer-Büttiker formalism. The mechanism is supported by analyzing both spinless and spinful electronic dispersions and the corresponding density of states. Compared to the phonon-free edges, structural distortions lead to anisotropic electron-phonon couplings, which significantly modify both charge and spin transport. These results position phonon as an effective tuning parameter for optimizing borophene-based logic devices via engineered edge configurations.

Title: Revisiting the Fermion Sign Problem from the Structure of Lee-Yang Zeros. I. The Form of Partition Function for Indistinguishable Particles and Its Zeros at 0~K
Authors: Ran-Chen He, Jia-Xi Zeng, Shu Yang, Cong Wang, Qi-Jun Ye, Xin-Zheng Li
Abstract: To simulate indistinguishable particles, recent studies of path-integral molecular dynamics formulated their partition function $Z$ as a recurrence relation involving a variable $\xi$, with $\xi=1$(-1) for bosons (fermions). Inspired by Lee-Yang phase transition theory, we extend $\xi$ into the complex plane and reformulate $Z$ as a polynomial in $\xi$. By analyzing the distribution of the partition function zeros, we gain insights into the analytical properties of indistinguishable particles, particularly regarding the fermion sign problem (FSP). We found that at 0~K, the partition function zeros for $N$-particles are located at $\xi=-1$, $-1/2$, $-1/3$, $\cdots$, $-1/(N-1)$. This distribution disrupts the analytic continuation of thermodynamic quantities, expressed as functions of $\xi$ and typically performed along $\xi=1\to-1$, whenever the paths intersect these zeros. Moreover, we highlight the zero at $\xi = -1$, which induces an extra term in the free energy of the fermionic systems compared to ones at other $\xi=e^{i\theta}$ values. If a path connects this zero to a bosonic system with identical potential energies, it brings a transition resembling a phase transition. These findings provide a fresh perspective on the successes and challenges of emerging FSP studies based on analytic continuation techniques.

Title: Spectroscopic Signatures of Structural Disorder and Electron-Phonon Interactions in Trigonal Selenium Thin Films for Solar Energy Harvesting
Authors: Rasmus S. Nielsen, Axel G. Medaille, Arnau Torrens, Oriol Segura-Blanch, Seán R. Kavanagh, David O. Scanlon, Aron Walsh, Edgardo Saucedo, Marcel Placidi, Mirjana Dimitrievska
Abstract: Selenium is experiencing renewed interest as a elemental semiconductor for a range of optoelectronic and energy applications due to its irresistibly simple composition and favorable wide bandgap. However, its high volatility and low radiative efficiency make it challenging to assess structural and optoelectronic quality, calling for advanced, non-destructive characterization methods. In this work, we employ a closed-space encapsulation strategy to prevent degradation during measurement and enable sensitive probing of vibrational and optoelectronic properties. Using temperature-dependent Raman and photoluminescence spectroscopy, we investigate grown-in stress, vibrational dynamics, and electron-phonon interactions in selenium thin films synthesized under nominally identical conditions across different laboratories. Our results reveal that short-range structural disorder is not intrinsic to the material, but highly sensitive to subtle processing variations, which strongly influence electron-phonon coupling and non-radiative recombination. We find that such structural disorder and grown-in stress likely promote the formation of extended defects, which act as dominant non-radiative recombination centers limiting carrier lifetime and open-circuit voltage in photovoltaic devices. These findings demonstrate that the optoelectronic quality of selenium thin films can be significantly improved through precise control of synthesis and post-deposition treatments, outlining a clear pathway toward optimizing selenium-based thin film technologies through targeted control of crystallization dynamics and microstructural disorder.

Title: Discovery of spontaneous mesoscopic strain waves in nematic domains using dark-field X-ray microscopy
Authors: Kaan Alp Yay, W. Joe Meese, Elliot Kisiel, Matthew J. Krogstad, Anisha G. Singh, Rafael M. Fernandes, Zahir Islam, Ian R. Fisher
Abstract: Electronic nematic order is a correlated phase of matter in which low-energy electronic states spontaneously break a discrete rotational symmetry of a crystal lattice. Bilinear coupling between the electronic nematic and strains of the same symmetry yields a single pseudoproper ferroelastic phase transition at which both the nematic and lattice strain onset concurrently. To minimize elastic energy, the crystal forms structural twin domains, each with a distinct orientation of the nematic director (i.e. each with a specific sign of the induced shear strain). While the effects of externally induced strains on these domains are well established, the intrinsic behavior of spontaneous strain fields within individual domains has been hitherto unexplored, largely due to the lack of appropriate experimental tools. Here, we report the discovery of spontaneous mesoscopic strain waves within individual nematic domains of an underdoped iron-based superconductor, observed using dark-field X-ray microscopy (DFXM). This technique combines high spatial and reciprocal-space resolution with full-field, bulk-sensitive imaging, enabling direct visualization of subdomain strain modulations emerging concurrently with the onset of nematic order. The elastic compatibility relations that govern inhomogeneous strains in continuous solids provide a natural mechanism for the emergent strain waves that we observe. Our findings reveal a broadly relevant form of strain self-organization and position DFXM as a powerful tool for probing the local interplay between lattice strain and electronic order.

Title: Compatible Instability: Gauge Constraints of Elasticity Inherited by Electronic Nematic Criticality
Authors: W. Joe Meese, Rafael M. Fernandes
Abstract: Electronic nematicity is widely observed in quantum materials with varying degrees of electronic correlation, manifesting through charge, spin, orbital, or superconducting degrees of freedom. A phenomenological model capable of describing this broad set of systems must also account for nemato-elasticity, by which nematic and elastic degrees of freedom become intertwined. However, being a tensor gauge field theory, elasticity must satisfy the compatibility relations which guarantee the integrability of lattice deformations. Here, we develop a formalism for nemato-elasticity that manifestly respects the elastic compatibility relations. We show that these constraints bifurcate the phase space of nematic fluctuations into two orthogonal sectors: one compatible and thus critical, the other incompatible and therefore gapped. The suppression of the latter leads to universal direction-selective nematic criticality in any crystal lattice. Moreover, the critical nematic modes are protected from pinning effects induced by microscopic defect strains, which necessarily induce both longitudinal and transverse correlated random fields. Finally, our results also reconcile seemingly contradictory nematic phenomena, such as the mean-field character of the nematic transition and the widespread presence of domain formation.

Title: Theory of Electronic Nematic Criticality Constrained by Elastic Compatibility
Authors: W. Joe Meese, Rafael M. Fernandes
Abstract: The defining property of electronic nematicity -- the spontaneous breaking of rotational symmetry -- implies an unavoidable coupling between the nematic order parameter and elastic strain fields, known as nemato-elasticity. While both quantities are rank-2 tensors, the strain tensor is constrained through the Saint Venant compatibility relations. These three coupled second-order partial differential equations arise from the lattice displacement vector's role as a potential field, and they reflect the underlying gauge invariance of geometric deformations which are violated only in the presence of crystalline defects. In this work, we develop a theory of nemato-elasticity that incorporates elastic compatibility explicitly through a co-rotating helical basis. With our formalism, we show elasticity bestows tensor compatibility upon the nematic order parameter by suppressing incompatible nematic fluctuations. As a result, nemato-elasticity is markedly different from bare nematicity. In ideal media devoid of defects, we show the suppression of incompatible nematicity underlies direction-selective criticality, even in the absence of crystalline anisotropy. In systems with defects, meanwhile, we show that elastic pinning fields emanate from quenched defects, generating random longitudinal and transverse conjugate fields for the local nematic order parameter. The coexistence of direction-selective nematic criticality with pinning effects from random fields is explained within our theory from the transformation to the helical basis, implying that local experimental probes of nematicity will be influenced by a linear -- but nonlocal -- combination of long-ranged and short-ranged helical nematic modes. Because the compatibility relations are gauge constraints endowed in the isotropic medium, our results constitute universal features of nemato-elastic criticality present in all crystalline systems.

Title: Double descent: When do neural quantum states generalize?
Authors: M. Schuyler Moss, Alev Orfi, Christopher Roth, Anirvan M. Sengupta, Antoine Georges, Dries Sels, Anna Dawid, Agnes Valenti
Abstract: Neural quantum states (NQS) provide flexible wavefunction parameterizations for numerical studies of quantum many-body physics. While inspired by deep learning, it remains unclear to what extent NQS share characteristics with neural networks used for standard machine learning tasks. We demonstrate that NQS exhibit the double descent phenomenon, a key feature of modern deep learning, where generalization worsens as network size increases before improving again in an overparameterized regime. Notably, we find the second descent to occur only for network sizes much larger than the Hilbert space dimension, indicating that NQS typically operate in an underparameterized regime, where increasing network size can degrade generalization. Our analysis reveals that the optimal network size in this regime depends on the number of unique training samples, highlighting the importance of sampling strategies. These findings suggest the need for symmetry-aware, physics-informed architecture design, rather than directly adopting machine learning heuristics.

Title: Bosonized Momentum Distribution of a Fermi Gas via Friedrichs Diagrams
Authors: Sascha Lill
Abstract: Recently, Benedikter and the author proved an approximate formula for the momentum distribution of a 3d fermionic gas interacting by a short-range pair potential in the mean-field regime, within a trial state close to the ground state. Here, we derive an exact formula for the momentum distribution in this trial state, using a diagrammatic formalism due to Friedrichs. We further demonstrate how the formula of Benedikter and the author arises from a restriction of the contributing diagrams to those corresponding to a bosonization approximation.

Title: Thermal Area Law in Long-Range Interacting Systems
Authors: Donghoon Kim, Tomotaka Kuwahara, Keiji Saito
Abstract: The area law of the bipartite information measure characterizes one of the most fundamental aspects of quantum many-body physics. In thermal equilibrium, the area law for the mutual information universally holds at arbitrary temperatures as long as the systems have short-range interactions. In systems with power-law decaying interactions, $r^{-\alpha}$ ($r$: distance), conditions for the thermal area law are elusive. In this work, we aim to clarify the optimal condition $\alpha> \alpha_c$ such that the thermal area law universally holds. A standard approach to considering the conditions is to focus on the magnitude of the boundary interaction between two subsystems. However, we find here that the thermal area law is more robust than this conventional argument suggests. We show the optimal threshold for the thermal area law by $\alpha_c= (D+1)/2$ ($D$: the spatial dimension of the lattice), assuming a power-law decay of the clustering for the bipartite correlations. Remarkably, this condition encompasses even the thermodynamically unstable regimes $\alpha < D$. We verify this condition numerically, finding that it is qualitatively accurate for both integrable and non-integrable systems. Unconditional proof of the thermal area law is possible by developing the power-law clustering theorem for $\alpha > D$ above a threshold temperature. Furthermore, the numerical calculation for the logarithmic negativity shows that the same criterion $\alpha > (D+1)/2$ applies to the thermal area law for quantum entanglement.

Title: Condensation of vanishing photon emission rates in random atomic clouds
Authors: Viviana Viggiano, Romain Bachelard, Fabio Deelan Cunden, Paolo Facchi, Robin Kaiser, Saverio Pascazio, Francesco V. Pepe, Antonello Scardicchio
Abstract: In the collective photon emission from atomic clouds both the atomic transition frequency and the decay rate are modified compared to a single isolated atom, leading to the effects of superradiance and subradiance. In this article, we analyse the properties of the Euclidean random matrix associated to the radiative dynamics of a cold atomic cloud, previously investigated in the contexts of photon localization and Dicke super- and subradiance. We present evidence of a new type of phase transition, surprisingly controlled by the cooperativeness parameter, rather than the spatial density or the diagonal disorder. The numerical results corroborate the occurrence of such a phase transition at a critical value of the cooperativeness parameter, above which the lower edge of the spectrum vanishes exhibiting a macroscopic accumulation of eigenvalues. Independent evaluations based on the two phenomena provide the same value of the critical cooperativeness parameter.

Title: Information Scrambling in Bosonic Gaussian Dynamics
Authors: Ali Mollabashi, Saleh Rahimi-Keshari
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of information scrambling in bosonic systems undergoing Gaussian unitary evolution associated with quadratic Hamiltonians. For initial Gaussian states, we observe the disappearance of the memory effect in the entanglement dynamics of disjoint blocks under Gaussian random local dynamics. In addition, we show that randomness in the Hamiltonian causes the tripartite mutual information to saturate at relatively large negative values. Therefore, despite being integrable, these systems exhibit information-scrambling diagnostics that mirror those observed in chaotic systems. We note, however, that random quadratic Hamiltonians can have a component exhibiting Wigner-Dyson energy-level statistics; for non-Gaussian states within the corresponding subspace, these systems can display chaotic behavior. Our results provide insight into the Gaussian dynamics of continuous-variable systems, which are useful and available resources for quantum information processing.

Title: Why collective behaviours self-organise to criticality: A primer on information-theoretic and thermodynamic utility measures
Authors: Qianyang Chen, Mikhail Prokopenko
Abstract: Collective behaviours are frequently observed to self-organise to criticality. Existing proposals to explain these phenomena are fragmented across disciplines and only partially answer the question. This primer compares the underlying, intrinsic, utilities that may explain the self-organisation of collective behaviours near criticality. We focus on information-driven approaches (predictive information, empowerment, and active inference), as well as an approach incorporating both information theory and thermodynamics (thermodynamic efficiency). By interpreting the Ising model as a perception-action loop, we compare how different intrinsic utilities shape collective behaviour and analyse the distinct characteristics that arise when each is optimised. In particular, we highlight that thermodynamic efficiency -- measuring the ratio of predictability gained by the system to its energy costs -- reaches its maximum at the critical regime. Finally, we propose the Principle of Super-efficiency, suggesting that collective behaviours self-organise to the critical regime where optimal efficiency is achieved with respect to the entropy reduction relative to the thermodynamic costs.

Title: Counterdiabatic Route to Entanglement Steering and Dynamical Freezing in the Floquet Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick Model
Authors: Nakshatra Gangopadhay, Sayan Choudhury
Abstract: Controlling the dynamics of quantum many-body systems is crucial for developing quantum technologies. This work demonstrates that counter-diabatic (CD) driving provides a powerful tool for steering collective spin systems along entangled trajectories for a long time. In particular, CD driving leads to approximate stroboscopic freezing and eternal entanglement oscillations for a large class of initial states in the periodically driven Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model. Intriguingly, CD driving generates spin squeezing and its associated metrologically useful multipartite entanglement at the mid-point of every drive cycle, when the system is initially prepared in a fully x-polarized state. The CD driving induced non-ergodic dynamics is accompanied by a decrease in the average eigenstate entanglement and inverse participation ratio, thereby signalling greater eigenstate localization. Our work opens a new route to evade Floquet heating and control entanglement generation in collective spin systems.

Title: Mode analysis of Nambu-Goldstone modes in U(1) charged first-order relativistic viscous hydrodynamics
Authors: Atsuhisa Ota
Abstract: We conduct a mode analysis of a general $U(1)$-charged first-order relativistic hydrodynamics within the framework of effective field theory for dissipative fluids in flat Minkowski spacetime. We derive the most general quadratic action for hydrodynamic modes, including stochastic noise, and analyze the corresponding dispersion relations in a consistent gradient expansion. We argue that spontaneous breaking of spacetime symmetry arises in the presence of a local thermal state specified by a local timelike four-vector. We demonstrate that hydrodynamical perturbations can be identified as Nambu-Goldstone (NG) modes, analogous to their embedding in global $U(1)$-invariant theories. We find that frame-invariant combinations of hydrodynamic transport coefficients determine the first-order dispersion relations in the low-energy limit, making the mode analysis manifestly independent of the choice of hydrodynamic frame. Assuming local Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) symmetry and unitarity of the underlying UV theory, we show that first-order hydrodynamics is stable if the enthalpy density is positive.

Title: Arbitrary Lagrangian--Eulerian finite element method for lipid membranes
Authors: Amaresh Sahu
Abstract: An arbitrary Lagrangian--Eulerian finite element method and numerical implementation for curved and deforming lipid membranes is presented here. The membrane surface is endowed with a mesh whose in-plane motion need not depend on the in-plane flow of lipids. Instead, in-plane mesh dynamics can be specified arbitrarily. A new class of mesh motions is introduced, where the mesh velocity satisfies the dynamical equations of a user-specified two-dimensional material. A Lagrange multiplier constrains the out-of-plane membrane and mesh velocities to be equal, such that the mesh and material always overlap. An associated numerical inf--sup instability ensues, and is removed by adapting established techniques in the finite element analysis of fluids. In our implementation, the aforementioned Lagrange multiplier is projected onto a discontinuous space of piecewise linear functions. The new mesh motion is compared to established Lagrangian and Eulerian formulations by investigating a preeminent numerical benchmark of biological significance: the pulling of a membrane tether from a flat patch, and its subsequent lateral translation.

Title: Extracting the spin excitation spectrum of a fermionic system using a quantum processor
Authors: Lucia Vilchez-Estevez, Raul A. Santos, Sabrina Yue Wang, Filippo Maria Gambetta
Abstract: Understanding low-energy excitations in fermionic systems is crucial for their characterization. They determine the response of the system to external weak perturbations, its dynamical correlation functions, and provide mechanisms for the emergence of exotic phases of matter. In this work, we study the spin excitation spectra of the 1D Fermi-Hubbard model using a digital quantum processor. Introducing a protocol that is naturally suited for simulation on quantum computers, we recover the retarded spin Green's function from the time evolution of simple observables after a specific quantum quench. We exploit the robustness of the protocol to perturbations of the initial state to minimize the quantum resources required for the initial state preparation, and to allocate the majority of them to a Trotterized time-dynamics simulation. This, combined with the intrinsic resilience to noise of the protocol, allows us to accurately reconstruct the spin excitation spectrum for large instances of the 1D Fermi-Hubbard model without making use of expensive error mitigation techniques, using up to 30 qubits of an IBM Heron r2 device.

Title: Fragile topology on solid grounds: a mathematical perspective
Authors: Simon Becker, Zhongkai Tao, Mengxuan Yang
Abstract: This paper provides a mathematical perspective on fragile topology phenomena in condensed matter physics. In dimension $d \leq 3$, vanishing Chern classes of bundles of Bloch eigenfunctions characterize operators with exponentially localized Wannier functions (these functions form convenient bases of spectrally determined subspaces of $L^2$). However, for systems with additional symmetries, such as the $C_{2}T$ (space-time reversal) or the $PT$ (parity-time) symmetry, a set of exponentially localized Wannier functions compatible with such symmetry may not exist. We show that for rank 2 Bloch bundles with such symmetry, non-trivial Euler classes are obstructions to constructing exponentially localized compatible Wannier functions. We also show that this obstruction can be lifted by adding additional Bloch bundles with the symmetry, even though the Stiefel--Whitney class of the total bundle is non-trivial. This allows a construction of exponentially localized Wannier functions compatible with the symmetry and that is referred to as topological fragility.

Title: The "double" square-root law: Evidence for the mechanical origin of market impact using Tokyo Stock Exchange data
Authors: Guillaume Maitrier, Grégoire Loeper, Kiyoshi Kanazawa, Jean-Philippe Bouchaud
Abstract: Understanding the impact of trades on prices is a crucial question for both academic research and industry practice. It is well established that impact follows a square-root impact as a function of traded volume. However, the microscopic origin of such a law remains elusive: empirical studies are particularly challenging due to the anonymity of orders in public data. Indeed, there is ongoing debate about whether price impact has a mechanical origin or whether it is primarily driven by information, as suggested by many economic theories. In this paper, we revisit this question using a very detailed dataset provided by the Japanese stock exchange, containing the trader IDs for all orders sent to the exchange between 2012 and 2018. Our central result is that such a law has in fact microscopic roots and applies already at the level of single child orders, provided one waits long enough for the market to "digest" them. The mesoscopic impact of metaorders arises from a "double" square-root effect: square-root in volume of individual impact, followed by an inverse square-root decay as a function of time. Since market orders are anonymous, we expect and indeed find that these results apply to any market orders, and the impact of synthetic metaorders, reconstructed by scrambling the identity of the issuers, is described by the very same square-root impact law. We conclude that price impact is essentially mechanical, at odds with theories that emphasize the information content of such trades to explain the square-root impact law.

Title: Nonequilibrium Critical Scaling of a Squeezing Phase Transition
Authors: Arman Duha, S. E. Begg, Thomas Bilitewski
Abstract: We investigate phase transitions in the nonequilibrium dynamics of power-law interacting spin-1/2 bilayer XXZ models, which have recently been shown to allow generation of entanglement in the form of two-mode squeezing. We find a transition between a collective phase characterized by Heisenberg limited squeezing and a partially collective phase with scalable squeezing. We identify universal scaling of the squeezing dynamics in terms of system parameters and a divergent time-scale, establishing these as distinct dynamical phases within the framework of non-equilibrium critical phenomena. Our work demonstrates a novel dynamical phase transition with potential applications in quantum sensing and quantum simulation in cold-atomic, molecular or Rydberg platforms.

Title: O(5) multicriticality in the 3D two flavor SU(2) lattice gauge Higgs model
Authors: Claudio Bonati, Ivan Soler Calero
Abstract: We numerically investigate the multicritical behavior of the three dimensional lattice system in which a SU(2) gauge field is coupled to two flavors of scalar fields transforming in the fundamental representation of the gauge group. In this system a multicritical point is present, where the global symmetry O(2)$\oplus$O(3) gets enlarged to O(5). Such a symmetry enlargement is hindered for generic systems by the instability of the O(5) multicritical point, but the SU(2) gauge symmetry prevents the appearance of the term triggering the instability. All the numerical results obtained in this lattice gauge model fully support the expectations coming from the O(2)$\oplus$O(3) multicritical Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson $\phi^4$ theory, and we discuss possible implications of these results for some models of deconfined quantum criticality.

Title: Efficient Long-Range Machine Learning Force Fields for Liquid and Materials Properties
Authors: John L. Weber, Rishabh D. Guha, Garvit Agarwal, Yujing Wei, Aidan A. Fike, Xiaowei Xie, James Stevenson, Biswajit Santra, Richard A. Friesner, Karl Leswing, Mathew D. Halls, Robert Abel, Leif D. Jacobson
Abstract: Machine learning force fields (MLFFs) have emerged as a sophisticated tool for cost-efficient atomistic simulations approaching DFT accuracy, with recent message passing MLFFs able to cover the entire periodic table. We present an invariant message passing MLFF architecture (MPNICE) which iteratively predicts atomic partial charges, including long-range interactions, enabling the prediction of charge-dependent properties while achieving 5-20x faster inference versus models with comparable accuracy. We train direct and delta-learned MPNICE models for organic systems, and benchmark against experimental properties of liquid and solid systems. We also benchmark the energetics of finite systems, contributing a new set of torsion scans with charged species and a new set of DLPNO-CCSD(T) references for the TorsionNet500 benchmark. We additionally train and benchmark MPNICE models for bulk inorganic crystals, focusing on structural ranking and mechanical properties. Finally, we explore multi-task models for both inorganic and organic systems, which exhibit slightly decreased performance on domain-specific tasks but surprising generalization, stably predicting the gas phase structure of $\simeq500$ Pt/Ir organometallic complexes despite never training to organometallic complexes of any kind.

Title: Collective Modes in Weyl Superconductors and the Axial Anomaly
Authors: Mehran Z-Abyaneh
Abstract: We write the Lagrangian of a time-reversal symmetry broken three dimensional Weyl superconductor in a covariant form. Then, based on an analogy with the Nambu Jona-Lasinio model and by employing the Fierz transformations, we demonstrate that new collective modes should exist in such a system, including a pseudo-scalar Nambu-Goldstone boson and its corresponding amplitude mode plus a vector and an axial-vector collective mode. It is also observed that the pseudo-scalar mode can become massive due to an explicit chiral symmetry breaking term in the Lagrangian. Analogous to pions in low-energy QCD, such a massive pseudo-scalar mode can decay via the axial anomaly.

Title: The Enduring Relevance of Semiempirical Quantum Mechanics
Authors: Jonathan E. Moussa
Abstract: The development of semiempirical models to simplify quantum mechanical descriptions of atomistic systems is a practice that started soon after the discovery of quantum mechanics and continues to the present day. There are now many methods for atomistic simulation with many software implementations and many users, on a scale large enough to be considered as a software market. Semiempirical models occupied a large share of this market in its early days, but the research activity in atomistic simulation has steadily polarized over the last three decades towards general-purpose but expensive ab initio quantum mechanics methods and fast but special-purpose molecular mechanics methods. I offer perspective on recent trends in atomistic simulation from the middle ground of semiempirical modeling, to learn from its past success and consider its possible paths to future growth. In particular, there is a lot of ongoing research activity in combining semiempirical quantum mechanics with machine learning models and some unrealized possibilities of tighter integration between ab initio and semiempirical quantum mechanics with more flexible theoretical frameworks and more modular software components.

Title: Anomalous flow in correlated quantum systems: No-go result and multiple-charge scenario
Authors: Rui Guan, Junjie Liu
Abstract: Correlated quantum systems can exhibit thermodynamic behaviors that defy classical expectations, with anomalous energy flow (AEF) against temperature gradients serving as a paradigmatic example. While AEF has been shown to arise from the consumption of initial quantum correlations, little is known about whether AEF can occur without correlation depletion, or if analogous anomalous transport exists for conserved quantities--dubbed charges--other than energy. Here, we develop a general global-local thermodynamic approach to describe charge exchange between arbitrary correlated quantum systems. For energy-conserving systems, we analytically rule out AEF in initially uncorrelated states, even with the involvement of quantum catalysts, thereby complementing existing studies. In contrast, in systems with multiple conserved charges, we uncover a mechanism for AEF that requires no initial correlations but is instead induced by a drag effect from normal flows of non-energy charges. Furthermore, by treating all conserved charges on equal footing, we generalize AEF to a broader concept of anomalous charge flow, applicable to any conserved charge. We confirm theoretical expectations with numerical examples. These findings deepen our understanding of nonequilibrium quantum thermodynamics and open new avenues for controlling transport phenomena in correlated quantum systems.

Title: A comprehensive Darcy-type law for viscoplastic fluids: I. Framework
Authors: Emad Chaparian
Abstract: A comprehensive Darcy-type law for viscoplastic fluids is proposed. Different regimes of yield-stress fluid flow in porous media can be categorised based on the Bingham number (i.e. the ratio of the yield stress to the characteristic viscous stress). In a recent study (Chaparian, J. Fluid Mech., vol. 980, A14, 2024), we addressed the yield/plastic limit (infinitely large Bingham number), namely, the onset of flow when the applied pressure gradient is just sufficient to overcome the yield stress resistance and initiate the flow. A purely geometrical universal scale was derived for the non-dimensional critical pressure gradient, which was thoroughly validated against computational data. In the present work, we investigate the Newtonian limit (infinitely large pressure difference compared to the yield stress of the fluid - ultra low Bingham number) both theoretically and computationally. We then propose a Darcy-type law applicable across the entire range of Bingham numbers by combining the mathematical models of the yield/plastic and Newtonian limits. Exhaustive computational data generated in this study (using augmented Lagrangian method coupled with anisotropic adaptive mesh at the pore scale) confirm the validity of the theoretical proposed law.

Title: Landauer Principle and Thermodynamics of Computation
Authors: Pritam Chattopadhyay, Avijit Misra, Tanmoy Pandit, Goutam Paul
Abstract: According to the Landauer principle, any logically irreversible process accompanies entropy production, which results in heat dissipation in the environment. Erasing of information, one of the primary logically irreversible processes, has a lower bound on heat dissipated into the environment, called the Landauer bound (LB). However, the practical erasure processes dissipate much more heat than the LB. Recently, there have been a few experimental investigations to reach this bound both in the classical and quantum domains. There has also been a spate of activities to enquire about this LB in finite time, with finite-size heat baths, non-Markovian and nonequilibrium environments in the quantum regime, where the effects of fluctuations and correlation of the systems with the bath can no longer be ignored. This article provides a comprehensive review of the recent progress on the Landauer bound, which serves as a fundamental principle in the thermodynamics of computation. We also provide a perspective for future endeavors in these directions. Furthermore, we review the recent explorations toward establishing energetic bounds of a computational process. We also discuss the thermodynamic aspects of error correction, which is an indispensable part of information processing and computations. In doing so, we briefly discuss the basics of these fields to provide a complete picture.

Title: Probing broken time-reversal symmetry with tailored-light photocurrents
Authors: Daniel M. B. Lesko, Tobias Weitz, Simon Wittigschlager, Selina Nöcker, Weizhe Li, Peter Hommelhoff, Ofer Neufeld
Abstract: Light-field-driven photocurrents represent a powerful tool for generating photocurrents without external bias in light-matter systems that lack inversion symmetry. While these photocurrents are used in electronic applications, such as current sources, switches, and photovoltaics, their presence can also be used to probe material properties in and out of equilibrium, such as topology. Here we advance this path of light-field-driven photocurrent spectroscopy by utilizing tailored laser fields for ultrafast photocurrent generation to study time-reversal symmetry (TRS) broken phases. We employ combinations of bichromatic linearly-polarized laser beams that individually respect mirror (spatial) and time-reversal symmetry, individually precluding photocurrents, but when combined can break symmetries and generate photocurrents. We show, both theoretically and experimentally, that unique choices of the relative polarization angle and two-color phase imposes a forbidden photocurrent selection rule in TRS-invariant systems, as the tailored light maintains TRS while breaking all other spatial symmetries. We then employ state-of-the-art ab-initio simulations to validate this physical mechanism, and, crucially, predict its breaking in materials with intrinsically-broken TRS, creating a background free signal for magnetism and Chern physics. Our work paves way for probing TRS-broken phases of matter in an ultrafast time-resolved manner, not requiring the application of external magnetic fields or even circularly-polarized electric fields.

Title: Spectral BBGKY: a scalable scheme for nonlinear Boltzmann and correlation kinetics
Authors: Xingjian Lu, Shuzhe Shi
Abstract: The Bogoliubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon (BBGKY) hierarchy provides a time-reversal-symmetric framework for describing the nonequilibrium evolution of many-body systems. Despite the success of Boltzmann-based numerical approaches, systematically extending beyond this lowest-order truncation to the full nonlinear BBGKY hierarchy remains a major challenge. Moreover, even at the Boltzmann level, accurately treating the nonlinear collision term still presents significant difficulties. Here we propose the spectral BBGKY hierarchy, an analytically equivalent and numerically tractable reformulation of the conventional BBGKY hierarchy. The spectral formulation reduces the original 6n-dimensional phase-space problem to the evolution of spectral coefficients over the 3n-dimensional coordinate space. We also develop an analytic scheme for computing the collision integrals, which achieves high accuracy and removes the need for ensemble averaging over repeated stochastic evolutions from the same initial state. The scheme evaluates the full eight-fold integral exactly for massless particles, and reduces it to a three-fold one for massive particles. The validity of the spectral BBGKY hierarchy is verified through conservation law analysis, comparison with an analytical solution, convergence tests, and analysis of spectral coefficient leakage. At minimal truncation, the spectral BBGKY yields a spectral nonlinear Boltzmann equation that captures full dynamics with a computational cost comparable to that of linearized approaches. When extended to higher-order truncations, the spectral BBGKY hierarchy provides a flexible framework for studying multiparticle correlations. This framework advances our ability to investigate the early thermalization puzzle in relativistic heavy-ion collisions and to elucidate the applicability of hydrodynamics at remarkably early stages of quark-gluon plasma evolution.

Title: Opinion formation in Wikipedia Ising networks
Authors: Leonardo Ermann, Klaus M. Frahm, Dima L. Shepelyansky
Abstract: We study properties of opinion formation on Wikipedia Ising Networks. Each Wikipedia article is represented as a node and links are formed by citations of one article to another generating a directed network of a given language edition with millions of nodes. Ising spins are placed at each node and their orientation up or down is determined by a majority vote of connected neighbors. At the initial stage there are only a few nodes from two groups with fixed competing opinions up and down while other nodes are assumed to have no initial opinion with no effect on the vote. The competition of two opinions is modeled by an asynchronous Monte Carlo process converging to a spin polarized steady-state phase. This phase remains stable with respect to small fluctuations induced by an effective temperature of the Monte Carlo process. The opinion polarization at the steady-state provides opinion (spin) preferences for each node. In the framework of this Ising Network Opinion Formation model we analyze the influence and competition between political leaders, world countries and social concepts. This approach is also generalized to the competition between three groups of different opinions described by three colors, for example Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping or USA, Russia, China within English, Russian and Chinese editions of Wikipedia of March 2025. We argue that this approach provides a generic description of opinion formation in various complex networks.
