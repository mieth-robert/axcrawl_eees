Title: Scaling of the disorder operator at (3+1)D O(3) quantum criticality
Authors: Xuyang Liang, Xiao-Chuan Wu, Zenan Liu, Zhe Wang, Zheng Yan, Dao-Xin Yao
Abstract: The disorder operator, as an easily measured non-local observable, displays great potential in detecting intrinsic information of field theories. It has been systematically studied in 1d and 2d quantum systems, while the knowledge of 3d is still limited. The disorder operator associated with U(1) global symmetry exhibits rich geometric dependence on the shape of the spatial region at a quantum critical point, meanwhile, (3+1)D is the upper critical dimension for O(N) criticalities, both of which pose a challenge for exploring the disorder operator in high dimensions. In this work, we investigate the scaling behaviors of disorder operators in (3+1)D O(3) models through large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulation combined with theoretical analysis. The universal contributions, such as the current central charge, have been revealed in our calculation, which establishes a concrete link between lattice simulations and continuum field theory. This work opens new avenues for experimental and numerical exploration of universal properties at quantum critical points in (3+1)D models.

Title: $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Universality of the Mott Transition
Authors: Jinchao Zhao, Peizhi Mai, Gaurav Tenkila, Philip W. Phillips
Abstract: We demonstrate that the Mott transition exhibits universal scaling as a consequence of the breaking of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry in momentum space. A direct consequence of this discrete symmetry breaking is the charge or Mott gap itself. From extensive numerics, we proffer that it is the charge compressibility that acts as the underlying order parameter as it is zero in the insulator and non-zero in the metallic state. Additionally, the Widom line (temperature of the extremum of the compressibility) obeys a universal scaling of $T_m=0.39U$ deep into the insulating state directly from $Z_2$ universality. Furthermore, the temperature at which the second derivative of the compressibility has a minimum is independent of lattice geometry, exhibiting a universal scaling of $|U-U_c|^\alpha$ where $\alpha\approx 1$. Finally, our computational approach reproduces the key features of the doping dependence of the compressibility demonstrated in recent cold-atom quantum simulators of the Hubbard model, thereby corroborating our conclusions on $\mathbb{Z}_2$ universality.

Title: Predicting the adhesion and delamination strength of carbon films on metals by high-throughput ab initio calculations
Authors: Elisa Damiani, Margherita Marsili, Maria Clelia Righi
Abstract: Diamond and diamond-like carbon (DLC) coatings are widely employed for their exceptional mechanical, thermal and chemical properties, but their industrial application is often limited by weak adhesion to metallic substrates. In this work, we employ a high-throughput ab initio approach to systematically investigate the adhesion of diamond-metal interfaces, combining a set of technologically relevant metals (Al, Ag, Au, Cr, Cu, Fe, Ir, Mg, Mo, Pt, Rh, Ti, V, W, Zn) with the C(111), C(111)-2x1 (Pandey reconstructed), C(110), C(100), that are most common in diamond and are representative of different types of bonds present in DLC. Thanks to our automated and accurate computational protocol for interface construction and characterization, databases are populated and relevant trends are identified on the effect of surface graphitization, ability to form carbides and metal reactivity on carbon film adhesion and delamination strength. Beyond capturing trends, our workflow yields predictive insights. Indeed, we found that adhesion energy scales with the geometric mean of the constituent surface energies, providing a simple descriptor for rapid screening; while comparing the work of separation with the metal's cohesive energy anticipates the fracture location under tensile loading. A novel method based on g(r) analysis is introduced to identify when contact with a metal drives rehybridization of surface carbon from sp2 to sp3, the structural signature of improved resistance to delamination. These structural changes are mirrored by an electronic rearrangement at the interface, quantified by a charge-accumulation descriptor that strongly correlates with adhesion.

Title: Evaluation of Wafer-Scale SOT-MRAM for Analog Crossbar Array Applications
Authors: Samuel Liu, Chen-Yu Hu, Xinyu Bao, Ming-Yuan Song, Jean Anne C. Incorvia
Abstract: Analog crossbar arrays consisting of emerging memory devices can greatly alleviate the computational strain required by vector matrix multiplications for neural network applications. The ability to produce spin orbit torque-magnetic random-access memory (SOT-MRAM) at wafer-scale positions SOT-MRAM as a strong memory candidate. In this work, we fabricate and measure 300 mm-compatible SOT-MRAM with 150% tunnel magnetoresistance ratio, fast (2 ns) and low voltage (<1 V) operation, low energy dissipation (350 fJ), low write noise (0.1%), and low device-to-device variation of 10%. Through 2-bit quantization aware training and noisy training as mitigation techniques, the measured SOT-MRAM devices attain 95% on MNIST. The bi-stable anisotropy and stochastic switching of SOT-MRAM can additionally be leveraged for stochastic training of binary neural networks, able to reach ideal accuracy for a single device. Lastly, the devices were evaluated on implementation of probabilistic graph modeling and the interplay of tunnel magnetoresistance ratio, probability curve distribution, and conductance noise was shown to reduce potential errors in implementation. Through these results, SOT-MRAM is shown to be a uniquely effective candidate for implementation of crossbar accelerators in memory- and energy-limited applications, able to take advantage of stochastic operation and bi-stability to beneficial results in neural network applications.

Title: Sweet-spot protection of hole spins in sparse arrays via spin-dependent magneto-tunneling
Authors: Esteban A. Rodríguez-Mena, Biel Martínez, Ahmad Fouad Kalo, Yann-Michel Niquet, José C. Abadillo-Uriel
Abstract: Recent advances in the scaling of spin qubits have led to the development of sparse architectures where spin qubits are distributed across multiple quantum dots. This distributed approach enables qubit manipulation through hopping and flopping modes, as well as protocols for spin shuttling to entangle spins beyond nearest neighbors. Therefore, understanding spin tunneling across quantum dots is fundamental for the improvement of sparse array encodings. Here, we develop a microscopic theory of a minimal sparse array formed by a hole in a double quantum dot. We show the existence of spin-dependent magnetic corrections to the tunnel couplings that help preserve existing sweet spots, even for quantum dots with different $g$-factors, and introduce new ones that are not accounted for in the simplest models. Our analytical and numerical results explain observed sweet spots in state-of-the-art shuttling and cQED experiments, are relevant to hopping and flopping modes, and apply broadly to sparse array encodings of any size.

Title: Beyond the Arcsine Law: Exact Two-Time Statistics of the Occupation Time in Jump Processes
Authors: Arthur Plaud, Olivier Bénichou
Abstract: Occupation times quantify how long a stochastic process remains in a region, and their single-time statistics are famously given by the arcsine law for Brownian and Lévy processes. By contrast, two-time occupation statistics, which directly probe temporal correlations and aging, have resisted exact characterization beyond renewal processes. In this Letter we derive exact results for generic one-dimensional jump processes, a central framework for intermittent and discretely sampled dynamics. Using generalized Wiener-Hopf methods, we obtain the joint distribution of occupation time and position, the aged occupation-time law, and the autocorrelation function. In the continuous-time scaling limit, universal features emerge that depend only on the tail of the jump distribution, providing a starting point for exploring aging transport in complex environments.

Title: Theories of Superconducting Diode Effects
Authors: Daniel Shaffer, Alex Levchenko
Abstract: Superconducting diode effects (SDE), both in bulk superconductors and in Josephson junctions, have garnered a lot of attention due to potential applications in classical and quantum computing, as well as superconducting sensors. Here we review various mechanisms that have been theoretically proposed for their realization. We first provide a brief historical overview and discuss the basic but subtle phenomenological Ginzburg-Landau theory of SDE, emphasizing the need to the simultaneous breaking of time-reversal and inversion symmetries. We then proceed to more microscopic treatments, focusing especially on implementations in noncentrosymmetric materials described by the Rashba-Zeeman model. Finally, we review proposals based on other condensed matter systems such as altermagnets, valley polarized and topological materials, and systems out of equilibrium.

Title: Spatially Structured Entanglement from Nonequilibrium Thermal Pure States
Authors: Chen Bai, Mao Tian Tan, Bastien Lapierre, Shinsei Ryu
Abstract: We study quantum quench dynamics in (1+1)-dimensional critical systems, starting from thermal pure states called crosscap states, and evolving them under spatially inhomogeneous Hamiltonians. The spatial inhomogeneity is introduced through a deformation of the Hamiltonian, expressed as linear combinations of the generators of the $SL^{(q)}(2,\mathbb{R})$ subalgebra of the Virasoro algebra. We analyze the free massless Dirac fermion theory and holographic conformal field theory as prototypical examples of integrable and non-integrable dynamics. Consistent with general expectations, "Möbius-type" deformations lead to thermalization in the non-integrable case, and to periodic revivals in the integrable one. In contrast, "sine-square-type" and "displacement-type" deformations prevent both thermalization and scrambling, instead producing late-time, graph-like entanglement patterns. These patterns emerge from the interplay between the deformed Hamiltonian and the crosscap initial state and appear to be universal: they are determined solely by the deformation profile while remaining largely insensitive to microscopic details. Finally, we perform a holographic calculation in three-dimensional gravity using AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$, which reproduces the main features of our (1+1)-dimensional study.

Title: Mutual enhancement of altermagnetism and ferroelectricity
Authors: Chi Sun, Jacob Linder
Abstract: We consider theoretically the possibility of coexisting ferroelectric and metallic altermagnetic order, which has recently been predicted in insulating and semiconducting systems via ab initio calculations. Solving self-consistently a mean-field Hubbard model, accounting also for the energy cost of distorting the lattice to produce an electric polarization, our results show that metallic altermagnetism and ferroelectricity suppress or enhance each other depending on the doping level of the system. Close to half-filling, the system can lower its energy by becoming altermagnetic, but at the expense of losing the electric polarization. Away from half-filling, the coexistence of ferroelectricity and altermagnetism is much more robust toward an increase in the energy cost associated with the deformation of the lattice. Therefore, our results suggest that filling fractions corresponding to doping relatively far away from half-filling constitute the most promising regime to look for coexistent ferroelectricity and metallic altermagnetism with mutual enhancement. Moreover, we propose a way to electrically tune altermagnetism between nodal and nodeless phases as well as achieving coexistence of a nodal and nodeless phase for the two spin species.

Title: Nonadiabatic and anharmonic effects in high-pressure H3S and D3S superconductors
Authors: Shashi B. Mishra, Elena R. Margine
Abstract: Superconductivity in compressed H3S arises from the interplay between high-frequency phonons and a pronounced van Hove singularity near the Fermi level. Using first-principles calculations, we investigate the superconducting properties of H3S and D3S at 160 and 200 GPa, explicitly incorporating anharmonic lattice dynamics and first-order vertex corrections to electron-phonon (e-ph) interactions, thereby going beyond the Migdal approximation underlying conventional Migdal-Eliashberg theory. We find that both anharmonicity and nonadiabatic vertex corrections suppress the effective e-ph coupling and reduce the superconducting critical temperature (Tc). Calculations performed within the energy-dependent full-bandwidth Eliashberg formalism, including both anharmonic and vertex effects, yield Tc values in close agreement with experimental measurements for D3S at both pressures and for H3S at 200 GPa.

Title: Selective Parametric Amplification of Degenerate Modes in Electrostatically Transduced Coupled Beam Resonators
Authors: Vishnu Kumar, Nishta Arora, Bhargavi B.A., Akshay Naik, Saurabh A. Chandorkar
Abstract: Parametric excitation in coupled mechanical systems has enabled advances in sensing, computation, and phonon control. The function of distinct phase modes using parametric driving remains insufficiently explored. Here, we investigate the nonlinear and parametric response of degenerate phase modes in a Double Ended Tuning Fork (DETF) resonator. Our measurements reveal pronounced nonlinearity and parametric amplification in the out-phase mode, attributed to the dominant contribution of the coupling beam, while the in-phase mode remains predominantly linear. Uniquely, we demonstrate parametric excitation through the coupling spring, enabling selective amplification and de-amplification controlled via the relative phase between harmonic and parametric drives. A parametric gain of $\sim$13 dB is achieved in the out-phase mode, with phase-dependent modulation of amplification, indicating its suitability for signal processing, logic operations, and memory elements based on degenerate modes. These results establish a new approach to exploiting mode-specific nonlinear dynamics in coupled resonators for emerging applications in sensing and phononic control.

Title: Evaluation of Structural Properties and Defect Energetics in Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$N Alloys
Authors: Farshid Reza, Beihan Chen, Miaomiao Jin
Abstract: Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$N alloys are essential for high-performance optoelectronic and power devices, yet the role of composition on defect energetics remains underexplored, largely due to the limitations of first-principles methods in modeling disordered alloys. To address this, we employ a machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) to investigate the structural and defect-related physical properties in Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$N. The MLIP is first validated by reproducing the equation of state, lattice constants, and elastic constants of the binary endpoints, GaN and AlN, as well as known defect formation and migration energies from density functional theory and empirical potentials. We then apply the MLIP to evaluate elastic constants of AlGaN alloys, which reveals a non-linear relation with alloying effect. Our results reveal that nitrogen Frenkel pair formation energies and the migration barriers for nitrogen point defects are highly sensitive to the local chemical environment and migration path. In contrast, Ga and Al vacancy migration energies remain relatively insensitive to alloy composition, whereas their interstitial migration energies exhibit stronger compositional dependence. These results provide quantitative insight into how alloying influences defect energetics in AlGaN, informing defect engineering strategies for improved material performance.

Title: Geometric and Orbital Control of Correlated States in Small Hubbard Clusters
Authors: Shivanshu Dwivedi, Kalum Palandage
Abstract: Arrays of semiconductor quantum dots provide a powerful platform to design correlated quantum matter from the bottom up. We establish a predictive framework for engineering local electron pairing in these artificial molecules by systematically deploying three control levers: lattice geometry, orbital hybridization, and external electric fields. Using Hartree-Fock simulations on canonical 3D clusters from the tetrahedron (Z = 3) to the FCC lattice (Z = 12), at and near half-filling, we uncover three fundamental design principles. (i) Geometric Hierarchy: The resilience to Coulomb repulsion U is dictated by the coordination number Z, which controls kinetic delocalization. (ii) Orbital Hybridization: Counter-intuitively, inter-orbital hopping t_orb acts not as a simple suppressor of pairing, but as a sophisticated control knob that enhances double occupancy at moderate U by engineering the on-site energy landscape. (iii) Field Squeezing: An electric field robustly induces pairing by forcing charge localization, an effect most potent in low-connectivity clusters. These principles form a blueprint for deterministically targeting charge and spin correlations in quantum-dot-based quantum hardware.

Title: Liquid anomalies and Fragility of Supercooled Antimony
Authors: Flavio Giuliani, Francesco Guidarelli Mattioli, Yuhan Chen, Daniele Dragoni, Marco Bernasconi, John Russo, Lilia Boeri, Riccardo Mazzarello
Abstract: Phase-change materials (PCMs) based on group IV, V, and VI elements, such as Ge, Sb, and Te, exhibit distinctive liquid-state features, including thermodynamic anomalies and unusual dynamical properties, which are believed to play a key role in their fast and reversible crystallization behavior. Antimony (Sb), a monoatomic PCM with ultrafast switching capabilities, stands out as the only elemental member of this group for which the properties of the liquid and supercooled states have so far remained unknown. In this work, we use large-scale molecular dynamics simulations with a neural network potential trained on first-principles data to investigate the liquid, supercooled, and amorphous phases of Sb across a broad pressure-temperature range. We uncover clear signatures of anomalous behavior, including a density maximum and non-monotonic thermodynamic response functions, and introduce a novel octahedral order parameter that captures the structural evolution of the liquid. Moreover, extrapolation of the viscosity to the glass transition, based on configurational and excess entropies, indicates that Sb is a highly fragile material. Our results present a compelling new case for the connection between the liquid-state properties of phase-change materials and their unique ability to combine high amorphous-phase stability with ultrafast crystallization.

Title: Revisiting and Accelerating the Basin Hopping Algorithm for Lennard-Jones Clusters: Adaptive and Parallel Implementation in Python
Authors: Oliver Carmona, Peter Ludwig Rodríguez-Kessler, Sebastián Salazar-Colores, Alvaro Muñoz-Castro
Abstract: We present an adaptive and parallel implementation of the Basin Hopping (BH) algorithm for the global optimization of atomic clusters interacting via the Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential. The method integrates local energy minimization with adaptive step-size Monte Carlo moves and simultaneous evaluation of multiple trial structures, enabling efficient exploration of complex potential energy landscapes while maintaining a balance between exploration and refinement. Parallel evaluation of candidate structures significantly reduces wall-clock time, achieving nearly linear speedup for up to eight concurrent local minimizations. This framework provides a practical and scalable strategy to accelerate Basin Hopping searches, directly extendable to ab initio calculations such as density functional theory (DFT) on high-performance computing architectures.

Title: Grokking in the Ising Model
Authors: Karolina Hutchison, David Yevick
Abstract: Delayed generalization, termed grokking, in a machine learning calculation occurs when the training accuracy approaches its maximum value long before the test accuracy. This paper examines grokking in the context of a neural network trained to classify 2D Ising model configurations.. We find, partially with the aid of novel PCA-based network layer analysis techniques, that the grokking behavior can be qualitatively interpreted as a phase transition in the neural network in which the fully connected network transforms into a relatively sparse subnetwork. This in turn reduces the confusion associated with a multiplicity of paths. The network can then identify the common features of the input classes and hence generalize to the recognition of previously unseen patterns.

Title: Superconductor discovery in the emerging paradigm of Materials Informatics
Authors: Huan Tran, Hieu-Chi Dam, Christopher Kuenneth, Tuoc N. Vu, Hiori Kino
Abstract: The last two decades have witnessed a tremendous number of computational predictions of hydride-based (phonon-mediated) superconductors, mostly at extremely high pressures, i.e., hundreds of GPa. These discoveries were heavily driven by Migdal-Éliashberg theory (and its first-principles computational implementations) for electron-phonon interactions, the key concept of phonon-mediated superconductivity. Dozens of predictions were experimentally synthesized and characterized, triggering not only enormous excitement in the community but also some debates. In this Article, we review the computational-driven discoveries and the recent developments in the field from various essential aspects, including the theoretical, computational, and, specifically, artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML) based approaches emerging within the paradigm of materials informatics. While challenges and critical gaps can be found in all of these approaches, AI/ML efforts specifically remain in its infant stage for good reasons. However, opportunities exist when these approaches can be further developed and integrated in concerted efforts, in which AI/ML approaches could play more important roles.

Title: Hyperbolic Fracton Model, Subsystem Symmetry and Holography III: Extension to Generic Tessellations
Authors: Yosef Shokeeb, Ludovic D.C. Jaubert, Han Yan
Abstract: We generalize the Hyperbolic Fracton Model from the $\{5,4\}$ tessellation to generic tessellations, and investigate its core properties: subsystem symmetries, fracton mobility, and holographic correspondence. While the model on the original tessellation has features reminiscent of the flat-space lattice cases, the generalized tessellations exhibit a far richer and more intricate structure. The ground-state degeneracy and subsystem symmetries are generated recursively layer-by-layer, through the inflation rule, but without a simple, uniform pattern. The fracton excitations follow exponential-in-distance and algebraic-in-lattice-size growing patterns when moving outward, and depend sensitively to the tessellation geometry, differing qualitatively from both type-I or type-II fracton model on flat lattices. Despite this increased complexity, the hallmark holographic features -- subregion duality via Rindler reconstruction, the Ryu-Takayanagi formula for mutual information, and effective black hole entropy scaling with horizon area -- remain valid. These results demonstrate that the holographic correspondence in fracton models persists in generic tessellations, and provide a natural platform to explore more intricate subsystem symmetries and fracton physics.

Title: High Resolution Polar Kerr Effect Studies of Cs3Sb5 and ScV6Sn6 Below the Charge Order Transition
Authors: David R. Saykin, Qianni Jiang, Zhaoyu Liu, Chandra Shekhar, Claudia Felser, Jiun-Haw Chu, Aharon Kapitulnik
Abstract: We report high resolution polar Kerr effect measurements on CsV3Sb5 and ScV6Sn6 single crystals in search for signatures of spontaneous polar Kerr effect (PKE) below the charge order transitions of these materials. Utilizing two separate zero-area loop Sagnac interferometers operating at 1550 nm and 830 nm wavelengths, we studied the temperature dependence of possible PKE after training with magnetic field. While a finite field Kerr measurement yielded optical rotation expected from the Pauli susceptibility of the itinerant carriers, no signal was detected at zero-field to within the noise floor limit of the apparatus of below $\sim$100 nanoradians. Simultaneous coherent reflection measurements confirm the sharpness of the charge order transition in the same optical volume as the Kerr measurements. Application of strain to reveal a hidden flux-ordered magnetic state did not result in a finite Kerr effect.

Title: Photoinduced Electronic Band Dynamics and Defect-mediated Surface Potential Evolution in PdSe$_2$
Authors: Omar Abdul-Aziz, Manuel Tuniz, Wibke Bronsch, Fulvio Parmigiani, Federico Cilento, Daniel Wolverson, Charles J. Sayers, Giulio Cerullo, Claudia Dallera, Ettore Carpene, Paul H. M. van Loosdrecht, Hamoon Hedayat
Abstract: We use time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (TR-ARPES) combined with density functional theory to investigate ultrafast carrier dynamics in low-symmetry layered semiconducting PdSe$_2$. The indirect bandgap is determined to be 0.55~eV. Following photoexcitation above this gap, we resolve a valence band shift and broadening, both lasting less than a picosecond, consistent with bandgap renormalization and carrier scattering, indicative of strong many-body interactions. Subsequently, hot carriers populate the conduction band minimum and are captured by defect states. A surface photovoltage (SPV) of $\sim$ 67~meV emerges, persisting for over 50~ps, driven by defect-assisted charge separation. The formation of native vacancies, promoted by the low-symmetry lattice, likely gives rise to the mid-gap states responsible for this long-lived SPV response. Detailed analysis of TR-ARPES spectra disentangles the contributions of bandgap renormalization, carrier scattering, defect states, and SPV. These findings establish PdSe$_2$ as a prototypical layered quantum material exhibiting exotic photoresponses on ultrafast timescales.

Title: Effective-Hamiltonian reconstruction through Bloch-wave interferometry in bulk GaAs driven by strong THz fields
Authors: Qile Wu, Seamus D. O Hara, Joseph B. Costello, Loren N. Pfeiffer, Ken W. West, Mark S. Sherwin
Abstract: Effective Hamiltonians are powerful tools for understanding the emergent phenomena in condensed matter systems. Reconstructing an effective Hamiltonian directly from experimental data is challenging due to the complex relationship between Hamiltonian parameters and observables. Complimentary to ARPES, which probes surface electronic properties, bulk-sensitive techniques based on HHG and HSG have shown strong potential for Hamiltonian reconstruction. Here, we reconstruct an effective three-band electron-hole Hamiltonian in bulk GaAs based on HSG. Based on previous understanding of HSG in bulk GaAs in terms of Bloch-wave interferometry, an analytic model is derived to quantitatively connect the Hamiltonian parameters with the measured sideband electric fields under strong, low-frequency THz fields. Assuming that the exciton reduced mass and the parameter that defines the hole Bloch wavefunctions in bulk GaAs are known from existing absorbance and HSG experiments, we show that the bandgap of GaAs, two dephasing constants associated with two electron-hole species, and an additional Hamiltonian parameter that determines the electron-hole reduced masses, can be simultaneously and unambiguously determined through Bloch-wave interferometry. We thus demonstrate the full capability of Hamiltonian reconstruction by combining absorbance spectroscopy and HSG experiments. We find that the extracted bandgap of GaAs is approximately 13\,meV higher than the expected value based on previous absorbance measurements. Quantum kinetic analysis suggests that, in the HSG experiments, the electron-hole energy could have been renormalized through Fröhlich interaction that is modified by the strong THz fields. We also show that the energy threshold in emission of optical phonons can be suppressed by applying a strong THz field, leading to nearly constant dephasing rates.

Title: From Ferromagnet to Antiferromagnet: Dimensional Crossover in (111) SrRuO3 Ultrathin Films
Authors: Zhaoqing Ding, Xuejiao Chen, Lei Liao, Zhen Wang, Zeguo Lin, Yuelong Xiong, Junzhou Wang, Fang Yang, Jiade Li, Peng Gao, Lifen Wang, Xuedong Bai, Xiaoran Liu, Jiandong Guo
Abstract: SrRuO3 is a canonical itinerant ferromagnet, yet its properties in the extreme two-dimensional limit on a (111) crystal plane remain largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate a complete transformation of its ground state driven by dimensional reduction. As the thickness of (111)-oriented SrRuO3 films is reduced to a few unit cells, the system transitions from a metallic ferromagnet to a semiconducting antiferromagnet. This emergent antiferromagnetism is evidenced by a vanishing magnetic remanence and most strikingly, by the appearance of an unconventional twelve-fold anisotropic magnetoresistance. First-principles calculations confirm that an A-type antiferromagnetic order is the stable ground state in the ultrathin limit. Our findings establish (111) dimensional engineering as a powerful route to manipulate correlated electron states and uncover novel functionalities for antiferromagnetic spintronics.

Title: Theoretical design of the large topological magnetoelectric effect in the Co-intercalated NbS$_2$ structure
Authors: Hyowon Park, Ivar Martin
Abstract: A triangular Co-ion lattice intercalated between 1-H NbS$_2$ layers can exhibit a large anomalous Hall effect (AHE) due to the finite scalar spin chirality originating from the non-coplanar $3q$ ordering of Co spins. This large AHE occurs when the scalar spin chirality is uniform in all Co layers, as indeed found in the Co$_{1/3}$NbS$_2$ case [Phys. Rev. Mater. 6, 024201 (2022)]. However, if the spin chirality were staggered with the opposite signs in the adjacent Co layers, the net AHE would disappear, yielding instead the topological magneto-electric effect. Here, we theoretically verify that a transverse electric field generates a finite orbital magnetization under such conditions, consistent with the axion-like coupling. Using first-principles calculations, we show that the resulting magneto-electric coupling, $\alpha^{zz}$ can be as large as 0.9 $e^2/2h$. We also demonstrate that the inter-layer magnetic coupling in these materials can be tuned by strain, enabling the switching between the AHE and the axionic states.

Title: A Review of AI-Driven Approaches for Nanoscale Heat Conduction and Radiation
Authors: Ziqi Guo, Daniel Carne, Krutarth Khot, Dudong Feng, Guang Lin, Xiulin Ruan
Abstract: Heat conduction and radiation are two of the three fundamental modes of heat transfer, playing a critical role in a wide range of scientific and engineering applications ranging from energy systems to materials science. However, traditional physics-based simulation methods for modeling these processes often suffer from prohibitive computational costs. In recent years, the rapid advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have demonstrated remarkable potential in the modeling of nanoscale heat conduction and radiation. This review presents a comprehensive overview of recent AI-driven developments in modeling heat conduction and radiation at the nanoscale. We first discuss the ML techniques for predicting phonon properties, including phonon dispersion and scattering rates, which are foundational for determining material thermal properties. Next, we explore the role of machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) in molecular dynamics simulations and their applications to bulk materials, low-dimensional systems, and interfacial transport. We then review the ML approaches for solving radiative heat transfer problems, focusing on data-driven solutions to Maxwell's equations and the radiative transfer equation. We further discuss the ML-accelerated inverse design of radiative energy devices, including optimization-based and generative model-based methods. Finally, we discuss open challenges and future directions, including data availability, model generalization, uncertainty quantification, and interpretability. Through this survey, we aim to provide a foundational understanding of how AI techniques are reshaping thermal science and guiding future research in nanoscale heat transfer.

Title: Direct observation of the surface superconducting gap in the topological superconductor candidate β-PdBi2
Authors: Akifumi Mine, Takeshi Suzuki, Yigui Zhong, Sahand Najafzadeh, Kenjiro Okawa, Masato Sakano, Kyoko Ishizaka, Shik Shin, Takao Sasagawa, Kozo Okazaki
Abstract: \beta-PdBi2 is one of the candidates for topological superconductors with a superconducting (SC) transition temperature (Tc) of 5.3 K, in which parity mixing of spin singlet and spin triplet has been anticipated, being crucial for the further understanding of relationship with inversion symmetry and parity mixing in the superconductivity. In this work, we measured the SC gap in high-quality single crystal of \beta-PdBi2 by using high-resolution laser angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy below Tc. We found the isotropic SC gaps in momentum space for multiple bands, and observed that the difference between the SC gap of the topological surface bands and the bulk bands is about 0.1 meV, consistent with other experimental results. These direct and quantitative experimental results support the possibility of \beta-PdBi2 as a topological superconductor, characterized by unique crystal and electronic band structures.

Title: Invariants for (2+1)D bosonic crystalline topological insulators for all 17 wallpaper groups
Authors: Vladimir Calvera, Naren Manjunath, Maissam Barkeshli
Abstract: We study bosonic symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases in (2+1) dimensions with symmetry $G = G_{\text{space}}\times K$, where $G_{\text{space}}$ is a general wallpaper group and $K=\text{U}(1),\mathbb{Z}_N, \text{SO}(3)$ is an internal symmetry. In each case we propose a set of many-body invariants that can detect all the different phases predicted from real space constructions and group cohomology classifications. They are obtained by applying partial rotations and reflections to a given ground state, combined with suitable operations in $K$. The reflection symmetry invariants that we introduce include `double partial reflections', `weak partial reflections' and their `relative' or `twisted' versions which also depend on $K$. We verify our proposal through exact calculations on ground states constructed using real space constructions. We demonstrate our method in detail for the groups p4m and p4g, and in the case of p4m also derive a topological effective action involving gauge fields for orientation-reversing symmetries. Our results provide a concrete method to fully characterize (2+1)D crystalline topological invariants in bosonic SPT ground states.

Title: Applications of Machine Learning in Polymer Materials: Property Prediction, Material Design, and Systematic Processes
Authors: Hongtao Guo Shuai Li Shu Li
Abstract: This paper systematically reviews the research progress and application prospects of machine learning technologies in the field of polymer materials. Currently, machine learning methods are developing rapidly in polymer material research; although they have significantly accelerated material prediction and design, their complexity has also caused difficulties in understanding and application for researchers in traditional fields. In response to the above issues, this paper first analyzes the inherent challenges in the research and development of polymer materials, including structural complexity and the limitations of traditional trial-and-error methods. To address these problems, it focuses on introducing key basic technologies such as molecular descriptors and feature representation, data standardization and cleaning, and records a number of high-quality polymer databases. Subsequently, it elaborates on the key role of machine learning in polymer property prediction and material design, covering the specific applications of algorithms such as traditional machine learning, deep learning, and transfer learning; further, it deeply expounds on data-driven design strategies, such as reverse design, high-throughput virtual screening, and multi-objective optimization. The paper also systematically introduces the complete process of constructing high-reliability machine learning models and summarizes effective experimental verification, model evaluation, and optimization methods. Finally, it summarizes the current technical challenges in research, such as data quality and model generalization ability, and looks forward to future development trends including multi-scale modeling, physics-informed machine learning, standardized data sharing, and interpretable machine learning.

Title: Josephson effect with periodic order parameter
Authors: Klaus Ziegler
Abstract: We investigate the Josephson effect in a two-dimensional superconducting system with a smoothly and periodically varying order parameter. The order parameter is modulated along one direction while remaining uniform in the perpendicular direction, leading to a spatially periodic superconducting phase. We show that the periodicity of the order parameter determines the winding number of the eigenfunctions, which serves as a topological characterization of the system. The winding number is calculated analytically and visualized through the trajectory of the corresponding three-dimensional Bloch vector. By solving the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation, we obtain both plane-wave solutions describing bulk states and exponentially localized solutions that correspond to edge modes. The analytic bulk-edge connection is employed to identify the conditions under which the edge states emerge from the bulk spectrum. We find that the winding numbers depend on the boundary conditions, which differ between the plane-wave and exponential solutions. These results establish a direct connection between the spatial modulation of the order parameter, the topological structure of the eigenstates, and the emergence of edge modes in periodically modulated Josephson systems.

Title: Hall-Type and Unidirectional Spin Pumping
Authors: Ping Li, Chengyuan Cai, Tao Yu
Abstract: Conventional spin pumping, driven by magnetization dynamics, is longitudinal since the pumped spin current flows normal to the interface between the ferromagnet and the conductor. We predict \textit{Hall-type/transverse} and \textit{unidirectional} spin pumping into conductors by near-field electromagnetic radiation emitted by, \textit{e.g.}, magnetization dynamics. The joint effect of the electric and magnetic fields results in a pure spin current flowing parallel to the interface, i.e., a Hall-type spin pumping, which is highly efficient due to the strong coupling to the electric field. Such a transverse spin current is unidirectional, with the spatial distribution controlled by the magnetization direction. Our finding reveals a robust approach for generating and manipulating spin currents in future low-dimensional spintronic and orbitronic devices.

Title: Melting line of silicon modelled with a machine-learning potential
Authors: Yu. D. Fomin
Abstract: In the present study we investigate the phase diagram of silicon within the framework of SNAP machine learning potential model. We show that the melting line of diamond phase of silicon is a linear function of pressure, which is in good agreement with experimental data. At the same time the melting temperature is strongly underestimated. Also, this model fails to predict the high pressure phases of silicon.

Title: Numerical Investigation of Single-Core to Split-Core Transitions in Nematic Liquid Crystals
Authors: Daniel Siebel-Cortopassi, Pei Liu
Abstract: We analyze single-core and split-core defect structures in nematic liquid crystals within the Landau-de Gennes framework by studying minimizers of the associated energy functional. A bifurcation occurs at a critical temperature threshold, below which both split-core and single-core configurations are solutions to the Euler-Lagrange equation, with the split-core defect possessing lower energy. Above the threshold, the split-core configuration vanishes, leaving the single-core defect as the only stable solution. We analyze the dependence of such temperature threshold on the domain size and characterize the nature of the transition between the two defect types. We carry out a quantitative study of defect core sizes as functions of temperature and domain size for both single and split core defects.

Title: Exciton dynamics in equilibrium and nonequilibrium regimes
Authors: Pushpendra Yadav
Abstract: The bound electron-hole pairs known as excitons govern the optical properties of insulating solids. While their behavior in equilibrium is well-understood theoretically, the nonequilibrium regime at high excitation densities-where phenomena like electron-hole liquids emerge - is less explored. This thesis presents a first-principles study of excitons in two-dimensional materials. We use the GW approximation and the Bethe-Salpeter equation to investigate their properties from equilibrium to nonequilibrium conditions. We first demonstrate how increasing photo-excited carrier density leads to a redshift-blueshift crossover of excitons. We then show that electron-phonon interactions critically modify optical spectra and exciton lifetimes at finite temperatures. Finally, we unify these effects to demonstrate the formation of an electron-hole liquid phase above a critical carrier density and below a critical temperature. Our work identifies how enhanced Coulomb interactions in two dimensions can stabilize this phase at significantly higher temperatures, proposing promising material candidates for observing these collective states.

Title: Stopping power of electron liquid for slow quantum projectiles
Authors: Vladimir U. Nazarov, E. K. U. Gross
Abstract: We revisit the problem of deceleration of a charge moving in a medium. Going beyond the traditional approach, which relies on Ehrenfest dynamics, we treat the projectile fully quantum mechanically, on the same footing as the electrons of the target. In order to separate the dynamics of the projectile from that of the electrons, we employ the Exact Factorization method. We illustrate the resulting theory by applying it to the problem of the stopping power (SP) of a jellium-model metal for slowly moving charges. The quantum mechanical nature of particles manifests itself remarkably in the differences in the SP for projectiles of the same charge moving with the same velocity, but having different masses.

Title: Phases and phase transtions in one-dimensional alternating mixed spin (1/2-1) chain: effects of frustration and anisotropy
Authors: Soumya Satpathi, Suparna Sarkar, Swapan K. Pati
Abstract: We investigate the phases and phase-transitions in one-dimensional alternating mixed-spin (1/2-1) chain in the presence of both frustration and anisotropy. Frustration is introduced via next-nearest- neighbor interactions, while single-ion anisotropy is incorporated at each lattice site. Our results show that moderate frustration can drive a phase transition from a ferrimagnetic state to an anti- ferromagnetic ground state. Remarkably, the presence of a weak easy-plane anisotropy destabilizes the ferrimagnetic order, also leading to the emergence of an antiferromagnetic phase. Interestingly, under strong frustration and anisotropy, the system exhibits signatures of a novel phase with spin density wave (SDW)-like modulation . We explore these anomalous phase transitions by employing exact diagonalization (ED) for small system sizes and the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method to characterize ground state properties for larger system sizes. We also inves- tigate the finite-temperature behavior across various phases using the ancilla-based time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) approach. The primary objective of this work is to elucidate the phase structure of alternating mixed-spin chains under the combined effects of frustration and anisotropy. The primary objective of this work is to elucidate the intricate interplay between frustration and anisotropy in identifying the exotic phases and phase-transitions in alternating mixed-spin chains. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of mixed-spin quantum systems and may offer insights for future theoretical and experimental studies.

Title: Thermal Casimir effect in the spin-orbit coupled Bose gas
Authors: Marek Napiórkowski, Pawel Jakubczyk
Abstract: We study the thermal Casimir effect in ideal Bose gases with spin-orbit (S-O) coupling of Rashba type below the critical temperature for Bose-Einstein condensation. In contrast to the standard situation involving no S-O coupling, the system exhibits long-ranged Casimir forces both in two and three dimensions ($d=2$ and $d=3$). We identify the relevant scaling variable involving the ratio $D/\nu$ of the separation between the confining walls $D$ and the S-O coupling magnitude $\nu$. We derive and discuss the corresponding scaling functions for the Casimir energy. In all the considered cases the resulting Casimir force is attractive and the S-O coupling $\nu$ has impact on its magnitude. In $d=3$ the exponent governing the decay of the Casimir force becomes modified by the presence of the S-O coupling, and its value depends on the orientation of the confining walls relative to the plane defined by the Rashba coupling. In $d=2$ the obtained Casimir force displays singular behavior in the limit of vanishing $\nu$

Title: Impact of AlN buffer thickness on electrical and thermal characteristics of AlGaN/GaN/AlN HEMTs
Authors: Minho Kim, Dat Q. Tran, Plamen P. Paskov, U.Choi, O.Nam, Vanya Darakchieva
Abstract: We investigate the influence of AlN buffer thickness on the structural, electrical, and thermal properties of AlGaN/GaN high-electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) grown on semi-insulating SiC substrates by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition. X-ray diffraction and atomic force microscopy reveal that while thin AlN layers (120 nm) exhibit compressive strain and smooth step-flow surfaces, thicker single-layer buffers (550 nm) develop tensile strain and increased surface roughness. Multi-layer buffer structures up to 2 {\mu}m alleviate strain and maintain surface integrity. Low-temperature Hall measurements confirm that electron mobility decreases with increasing interface roughness, with the highest mobility observed in the structure with a thin AlN buffer. Transient thermoreflectance measurements show that thermal conductivity (ThC) of the AlN buffer increases with the thickness, reaching 188 W/m.K at 300 K for the 2 {\mu}m buffer layer, which is approximately 60% of the bulk AlN ThC value. These results highlight the importance of optimizing AlN buffer design to balance strain relaxation, thermal management, and carrier transport for high-performance GaN-based HEMTs.

Title: Laser-Induced Commensurate-Incommensurate Transition of Charge Order in a Hubbard Superlattice
Authors: Hua Chai, Zhenyu Cheng, Qinxin Hu, Zhongbing Huang, Xiang Hu, Xuedong Tian, Liang Du
Abstract: We investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics of charge density waves in a pumped one-dimensional Hubbard superlattice with staggered onsite Coulomb interactions at half-filling, using time-dependent exact diagonalization. In equilibrium, the system exhibits commensurate charge correlations consistent with the superlattice periodicity. Under laser excitation, the charge correlation function exhibits distinct behaviors across four representative frequencies, spanning both linear and nonlinear optical regimes. Notably, we observe a laser-induced commensurate-to-incommensurate transition in the charge order, manifested by a shift in the peak wavevector of the charge structure factor. This transition is driven by sublattice-selective doublon-holon dynamics, where the laser frequency and intensity determine whether excitations predominantly destabilize the charge order on the weakly or strongly interacting sublattice. Our analysis of the excitation spectrum and site-resolved correlation dynamics reveals the underlying mechanisms of this transition. These results suggest a promising optical strategy for controlling charge order in superlattice-based quantum materials.

Title: High-temperature plasma in Casimir physics
Authors: Suman Kumar Panja, Mathias Boström
Abstract: We present a short review of an unusual but important application for a high-temperature charged plasma. The unorthodox proposition was made by Ninham concerning a contribution from Casimir forces across high-temperature electron-positron plasma in nuclear interactions. The key message in the current work is how high temperatures ($\sim10^{11}$ \,K) pop out as essential. Clearly, classical, semi-classical, and quantum considerations for the background media impact both the Casimir effect and the physics of stars and the Universe.

Title: Ultrafast many-body dynamics of dense Rydberg gases and ultracold plasma
Authors: Mario Großmann, Jette Heyer, Julian Fiedler, Markus Drescher, Klaus Sengstock, Philipp Wessels-Staarmann, Juliette Simonet
Abstract: Within femtoseconds the strong light field of an ultrashort laser pulse can excite and ionize a few thousand atoms in an ultracold quantum gas. Here we investigate the rich many-body dynamics unfolding in a $^{87}$Rb Bose-Einstein condensate after exposure to a single femtosecond laser pulse. By tuning the laser wavelength over the two-photon ionization threshold, we adjust the initial energy of the electrons and can thus investigate the transition from an ultracold plasma to a dense Rydberg gas. Our experimental setup provides access to the kinetic energy of the released electrons, which allows us to distinguish between bound, free and plasma electrons. The large bandwidth of the ultrashort laser pulse makes it possible to overcome the Rydberg blockade which fundamentally limits the density in excitation schemes with narrow-band lasers. To understand the many-body dynamics at the microscopic level, we employ molecular dynamics simulations where the electrons are modeled as individual particles including collisional ionization and recombination processes. We find that the ultrafast dynamics within the first few nanoseconds is responsible for the final distribution of free, bound and plasma electrons and agrees well with the experimental observation. We find distinctly different dynamics compared to the expected transition from an ultracold neutral plasma to a dense Rydberg gas.

Title: Weak-Memory Dynamics in Discrete Time
Authors: Hugues Meyer, Kay Brandner
Abstract: Discrete dynamics arise naturally in systems with broken temporal translation symmetry and are typically described by first-order recurrence relations representing classical or quantum Markov chains. When memory effects induced by hidden degrees of freedom are relevant, however, higher-order discrete evolution equations are generally required. Focusing on linear dynamics, we identify a well-delineated weak-memory regime where such equations can, on an intermediate time scale, be systematically reduced to a unique first-order counterpart acting on the same state space. We formulate our results as a mathematical theorem and work out two examples showing how they can be applied to stochastic Floquet dynamics under coarse-grained and quantum collisional models.

Title: Large electrocaloric strength in ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals with a tuneable operational temperature range
Authors: Diana I. Nikolova, Rachel Tuffin, Mengfan Guo, Neil D. Mathur, Xavier Moya, Peter Tipping, Richard J. Mandle, Helen F. Gleeson
Abstract: The electrocaloric (EC) effect offers a promising energy-efficient and clean cooling technology. We present the first direct measurements of EC temperature change in a new family of EC fluids, ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals (FNLCs), demonstrating in two such materials temperature jumps of $|{\Delta}T_j|$ ~ 0.2 K for field changes as low as ${\Delta}E$ ~ 0.1 $V {\mu}m^{-1}$. Indirect measurements of adiabatic temperature change $|{\Delta}T|$ confirm that these direct measurements are an underestimate and that ${\Delta}E$ = 2 $V {\mu}m^{-1}$ can induce up to $|{\Delta}T|$ ~ 1.6 K, yielding EC strengths $|{\Delta}T/{\Delta}E|$ up to 100% higher than incumbent materials. For temperature spans of 5-10 K, we predict a coefficient of performance of ~21-40. We find $|{\Delta}T|$ ~ 1 K for >100 FNLCs that collectively span all temperatures between $0{^\circ}$C and $100{^\circ}$C. This, together with the new device concepts conceivable with fluid EC materials, offers huge potential for cooling applications.

Title: Investigation of the intrinsic hidden spin texture and spin-state segregation in centrosymmetric monolayer dichalcogenide: effectiveness of the electric-field approach
Authors: Ameneh Deljouifar, Anita Yadav, Nataša Stojić, H. Rahimpour Soleimani, Nadia Binggeli
Abstract: The emergence of hidden spin polarization in centrosymmetric nonmagnetic crystals due to local symmetry breaking has created new opportunities for potential spintronic applications and for enhancing our understanding of mechanisms to electrically manipulate spin-related phenomena. In this work, we investigate within density functional theory the properties of the hidden spin texture and spin-layer segregation in a prototype centrosymmetric dichalcogenide-monolayer material using an electric-field-based method. This method is shown to yield a precise and robust alternative to traditional layer-projected spin-polarization techniques for obtaining the intrinsic hidden spin textures in such materials. Moreover, it gives access at the same time to the spatial distribution within the monolayer of the individual spin-segregated states responsible for the hidden spin textures, not provided by other techniques. With this approach we determine and study the hidden spin textures of the upper valence bands of the PtTe2 monolayer together with the spatial behavior of the probability densities and spin polarization densities of the corresponding maximally segregated spin states. This combined study enabled by the electric-field method yields new insights into the mechanisms controlling the spin-layer segregation and resulting hidden spin texture in such systems. We also discuss the symmetry rules governing the shape in the Brillouin zone of the hidden spin texture, which can be straightforwardly predicted within the present framework.

Title: Active chain spirograph: Dynamic patterns formed in extensible chains due to follower activity
Authors: Sattwik Sadhu, Nitin Kriplani, Anirban Sain, Raghunath Chelakkot
Abstract: Follower activity results in a large variety of conformational and dynamical states in active chains and filaments. These states are formed due to the coupling between chain geometry and the local activity. We study the origin and emergence of such patterns in noiseless, flexible active chains. In the overdamped limit, we observed a range of dynamical steady states for different chain lengths ($N$). The steady-state planar trajectories of the centre-of-mass of the chain include circles, periodic waves, and quasiperiodic, bound trajectories resembling spirographic patterns. In addition, out-of-plane initial configuration also leads to the formation of 3D structures, including globular and supercoiled helical structures. For the shortest chain with three segments $(N=3)$, the chain always moves in a circular trajectory. Such circular trajectories are also observed in the limit of large chain lengths $(N \gg 1)$. We analytically study the dynamical patterns in these two limiting cases, which show quantitative and qualitative matches with numerical simulations. Our analytical study also provides an estimate of the limiting $N$ where the large chain length behaviour is expected. These analyses reveal the existence of such intricately periodic patterns in active chains, arising due to the follower activity.

Title: Spin-orbit coupled spin-boson model : A variational analysis
Authors: Sudip Sinha, S. Sinha, S. Dattagupta
Abstract: The spin-boson (SB) model is a standard prototype for quantum dissipation, which we generalize in this work, to explore the dissipative effects on a one-dimensional spin-orbit (SO) coupled particle in the presence of a sub-ohmic bath. We analyze this model by extending the well-known variational polaron approach, revealing a localization transition accompanied by an intriguing change in the spectrum, for which the doubly degenerate minima evolves to a single minimum at zero momentum as the system-bath coupling increases. For translational invariant system with conserved momentum, a continuous magnetization transition occurs, whereas the ground state changes discontinuously. We further investigate the transition of the ground state in the presence of harmonic confinement, which effectively models a quantum dot-like nanostructure under the influence of the environment. In both the scenarios, the entanglement entropy of the spin-sector can serve as a marker for these transitions. Interestingly, for the trapped system, a cat-like superposition state corresponds to maximum entanglement entropy below the transition, highlighting the relevance of the present model for studying the effect of decoherence on intra-particle entanglement in the context of quantum information processing.

Title: Magnetic Field-Controlled THz Modulation in Uniaxial Anisotropic Spin-Valves Emitters
Authors: Arseniy M. Buryakov, Anastasia V. Gorbatova, Pavel Y. Avdeev, Igor Yu. Pashen'kin, Maksim V. Sapozhnikov, Alexey A. Klimov, Elena D. Mishina, Vladimir L. Preobrazhensky
Abstract: Uniaxial spintronic heterostructures constitute compact THz emitters under femtosecond excitation, with emission amplitude and polarization governed by the applied magnetic field. We demonstrate here efficient magnetically tunable THz amplitude control in ultrathin, exchange-biased Co/Pt/Co/IrMn spin valve heterostructures. Terahertz spintronic magnetometry resolves reversible switching between parallel and antiparallel magnetization states and correlates the high- and low-emission regimes with constructive and destructive interference of charge transients generated by the inverse spin Hall effect in the Pt spacer. A residual low-emission signal is traced to spin-to-charge conversion in IrMn. Phase inversion under front- versus back-side excitation confirms the ISHE origin, while a macrospin Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert model reproduces the field dependence and separates layer-specific contributions. Together, these results define a wafer-compatible spin valve device architecture that enables efficient, low-field THz amplitude control.

Title: Bi-isotropic effects on hybrid surface polaritons in bilayer configurations
Authors: A. Nonato, Pedro D. S. Silva
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the bi-isotropic effects in the formation and tunability of hybrid surface polaritons in bilayer configurations. We consider a heterostructure composed of a medium with bi-isotropic constitutive relations and an AFM layer. Using the transfer matrix formalism, we derive general expressions for the dispersion relations of surface polaritonic modes, including the dependence on the bi-isotropic parameter, and analyze their coupling to bulk magnon-polaritons. As an illustration of application, we consider a heterostructure formed with Bi$_{2}$Se$_{3}$ interfaced with antiferromagnetic (AFM) materials that support terahertz-frequency magnons, specifically Cr$_{2}$O$_{3}$ and FeF$_{2}$. In the strong bi-isotropic coupling regime, the surface Dirac plasmon--phonon--magnon polariton (DPPMP) dispersion undergoes a pronounced redshift, accompanied by suppression of the characteristic anticrossing between the Dirac plasmon and the phonon. This effect, observed in all AFM materials considered, suggests a weakening of the hybrid interaction, possibly due to saturation or detuning mechanisms induced by increased $\alpha$. Furthermore, increasing the Fermi energy of the topological insulator enhances the surface plasmon and phonon contributions, inducing a blueshift of the DPPP branches and bringing them closer to resonance with the magnon mode, thereby increasing the hybridization strength. Intriguingly, this redshift partially compensates the blueshift induced by a higher Fermi level, restoring the system to a weak-coupling regime analogous to that observed at lower Fermi energies. Our findings reveal that both the Fermi level and the bi-isotropic response offer independent and complementary control parameters for tuning the strength of light--magnon coupling in TI/AFM heterostructures, with potential implications for reconfigurable THz spintronic and photonic devices.

Title: Superconductivity in hyperbolic spaces: Cayley trees, hyperbolic continuum, and BCS theory
Authors: Mykhailo Pavliuk, Tomáš Bzdušek, Askar Iliasov
Abstract: We investigate $s$-wave superconductivity in negatively curved geometries, focusing on Cayley trees and the hyperbolic plane. Using a self-consistent Bogoliubov-de Gennes approach for trees and a BCS treatment of the hyperbolic continuum, we establish a unified mean-field framework that captures the role of boundaries in hyperbolic spaces. For finite Cayley trees with open boundaries, the superconducting order parameter localizes at the edge while the interior can remain normal, leading to two distinct critical temperatures: $T_\textrm{c}^\textrm{edge} > T_\textrm{c}^\textrm{bulk}$. A corresponding boundary-dominated phase also emerges in hyperbolic annuli and horodisc regions, where radial variations of the local density of states enhance edge pairing. We also demonstrate that the enhancement of the density of states at the boundary is significantly more pronounced for the discrete tree geometry. Our results show that, owing to the macroscopic extent of the boundary, negative curvature can stabilize boundary superconductivity as a phase that persists in the thermodynamic limit on par with the bulk superconductivity. These results highlight fundamental differences between bulk and boundary ordering in hyperbolic matter, and provide a theoretical framework for future studies of correlated phases in negatively curved systems.

Title: Understanding the swelling behavior of P(DMAA-co-MABP) copolymer in paper-based actuators
Authors: Catarina C. Ribeiro, Nele Link, Jan-Lukas Schäfer, Carina Breuer, Markus Biesalski, Robert W. Stark
Abstract: As interest in sustainable materials grows, paper is being reimagined as a multifunctional substrate with significant potential for future technologies for innovative, environmentally friendly solutions. This study investigates the swelling behavior and environmental responsiveness of a copolymer, poly(N,N-dimethylacrylamide-co-4-methacryloyloxybenzophenone) (P(DMAA-co-MABP)), when applied to cellulosic paper for use in humidity-sensitive actuators. The copolymer's swelling behavior was characterized using dynamic vapor sorption (DVS) and in-situ atomic force microscopy (AFM). DVS measurements demonstrated that the polymer coating significantly enhances the hygroscopic properties of the paper, while AFM revealed the polymer's fast response to relative humidity (RH) changes, shown by immediate height adjustments, increased adhesion, and decreased stiffness at higher RH this http URL on polymer-modified paper-based bilayer actuators demonstrate that incorporating the hydrophilic P(DMAA-co-MABP) results in actuation in response to relative humidity variations between 10% and 90% RH. From these findings, two models were proposed to assess key mechanisms in the swelling behavior: the correlation between the heterogeneity in crosslinking and the polymer swelling behavior, and the correlation between polymer-paper interactions and the hygro-responsive bending behavior. Additionally, thermal analysis was performed by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), providing a comprehensive profile of the copolymer's behavior.

Title: Tunable Colloidal Synthesis Enabling μ-ARPES on Individual Two-dimensional Bismuth Nanocrystals
Authors: Fagui He, Yan Yan Grisan Qiu, Simone Mearini, Vitaliy Feyer, Kevin Oldenburg, Rostyslav Lesyuk, Christian Klinke
Abstract: Two-dimensional bismuth (Bi) is a promising platform for quantum and energy technologies due to strong spin-orbit coupling, high thermoelectric efficiency, and magnetoresistance. However, scalable and flexible synthesis of high-quality Bi with fast research turnaround remains challenging. We report a controlled colloidal synthesis of Bi nanosheets with tunable lateral sizes (0.6 - 4.1 um), hexagonal shape, and a layered single-crystalline structure along the {00l} planes. The nanosheets exhibit excellent oxidation resistance and ambient stability. ARPES measurements on individual nanosheets reveal a band structure in excellent agreement with DFT calculations, confirming high crystal quality and uniformity. Our findings enable fast production and characterization of two-dimensional Bi, paving the way for fundamental studies and integration into next-generation quantum and energy devices.

Title: Strain Engineering of Altermagnetic Symmetry in Epitaxial RuO$_2$ Films
Authors: Johnathas D. S. Forte, Seung Gyo Jeong, Anand Santhosh, Seungjun Lee, Bharat Jalan, Tony Low
Abstract: The magnetic ground state of RuO$_2$ has been under intense debate. Using first-principles calculations, we show that compressive strain along [001] direction stabilizes an altermagnetic phase in RuO$_2$ thin films grown on (100) and (110) TiO$_2$ substrates. We further identify that compressive strain enhances the density of states near the Fermi level, resulting in a Fermi surface instability and the emergence of altermagnetism. The magnitude of strain and the associated increase in the density of states can be tuned by varying the film thickness, as systematically confirmed by x-ray diffraction and photoemission spectroscopy measurements. Symmetry analysis further reveals that (100) RuO$_2$ hosts an ideal altermagnetic order, whereas broken symmetry in (110) films leads to an uncompensated ferrimagnetic state. Finally, we discuss the effects of Hubbard $U$ parameters and evaluate the realistic tunneling magnetoresistance of (100) RuO$_2$.

Title: Dynamical control of Coulomb interactions and Hubbard bands in monolayer 1T-TaS$_2$
Authors: Niklas Notter, Markus Aichhorn, Anna Galler
Abstract: Monolayer 1T-TaS$_2$ hosts a star-of-David charge-density wave (CDW) that stabilizes a low-temperature Mott-insulating state. Recent time-resolved spectroscopies indicate a coupling between the CDW amplitude mode and the electronic correlation strength, yet the role of the screened Coulomb interaction remains unclear. Using the constrained random-phase approximation, we show that the CDW amplitude modifies the bare and screened on-site interactions, leading to sizable variations in the effective Hubbard U. Our combined density functional and dynamical mean-field theory calculations reveal that the Hubbard bands shift in concert with the CDW amplitude, and that a reduced distortion drives a transition from a Mott insulator to a correlated metal. These results demonstrate a direct link between lattice distortions and Coulomb interactions in transition-metal dichalcogenides, providing a microscopic mechanism for light-induced control of correlated phases in two-dimensional quantum materials.

Title: Controlled acoustic-driven vortex transport in coupled superfluid rings
Authors: A. Chaika, A. O. Oliinyk, I. V. Yatsuta, M. Edwards, N. P. Proukakis, T. Bland, A. I. Yakimenko
Abstract: Atomtronic quantum sensors based on trapped superfluids offer a promising platform for high-precision inertial measurements where the dynamics of quantized vortices can serve as sensitive probes of external forces. We analytically investigate persistent current oscillations between two density-coupled Bose-Einstein condensate rings and show that the vortex dynamics is governed by low-energy acoustic excitations circulating through the condensate bulk. The oscillation frequency and damping rate are quantitatively predicted by a simplified hydrodynamic model, in agreement with Bogoliubov-de Gennes analysis and Gross-Pitaevskii simulations. We identify the critical dissipation separating persistent oscillations from overdamped vortex localization. Furthermore, we demonstrate that periodic modulation of the inter-ring barrier at resonant frequencies enables controlled vortex transfer even when the condensates are well separated in density. These results clarify the role of collective hydrodynamic modes in circulation transfer and establish a framework for employing vortex dynamics in atomtronic quantum technologies.

Abstract: We report a comprehensive study of electronic-correlation effects in Manganese-based antiferromagnetic pnictides BaMn$_2$Pn$_2$ (Pn=P,As,Sb,Bi). Our density functional theory plus slave-spin mean-field simulations indicate that all the compounds lie on the strong-coupling side of an itinerant-to-localized moment crossover, corresponding to the critical interaction strength for the Mott transition in the high-temperature paramagnetic phase. We also show that the experimental Néel temperature of each compound scales with the distance from this crossover.

Title: Experimental Milestones Towards Majorana Braiding with Acoustic Metamaterials
Authors: Jackson Saunders, Emil Prodan, Camelia Prodan
Abstract: Here we show the first experimental implementation of the fully general Kitaev chain with complex-valued order parameter $\Delta$ and site-varying synthetic chemical potential $\mu$, using a passive multilayer acoustic resonator design and fabrication. Our laboratory model faithfully reproduces the key symmetries and the topological phase diagram of the model, and displays robust Majorana-like edge modes spatially localized at smoothly engineered domain walls and energetically localized in the middle of the bulk spectral gap. We demonstrate precise control over mode positioning through smooth spatial variations of $\mu$, and validate the stability of the modes and of the spectral gap under continuous and complex variations of $\Delta$ -- both critical requirements for topological braiding operations. These results establish and validate the fundamental building blocks for experimental implementation of complete braiding protocols, opening concrete pathways toward accessible non-abelian physics and topologically protected information processing.

Title: Stabilization of Metallic, Excitonic Insulator, and Superionic Phases in Helium-Rare Gas Compounds at Sub-Terapascal Pressures
Authors: Cong Liu, Jordi Boronat, Claudio Cazorla
Abstract: Helium and rare gases (RG: Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe) are typically considered chemically inert, yet under the extreme pressures of planetary interiors they may form compounds with unexpected properties. Using crystal structure prediction and first-principles calculations, we mapped the phase diagram of binary He-RG systems up to $1$ TPa. We identify several previously unknown stoichiometric compounds that are both thermodynamically and vibrationally stable at sub-terapascal pressures, within the reach of modern high-pressure experiments. In particular, AHe$_{2}$ and AHe (A: Ar, Kr, Xe) adopt previously unreported orthorhombic, hexagonal and cubic phases that remain stable over wide pressure ranges. We further find that He-Xe systems host metallic and excitonic insulator phases at pressures nearly an order of magnitude lower than those required for pure helium, offering a pathway to realize these exotic quantum states experimentally. Finite-temperature simulations also reveal superionic He-Xe phases, in which helium ions diffuse either anisotropically or isotropically depending on the host lattice. These findings constitute the first prediction of helium-based systems that combine metallicity and superionicity, with profound implications for energy transport and planetary dynamo processes. Overall, our results demonstrate that mixing helium with heavier rare gases provides an effective strategy to stabilize metallic, excitonic insulator, and superionic phases at experimentally accessible pressures, opening new research directions for condensed matter physics and planetary science.

Title: Stochastic Resetting vs. Thermal Equilibration: Faster Relaxation, Different Destination
Authors: Nir Sherf, Remi Goerlich, Barak Hirshberg, Yael Roichman
Abstract: Stochastic resetting is known for its ability to accelerate search processes and induce non-equilibrium steady states. Here, we compare the relaxation times and resulting steady states of resetting and thermal relaxation for Brownian motion in a harmonic potential. We show that resetting always converges faster than thermal equilibration, but to a different steady-state. The acceleration and the shape of the steady-state are governed by a single dimensionless parameter that depends on the resetting rate, the viscosity, and the stiffness of the potential. We observe a trade-off between relaxation speed and the extent of spatial exploration as a function of this dimensionless parameter. Moreover, resetting relaxes faster even when resetting to positions arbitrarily far from the potential minimum.

Title: Enzyme Active Bath Affects Protein Condensation
Authors: Kevin Ching, Anthony Estrada, Nicholas M Rubayiza, Ligesh Theeyancheri, Jennifer M. Schwarz, Jennifer L Ross
Abstract: We investigate how an active bath of enzymes influences the liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of a non-interacting condensing protein. The enzyme we choose to use as the active driver is urease, an enzyme that has been shown by several groups to exhibit enhanced diffusion in the presence of its substrate. The non-interacting LLPS protein is ubiquilin-2, a protein that condenses with increasing temperature and salt. Using a microfluidic device with semipermeable membranes, we create a chemostatic environment to maintain the substrate content to feed the enzymatic bath and remove the products of the chemical reaction. Thus, we isolate the physical enhanced fluctuations from the chemical changes of the enzyme activity. We also compare the results to controls without activity or in the presence of the products of the reaction. We find that the active bath is able to enhance droplet size, density, and concentration, implying that more ubiquilin-2 is in condensed form. This result is consistent with an interpretation that the active bath acts as an effective temperature. Simulations provide an underlying interpretation for our experimental results. Together, these findings provide the first demonstration that physical enzymatic activity can act as an effective temperature to modify LLPS behavior, with implications for intracellular organization in the enzymatically active cellular environment.

For example, orbital hybridisation and charge transfer at a vdW interface may result in electric fields across the interface that give rise to Rashba spin-orbit coupling. In magnetic vdW heterostructures, this in turn can drive the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction which leads to a canting of local magnetic moments at the vdW interface and may thus stabilise novel 2D magnetic phases. While such emergent magnetic "interphases" offer a promising platform for spin-based electronics, direct spectroscopic evidence for them is still lacking. Here, we report Zeeman effects with Landé $g$-factors up to $\approx230$ at the interface of graphene and the vdW ferromagnet Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$. They arise from a magnetic interphase in which local-moment canting and itinerant orbital moments generated by the non-trivial band topology of Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ conspire to cause a giant asymmetric level splitting when a magnetic field is applied. Exploiting the inelastic phonon gap of graphene, we can directly access the buried vdW interface to the Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ by scanning tunnelling spectroscopy. Systematically analyzing the Faraday-like screening of the tip electric field by the graphene, we demonstrate the tunability of the constitutional interface dipole, as well as the Zeeman effect, by tip gating. Our findings are supported by density functional theory and electrostatic modelling.

Title: Fractional Chern insulators on cylinders: Tao-Thouless states and beyond
Authors: Felix A. Palm, Chloé Van Bastelaere, Laurens Vanderstraeten
Abstract: Topological phases in two-dimensional quantum lattice models are often studied on cylinders for revealing different topological properties and making the problem numerically tractable. This makes a proper understanding of finite-circumference effects crucial for reliably extrapolating the results to the thermodynamic limit. Using matrix product states, we investigate these effects for the Laughlin-1/2 phase in the Hofstadter-Bose-Hubbard model, which can be viewed as the lattice discretization of the bosonic quantum Hall problem in the continuum. We propose a scaling of the model's parameters with the cylinder circumference that simultaneously approaches the continuum and thermodynamic limits. We find that different scaling schemes yield distinct topological signatures: we either retrieve a spontaneous formation of charge density wave ordering reminiscent of the Tao-Thouless states, known from the continuum problem on thin cylinders, or we find uniform states with a topological degeneracy that can be identified as minimally entangled states known from studies of chiral spin liquids on cylinders. Finally, we carry out a similar analysis of the non-Abelian Moore-Read phase in the same model. Our results clarify the role of symmetries in numerical studies of topologically ordered states on cylinders and highlight the role of lattice effects.

Title: Phases of Quasi-One-Dimensional Fractional Quantum (Anomalous) Hall - Superconductor Heterostructures
Authors: Steffen Bollmann, Andreas Haller, Jukka I. Väyrynen, Thomas L. Schmidt, Elio J. König
Abstract: Motivated by recent observations of fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) in the vicinity of superconducting (SC) phases, we study fractional quantum (anomalous) Hall-superconductor heterostructures in the presence of $U(1)$ order-parameter fluctuations and particularly focus on the case of $\nu = 2/3$ quantum Hall states leading to $\mathbb Z_3$ parafermions. We first employ a phenomenological field theory to qualitatively determine the phase diagram. Furthermore, we generalize a previously established alternating pattern of superconductor and tunneling regions, coupled to fractional quantum Hall edge states, to map the problem onto a topological Josephson junction chain involving lattice parafermions. Using density matrix renormalization group simulations, we establish a phase diagram composed of Mott insulating phases and two different Luttinger liquids whose fundamental excitations carry charges 2e and $2e/3$, respectively. In agreement with analytical considerations using conformal field theory, we numerically find transitions of Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) type as well as a continuous $\mathbb Z_3 \times U(1)$ second-order phase transition characterized by central charge c = 9/5. We finally extract information about a possible ground state degeneracy and comment on the stability of parafermionic edge states in the presence of fluctuations. These theoretical foundations can be expected to be of practical importance for gate-defined FCI-SC heterostructures in moiré materials, in which broad superconducting transitions indicative of strong order parameter fluctuations were observed.

Title: Temperature dependent ferroelectricity in strained KTaO3 with machine learned force field
Authors: Yu Zhu, Luigi Ranalli, Taikang Chen, Wei Ren, Cesare Franchini
Abstract: Ferroelectric materials are a class of dielectrics that exhibit spontaneous polarization which can be reversed under an external electric field. The emergence of ferroelectric order in incipient ferroelectrics is a topic of considerable interest from both fundamental and applied perspectives. Among the various strategies explored, strain engineering has been proven to be a powerful method for tuning ferroelectric polarization in materials. In the case of KTaO3, first principles calculations have suggested that strain can drive a ferroelectric phase transition. In this study, we investigate the impact of in-plane uniaxial and biaxial strain, ranging from 0% to 1%, on pristine KTaO3 to explore its potential for ferroelectricity induction via inversion symmetry breaking. By integrating density functional theory calculations with the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation assisted by on the fly machine learned force field, we obtain accurate structural information and dynamical properties under varying strain conditions while incorporating higher-order anharmonic effects. Employing the Berry phase method, we obtained the ferroelectric polarization of the strained structures over the entire temperature range up to 300 K. Our findings provide valuable insights into the role of strain in stabilizing ferroelectricity in KTaO3, offering guidance for future experimental and theoretical studies on strain-engineered ferroelectric materials.

Title: Probing Topological Phases in a Strongly Correlated Ladder Model via Entanglement
Authors: Aminul Hussain, Nisa Ara, Rudranil Basu, Sudeshna Sen
Abstract: The interplay between non-trivial band topology and strong electronic correlations is a central challenge in modern condensed matter physics. We investigate this competition on a two-leg ladder model with a p-wave-like hybridisation between the legs. This model hosts a symmetry-protected topological phase in its non-interacting limit. Using the density-matrix renormalisation group algorithm, we compute the comprehensive quantum phase diagram in the presence of a repulsive inter-leg density-density interaction. Our analysis, based on entanglement entropy and the entanglement spectrum, reveals a fascinating dichotomy in the stability of the topological phase. We find a non-trivial change in the value of the edge entanglement entropy as we include interaction. Furthermore, we find that the phase boundary separating a trivial insulator phase and a topological one with winding number two remains robustly pinned at its non-interacting location, irrespective of the interaction strength. Variation of the effective conformal field theory's central charge near the critical line explains the robustness of the gap. In contrast, the transition to an insulating phase with winding number one is heavily renormalised, with the critical line shifting significantly as the interaction increases. By successfully mapping the phase diagram and identifying the distinct behaviours of the phase boundaries, our work clarifies how interactions can selectively preserve or destroy different aspects of a topological phase.

Title: Emergence of charge-$4e$ superconductivity from 2D nematic superconductors
Authors: Xuan Zou, Zhou-Quan Wan, Hong Yao
Abstract: Charge-$4e$ superconductivity is an exotic state of matter that may emerge as a vestigial order from a charge-$2e$ superconductor with multicomponent superconducting order parameters. Showing its emergence in a microscopic model from numerically-exact large-scale computations has been rare so far. Here, we propose a microscopic lattice model with a nematic superconducting ground state and show that it supports a rich set of vestigial phases at elevated temperature, including a charge-$4e$ phase and a quasi-long-range nematic phase, by performing large-scale Monte Carlo simulations. Combining theoretical analysis with Monte Carlo simulations, we uncover the nature of these phases and show that the phase transitions are governed by the proliferation of distinct topological defects: half superconducting vortices, $(\tfrac{1}{2},\tfrac{1}{2})$ vortices, integer nematic vortices, and domain-wall excitations. In particular, we demonstrate that domain-wall proliferation is crucial for the quasi-nematic phase and should be carefully accounted for in phase transitions associated with vestigial charge-$4e$ order.

Title: Impact of hydrogenation on the structure, chemistry, and electrical properties of flame-synthesized carbon nanoparticle films
Authors: Luca Basta, Francesca Picca, Pegah Darvehi, Vincenzo Pagliara, Alberto Aloisio, Mario Commodo, Patrizia Minutolo, Vito Mennella, Stefan Heun, Stefano Veronesi, Andrea D'Anna
Abstract: The interaction between hydrogen atoms and carbon nanoparticles is a fundamental process governing the properties of carbonaceous materials in environments ranging from combustion systems to the interstellar medium. This study investigates the effects of controlled atomic hydrogen exposure on young and mature soot nanoparticles, generated in premixed ethylene-air flames, and deposited on substrates. We employed a multi-technique approach to characterize the chemical, mechanical, and electrical evolution of the films. In-situ infrared spectroscopy revealed non-monotonic behavior: an initial increase in aliphatic CH bonds was observed, followed by a decrease at higher hydrogen fluences. This was accompanied by a continuous decrease in the aromatic C=C signal. Atomic force microscopy showed a significant increase in the Young's modulus of the film for both sample types after hydrogenation. This mechanical change was correlated with an increase in the I(D)/I(G) ratio from Raman spectroscopy. Furthermore, both macroscopic current vs. voltage and local scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements demonstrated a notable increase in electrical conductivity. For single just-formed soot particles, moreover, a hydrogen-induced transformation from a semiconductive to a semi-metallic nature was observed. The collective evidence points towards an H-induced CC cross-linking mechanism within the nanoparticle films. We propose that atomic hydrogen facilitates the formation of radical sites, which promotes covalent bond formation between adjacent particles or molecular units, creating a more interconnected and rigid network, with smaller interlayer distance. These findings provide crucial insights into the structural evolution of carbonaceous materials in hydrogen-rich environments, with direct implications for understanding soot formation and for the tailored design of carbon-based materials.

Title: Single-fluid model for rotating annular supersolids and its experimental implications
Authors: Niccolò Preti, Nicolò Antolini, Charles Drevon, Pietro Lombardi, Andrea Fioretti, Carlo Gabbanini, Giovanni Ferioli, Giovanni Modugno, Giulio Biagioni
Abstract: The famous two-fluid model of finite-temperature superfluids has been recently extended to de- scribe the mixed classical-superfluid dynamics of the newly discovered supersolid phase of matter. We show that for rigidly rotating supersolids one can derive a more appropriate single-fluid model, in which the seemingly classical and superfluid contributions to the motion emerge from a spatially varying phase of the global wavefunction. That allows to design experimental protocols to excite and detect the peculiar rotation dynamics of annular supersolids, including partially quantized supercurrents, in which each atom brings less than $\hbar$ unit of angular momentum. Our results are valid for a more general class of density-modulated superfluids.

Title: Role of Phase Fluctuation in Dynamic Competition Between Charge Order and Superconductivity in Cuprates
Authors: Mingu Kang, Pavel E. Dolgirev, Chao C. Zhang, Hoyoung Jang, Byungjune Lee, Minseok Kim, Sang-Youn Park, Ronny Sutarto, Eugene Demler, Jae-Hoon Park, John Y. T. Wei, Riccardo Comin
Abstract: Phase fluctuations are a key factor distinguishing nonthermal (ultrafast) and thermal phase transitions. Charge order in cuprates is characterized by short-range coherence while competing with superconductivity, and as such, it provides a representative case to study the role of phase fluctuation in coupled order parameter dynamics. In this work, we investigated the intertwined evolution of charge order and superconductivity in cuprate/manganite heterostructures using time-resolved resonant X-ray scattering. The resulting dynamics are analyzed within a space- and time-dependent nonperturbative model capturing both amplitude and phase dynamics. At low fluence, photo-induced suppression of superconductivity results in a nonthermal enhancement of charge order, underscoring the dynamic competition between charge order and superconductivity. With increasing fluence, the slowing down of melting and recovery dynamics is observed, indicating a critical role of phase fluctuations. At high fluence, both charge order and superconductivity remain suppressed for an extended time window due to decoupling between amplitude and phase dynamics and the delayed recovery of phase coherence. Our work underscores the importance of phase fluctuation for understanding the dynamic competition between order parameters in cuprates.

Title: Spin Polarons in Flat Band Ferromagnets
Authors: Saranesh Prembabu, Rahul Sahay, Stefan Divic, Ashvin Vishwanath
Abstract: Spin polarons are bound states of electrons and spin-flips that form above spin polarized electronic this http URL bound states conventionally form in one of two settings: in frustrated lattices with dispersive bands -- where the motion of an electron preferences binding a nearby spin-flip -- or in topological flat bands -- where the Chern number enforces an effective dipolar interaction between electrons and spin flips. In this work, we report the formation of a spin polaron in a context that doesn't fall cleanly into either of these paradigms. In particular, we study the one-dimensional Mielke-Tasaki chain, a paradigmatic model of flat band ferromagnetism, which has an exact ferromagnetic ground state, trivial band topology, and quenched kinetic energy in its lowest band. Despite these features, our density matrix renormalization group simulations reveal the presence of spin polarons upon electron doping this model. More surprisingly, combining these numerics with analytic calculations, we show that polaron binding occurs when the interaction-induced kinetic energy of the model is zero -- contrary to intuition from kinetic magnetism -- and the glue binding the electrons and spin-flips arises from weak mixing with the model's dispersive band -- contrary to what occurs in topological flat bands. Our results open the doors to exploring how the quantum geometry of flat bands drives the formation of exotic charge carriers.

Title: Resonating-valence-bond superconductor from small Fermi surface in twisted bilayer graphene
Authors: Jing-Yu Zhao, Ya-Hui Zhang
Abstract: Mechanism of superconductivity in twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) remains one of the central problems in strongly correlated topological systems. The most intriguing question is about the nature of the normal state: is the Cooper pair formed from small Fermi surface or large Fermi surface? In this work we point out the possibility of a symmetric pseudogap metal with small hole pockets, dubbed as second Fermi liquid (sFL). In the sFL phase at $\nu=-2-x$, there is a two-component picture: two electrons mainly localize on the AA sites and form a paired singlet due to anti-Hund's coupling mediated by the optical phonon, while additional holes form small Fermi surfaces. The sFL phase corresponds to an intrinsically strongly interacting fixed point and violates the perturbative Luttinger theorem. We develop a unified framework to describe both a renormalized Fermi liquid (FL) and an sFL phase. We propose that the normal state of the TBG superconductor is the sFL phase, but it evolves toward the FL phase under increasing hole doping. The superconducting phase emerges from the sFL phase by transferring pairing of local moments to the mobile carriers. Interestingly, the superconducting gap can exhibit a nematic nodal $p_x$-pairing symmetry. This work provides, to our knowledge, the first unified theory that explains both the pseudogap metal above $T_c$ and the two-gap nematic superconductivity below it.

Title: SHA-256 Infused Embedding-Driven Generative Modeling of High-Energy Molecules in Low-Data Regimes
Authors: Siddharth Verma, Alankar Alankar
Abstract: High-energy materials (HEMs) are critical for propulsion and defense domains, yet their discovery remains constrained by experimental data and restricted access to testing facilities. This work presents a novel approach toward high-energy molecules by combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for molecular generation and Attentive Graph Neural Networks (GNN) for property predictions. We propose a transformative embedding space construction strategy that integrates fixed SHA-256 embeddings with partially trainable representations. Unlike conventional regularization techniques, this changes the representational basis itself, reshaping the molecular input space before learning begins. Without recourse to pretraining, the generator achieves 67.5% validity and 37.5% novelty. The generated library exhibits a mean Tanimoto coefficient of 0.214 relative to training set signifying the ability of framework to generate a diverse chemical space. We identified 37 new super explosives higher than 9 km/s predicted detonation velocity.

Title: From Divergent Series to Geometry: Resurgence of the Quantum Metric
Authors: Marcos J. Hernández, Bogar Díaz, J. David Vergara
Abstract: In this work, we analyze perturbative expansions of the quantum metric tensor (QMT) in anharmonic oscillators, focusing on quartic, sextic, and $d$-dimensional models. Using high-order perturbation theory, we show that the divergent QMT series exhibit factorial growth. Our analysis identifies universal non-perturbative scales, with coefficients displaying large-order behavior consistent with resurgence theory. Then, we apply resurgence and Borel--Padé resummation to the QMT. Comparisons with exact diagonalization confirm that Borel--Padé resummations yield accurate results, especially for the ground state. For completeness, we also present the analysis of the energy eigenvalues in the examples. Our findings extend resurgent techniques from energies to the QMT, highlighting the interplay between quantum geometry and non-perturbative physics.

Title: Generative Image Restoration and Super-Resolution using Physics-Informed Synthetic Data for Scanning Tunneling Microscopy

Stock (1,2), Alberto Cazzaniga (4) ((1) London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London, London, United Kingdom, (2) Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London, London, United Kingdom, (3) University of Trieste, Trieste, Italy, (4) AREA Science Park, Trieste, Italy)
Abstract: Scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) enables atomic-resolution imaging and atom manipulation, but its utility is often limited by tip degradation and slow serial data acquisition. Fabrication adds another layer of complexity since the tip is often subjected to large voltages, which may alter the shape of its apex, requiring it to be conditioned. Here, we propose a machine learning (ML) approach for image repair and super-resolution to alleviate both challenges. Using a dataset of only 36 pristine experimental images of Si(001):H, we demonstrate that a physics-informed synthetic data generation pipeline can be used to train several state-of-the-art flow-matching and diffusion models. Quantitative evaluation with metrics such as the CLIP Maximum Mean Discrepancy (CMMD) score and structural similarity demonstrates that our models are able to effectively restore images and offer a two- to fourfold reduction in image acquisition time by accurately reconstructing images from sparsely sampled data. Our framework has the potential to significantly increase STM experimental throughput by offering a route to reducing the frequency of tip-conditioning procedures and to enhancing frame rates in existing high-speed STM systems.

Title: Equivalent class of Emergent Single Weyl Fermion in 3d Topological States: gapless superconductors and superfluids Vs chiral fermions
Authors: Gabriel Meyniel, Fei Zhou
Abstract: In this article, we put forward a practical but generic approach towards constructing a large family of $(3+1)$ dimension lattice models which can naturally lead to a single Weyl cone in the infrared (IR) limit. Our proposal relies on spontaneous charge $U(1)$ symmetry breaking to evade the usual no-go theorem of a single Weyl cone in a 3d lattice. We have explored three concrete paths in this approach, all involving fermionic topological symmetry protected states (SPTs). Path a) is to push a gapped SPT in a 3d lattice with time-reversal symmetry (or $T$-symmetry) to a gapless topological quantum critical point (tQCP) which involves a minimum change of topologies,i.e. $\delta N_w=2$ where $\delta N_w$ is the change of winding numbers across the tQCP. Path b) is to peal off excessive degrees of freedom in the gapped SPT via applying $T$-symmetry breaking fields which naturally result in a pair of gapless nodal points of real fermions. Path c) is a hybrid of a) and b) where tQCPs, with $\delta N_w \geq 2$, are further subject to time-reversal-symmetry breaking actions. In the infrared limit, all the lattice models with single Weyl fermions studied here are isomorphic to either a tQCP in a DIII class topological superconductor with a protecting $T$-symmetry, or its dual, a $T$-symmetry breaking superconducting nodal point phase, and therefore form an equivalent class. For a generic $T$-symmetric tQCP along Path a), the conserved-charge operators span a six-dimensional linear space while for a $T$-symmetry breaking gapless state along Path b), c), charge operators typically span a two-dimensional linear space instead. Finally, we pinpoint connections between three spatial dimensional lattice chiral fermion models and gapless real fermions that can naturally appear in superfluids or superconductors studied previously.

Title: Overcoming disorder in superconducting globally-driven quantum computing
Authors: Riccardo Aiudi, Julien Despres, Roberto Menta, Ashkan Abedi, Guido Menichetti, Vittorio Giovannetti, Marco Polini, Francesco Caravelli
Abstract: We study the impact of static disorder on a globally-controlled superconducting quantum computing architecture based on a quasi-two-dimensional ladder geometry [R. Menta et al., Phys. Rev. Research 7, L012065 (2025)]. Specifically, we examine how fabrication-induced inhomogeneities in qubit resonant frequencies and coupling strengths affect quantum state propagation and the fidelity of fundamental quantum operations. Using numerical simulations, we quantify the degradation in performance due to disorder and identify single-qubit rotations, two-qubit entangling gates, and quantum information transport as particularly susceptible. To address this challenge, we rely on pulse optimization schemes, and, in particular, on the GRAPE (Gradient Ascent Pulse Engineering) algorithm. Our results demonstrate that, even for realistic levels of disorder, optimized pulse sequences can achieve high-fidelity operations, exceeding 99.9% for the three quantum operations, restoring reliable universal quantum logic and robust information flow. These findings highlight pulse optimization as a powerful strategy to enhance the resilience to disorder of solid-state globally-driven quantum computing platforms.

Abstract: Simulation of the time-dynamics of fermionic many-body systems has long been predicted to be one of the key applications of quantum computers. Such simulations -- for which classical methods are often inaccurate -- are critical to advancing our knowledge and understanding of quantum chemistry and materials, underpinning a wide range of fields, from biochemistry to clean-energy technologies and chemical synthesis. However, the performance of all previous digital quantum simulations has been matched by classical methods, and it has thus far remained unclear whether near-term, intermediate-scale quantum hardware could offer any computational advantage in this area. Here, we implement an efficient quantum simulation algorithm on Quantinuum's System Model H2 trapped-ion quantum computer for the time dynamics of a 56-qubit system that is too complex for exact classical simulation. We focus on the periodic spinful 2D Fermi-Hubbard model and present evidence of spin-charge separation, where the elementary electron's charge and spin decouple. In the limited cases where ground truth is available through exact classical simulation, we find that it agrees with the results we obtain from the quantum device. Employing long-range Wilson operators to study deconfinement of the effective gauge field between spinons and the effective potential between charge carriers, we find behaviour that differs from predictions made by classical tensor network methods. Our results herald the use of quantum computing for simulating strongly correlated electronic systems beyond the capacity of classical computing.

Title: Quantum dynamics of large spins in static and rotating magnetic fields: Entanglement resonances and kinks
Authors: Nargis Sultana, Siddharth Seetharaman, Rejish Nath
Abstract: We examine the quantum dynamics of a large spin in the presence of static and rotating magnetic fields. By mapping the system onto a gas of non-interacting spin-1/2 particles, we derive exact analytical results for the dynamics with different initial states. The dynamics exhibit periodic oscillations between two maximally stretched states, irrespective of how large the spin is. Further, we observe periodic transitions between sublevels with magnetic quantum numbers of opposite signs. Additionally, the dynamics features the periodic transfer of the spin to the maximally stretched state starting from a superposition state. The evolution of the dipole moment is also explored in each case, and as expected, it is precessing about the instantaneous, resultant magnetic field. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to a pair of spins, taking into account the dipole-dipole interactions between them. We analyze how the ground state entanglement between the spins depends on the external fields. The quantum dynamics of the two spins reveal entanglement resonances and kinks, which can be identified from the energy spectrum when weak transverse field strengths are considered. Finally, we discuss the regime in which the dipolar interactions are relatively weak.

Title: Capillarity Reveals the Role of Capsid Geometry in HIV Nuclear Translocation
Authors: Alex W. Brown, Sami C. Al-Izzi, Jack L. Parker, Sophie Hertel, David A. Jacques, Halim Kusumaatmaja, Richard G. Morris
Abstract: The protective capsid encasing the genetic material of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) has been shown to traverse the nuclear pore complex (NPC) intact, despite exceeding the passive diffusion threshold by over three orders of magnitude. This remarkable feat is attributed to the properties of the capsid surface, which confer solubility within the NPC's phase-separated, condensate-like barrier. In this context, we apply the classical framework of wetting and capillarity -- integrating analytical methods with sharp- and diffuse-interface numerical simulations -- to elucidate the physical underpinnings of HIV nuclear entry. Our analysis captures several key phenomena: the reorientation of incoming capsids due to torques arising from asymmetric capillary forces; the role of confinement in limiting capsid penetration depths; the classification of translocation mechanics according to changes in topology and interfacial area; and the influence of (spontaneous) rotational symmetry-breaking on energetics. These effects are all shown to depend critically on capsid geometry, arguing for a physical basis for HIV's characteristic capsid shape.

Title: Momentum-Transfer Framework Unifies High-Velocity Impact and Failure Across Materials, Geometries, and Scales
Authors: Yasara Dharmadasa, Nicholas Jaegersberg, Ara Kim, Jizhe Cai, Ramathasan Thevamaran
Abstract: Materials that dissipate energy efficiently under high-speed impacts, from micrometeoroid strikes on spacecraft to bullet penetration into protective gear, are essential for preserving structural integrity in extreme environments. Conventional projectile-impact models, based on conservation laws and energy partitioning, often rely on constitutive- and geometry-specific empirical corrections because the projectile-target system is rarely closed and most material behaviors under extreme thermo-mechanical loading remain elusive. In contrast, we show that momentum transfer, governed by the collision impulse, provides a fundamental and unifying description of impact response across a broad spectrum of materials, geometries, and loading conditions. With microprojectile impact tests across varied geometries and scales, validated by targeted macroscale experiments, we examine the interplay of two dominant momentum transfer pathways: material cohesion and target inertia, supported by conclusive evidence from post-perforation microscopy. We reveal a universal upper bound at the ballistic-limit velocity corresponding to the maximum projectile deceleration, which persists across materials, scales, and architectures in both our data and prior studies. By extending this bound into the energy absorption landscape, we identify its parametric dependence across geometry and scale and correct an entrenched misconception that the impact response is not scale-invariant for self-similar geometries. Furthermore, we reveal that specific energy absorption exaggerates the performance of thinner targets by inflating their apparent energy capacity. This work not only redefines how high-velocity projectile perforation is understood but also establishes a framework that applies broadly to momentum-driven dynamic events such as cold spray deposition, surface mechanical attrition treatment, and meteorite impacts.

Title: Wrinkle-Induced Hexagonal Boron Nitride Nanochannels for Biomolecule Localization and Imaging
Authors: Xiliang Yang, Tetsuo Martynowicz, Allard Katan, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Sabina Caneva
Abstract: Fluorescence-based single-molecule localization, transport, and sensing require spatial confinement to extend the molecule's residence time during imaging, sufficient temporal resolution to capture fast dynamics, and efficient fluorescence background suppression. Two-dimensional (2D) materials offer large-area, atomically flat surfaces suitable for massively parallel in-plane biomolecule imaging, yet achieving guided motion in one-dimensional confinements using top-down nanofabrication remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate that thermally induced wrinkles in exfoliated hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) act as self-assembled nanochannels that enable biomolecule confinement and imaging under wide-field fluorescence microscopy. By controlling annealing parameters and substrate properties, we obtain scalable and reproducible wrinkle networks whose densities and morphologies can be tuned. Structural characterization using atomic force and scanning electron microscopy is complemented by fluorescence imaging and Kelvin probe force microscopy, confirming that aqueous solutions fill and remain stably retained within the nanochannels for periods exceeding 10 hours. We further achieve selective ATTO647N-DNA localization and imaging in the one-dimensional channels through the formation of a graphene/hBN vertical heterostructure. The graphene overlayer serves as a quenching mask that suppresses background fluorescence both from high-strain hBN regions and from DNA adsorbed on top of the 2D layer. Overall, these results provide a scalable, lithography-free route for creating planar nanofluidic confinements fully compatible with single-molecule imaging. This platform enables fundamental nanobiology studies as well as on-chip biomolecule transport and sensing applications.

Title: Atomistic Simulations of Oxide-Water Interfaces using Machine Learning Potentials
Authors: Jan Elsner, K Nikolas Lausch, Jörg Behler
Abstract: Oxide-water interfaces govern a wide range of physical and chemical processes fundamental to many fields like catalysis, geochemistry, corrosion, electrochemistry, and sensor technology. Near solid oxide surfaces, water behaves differently than in the bulk, exhibiting pronounced structuring and increased reactivity, typically requiring ab initio-level accuracy for reliable modeling. However, explicit ab initio calculations are often computationally prohibitive, especially if large system sizes and long simulation time scales are required. By learning the potential energy surface (PES) from data obtained from electronic structure calculations, machine learning potentials (MLPs) have emerged as transformative tools, enabling simulations with ab initio accuracy at dramatically reduced computational expense. Here, we provide an overview of recent progress in the application of MLPs to atomistic simulations of oxide-water interfaces. Specifically, we review insights that have been gained into the reactivity of interfacial systems involving the dissociation and recombination of water molecules, proton transfer processes between the solvent and the surface and the dynamic nature of aqueous oxide surfaces. Moreover, we discuss open challenges and future possible research directions in this rapidly evolving but challenging field.

Title: An introduction to Markovian open quantum systems
Authors: Shovan Dutta
Abstract: This is a concise, pedagogical introduction to the dynamic field of open quantum systems governed by Markovian master equations. We focus on the mathematical and physical origins of the Lindblad equation, its unraveling in terms of pure-state trajectories, the structure of steady states with emphasis on the role of symmetry and conservation laws, and a sampling of the novel physical phenomena that arise from nonunitary dynamics (dissipation and measurements). This is far from a comprehensive summary of the field. Rather, the objective is to provide a conceptual foundation and physically illuminating examples that are useful to graduate students and researchers entering this subject. There are exercise problems and references for further reading throughout the notes.

Title: Diamond quantum sensing at record high pressure up to 240 GPa
Authors: Qingtao Hao, Ze-Xu He, Na Zuo, Yang Chen, Xiangzhuo Xing, Xiaoran Zhang, Xinyu Zhuang, Zhixiang Shi, Xin Chen, Jian-Gang Guo, Gang-Qin Liu, Xiaobing Liu, Yanming Ma
Abstract: Quantum sensing utilizing nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond has emerged as a transformative technology for probing magnetic phase transition1-4, evidencing Meissner effect of superconductors1,5-9, and visualizing stress distribution3,9 under extreme conditions. Recent development in NV configurations and hydrostatic environments have raised the operational pressures of NV centers to 140 GPa2,6,10,11, but substantial challenges remain in extending sensing capabilities into multi-megabar range, critical for research in hydrogen-rich superconductors like La-Sc-H ($T_{\text{c}}$ of 271-298 K at 195-266 GPa)12 and evolution of minerals near Earth's core13. Here we report the fabrication of shallow NV centers through ion implantation followed by high-pressure and high-temperature (HPHT) annealing, leading to increased density, improved coherence, and mitigated internal stresses, a pre-requisite for reducing their degradation under compression. This NV magnetometry enable breakthrough of pressure capabilities exceeding 240 GPa, constrained by structural integrity of the 50 um diamond anvils, suggesting that the untapped pressure limit may enable further advancements with smaller cutlets or more robust diamonds. We present compelling evidence of the Meissner effect and trapped flux at record-high pressure of 180 GPa for superconducting transition in elemental titanium (Ti) as benchmark, establishing a solid foundation for high-pressure magnetometry in exploring complex quantum phenomena at previously unreachable pressures.

Title: Tailored heat treatments to characterise the fracture resistance of critical weld regions in hydrogen transmission pipelines
Authors: D.R. Chalfoun, J. Parker, M. Gagliano, E. Martínez-Pañeda
Abstract: A new protocol is presented to directly characterise the toughness of microstructural regions present within the weld heat-affected zone (HAZ), the most vulnerable location governing the structural integrity of hydrogen transport pipelines. Heat treatments are tailored to obtain bulk specimens that replicate predominantly ferritic-bainitic, bainitic, and martensitic microstructures present in the HAZ. These are applied to a range of pipeline steels to investigate the role of manufacturing era (vintage versus modern), chemical composition, and grade. The heat treatments successfully reproduce the hardness levels and microstructures observed in the HAZ of existing natural gas pipelines. Subsequently, fracture experiments are conducted in air and pure H2 at 100 bar, revealing a reduced fracture resistance and higher hydrogen embrittlement susceptibility of the HAZ microstructures, with initiation toughness values as low as 32 MPa$\sqrt{\text{m}}$. The findings emphasise the need to adequately consider the influence of microstructure and hard, brittle zones within the HAZ.

Title: Witnessing Short- and Long-Range Nonstabilizerness via the Information Lattice
Authors: Yuliya Bilinskaya, Miguel F. Martínez, Soumi Ghosh, Thomas Klein Kvorning, Claudia Artiaco, Jens H. Bardarson
Abstract: We study nonstabilizerness on the information lattice, and demonstrate that noninteger local information directly indicates nonstabilizerness. For states with a clear separation of short- and large-scale information, noninteger total information at large scales $\Gamma$ serves as a witness of long-range nonstabilizerness. We propose a folding procedure to separate the global and edge-to-edge contributions to $\Gamma$. As an example we show that the ferromagnetic ground state of the spin-1/2 three-state Potts model has long-range nonstabilizerness originating from global correlations, while the paramagnetic ground state has at most short-range nonstabilizerness.

Title: Digitized Counterdiabatic Quantum Sampling

Abstract: We propose digitized counterdiabatic quantum sampling (DCQS), a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for efficient sampling from energy-based models, such as low-temperature Boltzmann distributions. The method utilizes counterdiabatic protocols, which suppress non-adiabatic transitions, with an iterative bias-field procedure that progressively steers the sampling toward low-energy regions. We observe that the samples obtained at each iteration correspond to approximate Boltzmann distributions at effective temperatures. By aggregating these samples and applying classical reweighting, the method reconstructs the Boltzmann distribution at a desired temperature. We define a scalable performance metric, based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence and the total variation distance, to quantify convergence toward the exact Boltzmann distribution. DCQS is validated on one-dimensional Ising models with random couplings up to 124 qubits, where exact results are available through transfer-matrix methods. We then apply it to a higher-order spin-glass Hamiltonian with 156 qubits executed on IBM quantum processors. We show that classical sampling algorithms, including Metropolis-Hastings and the state-of-the-art low-temperature technique parallel tempering, require up to three orders of magnitude more samples to match the quality of DCQS, corresponding to an approximately 2x runtime advantage. Boltzmann sampling underlies applications ranging from statistical physics to machine learning, yet classical algorithms exhibit exponentially slow convergence at low temperatures. Our results thus demonstrate a robust route toward scalable and efficient Boltzmann sampling on current quantum processors.

Title: Wavefront Curvature and Transverse Atomic Motion in Time-Resolved Atom Interferometry: Impact and Mitigation
Authors: Noam Mouelle, Jeremiah Mitchell, Valerie Gibson, Ulrich Schneider
Abstract: Time-resolved atom interferometry, as employed in applications such as gravitational wave detection and searches for ultra-light dark matter, requires precise control over systematic effects. In this work, we investigate phase noise arising from shot-to-shot fluctuations in the atoms' transverse motion in the presence of the wavefront curvature of the interferometer beam, and analyse its dependence on the laser-beam geometry in long-baseline, large-momentum-transfer atom interferometers. We use a semi-classical framework to derive analytical expressions for the effective phase perturbation in position-averaged measurements and validate them using Monte Carlo simulations. Applied to 100-m and 1-km atom gradiometers representative of next-generation experiments, the model shows that configurations maximizing pulse efficiency also amplify curvature-induced phase noise, requiring micron-level control of the atom cloud's centre-of-mass position and sub-micron-per-second control of its centre-of-mass velocity to achieve sub-$10^{-5}$ rad phase stability. Alternative beam geometries can suppress this noise by up to two orders of magnitude, but at the cost of reduced pulse efficiency. To address this limitation, we propose a mitigation strategy based on position-resolved phase-shift readout, which empirically learns and corrects the wavefront-induced bias from measurable quantities such as the phase-shift gradient and final cloud position. This approach restores high-sensitivity operation in the maximum-pulse-efficiency configuration without detailed beam characterisation, providing a practical route towards next-generation, time-resolved atom interferometers operating at the $10^{-5}$ rad noise level.

Title: Approximate quantum error correction, eigenstate thermalization and the chaos bound
Authors: Shozab Qasim, Jason Pollack
Abstract: Quantum error correction, thermalization, and quantum chaos are fundamental aspects of quantum many-body physics that have each developed largely independently, despite their deep conceptual overlap. In this work, we establish a precise link between all three in systems that satisfy the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) and exhibit a well-defined hierarchy of time scales between dissipation and scrambling. Building on the ETH matrix ansatz and the structure of the out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC), we show that the chaos bound directly constrains the error of an approximate quantum error-correcting code. This establishes a quantitative relation between information scrambling, thermalization, and correctability. Furthermore, we derive bounds on dynamical fluctuations around the infinite-time average and on fluctuation-dissipation relations, expressed in terms of both the code error and the Lyapunov exponent. Our results reveal how the limits of quantum chaos constrain information preservation in thermalizing quantum systems.

Title: Perfect Particle Transmission through Duality Defects
Authors: Atsushi Ueda, Vic Vander Linden, Laurens Lootens, Jutho Haegeman, Paul Fendley, Frank Verstraete
Abstract: We study wavepackets that propagate across (a) topological interfaces in quantum spin systems exhibiting non-invertible symmetries and (b) duality defects coupling dual theories. We demonstrate that the transmission is always perfect, and that a particle traversing the interface is converted into a nonlocal string-like excitation. We give a systematic way of constructing such a defect by identifying its Hilbert space with the virtual bond dimension of the matrix product operator representing defect lines. Our work both gives an operational meaning to topological interfaces, and provides a lattice analogue of recent results solving the monopole paradox in quantum field theory.

Title: Learning Pseudorandom Numbers with Transformers: Permuted Congruential Generators, Curricula, and Interpretability
Authors: Tao Tao, Maissam Barkeshli
Abstract: We study the ability of Transformer models to learn sequences generated by Permuted Congruential Generators (PCGs), a widely used family of pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs). PCGs introduce substantial additional difficulty over linear congruential generators (LCGs) by applying a series of bit-wise shifts, XORs, rotations and truncations to the hidden state. We show that Transformers can nevertheless successfully perform in-context prediction on unseen sequences from diverse PCG variants, in tasks that are beyond published classical attacks. In our experiments we scale moduli up to $2^{22}$ using up to $50$ million model parameters and datasets with up to $5$ billion tokens. Surprisingly, we find even when the output is truncated to a single bit, it can be reliably predicted by the model. When multiple distinct PRNGs are presented together during training, the model can jointly learn them, identifying structures from different permutations. We demonstrate a scaling law with modulus $m$: the number of in-context sequence elements required for near-perfect prediction grows as $\sqrt{m}$. For larger moduli, optimization enters extended stagnation phases; in our experiments, learning moduli $m \geq 2^{20}$ requires incorporating training data from smaller moduli, demonstrating a critical necessity for curriculum learning. Finally, we analyze embedding layers and uncover a novel clustering phenomenon: the model spontaneously groups the integer inputs into bitwise rotationally-invariant clusters, revealing how representations can transfer from smaller to larger moduli.

Title: Collective epithelial migration mediated by the unbinding of hexatic defects
Authors: Dimitrios Krommydas, Livio Nicola Carenza, Luca Giomi
Abstract: Collective cell migration in epithelia relies on cell intercalation: a local remodelling of the cellular network that allows neighbouring cells to swap their positions. Unlike foams and passive cellular fluid, in epithelial intercalation these rearrangements crucially depend on activity. During these processes, the local geometry of the network and the contractile forces generated therein conspire to produce a burst of remodelling events, which collectively give rise to a vortical flow at the mesoscopic length scale. In this article we formulate a continuum theory of the mechanism driving this process, built upon recent advances towards understanding the hexatic (i.e. $6-$fold ordered) structure of epithelial layers. Using a combination of active hydrodynamics and cell-resolved numerical simulations, we demonstrate that cell intercalation takes place via the unbinding of topological defects, naturally initiated by fluctuations and whose late-times dynamics is governed by the interplay between passive attractive forces and active self-propulsion. Our approach sheds light on the structure of the cellular forces driving collective migration in epithelia and provides an explanation of the observed extensile activity of in vitro epithelial layers.

Title: Controlling the Exchange Field of Surface Spin Impurities via DC Voltages
Authors: Xue Zhang, Jose Reina-Gálvez, Di'an Wu, Jan Martinek, Andreas J. Heinrich, Taeyoung Choi, Christoph Wolf
Abstract: Recent advances in scanning tunneling microscopy have enabled quantum-coherent control of single surface spins via all-electric electron spin resonance (ESR). Such control requires magnetoelectric coupling, since spin resonance is a magnetic effect. We show that a magnetic tip induces a bias-dependent exchange field on a localized Anderson impurity via virtual particle exchange with the magnetic lead. This field differs from Heisenberg exchange and can be tuned, reversed, or suppressed by the bias voltage. Our model reproduces bias-controlled resonance shifts for S = 1/2 titanium atoms and Fe(II) phthalocyanine, enabling spin control via the exchange field and revealing the magnetoelectric mechanism behind all-electric ESR for spin-based quantum technologies.

Title: A tractable thermodynamic framework linking the condensed ground state to displacive ferroelectric phase transitions
Authors: F. Yang, L. Q. Chen
Abstract: Quantitative description of finite-temperature properties of displacive ferroelectrics, and in particular the critical behavior, is of fundamental importance to both theory and device design, going beyond the Landau-Ginzburg approach, which requires known knowledge of critical behaviors and temperature-dependent parameter fitting. Here within quantum statistic description of quasiparticles, we develop a self-consistent, microscopically based phase-transition framework, by concerning the bosonic condensation of the unstable phonons and treating the emerging collective vectorial polar mode. It enables one to use only the ground-state properties to predict the finite-temperature properties and in particular, the criticality of phase transitions of displacive ferroelectricity. Its applications to the classical ferroelectric PbTiO$_3$, quantum paraelectrics SrTiO$_3$ and KTaO$_3$, and recently fabricated ferroelectric strained SrTiO$_3$, demonstrate remarkable quantitative agreements with the experimentally measured dielectric/ferroelectric properties throughout the entire temperature ranges of the phases, including the critical behaviors of phase transitions. The framework provides a tractable basis to understand and quantitatively describe a wide range of phase transitions across ferroelectric systems under different thermodynamic or external conditions.

Title: Metamaterials that learn to change shape
Authors: Yao Du, Ryan van Mastrigt, Jonas Veenstra, Corentin Coulais
Abstract: Learning to change shape is a fundamental strategy of adaptation and evolution of living organisms, from bacteria and cells to tissues and animals. Human-made materials can also exhibit advanced shape morphing capabilities, but lack the ability to learn. Here, we build metamaterials that can learn complex shape-changing responses using a contrastive learning scheme. By being shown examples of the target shape changes, our metamaterials are able to learn those shape changes by progressively updating internal learning degrees of freedom -- the local stiffnesses. Unlike traditional materials that are designed once and for all, our metamaterials have the ability to forget and learn new shape changes in sequence, to learn multiple shape changes that break reciprocity, and to learn multistable shape changes, which in turn allows them to perform reflex gripping actions and locomotion. Our findings establish metamaterials as an exciting platform for physical learning, which in turn opens avenues for the use of physical learning to design adaptive materials and robots.

Title: Rheological response of soft Solid/Liquid Composites
Authors: Elina Gilbert, Christophe Poulard, Anniina Salonen
Abstract: Understanding a material's dissipative response is important for their use in many applications, such as adhesion or fracture resistance. In dispersions, the interplay between matrix and inclusions complicates any description. Fractional rheology is conveniently used to fit the storage and loss moduli of complex materials. In conjugation with superposition methods, they allow to better capture the behavior of materials of complex rheology. We study the rheology of soft solid/liquid composites of liquid poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) droplets in a soft poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) matrix. We analyze the influence of the droplets through fractional rheology and a time-concentration superposition in the continuous-phase-dominated region. Viscous dissipation increases proportionally with volume fraction, independently of the frequency, whereas the elastic response is almost unchanged.

Title: Accurate predictive model of band gap with selected important features based on explainable machine learning
Authors: Joohwi Lee, Kaito Miyamoto
Abstract: In the rapidly advancing field of materials informatics, nonlinear machine learning models have demonstrated exceptional predictive capabilities for material properties. However, their black-box nature limits interpretability, and they may incorporate features that do not contribute to, or even deteriorate, model performance. This study employs explainable ML (XML) techniques, including permutation feature importance and the SHapley Additive exPlanation, applied to a pristine support vector regression model designed to predict band gaps at the GW level using 18 input features. Guided by XML-derived individual feature importance, a simple framework is proposed to construct reduced-feature predictive models. Model evaluations indicate that an XML-guided compact model, consisting of the top five features, achieves comparable accuracy to the pristine model on in-domain datasets (0.254 vs. 0.247 eV) while demonstrating superior generalization with lower prediction errors on out-of-domain data (0.461 vs. 0.341 eV). Additionally, the study underscores the necessity for eliminating strongly correlated features (correlation coefficient greater than 0.8) to prevent misinterpretation and overestimation of feature importance before applying XML. This study highlights XML's effectiveness in developing simplified yet highly accurate machine learning models by clarifying feature roles, thereby reducing computational costs for feature acquisition and enhancing model trustworthiness for materials discovery.

Title: Flux attachment theory of fractional excitonic insulators
Authors: Steven Gassner, Ady Stern, C. L. Kane
Abstract: The search for fractional quantized Hall phases in the absence of a magnetic field has primarily targeted flat-band systems that mimic the features of a Landau level. In an alternative approach, the fractional excitonic insulator (FEI) has been proposed as a correlated electron-hole fluid that arises near a band inversion between bands of different angular momentum with strong interactions. It remains an interesting challenge to find Hamiltonians with realistic interactions that stabilize this state. Here, we describe composite boson and composite fermion theories that highlight the importance of $(p_x+ip_y)^m$ excitonic pairing in stabilizing FEIs in a class of band inversion models. We predict a sequence of Jain-like and Laughlin-like FEI states, the simplest of which has the topological order of the bosonic $\nu=1/2$ fractional quantized Hall state. We discuss implications for recent numerical studies on a chiral spin liquid phase in interacting Chern insulator models.

Title: Minimal mechanism for flocking in phoretically interacting active particles
Authors: Arvin Gopal Subramaniam, Sagarika Adhikary, Rajesh Singh
Abstract: Coherent collective motion is a widely observed phenomenon in active matter systems. Here, we report a flocking transition mechanism in a system of chemically interacting active colloidal particles sustained purely by chemo-repulsive torques at low to medium densities. The basic requirements to maintain the global polar order are excluded volume repulsions and long-ranged repulsive torques. This mechanism requires that the time scale individual colloids move a unit length to be dominant with respect to the time they deterministically respond to chemical gradients, or equivalently, pair colloids sliding together a minimal unit length before deterministically rotating away from each other. Switching on the translational repulsive forces renders the flock a crystalline structure. Furthermore, liquid flocks are observed for a range of chemo-attractive inter-particle forces. Various properties of these two distinct flocking phases are contrasted and discussed. We complement these results with stability analysis of a hydrodynamic model, which admits the transition corresponding to destabilization of the flocking state observed in particle-based simulations.

Title: Persistent Homology-Based Indicator of Orientational Ordering in Two-Dimensional Quasi-Particle Systems Applied to Skyrmion Lattices
Authors: Michiki Taniwaki, Thomas Brian Winkler, Jan Rothörl, Raphael Gruber, Chiharu Mitsumata, Masato Kotsugi, Mathias Kläui
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) particle systems, such as magnetic skyrmions, exhibit topological phase transitions between unique 2D phases. However, a simple and computationally efficient methodology to capture lattice configurational properties and construct an appropriate, easily calculable descriptor for phase identification remains elusive. Here, we propose an indicator for topological phase transitions using persistent homology (PH). PH offers novel insights beyond conventional indicators by capturing topological features derived from the configurational properties of the lattice. The proposed persistent-homology-based indicator, which selectively counts stable features in a persistence diagram, effectively traces the lattice's ordering changes, as confirmed by comparisons with the conventionally used measure of the ordering (the magnitude of the orientational order parameter $\langle|\Psi_6|\rangle$), typically used to identify lattice phases. We demonstrate the applicability of our indicator to experimental data, showing that it yields results consistent with those of simulations. This experimental validation highlights the robustness of the proposed method for real physical systems beyond idealized simulated systems. While our method is demonstrated in the context of skyrmion lattice systems, the approach is general and can be extended to other two-dimensional systems composed of interacting particles. As a key advantage, our indicator offers lower computational complexity than the conventionally used measures.

Title: Dressed basis sets for the modeling of exchange interactions in double quantum dots
Authors: Mauricio J. Rodríguez, Esteban A. Rodríguez-Mena, Ahmad Fouad Kalo, Yann-Michel Niquet
Abstract: We discuss the microscopic modeling of exchange interactions between double semiconductor quantum dots used as spin qubits. Starting from a reference full configuration interaction (CI) calculation for the two-particle wave functions, we build a reduced basis set of dressed states that can describe the ground-state singlets and triplets over the whole operational range with as few as one hundred basis functions (as compared to a few thousands for the full CI). This enables fast explorations of the exchange interactions landscape as well as efficient time-dependent simulations. We apply this methodology to a double hole quantum dot in germanium, and discuss the physics of exchange interactions in this system. We show that the net exchange splitting results from a complex interplay between inter-dot tunneling, Coulomb exchange and correlations. We analyze, moreover, the effects of confinement, strains and Rashba interactions on the anisotropic exchange and singlet-triplet mixings at finite magnetic field. We finally illustrate the relevance of this methodology for time-dependent calculations on a singlet-triplet qubit.

Title: Shubnikov-de Haas Oscillations in 2D $\text{PtSe}_2$: A fermiological Charge Carrier Investigation
Authors: Julian Max Salchegger, Rajdeep Adhikari, Bogdan Faina, Alberta Bonanni
Abstract: High magnetic field and low temperature transport is carried out in order to characterize the charge carriers of $\text{PtSe}_2$. In particular, the Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations arising at applied magnetic field strengths $\gtrsim 4.5\,\text{T}$ are found to occur exclusively in plane and emerge at a layer thickness of $\approx 18\,\text{nm}$, increasing in amplitude and decreasing in frequency for thinner $\text{PtSe}_2$ flakes. Moreover, the quantum transport time, Berry phase, Dingle temperature and cyclotron mass of the charge carriers are ascertained. The emergence of weak antilocalization (WAL) lies in contrast to the presence of magnetic moments from Pt vacancies. An explanation is provided on how WAL and the Kondo effect can be observed within the same material. Detailed information about the charge carriers and transport phenomena in $\text{PtSe}_2$ is obtained, which is relevant for the design of prospective spintronic and orbitronic devices and for the realization of orbital Hall effect-based architectures.

Title: Cooperative ligand-mediated transitions in simple macromolecules

Abstract: In biology, ligand mediated transitions (LMT), where the binding of a molecular ligand onto the binding site of a receptor molecule leads to a well-defined change in the conformation of the receptor, are often referred to as 'the second secret of life'. Sharp, cooperative transitions arise in many biological cases, while examples of synthetic cooperative systems are rare. This is because well-defined conformational states are hard to 'program' into a molecular design. Here, we impose an external constraint in the form of two immiscible liquids that effectively define and limit the available conformational states of two different synthetic and relatively simple macromolecules. We show that the mechanism of the observed cooperative transitions with ligand concentration is the coupling of ligand binding and conformation, similar to more complex biological systems. The systems studied are: (1) Hydrophobic polyelectrolytes (HPE), which are (bio) polymers that consist of hydrophobic as well as ionizable (proton and hydroxyl ligand-binding) functional groups. (2) Oligomeric metal chelators (OMC), which are oligomers composed of metal ion chelating repeating groups that are able to bind metal ions (considered as the 'ligands'), resulting in gel-like networks of oligomers crosslinked by coordinated metal ions. We find that in HPE, interactions between ligands and individual macromolecules explain the observed cooperative transitions. For OMC, coordinated bonds significantly enhance the degree of cooperativity, compared to HPE.

Title: Critical ageing correlators from Schrödinger-invariance
Authors: Malte Henkel, Stoimen Stoimenov
Abstract: For ageing systems, quenched onto a critical temperature $T=T_c$ such that the dominant noise comes from the thermal bath, with a non-conserved order-parameter and in addition with dynamical exponent ${z}=2$, the form of the two-time auto-correlator as well as the time-space form of the single-time correlator are derived from Schrödinger-invariance, generalised to non-equilibrium ageing. These findings reproduce the exact results in the $1D$ Glauber-Ising model at $T=0$ and the critical spherical model in $d>2$ dimensions.

Title: Reply to the Comment on "Shell-Shaped Quantum Droplet in a Three-Component Ultracold Bose Gas"
Authors: Yinfeng Ma, Xiaoling Cui
Abstract: In our Letter (Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 043402 (2025)), we proposed a self-bound shell-shaped BEC in a three-component ($1,2,3$) Bose gas, where $(2,3)$ and $(1,2)$ droplets are linked as core-shell structure. A recent Comment (Ancilotto, 2505.16554) argued that a ``dimer" configuration should be instead the ground state, where $(2,3)$ and $(1,2)$ stay side-by-side. Moreover, Ancilotto also explored the state formation, finding that a naive trap-release protocol was unable to produce the core-shell structure. In this reply we show that our core-shell structure is an excited state for finite-size systems, while it becomes energetically degenerate with dimer configuration in thermodynamic limit. Furthermore, we find the core-shell structure is locally stable under external perturbations, and if one pays careful attention to mode-matching, a trap-release protocol can well produce this structure.

Title: Hierarchical Topological States without Dimension Reduction
Authors: Joel R. Pyfrom, Kai Sun, Jihong A. Ma
Abstract: Topological insulators exhibit boundary states protected by bulk band topology, a principle first established in quantum systems and later extended to classical waves, including phononics. Conventionally, an $n$-dimensional bulk with nontrivial topology hosts $(n-1)$-dimensional topologically protected boundary states, which may be further gapped out by breaking the symmetry that protects them, potentially leading to the emergence of $(n-2)$-dimensional, or even lower-dimensional topological states, as in higher-order topological insulators. In this work, we introduce an alternative mechanism for gapping out topological states and forming new topological modes within the resulting gap without further unit-cell symmetry breaking or dimension reduction. Using one- and two-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) models, we show that controlled repositioning of topological domain walls enables the construction of hierarchical unit cells that gap out the original domain-wall states while preserving the underlying symmetry. This process produces higher-hierarchical-level topological states, characterized by a generalized winding number, and can be iterated to realize multiple - potentially infinite - hierarchical levels of topological states. Our approach expands the conventional topological classification and offers a versatile route for engineering complex networks of protected modes in higher dimensions.

Title: Scaling up the transcorrelated density matrix renormalization group
Authors: Benjamin Corbett, Akimasa Miyake
Abstract: Explicitly correlated methods, such as the transcorrelated method which shifts a Jastrow or Gutzwiller correlator from the wave function to the Hamiltonian, are designed for high-accuracy calculations of electronic structures, but their application to larger systems has been hampered by the computational cost. We develop improved techniques for the transcorrelated density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), in which the ground state of the transcorrelated Hamiltonian is represented as a matrix product state (MPS), and demonstrate large-scale calculations of the ground-state energy of the two-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model. Our developments stem from three technical inventions: (i) constructing matrix product operators (MPO) of transcorrelated Hamiltonians with low bond dimension and high sparsity, (ii) exploiting the entanglement structure of the ground states to increase the accuracy of the MPS representation, and (iii) optimizing the non-linear parameter of the Gutzwiller correlator to mitigate the non-variational nature of the transcorrelated method. We examine systems of size up to $12 \times 12$ lattice sites, four times larger than previous transcorrelated DMRG studies, and demonstrate that transcorrelated DMRG yields significant improvements over standard non-transcorrelated DMRG for equivalent computational effort. Transcorrelated DMRG reduces the error of the ground state energy by $3\times$-$17 \times$, with the smallest improvement seen for a small system at half-filling and the largest improvement in a dilute closed-shell system.

Title: Impurity immersed in a two-component few-fermion mixture in a one-dimensional harmonic trap
Authors: Marek Teske, Tomasz Sowiński
Abstract: We investigate a one-dimensional three-component few-fermion mixture confined in a parabolic external trap, where one component contains a single particle acting as an impurity. Focusing on the many-body ground state, we analyze how the interactions between the impurity and the other components influence the system's structure. For fixed interaction strengths within the mixture, we identify a critical interaction strength with the impurity for which the system undergoes a structural transition characterized by a substantial change in its spatial features. We explore this transition from the point of view of correlations and ground-state susceptibility. We remarkably find that this transition exhibits unique universality features not previously observed in other systems, highlighting novel many-body properties existing in multi-component fermionic mixtures.

Title: Ginzburg-Landau theory for unconventional surface superconductivity in PtBi$_2$
Authors: Harald Waje, Fabian Jakubczyk, Jeroen van den Brink, Carsten Timm
Abstract: Recent experimental evidence suggests the presence of an unconventional, nodal surface-su\-per\-con\-duc\-ting state in trigonal PtBi\textsubscript{2}. We construct a Ginzburg--Landau theory for the three superconducting order parameters, which correspond to the three irreducible representations of the point group $C_{3v}$. The irreducible representations $A_1$ and $A_2$ are the most likely. We develop a systematic method to determine the symmetry-allowed terms and apply it to derive all terms up to fourth order in the three order parameters. The Ginzburg--Landau functional also includes coupling to the magnetic field. The functional is employed to determine the effect of an applied uniform magnetic field on the nodal structure for $A_1$ and $A_2$ pairing. The results facilitate clear-cut experimental differentiation between these symmetries. We also predict field-induced helical superconductivity.

Title: A physics-informed neural network for modeling fracture without gradient damage: formulation, application, and assessment
Authors: Aditya Konale, Vikas Srivastava
Abstract: Accurate computational modeling of damage and fracture remains a central challenge in solid mechanics. The finite element method (FEM) is widely used for numerical modeling of fracture problems; however, classical damage models without gradient regularization yield mesh-dependent and usually inaccurate predictions. The use of gradient damage with FEM improves numerical robustness but introduces significant mathematical and numerical implementation complexities. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) can encode the governing partial differential equations, boundary conditions, and constitutive models into the loss functions, offering a new method for fracture modeling. Prior applications of PINNs have been limited to small-strain problems and have incorporated gradient damage formulation without a critical evaluation of its necessity. Since PINNs in their basic form are meshless, this work presents a PINN framework for modeling fracture in elastomers undergoing large deformation without the gradient damage formulation. The PINN implementation here does not require training data and utilizes the collocation method to formulate physics-informed loss functions. We have validated the PINN's predictions for various defect configurations using benchmark solutions obtained from FEM with gradient damage formulation. The crack paths obtained using the PINN are approximately insensitive to the collocation point distribution. This study offers new insights into the feasibility of using PINNs without gradient damage and suggests a simplified and efficient computational modeling strategy for fracture problems. The PINN's performance has been evaluated through systematic variations in key neural network parameters to provide an assessment and guidance for future applications. The results motivate the extension of PINN-based approaches to a broader class of materials and damage models in mechanics.

Title: Collective Fluorescence of Graphene Quantum Dots on a surface

Abstract: This study explores the organization of graphene quantum dots on the surface of monocrystalline halide perovskite. We show that graphene quantum dots tends to aggregate on the surface of perovskite unlike in solution or on other substrates, even at very low concentration of the initial solution that should yield single-molecule samples. Spectral analysis on small clusters shows a back-and-forth dynamical transition between an uncoupled, monomer-like state, and an excimer state. Following this "dance" between states, a drastic one-way increase in fluorescence intensity combined with a shortening of the excited state lifetime has been observed on some clusters. This behavior is related to the emission of a collective state that may be a consequence of the dynamical organization of graphene quantum dots under illumination on the surface of the perovksite.

Title: Observation of spin-conserving two-spinon continuum in the $S$=1/2 antiferromagnetic chain system Sr$_2$CuO$_3$ using Cu $K$-edge resonant inelastic x-ray scattering
Authors: Kenji Ishii, Kenji Tsutsui, Takayuki Kawamata, Yoji Koike
Abstract: We report a Cu $K$-edge resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) study of spin excitations in the $S$=1/2 antiferromagnetic chain system Sr$_2$CuO$_3$. The spectral weight observed below the charge-transfer gap appears in two-spinon continuum, indicating the fractionalization of a spin-conserving ($\Delta S = 0$) magnetic excitation into two-spinon states. The intensity of these excitations reaches a maximum near the midpoint between the center and the boundary of the Brillouin zone, and decreases toward the zone boundary; this behavior contrasts with that of the spin-flip ($\Delta S = 1$) excitations typically observed via inelastic neutron scattering or Cu $L_3$-edge RIXS. The momentum dependence of the intensity is described by the spin-exchange dynamical structure factor. A phenomenological analysis of the symmetry between the polarization and the $d$ orbital explains the resonance condition for the two-spinon excitations.

Title: Quantum Bipolar Thermoelectricity
Authors: Filippo Antola, Giorgio De Simoni, Francesco Giazotto, Alessandro Braggio
Abstract: Thermoelectricity is generally understood as a classical effect emerging from energy-dependent transport asymmetries. Here we uncover a purely quantum mechanism, where a superconducting S-I-S' tunnel junction in thermal equilibrium develops a nonlinear bipolar thermoelectric response owing to the dynamical Coulomb blockade and the emission-absorption imbalance of a cold electromagnetic bath. Two representative environments are analysed, revealing Seebeck coefficients up to 100 $\mu$V/K for realistic junction parameters. Because the response directly reflects the spectral properties of the surrounding environment, our results suggest that bipolar quantum thermoelectricity could provide a new route for spectroscopic sensing of electromagnetic modes and for designing low-temperature thermoelectric devices with environmentally engineered performance.

Title: Extending Sample Persistence Variable Reduction for Constrained Combinatorial Optimization Problems
Authors: Shunta Ide, Shuta Kikuchi, Shu Tanaka
Abstract: Constrained combinatorial optimization problems (CCOPs) are challenging to solve due to the exponential growth of the solution space. When tackled with Ising machines, constraints are typically enforced by the penalty function method, whose coefficients must be carefully tuned to balance feasibility and objective quality. Variable-reduction techniques such as sample persistence variable reduction (SPVAR) can mitigate hardware limitations of Ising machines, yet their behavior on CCOPs remains insufficiently understood. Building on our prior proposal, we extend and comprehensively evaluate multi-penalty SPVAR (MP-SPVAR), which fixes variables using solution persistence aggregated across multiple penalty coefficients. Experiments on benchmark problems, including the quadratic assignment problem and the quadratic knapsack problem, demonstrate that MP-SPVAR attains higher feasible-solution ratios while matching or improving approximation ratios relative to the conventional SPVAR algorithm. An examination of low-energy states under small penalties clarifies when feasibility degrades and how encoding choices affect the trade-off between solution quality and feasibility. These results position MP-SPVAR as a practical variable-reduction strategy for CCOPs and lay a foundation for systematic penalty tuning, broader problem classes, and integration with quantum-inspired optimization hardware as well as quantum algorithms.

Title: Renormalization of Interacting Random Graph Models
Authors: Alessio Catanzaro, Diego Garlaschelli, Subodh P. Patil
Abstract: Random graphs offer a useful mathematical representation of a variety of real world complex networks. Exponential random graphs, for example, are particularly suited towards generating random graphs constrained to have specified statistical moments. In this investigation, we elaborate on a generalization of the former where link probabilities are conditioned on the appearance of other links, corresponding to the introduction of interactions in an effective generalized statistical mechanical formalism. When restricted to the simplest non-trivial case of pairwise interactions, one can derive a closed form renormalization group transformation for maximum coordination number two on the corresponding line graph. Higher coordination numbers do not admit exact closed form renormalization group transformations, a feature that paraphrases the usual absence of exact transformations in two or more dimensional lattice systems. We introduce disorder and study the induced renormalization group flow on its probability assignments, highlighting its formal equivalence to time reversed anisotropic drift-diffusion on the statistical manifold associated with the effective Hamiltonian. We discuss the implications of our findings, stressing the long wavelength irrelevance of certain classes of pair-wise conditioning on random graphs, and conclude with possible applications. These include modeling the scaling behavior of preferential effects on social networks, opinion dynamics, and reinforcement effects on neural networks, as well as how our findings offer a systematic framework to deal with data limitations in inference and reconstruction problems.

Title: A nonequilibrium distribution for stochastic thermodynamics
Authors: Jean-Luc Garden
Abstract: The canonical distribution of Gibbs is extended to the case of systems outside equilibrium. The distribution of probabilities of a discrete energy levels system is used to provide a microscopic definition of work, along with a microscopic definition of the uncompensated heat of Clausius involved in nonequilibrium processes. The later is related to the presence of non-conservatives forces with regards to the variation of the external parameters. This new framework is used to investigate the nonequilibrium relations in stochastic thermodynamics. A new relation is derived for the random quantity of heat associated to the nonequilibrium work protocol. We finally show that the distributions of probabilities of work, heat and uncompensated heat are non-independent each other during a nonequilibrium process.

Title: Unconventional criticality in $O(D)$-invariant loop-constrained Landau theory
Authors: Svitlana Kondovych, Asle Sudbø, Flavio S. Nogueira
Abstract: We study an unconventional phase transition in ferroelectrics where the polarization field is constrained to be divergence-free, allowing only loop-like configurations. This local constraint fundamentally alters the critical behavior, driving the system beyond the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson paradigm. A renormalization group analysis shows that the polarization acquires an unusually large anomalous dimension, $\eta\approx 0.239$ in three dimensions, far exceeding the typical values in $O(3)$-invariant systems. We attribute this effect to an emergent gauge symmetry originating from the zero divergence constraint. Such gauge-field behavior is reminiscent of fractionalized phases, revealing a fundamental connection between constrained ferroelectrics and emergent gauge phenomena in correlated matter.

Title: Temperature Dependence of the Momentum-Resolved Static Spin Susceptibility in a Mott-Proximate Cuprate Model
Authors: Keishichiro Tanaka
Abstract: This paper presents the temperature dependence of the static spin susceptibility at $\mathbf{q} = (\pi, \pi)$ and $\mathbf{q} = (\pi, 0)$ in a Mott-proximate cuprate model with an antinodal pseudogap -- a model system for high-temperature superconducting (HTSC) cuprates. The results show the susceptibility onset temperature tracks the critical temperature ($T_c$) of HTSCs with a comparable scale across the electron filling factor. Also, as the electron filling decreases and the chemical potential approaches the antinodal van Hove region, the susceptibility at $\mathbf{q}=(\pi,0)$ -- the axial particle-hole response -- grows markedly. It suggests that the emergence of cuprate superconductivity correlates with a suppression of low-energy antinodal spin response and associated particle-hole excitations, which would otherwise dephase $d$-wave pairing, commonly attributed to spin fluctuations. In this context, the pseudogap partially suppresses antinodal spectral weight near $\omega = 0$, thereby reducing the low-$\omega$ particle-hole phase space.

Title: Ultralow-Cost magnetocaloric compound for Cryogenic Cooling
Authors: Wei Liu, Benjamin Theisel, Yulia Klunnikova, Konstantin Skokov, Oliver Gutfleisch
Abstract: Cost-effective materials are essential for large-scale deployment. The emerging magnetocaloric hydrogen liquefaction technology could transform the liquid hydrogen industry due to its potential in achieving higher efficiency. Most studies of the cryogenic magnetocaloric effect (MCE) have focused on resource-critical rare-earth-based compounds. Here we report on an ionic magnetocaloric compound FeCl$_2$ which is based on ultralow-cost elements, as a candidate working material for hydrogen liquefaction. FeCl$_2$ shows both inverse and conventional MCE. From 0 to 1.5 T, the inverse effect yields a positive magnetic entropy change ($\Delta S_T$) of about 5 J/kg/K near 20 K, then declines toward zero at higher fields. In contrast, the conventional (negative) response strengthens with field. The $\Delta S_T$ reaches 18.6 J/kg/K near 20 K in magnetic fields of 5 T. This value exceeds most light rare-earth-based compounds and approaches that of heavy rare-earth-based compounds. In magnetic fields of 5 T, the adiabatic temperature change reaches about 3.6 K. The large $\Delta S_T$, along with the low cost of the elements in FeCl$_2$, are prerequisites for inexpensive industrial-scale production, giving the prospect of a practical magnetocaloric candidate for hydrogen liquefaction in the 20 $\sim$ 77 K temperature window.

Title: dynsight: an Open Python Platform for Simulation and Experimental Trajectory Data Analysis
Authors: Simone Martino, Matteo Becchi, Andrew Tarzia, Daniele Rapetti, Giovanni M. Pavan
Abstract: The study of complex many-body systems via analysis of the trajectories of the units that dynamically move and interact within them is a non-trivial task. The workflow for extracting meaningful information from the raw trajectory data is often composed of a series of interconnected steps, such as, (i) identifying and tracking the constitutive objects/particles, resolving their trajectories (e.g., in experimental cases, where these are not automatically available as in typical molecular simulations), (ii) translating the trajectories into data that are easier to handle/analyze by using well suited descriptors, and (iii) extracting meaningful information from such data. Each of these different tasks often requires non-negligible programming skills, the use of various types of representations or methods, and the availability/development of an interface between them. Despite the considerable potential that new tools contributed to each of these individual steps, their integration under a common framework would decrease the barrier to usage (especially by diverse communities of users), avoid fragmentation, and ultimately facilitate the development of new approaches in data analysis. To this end, here we introduce dynsight, an open Python platform that streamlines the extraction and analysis of time-series data from simulation- or experimentally-resolved trajectories. dynsight simplifies workflows, enhances accessibility, and facilitates time-series and trajectories data analysis offering a useful tool to unraveling the dynamic complexity of a variety of systems (or signals) across different scales. dynsight is open source (this https URL) and can be easily installed using pip.

Title: Low-Gap Hf-HfOx-Hf Josephson Junctions for meV-Scale Particle Detection
Authors: Y. Balaji, M. Surendran, X. Li, A. Kemelbay, A. Gashi, C. Salemi, A. Suzuki, S. Aloni, A. Tynes Hammack, A. Schwartzberg
Abstract: Superconducting qubits have motivated the exploration of Josephson-junction technologies beyond quantum computing, with emerging applications in low-energy photon and phonon detection for astrophysics and dark matter searches. Achieving sensitivity at the THz (meV) scale requires materials with smaller superconducting gaps than those of conventional aluminum or niobium-based devices. Here, we report the fabrication and characterization of hafnium (Hf)-based Josephson junctions (Hf-HfOx-Hf), demonstrating Hf as a promising low-Tc material platform for ultra-low threshold single THz photon and single-phonon detection. Structural and chemical analyses reveal crystalline films and well-defined oxide barriers, while electrical transport measurements at both room and cryogenic temperatures exhibit clear Josephson behavior, enabling extraction of key junction parameters such as critical current, superconducting gap and normal-state resistance. This work presents the first comprehensive study of Hf-based junctions and their potential for next-generation superconducting detectors and qubit architectures leveraging low superconducting gap energies.

Title: Maximum Quantum Work at Criticality: Stirling Engines and Fibonacci-Lucas Degeneracies
Authors: Bastian Castorene, Martin HvE Groves, Francisco J. Peña, Eugenio E. Vogel, Patricio Vargas
Abstract: Many-body effects and quantum criticality play a central role in determining the performance of quantum thermal machines. Although operating near a quantum critical point (QCP) is known to enhance engine performance, the precise thermodynamic conditions required to attain the Carnot efficiency limit remain unsettled. Here, we derive the exact conditions for a quantum Stirling engine to achieve Carnot efficiency when a QCP drives its working medium. In the low-temperature regime, where only the ground-state manifold is populated, the net work output is given by $ W = k_B \delta \ln (g_{\text{crit}}/g_0) $ with $ \delta = T_H - T_L $, which directly yields the Carnot efficiency $ \eta_C = 1 - T_L/T_H $, independent of microscopic details. Notably, whereas ideal Stirling cycles attain Carnot efficiency only with a perfect regenerator, here no regenerator is required because, at low temperatures, the thermal population remains confined to the degenerate ground state; this represents a clear quantum advantage over engines with classical working substances. We validate this universal result by recovering known behaviors in various quantum systems, including spin chains with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions and magnetic anisotropies. Applying the framework to the one-dimensional antiferromagnetic Ising model, we predict non-extensive scaling of the work output governed by Fibonacci and Lucas numbers for open chains and closed rings, respectively, which converges to classical extensivity in the thermodynamic limit. This analysis establishes a general and robust foundation for designing quantum thermal machines that reach the Carnot bound while delivering finite work.

Title: Light-scattering reconstruction of transparent shapes using neural networks
Authors: Tymoteusz Miara, Draga Pihler-Puzović, Matthias Heil, Anne Juel
Abstract: The accurate characterisation of the 3D deformations of slender fibres and thin sheets in flow, is a key experimental challenge in the study of particle-laden flows. We propose a high-resolution, single-camera method to visualise non-intrusively the shape of a transparent crumpled sheet, as it translates, rotates and deforms. We perform periodic scans of the crumpled shape by illuminating it with a sequence of stacked light sheets at a rate much faster than its deformation and image the scattered light signal in a plane near-orthogonal to the plane of lighting. Processing of the data using a pinhole camera model yields a noisy spatio-temporal dataset of the strongly deformed time-evolving surface of the sheet, which we reconstruct in 3D using a neural autoencoder. We validate the robustness of the shape reconstruction algorithm to noise using synthetic data sets, and demonstrate the accurate reconstruction of laboratory sedimentation experiments with elastic disks. We find that the inclusion of isometricity-enforcing penalties into the cost function of the autoencoder enables us to robustly reconstruct highly folded shapes, where different regions of the sheet overlap.

Title: Micro-swimmer collective dynamics in Brinkman flows
Authors: Yasser Almoteri, Enkeleida Lushi
Abstract: Suspensions of swimming micro-organisms are known to undergo intricate collective dynamics as a result of hydrodynamic and collision interactions. Micro-swimmers, such as bacteria and micro-algae, naturally live and have evolved in complex habitats that include impurities, obstacles and interfaces. To elucidate their dynamics in a heterogeneous environment, we consider a continuum theory where the the micro-swimmers are embedded in a Brinkman wet porous medium, which models viscous flow with an additional resistance or friction due to the presence of smaller stationary obstacles. The conservation equation for the swimmer configurations includes advection and rotation by the immersing fluid, and is coupled to the viscous Brinkman fluid flow with an active stress due to the swimmers' motion in it. Resistance alters individual swimmer locomotion and the way it disturbs the surrounding fluid, and thus it alters its hydrodynamic interactions with others and and such affects collective this http URL entropy analysis and the linear stability analysis of the system of equations both reveal that resistance delays and hinders the onset and development of the collective swimming instabilities, and can completely suppress it if sufficiently large. Simulations of the full nonlinear system confirm these. We contrast the results with previous theoretical studies on micro-swimmers in homogeneous viscous flow, and discuss relevant experimental realizations.

Title: A New Framework for Quantum Phases in Open Systems: Steady State of Imaginary-Time Lindbladian Evolution
Authors: Yuchen Guo, Ke Ding, Shuo Yang
Abstract: This study delves into the concept of quantum phases in open quantum systems, examining the shortcomings of existing approaches that focus on steady states of Lindbladians and highlighting their limitations in capturing key phase transitions. In contrast to these methods, we introduce the concept of imaginary-time Lindbladian evolution as an alternative framework. This new approach defines gapped quantum phases in open systems through the spectrum properties of the imaginary-Liouville superoperator. We find that, in addition to all pure gapped ground states, the Gibbs state of a stabilizer Hamiltonian at any finite temperature can also be characterized by our scheme, demonstrated through explicit construction. Moreover, the closing of the imaginary Liouville gap is associated with the divergence of the Markov length, which has recently been proposed as an indicator of phase transitions in open quantum systems. To illustrate the effectiveness of this framework, we apply it to investigate the phase diagram for open systems with $\mathbb{Z}_2^{\sigma}\times \mathbb{Z}_2^{\tau}$ symmetry, including cases with nontrivial average symmetry protected topological order or spontaneous symmetry breaking order. Our findings demonstrate universal properties at quantum criticality, such as nonanalytic behaviors of steady-state observables, divergence of correlation lengths, and closing of the imaginary-Liouville gap. These results advance our understanding of quantum phase transitions in open quantum systems. In contrast, we find that the steady states of real-time Lindbladians do not provide an effective framework for characterizing phase transitions in open systems.

Title: Transport in a System with a Tower of Quantum Many-Body Scars
Authors: Gianluca Morettini, Luca Capizzi, Maurizio Fagotti, Leonardo Mazza
Abstract: We report the observation of unconventional transport phenomena in a spin-1 model that supports a tower of quantum many-body scars, and we discuss their properties uncovering their peculiar nature. In quantum many-body systems, the late-time dynamics of local observables are typically governed by conserved operators with local densities, such as energy and magnetization. In the model under investigation, however, there is an additional dynamical symmetry restricted to the subspace of the Hilbert space spanned by the quantum many-body scars. The latter significantly slows the decay of autocorrelation functions of certain coherent states of quantum many-body scars and is responsible for the unconventional form of transport that we detect numerically. We show that excited states with energy close to that of the quantum many-body scars play a crucial role in sustaining the transport. Finally, we propose a generalized eigenstate thermalization hypothesis to describe specific properties of states with energy close to the scars.

Title: Note on surface defects in multiscalar critical models
Authors: Andrii Anataichuk, Sabine Harribey
Abstract: This paper studies generic surface defects for multiscalar critical models using a perturbative $\epsilon$ expansion in $4-\epsilon$ dimensions. The beta functions of the defect couplings for a generic multiscalar bulk with quartic interactions are computed at first non-trivial order in $\epsilon$. Specific bulks of interest are then considered: $O(N)$, hypercubic, hypertetrahdral, and biconical $O(m)\times O(n)$. In each case, we compute fixed points for the defect couplings and determine the remaining bulk symmetry. Expanding beyond the $O(N)$ model, we find a greater variety of patterns of symmetry breaking.

Title: Scaling active spaces in simulations of surface reactions through sample-based quantum diagonalization
Authors: Marco Antonio Barroca, Tanvi Gujarati, Vidushi Sharma, Rodrigo Neumann Barros Ferreira, Young-Hye Na, Maxwell Giammona, Antonio Mezzacapo, Benjamin Wunsch, Mathias Steiner
Abstract: Quantum-chemical simulations are essential for predicting energies of chemical reactions. Accurately solving the many-body Schrödinger equation for reagent and product states of most relevant chemical process is, however, unfeasible. Quantum computing offers a pathway for predicting energies of correlated electronic systems with localized interactions. Here, we apply a quantum embedding approach for investigating oxygen reduction reactions at the electrode surface in Lithium batteries, a representative example of energetic analysis in localized chemical reactions. We employ an Active Space Selection method based on Density Difference Analysis for identifying the orbitals involved in the reaction. Leveraging the Local Unitary Cluster Jastrow ansatz for state preparation, the active-space orbitals are then processed on a quantum computer. As quantum algorithms, we use Sample-based Quantum Diagonalization, SQD, and its extended version, Ext-SQD, which integrates electronic excitations into the quantum-selected electronic configuration subspace. The largest configurations are represented by quantum circuits mapped onto 80 qubits of an IBM Heron R2 quantum processing unit. For up to 12 orbitals, we are able to benchmark the quantum-computed reaction energies against results obtained with Complete Active Space Configuration Interaction. For benchmarking results in active spaces as large as 32 orbitals, we resort to Heat-Bath Configuration Interaction and Coupled Cluster Singles and Doubles calculations, respectively. At 27 orbitals, the Ext-SQD results exhibit prediction accuracy improvements with regard to the standard, quantum-chemical reference methods that remain computationally feasible at that scale. The results indicate the potential of sample-based quantum diagonalization for performing high-accuracy reaction modeling in chemistry and materials science.

Title: Spin-Phonon Relaxation of Boron-Vacancy Centers in Two-Dimensional Boron Nitride Polytypes
Authors: Nasrin Estaji, Ismaeil Abdolhosseini Sarsari, Gergő Thiering, Adam Gali
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials hosting color centers and spin defects are emerging as key platforms for quantum technologies. However, the impact of reduced dimensionality on the spin-lattice relaxation time ($T_1$) of embedded defect spins -- critical for quantum applications -- remains largely unexplored. In this study, we present a systematic first-principles investigation of the negatively charged boron-vacancy (V$_{\text{B}}^-$) defect in monolayer boron nitride (BN), as well as in AA$^\prime$-stacked hexagonal BN (hBN) and ABC-stacked rhombohedral BN (rBN). Our results reveal that the $T_1$ times of V$_{\text{B}}^-$ in monolayer BN and hBN are nearly identical at room temperature. Surprisingly, despite the symmetry reduction in rBN opening additional spin relaxation channels, V$_{\text{B}}^-$ exhibits a longer $T_1$ compared to hBN. We attribute this effect to the stiffer out-of-plane phonon modes in rBN, which activate spin-phonon relaxation at reduced strength. These findings suggest that V$_{\text{B}}^-$ in rBN offers enhanced spin coherence properties, making it a promising candidate for quantum technology applications.

Title: Is Grokking a Computational Glass Relaxation?
Authors: Xiaotian Zhang, Yue Shang, Entao Yang, Ge Zhang
Abstract: Understanding neural network's (NN) generalizability remains a central question in deep learning research. The special phenomenon of grokking, where NNs abruptly generalize long after the training performance reaches a near-perfect level, offers a unique window to investigate the underlying mechanisms of NNs' generalizability. Here we propose an interpretation for grokking by framing it as a computational glass relaxation: viewing NNs as a physical system where parameters are the degrees of freedom and train loss is the system energy, we find memorization process resembles a rapid cooling of liquid into non-equilibrium glassy state at low temperature and the later generalization is like a slow relaxation towards a more stable configuration. This mapping enables us to sample NNs' Boltzmann entropy (states of density) landscape as a function of training loss and test accuracy. Our experiments in transformers on arithmetic tasks suggests that there is NO entropy barrier in the memorization-to-generalization transition of grokking, challenging previous theory that defines grokking as a first-order phase transition. We identify a high-entropy advantage under grokking, an extension of prior work linking entropy to generalizability but much more significant. Inspired by grokking's far-from-equilibrium nature, we develop a toy optimizer WanD based on Wang-landau molecular dynamics, which can eliminate grokking without any constraints and find high-norm generalizing solutions. This provides strictly-defined counterexamples to theory attributing grokking solely to weight norm evolution towards the Goldilocks zone and also suggests new potential ways for optimizer design.

Title: Complex wave functions, CPT and quantum field theory for classical generalized Ising models
Authors: Christof Wetterich
Abstract: The quantum or quantum field theory concept of a complex wave function is useful for understanding the information transport in classical statistical generalized Ising models. We relate complex conjugation to the discrete transformations charge conjugation ($C$), parity ($P$) and time reversal ($T$). A subclass of generalized Ising models are probabilistic cellular automata (PCA) with deterministic updating and probabilistic initial conditions. Simple two-dimensional PCA correspond to discretized quantum field theories for Majorana--Weyl, Weyl or Dirac fermions. Momentum and energy are conserved statistical observables. For PCA describing free massless fermions we investigate the vacuum and field operators for particle excitations. For the correlation function one finds the Lorentz-invariant Feynman propagator of quantum field theory. Furthermore, these automata admit probabilistic boundary conditions that correspond to thermal equilibrium with the quantum Fermi--Dirac distribution. PCA with updating sequences of propagation and interaction steps can realize a rich variety of discrete quantum field theories for fermions with interactions. For information theory the quantum formalism for PCA sheds new light on deterministic computing or signal processing with probabilistic input.

Title: Topological crystals and soliton lattices in a Gross-Neveu model with Hilbert-space fragmentation
Authors: Sergio Cerezo-Roquebrún, Simon Hands, Alejandro Bermudez
Abstract: We explore the finite-density phase diagram of the single-flavour Gross-Neveu-Wilson (GNW) model using matrix product state (MPS) simulations. At zero temperature and along the symmetry line of the phase diagram, we find a sequence of inhomogeneous ground states that arise through a real-space version of the mechanism of Hilbert-space fragmentation. For weak interactions, doping the symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase of the GNW model leads to localized charges or holes at periodic arrangements of immobile topological defects separating the fragmented subchains: a topological crystal. Increasing the interactions, we observe a transition into a parity-broken phase with a pseudoscalar condensate displaying a modulated periodic pattern. This soliton lattice is a sequence of topological charges corresponding to anti-kinks, which also bind the doped fermions at their respective centers. Out of this symmetry line, we show that quasi-spiral profiles appear with a characteristic wavevector set by the density $k = 2{\pi}{\rho}$, providing non-perturbative evidence for chiral spirals beyond the large-N limit. These results demonstrate that various exotic inhomogeneous phases can arise in lattice field theories, and motivate the use of quantum simulators to confirm such QCD-inspired phenomena in future experiments.

Title: Acceleration of the CASINO quantum Monte Carlo software using graphics processing units and OpenACC
Authors: B. Thorpe, M. J. Smith, P. J. Hasnip, N. D. Drummond
Abstract: We describe how quantum Monte Carlo calculations using the CASINO software can be accelerated using graphics processing units (GPUs) and OpenACC. In particular we consider offloading Ewald summation, the evaluation of long-range two-body terms in the Jastrow correlation factor, and the evaluation of orbitals in a blip basis set. We present results for three- and two-dimensional homogeneous electron gases and ab initio simulations of bulk materials, showing that significant speedups of up to a factor of 2.5 can be achieved by the use of GPUs when several hundred particles are included in the simulations. The use of single-precision arithmetic can improve the speedup further without significant detriment to the accuracy of the calculations.

Title: Low dimensional dynamics of a sparse balanced synaptic network of quadratic integrate-and-fire neurons
Authors: Maria V. Ageeva, Denis S. Goldobin
Abstract: Kinetics of a balanced network of neurons with a sparse grid of synaptic links is well representable by the stochastic dynamics of a generic neuron subject to an effective shot noise. The rate of delta-pulses of the noise is determined self-consistently from the probability density of the neuron states. Importantly, the most sophisticated (but robust) collective regimes of the network do not allow for the diffusion approximation, which is routinely adopted for a shot noise in mathematical neuroscience. These regimes can be expected to be biologically relevant. For the kinetics equations of the complete mean field theory of a homogeneous inhibitory network of quadratic integrate-and-fire neurons, we introduce circular cumulants of the genuine phase variable and derive a rigorous two cumulant reduction for both time-independent conditions and modulation of the excitatory current. The low dimensional model is examined with numerical simulations and found to be accurate for time-independent states and dynamic response to a periodic modulation deep into the parameter domain where the diffusion approximation is not applicable. The accuracy of a low dimensional model indicates and explains a low embedding dimensionality of the macroscopic collective dynamics of the network. The reduced model can be instrumental for theoretical studies of inhibitory-excitatory balanced neural networks.

Title: Multiscale Growth Kinetics of Model Biomolecular Condensates Under Passive and Active Conditions
Authors: Tamizhmalar Sundararajan, Matteo Boccalini, Roméo Suss, Sandrine Mariot, Emerson R. Da Silva, Fernando C. Giacomelli, Austin Hubley, Theyencheri Narayanan, Alessandro Barducci, Guillaume Tresset
Abstract: Living cells exhibit a complex organization comprising numerous compartments, among which are RNA- and protein-rich membraneless, liquid-like organelles known as biomolecular condensates. Energy-consuming processes regulate their formation and dissolution, with (de-)phosphorylation by specific enzymes being among the most commonly involved reactions. By employing a model system consisting of a phosphorylatable peptide and homopolymeric RNA, we elucidate how enzymatic activity modulates the growth kinetics and alters the local structure of biomolecular condensates. Under passive condition, time-resolved ultra-small-angle X-ray scattering with synchrotron source reveals a nucleation-driven coalescence mechanism maintained over four decades in time, similar to the coarsening of simple binary fluid mixtures. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations show that peptide-decorated RNA chains assembled shortly after mixing constitute the relevant subunits. In contrast, actively-formed condensates initially display a local mass fractal structure, which gradually matures upon enzymatic activity before condensates undergo coalescence. Both types of condensate eventually reach a steady state but fluorescence recovery after photobleaching indicates a peptide diffusivity twice higher in actively-formed condensates consistent with their loosely-packed local structure. We expect multiscale, integrative approaches implemented with model systems to link effectively the functional properties of membraneless organelles to their formation and dissolution kinetics as regulated by cellular active processes.

Title: Rectification of Vibrational Energy Transfer in Driven Chiral Molecules
Authors: Jichen Feng, Ethan Abraham, Joseph E. Subotnik, Abraham Nitzan
Abstract: We show that the combination of molecular chirality and phase-controlled driving can lead to rectification of vibrational energy transfer. We demonstrate this effect using classical models of (1) a single helical chain and (2) a more realistic model of polyethylene double helix. We examine the effect of the driving frequency, polarization, and temperature on this phenomenon. Notably, we find that the direction and magnitude of the observed directionality preference depend on the driving frequency and phase, and that the effect persists at room temperature.

Title: Long-range minimal models
Authors: Connor Behan, Dario Benedetti, Fanny Eustachon, Edoardo Lauria
Abstract: We study a class of nonlocal conformal field theories in two dimensions which are obtained as deformations of the Virasoro minimal models. The construction proceeds by coupling a relevant primary operator $\phi_{r,s}$ of the $m$-th minimal model to a generalized free field, in such a way that the interaction term has scaling dimension $2-\delta$. Flowing to the infrared, we reach a new class of CFTs that we call long-range minimal models. In the case $r=s=2$, the resulting line of fixed points, parametrized by $\delta$, can be studied using two perturbative expansions with different regimes of validity, one near the mean-field theory end, and one close to the long-range to short-range crossover. This is due to a straightforward generalization of an infrared duality which was proposed for the long-range Ising model ($m = 3$) in 2017. We find that the large-$m$ limit is problematic in both perturbative regimes, hence nonperturbative methods will be required in the intermediate range for all values of $m$. For the models based on $\phi_{1,2}$, the situation is rather different. In this case, only one perturbative expansion is known but it is well behaved at large $m$. We confirm this with a computation of infinitely many anomalous dimensions at two loops. Their large-$m$ limits are obtained from both numerical extrapolations and a method we develop which carries out conformal perturbation theory using Mellin amplitudes. For minimal models, these can be accessed from the Coulomb gas representations of the correlators. This method reveals analytic expressions for some integrals in conformal perturbation theory which were previously only known numerically.
