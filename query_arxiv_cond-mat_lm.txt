Title: On the theory of supermodulation of the superconducting order parameter by supermodulation of the apex distance in optimally doped Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$
Authors: Albert M. Varonov, Todor M. Mishonov
Abstract: Recently using Scanning Josephson Tunneling Microscopy (SJTM) in the group of Séamus Davis a super-modulation of the superconducting order parameter induced by super-modulation of the distance $\delta$ between planar Cu and apical O was observed in [O'Mahony et al, On the electron pairing mechanism of copper-oxide high temperature superconductivity, PNAS Vol. 119(37), e2207449119 (2022)]. The authors conclude: "concurrence of prediction from strong correlation theory... with these observations indicates that... super-exchange is the electron pairing mechanism of Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$." Additionally, the charge transfer energy $\mathcal{E}$, probably between O2$p_z$ and Cu$3d_{x^2-y^2}$ levels was studied by SJTM, too. In our current theoretical study we use LCAO approximation and Hilbert space spanned on 5 atomic orbitals: Cu$4s$, Cu$3d_{x^2-y^2}$, O2$p_x$, O2$p_y$, O2$p_z$. For the only super-exchange amplitude $J_{sd}$ we use the Kondo double electron exchange between Cu$4s$ and Cu$3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals and its anti-ferromagnetic sign is determined by adjacent to the copper ion in-plane oxygen orbitals. Within this approximations we have calculated: "Measured dependence of... electron-pair density $n_p$ on the displacement $\delta$ of the apical O atoms from the planar Cu atoms" on [O'Mahony et al., Fig. 5C] and obtained an excellent accuracy. We discuss that the correlation between the shape of Fermi contour and the critical temperature of optimally hole-doped cuprates can be considered as an analogue of the isotope effect of phonon superconductors. The analyzed SJTM experiment is one of the best confirmations of the [J. Röhler, Plane dimpling and Cu4s hybridization in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-x}$, Physica B: Cond. Matt. Vol. 284-288, 1041 (2000)] idea that the hybridization of Cu$4s$ with conduction band leads to increasing of $T_c$.

Title: Thermodynamics and Legendre Duality in Optimal Networks
Authors: Amilcare Porporato, Shashank Kumar Anand, Salvatore Calabrese, Luca Ridolfi, Lamberto Rondoni
Abstract: Optimality principles in nonequilibrium transport networks are linked to a thermodynamic formalism based on generalized transport potentials endowed with Legendre duality and related contact structure. This allows quantifying the distance from non-equilibrium operating points, analogously to thermodynamic availability as well as to shed light on optimality principles in relation to different imposed constraints. Extremizations of generalized dissipation and entropy production appear as special cases that require power-law resistances and -- for entropy production -- also isothermal conditions. Changes in stability of multiple operating points are interpreted as phase transitions based on non-equilibrium equations of state, while cost-based optimization of transport properties reveals connections to the generalized dissipation in the case of power law costs and linear resistance law, but now with typically unstable operating points which give rise to branched optimal transport.

Title: Two Types of Temporal Symmetry in the Laws of Nature
Authors: A.Y. Klimenko
Abstract: This work explores the implications of assuming time symmetry and applying bridge-type, time-symmetric temporal boundary conditions to deterministic laws of nature with random components. The analysis, drawing on the works of Kolmogorov and Anderson, leads to two forms of governing equations, referred to here as symmetric and antisymmetric. These equations account for the emergence of characteristics associated with conventional thermodynamics, the arrow of time, and a form of antecedent causality. The directional properties of time arise from the mathematical structure of Markov bridges, without requiring any postulates that impose a preferred direction of time.

Title: Breakdown of the thermodynamic limit in quantum spin and dimer models
Authors: Jeet Shah, Laura Shou, Jeremy Shuler, Victor Galitski
Abstract: The thermodynamic limit is foundational to statistical mechanics, underlying our understanding of many-body phases. It assumes that, as the system size grows infinitely at fixed density of particles, unambiguous macroscopic phases emerge that are independent of the system's boundary shape. We present explicit quantum spin and dimer Hamiltonians whose ground states violate this principle. Our construction relies on the previous mathematical work on classical dimers on the Aztec diamond and the square-octagon fortress, where geometry-dependent phase behaviors are observed in the infinite-size limit. We reverse engineer quantum spin Hamiltonians on the square and the square-octagon lattices whose ground states at the Rokhsar-Kivelson points are described by classical dimer coverings. On diamond-shaped domains, we find macroscopic boundary regions exhibiting distinct quantum phases from those on square-shaped domains. We study the nature of these phases by calculating the dimer-dimer and vison correlators and adapt Kasteleyn matrix based analytical and numerical methods for computing the vison correlator, which are significantly more efficient than standard Monte Carlo techniques. Our results show that the square-octagon lattice supports a single gapped short-range entangled phase, with exponentially decaying dimer correlators and a constant vison correlator. When the same model is considered on a diamond-shaped domain, an additional ordered phase emerges near the corners, where the dimers are in a staggered pattern.

Title: Probing the pseudogap and beyond: examining single-particle properties of the hole- and electron-doped Hubbard model
Authors: Wen O. Wang, Edwin W. Huang, Brian Moritz, Thomas P. Devereaux
Abstract: We compute high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy of the Hubbard model using the unbiased determinant quantum Monte Carlo algorithm, revealing an asymmetry between electron and hole doping. Electron doping exhibits more coherent quasiparticles and stronger antiferromagnetic correlations compared to hole doping. At low doping, a nodal-antinodal dichotomy on the Fermi surface is observed, similar to cuprate experiments. The dichotomy reflects the momentum dependence of the Mott gap, as manifested in both the spectral function and the self-energy. For hole doping, we observe a transition towards the pseudogap, without signature of pocket formation. The simulated nuclear magnetic resonance pseudogap temperatures do not necessarily agree with the temperature determined by spectroscopy. These findings collectively suggest the pseudogap is a smooth crossover driven by strong correlations.

Title: Inhibition of whisker growth by crafting more decomposition-resistant Ti2SnC MAX phase through vanadium solid solution
Authors: Haifeng Tang, Xiaodan Yin, Peigen Zhang, Victor Karpov, Vamsi Borra, Zhihua Tian, Wei Zheng, Jianxiang Ding, ZhengMing Sun
Abstract: The exceptional synergy of ceramic and metallic properties within MAX phases positions them as highly promising for a wide array of applications. However, their stability has been threatened by the phenomenon of A-site metal whisker growth. Herein, we have significantly mitigated tin whisker growth in Ti2SnC by incorporating vanadium solutes at its M-site. With an increase in vanadium concentration, there is a marked reduction in the degree of decomposition of the M-site solid solution when subjected to the same level of externally destructive treatments, thereby inhibiting whisker proliferation. Both experimental outcomes and theoretical calculations reveal that the vanadium solid solution augments the hardness, Pughs ratio, and Poissons ratio of Ti2SnC, enhancing its mechanical strength and toughness. The incorporation of V atoms introduces stronger V C and V Sn bonds, as evidenced by its electronic density of states and bulk modulus, thus significantly bolstering the resistance of MAX phases against decomposition and effectively curtailing whisker growth. Additionally, the phenomenon reported in this paper also conforms to the electrostatic theory of whisker growth. This work for the first time achieves the suppression of A-site whisker growth through an M-site solid solution, thereby extending their potential for applications where durability and reliability are paramount.

Title: Mean first passage time of active Brownian particles in two dimensions
Authors: Sarafa A. Iyaniwura, Zhiwei Peng
Abstract: The mean first passage time (MFPT) is a key metric for understanding transport, search, and escape processes in stochastic systems. While well characterized for passive Brownian particles, its behavior in active systems-such as active Brownian particles (ABPs)-remains less understood due to their self-propelled, nonequilibrium dynamics. In this paper, we formulate and analyze an elliptic partial differential equation (PDE) to characterize the MFPT of ABPs in two-dimensional domains, including circular, annular, and elliptical regions. For annular regions, we analyze the MFPT of ABPs under various boundary conditions. Our results reveal rich behaviors in the MFPT of ABPs that differ fundamentally from those of passive particles. Notably, the MFPT exhibits non-monotonic dependence on the initial position and orientation of the particle, with maxima often occurring away from the domain center. We also find that increasing swimming speed can either increase or decrease the MFPT depending on the geometry and initial orientation. Asymptotic analysis of the PDE in the weak-activity regime provides insight into how activity modifies escape statistics of the particles in different geometries. Finally, our numerical solutions of the PDE are validated against Monte Carlo simulations.

Title: First-Principles Thermodynamics of Al$_{10}$V: An Analytical Treatment of Localized Anharmonic Modes
Authors: Hassan Y. Albuhairan, Marek Mihalkovič, Michael Widom
Abstract: Many complex intermetallic structures possess cage-like environments that can host additional guest atoms. In Al$_{10}$V, these atoms give rise to low-frequency, localized vibrations (Einstein modes) that dominate the thermodynamic response at low temperature. They become imaginary under volume expansion as temperature rises, invalidating the harmonic approximation. We develop a framework to incorporate these strongly anharmonic vibrational modes into first-principles thermodynamic calculations. By explicitly modeling the cage potential and solving the associated Schrödinger equation numerically, we compute the full anharmonic free energy contribution and demonstrate its impact on thermodynamic phase stability. Our results reproduce key experimental signatures, including the anomalous rise in the thermal expansion coefficient and specific heat at low temperatures, and reveal that the presence of guest atoms is essential to stabilizing the Al$_{10}$V phase at elevated temperatures.

Title: Generalized Spectral Statistics in the Kicked Ising model
Authors: Divij Gupta, Brian Swingle
Abstract: The kicked Ising model has been studied extensively as a model of quantum chaos. Bertini, Kos, and Prosen studied the system in the thermodynamic limit, finding an analytic expression for the spectral form factor, $K(t)$, at the self-dual point with periodic boundary conditions. The spectral form factor is the 2nd moment of the trace of the time evolution operator, and we study the higher moments of this random variable in the kicked Ising model. A previous study of these higher moments by Flack, Bertini, and Prosen showed that, surprisingly, the trace behaves like a real Gaussian random variable when the system has periodic boundary conditions at the self dual point. By contrast, we investigate the model with open boundary conditions at the self dual point and find that the trace of the time evolution operator behaves as a complex Gaussian random variable as expected from random matrix universality based on the circular orthogonal ensemble. This result highlights a surprisingly strong effect of boundary conditions on the statistics of the trace. We also study a generalization of the spectral form factor known as the Loschmidt spectral form factor and present results for different boundary conditions.

Title: Mean-field theory of the electromagnon resonance
Authors: Pavel A. Andreev, Mariya Iv. Trukhanova
Abstract: We present the analytical theory of the electromagnon resonance for the multiferroics of spin origin. We consider the spin density evolution under the influence of magnetoelectric coupling in the presence of the electromagnetic wave. The dielectric permeability is found for the eigen-wave perturbations accompanied by perturbations of the electric field. The imaginary part of the dielectric permeability is found as the function of the applied electric field frequency, while the frequency of the eigen-waves is found from the dispersion equation as the function of the wave vector and parameters of the system. The result shows the existence of two peaks. One sharp peak is associated with the magnon resonance, while the second wide peak at the approximately four times smaller frequency is interpreted as the electromagnon resonance in accordance with existing experimental data.

Title: A new Surrogate Microstructure Generator for Porous Materials with Applications to the Buffer Layer of TRISO Nuclear Fuel Particles
Authors: Philipp Eisenhardt, Ustim Khristenko, Barbara Wohlmuth, Andrei Constantinescu
Abstract: We present a surrogate material model for generating microstructure samples reproducing the morphology of the real material. The generator is based on Gaussian random fields, with a Matérn kernel and a topological support field defined through ellipsoidal inclusions clustered by a random walk algorithm. We identify the surrogate model parameters by minimizing misfits in a list of statistical and geometrical descriptors of the material microstructure. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the method for porous nuclear materials, we apply the generator to the buffer layer of Tristructural Isotropic Nuclear Fuel (TRISO) particles. This part has been shown to be failure sensitive part of TRISO nuclear fuel and our generator is optimized with respect to a dataset of FIB-SEM tomography across the buffer layer thickness. We evaluate the performance by applying mechanical modeling with problems of linear elastic homogenization and linear elastic brittle fracture material properties and comparing the behaviour of the dataset microstructure and the surrogate microstructure. This shows good agreement between the dataset microstructure and the generated microstructures over a large range of porosities.

Title: Characterizing Spin-Orbit Torques by Tensorial Spin Hall Magnetoresistance
Authors: Hantao Zhang, Ran Cheng
Abstract: Magnetoresistance (MR) provides a crucial tool for experimentally studying spin torques. While MR is well established in the device geometry of the spin Hall effect (SHE), as exemplified by the magnet/heavy-metal heterostructures, its role and manifestation beyond the SHE paradigm remain elusive. Here we propose a previously unknown form of MR where the underlying charge-to-spin conversion and its inverse process violate the simple geometry of the SHE, calling for tensorial descriptions. This novel MR can generate a series of unique harmonic responses essential for the experimental characterization of unconventional spin-orbit torques in non-SHE materials. Our results are demonstrated in semimetal WTe$_2$ thin films.

Title: Unveiling defect motifs in amorphous GeSe using machine learning interatomic potentials
Authors: Minseok Moon, Seungwoo Hwang, Jaesun Kim, Yutack Park, Changho Hong, Seungwu Han
Abstract: Ovonic threshold switching (OTS) selectors play a critical role in non-volatile memory devices because of their nonlinear electrical behavior and polarity-dependent threshold voltages. However, the atomic-scale origins of the defect states responsible for these properties are not yet fully understood. In this study, we use molecular dynamics simulations accelerated by machine-learning interatomic potentials to investigate defects in amorphous GeSe. We begin by benchmarking several potential architectures-including descriptor-based models and graph neural network (GNN) models-and show that faithfully representing amorphous GeSe requires capturing higher-order interactions (at least four-body correlations) and medium-range structural order. We find that GNN architectures with multiple interaction layers successfully capture these correlations and structural motifs, preventing the spurious defects that less expressive models introduce. With our optimized GNN potential, we examine twenty independent 960-atom amorphous GeSe structures and identify two distinct defect motifs: aligned Ge chains, which give rise to defect states near the conduction band, and overcoordinated Ge chains, which produce defect states near the valence band. We further correlate these electronic defect levels with specific structural features-namely, the average alignment of bond angles in the aligned chains and the degree of local Peierls distortion around overcoordinated Ge atoms. These findings provide a theoretical framework for interpreting experimental observations and deepen our understanding of defect-driven OTS phenomena in amorphous GeSe.

Title: $La_3Pd_2NaO_9$: A High-Valent Insulating Palladate
Authors: Qingqing Yang, Ning Guo, Tieyan Chang, Zheng Guo, Xiaoli Wang, Chuanyan Fan, Chao Liu, Lu Han, Feiyu Li, Tao He, Qiang Zheng, Yu-Sheng Chen, Junjie Zhang
Abstract: A high-valent palladate, $La_3Pd_2NaO_9$, has been synthesized for the first time. Single crystals with dimensions of 20 ${\mu}$m on edge were successfully grown using the flux method at 420 $^o$C and 70 bar oxygen pressure. Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP) measurements show that the atomic ratio of La: (Pd+Na) is 3: 3 and Pd: Na is 2: 1. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements show that the oxidation state of Pd is dominated by +4. Synchrotron X-ray single-crystal diffraction measurements revealed that this material crystallizes in the monoclinic $P2_1/c$ space group with charge ordering of Na and Pd. Real-space imaging via scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) confirmed the crystal structure and revealed excellent sample homogeneity. Electrical resistivity measurements show an insulating behavior. Magnetic measurements show an unexpected paramagnetic behavior, which probably originate from a small fraction of high-spin Pd$^{2+}$ evidenced by XPS. The successful growth of $La_3Pd_2NaO_9$ single crystals with a high-valent oxidation state of Pd offers an approach for exploring interesting palladates, including potential bilayer Ruddlesden-Popper palladates analogous to the high temperature superconducting $La_3Ni_2O_7$.

Title: Unifying renormalized and bare viscosity in two-dimensional molecular dynamics simulations
Authors: Kazuma Yokota, Masato Itami, Shin-ichi Sasa
Abstract: Fluctuating hydrodynamics provides a framework connecting mesoscopic fluctuations with macroscopic transport behavior. To bridge mesoscopic and macroscopic transport from microscopic dynamics, we introduce a wavenumber-dependent viscosity, defined via the equilibrium correlation of time-averaged Fourier components of the fine-grained shear stress field, as a finite-wavevector extension of the Green--Kubo formula. Two-dimensional molecular dynamics simulations reveal its small-wavenumber divergence characteristic of the renormalized viscosity, while its large-wavenumber behavior determines the bare viscosity, thereby establishing a link between mesoscopic and macroscopic transport based on microscopic dynamics.

Title: Anti-Sisyphus driving in a matter-wave swing
Authors: Wen L. Liu, Jun Jian, Ning X. Zheng, Hui Tang, Ji Z. Wu, Yu Q. Li, Wen X. Zhang, Jie Ma, Suo T. Jia
Abstract: Dilute-gas Bose-Einstein condensates are an exceptionally versatile testbed for the investigation of physics phenomenon especially the well-known classical system. Here we use a degenerate Bose gas of sodium atoms confined in an optical dipole trap to simulate the matter-wave on the swing. Under the driving of Anti-Sisyphus process, the swing was excited successfully. Moreover, the spin echo like behavior and collective-mode excitation appear during the oscillation of matter-wave swing, manifesting the quantum nature of the system beyond its classical counterpart. Our work lays the foundation for matter-wave on the swing and more generally points to a future of practical applications for the motional quantum states linked with quantum information science.

Title: Exceedingly large in-plane critical field of finite-momentum pairing state in bulk superlattices
Authors: Junfa Lin, Ziqiao Wang, Hongyi Yan, Xiaoping Ma, Zihan Cui, Yu Zhang, Yuxuan Lei, Jie Liu, Rao Li, Chuanying Xi, Zengwei Zhu, Huakun Zuo, Yanzhao Liu, Huaixin Yang, Tian-Long Xia, Haiwen Liu, Yi Liu, Jian Wang
Abstract: Magnetic flux profoundly influences the phase factor of charge particles, leading to exotic quantum phenomena. A recent example is that the orbital effect of magnetic field could induce finite-momentum pairing state in nanoflakes, which offers a new pathway to realize the spatially modulated superconductivity distinct from the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state induced by Zeeman effect. However, whether such intriguing state can exist in the bulk materials under extremely large magnetic field remains elusive. Here we report the orbital effect induced finite-momentum pairing state with exceedingly large in-plane critical field in a bulk superconducting superlattice. Remarkably, the in-plane critical field shows a pronounced upturn behavior, exceeding eight times the Pauli limit which is comparable to monolayer Ising superconductor. Under high in-plane magnetic fields, significant anisotropic transport behavior between the interlayer and intralayer directions is detected, highlighting the critical role of suppressed interlayer coherence in the orbital effect induced finite-momentum pairing state. Crucially, this finite-momentum pairing state remains robust against moderate disorder. Our findings suggest that van der Waals superlattices, with strong Ising spin-orbit coupling and tunable interlayer coherence, offer new avenues for constructing and modulating unconventional superconducting states.

Title: Band engineering aided by topological edge state proximity effects: Inducing anti-chirality in graphene
Authors: Ricardo Y. Díaz-Bonifaz, Carlos Ramírez
Abstract: In this work we analyze infinite graphene nanoribbons subjected to non-uniform magnetic fields that produce topological domain walls in the quantum Hall regime. We show how the proximity between edge states from neighboring domains modifies the band structure due to the state coupling near the domain walls. The proximity-induced band deformations produce phenomena such as bulk-like dispersion that coexist with Landau levels and valley-polarized current paths. It is shown that edge state coupling can be enhanced by continuously varying the magnetic field between two non-trivial topological phases. The mechanism by which neighboring edge states modify the band structure is addressed by tracking their wave-functions over isolated bands and by analyzing the magnetic confinement potential near the domain wall. By calculating the local current density, we show that the coexistence of topological edge states with bulk-like dispersion can lead to the appearance of anti-chirality, in which co-propagating currents appear in the edges while the rest of the nanoribbon is occupied with bulk states. The appearance of anti-chirality is justified by comparing the proposed non-uniform magnetic field profile with an anti-chiral modified Haldane model.

Title: Ultrafast dynamics of three-dimensional Kane plasmons in the narrow-bandgap Hg$_{0.8}$Cd$_{0.2}$Te
Authors: Xiaoyue Zhou, Yi Chan, Siyuan Zhu, Fu Deng, Wei Bai, Jingdi Zhang
Abstract: We report on an ultrafast terahertz spectroscopic study on the dynamics of free carriers and the pertinent bulk plasmons in Hg$_{0.8}$Cd$_{0.2}$Te (MCT) film, a narrowband semiconductor accommodating three dimensional massless Kane fermions. The ultrabroadband terahertz source enables the investigation of the lightly doped equilibrium state in the presence of plasmon-phonon hybridization through the heavily doped excited state, primarily dominated by plasmons. Without the recourse to the resource consuming cryogenic high magnetic field spectroscopy that hinges on observable related to the interband transition, we show that the massless band dispersion can instead be conveniently perceived by the room temperature study of the intraband transition through the determination of the plasmon carrier density relationship. We found the plasma frequency in MCT scales with the cube root of carrier density, in contrast with the square root scaling in the conventional massive fermion system of parabolic band dispersion. This work also answers the curious question of whether the MCT can maintain its massless Kane fermion character in case the strict gapless condition is deviated from. The method presented herein provides a convenient approach to identifying the landscape of both massless and massive band dispersion.

Title: Shift current in 2D Janus Transition-Metal Dichalcogenides: the role of excitons
Authors: Yuncheng Mao, Ju Zhou, Myrta Grüning, Claudio Attaccalite
Abstract: We study the shift current in two two-dimensional (2D) Janus transition metal dichalcogenides: molybdenum diselenide (MoSSe) and tungsten diselenide (WSSe). The shift current is evaluated using a real-time approach, in which the coupling with an external field is described in terms of a dynamical Berry phase. This approach incorporates electron-hole interactions and quasiparticle band structure renormalization through an effective Hamiltonian derived from many-body perturbation theory. We find that the shift current is strongly enhanced in correspondence of C excitons. An analysis in terms of the electron-hole pairs reveals that electron and hole are localized on different atoms, and thus following an optical excitation, the center of the electron charge is shifted thus giving rise to a significant photocurrent. These results highlight the role played by excitons in the shift-current response of Janus TMDs and demonstrate that these materials are promising building blocks for future photovoltaic devices.

Title: Superfluid dome in the spatially modulated two-dimensional XY model
Authors: Feng-Feng Song, Aditya Chugh, Hanggai Nuomin, Naoki Kawashima, Alexander Wietek
Abstract: In strongly correlated electron systems, superconductivity and charge density waves often coexist in close proximity, suggesting a deeper relationship between these competing phases. Recent research indicates that these orders can intertwine, with the superconducting order parameter coupling to modulations in the electronic density. To elucidate this interplay, we study a two-dimensional XY model with a periodic modulation of the coupling strength in one spatial direction. Using a combination of tensor network methods and Monte Carlo simulations, we reveal a non-monotonic, dome-like dependence of $T_c$ on the modulation wavelength, with the peak $T_c$ shifting to longer wavelengths as the modulation strength grows. The origin of this phenomenon is traced back to an effective pinning of vortices in the valleys of the modulation, confirmed by a comparison to modulated $q$-state clock models. These findings shed new light on the phase behavior of intertwined superconducting and charge-ordered states, offering a deeper understanding of their complex interactions.

Title: Microstates : Do the outliers worth
Authors: Olivier Sire
Abstract: This note addresses the relevance of rare events in system dynamics, inspired by Jill North reflections on the origin of the arrow of time in thermodynamics. After identifying the existence of rare events, characterized by a Pareto distribution, within a simple gas particle simulation, we investigate their impact on entropy evolution. These rare events are associated with microstates that locally decrease entropy, in contrast to the overall entropy increase observed in the bulk of the system. We present numerical simulations of gas particles, both without and with a gravity-like attractive force, to explore the fate of these rare events. Our results show that, while rare events can transiently generate local decreases in entropy, global entropy may continue to increase in accordance with the second law of thermodynamics. The introduction of gravity-like attraction stabilizes these low-entropy configurations, allowing them to persist longer. This study highlights the interplay between rare statistical fluctuations and macroscopic thermodynamic behavior, providing new insights into the emergence and stability of order in complex systems.

Title: Finite Thickness Effects on Metallization Vs. Chiral Majorana Fermions
Authors: Xin Yue, Guo-Jian Qiao, C. P. Sun
Abstract: In heterostructures composed of quantum anomalous Hall insulators and \textit{s}-wave superconductors (SCs), metallization hinders the identification of chiral Majorana fermions (CMFs). In this Letter, we study how the thickness of SC affects the competition between metallization and CMFs by a holistic approach previously developed for hybrid nanowire systems [Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 266605 (2024)]. We predict three types of structures that vary with thickness of SC: (i) Periodic structure of metallization. For thin SCs ($\sim$10\,nm), the metallization region exhibits oscillations as the thickness of SC changes, with the oscillation period corresponding to the Fermi wavelength of SC. (ii) Periodic structure of CMFs. For intermediate thicknesses ($\sim$100\,nm), the window width for observing CMFs exhibits a periodic behavior, oscillating with the same period. (iii) Stable structure of CMFs. For thick SCs ($\sim$1000\,nm), the behavior of CMFs becomes uniform as the thickness varies. Optimizing the thickness of SC may thus improve data quality and provide clearer evidence for CMFs.

Title: Coherent Spin Waves in Curved Ferromagnetic Nanocaps of a 3D-printed Magnonic Crystal
Authors: Huixin Guo, Kilian Lenz, Mateusz Gołębiewski, Ryszard Narkowicz, Jürgen Lindner, Maciej Krawczyk, Dirk Grundler
Abstract: Coherent magnon modes in a truly three-dimensional (3D) magnonic crystal have not yet been investigated. This scientific gap exists despite the numerous theoretical predictions about miniband formation and edge modes with topological protection. Such properties are key to advance nanomagnonics for ultrafast data processing. In this work, we use a scalable nanotechnology and integrate a 3D magnonic crystal to an on-chip microresonator. It was fabricated by two-photon lithography of a 3D woodpile structure and atomic layer deposition of 30-nm-thick nickel. Operated near 14 and 24~GHz, the microresonator output revealed numerous coherent magnons with distinct angular dependencies reflecting the underlying face-centred cubic lattice. Micromagnetic simulations show that the edge modes are localised in curved nanocaps and robust against changes in field orientation. Along an edge, they exhibit an unexpected phase evolution. Our findings advance functional microwave circuits with 3D magnonic crystals and fuel their visionary prospects of edge-dominated magnon modes.

Title: Advancing atomic electron tomography with neural networks
Authors: Juhyeok Lee, Yongsoo Yang
Abstract: Accurate determination of three-dimensional (3D) atomic structures is crucial for understanding and controlling the properties of nanomaterials. Atomic electron tomography (AET) offers non-destructive atomic imaging with picometer-level precision, enabling the resolution of defects, interfaces, and strain fields in 3D, as well as the observation of dynamic structural evolution. However, reconstruction artifacts arising from geometric limitations and electron dose constraints can hinder reliable atomic structure determination. Recent progress has integrated deep learning, especially convolutional neural networks, into AET workflows to improve reconstruction fidelity. This review highlights recent advances in neural network-assisted AET, emphasizing its role in overcoming persistent challenges in 3D atomic imaging. By significantly enhancing the accuracy of both surface and bulk structural characterization, these methods are advancing the frontiers of nanoscience and enabling new opportunities in materials research and technology.

Title: Extracting the singularity of the logarithmic partition function
Authors: Zhe Wang, Yi-Ming Ding, Zenan Liu, Zheng Yan
Abstract: In principle, the logarithm of the partition function and its derivatives can be used to rigorously determine the nature of phase transitions. However, in practice, this approach is often ineffective in numerical calculations, since resolving the singularities of the logarithmic partition function requires extremely high precision data especially when distinguishing between weakly first order phase transitions and deconfined quantum critical points. Based on the finite size scaling hypothesis, we propose that the singular contribution to the logarithmic partition function in quantum phase transitions can be extracted by eliminating the leading volume-law term. This is achieved by computing the Renyi thermal entropy (RTE) and its derivative (DRTE). We have derived the scaling relations for RTE and DRTE, which successfully determine the phase transition points and critical exponents through data collapse in various quantum many body systems. Notably, beyond their utility in locating quantum critical points, we find that DRTE is remarkably effective in detecting weakly first order phase transitions, such as in $ JQ $ models, which were initially thought to be continuous deconfined quantum phase transitions. The discontinuity of these transitions is challenging to detect using traditional local physical quantities. This work provides a new and powerful paradigm for studying quantum many body phase transitions.

Title: Pseudo anomalous Hall effect in semiconductors and semimetals: A classical perspective
Authors: Akiyoshi Yamada, Yuki Fuseya
Abstract: We demonstrate that the non-linear field dependence in the Hall effect, often indistinguishable from the anomalous Hall effect, can be realized entirely within the classical mechanism due to the Lorentz force by analyzing multi-valley models for semiconductors and semimetals. The non-linear component in the Hall resistivity $\rho_H^{\rm NL}$ originates from carrier mobility anisotropy or the coexistence of different charges. Since $\rho_H^{\rm NL}$ is inversely proportional to the carrier difference between electrons and holes $\Delta n$, it exceeds its zero-field value near charge neutrality. As a practical example, we show that the magnitude of the classical non-linear Hall response in ZrTe$_5$ is comparable to the experimental values, underscoring the importance of accounting for classical contributions before attributing non-linear Hall effects to quantum mechanisms.

Title: Bi2Te3-Sb2Te3-Bi2Te3 Lateral Heterostructures Grown by Molecular Beam Epitaxy
Authors: Puspendu Guha, Sangmin Lee, Eunsu Lee, Hyeonhu Bae, Hoonkyung Lee, Miyoung Kim, Gyu-Chul Yi
Abstract: Lateral in-plane heterostructures enable precise control of electronic properties and quantum effects in 2D materials. However, their periodic synthesis is challenging because it requires precise control to maintain sharp, coherent interfaces and compatible growth conditions across different domains. Herein, we report the successful heteroepitaxial growth of Bi2Te3-Sb2Te3-Bi2Te3 and periodic lateral heterostructures on hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) through in-situ multiple growth steps at different stages using a molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) system. These trilateral heterostructures are fabricated by growing triangular or hexagonal Bi2Te3 islands at the very beginning, with typical sizes of several hundred nanometers, on the single-crystalline hBN, followed by the lateral growth of Sb2Te3 to form bilateral heterostructures, and finally growing Bi2Te3 on the side facets of the bilateral heterostructures. The electron microscopy results confirm the core area as Bi2Te3, the intermediate layer as Sb2Te3, and the outermost region as Bi2Te3. The resulting heterostructures are approximately 4-8 nm thick and several hundred nanometers in lateral dimensions. These heterostructures are found to grow epitaxially on hBN (< +-4 deg misalignment), and the individual layers are strongly epitaxially aligned with each other. The in-plane heterojunctions are analyzed using the aberration-corrected (Cs-corrected) high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy technique. We have explored and established the plasmonic properties of these fabricated Bi2Te3-Sb2Te3-Bi2Te3 lateral heterostructures. In addition, the electronic states and the topological properties of the few quintuple layers (QLs) (2- to 4-QLs) Bi2Te3-Sb2Te3 lateral periodic heterostructures are investigated by first-principles calculations.

Authors: Lumen Eek, Esra D. van 't Westende, Dennis J. Klaassen, Harold J. W. Zandvliet, Pantelis Bampoulis, Cristiane Morais Smith
Abstract: Symmetry-protected zero-dimensional (0D) modes, such as corner and end states with fractionalized charge, promise robust qubits and efficient electronics. Yet, reversible, electric-field manipulation and control of these modes has remained elusive. Here, we show theoretically and experimentally electric-field-driven on/off switching of 0D topological end modes in two- and three-hexagon wide germanene nanoribbons in a vertical tunnel junction set-up. We demonstrate the annihilation and restoration of end states in topological samples, but also the induction of 0D topological modes in initially trivial ribbons. The process is reversible, and the system operates at 77 Kelvin. This atomic-scale platform realizes a proof-of-principle for a 0D topological field-effect device, opening an unexpected path for ultra-small memory, quantum computing, and neuromorphic architectures.

Title: Superconducting critical temperature and dimensionality tuning of RbV$_3$Sb$_5$ via biaxial strain
Authors: Tsz Fung Poon, King Yau Yip, Ying Kit Tsui, Lingfei Wang, Kai Ham Yu, Wei Zhang, Zheyu Wang, Taketo Nakatani, Chishiro Michioka, Hiroaki Ueda, Siu Tung Lam, Kwing To Lai, Swee K. Goh
Abstract: Kagome metal AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A=K, Rb, Cs) has emerged as an intriguing platform for exploring the interplay between superconductivity and other quantum states. Among the three compounds, RbV$_3$Sb$_5$ has a notably lower superconducting critical temperature ($T_c$) at ambient pressure, posing challenges in exploring the superconducting state. For instance, the upper critical field ($H_{c2}$) is small and thus difficult to measure accurately against other control parameters. Hence, enhancing superconductivity would facilitate $H_{c2}$ measurements, providing insights into key superconducting properties such as the dimensionality. In this letter, we report the tuning of the $T_c$ in RbV$_3$Sb$_5$ through the application of biaxial strain. Utilizing a negative thermal expansion material ZrW$_2$O$_8$ as a substrate, we achieve a substantial biaxial strain of $\epsilon=1.50\%$, resulting in a remarkable 75\% enhancement in $T_c$. We investigate the $H_{c2}$ as a function of temperature, revealing a transition from multi-band to single-band superconductivity with increasing tensile strain. Additionally, we study the $H_{c2}$ as a function of field angle, revealing a plausible correlation between the $T_c$ enhancement and the change in dimensionality of the superconductivity under tensile strain. Further analysis quantitatively illustrates a transition towards two-dimensional superconductivity in RbV$_3$Sb$_5$ when subjected to tensile strain. Our work demonstrates that the application of biaxial strain allows for the tuning of both the $T_c$ and superconducting dimensionality in RbV$_3$Sb$_5$.

Title: Vibrational properties of epitaxial graphene buffer layer on silicon carbide
Authors: Guillaume Radtke (IMPMC), Michele Lazzeri (IMPMC)
Abstract: The vibrational properties of semiconducting graphene buffer layer epitaxially grown on hexagonal silicon carbide are determined using first-principles calculations on a realistic structural model. Despite the important chemical and structural disorder associated with the partial covalent bonding with the substrate, the buffer-layer carbon atoms still display quasidispersive phonons mimicking those of graphene. The related frequency softening and broadening provide a natural interpretation of the measured Raman signal. The vibrations determining thermal conduction are found to delocalize completely on the SiC substrate, leading to an effective spatial separation between material components determining, respectively, electronic and thermal transport properties. This situation opens perspectives for thermoelectric applications.

Title: Validity of generalized Gibbs ensemble in a random matrix model with a global $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetry
Authors: Adway Kumar Das
Abstract: $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry is ubiquitous in quantum mechanical systems where it drives various phase transitions and emergent physics. To understand the role of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry in the thermalization of a local observable in a disordered system, we consider random symmetric centrosymmetric (SC) matrices where the exchange symmetry is conserved. Such a conservation law splits the Hilbert space into decoupled subspaces such that the energy spectrum of a SC matrix is a superposition of two pure spectra. After discussing the known results on the correlations of such mixed spectrum, we consider different initial states and analytically compute the entire time evolution of their survival probability and associated timescales. We show that there exist certain initial states which do not decay over a very long timescales such that a measure zero fraction of random SC matrices exhibit spontaneous symmetry breaking. Later, we show that thermalization is violated for a generic local observable in case of the SC matrices, where the generalized Gibbs ensemble accurately captures the equilibrium expectation values.

Title: Crystal structures and electronic and magnetic properties of Janus bilayer Cl3Cr2I3
Authors: Suqi Liu, Feng Sun, Aijun Hong
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) magnetic material CrI3 has aroused extensive attention, because it could provide a new platform for investigating the relations between crystal structures and electronic and magnetic properties. Here, we study crystal structures and electronic and magnetic properties of three configurations (Cl-Cl I-I and Cl-I) of Janus bilayer Cl3Cr2I3 with two stacking orders (AB and AA1=3) by using the first principles approach incorporating the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effect and the dipole correction. It is found that the spin polarization and the SOC effect can expand the lattice constant and the interlayer distance (ID) of the three configurations. Especially, the ID of the I-I configuration is 1 Å larger than that of the Cl-Cl configuration. The total energy calculation results show that the atomic configuration, the SOC effect and the stacking order play an important role in determining the magnetic ground states of the Janus layers. Our results indicate the atomic configurations of the Janus bilayers are not conducive to the increase of critical temperature. Interestingly, the Cl-I configuration has a vertical dipole moment, and its AFM state has large spin splitting. It is revealed that the non-periodic structure, the symmetry breaking of the average potential and the weak interlayer interaction lead to the vertical dipole moment and the abnormal AFM state that is not the most stable state.

Title: Quantum disordered ground state and relative proximity to an exactly solvable model in the frustrated magnet CeMgAl$_{11}$O$_{19}$
Authors: G. Bastien, A. Eliáš, V. Anderle, A. Kancko, C. A. Corrêa, S. Kumar, P. Proschek, J. Prokleška, L. Nádherný, D. Sedmidubský, T. Treu, P. Gegenwart, M. Kratochvílová, M. Žonda, R. H. Colman
Abstract: The magnetic properties of the triangular magnet CeMgAl$_{11}$O$_{19}$ were investigated by magnetization and specific heat measurements down to $T=0.03\,$K on single crystals grown by the floating zone method. The formation of effective spins $S_\mathrm{eff}= 1/2$ below $T < 10$\,K was confirmed both by DFT calculations and specific heat measurements. No magnetic order was found down to $T=0.03\,$K despite the formation of magnetic correlations observed in specific heat. The measured magnetization was compared with DMRG computation and their agreement supports the proposal of a strongly anisotropic magnetic interaction antiferromagnetically coupling the spin components in the $ab$ plane and ferromagnetically coupling the spin component along the $c$ axis. However, our quantitative study of the magnetization indicates a weaker proximity to quantum criticality between ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism than the previous inelastic neutron scattering study. Finally, we propose that the absence of magnetic order in CeMgAl$_{11}$O$_{19}$ would most probably be related to the structural disorder revealed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction.

Title: High-speed quantitative nanomechanical mapping by photothermal off-resonance atomic force microscopy
Authors: Hans Gunstheimer, Gotthold Fläschner, Jonathan D. Adams, Hendrik Hölscher, Bart W. Hoogenboom
Abstract: Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is widely used to measure surface topography of solid, soft, and living matter at the nanoscale. Moreover, by mapping forces as a function of distance to the surface, AFM can provide a wealth of information beyond topography, with nanomechanical properties as a prime example. Here we present a method based on photothermal off-resonance tapping (PORT) to increase the speed of such force spectroscopy measurements by at least an order of magnitude, thereby enabling high-throughput, quantitative nanomechanical mapping of a wide range of materials. Specifically, we use photothermal actuation to modulate the position of the AFM probe at frequencies that far exceed those possible with traditional actuation by piezo-driven z scanners. Understanding and accounting for the microscale thermal and mechanical behavior of the AFM probe, we determine the resulting probe position at sufficient accuracy to allow rapid and quantitative nanomechanical examination of polymeric and metallic materials.

Title: Microcanonical simulated annealing: Massively parallel Monte Carlo simulations with sporadic random-number generation
Authors: M. Bernaschi, L.A. Fernandez, I. González-Adalid Pemartín, E. Marinari, V. Martin-Mayor, G. Parisi, F. Ricci-Tersenghi, J.J. Ruiz-Lorenzo, D. Yllanes
Abstract: Numerical simulations of models and theories that describe complex experimental systems $\unicode{x2014}$in fields like high-energy and condensed-matter physics$\unicode{x2014}$ are becoming increasingly important. Examples include lattice gauge theories, which can describe, among others, quantum chromodynamics (the Standard Model description of strong interactions between elementary particles), and spin-glass systems. Beyond fundamental research, these computational methods also find practical applications, among many others, in optimization, finance, and complex biological problems. However, Monte Carlo simulations, an important subcategory of these methods, are plagued by a major drawback: they are extremely greedy for (pseudo) random numbers. The total fraction of computer time dedicated to random-number generation increases as the hardware grows more sophisticated, and can get prohibitive for special-purpose computing platforms. We propose here a general-purpose microcanonical simulated annealing (this http URL) formalism that dramatically reduces such a burden. The algorithm is fully adapted to a massively parallel computation, as we show in the particularly demanding benchmark of the three-dimensional Ising spin glass. We carry out very stringent numerical tests of the new algorithm by comparing our results, obtained on GPUs, with high-precision standard (i.e., random-number-greedy) simulations performed on the Janus II custom-built supercomputer. In those cases where thermal equilibrium is reachable (i.e., in the paramagnetic phase), both simulations reach compatible values. More significantly, barring short-time corrections, a simple time rescaling suffices to map the this http URL off-equilibrium dynamics onto the results obtained with standard simulations.

Title: Mesoscale FEM Model of Concrete: Statistical Assessment of Inherent Stress Concentrations in Dependence on Phase Heterogeneity
Authors: Jan Mašek (1 and 2), Petr Miarka (1 and 2) ((1) Institute of Physics of Materials, Czech Academy of Sciences, Brno, Czech Republic (2) Institute of Structural Mechanics, Faculty of Civil Engineering, Brno University of Technology, Brno, Czech Republic)
Abstract: Concrete heterogeneity originates from its production process, which involves bonding aggregates with a binder matrix. This study presents a mesoscale finite element model (MFEM) that offers detailed insights into the fracture process at the aggregate-cement matrix interface, focusing on one of concrete's key properties: its mechanical response. Unlike discrete models, which often average out critical stress concentrations within the mesostructure, the MFEM approach captures detailed stress distributions, revealing localized effects crucial for understanding damage evolution. Although computationally more demanding, the MFEM leverages modern high-performance computing (HPC) to provide a detailed description of the stress field and material damage across different phases and interfaces. Various matrix-to-aggregate stiffness ratios are considered to evaluate the influence of material heterogeneity on the stress field. The results are based on a statistical evaluation of stress concentrations arising from variations in material stiffness. The model is applied to investigate the impact of using recycled crushed bricks as aggregates in concrete, with particular emphasis on the stiffness mismatch between the matrix and aggregates. The study examines how this stiffness contrast affects stress distribution and ultimately influences the composite's failure mechanisms.

Title: Nano-silica based Aqueous Colloidal Gels as Eco-friendly Thixotropic Lubricant
Authors: Arun Kumar, Vivek Kumar, Yogesh M. Joshi, Manjesh K. Singh
Abstract: The environmental risks posed by traditional oil and grease-based lubricants can be significantly mitigated by adopting water-based alternatives engineered with superior rheological performance. In this work, we present a fundamentally new and environmentally sustainable aqueous thixotropic colloidal gel of silica nanoparticles formed in the presence of NaCl. We conducted a systematic and detailed investigation of their rheological and tribological characteristics. The tribological performance was evaluated against dry and water-lubricated conditions for steel-steel interface. Our experiments demonstrate that the tribological performance of the formulated nanoparticle gel can be optimized by tuning its rheological properties. A combination of super-low friction and negligible wear was observed. The friction coefficient reduced by up to 97.46% (from 0.63 to 0.016) compared to dry sliding, and by 97.04% (from 0.541 to 0.016) compared to water lubrication. Similarly, the specific wear rate decreased by up to 99.62% and 96.10% under dry conditions and water lubrication respectively. This performance is attributed to a thixotropic, chemically robust gel formed via van der Waals interactions between silica flocs, enabling self-repairing properties, continuous tribo-film formation, and a nano-bearing effect from silica nanoparticles. These attributes enable the gel to maintain and regain its structure during periods of non-shear while also forming a thin film with sufficiently low viscosity to slip into the interfacial contact zone and continuously replenish it with lubricant.

Title: Correcting systematic errors in the likelihood optimization of underdamped Langevin models of molecular dynamics trajectories
Authors: David Daniel Girardier, Hadrien Vroylandt, Sara Bonella, Fabio Pietrucci
Abstract: Since Kramers' pioneering work in 1940, significant efforts have been devoted to studying Langevin equations applied to physical and chemical reactions projected onto few collective variables, with particular focus on the inference of their parameters. While the inference for overdamped Langevin equations is well-established and widely applied, a notable gap remains in the literature for underdamped Langevin equations, which incorporate inertial effects and velocities. This gap arises from the challenge of accessing velocities solely through finite differences of positions, resulting in spurious correlations. In this letter, we propose an analytical correction for these correlations, specifically designed for a likelihood-maximization algorithm that exploits short, non-ergodic trajectories that can be obtained at reasonable numerical cost. The accuracy and robustness of our approach are tested across a benchmark case and a realistic system. This work paves the way for applying generalized Langevin equation inference to chemical reactions.

Title: Full-Gap Superconductivity in BaAs/Ferropnictide Heterostructures
Authors: Ming-Qiang Ren, Qiang-Jun Cheng, Hui-Hui He, Ze-Xian Deng, Fang-Jun Cheng, Yong-Wei Wang, Cong-Cong Lou, Qinghua Zhang, Lin Gu, Kai Liu, Xu-Cun Ma, Qi-Kun Xue, Can-Li Song
Abstract: Interfacial interactions often promote the emergence of unusual phenomena in two-dimensional systems, including high-temperature superconductivity. Here, we report the observation of full-gap superconductivity with a maximal spectroscopic temperature up to 26 K in a BaAs monolayer grown on ferropnictide Ba(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$)$_2$As$_2$ (abbreviated as BFCA) epitaxial films. The superconducting gap remains robust even when the thickness of underlying BFCA is reduced to the monolayer limit, in contrast to the rapid suppression of $T_\textrm{c}$ in standalone BFCA thin films. We reveal that the exceptional crystallinity of the BaAs/BFCA heterostructures, featured by their remarkable electronic and geometric uniformities, is crucial for the emergent full-gap superconductivity with mean-field temperature dependence and pronounced bound states within magnetic vortices. Our findings open up new avenues to unravel the mysteries of unconventional superconductivity in ferropnictides and advance the development of FeAs-based heterostructures.

Title: Atomic-scale imaging of electronic nematicity in ferropnictides
Authors: Qiang-Jun Cheng, Yong-Wei Wang, Ming-Qiang Ren, Ze-Xian Deng, Cong-Cong Lou, Xu-Cun Ma, Qi-Kun Xue, Can-Li Song
Abstract: Electronic nematicity, a correlated state characterized by broken rotational symmetry, has been recognized as a ubiquitous feature intertwined with unconventional electron pairing in various iron-based superconductors. Here we employ spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunneling microscopy to visualize atomic-scale electronic nematicity directly on FeAs planes of a prototypical ferropnictide BaFe$_2$As$_2$. Spatially, the nematic order appears as 4$a_{\textrm{Fe}}$-spaced stripes ($a_{\textrm{Fe}} \sim $ 0.28 nm is the in-plane Fe-Fe distance) within homogeneously and orthogonally oriented nano-domains. The energy-resolved conductance maps reveal a pronounced energy-dependence of the nematic order parameter that experiences a sign change at approximately 30 meV. This characteristic behavior coincides with energy-dependent orbital splitting previously identified in momentum space, but is remarkably visualized in real space for the first time in our study. Moreover, the electronic nematicity exhibits pronounced sensitivity to single impurities and is notably suppressed by cobalt substitution for Fe atoms, promoting optimal superconductivity when nematic fluctuations are strongest. Our results provide pivotal experimental insights for developing a microscopic model of nematic order, thus paving the way to study its complex relationship with unconventional superconductivity.

Title: Universally enhanced superconductivity and coexisting ferroelectricity at oxide interfaces
Authors: Meng Zhang, Ming Qin, Yanqiu Sun, Siyuan Hong, Yanwu Xie
Abstract: The coexistence of superconductivity and ferroelectricity is rare due to their conflicting requirements: superconductivity relies on free charge carriers, whereas ferroelectricity typically occurs in insulating systems. At LaAlO3/KTaO3 interfaces, we demonstrate the coexistence of two-dimensional superconductivity and ferroelectricity, enabled by the unique properties of KTaO3 as a quantum paraelectric. Systematic gating and poling experiments reveal a universal enhancement of the superconducting transition temperature (Tc) by 0.2-0.6 K and bistable transport properties, including hysteresis, strongly suggesting the existence of switchable ferroelectric polarization in the interfacial conducting layer. Hysteresis loops indicate robust ferroelectricity below 50 K. The Tc enhancement is attributed to ferroelectric polarization-induced reduction in dielectric constant, which narrows the interfacial potential well, confining carriers closer to the interface. The bistability arises from switchable ferroelectric polarization, which modulates the potential well depending on polarization direction. These findings establish a straightforward mechanism coupling ferroelectricity and superconductivity, providing a promising platform for exploring their interplay.

Title: Endoreversible Stirling cycles: plasma engines at maximal power
Authors: Gregory Behrendt, Sebastian Deffner
Abstract: Endoreversible engine cycles are a cornerstone of finite-time thermodynamics. We show that endoreversible Stirling engines operating with a one-component plasma as working medium run at maximal power output with the Curzon-Ahlborn efficiency. As a main result, we elucidate that this is actually a consequence of the fact that the caloric equation of state depends only linearly on temperature and only additively on volume. In particular, neither the exact form of the mechanical equation of state, nor the full fundamental relation are required. Thus, our findings immediately generalize to a larger class of working plasmas, far beyond simple ideal gases. In addition, we show that for plasmas described by the photonic equation of state the efficiency is significantly lower. This is in stark contrast to endoreversible Otto cycles, for which photonic engines have an efficiency larger than the Curzon-Ahlborn efficiency.

Title: Quantum dynamical signatures of non-Hermitian boundary modes
Authors: Fan Yang, Maria Zelenayova, Paolo Molignini, Emil J. Bergholtz
Abstract: The non-Hermitian bulk-boundary correspondence features an interplay between the non-Hermitian skin effect and anomalous boundary-mode behavior. Whereas the skin effect is known to manifest itself in quantum dynamics in the form of chiral damping, it has remained less clear what impact the boundary modes may have. Here we derive experimentally accessible signatures of the boundary modes. We also establish clear criteria, based on the effective generalized Brillouin zone, that determine when bulk and boundary effects can be dynamically discerned using the Liouvillian separation gap. This leads to telltale signatures in both stable regimes -- where particle number remains finite -- and in the unstable regimes -- where a macroscopic boundary mode population occurs.

Title: Statistical theory of charged particle systems including triple bound states -- and the Collaboration Lviv-Rostock
Authors: W. Ebeling
Abstract: Honoring the hundredth anniversary of the birthday of Ihor R. Yuknovskii we analyze new developments in the statistical thermodynamics of Coulomb systems. The basic idea of this work is to demonstrate that the exponential potential used in the first papers of Yukhnovskii is an appropriate reference system for a description of classical and quantum charged particle systems. We briefly discuss the collaboration between the groups of Ihor R. Yuknovskii in Lviv and Günter Kelbg in Rostock and analyze several approaches based on pair correlation functions and cluster expansion in the classical as well as in the quantum case. Finally, we discuss the progress in the statistical description of bound states of three particles as in helium plasmas and in MgCl$_2$-solutions in the classical case and present new results regarding the influence of three-particle bound states. In particular, we give new expressions for the cluster integrals and the mass action functions of helium atoms and ionic triple associates as well as for the equation of state (EoS).

Title: Preferred Synthesis of Armchair SnS2 Nanotubes

Abstract: In this work, we present the synthesis of tin disulfide (SnS2) nanotubes (NTs) with preferred chiral angle. A sacrificial template is used to create channels of boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) with an optimized diameter of 4-5 nm, inside of which SnS2 NTs are formed with the high yield and structural purity. Atomic resolution imaging and nano-area electron diffraction reveal that these synthesized SnS2 NTs prefer to have an armchair configuration with a probability of approximately 85%. Calculations using density functional theory (DFT) reveal a negligible difference in the formation energy between armchair and zigzag NTs, suggesting that structural stability does not play a key role in this chirality-selective growth. However, a detailed TEM investigation revealed that some SnS2 nanoribbons are found connected to the ends of SnS2 NTs, and that these nanoribbons primarily have a zigzag configuration. Subsequent DFT and machine learning potential molecular dynamic simulations verify that nanoribbons with zigzag configurations are more stable than armchair ones, and indeed zigzag nanoribbons aligned along the BNNT axis tend to roll up to form an armchair SnS2 NTs. Finally, this "zigzag nanoribbon to armchair nanotube" transition hypothesis is verified by in-situ high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, in which the transformation of SnS2 nanoribbons into a nanotube is reproduced in real time. This work is the first demonstration of preferred-chirality growth of transition metal dichalcogenide nanotubes.

Title: The many faces of rotating quantum turbulence
Authors: Julian Amette Estrada, Marc E. Brachet, Pablo D. Mininni
Abstract: Quantum turbulence shares many similarities with classical turbulence in the isotropic and homogeneous case, despite the inviscid and quantized nature of its vortices. However, when quantum fluids are subjected to rotation, their turbulent dynamics depart significantly from the classical expectations. We explore the phenomenology of rotating quantum turbulence, emphasizing how rotation introduces new regimes with no classical analogs. We review recent theoretical, experimental, and numerical developments, and present new numerical results that map out distinct dynamical regimes arising from the interplay of rotation, quantization, non-linearities, and condensed matter regimes. In particular, we show the importance of distinguishing the dynamics of rotating quantum fluids in the slowly rotating, rapidly rotating, and low Landau level regimes. The findings have implications for the dynamics of liquid helium, atomic Bose-Einstein condensates, and neutron stars, and show how rotating quantum fluids can serve as a unique platform bridging turbulence theory and condensed matter physics revealing novel states of out-of-equilibrium quantum matter.

Title: Orbital Order and Superconductivity in Bilayer Nickelate Compounds
Authors: Giniyat Khaliullin, Jiří Chaloupka
Abstract: We propose a theory for bilayer nickelate materials, where a large tetragonal field - intrinsic or induced by epitaxial strain - lifts the orbital degeneracy and localizes the $3z^2-r^2$ orbital states. These states host local spins $S=1/2$ bound into singlets by strong interlayer coupling, and their dynamics is described by weakly dispersive singlet-triplet excitations ("triplons"). The charge carriers occupy the wide bands of $x^2-y^2$ symmetry, and their Cooper pairing is mediated by the high-energy triplon excitations. As the $x^2-y^2$ band filling increases, i.e. moving further away from the Ni$^{3+}$ valence state, the indirect Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interactions between local spins induce spin-density-wave order via triplon condensation. Implications of the model for compressively strained La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ films and electron doped oxychloride Sr$_3$Ni$_2$O$_5$Cl$_2$ are discussed.

Title: Superconductivity in the spin-state crossover materials: Nickelates with planar-coordinated low-spin Ni$^{2+}$ ions
Authors: Jiří Chaloupka, Giniyat Khaliullin
Abstract: We theoretically study quasi-two-dimensional nickel compounds, where the nickel ions assume Ni$^{2+}$ $d^8$ valence state and feature a low-spin $S=0$ ground state quasidegenerate with $S=1$ ionic excitations. Such a level structure is supported by square-planar coordination of nickel ions or a suitable substitution of apical oxygens. We construct the corresponding singlet-triplet exchange model and explore its phase diagram and excitation spectrum. By hole doping, we further introduce mobile Ni$^{3+}$ $d^7$ ionic configurations with effective spins $S=1/2$, and analyze their interactions with the $d^8$ singlet-triplet background. The interplay with the triplet excitations in the $d^8$ sector is found to have a deep impact on the propagation of the doped hole-like charge carriers and is identified as a powerful source of Cooper pairing among them.

Title: Real-space visualization of orbital-selective superconductivity in FeSe
Authors: Sang Yong Song, Gábor B. Halász, Jiaqiang Yan, Benjamin J. Lawrie, Petro Maksymovych
Abstract: We investigate the orbitally resolved superconducting properties of bulk FeSe using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). We find that the spectral weights of both the large $\Delta_1$ and small $\Delta_2$ superconducting gaps remain nearly unchanged at the top Se sites as the STM tip approaches atomic contact. In contrast, the spectral weight of $\Delta_2$ increases significantly at the Fe and bottom Se sites. These results suggest that the gap $\Delta_2$ is localized in the xy-plane and likely associated with the dxy orbital band. Furthermore, we observe a long-range suppression of the large gap $\Delta_1$ near one-dimensional (1D) defects such as twin boundaries, wrinkles, and step edges, whereas $\Delta_2$ remains robust. This indicates that the two superconducting gaps respond differently to such 1D defects. High-resolution measurement using a Pb-coated tip reveals localized in-gap states near 1D defects, indicating possible defect-induced magnetism. Our findings highlight the contrasting behaviors of gap $\Delta_1$ and gap $\Delta_2$ in response to local electronic and magnetic environments and provide real-space evidence for orbital-selective superconductivity.

Title: From toroids to helical tubules: Kirigami-inspired programmable assembly of two-periodic curved crystals
Authors: Mason Price, Daichi Hayakawa, Thomas E. Videbæk, Rupam Saha, Botond Tyukodi, Michael F. Hagan, Seth Fraden, Gregory M. Grason, W. Benjamin Rogers
Abstract: Biology is full of intricate molecular structures whose geometries are inextricably linked to their function. Many of these structures exhibit varying curvature, such as the helical structure of the bacterial flagellum, which is critical for their motility. Because synthetic analogues of these shapes could be valuable platforms for nanotechnologies, including drug delivery and plasmonics, controllable synthesis of variable-curvature structures of various material systems, from fullerenes to supramolecular assemblies, has been a long-standing goal. Like two-dimensional crystals, these structures have a two-periodic symmetry, but unlike standard two-dimensional crystals, they are embedded in three dimensions with complex, spatially-varying curvatures that cause the structures to close upon themselves in one or more dimensions. Here, we develop and implement a design strategy to program the self-assembly of a complex spectrum of two-periodic curved crystals with variable periodicity, spatial dimension, and topology, spanning from toroids to achiral serpentine tubules to both left- and right-handed helical tubules. Our design strategy uses a kirigami-based mapping of 2D planar tilings to 3D curved crystals that preserves the periodicity, two-fold rotational symmetries, and subunit dimensions via the arrangement of disclination defects. We survey the modular geometry of these curved crystals and infer the addressable subunit interactions required to assemble them from triangular subunits. To demonstrate this design strategy, we program the self-assembly of toroids, helical- and serpentine-tubules from DNA origami subunits. A simulation model of the assembly pathways reveals physical considerations for programming the geometric specificity of angular folds in the curved crystal required to avoid defect-mediated misassembly.

Title: Pseudocriticality in antiferromagnetic spin chains
Authors: Sankalp Kumar, Sumiran Pujari, Jonathan D'Emidio
Abstract: Weak first-order pseudocriticality with approximate scale invariance has been observed in a variety of settings, including the intriguing case of deconfined criticality in 2+1 dimensions. Recently, this has been interpreted as extremely slow flows ("walking behavior") for real-valued couplings in proximity to a bona fide critical point with complex-valued couplings, described by a complex conformal field theory (CFT). Here we study an SU($N$) generalization of the the Heisenberg antiferromagnet, which is a familiar model for deconfined criticality in 2+1 dimensions. We show that in 1+1 dimensions the model is located near a complex CFT, whose proximity can be tuned as a function of $N$. We employ state-of-the-art quantum Monte Carlo simulations for continuous $N$ along with an improved loop estimator for the Rényi entanglement entropy based on a nonequilibrium work protocol. These techniques allow us to track the central charge of this model in detail as a function of $N$, where we observe excellent agreement with CFT predictions. Notably, this includes the region $N>2$, where the CFT moves into the complex plane and pseudocritical drifts enable us to recover the real part of the complex central charge with remarkable accuracy. Since the present model with $N=3$ is also equivalent to the spin-1 biquadratic model, our work sheds new light on the dimerized phase of the spin-1 chain, demonstrating that it is pseudocritical and proximate to a complex CFT.

Title: Unraveling the nature of excitons in the 2D magnetic semiconductor CrSBr

Abstract: Excitonic effects dominate the optoelectronic properties of van der Waals semiconductors, a characteristic equally true for recently discovered 2D magnetic semiconductors. This brings new possibilities for investigating fundamental interactions between excitons and a correlated spin environment, particularly pronounced in CrSBr. Here, we demonstrate that CrSBr hosts both localised Frenkel-like and delocalised Wannier-Mott-like excitons a duality rare among other magnetic or nonmagnetic 2D materials. Our combined theoretical and experimental high magnetic field studies reveal that these two exciton types exhibit strikingly different responses to magnetic and lattice perturbations. We show that the high-energy exciton (XB) is an order of magnitude more sensitive to magnetic order changes than XA, establishing XB as a highly effective optical probe of the magnetic state. The presented self-consistent many-body perturbation theory provides detailed insight into their electronic and spatial structure, quantitatively explaining the observed differences, based on their relative Wannier-Mott and Frenkel characters. By probing the diamagnetic response in magnetic fields up to 85 T, we estimate the relative spatial extent of the two excitons, with results aligning well with the predictions of our many-body perturbation theory. Furthermore, we observe exceptionally distinct coupling of the two excitons to lattice vibrations: a strong temperature dependent redshift for XB between antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic phases, which is almost temperature-invariant for XA. This is attributed to XBs tendency for out-of-plane delocalisation in the FM phase, leading to enhanced coupling with Ag phonon modes. These findings provide a detailed microscopic understanding of both types of excitons and their distinct magneto-exciton coupling.

Title: Excluded volume effect of surfactant ligands on the shape of nascent nanocrystal
Authors: A. Baumketner, D. Anokhin, Ya. Patsahan
Abstract: We investigate the effect of the excluded volume of surfactant ligands on the shape of incipient quantum dots (QDs) to which they are attached. We consider a model in which ligands are represented by hard-sphere particles that are bound to the surface of a nanoparticle (NC) that is cast in the shape of a prism. It is found in Monte Carlo simulations that the ensemble of relevant NC conformations consists of a small number of specific states that take on the form of nanoplates and nanorods. The shape of these states can be well described by the derived theoretical models. At increasing ligand density, the free energy of different states is seen to be approximately the same, suggesting that excluded volume interactions among ligands acts to narrow down the conformational space accessible to an NC without creating a statistical preference for any particular configuration.

Title: Method of canonical transformations in the theory of quantum gases interacting with radiation
Authors: M. S. Bulakhov, A. S. Peletminskii, P. P. Kostrobij, I. A. Ryzha, Yu. V. Slyusarenko
Abstract: An approach to the theoretical study of effects and phenomena in quantum gases interacting with radiation is proposed. The approach is based on a modification of the canonical transformation method, which was once used to diagonalize Hamiltonians describing the interaction of electrons with phonons in a solid. The capabilities of the method are demonstrated by studying the influence of photons on the spectral characteristics of atoms of quantum gases interacting with radiation. Within the framework of the developed approach, the effect of "dressing" atoms of quantum gases by a cloud of virtual photons is investigated and expressions for the energy characteristics of such dressed atoms - quasiparticles are obtained. The problem of defining the concept of the effective mass of such quasiparticles is discussed.

Title: A General Framework for Linking Free and Forced Fluctuations via Koopmanism
Authors: Valerio Lucarini, Manuel Santos Gutierrez, John Moroney, Niccolò Zagli
Abstract: The link between forced and free fluctuations for nonequilibrium systems can be described via a generalized version of the celebrated fluctuation-dissipation theorem. The use of the formalism of the Koopman operator makes it possible to deliver an intepretable form of the response operators written as a sum of exponentially decaying terms, each associated one-to-one with a mode of natural variability of the system. Here we showcase on a stochastically forced version of the celebrated Lorenz '63 model the feasibility and skill of such an approach by considering different Koopman dictionaries, which allows us to treat also seamlessly coarse-graining approaches like the Ulam method. Our findings provide support for the development of response theory-based investigation methods also in an equation-agnostic, data-driven environment.

Title: Antiferromagnetism and Tightly Bound Cooper Pairs Induced by Kinetic Frustration
Authors: Yixin Zhang, Cristian Batista, Yang Zhang
Abstract: Antiferromagnetism and superconductivity are often viewed as competing orders in correlated electron systems. Here, we demonstrate that kinetic frustration in hole motion facilitates their coexistence within the square-lattice repulsive Hubbard model. Combining exact analytical solutions on tailored geometries with large-scale numerical simulations, we reveal a robust pairing mechanism: holes on opposite sublattices behave as if they carry opposite effective charges due to spin singlet formation from kinetic frustration. This emergent property suppresses phase separation and fosters a coherent $d$-wave superconducting channel embedded within a long-range antiferromagnetic background. Our findings establish a minimal yet broadly applicable framework for stabilizing strong-coupling superconductivity in doped Mott insulators.

Title: Compressibility measurement of the thermal MI--BG transition in an optical lattice
Authors: Phil Russ, Mi Yan, Nicholas Kowalski, Laura Wadleigh, Vito W. Scarola, Brian DeMarco
Abstract: Disorder can be applied to transform conducting to insulating states by localizing individual quantum particles. The interplay between disorder and interactions in many-particle systems leads to a richer tapestry of quantum phase transitions. Here, we report the measurement in an ultracold lattice gas of a disorder-induced transition from a state with small disorder-independent compressibility to a state for which compressibility increases with disorder. At zero temperature this is the transition from a Mott insulator (MI) to a Bose glass (BG), both of which are insulating states. This transformation is observed using measurements of core compressibility. By determining how double occupancy changes with atom number, we identify the threshold disorder strength required to switch from disorder-independent MI-like to disorder-dependent BG-like compressible behavior.

Title: Jamming as a topological satisfiability transition with contact number hyperuniformity and criticality
Authors: Jin Shang, Yinqiao Wang, Deng Pan, Yuliang Jin, Jie Zhang
Abstract: The jamming transition between flow and amorphous-solid states exhibits paradoxical properties characterized by hyperuniformity (suppressed spatial fluctuations) and criticality (hyperfluctuations), whose origin remains unclear. Here we model the jamming transition by a topological satisfiability transition in a minimum network model with simultaneously hyperuniform distributions of contacts, diverging length scales and scale-free clusters. We show that these phenomena stem from isostaticity and mechanical stability: the former imposes a global equality, and the latter local inequalities on arbitrary sub-systems. This dual constraint bounds contact number fluctuations from both above and below, limiting them to scale with the surface area. The hyperuniform and critical exponents of the network model align with those of frictionless jamming, suggesting a new universality class of non-equilibrium phase transitions. Our results provide a minimal, dynamics-independent framework for jamming criticality and hyperuniformity in disordered systems.

Title: Nucleation and propagation of fracture in viscoelastic elastomers: A complete phase-field theory
Authors: Farhad Kamarei, Evan Breedlove, Oscar Lopez-Pamies
Abstract: This paper presents a macroscopic theory, alongside its numerical implementation, aimed at describing, explaining, and predicting the nucleation and propagation of fracture in viscoelastic materials subjected to quasistatic loading conditions. The focus is on polymers, in particular, on elastomers. To this end, the starting point of this work is devoted to summarizing the large body of experimental results on how elastomers deform, nucleate cracks, and propagate cracks when subjected to mechanical loads. When viewed collectively, the experiments make it plain that there are three basic ingredients that any attempt at a complete macroscopic theory of fracture in elastomers ought to account for: i) the viscoelasticity of the elastomer; ii) its strength; and iii) its fracture energy. A theory is then introduced that accounts for all these three basic ingredients by extending the phase-field theory initiated by Kumar, Francfort, and Lopez-Pamies (J. Mech. Phys. Solids 112 (2018), 523--551) for elastic brittle materials to seamlessly incorporate viscous energy dissipation by deformation, a generalized strength surface that is a hypersurface in stress-deformation space (and not just in stress space as for elastic brittle materials), and the pertinent Griffith criticality condition for materials that dissipate energy not just by the creation of surface but also by deformation, in this case, by viscous deformation (Shrimali and Lopez-Pamies (2023) Extreme Mech. Lett. 58, 101944). From an applications point of view, the proposed theory amounts to solving an initial-boundary-value problem comprised of two nonlinear PDEs coupled with a nonlinear ODE for the deformation field, a tensorial internal variable, and the phase field. A robust scheme is presented to generate solutions for these equations.

Title: Transfer-matrix approach to the Blume-Capel model on the triangular lattice
Authors: Dimitrios Mataragkas, Alexandros Vasilopoulos, Nikolaos G. Fytas, Dong-Hee Kim
Abstract: We investigate the spin-$1$ Blume-Capel model on an infinite strip of the triangular lattice using the transfer-matrix method combined with a sparse-matrix factorization technique. Through finite-size scaling analysis of numerically exact spectra for strip widths up to $L = 19$, we accurately locate the tricritical point improving upon recent Monte Carlo estimates. In the first-order regime, we observe exponential scaling of the spectral gap, reflecting the linear growth of interfacial tension as the temperature decreases below the tricritical point. Finally, we validate our tricritical point estimate through precise agreement with conformal field theory predictions for the tricritical Ising universality class. Our results underscore the continued utility of the transfer-matrix approach for studying phase transitions in complex lattice models.

Title: Lattice-dependent orientational order in active crystals
Authors: Till Welker, Ricard Alert
Abstract: Via mechanisms not accessible at equilibrium, self-propelled particles can form phases with positional order, such as crystals, and with orientational order, such as polar flocks. However, the interplay between these two types of order remains relatively unexplored. Here, we address this point by studying crystals of active particles that turn either towards or away from each other, which can be experimentally realised with phoretic or Janus colloids or with elastically-coupled walker robots. We show that, depending on how these interactions vary with interparticle distance, the particles align along directions determined by the underlying crystalline lattice. To explain the results, we map the orientational dynamics of the active crystal onto a lattice of spins that interact via (anti-)ferromagnetic alignment with each other plus nematic alignment with the lattice directions. Our findings indicate that orientational and positional order can be strongly coupled in active crystals, thus suggesting strategies to control orientational order by engineering the underlying crystalline lattice.

Title: Mixed phases in a Fermi--Hubbard model describing altermagnetism
Authors: E. Langmann, J. Lenells
Abstract: We study an extension of the 2D Fermi--Hubbard model, which was recently introduced in [Das et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 132, 263402 (2024)] and shown to describe altermagnetism that can be studied in cold atom systems. Using an updated Hartree--Fock method that can detect instabilities towards phase separation, we show that the model is in a mixed phase in large parts of the parameter regime at half-filling. We argue that the occurrence of a mixed phase is an indication of exotic physics which, in this model, occurs in parameter regimes accessible in cold atom experiments.

Title: Superconductivity in a Chern band: effect of time-reversal-symmetry breaking on superconductivity
Authors: Bernhard E. Lüscher, Mark H. Fischer
Abstract: Time-reversal-symmetry breaking is generally understood to be detrimental for superconductivity. However, recent experiments found superconductivity emerging out of a normal state showing a finite anomalous Hall effect, indicative of time-reversal-symmetry breaking, in diverse systems from kagome metals, $1T'$-WS$_2$, to twisted MoTe$_2$ and rhombohedral graphene. Motivated by these findings, we study the stability of superconducting orders and the mechanisms that suppress superconductivity in the prototypical anomalous Hall system, the Haldane model, where complex hopping parameters result in loop-current order with a compensated flux pattern. We find that neither spin-singlet nor spin-triplet states are generically suppressed, but the real-space sublattice structure plays a crucial role in the stability of the orders. Interestingly, the nearest-neighbor chiral states of $d\pm id$ or $p\pm i p$ symmetry couple linearly to the flux, such that the two otherwise degenerate chiralities split under finite flux. As an experimental probe to distinguish the various orders in this system, we study the anomalous thermal Hall effect, $\kappa_{xy} / T$, which vanishes at zero temperature for topologically trivial superconducting states, but reaches a finite value corresponding to the Chern number in a topologically non-trivial superconducting state. Our results illustrate that broken time-reversal symmetry through a finite flux is neither generically destructive for superconductivity, nor does it imply non-trivial topological order of the emerging superconducting state. However, in the case of multiple competing pairing channels, the loop-current order can favor a chiral superconducting state.

Title: Formation of ultracold $^{39}$K$^{133}$Cs Feshbach molecules
Authors: Charly Beulenkamp, Krzysztof P. Zamarski, Robert C. Bird, C. Ruth Le Sueur, Jeremy M. Hutson, Manuele Landini, Hanns-Christoph Nägerl
Abstract: We report the creation of an ultracold gas of bosonic $^{39}$K$^{133}$Cs molecules. We first demonstrate a cooling strategy relying on sympathetic cooling of $^{133}$Cs to produce an ultracold mixture. From this mixture, weakly bound molecules are formed using a Feshbach resonance at 361.7 G. The molecular gas contains $7.6(10)\times 10^3$ molecules with a lifetime of about 130 ms, limited by two-body decay. We perform Feshbach spectroscopy to observe several new interspecies resonances and characterize the bound state used for magnetoassociation. Finally, we fit the combined results to obtain improved K-Cs interaction potentials. This provides a good starting point for the creation of ultracold samples of ground-state $^{39}$K$^{133}$Cs molecules.

Title: Ultrastable jammed sphere packings with a wide range of particle dispersities
Authors: Robert S. Hoy
Abstract: We show that for a standard continuously-polydisperse model with particle-diameter distribution $P(\sigma) \propto \sigma^{-3}$ and polydispersity index $\Delta$, employing a combination of standard SWAP moves and transient degree of freedom (TDOF) moves during a Lubachevsky-Stillinger-like particle-growth process dramatically increases the generated packings' jamming densities $\phi_{\rm J}(\Delta)$ and coordination numbers $Z_{\rm J}(\Delta)$, for a wide range of $\Delta$. We find that the fractional increase in $\phi_{\rm J}(\Delta)$ obtained by employing these moves first increases rapidly with $\Delta$, then plateaus at $6-7\%$ over the range $0.10 \lesssim \Delta \leq 50$; the obtained $\phi_{\rm J}$ are as high as $0.747$ (for $\Delta = 0.50$). These density increases are achieved without producing crystallization or fractionation. SWAP and TDOF moves also reduce packings' rattler populations by as much as 96% and increase their bulk moduli by as much as 154%.

Title: Thin active nematohydrodynamic layers: asymptotic theories and instabilities
Authors: Mehrana R. Nejad
Abstract: Starting from a three-dimensional description of an active nematic layer, we employ an asymptotic theory to derive a series of low-dimensional continuum models that capture the coupled dynamics of flat and curved films, including variations in film thickness, shape deformations, internal velocity fields, and the dynamics of orientational order. Using this asymptotic theory, we investigate instabilities driven by activity in both the nematic and isotropic phases for cylindrical and flat films. In the flat case, we demonstrate that incorporating shape and thickness variations fundamentally alters the bend and splay nature of instabilities compared to conventional two dimensional nematic instabilities. In the isotropic phase, we find that both extensile and contractile activity can induce nematic order, in contrast with active nematics on fixed surfaces, where only extensile activity leads to ordering. For the case of curved geometries such as a cylindrical film, we reveal that thickness and shape instabilities are inherently coupled. In the isotropic phase, the emergence of nematic order triggers both thickness and shape instabilities. In the nematic phase, contractile activity induces thickness instabilities, which in turn drive geometric deformations. Our results highlight the crucial interplay between activity, thickness variations, and curvature, providing new insights into the behavior of active nematic films beyond the conventional two dimensional paradigm that has been studied to date.

Title: Update of Hartree--Fock theory for Hubbard-like models
Authors: E. Langmann, J. Lenells
Abstract: We show that the standard textbook description of (restricted) Hartree--Fock theory for (Fermi) Hubbard-like models is in need of an update, and we present such an update allowing us to correct basic and established results in the condensed matter physics literature that are qualitatively wrong. Our update amounts to adding a test which reliably checks the thermodynamic stability of solutions of Hartree--Fock equations. This stability test makes it possible to detect, by simple means and with certainty, regions in phase space where the model exhibits mixed phases where two conventional phases coexist and translation invariance is broken in complicated ways; in such a mixed phase, unconventional physics is to be expected. Our results show that mixed phases are ubiquitous in Hubbard-like models in arbitrary dimensions.

Title: Mott metal-insulator transition in a modified periodic Anderson model: Insights from entanglement entropy and role of short-range spatial correlations
Authors: Ankur Majumder, Sudeshna Sen
Abstract: The Mott-Hubbard metal-insulator transition is a paradigmatic phenomenon where Coulomb interactions between electrons drive a metal-insulator phase transition. It has been extensively studied within the Hubbard model, where a quantum critical transition occurs at a finite temperature second-order critical point. This work investigates the Mott metal-insulator transition in a modified periodic Anderson model that may be viewed as a three-orbital lattice model including an interacting, localized orbital coupled to a delocalized conduction orbital via a second conduction orbital. This model could also be viewed as a bilayer model involving a conventional periodic Anderson model layer coupled to a metallic layer. Within the dynamical mean field theory, this model possesses a strictly zero temperature quantum critical point separating a Fermi liquid and a Mott insulating phase. By employing a simplified version of the dynamical mean field theory, namely, the two-site or linearized dynamical mean field theory, we provide an analytical estimate of the critical parameter strengths at which the transition occurs at zero temperature. We also provide an analytical estimate of the single-site von Neumann entanglement entropy. This measure can be used as a robust identifier for the phase transition. We extend these calculations to their cluster version to incorporate short-range, non-local spatial correlations and discuss their effects on the transition observed in this model.

Title: Crystal Nucleation Kinetics and Mechanism: Influence of Interaction Potential
Authors: Porhouy Minh, Steven W. Hall, Ryan S. DeFever, Sapna Sarupria
Abstract: Modulating liquid-to-solid transitions and the resulting crystalline structure for tailored properties is much desired. Colloidal systems are exemplary to this end, but the fundamental knowledge gaps in relating the influence of intermolecular interactions to crystallization behavior continue to hinder progress. In this study, we address this knowledge gap by studying nucleation and growth in systems with modified Lennard-Jones potential. Specifically, we study the commonly used 12-6 potential and a softer 7-6 potential. The thermodynamic state point for the study is chosen such that both systems are investigated at the same level of supercooling and pressure. Under these conditions, we find that the nucleation rate for both systems is comparable. Interestingly, the nucleation pathways and resulting crystal structures are different. In the 12-6 system, nucleation and growth occur predominantly through the FCC structure. Softening the potential alters the critical nucleus composition and introduces two distinct nucleation pathways. One pathway predominantly leads to the nucleus with a body-centered cubic (BCC) structure, while the other favors the face-centered cubic (FCC) arrangement. Our study illustrates that polymorph selection can be achieved through modifications to intermolecular interactions without impacting nucleation kinetics. The results have significant implications in designing approaches for polymorph selection and modulating self-assembly mechanisms.

Title: Flat Midgap Topological Surface and Hypersurface Bands without Parameter Tuning
Authors: Keun Hyuk Ahn
Abstract: The Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model is extended to the three and higher dimensional systems. Nearly or absolutely flat midgap surface and hypersurface bands are predicted based on the topological analysis, which do not require fine tuning of parameters. By adding the on-site Coulomb interaction for the three dimensional systems, we computationally show that the large difference in the band widths between the surface and the bulk leads to the strongly correlated phenomena, specifically magnetism, confined only on the surface. Possible experimental realizations in solid state materials and metamaterials are discussed.

Title: Optimizing Time-resolved Magneto-optical Kerr Effect for High-fidelity Magnetic Characterization
Authors: Yun Kim, Dingbin Huang, Deyuan Lyu, Haoyue Sun, Jian-Ping Wang, Paul A. Crowell, Xiaojia Wang
Abstract: Spintronics has emerged as a key technology for fast and non-volatile memory with great CMOS compatibility. As the building blocks for these cutting-edge devices, magnetic materials require precise characterization of their critical properties, such as the effective anisotropy field ($H_{\rm{k,eff}}$, related to magnetic stability) and damping ($\alpha$ key factor in device energy efficiency). Accurate measurements of these properties are essential for designing and fabricating high-performance spintronic devices. Among advanced metrology techniques, Time-resolved Magneto-Optical Kerr Effect (TR-MOKE) stands out for its superb temporal and spatial resolutions, surpassing traditional methods like ferromagnetic resonance (FMR). However, the full potential of TR-MOKE has not yet been fully pledged due to the lack of systematic optimization and robust operational guidelines. In this study, we address this gap by developing experimentally validated guidelines for optimizing TR-MOKE metrology across materials with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) and in-plane magnetic anisotropy (IMA). Our work identifies the optimal ranges of the field angle to simultaneously achieve high signal amplitudes and improve measurement sensitivities to $H_{\rm{k,eff}}$ and $\alpha$. By suppressing the influence of inhomogeneities and boosting sensitivity, our work significantly enhances TR-MOKE capability to extract magnetic properties with high accuracy and reliability. This optimization framework positions TR-MOKE as an indispensable tool for advancing spintronics, paving the way for energy-efficient and high-speed devices that will redefine the landscape of modern computing and memory technologies.

Title: Magnetoelastic dynamics of the "spin Jahn-Teller" transition in CoTi$_{2}$O$_{5}$
Authors: K. Guratinder, R. D. Johnson, D. Prabhakaran, R. A. Taylor, F. Lang, S. J. Blundell, L. S. Taran, S. V. Streltsov, T. J. Williams, S. R. Giblin, T. Fennell, K. Schmalzl, C. Stock
Abstract: CoTi$_{2}$O$_{5}$ has the paradox that low temperature static magnetic order is incompatible with the crystal structure owing to a mirror plane that exactly frustrates magnetic interactions. Despite no observable structural distortion with diffraction, CoTi$_{2}$O$_{5}$ does magnetically order below $T_{\rm N}$ $\sim$ 25 K with the breaking of spin ground state degeneracy proposed to be a realization of the spin Jahn-Teller effect in analogy to the celebrated orbital Jahn-Teller transition. We apply neutron and Raman spectroscopy to study the dynamics of this transition in CoTi$_{2}$O$_{5}$. We find anomalous acoustics associated with a symmetry breaking strain that characterizes the spin Jahn-Teller transition. Crucially, the energy of this phonon coincides with the energy scale of the magnetic excitations, and has the same symmetry of an optic mode, observed with Raman spectroscopy, which atypically softens in energy with decreasing temperature. Taken together, we propose that the energetics of the spin Jahn-Teller effect in CoTi$_{2}$O$_{5}$ are related to cooperative magnetoelastic fluctuations as opposed to conventional soft critical dynamics which typically drive large measurable static displacements.

Title: Observation of a spin-textured nematic Kondo lattice

Abstract: The Kondo lattice mode, as one of the most fundamental models in condensed matter physics, has been employed to describe a wide range of quantum materials such as heavy fermions, transition metal dichalcogenides and two-dimensional Moire systems. Discovering new phases on Kondo lattice and unveiling their mechanisms are crucial to the understanding of strongly correlated systems. Here, in a layered Kondo magnet USbTe, we observe a spin-textured nematic state and visualize a heavy electronic liquid-crystal phase. Employing scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/STS), we visualize a tetragonal symmetry breaking of heavy electronic states around the Fermi level. Through systematically investigating the temperature and energy dependence of spectroscopic data, we find that the nematic state coincides with the formation of heavy quasi-particles driven by band hybridization. Remarkably, using spin polarized STM, we demonstrate that the nematic state is spin polarized, which not only suggests its intrinsically electronic nature, but also represents the unique magnetic texture of nematic heavy fermions. Our findings unveil a novel correlation-mediated order whose mechanism is inherently tied to Kondo-lattice physics. The observation of heavy nematic states enriches the phase diagram of correlated systems and provides a rare platform to explore the interplay of Kondo physics, spontaneous symmetry breaking and quantum criticality.

Title: A unifying perspective on measuring transient planar extensional viscosity from exponential shear
Authors: L.A. Kroo, R.A. Nicholson, M.W Boehm, S.K. Baier, G.H. McKinley
Abstract: Here we present an experimentally practical and robust method to compute the transient extensional viscosity from exponential shear on a wide variety of viscoelastic complex fluids. To achieve this, we derive an analytical, frame-invariant continuum solution for the exponential shear material function, valid over all Weissenberg numbers. Specifically, we amend the original framework of Doshi and Dealy proposed in 1987 to explicitly address the effect of rotation of material elements, due to the presence of vorticity. Modern strain-controlled rheometers can access a wide range of effective Hencky strain rates in exponential shear (approximately within a range of 0.01 to 7 s^-1) and up to an effective Hencky strain of approximately 6 -- sufficient range to observe finite extensibility for many polymeric fluids. We quantify the kinematic, transducer-based, and instability-related experimental limitations of the method, establishing firm windows of data validity. The new material function is tested on a number of different example fluids. We show that these exponentially increasing strain histories are capable of producing "strong flow" -- generating stress-growth dynamics consistent with coil-stretch conformational changes in polymer solutions exhibited in extensional flows (Wi > 0.5). We then demonstrate that the method can reach finite extensibility for a 0.3 % wt. PIB solution. The method is then quantitatively validated (with no fitted parameters) against a traditional extensional technique, Capillary Break-Up Extensional Rheometry (CaBER) using the same PIB solution. Questions related to generality of this approach are addressed, including discussions on multi-mode relaxation and shear thinning.

Title: XHEMTs on Ultrawide Bandgap Single-Crystal AlN Substrates
Authors: Eungkyun Kim, Yu-Hsin Chen, Naomi Pieczulewski, Jimy Encomendero, David Anthony Muller, Debdeep Jena, Huili Grace Xing
Abstract: AlN has the largest bandgap in the wurtzite III-nitride semiconductor family, making it an ideal barrier for a thin GaN channel to achieve strong carrier confinement in field-effect transistors, analogous to silicon-on-insulator technology. Unlike SiO$_2$/Si/SiO$_2$, AlN/GaN/AlN can be grown fully epitaxially, enabling high carrier mobilities suitable for high-frequency applications. However, developing these heterostructures and related devices has been hindered by challenges in strain management, polarization effects, defect control and charge trapping. Here, the AlN single-crystal high electron mobility transistor (XHEMT) is introduced, a new nitride transistor technology designed to address these issues. The XHEMT structure features a pseudomorphic GaN channel sandwiched between AlN layers, grown on single-crystal AlN substrates. First-generation XHEMTs demonstrate RF performance on par with the state-of-the-art GaN HEMTs, achieving 5.92 W/mm output power and 65% peak power-added efficiency at 10 GHz under 17 V drain bias. These devices overcome several limitations present in conventional GaN HEMTs, which are grown on lattice-mismatched foreign substrates that introduce undesirable dislocations and exacerbated thermal resistance. With the recent availability of 100-mm AlN substrates and AlN's high thermal conductivity (340 W/m$\cdot$K), XHEMTs show strong potential for next-generation RF electronics.

Title: Crystal Growth of Chalcogenides and Oxy-Chalcogenides Using Chloride Exchange Reaction
Authors: Shantanu Singh, Boyang Zhao, Christopher E. Stevens, Mythili Surendran, Tzu-Chi Huang, Bi-Hsuan Lin, Joshua R. Hendrickson, Jayakanth Ravichandran
Abstract: Chalcogenides and oxy-chalcogenides, including complex chalcogenides and transition metal dichalcogenides, are emerging semiconductors with direct or indirect band gaps within the visible spectrum. These materials are being explored for various photonic and electronic applications, such as photodetectors, photovoltaics, and phase-change electronics. Understanding the fundamental properties of these materials is crucial for optimizing their functionalities. Therefore, the availability of large, high-quality single crystals of chalcogenides and oxy-chalcogenides is essential for a better comprehension of their structure and properties. In this study, we present a novel crystal growth method that utilizes the exchange reaction between BaS and ZrCl$_4$/ HfCl$_4$. By carefully controlling the stoichiometric ratio of the binary sulfide to the chloride, we can grow single crystals of several materials, such as ZrS$_2$, HfS$_2$, BaZrS$_3$, and ZrOS. This method results in large single crystals with a short reaction time of 24 to 48 hours. High-resolution thin film diffraction and single-crystal X-ray diffraction confirm the quality of the crystals produced through this exchange reaction. We also report the optical properties of these materials investigated using photoluminescence and Raman measurements. The chloride exchange reaction method paves the way for the synthesis of single crystals of chalcogenides and oxy-chalcogenide systems with a short reaction time but with low mosaicity and can be an alternative growth technique for single crystals of materials that are difficult to synthesize using conventional growth techniques.

Title: Mean-field and Monte Carlo Analysis of Multi-Species Dynamics of agents
Authors: Eduardo Velasco Stock, Roberto da Silva, Sebastian Gonçalves
Abstract: We propose a mean-field (MF) approximation for the recurrence relation governing the dynamics of $m$ species of particles on a square lattice, and we simultaneously perform Monte Carlo (MC) simulations under identical initial conditions to emulate the intricate motion observed in environments such as subway corridors and scramble crossings in large cities. Each species moves according to transition probabilities influenced by its respective static floor field and the state of neighboring cells. To illustrate the methodology, we analyze statistical fluctuations in the spatial distribution for $m = 1$, $m = 2$, and $m = 4$ and for different regimes of average density and biased movement. A numerical comparison is conducted to determine the best agreement between the MC simulations and the MF approximation considering a renormalization exponent $\beta$ that optimizes the fit between methods. Finally, we report a phenomenon we term "Gaussian-to-Gaussian" behavior, in which an initially normal distribution of particles becomes distorted due to interactions among same and opposing species, passes through a transient regime, and eventually returns to a Gaussian-like profile in the steady state, after multiple rounds of motion under periodic boundary conditions.

Title: Rotating Quantum Droplets in Low Dimensions
Authors: Kevin Hernández, Elías Castellanos
Abstract: Quantum droplets formed by rubidium, lithium, and sodium atoms have been analyzed in this paper by using a logarithmic-type Gross-Pitaevskii equation. Variational methods and numerical techniques were employed to solve the corresponding nonlinear equations. A disk-shaped Bose-Einstein condensate was analyzed to assess its radial evolution. Additionally, free expansion under rotation of the BEC was studied. Compression and expansion around the equilibrium radius were observed in different scenarios, predicting self-confinement, which implies the formation of quantum droplets originating from a BEC state. Briefly, the physical aspects of the system and the possible formation of Bose-nova effects are discussed.

Title: Symmetry-breaking motility of an active hinge in a crowded channel
Authors: Leonardo Garibaldi Rigon, Yongjoo Baek
Abstract: A recent experiment [Son et al., Soft Matter, 2024, 20,2777-2788] showed that self-propelled particles confined within a circular boundary filled with granular medium spontaneously form a motile cluster that stays on the boundary. This cluster exhibits persistent (counter)clockwise motion driven by symmetry breaking, which arises from a positive feedback between the asymmetry of the cluster and those of the surrounding granular medium. To investigate this symmetry-breaking mechanism in broader contexts, we propose and analyze the dynamics of an active hinge moving through a crowded two-dimensional channel. Through extensive numerical simulations, we find that the lifetime of the hinge's motile state varies nonmonotonically with both the packing fraction of the granular medium and the strength of self-propulsion. Furthermore, we observe an abrupt transition in the configuration of passive particles that sustain hinge motility as the hinge's maximum angle relative to the channel wall increases. These findings point to the possibility of designing superstructures composed of passive granular media doped with a small number of active elements, whose dynamics modes can be switched by tuning the properties of their components.

Title: A Kaleidoscope of Topological Structures in Dipolar Bose-Einstein Condensates with Weyl-Like Spin-Orbit Coupling in Anharmonic Trap

Abstract: Dipole-dipole interaction (DDI) possesses characteristics different from the conventional isotropic s-wave interaction in Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs), the interplay of DDI with spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and rotation may induce novel quantum properties. We systematically analyze the effects of the DDI, Weyl-like SOC, rotation and trap anharmonicity in the ground state of two-componen BECs. The interplay of these factors leads to a kaleidoscope of quantum states of quantum defects and quantum droplets in lattice, wheel and ring forms of distributions, with transitions of topology of density and a critical behavior in varying the parameters. We also show a bunch of exotic spin topological structures, including centric vortex surrounded by layers of spin flows, compound topological structure of edge defect, and various coexistence states of skyrmions with different topological charge. In particular, we find quarter skyrmions and other possible fractional skyrmions. Rashba-type SOC and Weyl-like SOC are compared as well. Our study implies that one can manipulate both the density topology and the spin topological structure via these tunable parameters in BECs. The abundant variations of the topological structures and particularly the revealed critical behavior may provide various quantum resources for potential applications in quantum metrology.

Title: Measuring Cyclic Tensile Properties of Fluids with Composite Harmonic Exponential Waveforms (CHEW)
Authors: L.A. Kroo, R.A. Nicholson, M.W Boehm, S.K. Baier, P.A. Underhill, G.H. McKinley
Abstract: Building off recent advances on how to practically use exponential shear in a torsional rheometer to compute transient planar extensional viscosity (Kroo et al. 2025a), we extend the technique to cyclic tensile measurements in complex fluids and soft solids. An novel input strain waveform provides a unifying approach that smoothly interpolates between exponential shear (ES) and oscillatory shear (SAOS/MAOS/LAOS) as a flow type parameter is varied. Analogous to cyclic tensile fatigue tests in solids, or the process of chewing in the oral cavity, this complex strain history is used to quantify the evolution of extensional material properties at large strains over sequential cycles of stretch. In the limit of large Hencky strain rates, the waveform locally increases exponentially and generates a period of strong material stretching. This allows for the direct computation of a transient planar extensional viscosity within specific domains of the periodic function. We demonstrate this technique on a set of model fluids, and then apply it to complex multiphase materials that mutate. These latter fluids exhibit progressive evolution in their rheological properties over repeated cycles of extensional deformation. Here we focus on two examples: a delicate foodstuff material (melted provolone cheese) which systematically decreases its extensional response over successive stretching cycles, mutating at a rate that is directly dependent on the effective Hencky strain rate. We contrast this with a PVA-borax solution which exhibits precisely the opposite effect during successive stretching cycles: increasing its planar extensional response over successive cycles, as interchain associative interactions (controlled via stretching) build structure within the fluid. These results highlight a promising new approach to study bulk extensional properties during cyclical stretching of complex fluids.

Title: Giant Magneto-Optical Effects in Two-Dimensional Flat-Band Antiferromagnets
Authors: Ping Yang, Wanxiang Feng, Siyuan Liu, Shan Guan, Liwei Wen, Wei Jiang, Gui-Bin Liu, Yugui Yao
Abstract: In this work, we reveal giant magneto-optical responses in two-dimensional(2D) antiferromagnets with nearly flat electronic bands, based on first-principles calculations and group-theoretical analysis. We identify a record-large second-order magneto-optical Schafer-Hubert(SH) effect, featuring a polarization rotation angle of 28 degree, in monolayer antiferromagnetic RuOCl2, driven by flatband-enhanced interband optical transitions. Both the valence and conduction bands exhibit pronounced directional flatness, giving rise to highly anisotropic optical absorption and broadband hyperbolic frequency windows spanning the entire visible spectrum. This anisotropy leads to an exceptionally strong linear dichroism (LD) reaching 50%, far exceeding values reported in other 2D magnetic systems. Remarkably, the giant SH effect and LD appear at distinct photon energies, reflecting a momentum-direction-dependent crossover between flat and dispersive bands. Both responses are further amplified with increasing RuOCl2 film thickness. Our results establish flat-band antiferromagnets as a fertile platform for realizing giant nonlinear magneto-optical effects and open new avenues for 2D opto-spintronic device applications.

Title: Negative capacitance overcomes Schottky-gate limits in GaN high-electron-mobility transistors
Authors: Asir Intisar Khan, Jeong-Kyu Kim, Urmita Sikder, Koushik Das, Thomas Rodriguez, Rohith Soman, Srabanti Chowdhury, Sayeef Salahuddin
Abstract: For high-electron-mobility transistors based on two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) within a quantum well, such as those based on AlGaN/GaN heterostructure, a Schottky-gate is used to maximize the amount of charge that can be induced and thereby the current that can be achieved. However, the Schottky-gate also leads to very high leakage current through the gate electrode. Adding a conventional dielectric layer between the nitride layers and gate metal can reduce leakage; but this comes at the price of a reduced drain current. Here, we used a ferroic HfO2-ZrO2 bilayer as the gate dielectric and achieved a simultaneous increase in the ON current and decrease in the leakage current, a combination otherwise not attainable with conventional dielectrics. This approach surpasses the conventional limits of Schottky GaN transistors and provides a new pathway to improve performance in transistors based on 2DEG.

Title: Machine Learning Potentials for Alloys: A Detailed Workflow to Predict Phase Diagrams and Benchmark Accuracy
Authors: Siya Zhu, Doguhan Sariturk, Raymundo Arroyave
Abstract: High-entropy alloys (HEAs) have attracted increasing attention due to their unique structural and functional properties. In the study of HEAs, thermodynamic properties and phase stability play a crucial role, making phase diagram calculations significantly important. However, phase diagram calculations with conventional CALPHAD assessments based on experimental or ab-initio data can be expensive. With the emergence of machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs), we have developed a program named PhaseForge, which integrates MLIPs into the Alloy Theoretic Automated Toolkit (ATAT) framework using our MLIP calculation library, MaterialsFramework, to enable efficient exploration of alloy phase diagrams. Moreover, our workflow can also serve as a benchmarking tool for evaluating the quality of different MLIPs.

Title: Omnidirectionally manipulated skyrmions in an orientationally chiral system
Authors: Jiahao Chen, Wentao Tang, Xingzhou Tang, Yang Ding, Jie Ni, Yuxi Chen, Bingxiang Li, Rui Zhang, Juan de Pablo, Yanqing Lu
Abstract: Skyrmions, originally from condensed matter physics, have been widely explored in various physical systems, including soft matter. A crucial challenge in manipulating topological solitary waves like skyrmions is controlling their flow on demand. Here, we control the arbitrary moving direction of skyrmions in a chiral liquid crystal system by adjusting the bias of the applied alternate current electric field. Specifically, the velocity, including both moving direction and speed can be continuously changed. The motion control of skyrmions originates from the symmetry breaking of the topological structure induced by flexoelectric-polarization effect. The omnidirectional control of topological solitons opens new avenues in light-steering and racetrack memories.

Title: Non-collinear magnetism contra frustration: Magnetic order and anisotropy in hexagonal MnPtGa
Authors: Gerhard H. Fecher, Roshnee Sahoo, Claudia Felser
Abstract: MnPtGa is a hexagonal intermetallic compound with a rich variety of magnetic order. Its magnetic state is reported to range from collinear ferromagnetism, to non-collinear skyrmion type order. MnPtGa is a system with strongly localized magnetic moments at the Mn atoms as was demonstrated using calculations for disordered local moments. The magnetic moments at the Mn sites stay at about 3.9 bohr even above the calculated magnetic transition temperatures (TN = 220 K or TC = 285 K). In the present work, a special emphasis was focused on the possible non-collinear magnetic order using first principles calculations. The investigations included magnetic anisotropy, static noncollinear order in form of spin canting and dynamic non-collinearity in spin spirals. It is found that the energy differences between ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, canted, or spiral magnetic order are in the order of not more than 30 meV, which is in the order of thermal energies at ambient temperature. This hints that a particular magnetic state - including skyrmions, antiskyrmions or spin glass transitions - may be forced when an external field is applied at finite temperature.

Title: Topological characterization of magnon-polaron bands and thermal Hall conductivity in a frustrated kagome antiferromagnet
Authors: Shreya Debnath, Kuntal Bhattacharyya, Saurabh Basu
Abstract: Spin-phonon coupling and its efficacy in inducing multiple topological phase transitions in a frustrated kagome antiferromagnet have not been addressed in the literature. To this end, we study the ramifications of invoking optical phonons in a non-collinear antiferromagnet via two different kinds of coupling mechanisms, namely, a local and a non-local one, which are distinct in their macroscopic origin. In the case of a local spin-phonon coupling, a single phonon mode affects the magnetic interactions, whereas in the non-local case, two neighbouring phonon modes are involved in the energy renormalization, and it would be worthwhile to compare and contrast the two. To tackle these phonons, we propose an analytical approach through a canonical spin-Peierls transformation applied to magnons, that renders a hybridization between the magnons and the phonon modes and yields a magnon-polaron quasiparticle state. In both the coupling regimes, the robust support of the topological signatures is derived systematically from the bulk and edge spectral properties of the magnon-polaron bands that are characterized by their corresponding Chern numbers. Thereafter, we witness transitions from one topological phase to another solely via tuning the spin-phonon coupling strength. Moreover, these transitions significantly impact the behavior of the thermal Hall conductivity, which aid in discerning distinct topological phases. Additionally, the explicit dependencies on the temperature and the external magnetic field are explored in inducing topological phase transitions associated with the magnon-polaron bands. Thus, our work serves as an ideal platform to probe the interplay of frustrated magnetism and polaronic physics.

Title: Electron-phonon coupling in Kekulé-ordered graphene
Authors: Dominik Szczȩśniak
Abstract: Breaking the intrinsic chirality of quasiparticles in graphene enables the emergence of new and intriguing phases. One such paradigmatic example is the bond density wave, which leads to a Kekulé-ordered structure and underpins exotic electronic states where electron-phonon interactions can play a fundamental role. Here, it is shown that the relevant physics of these correlations can be resolved locally, according to the behavior of interatomic characteristics. For this purpose a robust distance-dependent framework for describing electronic structure of graphene with Kekulé bond order is presented. Given this insight, the strength of electron-phonon interactions is found to scale linearly with the electronic coupling, contributing to a uniform picture of this relationship in distorted graphene structures. Moreover, it is shown that the introduced distortion yields a strongly non-uniform spatial distribution of the pairing strength that eventually leads to the induction of periodically distributed domains of enhanced electron-phonon coupling. These findings help elucidate certain peculiar aspects of phonon-mediated phenomena in graphene, particularly the associated superconducting phase, and offer potential pathways for their further engineering.

Title: Effective Field Theory of a Noncollinear Altermagnet
Authors: Seungho Lee, Se Kwon Kim
Abstract: We derive an effective field theory for a noncollinear altermagnet and magnons on top of the noncollinear ground state from an altermagnetic Heisenberg model. We obtain the ground-state phase diagram, revealing a noncollinear phase and four distinct collinear phases. The ground state of the noncollinear phase fully breaks the spin rotational symmetry, while the ground state of the collinear phases possesses unbroken $\mathrm{SO}(2)$ symmetry. The resulting effective field theory for the noncollinear phase is an $\mathrm{SO}(3)$ sigma model in which the magnonic excitation has three independent degrees of freedom and exhibits the $d$-wave-like anisotropic linear dispersion. We also discuss possible topological solitons, including $\mathbb{Z}_2$ vortices.

Title: Double Supersolid Phase in a Bosonic t-J-V Model with Rydberg Atoms
Authors: Kuangjie Chen, Yang Qi, Zheng Yan, Xiaopeng Li
Abstract: Recent advances in Rydberg tweezer arrays bring novel opportunities for programmable quantum simulations beyond previous capabilities. In this work, we investigate a bosonic t-J-V model currently realized with Rydberg atoms. Through large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we uncover an emergent double supersolid (DSS) phase with the coexistence of two superfluids and crystalline order. Tunable long-range tunneling and repulsive hole-hole interactions enable a rich phase diagram featuring a double superfluid phase, a DSS phase, and an antiferromagnetic insulator. Intriguingly, within the DSS regime we observe an unconventional thermal enhancement of crystalline order. Our results establish the bosonic t-J-V model as a promising and experimentally accessible platform for exploring exotic quantum phases in Rydberg atom arrays.

Title: Hop-Decorate: An Automated Atomistic Workflow for Generating Defect Transport Data in Chemically Complex Materials
Authors: Peter Hatton, Blas Pedro Uberuaga, Danny Perez
Abstract: Chemically complex materials (CCMs) exhibit extraordinary functional properties but pose significant challenges for atomistic modeling due to their vast configurational heterogeneity. We introduce Hop-Decorate (HopDec), a high-throughput, Python-based atomistic workflow that automates the generation of defect transport data in CCMs. HopDec integrates accelerated molecular dynamics with a novel redecoration algorithm to efficiently sample migration pathways across chemically diverse local environments. The method constructs a defect-state graph in which transitions are associated with distributions of kinetic and thermodynamic parameters, enabling direct input into kinetic Monte Carlo and other mesoscale models. We demonstrate HopDec's capabilities through applications to a Cu-Ni alloy and the spinel oxide (Fe,Ni)Cr2O4, revealing simple predictive relationships in the former and complex migration behaviors driven by cation disorder in the latter. These results highlight HopDec's ability to extract physically meaningful trends and support reduced-order or machine-learned models of defect kinetics, bridging atomic-scale simulations and mesoscale predictions in complex material systems.

Title: Local symmetry breaking and orbital glass behaviour in CoFe2O4
Authors: Soumya Shephalika Behera, Isha, Arvind Kumar Yogi, V R Rao Medicherla, Parasmani Rajput, Archana Sagdeo, Jaspreet Singh, Vasant Sathe, R J Choudhary
Abstract: The structural distortions, orbital correlations, and electronic states in cobalt ferrite (CoFe2O4) were investigated using complementary characterisation techniques, including SR-XRD, HAXPES, XANES, EXAFS, and Raman spectroscopy. SR-XRD confirms phase purity and reveals a temperature-dependent superlattice reflection between 200 K and 100 K, consistent with the emergence of short-range orbital ordering driven by cooperative Jahn-Teller distortion (JTD). The disappearance of this feature below 100 K signals orbital freezing and the onset of a glass-like orbital state. HAXPES measurements show multiplet splitting and charge-transfer satellite features in the Co and Fe 2p core levels, indicating mixed valence states and strong electron correlations. XANES analysis reveals hybridized p-d states and local coordination distortions. Temperature-dependent EXAFS measurements indicate increasing local disorder-particularly in Fe-O and Fe-Fe octahedral bonds as evidenced by enhanced Debye-Waller factors. These distortions, attributed to cation redistribution and oxygen vacancies, are static and asymmetric, primarily affecting the octahedral sublattice. Notably, signatures of cooperative Jahn-Teller distortions emerge in the intermediate temperature range (200-100 K) and disappear upon further cooling. Raman spectroscopy further supports these findings, revealing phonon anomalies and enhanced spin-phonon coupling in the same temperature range. Magnetic measurements indicate spin reorientation and exchange interaction anomalies that align with the orbital behaviour. Together, these results hint at a frustrated orbital state in CoFe2O4 possibly involving cooperative Jahn-Teller distortions, disrupted long-range coherence, and orbital glass behaviour offering new insights into the coupling of orbital, spin, and lattice degrees of freedom in spinel systems.

Title: An investigation of the two-dimensional non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Model
Authors: Udai Prakash Tyagi, Partha Goswami
Abstract: This communication presents an examination of a two-dimensional, non-Hermitian Su -Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, which is differentiated from its conventional Hermitian counterpart by incorporating gain and/or loss terms, mathematically represented by imaginary on-site potentials. The time-reversal symmetry is disrupted due to these on-site potentials. Exceptional points in a non-Hermitian system feature eigenvalue coalescence and non-trivial eigenvector degeneracies. Utilization of the rank-nullity theorem and graphical analysis of the phase rigidity factor enable identification of true exceptional points. Furthermore, this investigation achieves vectorized Zak phase quantization and examines a topolectric RLC circuit to derive the corresponding topological boundary resonance condition and the quantum Hall susceptance. Although Chern number quantization is not feasible, staggered hopping amplitudes corresponding to unit-cell lattice sites lead to broken inversion symmetry with non-zero Berry curvature, resulting in finite anomalous Nernst conductivity.

Title: Spin-polarized edge modes between different magnet-superconductor-hybrids
Authors: Felix Zahner, Felix Nickel, Roberto Lo Conte, Tim Drevelow, Roland Wiesendanger, Stefan Heinze, Kirsten von Bergmann
Abstract: The interplay of magnetism and superconductivity can lead to intriguing emergent phenomena. Here we combine two different two-dimensional antiferromagnetic magnet-superconductor hybrids (MSH) and study their properties using spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy. Both MSHs show the characteristics of a topological nodal point superconducting phase with edge modes to the trivial substrate superconductor. At the boundary between the two MSHs we find low-energy modes which are spin-polarized. Based on a tight-binding model we can explain the experimental observations by considering two different topological nodal point superconductors. This gives rise to spin-polarized chiral edge modes that connect topological nodal points of the two different MSH. We demonstrate via the complex band structure that due to an asymmetric lateral decay these edge modes are spin-polarized, regardless of the details of the spin structure at the boundary. The presence of spin-polarized edge states between different topological superconductors enables advanced functional design for the exploitation of MSHs as a platform for topology-based applications.

Title: Optical signatures of quantum skyrmions
Authors: Sanchar Sharma, Christina Psaroudaki
Abstract: Magnets have recently emerged as promising candidates for quantum computing, particularly using topologically-protected nanoscale spin textures. While the quantum dynamics of such spin textures has been theoretically studied, direct experimental evidence of their non-classical behavior remains an open challenge. To address this, we propose to employ Brillouin light scattering (BLS) as a method to probe the quantum nature of skyrmions in frustrated magnets. We show that, for a specific geometry, classical skyrmions produce symmetric sidebands in the BLS spectrum, whereas quantum skyrmions exhibit a distinct asymmetry arising from vacuum fluctuations of their rotation. By studying the photon-skyrmion interaction, we calculate the BLS spectrum using a quantum master equation and show that sideband asymmetry serves as a robust witness of energy level quantization. We find that this asymmetry is pronounced at low temperatures, and can be controlled by input laser power. These findings establish a concrete protocol for the optical detection of non-classical features in spin textures, paving the way for exploring their role in quantum applications.

Title: Winding-Control Mechanism of Non-Hermitian Systems
Authors: Yongxu Fu, Yi Zhang
Abstract: Non-Hermitian quantum systems exhibit various interesting and inter-connected spectral, topological, and boundary-sensitive features. By introducing conditional boundary conditions (CBCs) for non-Hermitian quantum systems, we explore a winding-control mechanism that selectively collapses specific periodic boundary condition (PBC) spectra onto their open boundary condition (OBC) counterparts, guided by their specific winding numbers, together with a composite reconstruction of the Brillouin zone (BZ) and generalized Brillouin zone (GBZ). The corresponding eigenstates also manifest nontrivial skin effects or extended behaviors arising from the interplay between BZ and GBZ structures. Furthermore, we can generalize our control by incorporating similarity transformations and holomorphic mappings with the boundary controls. We demonstrate the winding control numerically within various models, which enriches our knowledge of non-Hermitian physics across the spectrum, topology, and bulk-boundary correspondence.

Title: A Josephson wormhole in coupled superconducting Yukawa-SYK metals
Authors: Aravindh S. Shankar, Jasper Steenbergen, Stephan Plugge, Koenraad Schalm
Abstract: We show that two Yukawa-SYK models with a weak tunneling contact can have an exotic hybrid superconducting thermofield-double-like state that is holographically dual to a traversable wormhole connecting two black holes with charged scalar hair. The hybrid superconducting thermo-field-double/wormhole state is distinguishable by anomalous scaling of revival oscillations in the fermionic Green's function, but also in a unique Andreev-revival in the anomalous Green's function. The existence of this TFD/wormhole state surprisingly shows that the some quantum critical effects can survive the phase transition to superconductivity. This Andreev-revival is in principle an accessible signature of the transition to the TFD/wormhole phase detectable in the ac-Josephson current.

Title: Single-shot thermometry of simulated Bose--Einstein condensates using artificial intelligence
Authors: Jack Griffiths, Steven A. Wrathmall, Simon A. Gardiner
Abstract: Precise determination of thermodynamic parameters in ultracold Bose gases remains challenging due to the destructive nature of conventional measurement techniques and inherent experimental uncertainties. We demonstrate an artificial intelligence approach for rapid, non-destructive estimation of the chemical potential and temperature from single-shot, in situ imaged density profiles of finite-temperature Bose gases. Our convolutional neural network is trained exclusively on quasi-2D `pancake' condensates in harmonic trap configurations. It achieves parameter extraction within fractions of a second. The model also demonstrates zero-shot generalisation across both trap geometry and thermalisation dynamics, successfully estimating thermodynamic parameters for toroidally trapped condensates with errors of only a few nanokelvin despite no prior exposure to such geometries during training, and maintaining predictive accuracy during dynamic thermalisation processes after a relatively brief evolution without explicit training on non-equilibrium states. These results suggest that supervised learning can overcome traditional limitations in ultracold atom thermometry, with extension to broader geometric configurations, temperature ranges, and additional parameters potentially enabling comprehensive real-time analysis of quantum gas experiments. Such capabilities could significantly streamline experimental workflows whilst improving measurement precision across a range of quantum fluid systems.

Abstract: Crystal structure symmetry of Fe-deficient $\text{Fe}_{\text{2.9}}\text{GeTe}_{\text{2}}$ at room temperature has been investigated by a combination of selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) and convergent-beam electron diffraction (CBED). By symmetry analysis of CBED patterns along different zone axis, the space group of $\text{Fe}_{\text{2.9}}\text{GeTe}_{\text{2}}$ at room-temperature has been identified as $P6_3mc$ (No.186), which derives from the high-symmetry parent system $\text{Fe}_{\text{3}}\text{GeTe}_{\text{2}}$ ($P6_3/mmc$) by breaking the mirror symmetry along the six-fold rotation axis. The $P3m1$ (No.156) space group previously reported for $\text{Fe}_{\text{2.9}}\text{GeTe}_{\text{2}}$ is a subgroup of $P6_3mc$ suggesting further possible symmetry breaks in this non-stochiometric system.

Title: Role of hydrogen dynamics and deposition conditions in photochromic YHO/MoO$_3$ bilayer films
Authors: Edvards Strods, Martins Zubkins, Viktors Vibornijs, Dmitrii Moldarev, Anatolijs Sarakovskis, Karlis Kundzins, Emija Letko, Daniel Primetzhofer, Juris Purans
Abstract: Oxygen-containing yttrium hydride (YHO) and molybdenum trioxide (MoO$_3$) bilayer films (YHO/MoO$_3$) are produced using reactive magnetron sputtering, and their photochromic properties are investigated in relation to the thickness and density of the MoO$_3$ layer. Compared to single YHO films, the YHO/MoO$_3$ films exhibit faster coloration and larger contrast, with both parameters adjustable by varying the thickness or deposition pressure of the MoO$_3$ layer. Transparent YHO/MoO$_3$ films (~75% at 550 nm) demonstrate a photochromic contrast of up to 60%, significantly higher than the 25-30% contrast observed for single YHO films after 20 hours of UVA-violet light exposure. This enhancement arises from hydrogen intercalation from the (200)-textured polycrystalline YHO film into the X-ray amorphous MoO$_3$, leading to the formation of molybdenum bronze (HxMoO$_3$), as confirmed by X-ray photoelectron and optical spectroscopies. However, the darkened YHO/MoO$_3$ films do not fully recover to their initial transparency after illumination due to the irreversible nature of the coloured MoO$_3$ layer. Most of the hydrogen intercalated into MoO$_3$ originates from the YHO layer during the initial darkening process. Furthermore, the bilayer films are chemically unstable, exhibiting gradual darkening over time even without intentional UV illumination, as confirmed by nuclear reaction analysis.

Title: Band-like Exact Zero-energy Andreev Bound States and Superconducting Diode Effect in Mixed ${s+p}$-wave Josephson Junctions
Authors: Shu-Tong Guan, Jin An
Abstract: Topological Josephson junctions enable nonreciprocal transport involving Majorana fermions (MFs). Here we examine a topological Josephson junction with mixed $s$+$p$-wave pairing, where topological phase transition can be driven by adjusting the ratio between the pairing components. There exist two exact symmetrically positioned zero-energy level crossings for the Andreev-bound states, which can be shifted by external fields, and can be destroyed or recreated in pairs by a time-reversal breaking Zeeman field or inhomogeneities, exhibiting band-like structure. The dependence of the shift on the Zeeman field is linear when the two $p$-wave $\boldsymbol{d}$-vectors on both sides are identical while quadratic when they are distinct. Near the topological phase transition, the topological $p$-wave dominant junctions host MF-induced pronounced superconducting diode effect with high efficiency factor $Q$ up to 30 %, in contrast to the trivial $s$-wave dominant junctions possessing relatively small $Q$.

Title: Influence of the Effective Mass on ab initio Phonon-limited Electron Mobility of GaAs
Authors: Mohammad Dehghani, Dominic Waldhoer, Angus Gentles, Pedram Khakbaz, Rainer Minixhofer, Michael Waltl
Abstract: We present a comprehensive ab initio study of the influence of band structure corrections, particularly the electron effective mass, on the phonon-limited electron drift and Hall mobilities of GaAs. Our approach is based on the DFT+$U$ method, combined with an iterative solution of the linearized Boltzmann transport equation using the Wannier interpolation technique. We show how this framework allows for accurate refinements of the electronic band structure and phonon dispersion, leading to improved predictions for transport properties. In particular, by varying the Hubbard parameters to purposefully tune the conduction band features, allowing us to reproduce bands with different electron effective mass, we systematically investigate the relationship between mobility and effective mass. In this context, our results show close agreement with semi-empirical relations that follow a power-law dependence. Moreover, this approach can be used to indirectly incorporate temperature effects into the band structure, enabling efficient evaluation of temperature-dependent electron mobilities. Our mobility results exhibit good agreement with experimental data and are comparable to previously reported values obtained using the computationally expensive GW method.

Title: Line Tension Reshapes Nucleation at Surface Edges: A Generalized Theory for Nanopore Activation
Authors: Yanchen Wu, Martin Z. Bazant, Allan S. Myerson, Richard D. Braatz
Abstract: Heterogeneous nucleation at surface edges is pervasive across nature and industry, yet the role of line tension, arising from asymmetric capillary interactions at geometric singularities, remains poorly understood. Herein we develop a generalized nucleation theory that explicitly incorporates line tension induced by edge pinning, thereby extending classical frameworks to account for nanoscale confinement and interfacial asymmetry. Through analytical treatment of droplet formation within geometrically defined nanopores, we derive a closed-form expression for the edge-pinned line tension as a function of Laplace pressure, pore geometry, and wettability. This formulation reveals that line tension can significantly reshape the nucleation energy landscape, introducing nontrivial dependencies on contact angle and pore morphology. Our results uncover a tunable, geometry-mediated mechanism for controlling nucleation barriers, offering predictive insight into phase transitions in confined environments and suggesting new strategies for design in applications ranging from nanofluidics to crystallization control.

Title: Probing dynamical axion quasiparticles with two-photon correlations
Authors: Daniel Boyanovsky
Abstract: Dynamical axion (quasi) particles are emergent collective excitations in topological magnetic insulators that break parity and time reversal invariance or in Weyl semimetals. They couple to electromagnetism via a topological Chern-Simons term, leading to their decay into two photons. We extend the Weisskopf-Wigner formulation of atomic spontaneous emission to the quantum field theory of dynamical axion quasiparticles, allowing us to obtain the quantum two-photon state emerging from axion decay in real time. This state features \emph{hyperentanglement} in momentum and polarization with a distinct polarization pattern, a consequence of the parity and time reversal breaking of the axion-photon interaction. Polarization aspects of this two-photon state are studied by introducing quantum Stokes operators. Whereas the two-photon quantum state features vanishing \emph{averages} of the degree of polarization and polarization asymmetry, there are non-trivial momentum correlations of the Stokes operators. In particular momentum correlations of the \emph{polarization asymmetry} can be obtained directly from coincident momentum and polarization resolved two photon detection. Correlations of Stokes operators are directly related to momentum and polarization resolved Hanbury-Brown Twiss second order coherences. This relationship suggests two-photon correlations as a direct probe of dynamical axion quasiparticles. Similarities and differences with parametrically down converted photons and other systems where spontaneous emission yield hyperentangled two photon states are recognized, suggesting experimental avenues similar to tests of Bell inequalities to probe dynamical axion quasiparticles with coincident two photon detection.

Title: Simulating Correlated Electrons with Symmetry-Enforced Normalizing Flows
Authors: Dominic Schuh, Janik Kreit, Evan Berkowitz, Lena Funcke, Thomas Luu, Kim A. Nicoli, Marcel Rodekamp
Abstract: We present the first proof of principle that normalizing flows can accurately learn the Boltzmann distribution of the fermionic Hubbard model - a key framework for describing the electronic structure of graphene and related materials. State-of-the-art methods like Hybrid Monte Carlo often suffer from ergodicity issues near the time-continuum limit, leading to biased estimates. Leveraging symmetry-aware architectures as well as independent and identically distributed sampling, our approach resolves these issues and achieves significant speed-ups over traditional methods.

Title: Nanosculpted 3D helices of a magnetic Weyl semimetal with switchable nonreciprocity
Authors: Max T. Birch, Yukako Fujishiro, Ilya Belopolski, Masataka Mogi, Yi-Ling Chiew, Xiuzhen Yu, Naoto Nagaosa, Minoru Kawamura, Yoshinori Tokura
Abstract: The emergent properties of materials are defined by the symmetries of their underlying atomic, spin and charge order. The explorations of symmetry breaking effects are therefore usually limited by the intrinsic properties of known, stable materials. In recent years, advances in focused ion beam (FIB) fabrication have enabled the nanostructuring of bulk crystals into ultraprecise transport devices [1-4], facilitating the investigation of geometrical effects on mesoscopic length scales. In this work, we expand such explorations into three-dimensional (3D), curvilinear shapes, by sculpting helical nanostructure devices from single crystals of the high-mobility, centrosymmetric magnetic Weyl semimetal Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ [5,6]. The combination of the imposed chiral geometry and intrinsic ferromagnetism yields nonreciprocal electron transport [7-9]. The high coercivity results in an anomalous, reversable diode effect remnant under zero applied magnetic field, which is orders of magnitude larger than can be explained by a classical self-field mechanism. We argue the enhancement originates from the high carrier mobility and the resulting quasi-ballistic transport: the conduction electron mean free path approaches the length scale of the curvature, resulting in increased asymmetrical scattering at the boundaries. We further demonstrate the inverse effect of the nonreciprocal transport: the field-free, current-induced switching of the magnetisation. The results establish the vast potential of 3D nanosculpting to explore and enrich the functionality of quantum materials.

Title: Multistability and Noise-Induced Transitions in Dispersively-Coupled Nonlinear Nanomechanical Modes
Authors: David Allemeier, İsmet İnönü Kaya, M. Selim Hanay, Kamil L. Ekinci
Abstract: We study the noisy dynamics of two coupled bistable modes of a nanomechanical beam. When de-coupled, each driven mode obeys the Duffing equation of motion, with a well-defined bistable region in the frequency domain. When both modes are driven, intermodal dispersive coupling emerges due to the amplitude dependence of the modal frequencies and leads to coupled states of the two modes. We map out the dynamics of the system by sweeping the drive frequencies of both modes in the presence of added noise. The system then samples all accessible states at each combination of frequencies, with the probability of each stable state being proportional to its occupancy time at steady state. In the frequency domain, the system exhibits four stable regions -- one for each coupled state -- which are separated by five curves. These curves are reminiscent of coexistence curves in an equilibrium phase diagram: each curve is defined by robust inter-state transitions, with equal probabilities of finding the system in the two contiguous states. Remarkably, the curves intersect in two triple points, where the system now transitions between three distinct contiguous states. A physical analogy can be made between this nonequilibrium system and a multi-phase thermodynamic system, with possible applications in computing, precision sensing, and signal processing.

Title: A many-body characterization of the fundamental gap in monolayer CrI$_3$
Authors: Daniel Staros, Abdulgani Annaberdiyev, Kevin Gasperich, Anouar Benali, Panchapakesan Ganesh, Brenda Rubenstein
Abstract: The many-body fixed-node and fixed-phase spin-orbit Diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) methods are applied to accurately predict the fundamental gap of monolayer CrI$_3$ - the first experimentally-realized 2D material with intrinsic magnetism. The fundamental gap obtained, 2.9(1)~eV, agrees well with the highest peak in optical spectroscopy measurements and a previous $GW$ result. We numerically show that as expected in DMC the same value of the fundamental gap is obtained in the thermodynamic limit using both neutral promotions and the standard quasiparticle definition of the gap based on the ionization potential and electron affinity. Additional analysis of the differences between density matrices formed in different bases using configuration interaction calculations explains why a single-reference trial wave function can produce an accurate excitation. We find that accounting for electron correlation is more crucial than accounting for spin-orbit effects in determining the fundamental gap. These results highlight how DMC can be used to benchmark 2D material physics and emphasize the importance of using beyond-DFT methods for studying 2D materials.

Title: Phase Transition of the Ising Model on a 3-Dimensional Fractal Lattice
Authors: Jozef Genzor, Roman Krčmár, Hiroshi Ueda, Denis Kochan, Andrej Gendiar, Tomotoshi Nishino
Abstract: The critical behavior of the classical Ising model on a three-dimensional fractal lattice with Hausdorff dimension $d_H = \ln32 / \ln4 = 2.5$ is investigated using the higher-order tensor renormalization group (HOTRG) method. We determine the critical temperature $T_c \approx 2.65231$ and the critical exponents for magnetization $\beta \approx 0.059$ and field response $\delta \approx 35$. Unlike a previously studied 2D fractal with $d_H \approx 1.792$, the specific heat for this 3D fractal exhibits a divergent singularity at $T_c$. The results are compared with those for regular lattices and other fractal structures to elucidate the role of dimensionality in critical phenomena.

Abstract: We investigate tunable superconducting transitions in (111)$\mathrm{LaAlO}_3/\mathrm{KTaO}_3$ field-effect devices. Large increases in conductivity, associated with superconducting fluctuations, are observed far above the transition temperature. However, the standard Aslamazov-Larkin paraconductivity model significantly underestimates the effect observed here. We use a model that includes conductivity corrections from normal state quasiparticle interference together with all contributions from superconducting fluctuations evaluated at arbitrary temperatures and in the short-wavelength limit. Through analysis of the magnetoconductance and resistive transitions, we find that the large conductivity increase can be explained by a combination of weak anti-localization and Maki-Thompson superconducting fluctuations. Both contributions are enabled by a strong temperature dependence of the electron's decoherence time compatible with an electron-phonon scattering scenario. We find that conductivity corrections are modulated by the electrostatic field effect, that governs a competition between normal-state quasiparticle interference and superconducting fluctuations.

Title: Quantum droplets in rapidly rotating two-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensates
Authors: Zhen Cao, Siying Li, Zhendong Li, Xinyi Liu, Zhigang Wu, Mingyuan Sun
Abstract: Recent experiments demonstrate that rapidly rotating Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) near the lowest Landau level can self-organize into interaction-driven persistent droplet arrays. Inspired by this discovery, we investigate the formation and dynamics of single droplet and droplet arrays in rapidly rotating BECs. Guided by a rigorous theorem on localized many-body states for 2D interacting systems in a magnetic field, we construct single droplet and droplet arrays states which are shown to be stationary solutions to the Gross-Pitaevskii equation in the rotating frame. The single droplet is shown to be dynamically stable, which underpins its role as the basic unit in a droplet array. The stability of the droplet arrays is demonstrated by their dynamic formation from a phase engineered initial condensate. Our study sheds light onto the nature of the droplet state in a rapidly rotating BEC and offers a new approach for generating and manipulating quantum droplet arrays through designing the initial condensate phase.

Title: Two dimensional sub-wavelength topological dark state lattices
Authors: Domantas Burba, Gediminas Juzeliūnas
Abstract: We present a general framework for engineering two-dimensional (2D) sub-wavelength topological optical lattices using spatially dependent atomic dark states in a $\Lambda$-type configuration of the atom-light coupling. By properly designing the spatial profiles of the laser fields inducing coupling between the atomic internal states, we show how to generate sub-wavelength Kronig-Penney-like geometric scalar potential accompanied by narrow and strong patches of the synthetic magnetic field localized in the same areas as the scalar potential. These sharply peaked magnetic fluxes are compensated by a smooth background magnetic field of opposite sign, resulting in zero net flux per unit cell while still enabling topologically nontrivial band structures. Specifically, for sufficiently narrow peaks, their influence is minimum, and the behavior of the system in a remaining smooth background magnetic field resembles the Landau problem, allowing for the formation of nearly flat energy bands with unit Chern numbers. Numerical analysis confirms the existence of ideal Chern bands and the robustness of the topological phases against non-adiabatic effects and losses. This makes the scheme well-suited for simulating quantum Hall systems and fractional Chern insulators in ultracold atomic gases, offering a new platform for exploring strongly correlated topological phases with high tunability.

Title: Instabilities in Colloidal Crystals on Fluid Membranes
Authors: Sanjay Dharmavaram, Basant Lal Sharma
Abstract: The complex physics of self-assembly in colloidal crystals on deformable interfaces and surfaces poses interesting possibilities for the designability and synthesis of next-generation metamaterials. The goal of this article is to characterize instabilities arising in colloidal crystals assembled on fluid membranes. The colloidal particles are modeled as pair-wise interacting point particles, constrained to lie on a fluid membrane and yet free to reorganize, and the membrane's elastic energy is modeled via the Helfrich energy. We find that when a collection of particles is arranged on a planar membrane in some regular fashion -- such as periodic lattice -- then the regular configuration admits bifurcations to non-planar configurations. Using the Bloch-wave anstaz for the mode of instabilities, we present a parameteric analysis of the boundary between the stable and unstable regimes. We find that instabilities can occur through two distinct kinds of modes, when the parameters belong in certain physically interesting regimes, referred to as long-wavenumber modes ($L$ modes) and short-wavenumber modes ($S$ modes) in the article. We discuss some connections between these results and recent experiments, as well as the open problem of budding in biomembranes.

Title: Axion electrodynamics of Weyl superconductors with broken time-reversal symmetry
Authors: Vira Shyta, Jeroen van den Brink, Flavio S. Nogueira
Abstract: The low-energy effective description of Weyl semimetals is defined by the axion electrodynamics, which captures the effects arising due to the presence of nodes of opposite chirality in the electronic structure. Here we explore the magnetoelectric response of time-reversal breaking (TRB) Weyl superconductors in the London regime. The influence of the axion contribution leads to an increase in the London penetration depth$-$a behavior that can be anticipated by first considering the photon spectrum of a TRB Weyl semimetal. Moreover, we find that both the Meissner state and the vortex phase feature an interplay between the electric and magnetic fields. This leads to a nonvanishing electromagnetic angular momentum, which we calculate for a number of geometrical configurations.

Title: Quantitative correlation between structural (dis-)order and diffuseness of phase transition in lead scandium tantalate
Authors: T. Granzow, A. Aravindhan, Y. Nouchokgwe, V. Kovacova, S. Glinsek, S. Hirose, T. Usui, H. Uršič, I. Goričan, W. Jo, C.-H. Hong, E. Defay
Abstract: Ferroelectrics show a phase transition to a paraelectric phase at a well-defined transition temperature. Introducing disorder makes this transition diffuse, and the system becomes a relaxor. Since the degree of (dis-)order is usually manipulated by varying the chemical composition, it is difficult to establish a direct relationship between disorder and the degree of diffuseness. Perovskite structured lead scandium tantalate (Pb[Sc$_{1/2}$Ta$_{1/2}$]O$_3$, PST) offers the opportunity to tune the character of the transition by thermal annealing without changing the stoichiometry. Here it is demonstrated that there is a linear correlation between the structural ordering, quantified by the intensity ratio $S$ of the pseudocubic (111)/(200) x-ray diffraction peaks, and the diffuseness parameter $\gamma$ deduced from temperature-dependent dielectric spectroscopy. The relation is universal, independent of whether the sample is a thin film, multilayer capacitor or bulk ceramic, and also independent of the absolute value of the dielectric permittivity.

Title: Cascade at local yield strain for silica and metallic glass
Authors: Nandlal Pingua, Himani Rautela, Roni Chatterjee, Smarajit Karmakar, Pinaki Chaudhuri, Shiladitya Sengupta
Abstract: We report observations of unusal \emph{first} plastic events in silica and metallic glasses in the shear startup regime at applied strain two orders of magnitude smaller than yield strain. The (non-Affine) particle displacement field during these events have complex real space structure with multiple disconnected cores of high displacement appearing at the \emph{same} applied strain under athermal quasistatic simple shear deformation, and identified by a ``cell based cluster analysis'' method. By monitoring the stress relaxation during the first plastic event by Langevin dynamics simulation, we directly show the cascade nature of these events. Thus these first plastic events are reminiscent of avalanches in the post-yielding steady state, but unlike the steady state avalanches, we show that these events are not system spanning. To understand the nature of these events, we tune three factors that are known to affect brittleness of a glass. These are (i) sample preparation history, (ii) inter-particle interactions and (iii) rigidity of the background matrix applying a ``soft matrix'' probe recently developed by some of us. In each case we show that such first plastic events are more probable in more ductile glasses. Our observations are consistent with the picture that more ductile materials are softer, implying that understanding the role of softness may be a promising route to develop microscopic quantifiers of brittleness and thus clarifying the physical origin of brittle-to-ductile transition.

Title: Unraveling the Robust Superconductivity Phenomenon of High-Entropy Alloy
Authors: Adam D. Smith, Wenjun Ding, Yogesh K. Vohra, Cheng-Chien Chen
Abstract: Recent experiments demonstrate a "robust superconductivity phenomenon" in niobium-based alloys, where the superconducting state remains intact and the critical temperature ($T_c$) is largely unaffected by external pressure well above tens of gigapascal (GPa) into the megabar regime ($\ge 100 GPa$). Motivated by these observations, we perform first-principles electron-phonon calculations for body-centered cubic Nb and NbTi crystals, as well as for special quasi-random structures of Nb$_{0.5}$Ti$_{0.5}$ and (NbTa)$_{0.7}$(HfZrTi)$_{0.3}$ high-entropy alloy (HEA). The calculations unravel the underlying mechanism of robust superconductivity, stemming from a compensation effect between varying electronic and phonon properties under pressure. The results also reveal how structural and chemical disorders modify the superconducting state. The first-principles $T_c$ values agree quantitatively with the experiments throughout the entire pressure range under study. Our work thereby paves the way for exploring superconducting HEAs under pressure via advanced first-principles simulations.

Title: Partition function for several Ising model interface structures
Authors: Alessio Squarcini, Piotr Nowakowski, Douglas B. Abraham, Anna Maciołek
Abstract: We employ a procedure that enables us to calculate the excess free energies for a finite Ising cylinder with domain walls analytically. This procedure transparently covers all possible configurations of the domain walls under given boundary conditions and allows for a physical interpretation in terms of coarse-grained quantities such as surface and point tensions. The resulting integrals contain all the information about finite-size effects; we extract them by careful asymptotic analysis using the steepest descent method. To this end, we exactly determine the steepest descent path and analyse its features. For the general class of integrals, which are usually found in the study of systems with inclined domain walls, knowledge of the steepest descent path is necessary to detect possible intersections with poles of the integrand in the complex plane.

Title: How universal is the mean-field universality class for percolation in complex networks?
Authors: Lorenzo Cirigliano
Abstract: Clustering and degree correlations are ubiquitous in real-world complex networks. Yet, understanding their role in critical phenomena remains a challenge for theoretical studies. Here, we provide the exact solution of site percolation in a model for strongly clustered random graphs, with many overlapping loops and heterogeneous degree distribution. We systematically compare the exact solution with mean-field predictions obtained from a treelike random rewiring of the network, which preserves only the degree sequence. Our results demonstrate a nontrivial interplay between degree heterogeneity, correlations and network topology, which can significantly alter both the percolation threshold and the critical exponents predicted by the mean-field. These findings highlight the need for new approaches, beyond the heterogeneous mean-field theory, to accurately describe phase transitions in complex networks with realistic topological features.

Using automatic differentiation, we calculate the magnetization's first derivative, allowing us to determine the boundary critical exponent $\beta$ accurately.

Title: Observation of Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universal scaling in two dimensions
Authors: Simon Widmann, Siddhartha Dam, Johannes Düreth, Christian G. Mayer, Romain Daviet, Carl Philipp Zelle, David Laibacher, Monika Emmerling, Martin Kamp, Sebastian Diehl, Simon Betzold, Sebastian Klembt, Sven Höfling
Abstract: Equilibrium and nonequilibrium states of matter can exhibit fundamentally different behavior. A key example is the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class in two spatial dimensions (2D KPZ), where microscopic deviations from equilibrium give rise to macroscopic scaling laws without equilibrium counterparts. While extensively studied theoretically, direct experimental evidence of 2D KPZ scaling has remained limited to interface growth so far. Here, we report the observation of universal scaling consistent with the KPZ universality class in 2D exciton-polariton condensates -- quantum fluids of light that are inherently driven and dissipative, thus breaking equilibrium conditions. Using momentum-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy as well as space- and time-resolved interferometry, we probe the phase correlations across microscopically different systems, varying drive conditions in two distinct lattice geometries. Our analysis reveals correlation dynamics and scaling exponents in excellent agreement with 2D KPZ predictions. These results establish exciton-polariton condensates as a robust experimental platform for exploring 2D nonequilibrium universality quantitatively, and open new avenues for investigating the emergence of coherence in interacting quantum systems far from equilibrium.

Title: Advancing Stochastic 3-SAT Solvers by Dissipating Oversatisfied Constraints
Authors: J. Schwardt, J. C. Budich
Abstract: We introduce and benchmark a stochastic local search heuristic for the NP-complete satisfiability problem 3-SAT that drastically outperforms existing solvers in the notoriously difficult realm of critically hard instances. Our construction is based on the crucial observation that well established previous approaches such as WalkSAT are prone to get stuck in local minima that are distinguished from true solutions by a larger number of oversatisfied combinatorial constraints. To address this issue, the proposed algorithm, coined DOCSAT, dissipates oversatisfied constraints (DOC), i.e. reduces their unfavorable abundance so as to render them critical. We analyze and benchmark our algorithm on a randomly generated sample of hard but satisfiable 3-SAT instances with varying problem sizes up to N=15000. Quite remarkably, we find that DOCSAT outperforms both WalkSAT and other well known algorithms including the complete solver Kissat, even when comparing its ability to solve the hardest quintile of the sample to the average performance of its competitors. The essence of DOCSAT may be seen as a way of harnessing statistical structure beyond the primary cost function of a combinatorial problem to avoid or escape local minima traps in stochastic local search, which opens avenues for generalization to other optimization problems.

Title: Generalized Petermann factor of non-Hermitian systems at exceptional points
Authors: Julius Kullig, Jan Wiersig, Henning Schomerus
Abstract: The nonorthogonality of modes in open systems significantly modifies their resonant response, resulting in quantitative and qualitative deviations from Breit-Wigner resonance relations. For isolated resonances with a Lorentzian lineshape, the deviations amount to an enhancement of the resonance linewidth by the Petermann factor (PF), given by the overlap of left and right eigenmodes of the underlying effectively non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. The PF diverges at exceptional points (EPs), where resonance frequencies degenerate, and right and left eigenmodes are orthogonal to each other. This divergence signifies a qualitative departure from a Lorentzian lineshape, which has gained recent attention. In this work, we extend this concept to EPs, and describe how this EP PF manifests in a variety of physical scenarios. Firstly, we identify this PF in physical terms as an enhancement of the response of a system to external or parametric perturbations. Utilizing two natural orthogonally projected reference systems based on the right and left eigenvectors, we show that each choice carries a precise geometric interpretation that naturally extends the notion of the PF for isolated resonances to EPs. The two choices can be combined into an overall EP PF, which again can be expressed in purely geometric terms. Secondly, we illuminate the geometric mechanisms that determine the size of the EP PF, by considering the role of modes participating in the degeneracy and those that remain spectrally separated. Thirdly, we design a system to study the EP PF in a specific physical setup, consisting of two microrings coupled to a waveguide with embedded semitransparent mirrors. This example shows our approach yields a more accurate spectral response strength than conventional truncation. These results complete the description of systems at EPs in the same way as the original PF does for isolated resonances.

Title: A Qubit as a Bridge Between Statistical Mechanics and Quantum Dynamics
Authors: Manmeet Kaur, Somendra M. Bhattacharjee
Abstract: This work presents a unified perspective on thermal equilibrium and quantum dynamics by examining the simplest quantum system, a qubit, as a foundational model. We show that both the thermal partition function and the Loschmidt amplitude can be understood as extensions of a single analytic function along different paths in the complex plane. The zeros of Loschmidt amplitude encode dynamical features such as orthogonality, rate function singularities, and quantum speed limits, in analogy with the role of partition function zeros in equilibrium statistical mechanics. We further establish, through the Cauchy-Riemann equations, that the high-temperature specific heat corresponds to early-time evolution. The discussion follows a pedagogical progression from a single qubit to an interacting spin chain.

Title: Unveiling Nano-scale Crystal Deformation using Coherent X-ray Dynamical Diffraction
Authors: Longlong Wu, David Yang, Wei Wang, Shinjae Yoo, Ross J. Harder, Wonsuk Cha, Aiguo Li, Ian K. Robinson
Abstract: Quantitative visualization of internal deformation fields in crystalline materials helps bridge the gap between theoretical models and practical applications. Applying Bragg coherent diffraction imaging under X-ray dynamical diffraction conditions provides a promising approach to the longstanding challenge of investigating the deformation fields in micron-sized crystals. Here, we present an automatic differentiation-based Artificial Intelligence method that integrates dynamical scattering theory to accurately reconstruct deformation fields in large crystals. Using this forward model, our simulated and experimental results demonstrate that three-dimensional local strain information inside a large crystal can be accurately reconstructed under coherent X-ray dynamical diffraction conditions with Bragg coherent X-ray diffraction imaging. These findings open an avenue for extending the investigation of local deformation fields to microscale crystals while maintaining nanoscale resolution, leveraging the enhanced coherence and brightness of advanced X-ray sources.

Abstract: Utilizing quantum effects in nanoscopic devices has in the past mostly been accessible through academic cleanrooms and research foundries. Opening the quantum frontier for wider industrial applications likely requires the scale of well-established complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) foundries for manufacturing transistor-based quantum devices operable above subkelvin temperatures. Here, we operate a commercial 22-nm-node fully depleted silicon-on-insulator (FDSOI) CMOS device as dual parallel-connected charge-pumps for the implementation of a quantum current standard in the International System of Units (SI). We measure the accuracy of (1.2 +/- 0.1)E-3 A/A for this scalable architecture at 50 MHz with reference to SI-traceable voltage and resistance standards in a pumped helium system. Looking ahead we propose a practical monolithic CMOS chip that incorporates one million parallel-connected charge pumps along with on-chip control electronics. This can be operated as a table-top primary standard, generating quantum currents up to microampere levels.

Title: An equation of motion for unsteady frictional slip pulses
Authors: Eran Bouchbinder
Abstract: Frictional sliding, e.g., earthquakes along geological faults, are mediated either by frictional crack-like ruptures, where interfacial (fault) slip is accumulated during the entire sliding event, or by frictional pulse-like ruptures, featuring a finite length over which slip is accumulated. Our basic understanding of slip pulses, which are believed to dominate most crustal earthquakes, is still incomplete. Here, building on recent progress, we present an analytic equation of motion for rate-and-state frictional slip pulses, which are intrinsically unstable spatiotemporal objects, in terms of a single degree of freedom. The predictions of the equation are supported by large-scale simulations of growing pulses and reveal the origin of the slow development of their instability, which explains the dynamic relevance of pulses in a broad range of natural and manmade frictional systems.

Title: Electrical charge decay on dielectric surface in nitrogen/C4F7N mixtures
Authors: D. Prokop, M. Mrkvickova, J. Tungli, Z. Bonaventura, P. Dvorak, S. Kadlec, T. Hoder
Abstract: The decay of electrical charge on a dielectric surface in nitrogen-C4F7N (Novec4710, C4) mixtures is investigated using measurement of electric field via in-situ electric field-induced second harmonic (EFISH) technique. The charge is deposited on the surface of the alumina by generating a barrier discharge in the gap, and the amount of charge is determined from electrical current measurements and numerical modeling. For different admixtures (0, 10, and 50 percent) of C4F7N in nitrogen, the presence of surface charge is detected even 60 hours after charge deposition. It is found that C4F7N admixture lead to a significantly longer-lasting surface charge, indicating a slower charge decay. Using an isothermal charge decay model, charge traps are identified for pure nitrogen charge deposition, which are in agreement with results found in the literature. Charge deposition in C4F7N admixtures leads to modification or creation of new traps with higher trap energies. The EFISH measurements are used to determine the C4F7N nonlinear hyperpolarizability tensor component. Direct comparison of the experimental results from two developed methods (EFISH and electrical measurements) and the numerical model gives a closer insight into the surface charge spread over the dielectrics, resulting in surface charge density estimation.

Title: The Carrollian Kaleidoscope
Authors: Arjun Bagchi, Aritra Banerjee, Prateksh Dhivakar, Saikat Mondal, Ashish Shukla
Abstract: The Carroll group arises in the vanishing speed of light limit of the Poincaré group and was initially discarded as just a mathematical curiosity. However, recent developments have proved otherwise. Carroll and conformal Carroll symmetries are now ubiquitous, appearing in diverse physical phenomena starting from condensed matter physics to quantum gravity. This review aims to provide the reader a gateway into this fast-developing field. After an introduction and setting the stage with basics of the symmetry in question, we detail the construction of Carrollian and Carrollian Conformal field theories (CCFT). We then focus on applications. By far the most popular of these applications is in the context of the construction of holography in asymptotically flat spacetimes (AFS) in terms of a co-dimension one dual CCFT. We review the early work on AFS$_3$ /CCFT$_2$ before delving into an in-depth analysis for the construction of the dual to 4D AFS. Two other important sets of applications are in hydrodynamics and in condensed matter physics, which we discuss in detail. Carroll hydrodynamics is introduced as the $c\to 0$ limit of relativistic hydrodynamics first and then reconstructed from a symmetry based approach. Relations to ultrarelativistic flows and connections to the quark-gluon plasma are discussed with concrete examples of the Bjorken and Gubser flow models. In condensed matter applications, we cover connections to fractons, flat bands, and phase separation in Luttinger liquid models. To conclude, we give very brief outlines of other topics of interest including string theory and black hole horizons.

Authors: N. Massa, F. Cavaliere, D. Ferraro
Abstract: Motivated by recent developments in the field of multilevel quantum batteries, we present the model of a quantum device for energy storage with anharmonic level spacing, based on a superconducting circuit in the transmon regime. It is charged via the sequential interaction with a collection of identical and independent ancillary two-level systems. By means of a numerical analysis we show that, in case these ancillas are coherent, this kind of quantum battery can achieve remarkable performances for what it concerns the control of the stored energy and its extraction in regimes of parameters within reach in nowadays quantum circuits.

Title: Plasmonic properties of individual bismuth nanoparticles
Authors: Michael Foltýn, Michal Kvapil, Tomáš Šikola, Michal Horák
Abstract: Bismuth nanoparticles are being investigated due to their reported photothermal and photocatalytic properties. In this study, we synthesised spherical bismuth nanoparticles (50-600 nm) and investigated their structural and optical properties at the single particle level using analytical transmission electron microscopy. Our experimental results, supported by numerical simulations, demonstrate that bismuth nanoparticles support localised surface plasmon resonances, which can be tuned from the near-infrared to the ultraviolet spectral region by changing the nanoparticle size. Furthermore, plasmonic resonances demonstrate stability across the entire spectral bandwidth, enhancing the attractiveness of bismuth nanoparticles for applications over a wide spectral range. Bismuth's lower cost, biocompatibility, and oxidation resistance make it a suitable candidate for utilisation, particularly in industrial and large-scale plasmonic applications.

Title: Robust global tripartite entanglement in a mixed spin-($1$,$1/2$,$1$) Heisenberg trimer
Authors: Hana Vargová
Abstract: We rigorously analyze the global tripartite entanglement in a Heisenberg trimer with mixed spins-($1$,$1/2$,$1$) under varying exchange couplings between dissimilar and identical spins, magnetic fields, and temperatures. The global tripartite entanglement is quantified using the geometric mean of all three bipartite contributions, evaluated through negativity. We precisely map the regions of parameter space in which the trimer system exhibits spontaneous global entanglement. In addition, we classify the nature of the tripartite entangled states based on the distribution of reduced bipartite negativities among the spin dimers in the trimer. We further examine the thermal stability of global tripartite entanglement throughout the full parameter space. Special attention is given to the theoretical prediction of thermal robustness in a real three-spin complex, [Ni(bapa)(H$_2$0)]$_2$Cu(pba)(ClO$_4$)$_2$, where bapa stands for bis($3$-aminopropyl)amine, and pba denotes $1$,$3$-propylenebis(oxamato), which serves as an experimental realization of the mixed-spin ($1$,$1/2$,$1$) Heisenberg trimer. Notably, global entanglement in this system is predicted to persist up to approximately $100$ K and magnetic fields approaching $210$ T. Moreover, we uncover a thermally induced activation of robust global entanglement in regions where the ground state is biseparable. The magnitude of this thermal entanglement is remarkably high, nearly reaching a value of $1/2$, which has not been reported before. Finally, we propose a connection between the theoretically predicted tripartite entanglement, quantified via negativity derived from the density matrix, and the quantities measured directly or indirectly from various experiments.

Title: The quantification of a genuine tetrapartite entanglement in a mixed spin-(1/2,1) Heisenberg tetramer
Authors: Hana Vargová, Jozef Strečka
Abstract: The genuine tetrapartite entanglement of a mixed spin-(1/2,1) Heisenberg tetramer is quantified according to the three different approaches incorporated all seven global bisections existing within the tetrapartite system. The degree of entanglement of each bisection is evaluated through the bipartite negativity at zero and non-zero temperature taking into account ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic type of intra- ($J$) and inter-dimer ($J_1$) exchange coupling inside the square plaquette. Three utilized quantification methods based on the generalization of (i) a genuine tripartite negativity, (ii) a Coffman, Kundu and Wootters monogamy relation and (iii) a geometric average of complete trisections, result to the qualitatively and almost quantitatively identical behavior of a genuine tetrapartite negativity. It is shown that the genuine tetrapartite negativity exclusively arises from the antiferromagnetic-inter dimer $J_1>0$ coupling, whereas the character of with respect to $J$ ($J>0$ or $J<0$) determines its zero-temperature magnitude and its thermal stability with respect to the magnetic field and temperature. As is demonstrated for $0<J_1/J<1$ the genuine tetrapartite negativity is dramatically reduced due to the preference of magnetic arrangement involving two separable mixed spin-(1/2,1) dimers. In an opposite limit the genuine tetrapartite negativity is significantly stable with a threshold temperature proportional to the strength of an inter-dimer coupling $J_1$. It is found, that all three quantification procedures are insufficient to correctly describe the genuine tetrapartite negativity in a specific part of the parameter space with absence of relevant dimer separable states. Finally, the thermal stability of a genuine tetrapartite negativity is discussed in detail for selected geometries motivated by the real tetranuclear bimetallic complexes with a Cu$_2$Ni$_2$ magnetic core.

Title: Dislocations and crystallization dynamics of chiral soliton lattices
Authors: Minoru Eto, Kentaro Nishimura, Muneto Nitta
Abstract: Dislocations, as topological defects in crystal lattices, are fundamental to understanding plasticity in materials. Similar periodic structures also arise in continuum field theories, such as chiral soliton lattices (CSLs), which appear in condensed matter systems like chiral magnets and in high-energy contexts such as quantum chromodynamics in strong magnetic field or under rapid rotation. This work investigates whether dislocations can dynamically form within such emergent CSLs. The chiral sine-Gordon model, reduced from the aforementioned examples by certain truncations, is useful to determine the ground state but it cannot describe time evolution, lacks dynamical formation or leads to singular dislocations, because its equations of motion do not contain a topological term. We propose a field-theoretical model including the topological term coupled to external fields resolving these issues by modifying the topological term so it affects the dynamics. Using numerical simulations, we study the real-time formation of CSLs in two and three spatial dimensions. In 2D, edge dislocations emerge spontaneously, guiding soliton growth and later annihilating to leave a stable CSL. In 3D, both edge and screw dislocations form; the latter exhibits helical structure influenced by the external field. We find stable double helical screw dislocations looking like a double helix staircase or DNA. We then demonstrate the formation of helical dislocations and analyze how the external field strength affects CSL density and formation speed. Our results provide a novel theoretical framework for understanding dislocations in solitonic structures, connecting high-energy field theory with materials science phenomena.

Authors: Valerij Gurin
Abstract: The plasmonic optical absorption of the silica glasses containing copper selenide nanoparticles is simulated on the basis of Drude theory. The plasmonic resonance absorption is studied in dependence on plasmonic frequency, damping factor and the matrix dielectric function. The charge carrier concentration in the nanoparticles is evaluated through the plasmonic frequency for the spectra of closest correspondence to experimental. The plasmon resonance position and the width of maxima are varied throughout the visible and near-IR ranges for the above parameters of experimental glasses with Cu2-xSe nanoparticles.

Authors: Xiao-Wen Shang, Shu-Yi Liang, Guan-Ju Yan, Xin-Yang Jiang, Zi-Ming Yin, Hao Tang, Jian-Peng Dou, Ze-Kun Jiang, Yu-Quan Peng, Xian-Min Jin
Abstract: Quantum interference and entanglement are in the core of quantum computations. The fast spread of information in the quantum circuit helps to mitigate the circuit depth. Although the information scrambling in the closed systems has been proposed and tested in the digital circuits, how to measure the evolution of quantum correlations between systems and environments remains a delicate and open question. Here, we propose a photonic circuit to investigate the information scrambling in an open quantum system by implementing the collision model with cascaded Mach-Zehnder interferometers. We numerically simulate the photon propagation and find that the tripartite mutual information strongly depends on the system-environment and environment-environment interactions. We further reduce the number of observables and the number of shots required to reconstruct the density matrix by designing an enhanced compressed sensing. Our results provide a reconfigurable photonic platform for simulating open quantum systems and pave the way for exploring controllable dissipation and non-Markovianity in discrete-variable photonic computing.

Title: Loss of integrability in a system with two-photon interactions
Authors: Fabrizio Ramírez, David Villaseñor, Viani S. Morales-Guzmán, Darly Y. Castro, Jorge G. Hirsch
Abstract: Light-matter systems that exhibit two-photon interactions have emerged as powerful platforms for exploring quantum applications. In this work, we focus on the two-photon Dicke model, a system of significant experimental relevance that displays spectral collapse and undergoes a phase transition from a normal to a superradiant phase. We analyze the normal phase, where a classical limit with two degrees of freedom can be derived using a mean-field approximation. Our study presents a detailed investigation of the loss of integrability in the two-photon Dicke model, employing both quantum and classical diagnostics. These results allow us to explore various dynamical features of the system, including the onset of chaos and the existence of mixed phase-space behavior.

Title: Operator-space fragmentation and integrability in Pauli-Lindblad models
Authors: Dawid Paszko, Christopher J. Turner, Dominic C. Rose, Arijeet Pal
Abstract: The Lindblad equation for open quantum systems is central to our understanding of coherence and entanglement in the presence of Markovian dissipation. In closed quantum systems Hilbert-space fragmentation is an effective mechanism for slowing decoherence in the presence of constrained interactions. We develop a general mechanism for operator-space fragmentation of mixed states, undergoing Lindbladian evolution generated by frustration-free Hamiltonians and Pauli-string jump operators. The interplay of generator algebras of dissipative and unitary dynamics leads to a hierarchical partitioning of operator and real space into dynamically disconnected subspaces, which we elucidate using the bond and commutant algebras of superoperators. This fragmentation fundamentally constrains information spreading in open systems and provides new mechanisms to control highly entangled quantum states and dynamics. Our approach yields two key advances. Firstly, we introduce frustration graphs in operator space as a compact representation to construct effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonians in individual fragments and diagnose their free-fermion solvability. Secondly, using these methods we uncover a range of universal dynamical regimes in Pauli-Lindblad models, exhibiting symmetry enriched quantum chaos and integrability in operator-space fragments. Furthermore, we show dissipation-driven phase transitions corresponding to exceptional points in the Lindbladian spectrum whose signatures are captured by spectral statistics and operator dynamics. These results establish operator-space fragmentation as a fundamental principle for open quantum systems, with immediate implications for quantum error correction, where protected subspaces could emerge naturally from fragmentation. Our framework provides a systematic approach to discover and characterize novel non-equilibrium phases in open quantum many-body systems.

Title: Polar solitons in a nonpolar chiral soft matter system
Authors: Jiahao Chen, Xingzhou Tang, Yang Ding, Susanta Chakraborty, Satoshi Aya, Bingxiang Li, Yanqing Lu
Abstract: Polar solitons, i.e., solitonic waves accompanying asymmetry of geometry or phase, have garnered attention in polar systems, such as ferroelectric or magnetoelectric materials, where they play a critical role in topological transitions and nonreciprocal responses to external fields. A key question is whether such polar solitons can emerge in nonpolar systems, where intrinsic polarity is absent. Here, we demonstrate an unprecedented polar soliton with nematic order in a nonpolar and chiral liquid crystal system by applying an alternating electric field. The soliton is corn-kernel-shaped, displaying a pair of oppositely charged topological defects at its two ends. While head-to-head collision between the solitons leads to repulsion, head-to-tail collision attracts the solitons into a single polar soliton. A rich variety of solitonic kinetics, such as rectilinear translation and circulation motions, can be activated by controlling the voltage and frequency of an electric field. Simulations reveal that the formation of the polar solitons is achieved through balancing the electric and nematic elastic energies, while the flexoelectric effect drives their rotational behaviors. The discovery of polar solitons in nonpolar systems expands the understanding of topological solitons, opening new avenues for dynamic control in soft matter systems, with potential applications in nonreciprocal responsive materials and topological information storage.

Title: 3-dimensional plasmonic nanomotors driven by Optical Pulling Forces
Authors: Guillermo Serrera, Yoshito Y. Tanaka, Pablo Albella
Abstract: Light-matter interactions generally involve momentum exchange between incident photons and the target object giving rise to optical forces and torques. While typically weak, they become significant at the nanoscale, driving intense research interest in the exploitation of photon recoil to drive micro- and nanostructures. While great progress has been attained in controlling transversal degrees of freedom, three-dimensional movement remains challenging, particularly due to the impractical realization of pulling forces that oppose the direction of incident light. Here we theoretically present a novel nanomotor design that enables control over both transverse and longitudinal motion. This design exploits coupling between an azimuthally polarized Bessel beam and a dielectric glass cylinder to realistically achieve optical pulling forces. At the same time, asymmetric plasmonic dimers, embedded within the cylinder, provide lateral motion, through asymmetric scattering under plane wave illumination. We further demonstrate that unwanted displacements and rotations can be restrained, even at long illumination times. Our design unlocks a new degree of freedom in motion control, allowing for pulling, pushing, and lateral movement by simply tuning the polarization or switching between plane waves and Bessel beams.

Title: Hopf-Induced Desynchronization
Authors: Seungjae Lee, Lennart J. Kuklinski, Moritz Thümler, Marc Timme
Abstract: The emergence of synchrony essentially underlies the functionality of many systems across physics, biology and engineering. In all established synchronization phase transitions so far, a stable synchronous state is connected to a stable incoherent state: For continuous transitions, stable synchrony directly connects to stable incoherence at a critical point, whereas for discontinuous transitions, stable synchrony is connected to stable incoherence via an additional unstable branch. Here we present a novel type of transition between synchrony and incoherence where the synchronous state does not connect to the state of incoherence. We uncover such transitions in the complexified Kuramoto model with their variables and coupling strength parameter analytically continued. Deriving a self-consistency equation for a quaternion order parameter that we propose helps to mathematically pin down the mechanisms underlying this transition type. Local numerical analysis suggests that the transition is linked to a Hopf bifurcation destabilizing synchrony, in contrast to branching point bifurcations established for the transition between synchrony and incoherence so far.

Title: Squeezing Towards the Heisenberg Limit with Locally Interacting Spins
Authors: Nazli Ugur Koyluoglu, Shankari V. Rajagopal, Gabriel L. Moreau, Jacob A. Hines, Ognjen Marković, Monika Schleier-Smith
Abstract: We propose a robust approach to spin squeezing with local interactions that approaches the Heisenberg limit of phase sensitivity. To generate the requisite entanglement, we generalize the paradigmatic two-axis countertwisting Hamiltonian -- akin to squeezing by parametric amplification -- to systems with power-law interactions, incorporating a Heisenberg coupling that aids in spreading correlations and protects the collective spin coherence. The resulting time to approach the Heisenberg limit scales sublinearly with particle number in 2D dipolar and 3D van der Waals interacting systems. Our protocol is robust to disorder and density fluctuations, and can be implemented in near-term experiments with molecules, Rydberg atoms, and solid-state spins.

Title: High-accuracy inference using HfO$_x$S$_y$/HfS$_2$ Memristors
Authors: Aferdita Xhameni, Antonio Lombardo
Abstract: We demonstrate high accuracy classification for handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset ($\sim$98.00$\%$) and RGB images from the CIFAR-10 dataset ($\sim$86.80$\%$) by using resistive memories based on a 2D van-der-Waals semiconductor: hafnium disulfide (HfS$_2$). These memories are fabricated via dry thermal oxidation, forming vertical crossbar HfO$_x$S$_y$/HfS$_2$ devices with a highly-ordered oxide-semiconductor structure. Our devices operate without electroforming or current compliance and exhibit multi-state, non-volatile resistive switching, allowing resistance to be tuned using voltage pulse trains. Using low-energy potentiation and depression pulses (0.7V-0.995V, 160ns-350ns), we achieve 31 ($\sim$5 bits) stable conductance states with high linearity, symmetry, and low variation over 100 cycles. Key performance metrics-such as weight update, quantisation, and retention-are extracted from these experimental devices. These characteristics are used to simulate neural networks with our resistive memories as weights. Neural networks are trained on state-of-the-art (SOTA) digital hardware (CUDA cores) and a baseline inference accuracy is extracted. IBM's Analog Hardware Acceleration Kit (AIHWKIT) is used to modify and remap digital weights in the pretrained network, based on the characteristics of our devices. Simulations account for factors like conductance linearity, device variation, and converter resolution. In both image recognition tasks, we demonstrate excellent performance, similar to SOTA, with only $<$0.07$\%$ and $<$1.00$\%$ difference in inference accuracy for the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets respectively. The forming-free, compliance-free operation, fast switching, low energy consumption, and high accuracy classification demonstrate the potential of HfO$_x$S$_y$/HfS$_2$-based resistive memories for energy-efficient neural network acceleration and neuromorphic computing.

Title: Quantum Potts Models on the Sierpiński Pyramid
Authors: Roman Krčmár, Mária Zelenayová, Jozef Genzor, Libor Caha, Peter Rapčan, Tomotoshi Nishino, Andrej Gendiar
Abstract: Phase transition of the two- and three-state quantum Potts models on the Sierpiński pyramid are studied by means of a tensor network framework, the higher-order tensor renormalization group method. Critical values of the transverse magnetic field and the magnetic exponent $\beta$ are evaluated. Despite the fact that the Hausdorff dimension of the Sierpiński pyramid is exactly two $( = \log_2^{~} 4)$, the obtained critical properties show that the effective dimension is lower than two.

Title: Simultaneous sampling of multiple transition channels using adaptive paths of collective variables
Authors: Alberto Pérez de Alba Ortíz, Bernd Ensing
Abstract: We present a molecular simulation method to simultaneously find multiple transition pathways, and their associated free-energy profiles. The scheme extends path-metadynamics (PMD) [Phys. Rev. Lett. 109, 020601 (2012)] with multiple paths and repulsive walkers (multiPMD). We illustrate multiPMD for two C7eq-to-C7ax paths in Ace-Ala-Nme and six PPII-to-PPII paths in Ace-(Pro)4-Nme. We also show a scheme to render an interpretable "PathMap", showing the free energy ridges between paths, as well as the branching and merging of the transition channels. MultiPMD is a flexible and promising method for systems with competing or controversial pathways, which appear in many biomolecular systems, including proteins and nucleic acids.

Title: Single-dislocation phonons: atomic-scale measurement and their thermal properties
Authors: Yuehui Li, Bo Han, Xiaolong Yang, Ruilin Mao, Fachen Liu, Ruochen Shi, Ruishi Qi, Xiaorui Hao, Ning Li, Bingyao Liu, Xiaomei Li, Jinlong Du, Ji Chen, Wu Li, Peng Gao
Abstract: Nanoscale defects such as dislocations, have a significant impact on the phonon thermal transport properties in non-metallic materials. To unravel these effects, understanding of defect phonon modes is essential. Herein, at the atomic scale, the localized phonons of individual dislocation at a Si/Ge interface are measured via monochromated electron energy loss spectroscopy in a scanning transmission electron microscope. These modes are then correlated with the local microstructure, further revealing the dislocation effects on the local thermal transport properties. The dislocation causes phonon redshift in several milli-electron-volts within about two to four nanometers of the core, where both of the strain field and Ge-segregation play roles. With the presence of dislocation, the local interfacial thermal conductance can be either enhanced or reduced, depending on the complex interaction and competition between lattice-disorder (dislocation) and element-disorder (heterointerface mixing and Ge-segregation) at the interface. These findings provide valuable insights to improve the thermal properties of thermoelectric generators and thermal management systems through proper defect engineering.

Title: Resonantly enhanced superconductivity mediated by spinor condensates
Authors: Giacomo Bighin, Puneet A. Murthy, Nicolò Defenu, Tilman Enss
Abstract: Achieving strong interactions in fermionic many-body systems is a major theme of research in condensed matter physics. It is well-known that interactions between fermions can be mediated through a bosonic medium, such as a phonon bath or Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). Here we show that such induced attraction can be resonantly enhanced when the bosonic medium is a two-component spinor BEC. The strongest interaction is achieved by tuning the boson-boson scattering to the quantum critical spinodal point of the BEC where the sound velocity vanishes. The fermion pairing gap and the superconducting critical temperature can thus be dramatically enhanced. We propose two experimental realizations of this scenario, with exciton-polariton systems in two-dimensional semiconductors and ultracold atomic Bose-Fermi mixtures.

Title: Diamond-shaped evolution of the superconducting interference pattern in NbTiN weak-link Josephson junctions
Authors: Kui Zhao, Jianfei Xiao, Huaiyuan Liu, Linfeng Tu, Yiwen Ma, Jiangbo He, Mingli Liu, Ruiyang Jiang, Zhongmou Jia, Shang Zhu, Yunteng Shi, Zhaozheng Lyu, Jie Shen, Guangtong Liu, Li Lu, Fanming Qu
Abstract: The application of in-plane magnetic fields to Josephson junctions enables fundamental exploration of quantum phenomena, including Zeeman-driven 0-$\pi$ transitions and planar topological superconductivity. However, intrinsic orbital effects arising from nanoscale rippled geometries in practical devices can dominate phase interference signatures, complicating their interpretation. Here, we experimentally probe superconducting interference in NbTiN weak-link Josephson junctions under combined perpendicular and in-plane magnetic fields. The critical supercurrent reveals a distinct diamond-shaped interference pattern, with nodes progressively opening and evolving into V-shaped features, reminiscent of suppression-recovery patterns associated with 0-$\pi$ transitions. We theoretically analyze the interplay between orbital effects from rippled geometries and non-uniform supercurrent density distributions, demonstrating that their synergistic interaction could reproduce the experimentally observed interference evolution. Our findings elucidate how geometric imperfections and current inhomogeneity cooperatively reshape phase interference, providing critical insights into orbital-dominated phenomena in Josephson systems.

Title: Force Dipole Interactions in Tubular Fluid Membranes
Authors: Samyak Jain, Rickmoy Samanta
Abstract: We construct viscous fluid flow sourced by a force dipole embedded in a cylindrical fluid membrane, coupled to external embedding fluids. We find analytic expressions for the flow, in the limit of infinitely long and thin tubular membranes. We utilize this solution to formulate the in-plane dynamics of a pair of pusher-type dipoles along the cylinder surface. We find that a mutually perpendicular dipole pair move together along helical geodesics, thus acting as curvature checkers, analogous to vortex dipoles. Since the cylindrical geometry breaks the in-plane rotational symmetry of the membrane, there is a difference in flows along the axial and transverse directions of the cylinder. This in turn leads to anisotropic hydrodynamic interaction between the dipoles and is remarkably different from flat and spherical fluid membranes. In particular, the flow along the compact direction of the cylinder has a local rigid rotation term (independent of the angular coordinate but decays along the axis of the cylinder). Due to this feature of the flow, we observe that the interacting dipole pair initially situated along the axial direction exhibits an overall drift along the compact angular direction of the tubular fluid membrane. We find that the drift for the dipole pair increases linearly with time. Our results are relevant for non-equilibrium dynamics of motor proteins in tubular membranes arising in nature, as well as in-vitro experiments (25).

Title: Noise-dissipation relation for nonlinear electronic circuits
Authors: Léopold Van Brandt, Jean-Charles Delvenne
Abstract: An extension of fluctuation-dissipation theorem is used to derive a "speed limit" theorem for nonlinear electronic devices. This speed limit provides a lower bound on the dissipation that is incurred when transferring a given amount of electric charge in a certain amount of time with a certain noise level (average variance of the current). This bound, which implies a high energy dissipation for fast, low-noise operations (such as switching a bit in a digital memory), brings together recent results of stochastic thermodynamics into a form that is usable for practical nonlinear electronic circuits, as we illustrate on a switching circuit made of an nMOS pass gate in a state-of-the-art industrial technology.

Title: Higher vortexability: zero field realization of higher Landau levels
Authors: Manato Fujimoto, Daniel E. Parker, Junkai Dong, Eslam Khalaf, Ashvin Vishwanath, Patrick Ledwith
Abstract: The rise of moiré materials has led to experimental realizations of integer and fractional Chern insulators in small or vanishing magnetic fields. At the same time, a set of minimal conditions sufficient to guarantee a Abelian fractional state in a flat band were identified, namely "ideal" or "vortexable" quantum geometry. Such vortexable bands share essential features with the lowest Landau level, while excluding the need for more fine-tuned aspects such as flat Berry curvature. A natural and important generalization is to ask if such conditions can be extended to capture the quantum geometry of higher Landau levels, particularly the first (1LL), where non-Abelian states at $\nu = 1/2,2/5$ are known to be competitive. The possibility of realizing these states at zero magnetic field , and perhaps even more exotic ones, could become a reality if we could identify the essential structure of the 1LL in Chern bands. In this work, we introduce a precise definition of 1LL quantum geometry, along with a figure of merit that measures how closely a given band approaches the 1LL. We apply the definition to identify two models with 1LL structure -- a toy model of double bilayer twisted graphene and a more realistic model of strained Bernal graphene.

Title: Chirped amplitude mode in photo-excited superconductors
Authors: Thomas Blommel, Jason Kaye, Yuta Murakami, Emanuel Gull, Denis Golež
Abstract: Using a state-of-the-art numerical scheme, we show that the Higgs mode under excitation exhibits chirped oscillations and exponential decay when fluctuations are included. This is in stark contrast to conventional BCS collisionless dynamics which predict power-law decay and the absence of chirping. The chirped amplitude mode enables us to determine the local modification of the effective potential even when the system is in a long-lived prethermal state. We then show that this chirped amplitude mode is an experimentally observable quantity since the photoinduced (super)current in pump-probe experiments serves as an efficient proxy for the order parameter dynamics, including the chirped dynamics. Our result is based on the attractive Hubbard model using dynamical mean-field theory within the symmetry-broken state after a excitation across the superconducting gap. Since the collective response involves long timescales, we extend the hierarchical low-rank compression method for nonequilibrium Green's functions to symmetry-broken states and show that it serves as an efficient representation despite long-lived memory kernels.

Title: Spatial topological materials
Authors: Qinghua He, Wenlong Gao, Feng Liu
Abstract: Conventional topological materials rely on band-specific mechanisms -- such as band inversion or spin-orbit coupling -- to realize nontrivial topological invariants. Here, we introduce a symmetry-driven paradigm for generating topological states, exploiting a translational symmetry $\mathcal{L}$ that couples two maximal Wyckoff positions. This symmetry induces robust band degeneracies independent of band structure details, allowing us to classify $\mathcal{L}$ as trivial or nontrivial by quantized electric multipoles. Crucially, for nontrivial $\mathcal{L}$, symmetry-protected edge and corner states emerge universally across all symmetry-compatible insulating, semi-metallic, and metallic phases, irrespective of specific band structure. We demonstrate this in a $C_4$-symmetric model and validate it using an experimentally feasible dielectric photonic crystal engineered with $\mathcal{L}$ symmetry. Through full-wave simulation, we observe directional edge modes and localized corner modes, with the former selectively excited by harmonic point sources spatially shifted by $\mathcal{L}$ at a fixed frequency.

Title: A framework for the use of generative modelling in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics
Authors: Karl J Friston, Maxwell J D Ramstead, Dalton A R Sakthivadivel
Abstract: We discuss an approach to mathematically modelling systems made of objects that are coupled together, using generative models of the dependence relationships between states (or trajectories) of the things comprising such systems. This broad class includes open or non-equilibrium systems and is especially relevant to self-organising systems. The ensuing variational free energy principle (FEP) has certain advantages over using random dynamical systems explicitly, notably, by being more tractable and offering a parsimonious explanation of why the joint system evolves in the way that it does, based on the properties of the coupling between system components. Using the FEP allows us to model the dynamics of an object as if it were a process of variational inference, because variational free energy (or surprisal) is a Lyapunov function for its dynamics. In short, we argue that using generative models to represent and track relations among subsystems leads us to a particular statistical theory of interacting systems. Conversely, this theory enables us to construct nested models that respect the known relations among subsystems. We point out that the fact that a physical object conforms to the FEP does not necessarily imply that this object performs inference in the literal sense; rather, it is a useful explanatory fiction which replaces the `explicit' dynamics of the object with an `implicit' flow on free energy gradients -- a fiction that may or may not be entertained by the object itself.

Title: Transport signatures of single and multiple Floquet Majorana modes in one-dimensional Rashba nanowire and Shiba chain
Authors: Debashish Mondal, Rekha Kumari, Tanay Nag, Arijit Saha
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the transport signature of single and multiple Floquet Majorana end modes~(FMEMs), appearing in an experimentally feasible setup with Rashba nanowire~(NW) placed in closed proximity to a conventional $s$-wave superconductor, in the presence of an external Zeeman field. Periodic drive causes the anomalous $\pi$-modes to emerge in addition to the regular $0$-modes in the driven system where the former does not exhibit any static analog. For single $0$- and/or $\pi$-FMEM, differential conductance exhibits a quantized value of $2e^{2}/h$ while we consider the sum over all the photon sectors, supporting Floquet sum rule. We examine the stability of this summed conductance against random onsite disorder. We further investigate the summed conductance in several cases hosting multiple~(more than one) $0$- or $\pi$-modes at the end of the NW. In these cases, we obtain quantized values of $n_{M}\times 2e^{2}/h$ in summed differential conductance with $n_{M}$ being the number of modes~($0$ or $\pi$) localized at one end of the NW. We repeat our analysis for another experimentally realizable model system known as helical Shiba chain. Moreover, we corroborate our results by computing the differential conductance for FMEMs using non-equilibrium Green's function method. Our work opens up the possibility of studying the transport signatures of FMEMs in these realistic models.

Abstract: With the growing prevalence of AI, demand increases for hardware that mimics the brain's ability to extract structure from limited data. In the retina, ganglion cells detect features from sparse inputs via lateral inhibition, where neurons antagonistically suppress activity of neighbouring cells. Biological neurons exhibit diverse heterogeneous nonlinear responses, linked to robust learning and strong performance in low-data regimes. Here, we introduce a bio-inspired 'retinomorphic' photonic system where spatially-competing lasing modes in a network laser act as heterogeneous, inhibitively-coupled neurons - enabling few-shot classification and segmentation. This compact (150 micron) silicon-compatible scheme addresses key challenges in photonic computing: physical nonlinearity and spatial footprint. We report 98.05% and 87.85% accuracy on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST, and 90.12% on BreaKHis cancer diagnosis - outperforming software CNNs including EfficientNet in few-shot and class-imbalanced regimes. We demonstrate combined segmentation and classification on the HAM10k skin lesion dataset, achieving DICE and Jaccard scores of 84.49% and 74.80%. These results establish a new class of nonlinear photonic hardware for versatile, data-efficient neuromorphic computing.

Title: Casimir-Lifshitz force with graphene: theory versus experiment, role of spatial non-locality and of losses
Authors: Pablo Rodriguez-Lopez, Mauro Antezza
Abstract: We analyze the impact of spatial non-locality and losses in the electromagnetic response of graphene on the Casimir-Lifshitz interaction. To this purpose, we calculate the Casimir-Lifshitz force (CLF) between a gold sphere and a graphene-coated SiO$_2$ plane and compare our finding with the recent experiment in PRL {\bf 126}, 206802 (2021) and PRB {\bf 104}, 085436 (2021). We calculated the CLF using three different models for the electromagnetic response of graphene: electric conductivity using a non-local and lossy Kubo model, electric conductivity using the local and lossy Kubo model, and the non-local and lossless polarization operator model. The relation between these three models has been recently explored in PRB {\bf 111}, 115428 (2025). We show that, for the parameters of the available experiments, the theoretical predictions for the Casimir-Lifshitz force using the three models are practically identical (having a relative differences smaller than $10^{-3}$). This implies that for those given experiments, both non-local and lossy effects in the graphene response are completely negligible. We also find that this experiment cannot distinguish between the Drude and Plasma prescriptions for the involved materials (gold and graphene). Our findings are relevant for present and future comparisons with experimental measurement of the Casimir-Lifshitz force involving graphene structures. Indeed, we show that an extremely simple local Kubo model for the electric conductivity, explicitly depending on Dirac mass, chemical potential, losses and temperature, is largely enough for a totally comprehensive comparison with typical experimental configurations. We also show how the Polarization tensor must be used and modified in general, for phenomena needing a more fine response function, i.e. requiring both the spatial non-locality and losses.

Title: Topological Kondo semimetals emulated in hetero-bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides
Authors: Fang Xie, Lei Chen, Yuan Fang, Qimiao Si
Abstract: The moiré structure of AB-stacked $\rm{MoTe_2/WSe_2}$ represents a natural platform to realize Kondo lattice models, due to the discrepancy of the bandwidth between the individual layers. Here, we study this system at the commensurate filling of $\nu_{\rm tot}=2$. Our focus is on the $1+1$ filling setting of $\nu_{\rm Mo} =\nu_{\rm W}=1$, which enables a Kondo lattice description. We find a Kondo semimetal due to the sizable intra-orbital hopping among the electrons in the $\rm{MoTe_2}$ layer. The Kondo-driven (emergent) flat band is naturally pinned to the Fermi energy. When combined with the inherent topology of the electronic structure, a topological Kondo semimetal phase ensues. We calculate the valley Hall response and, due to the breaking of inversion symmetry, also identify a spontaneous Hall effect. There is a Berry curvature dodecapole, which leads to a fourth-order spontaneous Hall effect in the perturbative regime of the electric field that is further amplified in the non-perturbative regime. As such, the system provides a tunable setting to simulate topological Kondo semimetals. Finally, we discuss the pathways that connect the physics realized here to the Weyl Kondo semimetals and their proximate phases that have been advanced in recent years in topological Kondo lattice models and materials.

Title: Surface Tension of a Topological Phase
Authors: Saikat Mondal, Adhip Agarwala
Abstract: In interacting topological systems, Landau-like order parameters interplay with the band topology of fermions. The physics of domain formation in such systems can get significantly altered due to the presence of topological fermions. In this work we show that coupling a topological fermionic field to a scalar field can drastically modify the nucleation processes of the scalar field. We find that existence of non-trivial fermionic boundary modes on the nucleating droplets of the scalar field leads to substantial quantum corrections to the surface tension. This leads to an increase in the size of the critical nucleus beyond which unrestricted droplet growth happens. To illustrate the phenomena we devise a minimal model of fermions in a Chern insulating system coupled to a classical Ising field in two spatial dimensions. Using a combination of analytic and numerical methods we conclusively demonstrate that topological phases have a characteristic quantum surface tension. Apart from material systems, our work opens up a host of questions regarding the impact of fermionic topological terms on classical phase transitions and associated criticality.

Title: Suppression of the Mott insulating phase in the particle-hole asymmetric Hubbard model
Authors: Mateus Marques, Bruno M. de Souza Melo, Alexandre R. Rocha, Caio Lewenkopf, Luis G. G. V. Dias da Silva
Abstract: We explore the phase diagram of the Mott metal-insulator transition (MIT), focusing on the effects of particle-hole asymmetry (PHA) in the single-band Hubbard model. Our dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) study reveals that the introduction of PHA in the model significantly influences the critical temperature ($T_c$) and interaction strength ($U_c$), as well as the size of the co-existence region of metallic and insulating phases at low temperatures. Specifically, as the system is moved away from particle-hole symmetry, $T_c$ decreases and $U_c$ increases, indicating a suppression of the insulating phase and the strengthening of the metallic behavior. Additionally, the first-order transition line between metallic and insulating phases is better defined in the model with PHA, leading to a reduced co-existence region at $T<T_c$. Moreover, we propose that the MIT can be characterized by the charge density, which serves as a viable alternative to zero-frequency spectral density typically used in DMFT calculations. Our findings provide new insights into the role of particle-hole asymmetry in the qualitative and quantitative characterization of the MIT even in a very simple system.

Title: Exploring functionalized Zr$_2$N and Sc$_2$N MXenes as superconducting candidates with $\textit{ab initio}$ calculations
Authors: Alpin N. Tatan, Osamu Sugino
Abstract: We study new superconductor candidates in functionalized MXenes Zr$_2$NS$_2$, Zr$_2$NCl$_2$, and Sc$_2$NCl$_2$ with $\textit{ab initio}$ calculations based on density functional theory for superconductors (SCDFT). The superconducting transition temperature $(T_c)$ at ambient pressure is predicted to reach 9.48 K (Zr$_2$NS$_2$), with potential further improvements under applied strain. We note that the changes in the profiles of superconducting gap $(\Delta)$ and electron-phonon coupling $(\lambda)$ across the Fermi surface may be influenced by their modified electronic bandstructure components.

Title: Exciton-Enhanced Superconductivity in Monolayer Films of Aluminum
Authors: Junhui Cao, Alexey Kavokin
Abstract: The BCS theory has achieved widespread success in describing conventional superconductivity. However, when the length scale reaches the atomic limit, the reduced dimensionality may lead to the quantum breakdown resulting in unpredictable superconducting behaviors. It has been exper imentally evidenced that the critical temperature is strongly enhanced in the monolayer films of FeSe/STO and epitaxial Aluminum. Here, we propose the exciton mechanism of superconductivity as a possible reason for the enhanced superconductivity in hybrid superconductor-semiconductor structures. The exciton-induced Cooper pairing may lead to the larger energy gaps and higher critical temperatures as compared to those caused by the phonon induced superconductivity. A detailed comparison of the theory and experimental results of Ref. 1 reveals the possibility of exciton-induced superconductivity in thin films of Aluminum near the monolayer limit.

Title: Global thermodynamic manifold for conservative control of stochastic systems
Authors: Jordan R. Sawchuk, David A. Sivak
Abstract: Optimal control of stochastic systems plays a central role in nonequilibrium physics, with applications in the study of biological molecular motors and the design of single-molecule experiments. While exact analytic solutions to optimization problems are rare, under slow driving conditions, the problem can be reformulated geometrically solely in terms of equilibrium properties. In this framework, minimum-work protocols are geodesics on a thermodynamic manifold whose metric is a generalized friction tensor. Here, we introduce a new foundation for this friction-tensor formalism for conservatively driven systems. Under complete control of the potential energy, a global thermodynamic manifold (on which points are identified with instantaneous energy landscapes) has as its metric a full-control friction tensor. Arbitrary partial-control friction tensors arise naturally as inherited metrics on submanifolds of this global manifold. Leveraging a simple mathematical relationship between system dynamics and the geometry of the global manifold, we derive new expressions for the friction tensor that offer powerful tools for interpretation and computation of friction tensors and minimum-work protocols. Our results elucidate a connection between relaxation and dissipation in slowly driven systems and suggest optimization heuristics. We demonstrate the utility of these developments in three illustrative examples.

Title: Boundary topological insulators and superconductors of Altland-Zirnbauer tenfold classes
Authors: Xun-Jiang Luo, Fengcheng Wu
Abstract: In a class of systems, there are gapped boundary-localized states described by a boundary Hamiltonian. The topological classification of gapped boundary Hamiltonians, same as the standard tenfold way for gapped bulk states, can lead to the emergence of boundary topological insulators (TIs) and superconductors (TSCs). In this work, we present a theoretical study of boundary TIs and TSCs of the full Altland-Zirnbauer tenfold symmetry classes. Based on the boundary projection analyses for a $d$-dimensional Dirac continuum model, we demonstrate that nontrivial boundary topology can arise at a $(d-n)$-dimensional boundary if the Dirac model incorporates ($n+1$) mass terms with $0<n<d$ although its bulk and $(d-1)$D, $\cdots$, $(d-n+1)$D boundaries are topologically trivial. Furthermore, we present a unified criterion for the emergence of nontrivial boundary topology by extending bulk classification within the context of the Dirac model, which provides a unified framework for nontrivial bulk and boundary topology. Inspired by the Dirac continuum model analysis, we further construct bulk lattice Hamiltonians for realizing boundary TIs and TSCs of the full Altland-Zirnbauer tenfold symmetry classes, which enables the realization of higher-order TIs and TSCs in arbitrary dimensions with arbitrary orders. We analyze some typical examples of the constructed boundary TIs and TSCs in physical dimensions.

Title: A Time-Dependent Ginzburg-Landau Framework for Sample-Specific Simulation of Superconductors for SRF Applications
Authors: Aiden V. Harbick, Mark K. Transtrum
Abstract: Modern superconducting radio frequency (SRF) applications demand precise control over material properties across multiple length scales - from microscopic composition, to mesoscopic defect structures, to macroscopic cavity geometry. We present a time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) framework that incorporates spatially varying parameters derived from experimental measurements and ab initio calculations, enabling realistic, sample-specific simulations. As a demonstration, we model Sn-deficient islands in Nb$_3$Sn and calculate the field at which vortex nucleation first occurs for various defect configurations. These thresholds serve as a predictive tool for identifying defects likely to degrade SRF cavity performance. We then simulate the resulting dissipation and show how aggregate contributions from multiple small defects can reproduce trends consistent with high-field $Q$-slope behavior observed experimentally. Our results offer a pathway for connecting microscopic defect properties to macroscopic SRF performance using a computationally efficient mesoscopic model.

Title: Thermodynamic uncertainty relation for systems with active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particles
Authors: Hyeong-Tark Han, Jae Sung Lee, Jae-Hyung Jeon
Abstract: Thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs) delineate tradeoff relations between the thermodynamic cost and the magnitude of an observable's fluctuation. While TURs have been established for various nonequilibrium systems, their applicability to systems influenced by active noise remains largely unexplored. Here, we present an explicit expression of TUR for systems with active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particles (AOUPs). Our findings reveal that active noise introduces modifications to the terms associated with the thermodynamic cost in the TUR expression. The altered thermodynamic cost encompasses not only the conventional entropy production but also the energy consumption induced by the active noise. We examine the capability of this TUR as an accurate estimator of the extent of anomalous diffusion in systems with active noise driven by a constant force in free space. By introducing the concept of a contracted probability density function, we derive a steady-state TUR tailored to this system. Moreover, through the adoption of a new scaling parameter, we enhance and optimize the TUR bound further. Our results demonstrate that active noise tends to hinder accurate estimation of the anomalous diffusion extent. Our study offers a systematic approach for exploring the fluctuation nature of biological systems operating in active environments.

Title: Vibrational similarities in jamming-unjamming of polycrystalline and disordered granular packings
Authors: Juan C. Petit, Saswati Ganguly, Matthias Sperl
Abstract: We investigate the vibrational properties of polycrystalline monodisperse and disordered bidisperse granular packings during jamming and unjamming using discrete element method simulations. Both systems deviate from Debye scaling at low frequencies $(\omega)$, but only bidisperse packings exhibit a low-$\omega$ plateau. The low $\omega$ exponent ($\alpha$) in bidisperse packings evolves smoothly from zero (plateau) to near one (Debye scaling) with increasing packing fraction, whereas in polycrystalline packings, it changes discontinuously near jamming/unjamming, due to the nature of the contact network rearrangements. Despite structural modifications during the compression-decompression cycle, the exponent remains unchanged at the same distance from jamming density, regardless of the history. Nonaffine displacements and contact orientational order further confirm that structural features that impact low-$\omega$ vibrational states and, hence, mechanical properties are largely restored upon decompression, reinforcing vibrational similarities between jamming and unjamming states.

Title: Magic sizes enable minimal-complexity, high-fidelity assembly of programmable shells
Authors: Botond Tyukodi, Fernando Caballero, Daichi Hayakawa, Douglas M. Hall, W. Benjamin Rogers, Gregory M. Grason, Michael F. Hagan
Abstract: Recent advances in synthetic methods enable designing subunits that self-assemble into structures with precise, finite sizes and well-defined architectures, but yields are frequently suppressed by the formation of off-target metastable structures. Increasing the complexity (the number of distinct subunit types) can inhibit off-target structures, but leads to slower kinetics and higher synthesis costs. Here, we study icosahedral shells formed of programmable triangular subunits as a model system, and identify design principles that produce the highest target yield at the lowest complexity. We use a symmetry-based construction to create a range of design complexities, starting from the maximal symmetry Caspar-Klug assembly up to the fully addressable, zero-symmetry assembly. Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations reveal that the most prominent defects leading to off-target assemblies are disclinations at sites of rotational symmetry. We derive symmetry-based rules for identifying the optimal (lowest-complexity, highest-symmetry) design that inhibits these disclinations, leading to robust, high-fidelity assembly of targets with arbitrarily large, yet precise, finite sizes. The optimal complexity varies non-monotonically with target size, with `magic' sizes appearing for high-symmetry designs in which symmetry axes do not intersect vertices of the triangular net. The optimal designs at magic sizes require 12 times fewer inequivalent interaction-types than the (minimal symmetry) fully addressable construction, which greatly reduces the timescale and experimental cost required to achieve high fidelity assembly of large targets. This symmetry-based principle for pruning off-target assembly generalizes to diverse architectures with different topologies.

Title: System-independent lower bounds on entropy production incurred by running a computer program
Authors: Abhishek Yadav, Francesco Caravelli, David Wolpert
Abstract: Mismatch cost (MMC) is a universally applicable lower bound on both the entropy production (EP) of any fixed physical process across a given time interval. In this work we use MMC for the first time to lower-bound the amount of work dissipated by running a high-level or assembler-level computer program. To begin, we extend previous results concerning MMC to prove that it scales at least linearly with the total heat flow in the worst case over initial distributions. This establishes that - in contrast to results like the thermodynamic speed limit theorem or thermodynamic uncertainty relations - it is often a substantial fraction of the work dissipated on macroscopic scales. We also prove that the MMC lower bound over a given time interval never decreases if the time interval is subdivided into a sequence of sub-intervals, and that the bound often increases. Armed with these results, we then introduce a general framework for computing the minimal EP (i.e., the MMC) associated with running any computer program on any physical system that implements a modern digital computer. Crucially, this framework holds completely independently of the microscopic physical details of that system. Next we apply this general framework to compare lower bounds on the EP incurred by running two canonical sorting algorithms, bubble sort and Bucket sort. This enables us to investigate how thermodynamic cost depends on features like input size and structure (e.g., with or without repeated entries). Finally, we extend the framework to programs that call subroutines.

Title: A minimal tensor network beyond free fermions
Authors: Carolin Wille, Maksimilian Usoltcev, Jens Eisert, Alexander Altland
Abstract: This work proposes a minimal model extending the duality between classical statistical spin systems and fermionic systems beyond the case of free fermions. A Jordan-Wigner transformation applied to a two-dimensional tensor network maps the partition sum of a classical statistical mechanics model to a Grassmann variable integral, structurally similar to the path integral for interacting fermions in two dimensions. The resulting model is simple, featuring only two parameters: one governing spin-spin interaction (dual to effective hopping strength in the fermionic picture), the other measuring the deviation from the free fermion limit. Nevertheless, it exhibits a rich phase diagram, partially stabilized by elements of topology, and featuring three phases meeting at a tricritical point. Besides the interpretation as a spin and fermionic system, the model is closely related to loop gas and vertex models and can be interpreted as a parity-preserving (non-unitary) circuit. Its minimal construction makes it an ideal reference system for studying non-linearities in tensor networks and deriving results by means of duality.

Title: Hamiltonian-learning quantum magnets with non-local impurity tomography
Authors: Greta Lupi, Jose L. Lado
Abstract: Impurities in quantum materials have provided successful strategies for learning properties of complex states, ranging from unconventional superconductors to topological insulators. In quantum magnetism, inferring the Hamiltonian of an engineered system becomes a challenging open problem in the presence of complex interactions. Here we show how a supervised machine-learning technique can be used to infer Hamiltonian parameters from atomically engineered quantum magnets by inferring fluctuations of the ground states due to the presence of impurities. We demonstrate our methodology both with a fermionic model with spin-orbit coupling, as well as with many-body spin models with long-range exchange and anisotropic exchange interactions. We show that our approach enables performing Hamiltonian extraction in the presence of significant noise, providing a strategy to perform Hamiltonian learning with experimental observables in atomic-scale quantum magnets. Our results establish a strategy to perform Hamiltonian learning by exploiting the impact of impurities in complex quantum many-body states.

Title: Segregation, ordering, and precipitation in WTaV-based concentrated refractory alloys
Authors: Jesper Byggmästar, Damian Sobieraj, Jan S. Wróbel, Daniel K. Schreiber, Osman El-Atwani, Enrique Martinez, Duc Nguyen-Manh
Abstract: Tungsten-based low-activation high-entropy alloys are possible candidates for next-generation fusion reactors due to their exceptional tolerance to irradiation, thermal loads, and stress. We develop an accurate and efficient machine-learned interatomic potential for the W-Ta-Cr-V system and use it in hybrid Monte Carlo molecular dynamics simulations of ordering and segregation to all common types of defects in WTaCrV. The predictions are compared to atom probe tomography analysis of segregation and precipitation in WTaCrV thin films. By also considering two other alloys, WTaV and MoNbTaVW, we are able to draw general conclusions about preferred segregation in refractory alloys and the reasons behind it, guiding future alloy design and elucidating experimental observations. We show that the experimentally observed CrV precipitates in WTaCrV form semicoherent bcc-to-bcc interfaces with the surrounding matrix, as coherent precipitates are not thermodynamically stable due to excessive lattice mismatch. The predictions from simulations align well with our atom probe tomography analysis as well as previous experimental observations.

Title: Anomalous currents and spontaneous vortices in spin-orbit coupled superconductors
Authors: Benjamin A. Levitan, Yuval Oreg, Erez Berg
Abstract: We propose a mechanism which can generate supercurrents in spin-orbit coupled superconductors with charged magnetic inclusions. The basic idea is that through spin-orbit interaction, the in-plane electric field near the edge of each inclusion appears to the electrons as an effective spin-dependent gauge field; if Cooper pairs can be partially spin polarized, then each pair experiences a nonzero net transverse pseudo-gauge field. We explore the phenomenology of our mechanism within a Ginzburg-Landau theory, with parameters determined from a microscopic model. Depending on parameters, our mechanism can either enhance or reduce the total magnetization upon superconducting condensation. Given an appropriate distribution of inclusions, we show how our mechanism can generate superconducting vortices without any applied orbital magnetic field. Our mechanism can produce similar qualitative behavior to the ``magnetic memory effect'' observed in 4Hb-TaS$_2$. However, the magnitude of the effect in that material seems larger than our model can naturally explain.

Title: Thermopower across Fermi-volume-changing quantum phase transitions without translational symmetry breaking
Authors: Peter Lunts, Aavishkar A. Patel, Subir Sachdev
Abstract: We describe the evolution of low-temperature thermopower across Fermi-volume-changing quantum phase transitions in Kondo lattice models without translational symmetry breaking. This transition moves from a heavy Fermi liquid with a conventional Luttinger-volume large Fermi surface to a 'FL*' state, characterized by a small Fermi surface and a spin liquid with fractionalized excitations. The onset of the large Fermi surface phase is driven by the condensation of a Higgs field that carries a unit gauge charge under an emergent U(1) gauge field. We consider the case with spatially random Kondo exchange, as this leads to strange metal behavior in electrical transport. We find a large asymmetric thermopower in a 'skewed' marginal Fermi liquid, with similarities to the skewed non-Fermi liquid of Georges and Mravlje (arXiv:2102.13224). Our findings are consistent with recent observations in heavy fermion compounds (Z.-Y. Cao et al., arXiv:2408.13604), and describe an enhancement of thermopower on the large Fermi surface side as well as a non-monotonic behavior on the small Fermi surface side. Our results also apply to single-band Hubbard models and the pseudogap transition in the cuprates. In the ancilla framework, single-band models exhibit an inverted Kondo lattice transition: the small Fermi surface pseudogap state corresponds to the condensed Higgs state. This inversion results in an enhancement of thermopower on the pseudogap side in our theory, consistent with observations in the cuprates (C. Collignon et al., arXiv:2011.14927; A. Gourgout et al., arXiv:2106.05959). We argue that these observations support a non-symmetry-breaking Fermi-volume-changing transition as the underlying description of the onset of the pseudogap in the cuprates.

Title: Observation of Orbital-Selective Dual Modulations in an Anisotropic Antiferromagnetic Kagome Metal TbTi3Bi4
Authors: Renjie Zhang, Bocheng Yu, Hengxin Tan, Yiwei Cheng, Feiran Shen, Junye Yang, Dan Mu, Xinru Han, Alfred Zong, Quanxin Hu, Xuezhi Chen, Yudong Hu, Chengnuo Meng, Junchao Ren, Junqin Li, Zhenhua Chen, Zhengtai Liu, Mao Ye, Makoto Hashimoto, Donghui Lu, Shifeng Jin, Binghai Yan, Lunhua He, Ziqiang Wang, Tian Shang, Yaobo Huang, Baiqing Lv, Hong Ding
Abstract: Orbital selectivity is pivotal in dictating the phase diagrams of multiorbital systems, with prominent examples including the orbital-selective Mott phase and superconductivity, etc. The intercalation of anisotropic layers represents an effective method for enhancing orbital selectivity and, thereby shaping the low-energy physics of multiorbital systems. Despite its potential, related experimental studies remain limited. In this work, we systematically examine the interplay between orbital selectivity and magnetism in the newly discovered anisotropic kagome TbTi3Bi4 single crystal, and report a unidirectional, orbital-selective band reconstruction within the antiferromagnetic (AFM) state. By combining soft X-ray and vacuum ultraviolet angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements with orbital-resolved density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we identify that the band reconstruction is a manifestation of the AFM order, driven by a 1/3 nesting instability of the intercalated Tb 5dxz orbitals. Such an orbital-selective modulation leads the unusual momentum-dependent band folding and the emergence of symmetry-protected Dirac cones only at the M1 point. More importantly, the discovery of orbital-selective 3 x 1 AFM order offers crucial insights into the underlying mechanism of the fractional magnetization plateau in this Kagome AFM metal. Our findings not only underscore the essential role of both conducting and localized electrons in determining the magnetic orders of LnTi3Bi4 (Ln = Lanthanide) kagome metals but also offer a pathway for manipulating magnetism through selective control of anisotropic electronic structures.

Title: Multipolar ferroelectricity in the Mott regime
Authors: Pengwei Zhao, Jiahao Yang, Gang v. Chen
Abstract: Ferroelectricity has been one major focus in modern fundamental research and technological application. We consider the physical origin of improper ferroelectricity in Mott insulating materials. Beyond the well-known Katsura-Nagaosa-Balatsky's inverse Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya mechanism for the noncollinearly ordered magnets, we point out the induction of the electric polarizations in the multipolar ordered Mott insulators. Using the multiflavor representation for the multipolar magnetic moments, we can show the crossover or transition from the pure inverse Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya mechanism to the pure multipolar origin for the ferroelectricity, and also incorporate the intermediate regime with the mixture of both origins. We expect our results to inspire a reexamination of ferroelectricity in the multipolar-ordered magnets.

Title: Geometric Brownian information engine with finite cycle time: Optimisation of output work, power and efficiency
Authors: Syed Yunus Ali, Rafna Rafeek, Debasish Mondal
Abstract: We consider a Geometric Brownian Information Engine to explore the effects of finite cycle time $(\tau)$ on the extractable work, power, and efficiency. We incorporate an error-free feedback controller that converts the information obtained about the state of overdamped Brownian particles, confined within a 2-D monolobal geometry, into extractable work. The performance of the information engine depends on the cycle period $(\tau)$, measurement distance $(x_m)$, and feedback location $(x_f)$ of the controller. Upon increasing the feedback cycle time, the engine transitions from a high non-equilibrium steady state to a completely relaxed state. We set the measurement distance at an optimum position related to a fully relaxed state ($x_m^* \sim 0.6 \sigma$). When the cycle time is finite and short ($\tau <\tau_r$), the best information processing occurs with a shorter distance of the feedback site. While increasing the cycle time towards a fully relaxed state ($\tau \gg \tau_r$), the maximum extractable work that can be achieved with a feedback location is set to be twice that of $x_m^*$, as expected. When the cycle time ($\tau$) is longer than the relaxation time ($\tau_r$), the maximum power is achieved when the scaled feedback location is exactly double the optimum measurement distance ($x_f^{*}=2x_m^*$). In contrast, when $\tau < \tau_r$, the maximum power is achieved when the feedback site is set at a lower value. As the $\tau$ increases, the maximum average power decreases. In the limit of a long $\tau$, the highest efficiency as well extractable work is attained when $x_f$ is located at $2x_m$, regardless of the level of entropic control. As the dominance of entropic control increases, the extractable work and efficiency in the fully relaxed state decrease due to higher information loss during relaxation.

Title: Colour symmetry and altermagnetic-like spin textures in noncollinear antiferromagnets
Authors: Paolo G. Radaelli, Gautam Gurung
Abstract: We present a formalism based on colour symmetry to analyse the momentum-space spin textures of non-collinear antiferromagnets. We show that, out of the spin textures allowed by the magnetic point group, \textcolor{\altcolor} {one can extract a component that is invariant by general rotations in spin space, and can exist in the absence of spin-orbit coupling, in complete analogy to spin textures in altermagnets}. We demonstrate this approach in the case of three complex, non-collinear magnets, Mn$_3$Ir(Ge,Si), Pb$_2$MnO$_4$ and Mn$_3$GaN. For Mn$_3$GaN, we also show that the predictions of colour-symmetry analysis are consistent with density functional theory calculations performed on the same system both with and without spin-orbit coupling.

Title: Theoretical determination of Gilbert damping in reduced dimensions
Authors: Balázs Nagyfalusi, László Szunyogh, Krisztián Palotás
Abstract: An ab initio scheme based on the Kubo-Greenwood linear response theory of exchange torque correlation is presented to calculate intrinsic Gilbert damping parameters in magnets of reduced dimensions. The method implemented into the real-space Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker (RS-KKR) Greens' function framework enables to obtain diagonal elements of the atomic-site-dependent on-site and non-local Gilbert damping tensor. Going from the 3D bulk and surfaces of iron and cobalt ferromagnets addressed in our previous work [Phys. Rev. B 109, 094417 (2024)], in the present paper monolayers of Fe and Co on (001)- and (111)-oriented Cu, Ag, and Au substrates are studied, and particularly the substrate-dependent trends are compared. Furthermore, the Gilbert damping parameters are calculated for Fe and Co adatoms and dimers on (001)-oriented substrates. It is investigated how the damping parameter of single adatoms depends on their vertical position. This dependence is quantified in relation to the adatoms' density of states at the Fermi energy showing a non-monotonic behavior. By rotating the spin moment of the adatoms and collinear magnetic dimers, an anisotropic behavior of the damping is revealed. Finally, a significant, three- to ten-times increase of the on-site Gilbert damping is found in antiferromagnetic dimers in comparison to the ferromagnetic ones, whilst the inter-site damping is even more enhanced.

Title: Tailoring Synthetic Gauge Fields in Ultracold Atoms via Spatially Engineered Vector Beams
Authors: Huan Wang, Shangguo Zhu, Yun Long, Mingbo Pu, Xiangang Luo
Abstract: Ultracold atoms, typically manipulated by scalar beams with uniform polarization, have propelled advances in quantum simulation, computation, and metrology. Yet, vector beams (VBs) -- structured light with spatially varying polarization -- remain unexplored in this context, despite their enhanced tunability and broad optical applications. Here, we demonstrate a novel scheme to generate synthetic gauge fields in ultracold atoms via VB-mediated coupling of internal states. This approach enables angular stripe phases across an expanded parameter range, achieving a three-order-of-magnitude enhancement in the phase diagram and facilitating experimental observation. We further present an all-optical method to create topologically nontrivial giant skyrmions in spin space, with tunable topology governed by VB parameters. Our findings establish VBs as powerful tools for quantum control and the exploration of exotic quantum states and phases.

Title: Anomalous enhancement of large-momentum scattering by electron-electron interaction in moiré superlattices
Authors: Taiki Sato, Hiroaki Ishizuka
Abstract: Using a microscopic model, we show that the electron-electron interaction of flat bands deviates significantly from the Coulomb interaction. In particular, we find that large-momentum scattering is enhanced at $\theta\lesssim4^\circ$, with a non-monotonic momentum dependence appearing near the magic angle. For $\theta \gtrsim 1.2^\circ$, the enhanced large-momentum scattering can be attributed to the compact Wannier function. On the other hand, for $\theta\lesssim1.2^\circ$, the nonmonotonic momentum dependence of the interaction matrix cannot be explained by a simple Wannier orbital, indicating a nontrivial modification to the el-el interaction. Notably, the range of angles $\theta$ where the large-momentum scattering is enhanced differs from the magic angles at which nearly-flat bands emerge, suggesting that the angle dependence of material properties provides information about the effect of interaction. The results highlight unusual features of the interaction in moiré graphene.

Title: Evidence for strongly correlated superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ from first principles
Authors: Daan Verraes, Tom Braeckevelt, Nick Bultinck, Veronique Van Speybroeck
Abstract: We conduct first-principles simulations of pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, a material in which a recent series of experiments has found signs of high-temperature superconductivity. In the pressure range where superconductivity is observed, we find a significant increase in the Hubbard U parameter (i.e. the strength of on-site repulsion) for the maximally localized Wannier states comprising the density functional theory (DFT) bands crossing the Fermi energy. We attribute this increase in U to reduced screening by the nearby La 5d bands - an effect that is sensitive to the pressure-driven crystal structure. Our results therefore indicate that the superconducting region in the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ phase diagram coincides with a region of enhanced electronic correlations. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations extend these trends to finite temperatures, providing insights into the experimentally observed transition lines. Finally, we explore intrinsic chemical pressure using DFT simulations of Ac$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.

Title: Bayesian Selection for Efficient MLIP Dataset Selection
Authors: Thomas Rocke, James Kermode
Abstract: The problem of constructing a dataset for MLIP development which gives the maximum quality in the minimum amount of compute time is complex, and can be approached in a number of ways. We introduce a ``Bayesian selection" approach for selecting from a candidate set of structures, and compare the effectiveness of this method against other common approaches in the task of constructing ideal datasets targeting Silicon surface energies. We show that the Bayesian selection method performs much better than Simple Random Sampling at this task (for example, the error on the (100) surface energy is 4.3x lower in the low data regime), and is competitive with a variety of existing selection methods, using ACE and MACE features.

Title: Topological Phases in Fractals: Local Spin Chern Marker in the Sierpinski carpet Kane-Mele-Rashba Model
Authors: L. L. Lage, A. B. Félix, S. dos A. Sousa-Júnior, A. Latgé, Tarik P. Cysne
Abstract: We study the spectral properties and local topology of the Kane-Mele-Rashba model on a Sierpinski Carpet (SC) fractal, constructed from a rectangular flake with an underlying honeycomb arrangement and open boundary conditions. When the system parameters correspond to a topologically trivial phase, the energy spectrum is characterized solely by bulk states that are not significantly modified by the system's fractality. For parameters corresponding to the quantum spin Hall insulator (QSHI) phase, in addition to bulk states, the energy spectrum exhibits in-gap topological states that are strongly influenced by the fractal geometry. As the fractal generation increases, the in-gap topological states acquire a staircase profile, which translates into sharp peaks in the density of states. We also show that both the QSHI and the trivial phase exhibit a large gap in the valence-projected spin spectrum, allowing the use of the local spin Chern marker (LSCM) to index the local topology of the system. Fractality does not affect this gap, allowing the application of LSCM to higher fractal generations. Our results explore the LSCM versatility, showing its potential to access local topology in complex geometries such as fractal systems.

Title: Magneto-rotation coupling for ferromagnetic nanoelement embedded in elastic substrate
Authors: Grzegorz Centała, Jarosław W. Kłos
Abstract: This study investigates magneto-rotational coupling as a distinct contribution to magnetoelastic interactions, which can be influenced by magnetic anisotropy. We determine magneto-rotational coupling coefficients that incorporate the shape anisotropy of a magnetic nanoelement (strip) and demonstrate that this type of coupling can be modified through geometric adjustments. Furthermore, we analyze the magneto-rotational contribution to the magnetoelastic field in a ferromagnetic strip embedded in a nonmagnetic substrate. Both Rayleigh and Love waves are considered sources of the magnetoelastic field, and we examine how the strength of the magneto-rotational coupling varies with the direction of the magnetization, and the aspect ratio of the strip cross-section. We analyze the changes of the magneto-rotational contribution to the magnetoelastic field with an increasing thickness-to-width ratio, assuming a fixed magnetization direction corresponding to the strongest magnetoelastic coupling. For Love wave, the contribution of the out-of-plane component increases monotonically, while that of the in-plane component decreases monotonically. In the case of the Rayleigh wave, only the out-of-plane component contributes, and it approaches zero as the cross-section becomes square. These findings enhance the understanding of magneto-rotational coupling in magnonic nanostructures.

Title: The cost of resetting discrete-time random walks
Authors: John C. Sunil, Richard A. Blythe, Martin R. Evans, Satya N. Majumdar
Abstract: We consider a discrete-time continuous-space random walk, with a symmetric jump distribution, under stochastic resetting. Associated with the random walker are cost functions for jumps and resets, and we calculate the distribution of the total cost for the random walker up to the first passage to the target. By using the backward master equation approach we demonstrate that the distribution of the total cost up to the first passage to the target can be reduced to a Wiener-Hopf integral equation. The resulting integral equation can be exactly solved (in Laplace space) for arbitrary cost functions for the jump and selected functions for the reset cost. We show that the large cost behaviour is dominated by resetting or the jump distribution according to the choice of the jump distribution. In the important case of a Laplace jump distribution, which corresponds to run-and-tumble particle dynamics, and linear costs for jumps and resetting, the Wiener-Hopf equation simplifies to a differential equation which can easily be solved.

Title: Self-consistent tensor network method for correlated super-moiré matter beyond one billion sites
Authors: Yitao Sun, Marcel Niedermeier, Tiago V. C. Antão, Adolfo O. Fumega, Jose L. Lado
Abstract: Moiré and super-moiré materials provide exceptional platforms to engineer exotic correlated quantum matter. The vast number of sites required to model moiré systems in real space remains a formidable challenge due to the immense computational resources required. Super-moiré materials push this requirement to the limit, where millions or even billions of sites need to be considered, a requirement beyond the capabilities of conventional methods for interacting systems. Here, we establish a methodology that allows solving correlated states in systems reaching a billion sites, that exploits tensor-network representations of real-space Hamiltonians and self-consistent real-space mean-field equations. Our method combines a tensor-network kernel polynomial method with quantics tensor cross interpolation algorithm, enabling us to solve exponentially large models, including those whose single particle Hamiltonian is too large to be stored explicitly. We demonstrate our methodology with super-moiré systems featuring spatially modulated hoppings, many-body interactions and domain walls, showing that it allows access to self-consistent symmetry broken states and spectral functions of real-space models reaching a billion sites. Our methodology provides a strategy to solve exceptionally large interacting problems, providing a widely applicable strategy to compute correlated super-moiré quantum matter.

Title: Collective modes in superconductors including Coulomb repulsion
Authors: Joshua Althüser, Götz S. Uhrig
Abstract: We numerically study the collective excitations present in isotropic superconductors including a screened Coulomb interaction. By varying the screening strength, we analyze its impact on the system. We use a formulation of the effective phonon-mediated interaction between electrons that depends on the energy transfer between particles, rather than being a constant in a small energy shell around the Fermi edge. This justifies considering also rather large attractive interactions. We compute the system's Green's functions using the iterated equations of motion (iEoM) approach, which ultimately enables a quantitative analysis of collective excitations. For weak couplings, we identify the well-known amplitude (Higgs) mode at the two-particle continuum's lower edge and the phase (Anderson-Bogoliubov) mode at $\omega = 0$ for a neutral system, which shifts to higher energies as the Coulomb interaction is switched on. As the phononic coupling is increased, the Higgs mode separates from the continuum, and additional phase and amplitude modes appear, persisting even in the presence Coulomb interactions.

Title: Oscillate and Renormalize: Fast Phonons Reshape the Kondo Effect in Flat Band Systems
Authors: Liam L.H. Lau, Andreas Gleis, Daniel Kaplan, Premala Chandra, Piers Coleman
Abstract: We examine the interplay between electron correlations and phonons in an Anderson-Holstein impurity model with an Einstein phonon. When the phonons are slow compared to charge fluctuations (frequency $\omega_0 \ll U/2$, the onsite Coulomb scale $U/2$), we demonstrate analytically that the expected phonon-mediated reduction of interactions is completely suppressed, even in the strong coupling regime. This suppression arises from the oscillator's inability to respond to rapid charge fluctuations, manifested as a compensation effect between the polaronic cloud and the excited-state phonons associated with valence fluctuations. We identify a novel frozen mixed valence phase, above a threshold dimensionless electron-phonon coupling $\alpha^*$ when the phonons are slow, where the static phonon cloud locks the impurity into specific valence configurations, potentially explaining the puzzling coexistence of mixed valence behavior and insulating properties in materials like rust. Conversely, when the phonon is fast ($\omega_0 \gtrsim U/2$), the system exhibits conventional polaronic behavior with renormalized onsite interactions effectively $U_{\text{eff}}$ due to phonon mediated attraction, with additional satellite features in the local spectral function due to phonon excitations. Using numerical renormalization group (NRG) calculations, a fully dynamic renormalization technique, we confirm these behaviors in both regimes. These findings have important implications for strongly correlated systems where phonon energy scales may be comparable to the Coulomb scale, such as in twisted bilayer graphene, necessitating careful consideration of interaction renormalizations in theoretical models.

Title: Elasticity of a Freely Jointed Chain with Quenched Disorder
Authors: Minsu Yi, Panayotis Benetatos
Abstract: We introduce a simple theoretical model, the Freely Jointed Chain with quenched hinges (qFJC), which captures the quenched disorder in the local bending stiffness of the polymer. In this article, we analyze the tensile elasticity of the qFJC in the Gibbs (fixed-force) ensemble. For finite-size systems, we obtain a recurrence relation of the exact free energy, which allows us to calculate the exact force-extension relation numerically for an arbitrary size of the system. In the thermodynamic limit, when $L({\rm contour \;length})\gg L_p({\rm persistence \;length})$, we obtain a framework to deal with quenched disorder in the polymer configuration. This allows us to obtain the response function for the discrete and continuous qFJC in the thermodynamic limit. It turns out that the extension of the continuous qFJC can be cast in a simple form. Furthermore, we have applied our analysis to rod-coil multiblock copolymers.

Title: Image of helical local moment magnetic order in the STM spectrum
Authors: Alireza Akbari, Peter Thalmeier
Abstract: The surface tunneling microscope (STM) method probes the itinerant conduction electron spectrum which is influenced by the presence of collective order parameters. It may in fact be used as a tool to obtain important information about their microscopic nature, for example the gap symmetry in unconventional superconductors. Surprisingly it has been found that the STM spectrum can also identify magnetic order of completely localised electrons, e.g., incommensurate helical structure of 4f electron moments, as observed in the compound GdRu$_2$Si$_2$. This is due to the fact that the exchange coupling of conduction states to the localised subsystem reconstructs the itinerant bands which then leaves an imprint on the STM spectrum. We develop a theory based on this idea that shows firstly the appearance of STM satellite peaks at the wave vector of localised moment helical order for the pure surface. Secondly we derive the quasiparticle interference spectrum in Born approximation due to the presence of surface impurities which contains information on the reconstruction process of itinerant states caused by the localised helical order. Furthermore we show that within full $t$-matrix approach impurity bound states are also influenced by the exchange coupling to helical magnetic order.

Title: A non-Lorentzian model for strong exciton-plasmon coupling
Authors: Tigran V. Shahbazyan
Abstract: We develop a non-Lorentzian analytical model for quantum emitters (QE) resonantly coupled to localized surface plasmons (LSP) in metal-dielectric structures. Using the explicit form of LSP Green function, we derive non-Lorentzian version of semiclassical Maxwell-Bloch equations that describe LSPs directly in terms of metal complex dielectric function rather than via Lorentzian resonances. For a single QE resonantly coupled to an LSP, we obtain an analytical expression for effective optical polarizability of the hybrid system which, in the Lorentzian approximation, recovers the results of the classical coupled oscillators model. We demonstrate that non-Lorentzian effects originating from temporal dispersion of the metal dielectric function affect significantly the optical spectra as the hybrid system transitions to the strong coupling regime. Specifically, in contrast to results of Lorentzian models, the main spectral weight in the system scattering spectra is shifted toward the lower energy polaritonic band, consistent with the experiment.

Title: Computing ternary liquid phase diagrams: Fe-Cu-Ni
Authors: Dallas R. Trinkle (Materials Science and Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign)
Abstract: We compute the phase separation of the immiscible liquid alloy Fe-Cu-Ni. Our computational approach uses a virtual semigrand canonical Widom approach to determine differences in excess chemical potentials between different species. Using an embedded atom potential for Fe-Cu-Ni, we simulate liquid states over a range of compositions and temperatures. This raw data is then fit to Redlich-Kister polynomials for the Gibbs free energy with a simple temperature dependence. Using the analytic form, we can determine the phase diagram for the ternary liquid, compute the miscibility gap and spinodal decomposition as a function of temperature for this EAM potential. In addition, we compute density as a function of composition and temperature, and predict pair correlation functions. We use static structure factors to estimate the second derivative of the Gibbs free energy (the $S^0$ method) and compare with our fit Gibbs free energy. Finally, using a nonequilibrium Hamiltonian integration method, we separately compute absolute Gibbs free energies for the pure liquid states; this shows that our endpoints are accurate to within 1 meV for our ternary Gibbs free energy, as well as the absolute Gibbs free energy for the ternary liquid.

Title: Homes' Law and Universal Planckian Relaxation
Authors: A. Shekhter, M. K. Chan R. D. McDonald, N. Harrison
Abstract: According to Zaanen's interpretation of Homes' empirical law~[Zaanen, {\it Nature} {\bf 430}, 512 (2004)], the superconducting transition temperatures in the cuprates are high because their metallic states are as viscous as quantum mechanics permits. Here, we show that Homes' law in fact implies three key points: (i) the resistivity is linear in temperature in the normal state near the transition temperature; (ii) the dimensionless coefficient of proportionality of the relaxation rate with temperature is of order unity -- the so-called universal Planckian relaxation rate; and (iii) the logarithmically broad applicability of this law arises from an unusually wide range of effective masses throughout the cuprate phase diagram. In fact, a universal Planckian relaxation rate implies Homes' law only if the mechanism of mass renormalization is independent of the Planckian relaxation.

Title: Energy-resolved tip-orbital fingerprint in scanning tunneling spectroscopy based on the revised Chen's derivative rule
Authors: Ivan Abilio, Krisztián Palotás
Abstract: The revised Chen's derivative rule for electron tunneling is implemented to enable computationally efficient first-principles-based calculations of the differential conductance dI/dV for scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) simulations. The probing tip is included through a single tip apex atom, and its electronic structure can be modeled as a linear combination of electron orbitals of various symmetries, or can be directly transferred from first-principles electronic structure calculations. By taking pristine and boron- or nitrogen-doped graphene sheets as sample surfaces, the reliability of our implementation is demonstrated by comparing its results to those obtained by the Tersoff-Hamann and Bardeen's electron tunneling models. It is highlighted that the energy-resolved direct and interference contributions to dI/dV arising from the tip's electron orbitals result in a fingerprint of the particular combined surface-tip system. The significant difference between the electron acceptor boron and donor nitrogen dopants in graphene is reflected in their dI/dV fingerprints. The presented theoretical method allows for an unprecedented physical understanding of the electron tunneling process in terms of tip-orbital-resolved energy-dependent dI/dV maps, that is anticipated to be extremely useful for investigating the local electronic properties of novel material surfaces in the future.

Title: Nonlinear spin dynamics across Néel phase transition in ferromagnetic/antiferromagnetic multilayers
Authors: O. Busel, D. Polishchuk, A. Kravets, V. Korenivski
Abstract: We observe strongly nonlinear spin dynamics in ferro-/antiferro-magnetic multilayers, controlled by the number of bilayers in the system, layer thicknesses, as well as temperature, peaking in magnitude near the Néel point of the antiferromagnetic layers just above room temperature. Well above the Néel transition, the individual ferromagnetic layers are exchange decoupled and resonate independently. As the temperature is lowered toward the Néel point, the ferromagnetic proximity effect through the thin antiferromagnetic spacers transforms the system into a weakly coupled macrospin chain along the film normal, which exhibits pronounced standing spin-wave resonance modes, comparable in intensity to the uniform resonance in the ferromagnetic layers. These findings are supported by our micromagnetic simulations showing clear spin-wave profiles with precessional phase lag along the macrospin chain. Well below the Néel transition, the FeMn layers order strongly antiferromagnetically and exchange-pin the ferromagnetic layers to effectively make the multilayer one macrospin. The appearance and intensity of the high-frequency spin-wave modes can thus be conveniently controlled by thermal gating the multilayer. The nonlinearity in the microwave response of the demonstrated material can approach 100\%, large compared to nonlinear materials used in e.g. optics, with second-harmonic generation often at the single percentage level.

Title: Crossover in Electronic Specific Heat near Narrow-Sense Type-III Dirac Cones
Authors: Keita Kishigi, Yasumasa Hasegawa
Abstract: Two-dimensional massless Dirac fermions exhibit Dirac cones, which are classified into three types: type-I, type-II, and type-III. In both type-I and type-II cones, the energy dispersion is linear in all momentum directions. Type-I cones are characterized by a non-overtilted structure, where the Dirac point serves as a local minimum (maximum) for the upper (lower) band. In contrast, type-II cones exhibit overtilted dispersions, leading to the coexistence of electron and hole pockets. At the critical tilt, the linear energy dispersion vanishes in one momentum direction, corresponding to a type-III Dirac cone. We further define a special case, termed the "narrow-sense" type-III cone, where not only the linear term but also quadratic and higher-order terms vanish, resulting in a completely flat dispersion along one direction. In this work, we numerically investigate the temperature ($T$) -dependence of the electronic specific heat ($C$), as the Dirac cone is continuously tilted from type-I to narrow-sense type-III. A model with particle-hole symmetry is employed to ensure that the chemical potential ($\mu$) remains temperature independent. Our results reveal a notable crossover in $C$ near narrow-sense type-III, where $C$ changes from $C \propto T^{2}$ below the crossover temperature ($T_{\rm co}$) to $C \propto T^{\frac{1}{2}}$ above $T_{\rm co}$. This crossover is attributed to the energy-dependent structure of the density of states. The present findings suggest a feasible approach for experimentally probing the degree of Dirac cone tilting near the narrow-sense type-III limit.

Title: Superfluid Weight of Strongly Inhomogeneous Superconductors
Authors: Jonathan Schirmer, Enrico Rossi
Abstract: In this work, we obtain the expression, within the linear response approximation, that allows the direct calculation of the superfluid weight for strongly inhomogeneous superconductors. Using this expression, we find that, in general, the correction to the superfluid weight due to the response of the superconductor's pairing potential to the perturbing vector potential is important in superconductors with a strongly inhomogeneous pairing potential. We consider two exemplary cases: the case when strong inhomogeneities in the pairing potential are induced by a periodic potential, and the case when superconducting vortices are induced by an external magnetic field. For both cases we show that the correction to the superfluid weight due to the response of the paring potential to the perturbing vector potential can be significant, it must be included to obtain quantitatively correct results, and that for the case when vortices are present the expression of the superfluid weight that does not include such correction returns qualitatively wrong results.

Title: Upper bound on $T_c$ in a strongly coupled electron-boson superconductor
Authors: Nikolay V. Gnezdilov, Rufus Boyack
Abstract: Migdal-Eliashberg theory (METh) of boson-mediated superconductivity contains a $\sqrt{\lambda}$ divergence in the critical temperature $T_c$ at strong electron-boson coupling $\lambda$. In conventional METh, the strong-coupling regime can be accessed only in the limit that $\lambda_E = \lambda \, \omega_D/\varepsilon_F\ll1$, where $\omega_D$ is the Debye frequency and $\varepsilon_F$ is the Fermi energy. Here we go beyond this restriction in the context of the two-dimensional Yukawa-SYK (Y-SYK) model, which is solvable for arbitrary values of $\lambda_E$. We find that $T_c\approx 0.18 \,\omega_D \sqrt{\lambda}$ for large $\lambda$, provided $\lambda_E$ remains small, and crosses over to a universal value of $T_c \approx 0.04\, \varepsilon_F$ for large $\lambda_E$. The saturation of $T_c$ is due to a self-consistent account of the boson dynamics for large $\lambda_E$ and is arguably qualitatively valid beyond the Y-SYK framework. In particular, depending on the value of $\lambda$, this self-consistent approach leads to pairing that describes multiple classes of quantum critical electronic systems. These results demonstrate how the $\sqrt{\lambda}$ growth of $T_c$ in METh saturates to a universal value independent of $\lambda$ and $\omega_D$, providing an upper bound on the critical temperature at strong electron-boson coupling.

Title: Quantum critical scaling of altermagnetism
Authors: Sondre Duna Lundemo, Flavio S. Nogueira, Asle Sudbø
Abstract: The term altermagnetism has recently been introduced to describe the Néel order of a class of materials whose magnetic sublattices are neither related by translation nor inversion. While these materials arguably have large technological potential, little effort has been devoted to studying the universal distinction of this phase of matter compared to collinear antiferromagnetism. Employing a recently proposed minimal microscopic model, we explicitly derive a nonlinear sigma model describing long-wavelength fluctuations of the staggered magnetization in this system, including quantum effects to leading order. The term that distinguishes the altermagnetic nonlinear sigma model from its antiferromagnetic counterpart is an interaction term that derives directly from the Berry phase of the microscopic spin degrees of freedom. Its effects on the one-loop renormalization group flow in $d=2+1$ dimensions are examined. Extending the theory to describe the fermionic excitations of the metallic altermagnet, we find an effective low-energy model of $d$-wave spin-split Dirac fermions interacting with the magnetic fluctuations. Using a Dyson-Schwinger approach, we derive the many-body effects on the dynamical critical scaling due to the competition between the long-range Coulomb interaction and the fluctuations of the staggered magnetization.

Lindenberg, Long-Qing Chen, John W. Freeland, Jirka Hlinka, Venkatraman Gopalan, Haidan Wen
Abstract: Unraveling collective modes arising from coupled degrees of freedom is crucial for understanding complex interactions in solids and developing new functionalities. Unique collective behaviors emerge when two degrees of freedom, ordered on distinct length scales, interact. Polar skyrmions, three-dimensional electric polarization textures in ferroelectric superlattices, disrupt the lattice continuity at the nanometer scale with nontrivial topology, leading to previously unexplored collective modes. Here, using terahertz-field excitation and femtosecond x-ray diffraction, we discovered subterahertz collective modes, dubbed 'skyrons', which appear as swirling patterns of atomic displacements functioning as atomic-scale gearsets. Momentum-resolved time-domain measurements of diffuse scattering revealed an avoided crossing in the dispersion relation of skyrons. We further demonstrated that the amplitude and dispersion of skyrons can be controlled by sample temperature and electric-field bias. Atomistic simulations and dynamical phase-field modeling provided microscopic insights into the three-dimensional crystallographic and polarization dynamics. The discovery of skyrons and their coupling with terahertz fields opens avenues for ultrafast control of topological polar structures.

Title: Observing Bethe strings in an attractive Bose gas far from equilibrium
Authors: Milena Horvath, Alvise Bastianello, Sudipta Dhar, Rebekka Koch, Yanliang Guo, Jean-Sébastien Caux, Manuele Landini, Hanns-Christoph Nägerl
Abstract: Bethe strings are bound states of constituent particles in a variety of interacting many-body one-dimensional (1D) integrable quantum models relevant to magnetism, nanophysics, cold atoms and beyond. As emergent fundamental excitations, they are predicted to collectively reshape observable equilibrium and dynamical properties. Small individual Bethe strings have recently been observed in quantum magnets and superconducting qubits. However, creating states featuring intermixtures of many, including large, strings remains an outstanding experimental challenge. Here, using nearly integrable ultracold Bose gases, we realize such intermixtures of Bethe strings out of equilibrium, by dynamically tuning interactions from repulsive to attractive. We measure the average binding energy of the strings, revealing the presence of bound states of more than six particles. We find further evidence for them in the momentum distribution and in Tan's contact, connected to the correlated density. Our data quantitatively agree with predictions from generalized hydrodynamics (GHD). Manipulating intermixtures of Bethe strings opens new avenues for understanding quantum coherence, nonlinear dynamics and thermalization in strongly-interacting 1D systems.

Title: Achieving accurate entropy and melting point by ab initio molecular dynamics and zentropy theory: Application to fluoride and chloride molten salts
Authors: Shun-Li Shang, Nigel L. E. Hew, Rushi Gong, Cillian Cockrell, Paul A. Bingham, Xiaofeng Guo, Jingjing Li, Qi-Jun Hong, Zi-Kui Liu
Abstract: We have recently developed a breakthrough methodology for rapidly computing entropy in both solids and liquids by integrating a multiscale entropy approach (known as zentropy theory) with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. This approach enables entropy estimation from a single MD trajectory by analyzing the probabilities of local structural configurations and atomic distributions, effectively addressing the long-standing challenge of capturing configurational entropy. Here, we demonstrate the power of this method by predicting entropies, enthalpies, and melting points for 25 binary and ternary chlorite- and fluoride-based molten salts using ab initio MD (AIMD) simulations. The strong agreement between our predictions and experimental data underscores the potential of this approach to transform computational thermodynamics, offering accurate, efficient, and direct predictions of thermodynamic properties across both solid and liquid phases.

Title: Theoretical investigation of interface atomic structure of graphene on NiFe alloy substrate
Authors: Naohiro Matsumoto, Ryusuke Endo, Mitsuharu Uemoto, Tomoya Ono
Abstract: Two processes have been proposed to fabricate graphene/NiFe alloy interfaces for tunneling magnetoresistance devices. One is the transfer of graphene and the other is the evaporation of alloys onto graphene. The formation energy of a NiFe alloy substrate and the adsorption energy of graphene on the NiFe alloy substrate are investigated by a density functional theory calculations to reveal the difference in the atomic structure of the interface between the two processes. It is found that Ni-rich surfaces are preferable for the bare substrate, whereas Fe surfaces are stable for the graphene adsorbed on the substrate. This result indicates that the composition ratio of the surface layer depends on the interface fabrication process.

Title: Multisetting protocol for Bell correlated states detection with spin-$f$ systems
Authors: Arkadiusz Kobus, Xinwei Li, Mariusz Gajda, Li You, Emilia Witkowska
Abstract: We propose a multisetting protocol for the detection of two-body Bell correlations, and apply it to spin-nematic squeezed states realized in $f$ pairs of SU(2) subsystems within spin-$f$ atomic Bose-Einstein condensates. Experimental data for $f=1$, alongside with numerical simulations using the truncated Wigner method for $f=1,\,2,\,3$, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed protocol. Our findings extend the reach of multisetting Bell tests in ultracold atomic system, paving the way for extended quantum information processing in high-spin ensemble platforms.

Title: Decoupling Electric Field and Temperature-Driven Atomistic Forming Mechanisms in TaOx/HfO2-Based ReRAMs using Reactive Molecular Dynamics Simulations
Authors: Simanta Lahkar, Valeria Bragaglia, Behnaz Bagheri, Donato Francesco Falcone, Matteo Galetta, Marilyne Sousa, Aida Todri-Sanial
Abstract: Resistive random access memories (ReRAMs) with a bilayer TaOx/HfO2 stack structure have shown unique multi-level resistive switching capabilities. However, the physical processes governing their behavior, and specifically the atomistic mechanisms of forming, remain poorly understood. In this work, we present a detailed analysis of the forming mechanism at the atomic level using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. An extended charge equilibration scheme, based on a combination of the charge transfer ionic potential (CTIP) formalism and the electrochemical dynamics with implicit degrees of freedom (EChemDID) method, is employed to model the localized effects of applied voltage. Our simulations reveal that tantalum ions exhibit the highest displacement under applied voltage, followed by hafnium ions, while oxygen ions respond only minimally. This results in the formation of a tantalum-depleted, oxygen-rich zone near the positive top electrode (anode), and the clustering of oxygen vacancies near the negative bottom electrode (cathode), where the conductive filament nucleates. This ionic segregation partially shields the bulk dielectric from the applied electric field, hindering further migration of ions in the vertical direction. We find that a minimum threshold voltage is required to initiate vacancy clustering. Filament growth proceeds through a localized mechanism, driven by thermally activated generation of oxygen vacancy defects, which are stabilized near the edge of the nucleated filament at the cathode.

Title: Pilot-waves and copilot-particles: A novel approach to objective collapse
Authors: Axel van de Walle
Abstract: We propose an extension of Schrödinger's equation that incorporates the macroscopic measurement-induced wavefunction collapse phenomenon. Our approach relies on a hybrid between Bohm-de Broglie pilot-wave and objective collapse theories. The Bohmian particle is guided by the wavefunction and, conversely, the wavefunction gradually localizes towards the particle's position. As long as the particle can visit any state, as in a typical microscopic system, the localization effect does not favor any particular quantum state and, on average, the usual Schrödinger-like time evolution results. However, when the wavefunction develops spatially well-separated lobes, as would happen during a macroscopic measurement, the Bohmian particle can remain trapped in one lobe, and the wavefunction eventually localizes there. The end result, in macroscopic systems, is a wavefunction collapse that is consistent with Born's rule. We illustrate the theory with a simple double-slit experiment simulation.

Title: Non-Abelian Gauge Effect for 2-D Non-Hermitian Hatano-Nelson Model in Cylinder Type
Authors: Yiming Zhao, Yazhuang Miao, Yihang Xing, Tianhui Qiu, Hongyang Ma, Xiaolong Zhao
Abstract: Non-Abelian gauge offers a powerful route to engineer novel topological phenomena. Here, we systematically investigate a two-dimensional (2D) non-Hermitian Hatano-Nelson model incorporating SU(2) non-Abelian gauge, demonstrating the emergence of Hopf-link bulk braiding topology in the complex energy spectrum solely with x-direction nearest-neighbor couplings. Because of the limitations of exceptional point (EP) topology in fully capturing the rich non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) under non-Abelian influence, we introduce a novel polarization parameter derived from the generalized Brillouin zone (GBZ). This parameter quantitatively discerns left-, right-, and notably, bipolar skin modes, with its accuracy corroborated by directly encoding real-space eigenstate. Our findings reveal that non-Abelian gauge provides unprecedented influence over NHSE, compared with Abelian gauge and without gauge cases. Furthermore, we uncover unique characteristics of zero-imaginary-energy eigenstates at these topological boundaries, including pronounced degeneracy and bipolar localization which is unaffected by size effects, investigated via dynamical evolution and Inverse Participation Ratio (IPR). This work establishes a new paradigm for synthesizing and manipulating non-Hermitian topological phases driven by non-Abelian structures, opening avenues for topological engineering and holding promise for experimental realization in synthetic dimensional platforms.

Title: Thermal conductivity minimum with thickness in ultrathin films
Authors: Alessio Zaccone
Abstract: The thermal properties of solids under nanoscale confinement are currently not understood at the atomic level. Recent numerical studies have highlighted the presence of a minimum in the thermal conductivity as a function of thickness for ultrathin films at a thickness about 1-2 nm, which cannot be described by existing theories. We develop a theoretical description of thin films which predicts a new physical law for heat transfer at the nanoscale. In particular, due to the strong redistribution of phonon momentum states in reciprocal space (with a transition from a spherical Debye surface to a different homotopy group $\mathbb{Z}$ at strong confinement), the low-energy phonon density of states no longer follows Debye's law but rather a cubic law with frequency, which then crosses over to Debye's law at a crossover frequency proportional to the average speed of sound of the material and inversely proportional to the film thickness. Concomitantly, this implies that the phonon population becomes dominated by low-energy phonons as confinement increases, which then leads to a higher thermal conductivity under extreme confinement. The theory is able to reproduce the thermal conductivity minimum in recent molecular simulations data for ultrathin silicon and provides useful guidelines as to tune the minimum position based on the mechanical properties of the material.

Title: Tailored ordering enables high-capacity cathode materials
Authors: Tzu-chen Liu, Adolfo Salgado-Casanova, So Yubuchi, Bianca Baldassarri, Muratahan Aykol, Jun Yoshida, Hisatsugu Yamasaki, Yizhou Zhu, Steven B. Torrisi, Christopher Wolverton
Abstract: Newly designed Li-ion battery cathode materials with high capacity and greater flexibility in chemical composition will be critical for the growing electric vehicles market. Cathode structures with cation disorder were once considered suboptimal, but recent demonstrations have highlighted their potential in Li$_{1+x}$M$_{1-x}$O$_{2}$ chemistries with a wide range of metal combinations M. By relaxing the strict requirements of maintaining ordered Li diffusion pathways, countless multi-metal compositions in LiMO$_2$ may become viable, aiding the quest for high-capacity cobalt-free cathodes. A challenge presented by this freedom in composition space is designing compositions which possess specific, tailored types of both long- and short-range orderings, which can ensure both phase stability and Li diffusion. However, the combinatorial complexity associated with local cation environments impedes the development of general design guidelines for favorable orderings. Here we propose ordering design frameworks from computational ordering descriptors, which in tandem with low-cost heuristics and elemental statistics can be used to simultaneously achieve compositions that possess favorable phase stability as well as configurations amenable to Li diffusion. Utilizing this computational framework, validated through multiple successful synthesis and characterization experiments, we not only demonstrate the design of LiCr$_{0.75}$Fe$_{0.25}$O$_2$, showcasing initial charge capacity of 234 mAhg$^{-1}$ and 320 mAhg$^{-1}$ in its 20% Li-excess variant Li$_{1.2}$Cr$_{0.6}$Fe$_{0.2}$O$_2$, but also present the elemental ordering statistics for 32 elements, informed by one of the most extensive first-principles studies of ordering tendencies known to us.

Title: Non-degenerate Ground State of the Spin-Boson Model under Abelian Diagonalization
Authors: Tao Liu, Juhao Wu, Mark Ying
Abstract: By utilizing a unitary transformation, we derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for the degeneracy between the even- and odd-parity energy states of the spin-boson model (SBM). Employing the Rayleigh quotient of matrix algebra, we rigorously prove that the ground state energy of the SBM is lower than the systems lowest possible degenerate energy and possesses a definite parity. Based on the necessary and sufficient conditions for parity breaking, we provide an analytical expression for the parity-breaking critical value, which is closely related to the expansion order and computational accuracy. This expression reproduces the SBM phase diagram obtained by quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) and logarithmic discretization numerical renormalization group (NRG) methods. However, this phase diagram does not characterize the ground state of the system.

Title: The maximum-average subtensor problem: equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium properties
Authors: Vittorio Erba, Nathan Malo Kupferschmid, Rodrigo Pérez Ortiz, Lenka Zdeborová
Abstract: In this paper we introduce and study the Maximum-Average Subtensor ($p$-MAS) problem, in which one wants to find a subtensor of size $k$ of a given random tensor of size $N$, both of order $p$, with maximum sum of entries. We are motivated by recent work on the matrix case of the problem in which several equilibrium and non-equilibrium properties have been characterized analytically in the asymptotic regime $1 \ll k \ll N$, and a puzzling phenomenon was observed involving the coexistence of a clustered equilibrium phase and an efficient algorithm which produces submatrices in this phase. Here we extend previous results on equilibrium and algorithmic properties for the matrix case to the tensor case. We show that the tensor case has a similar equilibrium phase diagram as the matrix case, and an overall similar phenomenology for the considered algorithms. Additionally, we consider out-of-equilibrium landscape properties using Overlap Gap Properties and Franz-Parisi analysis, and discuss the implications or lack-thereof for average-case algorithmic hardness.

Title: Solitonic Andreev Spin Qubit
Authors: Pablo San-Jose, Elsa Prada
Abstract: We propose a novel type of superconducting spin qubit, dubbed solitonic Andreev spin qubit (SASQ), that combines features of Andreev spin qubits and geometric spin qubits. The two SASQ states are the degenerate spin orientations of an Andreev bound state trapped in a circular Josephson junction with a Corbino disk geometry, created on a 2DEG. The junction is subjected to a weak magnetic flux that induces a fluxoid mismatch between the inner disk and outer ring superconductors. The fluxoid mismatch produces a cancellation of the induced pairing that traps unconventional spin-degenerate Andreev bound states analogous to Jackiw-Rebbi soliton states. They are localized at a position around the junction that can be controlled by changing the superconducting phase difference. Moving a soliton state with a phase bias induces a holonomic rotation of its spin, by virtue of the spin-orbit coupling in the 2DEG. The holonomic qubit trajectories can densely cover the full Bloch sphere as the soliton state revolves around the junction. Effects of non-holonomic (dynamic) qubit drift are also analyzed.

Title: Bootstrapping entanglement in quantum spin systems
Authors: Jiaju Zhang, Arash Jafarizadeh, M. A. Rajabpour
Abstract: In this paper, we employ the bootstrap method, a technique that relies on consistency relations instead of direct diagonalization, to determine the expectation values in quantum many-body systems. We then use these values to assess the entanglement content of the system. Our work extends the bootstrap approach to quantum many-body systems, rather than single-body or few-body systems, concentrating on the well-known Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) model with both transverse and longitudinal external magnetic fields. In the bootstrap method we solve the LMG model with up to 16 sites. Unlike previous studies that have focused mainly on ground-state properties, our methodology allows for the calculation of a broad range of properties, including energy spectrum, angular momentum, concurrence, tangle, residual tangle, and quantum Fisher information (QFI), for all eigenstates or a particular sector of the eigenstates, without referring to the explicit wavefunctions of these states. We show that this approach offers not only a new computational methodology but also a comprehensive view of both bipartite and multipartite entanglement properties across the entire spectrum of eigenstates. Specifically, we demonstrate that states typically found in the central region of the spectrum exhibit greater multipartite entanglement, as indicated by larger QFI values, compared to states at the edges of the spectrum. In contrast, concurrence displays the opposite trend. This observed behavior is in line with the monogamy principle governing quantum entanglement.

Title: Effective range expansion with a long-range force
Authors: Meng-Lin Du, Feng-Kun Guo, Bing Wu
Abstract: The validity range of the time-honored effective range expansion can be very limited due to the presence of a left-hand cut close to the two-particle threshold. Such a left-hand cut arises in the two-particle interaction involving a light particle exchange with a mass small or slightly heavier than the mass difference of the two particles, identified as a long-range force, a scenario encountered in a broad range of systems. This can hinder a precise extraction of low-energy scattering observables and resonance poles. To address this issue, we propose a new parameterization for the low-energy scattering amplitude that accounts for the left-hand cut. The parameterization is like a Padé approximation but with nonanalytic terms from the left-hand cut and can be regarded as an extension of the effective range expansion. This parameterization is versatile and applicable to a broad range of systems with Yukawa-type interactions -- including particle, hadronic, nuclear, cold atom and quantum gas systems. In particular, it should be invaluable in understanding various near-threshold hadron resonances. As byproducts, we also show that the parameterization can be used to extract the couplings of the exchanged particle to the scattering particles, and derive expressions for amplitude zeros caused by the interplay between the short- and long-range interactions.

Title: Emergent broadband polarization entanglement from electronic and phononic Stokes-anti-Stokes indistinguishability
Authors: Diego Sier, Lucas Valente, Tiago A. Freitas, Marcelo F. Santos, Carlos H. Monken, Raul Corrêa, Ado Jorio
Abstract: Recently [PRA 108, L051501 (2023)], it has been shown that in a centrosymmetric cubic system, two-photons from a broadband intense laser field can be converted into a pair of Stokes and anti-Stokes (SaS) entangled photons. While the previous work was based on symmetry arguments, here we present a fully quantum theory for the SaS scattering that properly explains, quantitatively describes, and provides a means to predict its spectral and polarization properties (for diamond). We also explore the possibilities offered by such system, designing an entanglement map based on changes in the light-matter system. In particular, we show how the broadband polarization entanglement, that emerges from the interference between electronic and phononic degrees of freedom in the SaS scattering, depends on parameters such as Stokes-anti-Stokes Raman shift, scattering geometry and laser bandwidth, opening the avenue of exploration of such phenomenon in information processing.

Title: Vortex wall phase in fractonic XY-plaquette model on square lattice
Authors: A. M. Begun, M. N. Chernodub, V. A. Goy, A. V. Molochkov
Abstract: The XY-plaquette model is the most straightforward lattice realization of a broad class of fractonic field theories that host quasiparticles with restricted mobility. The plaquette interaction appears naturally as a ring-exchange term in the low-energy description of exciton Bose liquids, cold atomic gases, and quantum dimer models. Using first-principle Monte Carlo simulations, we study the phase diagram and the vortex dynamics in the XY-plaquette model on a square lattice in two spatial dimensions. In its minimal formulation, the model contains a ring-exchange plaquette term in two spatial dimensions and a standard XY-link term in the (imaginary) time direction. We show that the phase diagram of the minimal XY-plaquette model possesses two phases: (i) a disordered vortex-dominated phase in which a single percolating vortex trajectory occupies the whole 3d spacetime; (ii) a partially disordered phase in which the vortices become partially immobile, with their worldlines strictly confined to one or several infinite two-dimensional planes. The spatial positions and spatial orientations (along $x$ or $y$ axis) of these vortex domain walls appear to be spontaneous. Individual vortices form a disordered system within each vortex domain wall, so the fractal spacetime dimension of vortex trajectories approaches $D_f = 2$. We argue that the appearance of the vortex walls could be interpreted as a consequence of the spontaneous breaking of a global internal symmetry in the compact XY-plaquette model.

Abstract: Due to the inherently probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics, each experimental realization of a dynamical quantum system may yield a different measurement outcome, especially when the system is coupled to an environment that causes dissipation. Although it is in principle possible that some quantum trajectories lead to exotic highly entangled quantum states, the probability of observing these trajectories is usually extremely low. In this work, we show how to maximize the probability of generating highly entangled states, including maximally entangled cat states, in an ensemble of atoms experiencing superradiant decay. To this end, we analyze an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian which governs the dynamics between the quantum jumps associated with photon emission. A key result of our study is that, in order to maximally enhance the probability of cat state generation, the initial state needs to be non-classical. This can be achieved e.g. with one-axis twisting in a cavity-QED system.

Title: Quantum-Classical Correspondence of Non-Hermitian Symmetry Breaking
Authors: Zhuo-Ting Cai, Hai-Dong Li, Wei Chen
Abstract: Real-to-complex spectral transitions and the associated spontaneous symmetry breaking of eigenstates are central to non-Hermitian physics, yet a comprehensive and universal theory that precisely describes the underlying physical mechanisms for each individual state remains elusive. Here, we resolve the mystery by employing the complex path integral formalism and developing a generalized Gutzwiller trace formula. These methodologies enable us to establish a universal quantum-classical correspondence that precisely links the real or complex nature of individual energy levels to the symmetry properties of their corresponding semiclassical orbits. Specifically, in systems with a general $\eta$-pseudo-Hermitian symmetry, real energy levels are quantized along periodic orbits that preserve the corresponding classical $S_\eta$ symmetry. In contrast, complex conjugate energy levels arise from semiclassical orbits that individually break the $S_\eta$ symmetry but together form $S_\eta$-symmetric pairs. This framework provides a unified explanation for the spectral behaviors in various continuous non-Hermitian models and for the $\mathcal{PT}$ transition in two-level systems. Besides, we demonstrate that the exceptional point is inherently a quantum phenomenon, as it cannot be described by a single classical orbit. Our work uncovers the physical mechanism of non-Hermitian symmetry breaking and introduces a new perspective with broad implications for the control and application of non-Hermitian phenomena.

Title: Coherent control over the high-dimensional space of the nuclear spin of alkaline-earth atoms
Authors: Husain Ahmed, Andrea Litvinov, Pauline Guesdon, Etienne Maréchal, John H. Huckans, Benjamin Pasquiou, Bruno Laburthe-Tolra, Martin Robert-de-Saint-Vincent
Abstract: We demonstrate coherent manipulation of the nuclear degrees of freedom of ultracold ground-state strontium 87 atoms, thus providing a toolkit for fully exploiting the corresponding large Hilbert space as a quantum resource and for quantum simulation experiments with SU(N)-symmetric matter. By controlling the resonance conditions of Raman transitions with a tensor light shift, we can perform rotations within a restricted Hilbert space of two isolated spin states among the 2F+1 = 10 possible states. These manipulations correspond to engineering unitary operations deriving from generators of the SU(N) algebra beyond what can be done by simple spin precession. We present Ramsey interferometers involving an isolated pair of Zeeman states with no measurable decoherence after 3 seconds. We also demonstrate that one can harvest the large spin degrees of freedom as a qudit resource by implementing two interferometer schemes over four states. The first scheme senses in parallel multiple external fields acting on the atoms, and the second scheme simultaneously measures multiple observables of a collective atomic state - including non-commuting ones. Engineering unitary transformations of the large spin driven by other generators than the usual spin-F representation of the SU(2) group offers new possibilities from the point of view of quantum metrology and quantum many-body physics, notably for the quantum simulation of large-spin SU(N)-symmetric quantum magnetism with fermionic alkaline-earth atoms.

Title: Microwave scattering by rough polyhedral particles on a surface
Authors: Anne Virkki, Maxim Yurkin
Abstract: The electromagnetic (EM) scattering by non-symmetric wavelength-scale particles on a planar surface has numerous applications in the remote sensing of planetary bodies, both in planetary and geo-sciences. We conduct numerical simulations of EM scattering by rough polyhedral particles (with 12 or 20 faces) using the discrete-dipole approximation and contrast the results to that of spheres. The particles have permittivities corresponding to common minerals in the microwave regime ($\epsilon_r=4.7 + 0.016$i and $7.8 + 0.09$i), and a size-frequency distribution (SFD) consistent with the observed scattering properties (power-law distribution of size parameters between 0.5 and 8 with an index from $-2.5$ to $-3.5$). The assumed substrate permittivity $2.4 + 0.012$i corresponds to a powdered regolith. We present what roles the particle roundness, permittivity, and SFD for a realistic range of parameters play in the EM scattering properties as a function of incidence angle with a focus on backscattering in microwave-remote-sensing applications. The particle roundness and SFD have a clearly observable effect on the polarimetric properties, while the role of permittivity is relatively minor (in the studied range). Among various backscattering observables, the circular polarization ratio is the least sensitive to the decrease of the upper boundary (down to a size parameter of 3) and the index of the SFD.

Title: Bridging Text and Crystal Structures: Literature-driven Contrastive Learning for Materials Science
Authors: Yuta Suzuki, Tatsunori Taniai, Ryo Igarashi, Kotaro Saito, Naoya Chiba, Yoshitaka Ushiku, Kanta Ono
Abstract: Understanding structure-property relationships is an essential yet challenging aspect of materials discovery and development. To facilitate this process, recent studies in materials informatics have sought latent embedding spaces of crystal structures to capture their similarities based on properties and functionalities. However, abstract feature-based embedding spaces are human-unfriendly and prevent intuitive and efficient exploration of the vast materials space. Here we introduce Contrastive Language--Structure Pre-training (CLaSP), a learning paradigm for constructing crossmodal embedding spaces between crystal structures and texts. CLaSP aims to achieve material embeddings that 1) capture property- and functionality-related similarities between crystal structures and 2) allow intuitive retrieval of materials via user-provided description texts as queries. To compensate for the lack of sufficient datasets linking crystal structures with textual descriptions, CLaSP leverages a dataset of over 400,000 published crystal structures and corresponding publication records, including paper titles and abstracts, for training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CLaSP through text-based crystal structure screening and embedding space visualization.

Title: 2064 global population crisis scenario predicted by the most general dynamic model
Authors: Alessio Zaccone, Kostya Trachenko
Abstract: There is currently no consensus on how the global population will evolve in the next decades and in the next century. The reason for this uncertainty is the absence of reliable population dynamic models. In this paper, we remedy to this situation by reporting on a population dynamic model, a single nonlinear differential equation adapted from the physics of disordered systems, which is able to mathematically describe all the various regimes encountered in the global population recorded as a function of time, over the past 12000 years until now. Regimes of simple exponential growth (Malthus), logistic (Verhulst) plateaus as well as stretched-exponential and compressed-exponential growth regimes are all reliably described by this mathematical equation in its various limits. Besides showing that this is, indeed, the most general population dynamic model, we use it to explore its solutions projected into the future. In particular, two different scenarios are predicted. In one of them, which assumes that the future evolution would continue along a similar pattern as the past decades (hence without any major global ecological crisis affecting the resource exploitation), a von Foerster-type doomsday scenario with a sudden rise of the global population to unsustainable levels could appear as early as 2078. In the opposite scenario, if a global ecological crisis were to set in today, affecting the ability to exploit resources, given the current estimates of the Earth's carrying capacity, the global population is forecasted to reduce by half by 2064. Furthermore, the proposed dynamic model provides with a new aggregated parameter (K, in the model) that can be monitored and controlled so as to avoid the doomsday scenarios.

Title: Quantum Lamb model
Authors: Dennis P. Clougherty, Nam H. Dinh
Abstract: H. Lamb considered the classical dynamics of a vibrating particle embedded in an elastic medium before the development of quantum theory. Lamb was interested in how the back-action of the elastic waves generated can damp the vibrations of the particle. We propose a quantum version of Lamb's model. We show that this model is exactly solvable by using a multimode Bogoliubov transformation. We find that the exact system ground state is a multimode squeezed vacuum state, and we obtain the exact Bogoliubov frequencies by numerically solving a nonlinear integral equation. A closed-form expression for the damping rate of the particle is obtained, and it agrees with the result obtained by perturbation theory. The model provides a solvable example of the damped quantum harmonic oscillator.

Title: Forces on alkali Rydberg atoms due to non-linearly polarized light
Authors: A. Bhowmik, D. Blume
Abstract: Trapped Rydberg atoms are highly promising candidates for quantum science experiments. While several approaches have been put forward to exert (trapping) forces on isolated Rydberg atoms, a widely applicable lossless technique is lacking. This paper proposes a robust versatile alternative technique that avoids lifetime compromising losses. Our proposal leverages the vector polarizability, which is induced by non-linearly polarized light and is shown to be several orders of magnitude larger than the usual scalar and tensor polarizabilities for commonly used alkali Rydberg series such as the $nS$, $nP$, and $nD$ series with principal quantum number $n$ as low as 30. The resulting force can be used to trap isolated Rydberg atoms over long times, which constitutes a key advance that is expected to impact quantum simulation applications, as well as to generate large light--Rydberg-atom hybrid states, which possess non-trivial position-dependent forces.

Title: Emergence of thermodynamic functioning regimes from finite coupling between a quantum thermal machine and a load
Authors: Gauthameshwar S., Noufal Jaseem, Dario Poletti
Abstract: Autonomous quantum thermal machines are particularly suited to understand how correlations between thermal baths, a load, and a thermal machine affect the overall thermodynamic functioning of the setup. Here, we show that by tuning the operating temperatures and the magnitude of the coupling between machine and load, the thermal machine can operate in four modes: engine, accelerator, heater, or refrigerator. In particular, we show that as we increase the coupling strength, the engine mode is suppressed, and the refrigerator mode is no longer attainable, leaving the heater as the most pronounced functioning modality, followed by the accelerator. This regime switching can be amplified by quantum effects, such as the bosonic enhancement factor for a harmonic oscillator load, which modifies the effective machine-load coupling, making the thermodynamic functioning sensitive to the initial preparation of the load.

Title: Radon Transforms and the SYK model
Authors: Michael Stone
Abstract: Motivated by recent work on the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, we consider the effect of Radon or X-ray transformations, on the Laplace eigenfunctions in hyperbolic Bolyai-Lobachevsky space. We show that the Radon map from this space to Lorentzian-signature Anti-de Sitter or de Sitter space is easier to interpret if we use the Poincare disc model and eigenfunctions rather than the upper-half-plane model. In particular, this version of the transform reveals the geometric origin of the boundary conditions imposed on the eigenfunctions that are involved in calculating the SYK four-point function.

Title: Knowledge Distillation Framework for Accelerating High-Accuracy Neural Network-Based Molecular Dynamics Simulations
Authors: Naoki Matsumura, Yuta Yoshimoto, Yuto Iwasaki, Meguru Yamazaki, Yasufumi Sakai
Abstract: Neural network potentials (NNPs) offer a powerful alternative to traditional force fields for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Accurate and stable MD simulations, crucial for evaluating material properties, require training data encompassing both low-energy stable structures and high-energy structures. Conventional knowledge distillation (KD) methods fine-tune a pre-trained NNP as a teacher model to generate training data for a student model. However, in material-specific models, this fine-tuning process increases energy barriers, making it difficult to create training data containing high-energy structures. To address this, we propose a novel KD framework that leverages a non-fine-tuned, off-the-shelf pre-trained NNP as a teacher. Its gentler energy landscape facilitates the exploration of a wider range of structures, including the high-energy structures crucial for stable MD simulations. Our framework employs a two-stage training process: first, the student NNP is trained with a dataset generated by the off-the-shelf teacher; then, it is fine-tuned with a smaller, high-accuracy density functional theory (DFT) dataset. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by applying it to both organic (polyethylene glycol) and inorganic (L$_{10}$GeP$_{2}$S$_{12}$) materials, achieving comparable or superior accuracy in reproducing physical properties compared to existing methods. Importantly, our method reduces the number of expensive DFT calculations by 10x compared to existing NNP generation methods, without sacrificing accuracy. Furthermore, the resulting student NNP achieves up to 106x speedup in inference compared to the teacher NNP, enabling significantly faster and more efficient MD simulations.
