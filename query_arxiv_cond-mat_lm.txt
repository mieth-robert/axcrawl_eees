Title: Dispersion and losses of plasmons along simple metasurfaces: the analysis of dispersion equations
Authors: Michael V. Davidovich
Abstract: The flat metasurfaces described by tensor surface conductivity, the transverse size of which is small compared to the wavelength, are considered. In this case, we introduce two-dimensional surface conductivity for them, as well as for infinitely thin conductive sheets of graphene type. The method of Green's tensor functions of electrodynamics connecting fields and current densities, as well as the mode matching technique, are used. Conductive films on substrates are considered, including layered substrates of finite thickness with periodic layers and infinite substrates, as well as gradient substrates with a dependence of the dielectric constant on the thickness. Two-dimensional periodic structures of conductive films and dielectric films doped with nanoparticles are also analyzed. The possibility of applying the method to diffraction of surface plasmons on metasurface inhomogeneities is analyzed.

Title: On nonlinear graphene response on monochromatic electromagnetic wave in the form as generation of harmonics
Authors: Michael V. Davidovich
Abstract: We consider the linear and nonlinear response of a weighted graphene sheet under the normal incidence of a plane electromagnetic wave in the form of a quasi-monochromatic pulse of long duration with a sharp edge and harmonic filling. The generation of odd harmonics in the reflected and transmitted spectra is obtained. The coefficient of transformation of the first harmonic into the third harmonic at a frequency of 10 Hz is of the order of 10-3. We use perturbative theory based on the quantum Wallace strong coupling model with field amplitude expansion and integration over the entire Brillouin zone (BZ), solving the kinetic Boltzmann equation with a collision integral in the Bhatnagar-Gross-Crook (BGK) form. The electromagnetic field is considered classically, while its vector potential changes the quasi-pulse in the dispersion equation.

Title: The Strain Impact on Weyl Semimetals
Authors: Gengyue Dong
Abstract: Weyl semimetals are a class of topological semimetals defined by a Chern number as their topological invariant. These materials exhibit unique properties, such as transverse topological currents and anomalous magnetoelectric responses, making them promising candidates for device this http URL thesis explores the effects of strain on the electronic properties of Weyl semimetals using both toy models and first-principles calculations, specifically density functional theory (DFT) combined with the Wannier method. We investigated the strain effects on two-band tight-binding toy models by tuning their hopping integrals. To connect these models to real materials, we derived a tight-binding Hamiltonian from DFT combined with Wannier functions and analyzed the surface states and density of states under varying strain conditions. Our results reveal that both tensile and compressive strains significantly alter the electronic structure of TaAs, potentially inducing topological phase transitions. Specifically, tensile strain along the [100] direction leads to the transformation and eventual disappearance of Fermi arcs, while compressive strain results in the formation of complex surface states, suggesting the emergence of a new phase at higher strain levels.

Title: Effects of Galactic Irradiation on Thermal and Electronic Transport in Tungsten
Authors: C.Ugwumadu, D. A. Drabold, R. Tutchton
Abstract: The impact of irradiation on the thermal and electronic properties of materials is a persistent puzzle, particularly defect formation at the atomic and nanoscales. This work examines the nanoscale effects of low-energy irradiation on tungsten (W), focusing on defect-induced modifications to thermal and electronic transport. Using the Site-Projected Thermal Conductivity (SPTC) method [A. Gautam et al. PSS-RRL, 2400306, 2024], we analyze bulk and twin-grain boundary W with vacancy defects based on the Norgett-Robinson-Torrens displacements per atom (NRT-dpa) model. SPTC provides a detailed prediction of post-cascade spatial thermal conductivity distribution. We estimate electronic conductivity activity using the "N2 method" [K. Nepal et al. Carbon, 119711, 2025] to explore the consequences of vacancies and grain boundaries, highlighting the defect-dependent nature of charge transport behavior. These findings offer high-resolution insights into irradiation-driven transport phenomena, with implications for space-exposed materials and nanoscale thermal/electronic management.

Title: 't Hooft anomalies in metals
Authors: Dominic V. Else
Abstract: I review some recent results on understanding the physics of metals in an exact non-perturbative way through the powerful field-theoretic concepts of emergent symmetries and 't Hooft anomalies. A 't Hooft anomaly is a discrete topological property that quantum field theories with global symmetries can have. I explain how many of the properties of metals can in fact be viewed as direct consequences of the anomaly. This allows a structural understanding of metals, including non-Fermi liquids, to be obtained even in the absence of any exact solution for the strongly coupled dynamics. I then outline the main limitations and outstanding questions.

Title: Band Renormalization, Quarter Metals, and Chiral Superconductivity in Rhombohedral Tetralayer Graphene
Authors: Guillermo Parra-Martinez, Alejandro Jimeno-Pozo, Vo Tien Phong, Hector Sainz-Cruz, Daniel Kaplan, Peleg Emanuel, Yuval Oreg, Pierre A. Pantaleon, Jose Angel Silva-Guillen, Francisco Guinea
Abstract: Recently, exotic superconductivity emerging from a spin-and-valley-polarized metallic phase has been observed in rhombohedral tetralayer graphene. To explain this finding, we study the role of electron-electron interactions in determining flavor symmetry breaking, using the Hartree Fock (HF) approximation, and also superconductivity driven by repulsive interactions. Though mean field HF correctly predicts the isospin flavors and reproduces the experimental phase diagram, it overestimates the band renormalization near the Fermi energy and suppresses superconducting instabilities. To address this, we introduce a physically motivated scheme that includes internal screening in the HF calculation. Superconductivity arises in the spin-valley polarized phase for a range of electric fields and electron doping. Our findings reproduce the experimental observations and reveal a $p$-wave, finite-momentum, time-reversal symmetry broken superconducting state, encouraging further investigation into exotic phases in graphene multilayers.

Title: Probing Green's Function Zeros by Co-tunneling through Mott Insulators
Authors: Carl Lehmann, Lorenzo Crippa, Giorgio Sangiovanni, Jan Carl Budich
Abstract: Quantum tunneling experiments have provided deep insights into basic excitations occurring as Green's function poles in the realm of complex quantum matter. However, strongly correlated quantum materials also allow for Green's functions zeros (GFZ) that may be seen as an antidote to the familiar poles, and have so far largely eluded direct experimental study. Here, we propose and investigate theoretically how co-tunneling through Mott insulators enables direct access to the shadow band structure of GFZ. In particular, we derive an effective Hamiltonian for the GFZ that is shown to govern the co-tunneling amplitude and reveal fingerprints of many-body correlations clearly distinguishing the GFZ structure from the underlying free Bloch band structure of the system. Our perturbative analytical results are corroborated by numerical data both in the framework of exact diagonalization and matrix product state simulations for a one-dimensional model system consisting of a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-Hubbard model coupled to two single level quantum dots.

Title: Theta electromagnetism in quantum spin ice: Microscopic analysis of improper symmetries
Authors: Gautam K. Naik, Jonathan N. Hallén, Chris R. Laumann
Abstract: $U(1)$ gauge theories, including conventional Maxwell electromagnetism, allow $\theta$-terms when parity and time-reversal symmetry are broken. In condensed matter systems, the physics of $\theta$ as a magnetoelectric response has been explored extensively within the context of topological insulators and multiferroics. We show how $\theta$-terms can arise in the internal dynamics of the emergent electromagnetism in a $U(1)$ quantum spin liquid. In its Coulomb phase, the minimal model of pyrochlore quantum spin ice is governed by a six-spin ring exchange Hamiltonian. We identify the next-order contribution to the microscopic Hamiltonian when parity, time-reversal, and all improper spatial symmetries are broken -- a seven-spin term which leads to a two-parameter lattice gauge theory with a $\theta$-electromagnetic phase. We derive how the seven-spin term is generated perturbatively within each of the three symmetry classes of short-range pyrochlore spin ice. Within a complete microscopic symmetry analysis, we find that the most general nearest-neighbor Hamiltonians fail to generate the seven-spin term, and one must include next-nearest-neighbor interactions to obtain an emergent $\theta$. Using gauge mean-field theory we compute additional contributions to the $\theta$-term from the spinon sector. Finally, we determine the conditions required for an internal $\theta$-term to generate a significant external magnetoelectic response.

Title: Single-band square lattice Hubbard model from twisted bilayer C568
Authors: Zhu-Xi Luo, Ashvin Vishwanath, Toshikaze Kariyado
Abstract: We propose twisted homobilayer of a carbon allotrope, C$_{568}$, to be a promising platform to realize controllable square lattice single-band extended Hubbard model. This setup has the advantage of a widely tunable $t'/t$ ratio without adding external fields, and the intermediate temperature $t\ll T\ll U$ regime can be easily achieved. We first analyze the continuum model obtained from symmetry analysis and first-principle calculations, and calculate the band structures. Subsequently, we derive the corresponding tight-binding models and fit the hopping parameters as well as the Coulomb interactions. When displacement field is applied, anisotropic nearest neighbor hoppings can further be achieved. If successfully fabricated, the device could be an important stepping stone towards understanding high-temperature superconductivity.

Title: Signatures of collective photon emission and ferroelectric ordering of excitons near their Mott insulating state in a WSe$_2$/WS$_2$ heterobilayer
Authors: Luka Matej Devenica, Zach Hadjri, Jan Kumlin, Runtong Li, Weijie Li, Daniel Suarez Forrero, Valeria Vento, Nicolas Ubrig, Song Liu, James Hone, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Thomas Pohl, Ajit Srivastava
Abstract: Spontaneous symmetry breaking, arising from the competition of interactions and quantum fluctuations, is fundamental to understanding ordered electronic phases. Although electrically neutral, optical excitations like excitons can interact through their dipole moment, raising the possibility of optically active ordered phases. The effects of spontaneous ordering on optical properties remain largely unexplored. Recent observations of the excitonic Mott insulating state in semiconducting moiré crystals make them promising for addressing this question. Here, we present evidence for an in-plane ferroelectric phase of dipolar moiré excitons driven by strong exciton-exciton interactions. We discover a surprising speed-up of photon emission at late times and low densities in excitonic decay. This counterintuitive behavior is attributed to collective radiance, linked to the transition between disordered and symmetry-broken ferroelectric phases of moiré excitons. Our findings provide first evidence for strong dipolar inter-site interactions in moiré lattices, demonstrate collective photon emission as a probe for moiré quantum materials, and pave the way for exploring cooperative optical phenomena in strongly correlated systems.

Title: Evidence for strongly correlated superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ from first principles
Authors: Daan Verraes, Tom Braeckevelt, Nick Bultinck, Veronique Van Speybroeck
Abstract: We conduct first-principles simulations of pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, a material in which a recent series of experiments has found signs of high-temperature superconductivity. In the pressure range where superconductivity is observed, we find a significant increase in the Hubbard U parameter (i.e. the strength of on-site repulsion) for the maximally localized Wannier states comprising the density functional theory (DFT) bands crossing the Fermi energy. We attribute this increase in U to reduced screening by the nearby La 5d bands - an effect that is sensitive to the pressure-driven crystal structure. Our results therefore indicate that the superconducting region in the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ phase diagram coincides with a region of enhanced electronic correlations. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations extend these trends to finite temperatures, providing insights into the experimentally observed transition lines. Finally, we explore intrinsic chemical pressure using DFT simulations of Ac$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.

Title: Intercalated structures formed by platinum on epitaxial graphene on SiC(0001)
Authors: Letizia Ferbel, Stefano Veronesi, Antonio Rossi, Stiven Forti, Camilla Coletti, Stefan Heun
Abstract: Graphene on SiC intercalated with two-dimensional metal layers, such as Pt, offers a versatile platform for applications in spintronics, catalysis, and beyond. Recent studies have demonstrated that Pt atoms can intercalate at the heterointerface between SiC(0001) and the C-rich $(6\sqrt{3}\times6\sqrt{3})$R30° reconstructed surface (hereafter referred as the buffer layer). However, key aspects such as intercalated phase structure and intercalation mechanisms remain unclear. In this work, we investigate changes in morphology, chemistry, and electronic structure for both buffer layer and monolayer graphene grown on SiC(0001) following Pt deposition and annealing cycles, which eventually led to Pt intercalation at temperatures above 500°C. Atomic-resolution imaging of the buffer layer reveals a single intercalated Pt layer that removes the periodic corrugation of the buffer layer, arising from partial bonding of C-atoms with Si-atoms of the substrate. In monolayer graphene, the Pt-intercalated regions exhibit a two-level structure: the first level corresponds to a Pt layer intercalated below the buffer layer, while the second level contains a second Pt layer, giving rise to a $(12\times12)$ superstructure relative to graphene. Upon intercalation, Pt atoms appear as silicides, indicating a reaction with Si atoms from the substrate. Additionally, charge neutral $\pi$-bands corresponding to quasi-free-standing monolayer and bilayer graphene emerge. Analysis of multiple samples, coupled with a temperature-dependent study of the intercalation rate, demonstrates the pivotal role of buffer layer regions in facilitating the Pt intercalation in monolayer graphene. These findings provide valuable insight into Pt intercalation, advancing the potential for applications.

Title: A generalized calculation of the rate independent single crystal yield surface
Authors: Matthew Kasemer, Paul R. Dawson
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss a method to calculate the topology of the rate independent single crystal yield surface for materials with arbitrary slip systems and arbitrary slip strengths. We describe the general problem, as motivated by Schmid's law, and detail the calculation of hyperplanes in deviatoric stress space, $\mathbb{D}^5$, which describe the criteria for slip on individual slip systems. We focus on finding the intersection of five linearly independent hyperplanes which represent stresses necessary to satisfy the criteria for general plastic deformation. Finally, we describe a method for calculating the inner convex hull of these intersection points, which describe the vertices of the five dimensional polytope that represents the single crystal yield surface. Our method applies to arbitrary crystal structure, allowing for an arbitrary number and type of slip systems and families, considers plastic anisotropy via inter- and intra-family strength anisotropy, and further considers strength anisotropy between slip in the positive and negative direction. We discuss the calculation and possible applications, and share a computational implementation of the calculation of the single crystal yield surface.

Title: Comment on "InAs-Al hybrid devices passing the topological gap protocol", Microsoft Quantum, Phys. Rev. B 107, 245423 (2023)
Authors: Henry F. Legg
Abstract: The topological gap protocol (TGP) is presented as "a series of stringent experimental tests" for the presence of topological superconductivity and associated Majorana bound states. Here, we show that the TGP, 'passed' by Microsoft Quantum [PRB 107, 245423 (2023)], lacks a consistent definition of 'gap' or 'topological', and even utilises different parameters when applied to theoretical simulations compared to experimental data. Furthermore, the TGP's outcome is sensitive to the choice of magnetic field range, bias voltage range, data resolution, and number of cutter voltage pairs - data parameters that, in PRB 107, 245423 (2023), vary significantly, even for measurements of the same device. As a result, the core claims of PRB 107, 245423 (2023) are primarily based on unexplained measurement choices and inconsistent definitions, rather than on intrinsic properties of the studied devices. As such, Microsoft Quantum's claim in PRB 107, 245423 (2023) that their devices have a "high probability of being in the topological phase" is not reliable and must be revisited. Our findings also suggest that subsequent studies, e.g. Nature 638, 651-655 (2025), that are based on tuning up devices via the TGP are built on a flawed protocol and should also be revisited.

Title: Anisotropy-Driven Quantum Level-Crossing in Spin-1 Heisenberg Dimers: Applications in Quantum Stirling Machines
Authors: Bastian Castorene, Vinicius Gomez de Paula, Francisco J. Peña, Clebson Cruz, Mario Reis, Patricio Vargas
Abstract: This work explores the thermodynamic performance of a quantum Stirling heat engine implemented with an anisotropic spin-1 Heisenberg dimer as the working medium. Using the Hamiltonian of the system, we analyze the interplay of anisotropy, magnetic field, and exchange interactions and their influence on the energy spectrum and the quantum level crossing. Our results reveal that double-degenerate point (DDP) and a triple-degenerate point (TDP) play pivotal roles in shaping the operational regimes and efficiency of the quantum Stirling engine. At those points, the Carnot efficiency reaches higher work output and enhanced stability, making it a robust candidate for optimal thermodynamic performance. These findings highlight the potential of anisotropic spin systems as viable platforms for quantum heat engines and contribute to advancing the field of quantum thermodynamics.

Title: An Analysis of First- and Second-Order Optimization Algorithms in Variational Monte Carlo
Authors: Ruojing Peng, Garnet Kin-Lic Chan
Abstract: Many quantum many-body wavefunctions, such as Jastrow-Slater, tensor network, and neural quantum states, are studied with the variational Monte Carlo technique, where stochastic optimization is usually performed to obtain a faithful approximation to the ground-state of a given Hamiltonian. While first order gradient descent methods are commonly used for such optimizations, recent second order optimization formulations offer the potential of faster convergence under certain theoretical conditions, but with a similar cost per sample to first order methods. However, the relative performance of first order and second order optimizers is influenced in practice by many factors, including the sampling requirements for a faithful optimization step, the influence of wavefunction quality, as well as the wavefunction parametrization and expressivity. Here we analyze these performance characteristics of first order and second order optimization methods for a variety of Hamiltonians, with the additional context of understanding the scaling of these methods (for good performance) as a function of system size. Our findings help clarify the role of first order and second order methods in variational Monte Carlo calculations and the conditions under which they should respectively be used. In particular, we find that unlike in deterministic optimization, where closeness to the variational minimum determines the suitability of second order methods, in stochastic optimization the main factor is the overall expressivity of the wavefunction: second order methods lead to an overall reduction in cost relative to first order methods when the wavefunction is sufficiently expressive to represent the ground-state, even when starting away from the ground state. This makes second order methods an important technique when used with wavefunctions with arbitrarily improvable accuracy.

Title: Odd Active Solids: Vortices, Velocity Oscillations and Dissipation-Free Modes
Authors: Lorenzo Caprini, Umberto Marini Bettolo Marconi
Abstract: A wide range of physical and biological systems, including colloidal magnets, granular spinners, and starfish embryos, are characterized by strongly rotating units that give rise to odd viscosity and odd elasticity. These active systems can be described using a coarse-grained model in which the pairwise forces between particles include a transverse component compared to standard interactions due to a central potential. These non-potential, additional forces, referred to as odd interactions, do not conserve energy or angular momentum and induce rotational motion. Here, we study a two-dimensional crystal composed of inertial Brownian particles that interact via odd forces and are in thermal contact with their environment. In the underdamped regime, the energy injected by odd forces can counteract dissipation due to friction, leading to quasi-dissipation-free excitations with finite frequency and wavelength. In the resulting non-equilibrium steady state, the system exhibits angular momentum and velocity correlations. When the strength of the odd forces exceeds a certain threshold or friction is too low, a crystal with only harmonic springs becomes linearly unstable due to transverse fluctuations. This instability can be mitigated by introducing nonlinear central interactions, which suppress the divergence of short-wavelength velocity fluctuations and allows us to numerically explore the linearly unstable regime. This is characterized by pronounced temporal oscillations in the velocity featuring the existence of vortex structures and kinetic temperature values larger than the thermal temperature.

Title: Anomalous Long-range Hard-wall Repulsion between Polymers in Solvent Mixtures and Its Implication for Biomolecular Condensates
Authors: Luofu Liu, Rui Wang
Abstract: The system of polymers in solvent mixtures is a widely-used model to represent biomolecular condensates in intracellular environments. Here, we apply a variational theory to control the center-of-mass of two polymers and perform the first quantification of their interactions in solvent mixtures. Even both solvent and cosolvent are good to the polymer, we demonstrate that strong polymer-cosolvent affinity induces the formation of a single-chain condensate. Even though all the molecular interactions are soft, the potential of mean force between two condensates exhibits an anomalous feature of long-range hard-wall repulsion, which cannot be categorized into any existing types of inter-chain interactions. This repulsion is enhanced as either the affinity or the bulk cosolvent fraction increases. The underlying mechanism is cosolvent regulation manifested as a discontinuous local condensation of cosolvent. The hard-wall repulsion provides a kinetic barrier to prevent coalescence of condensates and hence highlights the intrinsic role of proteins as a cosolvent in stabilizing biomolecular condensates.

Title: Quantitative description of strongly correlated materials by combining downfolding techniques and tensor networks
Authors: Daan Vrancken, Simon Ganne, Daan Verraes, Tom Braeckevelt, Lukas Devos, Jutho Haegeman, Veronique Van Speybroeck
Abstract: We present a high-accuracy procedure for electronic structure calculations of strongly correlated materials. The approach involves downfolding the full Hilbert space into a low-energy subspace that captures the most significant electron correlations, leading to an effective Hubbard model. This generalized model is then solved using tensor network methods. Our work focuses on one-dimensional and quasi-one-dimensional materials, for which we employ the machinery of matrix product states. We apply this framework to the conjugated polymers trans-polyacetylene and polythiophene, as well as the quasi-one-dimensional charge-transfer insulator Sr2CuO3. The predicted band gaps exhibit quantitative agreement with state-of-the-art computational techniques and experimental measurements. Beyond band gaps, tensor networks provide access to a wide range of physically relevant properties, including spin magnetization and various excitation energies. Their flexibility supports the implementation of complex Hamiltonians with longer-range interactions, while the bond dimension enables systematic control over accuracy. Furthermore, the computational cost scales efficiently with system size, demonstrating the framework's scalability.

Ortiz, Ganesh Pokharel, Stephen D. Wilson, Domenico Di Sante, Carmine Ortix, Mario Cuoco
Abstract: The kagome lattice stands as a rich platform for hosting a wide array of correlated quantum phenomena, ranging from charge density waves and superconductivity to electron nematicity and loop current states. Direct detection of loop currents in kagome systems has remained a formidable challenge due to their intricate spatial arrangements and the weak magnetic field signatures they produce. This has left their existence and underlying mechanisms a topic of intense debate. In this work, we uncover a hallmark reconcilable with loop currents: spin handedness-selective signals that surpass conventional dichroic, spin, and spin-dichroic responses. We observe this phenomenon in the kagome metal CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$ and we call it the anomalous spin-optical helical effect. This effect arises from the coupling of light' s helicity with spin-orbital electron correlations, providing a groundbreaking method to visualize loop currents in quantum materials. Our discovery not only enriches the debate surrounding loop currents but also paves the way for new strategies to exploit the electronic phases of quantum materials via light-matter interaction.

Title: In-plane Ising superconductivity revealed by exchange interactions
Authors: Junyi Yang, Changjiang Liu, Xianjing Zhou, John Pearson, Alexey Suslov, Dafei Jin, Jidong S. Jiang, Ulrich Welp, Michael R. Norman, Anand Bhattacharya
Abstract: Two-dimensional superconductors with spin-textured Fermi surfaces can be a platform for realizing unconventional pairing and are of substantial interest in the context of quantum information science, and superconducting spintronics/orbitronics. We find that the superconducting 2D electron gas (2DEG) formed at EuOx/KTaO3 (110) interfaces, where the EuOx is magnetic, has a spin-texture with an unusual in-plane Ising like uniaxial anisotropy that is revealed in measurements of the in-plane critical field in the superconducting state, as well as from quantum corrections to the magnetoresistance in the normal state. This spin texture is not evident in AlOx/KTaO3 (110) where the overlayer is non-magnetic. Our results are consistent with a highly anisotropic spin-textured Fermi surface in 2DEGs formed at the KTaO3 (110) interface that is hidden from external magnetic fields due to a near cancellation between orbital and spin moments but revealed by exchange interactions of the electrons in the 2DEG with Eu moments near the EuOx/KTaO3 (110) interface. Our findings demonstrate that magnetic overlayers provide a unique probe of spin textures and related phenomena in heterostructures.

Title: Confined colloidal droplets dry to form circular mazes
Authors: Ilaria Beechey-Newman, Natalia Kizilova, Andreas Andersen Hennig, Eirik Grude Flekkøy, Erika Eiser
Abstract: During drying, particle-laden sessile droplets will leave so-called coffee-stain rings behind. This phenomenon is well-known and well-understood (Deegan et al., Nature {\bf 389},827-829 (1997)). Here we show that when particle-laden droplets confined in a slit are allowed to evaporate very slowly, they do not deposit coffee rings, but form a surprisingly intricate, circular maze-like pattern. We present experiments that illustrate this pattern formation and discuss the factors that determine when such patterns can form. We are not aware of reports of natural examples of the formation of such beautiful patterns under confinement, although it seems likely that they exist.

Title: Translational diffusion in supercooled water at and near the glass transition temperature -- 136 K
Authors: Greg A. Kimmel, Megan K. Dunlap, Kirill Gurdumov, R. Scott Smith, Bruce D. Kay
Abstract: The properties of amorphous solid water at and near the calorimetric glass transition temperature, $T_{g}$, of 136 K have been debated for years. One hypothesis is that water turns into a "true" liquid at $T_{g}$ (i.e., it becomes ergodic) and exhibits all the characteristics of an ergodic liquid, including translational diffusion. A competing hypothesis is that only rotational motion becomes active at $T_{g}$, while the "real" glass transition in water is at a considerably higher temperature. To address this dispute, we have investigated the diffusive mixing in nanoscale water films, with thicknesses up to ~100 nm, using infrared (IR) spectroscopy. The experiments used films that were composed of at least 90% $H_{2}O$ with $D_{2}O$ making up the balance and were conducted in conditions where H/D exchange was essentially eliminated. Because the IR spectra of multilayer $D_{2}O$ films (e.g., thicknesses of ~3 - 6 nm) embedded within thick $H_{2}O$ films are distinct from the spectrum of isolated $D_{2}O$ molecules within $H_{2}O$, the diffusive mixing of (initially) isotopically layered water films could be followed as a function of annealing time and temperature. The results show that water films with total thicknesses ranging from ~20 to 100 nm diffusively mixed prior to crystallization for temperatures between 120 and 144 K. The translational diffusion had an Arrhenius temperature dependence with an activation energy of 40.8 kJ/mol, which indicates that water at and near $T_{g}$ is a strong liquid. The measured diffusion coefficient at 136 K is 6.25 x 10$^{-21} m^{2}/s$.

Title: Atomistic insights into solid solution strengthening: size misfit versus stiffness misfit
Authors: Aoyan Liang, Nicolas Bertin, Xinran Zhou, Sylvie Aubry, Vasily V. Bulatov
Abstract: Used for centuries to enhance mechanical properties of materials, solid solution strengthening (SSS) is a classical metallurgical method in which small amounts of impurity elements are added to a base metal. Developed for dilute alloys, classical theories of SSS are presently challenged by the ongoing explosive development of complex concentrated alloys (CCA) in which all component elements are present in nearly equal fractions. Here we develop a method of computational alchemy in which interatomic interactions are modified to continuously and systematically vary two key parameters defining SSS, atomic size misfit and elastic stiffness misfit, over a maximally wide range of misfit values. The resulting model alloys are subjected to massive Molecular Dynamics simulations reproducing full complexity of plastic strength response in concentrated single-phase body-centered cubic solid solutions. At variance with views prevailing in the literature, our computational experiments show that stiffness misfit can contribute to SSS on par if not more than size misfit. Furthermore, depending on exactly how they are combined, the two misfits can result in synergistic or antagonistic effect on alloy strengthening. In contrast to real CCAs in which every constituent element comes with its specific combination of atomic size and elastic stiffness, our alchemical model alloys sample the space of misfit parameters continuously thus augmenting the much more constrained and inevitably spotty experimental exploration of the CCA design space. Taking advantage of unique to our approach ability to define alloy misfit parameters, our computational study demonstrates how useful insights can be gained from intentionally unrealistic alchemical models. Rather than practical recommendation for alloy design, our computational experiments should be regarded as a proving ground for further SSS theory development.

Title: Spectral Analysis of Representational Similarity with Limited Neurons
Authors: Hyunmo Kang, Abdulkadir Canatar, SueYeon Chung
Abstract: Measuring representational similarity between neural recordings and computational models is challenging due to constraints on the number of neurons that can be recorded simultaneously. In this work, we investigate how such limitations affect similarity measures, focusing on Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) and Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA). Leveraging tools from Random Matrix Theory, we develop a predictive spectral framework for these measures and demonstrate that finite neuron sampling systematically underestimates similarity due to eigenvector delocalization. To overcome this, we introduce a denoising method to infer population-level similarity, enabling accurate analysis even with small neuron samples. Our theory is validated on synthetic and real datasets, offering practical strategies for interpreting neural data under finite sampling constraints.

Title: First-Principles Framework for the Prediction of Intersystem Crossing Rates in Spin Defects: The Role of Electron Correlation
Authors: Yu Jin, Jinsoo Park, Marquis M. McMillan, Daniel Donghyon Ohm, Corrie Barnes, Benjamin Pingault, Christopher Egerstrom, Benchen Huang, Marco Govoni, F. Joseph Heremans, David D. Awschalom, Giulia Galli
Abstract: Optically active spin defects in solids are promising platforms for quantum technologies. Here, we present a first-principles framework to investigate intersystem crossing processes, which represent crucial steps in the optical spin-polarization cycle used to address spin defects. Considering the nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond as a case study, we demonstrate that our framework effectively captures electron correlation effects in the calculation of many-body electronic states and their spin-orbit coupling and electron-phonon interactions, while systematically addressing finite-size effects. We validate our predictions by carrying out measurements of fluorescence lifetimes, finding excellent agreement between theory and experiments. The framework presented here provides a versatile and robust tool for exploring the optical cycle of varied spin defects entirely from first principles.

Title: First-principles study on Pr-doped Bilayer Nickelate La3Ni2O7
Authors: Zihao Huo, Peng Zhang, Haoliang Shi, Xiaochun Yan, Defang Duan, Tian Cui
Abstract: Recently, the Pr-doped Ruddlesden-Popper phase of bilayer nickelate La3Ni2O7 has been reported to exhibit a superconducting transition temperature (Tc) of 82.5 K and superconducting volume fraction of about 57 % at high pressure. However, the effect of Pr-doping on La3Ni2O7 remains unclear. Here, we studied the crystal structures and electronic properties of Pr-doped La3Ni2O7 at 0 and 15 GPa based on the first-principles calculations to explore the doping effect of Pr. Our findings indicate that the praseodymium atoms prefer to occupy the outer La-O layers site. We then investigated the evolution of crystal structures in both the ambient pressure phase and high pressure phase of La3Ni2O7 as a function of doping concentration, revealing inconsistent trends in their evolution with increasing doping levels. Finally, by fitting the bilayer two-orbital model, we propose that doping Pr may benefit for superconductivity of La3Ni2O7. These results not only can help the further experimental search of RP phase nickelate at lower pressure, but also provide helpful guide for understanding the effect of chemical pressure in isovalent doped RP phase nickelate superconductor.

Title: Manipulation of topological phase transitions and the mechanism of magnetic interactions in Eu-based Zintl-phase materials
Authors: Bo-Xuan Li, Ziyin Song, Zhong Fang, Zhijun Wang, Hongming Weng
Abstract: Various topological phases, including topological insulators, topological semimetals, and topological superconductors, along with the controllable topological phase transitions, have attracted considerable attention due to their promising applications in spintronics and quantum computing. In this work, we propose two distinct methods for manipulating topological phase transitions in magnetic materials. First, by varying the strength of electron correlation effects, we induce a series of topological state transitions within the EuM$_2$X$_2$ (M = Zn, Cd; X = P, As, Sb) family of Zintl materials, including magnetic topological crystalline insulators (TCIs) and magnetic Dirac semimetals. Our findings indicate that strong electron correlation effects tend to influence the emergence of topological phases. Second, by reducing the electronegativity of the pnictogen X (from P to As and Sb), we observe a similar transition from trivial insulator to magnetic Dirac semimetal or magnetic TCI. This suggests that weaker electronegativity favors the emergence of topological phases. Furthermore, we establish a Heisenberg model to describe the magnetic interactions of the EuM$_2$X$_2$ system, based on which we perform Monte Carlo simulations of specific heat and magnetic susceptibility, yielding Néel temperatures that perfectly match experimental data. This suggests that the local magnetic moment framework provides an accurate description of the magnetization behavior in this family of materials. This work provides the potential for the experimental manipulation of topological phase transitions and their possible applications, while also enhancing the understanding of the magnetic interactions within the EuM$_2$X$_2$ system and offering a theoretical foundation for future applications in magnetism.

Title: Realizing stable zig-zag polymeric nitrogen chains in P-N compounds
Authors: Chengfeng zhang, Guo Chen, Yanfeng Zhang, Jie Zhang, Xianlong Wang
Abstract: The zig-zag Nitrogen (N) chain similar to the Ch-N structure has long been considered a potential high energy density structure. However, all previously predicted zig-zag N chain structures similar to Ch-N exhibit imaginary frequencies in their phonon spectra at 0 GPa. Here, we conducted a systematic investigation of P-N compounds using first-principles calculations, uncovering a series of structurally similar stable phases, C2/m-PNx (x = 6, 8, 10, 12, 14), in which N forms zig-zag N chains similar to those in Ch-N. In P-N compounds, the longest zig-zag N chain that can theoretically remain stable under ambient pressure is the N chain composed of 14 N atoms in C2/m-PN14. If the N chain continues to grow, inter-chain vibrational imaginary frequencies will arise in the system. Notably, N chains with an even number of atoms are more likely to be energetically favorable. The five C2/m-PNx phases and one metastable phase (R-PN6) exhibit both remarkable stability and excellent detonability at ambient pressure, positioning them as promising candidates for high-energy-density materials. In addition, the R-PN6 is the first structure to stabilize the N6 ring through covalent bonding, with the covalent network contributing to its high hardness (47.59 GPa).

Title: Extracting intrinsic superconducting properties in intercalated layered superconductors using an extended 2D Tinkham model
Authors: Yue Liu, Yuhang Zhang, Zouyouwei Lu, Dong Li, Yuki M. Itahashi, Zhanyi Zhao, Jiali Liu, Jihu Lu, Feng Wu, Kui Jin, Hua Zhang, Ziyi Liu, Xiaoli Dong, Zhongxian Zhao
Abstract: Bulk two dimensional (2D) superconductivity has gained considerable attention due to its intricate interplay between symmetry breaking, nontrivial topology, 2D phase fluctuations, and unconventional superconductivity. However, certain intercalated layered superconductors, despite their short c-axis superconducting coherence length, have been misclassified as anisotropic three-dimensional (3D) superconductors. Here, we investigate (Li,Fe)OHFeSe superconductors with varying degrees of interlayer misalignment, revealing sample-dependent superconducting dimensionality while consistently observing Berezinskii Kosterlitz Thouless (BKT) transitions. To resolve this discrepancy, we develop an extended 2D Tinkham model that quantitatively captures the blurring effects induced by interlayer misalignment. We further demonstrate the validity of this model in both (Li,Fe)OHFeSe and cetyltrimethyl ammonium (CTA+) intercalated (CTA)0.5SnSe2 superconductors, highlighting its broad applicability. This work provides valuable insights into bulk 2D superconductivity and establishes an extended 2D Tinkham model for quantitatively extracting intrinsic superconducting properties in intercalated layered superconductors, particularly those exhibiting significant interlayer misalignments.

Title: Gate-Tunable Spin-to-Charge Conversion in Topological Insulator-Magnetic Insulator Heterostructures at Room Temperature
Authors: Wenxuan Sun, Yequan Chen, Ruijie Xu, Wenzhuo Zhuang, Di Wang, Long Liu, Anke Song, Guozhong Xing, Yongbing Xu, Rong Zhang, Cui-Zu Chang, Xuefeng Wang
Abstract: Over the past decade, topological insulators have received enormous attention for their potential in energy-efficient spin-to-charge conversion, enabled by strong spin-orbit coupling and spin-momentum locked surface states. Despite extensive research, the spin-to-charge conversion efficiency, usually characterized by the spin Hall angle ({\theta}SH), remains low at room temperature. In this work, we employed pulsed laser deposition to synthesize high-quality ternary topological insulators (Bi0.1Sb0.9)2Te3 thin films on magnetic insulator Y3Fe5O12. We find that the value of {\theta}SH reaches ~0.76 at room temperature and increases to ~0.9 as the Fermi level is tuned to cross topological surface states via electrical gating. Our findings provide an innovative approach to tailoring the spin-to-charge conversion in topological insulators and pave the way for their applications in energy-efficient spintronic devices.

Title: Ferroelectric Chirality-Driven Direction-Tunable and Spin-Invertible Corner States in 2D MOF-Based Magnetic Second-Order Topological Insulators
Authors: Jialin Gong, Wei Sun, Yang Wu, Zhenzhou Guo, Shifeng Qian, Xiaotian Wang, Gang Zhang
Abstract: Despite the rapid progress in predicting 2D magnetic second-order topological insulators (SOTIs), effective strategies for manipulating their spin-polarized corner states remain largely unexplored. The interplay between ferroelectricity, chirality, magnetism, and topology presents an untapped opportunity for controlling these corner states. Here, we propose a novel approach for tuning spin-polarized corner states in 2D magnetic SOTIs by inducing ferroelectric chirality in 2D metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with intrinsic structural flexibility. Through symmetry analysis, we strategically replace pyrazine (pyz) ligands with 2-pyrazinolate (2-pyzol) ligands in the 2D MOF Cr(pyz)2, leading to the emergence of a new 2D magnetic SOTI, Cr(2-pyzol)2, which facilitates ferroelectric chirality controlled spin-polarized corner states in both spin channels. Through first-principle calculations, we demonstrate that Cr(2-pyzol)2 belongs to ferroelectric chiral systems, and its corner states can be directionally tuned in real space and spin-inverted in spin space upon ferroelectric chirality switching. Our work represents the first attempt to simultaneously manipulate corner states in both real space and spin space, offering a new strategy for integrating ferroelectric chirality into 2D MOF-based magnetic SOTIs.

Title: Machine-Learning Force Fields Reveal Shallow Electronic States on Dynamic Halide Perovskite Surfaces
Authors: Frederico P. Delgado, Frederico Simões, Leeor Kronik, Waldemar Kaiser, David A. Egger
Abstract: The spectacular performance of halide perovskites in optoelectronic devices is rooted in their favorable tolerance to structural defects. Previous studies showed that defects in these materials generate shallow electronic states that do not degrade device performance. However, how these shallow states persist amid the pronounced thermally-stimulated atomic dynamics on halide perovskite surfaces remains unknown. This work reveals that electronic states at surfaces of the prototypical CsPbBr$_3$ variant are energetically distributed at room temperature, akin to well-passivated inorganic semiconductors, even when covalent bonds remain cleaved and undercoordinated. Specifically, a striking tendency for shallow surface states is found with approximately 70% of surface-state energies appearing within 0.2 eV or ${\approx}8k_\text{B}T$ from the valence-band edge. Furthermore, we show that even when surface states appear deeper in the gap, they are not energetically isolated and are less likely to act as traps. We achieve this result by accelerating first-principles calculations via machine-learning techniques and show that the unique atomic dynamics in these materials render the formation of deep electronic states at their surfaces unlikely. These findings reveal the microscopic mechanism behind the low density of deep defect states at dynamic halide perovskite surfaces, which is key to their exceptional performance in devices.

Title: Hysteretic responses of nanomechanical resonators based on crumpled few-layer graphene
Authors: Heng Lu, Chen Yang, Ce Zhang, YuBin Zhang, FengNan Chen, Yue Ying, Zhuo-Zhi Zhang, Xiang-Xiang Song, Guang-Wei Deng, Ying Yan, Joel Moser
Abstract: Manipulating two-dimensional materials occasionally results in crumpled membranes. Their complicated morphologies feature an abundance of folds, creases and wrinkles that make each crumpled membrane unique. Here, we prepare four nanomechanical resonators based on crumpled membranes of few-layer graphene and measure their static response and the spectrum of their dynamic response. We tune both responses with a dc voltage applied between the membrane and an underlying gate electrode. Surprisingly, we find that all four resonators exhibit hysteretic responses as the gate voltage is increased and then decreased. Concomitant discontinuities in the static response and in the vibrational resonant frequencies indicate a sudden change in the shape and in the tensile strain of the membranes. We also find that the hystereses can be removed and regular responses can be restored by annealing the resonators. We hypothesize that the hysteretic nature of the responses may originate from an interplay between the rugged morphology of the membranes and adsorbates trapped within the confine of the folds.

Title: Elongated vortex quantum droplets in binary Bose-Einstein condensates
Authors: Guilong Li, Zibin Zhao, Rui Zhang, Zhaopin Chen, Bin Liu, Boris A. Malomed, Yongyao Li
Abstract: Stability of elongated (``slender") quantum droplets (QDs) with embedded unitary and multiple vorticity is a problem that was not solved previously. In this work, we propose a solution which relies upon the use of the spatial modulation of the inter-species scattering length in the binary Bose-Einstein condensate, in the form of a two-dimensional axisymmetric Gaussian, shaped by means of the optical Feshbach resonance. The corresponding effective nonlinear trapping potential supports completely stable elongated QDs with vorticity $S=0$ and partly stable families of elongated QDs with $S=1,2,3,4$ (other nonlinear systems do not maintain stability of vortex droplets with $\geq 2$). We systematically analyze effects of the amplitude and width of the Gaussian modulation, as well as the total number of atoms, on the shape and stability of the QDs, some effects being explained analytically. Collisions between identical QDs with $S=1$ moving in opposite directions along the central axis leads to their merger into still more elongated breathing QDs with the same vorticity, while collisions between QDs with $S=\pm 1$ are quasi-elastic. Moving modulation profiles are able to adiabatically rotate the trapped elongated QDs. Application of a torque to the vector QD sets in the gyroscopic regime of robust precession, which realizes a macroscopic spin-orbit-coupling effect.

Title: Spontaneous magnon decay in two-dimensional altermagnets
Authors: Niklas Cichutek, Peter Kopietz, Andreas Rückriegel
Abstract: We show that magnons in two-dimensional altermagnets can spontaneously decay at zero temperature. The decay rate is determined by quantum fluctuations and scattering processes involving the decay of a single magnon into three. These processes are kinematically allowed due to the convexity of the altermagnetic magnon dispersion. For small wavevectors $k$ the decay rate is proportional to $k^5$ with a direction-dependent prefactor which is maximal along the diagonals of the Brillouin zone. Moreover, for a given momentum only magnons with one specific chirality can spontaneously decay.

Title: Phonon anomalies within the polar charge density wave phase of superconductor Mo$_3$Al$_2$C with structural chirality
Authors: Shangfei Wu, Xianghan Xu, Fei-Ting Huang, Turan Birol, Sang-Wook Cheong, Girsh Blumberg
Abstract: We employ polarization-resolved Raman spectroscopy to study the lattice dynamics of the polar charge density wave phase of the superconductor Mo$_3$Al$_2$C with structural chirality. We show the phononic signatures of the charge density wave transition at $T^*$=155K in Mo$_3$Al$_2$C. The detailed temperature dependence of these phonon modes' frequency, half-width-at-half-maximum, and the integrated area below $T^*$ reveal anomalies at an intermediate temperature $T'\sim$100K, especially for the low-energy modes at 130cm$^{-1}$ and 180cm$^{-1}$. Since these low-energy modes are dominated by Mo-related lattice vibration, we propose that lattice anomalies at $T'$ within the charge density wave phase are related to a modification of the Mo displacements while preserving the crystal symmetry.

Title: Robust $s_\pm$-wave pairing in a bilayer two-orbital model of pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ without the $γ$ Fermi surface
Authors: Yi Gao
Abstract: We studied the superconducting pairing symmetry based on a newly constructed tight-binding model of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure, where the $\gamma$ band sinks below the Fermi level and does not form the Fermi surface. The superconducting pairing symmetry is $s_\pm$-wave and is robust against the variation of the interaction strength. In this model, although the $\gamma$ and $\delta$ bands are away from the Fermi level, the superconducting pairing function on them is not tiny. Instead, since the top of the $\gamma$ band and bottom of the $\delta$ band are both located at $\sim$500 meV away from the Fermi level, and they are almost nested by the peak structure in the spin fluctuation, thus by forming an anti-phase pairing function on them, these two bands act constructively to superconductivity. Finally with detailed derivation and numerical calculation, we demonstrate that the Fermi surface approximated Eliashberg equation may lead to deviation of the pairing symmetry.

Title: Detecting Topological Phase Transition in Superconductor-Semiconductor Hybrids by Electronic Raman Spectroscopy
Authors: Takeshi Mizushima, Yukio Tanaka, Jorge Cayao
Abstract: In superconductor-semiconductor hybrids, applying a magnetic field closes a trivial bulk gap and causes a topological phase transition (TPT), resulting in the emergence of Majorana zero modes at both ends of the wires. However, trivial Andreev bound states formed at the interface with metallic leads mimic the local Majorana properties, making it difficult to detect the TPT through local conductance measurements. In this work, we investigate the detection of the bulk TPT by exploiting the static and dynamic density response of the hybrid system. In particular, we demonstrate that the dynamical renormalized responses reveal the characteristic electronic structure and detect the TPT, which we then show to produce strong intensities of Raman scattering. Furthermore, we find that gapless plasmons emerge in the normal state, signaling the bulk Lifshitz transition. Our results thus predict that the bulk response of superconducting nanowires is a powerful spectroscopic approach to detect the bulk topological phase transition.

Title: Dynamics of a Bottom-Heavy Janus Particle Near a Wall Under Shear Flow
Authors: Zohreh Jalilvand, Daniele Notarmuzi, Ubaldo M. Córdova-Figueroa, Emanuela Bianchi, Ilona Kretzschmar
Abstract: In this study, Brownian Dynamics simulations are implemented to investigate the motion of a bottom-heavy Janus particle near a wall under varying shear flow conditions and at small Péclet (Pe) numbers. The stochastic motion of the Janus particle impacted by surface forces is described using a set of coupled Langevin equations that takes into account the Janus particle orientation. Interactions arising from surface potentials are found to depend on the separation distance between the Janus particle and the wall, the properties of the surfaces involved, and the thickness of the Janus particle cap. When shear flow is introduced in the system, the dynamical behavior of the Janus particle is also governed by the strain rate. Furthermore, the effect of friction on the dynamical behavior of the Janus particle under shear flow is investigated and reveals that the rotational motion of the Janus particle slows down slightly when the particle is close to the surface. In summary, we demonstrate the ability to utilize Brownian Dynamics simulations to capture the rich dynamical behavior of a bottom-heavy Janus particle near a wall and under a range of shear flow conditions, cap thicknesses, and surface charges.

Title: Topological phase transitions in superconductors with chiral symmetry
Authors: Kristian Løvås Svalland, Maria Teresa Mercaldo, Mario Cuoco
Abstract: We study topological transitions in one dimensional superconductors that can harbor multiple edge Majorana bound states protected by chiral symmetry. The chiral symmetry arises due to the structure of the internal spin degrees of freedom of the superconductor and it can be guided by the coupling of the superconductor with sources of time-reversal symmetry breaking. We then consider distinct regions of the phase diagram in the parameters space that are marked by gapless excitations in the spectrum and evaluate the conditions for inducing a topological transition. We show that for gapless chiral symmetric superconductors one can identify a class of physical perturbations that enable a gap opening in the spectrum, without breaking chirality, and turn the system into a topological state. This type of superconductor is dubbed marginal topological superconductor because an infinitesimally small perturbation is able to induce a transition into a topological nontrivial phase. To explicitly demonstrate and evaluate the character of the transitions from gapless to topological gapfull phases we explore different physical cases including $p$-wave superconductor in the presence of an applied magnetic field or proximity-coupled to a ferromagnet, and $s$-wave superconductor in a noncollinear magnetic ordering.

Title: Improvement of Morphology and Electrical Properties of Boron-doped Diamond Films via Seeding with HPHT Nanodiamonds Synthesized from 9-Borabicyclononane
Authors: Stepan Stehlik, Stepan Potocky, Katerina Aubrechtova Dragounova, Petr Belsky, Rostislav Medlin, Andrej Vincze, Evgeny A. Ekimov, Alexander Kromka
Abstract: Boron-doped diamond (BDD) films are becoming increasingly popular as electrode materials due to their broad potential window and stability in harsh conditions and environments. Therefore, optimizing the crystal quality and minimizing defect density to maximize electronic properties (e.g. conductivity) of BDD is of great importance. This study investigates the influence of different hydrogenated nanodiamond (H-ND) seeding layers on the growth and properties of BDD films. Three types of seeding H-NDs were examined: detonation (H-DND) and top-down high-pressure high-temperature NDs (TD_HPHT H-ND), and boron-doped NDs (H-BND) newly synthesized at high-pressure high-temperature from an organic precursor. Purified and oxidized BND (O-BND) samples yielded clear, blue, and stable colloidal dispersions. Subsequent thermal hydrogenation reversed their zeta potential from - 32 mV to + 44 mV and promoted the seeding of negatively charged surfaces. All three H-ND types formed dense seeding layers on SiO2 and Si/SiOx substrates, which enabled the growth of BDD films by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Despite variations in initial surface coverage among the seeding layers (13-25%), all NDs facilitated the growth of fully closed BDD films approximately 1 {\mu}m thick. Significant differences in film morphology and electrical properties were observed. H-BND nucleation yielded the BDD films with the largest crystals (up to 1 000 nm) and lowest sheet resistance (400 ohm/sq). This superior performance is attributed to the uniform particle shape and monocrystalline character of H-BND, as corroborated by FTIR, TEM, and SAXS measurements. These findings highlight the critical role of seeding layer properties in determining consequent diamond film evolution and establish H-BNDs as promising seeding material for the growth of high-quality BDD films suitable for electronic and electrochemical applications.

Title: Colossal Dielectric Response and Electric Polarization in Lithium Nitrate
Authors: Na Du, Yan Zhao, Enting Xu, Jianwei Han, Peng Ren, Fei Yen
Abstract: Materials with record-breaking properties are interesting as they can redefine existing models. Lithium nitrate LiNO$_3$ is identified to possess a dielectric constant $\epsilon$' larger than 6x10$^6$ at 1 kHz in powdered samples above the critical temperature $T$$_W$ = 306 K. When cooling back from $T$$_W$, if the temperature remains above 275 K, $\epsilon$' can be sustained above 10$^4$ and the dissipation factor below 10$^2$. Moreover, pyroelectric current measurements show LiNO$_3$ to be ferroelectric with an electric polarization of $P$ = 1,200 $\mu$C/cm$^2$. Both $\epsilon$' and $P$ are the highest amongst all known materials. We suggest the mechanism underlying the colossal magnitudes of $\epsilon$' and $P$ to stem from a gearing-ungearing process of the planar NO$_3$$^-$ at the macroscopic level. Our results potentially push the boundaries of ceramic capacitors.

Title: Effect of a uniaxial strain on optical spin orientation in cubic semiconductors
Authors: T. Amand, D. Paget
Abstract: The effect of a uniaxial strain on the optical spin orientation of a cubic semiconductor is investigated by calculating the valence wavefunctions, the optical oscillator strengths and the initial electron spin polarization for near resonant light excitation from heavy and light valence levels. A strain orientation along the [001], [111] or [-110] crystal direction and a circularly-polarized light excitation parallel or perpendicular to the strain are considered. For all these cases, the total conduction electron spin polarization has a universal character since i) the oscillator strengths do not depend on the magnitude of the strain but only on its sign. ii) Although the oscillator strengths strongly depend on the configuration, the conduction electron spin polarization generated by optical transitions from both the heavy and light valence levels induced by sigma + light excitation is in all cases equal to -0.5 as predicted by the simple atomic model. iii) The spin polarization generated by light excitation from heavy and light valence levels does not depend on the deformation tensor and on the valence deformation potential, except for a strain along [-110].

Abstract: Altermagnetism defies conventional classifications of collinear magnetic phases, standing apart from ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism with its unique combination of spin-dependent symmetries, net-zero magnetization, and anomalous Hall transport. Although altermagnetic states have been realized experimentally, their integration into functional devices has been hindered by the structural rigidity and poor tunability of existing materials. First, through cobalt intercalation of the superconducting 2H-NbSe$_2$ polymorph, we induce and stabilize a robust altermagnetic phase and using both theory and experiment, we directly observe the lifting of Kramers degeneracy. Then, using ultrafast laser pulses, we demonstrate how the low temperature phase of this system can be quenched, realizing the first example of an optical altermagnetic switch. While shedding light on overlooked aspects of altermagnetism, our findings open pathways to spin-based technologies and lay a foundation for advancing the emerging field of altertronics.

Title: Transmission through multiple Mott insulator - semiconductor wells
Authors: Jan Verlage, Peter Kratzer
Abstract: Weakly and strongly interacting quantum many-body systems, namely semiconductors and Mott insulators, are combined into a layered heterostructure. Via the hierarchy of correlations, we derive and match the propagating quasi-particle solutions in the different regions and calculate the transmission coefficients through these layered structures. As a proof of principle, we find the well known transmission bands of a semiconductor heterostructure. Extending this idea to semiconductor and Mott insulator structures we calculate the transmittance and the resonance energies. Within a phase accumulation model we find analytical expressions for the scattering phase shift. Lastly, we find transmission curves with skewness for structures with applied voltage.

Title: Computational Characterization of the Recently Synthesized Pristine and Porous 12-Atom-Wide Armchair Graphene Nanoribbon
Authors: Djardiel da S. Gomes, Isaac M. Felix, Willian F. Radel, Alexandre C. Dias, Luiz A. Ribeiro Junior, Marcelo L. Pereira Junior
Abstract: Recently synthesized Porous 12-Atom-Wide Armchair Graphene Nanoribbons Nano Lett. 2024, 24, 10718-10723 exhibit tunable properties through periodic porosity, enabling precise control over their electronic, optical, thermal, and mechanical behavior. This work presents a comprehensive theoretical characterization of pristine and porous 12-AGNRs based on density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. DFT calculations reveal substantial electronic modifications, including band gap widening and the emergence of localized states. Analyzed within the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) framework, optical properties highlight strong excitonic effects and significant absorption shifts. Thermal transport simulations indicate a pronounced reduction in conductivity due to enhanced phonon scattering at nanopores. At the same time, MD-based mechanical analysis shows decreased stiffness and strength while maintaining structural integrity. Despite these modifications, porous 12-AGNRs remain mechanically and thermally stable. These findings establish porosity engineering as a powerful strategy for tailoring graphene nanoribbons' functional properties, reinforcing their potential for nanoelectronic, optoelectronic, and thermal management applications.

Title: Harnessing Layer-Controlled Two-dimensional Semiconductors for Photoelectrochemical Energy Storage via Quantum Capacitance and Band Nesting
Authors: Praveen Kumar, Tushar Waghmare, Sudhir Kumar, Rajdeep Banerjee, Suman Kumar Chakraborty, Subrata Ghosh, Dipak Kumar Goswami, Sankha Mukherjee, Debabrata Pradhan, Prasana Kumar Sahoo
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides like molybdenum diselenide (MoSe$_2$) have shown great potential in optoelectronics and energy storage due to their layer-dependent bandgap. However, producing high-quality 2D MoSe$_2$ layers in a scalable and controlled manner remains challenging. Traditional methods, such as hydrothermal and liquid-phase exfoliation, lack precision and understanding at the nanoscale, limiting further applications. Atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition (APCVD) offers a scalable solution for growing high-quality, large-area, layer-controlled 2D MoSe$_2$. Despite this, the photoelectrochemical performance of APCVD-grown 2D MoSe$_2$, particularly in energy storage, has not been extensively explored. This study addresses this by examining MoSe$_2$'s layer-dependent quantum capacitance and photo-induced charge storage properties. Using a three-electrode setup in 0.5M H$_2$SO$_4$, we observed a layer-dependent increase in areal capacitance under both dark and illuminated conditions. A six-layer MoSe$_2$ film exhibited the highest capacitance, reaching $96 \mu\mathrm{F/cm^2}$ in the dark and $115 \mu\mathrm{F/cm^2}$ under illumination at a current density of $5 \mu\mathrm{A/cm^2}$. Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Many-Body Perturbation Theory calculations reveal that Van Hove singularities and band nesting significantly enhance optical absorption and quantum capacitance. These results highlight APCVD-grown 2D MoSe$_2$'s potential as light-responsive, high-performance energy storage electrodes, paving the way for innovative energy storage systems.

Title: Simulating Bulk Gap in Chiral Projected Entangled-Pair States
Authors: Ji-Yao Chen, Yi Tan, Sylvain Capponi, Didier Poilblanc, Fei Ye, Jia-Wei Mei
Abstract: Projected entangled-pair states (PEPS) have proven effective in capturing chiral spin liquid ground states, yet the presence of long-range ``gossamer'' correlation tails raises concerns about their ability to accurately describe bulk gaps. Here, we address this challenge and demonstrate that PEPS can reliably characterize gapped bulk excitations in chiral topological phases. Using a variational principle for excited states within a local mode approximation, we establish that correlation functions decaying faster than $r^{-2}$ are not necessarily related to gapless modes and thus long-range ``gossamer'' correlation tails in chiral PEPS do not contradict the presence of a bulk gap. This framework is validated in the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Kitaev model with a chiral term, where PEPS yields excitation gaps that agree well with exact solutions. Extending our approach to the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ Kitaev model, we present compelling evidence for its chiral ground state and accurately resolve its gapped excitations. These findings thus solidify PEPS as a powerful tool for studying both ground and excited states in chiral topological systems, thereby bridging a key gap in the understanding of their bulk properties.

Title: Spontaneous Magnon Decays from Nonrelativistic Time-Reversal Symmetry Breaking in Altermagnets
Authors: Rintaro Eto, Matthias Gohlke, Jairo Sinova, Masahito Mochizuki, Alexander L. Chernyshev, Alexander Mook
Abstract: Quasiparticles are central to condensed matter physics, but their stability can be undermined by quantum many-body interactions. Magnons, quasiparticles in quantum magnets, are particularly intriguing because their properties are governed by both real and spin space. While crystal symmetries may be low, spin interactions often remain approximately isotropic, limiting spontaneous magnon decay. Textbook wisdom holds that collinear Heisenberg magnets follow a dichotomy: ferromagnets host stable magnons, while antiferromagnetic magnons may decay depending on dispersion curvature. Up to now, relativistic spin-orbit coupling and noncollinear order that connect spin space to real space, were shown to introduce more complex magnon instability mechanisms. Here, we show that even in nonrelativistic isotropic collinear systems, this conventional dichotomy is disrupted in altermagnets. Altermagnets, a newly identified class of collinear magnets, exhibit compensated spin order with nonrelativistic time-reversal symmetry breaking and even-parity band splitting. Using kinematic analysis, nonlinear spin-wave theory, and quantum simulations, we reveal that even weak band splitting opens a decay phase space, driving quasiparticle breakdown. Additionally, d-wave altermagnets form a rare ``island of stability'' at the Brillouin zone center. Our findings establish a quasiparticle stability trichotomy in collinear Heisenberg magnets and position altermagnets as a promising platform for unconventional spin dynamics.

Title: Geometry and Mechanics of Non-Euclidean Curved-Crease Origami
Authors: Zhixuan Wen, Tian Yu, Fan Feng
Abstract: Recently there have been extensive theoretical, numerical and experimental works on curved-fold origami. However, we notice that a unified and complete geometric framework for describing the geometry and mechanics of curved-fold origami, especially those with nontrivial Gaussian curvature at the crease (non-Euclidean crease), is still absent. Herein we provide a unified geometric framework that describes the shape of a generic curved-fold origami composed of two general strips. The explicit description indicates that four configurations emerge, determined by its spatial crease and configuration branch. Within this geometric framework, we derive the equilibrium equations and study the mechanical response of the curved-crease origami, focusing on Euler's buckling behavior. Both linear stability analysis and finite element simulation indicate that the overlaid configuration exhibits a lower buckling threshold. To further capture the large deformation behavior efficiently, we develop a bistrip model based on the anisotropic Kirchhoff rod theory, which predicts the main features successfully. This work bridges the geometry and mechanics of curved-crease origami, offering insights for applications in robotics, actuators, and deployable space structures.

Title: Strong-damping limit of quantum Brownian motion in a disordered environment
Authors: Arthur M. Faria, Marcus V. S. Bonanca, Eric Lutz
Abstract: We consider a microscopic model of an inhomogeneous environment where an arbitrary quantum system is locally coupled to a harmonic bath via a finite-range interaction. We show that in the overdamped regime the position distribution obeys a classical Kramers-Moyal equation that involves an infinite number of higher derivatives, implying that the finite bath correlation length leads to non-Gaussian Markovian noise. We analytically solve the equation for a harmonically bound particle and analyze its non-Gaussian diffusion as well as its steady-state properties.

Title: Nonequilibrium fluctuation relations for non-Gaussian processes
Authors: Arthur M. Faria, Marcus V. S. Bonanca, Eric Lutz
Abstract: Non-Gaussian noise is omnipresent in systems where the central-limit theorem is inapplicable. We here investigate the stochastic thermodynamics of small systems that are described by a general Kramers-Moyal equation that includes both Gaussian and non-Gaussian white noise contributions. We obtain detailed and integral fluctuation relations for the nonequilibrium entropy production of these Markov processes in the regime of weak noise. As an application, we analyze the properties of driven objects that are locally coupled to a heat bath via a finite-range interaction, by considering an overdamped particle that is pulled by a moving harmonic potential. We find that reducing the bath interaction range increases non-Gaussian features, and strongly suppresses the average nonequilibrium entropy production. We further discuss a generalized detailed-balance condition.

Authors: Julian Koch, Sergii Sologub, Dorothee Sylvia Boesler, Chitran Ghosal, Teresa Tschirner, Klaus Pierz, Hans Werner Schumacher, Christoph Tegenkamp
Abstract: Proximity coupling is an effective approach for the functionalization of graphene. However, graphene's inertness inhibits the adsorption of closed films, thus favoring island growth, whose inhomogeneity might be reflected in the induced properties. In order to study the homogeneity of the doping profile induced by an inhomogeneous coverage and the spin orbit coupling (SOC) induced in graphene, we deposited Pb(111) islands with an average coverage of up to 30 ML on monolayer graphene (MLG) on SiC(0001) at room temperature (RT). We investigated the transport properties and the structure using magnetotransport, and scanning tunneling microscopy and low energy electron deflection, respectively. The Pb(111) islands act as donors, increasing the electron concentration of graphene by about $5\times10^{11}\;\text{ML}^{-1}\text{cm}^{-2}$. The doping was found to be homogeneous, in stark contrast to our previous results for Bi islands on MLG. Upon percolation of the Pb layer at around 5 ML, hole transport through the Pb islands has to be taken into account in order to describe the transport data. The Pb(111) islands do not induce any Rashba SOC, contrary to theoretical predictions for an interface between Pb(111) and graphene. Moreover, they seem to screen the defects in the graphene, resulting in a reduction of the intervalley scattering rate up to 5 ML.

Title: Processing-dependent Chemical Ordering in a Metallic Alloy Characterized via Non-destructive Bragg Coherent Diffraction Imaging
Authors: Nathaniel Warren, Chloe Skidmore, Katherine J. Harmon, Wonsuk Cha, Jon-Paul Maria, Stephan O. Hruszkewycz, Darren C. Pagan
Abstract: Of current importance for alloy design is controlling chemical ordering through processing routes to optimize an alloy's mechanical properties for a desired application. However, characterization of chemical ordering remains an ongoing challenge, particularly when nondestructive characterization is needed. In this study, Bragg coherent diffraction imaging is used to reconstruct morphology and lattice displacement in model Cu$_3$Au nanocrystals that have undergone different heat treatments to produce variation in chemical ordering. The magnitudes and distributions of the scattering amplitudes (proportional to electron density) and lattice strains within these crystals are then analyzed to correlate them to the expected amount of chemical ordering present. Nanocrystals with increased amounts of ordering are found to generally have less extreme strains present and reduced strain distribution widths. In addition, statistical correlations are found between the spatial arrangement of scattering amplitude and lattice strains.

Title: Environment-friendly technologies with lead-free piezoelectric materials: A review of recent developments, applications, and modelling approaches
Authors: Akshayveer Akshayveer, Federico C Buroni, Roderick Melnik, Luis Rodriguez-Tembleque, Andres Saez
Abstract: Piezoelectric materials are widely used in several industries, including power sources, energy harvesting, biomedical, electronics, haptic, photostrictive, and sensor/actuator technologies. Conventional piezoelectric materials, such lead zirconate titanate (PZT), pose significant environmental and health risks due to lead content. Recent years have seen a growing need for eco-friendly alternatives to lead-based piezoelectric technologies. The drawback of lead-free piezoelectric materials is a reduced responsiveness. To enhance the performance of lead-free piezoelectric materials, substantial research is being undertaken using both experimental and numerical methods. The experimental studies provide a deep understanding of the process and are crucial for developing lead-free piezoelectric materials. Relying only on experimental research is not feasible due to high expenditures. To understand the piezoelectric properties of lead-free materials and enhance their efficiency, it is crucial to develop varied numerical models and computational methods. This paper is a comprehensive summary of lead-free piezoelectric technology breakthroughs. The study emphasizes numerical models that demonstrate enhanced piezoelectric behaviour and their use in eco-friendly technologies like energy harvesting, haptics, nano-electromechanical, photostrictive, and biomedical sensors and actuators using lead-free materials. The paper discusses the synthesis, properties, and applications of eco-friendly materials, highlighting their potential to revolutionize piezoelectric devices and promote sustainable development and conservation.

Title: Carrier Localization and Spontaneous Formation of Two-Dimensional Polarization Domain in Halide Perovskites
Authors: Andrew Grieder, Marcos Calegari Andrade, Hiroyuki Takenaka, Tadashi Ogitsu, Liang Z. Tan, Yuan Ping
Abstract: Halide perovskites are known for their rich phase diagram and superior performance in diverse optoelectronics applications. The latter property is often attributed to the long electron-hole recombination time, whose underlying physical mechanism has been a long-standing controversy. In this work, we investigate the transport and localization properties of electron and hole carriers in a prototypical halide perovskite (CsPbBr3), through ab initio tight-binding non-adiabatic dynamics approach for large-scale (tens of nm size) supercell calculations. We found distinct structural, lattice polarization, and electron-phonon coupling properties at low (below 100 K) and high temperatures, consistent with experimental observations. In particular, at low temperature we find spontaneous formation of polar grain-boundaries in the nonpolar bulk systems, which result in two dimensional polarization patterns that serve to localize and separate electrons and holes. We reveal phonon-assisted variable-range hopping mostly responsible for low-temperature transport, and their characteristic frequency correlates with temperature-dependent phonon power spectrum and energy oscillation frequency in nonadiabatic dynamics. We answer the critical questions of long electron-hole recombination lifetime and offer the correlation among polarization domains, electron-phonon couplings, and photocarrier dynamics.

Title: Chaotic quantum transport through spatially symmetric microstructures in the symplectic ensemble
Authors: Felipe Castañeda-Ramírez, Moisés Martínez-Mares
Abstract: Quantum transport through left-right symmetric chaotic cavities in the presence of the symplectic symmetry, is studied through the statistical distribution of the dimensionless conductance. With this particular point symmetry, their associated scattering matrices are blocky diagonalized by a rotation by an angle of $\pi/4$. Although the formulation is established for an arbitrary number channels N, we present explicit calculations for N=1 and N=2, the last one showing the weak anti-localization phenomenon due to the symplectic symmetry.

Title: Search for magnetic field expulsion in optically driven K$_3$C$_{60}$
Authors: G. De Vecchi, M. Buzzi, G. Jotzu, S. Fava, T. Gebert, G. Magnani, D. Pontiroli, M. Riccò, A. Cavalleri
Abstract: Photoexcited K$_3$C$_{60}$ displays several properties reminiscent of equilibrium superconductivity, including transient optical spectra, pressure dependence, and I-V characteristics. However, these observations do not decisively establish non-equilibrium superconductivity, which would be conclusively evidenced by transient Meissner diamagnetism, as shown recently in driven YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6.48}$. Here, we search for transient magnetic field expulsion in K$_3$C$_{60}$ by measuring Faraday rotation in a magneto-optic material placed in its vicinity. Unlike in the case of homogeneous, insulating YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6.48}$, inhomogeneous, metallic K$_3$C$_{60}$ powders reduce the size of the effect. With the $\sim50$ nT magnetic field resolution achieved in our experiments, we provide an upper limit for the photo-induced diamagnetic volume susceptibility ($\chi_v>-0.1$). On this basis, we conclude that the photo-induced phase has weaker diamagnetism than superconducting K$_3$C$_{60}$ at zero temperature. Yet, from recent nonlinear transport measurements in this granular material, we expect a light-induced state similar to the equilibrium superconductor near 0.8 T$_c$, for which $\chi_v>-0.1$. A definitive conclusion on the presence or absence of Meissner diamagnetism cannot be made for K$_3$C$_{60}$ with the current resolution.

Title: Topological altermagnetic Josephson junctions
Authors: Grant Z. X. Yang, Zi-Ting Sun, Ying-Ming Xie, K. T. Law
Abstract: Planar Josephson junctions are pivotal for engineering topological superconductivity, yet are severely hindered by orbital effects induced by in-plane magnetic fields. In this work, we introduce the generic topological altermagnetic Josephson junctions (TAJJs) by leveraging the intrinsic spin-polarized band splitting and zero net magnetization attributes of altermagnets. Our proposed TAJJs effectively mitigate the detrimental orbital effects while robustly hosting Majorana end modes (MEMs) at both ends of the junction. Specifically, we demonstrate that MEMs emerge in $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave TAJJs but vanish in the $d_{xy}$-wave configuration, thereby establishing the crystallographic orientation angle $\theta$ of the altermagnet as a novel control parameter of topology. The distinct spin-polarization of the MEMs provides an unambiguous experimental signature for the spin-resolved measurement. Furthermore, by harnessing the synergy between the $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave altermagnet and its superconducting counterpart, our proposal extends to high-$T_c$ platforms naturally. Overall, this work establishes altermagnets as a versatile paradigm for realizing topological superconductivity, bridging conceptual innovations with scalable quantum architectures devoid of orbital effects and stray fields.

Title: Silver(I) complexes with nitrile ligands: new materials with versatile applications
Authors: Karolina Gutmańska, Piotr Szweda, Marek Daszkiewicz, Konrad Szaciłowski, Tomasz Mazur, Anna Ciborska, Anna Dołęga
Abstract: In the present study, the structure, thermal stability, conductive properties, and antimicrobial activity of silver(I) complexes with nitrile ligands were investigated. For the construction of the materials, 2 cyanopyridine (2-cpy), 4-cyanopyridine (4-cpy), 1,2-dicyanobenzene (1,2-dcb), and 1,3 dicyanobenzene (1,3-dcb) were used in addition to the silver nitrite and nitrate. Four new compounds were isolated and structurally characterized: one molecular complex [Ag4(1,2-dcb)4(NO3)4], two 1-D coordination polymers [Ag2(2-cpy)2(NO2)2], [Ag3(1,3-dcb)2(NO3)2] and one 3-D coordination polymer [Ag(4-cpy)(NO2)]. The results indicate that the nitrite complexes display good antimicrobial properties against the tested bacterial and fungal strains. The presence of weakly coordinating CN groups increases the release of silver ions into the bacterial and yeast cell environments. Moreover, these materials exhibit unusual electrical properties in thin-layer devices. On the other hand, the nitrite and nitrate counterions give rise to the low thermal stability of the complexes.

Title: Half-Metallic Fe/MgO Superlattice: An Ideal Candidate for Magnetic Tunnel Junction Electrodes
Authors: Nicholas A. Lanzillo, Sergey Faleev, Aakash Pushp
Abstract: Magnetic Tunnel Junction (MTJ) based Spin-Transfer Torque Magnetic Random Access Memory (STT-MRAM) is poised to replace embedded Flash for advanced applications such as automotive microcontroller units. To achieve deeper technological adoption, MTJ needs to exhibit three key features: low magnetization (Ms), high perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) and high tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR). Here, we theoretically show that when Fe/MgO multilayers are inserted into the fixed and free layers of the MTJ, these three conditions are simultaneously met. As the number of Fe/MgO multilayers in MTJ electrodes is increased, we find that the electron transport evolves from direct barrier tunneling of majority spin states to the resonant tunneling of minority spin states. Remarkably, the projected density of states (PDOS) of Fe/MgO superlattice at the MgO tunnel barrier exhibits half-metallicity near the Fermi Energy, where the minority states exist while the majority states are gapped out, resulting in astronomically high TMR.

Title: Superconductivity in doped planar Dirac insulators: A renormalization group study
Authors: Sk Asrap Murshed, Sanjib Kumar Das, Bitan Roy
Abstract: From a leading-order unbiased renormalization group analysis we here showcase the emergence of superconductivity (including the topological ones) from purely repulsive electron-electron interactions in two-dimensional doped Dirac insulators, featuring a Fermi surface. In the absence of chemical doping, such systems describe quantum anomalous or spin Hall and normal insulators. Otherwise a simply connected Fermi surface becomes annular deep inside the topological regime. By considering all symmetry allowed repulsive local four-fermion interactions, we show that the nature of the resulting superconducting states at low temperature follows certain Clifford algebraic selection rules, irrespective of the underlying Fermi surface topology. Within the framework of a microscopic Hubbard model, on-site repulsion among fermions with opposite orbitals (spin projections) typically favors topological $p$-wave (conventional $s$-wave) pairing. Theoretically predicted superconductivity can in principle be observed in experiments once the promising candidate materials for quantum anomalous and spin Hall insulators are doped to foster Fermi surfaces.

Title: Landau levels for discrete-time quantum walks in artificial magnetic fields
Authors: Pablo Arnault, Fabrice Debbasch
Abstract: A new family of 2D discrete-time quantum walks (DTQWs) is presented and shown to coincide, in the continuous limit, with the Dirac dynamics of a spin 1/2 fermion coupled to a constant and uniform magnetic field. Landau levels are constructed, not only in the continuous limit, but also for the DTQWs i.e. for finite non-vanishing values of the time- and position-step, by a perturbative approach in the step. Numerical simulations support the above results and suggest that the magnetic interpretation is valid beyond the scope of the continuous limit. The possibility of quantum simulation of condensed-matter systems by DTQWs is also discussed.

Title: Quantum Walks and discrete Gauge Theories
Authors: Pablo Arnault, Fabrice Debbasch
Abstract: A particular example is produced to prove that quantum walks can be used to simulate full-fledged discrete gauge theories. A new family of $2D$ walks is introduced and its continuous limit is shown to coincide with the dynamics of a Dirac fermion coupled to arbitrary electromagnetic fields. The electromagnetic interpretation is extended beyond the continuous limit by proving that these DTQWs exhibit an exact discrete local $U(1)$ gauge invariance and possess a discrete gauge-invariant conserved current. A discrete gauge-invariant electromagnetic field is also constructed and that field is coupled to the conserved current by a discrete generalization of Maxwell equations. The dynamics of the DTQWs under crossed electric and magnetic fields is finally explored outside the continuous limit by numerical simulations. Bloch oscillations and the so-called ${\bf E} \times {\bf B}$ drift are recovered in the weak-field limit. Localization is observed for some values of the gauge fields.

Title: Quantum walks and non-Abelian discrete gauge theory
Authors: Pablo Arnault, Giuseppe Di Molfetta, Marc Brachet, Fabrice Debbasch
Abstract: A new family of discrete-time quantum walks (DTQWs) on the line with an exact discrete $U(N)$ gauge invariance is introduced. It is shown that the continuous limit of these DTQWs, when it exists, coincides with the dynamics of a Dirac fermion coupled to usual $U(N)$ gauge fields in $2D$ spacetime. A discrete generalization of the usual $U(N)$ curvature is also constructed. An alternate interpretation of these results in terms of superimposed $U(1)$ Maxwell fields and $SU(N)$ gauge fields is discussed in the Appendix. Numerical simulations are also presented, which explore the convergence of the DTQWs towards their continuous limit and which also compare the DTQWs with classical (i.e. non-quantum) motions in classical $SU(2)$ fields. The results presented in this article constitute a first step towards quantum simulations of generic Yang-Mills gauge theories through DTQWs.

Title: Discrete-time quantum walks as fermions of lattice gauge theory
Authors: Pablo Arnault, Armando Pérez, Pablo Arrighi, Terry Farrelly
Abstract: It is shown that discrete-time quantum walks can be used to digitize, i.e., to time discretize fermionic models of continuous-time lattice gauge theory. The resulting discrete-time dynamics is thus not only manifestly unitary, but also ultralocal, i.e. the particle's speed is upper bounded, as in standard relativistic quantum field theories. The lattice chiral symmetry of staggered fermions, which corresponds to a translational invariance, is lost after the requirement of ultralocality of the evolution; this fact is an instance of Meyer's 1996 no-go lemma stating that no non-trivial one-dimensional scalar quantum cellular automaton can be translationally invariant [1]. All results are presented in a single-particle framework and for a (1+1)-dimensional spacetime.

Title: Electromagnetic lattice gauge invariance in two-dimensional discrete-time quantum walks
Authors: Iván Márquez-Mártin, Pablo Arnault, Giuseppe Di Molfetta, Armando Pérez
Abstract: Gauge invariance is one of the more important concepts in physics. We discuss this concept in connection with the unitary evolution of discrete-time quantum walks in one and two spatial dimensions, when they include the interaction with synthetic, external electromagnetic fields. One introduces this interaction as additional phases that play the role of gauge fields. Here, we present a way to incorporate those phases, which differs from previous works. Our proposal allows the discrete derivatives, that appear under a gauge transformation, to treat time and space on the same footing, in a way which is similar to standard lattice gauge theories. By considering two steps of the evolution, we define a density current which is gauge invariant and conserved. In the continuum limit, the dynamics of the particle, under a suitable choice of the parameters, becomes the Dirac equation, and the conserved current satisfies the corresponding conservation equation.

Title: Quantum simulation of quantum relativistic diffusion via quantum walks
Authors: Pablo Arnault, Adrian Macquet, Andreu Anglés-Castillo, Iván Márquez-Martín, Vicente Pina-Canelles, Armando Pérez, Giuseppe Di Molfetta, Pablo Arrighi, Fabrice Debbasch
Abstract: Two models are first presented, of one-dimensional discrete-time quantum walk (DTQW) with temporal noise on the internal degree of freedom (i.e., the coin): (i) a model with both a coin-flip and a phase-flip channel, and (ii) a model with random coin unitaries. It is then shown that both these models admit a common limit in the spacetime continuum, namely, a Lindblad equation with Dirac-fermion Hamiltonian part and, as Lindblad jumps, a chirality flip and a chirality-dependent phase flip, which are two of the three standard error channels for a two-level quantum system. This, as one may call it, Dirac Lindblad equation, provides a model of quantum relativistic spatial diffusion, which is evidenced both analytically and numerically. This model of spatial diffusion has the intriguing specificity of making sense only with original unitary models which are relativistic in the sense that they have chirality, on which the noise is introduced: The diffusion arises via the by-construction (quantum) coupling of chirality to the position. For a particle with vanishing mass, the model of quantum relativistic diffusion introduced in the present work, reduces to the well-known telegraph equation, which yields propagation at short times, diffusion at long times, and exhibits no quantumness. Finally, the results are extended to temporal noises which depend smoothly on position.

Title: Quantum walks in weak electric fields and Bloch oscillations
Authors: Pablo Arnault, Benjamin Pepper, A. Pérez
Abstract: Bloch oscillations appear when an electric field is superimposed on a quantum particle that evolves on a lattice with a tight-binding Hamiltonian (TBH), i.e., evolves via what we will call an electric TBH; this phenomenon will be referred to as TBH Bloch oscillations. A similar phenomenon is known to show up in so-called electric discrete-time quantum walks (DQWs); this phenomenon will be referred to as DQW Bloch oscillations. This similarity is particularly salient when the electric field of the DQW is weak. For a wide, i.e., spatially extended initial condition, one numerically observes semi-classical oscillations, i.e., oscillations of a localized particle, both for the electric TBH and the electric DQW. More precisely: The numerical simulations strongly suggest that the semi-classical DQW Bloch oscillations correspond to two counter-propagating semi-classical TBH Bloch oscillations. In this work it is shown that, under certain assumptions, the solution of the electric DQW for a weak electric field and a wide initial condition is well approximated by the superposition of two continuous-time expressions, which are counter-propagating solutions of an electric TBH whose hopping amplitude is the cosine of the arbitrary coin-operator mixing angle. In contrast, if one wishes the continuous-time approximation to hold for spatially localized initial conditions, one needs at least the DQW to be lazy, as suggested by numerical simulations and by the fact that this has been proven in the case of a vanishing electric field.

Title: Clifford algebra from quantum automata and unitary Wilson fermions
Authors: Pablo Arnault
Abstract: We introduce a spacetime discretization of the Dirac equation that has the form of a quantum automaton and that is invariant upon changing the representation of the Clifford algebra, as the Dirac equation itself. Our derivation follows Dirac's original one: We required that the square of the discrete Dirac scheme be what we define as an acceptable discretization of the Klein-Gordon equation. Contrary to standard lattice gauge theory in discrete time, in which unitarity needs to be proven, we show that the quantum automaton delivers naturally unitary Wilson fermions for any choice of Wilson's parameter.

Title: A single-particle framework for unitary lattice gauge theory in discrete time
Authors: Pablo Arnault, Christopher Cedzich
Abstract: We construct a real-time lattice-gauge-theory-type action for a spin-1/2 matter field of a single particle on a (1+1)-dimensional spacetime lattice. The framework is based on a discrete-time quantum walk, and is hence inherently unitary and strictly local, i.e., transition amplitudes exactly vanish outside of a lightcone on the lattice. We then provide a lattice Noether's theorem for internal symmetries of this action. We further couple this action to an electromagnetic field by a minimal substitution on the lattice. Finally, we suggest a real-time lattice-gauge-theory-type action for the electromagnetic field in arbitrary spacetime dimensions, and derive its classical equations of motion, which are lattice versions of Maxwell's equations.

Title: Quantum spatial search with electric potential : long-time dynamics and robustness to noise
Authors: Thibault Fredon, Julien Zylberman, Pablo Arnault, Fabrice Debbasch
Abstract: We present various results on the scheme introduced , which is a quantum spatial-search algorithm on a two-dimensional (2D) square spatial grid, realized with a 2D Dirac discrete-time quantum walk (DQW) coupled to a Coulomb electric field centered on the marked node. In such a walk, the electric term acts as the oracle of the algorithm, and the free walk (i.e., without electric term) acts as the "diffusion" part, as it is called in Grover's algorithm. The results are the following. First, we run simulations of this electric Dirac DQW during longer times than explored in Ref.\ \cite{ZD21}, and observe that there is a second localization peak around the node marked by the oracle, reached in a time $O(\sqrt{N})$, where $N$ is the number of nodes of the 2D grid, with a localization probability scaling as $O(1/\ln N)$. This matches the state-of-the-art 2D DQW search algorithms before amplitude amplification. We then study the effect of adding noise on the Coulomb potential, and observe that the walk, especially the second localization peak, is highly robust to spatial noise, more modestly robust to spatiotemporal noise, and that the first localization peak is even highly robust to spatiotemporal noise.

Title: Breaking Performance Barriers: Massive-Scale Simulations of 2D Ising and Blume-Capel Models on Rack-Scale Multi-GPU Systems
Authors: Mauro Bisson, Massimo Bernaschi, Massimiliano Fatica, Nikolaos G. Fytas, Isidoro González-Adalid Pemartín, Víctor Martín-Mayor, Alexandros Vasilopoulos
Abstract: We present high-performance implementations of the two-dimensional Ising and Blume-Capel models for large-scale, multi-GPU simulations. Our approach takes full advantage of the NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 system, which features up to $72$ GPUs interconnected via high-bandwidth NVLink, enabling direct GPU-to-GPU memory access across multiple nodes. By utilizing Fabric Memory and an optimized Monte Carlo kernel for the Ising model, our implementation supports simulations of systems with linear sizes up to $L=2^{23}$, corresponding to approximately $70$ trillion spins. This allows for a peak processing rate of nearly $1.15 \times 10^5$ lattice updates per nanosecond-setting a new performance benchmark for Ising model simulations. Additionally, we introduce a custom protocol for computing correlation functions, which strikes an optimal balance between computational efficiency and statistical accuracy. This protocol enables large-scale simulations without incurring prohibitive runtime costs. Benchmark results show near-perfect strong and weak scaling up to $64$ GPUs, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach for large-scale statistical physics simulations.

Title: Empirical rovibrational energy levels for carbon disulfide
Authors: Tanvi Sattiraju, Jonathan Tennyson
Abstract: An analysis of the measured rovibrational transitions is carried out for the 12C32S2 isotopologue of carbon disulfide. Data from 21 sources is extracted and validated using a consistent set of standard linear molecule quantum numbers. A corrected list of 8714 CS2 transitions forms the input to a Measured Active Rotational-Vibrational Energy Levels (MARVEL) procedure, generating 4279 empirical rovibrational energy levels across 138 bands of 12C32S2. Results are compared to the recent NASA Ames line list. While the agreement is generally good, issues are identified with the energy levels of some states, notably those with high values of the v2 bending quantum number.

Title: Multipartite Entanglement Structure of Fibered Link States
Authors: Vijay Balasubramanian, Charlie Cummings
Abstract: We study the patterns of multipartite entanglement in Chern-Simons theory with compact gauge group $G$ and level $k$ for states defined by the path integral on "link complements", i.e., compact manifolds whose boundaries consist of $n$ topologically linked tori. We focus on link complements which can be described topologically as fibrations over a Seifert surface. We show that the entanglement structure of such fibered link complement states is controlled by a topological invariant, the monodromy of the fibration. Thus, the entanglement structure of a Chern-Simons link state is not simply a function of the link, but also of the background manifold in which the link is embedded. In particular, we show that any link possesses an embedding into some background that leads to GHZ-like entanglement. Furthermore, we demonstrate that all fibered links with periodic monodromy have GHZ-like entanglement, i.e., a partial trace on any link component produces a separable state.

Title: Local Quenches from a Krylov Perspective
Authors: Pawel Caputa, Giuseppe Di Giulio
Abstract: In this work, we investigate local quench dynamics in two-dimensional conformal field theories using Krylov space methods. We derive Lanczos coefficients, spread complexity, and Krylov entropies for local joining and splitting quenches in theories on an infinite line, a circle, a finite interval, and at finite temperature. We examine how these quantities depend on the central charge of the underlying conformal field theory and find that both spread complexity and Krylov entropy are proportional to it. Interestingly, Krylov entropies evolve logarithmically with time, mirroring standard entanglement entropies, making them useful for extracting the central charge. In the large central charge limit, using holography, we establish a connection between the rate of spread complexity and the proper momentum of the tip of the end-of-the world brane, which probes the bulk analogously to a point particle. Our results further demonstrate that spread complexity and Krylov entropies are powerful tools for probing non-equilibrium dynamics of interacting quantum systems.

Title: Quantum natural gradient with thermal-state initialization
Authors: Michele Minervini, Dhrumil Patel, Mark M. Wilde
Abstract: Parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) are central to variational quantum algorithms (VQAs), yet their performance is hindered by complex loss landscapes that make their trainability challenging. Quantum natural gradient descent, which leverages the geometry of the parameterized space through quantum generalizations of the Fisher information matrix, offers a promising solution but has been largely limited to pure-state scenarios, with only approximate methods available for mixed-state settings. This paper addresses this question, originally posed in [Stokes et al., Quantum 4, 269 (2020)], by providing exact methods to compute three quantum generalizations of the Fisher information matrix-the Fisher-Bures, Wigner-Yanase, and Kubo-Mori information matrices-for PQCs initialized with thermal states. We prove that these matrix elements can be estimated using quantum algorithms combining the Hadamard test, classical random sampling, and Hamiltonian simulation. By broadening the set of quantum generalizations of Fisher information and realizing their unbiased estimation, our results enable the implementation of quantum natural gradient descent algorithms for mixed-state PQCs, thereby enhancing the flexibility of optimization when using VQAs. Another immediate consequence of our findings is to establish fundamental limitations on the ability to estimate the parameters of a state generated by an unknown PQC, when given sample access to such a state.

Title: Long-range nonstabilizerness and phases of matter
Authors: David Aram Korbany, Michael J. Gullans, Lorenzo Piroli
Abstract: Long-range nonstabilizerness can be defined as the amount of nonstabilizerness which cannot be removed by shallow local quantum circuits. In this work, we study long-range nonstabilizerness in the context of many-body quantum physics, a task with possible implications for quantum-state preparation protocols and implementation of quantum-error correcting codes. After presenting a simple argument showing that long-range nonstabilizerness is a generic property of many-body states, we restrict to the class of ground states of gapped local Hamiltonians. We focus on one-dimensional systems and present rigorous results in the context of translation-invariant matrix product states (MPSs). By analyzing the fixed points of the MPS renormalization-group flow, we provide a sufficient condition for long-range nonstabilizerness, which depends entirely on the local MPS tensors. Physically, our condition captures the fact that the mutual information between distant regions of stabilizer fixed points is quantized, and this fact is not changed after applying shallow quantum circuits. We also discuss possible ramifications in the classification of phases of matter and quantum error correction.

Title: Measurement-induced symmetry restoration and quantum Mpemba effect
Authors: Giuseppe Di Giulio, Xhek Turkeshi, Sara Murciano
Abstract: Monitoring a quantum system can profoundly alter its dynamical properties, leading to nontrivial emergent phenomena. In this work, we demonstrate that dynamical measurements strongly influence the evolution of symmetry in many-body quantum systems. Specifically, we demonstrate that monitored systems governed by non-Hermitian dynamics exhibit a quantum Mpemba effect, where systems with stronger initial asymmetry relax faster to a symmetric state. Crucially, this phenomenon is purely measurement-induced: in the absence of measurements, we find states where the corresponding unitary evolution does not display any Mpemba effect. Furthermore, we uncover a novel measurement-induced symmetry restoration mechanism: below a critical measurement rate, the symmetry remains broken, but beyond a threshold, it is fully restored in the thermodynamic limit--along with the emergence of the quantum Mpemba effect.

Title: Superdiffusion, normal diffusion and chaos in semiclassical Bose-Hubbard chains
Authors: Dragan Marković, Mihailo Čubrović
Abstract: We study the evolution of two-point correlation functions of one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model in the semiclassical regime in the framework of Truncated Wigner Approximation (TWA) with quantum jumps as first-order corrections. At early times, the correlation functions show strong superdiffusion with universal integer exponents determined solely by the initial conditions and completely insensitive to system parameters and chaos. Only after a long time this regime crosses over to normal diffusion regime which is most robust when nonintegrability is strong. For strong nonintegrability, the system ends up in a homogeneous state while for weak nonintegrability the oscillations and inhomogeneities persist, despite the fact that chaos is nearly always strong and only weakly depends on nonintegrability parameter. We conclude that the superidiffusive regime is neither prethermalized nor a precursor to thermalization but a novel early-time phenomenon related to a special scaling symmetry of the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian.

Title: Thermodynamic speed limit for non-adiabatic work and its classical-quantum decomposition
Authors: Aoi Yamauchi, Rihito Nagase, Kaixin Li, Takahiro Sagawa, Ken Funo
Abstract: Understanding the fundamental constraint on work far beyond the adiabatic regime is crucial to investigating fast and efficient energy extraction or consumption processes. In this study, we derive thermodynamic speed limits for non-adiabatic work and quantify the fundamental costs of non-adiabatic work extraction or consumption processes in open quantum systems, where the costs are quantified by geometric and thermodynamic quantities. We further decompose the non-adiabatic work into classical and quantum contributions and derive their thermodynamic speed limits, clarifying the classical and quantum nature of the fundamental costs. The obtained results are numerically demonstrated by driven two-level systems.

Title: Applications of the Quantum Phase Difference Estimation Algorithm to the Excitation Energies in Spin Systems on a NISQ Device
Authors: Boni Paul, Sudhindu Bikash Mandal, Kenji Sugisaki, B. P. Das
Abstract: The Quantum Phase Difference Estimation (QPDE) algorithm, as an extension of the Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE), is a quantum algorithm designed to compute the differences of two eigenvalues of a unitary operator by exploiting the quantum superposition of two eigenstates. Unlike QPE, QPDE is free of controlled-unitary operations, and is suitable for calculations on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. We present the implementation and verification of a novel early fault-tolerant QPDE algorithm for determining energy gaps across diverse spin system configurations using NISQ devices. The algorithm is applied to the systems described by two and three-spin Heisenberg Hamiltonians with different geometric arrangements and coupling strengths, including symmetric, asymmetric, spin-frustrated, and non-frustrated configurations. By leveraging the match gate-like structure of the time evolution operator of Heisenberg Hamiltonian, we achieve constant-depth quantum circuits suitable for NISQ hardware implementation. Our results on IBM quantum processors show remarkable accuracy ranging from 85\% to 93\%, demonstrating excellent agreement with classical calculations even in the presence of hardware noise. The methodology incorporates sophisticated quantum noise suppression techniques, including Pauli Twirling and Dynamical Decoupling, and employs an adaptive framework. Our findings demonstrate the practical viability of the QPDE algorithm for quantum many-body simulations on current NISQ hardware, establishing a robust framework for future applications.

Title: Local ergotropy dynamically witnesses many-body localized phases
Authors: Francesco Formicola, Grazia Di Bello, Giulio De Filippis, Vittorio Cataudella, Donato Farina, Carmine Antonio Perroni
Abstract: Many-body localization is a dynamical phenomenon characteristic of strongly interacting and disordered many-body quantum systems which fail to achieve thermal equilibrium. From a quantum information perspective, the fingerprint of this phenomenon is the logarithmic growth of the entanglement entropy over time. We perform intensive numerical simulations, applied to a paradigmatic model system, showing that the local ergotropy, the maximum extractable work via local unitary operations on a small subsystem in the presence of Hamiltonian coupling, dynamically witnesses the change from ergodic to localized phases. Within the many-body localized phase, both the local ergotropy and its quantum fluctuations slowly vary over time with a characteristic logarithmic law analogous to the behaviour of entanglement entropy. This showcases how directly leveraging local control, instead of local observables or entropies analyzed in previous works, provides a thermodynamic marker of localization phenomena based on the locally extractable work.

Title: Turbulence and large-scale structures in self-gravitating superfluids
Authors: Sanjay Shukla
Abstract: We study turbulence in self-gravitating superfluids by performing direct numerical simulations of the 3D Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson (GPP) equation, which is also a model for dark matter haloes around galaxies. In the absence of self-gravity, the spectrally truncated Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation shows the emergence of Kolmogorov's $5/3$ scaling in the incompressible kinetic energy spectrum. Introducing self-gravity, we observe the formation of spherically collapsed structures, which introduce a minimum in the kinetic energy spectrum that corresponds to the sizes of these structures. The system shows early convergence towards statistically stationary states, which we show by the onset of thermalisation in the compressible kinetic energy spectrum, where $E_{\rm kin}^c \propto k^2$. We also show that the formation of such large-scale structures suggests that the particles (bosons) move from small to large scales through an inverse cascade, supporting a mechanism for the formation of large-scale structures, such as dark matter haloes, around our galaxy Milky Way.

Title: Generating long-distance magnetic couplings with flat bands
Authors: Georges Bouzerar, Maxime Thumin
Abstract: One of the great challenges for the large-scale development of quantum technologies is to generate and control the entanglement of quantum bits through interactions of sufficiently long range. Two decades ago, spin chains have been proposed for quantum communication. Unfortunately, couplings are of very short range in general which drastically limits the communication to very short distances. Here, we demonstrate that the presence of flat bands (FBs) can trigger very long-distance magnetic couplings in spin chains. Furthermore, we show that the typical decaying lengthscale is directly related to the quantum metric of the flat band eigenstates. We believe that our unexpected findings could open up an alternative route to enable long-distance quantum communication.

Title: Integral representation of solutions to initial-boundary value problems in the framework of the hyperbolic heat equation
Authors: Sergey A. Rukolaine
Abstract: We consider initial-boundary value problems on a finite interval for the system of the energy balance equation and modified Fourier's law (constitutive equation, commonly called the Cattaneo equation) describing temperature (or internal energy) and heat flux. This hyperbolic system of first-order partial differential equations is the simplest model of non-Fourier heat conduction. Boundary conditions comprise various models of behavior of a physical system at the boundaries, including boundary conditions describing Newton's law, which states that the heat flux at the boundary is directly proportional to the difference in the temperature of the physical system and ambient temperature. In this case the boundary conditions express the relationship of unknown functions (temperature or internal energy and heat flux) with each other. To solve the problems, we apply the Fokas unified transform method.

Title: Block-corrected Modularity for Community Detection
Authors: Hasti Narimanzadeh, Takayuki Hiraoka, Mikko Kivelä
Abstract: Unknown node attributes in complex networks may introduce community structures that are important to distinguish from those driven by known attributes. We propose a block-corrected modularity that discounts given block structures present in the network to reveal communities masked by them. We show analytically how the proposed modularity finds the community structure driven by an unknown attribute in a simple network model. Further, we observe that the block-corrected modularity finds the underlying community structure on a number of simple synthetic network models while methods using different null models fail. We develop an efficient spectral method as well as two Louvain-inspired fine-tuning algorithms to maximize the proposed modularity and demonstrate their performance on several synthetic network models. Finally, we assess our methodology on various real-world citation networks built using the OpenAlex data by correcting for the temporal citation patterns.

Title: Electric-field control of photon indistinguishability in cascaded decays in quantum dots
Authors: Gabriel Undeutsch, Maximilian Aigner, Ailton J. Garcia Jr., Johannes Reindl, Melina Peter, Simon Mader, Christian Weidinger, Saimon F. Covre da Silva, Santanu Manna, Eva Schöll, Armando Rastelli
Abstract: Photon indistinguishability, entanglement, and antibunching are key ingredients in quantum optics and photonics. Decay cascades in quantum emitters offer a simple method to create entangled photon-pairs with negligible multi-pair generation probability. However, the degree of indistinguishability of the photons emitted in a cascade is intrinsically limited by the lifetime ratio of the involved transitions. Here we show that, for the biexciton-exciton cascade in a quantum dot, this ratio can be widely tuned by an applied electric field. Hong-Ou-Mandel interference measurements of two subsequently emitted biexciton photons show that their indistinguishability increases with increasing field, following the theoretically predicted behavior. At the same time, the emission linewidth stays close to the transform-limit, favoring applications relying on the interference among photons emitted by different sources.

Title: Scalability of the second-order reliability method for stochastic differential equations with multiplicative noise
Authors: Timo Schorlepp, Tobias Grafke
Abstract: We show how to efficiently compute asymptotically sharp estimates of extreme event probabilities in stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with small multiplicative Brownian noise. The underlying approximation is known as sharp large deviation theory or precise Laplace asymptotics in mathematics, the second-order reliability method (SORM) in reliability engineering, and the instanton or optimal fluctuation method with 1-loop corrections in physics. It is based on approximating the tail probability in question with the most probable realization of the stochastic process, and local perturbations around this realization. We first recall and contextualize the relevant classical theoretical result on precise Laplace asymptotics of diffusion processes [Ben Arous (1988), Stochastics, 25(3), 125-153], and then show how to compute the involved infinite-dimensional quantities - operator traces and Carleman-Fredholm determinants - numerically in a way that is scalable with respect to the time discretization and remains feasible in high spatial dimensions. Using tools from automatic differentiation, we achieve a straightforward black-box numerical computation of the SORM estimates in JAX. The method is illustrated in examples of SDEs and stochastic partial differential equations, including a two-dimensional random advection-diffusion model of a passive scalar. We thereby demonstrate that it is possible to obtain efficient and accurate SORM estimates for very high-dimensional problems, as long as the infinite-dimensional structure of the problem is correctly taken into account. Our JAX implementation of the method is made publicly available.

Title: Thermodynamically Consistent Lindbladians for Quantum Stochastic Thermodynamics
Authors: Jin-Fu Chen
Abstract: We develop a Lindblad framework for quantum stochastic thermodynamics to study the nonequilibrium thermodynamics of open quantum systems. Our approach adopts the local quantum detailed balance condition, ensuring thermodynamic consistency and leading to a joint fluctuation theorem of quantum work and heat. Instead of solving the full evolution of the density matrix, we employ an effective parametrization to derive the full counting statistics of work and heat and determine the optimal protocols. As an application, we refine the quantum Brownian motion master equation to ensure the quantum detailed balance condition, derive the optimal protocols at different temperatures, and study the work statistics. Our framework provides fundamental insights and practical strategies for optimizing thermodynamic processes in open quantum systems.

Title: Limit theorems for the non-convex multispecies Curie-Weiss model
Authors: Francesco Camilli, Emanuele Mingione, Godwin Osabutey
Abstract: We study the thermodynamic properties of the generalized non-convex multispecies Curie-Weiss model, where interactions among different types of particles (forming the species) are encoded in a generic matrix. For spins with a generic prior distribution, we compute the pressure in the thermodynamic limit using simple interpolation techniques. For Ising spins, we further analyze the fluctuations of the magnetization in the thermodynamic limit under the Boltzmann-Gibbs measure. It is shown that a central limit theorem holds for a rescaled and centered vector of species magnetizations, which converges to either a centered or non-centered multivariate normal distribution, depending on the rate of convergence of the relative sizes of the species.

Title: Highly Entangled 2D Ground State: Tensor Network, Order Parameter and Correlation
Authors: Olai B. Mykland, Zhao Zhang
Abstract: In this article we present analytical results on the exact tensor network representation, spin order parameter and color correlation function of the first example of 2D ground states with entanglement phase transitions from area law to extensive entanglement entropy. The tensor network constructed is one dimension higher than the lattice of the physical system, allowing entangled physical degrees of freedoms to be paired with one another arbitrarily far away. Contraction rules of the internal legs are specified by a simple translationally invariant set of rules in terms of the tesselation of cubes in 3D space. The network directly generalizes the previous holographic tensor networks for 1D Fredkin and Motzkin chains. We also analyze the order parameter of in the spin sector from the scaling of the height function of random surfaces, and the correlation in the color sector.

Title: Microwave-coupled optical bistability in driven and interacting Rydberg gases
Authors: Zhehua Zhang, Zeyan Zhang, Shaoxing Han, Yuqing Zhang, Guoqing Zhang, Jizhou Wu, Vladimir B. Sovkov, Wenliang Liu, Yuqing Li, Linjie Zhang, Liantuan Xiao, Suotang Jia, Weibin Li, Jie Ma
Abstract: Nonequilibrium dynamics are closely related to various fields of research, in which vastly different phases emerge when parameters are changed. However, it is difficult to construct nonequilibrium systems that have sufficiently tunable controllable parameters. Using microwave field coupling induced optical bistability, Rydberg gases exhibit a range of significantly different optical responses. In conjunction with electromagnetically induced transparency, the microwave coupling can create versatile nonequilibrium dynamics. In particular, the microwave coupling of two Rydberg states provides an additional handle for controlling the dynamics. And the microwave-controlled nonequilibrium phase transition has the potential to be applied in microwave field measurement. This study opens a new avenue to exploring bistable dynamics using microwave-coupled Rydberg gases, and developing quantum technological applications.

Title: Digital Simulation of Non-Abelian Parafermions in Superconducting Circuits
Authors: Hong-Yu Wang, Xiong-Jun Liu
Abstract: Parafermions, which can be viewed as a fractionalized version of Majorana modes, exhibit non-Abelian statistics and emerge in topologically ordered systems, while their realization in experiment has been challenging. Here we propose an experimental scheme for the digital simulation of parafermions and their non-Abelian braiding in superconducting circuits by realizing the $\mathbb{Z}_d$ plaquette model on a two-dimensional lattice. Two protocols using quantum circuits and non-destructive measurements are introduced to prepare the ground state, on which the parafermion pairs are created by engineering dislocations. We further develop a generalized code deformation approach to realize the fusion and non-Abelian braiding statistics of parafermion modes, in which the concrete example for $d=3$ parafermions is studied in detail. We also examine the real parameter regime to confirm the feasibility in superconducting devices. This work extends previous methods for twist defects in superconducting qubits to qudit systems, and may open up a way for parafermion-based high-dimensional topological quantum computing with experimental feasibility.

Title: Symmetry defects and gauging for quantum states with matrix product unitary symmetries
Authors: Adrián Franco-Rubio, Arkadiusz Bochniak, J. Ignacio Cirac
Abstract: In this work, we examine the consequences of the existence of a finite group of matrix product unitary (MPU) symmetries for matrix product states (MPS). We generalize the well-understood picture of onsite unitary symmetries, which give rise to virtual symmetry defects given by insertions of operators in the bonds of the MPS. In the MPU case, we can define analogous defect tensors, this time sitting on lattice sites, that can be created, moved, and fused by local unitary operators. We leverage this formalism to study the gauging of MPU symmetries. We introduce a condition, block independence, under which we can gauge the symmetries by promoting the symmetry defects to gauge degrees of freedom, yielding an MPS of the same bond dimension that supports a local version of the symmetry given by commuting gauge constraints. Whenever block independence does not hold (which happens, in particular, whenever the symmetry representation is anomalous), a modification of our method which we call state-level gauging still gives rise to a locally symmetric MPS by promotion of the symmetry defects, at the expense of producing gauge constraints that do not commute on different sites.

Title: On the interpretability of neural network decoders
Authors: Lukas Bödeker, Luc J. B. Kusters, Markus Müller
Abstract: Neural-network (NN) based decoders are becoming increasingly popular in the field of quantum error correction (QEC), including for decoding of state-of-the-art quantum computation experiments. In this work, we make use of established interpretability methods from the field of machine learning, to introduce a toolbox to achieve an understanding of the underlying decoding logic of NN decoders, which have been trained but otherwise typically operate as black-box models. To illustrate the capabilities of the employed interpretability method, based on the Shapley value approximation, we provide an examplary case study of a NN decoder that is trained for flag-qubit based fault-tolerant (FT) QEC with the Steane code. We show how particular decoding decisions of the NN can be interpreted, and reveal how the NN learns to capture fundamental structures in the information gained from syndrome and flag qubit measurements, in order to come to a FT correction decision. Further, we show that the understanding of how the NN obtains a decoding decision can be used on the one hand to identify flawed processing of error syndrome information by the NN, resulting in decreased decoding performance, as well as for well-informed improvements of the NN architecture. The diagnostic capabilities of the interpretability method we present can help ensure successful application of machine learning for decoding of QEC protocols.

Title: Probing non-equilibrium steady states of the Klein-Gordon field with Unruh-DeWitt detectors
Authors: Albert Georg Passegger, Rainer Verch
Abstract: We calculate the transition rate of an Unruh-DeWitt detector coupled to a non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) of a free massless scalar field on four-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. The NESS arises from bringing two semi-infinite heat baths into thermal contact along a hypersurface. The detector couples linearly to the field by a monopole interaction, and it moves inertially along the axis of the NESS heat flow. We contrast the resulting transition rates with the case of a detector that is coupled to an inertial thermal equilibrium state. The results illustrate that the monopole does not properly couple to the heat flow, resulting in the detector to merely register kinematical effects. Hence dynamical features of the NESS are hidden from this detector model.

Title: Observation of tunable discrete time crystalline phases
Authors: Arnab Sarkar, Anurag, Javed A. Mondal, Rajan Singh, Aamir A. Makki, Ateesh K. Rathi, Ryan J.T. Nicholl, Sagar Chakraborty, Kirill I. Bolotin, Saikat Ghosh
Abstract: Discrete time crystals (DTCs) are emergent non-equilibrium phases of periodically driven many-body systems, with potential applications ranging from quantum computing to sensing and metrology. There has been significant recent interest in understanding mechanisms leading to DTC formation and a search for novel DTC phases beyond subharmonic entrainment. Here, we report observation of multiple DTC phases in a nanoelectromechanical system (NEMS) based on coupled graphene and silicon nitride membranes. We confirm the time-crystalline nature of these symmetry broken phases by establishing their many-body characters, long-range time and spatial order, and rigidity against parameter fluctuation or noise. Furthermore, we employ controlled mechanical strain to drive the transitions between phases with different symmetries, thereby mapping the emergent time-crystalline phase diagram. Overall, our work takes a step towards establishing time crystals as a system with complexity rivaling that of solid state crystals.

Title: Flux induced re-entrant dynamics in the quantum walk of interacting bosons
Authors: Mrinal Kanti Giri, Biswajit Paul, Tapan Mishra
Abstract: We study the QW of two interacting bosons on a two-leg ladder lattice in the presence of an artificial magnetic field. By considering an uniform flux piercing through the ladder, we show that in the limit of strong onsite repulsion and dominant rung-hopping, an initially slow dynamics becomes fast, then slow and fast again with increase in the flux strength indicating a re-entrant dynamics. This unusual behaviour is found to be associated with the formation, breaking and reformation of a bound pair state along the rung of the ladder. In addition to this we also find a re-entrant behaviour in the chiral dynamics where the chirality in the system first increases and then decreases with increase in interaction. We establish this unusual re-entrant behaviour in the dynamics by analysing the radial velocity, spreading of correlation, center-of-mass shearing and energy band diagrams.

Title: Theoretical study of high harmonic generation in monolayer NbSe$_2$
Authors: Daniel A. Rehn, Towfiq Ahmed, Jinkyoung Yoo, Rohit Prasankumar, Jian-Xin Zhu
Abstract: High harmonic generation (HHG) is a powerful probe of electron dynamics on attosecond to femtosecond timescales and has been successfully used to detect electronic and structural changes in solid-state quantum materials, including transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). Among TMDs, bulk NbSe2 exhibits charge density wave (CDW) order below 33 K and becomes superconducting below 7.3 K. Monolayer NbSe2 is therefore interesting as a material whose different structural and electronic properties could be probed via HHG. Here, we predict the HHG response of the pristine 2H and CDW phases of monolayer NbSe2 using real-time time-dependent density functional theory under the application of a simulated laser pulse excitation. We find that due to the lack of inversion symmetry in both monolayer phases, it is possible to excite even harmonics and that the even harmonics appear as the transverse components of the current response under excitations polarized along the zigzag direction of the monolayer, while odd harmonics arise from the longitudinal current response in all excitation directions. This suggests that the even and odd harmonic response can be controlled via the polarization of the probing field, opening an avenue for potentially useful applications in opto-electronic devices.

Title: Probing quantum properties of black holes with a Floquet-driven optical lattice simulator
Authors: Asmae Benhemou, Georgia Nixon, Aydin Deger, Ulrich Schneider, Jiannis K. Pachos
Abstract: In the curved spacetime of a black hole, quantum physics gives rise to distinctive effects such as Hawking radiation and maximally fast scrambling. Here, we present a scheme for an analogue quantum simulation of (1 + 1) and (2 + 1)-dimensional black holes using ultracold atoms in a locally Floquet-driven optical lattice. We show how the effective dynamics of the driven system can generate position-dependent tunnelling amplitudes that encode the curved geometry of the black hole. Moreover, we provide a simple and robust scheme to determine the Hawking temperature of a (1+1)D simulated black hole based solely on on-site atom population measurements. Combined with the highly tunable onsite atom-atom interactions typical for cold atoms, our simulator provides a powerful and feasible platform to probe the scrambling of quantum information in black holes. We illustrate the ergodicity of our (2+1)D black-hole simulator by showing numerically that its level statistics in the hard-core limit approaches the ergodic regime faster than a globally homogeneous Hamiltonian.

Title: Proposal for many-body quantum chaos detection

Abstract: In this work, the term ``quantum chaos'' refers to spectral correlations similar to those found in the random matrix theory. Quantum chaos can be diagnosed through the analysis of level statistics using e.g.~the spectral form factor, which detects both short- and long-range level correlations. The spectral form factor corresponds to the Fourier transform of the two-point spectral correlation function and exhibits a typical slope-dip-ramp-plateau structure (aka correlation hole) when the system is chaotic. We discuss how this structure could be detected through the quench dynamics of two physical quantities accessible to experimental many-body quantum systems: the survival probability and the spin autocorrelation function. The survival probability is equivalent to the spectral form factor with an additional filter. When the system is small, the dip of the correlation hole reaches sufficiently large values at times which are short enough to be detected with current experimental platforms. As the system is pushed away from chaos, the correlation hole disappears, signaling integrability or localization. We also provide a relatively shallow circuit with which the correlation hole could be detected with commercially available quantum computers.

Title: Optimal number of agents in a collective search, and when to launch them
Authors: Hugues Meyer, Heiko Rieger
Abstract: Search processes often involve multiple agents that collectively search a randomly located target. While increasing the number of agents usually decreases the time at which the first agent finds the target, it also requires resources to create and sustain more agents. In this manuscript, we raise the question of the optimal timing for launching multiple agents in a search in order to reach the best compromise between minimizing the overall search time and minimizing the costs associated with launching and sustaining agents. After introducing a general formalism for independent agents in which we allow them to be launched at arbitrary times, we investigate by means of analytical calculations and numerical optimization the optimal launch strategies to optimize the quantiles of the search cost and its mean. Finally, we compare our results with the case of stochastic resetting and study the conditions under which it is preferable to launch new searchers rather than resetting the first one to its initial position.

Title: Non Linear Hall Effects induced by Berry Curvature Dipole in CuPb$_9$(PO$_4$)$_6$O
Authors: Bishnu Karki, Kai Chen, Pavan Hosur
Abstract: The nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE), an emergent response in systems with broken inversion symmetry, provides a powerful tool for probing topological transport properties. In this context, we investigate copper-substituted lead apatite (LK-99), a material that initially garnered attention for its controversial claim of room-temperature superconductivity. Despite the unresolved nature of its superconducting properties, LK-99's unique electronic structure featuring flat bands near the Fermi level and broken inversion symmetry makes it a promising candidate for exploring Berry curvature-driven phenomena such as the NLHE. Using first-principles density functional theory and a refined tight-binding Hamiltonian model, we investigate LK-99's band topology and transport properties. Our calculations reveal that LK-99 hosts Weyl points near the Fermi level, which contribute significantly to Berry curvature. The inclusion of spin-orbit coupling further splits these bands, generating additional Weyl points and enhancing the Berry curvature distribution. Crucially, the absence of inversion symmetry in LK-99 leads to a net Berry curvature dipole, producing a nonlinear Hall current that scales quadratically with the applied electric field. Moreover, we demonstrate that the NLHE in LK-99 can be tuned by varying the direction of the applied electric field, underscoring its potential as a versatile platform for exploring topological transport phenomena and designing next-generation nonlinear electronic devices.

Title: Systematic analysis of relative phase extraction in one-dimensional Bose gases interferometry
Authors: Taufiq Murtadho, Marek Gluza, Khatee Zathul Arifa, Sebastian Erne, Jörg Schmiedmayer, Nelly H.Y. Ng
Abstract: Spatially resolved relative phase measurement of two adjacent 1D Bose gases is enabled by matter-wave interference upon free expansion. However, longitudinal dynamics is typically ignored in the analysis of experimental data. We provide an analytical formula showing a correction to the readout of the relative phase due to longitudinal expansion and mixing with the common phase. We numerically assess the error propagation to the estimation of the gases' physical quantities such as correlation functions and temperature. Our work characterizes the reliability and robustness of interferometric measurements, directing us to the improvement of existing phase extraction methods necessary to observe new physical phenomena in cold-atomic quantum simulators.

Title: Exciton self-trapping in twisted hexagonal boron nitride homostructures

Edgar, Camille Maestre, Bérangère Toury, Catherine Journet, Vincent Garnier, Philippe Steyer, Takashi Taniguchi, Kenji Watanabe, Cédric Robert, Xavier Marie, Annick Loiseau, Julien Barjon
Abstract: One of the main interests of 2D materials is their ability to be assembled with many degrees of freedom for tuning and manipulating excitonic properties. There is a need to understand how the structure of the interfaces between atomic layers influences exciton properties. Here we use cathodoluminescence and time-resolved cathodoluminescence experiments to study how excitons interact with the interface between two twisted hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) crystals with various angles. An efficient capture of free excitons by the interface is demonstrated, which leads to a population of long-lived and interface-localized (2D) excitons. Temperature dependent experiments indicate that for high twist angles, these excitons localized at the interface further undergo a selftrapping. It consists in a distortion of the lattice around the exciton on which the exciton traps itself. Our results suggest that this exciton-interface interaction causes the broad 4-eV optical emission of highly twisted hBN-hBN structures. Exciton self-trapping is finally discussed as a common feature of sp2 hybridized boron nitride polytypes and nanostructures due to the ionic nature of the B-N bond and the small size of their excitons.

Title: Spin-Peierls transition in the frustrated spinels ZnCr2O4 and MgCr2O4
Authors: Ludovic D. C. Jaubert, Yasir Iqbal, Harald O. Jeschke
Abstract: The chromium spinels MgCr2O4 and ZnCr2O4 are prime examples of the highly frustrated pyrochlore lattice antiferromagnet. Experiment has carefully established that both materials, upon cooling, distort to lower symmetry and order magnetically. We study the nature of this process by a combination of density-functional-theory based energy mapping and classical Monte Carlo simulations. We first computationally establish precise Heisenberg Hamiltonian parameters for the high temperature cubic and the low temperature tetragonal and orthorhombic structures of both spinels. We then investigate the respective ordering temperatures of high symmetry and low symmetry structures. We carefully compare our results with experimental facts and find that our simulations are remarkably consistent with a type of spin-Peierls mechanism, adapted to three dimensions, where the structural distortion is mediated by a magnetic energy gain due to a lower degree of frustration.

Title: Experimental Modeling of Chiral Active Robots and a Minimal Model of Non-Gaussian Displacements
Authors: Yuxuan Zhou, Maomao Ge, Ting Wang
Abstract: We design 3D-printed motor-driven active particles and find that their dynamics can be characterized using the model of overdamped chiral active Brownian particles (ABPs), as demonstrated by measured angular statistics and translational mean squared displacements (MSDs). Furthermore, we propose a minimal model that reproduces the double-peak velocity distributions and further predicts a transition from the single-peak to the double-peak displacement distributions in short-time regimes. The model provides a clear physics picture of these phenomena, originating from the competition between the active motion and the translational diffusion. Our experiments confirm such picture. The minimal model enhances our understanding of activity-driven non-Gaussian phenomena. The designed particles could be further applied in the study of collective chiral motions.

Title: Quantum-vacuum-protected topological edge polaritons
Authors: Raditya Weda Bomantara
Abstract: This paper uncovers the formation of topological edge polaritons that are protected by the presence of quantum vacuum. Such quantum-vacuum-protected edge polaritons could be achieved in a system of neutral atomic lattice under appropriate interaction with a single photonic mode. In the absence of the light-matter coupling, the system is shown to be topologically trivial, which consequently does not support edge modes. By employing Floquet theory, the system is also found to be topologically trivial in the classical light limit, i.e., at very small light-matter coupling but very large number of photons. On the other hand, by treating both the atomic and photonic degrees of freedom quantum mechanically, the system becomes topologically nontrivial in the full (atomic+photonic) Hilbert space, which manifests itself as a pair of topological (almost) zero energy eigenstates localized near each lattice's edge and with very small mean photon number. Finally, the robustness of such quantum-vacuum-protected edge polaritons against spatial disorder and counterrotating coupling effect is explicitly demonstrated.

Title: Topological floating phase of dipolar bosons in an optical ladder
Authors: Henning Korbmacher, Gustavo A. Domínguez-Castro, Mateusz Łącki, Jakub Zakrzewski, Luis Santos
Abstract: Ultracold dipolar hard-core bosons in optical ladders provide exciting possibilities for the quantum simulation of anisotropic XXZ spin ladders. We show that introducing a tilt along the rungs results in a rich phase diagram at unit filling. In particular, for a sufficiently strong dipolar strength, the interplay between the long-range tail of the dipolar interactions and the tilting leads to the emergence of a quantum floating phase, a critical phase with incommensurate density-density correlations. Interestingly, the study of the entanglement spectrum, reveals that the floating phase is topological, constituting an intermediate gapless stage in the melting of a crystal into a gapped topological Haldane phase. This novel scenario for topological floating phases in dipolar XXZ ladders can be investigated in on-going experiments.

Title: Exponential Change of Relaxation Rate by Quenched Disorder
Authors: Jan Meibohm, Sabine H. L. Klapp
Abstract: We determine the asymptotic relaxation rate of a Brownian particle in a harmonic potential perturbed by quenched Gaussian disorder, a simplified model for rugged energy landscapes in complex systems. Depending on the properties of the disorder, we show that the mean and variance of the asymptotic relaxation rate are non-monotonous functions of the parameters for a broad class of disorders. In particular, the rate of relaxation may either increase or decrease exponentially compared to the unperturbed case. This implies that disorder may, depending on its properties, both significantly speed up \textit{and} slow down relaxation. In the limit of weak disorder, we derive the probability distribution of the asymptotic relaxation rate and show that it is Gaussian, with analytic expressions for the mean and variance that feature universal limits. Our findings indicate that controlled disorder may serve to tune the relaxation speed in complex systems.

Title: Electrical resistivity, thermal conductivity, and viscosity of Fe-H alloys at Earth's core conditions
Authors: Cong Liu, Ronald Cohen
Abstract: The transport properties (electrical resistivity, thermal conductivity, and viscosity) of iron-hydrogen alloys are of great significance in the stability and evolution of planetary magnetic fields. Here, we investigate the thermal transport properties of iron doped with varying hydrogen content as functions of pressure (P) and temperature (T) for the top and bottom of Earth's outer core and beyond, corresponding to pressures of about 130 to 300 GPa and temperatures of 4000 to 7000 K. Using first-principles density functional theory molecular dynamic simulations (FPMD), we verify that crystalline FeH$_x$ is superionic with H diffusing freely. We find a low frequency viscosity of 10-11 mPa$\cdot$s for liquid Fe-H alloys at Earth's outer core conditions. We find saturation of electrical resistivity with increasing temperatures in liquid iron at outer core conditions. The effect of H on electrical and thermal transport we find is small, so that the exact H content of the core is not needed. The primary effect of H is on the equation of state, decreasing the density at constant P and T. We find the Lorenz number is smaller than the ideal value, and obtain for X(H)= 0.20, or 0.45 wt% H , thermal conductivity $\kappa$ of $\sim$105 and $\sim$190 $Wm^{-1}K^{-1}$, respectively, at conditions near the core-mantle and inner-outer core boundary.

Title: Impurity States in Altermagnetic Superconductors
Authors: Andrea Maiani, Rubén Seoane Souto
Abstract: Altermagnetic superconductors offer the possibility of exploring unconventional superconductivity, including topological states and finite-momentum superconductivity, with promising applications in spintronics and quantum information. However, a direct experimental confirmation of their existence remains elusive. In this work, we propose non-magnetic impurities as probes of the interplay between altermagnetism and superconductivity. These impurities induce spin-polarized subgap states whose spatial extension reflects the magnetic order of the substrate material. Depending on whether the impurity respects the bulk symmetries or not, these states form spin-degenerate or spin-split doublets. An external magnetic field aligned with the Néel vector can further control the doublet splitting. We further demonstrate that coupling between impurity states leads to a position-dependent, spin-sensitive hybridization, enabling a new approach for in-situ control of atomic-size quantum devices. These findings provide unambiguous experimental signatures of altermagnetic superconductivity accessible via local measurements like scanning tunneling microscopy and open new avenues for designing tunable quantum materials.

Title: Synchronization of wave-propelled capillary spinners
Authors: Jack-William Barotta, Giuseppe Pucci, Eli Silver, Alireza Hooshanginejad, Daniel M. Harris
Abstract: When a millimetric body is placed atop a vibrating liquid bath, the relative motion between the object and interface generates outward propagating waves with an associated momentum flux. Prior work has shown that isolated chiral objects, referred to as spinners, can thus rotate steadily in response to their self-generated wavefield. Here, we consider the case of two co-chiral spinners held at a fixed spacing from one another but otherwise free to interact hydrodynamically through their shared fluid substrate. Two identical spinners are able to synchronize their rotation, with their equilibrium phase difference sensitive to their spacing and initial conditions, and even cease to rotate when the coupling becomes sufficiently strong. Non-identical spinners can also find synchrony provided their intrinsic differences are not too disparate. A hydrodynamic wave model of the spinner interaction is proposed, recovering all salient features of the experiment. In all cases, the spatially periodic nature of the capillary wave coupling is directly reflected in the emergent equilibrium behaviors.

Title: Low-energy critical behavior in two-dimensional tilted semi-Dirac semimetals driven by fermion-fermion interactions
Authors: Wen Liu, Wen-Hao Bian, Xiao-Zhuo Chu, Jing Wang
Abstract: Employing the renormalization group approach, we carefully investigate the critical behavior of two-dimensional tilted semi-Dirac semimetals induced by the fermion-fermion interactions in the low-energy regime. After incorporating all one-loop corrections, we derive the coupled RG equations of all related parameters and introduce two distinct strategies, named as Strategy I and Strategy II, to describe different scenarios. A detailed numerical analysis yields several interesting behavior in the low-energy limit. At first, we notice that the fermion-fermion interactions either vanish or diverge in the Strategy I, depending on the initial values of the tilting parameter and the fermionic couplings, whereas these interactions in the Strategy II always diverge at a certain critical energy scale, which is associated with the initial conditions. Next, the microstructural parameter $\alpha$ and the fermion velocity $v_F$ in the Strategy I share the similar behavior with their Strategy II counterparts. It is observed that fermion-fermion interactions lead to an increase in $\alpha$ while driving a decrease in $v_F$. Furthermore, the system can either be attracted by the Gaussian fixed point (GFP) or certain relatively fixed point (RFP) in the Strategy I. However, it always flow towards the RFP in the Strategy II at the lowest-energy limit. These results would provide helpful insights into the studies on observable quantities and phase transitions in the two-dimensional tilted semi-Dirac semimetals and the analogous semimetals.

Title: Shape of a membrane on a liquid interface with arbitrary curvatures
Authors: Zachariah S. Schrecengost, Seif Hejazine, Jordan V. Barrett, Vincent Démery, Joseph D. Paulsen
Abstract: We study the deformation of a liquid interface with arbitrary principal curvatures by a flat circular sheet. Working first at small slopes, we determine the shape of the sheet analytically in the membrane limit, where the sheet is inextensible yet free to bend and compress. We find that the sheet takes a cylindrical shape on interfaces with negative Gaussian curvature. On interfaces with positive Gaussian curvature, an inner region still adopts a cylindrical shape while the outer region is under azimuthal compression. Numerical energy minimization confirm our predictions and show that this behavior holds for finite slopes. Experiments on a thin polystyrene film at an anisotropic air-water interface show consistent behaviors.

Title: Measuring Non-Hermitian Topological Invariants Directly from Quench Dynamics
Authors: Xiao-Dong Lin, Long Zhang
Abstract: While non-Hermitian (NH) topological phases and phenomena have been observed across various quantum systems, directly measuring NH topological invariants remains a significant challenge. In this study, we present a generic and unified framework for the direct measurement of various NH topological invariants in odd-dimensional systems through quench dynamics. We demonstrate that in one-dimensional (1D) NH systems with sublattice symmetry, the line-gap winding number and point-gap braiding degree can be extracted from the winding patterns of a dynamically constructed field based on post-quench spin textures. Specifically, line-gap topology is characterized by integer-valued winding, whereas point-gap complex-band braiding is revealed by half-integer or integer winding with abrupt jumps. We also extend our approach to higher-dimensional winding numbers and non-Bloch topological invariants under open-boundary conditions. Additionally, we propose a practical cold-atom setup to realize and detect 1D NH topological phases, showing that our dynamical measurement scheme is feasible in current experimental settings. This work paves the way for the direct measurement of NH topological invariants in quantum systems.

Title: Synchronization and self-assembly of free capillary spinners
Authors: Nilgun Sungar, John Sharpe, Loic Ijzerman, Jack-William Barotta
Abstract: Chiral active particles are able to draw energy from the environment to self-propel in the form of rotation. We describe an experimental arrangement wherein chiral objects, spinners, floating on the surface of a vibrated fluid rotate due to emitted capillary waves. We observe that pairs of spinners can assemble at quantized distances via the mutually generated wavefield, phase synchronize and, in some circumstances, globally rotate about a point midway between them. A mathematical model based on wave-mediated interactions captures the salient features of the assembly and synchronization while a qualitative argument is able to rationalize global rotations based on interference and radiation stress associated with the wavefield. Extensions to larger collections are demonstrated, highlighting the potential for this tabletop system to be used as an experimental system capable of synchronizing and swarming.

Title: Topological Hall-like behavior of multidomain ferromagnets
Authors: Houssam Sabri, Benjamin E. Carlson, Sergey S. Pershoguba, Jiadong Zang
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of topological Hall-like (THE-like) signals in disordered multidomain ferromagnets. Non-monotonic behavior in Hall resistivity, commonly attributed to topological spin textures such as skyrmions, is produced in a random resistor network model without any chirality. It arises from simple mechanisms of the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in combination with the domain wall scattering. By varying domain configurations and domain wall resistances, we explore the conditions under which the non-monotonic resistivity can be enhanced. Our results emphasize the need for careful analysis in distinguishing between true topological Hall effects and artifacts caused by domain disorders.

Title: Quantum transport of Dirac fermions in selected graphene nanosystems away from the charge-neutrality point
Authors: Adam Rycerz
Abstract: Peculiar electronic properties of graphene, including the universal dc conductivity and the pseudodiffusive shot noise, are usually attributed to a small vicinity of the charge-neutrality point, away from which electron's effective mass raises, and nanostructures in graphene start to behave similarly to familiar Sharvin contacts in semiconducting heterostructures hosting two-dimensional electron gas. Using the effective Dirac equation for low-energy excitations it can be shown that, as long as abrupt potential steps separate the sample area from the leads, graphene-specific features can be identified even relatively far from the charge-neutrality point. Namely, the conductance is reduced, comparing to the standard Sharvin value, whereas the shot noise is amplified. Here, we confront the results of earlier analytic considerations with numerical simulations of quantum transport on the honeycomb lattice, for selected systems for which considerations starting from the Dirac equation cannot be directly adapted. For a wedge-shape constriction with zigzag edges and approximately square shape of the narrowest section, the transport characteristics can be tuned from graphene-specific sub-Sharvin values to standard Sharvin values, depending on whether the electrostatic potential profile in the narrowest section is rectangular or smooth. The half-Corbino disk with rectangular potential profile exhibits both the conductance and the noise close to the sub-Sharvin values. For a circular quantum dot with two narrow openings and irregular edges, the conductance is close to the Sharvin value, and the Fano factor approaches the value of $F=1/4$. This suggests that, in experimental attempt to verify the predictions for sub-Sharvin transport regime, one should focus rather on nanosystems, for which the scatterings on edges are insignificant next to the scatterings on sample-lead interfaces.

Title: Friedel oscillations and chiral superconductivity in monolayer NbSe$_2$
Authors: Julian Siegl, Anton Bleibaum, Wen Wan, Marcin Kurpas, John Schliemann, Miguel M. Ugeda, Magdalena Marganska, Milena Grifoni
Abstract: In 1965 Kohn and Luttinger proposed a genuine electronic mechanism for superconductivity. Despite the bare electrostatic interaction between two electrons being repulsive, in a metal electron-hole fluctuations can give rise to Friedel oscillations of the screened Coulomb potential. Cooper pairing among the electrons then emerges when taking advantage of the attractive regions. The nature of the leading pairing mechanism in some two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides is still debated. Focusing on NbSe$_2$, we show that superconductivity can be induced by the Coulomb interaction when accounting for screening effects on the trigonal lattice with multiple orbitals. Using ab initio-based tight-binding parametrizations for the relevant low-energy d-bands, we evaluate the screened interaction microscopically, in a scheme including Bloch overlaps. In the direct space, we find long-range Friedel oscillations alternating in sign, a key to the Kohn-Luttinger mechanism. The momentum-resolved gap equations predict two degenerate solutions at the critical temperature Tc, signaling the unconventional nature of the pairing. Their complex linear combination, i.e., a chiral gap with p-like symmetry, provides the ground state of the system. Our prediction of a fully gapped chiral phase well below Tc is in excellent agreement with the spectral function extracted from tunneling spectroscopy measurements of single-layer NbSe$_2$.

Title: Enhancing creep resistance in refractory high-entropy alloys: role of grain size and local chemical order
Authors: Saifuddin Zafar, Mashaekh Tausif Ehsan, Sourav Das Suvro, Mohammad Nasim Hasan, Mahmudul Islam
Abstract: Refractory high-entropy alloys (RHEAs) are a promising class of materials with potential applications in extreme environments, where the dominant failure mode is thermal creep. The design of these alloys, therefore, requires an understanding of how their microstructure and local chemical distribution affect creep behavior. In this study, we performed high-fidelity atomistic simulations using machine-learning interatomic potentials to explore the creep deformation of MoNbTaW RHEAs under a wide range of stress and temperature conditions. We parametrized grain size and local chemical order (LCO) to investigate the effects of these two important design variables, which are controllable during the alloy fabrication process. Our investigation revealed that resistance to creep deformation is enhanced by larger grain sizes and higher levels of LCO. This study highlights the importance of utilizing LCO in conjunction with other microstructural properties when designing RHEAs for extreme environment applications.

Title: Electronic Structure, mass fluctuation, and Localized Bond Properties of two-dimensional double-layer transition metal chalcogenide MX$_2$ (M = Mo, W; X = S, Se, Te) Calculated Based on Density Functional Theory and BBC model
Authors: Yaorui Tan, Maolin Bo
Abstract: This study systematically investigates the electronic structure and bonding properties of two-dimensional bilayer transition metal chalcogenides MX2 (M = Mo, W; X = S, Se, Te) using density functional theory calculations. By analyzing band gaps, deformation bond energies, and non-Hermitian bonding characteristics across various MX2 compounds, we comprehensively examine their electronic properties and chemical bonding behavior. The results reveal that charge transfer plays a crucial role in electron mass fluctuations, with topological geometric analysis further confirming the impact of mass variations on atomic bonding and electronic states. These findings provide a theoretical foundation for advancing the application of these materials.

Title: Andreev non-Hermitian Hamiltonian for open Josephson junctions from Green's functions
Authors: Roberto Capecelatro, Marco Marciani, Gabriele Campagnano, Procolo Lucignano
Abstract: We investigate the transport properties of open Josephson junctions (JJs) through a minimal effective non-Hermitian (NH) approach derived from the equilibrium Green's function (GF) formalism. Specifically, we consider a JJ with a quantum dot barrier coupled to a normal metal reservoir. The coupling introduces an imaginary self-energy term in the JJ Hamiltonian which can be naturally accounted for in the NH formalism. While most approaches to similar problems work with the full junction Hamiltonian we propose a scheme for deriving an effective NH Hamiltonian for the Andreev levels only, that we compute from the singular part of the barrier GF. To establish the range of applicability of this NH model we benchmark our results for both the dot density of states and the supercurrent against exact GF predictions in different transport regimes. We find that, as a rule of thumb, the Andreev NH description is accurate when the spectral overlap between the Andreev bound states (ABS) and the near-gap continuum states is negligible, i.e. when the ABS energies lie sufficiently far from the superconducting gap relative to their line-width. This method not only highlights the effective physics of the JJ but also offers a scalable framework for studying large-size devices.

Title: Machine Learned Potential for High-Throughput Phonon Calculations of Metal-Organic Frameworks

Persson (2,3) ((1) Scientific Computing Department, Science and Technology Facilities Council, Cheshire, UK, (2) Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of California Berkley, California, USA, (3) Materials Sciences Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, California, USA)
Abstract: Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are highly porous and versatile materials studied extensively for applications such as carbon capture and water harvesting. However, computing phonon-mediated properties in MOFs, like thermal expansion and mechanical stability, remains challenging due to the large number of atoms per unit cell, making traditional Density Functional Theory (DFT) methods impractical for high-throughput screening. Recent advances in machine learning potentials have led to foundation atomistic models, such as MACE-MP-0, that accurately predict equilibrium structures but struggle with phonon properties of MOFs. In this work, we developed a workflow for computing phonons in MOFs within the quasi-harmonic approximation with a fine-tuned MACE model, MACE-MP-MOF0. The model was trained on a curated dataset of 127 representative and diverse MOFs. The fine-tuned MACE-MP-MOF0 improves the accuracy of phonon density of states and corrects the imaginary phonon modes of MACE-MP-0, enabling high-throughput phonon calculations with state-of-the-art precision. The model successfully predicts thermal expansion and bulk moduli in agreement with DFT and experimental data for several well-known MOFs. These results highlight the potential of MACE-MP-MOF0 in guiding MOF design for applications in energy storage and thermoelectrics.

Title: Electrically Tunable Interband Collective Excitations in Biased Bilayer and Trilayer Graphene
Authors: Tomer Eini, M. F. C. Martins Quintela, J. C. G. Henriques, R. M. Ribeiro, Yarden Mazor, N. M. R. Peres, Itai Epstein
Abstract: Collective excitations of charged particles under the influence of an electromagnetic field give rise to a rich variety of hybrid light-matter quasiparticles with unique properties. In metals, intraband collective response manifested by negative permittivity leads to plasmon-polaritons with extreme field confinement, wavelength squeezing, and potentially low propagation losses. In contrast, photons in semiconductors commonly couple to interband collective response in the form of exciton polaritons, which give rise to completely different polaritonic properties, described by a superposition of the photon and exciton and an anti-crossing of the eigenstates. In this work, we identify the existence of plasmon-like collective excitations originating from the interband excitonic response of biased bilayer and trilayer graphene, in the form of graphene-exciton-polaritons (GEPs). We find that GEPs possess electrically tunable polaritonic properties and discover that such excitations follow a universal dispersion law for all surface polaritons in 2D excitonic systems. Accounting for nonlocal corrections to the excitonic response, we find that the GEPs exhibit confinement factors that can exceed those of graphene plasmons, and with moderate losses. These predictions of plasmon-like interband collective excitations in biased graphene systems open up new research avenues for tunable polaritonic phenomena based on excitonic systems, and the ability to control and manipulate such phenomena at the atomic scale.

Title: Anomalous Continuous Translations
Authors: Nathan Seiberg
Abstract: We discuss a large class of non-relativistic continuum field theories where the Euclidean spatial symmetry of the classical theory is violated in the quantum theory by an Adler-Bell-Jackiw-like anomaly. In particular, the continuous translation symmetry of the classical theory is broken in the quantum theory to a discrete symmetry. Furthermore, that discrete symmetry is extended by an internal symmetry, making it non-Abelian. This presentation streamlines and extends the discussion in [1]. In an Appendix, we present an elementary introduction to 't Hooft and Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomalies using a well-known system.

Abstract: The dynamic magnetic properties of Full Heusler alloy thin films of Co$_2$FeGe, grown on MgO (001) substrates under different thermal conditions, were investigated. Brillouin light scattering and ferromagnetic resonance measurements revealed that depositing at room temperature followed by annealing at 300 deg C for 1 hour produces the best results for maximizing magnetization, exchange stiffness, and minimizing spin-dynamic dissipation in the films, which are desirable characteristics for high-speed spintronic devices. Additionally, strong hybridization of spin waves in the Damon-Eshbach geometry was observed, which is attractive for applications in magnonic signal processing circuits.

Title: Boundary layers, transport and universal distribution in boundary driven active systems
Authors: Pritha Dolai, Arghya Das
Abstract: We discuss analytical results for a run-and-tumble particle (RTP) in one dimension in presence of boundary reservoirs. It exhibits `kinetic boundary layers', nonmonotonous distribution, violation of Fourier's law, diffusion facilitated current reversal and optimisation on tuning dynamical parameters, and a Seebeck-like effect in the steady state. The spatial and internal degrees of freedom together possess a symmetry, using which we find the eigenspectrum for large systems. The eigenvalues are arranged in two bands which can mix in certain conditions resulting in a crossover in the relaxation. The late time distribution for large systems is obtained analytically; it retains a strong and often dominant `active' contribution in the bulk rendering an effective passive-like description inadequate. A nontrivial `Milne length' also emerges in the dynamics. Finally, a novel universality is proposed in the absorbing boundary problem for dynamics with short-ranged colored noise. Active particles driven by active reservoirs may thus provide a common physical ground for diverse and new nonequilibrium phenomena.

Title: Relationship between polymorphic structures and magnetic properties of La$_{2-x}A'_{x}$Ni$_{7}$ compounds ($A$' = Sm, Gd)
Authors: Valérie Paul-Boncour, Véronique Charbonnier, Nicolas Madern, Lotfi Bessais, Judith Monnier, Junxian Zhang
Abstract: In this study, the crystal structure and magnetic properties of La$_{2-x} A'_{x}$Ni$_{7}$ compounds with magnetic rare earth elements ($A$' = Sm, Gd) have been investigated combining X-ray powder diffraction and magnetic measurements. These intergrowth compounds crystallize in a mixture of 2$H$ hexagonal (Ce$_{2}$Ni$_{7}$-type) and 3$R$ rhombohedral (Gd$_{2}$Co$_{7}$-type) polymorphic structures which are related to the stacking of [$AB_{5}$] and [$A_{2}B_{4}$] subunits along the $c$-this http URL average cell volume decreases linearly versus $A$' content, whereas the $c/a$ ratio reaches a minimum at $x$ = 1, due to geometric constraints upon $A$' for La substitution between the two different subunits. The magnetic properties strongly depend on the structure type and the $A$' content. Hexagonal La$_{2}$Ni$_{7}$ is a weak antiferromagnet (wAFM) at low field and temperature and undergoes metamagnetic transitions towards weak ferromagnetic state (wFM) under applied field. Under an applied field of 0.1 T, La$_{2-x}A'_{x}$Ni$_{7}$ intermetallic compounds display two different transition temperatures $T_{1}$ and $T_{2}$ that both increase with $x$. $T_{1}$ is associated with a wFM-wAFM transition in the 2$H$ phase for $A$'= Sm, whereas $T_{2}$ is related to the Curie temperature of both 2$H$ and 3$R$ phases. A metamagnetic behaviour is observed between $T_{1}$ and $T_{2}$ with transition field $\mu_{0}H_{Trans}$ between 2 and 3.5 T for compounds with $A$' = Sm. The La$_{2-x}Sm_{x}$Ni$_{7}$ compounds ($x$ > 0} behave as hard magnets with a large coercive field $\mu_{0}H_{C}$ at low temperature ($\mu_{0}H_{C}$ > 9 T at 5 K for $x$ = 2), whereas the La$_{2-x} Gd_{x}$Ni$_{7}$ compounds ($x$ > 0) are soft ferrimagnets with a linear increase of the saturation magnetization versus Gd content.

Title: Thoughts about boosting superconductivity
Authors: Dirk van der Marel
Abstract: In a superconductor electrons form pairs despite the Coulomb repulsion as a result of an effective attractive interaction mediated by, for example phonons. In the present paper DeGennes' description of the dynamically screened Coulomb interaction is adopted for the effective interaction. This model is generalized by including the elastic response of the charge-compensating background and the BCS gap equation is solved for the resulting effective electron-electron interaction. It is demonstrated that the superconducting critical temperature becomes strongly enhanced when the material is tuned close to a structural instability.

Title: Emulating Novel Topological Phases with Ultracold Fermions in Optical Lattices
Authors: Zhi Lin, Qi Song, Sheng Yue, Ming Yang, Jie Lou, Yan Chen
Abstract: We propose a feasible scheme utilizing the Floquet engineering platform with ultracold atoms in optical lattices to emulate both pair-hopping processes and singlet/triplet pairing interactions, aiming to simulate and control novel topologically nontrivial phases. Our large-scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations reveal three distinct topological regimes: (i) a Majorana-enabled spin-density-wave (MS) phase characterized by exponentially localized edge charges, non-local single-fermion edge correlations, a doubly degenerate entanglement spectrum; (ii) a $z$-axis polarized triplet superconducting (TS) phase manifesting fractionalized edge spin; and (iii) a novel x-directional triplet superconducting (XTS) phase exhibiting fractional edge spins along the $x$-direction and non-local single-particle edge correlations, merging characteristics of the edge states from both MS and TS phases. Therefore, our work establishes a versatile framework for exploring exotic quantum phases and non-Abelian edge states in number-conserving systems.

Title: Spin Pumping in Magnetostrictive Galfenol Interfaced with Ta
Authors: Ajit Kumar Sahoo, Suchetana Mukhopadhyay, Bikram Baghira, Jeyaramane Arout Chelvane, Jyoti Ranjan Mohanty, Anjan Barman
Abstract: In view of their advantages for memory and storage applications, the quest to find suitable magnetic thin film heterostructures that can exhibit strong spin pumping effect persists in the scientific community. Here, the spin pumping phenomenon is investigated in Ta/Galfenol (FeGa) thin film heterostructures by systematically varying the thickness of the heavy metallic Ta underlayer (UL). The films exhibit soft magnetic property with a bcc-phase with a notably low Gilbert damping obtained for FeGa on Si (100). The precessional magnetization dynamics of Ta/FeGa films are explored using time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect magnetometry, revealing the presence of a resonant Kittel mode and additional strain-induced modes. The lowest value of effective Gilbert damping in Ta/FeGa is obtained as ~ 0.015, which rises by ~ 65 % as the thickness of UL increases. Spin pumping and two-magnon scattering mechanisms are validated using a ballistic spin transport model. An overall effective spin mixing conductance value of ~ 5.48 $\times$ 10$^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$ is found, which is the highest value ever reported in magnetostrictive Galfenol films. Additionally, micromagnetic simulations are performed to understand the effect of tilted magnetic anisotropy on the formation of magnetic modes in these films. These findings in FeGa films establish it as an effective spin source material and offer innovative ideas to control spin-wave propagation and diverse applications in straintronics.

Title: Giant vortex in a harmonically-trapped rotating dipolar $^{164}$Dy condensate
Authors: Luis E. Young-S., S. K. Adhikari
Abstract: We demonstrate the formation of dynamically stable giant vortices in a harmonically-trapped strongly dipolar $^{164}$Dy Bose-Einstein condensate under rotation around the polarization direction of dipolar atoms, employing the numerical solution of an improved mean-field model including a Lee-Huang-Yang-type interaction, meant to stop a collapse at high atom density. These giant vortices are stationary, obtainable by imaginary-time propagation using a Gaussian initial state, while the appropriate phase of the giant vortex is imprinted on the initial wave function. The dynamical stability of the giant vortices is established by real-time propagation during a long interval of time after a small change of a parameter.

Title: Finite-time blowup of a Brownian particle in a repulsive potential
Authors: P. L. Krapivsky, Baruch Meerson
Abstract: We consider a Brownian particle performing an overdamped motion in a power-law repulsive potential. If the potential grows with the distance faster than quadratically, the particle escapes to infinity in a finite time. We determine the average blowup time and study the probability distribution of the blowup time. In particular, we show that the long-time tail of this probability distribution decays purely exponentially, while the short-time tail exhibits an essential singularity. These qualitative features turn out to be quite universal, as they occur for all rapidly growing power-law potentials in arbitrary spatial dimensions. The quartic potential is especially tractable, and we analyze it in more detail.

Title: Finite-rate quench in disordered Chern and $Z_2$ topological insulators
Authors: Shengnan Du, Zhao Liu
Abstract: We study quantum quench of finite rate across topological quantum transitions in two-dimensional Chern and $Z_2$ topological insulators. We choose the representative Haldane model and the Kane-Mele model to investigate the behavior of excitation density generated by the quench and the impact of disorder on it. For the Haldane model, as long as the spectral gap is not closed by disorder, we find the excitation density at the end of the quench obeys the power-law decay with decreasing quench rate, consistent with the prediction of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. By contrast, the anti-Kibble-Zurek behavior of excitation density, namely larger excitation density at slower quench, is observed in disordered Kane-Mele model, which we attribute to the existence of a disorder-induced gapless region. Moreover, we demonstrate that particle's onsite occupation can be used as a local measurable quantity to probe the breakdown of adiabatic evolution. The difference of onsite occupation between the time-evolved state and instantaneous ground state at the end of the quench exhibits similar dependence on the quench rate as the excitation density for both the Haldane and Kane-Mele models. This similarity still holds in the bulk of the system even when we consider realistic open boundary conditions, facilitating the experimental characterization of the dynamic features in these models.

Authors: Daniel Werner, Enrico Arrigoni
Abstract: We present a functional interpolation approach within the auxiliary master equation framework to efficiently and accurately solve correlated impurity problems in nonequilibrium dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT). By leveraging a near-exact auxiliary bath representation, the method estimates corrections via interpolation over a few bath realisations, significantly reducing computational cost and increasing accuracy. We illustrate the approach on the Anderson impurity model and on the Hubbard model within DMFT, capturing equilibrium and long-lived photodoped states.

Title: Agnostic calculation of atomic free energies with the descriptor density of states
Authors: Thomas D Swinburne, Clovis Lapointe, Mihai-Cosmin Marinica
Abstract: We present a new method to evaluate vibrational free energies of atomic systems without a priori specification of an interatomic potential. Our model-agnostic approach leverages descriptors, high-dimensional feature vectors of atomic structure. The entropy of a high-dimensional density, the descriptor density of states, is accurately estimated with conditional score matching. Casting interatomic potentials into a form extensive in descriptor features, we show free energies emerge as the Legendre-Fenchel conjugate of the descriptor entropy, avoiding all high-dimensional integration. The score matching campaign requires less resources than fixed-model sampling and is highly parallel, reducing wall time to a few minutes, with tensor compression schemes allowing lightweight storage. Our model-agnostic estimator returns differentiable free energy predictions over a broad range of potential parameters in microseconds of CPU effort, allowing rapid forward and back propagation of potential variations through finite temperature simulations, long desired for uncertainty quantification and inverse design. We test predictions against thermodynamic integration calculations over a broad range of models for BCC, FCC and A15 phases of W, Mo and Fe at high homologous temperatures. Predictions pass the stringent accuracy threshold of 1-2 meV/atom (1/40-1/20 kcal/mol) for phase prediction with propagated score uncertainties robustly bounding errors. We also demonstrate targeted fine-tuning, reducing the alpha-gamma transition temperature in a non-magnetic machine learning model of Fe from 2030 K to 1063 K through back-propagation, with no additional sampling. Applications to liquids and fine-tuning foundational models are discussed along with the many problems in computational science which estimate high-dimensional integrals.

Title: Robust Prediction of Frictional Contact Network in Near-Jamming Suspensions Employing Deep Graph Neural Networks
Authors: Armin Aminimajd, Joao Maia, Abhinendra Singh
Abstract: The viscosity of the suspension consisting of fine particles dispersed in a Newtonian liquid diverges close to the jamming packing fraction. The contact microstructure in suspensions governs this macroscopic behavior in the vicinity of jamming through a frictional contact network (FCN). FCN is composed of mechanical load-bearing contacts that lead to the emergence of rigidity near the jamming transition. The stress transmission and network topology, in turn, depend sensitively on constraints on the relative motion of the particles. Despite their significance, predicting the FCN, especially close to jamming conditions, remains challenging due to experimental and computational impediments. This study introduces a cost-effective machine learning approach to predict the FCN using a graph neural network (GNN), which inherently captures hidden features and underlying patterns in dense suspension by mapping interparticle interactions. Employing a variation of GNN called the Deep Graph Convolutional Network (DeepGCN) trained on data-driven simulations, this study demonstrates robust generalization and extrapolation capabilities, accurately predicting FCNs in systems with divergent flow parameters and phase spaces, despite each being trained exclusively on a single condition. The study covers a wide range of phase space, from semi-dilute to jammed states, spanning transient to steady states, while systematically varying parameters such as shear stress (${\sigma}_{xy}$), packing fraction(${\phi}$) and sliding and rolling friction (${{\mu}_s, {\mu}_r}$). The results of this research pave the way for innovative transferable techniques in predicting the properties of particulate systems, offering new avenues for advancement in material science and related fields.

Title: Surface detachment and bed entrainment of fluvial plastics
Authors: Matthias Kramer
Abstract: Over the last decade, fluvial plastics have been identified as major threat to aquatic environments and human health. In order to develop adequate mitigation strategies for plastic pollution, a fundamental process understanding of riverine plastic transport is of significant importance. In this context, the implementation of research findings into numerical simulation environments is anticipated to enhance modelling capabilities and to support a rigorous decision making. Recent experimental research has focused on the incipient motion of plastic particles, as well as on the effects of surface tension on plastic concentration profiles. While these investigations have advanced the state-of-the-art knowledge, current literature still displays a lack of basic insights into layer-specific plastic transport physics. In this study, first principles are applied to advance knowledge on free-surface detachment and bed entrainment of fluvial plastics. A novel relationship for the critical surface detachment velocity is derived, followed by the development of a framework that allows to relate plastic Shields parameters to those of natural sediments. Overall, it is anticipated that these developments will trigger new research within the plastics community, and it is hoped that present findings will be implemented into Lagrangian particle tracking software.

Title: Benchmarking Quantum Red TEA on CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs
Authors: Daniel Jaschke, Marco Ballarin, Nora Reinić, Luka Pavešić, Simone Montangero
Abstract: We benchmark simulations of many-body quantum systems on heterogeneous hardware platforms using CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs. We compare different linear algebra backends, e.g., NumPy versus the PyTorch, JAX, or TensorFlow libraries, as well as a mixed-precision-inspired approach and optimizations for the target hardware. Quantum Red TEA out of the Quantum TEA library specifically addresses handling tensors with different libraries or hardware, where the tensors are the building blocks of tensor network algorithms. The benchmark problem is a variational search of a ground state in an interacting model. This is a ubiquitous problem in quantum many-body physics, which we solve using tensor network methods. This approximate state-of-the-art method compresses quantum correlations which is key to overcoming the exponential growth of the Hilbert space as a function of the number of particles. We present a way to obtain speedups of a factor of 34 when tuning parameters on the CPU, and an additional factor of 2.76 on top of the best CPU setup when migrating to GPUs.

Title: Formation of Representations in Neural Networks
Authors: Liu Ziyin, Isaac Chuang, Tomer Galanti, Tomaso Poggio
Abstract: Understanding neural representations will help open the black box of neural networks and advance our scientific understanding of modern AI systems. However, how complex, structured, and transferable representations emerge in modern neural networks has remained a mystery. Building on previous results, we propose the Canonical Representation Hypothesis (CRH), which posits a set of six alignment relations to universally govern the formation of representations in most hidden layers of a neural network. Under the CRH, the latent representations (R), weights (W), and neuron gradients (G) become mutually aligned during training. This alignment implies that neural networks naturally learn compact representations, where neurons and weights are invariant to task-irrelevant transformations. We then show that the breaking of CRH leads to the emergence of reciprocal power-law relations between R, W, and G, which we refer to as the Polynomial Alignment Hypothesis (PAH). We present a minimal-assumption theory proving that the balance between gradient noise and regularization is crucial for the emergence of the canonical representation. The CRH and PAH lead to an exciting possibility of unifying major key deep learning phenomena, including neural collapse and the neural feature ansatz, in a single framework.

Abstract: We introduce a model of randomly connected neural populations and study its dynamics by means of the dynamical mean-field theory and simulations. Our analysis uncovers a rich phase diagram, featuring high- and low-dimensional chaotic phases, separated by a crossover region characterized by low values of the maximal Lyapunov exponent and participation ratio dimension, but with high values of the Lyapunov dimension that change significantly across the region. Counterintuitively, chaos can be attenuated by either adding noise to strongly modular connectivity or by introducing modularity into random connectivity. Extending the model to include a multilevel, hierarchical connectivity reveals that a loose balance between activities across levels drives the system towards the edge of chaos.

Title: Machine learning for cerebral blood vessels' malformations
Authors: Irem Topal, Alexander Cherevko, Yuri Bugay, Maxim Shishlenin, Jean Barbier, Deniz Eroglu, Édgar Roldán, Roman Belousov
Abstract: Cerebral aneurysms and arteriovenous malformations are life-threatening hemodynamic pathologies of the brain. While surgical intervention is often essential to prevent fatal outcomes, it carries significant risks both during the procedure and in the postoperative period, making the management of these conditions highly challenging. Parameters of cerebral blood flow, routinely monitored during medical interventions or with modern noninvasive high-resolution imaging methods, could potentially be utilized in machine learning-assisted protocols for risk assessment and therapeutic prognosis. To this end, we developed a linear oscillatory model of blood velocity and pressure for clinical data acquired from neurosurgical operations. Using the method of Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy), the parameters of our model can be reconstructed online within milliseconds from a short time series of the hemodynamic variables. The identified parameter values enable automated classification of the blood-flow pathologies by means of logistic regression, achieving an accuracy of 73 \%}. Our results demonstrate the potential of this model for both diagnostic and prognostic applications, providing a robust and interpretable framework for assessing cerebral blood vessel conditions.

Title: Toolkit for General 2d Scalar Potential in LCT
Authors: A. Liam Fitzpatrick, Emanuel Katz, Yuan Xin
Abstract: We present efficient algorithms for obtaining the Hamiltonian in Lightcone Conformal Truncation (LCT) for a 2d scalar field with a generic potential. We apply this method to the sine-Gordon and sinh-Gordon models in $1+1d$, and find precise agreement with integrability results when the scaling dimension $\Delta$ of the deforming cosine/cosinh potential is in the range $ \Delta \leq 1$. The agreement provides additional evidence for a recent conjecture for how to compute the effective lightcone Hamiltonian in this class of models. In addition, to high precision, we provide the first direct confirmation for the conjectured self-duality of the sinh-Gordon model ($\Delta < 0)$, which relates $\Delta \leftrightarrow 4/\Delta$. As the dimension approaches the upper limit $\Delta=1$ from below, we show analytically that the Hamiltonian matrix elements exactly reproduce those of a free Majorana fermion, demonstrating how bosonization is manifested in the LCT basis. We comment on the possible extension of the approach to $\Delta > 1$.

Title: Physics of droplet regulation in biological cells
Authors: David Zwicker, Oliver W. Paulin, Cathelijne ter Burg
Abstract: Droplet formation has emerged as an essential concept for the spatiotemporal organisation of biomolecules in cells. However, classical descriptions of droplet dynamics based on passive liquid-liquid phase separation cannot capture the complex situations inside cells. This review discusses three general aspects that are crucial in cells: (i) biomolecules are diverse and individually complex, implying that cellular droplets posses complex internal behaviour, e.g., in terms of their material properties; (ii) the cellular environment contains many solid-like structures that droplets can wet; (iii) cells are alive and use fuel to drive processes out of equilibrium. We illustrate how these principles control droplet nucleation, growth, position, and count to unveil possible regulatory mechanisms in biological cells and other applications of phase separation.

Title: Constitutive Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (CKANs): Combining Accuracy and Interpretability in Data-Driven Material Modeling
Authors: Kian P. Abdolazizi, Roland C. Aydin, Christian J. Cyron, Kevin Linka
Abstract: Hybrid constitutive modeling integrates two complementary approaches for describing and predicting a material's mechanical behavior: purely data-driven black-box methods and physically constrained, theory-based models. While black-box methods offer high accuracy, they often lack interpretability and extrapolability. Conversely, physics-based models provide theoretical insight and generalizability but may not capture complex behaviors with the same accuracy. Traditionally, hybrid modeling has required a trade-off between these aspects. In this paper, we show how recent advances in symbolic machine learning, specifically Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), help to overcome this limitation. We introduce Constitutive Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (CKANs) as a new class of hybrid constitutive models. By incorporating a post-processing symbolification step, CKANs combine the predictive accuracy of data-driven models with the interpretability and extrapolation capabilities of symbolic expressions, bridging the gap between machine learning and physical modeling.

Title: 2064 global population crisis scenario predicted by the most general dynamic model
Authors: Alessio Zaccone, Kostya Trachenko
Abstract: There is currently no consensus on how the global population will evolve in the next decades and in the next century. The reason for this uncertainty is the absence of reliable population dynamic models. In this paper, we remedy to this situation by reporting on a population dynamic model, a single nonlinear differential equation adapted from the physics of disordered systems, which is able to mathematically describe all the various regimes encountered in the global population recorded as a function of time, over the past 12000 years until now. Regimes of simple exponential growth (Malthus), logistic (Verhulst) plateaus as well as stretched-exponential and compressed-exponential growth regimes are all reliably described by this mathematical equation in its various limits. Besides showing that this is, indeed, the most general population dynamic model, we use it to explore its solutions projected into the future. In particular, two different scenarios are predicted. In one of them, which assumes that the future evolution would continue along a similar pattern as the past decades (hence without any major global ecological crisis affecting the resource exploitation), a von Foerster-type doomsday scenario with a sudden rise of the global population to unsustainable levels could appear as early as 2078. In the opposite scenario, if a global ecological crisis were to set in today, affecting the ability to exploit resources, given the current estimates of the Earth's carrying capacity, the global population is forecasted to reduce by half by 2064. Furthermore, the proposed dynamic model provides with a new aggregated parameter (K, in the model) that can be monitored and controlled so as to avoid the doomsday scenarios.
