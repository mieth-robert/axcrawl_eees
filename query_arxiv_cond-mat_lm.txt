Title: Some remarks on the objectivity and thermodynamic consistency of Korteweg-type fluids
Authors: Peter Ván
Abstract: In this note we compare the entropy principle and the objectivity arguments in the methodologies of Dunn and Serrin [1] and in the more recent weakly nonlocal thermodynamic analysis of Korteweg-type fluids in [2]. It is concluded that the different objectivity approaches lead to the same constitutive functions, and that the difference in the thermodynamically compatible pressure tensors of perfect Korteweg fluids is due to different symmetry requirements.

Title: Nuclear spin-free 70Ge/28Si70Ge quantum well heterostructures grown on industrial SiGe-buffered wafers
Authors: P. Daoust, N. Rotaru, D. Biswas, S. Koelling, E. Rahier, A. Dubé-Valade, P. Del Vecchio, M. S. Edwards, M. Tanvir, E. Sajadi, J. Salfi, O. Moutanabbir
Abstract: The coherence of hole spin qubits in germanium planar heterostructures is limited by the hyperfine coupling to the nuclear spin bath due to 29Si and 73Ge isotopes. Thus, removing these nuclear spin-full isotopes is essential to extend the hyperfine-limited coherence times needed to implement robust quantum processors. This work demonstrates the epitaxial growth of device-grade nuclear spin-free 70Ge/28Si70Ge heterostructures on industrial SiGe buffers while minimizing the amounts of highly purified 70GeH4 and 28SiH4 used. The obtained 70Ge/28Si70Ge heterostructures exhibit a dislocation density of 5.3 x 10e6 cm-2 and an isotopic purity exceeding 99.99%, with carbon and oxygen impurities below the detection sensitivity, as revealed by atom probe tomography. Magnetotransport measurements on gated Hall bars demonstrate effective gate control of hole density in nuclear spin-free quantum wells. Negative threshold gate voltages confirm the absence of intentional doping in the wells, while Hall and Shubnikov-de Haas analyses yield consistent carrier densities (1.4 x 10e11 cm-2) and high mobilities (2.4 x 10e5 cm2/Vs). Mobility trends reveal interfacetrap- limited scattering and percolation concentration below 7 x 10e10 cm-2. These analyses, along with atomic-level studies, confirm the high quality of epitaxial 70Ge/28Si70Ge heterostructures and their relevance as a platform for long-coherence spin qubits.

Title: Mittag-Leffler Quantum Statistics and Thermodynamic Anomalies
Authors: Maryam Seifi, Zahra Ebadi, Hamzeh Agahi, Hossein Mehri-Dehnavi, Hosein Mohammadzadeh
Abstract: Building upon the framework established in our recent work [M. Seifi et al., Phys. Rev. E 111, 054114 (2025)], wherein a generalized Maxwell Boltzmann distribution was formulated using the Mittag Leffler function within the superstatistical formalism, we extend this approach to the quantum domain. Specifically, we introduce two statistical distributions,termed the Mittag Leffler Bose Einstein (MLBE) and Mittag Leffler Fermi Dirac (MLFD) distributions, constructed by generalizing the conventional Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac distributions through the Mittag-Leffler function. This generalization incorporates a deformation parameter (\alpha), which facilitates a continuous interpolation between bosonic and fermionic statistics, while inherently capturing nonequilibrium effects and generalized thermodynamic behavior. We analyze the thermodynamic geometry associated with these distributions and identify significant departures from standard statistical models. Notably, the MLBE distribution manifests a Bose-Einstein-like condensation even in the absence of interactions, whereas the MLFD distribution exhibits unconventional features, such as negative heat capacity in the low-temperature regime. These findings highlight the pivotal role of statistical deformation in determining emergent macroscopic thermodynamic phenomena.

Title: Posterior corrections for systematic distortions in atomic-resolution images from hexagonal crystals
Authors: Tyler Bortel, Peter Moeck
Abstract: Digital images from crystals, as projected from the third spatial dimension and recorded in atomic resolution with any kind of real-world microscope, feature necessarily broken symmetries of the translation-periodicity-restricted Euclidean plane. The symmetry breakings are due to both the imaging process and the real structure of the imaged crystal, with the former cause typically dominating. A posterior algorithmic reduction of the symmetry breaking in such images constitutes, thus, often a correction for many of the distortions that were introduced by the imaging processes. Numerically quantified restorations of such symmetries can, therefore, be used to demonstrate the efficacy of a newly implemented posterior correction method for atomic-resolution images from hexagonal crystals. Recently developed information theory based methods are here shown to be suitable for this purpose. Thirteen experimental atomic-resolution images from graphite and monolayer molybdenite (MoS2), as respectively obtained by scanning tunneling microscopy, atomic force microscopy in the torsional resonance mode, and aberration-corrected parallel illumination transmission electron microscopy served as test cases in our larger (in its totality so far unpublished) study, from which we quote here. The source code of the software that was used for our distortion corrections and the whole report on that study are freely available on GitHub.

Title: Dynamical Phase Transitions Across Slow and Fast Regimes in a Two-Tone Driven Duffing Resonator
Authors: Soumya S. Kumar, Javier del Pino, Letizia Catalini, Alexander Eichler, Oded Zilberberg
Abstract: The response of nonlinear resonators to multifrequency driving reveals rich dynamics beyond conventional single-tone theory. We study a Duffing resonator under bichromatic excitation and identify a competition between the two drives, governed by their detuning and relative amplitudes. In the slow-beating regime, where the tones are closely spaced, the secondary drive acts as a modulation that induces dynamical phase transitions between coexisting stationary states. We introduce the cycle-averaged amplitude as an order parameter and map the resulting phase diagram as a function of the drive detuning and amplitude ratio, capturing the pronounced asymmetry observed for blue versus red detuning in experiment. We devise a model to link the onset of these transitions to the resonance properties around the nonlinear stationary mode of the system. Our results provide a framework for controlling driven nonlinear systems, enabling state manipulation, and sensing in nanomechanical, optical, and superconducting circuit platforms.

Title: Collective excitations and divergent spin currents in non-centrosymmetric superconductors
Authors: Markus Lysne, Philipp Werner, Nikolaj Bittner
Abstract: We study the collective modes in a non-centrosymmetric superconductor with Rashba spin-orbit coupling under laser irradiation. The concept of Anderson Pseudospin Resonance allows to reveal how laser driving gives rise not only to the established resonant enhancement of the third harmonic response, but also to a resonant enhancement in the second harmonic response of the spin current. We propose a theory which explains the phenomenon without including interband transitions. The theory is corroborated by numerical simulations which incorporate interband effects and allow us to clarify the signatures of the collective modes in the long-time dynamics of the superconductor.

Title: Marginal Fermi liquids from Fermi surfaces coupled via matrix boson gas
Authors: Vibhu Mishra
Abstract: We propose a model of metallic critical point which we study at $T=0$ in the large-$N$ limit. We start with two species of fermions $c_i, f_i$, each with $N$ flavors and matrix bosons $b_{ij}$ with $N^2$ components. They interact with each other via slave-boson like interaction $\int b_{ij}^{\dagger} \, c_i^{\dagger}f_j$. The bosons have a bare dispersion of $\varepsilon_{\textbf{q}}^b = \lambda_z |\textbf{q}|^z$ and we study the problem in $d$ spatial dimensions. We show that for $d = z+1,$ the electronic self energy shows marginal Fermi liquid behavior. We first evaluate the fermionic self energy $\Sigma(i\omega)$ using the standard approximate boson self energy $\Pi(\textbf{q}, i\nu) \propto |\nu|/|\textbf{q}|$ and find that $\Sigma(i\omega) \sim \omega \ln(N/|\omega|)$ which shows a much weaker dependence on $N$ when compared with similar results from non-SYK large-$N$ Ising-nematic models. Then we evaluate $\Sigma(i\omega)$ again using a more precise form of $\Pi$ which allows us to study the interplay between $N \rightarrow \infty$ limit for which $\Sigma(i\omega) \sim \omega \ln(1/|\omega|)$, and the $\omega \rightarrow 0$ limit where we recover $\Sigma(i\omega) \sim \omega \ln(N/|\omega|)$. We also use the full bosonic self energy to obtain the correction to the bosonic specific heat as $\frac{T}{N} \ln(1/T)$. Since there are $N^2$ bosons and $N$ fermions, the bulk heat capacity for both fermions and bosons show nearly similar functional form $NVT \ln(N/T)$ and $NVT \ln(1/T)$ respectively for $T \rightarrow 0$.

Title: Nonequilibrium Macroscopic Response Relations for Counting Statistics
Authors: Jiming Zheng, Zhiyue Lu
Abstract: Understanding how macroscopic nonequilibrium systems respond to changes in external or internal parameters remains a fundamental challenge in physics. In this work, we report a parameter transitional symmetry valid for macroscopic dynamics arbitrarily far from equilibrium. The symmetry leads to exact response relations and gives meaningful expansions in both linear and short-time regimes. This framework provides a universal description of macroscopic response phenomena arbitrarily far from equilibrium - including non-stationary processes and time-dependent attractors. The theory is validated and demonstrated numerically using the Willamowski-Rossler model, which exhibits rich dynamical behaviors including limit cycles and chaos.

Title: Current Cross-Correlation Spectroscopy of Majorana Bound States
Authors: Michael Ridley, Eliahu Cohen, Christian Flindt, Riku Tuovinen
Abstract: The clock speed of topological quantum computers based on Majorana zero mode (MZM)-supporting nanoscale devices is determined by the time taken for electrons to traverse the device. We employ the time-dependent Landauer-B{ü}ttiker transport theory for current cross-lead correlations in a superconducting nanowire junction hosting MZMs. From the time-dependent quantum noise, we are able to extract traversal times for electrons crossing the system. After demonstrating a linear scaling of traversal times with nanowire length, we present a heuristic formula for the traversal times which accurately captures their behaviour. We then connect our framework to a proposed experimental verification of this discriminant between spurious and genuine MZMs utilizing time-resolved transport measurements.

Title: Exact Mapping of Nonequilibrium to Equilibrium Phase Transitions for Systems in Contact with Two Thermal Baths
Authors: Iago N. Mamede, Carlos E. Fiore, Gustavo A. L. Forão, Karel Proesmans, André P. Vieira
Abstract: We show that a large class of nonequilibrium many-body systems in contact with two thermal baths admit an exact mapping onto equivalent equilibrium systems. This mapping provides direct access to nonequilibrium phase transition points from known equilibrium results, irrespective of the model, interaction topology, or distance from equilibrium. We verify the universality of this correspondence using paradigmatic models (Ising, Potts, and Blume-Capel), and highlight distinctive features in entropy production close to critical and tricritical points. Our findings connect equilibrium and nonequilibrium statistical mechanics, with implications for microscopic thermal machines and stochastic thermodynamics.

Title: Equivalence of charged and neutral density functional formulations for correcting the many-body self-interaction of polarons
Authors: Stefano Falletta, Jennifer Coulter, Joel B. Varley, Daniel Aberg, Babak Sadigh, Boris Kozinsky, Alfredo Pasquarello
Abstract: The electron self-interaction problem in density functional theory affects the accurate modeling of polarons, particularly their localization and formation energy. Charged and neutral density functional formulations have been developed to address this issue, yet their relationship remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate their equivalence in treating the many-body self-interaction of the polaron state. In particular, we connect with each other piecewise-linear functionals based on adding an extra charge to the supercell, the pSIC approach derived from the energetics of the neutral defect with polaronic distortions in a supercell, and the unit-cell method for polarons based on electron-phonon couplings. We show that these approaches lead to the same formal expression of the self-interaction corrected energy, which is fully defined by the energetics of the neutral charge state of the charged polaronic structure. Residual differences between these methods solely arise from the achieved polaronic structure, which is affected by different treatments of electron-screening and finite-size effects. We apply these methods to a set of prototypical small hole and electron polarons, including the hole polaron in MgO, the hole polaron in $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$, the $V_\text{k}$ center in NaI, the electron polaron in BiVO$_4$, and the electron polaron in TiO$_2$. We show that the ground-state properties of polarons obtained using charged and neutral density functional formulations are in excellent agreement.

Title: Fabrication and characterization of high-Q silicon nitride membrane resonators
Authors: Atkin D. Hyatt, Oscar A. Flores, Aman R. Agrawal, Charles A. Condos, Dalziel J. Wilson
Abstract: Silicon nitride membranes are a powerful and ubiquitous optomechanical resonator technology, enabling high mechanical Q, low optical loss, and enhanced optomechanical coupling via a panoply of strain-, phononic-, and photonic-crystal engineering techniques. Fabrication and characterization of silicon nitride membranes has become a form of tacit knowledge in optomechanics research groups. Here we present a video run-through of the design, fabrication, and characterization of a contemporary silicon nitride membrane resonator (specifically, a centimeter-scale Si3N4 nanoribbon supporting $Q>10^8$ torsion modes). Our tutorial can serve as a starting point or refresher for practitioners in the field.

Title: Beyond Spin Coating: Homogeneous All-Inorganic Perovskite Films via High-Pressure Recrystallization
Authors: Trong Tam Nguyen, José Penuelas, Aziz Benamrouche, Céline Chevalier, Thi Kim Anh Hoang, Gaëlle Trippé-Allard, Elsa Cassette, Brice Devif, Emmanuel Drouard, Emmanuelle Deleporte, Hong Hanh Mai, Abdelaziz Bouazizi, Christian Seassal, Hai Son Nguyen
Abstract: Metal halide perovskites are promising materials for optoelectronic applications owing to their outstanding optical and electronic properties. Among them, all-inorganic perovskites such as CsPbBr$_3$ offer superior thermal and chemical stability. However, obtaining high-quality CsPbBr$_3$ thin films via solution processing remains challenging due to the precursor's low solubility, and current additive or solvent engineering strategies are often complex and poorly reproducible. High-pressure recrystallization has recently emerged as a promising route to improve film quality, yet its impact on film properties remains insufficiently explored. Here, we systematically investigate the morphological, structural, and optical properties of CsPbBr$_3$ thin films prepared by high-pressure recrystallization, in comparison with standard non-recrystallized films. Optimized recrystallization at 300 bar produces smooth, pinhole-free, single-phase 3D perovskite layers with sub-nanometer roughness, while the film thickness is precisely tunable via precursor concentration. The process enhances both grain and crystallite sizes, leading to amplified spontaneous emission with a reduced excitation threshold and improved photostability. Temperature-dependent X-ray diffraction further reveals the orthorhombic--tetragonal--cubic phase transition, consistent with single-crystal behavior. This study provides fundamental insights into pressure-driven recrystallization and establishes a reproducible, scalable approach for fabricating high-quality CsPbBr$_3$ films for optoelectronic devices.

Title: Nanofluidic logic based on chiral skyrmion flows
Authors: Xichao Zhang, Jing Xia, Yan Zhou, Guoping Zhao, Xiaoxi Liu, Yongbing Xu, Masahito Mochizuki
Abstract: Particle-like chiral magnetic skyrmions can flow in nanotracks and behave like chiral fluids. Using interacting flows to perform logical operations is an important topic in microfluidics and nanofluidics. Here, we report a basic nanofluidic logic computing system based on chiral magnetic skyrmions flowing in parallel pipelines connected by an H-shaped junction. The flow behaviors could be manipulated by adjusting the spin polarization angle, which controls the intrinsic skyrmion Hall angle. We demonstrate that within certain range of the spin polarization angle, fully developed skyrmion flows could lead to fluidic logical operations, which significantly reduce the complexity of skyrmion logic as there is no need for deterministic creation, precise control, and detection of a single isolated skyrmion. Our results suggest that the chiral flow behaviors of magnetic quasiparticles may offer possibilities for spintronic and nanofluidic functions.

Title: Quasi-Solid and Supersolid from Quasiperiodic Long-Range Interactions
Authors: Chao Zhang
Abstract: We investigate hard-core bosons in one dimension with quasiperiodic long-range interactions defined by V_ij = V0 cos(pi * alpha * i) cos(pi * alpha * j), where alpha = (sqrt(5) - 1)/2 is the inverse golden ratio. Large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations reveal incompressible density plateaus at incommensurate fillings tied to Fibonacci ratios. These plateaus feature emergent nonuniform density profiles and robust long-range correlations, as captured by the structure factor. Depending on filling and interaction strength, the system realizes either a quasi-solid phase with suppressed superfluidity, a quasi-supersolid phase where density order coexists with finite superfluid density, or a superfluid phase. Our results demonstrate that purely interaction-induced quasiperiodicity, without external potential or disorder, can stabilize novel quantum phases that simultaneously break translational symmetry and sustain quantum coherence.

Title: Origin of sublattice particle-hole asymmetry in monolayer FeSe superconductors
Authors: Mercè Roig, Kazi Ranjibul Islam, Basu Dev Oli, Huimin Zhang, P. M. R. Brydon, Aline Ramires, Yue Yu, Michael Weinert, Lian Li, Daniel F. Agterberg
Abstract: In iron-based superconductors, the two Fe atoms in the unit cell are typically related by crystal symmetries; therefore, we expect no intra-unit cell variations in the superconducting gap. However, recent experiments have challenged this expectation, reporting intra-unit cell variations in the gap with an unusual particle-hole asymmetry. Here, we examine the origin of this asymmetry between the two Fe sublattices in monolayer FeSe grown on SrTiO$_3$. We reveal that, in addition to the substrate-induced broken inversion symmetry, substrate nematic symmetry breaking is key to observing this asymmetry. We further identify two possible mechanisms through which this can occur. The first is through an odd-parity gap function that coexists with an extended $s$-wave function. The second is via a nodeless $d$-wave gap function that develops in the presence of a symmetry-breaking substrate. We argue that the latter mechanism is more physical. To test our theory, we performed scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements across the nematic domain walls, which exhibit a clear enhancement of the asymmetry between the two Fe sublattices. In addition, we reveal that the observed sublattice particle-hole asymmetry is associated with odd-frequency pairing correlations, providing an experimental realization of this unusual pairing correlation.

Title: Embedding independent length scale of flat bands
Authors: Seokju Lee, Seung Hun Lee, Bohm-Jung Yang
Abstract: In flat band systems with quenched kinetic energy, most of the conventional length scales related to the band dispersion become ineffectual. Although a few geometric length scales, such as the quantum-metric length, can still be defined, because of their embedding dependence, i.e., the dependence on the choice of orbital positions used to construct the tight-binding model, they cannot serve as a universal length scale of the flat band systems. Here, we introduce an embedding-independent length scale $\xi_\text{flat}$ of a flat band that is defined as the localization length of an in-gap state proximate to the flat band. Because $\xi_\text{flat}$ is derived from the intrinsic localization of compact localized states, it is solely determined by the Hamiltonian and provides a robust foundation for embedding-independent observables. We show analytically that the superconducting coherence length in a flat-band superconductor is given by $\xi_\text{flat}$ in the weak-coupling limit, thereby identifying $\xi_\text{flat}$ as the relevant length scale for many-body phenomena. Numerical simulations on various lattice models confirm all theoretical predictions, including the correspondence between $\xi_\text{flat}$ and the superconducting coherence length. Our results highlight $\xi_\text{flat}$ as a universal length scale for flat bands and open a pathway to embedding-independent characterization of strongly interacting flat-band materials.

Title: Role of on-site Coulomb energy and negative-charge transfer in a Dirac semi-metal
Authors: A. R. Shelke, C.-W. Chuang, S. Hamamoto, M. Oura, M. Yoshimura, N. Hiraoka, C.-N. Kuo, C.-S. Lue, A. Fujimori, A. Chainani
Abstract: Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy in combination with band structure calculations have shown that the layered transition metal dichalcogenide NiTe$_2$ is a type-II Dirac semimetal. However, there are conflicting conclusions in the literature regarding the role of electron correlations in NiTe$_2$. We study the core-level and valence band electronic structure of single crystal NiTe$_2$ using soft and hard X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (SXPES, HAXPES), X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and Ni $2p-3d$ resonant photoemission spectroscopy(resonant-PES) to quantify electronic parameters in NiTe$_2$. The on-site Coulomb energy ($U_{dd}$) in the Ni $3d$ states is quantified from measurements of the Ni $3d$ single particle density of states and the two-hole correlation satellite. The Ni $2p$ core level and $L$-edge XAS spectra are analyzed by charge transfer cluster model calculations using the experimentally estimated $U_{dd}$ (= 3.7 eV), and the results show that NiTe$_2$ exhibits a negative charge-transfer energy ($\Delta$ = -2.8 eV). The same type of cluster model analysis of NiO $L$-edge XAS confirms its well-known strongly correlated charge-transfer insulator character, with $U_{dd}$ = 7.0 eV and $\Delta$ = 6.0 eV. The $d$-$p$ hybridization strength $T_{eg}$ for NiTe$_2$$<$NiO, and indicates that the reduced $U_{dd}$ in NiTe\textsubscript{2} compared to NiO is not due to an increase in $T_{eg}$. The increase in $d^n$ count on the Ni site in NiTe$_{2}$ by nearly one electron is attributed to negative-$\Delta$ and a reduced $U_{dd}$. However, since $U_{dd}$$>$$|\Delta|$, the results indicate the important role of a finite repulsive $U_{dd}$ in making NiTe$_{2}$ a moderately correlated $p$-type Dirac semi-metal.

Authors: Stoimen Stoimenov, Malte Henkel
Abstract: The generic shape of the single-time and two-time correlators in non-equilibrium phase-ordering kinetics with ${z}=2$ is obtained from the co-variance of the four-point response functions. Their non-equilibrium scaling forms follow from a new non-equilibrium representation of the Schrödinger algebra.

Title: Hybridization Gap and Edge States in Strain-layer InAs/In0.5Ga0.5Sb Quantum Spin Hall Insulator
Authors: Wenfeng Zhang, Peizhe Jia, Wen-kai Lou, Xinghao Wang, Shaokui Su, Kai Chang, Rui-Rui Du
Abstract: The hybridization gap in strained-layer InAs/InxGa1-xSb quantum spin Hall insulators (QSHIs) is significantly enhanced compared to binary InAs/GaSb QSHI structures, where the typical indium composition, x, ranges between 0.2 and 0.4. This enhancement prompts a critical question: to what extent can quantum wells (QWs) be strained while still preserving the fundamental QSHI phase? In this study, we demonstrate the controlled molecular beam epitaxial (MBE) growth of highly strained-layer QWs with an indium composition of x = 0.5. These structures possess a substantial compressive strain within the In0.5Ga0.5Sb QW. Detailed crystal structure analyses confirm the exceptional quality of the resulting epitaxial films, indicating coherent lattice structures and the absence of visible dislocations. Transport measurements further reveal that the QSHI phase in InAs/In0.5Ga0.5Sb QWs is robust and protected by time-reversal symmetry. Notably, the edge states in these systems exhibit giant magnetoresistance when subjected to a modest perpendicular magnetic field. This behavior is in agreement with the Z2 topological property predicted by the Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang (BHZ) model, confirming the preservation of topologically protected edge transport in the presence of enhanced bulk strain.

Title: From data to design: Random forest regression model for predicting mechanical properties of alloy steel
Authors: Samjukta Sinha, Prabhat Das
Abstract: This study investigates the application of Random Forest Regression for predicting mechanical properties of alloy steel-Elongation, Tensile Strength, and Yield Strength-from material composition features including Iron (Fe), Chromium (Cr), Nickel (Ni), Manganese (Mn), Silicon (Si), Copper (Cu), Carbon (C), and deformation percentage during cold rolling. Utilizing a dataset comprising these features, we trained and evaluated the Random Forest model, achieving high predictive performance as evidenced by R2 scores and Mean Squared Errors (MSE). The results demonstrate the model's efficacy in providing accurate predictions, which is validated through various performance metrics including residual plots and learning curves. The findings underscore the potential of ensemble learning techniques in enhancing material property predictions, with implications for industrial applications in material science.

Title: Benchmarking Non-perturbative Many-Body Approaches in the Exactly Solvable Hatsugai-Kohmoto Model
Authors: Hui Li, Ziyu Li, Chen-run Yu
Abstract: The accurate simulation of strongly correlated electron systems remains a central challenge in condensed matter physics, motivating the development of various non-perturbative many-body methods. Such methods are typically benchmarked against the numerical exact determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) in the Hubbard model; however, DQMC is limited by the fermionic sign problem and the uncertainties of numerical analytic continuation. To address these issues, we use the exactly solvable Hatsugai-Kohmoto (HK) model as a benchmarking platform to evaluate three many-body approximations: $GW$, $HGW$, and $SGW$. We compare the Green's functions, spectral functions, and response functions obtained from these approximations with the exact solutions. Our analysis shows that the $GW$ approximation, often considered insufficient for describing strong correlation, exhibits a previously unreported solution branch that accurately reproduces Mott physics in the HK model. In addition, using a covariant formalism, we find that $HGW$ provides an accurate description of charge response, while $SGW$ performs well for spin correlations. Overall, our work demonstrates that the HK model can effectively benchmark many-body approximations and helps refine the understanding of $GW$ methods in strongly correlated regimes.

Title: Electronic state of superconductivity in line nodal material CaSb2 under pressure up to 4.2 GPa
Authors: Shumpei Oguchi, Kenji Ishida, Atsutoshi Ikeda, Yoshiteru Maeno, Shunsaku Kitagawa
Abstract: We report the results of resistance measurements under pressure up to $4.2\,\mathrm{GPa}$ on single-crystalline $\mathrm{CaSb}_2$ , which shows the maximum of superconducting transition temperature $T_\mathrm{c}$ at $3.1\,\mathrm{GPa}$. At room temperature, $R(P)$ shows a subtle anomaly at $3.1\,\mathrm{GPa}$. However, Bloch-Grüneisen analysis of $R(T)$ indicates that the electronic state does not change significantly across $3.1\,\mathrm{GPa}$.

Title: Pressure-Driven Phase Evolution and Optoelectronic Properties of Lead-free Halide Perovskite Rb$_2$TeBr$_6$
Authors: Suvashree Mukherjee, Asish Kumar Mishra, K.A. Irshad, Boby Joseph, Goutam Dev Mukherjee
Abstract: The structural, vibrational, and optical properties of Rb$_2$TeBr$_6$ have been investigated under high pressure using synchrotron X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, photoluminescence (PL), and optical absorption measurements. At ambient conditions, Rb$_2$TeBr$_6$ crystallizes in the cubic Fm-3m structure, which remains stable below 8.0 GPa. Within this pressure range, subtle inter-octahedral rotations develop, producing a gradual localized deviation from the ideal cubic framework. This local reorientation facilitates radiative recombination, leading to a pronounced enhancement of PL intensity with pressure up to 2.4 GPa. Beyond this pressure point, enhancement of nonradiative relaxation channels result in gradual PL quenching. Additionally, the PL intensity increases upon the application of an external weak magnetic field. A structural transition to the orthorhombic Pnnm phase occurs at around 8.0 GPa, followed by a monoclinic P$2_1/m$ phase above 10.7 GPa, and eventual amorphization beyond 25.5 GPa. Optical absorption spectra reveal continuous band-gap narrowing upon compression. These findings demonstrate the strong coupling among lattice dynamics, electronic structure, and optical response in Rb$_2$TeBr$_6$, underscoring its potential as a pressure-tunable optoelectronic material

Title: $C_{3}$-Symmetry-induced Antisymmetric Planar Hall effect and Magnetoresistance in Single-Crystalline Ferromagnets
Authors: W. J. Qin, B. Yang, Y. Z. Tian, B. W. Zheng, K. Y. Wang, B. Y. Huang, Y. B. Yang, W. Q. Zou, D. Wu, P. Wang
Abstract: The planar Hall effect (PHE) is typically symmetric under magnetic field reversal, as required by the Onsager reciprocity relations. Recent advances have identified the antisymmetric PHE (under magnetic field reversal) as an intriguing extension in magnetic systems. While new mechanisms have been proposed, the role of conventional anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) in this phenomenon remains unclear. Here, we report the experimental discovery of an antisymmetric (with respect to both magnetic field and magnetization) PHE and magnetoresistance in single-crystal $Co_{30}Pt_{70}$ (111) thin films with $C_{3}$ rotational symmetry and perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA). We demonstrate that both antisymmetric effects arise naturally from the intrinsic fourth-rank AMR tensor inherent to C3-symmetric planes, assisted by PMA. Our findings link conventional AMR to antisymmetric galvanomagnetic responses, offering new insights into symmetry-governed transport in crystalline ferromagnets.

Title: Multi-Particle Quantum Walks in a Dipole-Conserving Bose-Hubbard Model
Authors: Sooshin Kim, Byungmin Kang, Perrin Segura, Yanfei Li, Ethan Lake, Brice Bakkali-Hassani, Markus Greiner
Abstract: When particles move through a crystal or optical lattice, their motion can sometimes become frozen by strong external forces -- yet collective motion may still emerge through subtle many-body effects. In this work, we explore such constrained dynamics by realizing a dipole-conserving Bose-Hubbard model, where single atoms are immobile but pairs of particles can move cooperatively while preserving the system's center of mass, i.e. the overall dipole moment of the particle distribution. Starting from a one-dimensional chain of ultracold bosonic atoms in an optical lattice, we generate localized dipole excitations consisting of a hole and a doublon using site-resolved optical potentials and characterize their quantum walks and scattering dynamics. Our study provides a bottom-up investigation of a Hamiltonian with kinetic constraints, and paves the way for exploring low-energy phases of fractonic matter in existing experimental platforms.

Title: Charge glass from supercooling topological-ordered liquid
Authors: Kouki Kimata, Harukuni Ikeda, Masafumi Udagawa
Abstract: Topological order characterizes a class of quantum and classical many-body liquid states that escape the conventional classification by spontaneous symmetry breaking. Many properties of the topological-ordered states still await a clear understanding, and nature of phase transition dynamics is one of them. Normally, when a liquid freezes into a solid, crystallization starts with nucleation and a solid domain quickly grows on the surface of the expanding nucleus, and the domains evolve into macroscopic size. In this work, we reveal that the crystallization of the topological-ordered liquid proceeds in a fundamentally different way. The topological-ordered phase is characterized by a global conserved quantity and its conjugate fractional charge, which we call a flux and a triplet in our working system of the charge Ising model on a triangular lattice. In contrast to the normal crystallization process, the phase transition is driven by the diffusive motion of triplets, which is required to change the value of conserved fluxes to exit the topological-ordered phase. In order to complete crystallization, triplets must spend a divergently long time to diffuse over a macroscopic distance across the system, which results in glassy behavior. Reflecting the diffusive motion of triplets, the initial crystallization process shows slowing down with unusually small Avrami exponent $\sim0.5$. These anomalous dynamics are specific to the crystallization from topological-ordered liquid, and well account for the main features of charge glass behavior exhibited by the organic conductors, $\theta$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$X(SCN)$_4$.

Title: Strain-Tunable Opto-electronics in PdS$_2$ Monolayer: the Role of Band Nesting and Carrier-Phonon Scattering
Authors: Hongfa Wang, Yancheng Gong, Subrahmanyam Pattamatta, Junwen Li, Hailong Wang, Zhizi Guan
Abstract: Strain engineering is a powerful strategy for tuning the optoelectronic properties in two-dimensional materials, yet the underlying mechanisms governing their strain response are often not fully elucidated. In this work, our first-principle calculations show that the penta-orthorhombic PdS$_2$ monolayer exhibits two key strain-tunable properties: a continuous redshift of its main optical absorption peak from $\sim$2.0 to $\sim$1.6~eV and enhancement in carrier mobility, with a more than threefold increase for electron under 0--4\% biaxial tensile strain. Subsequent analysis reveals that the tunable optical response originates from a robust band nesting feature between the highest valence and lowest conduction bands, which is preserved across the Brillouin zone under biaxial strain. For the carrier transport, deformation potential theory predicts mobility increasing with strain, strongly correlating with the reduction of carrier effective mass. Our first-principles calculations show a strain-induced monotonic decrease in carrier linewidths near the band edges, indicating suppressed carrier-phonon scattering and longer carrier lifetime as the origin of the mobility enhancement. Our work establishes a pathway for engineering the optoelectronic response in 2D semiconductors where strong band nesting governs the optical properties and paves the way for the rational design of continuously tunable flexible optoelectronic devices.

Title: Acoustic orbital Hall effect and orbital pumping in light-metal-ferromagnet bilayers
Authors: Mingxing Wu, Shilei Ding, Hiroki Matsumoto, Pietro Gambardella
Abstract: Orbital currents provide a new degree of freedom for controlling magnetism, yet their interaction with lattice dynamics remains largely unexplored. Here we report a systematic investigation of the acoustic orbital Hall effect in light metals such as Ti and Cr, where surface acoustic waves generate orbital currents through phonon-orbital coupling. The acoustic orbital current in Ti exhibits higher efficiency and longer diffusion length compared to the acoustic spin current in Pt. The sign and magnitude of the rectified acoustic voltages in nonmagnetic (Ti, Cr)/ferromagnetic (Ni, Co, Fe$_x$Co$_{1-x}$) bilayers are determined by the product of orbital-to-spin conversion and magnetoelastic coupling efficiencies of the ferromagnet. Additionally, we find evidence for acoustic orbital pumping, whereby the excitation of ferromagnetic resonance by surface acoustic waves injects an orbital current from the ferromagnet into the nonmagnet. These results establish lattice dynamics as an efficient driver of orbital transport, opening opportunities for low-dissipation orbitronic devices that harness and sense phonons.

Title: The bulk modulus of three-dimensional quantum droplets
Authors: Zibin Zhao, Guilong Li, Zhaopin Chen, Huan-Bo Luo, Bin Liu, Boris A. Malomed, Yongyao Li
Abstract: Quantum droplets (QDs), formed by ultra-dilute quantum fluids under the action of Lee-Huang-Yang (LHY) effect, provide a unique platform for investigating a wide range of macroscopic quantum effects. Recent studies of QDs' breathing modes and collisional dynamics have revealed their compressibility and extensibility, which suggests that their elasticity parameters can be identified. In this work, we derive the elastic bulk modulus (BM) of QDs by means of the theoretical analysis and numerical simulations, and establish a relation between the BM and the eigenfrequency of QD's intrinsic vibrations. The analysis reveals the dependence of the QD's elasticity on the particle number and the strength of interparticle interactions. We conclude that the BM of QDs can be less than $1~\mathrm{\mu Pa}$, implying that QDs are ultra-soft quantum elastic media. These findings suggest new perspectives for realizing elastic media governed by the LHY effect.

Title: On the supra-linear storage in dense networks of grid and place cells
Authors: Adriano Barra, Martino S. Centonze, Michela Marra Solazzo, Daniele Tantari
Abstract: Place-cell networks, typically forced to pairwise synaptic interactions, are widely studied as models of cognitive maps: such models, however, share a severely limited storage capacity, scaling linearly with network size and with a very small critical storage. This limitation is a challenge for navigation in 3-dimensional space because, oversimplifying, if encoding motion along a one-dimensional trajectory embedded in 2-dimensions requires $O(K)$ patterns (interpreted as bins), extending this to a 2-dimensional manifold embedded in a 3-dimensional space -yet preserving the same resolution- requires roughly $O(K^2)$ patterns, namely a supra-linear amount of patterns. In these regards, dense Hebbian architectures, where higher-order neural assemblies mediate memory retrieval, display much larger capacities and are increasingly recognized as biologically plausible, but have never linked to place cells so far. Here we propose a minimal two-layer model, with place cells building a layer and leaving the other layer populated by neural units that account for the internal representations (so to qualitatively resemble grid cells in the MEC of mammals): crucially, by assuming that each place cell interacts with pairs of grid cells, we show how such a model is formally equivalent to a dense Battaglia-Treves-like Hebbian network of grid cells only endowed with four-body interactions. By studying its emergent computational properties by means of statistical mechanics of disordered systems, we prove -analytically- that such effective higher-order assemblies (constructed under the guise of biological plausibility) can support supra-linear storage of continuous attractors; furthermore, we prove -numerically- that the present neural network is capable of recognition and navigation on general surfaces embedded in a 3-dimensional space.

Title: Parity Anomalous Semimetal with Minimal Conductivity Induced by an In-Plane Magnetic Field
Authors: Binbin Wang, Jiayuan Hu, Bo Fu, Jiaqi Li, Yunchuan Kong, Kai-Zhi Bai, Shun-Qing Shen, Di Xiao
Abstract: The interplay between topological materials and local symmetry breaking gives rise to diverse topological quantum phenomena. A notable example is the parity anomalous semimetal (PAS), which hosts a single unpaired gapless Dirac cone with a half-integer quantized Hall conductivity. Here, we realize this phase in a magnetic topological sandwich structure by applying an in-plane magnetic field. This configuration aligns the magnetization of one surface in-plane while preserving magnetization out-of-plane on the opposite surface, satisfying the condition for a gapless surface state near the Fermi level on only one surface. Our key evidence is a distinctive two-stage evolution of the conductivity tensor ($\sigma_{xy}$, $\sigma_{xx}$). The first stage culminates in the PAS at the fixed point ($\frac{e^2}{2h}$, $m \frac{e^2}{h}$), where $m \approx 0.6$ corresponds to the minimal longitudinal conductivity of a single gapless Dirac cone of fermions on a 2D lattice. This PAS state remains stabilized and is superposed with a gapped band flow in the second stage. This observation demonstrates that this state stabilized by the in-plane field resists localization--contrary to conventional expectations for 2D electron systems with broken time reversal symmetry. The dynamic transition from an integer quantized insulator to a half-integer quantized semimetal establishes this material system as a versatile platform for exploring parity anomaly physics.

Title: Non-altermagnetic spin texture in MnTe

Abstract: Recently, altermagnets have emerged as promising candidates in spintronics, uniquely combining large spin-polarized electronic states with zero net magnetization. A prominent example is $\alpha$-MnTe, whose altermagnetic spin splitting, i.e., the degeneracy lift in momentum space induced by collinear magnetic order, has been experimentally observed. However, the direct evidence of its $g$-wave spin polarization, the key property for altermagnetic spintronics, is thus far lacking. By combining high-resolution spin- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (SARPES) with first-principles calculations, we reveal a $k_z$-independent, Rashba-like spin texture in $\alpha$-MnTe. Our results indicate that the observed spin polarization is primarily governed by spin-orbit coupling, whereas the magnetic order contributes to the splitting of energy bands but plays a much less dominant role in spin polarization due to the multi-domain nature. From this result, we further establish a way to prescreen altermagnet candidates that favor the formation of large antiferromagnetic domains based on symmetry analysis. Our work elucidates the interplay between magnetic order and spin-orbit coupling in governing spin polarization in altermagnet candidates, and thereby advances the materials design paradigm for spin-functional devices.

Title: Spin and orbital excitations in undoped infinite layers: a comparison between superconducting PrNiO2 and insulating CaCuO2
Authors: Francesco Rosa, Hoschang Sahib, Giacomo Merzoni, Leonardo Martinelli, Riccardo Arpaia, Nicholas B. Brookes, Daniele Di Castro, Maryia Zinouyeva, Marco Salluzzo, Daniele Preziosi, Giacomo Ghiringhelli
Abstract: Infinite-layer nickelates are among the most promising cuprate-akin superconductors, although relevant differences from copper oxides have been reported. Here, we present momentum- and polarization-resolved RIXS measurements on chemically undoped, superconducting PrNiO2, and compare its magnetic and orbital excitations with those of the reference infinite layer cuprate CaCuO2. In PrNiO2, the in-plane magnetic exchange integrals are smaller than in CaCuO2, whereas the out-of-plane values are similar, indicating that both materials support a three-dimensional antiferromagnetic order. Orbital excitations, associated to the transitions within 3d states of the metal, are well reproduced within a single-ion model and display similar characteristics, except for the Ni-dxy peak which, besides lying at significantly lower energy, shows an opposite dispersion to that of Cu-dxy. This is interpreted as a consequence of orbital superexchange coupling between nearest neighbor sites, which drives the orbiton propagation. Our observations demonstrate that infinitelayer cuprates and nickelates share most of the spin and orbital properties, despite their markedly different charge-transfer energy Delta.

Title: Ultrafast magnetic moment transfer and bandgap renormalization in monolayer \ce{FeCl2}
Authors: Yu-Hui Song, Huan-Cheng Yang, Kai Liu, Zhong-Yi Lu
Abstract: The microscopic origin of laser-induced ultrafast demagnetization remains an open question, to which the non-thermal electronic distribution plays a vital role at the initial stage. Herein, we investigate the connection between the non-thermal electronic distribution and the ultrafast spin dynamics as well as the electronic structure evolution in ferromagnetic \ce{FeCl2} monolayer using real-time time-dependent density functional theory (rt-TDDFT) with self-consistent Hubbard $U$ correction. Our simulations reveal that femtosecond laser pulses induce ultrafast magnetic moment transfer from Fe to Cl atoms. More importantly, through a comprehensive analysis of orbital-resolved electronic structure, we elucidate the microscopic origin of this transfer, attributing it to specific intra-atomic and inter-atomic charge transfer pathways driven by non-thermal excitations. The extent of demagnetization of Fe atoms exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on the laser photon energy, reaching a maximum at the resonant excitation. In addition, the dynamical evolution of the band structure was studied based on the eigenstates of the instantaneous Hamiltonian. Under resonant excitation, the bandgap reduction reaches up to $41\%$ within tens of fs. These findings provide fundamental insights into ultrafast spin control and suggest a strategy to optically engineer the magnetism in two-dimensional magnetic materials.

Title: Granular drag and lift force on a flexible fiber
Authors: Antonio Pol, Sara Storti, Fabio Gabrieli
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the forces acting on a flexible fiber dragged through a granular bed. Using discrete element simulations, we observe that, after a sufficiently large displacement, the system reaches a steady state in which both the fiber's shape and the forces acting on it become, on average, constant. Under these conditions, we identify two characteristic lengths that describe the fiber's shape and propose unique scaling laws for the drag and lift forces, valid across a wide range of fiber flexibilities, from highly deformable to nearly rigid, based on these lengths. We highlight that the fiber-grains interaction is governed by a single dimensionless elastogranular parameter, defined as the ratio of the fiber's elastic properties to the granular pressure. Finally, we demonstrate that both the forces and the characteristic lengths can be expressed solely as functions of this dimensionless parameter. Our findings offer a fundamental insight into the behavior of a flexible fiber interacting with a granular medium.

Title: Deterministic generation of single B centers in hBN by one-to-one conversion from UV centers
Authors: Andrés Núñez Marcos, Christophe Arnold, Julien Barjon, Stéphanie Buil, Jean-Pierre Hermier, Aymeric Delteil
Abstract: Among the variety of quantum emitters in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), blue-emitting color centers, or B centers, have gathered a particular interest owing to their excellent quantum optical properties. Moreover, the fact that they can be locally activated by an electron beam makes them suitable for top-down integration in photonic devices. However, in the absence of a real-time monitoring technique sensitive to individual emitters, the activation process is stochastic in the number of emitters, and its mechanism is under debate. Here, we implement an in-situ cathodoluminescence monitoring setup capable of detecting individual quantum emitters in the blue and ultraviolet (UV) range. We demonstrate that the activation of individual B centers is spatially and temporally correlated with the deactivation of individual UV centers emitting at 4.1 eV, which are ubiquitous in hBN. We then make use of the ability to detect individual B center activation events to demonstrate the controlled creation of an array with only one emitter per irradiation site. Additionally, we demonstrate a symmetric technique for heralded selective deactivation of individual emitters. Our results provide insights into the microscopic structure and activation mechanism of B centers, as well as versatile techniques for their deterministic integration.

Title: Theoretical analysis of photon detection mechanism in superconducting single-photon detectors
Authors: Yusuke Masaki, Hiroaki Matsueda
Abstract: To elucidate the photon detection mechanism of superconducting single-photon detectors, we theoretically examine the dynamics of type-II superconductors with a bias current using the two-dimensional time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau and the Maxwell equations. The photon injection that weakens the superconducting order parameter is treated phenomenologically as a local temperature increase, and the amount of injection is controlled by the initial hotspot radius. The photon is detected by the voltage change between two electrodes attached to the left and right edges of the superconductor. We find that certain parameter ranges can be explained by the traditionally considered hotspot model, while other parameter ranges are governed by the generation and annihilation of superconducting vortex and antivortex pairs. The photon detection is possible for an initial hotspot radius that exceeds a threshold value. We find that the generation of a vortex--antivortex pair occurs near the threshold. The flow of the pair perpendicular to the current direction finally creates a normal region for the photon detection. The voltage change for the Ginzburg--Landau parameter close to the transition point from type-II to type-I superconductor shows anomalous behavior that is not associated with the dynamics of the vortex--antivortex pair. We also examine the effects of spatially non-uniform current density on the voltage change and the superconducting order parameter to provide a hint to understand the behavior of wide-strip single-photon detectors. The estimated values of incident photon energy and response time for photon detection are reasonable in comparison with experiments. The present comprehensive examination provides useful guidelines for flexible design of device structures.

Title: Vorticity-induced surfing and trapping in porous media
Authors: Pallabi Das, Mirko Residori, Axel Voigt, Suvendu Mandal, Christina Kurzthaler
Abstract: Microorganisms often encounter strong confinement and complex hydrodynamic flows while navigating their habitats. Combining finite-element methods and stochastic simulations, we study the interplay of active transport and heterogeneous flows in dense porous channels. We find that swimming always slows down the traversal of agents across the channel, giving rise to robust power-law tails of their exit-time distributions. These exit-time distributions collapse onto a universal master curve with a scaling exponent of $\approx 3/2$ across a wide range of packing fractions and motility parameters, which can be rationalized by a scaling relation. We further identify a new motility pattern where agents alternate between surfing along fast streams and extended trapping phases, the latter determining the power-law exponent. Unexpectedly, trapping occurs in the flow backbone itself -- not only at obstacle boundaries -- due to vorticity-induced reorientation in the highly-heterogeneous fluid environment. These findings provide a fundamentally new active transport mechanism with direct implications for biofilm clogging and the design of novel microrobots capable of operating in heterogeneous media.

Title: Adhesive strength of bio-inspired fibrillar arrays in the presence of contact defects
Authors: Agostinelli Daniele, Shojaeifard Mohammad, Bacca Mattia
Abstract: The performance of bio-inspired fibrillar adhesives can be compromised by surface roughness, manufacturing imperfections or impurities. Previous studies investigated the cases of distributed defects on the array, and defects at the level of single fibrils. However, the influence of localized, macroscopic defects remains largely unexplored. Using numerical simulations of a discrete mechanical model for a fibrillar adhesive with a thick backing layer, we investigate how the size and location of a single circular defect affect the established scaling law between the adhesion force ($F$) and the effective compliance of the system ($\beta$), \ie, $F \propto \beta^{-1/2}$. We find that edge defects are generally more detrimental than central ones, as they act as pre-cracks that amplify stress concentrations at the adhesive's edge, accelerating a crack-like failure. Consequently, the established adhesion scaling law is preserved, with the defect only reducing the effective contact area. In contrast, a central defect fundamentally alters the mechanics of detachment. By transforming the contact geometry into an annulus, it promotes more uniform load sharing across the remaining fibrils and mitigates the edge-dominated failure mechanism. This change makes the adhesive strength less sensitive to the compliance of the system, as reflected by a less negative scaling exponent. The transition between these two regimes appears to occur for defects whose boundary merges with the one of the adhesive. These results provide practical guidance for the design, engineering and quality control of bio-inspired fibrillar adhesives.

Title: Mean field magnetism and spin frustration in a double perovskite oxide with compositional complexity
Authors: Nandana Bhattacharya, Ravi Kiran Dokala, Sourav Chowdhury, Suresh Chandra Joshi, Subha Dey, Jayjit Kumar Dey, Subhajit Nandy, Daniel Perez Salinas, Manuel Valvidares, Moritz Hoesch, Roland Mathieu, Srimanta Middey
Abstract: The rise of high-entropy oxides as a major functional materials design principle in recent years has prompted us to investigate how compositional disorder affects long-range magnetic ordering in double perovskite oxides. Since ferromagnetic insulators are emerging as an important platform for lossless spintronics, we consider the $RE_2$NiMnO$_6$ ($RE$ : rare-earth) family and investigate single-crystalline films of (La$_{0.4}$Nd$_{0.4}$Sm$_{0.4}$Gd$_{0.4}$Y$_{0.4}$)NiMnO$_{6}$ grown on SrTiO$_3$ (001) substrates in this work. Despite configurational disorder and high cationic size variance at the $RE$ site, the material exhibits robust ferromagnetic ordering with a Curie temperature ($T_\mathrm{c}$) of approximately 150 K. This $T_\mathrm{c}$ is consistent with the expectation based on consideration of the average ionic radii of the rare-earth ($RE$) sites in the bulk $RE_2$NiMnO$_6$. Below $T_\mathrm{c}$, Raman spectroscopy measurement finds a deviation from anharmonic behavior, where the phonon renormalization aligns with a mean-field approximation of spin-spin correlation. At lower temperature, magnetic $RE$ ions also contributed to the magnetic behavior and the system displays a reentrant spin-glass-like behavior. This study demonstrates that while a mean-field approach serves as a viable starting point for predicting the long-range transition temperature, microscopic details of the complex magnetic interactions are essential for understanding the low-temperature phase.

Title: Macroscopic active matter under confinement: dynamical heterogeneity, bursts, and glassy behavior in a few-body system of self-propelling camphor surfers
Authors: Marco Leoni, Matteo Paoluzzi, Christian Alistair Dumaup, Farbod Movagharnemati, Lauren Nguyen-Leon, Tiffany Nguyen, Sarah Eldeen, Wylie W. Ahmed
Abstract: We study a few-body system composed of self-propelling camphor surfers confined within a circular boundary. These millimeter-sized particles move in a regime where inertia and long-ranged interactions play a significant role, leading to surprisingly complex and subtle collective dynamics. These dynamics include self-organized bursts and glassy behavior at intermediate densities--phenomena not apparent from ensemble-averaged steady-state measures. By analyzing quantities like the overlap order parameter, we observe that the system exhibits dynamical slowing down as particle density increases. This slowdown is also reflected in the bursting activity, where both the amplitude and frequency of bursts decrease with increasing particle density. A minimal inertial active-particle model reproduces these dynamical steady states, revealing the importance of a new intermediate length scale--larger than the particle size. This intermediate scale is critical for the formation of structures resembling caging and plays a key role in the glass-like transition. Our results describe a macroscopic analog of an active glass with the additional phenomena of bursting.

Title: Structure-property relation in the cuprates: a possible explanation for the pseudogap
Authors: Sophie Beck, Aline Ramires
Abstract: We propose a structure-property relation that could be key to the pseudogap phenomenology in cuprates. The underlying nonsymmorphic crystal structure in the low-temperature orthogonal phase endows the lattice with a sublattice structure that gives rise to two electronic bands near the Fermi surface. In the presence of spin-orbit coupling, the hybridization of these two bands generates small Fermi pockets and, correspondingly, a change in the number of free carriers. A sublattice structure also leads to angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) matrix-element interference, naturally explaining the emergence of Fermi arcs and their consistency with closed Fermi pockets. We employ a symmetry analysis to highlight the expected Fermi surface properties, and complement it with density functional theory (DFT) for a quantitative discussion and comparison with recent experiments in doped La$_2$CuO$_4$. The proposed mechanism can consistently account for the most salient features of the pseudogap in the cuprates, namely, the Fermi surface reconstruction with the formation of small Fermi pockets and the corresponding change in carrier density, and the observation of Fermi arcs by ARPES.

Title: Polarization-controlled pattern formation in antiparallel dipolar binary condensates
Authors: Zhijun Zhang, Weijing Bao, Changjian Yu, Jinbin Li, Gentaro Watanabe, Kui-Tian Xi
Abstract: We investigate non-equilibrium pattern formation in an antiparallel two-component dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate by varying the polarization angle and the trap aspect ratio. At finite tilt, the condensate supports stripe order. Quenching the angle to zero triggers a roton-assisted, mushroom-like corrugation that destroys translational order and drives the system into labyrinthine textures, whereas a slow linear ramp produces long-lived curved stripes that ultimately converge to labyrinths. Population imbalance strongly biases the evolution: the minority component preferentially fragments into a stable droplet array while the majority remains comparatively diffuse; once formed, the droplet crystal is robust under polarization hysteresis with largely reversible shape changes and unchanged lattice topology. The trap aspect ratio controls both the initial stripe number and the instability timescale, with tighter axial confinement accelerating corrugation and yielding denser labyrinths at late times. All behaviors arise within a quasi-two-dimensional mean-field regime where beyond-mean-field corrections are negligible; accordingly, the droplets reported here are not self-bound in free space. The observed textures (such as stripes, curved stripes, and labyrinths) mirror the taxonomy and instability pathways of nuclear "pasta" morphologies (rods and slabs) known from neutron-star and supernova matter, highlighting polarization angle, trap geometry, and population imbalance as practical, experimentally accessible controls for selecting and steering patterns in dipolar mixtures.

Title: Theory of In-Plane-Magnetic-Field-Dependent Excitonic Spectra in Atomically Thin Semiconductors
Authors: Michiel Snoeken, Paul Steeger, Robert Schmidt, Steffen Michaelis de Vasconcellos, Rudolf Bratschitsch, Andreas Knorr, Henry Mittenzwey
Abstract: The linear absorption spectrum of excitons in TMDC monolayers under the influence of an in-plane magnetic field is theoretically studied. We demonstrate that in-plane magnetic fields induce a hybridization between spin-bright and spin-dark exciton transitions, resulting in a brightening of spin-dark excitons. We analytically investigate spectral features including resonance energy shifts, broadening and amplitudes ratios. In particular, for a MoSe$_2$ monolayer with radiatively-limited linewidth, we find a complex interplay of dark-bright splitting and linewidth difference of both involved spin-bright and spin-dark excitons.

Title: Haldane-Inspired Generalized Statistics
Authors: M. H. Naghizadeh Ardabili, Omid Yahyayi Monem, Morteza Nattagh Najafi, Hosein Mohammadzadeh
Abstract: We propose and study a generalized quantum statistical framework, referred to as \emph{alpha statistics}, that continuously interpolates between Bose--Einstein and Fermi--Dirac statistics and naturally extends into the hyperbosonic regime for $\alpha < 0$. Inspired by Haldane's exclusion statistics, this formulation introduces a modified occupation weight function that encodes effective statistical interactions via the parameter $\alpha$. Using thermodynamic geometry, we analyze the sign and singular behavior of the thermodynamic curvature as a diagnostic of underlying interactions and phase structures. A crossover temperature $T^{*}$, at which the curvature changes sign, marks the transition between effectively attractive (Bose-like) and repulsive (Fermi-like) statistical regimes. When expressed relative to the Bose--Einstein condensation temperature $T_{c}$, the ratio $T^{*}/T_{c}$ depends universally on $\alpha$. For negative $\alpha$, corresponding to hyperbosonic statistics, we find curvature singularities at specific fugacities, indicating modified condensation phenomena distinct from conventional Bose condensation. These results highlight the geometric and thermodynamic consequences of alpha statistics and establish a link between fractional exclusion principles and curvature-induced interaction signatures in statistical thermodynamics.

Title: First-principles Prediction of Carrier Mobility in Semiconductor Nanowires Based on the Spatially Dependent Boltzmann Transport Equation
Authors: Zirui He, Shang-Peng Gao, Meng Chen
Abstract: Carrier mobility in bulk semiconductors is typically governed by electron-phonon (e-ph) scattering. In nanostructures, spatial confinement can lead to significant surface scattering, lowering mobility and breaking the spatial homogeneity assumption of conventional models. In this work, a fully ab initio framework based on the spatially dependent Boltzmann transport equation for one-dimensional nanowires is developed. We apply it to Si and GaN assuming diffusive surface scattering, and reveal the mobility-diameter relation: $\mu_\mathrm{1D} = \mu_\mathrm{bulk} \left[1-\left(d/d_0\right)^{-\beta}\right]$. The parameter $d_0$, comparable to the carrier mean free path, defines a boundary layer exhibiting a considerable mobility gradient, and also quantifies the competition between e-ph and surface scattering together with $\beta$. We further discuss the effects of orientation, cross-sectional shape, and temperature. Moreover, experimental data are generally lower than our predictions, possibly due to structural imperfections, systematic errors from measurements, etc. Therefore, our theoretical method can provide an intrinsic benchmark toward optimized experimental realizations.

Title: Universal behavior at the Lifshitz Points of an active Malthusian Ising model
Authors: Gabriel Legrand, Chiu Fan Lee
Abstract: Lifshitz points (LPs) are multicritical points where ordered, disordered, and patterned phases meet. Originally studied in equilibrium magnetic systems, LPs have since been identified in soft matter and even cosmological settings. Their role in active, living matter, however, remains entirely unexplored. Here we address this gap by introducing and analyzing LPs in the Active Malthusian Ising Model (AMIM) -- a minimal model of living matter that incorporates motility together with birth-death dynamics. Despite its simplicity, the AMIM provides direct experimental relevance. We show that the system generically exhibits two distinct LPs and elucidate their universal behavior using a dynamic renormalization group analysis with the $\epsilon$-expansion method at one loop. Our results yield testable predictions for future simulations and experiments, establishing LPs as a fertile testing ground for novel physics in active matter.

Title: Noises in a two-channel charge Kondo model
Authors: T. K. T. Nguyen, J. Rech, T. Martin, M. N. Kiselev
Abstract: We investigate fluctuations of electric and heat currents, along with their cross-correlations, in a two-channel charge Kondo circuit driven by either a voltage bias or a temperature gradient applied across the weak link. The ratios of voltage-driven electric/heat noise to the applied voltage $V$ exhibit oscillations with the gate voltage $N$, resembling the behavior of the thermoelectric coefficient $G_T$. In contrast, the ratios of temperature-driven electric/heat noise to the temperature difference $\Delta T$ vary with $N$ in a manner analogous to the thermal coefficient $G_H$ or the electric conductance $G$. The mixed noise, which is defined as the correlation function between electric and heat currents, displays behavior opposite to that of the above noises. The logarithmic temperature dependence of these noises signals non-Fermi-liquid behavior, while their oscillations with gate voltage reflect the roles of particle-hole and time-reversal symmetries in thermoelectric transport. Our results demonstrate that the fundamental relations linking voltage- and temperature-induced noises to thermoelectric transport across a tunnel junction persist beyond the Fermi-liquid paradigm.

Title: Suppression of auxetic behavior in black phosphorus with sulfur substitution
Authors: Hayden Groeschel, Arjyama Bordoloi, Sobhit Singh
Abstract: Sulfur-doped black phosphorus (b-P) has recently emerged as a promising candidate for next-generation electronic and optoelectronic technologies owing to its enhanced environmental stability and tunable electronic properties. In this work, we systematically investigate the effects of sulfur substitution on the elastic, mechanical, and electronic properties of b-P, with a particular focus on its auxetic behavior (that is, negative Poisson's ratio), using first-principles density functional theory calculations. Our results unveil the fundamental origin of the intrinsic auxetic response in pristine b-P and elucidate how sulfur incorporation alters this behavior. We find that sulfur atoms distort the characteristic bow-tie structural motif responsible for the negative Poisson's ratio in b-P, thereby suppressing the in-plane auxeticity. Moreover, the resulting charge redistribution also effectively quenches the out-of-plane auxetic response of b-P. With increasing sulfur content, the bulk modulus and Poisson's ratio increase, whereas the Young's modulus, shear modulus, and Debye temperature decrease. Additionally, sulfur substitution suppresses the semiconducting properties of b-P, giving rise to metallicity. These findings highlight that although sulfur substitution enhances the environmental stability of b-P, it also substantially modifies its elastic and mechanical properties, particularly the auxetic behavior, which is an important consideration in the design of nanoscale electronic devices.

Title: Exploring mechanisms leading to composition errors in monazite (CePO4) analysed with atom probe tomography
Authors: Tom Veret, Fabien Delaroche, Ivan Blum, Jonathan Houard, Benjamin Klaes, Isabelle Mouton, Frederic De-Geuser, Anne-Magali Seydoux-Guillaume, François Vurpillot
Abstract: Monazite (CePO4) is widely used in U-Th-Pb geochronology due to its reliable age determinations, although isotopic disturbances often require nanoscale investigation to better understand the mechanisms at play. Atom Probe Tomography (APT) offers unique capabilities for nanoscale chemical analysis and 3D atomic reconstruction but presents challenges for insulating materials such as CePO4, particularly due to oxygen loss during field evaporation. This study investigates the effects of laser wavelength, energy, metallic coatings and detection device on mass spectrum optimization and compositional accuracy in synthetic CePO4 samples. Results show that shorter laser wavelengths (260 nm) enhance peak resolution, particularly when combined with advanced reflectron configurations, as demonstrated with the LEAP 6000 XR. Chromium coatings further improve thermal dissipation and reduce noise levels. However, compositional measurements reveal systematic underestimation of oxygen and overestimation of P and Ce, likely influenced by preferential low-field element evaporation. These findings highlight the need to carefully tune experimental parameters to mitigate quantification biases and enhance the reliability of APT analyses for geological materials.

Title: Post-quench relaxation dynamics of Gross-Neveu lattice fermions
Authors: Domenico Giuliano, Reinhold Egger, Bidyut Dey, Andrea Nava
Abstract: We study the quantum relaxation dynamics for a lattice version of the one-dimensional (1D) $N$-flavor Gross-Neveu (GN) model after a Hamiltonian parameter quench. Allowing for a system-reservoir coupling $\gamma$, we numerically describe the system dynamics through a time-dependent self-consistent Lindblad master equation. For a closed ($\gamma=0$) finite-size system subjected to an interaction parameter quench, the order parameter dynamics exhibits oscillations and revivals. In the thermodynamic limit, our results imply that the order parameter reaches its post-quench stationary value in accordance with the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH). However, time-dependent finite-momentum correlation matrix elements equilibrate only if $\gamma>0$. Our findings highlight subtle yet important aspects of the post-quench relaxation dynamics of quantum many-body systems.

Title: Exciton dynamics, Fano quantum interference and d-d excitation in the single crystal of two-dimensional antiferromagnetic Fe2P2S6
Authors: Nasaru Khan, Yuliia Shemerliuk, Sebastian Selter, Bernd Buchner, Saicharan Aswartham, Pradeep Kumar
Abstract: Excitonic quasiparticle and their interactions with phonons, magnons and charge carriers may play a pivotal role in governing the optical properties and their correlation with magnetic interactions in two-dimensional (2D) magnetic semiconductors. Further, in transition metal compounds, d-d electronic transitions, arising from excitations between crystal-field split d-orbitals, significantly influence the optical and magnetic properties, particularly in strongly correlated and low-dimensional systems. Fe2P2S6, a layered antiferromagnetic semiconductor, offers a rich platform for studying the interplay between spin, charge, and lattice degrees of freedom in these 2D systems. In this work, we investigate the photoluminescence (PL) properties of Fe2P2S6 to probe the exciton dynamics, intra-atomic transitions, and their temperature evolution. Two prominent d-d emission peaks are observed at ~ 1.63 eV (D1) and ~ 1.80 eV (D2), attributed to the crystal field-split Fe2+ states. An excitonic emission near the band edge is also identified, which exhibits a characteristic Fano asymmetric line shape. This asymmetry is attributed to the quantum interference between the discrete excitonic state and the d-d transition induced continuum (D2), revealing a Fano resonance behaviour. This exciton peak disappears well before the Neel temperature, indicating its faster destabilization than magnetic ordering. Temperature-dependent PL measurements show a quenching of the excitonic peak with increasing temperature. Our findings provide detailed insight into the optical excitation pathways in Fe2P2S6.

Title: Angular momentum of rotating fermionic superfluids by Sagnac phonon interferometry
Authors: Marcia Frómeta Fernández, Diego Hernández Rajkov, Giulia Del Pace, Nicola Grani, Massimo Inguscio, Francesco Scazza, Sandro Stringari, Giacomo Roati
Abstract: Fermionic many-body systems provide an unrivaled arena to investigate how interactions drive the emergence of collective quantum behavior, such as macroscopic coherence and superfluidity. Central to these phenomena is the formation of Cooper pairs, correlated states of two fermions that behave as composite bosons and condense below a critical temperature. However, unlike elementary bosons, these pairs retain their internal structure set by underlying fermionic correlations, essential for understanding superfluid properties throughout the so-called Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) to Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) crossover-- a cornerstone of strongly correlated fermionic matter. Here, we harness a sonic analog of the optical Sagnac effect to disclose the composite nature of fermionic condensates across the BEC-BCS crossover. We realize an in-situ loop interferometer by coherently exciting two counter-propagating long-wavelength phonons of an annular fermionic superfluid with tuneable interparticle interactions. The frequency degeneracy between clock- and anticlock-wise sound modes is lifted upon controllably injecting a quantized supercurrent in the superfluid ring, resulting in a measurable Doppler shift that enables us to probe the elementary quantum of circulation and the angular momentum carried by each particle in the fermionic fluid. Our observations directly reveal that the superflow circulation is quantized in terms of $h/2m$, where $m$ is the mass of the constituents, in striking contrast to bosonic condensates where $h/m$ is the relevant circulation quantum. Further, by operating our interferometer at tunable temperature, we measure the thermal depletion of the superfluid in the unitary Fermi gas, demonstrating phonon interferometry as a powerful technique for probing fundamental properties of strongly-correlated quantum systems.

Title: Time-Reversed Superfluorescence in a Polaronic Quantum Material
Authors: Arnab Ghosh, Patrick Brosseau, Dmitry N. Dirin, Maksym V. Kovalenko, Patanjali Kambhampati
Abstract: Superfluorescence, the cooperative burst of spontaneous emission from an ensemble of dipoles, arises when microscopic oscillators spontaneously synchronize their phases. Here we show that this process can be reversed in time within quantum materials. Coherent multidimensional spectroscopy of halide perovskite quantum dots reveals a delayed cooperative absorption burst, the mirror image of superfluorescent emission, driven by transient polaron fields that phase-lock unit-cell dipoles within 100 fs. The effect scales systematically with quantum-dot size and halide composition, reaching near-unity coherence fidelity even at 300 K. A microscopic exciton-polaron model reproduces the buildup and decay of the coherent state, identifying lattice polarons as the mediators of synchronization. These results demonstrate that many-body temporal coherence can self-organize and persist at room temperature, opening routes toward engineered collective optical states and superabsorbing quantum devices.

Title: Self-Consistent Theoretical Framework for Third-Order Nonlinear Susceptibility in CdSe/ZnS--MOF Quantum Dot Composites
Authors: Jingxu Wu, Yifan Yang, Jie Shi, Yuwei Yin, Yifan He, Chenjia Li
Abstract: This work presents a fully theoretical and self consistent framework for calculating the third-order nonlinear susceptibility of CdSe/ZnS--MOF composite quantum dots. The approach unifies finite-potential quantum confinement,the Liouville von Neumann density matrix expansion to third order, and effective-medium electrodynamics (Maxwell--Garnett and Bruggeman) within a single Hamiltonian-based model, requiring no empirical fitting. Electron hole quantized states and dipole matrix elements are obtained under the effective-mass approximation with BenDaniel--Duke boundary conditions; closed analytic forms for(including Lorentzian/Voigt broadening) follow from the response expansion. Homogenization yields macroscopic scaling laws that link microscopic descriptors (core radius, shell thickness, dielectric mismatch) to bulk coefficients and. A Kramers--Kronig consistency check confirms causality and analyticity of the computed spectra with small residuals. The formalism provides a predictive, parameter-transparent route to engineer third-order nonlinearity in hybrid quantum materials,clarifying how size and environment govern the magnitude and dispersion of.

Title: Model for charge-carriers spectra in topological semimetals of TaAs family
Authors: G. P. Mikitik, Yu. V. Sharlai
Abstract: We propose a four-bands model describing the electron energy spectra near the Weyl points in the topological semimetals of the TaAs family (TaAs, TaP, NbAs, NbP). This model takes into account the fact that these Weyl points result from the band-contact lines which would exist in the mirror-reflection planes of these materials if the spin-orbit interaction were absent in them. Within this model, we obtain conditions for the existence of the Weyl points, determine their positions in the Brillouin zone, and derive the explicit formula for dispersion of the bands along the straight line connecting the two close Weyl points with opposite topological charges. Using NbP as an example, the values of the parameters defining the model spectrum are found. The obtained results show that for the semimetals of the TaAs family, the charge-carriers spectrum in the vicinity of the two close Weyl points can be analyzed without complex band-structure calculations.

Title: Bandgap Engineering On Demand in GaAsN Nanowires by Post-Growth HydrogennImplantation
Authors: Nadine Denis, Akant Sharma, Elena Blundo, Francesca Santangeli, Paolo De Vincenzi, Riccardo Pallucchi, Mitsuki Yukimune, Alexander Vogel, Ilaria Zardo, Antonio Polimeni, Fumitaro Ishikawa, Marta DeLuca
Abstract: Bandgap engineering in semiconductors is required for the development of photonic and optoelectronic devices with optimized absorption and emission energies. This is usually achieved by changing the chemical or structural composition during growth or by dynamically applying strain. Here, the bandgap in GaAsN nanowires grown on Si is increased post-growth by up to 460 meV in a reversible, tunable, and non-destructive manner through H implantation. Such a bandgap tunability is unattained in epilayers and enabled by relaxed strain requirements in nanowire heterostructures, which enables N concentrations of up to 4.2% in core-shell GaAs/GaAsN/GaAs nanowires resulting in a GaAsN bandgap as low as 0.97 eV. Using micro-photoluminescence measurements on individual nanowires, it is shown that the high bandgap energy of GaAs at 1.42 eV is restored by hydrogenation through formation of N-H complexes. By carefully optimizing the hydrogenation conditions, the photoluminescence efficiency increases by an order of magnitude. Moreover, by controlled thermal annealing, the large shift of the bandgap is not only made reversible, but also continuously tuned by breaking up N-H complexes in the hydrogenated GaAsN. Finally, local bandgap tuning by laser annealing is demonstrated, opening up new possibilities for developing novel, locally and energy-controlled quantum structures in GaAsN nanowires.

Title: The two-dimensional optical Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model: ground state and thermodynamic properties
Authors: Jadson L. Portela e Silva, Gabriel Rein, Sebastião dos A. Sousa-Júnior, Fakher F. Assaad, Natanael C. Costa
Abstract: We investigate the two-dimensional optical Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, in which the electron hopping amplitude is modulated by the difference between neighboring phonon coordinates. Using sign-problem-free auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo simulations, complemented by mean-field analysis, we determine the long-range ordered phases as a function of the electron-phonon coupling and phonon frequency. By examining both adiabatic and antiadiabatic regimes, we reveal the emergence of staggered and armchair valence bond solid (VBS) phases, as well as the O(4) antiferromagnetic phase. In addition, finite-temperature simulations show that the VBS transition occurs at critical temperatures significantly higher than in models with local electron-phonon coupling, consistent with the presence of lighter polarons in the metallic regime. These findings establish the ground-state and finite-temperature phase diagrams of the optical SSH model, which emphasize its similarities and contrasts with other electron-phonon systems.

Title: Anomalous Hall effect in metallic collinear antiferromagnets
Authors: Vladimir P. Golubinskii, Vladimir A. Zyuzin
Abstract: In this paper we propose and theoretically study minimal models of all Néel ordered collinear antiferromagnets which show the anomalous Hall effect. For simplicity we consider two-dimensional models of antiferromagnets with two magnetic sublattices on a square lattice. Examples of Néel ordered ferrimagnet and of Dzyaloshinskii's weak ferromagnet are given. Turov's invariants of existence of the magnetization in Néel ordered antiferromagnets for proposed systems are analyzed. As a result, we obtain that the anomalous Hall effect is allowed only for certain directions of the Néel order defined by the crystal lattice symmetries. We derive the mechanism of the anomalous Hall effect in antiferromagnets to be the interplay of momentum-dependent exchange interaction of conducting fermions with the Néel order, and the spin-orbit coupling consistent with the broken symmetries that allowed for the Turov's invariant in the system.

Title: Majorana string simulation of nonequilibrium dynamics in two-dimensional lattice fermion systems
Authors: Matteo D'Anna, Jannes Nys, Juan Carrasquilla
Abstract: The study of real-time dynamics of fermions remains one of the last frontiers beyond the reach of classical simulations and is key to our understanding of quantum behavior in chemistry and materials, with implications for quantum technology. Here we introduce a Heisenberg-picture algorithm that propagates observables expressed in a Majorana-string basis using a truncation scheme that preserves Trotter accuracy and aims at maintaining computational efficiency. The framework is exact for quadratic Hamiltonians--remaining restricted to a fixed low-weight sector determined by the physical observable--admits variational initial states, and can be extended to interacting regimes via systematically controlled truncations. We benchmark our approach on one- and two-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard quenches, comparing against tensor network methods (MPS and fPEPS) and recent experimental data. The method achieves high accuracy on timescales comparable to state-of-the-art variational techniques and experiments, demonstrating that controlled Majorana-string truncation is a practical tool for simulating two-dimensional fermionic dynamics.

Title: Forbidden Electron Transfer in the Adiabatic Limit of the Marcus-Inverted Region
Authors: Ethan Abraham
Abstract: Here it is shown that in the adiabatic limit of condensed-phase electron transfer, the onset of barrierless transition occurs at a lower driving force than predicted by the non-adiabatic Marcus formulation. Furthermore, in the adiabatic limit of the Marcus-inverted region, isoenergetic electron transfer is strictly forbidden in the absence of nuclear tunneling. This "forbidden" behavior arises from a topological change in the mapping between the adiabatic and diabatic electronic surfaces, emerging precisely at the onset of the Marcus-inverted region.

Title: Delta-learned force fields for nonbonded interactions: Addressing the strength mismatch between covalent-nonbonded interaction for global models
Authors: Leonardo Cázares-Trejo, Marco Loreto-Silva, Huziel E. Sauceda
Abstract: Noncovalent interactions--vdW dispersion, hydrogen/halogen bonding, ion-$\pi$, and $\pi$-stacking--govern structure, dynamics, and emergent phenomena in materials and molecular systems, yet accurately learning them alongside covalent forces remains a core challenge for machine-learned force fields (MLFFs). This challenge is acute for global models that use Coulomb-matrix (CM) descriptors compared under Euclidean/Frobenius metrics in multifragment settings. We show that the mismatch between predominantly covalent force labels and the CM's overrepresentation of intermolecular features biases single-model training and degrades force-field fidelity. To address this, we introduce \textit{$\Delta$-sGDML}, a scale-aware formulation within the sGDML framework that explicitly decouples intra- and intermolecular physics by training fragment-specific models alongside a dedicated binding model, then composing them at inference. Across benzene dimers, host-guest complexes (C$_{60}$@buckycatcher, NO$_3^-$@i-corona[6]arene), benzene-water, and benzene-Na$^+$, \mbox{$\Delta$-sGDML} delivers consistent gains over a single global model, with fragment-resolved force-error reductions up to \textbf{75\%}, without loss of energy accuracy. Furthermore, molecular-dynamics simulations further confirm that the $\Delta$-model yields a reliable force field for C$_{60}$@buckycatcher, producing stable trajectories across a wide range of temperatures (10-400~K), unlike the single global model, which loses stability above $\sim$200~K. The method offers a practical route to homogenize per-fragment errors and recover reliable noncovalent physics in global MLFFs.

Title: Towards Defect Phase Diagrams: From Research Data Management to Automated Workflows
Authors: Khalil Rejiba, Sang-Hyeok Lee, Christina Gasper, Martina Freund, Sandra Korte-Kerzel, Ulrich Kerzel
Abstract: Defect phase diagrams provide a unified description of crystal defect states for materials design and are central to the scientific objectives of the Collaborative Research Centre (CRC) 1394. Their construction requires the systematic integration of heterogeneous experimental and simulation data across research groups and locations. In this setting, research data management (RDM) is a key enabler of new scientific insight by linking distributed research activities and making complex data reproducible and reusable. To address the challenge of heterogeneous data sources and formats, a comprehensive RDM infrastructure has been established that links experiment, data, and analysis in a seamless workflow. The system combines: (1) a joint electronic laboratory notebook and laboratory information management system, (2) easy-to-use large-object data storage, (3) automatic metadata extraction from heterogeneous and proprietary file formats, (4) interactive provenance graphs for data exploration and reuse, and (5) automated reporting and analysis workflows. The two key technological elements are the openBIS electronic laboratory notebook and laboratory information management system, and a newly developed companion application that extends openBIS with large-scale data handling, automated metadata capture, and federated access to distributed research data. This integrated approach reduces friction in data capture and curation, enabling traceable and reusable datasets that accelerate the construction of defect phase diagrams across institutions.

Title: COFAP: A Universal Framework for COFs Adsorption Prediction through Designed Multi-Modal Extraction and Cross-Modal Synergy
Authors: Zihan Li, Mingyang Wan, Mingyu Gao, Zhongshan Chen, Xiangke Wang, Feifan Zhang
Abstract: Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are promising adsorbents for gas adsorption and separation, while identifying the optimal structures among their vast design space requires efficient high-throughput screening. Conventional machine-learning predictors rely heavily on specific gas-related features. However, these features are time-consuming and limit scalability, leading to inefficiency and labor-intensive processes. Herein, a universal COFs adsorption prediction framework (COFAP) is proposed, which can extract multi-modal structural and chemical features through deep learning, and fuse these complementary features via cross-modal attention mechanism. Without Henry coefficients or adsorption heat, COFAP sets a new SOTA by outperforming previous approaches on hypoCOFs dataset. Based on COFAP, we also found that high-performing COFs for separation concentrate within a narrow range of pore size and surface area. A weight-adjustable prioritization scheme is also developed to enable flexible, application-specific ranking of candidate COFs for researchers. Superior efficiency and accuracy render COFAP directly deployable in crystalline porous materials.

Title: Edge Irregularity Strength: A Complementary Descriptor to Topological Indices in QSPR and QSAR Studies
Authors: U. Vijaya Chandra Kumar, H.M. Nagesh, Narahari N
Abstract: In chemical graph theory, topological indices are widely used as numerical descriptors for establishing quantitative structure-property relationships (QSPR) and quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR). These indices successfully correlate molecular structure with various physicochemical and biological properties. In addition to these methods, the concept of edge irregularity strength, a graph labeling measure, offers another perspective for representing structural characteristics. In this context, the edge irregularity strength concept provides a systematic way of assigning numerical labels to atoms based on specific rules. In this work, we explore the chemical applicability of the edge irregularity strength and demonstrate that it can also serve as a predictive tool for physicochemical properties, similar to topological indices. The findings show that the edge irregularity strength captures molecular features and complements existing approaches to structure-property analysis in chemical graph theory.

Title: Intrinsic NISPT Phases, igNISPT Phases, and Mixed Anomalies of Non-Invertible Symmetries
Authors: Da-Chuan Lu, Zhengdi Sun
Abstract: A bosonic non-invertible Symmetry Protected Topological (NISPT) phase in (1+1)-dim is referred to as $\textit{intrinsic}$ if it cannot be mapped, under discrete gauging, to a gapped phase with any invertible symmetry, that is, if it is protected by a non-group-theoretical fusion category symmetry. We construct the intrinsic NISPT phases by performing discrete gauging in a partial SSB phase with a fusion category symmetry that has a certain mixed anomaly. Sometimes, the anomaly of that symmetry category can be alternatively understood as a self-anomaly of a proper categorical sub-symmetry; when this is the case, the same gauging provides an anomaly resolution of this anomalous categorical sub-symmetry. This allows us to construct intrinsic gapless SPT (igSPT) phases, where the anomalous faithfully acting symmetry is non-invertible; and we refer to such igSPT phases as igNISPT phases. We provide two concrete lattice models realizing an intrinsic NISPT phase and an igNISPT phase, respectively. We also generalize the construction of intrinsic NISPT phases to (3+1)-dim.

Title: Entanglement asymmetry in gauge theories: chiral anomaly in the finite temperature massless Schwinger model
Authors: Adrien Florio, Sara Murciano
Abstract: The entanglement asymmetry has emerged in recent years as a practical quantity to study phases of matter. We present the first study of entanglement asymmetry in gauge theories by considering the chiral anomaly of the analytically solvable massless Schwinger model at both zero and finite temperatures. At zero temperature, we find the asymmetry exhibits logarithmic growth with system size. At finite temperature, we show that it is parametrically more sensitive to chiral symmetry-breaking than the corresponding local order parameter: while the chiral condensate decays exponentially, the asymmetry decreases only logarithmically. This establishes the entanglement asymmetry as a promising tool to probe (finite-temperature) phase transitions in gauge theories.

Title: Gradient RG Flow in Scalar-Fermion QFTs
Authors: William H. Pannell, William Patrick Ronayne, Andreas Stergiou
Abstract: The gradient property of the renormalisation group (RG) is examined to four-loop order in scalar-fermion systems in $d=4$ and $d=4-\varepsilon$ dimensions. The crucial role played by the beta shift, which is a modification of the standard dim-reg beta function, is elucidated, and specific conditions that it needs to satisfy for the RG flow to be gradient are derived. Over a thousand gradient-flow conditions are found, all of which are scheme-independent and satisfied whenever the full set of results needed to check them is available. It is shown, in the framework of the $\varepsilon=4-d$ expansion, that the space of conformal field theories (CFTs) is dominated by those with non-zero beta shift as the number of fields grows. Physical properties of CFTs obtained as solutions where the beta functions are not zero in the $\varepsilon$ expansion are discussed.

Title: Stability of mixed-state phases under weak decoherence
Authors: Yifan F. Zhang, Sarang Gopalakrishnan
Abstract: We prove that the Gibbs states of classical, and commuting-Pauli, Hamiltonians are stable under weak local decoherence: i.e., we show that the effect of the decoherence can be locally reversed. In particular, our conclusions apply to finite-temperature equilibrium critical points and ordered low-temperature phases. In these systems the unconditional spatio-temporal correlations are long-range, and local (e.g., Metropolis) dynamics exhibits critical slowing down. Nevertheless, our results imply the existence of local "decoders" that undo the decoherence, when the decoherence strength is below a critical value. An implication of these results is that thermally stable quantum memories have a threshold against decoherence that remains nonzero as one approaches the critical temperature. Analogously, in diffusion models, stability of data distributions implies the existence of computationally-efficent local denoisers in the late-time generation dynamics.

Title: Bulk-boundary decomposition of neural networks
Authors: Donghee Lee, Hye-Sung Lee, Jaeok Yi
Abstract: We present the bulk-boundary decomposition as a new framework for understanding the training dynamics of deep neural networks. Starting from the stochastic gradient descent formulation, we show that the Lagrangian can be reorganized into a data-independent bulk term and a data-dependent boundary term. The bulk captures the intrinsic dynamics set by network architecture and activation functions, while the boundary reflects stochastic interactions from training samples at the input and output layers. This decomposition exposes the local and homogeneous structure underlying deep networks. As a natural extension, we develop a field-theoretic formulation of neural dynamics based on this decomposition.

Title: Non-adiabatic perturbation theory of the exact factorisation
Authors: Matisse Wei-Yuan Tu, E.K.U. Gross
Abstract: We present a novel nonadiabatic perturbation theory (NAPT) for correlated systems of electrons and nuclei beyond the Born-Oppenheimer (BO) approximation. The essence of the method is to exploit the smallness of the electronic-to-nuclear mass ratio by treating the electron-nuclear correlation terms in the electronic equation of motion of the exact factorisation (EF) framework as perturbation. We prove that any finite-order truncation of the NAPT preserves the normalisation of the conditional electronic factor as well as the gauge covariance of the resulting perturbative equations of motion. We illustrate the usefulness of NAPT by obtaining nonadiabatic corrections to the BO Berry phase in Jahn--Teller systems with a conical intersection. It well captures the departure of the exact Berry phase from being topological via the lowest-order NAPT. By removing the conical intersection with a constant gap, it further yields the correct scaling of the Berry phase toward zero.

Title: Euler-Heisenberg action for fermions coupled to gauge and axial vectors: Hessian diagonalization, sector classification, and applications
Authors: Lucas Pereira de Souza
Abstract: We derive the closed-form one-loop Euler--Heisenberg effective actions for Dirac fermions coupled simultaneously to classical electromagnetic vector and massive pseudo-vector backgrounds within a controlled quasi-static approximation. Through complete diagonalization of the functional Hessian, we systematically delineate the parameter space into distinct sectors characterized by stability properties and spectral structure. We identify subspaces that encompass and extend results from previous studies into a broader class, admitting propagating axial fields as physically viable regimes; strikingly, we note a sector presenting chirality-asymmetric instability. This addresses long-standing questions regarding the well-defined nature, diagonalizability, and stability of the model. From the effective action, we derive novel nonperturbative pair-production rates for simultaneously propagating electromagnetic and axial vector backgrounds; remarkably, we find pronounced vacuum stabilization compared to previous results. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this framework allows for a unified derivation of the chiral anomaly structures in the general case and show that the electromagnetic coupling induces instanton-like configurations for the axial field, even when it is not a fundamental gauge field. As a proof-of-concept, we analyze a cosmological toy model of baryogenesis driven by an axial vector, providing numerical estimates that support the viability of this hypothesis. Additionally, we outline qualitative predictions for Weyl/Dirac semi-metals and briefly discuss potential applications in related phenomena, such as the Strong-CP problem.

Potter, Ramil Nigmatullin, Mohsin Iqbal, Henrik Dreyer
Abstract: The Fermi-Hubbard model is the starting point for the simulation of many strongly correlated materials, including high-temperature superconductors, whose modelling is a key motivation for the construction of quantum simulation and computing devices. However, the detection of superconducting pairing correlations has so far remained out of reach, both because of their off-diagonal character-which makes them inaccessible to local density measurements-and because of the difficulty of preparing superconducting states. Here, we report measurement of significant pairing correlations in three different regimes of Fermi-Hubbard models simulated on Quantinuumś Helios trapped-ion quantum computer. Specifically, we measure non-equilibrium pairing induced by an electromagnetic field in the half-filled square lattice model, d-wave pairing in an approximate ground state of the checkerboard Hubbard model at $1/6$-doping, and s-wave pairing in a bilayer model relevant to nickelate superconductors. These results show that a quantum computer can reliably create and probe physically relevant states with superconducting pairing correlations, opening a path to the exploration of superconductivity with quantum computers.

Title: Extending Reflectometry Range, A Zero-Crossing Algorithm for Thick Film Metrology
Authors: Zimu Zhou, Enrique Lopez-Guerra, Iulica Zana, Vu Nguyen, Nguyen Quoc Huy Tran, Bojun Zhou, Gary Qian, Michael Kwan, Peter Wilkens, Chester Chien
Abstract: Accurate and high-efficiency film metrology remains a key challenge in High-Volume Manufacturing (HVM), where conventional spectroscopic reflectometry and white light interferometry (WLI) are either limited by model dependence or throughput. In this work, we extend the measurable film-thickness range of reflectometry to at least 50 um through a new model-free algorithm, the Linearized Reflectance Zero-Crossing (LRZ) method. The approach builds upon the previously reported Linearized Reflectance Extrema (LRE) technique but eliminates the sensitivity to spectral sampling and fringe attenuation that degrade performance in the thick-film regime. By linearizing phase response and extracting zero-crossing positions in wavenumber space, LRZ provides robust and repeatable thickness estimation without iterative fitting, achieving comparable accuracy with much higher computational efficiency than conventional model-based methods. Validation using more than 80 measurements on alumina films over NiFe substrates shows excellent correlation with WLI (r = 0.97) and low gauge repeatability and reproducibility (GR&R < 3%). Moreover, LRZ achieves an average Move-Acquire-Measure (MAM) time of approximately 2 s, which is about 7 times faster than WLI. The proposed method enables fast, accurate, and model-independent optical metrology for thick films, offering a practical solution for advanced HVM process control.

Title: Monochromatic Electron Emission from Graphene-Insulator-Semiconductor-Structured Electron Source Utilizing Interference Efficets
Authors: Takao Koichi, Shogo Kawashima, Hiroshi Miyake, Satoshi Abo, Fujio Wakaya, Masayoshi Nagao, Katsuhisa Murakami
Abstract: The graphene-insulator-semiconductor-structured electron source has garnered significant attention due to its high electron emission efficiency and highly monochromatic electron emission. Graphene, with its c-axis orientation and well-defined interlayer spacing, exhibits electron interference effects that can influence the properties of emitted electrons. In this work, motion of an electron wave packet is numerically calculated to discuss the energy spread of the zero-order and first-order diffracted electron waves by mono- and multilayer graphene. It is found that the effects of multiple reflections of electron between the layers broaden the energy spread especially for the incident energy of 13.4 eV, and that highly monochromatic electron emission can be achieved by using diffracted electron wave with a small aperture.

Authors: Ya. S. Greenberg, A. A. Shtygashev, O. V. Kibis
Abstract: We investigate the decay of three-level artificial atom, a superconducting transmon qubit which interacts with a continuum of modes in an open one-dimensional waveguide. For strong interaction of transmon with a continuum we obtain analytical expressions for the frequency shifts and widths of the resonances the values of which are calculated numerically for the Gaussian density of states. We show that the coupling between the second level and ground state of a transmon significantly influences the decay of the third transmon level.

Title: Demonstration of on-chip all-optical switching of magnetization in integrated photonics
Authors: Pingzhi Li, Gijs W.A. Simons, Tianyu Zhang, Philip P.J. Schrinner, Sohrab Kamyar, Ronald Dekker, Diana C. Leitao, Reinoud Lavrijsen, Yuqing Jiao, Bert Koopmans
Abstract: Ultrafast all-optical magnetization switching (AOS) holds great promise for nextgeneration spintronic memory and hybrid spintronic-photonic systems. However, most implementations to date rely on bulky free-space optical setups, limiting scalability and practical integration. As a critical step toward integrated applications, we demonstrate single-pulse AOS within a silicon nitride (Si3N4) photonic integrated circuit. Using trains of femtosecond laser pulses guided through on-chip waveguides, we achieve deterministic toggle switching in a sub-micron out-of-plane Co/Gd Hall cross patterned directly atop the photonic waveguide. Electrical readout via the anomalous Hall effect reveals a switching contrast of up to 90% for 500 nm-wide devices. In larger Hall crosses, the contrast decreases and switching becomes stochastic, consistent with spatially non-uniform optical absorption as confirmed by finite-element simulations. This behavior is hypothetically attributed to domain wall relaxation and thermally assisted (de)pinning processes within partially switched regions. Our results highlight the critical role of device scaling in achieving robust on-chip AOS and establish a foundation for ultrafast, energy-efficient, and fully integrated spintronic-photonic platforms.

Title: Unlocking n-alk-1-ynes Conformers: Quantum "Trigger Finger" versus "Stiff Joint" Conformations
Authors: Ioan Bâldea
Abstract: Molecular conformation in n-alk-1-ynes (CnA) is conventionally simplified to an all-planar structure. We report a comprehensive quantum chemical analysis revealing two near-isoenergetic rotamers at the acetylenic terminus: planar (C$_s$) and skewed (C$_1$). The high, symmetric rotational energy barrier ($\approx 150$\,meV) arises from unique steric relief near the $\mathrm{sp}$ center coupled with electronic stabilization of C$_1$. This creates a unique kinetic profile: a Quantum ``Trigger Finger'' ($\alpha$ rotation) that enforces an $\approx 50\%:\,50\%$ $\mathrm{C}_s/\mathrm{C}_1$ ensemble, sharply contrasting with the thermodynamically biased ``Stiff Joint'' ($\delta$ rotation) of the alkyl chain. This structural degeneracy necessitates ensemble averaging for spectroscopic data interpretation, while the slow interconversion permits kinetic trapping and intentional conformer enrichment during synthesis and molecular junction fabrication. Our work redefines the alkyne anchor, providing a blueprint for accurate interpretation of spectroscopic data and achieving conformational control in molecular electronics.

Title: A JT/KPZ correspondence
Authors: Masataka Watanabe
Abstract: We point out a correspondence between the Jackiw--Teitelboim (JT) gravity and the stationary measure of the Kardar--Parisi--Zhang (KPZ) equation on an interval. By relating the Schwarzian limit of the double-scaled SYK to the weakly asymmetric limit of the open ASEP, we establish that the path-integral measure defining the Euclidean evolution between two end-of-the-world branes in JT gravity can be interpreted as the stationary measure of the KPZ equation on an interval with Neumann boundary conditions. We also establish the match between correlation functions.

Title: Non-Locally Controllable but Trackable Magnetic Head Flagellated Swimmer
Authors: Lucas Palazzolo, Mickaël Binois, Laëtitia Giraldi
Abstract: Unlike macroscopic swimmers, microswimmers operate in a low-Reynolds-number regime dominated by viscous forces. This paper investigates the controllability of a magnetic microswimmer composed of a spherical magnetic head and an elastic, non-magnetic flagellum. The swimmer evolves in a Stokes flow and is modeled using the resistive force theory. We prove that, under planar motion, the system is not small-time locally controllable and numerically identify regions that remain inaccessible. Nevertheless, simulations show that trajectory tracking can still be achieved via Bayesian optimization, though it requires large-amplitude transverse deformations.

Title: Collective Quantum Batteries and Charger-Battery Setup in Open Quantum Systems: Impact of Inter-Qubit Interactions, Dissipation, and Quantum Criticality
Authors: Mahima Yadav, Devvrat Tiwari, Subhashish Banerjee
Abstract: Quantum batteries have emerged as promising platforms for exploring energy storage and transfer processes governed by quantum mechanical laws. In this work, we study three models of two-qubit open quantum systems. The first model comprises two central spins immersed in spin baths, and both central spins are collectively considered as quantum batteries. The impact of inter-qubit interactions on the performance of the quantum battery is investigated. In the second model, a two-qubit model interacting with a squeezed thermal bath serves as a collective quantum battery, where the impact of inter-atomic distance and the bath temperature on the battery's performance is explored. Furthermore, a two-qubit model is used, where one qubit is modeled as a battery and the other as a charger. The charger in this model interacts with an anisotropic spin-chain bath, which is conducive to quantum criticality. It is demonstrated that this criticality has a substantial impact on the quantum battery's storage capacity.

Title: Emergent Bell Phase in an Electro-Nanomechanical Quantum Simulator
Authors: David Ullrich, Marta Cagetti, Stefan Forstner, Adrian Bachtold, Anna Sanpera
Abstract: Suspended carbon nanotubes hosting electrostatically defined quantum dots allow for exceptionally strong and tunable electromechanical coupling as well as mechanical modes that can reach the quantum ground state of motion simply by cryogenic cooling. This makes them a unique platform for quantum simulation of electron-phonon coupling. Here, we propose an experimentally realisable setup with two such carbon nanotubes in parallel, each hosting four quantum dots. Our system not only exhibits phonon-mediated electron-electron attraction, but also supports a robust, maximally entangled Bell phase at mesoscopic scales shared across the subsystems. These features highlight its potential as a simulator of strongly correlated quantum systems.

Title: Generalized Witt and Morita equivalences
Authors: Liang Kong, Yilong Wang, Hao Zheng
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a family of new equivalence relations among fusion categories that are less refined than the usual Morita equivalence. We obtain abelian groups by quotienting these new equivalence relations from the commutative monoids of the equivalence classes of all fusion categories. Moreover, we upgrade them to equivalence relations among nondegenerate braided fusion categories that are more refined than the usual Witt equivalence. As a consequence, we obtain new abelian groups that are more refined than the usual Witt group. These new groups allow us to access the internal structures within Witt classes. We expect that they are useful in the classification program of (braided) fusion (higher) categories and in the study of gapless edges of 2+1D topological orders.

Title: From Densities to Potentials: Benchmarking Local Exchange-Correlation Approximations
Authors: Visagan Ravindran, Clio Johnson, Neil D. Drummond, Stewart J. Clark, Nikitas. I. Gidopoulos
Abstract: Using the Kohn-Sham (KS) inversion method of Hollins et al. [J. Phys.: Condens. Matter 29, 04LT01 (2017)], we invert densities from variational and diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) calculations to obtain benchmark QMC-KS potentials for a range of insulators and semiconductors, which we then compare to the KS potentials of popular density functional approximations (DFAs). Our results show that different DFAs yield similar electron densities, despite differences in their KS potentials, which originate primarily from the exchange and correlation contribution. We also find that the KS gap from the QMC density is typically larger than the KS gaps of most DFAs, with the exception of Hartree-Fock. Finally, the KS gap is sensitive to the inclusion of semicore states in the pseudopotentials, such that comparison with experiment should be done with caution.

Title: Fabry-Perot interferometer with quantum well mirror for controllable dispersion compensation
Authors: Victor N. Mitryakhin, Pavel Yu. Shapochkin, Roman S. Nazarov, Yury P. Efimov, Sergey A. Eliseev, Vyacheslav A. Lovcjus, Yury V. Kapitonov
Abstract: In this work, we investigate a possibility of controlling second-order dispersion in a monolithic Fabry-Perot interferometer based on epitaxial heterostructure with quantum well (QW) serving as a bottom mirror. Careful choice of heterostructure parameters and experimental conditions makes it possible to introduce negative dispersion in a very narrow spectral region of QW excitonic resonance while maintaining a constant reflection coefficient across this region. The feasibility of the concept is demonstrated for heterostructures with InGaAs/GaAs QWs at cryogenic temperatures. We also propose an active device design that can switch the dispersion compensation on and off by controlling the exciton ensemble's environment.

Title: Statistical properties of the gravitational force through ordering statistics
Authors: Constantin Payerne, Vincent Rossetto
Abstract: We study the statistical distribution of Newtonian gravitational forces acting on a test particle embedded in an infinite, homogeneous, and uncorrelated random gas of particles. In the limit where both the number of neighboring particles and the confining volume tend to infinity with constant density, this distribution converges to the classic Holtsmark distribution. Our focus here is on the contribution of the nearest particle neighbors to the total Newtonian force. To this end, we derive the joint spatial distribution of the nearest neighbors in arbitrary spatial dimensions, and show that, in three dimensions, the divergence of the variance of the Holtsmark distribution originates entirely from the dominant influence of the nearest neighbor.

Title: The elusive fluid-and-crystal coexistence state in simulations of monodisperse, hard-sphere colloids
Authors: J. Galen Wang, Umesh Dhumal, Monica E. A. Zakhari, Roseanna N. Zia
Abstract: Monodisperse, purely repulsive, hard spheres (MPRHS) are an important model system for mechanistically exploring phase behavior in atomic systems and colloids. Since the 1940s, phase transitions in these systems have been obtained via simulation, theory, and experiments. But there is a gap in this literature: despite decades of reports of phase transition from one pure state to another, no computational studies report spontaneous phase separation into coexisting domains of liquid and crystal regions. This gap owes its origin to the underlying mechanism of entropically-driven phase separation in MPRHS - the competition between short-range entropy and long-range entropy. Frenkel proposed that spontaneous phase separation in simulations of up to 1,000,000 particles would require more than 317,000,000 years to sample enough microstates to converge to phase separated macrostate. Some brute-force simulations do show brief spontaneous coexistence but a metastable crystal or fluid subsequently overtakes the system. To bypass these difficulties, many studies use seeding, gravity, or direct construction of liquid and solid phases to study interfacial energy and nucleation rates of MPRHS systems. WCA potentials have also been used to bypass metastability, where softness provides free volume, lowers osmotic pressure and the energy barrier. It is argued that the transition path taken in bypassing metastability is mechanistically the same as without triggers. But as acknowledged by Alder & Wainwright, explicit observation of spontaneous coexistence is central to computational prediction of first-order transition. Such observation would provide satisfying demonstration of Frenkel's entropy exchange mechanism. We explore literature revealing these interesting behaviors and conclude that computational demonstration of Frenkel's mechanism for MPRHS awaits large systems with careful hardness perturbations.

Title: Tunable Josephson voltage source for quantum circuits
Authors: J.-L. Smirr (1), P. Manset (2), Ç. Ö. Girit (1 and 2) ((1) JEIP, PSL University, CNRS, Collège de France, (2) Quantronics Group, SPEC, Université Paris Saclay, CEA, CNRS)
Abstract: Noisy voltage sources can be a limiting factor for fundamental physics experiments as well as for device applications in quantum information, mesoscopic circuits, magnetometry, and other fields. The best commercial DC voltage sources can be programmed to approximately six digits and have intrinsic noise in the microvolt range. On the other hand the noise level in metrological Josephson-junction based voltage standards is sub-femtovolt. Although such voltage standards can be considered "noiseless," they are generally not designed for continuous tuning of the output voltage nor for supplying current to a load at cryogenic temperatures. We propose a Josephson effect based voltage source, as opposed to a voltage standard, operating in the 30-160 uV range which can supply over 100 nA of current to loads at milli-Kelvin temperatures. We describe the operating principle, the sample design, and the calibration procedure to obtain continuous tunability. We show current-voltage characteristics of the device, demonstrate how the voltage can be adjusted without DC control connections to room-temperature electronics, and showcase an experiment coupling the source to a mesoscopic load, a small Josephson junction. Finally we characterize the performance of our source by measuring the voltage noise at the load, 50 pV RMS, which is attributed to parasitic resistances in the cabling. This work establishes the use of the Josephson effect for voltage biasing extremely sensitive quantum devices.

Title: Anomalous Diffusion of Superparamagnetic Walkers with Tailored Statistics
Authors: Alessia Gentili, Rainer Klages, Giorgio Volpe
Abstract: From life sciences and ecology to quantum physics and finance, anomalous diffusion appears in countless complex systems as a signature of emergent transport properties beyond Brownian motion. Despite substantial theoretical progress, the experimental study of real-world systems exhibiting anomalous diffusion remains challenging due to an intrinsically elusive ground truth and the limited information contained in typical single trajectories. Here, unlike previous experimental systems, we demonstrate the controlled generation of two-dimensional trajectories with fully tailored statistics spanning the entire spectrum of anomalous diffusion, from subdiffusion to superdiffusion, and over statistically significant temporal and spatial scales (covering at least two decades). We achieve this feat by simultaneously tuning the step-length distribution and, critically, the velocity autocorrelation function of microscopic superparamagnetic colloidal walkers with magnetic fields during extended acquisitions. Supported by theoretical reasoning, fine control of these two quantities combined allows us to generate trajectories compatible with Lévy walks and fractional Brownian motion with tailored anomalous diffusion exponents. We envisage our approach will offer a robust, controllable experimental framework for validating and advancing theoretical models, analysis techniques, and predictive tools to study anomalous diffusion in real-life phenomena. These include transport in physical and biological systems, animal movement, human ecology, and financial markets.

Title: Transfer entropy and flow of information in two-skyrmion system
Authors: Tenta Tani, Soma Miki, Hiroki Mori, Minori Goto, Yoshishige Suzuki, Eiiti Tamura
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the flow of information in an interacting two-skyrmion system confined in a box at finite temperature. Using numerical simulations based on the Thiele-Langevin equation, we demonstrate that the skyrmion motion cannot be fully described by the master equation, highlighting the system's simplicity with its nontrivial dynamics. Particularly, due to the chiral motion of skyrmion, we find asymmetric flow of information even in equilibrium, which is demonstrated by the violation of the detailed balance condition. We analyze this novel system using information-theoretical quantities including Shannon entropy, mutual information, and transfer entropy. By the analyses, the physical significance of transfer entropy as a measure of flow of information, which has been overlooked in previous studies, is elucidated. Notably, the peak position of the transfer entropy, as a function of time delay, is found to be independent of the interaction range between the two skyrmions yet dependent on the box size. This peak corresponds to the characteristic time required for changing the skyrmion state: the box size divided by the average velocity of skyrmions. We can understand that the information transmission time consists of the time to obtain mutual information and the time to write the information. Since the unusual asymmetric circulation of information is revealed in this two-skyrmion system, it can be a unique platform for future applications to natural computing using flow of information, including more efficient machine learning algorithm.

Title: Interaction-induced reentrance of Bose glass and quench dynamics of Bose gases in twisted bilayer and quasicrystal optical lattices
Authors: Shi-Hao Ding, Li-Jun Lang, Qizhong Zhu, Liang He
Abstract: We investigate the ground-state and dynamical properties of ultracold Bose gases in optical lattices with a quasicrystal structure, inspired by recent experiments on twisted bilayer and quasicrystalline optical lattices. The interplay between on-site repulsive interactions and the quasiperiodic potential leads to rich physics. At low filling factors, increasing the interaction strength induces a delocalization effect that transforms a Bose-glass (BG) phase-characterized by disconnected superfluid (SF) regions-into a robust SF phase with a percolated network of SF clusters. This transition is quantitatively identified via the percolation probability. At higher filling factors, we uncover a reentrant behavior: with increasing interaction, the system first changes from BG to SF, but further strengthening reverses the trend, restoring the BG phase. This reentrance originates from an interaction-driven rearrangement of particles, where a percolated SF network fragments into isolated SF islands as repulsion dominates. The quench dynamics show distinct transient features: intraphase quenches cause minor variations in the percolation probability and the inverse participation ratio (IPR), while interphase quenches produce strong responses. In particular, an SF-to-BG quench exhibits an abrupt loss of global SF connectivity, whereas a BG-to-SF quench shows oscillatory percolation and a gradual IPR decrease, stabilizing the SF phase. These results elucidate the competition between quasiperiodicity and interactions in ultracold Bose gases and offer insights relevant to current experiments with twisted bilayer and quasicrystal optical lattices.

Title: Computation Kernel for Feynman Diagrams
Authors: Daria Gazizova, Rayan Farid, B. D. E. McNiven, I. Assi, Ethan G. Armstrong, J. P. F. LeBlanc
Abstract: We present a general representation for solving problems in many-body perturbation theory. By projecting the single-particle Green's function to an auxiliary space we show how one can convert an arbitrary Feynman graph to a universal kernel representation. Once constructed, the computation kernel contains no problem specific information yet contains all explicit temperature and frequency dependence of the diagram. This computation kernel is problem agnostic, and valid for any physical problem that would normally leverage the Matsubara formalism of many-body perturbation theory. The result of any diagram can be written as a linear combination of these computation kernel elements with coefficients given by a sum over products of known tensor elements that are themselves problem specific and represent spatial degrees of freedom. We probe the efficacy of this approach by generating the computation kernel for a low order self-energy diagram which we then use to construct solutions to distinct problems.

Title: Relevance of the Computational Models of Bacterial Interactions in the simulation of Biofilm Growth
Authors: Gabriel Santos-Díaz, Álvaro Rodríguez-Rivas, Alejandro Cuetos
Abstract: This study explores the application of elongated particle interaction models, traditionally used in liquid crystal phase research, in the context of early bacterial biofilm development. Through computer simulations using an agent-based model, we have investigated the possibilities and limitations of modeling biofilm formation and growth using different models for interaction between bacteria, such as the Hertz model, Soft Repulsive Spherocylindrical (SRS) model, and attractive Kihara model. Our approach focuses on understanding how mechanical forces due to the interaction between cells, in addition to growth and diffusive parameters, influence the formation of complex bacterial communities. By comparing such force models, we evaluate their impact on the structural properties of bacterial microcolonies. The results indicate that, although the specific force model has some effect on biofilm properties, the intensity of the interaction between bacteria is the most important determinant. This study highlights the importance of properly selecting interaction strength in simulations to obtain realistic representations of biofilm growth, and suggests which adapted models of rod-shaped bacterial systems may offer a valid approach to study the dynamics of complex biofilms.

Title: Sliding and superlubric moiré twisting ferroelectric transition in HfO2
Authors: Jie Sun, Yiheng Shen, Tengfei Cao, Li-Min Liu
Abstract: Despite progress in HfO2 thin-film ferroelectrics, issues like high coercive fields persist, and the dynamics of twisted ferroelectricity remain largely unexplored. Here, we explore how sliding and twisting in bilayer HfO2 enables low barrier switching. Among 144 sliding configurations, two exhibit strong in-plane polarization (2360 pC/m) with a low switching barrier of 9.57 meV/f.u. Twisting generates polar textures associated with moiré patterns, which drive ferroelectricity via a soft zone-center mode, as revealed by machine-learning-assisted first-principles calculations. The in-plane (out-of-plane) polarization values for HfO2 at twist angles of 21.79°, 27.80°, and 46.83° are 430 (5.82), 367 (2.20), and 1057 (0.03) pC/m, respectively. For 21.79° and 27.80° twisting, switching barriers drop to 1.74 and 0.18 meV/f.u., indicating superlubric-like transitions. Notably, the 46.83° twisted bilayer shows an almost barrier-free polar evolution (0.03 meV /f.u.), attributed to sharply enhanced zone-center phonon linewidths. Our findings establish a moiré-engineered switching route for 2D ferroelectrics.

Title: Theory of charge-to-spin conversion under quantum confinement
Authors: Alfonso Maiellaro, Francesco Romeo, Mattia Trama, Irene Gaiardoni, Jacopo Settino, Claudio Guarcello, Nicolas Bergeal, Manuel Bibes, Roberta Citro
Abstract: The interplay between spin and charge degrees of freedom in low-dimensional systems is a cornerstone of modern spintronics, where achieving all-electrical control of spin currents is a major goal. Spin-orbit interactions provide a promising mechanism for such control, yet understanding how spin and charge transport emerge from microscopic principles remains a fundamental challenge. Here we develop a spin-dependent scattering matrix approach to describe spin and charge transport in a multiterminal system in the presence of Rashba spin-orbit interaction. Our framework generalizes the Büttiker formalism by offering explicit real-space expressions for spin and charge current densities, along with the corresponding linear response function. It simultaneously captures the effects of quantum confinement, the orbital response to external magnetic fields, and the intrinsic (geometric) properties of the electronic bands, offering a comprehensive description of the spin-charge interconversion mechanisms at play in a Hall bar, in agreement with experiments.

Title: Magnon thermal Hall effect in collinear ferrimagnets
Authors: Vladimir A. Zyuzin
Abstract: In this paper we theoretically discuss thermal Hall effect of magnons in insulating Néel ordered antiferromagnets at zero external magnetic field. We show that for compensated Néel order the non-zero thermal Hall effect will occur inthe absence of any symmetry between the two magnetic sublattices, thus making the system ferrimagnetic. The thermal Hall effect of magnons will be non-zero by a virtue of the spin-momentum splitting of the magnon spectrum due to the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction as well as anisotropic second-nearest exchange interaction different in the two magnetic sublattices, both corresponding to the broken symmetry. We construct a theoretical model in which an external electric field may change the symmetry of the antiferromagnetic system thus altering the thermal Hall effect of magnons.

Title: Optical Controllable Spin-Polarization in Two Dimensional Altermagnets via Robust Spin-Momentum Locking Excitons
Authors: Jiuyu Sun, Jinzhe Han, Yongping Du, Erjun Kan
Abstract: Spin-momentum locking (SML) excitons in two-dimensional semiconductors are appealing to programmable optical control of spin-polarized carriers in ultrafast spintronics. To address the current thirsty for long-lived excitons with zero-external-field stability and room-temperature spin-polarization, we hereby predict the existence of intrinsically SML excitons in altermagnetic V$_2 X_2$O ($X=$ S, Se) driven by giant non-relativistic spin-splittings ($>$ 1.2 eV). First-principles calculations reveal SML excitons with binding energies exceeding 1400 meV in monolayers and 430 meV in their van der Waals heterobilayers, along with stacking-dependent optical selection rules for tunable interlayer excitons. These remarkable physical properties, combined with their long radiative lifetimes, strongly suggest the feasibility of SML excitons with robust spin-polarization at room temperature. Our work provides a new paradigm for SML exciton physics via the novel altermagnetism, opening up new possibilities for all-optical manipulation in advanced opto-spintronics.

Title: Classical spin liquids from frustrated Ising models in hyperbolic space
Authors: Fabian Köhler, Johanna Erdmenger, Roderich Moessner, Matthias Vojta
Abstract: Antiferromagnetic Ising models on frustrated lattices can realize classical spin liquids, with highly degenerate ground states and, possibly, fractionalized excitations and emergent gauge fields. Motivated by the recent interest in many-body system in negatively curved space, we study hyperbolic frustrated Ising models. Specifically, we consider nearest-neighbor Ising models on tesselations with odd-length loops in two-dimensional hyperbolic space. For finite systems with open boundaries we determine the ground-state degeneracy exactly, and we perform extensive finite-temperature Monte-Carlo simulations to obtain thermodynamic data as well as correlation functions. We show that the shape of the boundary, constituting an extensive part of the system, can be used to control low-energy states: Depending on the boundary, we find ordered or disordered ground states. Our results demonstrate how geometric frustration acts in curved space to produce classical spin liquids.

Title: Optimal control strategy for collisional Brownian engines
Authors: Gustavo A. L. Forão
Abstract: Collisional Brownian engines have recently gained attention as alternatives to conventional nanoscale engines. However, a comprehensive optimization of their performance, which could serve as a benchmark for future engine designs, is still lacking. In this work, we address this gap by deriving and analyzing the optimal driving protocol for a collisional Brownian engine. By maximizing the average output work, we show that the optimal protocol consists of linear force segments separated by impulsive delta-like kicks that instantaneously reverse the particle's velocity. This structure enforces constant velocity within each stroke, enabling fully analytical expressions for optimal output power, efficiency, and entropy production. We demonstrate that the optimal protocol significantly outperforms standard strategies (such as constant, linear, or periodic drivings) achieving higher performance while keeping entropy production under control. Remarkably, when evaluated using realistic experimental parameters, the efficiency approaches near-unity at the power optimum, with entropy production remaining well controlled, a striking feature of the optimal protocol. To analyze a more realistic scenario, we examine the impact of smoothing the delta-like forces by introducing a finite duration and find that, although this reduces efficiency and increases entropy production, the optimal protocol still delivers high power output in a robust manner. Altogether, our results provide a theoretical benchmark for finite-time thermodynamic optimization of Brownian engines under time-periodic drivings.

Title: Probing dynamical axion quasiparticles with two-photon correlations
Authors: Daniel Boyanovsky
Abstract: Dynamical axion (quasi) particles are emergent collective excitations in topological magnetic insulators that break parity and time reversal invariance or in Weyl semimetals. They couple to electromagnetism via a topological Chern-Simons term, leading to their decay into two photons. We extend the Weisskopf-Wigner formulation of atomic spontaneous emission to the quantum field theory of dynamical axion quasiparticles, allowing us to obtain the quantum two-photon state emerging from axion decay in real time. This state features \emph{hyperentanglement} in momentum and polarization with a distinct polarization pattern, a consequence of the parity and time reversal breaking of the axion-photon interaction. Polarization aspects of this two-photon state are studied by introducing quantum Stokes operators. Whereas the two-photon quantum state features vanishing \emph{averages} of the degree of polarization and polarization asymmetry, there are non-trivial momentum correlations of the Stokes operators. In particular momentum correlations of the \emph{polarization asymmetry} can be obtained directly from coincident momentum and polarization resolved two photon detection. Correlations of Stokes operators are directly related to momentum and polarization resolved Hanbury-Brown Twiss second order coherences. This relationship suggests two-photon correlations as a direct probe of dynamical axion quasiparticles. Similarities and differences with parametrically down converted photons and other systems where spontaneous emission yield hyperentangled two photon states are recognized, suggesting experimental avenues similar to tests of Bell inequalities to probe dynamical axion quasiparticles with coincident two photon detection.

Title: How universal is the mean-field universality class for percolation in complex networks?
Authors: Lorenzo Cirigliano
Abstract: Clustering and degree correlations are ubiquitous in real-world complex networks. Yet, understanding their role in critical phenomena remains a challenge for theoretical studies. Here, we provide the exact solution of site percolation in a model for strongly clustered random graphs, with many overlapping loops and heterogeneous degree distribution. We systematically compare the exact solution with heterogeneous mean-field predictions obtained from a treelike random rewiring of the network, which preserves only the degree sequence. Our results demonstrate a nontrivial interplay between degree heterogeneity, correlations and network topology, which can significantly alter both the percolation threshold and the critical exponents predicted by the heterogeneous mean-field. These findings reveal limitations of heterogeneous mean-field theory, demonstrating that the degree distribution alone is insufficient to determine universality classes in complex networks with realistic structural features.

Title: Entanglement and quench dynamics in the thermally perturbed tricritical fixed point
Authors: Csilla Király, Máté Lencsés
Abstract: We consider the Blume--Capel model in the scaling limit to realize the thermal perturbation of the tricritical Ising fixed point. We develop a numerical scaling limit extrapolation for one-point functions and Rényi entropies in the ground state. In a mass quench scenario, we found long-lived oscillations despite the absence of explicit spin-flip symmetry breaking or confining potential. We construct form factors of branch-point twist fields in the paramagnetic phase. In the scaling limit of small quenches, we verify form factor predictions for the energy density and leading magnetic field using the dynamics of one-point functions, and branch-point twist fields using the dynamics of Rényi entropies.

Title: Quasiconservation Laws and Suppressed Transport in Weakly Interacting Localized Models
Authors: Jessica Kaijia Jiang, Federica Maria Surace, Olexei I. Motrunich
Abstract: The stability of localization in the presence of interactions remains an open problem, with finite-size effects posing significant challenges to numerical studies. In this work, we investigate the perturbative stability of noninteracting localization under weak interactions, which allows us to analyze much larger system sizes. Focusing on disordered Anderson and quasiperiodic Aubry-André models in one dimension, and using the adiabatic gauge potential (AGP) at first order in perturbation theory, we compute first-order corrections to noninteracting local integrals of motion (LIOMs). We find that for at least an $O(1)$ fraction of the LIOMs, the corrections are well-controlled and converge at large system sizes, while others suffer from resonances. Additionally, we introduce and study the charge-transport capacity of this weakly interacting model. To first order, we find that the charge transport capacity remains bounded in the presence of interactions. Taken together, these results demonstrate that localization is perturbatively stable to weak interactions at first order, implying that, at the very least, localization persists for parametrically long times in the inverse interaction strength. We expect this perturbative stability to extend to all orders at sufficiently strong disorder, where the localization length is short, representing the true localized phase. Conversely, our findings suggest that the previously proposed interaction-induced avalanche instability, namely in the weakly localized regime of the Anderson and Aubry-André models, is a more subtle phenomenon arising only at higher orders in perturbation theory or through nonperturbative effects.

Title: Quantum vortex dipole as a probe of the normal component distribution
Authors: Andrea Barresi, Piotr Magierski, Gabriel Wlazłowski
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of quantum vortex dipoles in a strongly interacting, spin-imbalanced Fermi superfluid at zero temperature. Using fully microscopic time-dependent density functional theory, we demonstrate that the dipole trajectory is strongly influenced by the spatial distribution of spin polarization. The resulting forces on the vortices include both longitudinal and transverse components, leading to deflection and shrinking of the dipole during propagation. For moderate polarization, vortex dipoles are deflected and lose energy, while for larger imbalances, they are rapidly annihilated. Our findings provide compelling evidence that spin-imbalanced Fermi gases contain a spatially nonuniform normal component even at zero temperature. We show that vortex dipoles serve as sensitive probes of this component, offering a route to indirectly detect exotic superfluid phases such as the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov state and related inhomogeneous condensates.

Title: Static treatment of dynamic interactions in the single-orbital Anderson impurity model
Authors: Anton Pauli, Akshat Mishra, Malte Rösner, Erik G.C.P. van Loon
Abstract: Correlated electron physics is intrinsically a multiscale problem, since high-energy electronic states screen the interactions between the correlated electrons close to the Fermi level, thereby reducing the magnitude of the interaction strength and dramatically shortening its range. Thus, the handling of screening is an essential ingredient in the first-principles modelling of correlated electron systems. Screening is an intrinsically dynamic process and the corresponding downfolding methods such as the constrained Random Phase Approximation indeed produce a dynamic interaction. However, many low-energy methods require an instantaneous interaction as input, which makes it necessary to map the fully dynamic interaction to an effective instantaneous interaction strength. It is a priori not clear if and when such an effective model can capture the physics of the one with dynamic interaction and how to best perform the mapping. Here, we provide a systematic benchmark relevant to correlated materials, in the form of the Anderson impurity model. Overall, we find that a static approximation can be valid and that the moment-based approach recently proposed by Scott and Booth can be a good tool to find the value of the static interaction. We also identify physical regimes, especially under doping, where an instantaneous interaction cannot capture all of the relevant physics.

Title: Ontological differentiation as a measure of semantic accuracy
Authors: Pablo Garcia-Cuadrillero, Fabio Revuelta, Jose Angel Capitan
Abstract: Understanding semantic relationships within complex networks derived from lexical resources is fundamental for network science and language modeling. While network embedding methods capture contextual similarity, quantifying semantic distance based directly on explicit definitional structure remains challenging. Accurate measures of semantic similarity allow for navigation on lexical networks based on maximizing semantic similarity in each navigation jump (Semantic Navigation, SN). This work introduces Ontological Differentiation (OD), a formal method for measuring divergence between concepts by analyzing overlap during recursive definition expansion. The methodology is applied to networks extracted from the Simple English Wiktionary, comparing OD scores with other measures of semantic similarity proposed in the literature (cosine similarity based on random-walk network exploration). We find weak correlations between direct pairwise OD scores and cosine similarities across $\sim$~2 million word pairs, sampled from a pool representing over 50\% of the entries in the Wiktionary lexicon. This establishes OD as a largely independent, definition-based semantic metric, whose orthogonality to cosine similarity becomes more pronounced when low-semantic-content terms were removed from the dataset. Additionally, we use cumulative OD scores to evaluate paths generated by vector-based SN and structurally optimal Shortest Paths (SP) across networks. We find SN paths consistently exhibit significantly lower cumulative OD scores than shortest paths, suggesting that SN produces trajectories more coherent with the dictionary's definitional structure, as measured by OD. Ontological Differentiation thus provides a novel, definition-grounded tool for analyzing, validating, and potentially constructing navigation processes in lexical networks.

Title: Emergent Distance and Metricity of Mutual Information in 1D Quantum Chains
Authors: Beau Leighton-Trudel
Abstract: We develop and formalize a phase diagnostic based on the information-distance \(d_E = K_0/\sqrt{I}\) (mutual information \(I\)) for 1D quantum chains. Calibrating with the Euclidean benchmark \(I(r)\propto r^{-2}\mapsto d_E(r)\propto r\) makes the triangle-inequality test parameter-free and scale-invariant. Under site-averaged, monotone scaling conditions on the 1D line we establish a criterion linking the decay of \(I(r)\) to metric behavior of \(d_E(r)\): power laws \(I(r)\sim r^{-X}\) with \(0<X\le 2\) yield subadditivity (metric scaling), while exponential clustering leads to superadditivity. As an analytic check complementing our earlier numerical study, we verify these predictions in the 1D transverse-field Ising chain using an exact Jordan-Wigner/Bogoliubov-de Gennes solution: at criticality \(I(r)\) follows a power law close to the \(X=2\) benchmark and the equal-legs triangle defect \(\Delta(r,r)=d_E(2r)-2d_E(r)\) is asymptotically non-positive; in gapped regimes \(I(r)\) decays exponentially and \(\Delta(r,r)\gg 0\). The result is a practical, falsifiable large-scale diagnostic based solely on site-averaged two-site mutual information.

Title: Bipartite entanglement and surface criticality: The extra contribution of non-ordinary edge in entanglement
Authors: Yanzhang Zhu, Zenan Liu, Zhe Wang, Yan-Cheng Wang, Zheng Yan
Abstract: Recent works on the scaling behaviors of entanglement entropy at the SO(5) deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP) sparked a huge controversy. Different bipartitions gave out totally different conclusions for whether the DQCP is consistent with a unitary conformal field theory. In this work, we connect two previously disconnected fields -- the many-body entanglement and the surface criticality -- to reveal the behaviors of entanglement entropy in various bipartite scenarios, and point out that only the ordinary bipartition purely reflects the criticality of the bulk; otherwise, the extra gapless edge mode will also contribute to the entanglement. We have demonstrated that the correspondence between the entanglement spectrum and the edge energy spectrum still approximately persists even at a bulk-gapless point, thereby influencing the behavior of entanglement entropy. Our results establish that boundary conditions induced by the cut are decisive for entanglement-based probes and provide practical protocols to separate bulk from boundary contributions.

Title: MicroLad: 2D-to-3D Microstructure Reconstruction and Generation via Latent Diffusion and Score Distillation
Authors: Kang-Hyun Lee, Faez Ahmed
Abstract: A major obstacle to establishing reliable structure-property (SP) linkages in materials engineering is the scarcity of diverse 3D microstructure datasets. Limited dataset availability and insufficient control over the analysis and design space restrict the variety of achievable microstructure morphologies, hindering progress in solving the inverse (property-to-structure) design problem. To address these challenges, we introduce MicroLad, a latent diffusion framework specifically designed for reconstructing 3D microstructures from 2D data. Trained on 2D images and employing multi-plane denoising diffusion sampling in the latent space, the framework reliably generates stable and coherent 3D volumes that remain statistically consistent with the original data. While this reconstruction capability enables dimensionality expansion (2D-to-3D) for generating statistically equivalent 3D samples from 2D data, effective exploration of microstructure design requires methods to guide the generation process toward specific objectives. To achieve this, MicroLad integrates score distillation sampling (SDS), which combines a differentiable score loss with microstructural descriptor-matching and property-alignment terms. This approach updates encoded 2D slices of the 3D volume in the latent space, enabling robust inverse-controlled 2D-to-3D microstructure generation. Consequently, the method facilitates exploration of an expanded 3D microstructure analysis and design space in terms of both microstructural descriptors and material properties.

Title: Intermittent localization and fast spatial learning by non-Markov random walks with decaying memory
Authors: Paulina R. Martín-Cornejo, Denis Boyer
Abstract: Random walks on lattices with preferential relocation to previously visited sites provide a simple framework for modeling the displacements of animals and humans. When the lattice contains a few impurities or resource sites where the walker spends more time on average at each visit than on the other sites, the long range memory can suppress diffusion and induce by reinforcement a steady state localized around a resource. This phenomenon can be identified with a spatial learning process. Here we study theoretically and numerically how the decay of memory impacts learning in a model with one impurity. If memory decays as $1/\tau$ or slower, where $\tau$ is the time backward into the past, the localized solution is the same as with perfect, non-decaying memory and it is linearly stable. If forgetting is faster than $1/\tau$, for instance exponential, an unusual regime of intermittent localization is observed, where well localized periods of exponentially distributed duration are disrupted by possibly long intervals of diffusive motion. At the transition between the two regimes, for a kernel in $1/\tau$, the approach to the stable localized state is the fastest, opposite to the expected critical slowing down effect. Hence, forgetting can allow the walker to save a lot of memory without compromising learning and to achieve a faster learning process. These findings agree with biological evidence on the benefits of forgetting.

Abstract: Infinite-layer (IL) nickelates have rapidly emerged as a new class of superconductors. However, due to the technical challenges of their topotactic synthesis, they have so far been realized primarily as thin films or polycrystalline powder samples, limiting comprehensive investigations of fundamental physical properties such as the lattice dynamics. Here, we present a time-of-flight inelastic neutron scattering study on a sample composed of a large number of co-aligned bulk crystals of the IL nickelate LaNiO$_2$. We observe several dispersive phonon branches, which are in good agreement with lattice dynamical calculations based on density-functional perturbation theory. In addition, we compare the characteristics of selected LaNiO$_2$ phonon modes to those of isostructural cuprate superconductors. Our findings provide a reference point for future experimental and theoretical efforts aimed at understanding the interplay between lattice dynamics and electronic properties in IL nickelates.

Title: Quantum Transport Reservoir Computing
Authors: Yecheng Jing, Pengfei Wang, Shuai Zhang, Zhoujie Zeng, Shi-Jun Liang, Wei Chen
Abstract: Reservoir computing (RC), a neural network designed for temporal data, enables efficient computation with low-cost training and direct physical implementation. Recently, quantum RC has opened new possibilities for conventional RC and introduced novel ideas to tackle open problems in quantum physics and advance quantum technologies. Despite its promise, it faces challenges, including physical realization, output readout, and measurement-induced back-action. Here, we propose to implement quantum RC through quantum transport in mesoscopic electronic systems. Our approach possesses several advantages: compatibility with existing device fabrication techniques, ease of output measurement, and robustness against measurement back-action. Leveraging universal conductance fluctuations, we numerically demonstrate two benchmark tasks, spoken-digit recognition and time-series forecasting, to validate our proposal. This work establishes a novel pathway for implementing on-chip quantum RC via quantum transport and expands the mesoscopic physics applications.

Title: Relativistic Mott transition and high-order van Hove singularity in twisted double bilayer WSe${}_2$: mean-field and functional renormalization group study
Authors: Bilal Hawashin, Julian Kleeschulte, David Kurz, Aiman Al-Eryani, Michael M. Scherer
Abstract: Experiments on twisted double bilayer tungsten diselenide have demonstrated that moir'e semiconductors can realize a relativistic Mott transition, i.e., a quantum phase transition from a Dirac semimetal to a correlated insulating state, by twist-angle tuning. In addition, signatures of van Hove singularities were observed in the material's moir'e valence bands, suggesting further potential for the emergence of strongly-correlated states. Based on a continuum model, we provide a detailed analysis of the twist-angle dependence of the system's band structure, focusing on the evolution of the Dirac excitations and the Fermi-surface structure with its Lifshitz transitions across the van Hove fillings. We exhibit that the twist angle can be used to band engineer a high-order van Hove singularity, which can be accessed by gate tuning. We then study the magnetic phase diagram of an effective Hubbard model for twisted double bilayer tungsten diselenide on the effective honeycomb superlattice with tight-binding parameters fitted to the two topmost bands of the continuum model. To that end, we employ a self-consistent Hartree-Fock mean-field approach in real space. Fixing the angle-dependent Hubbard interaction based on the experimental findings, we explore a broad parameter range of twist angle, filling, and temperature. We find a rich variety of magnetic states that we expect to be accessible in future experiments, including, e.g., a non-coplanar spin-density wave with non-zero spin chirality and a half-metallic uniaxial spin-density wave. Finally, we employ a functional renormalization group approach to also study the competition between density-wave and superconducting instabilities. For twist angles of $\theta=2.0^\circ, 2.5^\circ$, as well as $\theta\approx 3.5^\circ$ -- where the high-order van Hove-singularity is found -- we find clear indications for unconventional superconductivity.

Title: Thermal History Asymmetry and Dissipation in Dense Colloidal Microgel Glasses
Authors: Sonali Vasant Kawale, Yogesh M Joshi, Ranjini Bandyopadhyay
Abstract: Microstructurally arrested matter, from molecular glasses to soft glassy materials, can retain a memory of their thermal or mechanical (shear) histories. Their history-dependent and nonlinear microstructural recoveries have been studied within the Kovacs framework. Here, we applied the temperature ramps of varying magnitudes to dense colloidal suspensions of thermoresponsive, deformable and compressible microgel particles should serve as an effective strategy to probe the nonlinear path-dependent structural recovery of these systems. We synthesised Poly (N-isopropyl acrylamide) (PNIPAM) microgel particles using the free radical precipitation polymerisation method. Using oscillatory rheology, we studied the relaxations of the viscoelastic moduli of dense PNIPAM suspensions that were heated and cooled at various temperature ramp rates. Path-dependent structural recovery was quantified by studying the asymmetric approach of the suspension elastic modulus toward the target temperature during the heating and cooling temperature ramps. The loss modulus peaks, observed at the times of initiation and termination of the temperature ramps, were understood to arise from energy dissipation due to microgel rearrangement events. The heights of the peaks were found to be inversely correlated with the asymmetry in the elastic response. Our work highlights the important role of energy dissipation through microgel rearrangements in eliminating path-dependent asymmetries in the storage moduli of dense PNIPAM suspensions subjected to thermal shocks. By tuning the applied temperature ramp rate and particle packing density, therefore, asymmetric storage modulus relaxations in dense systems can be modulated via adjustments of the accessible free volume.

Title: Phase transitions and polarization switching in quasi-one-dimensional organic ferroelectrics of phenyltetrazole family
Authors: A.P.Moina
Abstract: Pseudospin models are proposed for description of the phase transitions, dielectric characteristics, and polarization switching in two crystals of the phenyltetrazole family. One of them, APHTZ, is a canted ferroelectric, whereas the other, MPHTZ is a simple antiferroelectric. In APHTZ the electric field, applied perpendicularly to the axis of spontaneous polarization, flips the polarization in one of the two sublattices, effectively rotating the non-zero net polarization by 90$^\circ$ and switching the system between two different ferroelectric configurations. The temperature-electric field phase diagrams are constructed. The diagram topology appears to be typical for the Ising-like antiferroelectric systems.

Title: Three-Dimensional Electrostatic and Quantum-Confinement Modeling of Silicon Nanowire Double Quantum Dots
Authors: Nilesh Pandey, Dipanjan Basu, Leonard F Register, Sanjay K Banerjee
Abstract: We present a three-dimensional simulation study of silicon nanowire double quantum dots (DQDs) with leads at T = 2 K, which extends beyond traditional effective mass or quasi-1D and quasi-2D approaches typically applied to bulk or planar geometries. A 3-D Poisson solver is self-consistently coupled to 2-D Schrodinger along slices normal to transport (width * thickness) to obtain spatially varying subbands and wavefunctions at T = 2 K. The slice approximation is justified by the large aspect ratio (Ltot/W > 20) and by the small (< 1.2 percent) wavefunction variation observed along the transport direction. The resulting effective conduction-band profile is imported into a full-wave, open-boundary Schrodinger solver to compute the transmission spectrum T(E), and the tunnel coupling (tc) is evaluated from the bonding and antibonding splitting of the first two resonances in T(E). The simulations show that narrow dots (W = 5 nm) provide strong confinement and robust single-electron localization but require higher plunger-gate voltage, whereas wider dots (W = 20 nm) load electrons at lower bias but form shallower, more delocalized states. The tunnel coupling decreases as the dot width and length are increased, due to the reduced wavefunction overlap between the dots, and saturates once W > 2LPG, when longitudinal confinement is dominated by the plunger gate length. The simulated tunnel coupling trend agrees with experimental data reported for the Si DQD device.

Title: Ultralow-Cost magnetocaloric compound for Cryogenic Cooling
Authors: Wei Liu, Benjamin Theisel, Yulia Klunnikova, Konstantin Skokov, Oliver Gutfleisch
Abstract: Cost-effective materials are essential for large-scale deployment. The emerging magnetocaloric hydrogen liquefaction technology could transform the liquid hydrogen industry due to its potential in achieving higher efficiency. Most studies of the cryogenic magnetocaloric effect (MCE) have focused on resource-critical rare-earth-based compounds. Here we report on an ionic magnetocaloric compound FeCl$_2$ which is based on ultralow-cost elements, as a candidate working material for hydrogen liquefaction. FeCl$_2$ shows both inverse and conventional MCE. From 0 to 1.5 T, the inverse effect yields a positive magnetic entropy change ($\Delta S_T$) of about 5 J/kg/K near 20 K, then declines toward zero at higher fields. In contrast, the conventional (negative) response strengthens with field. The $\Delta S_T$ reaches 18.6 J/kg/K near 20 K in magnetic fields of 5 T. This value exceeds most light rare-earth-based compounds and approaches that of heavy rare-earth-based compounds. In magnetic fields of 5 T, the adiabatic temperature change reaches about 3.6 K. The large $\Delta S_T$, along with the low cost of the elements in FeCl$_2$, are prerequisites for inexpensive industrial-scale production, giving the prospect of a practical magnetocaloric candidate for hydrogen liquefaction in the 20 $\sim$ 77 K temperature window.

Title: Tuneable ion selectivity in vermiculite membranes intercalated with unexchangeable ions
Authors: Zhuang Liu, Yumei Tan, Jianhao Qian, Min Cao, Eli Hoenig, Guowei Yang, Fengchao Wang, Francois M. Peeters, Yi-Chao Zou, Liang-Yin Chu, Marcelo Lozada-Hidalgo
Abstract: Membranes selective to ions of the same charge are increasingly sought for wastewater processing and valuable element recovery. However, while narrow channels are known to be essential, other membrane parameters remain difficult to identify and control. Here we show that Zr$^{4+}$, Sn$^{4+}$, Ir$^{4+}$, and La$^{3+}$ ions intercalated into vermiculite laminate membranes become effectively unexchangeable, creating stable channels, one to two water layers wide, that exhibit robust and tuneable ion selectivity. Ion permeability in these membranes spans five orders of magnitude, following a trend dictated by the ions' Gibbs free energy of hydration. Unexpectedly, different intercalated ions lead to two distinct monovalent ion selectivity sequences, despite producing channels of identical width. The selectivity instead correlates with the membranes' stiffness and the entropy of hydration of the intercalated ions. These results introduce a new ion selectivity mechanism driven by entropic and mechanical effects, beyond classical size and charge exclusion.

Title: Maximum Quantum Work at Criticality: Stirling Engines and Fibonacci-Lucas Degeneracies
Authors: Bastian Castorene, Martin HvE Groves, Francisco J. Peña, Eugenio E. Vogel, Patricio Vargas
Abstract: Many-body effects and quantum criticality play a central role in determining the performance of quantum thermal machines. Although operating near a quantum critical point (QCP) is known to enhance engine performance, the precise thermodynamic conditions required to attain the Carnot efficiency limit remain unsettled. Here, we derive the exact conditions for a quantum Stirling engine to achieve Carnot efficiency when a QCP drives its working medium. In the low-temperature regime, where only the ground-state manifold is populated, the net work output is given by $ W = k_B \delta \ln (g_{\text{crit}}/g_0) $ with $ \delta = T_H - T_L $, which directly yields the Carnot efficiency $ \eta_C = 1 - T_L/T_H $, independent of microscopic details. Notably, whereas ideal Stirling cycles attain Carnot efficiency only with a perfect regenerator, here no regenerator is required because, at low temperatures, the thermal population remains confined to the degenerate ground state; this represents a clear quantum advantage over engines with classical working substances. We validate this universal result by recovering known behaviors in various quantum systems, including spin chains with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions and magnetic anisotropies. Applying the framework to the one-dimensional antiferromagnetic Ising model, we predict non-extensive scaling of the work output governed by Fibonacci and Lucas numbers for open chains and closed rings, respectively, which converges to classical extensivity in the thermodynamic limit. This analysis establishes a general and robust foundation for designing quantum thermal machines that reach the Carnot bound while delivering finite work.

Title: Evaluation of Wafer-Scale SOT-MRAM for Analog Crossbar Array Applications
Authors: Samuel Liu, Chen-Yu Hu, Ming-Yuan Song, Xinyu Bao, Jean Anne C. Incorvia
Abstract: Analog crossbar arrays consisting of emerging memory devices can greatly alleviate the computational strain required by vector matrix multiplications for neural network applications. The ability to produce spin orbit torque-magnetic random-access memory (SOT-MRAM) at wafer-scale positions SOT-MRAM as a strong memory candidate. In this work, we fabricate and measure 300 mm-compatible SOT-MRAM with 150% tunnel magnetoresistance ratio, fast (2 ns) and low voltage (<1 V) operation, low energy dissipation (350 fJ), low write noise (0.1%), and low device-to-device variation of 10%. Through 2-bit quantization aware training and noisy training as mitigation techniques, the measured SOT-MRAM devices attain 95% on MNIST. The bi-stable anisotropy and stochastic switching of SOT-MRAM can additionally be leveraged for stochastic training of binary neural networks, able to reach ideal accuracy for a single device. Lastly, the devices were evaluated on implementation of probabilistic graph modeling and the interplay of tunnel magnetoresistance ratio, probability curve distribution, and conductance noise was shown to reduce potential errors in implementation. Through these results, SOT-MRAM is shown to be a uniquely effective candidate for implementation of crossbar accelerators in memory- and energy-limited applications, able to take advantage of stochastic operation and bi-stability to beneficial results in neural network applications.

Title: Diffusion velocity modulus of self-propelled spherical and circular particles in the generalized Langevin approach
Authors: Pedro J. Colmenares
Abstract: This research provides a framework for describing the averaged modulus of the velocity reached by an accelerated self-propelled Brownian particle diffusing in a thermal fluid and constrained to a harmonic external potential. The system is immersed in a thermal bath of harmonic oscillators at a constant temperature, where its constituents also interact with the external field. The dynamics is investigated for a sphere and a disk, and is split into two stochastic processes. The first describes the gross-grained inner time-dependent self-velocity generated from a set of independent Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes without the influence of the external field. This internal mechanism provides the initial velocity for the particle to diffuse in the fluid, which is implemented in a modified generalized Langevin equation as the second process. We find that the system exhibits spontaneous fluctuations in the diffusive velocity modulus due to the inner mechanism; however, as expected, the momentary diffusive velocity fluctuations fade out at large times. The internal propelled velocity module in spherical coordinates is derived, as well as the simulation of the different modules for both the sphere and the already known equations for a disk in polar coordinates.

Title: Poroelasticity in the presence of active fluids

Abstract: This work presents a model for characterizing porous, deformable media embedded with magnetorheological fluids (MRFs). These active fluids exhibit tunable mechanical and rheological properties that can be controlled through the application of a magnetic field, which induces a phase transition from a liquid to a solid-like state. This transition profoundly affects both stress transmission and fluid flow within the composite, leading to a behaviour governed by a well-defined threshold that depends on the ratio between the pore size and the characteristic size of clusters of magnetic particles, and can be triggered by adjusting the magnetic field intensity. These effects were confirmed through an experimental campaign conducted on a prototype composite obtained by imbibing a selected MRF into commercial sponges. To design and optimize this new class of materials, a linear poroelastic formulation is proposed and validated through comparison with experimental results. The constitutive relationships, i.e. overall elastic constitutive tensor and permeability, of the model are updated from phenomenological observations, exploiting the experimental data obtained for both the pure fluid and the composite material. The findings demonstrate that the proposed simplified formulation is sufficiently robust to predict and optimize the behaviour of porous media containing MRFs. Such materials hold significant promise for a wide range of engineering applications, including adaptive exosuits for human tissue and joint rehabilitation, as well as innovative structural systems.

Title: Tuning the Electronic Structure of Graphene by Controlling Spatial Confinement
Authors: Mohammadamir Bazrafshan, Thomas. D. Kühne
Abstract: The electronic properties of a material depend on the spatial freedom of the electron wavefunction. A well-known example is graphite, which is a conventional gapless semiconductor, while a single layer of it, graphene, exhibits extremely high electronic conductivity. Nevertheless, graphene ribbons can have different physical properties, such as a tunable band gap, from gapless to large band gap semiconductor. The purpose of this study is to investigate the electronic structure of graphene few-layers composed of a layer of graphene nanoribbons and graphene sheet(s), where quasi-one-dimensional nanoribbons can interact with two-dimensional sheet of graphite. Using the tight-binding model for graphite, we show how different configuration of such heterostructures can affect the electronic structure, in which is different from their components electronic structure. Namely, a gap of ~0.6 eV can be opened in a bilayer configuration composed of a layer of gapless armchair nanoribbon stacked on graphene.

Title: Exploring the limit of the Lattice-Bisognano-Wichmann form describing the Entanglement Hamiltonian: A quantum Monte Carlo study
Authors: Siyi Yang, Yi-Ming Ding, Zheng Yan
Abstract: The entanglement Hamiltonian (EH) encapsulates the essential entanglement properties of a quantum many-body system and serves as a powerful theoretical construct. From the EH, one can extract a variety of entanglement quantities, such as entanglement entropies, negativity, and the entanglement spectrum. However, its general analytical form remains largely unknown. While the Bisognano-Wichmann theorem gives an exact EH form for Lorentz-invariant field theories, its validity on lattice systems is limited, especially when Lorentz invariance is absent. In this work, we propose a general scheme based on the lattice-Bisognano-Wichmann (LBW) ansatz and multi-replica-trick quantum Monte Carlo methods to numerically reconstruct the entanglement Hamiltonian in two-dimensional systems and systematically explore its applicability to systems without translational invariance, going beyond the original scope of the primordial Bisognano-Wichmann theorem. Various quantum phases--including gapped and gapless phases, critical points, and phases with either discrete or continuous symmetry breaking--are investigated, demonstrating the versatility of our method in reconstructing entanglement Hamiltonians. Furthermore, we find that when the entanglement boundary of a system is ordinary (i.e., free from surface anomalies), the LBW ansatz provides an accurate approximation well beyond Lorentz-invariant cases. Our work thus establishes a general framework for investigating the analytical structure of entanglement in complex quantum many-body systems.

Title: Minimum Action Principle for Entropy Production Rate of Far-From-Equilibrium Systems
Authors: Atul Tanaji Mohite, Heiko Rieger
Abstract: The Boltzmann distribution connects the energetics of an equilibrium system with its statistical properties, and it is desirable to have a similar principle for non-equilibrium systems. Here, we derive a variational principle for the entropy production rate (EPR) of far-from-equilibrium discrete state systems, relating it to the action for the transition probability measure of discrete state processes. This principle leads to a tighter, non-quadratic formulation of the dissipation function, speed limits, the thermodynamic-kinetic uncertainty relation, the large deviation rate functional, and the fluctuation relation, all within a unified framework of the thermodynamic length. Additionally, the optimal control of non-conservative transition affinities using the underlying geodesic structure is explored, and the corresponding slow-driving and finite-time optimal driving exact protocols are analytically computed. We demonstrate that discontinuous endpoint jumps in optimal protocols are a generic, model-independent physical mechanism that reduces entropy production during finite-time driving of far-from-equilibrium systems.

Title: Thermodynamic Length in Stochastic Thermodynamics of Far-From-Equilibrium Systems: Unification of Fluctuation Relation and Thermodynamic Uncertainty Relation
Authors: Atul Tanaji Mohite, Heiko Rieger
Abstract: The Boltzmann distribution for an equilibrium system constrains the statistics of the system by the energetics. Despite the non-equilibrium generalization of the Boltzmann distribution being studied extensively, a unified framework valid for far-from-equilibrium discrete state systems is lacking. Here, we derive an exact path-integral representation for discrete state processes and represent it using the exponential of the action for stochastic transition dynamics. Solving the variational problem, the effective action is shown to be equal to the inferred entropy production rate (a thermodynamic quantity) and a non-quadratic dissipation function of the thermodynamic length (TL) defined for microscopic stochastic currents (a dynamic quantity). This formulates a far-from-equilibrium analog of the Boltzmann distribution, namely, the minimum action principle. The non-quadratic dissipation function is physically attributed to incorporating non-Gaussian fluctuations or far-from-equilibrium non-conservative driving. Further, an exact large deviation dynamical rate functional is derived. The equivalence of the variational formulation with the information geometric formulation is proved. The non-quadratic TL recovers the non-quadratic thermodynamic-kinetic uncertainty relation (TKUR) and the speed limits, which are tighter than the close-to-equilibrium quadratic formulations. Moreover, if the transition affinities are known, the non-quadratic TL recovers the fluctuation relation (FR). The minimum action principle manifests the non-quadratic TKUR and FR as two faces corresponding to the thermodynamic inference and partial control descriptions, respectively. In addition, the validity of these results is extended to coarse-grained observable currents, strengthening the experimental/numerical applicability of them.

Title: Generalized Finite-time Optimal Control Framework in Stochastic Thermodynamics
Authors: Atul Tanaji Mohite, Heiko Rieger
Abstract: Optimal processes in stochastic thermodynamics are a frontier for understanding the control and design of non-equilibrium systems, with broad practical applications in biology, chemistry, and nanoscale/mesoscale systems. Optimal mass transport theory and thermodynamic geometry have emerged as optimal control methodology, but they are based on slow-driving and close to equilibrium assumptions. An optimal control framework in stochastic thermodynamics for finite time driving is still elusive. Therefore, we solve in this paper an optimal control problem for changing the control parameters of a discrete-state far-from-equilibrium process from an initial to a final value in finite-time. Optimal driving protocols are derived that minimize the total finite-time dissipation cost for the driving process. Our framework reveals that discontinuous endpoint jumps are a generic, model-independent physical mechanism that minimizes the optimal driving entropy production, whose importance is further amplified for far-from-equilibrium systems. The thermodynamic and dynamic physical interpretation and understanding of discontinuous endpoint jumps is formulated. An exact mapping between the finite-time to slow driving optimal control formulation is elucidated, developing the state-of-the-art of optimal mass transport theory and thermodynamic geometry, which has been the current paradigm for studying optimal processes in stochastic thermodynamics that relies on slow driving assumptions. Our framework opens up a plethora of applications to the thermodynamically efficient control of a far-from-equilibrium system in finite-time, which opens up a way to their efficient design principles.

Title: Poisson structure and Integrability of a Hamiltonian flow for the inhomogeneous six-vertex model
Authors: Pete Rigas
Abstract: We compute the action-angle variables for a Hamiltonian flow of the inhomogeneous six-vertex model, from a formulation introduced in a 2022 work due to Keating, Reshetikhin, and Sridhar, hence confirming a conjecture of the authors as to whether the Hamiltonian flow is integrable. To demonstrate that such an integrability property of the Hamiltonian holds from the action-angle variables, we make use of previous methods for studying Hamiltonian systems, implemented by Faddeev and Takhtajan, in which it was shown that integrability of a Hamiltonian system holds for the nonlinear Schrodinger's equation by computing action-angle variables from the Poisson bracket, which is connected to the analysis of entries of the monodromy and transfer matrices. For the inhomogeneous six-vertex model, an approach for computing the action-angle variables is possible through formulating several relations between entries of the quantum monodromy, and transfer, matrices, which can be not only be further examined from the structure of $L$ operators, but also from computing several Poisson brackets parameterized from entries of the monodromy matrix.

Title: Local Exchange-Correlation Potentials by Density Inversion in Solids
Authors: Visagan Ravindran, Nikitas I. Gidopoulos, Stewart J. Clark
Abstract: Following Hollins et al. [J. Phys.: Condens. Matter 29, 04LT01 (2017)], we invert the electronic ground state densities for various semiconducting and insulating solids calculated using several density functional approximations within the generalised Kohn-Sham (GKS) scheme, Hartree-Fock (HF) theory and the LDA+$U$ method, and benchmark against standard (semi-)local functionals. The band structures from the resulting local exchange-correlation (LXC) Kohn-Sham potential for these densities are then compared with the band structures of the original GKS method. We find the LXC potential obtained from the HF density systematically predicts band gaps in good agreement with experiment, even in strongly correlated transition metal monoxides (TMOs). Furthermore, we find that the HSE06 and PBE0 hybrid functionals yield similar densities and LXC potentials, and in weakly correlated systems, these potentials are similar to PBE. For LDA+$U$ densities, the LXC potential effectively reverses the flattening of bands caused by over-localisation by a large Hubbard-$U$ value, while for meta-GGAs, we find only small differences between the GKS and LXC results demonstrating that the non-locality of meta-GGAs is weak.

Title: Turbulence and large-scale structures in self-gravitating superfluids
Authors: Sanjay Shukla
Abstract: We study turbulence in self-gravitating superfluids by performing direct numerical simulations of the 3D Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson (GPP) equation, which is also a model for dark matter haloes around galaxies. In the absence of self-gravity, the spectrally truncated Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation shows the emergence of Kolmogorov's $5/3$ scaling in the incompressible kinetic energy spectrum. Introducing self-gravity, we observe the formation of different structures, from sheet-like to spherically collapsed structures, which introduce a minimum in the kinetic energy spectrum that corresponds to the sizes of these structures. The system shows early convergence towards statistically stationary states, which we show by the onset of thermalisation in the compressible kinetic energy spectrum, where $E_{\rm kin}^c \propto k^2$. We also show that the formation of such large-scale structures suggests that the particles (bosons) move from small to large scales through an inverse cascade, supporting a mechanism for the formation of large-scale structures, such as dark matter haloes, around our galaxy Milky Way.

Title: Are Foundational Atomistic Models Reliable for Finite-Temperature Molecular Dynamics?
Authors: Denan Li, Jiyuan Yang, Xiangkai Chen, Lintao Yu, Shi Liu
Abstract: Machine learning force fields have emerged as promising tools for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, potentially offering quantum-mechanical accuracy with the efficiency of classical MD. Inspired by foundational large language models, recent years have seen considerable progress in developing foundational atomistic models, sometimes referred to as universal force fields, designed to cover most elements in the periodic table. This Perspective adopts a practitioner's viewpoint to ask a critical question: Are these foundational atomistic models reliable for one of their most compelling applications, in particular simulating finite-temperature dynamics? Instead of a broad benchmark, we use the canonical ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transition in PbTiO$_3$ as a focused case study to evaluate prominent foundational atomistic models. Our findings suggest a potential disconnect between static accuracy and dynamic reliability. While 0 K properties are often well-reproduced, we observed that the models can struggle to consistently capture the correct phase transition, sometimes exhibiting simulation instabilities. We believe these challenges may stem from inherent biases in training data and a limited description of anharmonicity. These observed shortcomings, though demonstrated on a single system, appear to point to broader, systemic challenges that can be addressed with targeted fine-tuning. This Perspective serves not to rank models, but to initiate a crucial discussion on the practical readiness of foundational atomistic models and to explore future directions for their improvement.

Title: Skin Effect Induced Anomalous Dynamics from Charge-Fluctuating Initial States
Authors: Sibo Guo, Shuai Yin, Shi-Xin Zhang, Zi-Xiang Li
Abstract: Non-equilibrium dynamics in non-Hermitian systems has attracted significant interest, particularly due to the skin effect and its associated anomalous phenomena. Previous studies have primarily focused on initial states with a definite particle number. Here, we present a systematic study of non-reciprocal quench dynamics in the pairing states with indefinite particle number. Our study uncovers a range of novel behaviors. Firstly, we demonstrate a universal tendency towards half-filling of particle density at late times. At early times for certain initial states, we observe a chiral wavefront in both particle number distribution and charge inflow, associated with a sharp decrease in particle number. Furthermore, we find that non-Hermiticity could enhance the growth of entanglement in the initial stages of evolution. In the intermediate time regime, the characteristic skin effect leads to particle accumulation on one side, leading to a pronounced reduction in entanglement entropy. Moreover, our results reveal the presence of the quantum Mpemba effect during the restoration of U(1) symmetry. Our findings open new avenues for exploring exotic dynamic phenomena in quantum many-body systems arising from the interplay of symmetry breaking and non-Hermiticity.

Title: Dual-Polarization SHG Interferometry for Imaging Antiparallel Domains and Stacking Angles of 2D Heterocrystals
Authors: Juseung Oh, Wontaek Kim, Gyouil Jeong, Yeri Lee, Jihun Kim, Hyeongjoon Kim, Hyeon Suk Shin, Sunmin Ryu
Abstract: Optical second-harmonic generation (SHG) enables orientational polarimetry for crystallographic analysis and domain imaging of various materials. However, conventional intensity polarimetry, which neglects phase information, fails to resolve antiparallel domains and to describe two-dimensional heterostructures, which represent a new class of van der Waals-bound composite crystals. In this work, we report dual-polarization spectral phase interferometry (DP-SPI) and establish a generalized SHG superposition model that incorporates the observables of DP-SPI. Antiparallel domains of monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) were successfully imaged with distinction, validating the interferometric polarimetry. From DP interferograms of TMD heterobilayers, the orientation of each layer could be determined, enabling layer-resolved probing. By employing the superposition model, we also demonstrate the photonic design and fabrication of ternary TMD heterostructures for circularly polarized SHG. These methods, providing comprehensive SHG measurements and theoretical description, can be extended to heterostructures consisting of more than two constituent layers and are not limited to TMDs or 2D materials.

Title: Expansion-contraction duality breaking in a Planck-scale sensitive cosmological quantum simulator
Authors: S. Mahesh Chandran, Uwe R. Fischer
Abstract: We propose the experimental simulation of cosmological perturbations governed by a Planck-scale induced Lorentz violating dispersion, aimed at distinguishing between early-universe models with similar power spectra. Employing a novel variant of the scaling approach for the evolution of a Bose-Einstein condensate with both contact and dipolar interactions, we capture the hitherto unobserved phenomenon of trans-Planckian damping. We show that scale invariance, and in turn, the duality of the power spectrum is subsequently broken at large momenta for an inflating gas, and at small momenta for a contracting gas. We thereby furnish a Planck-scale sensitive approach to analogue quantum cosmology that can readily be implemented in the quantum gas laboratory.

Title: Coherence and Transients in Nonlocally Coupled Dissipative Kicked Rotors
Authors: Jin Yan
Abstract: The dynamics of nonlocally coupled dissipative kicked rotors is rich and complex. In this study, we consider a network of rotors where each interacts equally with a certain range of its neighbors. We focus on the influence of the coupling strength and the coupling range, and show both analytically and numerically the critical transitions in the phase diagram, which include bifurcations of simple spatiotemporal patterns and changes in basin sizes of coherent states with different wavenumbers. We highlight that this diagram is fundamentally different from those found in other coupled systems such as in coupled logistic maps or Lorenz systems. Finally, we show an interesting domain-wall phenomenon in the coupled chaotic rotors, where a super-long transient interface state (partially regular and partially chaotic) is observed and can persist exponentially long as the coupling range increases up to a critical threshold.

Title: Controlling quantum chaos via Parrondo strategies on noisy intermediate-scale quantum hardware
Authors: Aditi Rath, Dinesh Kumar Panda, Colin Benjamin
Abstract: Advancements in Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computing are steadily pushing these systems toward outperforming classical supercomputers on specific, well-defined computational tasks. In this work, we explore and control quantum chaos in NISQ systems using discrete-time quantum walks (DTQW) on cyclic graphs. To efficiently implement quantum walks on NISQ hardware, we employ the quantum Fourier transform (QFT) to diagonalize the conditional shift operator, optimizing circuit depth and fidelity. We experimentally realize the transition from quantum chaos to order via DTQW dynamics on both odd and even cyclic graphs, specifically 3- and 4-cycle graphs, using the counterintuitive Parrondo's paradox strategy across three different NISQ devices. While the 4-cycle graphs exhibit high-fidelity quantum evolution, the 3-cycle implementation shows significant fidelity improvement when augmented with dynamical decoupling pulses. Our results demonstrate a practical approach to probing and harnessing controlled chaotic dynamics on real quantum hardware, laying the groundwork for future quantum algorithms and cryptographic protocols based on quantum walks.

Abstract: The accurate theoretical description of materials with strongly correlated electrons is a formidable challenge in condensed matter physics and computational chemistry. Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT) is a successful approach that predicts behaviors of such systems by incorporating some of the correlated behavior using an impurity model, but it is limited by the need to calculate the impurity Green's function. This work proposes a framework for DMFT calculations on quantum computers, focusing on near-term applications. It leverages the structure of the impurity problem, combining a low-rank Gaussian subspace representation of the ground state and a compressed, short-depth quantum circuit that joins state preparation with time evolution to compute Green's functions. We demonstrate the convergence of the DMFT algorithm using the Gaussian subspace in a noise-free setting, and show the hardware viability of circuit compression by extracting the impurity Green's function on IBM quantum processors for a single impurity coupled to three bath orbitals (8 qubits, 1 ancilla). We discuss potential paths toward realizing this quantum computing use case in materials science.

Title: Emergence: from physics to biology, sociology, and computer science
Authors: Ross H. McKenzie
Abstract: Many systems involve numerous interacting parts and the whole system can have properties that the individual parts do not. I take this novelty as the defining characteristic of an emergent property. Other characteristics associated with emergence discussed include universality, order, complexity, unpredictability, irreducibility, diversity, self-organisation, discontinuities, and singularities. Emergent phenomena are widespread across physics, biology, social sciences, and computing, and are central to major scientific and societal challenges. Understanding emergence involves considering the stratification of reality across different scales (energy, time, length, complexity), each with its distinct ontology and epistemology, leading to semi-autonomous scientific disciplines. A central challenge is bridging the gap between macroscopic emergent properties and microscopic component interactions. Identifying an intermediate mesoscopic scale where new, weakly interacting entities or modular structures emerge is key. Theoretical approaches, such as effective theories (describing phenomena at a specific scale) and toy models (simplified systems for analysis), are vital. The Ising model exemplifies how toy models can elucidate emergence characteristics. Emergence is central to condensed matter physics, chaotic systems, fluid dynamics, nuclear physics, quantum gravity, neural networks, protein folding, and social segregation. An emergent perspective should influence scientific strategy by shaping research questions, methodologies, priorities, and resource allocation. An elusive goal is the design and control of emergent properties.

Title: Artificial discovery of lattice models for wave transport
Authors: Jonas Landgraf, Clara C. Wanjura, Vittorio Peano, Florian Marquardt
Abstract: Wave transport devices, such as amplifiers, frequency converters, and nonreciprocal devices, are essential for modern communication, signal processing, and sensing applications. Of particular interest are traveling wave setups, which offer excellent gain and bandwidth properties. So far, the conceptual design of those devices has relied on human ingenuity. This makes it difficult and time-consuming to explore the full design space under a variety of constraints and target functionalities. In our work, we present a method which automates this challenge. By optimizing the discrete and continuous parameters of periodic coupled-mode lattices, our approach identifies the simplest lattices that achieve the target transport functionality, and we apply it to discover new schemes for directional amplifiers, isolators, and frequency demultiplexers. Leveraging automated symbolic regression tools, we find closed analytical expressions that facilitate the discovery of generalizable construction rules. Moreover, we utilize important conceptual connections between the device transport properties and non-Hermitian topology. The resulting structures can be implemented on a variety of platforms, including microwave, optical, and optomechanical systems. Our approach opens the door to extensions like the artificial discovery of lattice models with desired properties in higher dimensions or with nonlinear interactions.

Title: Excitonic Coupling and Photon Antibunching in Venus Yellow Fluorescent Protein Dimers: A Lindblad Master Equation Approach
Authors: Ian T. Abrahams
Abstract: Strong excitonic coupling and photon antibunching (AB) have been observed together in Venus yellow fluorescent protein dimers and currently lack a cohesive theoretical explanation. In 2019, Kim et al. demonstrated Davydov splitting in circular dichroism spectra, revealing strong J-like coupling, while antibunched fluorescence emission was confirmed by combined antibunching--fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (AB/FCS fingerprinting). To investigate the implications of this coexistence, Venus yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) dimer population dynamics are modeled within a Lindblad master equation framework, testing its ability to cope with typical, data-informed, Venus YFP dimer time and energy values. Simulations predict multiple-femtosecond (fs) decoherence, yielding bright/dark state mixtures consistent with antibunched fluorescence emission at room temperature. Thus, excitonic coupling and photon AB in Venus YFP dimers are reconciled without invoking long-lived quantum coherence. However, clear violations of several Lindblad approximation validity conditions appear imminent, calling for careful modifications to choices of standard system and bath definitions and parameter values.

Title: When Less is More: Approximating the Quantum Geometric Tensor with Block Structures
Authors: Ahmedeo Shokry, Alessandro Santini, Filippo Vicentini
Abstract: The natural gradient is central in neural quantum states optimizations but it is limited by the cost of computing and inverting the quantum geometric tensor, the quantum analogue of the Fisher information matrix. We introduce a block-diagonal quantum geometric tensor that partitions the metric by network layers, analogous to block-structured Fisher methods such as K-FAC. This layer-wise approximation preserves essential curvature while removing noisy cross-layer correlations, improving conditioning and scalability. Experiments on Heisenberg and frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$ models show faster convergence, lower energy, and improved stability.

Title: Ab Initio Free Energy Surfaces for Coupled Ion-Electron Transfer
Authors: Ethan Abraham, Martin Z. Bazant, Troy Van Voorhis
Abstract: The Marcus theory of electron transfer assumes that diabatic energy gaps are sampled from a single ensemble. This assumption can break down in spatially anisotropic environments, such as Faradaic reactions at electrochemical interfaces, where distinct solvent ensembles arise along a collective variable describing the anisotropy. Treating this collective variable as an additional reaction coordinate linearly independent from the Marcus reaction coordinate, we develop a formalism that enables calculation of the resulting Coupled Ion-Electron Transfer (CIET) free-energy surface directly from constrained ab initio trajectories. Applied to CO2 redox on a gold electrode, this method reveals strong coupling to the anisotropy, predicting significantly different activation barriers compared to either coordinate alone.

Title: Mind the gaps: The fraught road to quantum advantage
Authors: Jens Eisert, John Preskill
Abstract: Quantum computing is advancing rapidly, yet substantial gaps separate today's noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices from tomorrow's fault-tolerant application-scale quantum (FASQ) machines. We identify four related hurdles along the road ahead: (i) from error mitigation to active error detection and correction, (ii) from rudimentary error correction to scalable fault tolerance, (iii) from early heuristics to mature, verifiable algorithms, and (iv) from exploratory simulators to credible advantage in quantum simulation. Targeting these transitions will accelerate progress toward broadly useful quantum computing.

Title: An introduction to Markovian open quantum systems
Authors: Shovan Dutta
Abstract: This is a concise, pedagogical introduction to the dynamic field of open quantum systems governed by Markovian master equations. We focus on the mathematical and physical origins of the widely used Lindblad equation, its unraveling in terms of stochastic pure-state trajectories and the corresponding continuous measurement protocols, the structure of steady states with emphasis on the role of symmetry and conservation laws, and a sampling of the novel physical phenomena that arise from nonunitary dynamics (dissipation and measurements). This is far from a comprehensive summary of the field. Rather, the objective is to provide a conceptual foundation and physically illuminating examples that are useful to graduate students and researchers entering this subject. There are exercise problems and references for further reading throughout the notes.
