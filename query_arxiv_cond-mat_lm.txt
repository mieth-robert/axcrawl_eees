Title: Computational study of alpha-ray induced electron excitation in diamonds for radiation detection
Authors: Atsuhiro Umemoto, Yoshiyuki Miyamoto
Abstract: To investigate the mechanism of radiation detection in diamonds, we developed a real time time dependent density functional theory based calculation scheme to evaluate changes in the density of states induced by alpha ray irradiation. A bulk diamond structural model was constructed, with impurities optionally introduced to assess their effect on electronic excitation. Simulations revealed that the passage of high speed helium ions, representing alpha particles, produced significant electronic excitation in the diamond model. Subsequent calculations of the excited state dynamics after ion removal indicated that excitation can persist for several hundred femtoseconds without triggering nonradiative relaxation. These findings demonstrate that the proposed approach offers a robust theoretical framework for evaluating the performance of diamond-based radiation detectors.

Title: Odd relaxation in three-dimensional Fermi liquids
Authors: Seth Musser, Sankar Das Sarma, Johannes Hofmann
Abstract: Recent theoretical works predict a hierarchy of long-lived, non-hydrodynamic modes in two-dimensional Fermi liquids arising from the feature -- supposedly unique to two dimensions -- that relaxation by head-on scattering is not efficient in the presence of Pauli blocking. This leads to a parity-based separation of scattering rates, with odd-parity modes relaxing much more slowly than even-parity ones. In this work, we establish that a similar effect exists in isotropic three-dimensional Fermi liquids, even though relaxation does not proceed solely by head-on scattering. We show that while the relaxation rates of even and odd modes in 3D share the same leading-order $\sim T^2$ low-temperature scaling typical of Fermi liquids, their magnitudes differ, with odd-parity modes relaxing more slowly than even ones for a broad class of interactions. We find a relative difference between odd-and even-parity relaxation rates as large as $40\%$ just by Pauli blocking alone, with a strong additional dependence on the scattering potential, such that the odd-even staggering is further enhanced by interactions that favor large-angle scattering. We identify signatures of these odd-parity relaxation rates in the static transverse conductivity as well as the transverse collective mode structure. Our results establish the unexpected existence of a tomographic-like regime in higher-dimensional Fermi liquids and suggest experimental probes via transport measurements.

Title: Light-induced odd-parity altermagnets on dimerized lattices
Authors: Dongling Liu, Zheng-Yang Zhuang, Di Zhu, Zhigang Wu, Zhongbo Yan
Abstract: Altermagnets are an emerging class of collinear magnets with momentum-dependent spin splitting and zero net magnetization. These materials can be broadly classified into two categories based on the behavior of spin splitting at time-reversal-related momenta: even-parity and odd-parity altermagnets. While even-parity altermagnets have been thoroughly investigated both theoretically and experimentally, the systems capable of hosting odd-parity altermagnetism remain largely unexplored. In this work, we demonstrate that circularly polarized light dynamically converts collinear PT-symmetric antiferromagnets on dimerized lattices into odd parity p-wave altermagnets. Because of the underlying Dirac band structure of the dimerized lattice, we find that the resulting p-wave altermagnets can realize Chern insulators (2D) and Weyl semimetals (3D) under appropriate drive conditions. Our findings demonstrate that collinear antiferromagnets on dimerized lattices provide ideal platforms to investigate the dynamical generation of odd-parity altermagnetism.

Title: Odd-Parity Altermagnetism Originated from Orbital Orders
Authors: Zheng-Yang Zhuang, Di Zhu, Dongling Liu, Zhigang Wu, Zhongbo Yan
Abstract: Odd-parity spin-splitting plays a central role in spintronics and unconventional superconductivity, yet its microscopic realization in collinear magnetic systems remains elusive. We propose a general symmetry-based strategy for realizing odd-parity altermagnetism by stacking two noncentrosymmetric monolayers in an interlayer antiferromagnetic configuration and applying an in-plane layer-flip operation. In this setting, odd-parity spin-splitting originates from nonrelativistic orbital orders rather than spin-orbit coupling, and is protected by an effective time-reversal symmetry despite the explicit time-reversal symmetry being broken. By exploiting lattice symmetries, our framework enables the realization of both $p$- and $f$-wave altermagnets. The resulting models generically host quantum spin Hall insulator phases, featuring topologically protected helical edge states and quantized spin Hall conductance. Our work expands the landscape of altermagnetic phases and opens a pathway toward spintronics and unconventional superconductivity in altermagnetic systems.

Title: 3D microwave imaging of a van der Waals heterostructure
Authors: Leonard W. Cao, Chen Wu, Lingyuan Lyu, Liam Cohen, Noah Samuelson, Ziying Yan, Sneh Pancholi, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Daniel E. Parker, Andrea F. Young, Monica T. Allen
Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures offer a tunable platform for the realization of emergent phenomena in layered electron systems. While scanning probe microscopy techniques have proven useful for the characterization of surface states and 2D crystals, the subsurface imaging of quantum phenomena in multi-layer systems presents a significant challenge. In 3D heterostructures, states that occupy different planes can simultaneously contribute to the signal detected by the microscope probe, which complicates image analysis and interpretation. Here we present a quantum imaging technique that offers a glimpse into the third dimension by resolving states out of plane: it extracts the charge density landscape of individual atomic planes inside a vdW heterostructure, layer by layer. As a proof-of-concept, we perform layer-resolved imaging of quantum Hall states and charge disorder in double-layer graphene using milliKelvin microwave impedance microscopy. Here the discrete energy spectrum of the top layer enables transmission of microwaves through gapped states, thus opening direct access to quantum phases in the subsurface layer. Resolving how charge is distributed out-of-plane offers a direct probe of interlayer screening, revealing signatures of negative quantum capacitance driven by many-body correlations. At the same time, we extract key features of the band structure and thermodynamics, including gap sizes. Notably, by imaging the charge distribution on different atomic planes beneath the surface, we shed light on the roles of surface impurities and screening on the stability of fractional quantum Hall states. We also show that the uppermost graphene layer can serve as a top gate: This unlocks access to a wide range of phenomena that require displacement field control, from fractional Chern insulators in Moir√© superlattices to correlated states in multilayer graphene.

Title: Destructive Interference induced constraints in Floquet systems
Authors: Somsubhra Ghosh, Indranil Paul, K. Sengupta, Lev Vidmar
Abstract: We introduce the paradigm of destructive many-body interference between quantum trajectories as a means to systematically generate prethermal kinetically constrained dynamics in Floquet systems driven at special frequencies. Depending on the processes that are suppressed by interference, the constraint may or may not be associated with an emergent global conservation; the latter kind having no mechanism of generation in time-independent settings. As an example, we construct an one-dimensional interacting spin model exhibiting strong Hilbert space fragmentation with and without dipole moment conservation, depending on the drive frequency. By probing the spatiotemporal profile of the out-of-time-ordered correlator, we show that this model, in particular, has initial states in which quantum information can be spatially localized - a useful feature in the field of quantum technologies. Our paradigm unifies various types of Hilbert space fragmentation that can be realized in driven systems.

Title: High-throughput superconducting $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ predictions through density of states rescaling
Authors: Kieran Bozier, Kang Wang, Bartomeu Monserrat, Chris J. Pickard
Abstract: First principles computational methods can predict the superconducting critical temperature $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ of conventional superconductors through the electron-phonon spectral function. Full convergence of this quantity requires Brillouin zone integration on very dense grids, presenting a bottleneck to high-throughput screening for high $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ systems. In this work, we show that an electron-phonon spectral function calculated at low cost on a coarse grid yields accurate $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ predictions, provided the function is rescaled to correct for the inaccurate value of the density of states at the Fermi energy on coarser grids. Compared to standard approaches, the method converges rapidly and improves the accuracy of predictions for systems with sharp features in the density of states. This approach can be directly integrated into existing materials screening workflows, enabling the rapid identification of promising candidates that might otherwise be overlooked.

Title: Multiple Dirac Spin-Orbital Liquids in SU(4) Heisenberg Antiferromagnets on the Honeycomb Lattice
Authors: Manoj Gupta, Arijit Haldar, Subhro Bhattacharjee, Tanusri Saha-Dasgupta
Abstract: We study the strong coupling model of $d^1$ transition metal tri-halides in the large spin-orbit coupled limit. By considering ab-initio-calculation-inspired hierarchy of hopping pathways of these compounds, SU(4) symmetry is found to emerge at multiple points in the parameter space of the hopping parameters. The resultant Dirac spin-orbital liquids, within the parton mean field description, are distinct. The calculated dynamical structure factor fingerprints this distinctive nature, giving rise to observable effects. This opens up a playground for SU(4) Dirac Spin-Orbital liquid in $d^1$ Honeycomb lattice systems.

Title: Higher-Dimensional Chirally Stabilized Fixed Points and Their Deformations
Authors: Aleksandar Ljepoja, L. C. R. Wijewardhana, Yashar Komijani
Abstract: Non-Fermi liquids in $d>2$ remain poorly understood, particularly when relevant perturbations destabilize them. In one spatial dimension, chirally stabilized fixed points provide a rare class of analytically tractable non-Fermi-liquid critical points, but their higher-dimensional analogues have been elusive. Here, we develop a Wilsonian operator-product-expansion renormalization group scheme that captures power-divergent terms and use it to construct finite-$N$ higher-dimensional analogues of chirally stabilized fixed points in arbitrary dimension $d\le4$. This exposes a conformal window at finite $N$. We further show that symmetry-breaking masses, far from being trivial, can collapse this window and drive the system to strong coupling, triggering dynamical mass generation.

Title: Interplay of Intersite Charge Transfer, Antiferromagnetism, and Strain in Barocaloric ACu$_3$Fe$_4$O$_{12}$ Quadruple Perovskites
Authors: J. Delgado-Quesada, G. G. Guzm√°n-Verri
Abstract: We develop a minimal Landau theory for the concomitant intersite charge-transfer, antiferromagnetic, and isostructural phase transitions in ACu$_3$Fe$_4$O$_{12}$ perovskites (A = La, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb). The model incorporates the difference in average ligand-hole occupancy between Cu and Fe, the staggered magnetization of the Fe sublattice, volume strain, and intrinsic thermal expansion, together with their couplings. It qualitatively reproduces key thermodynamic properties of the ACu$_3$Fe$_4$O$_{12}$ family, including the staggered magnetization, lattice volume, magnetic susceptibility, and the nearly linear temperature-pressure phase boundary. The framework predicts a pronounced elastic softening near the phase boundary, consistent with experiments where the bulk modulus of the low-pressure, charge-transferred antiferromagnetic phase exceeds that of the high-pressure, non-transferred paramagnetic phase. It also yields pressure-driven isothermal entropy changes, revealing that the intrinsic thermal expansion of the high- and low-temperature phases significantly shapes the overall barocaloric response. These results contrast with previous analyses of NdCu$_3$Fe$_4$O$_{12}$, where thermal expansion was neglected in the entropy construction, and call for a reevaluation of barocaloric effects in quadruple perovskites.

Title: Parity Breaking at Faceted Crystal Growth Fronts during Ice Templating
Authors: Kaihua Ji, Alain Karma
Abstract: Directional solidification of water-based solutions has emerged as a versatile technique to template hierarchical porous materials, but this nonequilibrium process remains incompletely understood. Here we use phase-field simulations to shed light on the mechanism that selects the growth direction of the lamellar ice structure that templates those materials. Our results show that this selection can be understood within the general framework of spontaneous parity breaking, yielding quantitative predictions for the tilt angle of lamellae with respect to the thermal axis. The results provide a theoretical basis to interpret a wide range of experimental observations.

Title: Phase-Field Model of Freeze Casting
Authors: Kaihua Ji, Alain Karma
Abstract: Directional solidification of water-based solutions has emerged as a versatile technique for templating hierarchical porous materials. However, the underlying mechanisms of pattern formation remain incompletely understood. In this work, we present a detailed derivation and analysis of a quantitative phase-field model for simulating this nonequilibrium process. The phase-field model extends the thin-interface formulation of dilute binary alloy solidification with anti-trapping to incorporate the highly anisotropic energetic and kinetic properties of the partially faceted ice-water interface. This interface is faceted in the basal plane normal to the <0001> directions and atomically rough in other directions within the basal plane. On the basal plane, the model reproduces a linear or nonlinear kinetic relationship that can be linked to experimental measurements. In both cases, spontaneous parity breaking of the solidification front is observed, leading to the formation of partially faceted ice lamellae that drift laterally in one of the <0001> directions. We demonstrate that the drifting velocity is controlled by the kinetics on the basal plane and converges as the thickness of the diffuse solid-liquid interface decreases. Furthermore, we examine the effect of the form of the kinetic anisotropy, which is chosen here such that the inverse of the kinetic coefficient varies linearly from a finite value in the <0001> directions to zero in all other directions within the basal plane. Our results indicate that the drifting velocity of ice lamellae is not affected by the slope of this linear relation, and the radius and undercooling at the tip of an ice lamella converge at relatively small slope values. Consequently, the phase-field simulations remain quantitative with computationally tractable choices of both the interface thickness and the slope assumed in the form of the kinetic anisotropy.

Title: Why Compressed Metal Hydrides are Near-room-temperature Superconductors
Authors: Warren E. Pickett
Abstract: This contribution provides a partial response to the titular statement since, it will be claimed,the ``why'' is not yet understood, but there is a pathway for achieving a more complete understanding. The sense of the community has been that, given a prospective metal hydride and pressure, the energy landscape can be surveyed computationally for thermodynamic and dynamic stability, the Eliashberg spectral function with its required input (energy bands, phonon modes, coupling matrix elements) can be calculated, and the critical temperature T$_c$ obtained. Satisfyingly large values of the electron-phonon coupling strength $\lambda$=2-3 at high mean frequency are obtained, giving very reasonable agreement with existing high T$_c$ hydrides. Typically 80-85\% of $\lambda$ is attributable to high frequency H vibrations. This much was envisioned by Ashcroft two decades ago, so why should there be any angst? This paper addresses more specifically the question {\it why hydrogen?} Light mass is indeed a factor, but with possibilities not yet explored. This paper provides a concise overview of related formal developments occurring sporadically over several decades that, when implemented, could resolve the question of {\it why hydrogen, why so high T$_c$.} The dearth of success of numerous high throughput searches proposing higher T$_c$ materials, especially hydrides, is touched on briefly. Based on as yet unapplied developments in simplifying effects of atomic displacement, it is proposed that there is a straightforward path toward a deeper understanding of ``metallic hydrogen superconductivity" in conjunction with added computational efficiency, and that some human-learning should assist in focusing the search for higher T$_c$ superconductors.

Title: Rigidity and mechanical response in biological structures
Authors: Kelly Aspinwall, Tyler Hain, M. Lisa Manning
Abstract: Rigidity is an emergent property of materials - it is not a feature of individual components that comprise the structure, but instead arises from interactions between many constituent parts. Recently, it has been recognized that floppy-rigid or fluid-solid transitions are harnessed by biological systems at all scales to drive form and function. This review focuses on the different mechanisms that can drive emergent rigidity transitions in biomechanical networks, and describes how they arise in mathematical formalisms and how they are observed in practice in experiments. The goal is to aid researchers in identifying mechanisms governing rigidity in their biological systems of interest, highlight mechanical features that are universal across different systems, and help drive new scientific hypotheses for observed mechanical phenomena in biology. Looking forward, we also discuss how biological systems might tune themselves towards or away from such transitions over developmental or evolutionary timescales.

Title: Exploration of Hexagonal, Layered Carbides and Nitrides as Ultra-High Temperature Ceramics
Authors: Kat Nykiel, Brian Wyatt, Babak Anasori, Alejandro Strachan
Abstract: Layered, hexagonal crystal structures, like zeta and eta phases, play an important role in ultra-high temperature ceramics, often significantly increasing toughness of carbide composites. Despite their importance open questions remain about their structure, stability, and compositional pervasiveness. We use high-throughput density functional theory to characterize the thermodynamic stability and elastic constants of layered carbides and nitrides M$_{n+1}$X$_{n}$ with $n$ = 1, 2, and 3, $M$ = Ta, Ti, Hf, Zr, Nb, Mo, V, W, Sc, Cr, Mn and $X$ = C, N. The stacking sequences explored are inspired by the possible use of MXenes as precursors to enable relatively low temperature processing of high-temperature ceramics. We identified 67 new hexagonal, layered materials with thermal stability comparable or better than previously observed zeta phases. To assess their potential for high temperature applications, we used machine learning and physics-based models with DFT inputs to predict their melting temperatures and discovered several candidates on par with the current state of the art zeta-like phases and five with predicted melting temperatures above 2500 K. The findings expand the range of chemistries and structures for high-temperature applications.

Title: Scalable Effective Models for Superconducting Nanostructures: Applications to Double, Triple, and Quadruple Quantum Dots
Authors: Daniel Bobok, Luk√°≈° Frk, Vladislav Pokorn√Ω, Martin ≈Ωonda
Abstract: We introduce a versatile and scalable framework for constructing effective models of superconducting (SC) nanostructures described by the generalized SC Anderson impurity model with multiple quantum dots and leads. Our Chain Expansion (ChE) method maps each SC lead onto a finite tight-binding chain with parameters obtained from Pad√© approximants of the tunneling self-energy. We provide an explicit algorithm for the general case as well as simple analytical expressions for the chain parameters in the wide-band and infinite-chain limits. This mapping preserves low-energy physics while enabling efficient simulations: short chains are tractable with exact diagonalization, and longer ones with density matrix renormalization group methods. The approach remains reliable and computationally efficient across diverse geometries, both in and out of equilibrium. We use ChE to map the ground-state phase diagrams of double, triple, and quadruple quantum dots coupled to a single SC lead. While half-filled symmetric systems show similar overall diagrams, the particular phases differ substantially with dot number. Here, large parameter regions are entirely missed by the widely used zero-bandwidth approximation but are captured by ChE. Away from half-filling, additional dots markedly increase diagram complexity, producing a rich variety of stable phases. These results demonstrate ChE as a fast, accurate, and systematically improvable tool for exploring complex SC nanostructures.

Title: Parameter degeneracy in the vertex model for tissues
Authors: Paulo C. Godolphim, Leonardo G. Brunnet, Rodrigo Soto
Abstract: The vertex model with homogeneous cell properties is known to exhibit a parameter degeneracy in which the system's dynamics is independent of the target area. Here, we show, for the heterogeneous vertex model where cells differ in size and stiffness, that degeneracy is also present with the average product of target areas and stiffness becoming dynamically irrelevant. Fixing this quantity is equivalent to fixing the global internal tissue pressure. Unless properly treated, this degeneracy undermines the physical relevance of key observables' numerical values, such as the shape index, cell pressure, and cell stress tensor. We present methods to resolve the degeneracy and to correctly set the gauge pressure via symmetry transformations applied to the cells' target areas. We further demonstrate that the degeneracy is removed under certain boundary conditions and partially lifted when spherical tissues are modeled using a locally planar approximation, leading to numerical consequences when fitting model parameters to experimental data. The approach extends beyond vertex models and provides a framework for testing whether the parameter spaces of other physical models are free from degeneracy.

Title: Electron-Phonon interaction and lattice thermal conductivity from metals to 2D Dirac crystals: a review
Authors: Sina Kazemian, Giovanni Fanchini
Abstract: Electron--phonon (e--ph) coupling governs electrical resistivity, hot-carrier cooling, and critically, thermal transport in solids. Recent first-principles advances now predict e--ph limited thermal conductivity from d-band metals and wide-band-gap semiconductors to 2D Dirac crystals without empirical parameters. In bulk metals, ab-initio lifetimes show that phonons, though secondary, still carry up to 40\% of the heat once e--ph scattering is included. We next survey coupled Boltzmann frameworks, exemplified by \textsc{elphbolt}, that capture mutual drag and ultrafast non-equilibrium in semiconductors. For 2D Dirac crystals, mirror symmetry, carrier density, strain, and finite size rearrange the scattering hierarchy: ZA modes dominate pristine graphene yet become the main resistive branch in nanoribbons once symmetry is broken. At low Fermi energies and high temperatures, the standard 3-particle decay is partially cancelled, elevating 4-particle processes and necessitating dynamically screened, higher-order theory. Throughout, we identify the microscopic levers such as the electronic density of states, phonon frequency, deformation potential, and show how doping, strain, or dielectric environment can tune e--ph damping. We conclude by outlining open challenges such as: developing coupled e--ph solvers, solving the full mode-to-mode Peierls--Boltzmann equation with 4-particle terms, embedding correlated electron methods in e--ph workflows, and leveraging higher-order e--ph coupling and symmetry breaking to realise phononic thermal diodes and rectifiers. Solving these challenges will elevate e--ph theory from a diagnostic tool to a predictive, parameter-free platform that links symmetry, screening, and many-body effects to heat and charge transport in next-generation electronic, photonic, and thermoelectric devices.

Title: Twisted light drives chiral excitations of interacting electrons in nanostructures with magnetic field
Authors: F.J. Rodr√≠guez, L. Quiroga, N.F.Johnson
Abstract: Twisted light (TL), a special kind of light carrying orbital angular momentum, provides a powerful tool for driving symmetry resolved transitions in quantum confined nanostructures. We study a realistic model where a TL pulse excites two interacting electrons in a nanostructure under a perpendicular magnetic field. To include image charge effects in layered systems, we use an effective electron electron potential of the form 1/r^n. For n = 2, the system exhibits an underlying su(1,1) dynamical symmetry, enabling analytical solutions and a clear interpretation of selection rules, parity changes, and angular momentum resolved absorption. We show that the bare Coulomb 1/r interaction produces similar spectra, indicating that twisted light driven excitations are robust against the precise interaction form. The excitation spectrum reveals strong chiral properties: TL pulses, unlike conventional dipolar fields, directly access interaction-driven transitions otherwise symmetry-forbidden. In particular, TL breaks the generalized Kohn theorem, exposing internal excitations through multi quanta orbital processes. More broadly, our results establish TL as a sensitive probe of correlations, symmetry, and magneto-optical dynamics in strongly interacting quantum systems, uncovering features that remain invisible to standard infrared absorption.

Title: Long lifetimes of nanoscale skyrmions in lithium-decorated van der Waals ferromagnet Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$
Authors: Soumyajyoti Haldar, Moritz A. Goerzen, Stefan Heinze, Dongzhe Li
Abstract: The Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), which originates from spin-orbit coupling and relies on broken inversion symmetry, is recognized as a key ingredient in forming magnetic skyrmions. However, most 2D magnets exhibit inversion symmetry; therefore, the DMI is suppressed. Here, we propose a strategy to induce large DMI via lithium absorption on the surface of 2D magnets -- an experimentally feasible approach. Using first-principles and atomistic spin simulations, we predict the formation of nanoscale skyrmions in lithium-decorated monolayer Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ by imposing small out-of-plane magnetic fields ($B_z$). Notably, we find very large skyrmion energy barriers of more than 300 meV at $B_z = 0.4$ T, comparable to those observed in ferromagnet/heavy-metal interfaces. The origin of these unique skyrmions is attributed to the competition between strong DMI, exchange frustration, and small magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy. We further show that the lifetimes of metastable skyrmions exceed one hour for temperatures up to 75 K.

Title: Diverse, Distinct, and Densely Packed DNA Droplets
Authors: Aria S. Chaderjian, Sam Wilken, Omar A. Saleh
Abstract: The liquid-liquid phase separation of biomolecules is an important process for intracellular organization. Biomolecular sequence combinatorics leads to a large variety of proteins and nucleic acids which can interact to form a diversity of dense liquid (`condensate') phases. The relationship between sequence design and the diversity of the resultant phases is therefore of interest. Here, we explore this question using the DNA nanostar system which permits the creation of multi-phase condensate droplets through sequence engineering of the sticky end bonds that drive particle-particle attraction. We explore the theoretical limits of nanostar phase diversity, then experimentally demonstrate the ability to create 9 distinct, non-adhering nanostar phases that do not share components. We further study how thermal processing affects the morphology and dynamics of such a highly diverse condensate system. We particularly show that a rapid temperature quench leads to the formation of a densely packed 2-D layer of droplets that is transiently stabilized by caging effects enabled by the phase diversity, leading to glassy dynamics, such as slow coarsening and dynamic heterogeneity. Generally, our work provides experimental insight into the thermodynamics of phase separation of complex mixtures and demonstrates the rational engineering of complex, long-range, multi-phase droplet structures.

Title: Ice-assisted soft-landing deposition for van der Waals integration
Authors: Xinyu Sun, Xiang Xu, BinBin Jin, Yihan Lu, Jichuang Shen, Wei Kong, Ding Zhao, Min Qiu
Abstract: Van der Waals integration enables the creation of electronic and optoelectronic devices with unprecedented performance and novel functionalities beyond the existing material limitations. However, it is typically realized using a physical pick-up-and-place process to minimize interfacial damages and is hardly integrated into conventional lithography and metallization procedures. Here we demonstrate a simple in situ transfer strategy for van der Waals integration, in which a thin film of amorphous water ice acts as a buffer layer to shield against the bombardment of energetic clusters during metallization. After ice sublimation, the deposited metal film can be gently and in situ placed onto underlying substrates, to form an atomically clean and damage-free metal-semiconductor interface. This strategy allows ultra-clean and non-destructive fabrication of high-quality contacts on monolayer MoS2, which is extremely beneficial to produce a high-performance 2D field-effect transistor with an ultra-high on/off ratio of 1010, mobility of 80 (cm2 V-1s-1), and also with reduced Fermi level pinning effect. We also demonstrate the batch production of CVD-grown MoS2 transistor arrays with uniform electrical characteristics. Such a gentle and ultra-clean fabrication approach has been further extended to materials with high reactivity, such as halide perovskites. Our method can be easily integrated with mature semiconductor manufacturing technology and may become a generic strategy for fabricating van der Waals contacted devices.

Title: Light-programmable reorientation of the crystallographic c-axis of Tellurium thin films
Authors: Yuta Kobayashi, Arata Mitsuzuka, Haruo Kondo, Makoto Shoshin, Jun Uzuhashi, Tadakatsu Ohkubo, Masamitsu Hayashi, Masashi Kawaguchi
Abstract: Tellurium (Te), a two-dimensional material with pronounced structural anisotropy, exhibits exceptional electrical and optical properties that are highly sensitive to its crystallographic orientation. However, conventional synthesis techniques offer limited control over the in-plane alignment of Te's crystallographic c-axis, hindering large-scale integration. Here, we report a novel, non-contact method to dynamically manipulate the c-axis orientation of Te thin films using linearly polarized picosecond laser pulses. We show that the c-axis can be omnidirectionally reoriented perpendicular to the laser polarization, even in initially polycrystalline films. This reorientation is fully reversible, allowing for rewritable and spatially selective control of the c-axis orientation post-deposition. Our light-driven approach enables programmable anisotropy in Te, opening new avenues for reconfigurable optoelectronic and photonic devices, such as active metasurfaces and CMOS-compatible architectures.

Title: Spin-Orbit Coupling-Driven Chirality Switching of Spin Waves in Altermagnets
Authors: Wen-Tong Li, Yu-Biao Wu, Lin Zhuang, Jian-Tao Wang, Wu-Ming Liu
Abstract: Chirality of spin waves offers an advantageous binary carrier for data transmission and processing with ultrafast dynamics and low power consumption. Altermagnets possess intrinsic chirality-splitting spin waves and vanishing net magnetization, thus emerging as ideal platforms to host chirality bits. However, active control of the chiral states remains a key challenge for realizing logic operations in chirality-based circuits. Here, we propose a novel scheme for reversibly switching spin-wave chirality in altermagnets between right- and left-handedness by tuning spin-orbit coupling (SOC) strength. Specifically, for in-plane spin polarization, SOC hybridizes with the altermagnetism, which induces a momentum-dependent competition. The chirality-splitting structure of spin waves is dominated by either SOC or altermagnetism in different Brillouin zone regions, allowing chirality switching by altering their relative strength. An experimental design utilizing an antiferromagnetic substrate to induce SOC and a heavy-metal stripe for chirality detection is proposed. Our work establishes a novel pathway for controlling spin-wave chirality in altermagnets via SOC, laying the groundwork for developing spintronic devices utilizing switchable chiral spin waves as dynamic information carriers.

Title: Rigidity of generic random tensegrity structures
Authors: Vishal Sudhakar, William Stephenson, James P. McInerney, D. Zeb Rocklin
Abstract: Many mechanical structures, both engineered and biological, combine heavy rigid elements such as bones and beams with lightweight flexible ones such as cables and membranes. These are referred to as tensegrities, reflecting that cables can only support extensile tension. We model such systems via simulations of depleted triangular lattices in which we minimize the energies of tensegrities subject to strained boundary conditions. When there are equal numbers of cables and struts (which support only compressive tension), a cable and a strut together each contribute as much toward rigidity as a rod, with the two contributions being equal in the case of shear strain. Due to the highly nonaffine deformations at the rigidity transitions, the contribution of a cable (strut) can be significant even under global compression (dilation) despite a cable's inability to resist local compression. Further, we find that when neighboring elements tend to point away from one another, as is common in real systems, cables interact significantly more strongly with other cables than do cables with struts in supporting stress. These phenomena shed new light on a variety of realistic, disordered systems at the threshold of mechanical stability.

Title: Full counting statistics and first-passage times in quantum Markovian processes: Ensemble relations, metastability, and fluctuation theorems
Authors: Paul Menczel, Christian Flindt, Fredrik Brange, Franco Nori, Clemens Gneiting
Abstract: We develop a comprehensive framework for characterizing fluctuations in quantum transport and nonequilibrium thermodynamics using two complementary approaches: full counting statistics and first-passage times. Focusing on open quantum systems governed by Markovian Lindblad dynamics, we derive general ensemble relations that connect the two approaches at all times, and we clarify how the steady states reached at long times relate to those reached at large jump counts. In regimes of metastability, long-lived intermediate states cause violations of experimentally testable cumulant relations, as we discuss. We also formulate a fluctuation theorem governing the probability of rare fluctuations in the first-passage time distributions based on results from full counting statistics. Our results apply to general integer-valued trajectory observables that do not necessarily increase monotonically in time. Three illustrative applications, a two-state emitter, a driven qubit, and a variant of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, highlight the physical implications of our results and provide guidelines for practical calculations. Our framework provides a complete picture of first-passage time statistics in Markovian quantum systems, encompassing multiple earlier results, and it has direct implications for current experiments in quantum optics, superconducting circuits, and nanoscale heat engines.

Title: Optical Control of Integer and Fractional Chern Insulators
Authors: William Holtzmann, Weijie Li, Eric Anderson, Jiaqi Cai, Heonjoon Park, Chaowei Hu, Takashi Taniguchi, Kenji Watanabe, Jiun-Haw Chu, Di Xiao, Ting Cao, Xiaodong Xu
Abstract: Optical control of topology, particularly in the presence of electron correlations, is a fascinating topic with broad scientific and technological impact. Twisted MoTe$_2$ bilayer (tMoTe$_2$) is a newly discovered zero-field fractional Chern insulator (FCI), exhibiting the fractionally quantized anomalous Hall (FQAH) effect. Since the chirality of the edge states and sign of the Chern number are determined by the underlying ferromagnetic polarization, manipulation of ferromagnetism would realize control of the CI/FCI states. Here, we demonstrate control and switching of ferromagnetic polarization, and thus the CI and FCI states by circularly polarized optical pumping in tMoTe$_2$. At low optical excitation power, we achieve on-demand preparation of ferromagnetic polarization by optical training, i.e., electrically tuning the system from non-ferromagnetic to desirable ferromagnetic states accompanied with helicity-selective optical pumping. With increased excitation power, we further realize direct optical switching of ferromagnetic polarization at a temperature far below the Curie temperature. Both optical training and direct switching of ferromagnetism are most effective near CI/FCI states, which we attribute to a gap enhanced valley polarization of photo-injected holes. We show that the magnetization can be dynamically switched by modulating the helicity of optical excitation. Spatially resolved measurements further demonstrate optical writing of a ferromagnetic, and thus a CI (or FCI) domain. Our work realizes precise optical control of a topological quantum many-body system with potential applications in topological spintronics, quantum memories, and creation of exotic edge states by programmable patterning of integer and fractional QAH domains.

Title: Emergent topology of flat bands in a twisted bilayer $Œ±$-$T_3$ lattice
Authors: Gourab Paul, Srijata Lahiri, Kuntal Bhattacharyya, Saurabh Basu
Abstract: We investigate an interesting interplay of destructive interference due to lattice geometry and band folding due to enlargement of the Brillouin zone in generating and subsequently modifying the band topology in a twisted bilayer $\alpha$-$T_3$ system. The pronounced degeneracy of the emergent flat band in the dice limit of the $\alpha$-$T_3$ lattice is removed on alignment with h-BN layers, resulting in the formation of sub-bands with varying topological characteristics. Remarkably, while the sub-band near charge neutrality exhibits a trivial behavior, a topologically non-degenerate singular sub-band emerges away from charge neutrality. The topological band remains isolated from the rest of the bands for a substantial area of the $\alpha - \theta$ plane (where $\alpha$ and $\theta$ correspond to the hopping ratio and twist angle respectively) while exhibiting multiple phase transitions as a function of the aforementioned parameters via hybridization with its nearest bands. We study the evolution of the hybrid Wannier charge center and the Chern number to characterize the different emergent topological phases. Finally, the degree of flatness of the topological band is studied as a function of both $\alpha$ and $\theta$ to explicitly show the influence of quantum interference and band folding on the width of the topological band.

Title: Theoretical investigation of Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect in Potassium Tri-vanadium Pentantimonide
Authors: Partha Goswami
Abstract: The Kagome metal Potassium Tri-vanadium Pent-antimonide can support the quantum anomalous Hall effect theoretically. This is justified by flat bands and Dirac points susceptible to gap opening by spin-orbit coupling or magnetic ordering. The theoretical investigation of this quantum effect is possible exploring strategies like magnetic proximity, and strain or electric gating tuning. Our goal here is to explore the possibility of quantum anomalous Hall effect with a system Hamiltonian involving nearest-neighbour and complex next nearest-neighbour hopping, Rashba spin-orbit coupling, exchange field due to magnetic proximity, and charge density wave. Our preliminary analysis with these ingredients reveals that the system hosts multiple bands whose Chern numbers values suggest weak topological characteristics-not yet quantized, but showing signs of nontrivial Berry curvature accumulation. Upon introducing momentum-space winding, mimicking an orbital magnetic flux, through the momentum-dependence of the phase of the complex hopping, we find that two bands in the multiple band system carry opposite Chern numbers, indicating the emergence of chiral edge states and a quantized anomalous Hall effect. The rest remain trivial, but the system as a whole is no longer topologically inert.

Title: Origin of Glass-like Thermal Conductivity in Crystalline TlAgTe
Authors: Shantanu Semwal (1), Yi Xia (2), Chris Wolverton (3), Koushik Pal (1) ((1) Department of Physics, Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, Kanpur, India (2) Department of Mechanical and Materials Engineering, Portland State University, Portland, USA (3) Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Northwestern University, Evanston, United States)
Abstract: Ordered crystalline compounds exhibiting ultralow and glass-like thermal conductivity are both fundamentally and technologically important, where phonon quasi-particles dominate their heat transport. Understanding the microscopic mechanisms that govern such unusual transport behavior is necessary to unravel the complex interplay of crystal structure, phonons, and collective excitations of these quasi-particles. Here, we use state-of-the-art first-principles calculations based on quantum density functional theory to investigate the origin of experimentally measured unusually low and glassy thermal conductivity in semiconducting TlAgTe. Utilizing a unifying framework of anharmonic lattice dynamics theory that combine phonon self-energy induced frequency renormalization, particle-like Peierls ($kappa_l^P$) and wave-like coherent ($kappa_l^C$) thermal transport contributions including three and four-phonon scattering channels, we successfully explain the experimental results both in terms of magnitude and temperature dependence. Our analysis reveals that TlAgTe exhibits several localized phonon modes arising from concerted rattling-like vibration of Tl atoms, which show strong temperature dependence and enhanced four-phonon scattering rates that are dominated by Umklapp processes, suppressing $kappa_l^P$ to ultralow values. The ensuing strong anharmonicity induced by local structural distortions, lone-pair electrons, and rattling-like vibrations of the heavy cations lead to a transition from particle-like behavior to wave-like tunneling characteristics of the phonon modes above 40 cm$^-1$, contributing significantly to $kappa_l^C$ which increases with temperature. Our analysis uncovers important structure-property relationship, which may be used in designing of novel materials with tunable thermal conductivity.

Title: Flexible orbital torque device with ultralow switching current
Authors: Liguang Gong, Jian Song, Bin Lao, Run-Wei Li, Zhiming Wang
Abstract: Orbital torque (OT) offers a highly efficient way for electrical magnetization manipulation. However, its potential in the emerging field of flexible spintronics remains largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate a flexible and robust OT device based on a mica/SrRuO3(SRO)/CoPt heterostructure. We measure a large torque efficiency of -0.31, which originates from the significant orbital Hall effect in the SRO layer. Leveraging the low thermal conductivity of the mica substrate, a thermally-assisted switching mechanism is activated, enabling an ultralow threshold current density of 9.2x109 A/m2. This value represents a 90% reduction compared to conventional spin-torque devices and a 52% reduction against its rigid counterpart on a SrTiO3 substrate. The superior performances is well-maintained after 103 bending cycles, conforming its exceptional flexibility and durability. Our work pioneers the development of flexible OT devices, showcasing a viable path toward next-generation, low-power wearable spintronic applications.

Title: Room temperature giant magnetoresistance detection of spin hall nano-oscillator dynamics in synthetic antiferromagnetic Spin-Valve
Authors: Chunhao Li, Xiaotian Zhao, Wenlong Cai, Long Liu, Wei Liu, Zhidong Zhang
Abstract: Conventional spin Hall nano-oscillators (SHNOs) face fundamental power limitations due to the low anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR < 0.3%) of ferromagnetic layers. To address this, we developed a synthetic antiferromagnetic spin-valve (SAF-SV) heterostructure [Ta/NiFe/Ru/NiFe/Cu/NiFe/Hf/Pt] that enables efficient giant magnetoresistance (GMR)-based detection of SHNO dynamics at room temperature. The NiFe/Ru/NiFe SAF reference layer, operating in the spin-flop state, couples with the NiFe free layer through a Cu spacer to achieve a remarkable GMR ratio of 0.568% - exhibiting complete independence of magnetic field/current orientation. Spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance (ST-FMR) verifies that the ferromagnetic resonance linewidth of the free layer can be effectively modulated by dc current through the Pt heavy metal layer, while maintaining decoupled dynamics from the SAF layer. Thermal management via high-thermal-conductivity SiC substrates and AlN capping layers successfully mitigates current-shunting-induced Joule heating. Notably, stable auto-oscillation peaks are observed at 820 mA bias current, with oscillation frequency tunable by external magnetic field and potential dual-mode behavior at low fields. This work establishes a new paradigm for room-temperature, high-power spintronic oscillators, offering significant potential for neuromorphic computing and coherent RF communication applications.

Title: Isofrequency spin-wave imaging using color center magnetometry for magnon spintronics
Authors: Samuel Ma√±as-Valero, Yasmin C. Doedes, Artem Bondarenko, Michael Borst, Samer Kurdi, Thomas Poirier, James H. Edgar, Vincent Jacques, Yaroslav M. Blanter, Toeno van der Sar
Abstract: Magnon spintronics aims to harness spin waves in magnetic films for information technologies. Color center magnetometry is a promising tool for imaging spin waves, using electronic spins associated with atomic defects in solid-state materials as sensors. However, two main limitations persist: the magnetic fields required for spin-wave control detune the sensor-spin detection frequency, and this frequency is further restricted by the color center nature. Here, we overcome these limitations by decoupling the sensor spins from the spin-wave control fields -selecting color centers with intrinsic anisotropy axes orthogonal to the film magnetization- and by using color centers in diamond and hexagonal boron nitride to operate at complementary frequencies. We demonstrate isofrequency imaging of field-controlled spin waves in a magnetic half-plane and show how intrinsic magnetic anisotropies trigger bistable spin textures that govern spin-wave transport at device edges. Our results establish color center magnetometry as a versatile tool for advancing spin-wave technologies.

Title: Chemical control of polymorphism and ferroelectricity in PbTiO3 and SrTiO3 monolayers and bilayers
Authors: Shaowen Xu, Jeffrey R. Reimers, Fanhao Jia, Wei Ren
Abstract: Layers of perovskites, found in 3D materials, 2D heterostructures, and nanotubes, often distort from high symmetry to facilitate dipole polarisation that is exploitable in many applications. Using density-functional theory calculations, ferroelectricity in bilayers of the 2D materials PbTiO3 and SrTiO3 is shown to be controlled by bond breakage and formation processes that act as binary switches. These stacking-dependent processes turn on and off as a function of relaxation from high-symmetry structures and the application of biaxial strain, and their concerted rearrangements lead to low energy barriers for ferroelectric polarisation switching. Structures with symmetry intermediate between high-symmetry octahedral forms and low-symmetry ferroelectric forms are identified, allowing the intrinsic processes associated with traditional "ferrodistortive" and "antiferrodistortive" distortions of TiO6 octahedra to be identified. Ferrodistortive-mode activity is shown to be generated by the simultaneous application of two different types of curvilinear antiferrodistortive motions. In this way, four angular variabes control polarisation switching through the concerted making and breaking of chemical bonds. These subltities make the polarisation sensitive to chemical-environment and temperature effects that manipulate strain and structure, features exploitable in futuristic devices.

Title: Self-similarity in creeping salt crystallization
Authors: R.J. Wijnhorst, M. Prat, N. Shahidzadeh
Abstract: The self-amplifying creeping of salts can produce striking macroscopic structures, such as desert roses in arid regions and salt pillars near saline lakes. While these formations are visually remarkable, salt crystallization, often seen as efflorescence on surfaces, also poses significant challenges for cultural heritage conservation, materials science, and soil management. In this study, we investigate the mechanisms underlying self-organized crystallization within efflorescence deposits. Our findings reveal that these porous salt deposits exhibit pronounced self-similarity, with the crystallization process recurring at multiple length scales. This results in smaller replicas of the overall structure nested within larger ones, creating fractal geometries similar to those found in cauliflower and broccoli. By performing controlled evaporation experiments and microscale analysis using advanced imaging techniques combined with fractal dimension analysis, we uncover the hierarchical and size-controlled precipitation of cubic microcrystals within the porous efflorescence. Furthermore, we develop a hierarchical growth model demonstrating that the ultimate height of the macroscopic salt deposit is primarily determined by the initial mass of salt, rather than by the interplay of capillary and viscous forces when salt solution flows within the porous salt structure.

Title: Locally tuned hydrodynamics of active polymer chains
Authors: Lisa Sappl, Christos N. Likos, Andreas Z√∂ttl
Abstract: We employ mesoscopic simulations to study active polymers in a solvent via multi-particle collision dynamics. We investigate linear chains in which either the head or tail monomer exerts an active force, directed away from or towards its neighbor, respectively, while the remaining monomers are passive. We find that, in contrast to flexible chains, for stiff chains the position of the active monomer has minimal influence on both the structural and dynamic properties of the chain. An active head monomer pulls the chain behind it, straightening the backbone -- an effect that can be interpreted as activity-induced stiffening. In contrast, an active tail pushes into the chain, causing crumpling. This leads to faster decorrelation of the polymer backbone over time, rendering the active motion less persistent. These effects occur regardless of whether hydrodynamic interactions are included or not. Hydrodynamics is included by the imposition of a local counter-force in the surrounding fluid, as opposed to distributing the former equally to all fluid elements. By specifying the position of this counterforce onto the fluid, we can tune the hydrodynamic flow fields of the active polymers being both contractile and extensile. Interestingly, the emerging pusher- and puller flow fields are strongly influenced by the force propagation inside the polymer chain.

Title: Itinerant and topological excitations in a honeycomb spiral spin liquid candidate
Authors: Yuqian Zhao, Xuping Yao, Xun Chen, Zongtang Wan, Zhaohua Ma, Xiaochen Hong, Yuesheng Li
Abstract: The frustrated insulating magnet can stabilize a spiral spin liquid, arising from cooperative fluctuations among a subextensively degenerate manifold of spiral configurations, with ground-state wave vectors forming a continuous contour or surface in reciprocal space. The atomic-mixing-free honeycomb antiferromagnet GdZnPO has recently emerged as a promising spiral spin-liquid candidate, hosting nontrivial topological excitations. Despite growing interest, the transport and topological properties of spiral spin liquids remain largely unexplored experimentally. Here, we report transport measurements on high-quality, electrically insulating GdZnPO single crystals. We observe a giant low-temperature magnetic thermal conductivity down to $\sim$50 mK, described by $\kappa_{xx}^\mathrm{m}$ $\sim$ $\kappa_0+\kappa_1T$, where both $\kappa_0$ and $\kappa_1$ are positive constants associated with excitations along and off the spiral contour in reciprocal space, respectively. This behavior parallels the magnetic specific heat, underscoring the presence of mobile low-energy excitations intrinsic to the putative spiral spin liquid. Furthermore, the observed positive thermal Hall effect confirms the topological nature of at least some of these excitations. Our findings provide key insights into the itinerant and topological properties of low-lying spin excitations in the spiral spin-liquid candidate.

Title: In silico investigation of Ba-based ternary chalcogenides for photovoltaic applications
Authors: Ramya Kormath Madam Raghupathy, Hossein Mirhosseini, Thomas D. K√ºhne
Abstract: In solar cells, the absorbers are the key components for capturing solar energy and converting photons into electron-hole pairs. The search for high-performance absorbers with advantageous characteristics is an ongoing task for researchers. In this work, we investigated promising and environmentally benign Ba-based ternary chalcogenides for photovoltaic applications. The total number of Ba-based ternary chalcogenides in the Materials Project database was found to be 279. Materials screening based on bandgap size and stability reduced the number of compounds to 19. The performance of an absorber depends on the charge carrier lifetime, which is controlled by non-radiative processes involving defects. Hence, we investigated the intrinsic defects and p-type dopability of the compounds. We identified two Ba-based compounds, namely \ch{BaCu2Se2} and \ch{ZrBaSe3}, as promising absorbers for single-junction and tandem cells and investigated them in detail.

Title: Weighted Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov method for interacting fermions: An application to ultracold Fermi superfluids
Authors: Nikolai Kaschewski, Axel Pelster, Carlos A. R. S√° de Melo
Abstract: For several decades it has been known that divergences arise in the ground-state energy and chemical potential of unitary superfluids, where the scattering length diverges, due to particle-hole scattering. Leading textbooks and research articles recognize that there are serious issues but ignore them due to the lack of an approach that can regularize these divergences. We find a solution to this difficulty by proposing a general method, called the weighted Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov theory, to handle multiple decomposition channels originating from the same interaction. We distribute the interaction in weighted channels determined by minimization of the action, and we apply this idea to unpolarized Fermi superfluids. Using our method, we solve a long-standing difficulty in the partitioning of the interaction into Hartree, Fock, and Bogoliubov channels for Fermi superfluids, and we obtain a phase diagram at the saddle-point level, which contains multichannel nonperturbative corrections. In particular, we find a previously overlooked superfluid phase for weak interactions, which is dominated by particle-hole processes, in addition to the usual superfluid phase only containing particle-particle physics.

Title: Temperature-Aware Recurrent Neural Operator for Temperature-Dependent Anisotropic Plasticity in HCP Materials
Authors: Yannick Hollenweger, Dennis M. Kochman, Burigede Liu
Abstract: Neural network surrogate models for constitutive laws in computational mechanics have been in use for some time. In plasticity, these models often rely on gated recurrent units (GRUs) or long short-term memory (LSTM) cells, which excel at capturing path-dependent phenomena. However, they suffer from long training times and time-resolution-dependent predictions that extrapolate poorly. Moreover, most existing surrogates for macro- or mesoscopic plasticity handle only relatively simple material behavior. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Temperature-Aware Recurrent Neural Operator (TRNO), a time-resolution-independent neural architecture. We apply the TRNO to model the temperature-dependent plastic response of polycrystalline magnesium, which shows strong plastic anisotropy and thermal sensitivity. The TRNO achieves high predictive accuracy and generalizes effectively across diverse loading cases, temperatures, and time resolutions. It also outperforms conventional GRU and LSTM models in training efficiency and predictive performance. Finally, we demonstrate multiscale simulations with the TRNO, yielding a speedup of at least three orders of magnitude over traditional constitutive models.

Title: Quantum geometry in low-energy linear and nonlinear optical responses of magnetic Rashba semiconductor (Ge,Mn)Te
Authors: Tsubasa Takagi, Hikaru Watanabe, Ryutaro Yoshimi, Yuki Sato, Shingo Toyoda, Atsushi Tsukazaki, Kei S. Takahashi, Masashi Kawasaki, Yoshinori Tokura, Naoki Ogawa
Abstract: Quantum geometry appears as a key factor in understanding the optical properties of quantum materials, with the anticipation on diverging or quantized responses near the Dirac and Weyl points. Here we investigate linear and nonlinear optical responses-optical conductivity and injection current- in a magnetic Rashba semiconductor in the mid-infrared region, with varying the Fermi energy across the Dirac point. We reveal that the linear optical conductivity reflects quantum metric, which remains finite irrespective of the diminishing joint density-of-states at lower photon energy. It is also confirmed that the magnetic injection current enhances depending on the energy of the Fermi level relative to the Dirac point. These optical spectra are nicely reproduced by our theoretical calculations with geometrical effects taken into account.

Title: Kolmogorov-type non-thermal fixed points and beyond of far-from-equilibrium dilute system: ultra-cold Fermi gas
Authors: Chun-Wei Su
Abstract: The far-from-equilibrium dynamics driven by the scattering from next-to-leading-order (NLO) corrections in the quantum field theory has stationary solutions for the particle distribution characterized as the Kolmogorov-type non-thermal fixed points. The dynamics of the spatially homogeneous, isotropic dilute ultra-cold Fermi gas is investigated, and its kinetic equation confirms the Kolmogorov-type non-thermal fixed points in the perturbation theory by the quasi-particle assumption, in contrast to the wave turbulence of the weakly coupled ultra-cold Bose gas. In addition, other stationary states are found without the quasi-particle assumption and in a strongly coupled system. These analytical solutions provide chances for future experiments and numerical simulations in search of far-from-equilibrium stationary states of the dilute system.

Title: Single-Photon Detection in Few-Layer NbSe$_2$ Superconducting Nanowires

Abstract: Superconducting Nanowire Single-Photon Detectors (SNSPDs) are key building blocks for photonic quantum technologies due to their ability to detect single photons with ultra-high efficiency, low dark counts and fast temporal resolution. Superconducting materials exhibiting high uniformity, large absorption cross-section and atomic-scale thickness are desirable to extend single-photon detection from the near-infrared up to the terahertz regime, where existing material choices are especially constrained. Substrate independence would further open the way to integrate detectors onto functional materials and heterostructures, enhancing performance and enabling proximal read-out of a wide range of individual excitations. Here, we top-down shape the prototypical two-dimensional superconductor niobium diselenide (NbSe$_2$) into few-layer nanowires less than 100 nm wide and demonstrate single-photon detection at 780 and 1550 nm. At the same time, the dark-count rate remains below 1 Hz up to the switching current and we achieve a timing jitter below 50 ps. We use a diffusive hot-spot model to estimate a theoretical cut-off wavelength that surpasses the millimetre range. Our results open up routes toward quantum limited detectors integrated into quantum-photonic circuits and quantum devices, with the potential for novel detection capabilities and unprecedented energy sensitivity.

Title: Designing Antiferromagnetic Spin-1/2 Chains in Janus Fullerene Nanoribbons
Authors: Bo Peng, Michele Pizzochero
Abstract: We computationally design antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 chains in fullerene nanoribbons by introducing extra C$_{60}$ cages at one of their edges. The resulting odd number of intermolecular bonds induces an unpaired $\pi$-electron and hence a quantised magnetic moment in otherwise non-magnetic nanoribbons. We further reveal the formation of an antiferromagnetic ground state upon the linear arrangement of spin-$1/2$ C$_{60}$ cages that is insensitive to the specific structural motifs. Compared with graphene nanoribbons, Janus fullerene nanoribbons may offer an experimentally more accessible route to magnetic edge states with atomic precision in low-dimensional carbon nanostructures, possibly serving as a versatile nanoarchitecture for scalable spin-based devices and the exploration of many-body quantum phases.

Title: Striking Similarities in Dynamics and Vibrations of 2D Quasicrystals and Supercooled Liquids
Authors: Edwin A. Bedolla-Montiel, Marjolein Dijkstra
Abstract: We investigate the interplay between structure and dynamics in two structurally distinct two-dimensional systems: a dodecagonal quasicrystal (DDQC) and a supercooled binary liquid. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we uncover striking dynamical similarities despite their fundamentally different structural organizations. Both systems exhibit pronounced dynamic heterogeneities, as evidenced by the cage-trapping plateaus in the mean-squared displacement and the pronounced peaks in the non-Gaussian parameter. In both cases, we observe a strong correlation between local structural order and dynamic propensity, indicating similar structure-dynamics relationships, albeit driven by distinct microscopic mechanisms. Despite these parallels, their vibrational properties diverge: the DDQC exhibits multiple peaks linked to phason dynamics, while the supercooled liquid displays a characteristic boson peak. Analysis of vibrational eigenmodes shows that both systems exhibit extended modes at low frequencies. At high frequencies, however, the DDQC maintains a higher density of topological defects, reflecting its quasi-long-range order. Finally, we contextualize these findings by comparing both systems to a square crystal. While the dynamics appears similar across all three systems, the vibrational and topological features clearly distinguish the DDQC and glass from the crystalline state. These results underscore a surprising universality in dynamical behavior across structurally diverse systems and provide new insights into how structural organization shapes motion in soft-matter systems.

Title: Strong and Engineerable Optical Anisotropy in Easily Integrable Epitaxial SrO(SrTiO 3 ) N Ruddlesden--Popper Thin Layers

Abstract: Optical anisotropy is a key property for numerous photonic devices. However, bulk anisotropic materials suitable for such applications remain relatively scarse and are often challenging to synthesize as thin films. Additionally, the optical losses as well as the complex structuration of anisotropic metamaterials hinder their integrability in photonic devices. Based on ellipsometry measurements coupled with reflectance, it is demonstrated here that Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) SrO(SrTiO 3 ) N phases (STO-RP N ), epitaxial thin films composed of a SrTiO 3 lattice periodically interrupted by one SrO atomic plane every N unit cells, exhibit pronounced dichroism and birefringence over a broad spectral range. Notably, this anisotropy is tunable by adjusting the RP order N. In contrast to most other anisotropic materials reported in the literature, STO-RP N thin layers can be fabricated using industry-standard growth processes. As it can be epitaxially grown on Si and GaAs using SrTiO 3 templates, the work paves the way for their compact integration on these photonic platforms.

Title: Microscale optoelectronic synapses with switchable photocurrent from halide perovskite
Authors: Jeroen J. de Boer, Agustin O. Alvarez, Moritz C. Schmidt, Dimitrios Sitaridis, Bruno Ehrler
Abstract: Efficient visual data processing by neuromorphic networks requires volatile artificial synapses that detect and process light inputs, ideally in the same device. Here, we demonstrate microscale back-contacted optoelectronic halide perovskite artificial synapses that leverage ion migration induced by a bias voltage to modulate their photocurrent. The photocurrent changes are due to the accumulation of mobile ions, which induces a transient electric field in the perovskite. The photocurrent changes are volatile, decaying on the order of seconds. The photocurrent changes can be controlled by both the applied voltage and illumination. The symmetric device supports changing of the photocurrent polarity, switching between inhibitory and exhibitory functioning. The photocurrent can be updated by spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP)-learning rules inspired by biology. We show with simulations how this could be exploited as an attention mechanism in a neuromorphic detector. Our fabrication procedure is compatible with high-density integration with CMOS and memristive neuromorphic networks for energy-efficient visual data processing inspired by the brain.

Title: Stochastic Forces Enhance Tracer Diffusion in Non-motile Active Matter
Authors: Henry Alston, Raphael Voituriez, Thibault Bertrand
Abstract: Stochasticity is a defining feature of the pairwise forces governing interactions in biological systems-from molecular motors to cell-cell adhesion-yet its consequences on large-scale dynamics remain poorly understood. Here, we show that reciprocal but randomly fluctuating interactions between particles create active suspensions which can enhance the diffusion of an external tracer particle, even in the absence of self-propulsion or non-reciprocity. Starting from a lattice model with pairwise dynamics that minimally break detailed balance, we derive a coarse-grained dynamical theory for spatio-temporal density fluctuations and reveal an elevated effective temperature at short wavelengths. We then compute the self-diffusion coefficient of a tracer particle weakly coupled to our active fluid, demonstrating that purely reciprocal stochastic interactions provide a distinct and generic route to enhanced diffusivity in dense non-equilibrium suspensions.

Title: Non-Exponential Relaxation in the Rotating Frame of a Driven Nanomechanical Mode
Authors: Hyunjin Choi, Oriel Shoshani, Ryundon Kim, Younghun Ryu, Jinhoon Jeong, Junho Suh, Steven W. Shaw, M. I. Dykman, Hyoungsoon Choi
Abstract: We present direct observation of the ring-down dynamics in the rotating frame of a resonantly driven single-mode nonlinear nanomechanical resonator. An additional close to resonance harmonic force excites nonlinear oscillations about the fixed point in the rotating frame. When the secondary drive is removed, we measure decay of the in-phase and quadrature components toward this fixed point. We show that the decay of the in-phase signal is non-exponential, even though the vibration amplitude decays exponentially if both forces are switched off. A minimalistic model captures these dynamics as well as the spectrum of the vibrations excited by the additional force, relating them to the dissipation-induced symmetry breaking of the dynamics in the rotating frame.

Title: 3D Strain Field Reconstruction by Inversion of Dynamical Scattering
Authors: Laura Niermann, Tore Niermann, Chengyu Song, Colin Ophus
Abstract: Strain governs not only the mechanical response of materials but also their electronic, optical, and catalytic properties. For this reason, the measurement of the 3D strain field is crucial for a detailed understanding and for further developments of material properties through strain engineering. However, measuring strain variations along the electron beam direction has remained a major challenge for (scanning-) transmission electron microscopy (S/TEM). In this article, we present a method for 3D strain field determination using 4D-STEM. The method is based on the inversion of dynamical diffraction effects, which occur at strain field variations along the beam direction. We test the method against simulated data with a known ground truth and demonstrate its application to an experimental 4D-STEM dataset from an inclined pseudomorphically grown Al$_{0.47}$Ga$_{0.53}$N layer.

Title: A comparative nanotribological investigation on amorphous and polycrystalline forms of MoS2
Authors: Hesam Khaksar, Prashant Mittal, Nabil Daghbouj, Grzegorz Cios, Tomas Polcar, Enrico Gnecco
Abstract: The wear behavior of two amorphous and polycrystalline forms of MoS2 prepared by magnetron sputtering has been characterized in a combined nanoindentation and atomic force microscopy study. From the analysis of the depth and width of wear tracks estimated after scratching the surfaces with a Berkovich indenter and a loading force up to 2 mN, we conclude that both forms follow the Archard wear equation, and the wear resistance is about four times higher on the amorphous MoS2. Moreover, a comparison of lateral force maps on pristine and worn areas shows a considerable reduction of friction on both forms, which is possibly due to the significant smoothing of the surfaces caused by scratching. With normal forces in the micro N range, the analysis is made difficult by the fact that the linear dimensions of the wear tracks are comparable to those of the granular structures forming the surfaces. Even if the Archard equation could not be tested in this case, the wear resistance is considerably larger on amorphous MoS2 also on the nanoscale. In this way, our results disclose information on the nanotribology of MoS2 thin films in forms different from the layered structures commonly discussed in the literature. The amorphous form outperforms the polycrystalline one.

Title: Exploring nanoscale metallic multilayer Ta/Cu films: Structure and some insights on deformation and strengthening mechanisms
Authors: Daniel Karpinski, Tomas Polcar, Andrey Bondarev
Abstract: Nanoscale metallic multilayer (NMM) films are systems offering insight into the role of interfaces in metal plasticity, deformation, and strengthening mechanisms. Magnetron sputtering was used to fabricate the Ta-Cu NMM films with a periodicity (equal Ta and Cu layer thickness) from 6 to 80 nm, with resulting structure exhibiting strongly incoherent tetragonal beta-Ta and face-centered cubic Cu phase. The high-load indentation test, TEM studies, and the rCLS model collectively demonstrate that all NMM films predominantly undergo plastic deformation. This plastic deformation primarily occurs within the soft Cu layer, while the propagation of dislocations across the incoherent interface is largely excluded.

Abstract: We perform an extensive investigation of the localization properties of the eigenmodes of the Laplace and adjacency matrix for one-dimensional random geometric graphs. We evaluate the density of states, the probability distribution of the participation ratio and its relation to the eigenvalue. By disentangling the influence of system size, graph component size distribution, mean degree of nodes, network motifs, and degeneracy, we provide a comprehensive understanding of this system. We compare our findings to ordered graphs with the same mean degree and to one-dimensional tight-binding models.

Title: Mass-induced Coulomb drag in capacitively coupled superconducting nanowires
Authors: Aleksandr Latyshev, Adrien Tom√†, Eugene V. Sukhorukov
Abstract: We investigate Coulomb drag in a system of two capacitively coupled superconducting nanowires. In this context, drag refers to the appearance of a stationary voltage in the passive wire in response to a current bias applied to the active one. Quantum phase slips (QPS) in the biased wire generate voltage fluctuations that can be transmitted to the other. Using perturbative and semiclassical approaches, we show that when both wires are superconducting the induced voltage vanishes due to exact cancellation of plasmon contributions. By contrast, when the second wire is tuned below the superconductor-insulator transition and develops a mass gap, this cancellation is lifted and a finite drag voltage emerges. The drag coefficient exhibits a crossover from weak drag in short wires to a maximal value set by the mutual capacitance in long wires. A semiclassical picture of voltage pulse propagation clarifies the physical origin of the effect: the mass term synchronizes plasmon modes and prevents complete cancellation of induced signals. Our results establish a mechanism of mass-induced Coulomb drag in low-dimensional superconductors and suggest new routes for probing nonlocal transport near quantum criticality.

Title: Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations and planar Hall effect in HfTe2
Authors: Qixuan Li, Gangjian Jin, Nannan Tang, Bin Wang, Bing Shen, Donghui Guo, Dingyong Zhong, Huakun Zuo, Huichao Wang
Abstract: Layered transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMD) HfTe2 is a topological semimetal candidate with increasing attentions recently. The map of the Fermi surface is of interest and importance to understand its properties. Here we present a study of Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations and planar Hall effect (PHE) in HfTe2. The single crystals grown by flux method show the largest unsaturated magnetoresistance (MR) effect of 1.1*104 % at 14 T and 2 K. The angle-resolved SdH oscillations reveal that the Fermi surface consists of three pockets with different anisotropy. In addition, we observe PHE and anisotropic MR (AMR) effect in the material for a wide temperature range. The effective mass, carrier density and quantum transport mobility are quantified in the system, and the Berry phase is discussed. Our work provides crucial insights into the electronic structure and the Fermi surface of the semimetal.

Abstract: We measure and model electroadhesion across multi-asperity silicon interfaces with nanometer scale roughness. When electrically biased, our naturally oxidized silicon interfaces display a leakage current consistent with the Fowler-Nordheim model and electroadhesion that can be successfully captured using a boundary element contact model. We show that polysilicon exhibits electroadhesion only under positive bias applied to the substrate monocrystalline wafer, which we interpret as a result of the reduced mobility of holes, with respect to electrons, within polysilicon. Overall, our findings reveal that electrostatic interactions can significantly enhance adhesion and friction between stiff and smooth surfaces, which can be important for example in precision positioning applications.

Title: Linear approximations of large deviations: Cubic diffusion test
Authors: Pelerine Tsobgni Nyawo, Hugo Touchette
Abstract: We propose a method for approximating the large deviation rate function of time-integrated observables of diffusion processes, used in statistical physics to characterize the fluctuations of nonequilibrium systems. The method is based on linearizing the effective process associated with the large deviations of the process and observable considered, and is tested for a simple one-dimensional nonlinear diffusion model involving a cubic drift. The results show that the linear approximation compares well with the exact rate function, especially in the large fluctuation regime, and that its accuracy is related to the way the linearized process localizes in space. Possible extensions and applications to more complex diffusion models are proposed for future work.

Title: Junctional-Fluctuation-Mediated Fluidisation of Multi-Phase Field Epithelial Monolayers
Authors: James N. Graham, Jan Rozman
Abstract: We analyse a multi-phase field model for an epithelial monolayer with pairwise adhesions between neighbouring cells following an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, representing the stochastic turnover of junctional molecular motors. These fluctuations in junctional adhesion result in rearrangements in the tissue, fluidising it and producing diffusive cell motion. Similar junctional fluctuations have proven a very useful tool in the vertex model literature, and we hope they will be equally helpful to the multi-phase field model approach. Moreover, we observe that the cells' effective diffusion coefficient depends non-monotonically on the persistence time of the fluctuations, confirming results previously observed in the vertex model.

Title: Channel flows of deformable nematics
Authors: Ioannis Hadjifrangiskou, Sumesh P. Thampi, Julia M. Yeomans
Abstract: We describe channel flows in a continuum model of deformable nematic particles. In a simple shear flow, deformability leads to a nonlinear coupling of strain rate and vorticity, and results in shape oscillations or flow alignment. The final steady state can depend on initial conditions, and we explain this behaviour by considering a phase space representation of the dynamics. In Poiseuille flow, particle deformability and nematic elasticity induce banding, where particles near the walls are aligned, and those near the centre of the channel oscillate in direction and shape. Our results show that particle deformability can lead to complex behaviour even in simple flows, suggesting new microfluidic experiments.

Title: Density-Velocity Relation Is Scale-Dependent in Epithelial Monolayers
Authors: Hengdong Lu, Tianxiang Ma, Amin Doostmohammadi
Abstract: The relationship between cell density and velocity is often assumed to be negative, reflecting crowding-induced suppression of movement. However, observations across systems reveal a more nuanced picture: while some emphasize contact inhibition of locomotion, others suggest that dense regions exhibit enhanced activity due to force generation and stress buildup. Here, using experimental measurements we show that density-velocity relations in epithelial monolayers are inherently scale dependent. By coarse-graining cell trajectories over multiple spatial windows, we find that cell velocity correlates positively with local density at small scales, but negatively at large scales. Employing traction force measurements, we find that this crossover coincides with the emergence of mechanical pressure segregation, defining a characteristic length scale beyond which crowding dominates. A minimal model incorporating activity-induced shape changes reproduces this crossover and identifies the competition between active force generation and mechanical confinement as the underlying mechanism. Our results reconcile conflicting views of density-regulated migration and highlight an emergent length scale as a key factor in interpreting collective cell dynamics.

Title: Giant octupole moment in magnetic multilayers
Authors: Chang Niu, Lulu Li, Yiqing Wang, Lei Wang, Ke Xia
Abstract: Multipole moments serve as order parameters for characterizing higher-order magnetic effects in momentum space, providing a framework to describe diverse magnetic responses by extending the concept of magnetism. In this letter, we introduce a methodology to quantitatively determine the multipole moment contributions in anomalous Hall effect through angle-dependent anomalous Hall current, with explicit incorporation of discrete crystal symmetries. Our technique uniquely enables the investigation of octupole contribution in non-periodic systems, particularly at interfaces and surfaces. Typically, in (Ag$_{2}$Fe$_{5}$)$_{n}$ multilayers with quantum-well-engineered $k$-point selectivity, we observe an octupole-dominated anomalous Hall effect in conventional ferromagnetic materials, through first-principles calculations. These results fundamentally challenge the existing theoretical understanding of the anomalous Hall effect, showing that even the conventional contribution arises not only from the dipole moment (net magnetization). Furthermore, we establish practical control over the octupole contribution through two distinct approaches: interface engineering and magnetic ordering reconfiguration, opening new possibilities for manipulating higher-order transport effects.

Title: On the role played by electrons in the stress-strain curves of ideal crystalline solids
Authors: Margherita Marsili, Elisa Damiani, Davide Dalle Ave, Gabriele Losi, M. Clelia Righi
Abstract: The mechanical properties of a solid, which relate its deformation to external applied forces, are key factors in enabling or disabling the use of an otherwise optimal material in any application, strongly influencing also its service lifetime. Intrinsic crystal deformation mechanisms, investigated experimentally on single crystals with low dislocation densities, have been studied theoretically through atomistic simulations, mainly focusing on lattice-induced instabilities. Here, instead, we employ density functional theory and a thermodynamic analysis to probe and analyze the way in which the electronic charge of crystalline solids (Cu, Al and diamond) responds to uniaxial strain and affects their mechanical properties. Indeed, despite the very simple nature of our models, and in the presence of minimal atomic displacements, we find that the stress strain curves of Cu and Al deviate from a simple linear elastic behavior. Within a thermodynamics perspective, the features of such curves can be interpreted in terms of first and second order phase transitions. Within a thermodynamics perspective, the features of such curves can be interpreted in terms of first and second order phase transitions, which originate from Van-Hove singularities of the electronic density of states crossing the Fermi level and electron redistribution within the solid, respectively.

Title: YSGAG: The Ideal Substrate for YIG in Quantum Magnonics
Authors: Rostyslav O. Serha, Carsten Dubs, Christo Guguschev, Bernd Aichner, David Schmoll, Jaganandha Panda, Matthias Weiler, Philipp Pirro, Michal Urb√°nek, Andrii V. Chumak
Abstract: Quantum magnonics leverages the quantum mechanical properties of magnons for advancing nanoscale quantum information technologies. Ferrimagnetic yttrium iron garnet (YIG), known for its exceptionally long magnon lifetimes, is a cornerstone material for magnonics and is typically grown into thin films on gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG) substrates due to near-perfect lattice matching. However, the paramagnetic nature of GGG introduces damping mechanisms detrimental to quantum applications at low temperatures. Here, we present a study of magnetic damping in a 150$\,$nm-thick YIG film grown on a 500$\,\mu$m-thick yttrium scandium gallium aluminium garnet (YSGAG) substrate, a newly developed diamagnetic alternative to GGG. Using ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) spectroscopy at temperatures as low as 30$\,$mK, we compare the damping characteristics of the YIG/YSGAG system with those of a conventional YIG/GGG reference system. Our results demonstrate that the YIG/YSGAG system maintains low magnetic damping from room temperature, with $\alpha = 4.29\times10^{-5}$, which is the lowest value reported so far for YIG/GGG films and comparable to the best YIG bulk material, and down to 30$\,$mK, with no significant temperature-dependent increase in damping. In this substrate, the low-temperature damping mechanisms associated with paramagnetic spins, prominent in GGG, are effectively eliminated. Consequently, YSGAG serves as an ideal substrate for YIG films in quantum magnonics and is paving the way for the development of spin-wave-based quantum technologies.

Title: Optical control over topological Chern number in moir√© materials
Authors: Olivier Huber, Kilian Kuhlbrodt, Eric Anderson, Weijie Li, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Martin Kroner, Xiaodong Xu, Atac Imamoglu, Tomasz Smolenski
Abstract: Controlling quantum matter with light offers a promising route to dynamically tune its many-body properties, ranging from band topology to superconductivity. However, achieving such optical control for strongly correlated electron systems in the steady-state has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate all-optical switching of the spin-valley degree of freedom of itinerant ferromagnets in twisted MoTe2 homobilayers. This system uniquely features flat valley-contrasting Chern bands and exhibits a range of strongly correlated phases at various moir√© lattice fillings, including Chern insulators and ferromagnetic metals. We show that the spin-valley orientation of all of these phases can be dynamically reversed by resonantly exciting the attractive polaron transition with circularly-polarized light. These findings not only constitute the first direct evidence for non-thermal switching of a ferromagnetic spin state at zero magnetic field, but also demonstrate the possibility of dynamical control over topological order parameter, paving the way for all-optical generation of chiral edge modes and topological quantum circuits.

Title: Quantum diatomic chain: a supersolid structure in three-component Bose mixture
Authors: Francesco Ancilotto
Abstract: The formation and properties of a supersolid structure in a three-component ultracold Bose gas mixture at T=0 are investigated theoretically. The system consists of 23Na, 39K, and 41K atomic species, in which the binary mixtures of (23Na,39K) and (39K,41K) can form self-bound quantum droplets stabilized by quantum fluctuations. Two such droplets can bind together by the shared 39K component, forming a stable "dimer" structure, which displays vibrational modes analogous to a classical diatomic molecule. A simple protocol is proposed to create a stable linear chain formed by periodic repetition of this basic building block, i.e. an alternating sequence of (23Na,39K) and (39K,41K) droplets. This structure exhibits both periodic density modulations from the droplet ordering and global phase coherence due to the shared 39K component, satisfying the criteria for supersolidity, and therefore adding another system to the gallery of supersolid structures in cold atoms arena. The low-energy excitation spectrum, probed by density perturbations, identifies modes corresponding to droplet vibrations close to the ones expected from a classical diatomic chain.

Title: Tunneling spectroscopy of the spinon-Kondo effect in one-dimensional Mott insulators
Authors: Rodrigo G. Pereira, Bruno F. Marquez, Karen Hallberg, Tim Bauer, Reinhold Egger
Abstract: We study the tunneling density of states (TDOS) in one-dimensional Mott insulators at energies below the charge gap. By employing nonlinear Luttinger liquid theory and density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations, we predict that in the presence of a magnetic impurity at the boundary, characteristic Fermi-edge singularity features can appear at subgap energies in the TDOS near the boundary. In contrast to the Kondo effect in a metal, these resonances are strongly asymmetric and of power-law form. The power-law exponent is universal and determined by the spinon-Kondo effect.

Title: Thermoelectric evidence of the electronic structure changes from the charge-density-wave transition in FeGe
Authors: Kaila Jenkins, Yuan Zhu, Dechen Zhang, Guoxin Zheng, Kuan-Wen Chen, Aaron Chan, Sijie Xu, Mason L. Klemm, Bin Gao, Ming Yi, Pengcheng Dai, Lu Li
Abstract: Kagome metals provide a material platform for probing new correlated quantum phenomena due to the naturally incorporated linear dispersions, flat bands, and Van Hove singularities in their electronic structures. Among these quantum phenomena is the charge density wave (CDW), or the distortion of the lattice structure due to the motion of correlated electrons through the material. CDWs lower the energy of the compound, creating an energy gap that facilitates behaviors akin to superconductivity, nonlinear transport, or other quantum correlated phenomena. The kagome metal FeGe has been shown to host a CDW transition at approximately 100 K, and its occurrence is strongly influenced by the sample annealing conditions. However, a notable gap in the literature is the lack of clear thermoelectric transport evidence for electronic structure changes associated with this CDW transition. Here we present evidence of electron behavior modification due to annealing disorder via thermoelectric measurements on FeGe crystals presenting a CDW transition and those without a CDW. The observed Nernst effect and Seebeck effect under sufficient annealing demonstrate modified electrical transport properties resulting from induced disorder, including a change in carrier sign and an enhancement of the Nernst effect due to the CDW. Our results provide evidence of multiple phase transitions, which confirms the influence of CDW on the thermal properties of FeGe and demonstrates the suppression of CDW with sufficient disordering.

Title: Lattice vacancy migration barriers in Fe-Ni alloys, and why Ni atoms diffuse slowly: An ab initio study
Authors: Adam M. Fisher, Christopher D. Woodgate, Xiaoyu Zhang, George C. Hadjipanayis, Laura H. Lewis, Julie B. Staunton
Abstract: The mobility of both Fe and Ni atoms in ferromagnetic $\textrm{Fe}_x \textrm{Ni}_{1-x}$ alloys ($0.4 \leq x \leq 0.6$) is investigated within the framework of ab initio electronic structure calculations, using the nudged elastic band (NEB) method to accurately quantify energetic barriers to lattice vacancy migration. Both the atomically disordered ($A1$) fcc phase, as well as the atomically ordered, tetragonal $\textrm{L}1_0$ phase - which is under consideration as a material for a rare-earth-free 'gap' magnet for advanced engineering applications - are investigated. Across an ensemble of NEB calculations performed on supercell configurations spanning a range of compositions and containing disordered, partially ordered, and fully ordered structures, we find that Ni atoms are consistently significantly less mobile than Fe atoms. Crucially, we are able to interpret these findings in terms of the ferromagnetic alloy's underlying spin-polarised electronic structure. Specifically, we report a coupling between the size of local lattice distortions and the magnitude of the local electronic spin polarisation around vacancies. This causes Fe atoms to relax into lattice vacancies, while Ni atoms remain rigidly fixed to their original lattice positions. This effect plays a key role in determining the reduced mobility of Ni atoms compared to that of Fe atoms. These results shed atomic-scale insight into the longstanding experimental observation that Ni exhibits remarkably slow atomic diffusion in Fe-Ni alloys.

Title: Interferences Measure Topology
Authors: Yuval Abulafia, Eric Akkermans
Abstract: Topological materials are characterized by integer invariants that underpin their robust quantized electronic features, as famously exemplified by the Chern number in the integer quantum Hall effect. Yet, in most candidate systems, the observable linked to the topological invariant is unknown, preventing direct verification of their topological nature. Here we present a general method to identify topological materials by analyzing the local electronic density, $\delta \rho(\boldsymbol{r})$, and connecting it to Atiyah Singer index theorems. This approach enables a direct measurement of the winding number, the topological invariant of Hamiltonians with chiral symmetry, through a contour independent dislocation pattern of $\delta \rho(\boldsymbol{r})$ created by interference from topological defects. Our method thus provides a direct route to detect and characterize quantum topological states, paving the way for their use as robust and entangleable building blocks in quantum technologies.

Title: Alloyed cementite (Fe-Ni-Cr)3C: structure and hyperfine field from DFT calculations and experimental comparison
Authors: Lyudmila V. Dobysheva
Abstract: The alloying elements introduced into carbon steel to enhance its mechanical properties also diffuse into cementite (Fe3C) particles, modifying their characteristics and thereby influencing the overall performance of the steel. This study employs density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate cementite doped with Ni and Cr which exhibit contrasting effects. The preferred lattice sites of impurity atoms were determined through a comparison of calculated and experimental structural parameters. The formation mechanism of the hyperfine magnetic field (HFF) and its correlation with atomic magnetic moments were systematically investigated. The validity of common approximations in M√∂ssbauer spectroscopy analysis was evaluated for the cementite system. HFF distribution functions were modeled using calculated values and compared with experiments.

Title: Measuring high field gradients of cobalt nanomagnets in a spin-mechanical setup
Authors: Felix Hahne, Teresa Klara Pfau, Liza ≈Ωaper, Lucio Stefan, Thibault Capelle, Andrea Ranfagni, Martino Poggio, Albert Schliesser
Abstract: Hybrid systems composed of a single nitrogen-vacancy center spin magnetically coupled to a macroscopic mechanical resonator constitute promising platforms for the realization of quantum information protocols and for quantum sensing applications. The magnetic structure that mediates the interaction must ensure high field gradients while preserving the spin and mechanical properties. We present a spin-mechanical setup built around a cobalt nanomagnet grown with focused electron beam-induced deposition. The magnetic structure is fully characterized, and a maximum gradient of $170\,\mathrm{kT/m}$ is directly measured at a spin-oscillator distance of a few hundred nanometers. Spin coherence was preserved at the value of $20\,\mathrm{ \mu s}$ up to a gradient of $25\,\mathrm{kT/m}$. The effect of the mechanical motion onto the spin dynamics was observed, thus signifying the presence of spin-mechanics coupling. Given the noninvasive nature of the nanomagnet deposition process, we foresee the adoption of such structures in hybrid platforms with high-quality factor resonators, in the "magnet on oscillator" configuration.

Title: The charge-carrier trapping effect on 1/f noise in monolayer graphene
Authors: K.A. Kazakov, T.M. Valitov
Abstract: The frequency exponent of 1/f noise in graphene-boron nitride heterostructures is known to have multiple extrema in its dependence on the charge carrier concentration. This behavior is explained in the present paper as a result of the charge carrier trapping by impurities in the boron nitride. A kinetic equation for the charge carriers subject to trapping and interacting with acoustic phonons is derived. This equation is solved numerically, and the equilibrium solutions are used to evaluate the frequency exponent according to the quantum theory of 1/f noise. It is found that the frequency exponent does develop several minima and maxima, provided that the trapping probability is sufficiently wide and has a threshold with respect to the charge carrier energy. A detailed comparison with the experimental data is made, and the results are used to estimate the energy threshold and the trapping cross-section.

Title: MC3D: The Materials Cloud computational database of experimentally known stoichiometric inorganics
Authors: Sebastiaan P. Huber, Michail Minotakis, Marnik Bercx, Timo Reents, Kristjan Eimre, Nataliya Paulish, Nicolas H√∂rmann, Martin Uhrin, Nicola Marzari, Giovanni Pizzi
Abstract: DFT is a widely used method to compute properties of materials, which are often collected in databases and serve as valuable starting points for further studies. In this article, we present the Materials Cloud Three-Dimensional Structure Database (MC3D), an online database of computed three-dimensional (3D) inorganic crystal structures. Close to a million experimentally reported structures were imported from the COD, ICSD and MPDS databases; these were parsed and filtered to yield a collection of 72589 unique and stoichiometric structures, of which 95% are, to date, classified as experimentally known. The geometries of structures with up to 64 atoms were then optimized using density-functional theory (DFT) with automated workflows and curated input protocols. The procedure was repeated for different functionals (and computational protocols), with the latest version (MC3D PBEsol-v2) comprising 32013 unique structures. All versions of the MC3D are made available on the Materials Cloud portal, which provides a graphical interface to explore and download the data. The database includes the full provenance graph of all the calculations driven by the automated workflows, thus establishing full reproducibility of the results and more-than-FAIR procedures.

Title: Phase Coherent Transport in Two-Dimensional Tellurium Flakes
Authors: Mohammad Hafijur Rahaman, Nathan Sawyers, Mourad Benamara, Trudie Culverhouse, Repaka Maheswar, Qiyuan He, Hugh Churchill, Dharmraj Kotekar Patil
Abstract: Elemental tellurium (Te) is a compelling van der Waals material due to its interesting chiral crystal structure and predicted topological properties. Here, we report the fabrication and comprehensive quantum transport study of devices based on Te flakes with varying thicknesses. We demonstrate a hole mobility reaching up to 1000 cm2/V.s in a 17 nm thick flake at 30 Kelvin. At deep cryogenic temperatures (< 50mK), the transport characteristics transition from Coulomb blockade in the low carrier density regime to pronounced Fabry-P√©rot (F-P) interference at higher densities. Notably, the visibility of these F-P oscillations is significantly enhanced in the thinner flake device. The application of a magnetic field reveals a clear Zeeman splitting of the conductance peaks. The rich variety of quantum transport phenomena observed underscores the high quality of our thin Te flakes and establishes them as a promising platform for exploring novel physics and device concepts, such as topological superconductivity and low-power spintronic applications.

Title: Disorder-induced proximate quantum spin ice phase in Pr$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$
Authors: Yi Luo, Joseph A. M. Paddison, Brenden R. Ortiz, Miles Knudtson, Stephen D. Wilson, Jue Liu, Benjamin A. Frandsen, Si Athena Chen, Matthias Frontzek, Andrey Podlesnyak, Adam A. Aczel
Abstract: We report a comprehensive bulk characterization and neutron scattering investigation of single-crystalline Pr$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$, a magnetic pyrochlore synthesized via a flux-growth method. Unpolarized neutron diffuse scattering reveals the emergence of spin-ice correlations below $T \sim 1$ K, evidenced by the development of anisotropic pinch-point features that are consistent with quantum-spin-ice (QSI) behavior. A.C. susceptibility measurements indicate a progressive slowing of spin dynamics in this regime, culminating in complete spin freezing below $T_f \approx 0.15$ K. Inelastic neutron scattering at $T = 0.5$ K reveals a broad spectrum of quasi-elastic magnetic excitations, with intensity in the low-energy range $[0, 0.2]$ meV significantly suppressed below $T_f$. Meanwhile, an incipient (100)-type magnetic order begins to nucleate, and a gapped excitation centered at $\hbar\omega = 0.23$ meV persists. We further identify two distinct dynamical timescales above $T_f$, a slow component $\tau_{\mathrm{slow}} \sim 10^{-5}$ s and a fast component $\tau_{\mathrm{fast}} \sim 10^{-10}$ s, in quantitative agreement with theoretical predictions for QSI systems. Taken together, these results indicate that Pr$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$ enters a disorder-induced spin-frozen phase below $T_f$, lying in close proximity to a $U(1)$ quantum spin liquid.

Title: Tsunami Solitons Emerging from Superconducting Gap
Authors: Daisuke A. Takahashi
Abstract: We propose a classical integrable system exhibiting the tsunami-like solitons with rocky-desert-like disordered stationary background. One of the Lax operator describing this system is interpretable as a Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian in parity-mixed superconductor. The family of integrable equations is generated from this seed operator by Krichever's method, whose pure $s$-wave limit includes the coupled Schr√∂dinger-Boussinesq hierarchy applied to plasma physics. A linearly unstable finite background with superconducting gap supports the tsunami-soliton solution, where the propagation of the step structure turns back at a certain moment, accompanied with the oscillation on the opposite side. In addition, the equation allows inhomogeneous stationary solutions with arbitrary number of bumps at arbitrary positions, which we coin \textit{the KdV rocks}. In the Zakharov-Shabat scheme, the tsunami solitons are created from the Bogoliubov quasiparticles in energy gap and the KdV rocks from normal electrons/holes. The unexpected large space of stationary solutions comes from the non-coprime Lax pair and the multi-valued Baker-Akhiezer functions on the Riemann surface, formulated in terms of higher-rank holomorphic bundles by Krichever and Novikov. Furthermore, the concept of \textit{isodispersive phases} is introduced to characterize quasiperiodic multi-tsunami backgrounds and consider its classification.

Title: A Tale of Two Uplifts: Parisi-Sourlas with Defects
Authors: Kausik Ghosh, Emilio Trevisani
Abstract: Defects in conformal field theories (CFTs) play a key role in critical phenomena by modifying scaling behaviors and generating new universality classes. We introduce Parisi-Sourlas (PS) supersymmetry in the presence of extended operators and demonstrate that any $p$-dimensional defect in a CFT$_d$ can be uplifted to a defect in a PS-supersymmetric CFT$_{d+2}$. Surprisingly, there are actually two distinct uplifted defects--of dimensions $p$ and $p+2$--which reduce to the original one. We show how this reduction works for correlators with insertions both in the bulk and on the defect. As a byproduct, we find new relations between defect conformal blocks in dimensions $d$ and $d+2$. We further show that the reduction of the $p$-dimensional defect implies and extend a "global symmetry reduction" previously considered in the literature. Finally, we provide various examples of these uplifts, including perturbative computations in epsilon expansion of the uplift of the Ising magnetic line defect, as well as exact computations of observables in the four-dimensional uplift of minimal models with boundaries.

Title: Extendibility of Fermionic Gaussian States
Authors: Amir-Reza Negari, Farzin Salek
Abstract: We investigate $(k_1,k_2)$-extendibility of fermionic Gaussian states, a property central to quantum correlations and approximations of separability. We show that these states are $(k_1,k_2)$-extendible if and only if they admit a fermionic Gaussian extension, yielding a complete covariance-matrix characterization and a simple semidefinite program (SDP) whose size scales linearly with the number of modes. This provides necessary conditions for arbitrary fermionic states and is sufficient within the Gaussian setting. Our main result is a finite de Finetti--type theorem: we derive trace-norm bounds between $(k_1,k_2)$-extendible fermionic Gaussian states and separable states, improving previous exponential scaling to linear in the number of modes, with complementary relative entropy and squashed entanglement bounds. For two modes, upper and lower bounds match at order $1/\sqrt{k_1 k_2}$. Extendibility also provides operational support for one of the different notions of separability in fermionic systems. Finally, for fermionic Gaussian channels, we provide an SDP criterion for anti-degradability and show that entanglement-breaking channels coincide with replacement channels, implying no nontrivial entanglement-breaking fermionic Gaussian channels exist.

Title: Violation of kinetic uncertainty relation in maser heat engines: Role of spontaneous emission
Authors: Varinder Singh, Euijoon Kwon, Jae Sung Lee
Abstract: We investigate the kinetic uncertainty relation (KUR)-a fundamental trade-off between dynamical activity and current fluctuations-in two configurations of a maser heat engine. We find that KUR violations arise only in one model. This asymmetry originates from spontaneous emission, which breaks the structural symmetry between the configurations and modifies their coherence dynamics. While we analyze several contributing factors-including statistical signatures such as the Fano factor and the ratio of dynamical activity to current-our results show that the decisive mechanism is the slower decoherence in one configuration, which enables quantum violations of the classical steady-state KUR bound. By contrast, the faster coherence decay in the other configuration suppresses such violations, driving it closer to classical behavior. These findings highlight the critical role of decoherence mechanisms in determining fundamental thermodynamic bounds and provide insights for the design of quantum heat engines in which the control of decoherence is central to suppressing fluctuations and enhancing reliable performance.

Title: Polarization dynamics of the spin-boson model in the shifted boson Hilbert space
Authors: Yang Zhao, Lipeng Chen
Abstract: Faithfully simulating the dynamics of open quantum systems requires efficiently addressing the challenge of an infinite Hilbert space. Inspired by the shifted boson operator technique used in ground-state studies of the spin-boson model (SBM), we develop a novel algorithm that integrates a shifted optimized boson basis with the time-evolving block decimation method. We validate our approach by accurately reproducing the polarization dynamics of the sub-Ohmic SBM at a significantly reduced computational cost. For the Ohmic SBM, we demonstrate that the time-evolved final state converges precisely to the variational prediction at both zero and finite temperatures. Furthermore, our method reveals a new aperiodic pseudocoherent phase in the super-Ohmic SBM with an initially polarized bath. This work establishes an efficient and powerful approach for simulating the real-time dynamics of open quantum systems.

Title: Dynamics of fixation probability in a population with fluctuating size
Authors: Kavita Jain, Hitesh Sumuni
Abstract: In many biological processes, the size of a population changes stochastically with time, and recent work in the context of cancer and bacterial growth have focused on the situation when the mean population size grows exponentially. Here, motivated by the evolutionary process of genetic hitchhiking in a selectively neutral population, we consider a model in which the mean size of the population increases linearly. We are interested in understanding how the fluctuations in the population size impact the first passage statistics, and study the fixation probability that a mutant reaches frequency one by a given time in a population whose size follows a conditional Wright-Fisher process. We find that at sufficiently short and long times, the fixation probability can be approximated by a model that ignores temporal correlations between the inverse of the population size, but at intermediate times, it is significantly smaller than that obtained by neglecting the correlations. Our analytical and numerical study of the correlation functions show that the conditional Wright-Fisher process of interest is neither a stationary nor a Gaussian process; we also find that the variance of the inverse population size initially increases linearly with time $t$ and then decreases as $t^{-2}$ at intermediate times followed by an exponential decay at longer times. Our work emphasizes the importance of temporal correlations in populations with fluctuating size that are often ignored in population-genetic studies of biological evolution.

Title: Quantum Mpemba Effect in Dissipative Spin Chains at Criticality
Authors: Zijun Wei, Mingdi Xu, Xiang-Ping Jiang, Lei Pan
Abstract: The Quantum Mpemba Effect (QME) is the quantum counterpart of the classical Mpemba effect--a counterintuitive phenomenon in which a system initially at a higher temperature relax to thermal eauilibrium faster than one at a lower temperature. In this work, we investigate the QME in one-dimensional quantum spin chains coupled to a Markovian environment. By analyzing the full relaxation dynamics governed by the Lindblad master equation, we reveal the emergence of a strong quantum Mpemba effect at quantum critical points. Our findings reveal that criticality enhances the non-monotonic dependence of relaxation times on the initial temperature, leading to anomalously accelerated equilibration. This phenomenon is directly linked to the structure of the Liouvillian spectrum at criticality and the associated overlaps with the initial states. These findings demonstrate that quantum phase transitions could provide a natural setting for realizing and enhancing non-equilibrium phenomena in open quantum systems.

Title: The GINN framework: a stochastic QED correspondence for stability and chaos in deep neural networks
Authors: Rodrigo Carmo Terin
Abstract: The development of a Euclidean stochastic field-theoretic approach that maps deep neural networks (DNNs) to quantum electrodynamics (QED) with local U(1) symmetry is presented. Neural activations and weights are represented by fermionic matter and gauge fields, with a fictitious Langevin time enabling covariant gauge fixing. This mapping identifies the gauge parameter with kernel design choices in wide DNNs, relating stability thresholds to gauge-dependent amplification factors. Finite-width fluctuations correspond to loop corrections in QED. As a proof of concept, we validate the theoretical predictions through numerical simulations of standard multilayer perceptrons and, in parallel, propose a gauge-invariant neural network (GINN) implementation using magnitude--phase parameterization of weights. Finally, a double-copy replica approach is shown to unify the computation of the largest Lyapunov exponent in stochastic QED and wide DNNs.

Title: On the Slipperiness of Surfactants: Charge-Mediated Friction Control at the Molecular Scale
Authors: Kaili Xie, Julie Jagielka, Liang Peng, Yu Han, Yedam Lee, Steve Franklin, Yongkang Wang, Arsh Hazrah, Mischa Bonn, Joshua Dijksman, Daniel Bonn
Abstract: From soap-covered dishes to freshly cleaned floors, surfactants can make surfaces slippery; yet, the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. Here, we identify the molecular origin behind this ubiquitous phenomenon using macroscopic tribology and surface molecular spectroscopy. We demonstrate that reducing friction through surfactants hinges on charge complementarity: surfactants of opposite charge to the solid surface reduce friction even at extreme contact pressures, whereas like-charged or neutral surfactants are ineffective. Oppositely charged surfactants self-assemble into dense and robust molecular brushes, creating a persistent lubrication beyond the limits of conventional mechanisms. This charge-mediated approach offers a universal and scalable framework for friction control across length scales without significant surface modification.

Title: Numerical Integration of stochastic differential equations: The Heun Algorithm Revisited and It√¥-Stratonovich Calculus
Authors: Riccardo Mannella
Abstract: The widely used Heun algorithm for the numerical integration of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) is critically re-examined. We discuss and evaluate several alternative implementations, motivated by the fact that the standard Heun scheme is constructed from a low-order integrator. The convergence, stability, and equilibrium properties of these alternatives are assessed through extensive numerical simulations. Our results confirm that the standard Heun scheme remains a benchmark integration algorithm for SDEs due to its robust performance. As a byproduct of this analysis, we also disprove a previous claim in the literature regarding the strong convergence of the Heun scheme.

Title: Universal Dynamics with Globally Controlled Analog Quantum Simulators
Authors: Hong-Ye Hu, Abigail McClain Gomez, Liyuan Chen, Aaron Trowbridge, Andy J. Goldschmidt, Zachary Manchester, Frederic T. Chong, Arthur Jaffe, Susanne F. Yelin
Abstract: Analog quantum simulators with global control fields have emerged as powerful platforms for exploring complex quantum phenomena. Recent breakthroughs, such as the coherent control of thousands of atoms, highlight the growing potential for quantum applications at scale. Despite these advances, a fundamental theoretical question remains unresolved: to what extent can such systems realize universal quantum dynamics under global control? Here we establish a necessary and sufficient condition for universal quantum computation using only global pulse control, proving that a broad class of analog quantum simulators is, in fact, universal. We further extend this framework to fermionic and bosonic systems, including modern platforms such as ultracold atoms in optical superlattices. Crucially, to connect the theoretical possibility with experimental reality, we introduce a new control technique into the experiment - direct quantum optimal control. This method enables the synthesis of complex effective Hamiltonians and allows us to incorporate realistic hardware constraints. To show its practical power, we experimentally engineer three-body interactions outside the blockade regime and demonstrate topological dynamics on a Rydberg atom array. Using the new control framework, we overcome key experimental challenges, including hardware limitations and atom position fluctuations in the non-blockade regime, by identifying smooth, short-duration pulses that achieve high-fidelity dynamics. Experimental measurements reveal dynamical signatures of symmetry-protected-topological edge modes, confirming both the expressivity and feasibility of our approach. Our work opens a new avenue for quantum simulation beyond native hardware Hamiltonians, enabling the engineering of effective multi-body interactions and advancing the frontier of quantum information processing with globally-controlled analog platforms.

Title: Ab-initio Quantum Transport with the GW Approximation, 42,240 Atoms, and Sustained Exascale Performance
Authors: Nicolas Vetsch, Alexander Maeder, Vincent Maillou, Anders Winka, Jiang Cao, Grzegorz Kwasniewski, Leonard Deuschle, Torsten Hoefler, Alexandros Nikolaos Ziogas, Mathieu Luisier
Abstract: Designing nanoscale electronic devices such as the currently manufactured nanoribbon field-effect transistors (NRFETs) requires advanced modeling tools capturing all relevant quantum mechanical effects. State-of-the-art approaches combine the non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) formalism and density functional theory (DFT). However, as device dimensions do not exceed a few nanometers anymore, electrons are confined in ultra-small volumes, giving rise to strong electron-electron interactions. To account for these critical effects, DFT+NEGF solvers should be extended with the GW approximation, which massively increases their computational intensity. Here, we present the first implementation of the NEGF+GW scheme capable of handling NRFET geometries with dimensions comparable to experiments. This package, called QuaTrEx, makes use of a novel spatial domain decomposition scheme, can treat devices made of up to 84,480 atoms, scales very well on the Alps and Frontier supercomputers (>80% weak scaling efficiency), and sustains an exascale FP64 performance on 42,240 atoms (1.15 Eflop/s).

Title: Saddle Hierarchy in Dense Associative Memory
Authors: Robin Th√©riault, Daniele Tantari
Abstract: Dense associative memory (DAM) models have been attracting renewed attention since they were shown to be robust to adversarial examples and closely related to state-of-the-art machine learning paradigms, such as the attention mechanisms in transformers and generative diffusion models. We study a DAM built upon a three-layer Boltzmann machine with Potts hidden units, which represent data clusters and classes. Through a statistical mechanics analysis, we derive saddle-point equations that characterize both the stationary points of DAMs trained on real data and the fixed points of DAMs trained on synthetic data within a teacher-student framework. Based on these results, we propose a novel regularization scheme that makes training significantly more stable. Moreover, we show empirically that our DAM learns interpretable solutions to both supervised and unsupervised classification problems. Pushing our theoretical analysis further, we find that the weights learned by relatively small DAMs correspond to unstable saddle points in larger DAMs. We implement a network-growing algorithm that leverages this saddle-point hierarchy to drastically reduce the computational cost of training dense associative memory.

Title: A microfluidic band-pass filter for flexible fiber separation
Authors: Li Zhibo, Bielinski Cl√©ment, Lindner Anke, Delmotte Blaise, du Roure Olivia
Abstract: The control of particle trajectories in structured microfluidic environments has significantly advanced sorting technologies, most notably through deterministic lateral displacement (DLD). While previous work has largely targeted rigid, near-spherical particles, the sorting of flexible, anisotropic objects such as fibers remains largely unexplored. Here, we combine experiments and simulations to demonstrate how tilted pillar arrays enable efficient, length-based separation of flexible fibers. We discover that these arrays act as band-pass filters, selectively inducing lateral migration in fibers whose lengths are close to the array period. Fibers significantly shorter or longer exhibit minimal lateral deviation. This migration arises from the interplay of fluid-structure interactions between fibers and the complex flow and steric interactions with the pillars. Depending on their length, fibers exhibit distinct transport regimes: short fibers zigzag in between pillars following the flow, intermediate length fibers exhibit wrapping and jumping from one pillar to another, leading to lateral displacement, and long fibers deform extensively, following mixed zigzag-jump trajectories with minimal lateral migration. We identify the mechanical tension that develops in the fiber when wrapped around the pillars as the driving mechanism of cross-streamline transport. Leveraging this band-pass effect, we designed a highly efficient separation device to collect monodisperse fiber suspensions. Our findings not only expand the functional scope of DLD-like systems but also open new avenues for understanding transport of anisotropic objects in porous media.

Title: Temperature dependence in Krylov space
Authors: Nikolaos Angelinos, Debarghya Chakraborty, Anatoly Dymarsky
Abstract: We consider the recursion method applied to a generic 2pt function of a quantum system and show, in full generality, that the temperature dependence of the corresponding Lanczos coefficients is governed by integrable dynamics. After an appropriate change of variables, Lanczos coefficients with even and odd indices are described by two independent Toda chains, related at the level of the initial conditions. Consistency of the resulting equations can be used to show that certain scale-invariant models necessarily have a degenerate spectrum. We dub this self-consistency-based approach the ''Krylov bootstrap''. The known analytic behavior of the Toda chain at late times translates into analytic control over the 2pt function and Krylov complexity at very low temperatures. We also discuss the behavior of Lanczos coefficients when the temperature is low but not much smaller than the spectral gap, and elucidate the origin of the staggering behavior of Lanczos coefficients in this regime.

Title: New Twists on Topological Quantum Error Correcting Codes
Authors: Mohamad Mousa, Amit Jamadagni, Eugene Dumitrescu
Abstract: We derive a new family of quantum error-correcting codes. The main technical tool used to do so is the physically intuitive concept of condensation, which is employed to create new domain walls between the quantum double of $\Z_4$ and an instance of the doubled semion phase. Specifically, we provide explicit constructions, first at the lattice-level and then subsequently at the macroscopic logical-level. To provide intuition, we provide a series of explicit examples using the derived topological interfaces. We discuss the code's utility in the burgeoning area of quantum error-correction with an emphasis on the interplay between logical error rates and decoding. We conclude by outlining how such codes' representation and design can be automated. We expect our results, which provide explicit step-by-step instructions in the form of algorithms, to pave the path for new higher-algebraic-dimensional codes to be discovered and implemented in configurations that take advantage of various hardware's distinct strengths.

Title: Geometric Study on Canonical Nonlinearity for FCC-based Binary Alloys
Authors: Koretaka Yuge, Ikumi Nishihara
Abstract: For classical discrete systems under constant composition (typically reffered to as substitutional alloys), canonical average can act as a map from a set of many-body interatomic interactions to that of configuration in thermodynamic equilibrium, the so-called canonical nonlinearity: CN, which generally exhibits complicated nonlinearity. Whereas our recent study reveals that the CN can be reasonablly addressed for individual microscopic configuration by two different measures of special vector field on configuration space2,3 and Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence DKL, their direct correlation on real lattices, is still unclear. We here address this problem for fcc-based equiatomic binary alloys that have been one of the most studied system in the context of CN. We confirm that while local contribution to CN from DKL for each configuration exhibits strong, positive correlation with the vector field, non-local contribution from DKL exhibit no effective correlation. We find that depedence of the averaged non-local nonlinearity over all configurations can be well-characterized by normalied geometric distance in configurational polyhedra between for practical and separable system in terms of the structural degrees of freedom. This fact certainly indicates that non-local nonlinearity has profound connection to the geometric configuration for ground-state structures of alloys on configuration space.

Title: Superconductivity from incoherent Cooper pairs in the strong-coupling regime
Authors: A. A. Zyuzin, A. Yu. Zyuzin
Abstract: We propose a scenario for superconductivity at strong electron-electron attractive interaction, in the case when the increase of the interaction strength promotes the nucleation of the local Cooper pairs and forms a state with a spatially phase incoherent Cooper pair order parameter. We show that this state can be characterized by a pseudogap which is determined by the electron scattering by phase fluctuations. At low temperatures, however, long-range correlations between the regions with different phases become important and establish global phase coherence and hence superconductivity in the system. We develop a mean-field theory to describe a phase transition between the preformed Cooper pair and superconducting states. This scenario of superconductivity applies not only to conductors with parabolic bands but also to the flat-band systems in which flat and dispersive bands coexist and are responsible for the formation of Cooper pairs as well as their phase synchronization.

Title: Enhanced superconductivity in PbTe-In hybrids
Authors: Zuhan Geng, Fangting Chen, Yichun Gao, Lining Yang, Yuhao Wang, Shuai Yang, Shan Zhang, Zonglin Li, Wenyu Song, Jiaye Xu, Zehao Yu, Ruidong Li, Zhaoyu Wang, Xiao Feng, Tiantian Wang, Yunyi Zang, Lin Li, Runan Shang, Qi-Kun Xue, Ke He, Hao Zhang
Abstract: We report the realization of epitaxial indium thin films on PbTe nanowires. The film is continuous and forms an atomically sharp interface with PbTe. Tunneling devices reveal a hard superconducting gap. The gap size, 1.08 to 1.18 meV, is twice as large as bulk indium's ($\sim$ 0.5 meV), due to the presence of PbTe. A similar enhancement is also observed in the critical temperature of In on a PbTe substrate. Subgap peaks appear at finite magnetic fields. The effective $g$-factor (15-45) is notably enhanced compared to bare PbTe wires ($<$ 10) due to the presence of In, differing from Al-hybrids. Josephson devices exhibit gate-tunable supercurrents. The PbTe-In hybrid enhances the properties of both, the superconductivity of In and g-factors of PbTe, and thus may enable exotic phases of matter such as topological superconductivity.

Title: Point defect design in (Ba,Sr)TiO$_3$ -- new insights on agglomeration
Authors: Sheng-Han Teng, Anna Gr√ºnebohm
Abstract: Functional properties of ferroelectrics and their change with time depend crucially on the defect structure. In particular, point defects and bias fields induced by defect dipoles modify the field hysteresis and play an important role in fatigue and aging. However, a full understanding on how order, agglomeration and strength of defect dipoles affect phase stability and functional properties is still lacking. To close these gaps in knowledge, we screen these parameters by \textit{ab\ initio} based molecular dynamics simulations with the effective Hamiltonian method for the prototypical ferroelectric material (Ba,Sr)TiO$_3$. Our findings suggest that the {\it{active surface area}} of the defects, rather than the defect concentration is the decisive factor. For a fixed defect concentration, clustering reduces the {\it{active surface area}} and thus the defect-induced changes of phase stability and field hysteresis. Particularly planar agglomerates of defects appear as promising route for the material design as their impact on the field hysteresis can be controlled by the field direction and as their impact on the phase stability shows a cross-over with the strength of the defect dipoles. For this agglomeration, we show that the recoverable stored energy can outperform the response of pristine (Ba,Sr)TiO$_3$ even in its paraelectric phase due to a pinched double-loop field hysteresis.

Title: Interlayer Exchange Coupling-Induced Critical-Metal-to-Insulator Phase Transition in Quantum Anomalous Hall Insulators
Authors: Ruoxi Zhang, Yi-Fan Zhao, Ling-Jie Zhou, Deyi Zhuo, Zi-Jie Yan, Chao-Xing Liu, Moses H. W. Chan, Chui-Zhen Chen, Cui-Zu Chang
Abstract: Interlayer exchange coupling (IEC) between two magnetic layers sandwiched by a nonmagnetic spacer layer plays a critical role in shaping the magnetic properties of such heterostructures. The quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect has been realized in a structure composed of two magnetically doped topological insulator (TI) layers separated by an undoped TI layer. In this work, we employ molecular beam epitaxy to synthesize a series of magnetic TI sandwiches with varying thicknesses of the middle TI spacer layer. The well-quantized QAH effect is observed in all these samples, and the IEC modulates its critical behavior between the top and bottom magnetic TI layers. Near the plateau phase transition (PPT), thinner QAH samples exhibit a two-dimensional critical metal behavior with nearly temperature-independent longitudinal resistance. In contrast, thicker QAH samples behave as a three-dimensional insulator with reduced longitudinal resistance at higher temperatures. We employ a magnetic TI Hamiltonian with random magnetic domains to understand the IEC-induced critical-metal-to-insulator transition observed near QAH PPT.

Title: Toward improved property prediction of 2D materials using many-body quantum Monte Carlo methods

Abstract: The field of two-dimensional (2D) materials has grown dramatically in the last two decades. 2D materials can be utilized for a variety of next-generation optoelectronic, spintronic, clean energy, and quantum computation applications. These 2D structures, which are often exfoliated from layered van der Waals (vdW) materials, possess highly inhomogeneous electron densities and can possess short- and long-range electron correlations. The complexities of 2D materials make them challenging to study with standard mean-field electronic structure methods such as density functional theory (DFT), which relies on approximations for the unknown exchange-correlation functional. In order to overcome the limitations of DFT, highly accurate many-body electronic structure approaches such as Diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) can be utilized. In the past decade, DMC has been used to calculate accurate magnetic, electronic, excitonic, and topological properties in addition to accurately capturing interlayer interactions and cohesion and adsorption energetics of 2D materials. This approach has been applied to 2D systems of wide interest including graphene, phosphorene, MoS$_2$, CrI$_3$, VSe$_2$, GaSe, GeSe, borophene, and several others. In this review article, we highlight some successful recent applications of DMC to 2D systems for improved property predictions beyond standard DFT.

Title: Microbiomes Through The Looking Glass: Linking species interactions to dysbiosis through a disordered Lotka-Volterra framework
Authors: Jacopo Pasqualini, Amos Maritan, Andrea Rinaldo, Sonia Facchin, Edoardo Savarino, Ada Altieri, Samir Suweis
Abstract: The rapid advancement of environmental sequencing technologies, such as metagenomics, has significantly enhanced our ability to study microbial communities. The eubiotic composition of these communities is crucial for maintaining ecological functions and host health. Species diversity is only one facet of a healthy community organization; together with abundance distributions and interaction structures, it shapes reproducible macroecological states, i.e., joint statistical fingerprints that summarize whole-community behavior. Despite recent developments, a theoretical framework connecting empirical data with ecosystem modeling is still in its infancy, particularly in the context of disordered systems. Here, we present a novel framework that couples statistical physics tools for disordered systems with metagenomic data, explicitly linking diversity, interactions, and stability to define and compare these macroecological states. By employing the generalized Lotka-Volterra model with random interactions, we reveal two different emergent patterns of species interaction networks and species abundance distributions for healthy and diseased microbiomes. On the one hand, healthy microbiomes have similar community structures across individuals, characterized by strong species interactions and abundance diversity consistent with neutral stochastic fluctuations. On the other hand, diseased microbiomes show greater variability driven by deterministic factors, thus resulting in less ecologically stable and more divergent communities. Our findings suggest the potential of disordered system theory to characterize microbiomes and to capture the role of ecological interactions on stability and functioning.

Title: Localized states, topology and anomalous Hall conductivity on a 30 degrees twisted bilayer honeycomb lattice
Authors: Grigory Bednik
Abstract: We consider $30^{\circ}$ twisted bilayer formed by two copies of Haldane model and explore its evolution with varying interlayer coupling strength. Specifically, we compute the system's energy spectrum, its fractal dimensions, topological entanglement entropy, local Chern markers and anomalous Hall conductivity. We find that at weak interlayer coupling, the system %remains gapped still has a bulk energy gap, topological edge states and retains topological properties of the isolated layers, but at strong interlayer coupling, this energy gap closes, but it is possible that another bulk gap may open. Such a system possesses multiple states localized at various locations of the lattice. We also establish that topological entanglement entropy and anomalous Hall conductivity can be used to characterize the system's topological properties in the same way as a local Chern marker.

Title: Long-time divergences in the nonlinear response of gapped one-dimensional many-particle systems
Authors: M. Fava, S. Gopalakrishnan, R. Vasseur, S. A. Parameswaran, F. H. L. Essler
Abstract: We consider one dimensional many-particle systems that exhibit kinematically protected single-particle excitations over their ground states. We show that momentum and time-resolved 4-point functions of operators that create such excitations diverge linearly in particular time differences. This behaviour can be understood by means of a simple semiclassical analysis based on the kinematics and scattering of wave packets of quasiparticles. We verify that our wave packet analysis correctly predicts the long-time limit of the four-point function in the transverse field Ising model through a form factor expansion. We present evidence in favour of the same behaviour in integrable quantum field theories. In addition, we extend our discussion to experimental protocols where two times of the four-point function coincide, e.g. 2D coherent spectroscopy and pump-probe experiments. Finally, focusing on the Ising model, we discuss subleading corrections that grow as the square root of time differences. We show that the subleading corrections can be correctly accounted for by the same semiclassical analysis, but also taking into account wave packet spreading.

Title: R√©nyi complexity in mean-field disordered systems
Authors: Nina Javerzat, Eric Bertin, Misaki Ozawa
Abstract: Configurational entropy, or complexity, plays a critical role in characterizing disordered systems such as glasses, yet its measurement often requires significant computational resources. Recently, R√©nyi entropy, a one-parameter generalization of Shannon entropy, has gained attention across various fields of physics due to its simpler functional form, making it more practical for measurements. In this paper, we compute the R√©nyi version of complexity for prototypical mean-field disordered models, including the random energy model, its generalization, referred to as the random free energy model, and the $p$-spin spherical model. We first demonstrate that the R√©nyi complexity with index $m$ is related to the free energy difference for a generalized annealed Franz-Parisi potential with $m$ clones. Detailed calculations show that for models having one-step replica symmetry breaking (RSB), the R√©nyi complexity vanishes at the Kauzmann transition temperature $T_K$, irrespective of $m>1$, while RSB solutions are required even in the liquid phase. This study strengthens the link between R√©nyi entropy and the physics of disordered systems and provides theoretical insights for its practical measurements.

Title: How glass breaks -- Damage explains the difference between surface and fracture energies in amorphous silica
Authors: Gergely Moln√°r, Etienne Barthel
Abstract: The difference between free surface energy and fracture toughness in amorphous silica is studied via multi-scale simulations. We combine the homogenization of a molecular dynamics fracture model with a phase-field approach to track and quantify the various energy contributions. We clearly separate free surface energy localized as potential energy on the surface and damage diffusion over a 16-23 A range around the crack path. The plastic contribution is negligible. These findings, which clarify brittle fracture mechanisms in amorphous materials, align with toughness measurements in silica.

Title: Exploring d-Wave Magnetism in Cuprates from Oxygen Moments
Authors: Ying Li, Valentin Leeb, Krzysztof Wohlfeld, Roser Valent√≠, Johannes Knolle
Abstract: The antiferromagnetic parent phase of high-T$_c$ cuprates has been established as a N√©el state of copper moments, but early work pointed out the important role of ligand oxygen orbitals. Using the three-orbital Emery model, we explore how, and under which conditions, doping-induced antiferromagnetic ordering of weak magnetic moments on the oxygen sites can lead to unconventional d-wave magnetism with spin-split electronic bands. The mechanism for forming such altermagnetic (AM) states in cuprates does not rely on a lowering of the crystal symmetry but rather on interaction-induced formation of magnetic moments on directional oxygen orbitals within the crystallographic unit cell. Therefore, we obtain two different types of AM, namely a (0,0)-AM and a ($\pi$,$\pi$)-AM. We explore different regimes and challenges for realizing oxygen AM supported by Hartree-Fock calculations and complementary exact diagonalization of small clusters. While the region of interacting parameters needed to realize these states may be difficult to achieve in known high-T$_c$ cuprates, we propose a scenario to realize AM induced by oxygen magnetic moments in a cuprate-based candidate compound using density functional theory and discuss experimental implications.

Title: Boundary layers, transport and universal distribution in boundary driven active systems
Authors: Pritha Dolai, Arghya Das
Abstract: We discuss analytical results for a run-and-tumble particle (RTP) in one dimension in presence of boundary reservoirs. It exhibits `kinetic boundary layers', nonmonotonous distribution, current without density gradient, diffusion facilitated current reversal and optimisation on tuning dynamical parameters, and a new transport effect in the steady state. The spatial and internal degrees of freedom together possess a symmetry, using which we find the eigenspectrum for large systems. The eigenvalues are arranged in two bands which can mix in certain conditions resulting in a crossover in the relaxation. The late time distribution for large systems is obtained analytically; it retains a strong and often dominant `active' contribution in the bulk rendering an effective passive-like description inadequate. A nontrivial `Milne length' also emerges in the dynamics. Finally, a novel universality is proposed in the absorbing boundary problem for dynamics with short-ranged colored noise. Active processes driven by active reservoirs may thus provide a common physical ground for diverse and new nonequilibrium phenomena.

Title: Phonon-mediated spin-polarized superconductivity in altermagnets
Authors: Kristoffer Leraand, Kristian M√¶land, Asle Sudb√∏
Abstract: We consider the possibility of phonon-mediated unconventional superconductivity in a recently discovered new class of antiferromagnets, dubbed altermagnets. Within a weak-coupling approach, and using a minimal Lieb lattice model for altermagnets, we find a dominant superconducting instability odd in momentum and even in spin with spin-polarized Cooper pairs. We discuss the origin of this unusual result in terms of the spin-structure of the altermagnetic Fermi surface, in combination with the momentum-space structure of the effective phonon-mediated electron-electron interactions on the Fermi surface.

Title: Topological Invariants in the Pore Morphology Method
Authors: Fernando Alonso-Marroquin
Abstract: This study introduces a pore morphology algorithm that emphasizes the central role of topology in multiphase flow through porous media. Analysis of drainage in lattice-based pore networks identifies two key quantities, the percolation threshold and residual saturation, as topological invariants. These descriptors, which are based solely on connectivity rather than geometric details, capture the essential structure of the network. The percolation threshold is interpreted as a topological phase transition, marking the transition from global connectivity of the defending fluid to isolated clusters of trapped fluid. The universality of scaling exponents across different lattice geometries reveals the existence of topological universality classes, where systems with equivalent connectivity display identical critical behavior. This topological framework underscores the robustness of the identified invariants and provides a general basis for upscaling pore-scale processes in complex media.

Title: Dynamic critical exponents as an emergent property at interacting topological quantum critical points
Authors: Fan Yang, Zheng-Cheng Gu, Fei Zhou
Abstract: In standard studies of quantum critical points (QCPs), the dynamic critical exponent $z$ is introduced as a fundamental parameter along with global symmetries to identify universality classes. Often, the dynamic critical exponent $z$ is set to be one as the most natural choice for quantum field theory representations, which further implies emergence of higher space-time symmetries near QCPs in many condensed matter systems. In this article, we study a family of topological quantum critical points (tQCPs) where the $z=1$ quantum field theory is prohibited in a fundamental representation by a protecting symmetry, resulting in tQCPs with $z=2$. We further illustrate that when strong interactions are properly taken into account, the stable weakly interacting gapless tQCPs with $z=2$ can further make a transition to another family of gapless tQCPs with dynamic critical exponent $z=1$, without breaking the protecting symmetry. Our studies suggest that dynamic critical exponents, as well as the degrees of freedom in fermion fields, can crucially depend on interactions in topological quantum phase transitions; in tQCPs, to a large extent, they are better thought of as emergent properties.

Title: Graphene-hBN interlayer interactions from quantum Monte Carlo
Authors: Kittithat Krongchon, Tawfiqur Rakib, Daniel Palmer, Elif Ertekin, Harley T. Johnson, Lucas K. Wagner
Abstract: The interaction between graphene and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) plays a pivotal role in determining the electronic and structural properties of graphene-based devices. In this work, we employ quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) to study the interlayer interactions and stacking-fault energy (SFE) between graphene and hBN. We generated QMC energies for several rigid bilayer stacking configurations and fitted these data to the Kolmogorov-Crespi type interlayer potential (ILP) model. Our QMC-derived potential offers a more reliable alternative to conventional density functional theory methods, which are prone to errors in predicting properties in van der Waals materials. This study enables highly accurate predictions of structural and electronic properties in graphene hBN heterostructures. The resulting ILP-QMC potential is made available for further use in simulating complex systems, such as twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) on hBN.

Title: Enhanced shot noise in graphene quantum point contacts with electrostatic reconstruction

Abstract: Shot noise measurements in quantum point contacts are a powerful tool to investigate charge transport in the integer and fractional quantum Hall regime, in particular to unveil the charge, quantum statistics and tunneling dynamics of edge excitations. In this letter, we describe shot noise measurements in a graphene quantum point contact in the quantum Hall regime. At large magnetic field, the competition between confinement and electronic interactions gives rise to a quantum dot located at the saddle point of the quantum point contact. We show that the presence of this quantum dot leads to a $50-100~\%$ increase in the shot noise, which we attribute to correlated charge tunneling. Our results highlight the role played by the electrostatic environment in those graphene devices.

Title: Phase Transformation Kinetics Model for Metals
Authors: Daniel N. Blaschke, Abigail Hunter, Dean L. Preston
Abstract: We develop a new model for phase transformation kinetics in metals by generalizing the Levitas-Preston (LP) phase field model of martensite phase transformations (see Levitas and Preston (2002a,b); Levitas, Preston and Lee (2003)) to arbitrary pressure. Furthermore, we account for and track: the interface speed of the pressure driven phase transformation, properties of critical nuclei, as well as nucleation at grain sites and on dislocations and homogeneous nucleation. The volume fraction evolution of each phase is described by employing KJMA (Kolmogorov, 1937; Johnson and Mehl, 1939; Avrami, 1939, 1940, 1941) kinetic theory. We then test our new model for iron under ramp loading conditions and compare our predictions for the $\alpha\to\epsilon$ iron phase transition to experimental data of Smith et al. (2013). More than one combination of material and model parameters (such as dislocation density and interface speed) led to good agreement of our simulations to the experimental data, thus highlighting the importance of having accurate characterization data regarding the microstructure of the sample in question.

Title: Spin-orbit torque driven motion of chiral domain walls induced by radial magnetization in nanotube geometry
Authors: Nobuyuki Umetsu, Hiroki Tokuhira, Michael Quinsat, Hideto Horii, Tsuyoshi Kondo, Masaki Kado
Abstract: We theoretically investigate chiral domain walls (DWs) formed in radially magnetized nanotubes composed of ultrathin layers with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA). Unlike those with in-plane magnetic anisotropy, the stable configurations of DWs in PMA nanotubes are influenced not only by exchange interactions but also by magnetostatic interactions induced by the radial component of magnetization. Particularly, the magnetostatic interactions lead to Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI)-like effects that stabilize chiral N√©el-type DWs. We derive expressions for the effective magnetic fields acting on DWs within PMA nanotubes and quantify spin-orbit torque (SOT) driven DW motion using an analytical one-dimensional model, which is validated by micromagnetic simulations. Our results show that the DMI-like field due to magnetostatic interactions can be as significant as the contribution of material-induced DMI in nanotubes with diameters below $100\,$nm. This implies that the direction and speed of DW motion in the PMA nanotubes could differ from those observed in flat nanoribbons composed of the same material. Furthermore, we demonstrate that DW velocity can be effectively controlled by adjusting the tube diameter and exchange stiffness constant of the magnetic layer, rather than relying solely on material-induced DMI. These insights are expected to greatly expand the potential applications of PMA nanotube-based DW devices.

Title: Quantized resonant tunneling effect in Josephson junctions with ferromagnetic bilayers
Authors: Hao Meng, Lei Cai, Xiuqiang Wu, Xianghe Zhao, Jia Xu, Guanqi Wang
Abstract: We study the Josephson effect in one-dimensional SF$_1$F$_2$S junctions, which consist of conventional s-wave superconductors (S) connected by two ferromagnetic layers (F$_1$ and F$_2$). At low temperatures, the potential barrier at the F$_1$/F$_2$ interface can induce a quantized resonant tunneling effect. This effect not only modifies the amplitude of the critical current but also affects the phase of the Josephson current. As the exchange fields ($h_1$, $h_2$) and thicknesses ($d_1$, $d_2$) of the F$_1$ and F$_2$ layers vary, the critical current displays periodic resonance peaks. These peaks occur under the quantization conditions $Q_{1(2)} d_{1(2)} = \left(n_{1(2)} + 1/2\right) \pi$, where $Q_{1(2)} = 2h_{1(2)}/(\hbar v_F)$ is the center-of-mass momentum carried by Cooper pairs, with $v_F$ being the Fermi velocity, and $n_{1(2)} = 0, 1, 2, \cdots$. It can be inferred that the potential barrier suppresses the transport of spin-singlet pairs while allowing spin-triplet pairs with zero spin projection along the magnetization axis to pass through. As these spin-triplet pairs traverse the F$_1$ and F$_2$ layers, the total phase they acquire determines the ground state of the Josephson junction. At the resonance peaks, the Josephson current primarily arises from the first harmonic in both the parallel and antiparallel magnetization configurations. However, in perpendicular configurations, the second harmonic becomes more significant. In scenarios where both ferromagnetic layers have identical exchange fields and thicknesses, the potential barrier selectively suppresses the current in the 0-state while allowing it to persist in the $\pi$-state for parallel configurations. Conversely, in antiparallel configurations, the current in the 0-state is consistently preserved.

Title: Interlayer Coupling-Induced Quantum Phase Transition in Quantum Anomalous Hall Multilayers
Authors: Ling-Jie Zhou, Deyi Zhuo, Ruobing Mei, Yi-Fan Zhao, Kaijie Yang, Ruoxi Zhang, Zijie Yan, Han Tay, Moses H. W. Chan, Chao-Xing Liu, Cui-Zu Chang
Abstract: A quantum phase transition arises from competition between different ground states and is typically accessed by varying a single physical parameter near absolute zero temperature. The quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect with high Chern number C has recently been achieved in magnetic topological insulator (TI) multilayers. In this work, we employ molecular beam epitaxy to synthesize a series of magnetic TI penta-layers by varying the thickness of the middle magnetic TI layer, designated as m quintuple layers. Electrical transport measurements demonstrate a quantum phase transition between C = 1 and C = 2 QAH states. For m 1 and m 2, the sample exhibits the well-quantized C = 1 and C = 2 QAH states, respectively. For 1 m 2, we observe a monotonic decrease in Hall resistance from h/e2 to h/2e2 with increasing m, accompanied by a peak in the longitudinal resistance. The quantum phase transition between C = 1 and C = 2 QAH states is attributed to the weakening of the interlayer coupling between the top and the bottom C = 1 QAH layers. Our findings provide a scalable strategy for engineering QAH devices with a tunable Chern number. This approach enables precise control and enhanced functionality in chiral edge current-based electronic devices.

Title: Electromagnetic response and emergent topological orders in transition metal dichalcogenide MoTe$_2$ bilayers
Authors: Tianhong Lu, Yi-Ming Wu, Luiz H. Santos
Abstract: Twisted bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides, such as MoTe$_2$, provide a versatile platform for exploring correlated topological phases. This work investigates the interplay of perpendicular magnetic and electric fields in tuning the electronic structure and emergent topological orders of twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ (t-MoTe$_2$) across two distinct regimes: a low-twist-angle phase ($\theta\approx2.1^\circ$) hosting multiple Chern bands of identical Chern numbers per valley, and a higher-angle phase ($\theta\approx 3.89^\circ$) featuring Haldane-like bands with opposite Chern numbers. Using a continuum model incorporating moir√© potentials up to second harmonics, we compute the Hofstadter fractal spectra under applied fields, revealing Landau fan structures and magnetic-flux-dependent band topology. These fractal spectra are useful in studying emergent topological orders in terms of the composite fermion picture, where the statistical Chern-Simons flux is approximated as a uniform gauge field. We demonstrate that the system hosts both Jain-sequence fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) and non-Jain "fractal FCIs" with higher Chern numbers. The electric field suppresses composite fermion gaps and induces topological quantum phase transitions. Furthermore, our analysis extends to valley-contrasting flux attachment, proposing pathways to describe fractional quantum spin Hall states.

Title: Supersonic Flow Past an Obstacle in a Quasi-Two-Dimensional Lee-Huang-Yang Quantum Fluid
Authors: G. H. dos Santos, L. F. Calazans de Brito, A. Gammal, A. M. Kamchatnov
Abstract: A supersonic flow past an obstacle can generate a rich variety of wave excitations. This paper investigates, both analytically and numerically, two types of excitations generated by the flow of a Lee-Huang-Yang quantum fluid past an obstacle: linear radiation and oblique dark solitons. We show that wave crests of linear radiation can be accurately described by the proper modification of the Kelvin original theory, while the oblique dark soliton solution is obtained analytically by transformation of the 1D soliton solution to the obstacle's reference frame. A comparison between analytical predictions and numerical simulations demonstrates good agreement, validating our theoretical approach.

Title: Dynamic correlations of frustrated quantum spins from high-temperature expansion
Authors: Ruben Burkard, Benedikt Schneider, Bj√∂rn Sbierski
Abstract: For quantum spin systems in equilibrium, the dynamic structure factor (DSF) is among the most feature-packed experimental observables. However, from a theory perspective it is often hard to simulate in an unbiased and accurate way, especially for frustrated and high-dimensional models at intermediate temperature. To address this challenge, we compute the DSF from a dynamic extension of the high-temperature expansion to frequency moments. We focus on nearest-neighbor Heisenberg models with spin-lengths S=1/2 and 1. We provide comprehensive benchmarks and consider a variety of frustrated two- and three-dimensional antiferromagnets as applications. In particular we shed new light on the anomalous intermediate temperature regime of the S=1/2 triangular lattice model and reproduce the DSF measured recently for the S=1 pyrochlore material NaCaNi2F7. An open-source numerical implementation for arbitrary lattice geometries is also provided.

Title: Many-body localization in a quantum Ising model with the long-range interaction: Accurate determination of the transition point
Authors: Illia Lukin, Andrii Sotnikov, Alexander L. Burin
Abstract: Many-body localization (MBL) transition emerges at strong disorder in interacting systems, separating chaotic and reversible dynamics. Although the existence of MBL transition within the macroscopic limit in spin chains with a short-range interaction was proved rigorously, the transition point is not found yet because of the dramatic sensitivity of the transition point to the chain length at computationally accessible lengths, possible due to local fluctuations destroying localization. Here we investigate MBL transition in the quantum Ising model (Ising model in a transverse field) with the long-range interaction suppressing the fluctuations similarly to that for the second-order phase transitions. We estimate the MBL threshold within the logarithmic accuracy using exact results for a somewhat similar localization problem on a Bethe lattice problem and show that our expectations are fully consistent with the estimate of the transition point using exact diagonalization. In spite of unlimited growing of the critical disorder within the thermodynamic limit, this result offers the opportunity to probe the critical behavior of the system near the transition point. Moreover, the model is relevant for the wide variety of physical systems with the long-range dipole-dipole, elastic or indirect exchange interactions.

Title: High-temperature series expansion of the dynamic Matsubara spin correlator
Authors: Ruben Burkard, Benedikt Schneider, Bj√∂rn Sbierski
Abstract: The high-temperature series expansion for quantum spin models is a well-established tool to compute thermodynamic quantities and equal-time spin correlations, in particular for frustrated interactions. We extend the scope of this expansion to the dynamic Matsubara spin-spin correlator and develop an algorithm that yields exact expansion coefficients in the form of rational numbers. We focus on Heisenberg models with a single coupling constant J and spin lengths S=1/2 and 1. The expansion coefficients up to 12th order in J/T are precomputed on all possible ~10^6 graphs embeddable in arbitrary lattices and are provided under {this https URL}. This enables calculation of static momentum-resolved susceptibilities for arbitrary site-pairs or wavevectors. We test our results for the S=1/2 Heisenberg chain and on the triangular lattice model. An important application that we discuss in a companion letter is the calculation of real-frequency dynamic structure factors. This is achieved by identifying the high-frequency expansion coefficients of the Matsubara correlator with frequency moments of the spectral function.

Title: Interacting Dirac magnons in the van der Waals ferromagnet CrBr$_3$
Authors: Saikat Banerjee, Stephan Humeniuk
Abstract: We study the effects of magnon-magnon interactions in the two-dimensional van der Waals ferromagnet CrBr$_3$ focusing on its honeycomb lattice structure. Motivated by earlier theoretical predictions of temperature-induced spectral shifts and van Hove singularities in the magnon dispersion~[S. S. Pershoguba \textit{et al}., Dirac Magnons in Honeycomb Ferromagnets, \href{this https URL}{Phys. Rev. X {\textbf{8}}, 011010 (2018)}], we go beyond the commonly used thermal magnon approximation by applying second-order perturbation theory in a fully numerical framework. Our analysis uncovers significant deviations from previous analysis: in particular, the predicted singularities are absent, consistent with recent inelastic neutron scattering measurements~[S. E. Nikitin \textit{et al}., Thermal Evolution of Dirac Magnons in the Honeycomb Ferromagnet CrBr$_3$, \href{this https URL}{Phys. Rev. Lett. {\textbf{129}}, 127201 (2022)}]. Moreover, we find that the temperature dependence of the renormalized magnon spectrum exhibits a distinct $T^3$ behavior for the optical magnon branch, while retaining $T^2$ behavior for the acoustic or down magnon band. This feature sheds new light on the collective dynamics of Dirac magnons and their interactions. We further compare the honeycomb case with a triangular Bravais lattice, relevant for ferromagnetic monolayer MnBi$_2$Te$_4$, and show that both systems lack singular features while displaying quite distinct thermal trends.

Title: In-situ SHG microscopy investigation of the domain-wall-conductivity enhancement procedure in lithium niobate
Authors: Iuliia Kiseleva, Boris Koppitz, Elke Beyreuther, Matthias Roeper, Samuel D. Seddon, Lukas M. Eng
Abstract: Conductive domain walls (CDWs) in the uniaxial ferroelectric lithium niobate (LiNbO$_3$, LN) have attracted a lot of interest as potential elements in 2D nanoelectronics, due to their orders-of-magnitude larger electronic AC and DC conductivities as compared to the host material. On the way towards generating standardized CDWs into z-cut bulk LN crystals with controllable geometry and electrical properties, we have encountered setbacks recently: Although the first preparation step, i.e., the established UV-light-assisted liquid-electrode poling, reliably creates fully penetrating hexagonal domains with the DWs being aligned almost parallel to the polarization axis, the second step in the DW 'conductivity-enhancement' process through post-growth voltage ramping, resulted in randomly-shaped DWs as reflected in their different current-voltage (I-V) characteristics even after having applied the same process parameters. To clarify this phenomenon, we present here an \textit{in-situ} and time-resolved second-harmonic-generation (SHG) microscopy investigation of DW samples of different sizes, monitoring the DW evolution during that critical voltage ramping, which allowed us to reconstruct the 3D DW shapes both prior to and after the enhancement process. As a result, we are able to map the temporal changes of the local DW inclination angle $\alpha$, and to quantify the DW velocity. As a consequence, we need to re-assess and re-think the origin of the DW conductivity (DWC) in LN: The hitherto assumed simple connection between $\alpha$ and the DWC can not be generalized, since point defects accumulating along DWs act as extra sources for charge carrier trapping/release, significantly contributing to the DW current.

Title: Weyl nodes in CeRu$_4$Sn$_6$ studied by dynamical mean-field theory
Authors: Jor≈´nas Dobilas, Martin Brass, Frank T. Ebel, Silke Paschen, Karsten Held
Abstract: The heavy fermion compound CeRu$_4$Sn$_6$ was recently shown to exhibit a spontaneous nonlinear Hall effect, indicating its topological nature. This is consistent with the lack of inversion symmetry that allows for the existence of Weyl nodes. Here, we employ density functional theory combined with dynamical mean-field theory, which is state-of-the-art for strongly correlated materials, and study the topology of CeRu$_4$Sn$_6$. We find five inequivalent Weyl nodes of either type I or II, each having either eight or sixteen symmetry-related replicas. These Weyl nodes bridge the Kondo insulating gap, which is a direct but not an indirect gap. The Weyl points closest to the Fermi level are situated only 0.5 meV below it, and have a very flat dispersion. Our ab initio results establish CeRu$_4$Sn$_6$ as a model system for investigating the interplay between strong electronic correlations and nontrivial topology. These findings provide a theoretical foundation for future studies of quantum transport and interaction-driven topological phases in heavy-fermion systems.

Title: Light induced transitions of valley Chern numbers and flat bands in a non-twisted moire graphene-hexagonal boron nitride superlattice
Authors: Saud Alabdulal, Miftah Hadi Syahputra Anfa, Hocine Bahlouli, Michael Vogl
Abstract: Motivated by the rich topology and interesting quasi-band structure of twisted moire materials subjected to light, we study a non-twisted moire material under the influence of light. Our work is in part motivated by a desire to find an easier-to-synthesize platform that can help experimentally elucidate the interesting physics of moir√© materials coupled to light. Similar to twisted moire materials, we uncover rich topology and interesting band flattening effects, which we summarize in relevant plots such as a topological phase diagram. Our work demonstrates that much of the interesting phenomenology of twisted moire materials under the influence of electromagnetic waves seems to be generically present even in more experimentally accessible untwisted moire platforms, which remain highly tunable by light.

Title: Non-Fermi-liquid transport phenomena in bilayer nickelates: Impact of quasi-quantum metric
Authors: Seiichiro Onari, Daisuke Inoue, Rina Tazai, Youichi Yamakawa, Hiroshi Kontani
Abstract: Recently discovered high-$T_c$ superconductivity in thin-film bilayer nickelates La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under ambient pressure has attracted great interest. Non-Fermi-liquid transport behaviors, such as $T$-linear resistivity and positive Hall coefficient increasing at low temperatures, have been reported in this system. In this study, we analyze the non-Fermi-liquid transport phenomena in the thin-film bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ using a multiorbital tight-binding model. In La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, the orbital-selective cold spots composed of Ni $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital emerge since the spin fluctuations cause stronger quasi-particle damping $\gamma$ in the Ni $d_{z^2}$ orbital. Notably, in the present study, we derive a rigorous formula for the Hall coefficient $R_H$ incorporating the $\gamma$ in the quasi-quantum metric (qQM) term. We discover that the $T$-dependence of $\gamma$ in the qQM term is important in determining $R_H$, and that the qQM term is inevitably enhanced by the nearly degenerate bands at the orbital-selective cold spots located around $(\pi/4,\pi/4)$. Moreover, the qQM term plays an essential role in describing the Nernst coefficient and other transport phenomena involving the second derivative velocity $v^{\mu\nu}$. La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ provides a novel platform for exploring the physics of the qQM.

Title: Tailoring 4H-SiC Surface Electronic States by Atomic-Layer Deposition for Ideal Peta-Ohm Resistors
Authors: Yuying Xi, Helios Y. Li, Guohui Li, Qingmei Su, Kaili Mao, Bingshe Xu, Yuying Hao, Nicholas X. Fang, Yanxia Cui
Abstract: High resolution resistors capable of detecting minuscule currents are vital for advanced sensors, but existing off-shelf models struggle with inconsistent resistance under varying voltages. The underlying physics of this issue is rooted in unstable surface charges and intrinsic inhomogeneity of surface potential caused by spontaneous polarization (SP) in commercial semi-insulating silicon carbide (SiC) devices. In this work, we found that coating SiC surfaces with an ultrathin zinc oxide layer immobilizes the dangling surface charges in place and balances the natural electric field of the material, ensuring stable resistance even at extreme voltages up to 1000 V. The resulting SiC resistor maintains a record-high resistance of one peta-ohm (10^15 {\Omega}) with negligible voltage fluctuations, outperforming conventional options. Additionally, these devices can switch states when exposed to light or heat, making them dual-purpose tools for ultra-sensitive measurements and sensors. This breakthrough combines high stability, scalability for mass production, and multifunctionality, opening doors to next-generation precision technologies in fields like quantum sensing and environmental monitoring.

Title: Fractal decompositions and tensor network representations of Bethe wavefunctions
Authors: Subhayan Sahu, Guifre Vidal
Abstract: We investigate the entanglement structure of a generic $M$-particle Bethe wavefunction (not necessarily an eigenstate of an integrable model) on a 1d lattice by dividing the lattice into $L$ parts and decomposing the wavefunction into a sum of products of $L$ local wavefunctions. Using the fact that a Bethe wavefunction accepts a \textit{fractal} multipartite decomposition -- it can always be written as a linear combination of $L^M$ products of $L$ local wavefunctions, where each local wavefunction is in turn also a Bethe wavefunction -- we then build \textit{exact, analytical} tensor network representations with finite bond dimension $\chi=2^M$, for a generic planar tree tensor network (TTN), which includes a matrix product states (MPS) and a regular binary TTN as prominent particular cases. For a regular binary tree, the network has depth $\log_{2}(N/M)$ and can be transformed into an adaptive quantum circuit of the same depth, composed of unitary gates acting on $2^M$-dimensional qudits and mid-circuit measurements, that deterministically prepares the Bethe wavefunction. Finally, we put forward a much larger class of \textit{generalized} Bethe wavefunctions, for which the above decompositions, tensor network and quantum circuit representations are also possible.

Title: Squeezing generation crossing a mean-field critical point: Work statistics, irreversibility and critical fingerprints
Authors: Fernando J. G√≥mez-Ruiz, Stefano Gherardini, Ricardo Puebla
Abstract: Understanding the dynamical consequences of quantum phase transitions on thermodynamical quantities, such as work statistics and entropy production, is one of the most intriguing aspect of quantum many-body systems, pinpointing the emergence of irreversibility to critical features. In this work, we investigate the critical fingerprints appearing in these key thermodynamical quantities for a mean-field critical system undergoing a finite-time cycle, starting from a thermal state at a generic inverse temperature. In contrast to non-zero dimensional many-body systems, the presence of a mean-field critical point in a finite-time cycle leads to constant irreversible work even in the limit of infinitely slow driving. This links with the fact that a slow finite-time cycle results in a constant amount of squeezing, which enables us to derive analytical expressions for the work statistics and irreversible entropy, depending solely on the mean-field critical exponents and the functional form of the control parameter near the critical point. We find that the probability of observing negative work values, corresponding to negative irreversible entropy, is inversely proportional to the time the system remains near to the critical point, and this trend becomes less pronounced the lower the temperature of the initial thermal state. Finally, we determine the irreversibility traits under squeezing generation at zero-temperature using the relative entropy of coherence.

Title: UniGenX: a unified generative foundation model that couples sequence, structure and function to accelerate scientific design across proteins, molecules and materials
Authors: Gongbo Zhang, Yanting Li, Renqian Luo, Pipi Hu, Yang Yang, Zeru Zhao, Lingbo Li, Guoqing Liu, Zun Wang, Ran Bi, Kaiyuan Gao, Liya Guo, Yu Xie, Chang Liu, Jia Zhang, Tian Xie, Robert Pinsler, Claudio Zeni, Ziheng Lu, Hongxia Hao, Yingce Xia, Marwin Segler, Maik Riechert, Wei Yang, Hao Jiang, Wen-Bin Zhang, Zhijun Zeng, Yi Zhu, Li Dong, Xiuyuan Hu, Li Yuan, Lei Chen, Haiguang Liu, Tao Qin
Abstract: Function in natural systems arises from one-dimensional sequences forming three-dimensional structures with specific properties. However, current generative models suffer from critical limitations: training objectives seldom target function directly, discrete sequences and continuous coordinates are optimized in isolation, and conformational ensembles are under-modeled. We present UniGenX, a unified generative foundation model that addresses these gaps by co-generating sequences and coordinates under direct functional and property objectives across proteins, molecules, and materials. UniGenX represents heterogeneous inputs as a mixed stream of symbolic and numeric tokens, where a decoder-only autoregressive transformer provides global context and a conditional diffusion head generates numeric fields steered by task-specific tokens. Besides the new high SOTAs on structure prediction tasks, the model demonstrates state-of-the-art or competitive performance for the function-aware generation across domains: in materials, it achieves "conflicted" multi-property conditional generation, yielding 436 crystal candidates meeting triple constraints, including 11 with novel compositions; in chemistry, it sets new benchmarks on five property targets and conformer ensemble generation on GEOM; and in biology, it improves success in modeling protein induced fit (RMSD < 2 √Ö) by over 23-fold and enhances EC-conditioned enzyme design. Ablation studies and cross-domain transfer substantiate the benefits of joint discrete-continuous training, establishing UniGenX as a significant advance from prediction to controllable, function-aware generation.

Title: Eigen-SNAP gate for photonic qubits in a cavity-transmon system
Authors: Marcus Meschede, Ludwig Mathey
Abstract: In the pursuit of robust quantum computing, we put forth a platform based on photonic qubits in a circuit-QED environment. Specifically, we propose a versatile two-qubit gate based on two cavities coupled via a transmon, constituting a selective number-dependent phase gate operating on the in-phase eigenmodes of the two cavities, the Eigen-SNAP gate. This gate natively operates in the dispersive coupling regime of the cavities and the transmon, and operates by driving the transmon externally, to imprint desired phases on the number states. As an example for the utility of the Eigen-SNAP gate, we implement a $\sqrt{\text{SWAP}}$ gate on a system of two logical bosonic qubits encoded in the cavities. Further, we use numerical optimization to determine the optimal implementation of the $\sqrt{\text{SWAP}}$. We find that the fidelities of these optimal protocols are only limited by the coherence times of the system's components. These findings pave the way to continuous variable quantum computing in cavity-transmon systems.

Title: Spectral densities of a dispersive dielectric sphere in the modified Langevin noise formalism
Authors: Giovanni Miano, Loris Maria Cangemi, Carlo Forestiere
Abstract: This paper deals with the spectral densities of a dispersive dielectric object in the framework of macroscopic quantum electrodynamics based on the modified Langevin noise formalism. In this formalism, the electromagnetic field in the presence of a dielectric object has two contributions, one taking into account the polarization current fluctuations of the object and the other taking into account the vacuum field fluctuations scattered by the object. The combined effect of these fields on the dynamics of a quantum emitter is described via two independent continuous bosonic reservoirs, a medium-assisted reservoir and a scattering-assisted reservoir, each characterized by its own spectral density and initial quantum state. For initial thermal states of the two reservoirs at different temperatures, the standard approach based on the knowledge of the dyadic Green function of the dielectric object at the quantum emitter position cannot be employed. We map the two reservoirs to a single equivalent reservoir with a temperature-dependent effective spectral density and initially in its vacuum state, focusing on the case of a homogeneous dielectric sphere. We derive analytical expressions for the medium-assisted, scattering-assisted, and effective spectral densities in this setting. We then study the dynamics of the quantum emitter for initial thermal states of the two reservoirs, adopting a non-perturbative approach.

Title: Integrals of motion as slow modes in dissipative many-body operator dynamics
Authors: Tian-Hua Yang, Dmitry A. Abanin
Abstract: We consider Lindbladian operator dynamics in many-body quantum systems with one or more integrals of motion (IOM), subject to weak local dissipation. We demonstrate that IOMs with small support become slow modes of these dynamics, in the sense that their Frobenius norm decays more slowly compared to generic operators. As a result, the eigenoperators of such Lindbladians with slowest decay rates have a large overlap with the IOMs of the underlying Hamiltonian. We demonstrate this correspondence between slow modes and IOMs numerically for a number of many-body models, and further corroborate it with perturbative arguments. These results open up a new method for the identification of IOMs, and provide insights into the dissipative many-body dynamics.

Title: Time-bin encoded quantum key distribution over 120 km with a telecom quantum dot source

Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) with deterministic single photon sources has been demonstrated over intercity fiber and free-space channels. The previous implementations relied mainly on polarization encoding schemes, which are susceptible to birefringence, polarization-mode dispersion and polarization-dependent loss in practical fiber networks. In contrast, time-bin encoding offers inherent robustness and has been widely adopted in mature QKD systems using weak coherent laser pulses. However, its feasibility in conjunction with a deterministic single-photon source has not yet been experimentally demonstrated. In this work, we construct a time-bin encoded QKD system employing a high-brightness quantum dot (QD) single-photon source operating at telecom wavelength. Our proof-of-concept experiment successfully demonstrates the possibility of secure key distribution over fiber link of 120 km, while maintaining extraordinary long-term stability over 6 hours of continuous operation. This work provides the first experimental validation of integrating a quantum dot single-photon source with time-bin encoding in a telecom-band QKD system. In addition, it demonstrates the highest secure key rate among the time-bin QKDs based on single-photon sources. This development signifies a substantial advancement in the establishment of a robust and scalable QKD network based on solid-state single-photon technology

Title: Local Learning Rules for Out-of-Equilibrium Physical Generative Models
Authors: Cyrill B√∂sch, Geoffrey Roeder, Marc Serra-Garcia, Ryan P. Adams
Abstract: We show that the out-of-equilibrium driving protocol of score-based generative models (SGMs) can be learned via local learning rules. The gradient with respect to the parameters of the driving protocol is computed directly from force measurements or from observed system dynamics. As a demonstration, we implement an SGM in a network of driven, nonlinear, overdamped oscillators coupled to a thermal bath. We first apply it to the problem of sampling from a mixture of two Gaussians in 2D. Finally, we train a 12x12 oscillator network on the MNIST dataset to generate images of handwritten digits 0 and 1.

Title: Competing edge and bulk localisation in non-reciprocal disordered systems
Authors: Habib Ammari, Silvio Barandun, Clemens Thalhammer, Alexander Uhlmann
Abstract: We investigate the competing mechanisms of localisation in one-dimensional block disordered subwavelength resonator systems subject to non-reciprocal damping, induced by an imaginary gauge potential. Using a symmetrisation approach to enable the adaptation of tools from Hermitian systems, we derive the limiting spectral distribution of these systems as the number of blocks goes to infinity and characterise their spectral properties in terms of the spectral properties of their constituent blocks. By employing a transfer matrix approach, we then clarify, in terms of Lyapunov exponents, the competition between the edge localisation due to imaginary gauge potentials and the bulk localisation due to disorder. In particular, we demonstrate how the disorder acts as insulation against the non-Hermitian skin effect, preventing edge localisation for small imaginary gauge potentials.
