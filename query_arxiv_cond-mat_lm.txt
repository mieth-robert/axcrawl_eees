Title: Two-Dimensional Active Brownian Particles Crossing a Parabolic Barrier: Transition-Path Times, Survival Probability, and First-Passage Time
Authors: Michele Caraglio
Abstract: We derive an analytical expression for the propagator and the transition path time distribution of a two-dimensional active Brownian particle crossing a parabolic barrier with absorbing boundary conditions at both sides. By taking those of a passive Brownian particle as basis states and dealing with the activity as a perturbation, our solution is expressed in terms of the perturbed eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the associated Fokker-Planck equation once the latter is reduced by taking into account only the coordinate along the direction of the barrier and the self-propulsion angle. We show that transition path times are typically shortened by the self-propulsion of the particle. Our solution also allows us to obtain the survival probability and the first-passage times distribution, which display a strong dependence on the particle's activity, while the rotational diffusivity influences them to a minor extent.

Title: Learning Nonlinear Heterogeneity in Physical Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks
Authors: Fabiana Taglietti, Andrea Pulici, Maxwell Roxburgh, Gabriele Seguini, Ian Vidamour, Stephan Menzel, Edoardo Franco, Michele Laus, Eleni Vasilaki, Michele Perego, Thomas J. Hayward, Marco Fanciulli, Jack C. Gartside
Abstract: Physical neural networks typically train linear synaptic weights while treating device nonlinearities as fixed. We show the opposite - by training the synaptic nonlinearity itself, as in Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) architectures, we yield markedly higher task performance per physical resource and improved performance-parameter scaling than conventional linear weight-based networks, demonstrating ability of KAN topologies to exploit reconfigurable nonlinear physical dynamics. We experimentally realise physical KANs in silicon-on-insulator devices we term 'Synaptic Nonlinear Elements' (SYNEs), operating at room temperature, 0.1-1 microampere currents, and 2 MHz speeds with no observed degradation over 10^13 measurements and months-long timescales. We demonstrate nonlinear function regression, classification, and prediction of Li-Ion battery dynamics from noisy real-world multi-sensor data. Physical KANs outperform equivalently-parameterised software multilayer perceptron networks across all tasks, with up to two orders of magnitude fewer parameters, and two orders of magnitude fewer devices than linear weight based physical networks. These results establish learned physical nonlinearity as a hardware-native computational primitive for compact and efficient learning systems, and SYNE devices as effective substrates for heterogenous nonlinear computing.

Title: Non-zero Momentum Implies Long-Range Entanglement When Translation Symmetry is Broken in 1D
Authors: Amanda Gatto Lamas, Taylor L. Hughes
Abstract: A result by Gioia and Wang [Phys Rev X 12, 031007 (2022)] showed that translationally symmetric states having nonzero momentum are necessarily long range entangled (LRE). Here, we consider the question: can a notion of momentum for non-translation symmetric states directly encode the nature of their entanglement, as it does for translation symmetric states? We show the answer is affirmative for 1D systems, while higher dimensional extensions and topologically ordered systems require further work. While Gioia and Wang's result applies to states connected via finite depth quantum circuits to a translation symmetric state, it is often impractical to find such a circuit to determine the nature of the entanglement of states that break translation symmetry. Here, instead of translation eigenstates, we focus on the many-body momentum distribution and the expectation value of the translation operator in many-body states of systems having broken translation symmetry. We show that in the continuum limit the magnitude of the expectation value of the translation operator $|<T>|$ necessarily goes to $1$ for delocalized states, a proxy for LRE states in 1D systems. This result can be seen as a momentum-space version of Resta's formula for the localization length. We investigate how accurate our results are in different lattice models with and without well-defined continuum limits. To that end, we introduce two models: a deterministic version of the random dimer model, illustrating the role of the thermodynamic and continuum limits for our result at a lattice level, and a simplified version of the Aubry-Andre model, with commensurate hopping for both momentum and position space. Finally, we use the random dimer model as a test case for the accuracy of $|<T>|$ as a localization (and thus entanglement) probe for 1D periodic lattice models without a well-defined continuum limit.

Title: In-Substrate Imaging of Diamond hBN FET Current via Widefield Quantum Diamond Microscopy
Authors: Anuj Bathla, Subrat Kumar Pradhan, Ajit Kumar Dash, Prabhat Anand, M. Girish Chandra, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Akshay Singh, Veeresh Deshpande, Kasturi Saha
Abstract: We demonstrate widefield magnetic imaging of current flow in hydrogen terminated diamond field effect transistors (FETs) through in-substrate nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers. Hydrogen termination of the diamond surface induces a two dimensional hole gas (2DHG), while an ensemble of near surface NV centers located $ \sim 1~\mu m$ below the surface enables noninvasive magnetic imaging of current flow with micrometer scale spatial resolution. The FETs were electrically characterized over a range of drain source biases $V_{ds}= 0$ to $-15V$ and gate voltages,$V_{gs}= +3$ to $-9V$ followed by in situ widefield NV magnetometry during device operation. Magnetic field maps and reconstructed current density distributions directly visualize current injection at the source drain contacts and transport beneath the hBN gated channel. Magnetic field maps reveal current density variations in the channel region owing to non-uniformities or defects in the gate dielectric. In addition, we observe a pronounced enhancement of the drain current ($\sim 600-900 \mu A$) and a shift in the apparent threshold voltage during laser illumination, reflecting photo induced changes in channel electrostatics. By correlating gate dependent magnetic images with simultaneous electrical measurements, we directly link spatial current distributions to FET transfer characteristics, providing new insight into buried interface transport and non-uniform gating effects in the transistor channel. As the methodology is compatible with top gated FETs, it can be used to map channel current distributions with micrometer resolution in emerging channel materials, such as 2D materials and wide bandgap channels, and establish widefield NV magnetometry as a powerful platform for probing charge transport in transistors and Van der Waals dielectric heterostructures.

Title: Exactly solvable topological phase transition in a quantum dimer model
Authors: Laura Shou, Jeet Shah, Matthew Lerner-Brecher, Amol Aggarwal, Alexei Borodin, Victor Galitski
Abstract: We introduce a family of generalized Rokhsar-Kivelson (RK) Hamiltonians, which are reverse-engineered to have an arbitrary edge-weighted superposition of dimer coverings as their exact ground state at the RK point. We then focus on a quantum dimer model on the triangular lattice, with doubly-periodic edge weights. For simplicity we consider a $2\times1$ periodic model in which all weights are set to one except for a tunable horizontal edge weight labeled $\alpha$. We analytically show that the model exhibits a continuous quantum phase transition at $\alpha=3$, changing from a topological $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum spin liquid ($\alpha<3$) to a columnar ordered state ($\alpha>3$). The dimer-dimer correlator decays exponentially on both sides of the transition with the correlation length $\xi\propto1/|\alpha-3|$ and as a power-law at criticality. The vison correlator exhibits an exponential decay in the spin liquid phase, but becomes a constant in the ordered phase. We explain the constant vison correlator in terms of loops statistics of the double-dimer model. Using finite-size scaling of the vison correlator, we extract critical exponents consistent with the 2D Ising universality class.

Title: Theory of Next-Generation Even-Denominator States
Authors: Misha Yutushui, David F. Mross
Abstract: Even-denominator quantum Hall states are leading candidates for realizing non-Abelian topological orders, with the $\nu=\frac{5}{2}$ plateau in GaAs the first and most-studied example. Recent experiments in GaAs and bilayer graphene (BLG) have observed many `next-generation' even-denominator states at filling factors such as $\nu=\frac{3}{4}$, $\frac{3}{8}$, and $\frac{3}{10}$. We develop the theory of these states, including analyses of their bulk quasiparticles, of methods for distinguishing between pairing channels in edge transport measurements, and of their trial wavefunctions. As part of this study, we derive general relations of how flux attachment affects many universal properties of states. In particular, we prove that the topological stability of interface modes is invariant under flux attachment. We compare next-generation paired states to Bonderson-Slingerland states at the same filling factors, and demonstrate that their quasiparticles carry identical charges and obey the same exchange statistics. The next-generation and Bonderson-Slingerland states still describe distinct phases, and we find that the former are energetically favored in the lowest Landau level, while the latter are favored in the first excited level.

Title: Divergent Pressure Response of Superconductivity in Sc$_{6}$MTe$_{2}$ ($M$ = Fe, Ru and Ir)
Authors: J.N. Graham, S.S. Islam, K. Yuchi, P. Král, O. Gerguri, S. Huber, J. Chang, R. Khasanov, Y. Okamoto, Z. Guguchia
Abstract: Identifying and understanding non-BCS superconductivity remains a central challenge in condensed-matter physics. Here we focus on the Sc$_{6}$MTe$_{2}$ family (M =d-electron metal), which provides a unique platform of isostructural compounds exhibiting superconductivity across 3d, 4d, and 5d systems. Using hydrostatic pressure as an additional tuning parameter, muon-spin rotation (${\mu}$SR) and AC susceptibility measurements uncover strongly contrasting pressure responses of superconductivity across the Sc$_{6}$MTe$_{2}$ series. The superconducting transition temperature, $T_{\rm C}$ decreases under pressure in the 3d Fe-based compound but increases for the 4d Ru- and 5d Ir-based systems, with the Ru compound showing the largest enhancement of nearly 50% within 2 GPa. The superfluid density exhibits similarly distinct pressure dependences, remaining nearly pressure independent for Fe while decreasing with increasing pressure for Ru and Ir. This suggests fundamentally different correlations between $T_{\rm C}$ and the superfluid density. Together, these results indicate that superconductivity emerging from strongly correlated and spin-orbit-dominated regimes in Sc$_{6}$MTe$_{2}$ is likely governed by different microscopic mechanisms and offer a useful experimental basis for future microscopic theoretical studies.

Title: Demonstration of a Field-Effect Three-Terminal Electronic Device with an Electron Mobility Exceeding 40 Million cm^2/(Vs)
Authors: T. J. Martz-Oberlander, B. Bulgaru, Z. Berkson-Korenberg, Q. Hawkins, K.W. West, K.W. Baldwin, A. Gupta, L. N. Pfeiffer, G. Gervais
Abstract: We report the fabrication and operation of a source-drain-gate three-terminal field-effect electronic device with an electron mobility exceeding $40\times 10^6$ cm$^2$ / (Vs). Several devices were fabricated, with the highest achieved electron mobility obtained using a symmetrically-doped GaAs/AlGaAs quantum well forming a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) with a density of $1.47(1) \times 10^{11}$ cm$^{-2}$ and a pristine, pre-fabrication electron mobility of $44(2) \times 10^6$ cm$^2$/(\text{Vs}). To circumvent the well-known degradation of electron mobility during fabrication, devices were fabricated using a flip-chip technique where all lithographic processing steps were performed on a separate sapphire substrate. This method demonstrates the successful operation of various gate assembly designs on distinct 2DEGs without observable mobility degradation. This advance doubles the previous record for field-effect electronic device mobility and enables access to new regimes of quantum transport and applications that were previously unfathomable due to mobility limitations.

Title: Controlling HER activity and stability of $γ$- and 6,6,12-Graphyne through engineered B-N doping: DFT and Reactive MD simulations
Authors: Juan Gomez Quispe, Matheus Medina, Subhendu Mishra, Douglas S Galvao, Abhishek Singh, Pedro Alves da Silva Autreto
Abstract: Graphynes offer a chemically heterogeneous $sp/sp^{2}$ carbon framework with distinct electronic regimes and site-selective reactivity. Here, Density Functional Theory and Reactive Molecular Dynamics Simulations are combined to evaluate pristine, B-doped, N-doped, and B-N co-doped $\gamma$-graphyne and 6,6,12-graphyne (meta/ortho/para). $\gamma$-graphyne is a semiconductor, while 6,6,12-graphyne exhibits an anisotropic Dirac-like semi-metallic dispersion. B/N substitution reconstructs near-$E_F$ states via dopant $\pi$ hybridization, and B-N pairing stabilizes defects through donor-acceptor compensation, with the ortho substitutions being the most favorable. Hydrogen adsorption remains weak on pristine lattices but becomes locally optimized upon doping, with near thermo-neutral $\Delta G_{\mathrm{ads}}$ 'hot spots' predominantly on $sp$-proximate carbon sites adjacent to the dopants. Reactive MD at 300 K further reveals an activity stability trade-off: B-N ortho in $\gamma$-graphyne sustains controlled hydrogen uptake without catastrophic bond scission, whereas B-N meta/para degrade, and 6,6,12-graphyne is generally more susceptible to over-hydrogenation. These results identify the B-N geometry as a key design variable for graphyne-based HER catalysts, which require both a favorable $\Delta G_{\mathrm{ads}}$ and finite-temperature hydrogenation stability.

Title: First-Principles Study of Mg-Induced Phase Stabilization in Ga$_2$O$_3$ polymorphs
Authors: Viswesh Prakash, Jingyu Tang, Lisa M. Porter, Rachel C. Kurchin
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the effect of Mg incorporation on the relative phase stability of the four primary Ga$_2$O$_3$ polymorphs using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, with the goal of rationalizing experimental observations suggesting that diffusion from MgAl$_2$O$_4$ substrates contributes to relative stabilization of the $\gamma$ phase. Mg incorporation is modeled up to 25% of Ga sites within supercells derived from fully relaxed unit cells of each polymorph. Our results show that while $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ remains the thermodynamically most stable phase, the enthalpic differences between polymorphs decrease with increasing Mg content. The inherently disordered $\gamma$ phase, with its high configurational entropy, becomes less energetically unfavorable under Mg substitution, suggesting that entropy-driven stabilization may facilitate its formation under high-temperature and/or nonequilibrium growth conditions such as those previously reported. These findings provide a thermodynamic rationale for the experimental observation of the $\gamma$ phase during epitaxial growth on MgAl$_2$O$_4$ spinel substrates.

Title: Scalar and fully relativistic pressure and temperature-dependent ab-initio thermodynamics study of simple cubic polonium
Authors: Balaram Thakur, Xuejun Gong, Andrea Dal Corso
Abstract: The ab-initio thermodynamic properties of simple cubic polonium ({\alpha}-Po) were studied within the quasi-harmonic approximation (QHA), where both lattice vibrations (phonons) and electronic excitations contributions are included in the Helmholtz free energy. We investigate the influence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) by comparing the scalar relativistic (SR) and fully relativistic (FR) pseudopotentials on the thermodynamic properties of polonium and evaluate the performance of three popular exchange-correlation functionals, GGA (PBE and PBEsol), and LDA (PZ). Temperature and pressure-dependent thermodynamic properties were compared with the available experimental and theoretical studies. We found that the effect of electronic excitations is negligible for all the thermodynamic properties. LDA+SOC provides a better agreement with the experimental volume, while the thermal expansion coefficients from LDA+SOC and PBEsol + SOC closely match experimental values. SOC effects appear insignificant for the isobaric heat capacity but substantially contribute to the adiabatic bulk modulus. The phonon dispersions and mode-Grüneisen parameters ({\gamma}_q{\eta}) were interpolated at the lattice constant corresponding to 301 K. The SR dispersions exhibit several anomalies in all directions, which were suppressed significantly by the inclusion of SOC. The role of SOC on the elastic constant-coefficient (C_ij) and elastic anisotropy factor at 0 K is also studied. The Pugh ratio confirmed that simple cubic polonium is ductile, and we observed that the elastic anisotropy factor and Pugh ratio decreased with increasing pressure. The effect of SOC on the Cauchy pressure is also determined.

Title: Modulation of superconducting properties by the charge density wave at the surface of 2H-NbSe2
Authors: Tetsuo Hanaguri
Abstract: To investigate the interplay between charge density wave (CDW) and superconductivity, we performed ultralow-temperature spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunneling microscopy on the cleaved surface of the layered superconductor 2H-NbSe2. We found that the superconducting-gap spectrum exhibits intricate structures reflecting the anisotropic gaps opening on multiple Fermi surfaces. Notably, none of the characteristic energy scales apparent in the spectral gap show appreciable spatial variations, suggesting that the finite-momentum pairing is negligible. Instead, the spectral weight near the coherence peak is modulated with the same periodicity as the CDW. The maximum position of the coherence-peak-weight modulation coincides with neither the peak nor the bottom of the CDW modulation; rather, it aligns with the center of one of the two inequivalent triangular plaquettes that comprise the CDW unit cell. This distribution pattern of Bogoliubov quasiparticles directly results from the broken in-plane inversion symmetry at the surface of 2H-NbSe2, which may activate Ising spin-orbit coupling.

Title: Disparate Quantum Corrections to Conduction in Carbon Nanotube Bundles
Authors: Shengjie Yu, Zhengyi Lu, Renjie Luo, Tanner Legvold, Natsumi Komatsu, Liyang Chen, Oliver S. Dewey, Lauren W. Taylor, Huaijin Sun, Matteo Pasquali, Geoff Wehmeyer, Matthew S. Foster, Junichiro Kono, Douglas Natelson
Abstract: Quantum interference effects such as weak localization (WL) and universal conductance fluctuations (UCF) normally yield consistent electronic phase-coherence lengths in homogeneous conductors. Here we show that in individual carbon nanotube bundles exfoliated from highly conductive solution-spun fibers, different probes, including the field scales and magnitudes of WL and UCF and nonlocal magnetoconductance, lead to strikingly disparate estimates of coherence lengths. WL magnetoconductance measured in a perpendicular magnetic field yields a phase-coherence length of approximately 50 nm. In contrast, UCF amplitudes are comparable to e squared over h even for an 8 micrometer long segment, and nonlocal magnetoconductance persists across a 4 micrometer separation of electrodes, revealing phase-coherent transport over micrometer length scales within a single bundle. The coexistence of short- and long-range coherence implies that locally diffusive electrons remain partially phase-correlated among nanotubes within the same bundle. These findings challenge the conventional single-scale picture of mesoscopic coherence and establish carbon nanotube bundles as a model platform for emergent, network-level quantum transport.

Title: Anomalous valley Hall dynamics of exciton-polaritons
Authors: Xingzhou Chen, Yuanjun Guan, Areg Ghazaryan, Shiran Sun, Lingxiao Yu, Ruitao Lv, Artem Volosniev, Zheng Sun, Jian Wu
Abstract: The valley degree of freedom in atomically thin transition-metal dichalcogenides provides a natural binary index for information processing. Exciton-polaritons formed under strong light-matter coupling offer a promising route to overcome the limited lifetime and transport of bare valley excitons. Here we report an anomalous optical valley Hall effect in a monolayer WS2 exciton-polariton system. Using polarization- and time-resolved real-space imaging, we directly visualize a symmetry-breaking spatial separation of polaritons from opposite valleys under linearly polarized excitation, accompanied by an ultrafast Hall drift velocity on the order of 10^5 m/s. This behaviour cannot be accounted for by conventional cavity-induced mechanisms and instead points to a strain-induced synthetic pseudomagnetic field acting on the excitonic component of polaritons. Our results establish exciton-polaritons as a high-speed and optically accessible platform for valley transport, opening pathways towards tunable valleytronic and topological photonic devices.

Title: Supercurrent and multiple Andreev reflections in Ge hut nanowire Josephson Junctions
Authors: Han Gao, Jian-Huan Wang, Ji-Yin Wang, Jian-Jun Zhang, Hongqi Xu
Abstract: We report an experimental study of induced superconductivity in Ge hut nanowire Josephson junctions. The Ge hut nanowires are grown on prepatterned SiGe ridges via molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) and Josephson junction devices are fabricated by contacting the nanowires with Al electrodes. Low-temperature current-bias transport measurements of the Josephson junctions are performed and the measurements show that the devices exhibit gate-tunable supercurrent and excess current. The analysis of excess current indicates that the transparency of the Ge hut nanowire Josephson junctions is as high as 85%. Voltage-bias spectroscopy measurements of the devices show multiple Andreev reflections up to the fourth order. With magnetic field and temperature-dependent measurements of the multiple Andreev reflections, the critical field and the critical temperature of the induced superconductivity in the Josephson junctions are extracted to be ~0.12 T and ~1.4 K. The success in introducing superconductivity into Ge hut nanowires will stimulate their applications in building advanced quantum processors.

Title: Emergence of spatiotemporal patterns in a fuel-driven coupled cooperative supramolecular system
Authors: Akta Singh, Nayana Mukherjee, Jagannath Mondal, Pushpita Ghosh
Abstract: Chemically fueled supramolecular systems can exhibit complex, time-dependent behaviors reminiscent of living matter when maintained far from equilibrium by continuous energy or fuel consumption. Here, we introduce a minimal reaction-diffusion model that captures the essential dynamics of a cooperative supramolecular polymerization network driven by monomer activation and deactivation. We show that a balance between autocatalytic growth and inhibitory decay sustains a nonequilibrium steady state in the model that undergoes a Hopf bifurcation, giving rise to autonomous oscillations. When spatial transport is introduced through diffusion, the system displays rich spatiotemporal phenomena, such as traveling wavefronts and transient polygonal patterns. Our results demonstrate that the interplay between reaction kinetics and diffusion can spontaneously generate self-organized, life-like dynamics in synthetic supramolecular polymer systems. This theoretical framework not only bridges molecular self-assembly and active matter dynamics but also provides design principles for creating adaptive, oscillatory, and self-patterning materials powered by chemical fuels.

Title: Atomic-Scale Insights into Solute Drag Effects on Grain Boundary Motion in Mg-Al and Mg-Ca Alloys
Authors: Zhishun Chen, Shudong He, Shuai Zhang, Xiaohan Bie, Zhuoming Xie, Tengfei Yang, Wangyu Hu, Huiqiu Deng, Shiwei Xu, Zhuoran Zeng, Jie Hou
Abstract: The slip behavior of dislocations and grain boundaries critically governs recrystallization and plastic deformation in Mg alloys and can be strongly influenced by solutes. However, the quantitative effects of solute distribution on defect mobility remain unclear. Using molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations, we systematically investigate how Al and Ca solutes affect the motion of dislocations, low-angle grain boundaries (LAGBs), and high-angle grain boundaries (HAGBs) in Mg. Within the idealized framework of random solid-solution, solute drag is dominated by elastic interactions arising from atomic size mismatch, resulting in a stronger resistance from Ca than from Al. In contrast, under the more realistic condition where solute segregation occurs, the dominant mechanism shifts to chemically driven pinning, whose effectiveness is governed by the attainable segregation density. Owing to strong Ca-Ca repulsion, Al achieves substantially higher segregation concentrations than Ca and therefore exerts much stronger pinning effects. Notably, solute-induced retardation is significantly more pronounced for HAGBs than for LAGBs, leading to amplified solute effects during the late stages of recrystallization, where grain growth is controlled primarily by HAGB migration. These results provide atomic-scale insight into experimentally observed grain refinement in Mg alloys.

Title: Spin reorientations in structurally metastable, disordered, and hexagonal Cr7Te8
Authors: K. Guratinder, T.G. Romig, H.C. Mandujano, C. Stock, E. E. Rodriguez
Abstract: Vapor deposited two-dimensional Cr$_{7}$Te$_{8}$ displays unusual temperature dependent Hall effect properties, including a room temperature anomalous Hall effect, sign reversals of the Hall resistivity on cooling, and a peak in the Hall resistivity at low temperatures. The two dimensional Cr$_{7}$Te$_{8}$ heterostructures that form the basis of these measurements are hexagonal in structure. We study the magnetic and structural properties of bulk Cr$_{7}$Te$_{8}$ synthesized by quenching from 1000 $^{\circ}$C with the goal of relating the magnetic, structural, and electronic properties. This quenched phase is metastable, hexagonal, and displays different magnetic properties from the slow-cooled and more thermodynamically stable monoclinic phase. High-resolution x-ray diffraction of the quenched hexagonal phase finds a first-order transition to a lower symmetry monoclinic phase on \textit{heating} above $\sim$ 550 K. Magnetic susceptibility measurements of the quenched hexagonal phase reveal ferromagnetic ordering above room temperature, along with the two distinct transitions at $\sim$ 220~K and $\sim$ 70~K. Through neutron diffraction studies, we find the $\sim$ 220 K anomaly is a spin reorientation transition of the ferromagnetically aligned magnetic moments and the $\sim70$ K feature represents a transition from a high temperature ferromagnet to a low temperature antiferromagnet. We suggest that these magnetic transitions are related to changes in the unit cell dimensions and are connected to the temperature dependent Hall resisitivity studied in two-dimensional heterostructures. This implies a link between structural, magnetic, and electronic properties in the ``pseudo" two-dimensional chromium tellurides.

Title: Segregation-Controlled Diffusion-Induced Grain Boundary Migration in Alloy 690
Authors: Yuntian Jiang, Shuai Zhang, Zhuoming Xie, Xiaohan Bie, Huiqiu Deng, Wangyu Hu, Jie Hou
Abstract: Grain boundary (GB) migration accompanied by Cr depletion is widely observed in Alloy 690 and is closely linked to intergranular degradation and stress corrosion cracking. However, the fundamental driving force for GB migration and its link with Cr depletion remains unclear. In this work, hybrid molecular dynamics and semi-grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations were employed to investigate GB migration in Alloy 690 under coupled solute diffusion and segregation effects across a range of GB characters. The results show that Cr segregation at GBs, while generally considered favorable for GB stability, can facilitate diffusion-induced GB migration and Cr depletion. Cr diffusion along GBs produces localized Cr depletion zones that are energetically incompatible with positively segregating GBs, generating a chemical driving force that drives GB migration toward the Cr-rich matrix, which ultimately results in persistent GB migration accompanied by a Cr depletion. By quantifying solute-GB interaction energetics, we demonstrate that GB migration is quantitively controlled by the coupled effects of solute diffusivity and segregation strength. These mechanistic insights provide a unified framework that rationalizes experimentally observed correlations between GB character, Cr depletion, and GB migration in Cr-containing alloys.

Title: Systematic Magnetic Structure Generation Based on Oriented Spin Space Groups: Formulation, Applications, and High-Throughput First-Principles Calculations
Authors: Takuya Nomoto, Kohei Shinohara, Hikaru Watanabe, Ryotaro Arita
Abstract: We propose a framework for generating magnetic structures, inspired by the concept of oriented spin space groups (SSGs): magnetic structures are first generated as totally symmetric representations of an SSG and are then rotated such that they belong to the maximal magnetic space group of the SSG, which we term spin-symmetry-adapted (SSA) structures and oriented SSA structures, respectively. This is a natural framework to enforce fixed magnetic moment magnitudes on the symmetry-equivalent sites as well as to exploit the spin-orbit coupling (SOC)-induced hierarchy of energy scales. To examine the present scheme, we analyze the MAGNDATA database and find that 77% of the reported structures are reproducible at the SSG level, among which 82% are fully reproduced within the oriented SSG scheme, regardless of their spin-only group types or propagation vectors. To quantitatively assess computational and predictive performance, we perform spin density functional theory calculations for 283 materials, first carrying out self-consistent calculations for SSA structures without SOC, followed by fixed-charge calculations including SOC for the descendant oriented SSA structures. The experimental magnetic structures are reproduced as energetically most stable in 82% of cases at the SSG level without SOC and in 76% of cases at the oriented SSG level with SOC, showing that the fixed-charge scheme enables accurate evaluation of SOC-induced energy differences at low computational cost. The characteristic energy scale among oriented SSA structures is only $\sim$0.29 meV per magnetic atom, about 300 times smaller than that of distinct SSA structures. These results demonstrate that oriented SSG-based enumeration, combined with the two-step calculations for SSA and oriented SSA structures, provides an efficient and robust route for large-scale magnetic-structure prediction.

Title: Permanent Lattice Compression of Lead-Halide Perovskite for Persistently Enhanced Optoelectronic Properties
Authors: Karunakara Moorthy Boopathi, Beatriz Martín-García, Aniruddha Ray, Joao M. Pina, Sergio Marras, Makhsud I. Saidaminov, Francesco Bonaccorso, Francesco Di Stasio, Edward H. Sargent, Liberato Manna, Ahmed L. Abdelhady
Abstract: Under mild mechanical pressure, halide perovskites show enhanced optoelectronic properties. However, these improvements are reversible upon decompression, and permanent enhancements have yet to be realized. Here, we report antisolvent-assisted solvent acidolysis crystallization that enables us to prepare methylammonium lead bromide single crystals showing intense emission at all four edges under ultraviolet light excitation. We study structural variations, edge-vs-center, in these crystals using micro-X-ray diffraction and find that the enhanced emission at the edges correlates with lattice compression compared to in the central areas. Time-resolved photoluminescence measurements show much longer-lived photogenerated carriers at the compressed edges, with radiative component lifetimes of ca. 1.4 us, 10 times longer than at the central regions. The properties of the edges are exploited to fabricate planar photodetectors exhibiting detectivities of 3x10^13 Jones, compared to 5x10^12 Jones at the central regions. The enhanced lifetimes and detectivities correlate to the reduced trap state densities and the formation of shallower traps at the edges due to lattice compression.

Title: Materealize: a multi-agent deliberation system for end-to-end material design and synthesis
Authors: Seongmin Kim, Jaehwan Choi, Kunik Jang, Junkil Park, Varinia Bernales, Alán Aspuru-Guzik, Yousung Jung
Abstract: We propose Materealize, a multi-agent system for end-to-end inorganic materials design and synthesis that orchestrates core domain tools spanning structure generation, property prediction, synthesizability prediction, and synthesis planning within a single unified framework. Through a natural-language interface, Materealize enables non-experts to access computational materials workflows and obtain experimentally actionable outputs for material realization. Materealize provides two complementary modes. In instant mode, the system rapidly composes connected tools to solve diverse inorganic tasks-including property-conditioned synthesizable candidate design with synthesis recipes, diagnosis, and redesign of unsynthesizable structures, and synthesizable data augmentation-within a few minutes. In thinking mode, Materealize applies multi-agent debate to deliver more refined and information-rich synthesis recommendations, including reasoning- and model-driven synthesis routes and mechanistic hypotheses. The mechanistic hypotheses are validated by direct comparison with the literature for known mechanisms and further supported by physics-grounded simulations for novel synthesis pathways. By combining tool-level accuracy with reasoning-level integration, Materealize can bridge the gap between computational discovery and practical experimental realization.

Title: Graphene-based technologies for energy applications, challenges and perspectives

Abstract: Here we report on technology developments implemented into the Graphene Flagship European project for the integration of graphene and graphene-related materials (GRMs) into energy application devices. Many of the technologies investigated so far aim at producing composite materials associating graphene or GRMs with either metal or semiconducting nanocrystals or other carbon nanostructures (e.g., CNT, graphite). These composites can be used favourably as hydrogen storage materials or solar cell absorbers. They can also provide better performing electrodes for fuel cells, batteries, or supercapacitors. For photovoltaic (PV) electrodes, where thin layers and interface engineering are required, surface technologies are preferred. We are using conventional vacuum processes to integrate graphene as well as radically new approaches based on laser irradiation strategies. For each application, the potential of implemented technologies is then presented on the basis of selected experimental and modelling results. It is shown in particular how some of these technologies can maximize the benefit taken from GRM integration. The technical challenges still to be addressed are highlighted and perspectives derived from the running works emphasized.

Title: Inverse Design of Tightly Woven Smart Fabrics
Authors: Einav Berin, Hillel Aharoni
Abstract: We present a geometric framework for the inverse design of smart woven fabrics composed of non-uniformly shrinking threads. A sufficiently tight weaving structure imposes strong local criteria on the material deformation and reduces the local geometry to a single scalar degree of freedom. Control over this degree of freedom can be achieved through simple calibration for each specific material system, via either mechanical experiments or numerical simulations. This reduction allows us to inverse-design a woven smart fabric, that conforms to an arbitrary target geometry when actuated, by solving a nonlinear hyperbolic partial differential equation. We validate this approach by deriving the thread-level actuation required for specific target geometries. We present both exact analytic solutions for symmetric shapes and a numerical optimization method for arbitrary freeform surfaces. These results confirm the practicality of our framework in achieving programmable, complex three-dimensional shaping.

Abstract: The fluctuations are termed mesoscopic, when their typical size is essentially larger then the average distance between the nearest neighbors, while being much smaller than the overall system size. Since the features of mesoscopic fluctuations are essentially different from those of the surrounding matter, they can be interpreted as fluctuations of one phase occurring inside another host phase. In condensed matter, these fluctuations are of nanosize. They can occur in many-body systems of different nature, for instance, they are typical for condensed matter, can appear in systems of trapped atoms, and also arise in biological and social systems. A survey of the experimental evidence for the occurrence of mesoscopic fluctuations in different materials and systems is given. The main attention is paid to a general theoretical approach for describing them. Applications of the approach are also discussed.

Title: Structural constraints on mobility edges in one-dimensional quasiperiodic systems
Authors: Sanghoon Lee, Tilen Cadez, Kyoung-Min Kim
Abstract: Mobility edges commonly arise in one-dimensional quasiperiodic systems once exact self-duality is broken, yet their origin is typically understood only at the level of individual Hamiltonians. Here we show that mobility edge positions are not independent spectral features of individual Hamiltonians, but are structurally constrained across quasiperiodic Hamiltonians related by an isospectral duality. Using a bichromatic Aubry--André model as a minimal setting, we demonstrate that this constraint is encoded in an exact identity for Lyapunov exponents derived from the Thouless formula. As a consequence, the mobility edge positions are restricted to a reduced set of energies. In the self-dual limit, these mobility edge positions coincide at a single localization--delocalization transition. This structural constraint enforces a linear critical scaling of the physical Lyapunov spectrum near the self-dual point. Numerical results confirm a critical exponent consistent with the standard Aubry--André value of $\nu = 1$, while simultaneously revealing a novel, non-universal energy-dependent prefactor.

Abstract: Mixed ionic electronic transfer (MIET) reactions, such as the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at oxide surfaces, are of paramount importance to manifold technologically highly relevant processes and fundamental understanding must be developed to improve performance and tailor highly efficient electrodes and catalysts. Understanding such complex multi-step reactions, requires the study of kinetic processes, underlying thermodynamic properties, i.e. ionic and electronic defect concentrations and electrostatic surface effects. However conventional techniques struggle to uncover the complete picture within the same sample/measurement. Here, we overcome this limitation by introducing bias-triggered conductivity relaxation (BCR) as a novel tool to investigate MIET reactions on oxides. It is based on alternating out-of-plane coulometric titration/polarization and in-plane electrical conductivity relaxation measurements, providing simultaneous electronic, ionic and extraordinarily rich surface kinetics information. This innovative combination of electrical and chemical driving forces synergizes information depth, with enhanced time resolution, versatility and speed, yet it lifts the weaknesses of the individual approaches, while remaining cost-effective and surprisingly simple. Furthermore, BCR allows to disentangle overpotential induced electrostatic modifications of the surface kinetics in a unique manner. We showcase the advantages of BCR in this work by studying the ORR in model (La,Sr)FeO$_{3-{\delta}}$ thin film electrodes and reporting on their thermodynamic and kinetic properties.

Title: Magnetoelastic coupling at the field-induced transition in EuAl$_{12}$O$_{19}$

Abstract: Magnetoelastic coupling plays a crucial role in magnetic-field-induced transitions in anisotropic ferromagnets. Ultrasonic methods are suitable for experimental investigations of these phenomena. We investigate elastic constants in EuAl$_{12}$O$_{19}$, a quasi-two-dimensional anisotropic ferromagnet, by measuring sound velocity in magnetic fields perpendicular to spontaneous magnetization. The shear modulus $C_{44}$ exhibits dramatic softening at the field-induced transition from the ferromagnetic to a paramagnetic phase with magnetic moments forced to polarize along the applied transverse field. The softening is attributed to strong magnetic fluctuations near a second-order phase transition. Theoretical calculations based on magnetization data qualitatively reproduced the observed behavior within a strain-exchange mechanism. These results demonstrate that magnetoelastic coupling in EuAl$_{12}$O$_{19}$ arises primarily from exchange striction and provide a framework for modeling similar transitions in other anisotropic ferromagnets.

Title: Orientational ordering and correlations in a quasi-one-dimensional hard-dumbbell fluid
Authors: Ana M. Montero, Péter Gurin, Szabolcs Varga, Andrés Santos
Abstract: We study a quasi-one-dimensional fluid of hard dumbbells with continuous orientational degrees of freedom using an exact transfer-matrix formulation. The model allows for a complete analytical characterization of thermodynamic properties, orientational ordering, and correlation functions in terms of the spectral properties of an integral operator. We derive exact expressions for the equation of state, the orientational distribution function, and both partial and total radial distribution functions. Their asymptotic behavior is governed by the complex poles of the Laplace-transformed correlation functions, which determine the positional and orientational correlation lengths. As density increases, the system exhibits a continuous crossover from a weakly ordered regime with a unimodal orientational distribution to a strongly constrained regime characterized by bimodal orientational ordering. This crossover is accompanied by a nonmonotonic behavior of the pressure relative to the Tonks gas and by a qualitative change in the decay of correlation functions from oscillatory to monotonic. In the high-pressure limit, we show that orientational and positional fluctuations contribute equally to the pressure, leading to a universal ratio of twice the Tonks pressure. The theoretical predictions are supported by numerical solutions of the discretized transfer operator and by scaling arguments that elucidate the high-pressure behavior of ordering and correlation lengths.

Title: Effects of pulsed and continuous light and heavy ion irradiation on the morphology and electrical properties of Ag+C60 and Au+C60 composite thin films
Authors: Giovanni Ceccio, Kazumasa Takahashi, Yuto Kondo, Romana Miksova, Vasily Lavrentiev, Josef Novak, Eva Stepanovska, Jiri Vacik
Abstract: Metal - organic nanocomposite thin films represent a versatile class of materials whose properties can be effectively tuned through external stimuli. In this study, Ag+C60 and Au+C60 nanocomposite thin films were briefly investigated to elucidate the effects of ion irradiation on both their morphology and electrical properties. The films were synthesized by co-deposition of noble metals and fullerenes, using ion beam sputtering of metal targets combined with simultaneous thermal evaporation of C60. The as - deposited films were characterized by ion beam analysis to determine their composition and element depth distributions. Subsequently, the samples were irradiated at room temperature with either a continuous Ar ion beam or a pulsed C ion beam, both at an energy of 20 keV and a fluence of 1 x 1015 ions/cm2. Irradiation-induced morphological changes were examined by scanning electron microscopy. While the C-irradiated films retained compact and homogeneous surface morphologies, Ar irradiation induced pronounced surface restructuring, resulting in highly corrugated and porous-like surfaces. In addition to morphology, the electrical resistance of the films was measured. The results indicate that C-irradiated samples exhibit only minor changes in resistivity, whereas Ar irradiation strongly affects the electrical properties, with the most significant impact observed for the Au+C60 system. The observed changes in electrical resistance closely correlate with the irradiation-induced surface morphology. The measurement results are briefly discussed below.

Title: NASICON solid-electrolyte modification and analysis using ion and neutron beams

Abstract: Solid electrolytes (SEs) for sodium-based superionic conductors (NaSICON) are widely recognized for their excellent ionic conductivity and application in sodium based energy storage systems. While considerable effort has been made to develop thin electrolytes for all-solid-state batteries (ASSBs) for lithium ions, only a few sodium-based SEs have been successfully fabricated as thin films. These thin films are particularly desirable for their reduced electrical resistance, which typically increases with the thickness of the SE. By reducing the thickness of the SEs to the nanometer scale, their ionic conductivity can be significantly enhanced. In this study, the NASICON composite was initially prepared in the form of pellets using the mixed oxide technique with a planetary ball mill and synthesized by the solid-state method at 1250 °C. The resulting pellets were used as sputtering targets in a low-energy ion facility to prepare continuous and uniform NASICON nanofilms. To explore the effect of ion implantation on the electrical properties of NASICON, the prepared films were bombarded with Ni ions at 1.1 MeV and varying fluences, using the Tandetron accelerator at the CANAM infrastructure (NPI Řež). The electrical properties of both the synthesized and implanted films were analyzed through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The results, describing the impact of irradiation on NASICON's properties, are presented here.

Title: Localized emission in MoSe$_2$ monolayers on GaN nanopillars

Abstract: Solid-state quantum emitters (QEs) in two-dimensional semiconductors offer compact, chip-compatible sources for quantum photonics. In transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), nanopillars are widely used to induce localized emission, yet the underlying confinement mechanism and the relative roles of strain versus dielectric environment remain unclear. The general problem addressed here is whether strain alone explains quantum emitter formation and placement in MoSe$_2$, or whether dielectric contrast at suspended-supported interfaces is also required. Here, we combine hyperspectral superlocalization of photoluminescence with co-registered AFM topography and phase to map the positions of localized states (LS) in MoSe$_2$ suspended on GaN pillars and correlate them with bending strain and the local dielectric context. Contrary to the common assumption of purely strain-driven activation, LS frequently occur at suspended--supported interfaces around the pillar apex and span a broad strain range without a clear threshold, while being scarce along high-strain ripples. Our data indicate that deterministic emitter positioning in Mo-based TMDs benefits from co-engineering both strain gradients and nanoscale dielectric heterogeneity, rather than strain alone. More broadly, this combined optical-mechanical characterization approach provides a general framework for mapping structure-property relationships in 2D quantum materials at the single-emitter level.

Title: Hybrid films of Co - C60 preparation and changes induced by external stimuli
Authors: Giovanni Ceccio, Jiri VAcik, Yuto Kondo, Kazumasa Takahashi, Romana Miksova, Eva Stepanovska, Josef Novak, Petr Malinsky, Barbara Fazio, Catia Cannilla, Alena Michalcova, Sebastiano Vasi
Abstract: In this work, we report on the study on organic-metal hybrid systems, in particular Co-C60 fullerene thin films. This study mainly focused on the investigation of the morphological and structural evolution of the film surface after various external stimuli designed to provide energy to the system. For film growth, we adopted an innovative approach, combining ion-beam sputtering of a pure metal target with thermal evaporation of C60 in a co-deposition setup. The films underwent a series of treatments to induce modifications. Laser and ion irradiations were performed using a pulsed laser, a continuous Ar beam, and a pulsed C beam. In addition, thermal annealing in vacuum was performed to examine the long-term effects of temperature. The composition of deposited film was investigated using Ion Beam Analysis, the morphology and the structure, and the effects of treatments on the films were studied using SEM and TEM microscopies and Raman spectroscopy. Changes in electrical resistance were also measured to explore potential applications of these films after treatment.

Title: Structural stability, electronic structure, and magnetic properties of the single-layer trilayer La3Ni2O7 polymorph
Authors: Shekhar Sharma, Yi-Feng Zhao, Antia S. Botana
Abstract: A polymorph of the bilayer nickelate La3Ni2O7 that displays an alternating single-layer (SL) and trilayer (TL; 1313) stacking pattern has recently been discovered. Signatures of superconductivity under pressure have been found in this phase. At ambient pressure, La3Ni2O7-1313 has been reported to crystallize in three different space-group symmetries Cmmm, Imma, and Fmmm. Unlike the commonly observed tilted NiO6 octahedra in perovskite nickelates, the Cmmm phase exhibits no NiO6 tilts, implying that this structural feature alone may be insufficient to give rise to superconductivity in Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates. Here, we employ first-principles calculations and group theory analysis to study the pressure dependence of the structural instabilities in this SL-TL La3Ni2O7 polymorph. At ambient pressure, we identify multiple unstable phonon branches in the highest symmetry (Cmmm) structure at various high-symmetry points of the Brillouin zone. Distortions associated with these instabilities lead to one of the other experimentally reported space groups (Imma) that does display octahedral tilts. The magnetic tendencies indicate that the electronic structure of La3Ni2O7-1313 at ambient pressure is dominated by the TL block, as the SL is in a Mott-insulating regime. Under pressure, a tetragonal P4/mmm structure becomes stable, in agreement with experiments.

Title: Intertwined Charge Stripes and Majorana Zero Modes in An Iron-Based Superconductor

Abstract: In type-II superconductors, magnetic fields modulate the amplitude and phase of the superconducting order parameter, forming quantized vortices where superconductivity is locally suppressed and exotic bound states or competing electronic orders emerge. Using spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunneling microscopy on epitaxial Ba(Fe$_{0.94}Co$_{0.06})$_2$As$_2$ films, we discover an incommensurate charge-stripe order aligned with the Fe-Fe bond direction and nucleated inside magnetic vortices. These charge modulations intensify at the vortex core, extend far into the vortex halo, and persist within the superconducting gap. Strikingly, the charge order modulates Andreev bound states of vortices at non-zero energies, producing abelian vortices with half-odd-integer level quantization and non-abelian vortices with integer-quantized core states that host a Majorana zero mode. The distinct vortex types are distinguished by the registry of their centers relative to the charge-stripe pattern and remain robust in ultrathin (2.5-unit-cell) films. Our findings reveal a density-wave-textured vortex matter and provide fresh insights into the intertwined phenomena of charge-stripe order, pair-density-wave modulations, and Majorana physics in iron-based superconductors.

Title: Topological Semimetal Transport Modulated by Interstitial Fe in Ba(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$)$_{2+δ}As$_2$ Superconductors
Authors: Ze-Xian Deng, Qiang-Jun Cheng, Jing Jiang, Yong-Wei Wang, Xi Zhou, Ming-Qiang Ren, Cong Cong Lou, Xiao-Xiang Chen, Bin-Jie Wu, Zeng-Wei Zhu, Qing-Hua Zhang, Lin Gu, Ding Zhang, Kai Liu, Xu-Cun Ma, Qi-Kun Xue, Can-Li Song
Abstract: Topological semimetals are renowned for exhibiting large, unsaturated magnetoresistance arising from ultrahigh carrier mobility and electron-hole compensation. However, such behaviors remain poorly understood in iron-based superconductors that have been recently recognized to harbor rich nontrivial topology. Here, we combine angle-resolved magneto-transport measurements with first principles calculations to reveal the emergence and tunability of topological semimetals in ferropnictide Ba(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$)$_{2+\delta}As$_2$ epitaxial films, modulated by interstitial Fe. These states exhibit ultralow residual resistivity, coexisting high-mobility electron and hole carriers, and linear positive magnetoresistance below 110 K. Remarkably, the magnetoresistance becomes more pronounced when the magnetic field is applied parallel to the film plane, reaching an unsaturated 1206% at 56 T. Furthermore, superconductivity persists in these ferropnictide films, establishing them as a tunable platform for investigating the interplay among electron correlation, topology, and superconductivity.

Title: Reversible viscoelasticity and irreversible elastoplasticity in the power law creep and yielding of gels and fibre network materials under stress
Authors: Michael J. Hertaeg, Suzanne M. Fielding
Abstract: We study computationally the creep and yielding of athermal gels and fibre network materials under a constant imposed shear stress, within a minimal model of interconnected filaments with central forces in $d=2$ spatial dimensions. Each filament is assumed Hookean initially, then breaks irreversibly above a threshold strain. At early times after the imposition of a small stress, we find purely viscoelastic creep response associated with non-affine deformations within the material, with solid terminal behaviour for a network coordination $Z>2d=4$ and initially floppy response for $Z<4$. For a marginally connected network, $Z=4$, we find sustained power law creep with a strain rate $\dot\gamma\sim t^{-1/2}$ and strain $\gamma \sim t^{1/2}$ as a function of time $t$ after the imposition of the stress. This viscoelastic regime gives way at later times to irreversible elastoplastic creep arising from filament breakage, broadening the range of values of $Z$ and time over which power law creep occurs, compared to a network with filament breakage disallowed. This accumulating damage can weaken the network to such an extent that catastrophic material failure then occurs after a long delay, which we characterise. Finally, we consider the implications of viscoelastic versus elastoplastic deformation for the extent to which a material will recover its original shape if the load is removed after some interval of creep.

Title: Strain as a topological selector in altermagnetic CrSb
Authors: Sumohan Giri, Nirmal Ganguli
Abstract: Altermagnetism combines fully compensated magnetic order with a magnetic symmetry that relates inequivalent spin sublattices, offering a promising, still underexplored platform for unconventional topological phases. Here we show that both isotropic tensile strain and electron localization, controlled by an effective Hubbard interaction $U_{\text{eff}}$, can act as efficient and systematic topological control parameters in the altermagnetic Weyl semimetal CrSb. While CrSb hosts Weyl fermions at equilibrium, modest tensile strain of 4-5% stabilizes additional symmetry allowed Dirac crossings and triple-point fermions, with further strain selectively favoring the triple-point phase. We propose a 3D low-energy Hamiltonian that captures the interplay between the Hubbard interaction $U$ and the sublattice symmetry of the altermagnet, giving rise to an interaction-driven Dirac crossing. Our results establish CrSb as a model altermagnet in which either strain or electron localization can selectively access and control the distinct topologies inherent to the altermagnets.

Title: CVD grown bilayer MoS2 based artificial optoelectronic synapses for arithmetic computing and image recognition applications
Authors: Umakanta Patra, Subhrajit Sikdar, Roshan Padhan, Amandeep Kaur, Satyaprakash Sahoo, Subhabrata Dhar
Abstract: Demand for lower computing power has rapidly increased. In this context, brain-inspired neuromorphic computing, which integrate data storage and processing, has attracted significant attention. Here, our study reveals that field effect transistors fabricated on chemical vapor deposited bilayer (2L) MoS2 films can mimic the functions of biological synapse. These devices demonstrate high level of pair pulse facilitation (PPF), short term to long term memory (STM-to-LTM) transition as well as learning-forgetting-relearning properties. Effect of light intensity, pulse number, pulse width and photon energy on the STM-to-LTM transition is studied. It has been found that the rate of depression of the memory state can be controlled using the gate bias. Electrical and optical energy consumptions per synaptic event are estimated to be as low as 280 fJ and 20 nJ, respectively. Furthermore, photocurrent in these devices is observed to increase linearly with the number of the excitation pulses. This property has been exploited to demonstrate different arithmetic operations by the device. Moreover, these devices show great potential for image recognition. Artificial neural network simulation has returned an image recognition accuracy of ~85%. All these findings show a great prospect of 2L-MoS2 for developing low power, transparent and flexible neuromorphic devices.

Title: Reaching the intrinsic performance limits of superconducting strip photon detectors up to 0.1 mm wide

Abstract: Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) have emerged as the highest performing photon-counting detectors, making them a critical technology in quantum photonics and photon-starved optical sensing. However, the performance of SNSPDs is limited not by the intrinsic properties of the superconducting film, but by edge-induced current crowding. Despite extensive materials optimization and increasingly demanding fabrication strategies aimed at mitigating this edge-limited behavior, the device edges continue to limit the maximum device operating current, thereby degrading key performance metrics. Here, we demonstrate for the first time in situ tuning of a detector from an edge-limited to a bulk-limited regime, allowing the device to reach its intrinsic performance limit. Our approach is based on current-biased superconducting "rails" placed on either side of the detector to suppress current crowding at the edges. We show that activation of the rails reduces the dark count rate by nine orders of magnitude and extends the photon detection plateau at 1550 nm by more than 40%. These results are demonstrated on detectors up to 0.1 mm wide, establishing an entirely new class of ultra-wide strip detectors that we call superconducting strip photon detectors (SSPD). Moreover, the ability to suppress edge current crowding using the rails provides a pathway toward SSPDs with strip widths extending into the mm-scale. Such devices will enable large-area, high efficiency SSPD arrays with infrared sensitivity and open new opportunities in applications ranging from biomedical imaging to deep space optical communication.

Title: Hysteretic Excitation in Non-collinear Antiferromagnetic Spin-Torque Oscillators: A Terminal Velocity Motion Perspective
Authors: Hao-Hsuan Chen, Ching-Ming Lee
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework for non-collinear antiferromagnetic spin torque oscillators (NC-AFM STO) by unifying spin dynamics under the Poisson Bracket formalism. Shifting from traditional torque-based descriptions to an operational symmetry perspective, we develop two complementary viewpoints: a vector perspective identifying infinite degenerate Rigid Body Precession (RBP) states where exchange energy depends solely on the total magnetic momentum, and a particle perspective decomposing dynamics into Center-of-Mass (CM) translation and Relative Motion (RM) oscillation. Using time-dependent rotational and translational transformation techniques, we analytically resolve the rapid (~10 ps) transient evolution into a stable RBP state driven by SOT and damping. We demonstrate that the out-of-plane anisotropy (OPA) lifts the exchange degeneracy, triggering a long-term (~1 ns) oscillatory decay toward a steady state characterized by uniform spin z-components and a 120-degree inter-spin locking angle. This state is accurately governed by our Terminal Velocity Motion (TVM) model [arXiv:2305.14013], where exchange coupling transforms into kinetic energy with a light effective mass. The model precisely predicts SOT-driven transients, hysteretic excitation, and the dynamic phase diagram. Finally, we account for the sub-critical current regime mismatch by identifying a 'Rigid-Body Breaking' effect: a surge in effective friction caused by the self-resonance of RM variables induced by CM translation, mediated by the in-plane anisotropy (IPA).

Title: Critical speed of a binary superfuid of light
Authors: Pierre-Élie Larré, Claire Michel, Nicolas Cherroret
Abstract: We theoretically study the critical speed for superfluid flow of a two-dimensional (2D) binary superfluid of light past a polarization-sensitive optical obstacle. This speed corresponds to the maximum mean flow velocity below which dissipation is absent. In the weak-obstacle regime, linear-response theory shows that the critical speed is set by Landau's criterion applied to the density and spin Bogoliubov modes, whose relative ordering can be inverted due to saturation of the optical nonlinearity. For obstacles of arbitrary strength and large spatial extent, we determine the critical speed from the conditions for strong ellipticity of the stationary hydrodynamic equations within the hydraulic and incompressible approximations. Numerical simulations in this regime reveal that the breakdown of superfluidity is initiated by the nucleation of vortex-antivortex pairs for an impenetrable obstacle, and of Jones-Roberts soliton-type structures for a penetrable obstacle. Beyond superfluids of light, our results provide a general framework for the critical speed of 2D binary nonlinear Schrödinger superflows, including Bose-Bose quantum mixtures.

Title: Coarsening dynamics of fingerprint labyrinthine patterns: Machine learning assisted characterization
Authors: Supriyo Ghosh, Vinicius Yu Okubo, Kotaro Shimizu, B. S. Shivaram, Hae Yong Kim, Gia-Wei Chern
Abstract: Fingerprint labyrinthine patterns exhibit a level of structural complexity beyond simple stripe phases, combining local stripe order with a dense network of point-like defects. Unlike symmetry-breaking phases, where coarsening proceeds via diffusive defect annihilation, or conventional stripe phases, where curvature-driven motion of extended grain boundaries dominates, the coarsening of fingerprint labyrinths is governed primarily by localized junction and terminal defects. Using the Turing-Swift-Hohenberg equation, we study the nonequilibrium relaxation of fingerprint labyrinthine patterns following a quench. To go beyond conventional Fourier-based diagnostics, we employ a template-matching convolutional neural network (TM-CNN) to identify and track junctions and terminals directly in real space, enabling a quantitative characterization of defect statistics and spatial correlations. We show that, although these point-like defects drive coarsening, their motion is strongly constrained by the surrounding stripe geometry, leading to slow, nondiffusive dynamics that are qualitatively distinct from both conventional phase ordering and stripe coarsening. Together, these results establish defect-mediated dynamics as the central organizing principle of fingerprint labyrinthine coarsening and demonstrate the effectiveness of machine-learning-assisted approaches for complex pattern-forming systems.

Abstract: Graphene enables precise carrier-density control via gating, making it an ideal platform for studying electronic interactions. However, sample inhomogeneities often limit access to the low-density regimes where these interactions dominate. Enhancing carrier mobility is therefore crucial for exploring fundamental properties and developing device applications. Here, we demonstrate a significant reduction in external inhomogeneity using a double-layer graphene architecture separated by an ultra-thin hexagonal boron nitride layer. Mutual screening between the layers reduces scattering from random Coulomb potentials, resulting in a quantum mobility exceeding. Shubnikov de-Haas oscillations emerge at magnetic fields below 1 mT, while integer quantum Hall features are observed at 0.002T. Furthermore, we identify a fractional quantum Hall plateau at a filling factor of at 2T. These results demonstrate the platform's suitability for investigating strongly correlated electronic phases in graphene-based heterostructures.

Title: The role of the apical oxygen in cuprate high-temperature superconductors
Authors: Samuel Vadnais, Rémi Duchesne, Kristjan Haule, A.-M. S. Tremblay, David Sénéchal, Benjamin Bacq-Labreuil
Abstract: Scanning tunneling microscopy measurements exploiting the natural superstructure modulation of the cuprate superconductor Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ (Bi-2212) have revealed a possible correlation between the Cu-apical-O distance $\delta_{\mathrm{api}}$ and the superconducting order parameter $m_{\mathrm{SC}}$, as reported recently by O'Mahony et al. (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 119, e2207449119 (2022)). These observations were interpreted as evidence for a direct link between superconductivity and the charge-transfer gap, and more broadly revived the long-standing question of the role of apical oxygens in cuprate superconductivity. Using a combination of density-functional theory and cluster dynamical mean-field theory, we compute from first principles the variations of $m_{\mathrm{SC}}$ induced solely by apical oxygen displacement in Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CuO$_{6+\delta}$, Bi-2212, and HgBa$_2$CuO$_{4+\delta}$. The quantitative agreement between our calculations and experiments allows us to unambiguously attribute the observed variations of $m_{\mathrm{SC}}$ to changes in $\delta_{\mathrm{api}}$. We demonstrate, however, that these variations of $m_{\mathrm{SC}}$ originate predominantly from changes in the effective hole-doping of the CuO$_2$ planes, with negligible effect on the charge-transfer gap. The modest magnitude of the $m_{\mathrm{SC}}$ modulation induced by apical-oxygen displacement alone therefore warrants caution in interpreting correlations between $T_c$ and $\delta_{\mathrm{api}}$ inferred from comparisons across different cuprate compounds.

Title: The flux of particles in a one-dimensional Fleming-Viot process
Authors: Éric Brunet, Bernard Derrida
Abstract: The Fleming-Viot process describes a system of $N$ particles diffusing on a graph with an absorbing site. Whenever one of the particles is absorbed, it is replaced by a new particle at the position of one of the $N-1$ remaining particles. Here we consider the case where the particles lie on the semi-infinite line with a biased diffusion towards the origin which is the absorbing site. In the large $N$ limit, the evolution of the density becomes deterministic and has a number of characteristics similar to the Fisher-KPP equation: a one-parameter family of steady state solutions, dependence of the long time asymptotics on the initial conditions, Bramson logarithmic shift, etc. One noticeable difference, however, is that in the Fleming-Viot case, the solution can be computed explicitly for arbitrary initial conditions and at an arbitrary time. By modifying the diffusion rule near the origin, one can produce a transition in the flux of absorbed particles, very similar to the pushed-pulled transition in travelling waves. Lastly, using a cut-off approximation (which is known to be correct in the theory of travelling waves), we derive a number of predictions for the leading large $N$ correction of the flux of absorbed particles.

Title: Towards a Modern Theory of Chiralization
Authors: Nicola A. Spaldin
Abstract: The Modern Theory of Polarization, which rigorously defines the spontaneous electric polarization of a periodic solid and provides a recipe for its computation in electronic structure codes, transformed our understanding of ferroelectricity and related dielectric properties. Here we call for the development of an analogous Modern Theory of Chiralization. We review earlier attempts to quantify chirality, highlight the fundamental and practical developments that a modern theory would facilitate, and suggest possible promising routes to its establishment.

Title: Electric-Switchable Chiral Magnons in PT-Symmetric Antiferromagnets
Authors: Jinyang Ni, Congzhe Yan, Peiyuan Cui, Zhijun Jiang, Yuanjun Jin, Guoqing Chang
Abstract: The magnons in antiferromagnetic insulators (AFIs) exhibit dual chirality, each carrying opposite spin angular momentum. However, in AFIs that are protected by PT symmetry, the magnon bands remain degenerate. In this work, we introduce a new class of PT - preserving AFIs in which the giant chiral splitting of magnons can be induced and reversibly controlled by an external electric field. Unlike ordinary cases, such AFIs host a hidden dipole coupled to the antiferromagnetic order, which allows an external electric field to break the magnon sublattice symmetry and thereby largely lift the band degeneracy. Through group theory analysis, we identify the possible magnetic layer groups that support electric-field-induced magnon band splitting. Promisingly, by density-functional- theory and spin wave calculations, the magnon band splitting of Cr2CBr2 reach up to 27meV induced by an electric field of 0.2V/Å, equivalent to the 230T under a uniform magnetic field. In addition, since chiral splitting is directly coupled to the electric field, the corresponding magnon-mediated spin current can be switched by the electric field. Our Letter opens a door for developing electric-field-controlled spintronics based on the magnons.

Title: Facile Optimization of Combinatorial Sputtering Processes with Arbitrary Numbers of Components for Targeted Compositions
Authors: Shelby Sutton Fields, Christopher David White, Keith Knipling, Steven Bennett
Abstract: Combinatorial sputtering is a physical vapor deposition method that enables the high-throughput synthesis of compositionally varied thin films. Using this technique, the effects of stoichiometry on specific properties of alloy thin films with analog composition gradients can be mapped using high-throughput characterization. To obtain specific stoichiometries, such as those desired for an equiatomic, intermetallic, or doped compounds, the sputter power of each target must be simultaneously tuned to optimize the deposition rate of each component. This optimization problem increases in complexity with the number of components, which commonly leads to iterative guess-and-check processing and can limit the intrinsic high-throughput advantages of this synthesis method. To circumvent this challenge, this work introduces a composition optimization procedure that enables the facile synthesis of sputtered combinatorial films with targeted compositions. This procedure leverages the expeditious mapping of composition using wavelength dispersive x-ray fluorescence and is capable of optimizing processing for an arbitrary number of components. As a demonstration, this method is leveraged to sputter a combinatorial Cr$_{v}$Fe$_{w}$Mo$_{x}$Nb$_{y}$Ta$_{z}$ film with an equiatomic composition near the wafer center.

Title: Helical Current of Propagating Dirac Electrons and Geometric Coupling to Chiral Environments
Authors: Ju Gao, Fang Shen
Abstract: We show that a propagating Dirac electron with intrinsic spin generically carries a real--space helical conserved current, even in the absence of orbital angular momentum. Using exact Dirac eigenstates in cylindrical confinement, we demonstrate that this helical structure possesses definite handedness, persists into evanescent regions, and is characterized by a geometric helix pitch independent of the longitudinal de~Broglie wavelength. This intrinsic helical geometry enables a local geometric coupling between a propagating electron and a chiral environment, yielding chirality--dependent spin selectivity through current geometry rather than through a spin--orbit coupling term.

Title: Physical and Dielectric Properties of Polycrystalline LaV$_{0.5}$Nb$_{0.5}$O$_4$
Authors: Ashok Kumar, Simranjot K. Sapra, Ramcharan Meena, Vinod Singh, Anita Dhaka, Rajendra S. Dhaka
Abstract: We report a detailed investigation of the structural, electronic, vibrational, and dielectric properties of polycrystalline LaV$_{0.5}$Nb$_{0.5}$O$_4$ samples, prepared at two sintering temperatures (1000\degree C and 1250\degree C). The introduction of Nb$^{5+}$ at the V$^{5+}$ site leads to notable structural and vibrational changes, which can be attributed to their isoelectronic nature and the comparatively larger ionic radius of Nb$^{5+}$. The Rietveld refinement of the X-ray diffraction patterns confirms a coexistence of monoclinic ($P$2$_{1}$/$n$) and scheelite-type tetragonal ($I$4$_{1}$/$a$) phases; for example, with a fraction of 4\% and 96\% for the sample annealed at 1250\degree C. The particle morphology has altered from spherical (1000\degree C) to irregular-shaped (1250\degree C) as a result of increase in annealing temperature. The Raman spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy and X-ray Photoemission Spectroscopy have been used to understand the vibrational and electronic properties. An optical band gap of 2.7~eV for the sample sintered at 1250\degree C is calculated using Ultraviolet-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy measurements. The dielectric studies shows the higher dielectric permittivity ($\epsilon$$_{r}$) and lower dielectric loss for the sample annealed at 1250\degree C.

Title: Interface Spin-orbit Coupling Induced Room-temperature Ferromagnetic Insulator
Authors: Yuhao Hong, Shilin Hu, Ziyue Shen, Chao Deng, Xiaodong Zhang, Lei Wang, Long Wei, Qinghua Zhang, Lingfei Wang, Liang Si, Yulin Gan, Kai Chen, Zhaoliang Liao
Abstract: To achieve room-temperature ferromagnetic insulators, which are crucial candidates for next-generation dissipation-free quantum and spintronic devices, remains a significant challenge. In this study, we report the epitaxial synthesis of novel room-temperature ferromagnetic insulating thin films, achieved through the precise construction of (111)-oriented 3d/5d interfaces. Our analysis indicates that, unlike conventional doping methods, the (111)-oriented SrIrO3/La2/3Sr1/3MnO3 (SIO/LSMO) interfaces exhibit markedly enhanced spin-orbit coupling (SOC). This enhanced interfacial SOC strengthens the electron-phonon coupling in LSMO, thereby shortening the electronic mean free path. As a result, the intrinsic metallicity of LSMO is suppressed, giving rise to a new FMI phase that emerges between the ferromagnetic metal and paramagnetic insulator regimes of the LSMO phase diagram. Furthermore, the temperature window of the FMI state can be tuned by precisely controlling the thickness of the LSMO layers. Our study reveals a new strategy for developing ferromagnetic insulators by engineering 3d/5d interfaces and orientations, paving a way for the development of novel dissipation-free quantum and spintronic devices.

Title: Random Walks Across Dimensions: Exploring Simplicial Complexes
Authors: Diego Febbe, Duccio Fanelli, Timoteo Carletti
Abstract: We introduce a novel operator to describe a random walk process on a simplicial complex. Walkers are allowed to wonder across simplices of various dimensions, bridging nodes to edges, and edges to triangles, via a nested organization that hierarchically extends to higher structures of arbitrary large, but finite, dimension. The asymptotic distribution of the walkers provides a natural ranking to gauge the relative importance of higher order simplices. Optimal search strategies in presence of stochastic teleportation are addressed and the peculiar interplay of noise with higher order structures unraveled.

Title: Biexcitons in Ruddlesden-Popper Metal Halides Probed by Nonlinear Coherent Spectroscopy
Authors: Katherine A. Koch, Carlos Silva-Acuña, Ajay Ram Srimath Kandada
Abstract: Excitons and their correlated complexes underpin the rich photophysics of quantum-confined semiconductors. Among these, biexcitons -- bound states of two electrons and two holes -- provide a sensitive probe of Coulomb correlations, exciton-exciton interactions, and the role of the dielectric environment. In Ruddlesden-Popper metal halide materials (RPMHs), strong quantum and dielectric confinement stabilize excitons with binding energies of hundreds of meV, creating an ideal platform for multi-exciton phenomena. Conventional linear spectroscopies, such as photoluminescence and transient absorption, reveal biexciton signatures but suffer from spectral congestion and reabsorption artifacts. Two-dimensional coherent spectroscopies, particularly two-quantum (2Q) multidimensional techniques, uniquely access multi-exciton coherences and provide unambiguous estimates of biexciton binding energies. This minireview surveys the spectroscopic evidence for biexcitons in RPMHs, highlights the advantages of nonlinear multidimensional approaches, and situates biexciton physics within the broader context of excitonic materials, including GaAs quantum wells, quantum dots, and transition-metal dichalcogenides. By emphasizing the interplay of exciton-exciton annihilation, excitation-induced dephasing, and biexciton formation, we argue that multidimensional coherent spectroscopy offers the most reliable pathway to disentangle many-body interactions in quantum-well derivatives of metal-halide perovskites.

Title: Transition in Splitting Probabilities of Quantum Walks
Authors: Prashant Singh, David A. Kessler, Eli Barkai
Abstract: We investigate the splitting probability of a monitored continuous-time quantum walk with two targets and show that, in stark contrast to a classical random walk, it exhibits a nonanalytic, phase-transition-like behavior controlled by the sampling time at the targets. For large systems and sampling times smaller than a critical value $\tau_c = 2\pi/\Delta E$, where $\Delta E$ is the energy bandwidth, the splitting probability is universal and equal to $1/2$, independent of the initial condition and the sampling time. Above the critical sampling, a nonuniversal regime emerges in which the splitting probability deviates from $1/2$ and develops a fluctuating pattern of pronounced peaks and dips dependent on both the sampling time and the initial condition. These results follow from a nontrivial mapping of the splitting problem onto a pair of single-target detection problems enabled by the superposition principle.

Title: Langevin equations with non-Gaussian thermal noise: Valid but superfluous
Authors: Alex V. Plyukhin
Abstract: We discuss the statistics of additive thermal (internal) noise in systems governed by the generalized Langevin equation with linear dissipation. To assess the equation's validity, it is common to assume that the system is ergodic and to verify that solutions approach correct equilibrium values at asymptotically long times. In this paper, we instead consider the consistency of the generalized Langevin equation with the Jarzynski equality at finite times and do not assume the system's ergodicity. Specifically, we consider a classical Brownian oscillator whose initial stiffness, or frequency, is perturbed by a rectangular pulse of duration $\tau$. We find that the Jarzynski equality is satisfied unconditionally only up to the seventh order in $\tau$; in higher orders, the Jarzynski equality holds if and only if the noise is Gaussian. These results imply that, unless it is exact, the Langevin equation can only be used to evaluate properties that are linear or quadratic in noise and its derivatives. Such properties are insensitive to the noise statistics, so the Langevin equation with linear dissipation and non-Gaussian noise (though not inconsistent by itself) is superfluous.

Title: Supercoiling DNA with a free end
Authors: Daniela Moretti, Giuseppe Gonnella, Antonio Suma, Giada Forte, Davide Marenduzzo, Cristian Micheletti
Abstract: In this work, we combine coarse-grained Brownian dynamics simulations and mean-field theory to study supercoiling dynamics, as well as the steady-state profiles of twist and writhe, in an open DNA polymer where one of the free ends is subjected to a constant torque. Even though the other end is free, and hence can spin and release torsional stress, we observe that the entire chain transitions between a swollen and a plectonemic phase as the torque increases beyond a critical threshold. In the plectonemic phase, we observe a non-linear twist profile in the steady state, resulting from the mutual interconversion between the injected twist and geometrical writhe, which distributes inhomogeneously along the chain. We also show that the non-equilibrium dynamics of twist accumulation is diffusive, and that writhe diffusion is negligible in this geometry, as plectonemes remain localised near the end that is being rotated. We discuss the feasibility of testing our results with single-molecule experiments.

Title: From many valleys to many topological phases - quantum anomalous Hall effect in IV-VI semiconductor quantum wells
Authors: Szymon Majewski, Michał Wierzbicki, Tomasz Dietl
Abstract: Consistent with prior qualitative expectations for group IV-VI topological crystalline insulators, this work demonstrates, based on band structure and Chern number calculations, that Pb$_{1-x}$Sn$_x$Se/(PbSe)$_{1-y}$(EuS)$_y$ quantum wells constitute a promising and viable platform for realizing a variety of quantum anomalous Hall phases. The proposed basis transformation procedure for the multiband $\mathit{k} \cdot \mathit{p}$ Hamiltonian enables the treatment of wells grown along arbitrary crystallographic directions while explicitly accounting for the anisotropy of the material's isoenergetic surfaces. Numerical studies of $\langle 111\rangle$-, $\langle 110\rangle$- and $\langle 001\rangle$-oriented quantum wells predict attainable Chern numbers with magnitudes ranging from $1$ to $4$, depending on the quantum well width, Sn content, and relative orientation of the four projected $\mathrm{L}$ valleys with respect to the growth direction. The results further indicate that appropriate strain compensation is required to achieve high-quality quantization of the Hall conductance.

Title: Charge and spin orders in the t-U-V-J model: a slave-spin-1 approach
Authors: Olivier Simard, Michel Ferrero, Thomas Ayral
Abstract: Strongly-correlated fermion systems on a lattice have been a subject of intense focus in the field of condensed-matter physics. These systems are notoriously difficult to solve, even with state-of-the-art numerical methods, especially in regimes of parameters where degrees of freedom compete or cooperate at similar energy and length scales. Here, we introduce a spin-1 slave-particle technique to approximately treat the t-U-V-J fermionic model at arbitrary electron dopings in an economical manner. This formalism respectively maps the original charge and spin degrees of freedom into effective pseudo-spin and pseudo-fermion sectors, which are treated using a self-consistent cluster mean-field method. We study the phase diagram of the model under various conditions and report the appearance of charge and spin stripes within this formalism. These stripes are a consequence of the cluster mean-field treatment of the pseudo-particle sectors and have not been detected in previous slave-particle studies. The results obtained agree qualitatively well with what more reliable numerical methods capture.

Title: A saturation bound for cumulative responses under local linear relaxation
Authors: Sanjeev Kumar Verma
Abstract: Saturation of cumulative observables is widely observed in systems with propagating or spreading signals and is commonly modeled using system-specific mechanisms such as scattering statistics, coherence functions, or phenomenological decay laws. This work shows that such saturation follows directly from linear local relaxation alone. Any linear observable accumulated over the lifetime of a relaxing signal is bounded by a scale set by the relaxation time, independent of geometry, dimensionality, or microscopic dynamics. When relaxation is mapped to space through transport or spreading, this temporal bound yields a corresponding spatial saturation scale. A closed-form expression reveals a two-regime behavior: linear growth at short times followed by saturation beyond the relaxation time. The result provides a minimal and unified explanation for cumulative saturation across transport, diffusive, and stochastic systems.

Title: Magnon equilibrium spin current in collinear antiferromagnets
Authors: Vladimir A. Zyuzin
Abstract: We theoretically predict that Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction can induce magnon equilibrium spin current in collinear antiferromagnets. Such a current, being a response to the effective magnon vector potential, can be considered as magnon analog of the superconducting supercurrent or the persistent current. Large amplitude of the predicted effect may compensate for the smallness of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, making the equilibrium spin currents to be experimentally observed. We suggest that external electric field can play the role of effective flux magnons interact with and propose an experiment based on the interference of magnons in the ring geometry as a verification of the concept.

Title: Universal non-Gaussian order parameter statistics in 2D superfluids
Authors: Abel Beregi, En Chang, Erik Rydow, Christopher J. Foot, Shinichi Sunami
Abstract: Fluctuations are an intrinsic feature of many-body systems, and their full statistical distributions reveal a wealth of information about the underlying physics. Of particular interest are non-Gaussian, extreme-value statistics that arise when nontrivial correlations and criticality dominate over the central limit theorem. Strikingly, in two-dimensional (2D) quantum fluids, such effects have been predicted to manifest in the order parameter distribution in the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) superfluid phase, which approaches a universal extreme-value form in the low-temperature limit. Here, we measure the order parameter statistics of 2D Bose gases across the BKT critical point using matter-wave interferometry. This allows us to confirm the predicted convergence of the observed statistics to a universal Gumbel distribution at low temperatures, to the 0.1% level of the probability density. Furthermore, the intrinsic precision of the atom interferometer allows the robust extraction of higher-moment observables such as skewness and kurtosis; in particular, we report direct measurements of the Binder cumulant which allows us to precisely identify the onset of the phase transition. Extending this approach to the investigation of non-equilibrium systems, we probe vortex unbinding dynamics following a quench across the BKT critical point and identify parameter-independent scaling behaviour of higher moments.

Title: High-resolution neutron diffraction determination of noncollinear antiferromagnetic order in the honeycomb magnetoelectric Fe$_{4}$Nb$_{2}$O$_{9}$
Authors: Raktim Datta, Kapil Kumar, Dong Gun Oh, Dongwook Kim, Rahul Goel, Nara Lee, Ara Go, Young Jai Choi, Valery Kiryukhin, Sungkyun Choi
Abstract: Magnetoelectric systems offer potential for device applications exploiting coupled states between electric and magnetic properties. Among magnetoelectric materials, \FNO has attracted special attention because of its pronounced dielectric signal at high magnetic transition temperatures. However, the magnetic ground state, which is essential information for understanding its unusual magnetoelectricity, remains unclarified. Here, we report a noncollinear magnetic ground state of Fe$_{4}$Nb$_{2}$O$_{9}$. To examine the magnetoelectric effect associated with sequential magnetic and structural transitions upon cooling, we conducted combined x-ray diffraction, magnetic susceptibility, magnetization, dielectric constant, and magnetodielectric experiments. Powder neutron diffraction experiments revealed a series of magnetic Bragg peaks and clear splitting of peaks via structural transition. Magnetic Rietveld refinements, combined with group theory analysis, determined a noncollinear antiferromagnetic structure including a significant $c$-axis moment component at 1.5 K. This study provides insights into the understanding of its magnetoelectric properties.

Title: Noise tailoring for error mitigation and for diagnozing digital quantum computers
Authors: Thibault Scoquart, Hugo Perrin, Kyrylo Snizhko
Abstract: Error mitigation (EM) methods are crucial for obtaining reliable results in the realm of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers, where noise significantly impacts output accuracy. Some EM protocols are particularly efficient for specific types of noise. Yet the noise in the actual hardware may not align with that. In this article, we introduce Noise Tailoring (NT) -- an innovative strategy designed to modify the structure of the noise associated with two-qubit gates through statistical sampling. We perform classical emulation of the protocol behavior and find that the NT+EM results can be up to 5 times more accurate than the results of EM alone for realistic Pauli noise acting on two-qubit gates. At the same time, on actual IBM quantum computers, the NT method falls victim to various small error sources beyond Markovian Pauli noise. We propose to use the NT method for characterizing such error sources on quantum computers in order to inform hardware development.

Title: Cost scaling of MPS and TTNS simulations for 2D and 3D systems with area-law entanglement
Authors: Thomas Barthel
Abstract: Tensor network states are an indispensable tool for the simulation of strongly correlated quantum many-body systems. In recent years, tree tensor network states (TTNS) have been successfully used for two-dimensional systems and to benchmark quantum simulation approaches for condensed matter, nuclear, and particle physics. In comparison to the more traditional approach based on matrix product states (MPS), the graph distance of physical degrees of freedom can be drastically reduced in TTNS. Surprisingly, it turns out that, for large systems in $D>1$ spatial dimensions, MPS simulations of low-energy states are nevertheless more efficient than TTNS simulations. With a focus on $D=2$ and 3, the scaling of computational costs for different boundary conditions is determined under the assumption that the system obeys an entanglement (log-)area law, implying that bond dimensions scale exponentially in the surface area of the associated subsystems.

Title: Bayesian identification of fibrous insulation thermal conductivity towards design of spacecraft thermal protection systems
Authors: Alex Alberts, Akshay Jacob Thomas, Kamran Daryabeigi, Ilias Bilionis
Abstract: The design of spacecraft thermal protection systems (TPS) requires accurate knowledge of thermal transport properties across wide ranges of temperature and pressure. For fibrous insulation, conventional measurement techniques in laboratory settings are typically limited to temperatures much lower than what is reached in atmosphere entry scenarios. Moreover, it is often the case that only temperature measurements are available, meaning that the thermal conductivity of the insulation must be indirectly inferred as an inverse problem. We propose a Bayesian framework using information field theory (IFT) to reconstruct the thermal conductivity of high-temperature fibrous insulation from sparse experimental data. Under IFT, the conductivity is represented as a Gaussian process, and the physics is enforced via a physics-informed prior over the temperature derived from the heat equation. Bayes's rule produces an infinite-dimensional posterior distribution that quantifies uncertainty about the conductivity which can be evaluated in extrapolation regimes. We apply the method to Opacified Fibrous Insulation with both synthetic and experimental data to reconstruct the thermal conductivity beyond the experimental regime. The inferred conductivities are validated against reference data and then propagated into high-fidelity digital twins of flexible TPS performance under Mars and Earth entry trajectories. The results show that IFT yields accurate predictions with quantified uncertainty, enabling robust TPS sizing in regimes inaccessible to direct measurement.

Title: Dissipative Quantum Dynamics in Static Network with Different Topologies
Authors: Wei-Yang Liu, Hsuan-Wei Lee
Abstract: We investigate the dissipative dynamics of quantum population and coherence among different network topologies of a quantum network using a quantum spin model coupled to a thermal bosonic reservoir. Our study proceeds in two parts. First, we analyze a small network of Ising spins embedded in a large dissipative bath, modeled via the Lindblad master equation, where temperature arises naturally from system-bath coupling. This approach reveals how network topology shapes quantum dissipative dynamics, providing a basis for controlling quantum coherence through tailored network structures. Second, we propose a mean-field approach that extends the network to larger scales and captures dissipative dynamics in large-scale networks, connecting network topology to quantum coherence in complex systems and revealing the sensitivity of quantum coherence to network structure. Our results highlight how dissipative quantum dynamics depend on network topology, providing insight into the coherent dynamics of entangled states in networks. These results may be extended to dynamics in complex systems such as opinion propagation in social models, epidemiology, and various condensed-phase and biological systems.

Title: Interaction between cell membranes and protein inclusions in the large-deformation regime
Authors: Gaetano Ferraro, Michele Castellana
Abstract: Biological membranes are dynamic surfaces whose shape and function are critically influenced by protein inclusions (PIs). While membrane deformations induced by PIs have been extensively studied in the small-deformation regime, a variety of processes involves strong membrane deformations. We investigate the interaction between lipid membranes and PIs in the large deformation (LD) regime, with the finite-element method. We develop an approximate analytical solution that captures key features of the LD regime. We show that the force exerted by the membrane on a PI displays a non-monotonic behavior with respect to the PI vertical displacement. The qualitative features of this force appear to be independent of the protein geometry. For two interacting PIs, the membrane-mediated potential exhibits sub-power-law decay with inter-protein distance, reflecting the complex nature of the elastic medium. The interaction potential shows that conical PIs with identical and opposite orientations repel and attract, respectively, confirming the analogy between PI orientation and electric charge, in the LD regime. In the presence of membrane flows, we identify a characteristic velocity that separates two regimes in which bending rigidity and viscous effects dominate, respectively, implying the onset of flow-induced deformations above such velocity threshold. Overall, our results provide quantitative predictions for membrane-protein systems in biologically relevant scenarios involving LDs, with implications for protein sorting, clustering, and membrane trafficking.

Title: Visualization of Gaussian Mode Profile in Gigahertz Surface-Acoustic-Wave Resonators
Authors: Shizai Chu, Suraj Thapa Magar, John Nichol, Keji Lai
Abstract: Surface-acoustic-wave (SAW) resonators operating at gigahertz (GHz) frequencies are widely used in wireless telecommunication and quantum information processing. Successful implementation of such resonators calls for detailed microscopic understanding of their mode profiles, energy dissipation channels, and imperfections from microfabrication. In this work, we report on the visualization of acoustic waves in LiNbO3 SAW resonators by transmission-mode microwave impedance microscopy (TMIM). The Gaussian mode profile tightly confined by reflecting mirrors is vividly seen in the TMIM images, from which the linewidth of the resonator itself can be extracted. The spatially resolved acoustic profile also allows us to perform failure analysis on faulty devices. Our work establishes a pathway for further optimization of SAW resonators for classical and quantum acoustic applications.

Title: Bidirectional teleportation using scrambling dynamics: a practical protocol
Authors: Amit Vikram, Edwin Chaparro, Muhammad Miskeen Khan, Andrew Lucas, Chris Akers, Ana Maria Rey
Abstract: We show that quantum information scrambling can enable a generic SWAP gate between collective degrees of freedom in systems without universal local control. Our protocol combines the Hayden-Preskill recovery scheme, associated with the black hole information paradox, with quantum teleportation and runs them in parallel and in opposite directions, enabling bidirectional exchange of quantum states through global interactions alone. This approach cleanly distinguishes the roles of information spreading, entanglement, and chaos for enabling both coherent state transfer and recovery. We propose an experimental realization using the Dicke model, which can be realized in cavity-QED and trapped-ion platforms, highlighting the utility of holography in designing practical quantum gates.

Title: An ultrafast diamond nonlinear photonic sensor
Authors: Daisuke Sato, Junjie Guo, Takuto Ichikawa, Dwi Prananto, Toshu An, Paul Fons, Shoji Yoshida, Hidemi Shigekawa, Muneaki Hase
Abstract: The integration of light and materials technology is key to the creation of innovative sensing technologies. Sensing of electric and magnetic fields, and temperature with high spatio-temporal resolution is a critical task for the development of the next-generation of nanometer-scale quantum devices. Color centers in diamonds are attractive for potential applications owing to their characteristic quantum states, although they require metallic contacts for the introduction of external microwaves. Here, we build an ultrafast diamond nonlinear photonic sensor to assess the surface electric field; an electro-optic sensor based on nitrogen-vacancy centers in a diamond nanotip breaks the spatial-limit of conventional pump-probe techniques. The 10-fs near-infrared optical pulse modulates the surface electric field of a 2D transition metal dichalcogenide and we monitor the dynamics of the local electric field at nanometer-femtosecond spatio-temporal resolutions. Our nanoscopic technique will provide new horizons to the sensing of advanced nano materials.

Title: σh-Broken Induced Topological quasi-BIC
Authors: Yongqi Chen, Chaofeng Xie, Tongtong Zhu, Weiqiang Ding, Yurui Fang
Abstract: Transitions from bound states in the continuum (BICs) to quasi-BICs (qBICs) are typically realized by introducing in-plane asymmetry, including permittivity asymmetry ({\epsilon}-qBICs) and geometry asymmetry (g-qBICs). Here, we demonstrate that when the in-plane symmetry is rigorously kept, the transition can also be occurred, provided the out-of-plane asymmetry is designed, which is called {\sigma}h -qBICs in this work. When the {{\sigma}h symmetry is gradually broken, the system undergoes a topological phase transition characterized by a Zak phase inversion, leading to a band inversion between quadrupole and dipole modes. This process not only enables controlled radiation coupling of BICs but also introduces a defect-immune qBIC regime. Our findings establish a general mechanism for engineering high-Q resonances and topologically robust plasmonic cavities.

Authors: Siyuan Chen, Mingchen Sun, Jian Tang
Abstract: Advances in accelerator technology have led to significant improvements in the quality of muon beams over the past decades. Investigations of the muon and muonium enable precise measurements of fundamental constants, as well as searching for new physics beyond the Standard Model. Furthermore, by utilizing muon beams with high intensity and polarization, studies of the dynamics of the muon and muonium within atom level can offer valuable insights into material science. This review presents recent progress and prospects at the frontiers of muon beams and high-precision muonium physics. It also provides an overview of novel methods and detection techniques to achieve high sensitivities in different areas, including particle physics, nuclear physics, materials science and beyond.

Title: Dynamics of antiferromagnetic Dimers in Rydberg Atom Chains
Authors: Feng-Yuan Kuang, Lin Li, Weibin Li
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of antiferromagnetic dimers within a Rydberg atom chain in the regime where laser detuning compensates for nearest-neighbor (NN) interactions. Using an effective PXQ model, we demonstrate that the associated Hilbert space decomposes into disconnected, dimer-conserving subspaces. The classification of these subspaces is provided, and the computational basis states spanning them are identified. Through a combination of analytical mapping and numerical simulations, we compare the dynamics of the PXQ model with those of the full Rydberg atom chain. The deviations are attributed to two factors, laser-induced leakage from the constrained Hilbert subspace and the influence of long-range interactions beyond the NN limit. Our results indicate that subspace leakage can be mitigated by increasing the NN interaction strength. While this simultaneously amplifies the effects of long-range interactions, the conservation of the dimer number remains. Our study opens up possibilities for exploring the dynamics of antiferromagnetic dimers using the Rydberg atom quantum simulator.

Title: Size-dependent Dielectric Permittivity of Perovskite Nanocrystals
Authors: Jehyeok Ryu, Victor Krivenkov, Vitaly Goryashko, Yury Rakovich, Alexey Y. Nikitin
Abstract: Perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) are promising building blocks for quantum photonic devices. Optical properties of PNCs can be enhanced by integration with optical cavities or nanoantennas. Designing such structures requires accurate size dependent dielectric permittivity of PNCs. However, current reports provide primarily ensemble averaged values with limited access to the intrinsic response of individual PNCs. Here we suggest a methodology to reconstruct the size dependent complex dielectric permittivity of CsPbBr3 PNCs from the measured absorbance spectrum of colloidal solution. The permittivity of PNCs is modeled as a sum of Voigt profile oscillators, with the size dependent transition energies governed by the exciton effective mass. Using a transmission electron microscopy derived size distribution of the PNCs, the solution permittivity is obtained via Maxwell Garnett effective medium approximation. This permittivity is used in a transfer matrix method to simulate and fit the absorbance spectrum, from which the permittivity of PNCs is reconstructed. The extracted spectral linewidth from the imaginary part of the permittivity (78.4 meV) is consistent with single nanocrystal emission linewidths at room temperature. Finite element simulations show enhanced absorption cross section of a single PNC coupled to a nanoantenna, demonstrating applicability of the extracted permittivity. More generally, these findings provide a route to extract intrinsic permittivity of individual nanocrystals from absorbance measurements of their ensembles.

Title: Frictional work and entropy production in integrable and non-integrable spin chains
Authors: Vishnu Muraleedharan Sajitha, Matthew J. Davis, L. A. Williamson
Abstract: The maximum work extractable from a quantum system is achieved when the system is driven adiabatically. Frictional work then quantifies the difference in work output between adiabatic and non-adiabatic driving. Here we show that frictional work in a non-integrable spin chain is well-described by the diagonal entropy production associated with the build up of quantum coherence. The relationship is characterized by an effective temperature of the final adiabatic state and holds for slow to moderate driving protocols. For fast protocols, the frictional work is instead described by the quantum relative entropy between the final non-adiabatic and adiabatic states. We compare our results to those obtained from an integrable spin chain, in which case the adiabatic state is no longer described by a single temperature. In this case, the frictional work is described by a sum of terms for each independent subspace of the spin chain, which are at different effective temperatures. We show how integrability breaking can enhance work extraction in the adiabatic limit, but degrade work extraction in sufficiently non-adiabatic regimes.

Title: Partitioning networks into clusters of synchronized nodes via the message-passing algorithm: an unbiased scalable approach
Authors: Massimo Ostilli
Abstract: Partitioning large networks into stable clusters of synchronized nodes is a challenging task. Recent approaches based on spectral analysis can provide exact results on specific dynamics but remain unfeasible for very large networks. Moreover, within a stochastic framework, it is unclear which dynamics should be chosen to study synchronization. Here we propose an unbiased and scalable method based on the message-passing algorithm. By exploiting the collective behavior emerging across critical points of an effective Ising-like model, we identify dynamically coherent clusters of synchronized nodes and illustrate the approach on some large real-world networks. We find that, unlike continuous-time dynamics, abrupt desyncrhronization occurs even in simple graphs, without the need to invoke higher order interactions. However, when noise is included, the transition to synchronization becomes smoother and proceeds through the formation of plateaus, albeit at the cost of requiring larger coupling strengths.

Title: Response of fluorescent molecular rotors in ternary macromolecular mixtures
Authors: Mingshan Chi, Anh-Thy Bui, Pierre Lidon, Yaocihuatl Medina-Gonzalez
Abstract: For a few decades, Fluorescent Molecular Rotors have been commonly employed as local probes of microviscosity in complex materials. However, without proper calibration, relating microviscosity to a physical parameter is unclear, which strongly limits their quantitative use in biological media for instance. In this study, the response of a molecular rotor in binary and ternary macromolecular aqueous solutions of polyethylene glycol (PEG) of different molecular weights is investigated in order to better rationalize the sensitivity of rotors to their cybotactic environment. More precisely, for the investigated composition range of ternary mixtures, it is shown that a linear mixing rule applies for fluorescence lifetime with the proportion of the two PEG, and with an increasing ratio of heavy PEG leading to larger lifetimes. These results allow to test more precisely the free volume theory, which has been proposed in the context of probing glass transition. Analysis show that while this theory semi-quantitatively captures the observation, its precise use raises some questions.

Title: Universal Digitized Counterdiabatic Driving
Authors: Takuya Hatomura
Abstract: Counterdiabatic driving realizes parameter displacement of an energy eigenstate of a given parametrized Hamiltonian using the adiabatic gauge potential. In this paper, we propose a universal method of digitized counterdiabatic driving, constructing the adiabatic gauge potential in a digital way with the idea of universal counterdiabatic driving. This method has three advantages over existing universal counterdiabatic driving and/or digitized counterdiabatic driving: it does not introduce any many-body and/or nonlocal interactions to an original target Hamiltonian; it can incorporate infinite nested commutators, which constitute the adiabatic gauge potential; and it gives explicit expression of rotation angles for digital implementation. We show the consistency of our method to the exact theory in an analytical way and the effectiveness of our method with the aid of numerical simulations.

Title: Quantum Dimension Reduction of Hidden Markov Models
Authors: Rishi Sundar, Thomas Elliott
Abstract: Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are ubiquitous in time-series modelling, with applications ranging from chemical reaction modelling to speech recognition. These HMMs are often large, with high-dimensional memories. A recently-proposed application of quantum technologies is to execute quantum analogues of HMMs. Such quantum HMMs (QHMMs) are strictly more expressive than their classical counterparts, enabling the construction of more parsimonious models of stochastic processes. However, state-of-the-art techniques for QHMM compression, based on tensor networks, are only applicable for a restricted subset of HMMs, where the transitions are deterministic. In this work we introduce a pipeline by which \emph{any} finite, ergodic HMM can be compressed in this manner, providing a route for effective quantum dimension reduction of general HMMs. We demonstrate the method on both a simple toy model, and on a speech-derived HMM trained from data, obtaining favourable memory--accuracy trade-offs compared to classical compression approaches.

Title: Fair sampling with temperature-targeted QAOA based on quantum-classical correspondence theory
Authors: Tetsuro Abe, Shu Tanaka
Abstract: In combinatorial optimization problems with degenerate ground states, fair sampling of degenerate solutions is essential. However, the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) with a standard transverse-field mixer induces biases among degenerate states as circuit depth increases. Based on quantum-classical correspondence theory, we propose SBO-QAOA, which employs a temperature-dependent Hamiltonian encoding a Gibbs distribution as its ground state. Numerical simulations show that, unlike standard QAOA, SBO-QAOA yields ground-state probabilities converging to finite-temperature values with uniform distribution among degenerate states. These fairness and temperature-targeting properties are preserved even with only four variational parameters under a linear schedule.

Title: String Breaking and Glueball Dynamics in $2+1$D Quantum Link Electrodynamics
Authors: Jiahao Cao, Rohan Joshi, Yizhuo Tian, N. S. Srivatsa, Jad C. Halimeh
Abstract: At the heart of quark confinement and hadronization, the physics of flux strings has recently become a focal point in the field of quantum simulation of high-energy physics (HEP). Despite considerable progress, a detailed understanding of the behavior of flux strings in quantum simulation-relevant lattice formulations of gauge theories has remained limited to the lowest truncations of the gauge field, which are severely limited in their ability to draw conclusions about the quantum field theory limit. Here, we employ tensor network simulations to investigate the behavior of flux strings in a quantum link formulation of $2+1$D quantum electrodynamics (QED) with a spin-$1$ representation of the gauge field. We first map out the ground-state phase diagram of this model in the presence of two spatially separated static charges, revealing distinct microscopic processes responsible for string breaking, including a two-stage breaking mechanism not possible in the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ formulation. Starting in different initial product state string configurations, we then explore far-from-equilibrium quench dynamics across various parameter regimes, demonstrating genuine $2+1$D real-time string breaking and glueball-like bound state formation, with the latter not possible in the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ formulation. In and out of equilibrium, we consider different values and placements of the static charges. Finally, we provide efficient qudit circuits for a quantum simulation experiment in which our results can be observed in state-of-the-art ion-trap setups. Our findings lay the groundwork for quantum simulations of flux strings towards the quantum field theory limit.

Title: Stabilizer Thermal Eigenstates at Infinite Temperature
Authors: Akihiro Hokkyo
Abstract: Understanding how to analyze highly entangled thermal eigenstates is a central challenge in the study of quantum many-body systems. In this Letter, we introduce a stabilizer-based approach to construct analytically tractable energy eigenstates of nonintegrable many-body Hamiltonians. Focusing on zero-energy eigenstates at infinite temperature, we prove a sharp no-go theorem: stabilizer eigenstates of two-body Hamiltonians cannot satisfy $k$-body microscopic thermal equilibrium for any $k\ge4$. We further show that this bound is tight by explicitly constructing two-body nonintegrable Hamiltonians whose stabilizer eigenstates reproduce thermal expectation values for all two-body and all three-body observables. Finally, we identify the structural origin of this limitation by characterizing the conditions under which a stabilizer state can appear as a zero-energy eigenstate of a Hamiltonian, thereby revealing a fundamental constraint imposed by the few-body nature of interactions.

Title: Studying energy-resolved transport with wavepacket dynamics on quantum computers
Authors: Melody Lee, Roland C. Farrell
Abstract: Probing energy-dependent transport in quantum simulators requires preparing states with tunable energy and small energy variance. Existing approaches often study quench dynamics of simple initial states, such as computational basis states, which are far from energy eigenstates and therefore limit the achievable energy resolution. In this work, we propose using wavepackets to probe transport properties with improved energy resolution. To demonstrate the utility of this approach, we prepare and evolve wavepackets on Quantinuum's H2-2 quantum computer and identify an energy-dependent localization transition in the Anderson model on an 8x7 lattice--a finite-size mobility edge. We observe that a wavepacket initialized at low energy remains spatially localized under time evolution, while a high-energy wavepacket delocalizes, consistent with the presence of a mobility edge. Crucial to our experiments is an error mitigation strategy that infers the noiseless output bit string distribution using maximum-likelihood estimation. Compared to post-selection, this method removes systematic errors and reduces statistical uncertainty by up to a factor of 5. We extend our methods to the many-particle regime by developing a quantum algorithm for preparing quasiparticle wavepackets in a one-dimensional model of interacting fermions. This technique has modest quantum resource requirements, making wavepacket-based studies of transport in many-body systems a promising application for near-term quantum computers.

Title: Engineering polarization: How contradictory stimulation systematically undermines political moderation
Authors: Renato Vieira dos Santos
Abstract: Political moderation, a key attractor in democratic systems, proves highly fragile under realistic information conditions. We develop a stochastic model of opinion dynamics to analyze how noise and differential susceptibility reshape the political spectrum. Extending Marvel et al.'s deterministic framework, we incorporate stochastic media influence $\zeta(t)$ and neuropolitically-grounded sensitivity differences ($\sigma_y > \sigma_x$). Analysis reveals the moderate population -- stable in deterministic models -- undergoes catastrophic collapse under stochastic forcing. This occurs through an effective deradicalization asymmetry ($u_{B}^{\text{eff}} = u + \sigma_y^2/2 > u_{A}^{\text{eff}}$) that drives conservatives to extinction, eliminating cross-cutting interactions that sustain moderates. The system exhibits a phase transition from multi-stable coexistence to liberal dominance, demonstrating how information flow architecture -- independent of content -- systematically dismantles the political center. Our findings reveal moderation as an emergent property highly vulnerable to stochastic perturbations in complex social systems.

Title: Electric Field Tunable Band Gap in Commensurate Twisted Bilayer Graphene
Authors: Spenser Talkington, Eugene J. Mele
Abstract: Bernal bilayer graphene exhibits a band gap that is tunable through the infrared with an electric field. We show that sublattice odd commensurate twisted bilayer graphene (C-TBG) exhibits a band gap that is tunable through the terahertz with an electric field. We show that from the perspective of terahertz optics the sublattice odd and even forms of C-TBG are "inflated" versions of Bernal and AA stacked bilayer graphene respectively with energy scales reduced by a factor of 110 for the 21.79 degree commensurate unit cell. This lower energy scale is accompanied by a correspondingly smaller gate voltage, which means that the strong-field regime is more easily accessible than in the Bernal case. Finally, we show that the interlayer coherence energy is a directly accessible experimental quantity through the position of a power-law divergence in the optical conductivity.

Title: Duality between open systems and closed bilayer systems: Thermofield double states as quantum many-body scars
Authors: Alexander Teretenkov, Oleg Lychkovskiy
Abstract: We establish a duality between open many-body systems governed by the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) equation and satisfying the detailed balance condition on the one side, and closed bilayer systems with a self-adjoint Hamiltonian on the other side. Under this duality, the identity operator on the open system side maps to a quantum many-body scar of the dual Hamiltonian $\mathcal H$. This scar eigenstate has a form of a thermofield double state for a single-body conserved quantity entering the detailed balance conditions. A remarkable feature of this thermofield scar is a tunable single-layer entanglement entropy controlled by the reservoir temperature on the open system side. Further, we identify broad classes of many-body open systems with nontrivial explicit eigen operators $Q$ of the Lindbladian superoperator. The expectation values of the corresponding observables exhibit a simple exponential decay, $\langle Q\rangle_t=e^{-\Gamma t} \langle Q \rangle_0$, irrespectively of the initial state. Under the above duality, these eigen operators give rise to additional (towers of) scars. Finally, we point out that more general superoperators (not necessarily of the GKSL form) can be mapped to self-adjoint Hamiltonians of bilayer systems harbouring scars, and provide an example thereof.

Title: Spinor bosons realization of the SU(3) Haldane phase with adjoint representation
Authors: Junjun Xu
Abstract: The Haldane phase with local SU(3) adjoint representation constitutes the simplest non-trivial symmetry-protected topological phases in the SU($N>2$) Heisenberg spin chains. In this paper, we propose to realize this phase by a two-species spinor Bose gas, with each species labeling the quark or antiquark states of SU(3) symmetry. In the strong-coupling limit, we determine the ground-state phase diagram, and identify a quantum phase transition from the Haldane phase to a dimer phase. We show how to characterize the Haldane phase through its edge excitations. We also explain the physics at the dimer phase, by constructing an explicit ground-state ansatz at the dimer point.

Title: Quantum hall transformer in a quantum point contact over the full range of transmission
Authors: Stuart Yi-Thomas, Jay D. Sau
Abstract: A recent experiment [Cohen et al., Science 382, 542 (2023)] observed a robustly quantized $e^2/2h$ conductance in a quantum point contact between fractional quantum Hall edges (a quantum Hall transformer), which then vanishes at low temperature. While this behavior can be described by a boundary sine gordon (BSG) model derived from electron tunneling, the microscopic motivation for such strong tunneling is unclear. We use an alternative model based on sliding charge density waves and a density inhomogeneity to clarify the BSG description and calculate the conductance over the full range of transmission. Using a perturbative method and a matrix product state calculation, we draw a quantitative connection between the BSG model and the physical quantum Hall system.

Title: Vestigial Gapless Boson Density Wave Emerging between $ν= 1/2$ Fractional Chern Insulator and Finite-Momentum Supersolid
Authors: Hongyu Lu, Han-Qing Wu, Bin-Bin Chen, Zi Yang Meng
Abstract: The roton-triggered charge-density-wave (CDW)is widely studied in fractional quantum Hall (FQH) and fractional Chern insulator (FCI) systems, and there also exist field theoretical and numerical realizations of continuous transition from FCI to superfluid (SF). However, the theory and numerical explorations of the transition between FCI and supersolid (SS) are still lacking. In this work, we study the topological flat-band lattice models with $\nu$ = 1/2 hard-core bosons, where the previous studies have discovered the existence of FCI states and possible direct FCI-SS transitions. While the FCI is robust, we find the direct FCI-SS transition is absent, and there exist more intriguing scenarios. In the case of checkerboard lattice, we find an intermediate gapless CDW state without SF, sandwiched between FCI and SS. This novel state is triggered by the roton instability in FCI and it further continuously brings about the intertwined finite-momentum SF fluctuation when the CDW order is strong enough, eventually transiting into an unconventional finite-momentum SS state. The intermediate gapless CDW state is a vestige from the SS state, since the increasing quantum fluctuation melts only the Larkin-Ovchinnikov-type SF order in SS but its (secondary) product -- the CDW order -- survives. On honeycomb lattice, we find no evidence of SS, but discover an interesting sequence of FCI-Solid I-Solid II transitions, with both solids incompressible. Moreover, in contrast to previous single-roton condensation, this sequence of FCI-Solid I-Solid II transitions is triggered by the softening of multi-roton modes in FCI. Considering the intertwined wave vectors of the CDW orders, Solid I is a vestige of Solid II. Our work provides new horizon not only for the quantum phase transitions in FCI but also for the intertwined orders and gapless states in bosonic systems, which will inspire future studies.

Title: Electrical Interconnects for Silicon Spin Qubits
Authors: Christopher David White, Anthony Sigillito, Michael J. Gullans
Abstract: Scalable spin qubit devices will likely require long-range qubit interconnects. We propose to create such an interconnect with a resistive topgate. The topgate is positively biased, to form a channel between the two dots; an end-to-end voltage difference across the nanowire results in an electric field that propels the electron from source dot to target dot. The electron is momentum-incoherent, but not necessarily spin-incoherent; we evaluate threats to spin coherence due to spin-orbit coupling, valley physics, and nuclear spin impurities. We find that spin-orbit coupling is the dominant threat, but momentum-space motional narrowing due to frequent scattering partially protects the electron, resulting in characteristic decoherence lengths ~15 mm for plausible parameters.

Title: Nanoscale observation and control of quasiparticle induced magnetic noise in a superconducting resonator
Authors: Senlei Li, Shane P. Kelly, Jingcheng Zhou, Hanyi Lu, Yaroslav Tserkovnyak, Hailong Wang, Chunhui Rita Du
Abstract: Superconducting circuits are arguably taking a leading role in driving the ongoing quantum technological revolution. A detailed knowledge of the microscopic fluctuating electromagnetic properties plays an important role in advancing the circuitry design, testing, and material integration of cutting-edge superconducting quantum electronics. Here we report scanning nitrogen-vacancy (NV) quantum sensing of local magnetic noise environment of an on- chip superconducting resonator. We find that quasiparticle-induced fluctuating magnetic fields can drive NV spin relaxation, which shows a peak value around the superconducting transition point of niobium at the thermal equilibrium state. External microwave driving at the resonator mode frequency significantly increases the quasiparticle density, leading to enhancement of magnetic noise. We further perform optically detected magnetic resonance measurements to demonstrate quasiparticle magnetic noise mediated off-resonant dipole coupling between the NV center and niobium resonator. Our work reports experimental observation of the Hebel-Slichter peak signature by an external sensor outside of a superconductor. The presented study also highlights the advantages of quantum sensors in investigating miniaturized superconducting devices, providing insights into their future performance improvements.

Title: Cartesian Nodal Lines and Magnetic Kramers Weyl Nodes in Spin-Split Antiferromagnets
Authors: Zheng-Yang Zhuang, Di Zhu, Zhigang Wu, Zhongbo Yan
Abstract: When band degeneracy occurs in a spin-split band structure, it gives rise to divergent Berry curvature and distinctive topological boundary states, resulting in a variety of fascinating effects. We show that three-dimensional spin-split antiferromagnets, characterized by symmetry-constrained momentum-dependent spin splitting and zero net magnetization, can host two unique forms of symmetry-protected band degeneracy: Cartesian nodal lines in the absence of spin-orbit coupling, and magnetic Kramers Weyl nodes when spin-orbit coupling is present. Remarkably, these band degeneracies not only produce unique patterns of Berry-curvature distributions but also give rise to topological boundary states with unconventional spin textures. Furthermore, we find that these band degeneracies can lead to strong or even quantized anomalous Hall effects and quantized circular photogalvanic effects under appropriate conditions. Our study suggests that spin-split antiferromagnets provide a fertile ground for exploring unconventional topological phases.

Title: Non-hermitian Green's function theory with $N$-body interactions: the coupled-cluster similarity transformation
Authors: Christopher J. N. Coveney, David P. Tew
Abstract: We present the diagrammatic theory of the irreducible self-energy and Bethe-Salpeter kernel that naturally arises within the Green's function formalism for a general $N$-body non-hermitian interaction. In this work, we focus specifically on the coupled-cluster self-energy generated by the similarity transformation of the electronic structure Hamiltonian. We develop the biorthogonal quantum theory to construct dynamical correlation functions where the time-dependence of operators is governed by a non-hermitian Hamiltonian. We extend the Gell-Mann and Low theorem to include non-hermitian interactions and to generate perturbative expansions of many-body Green's functions. We introduce the single-particle coupled-cluster Green's function and derive the perturbative diagrammatic expansion for the non-hermitian coupled-cluster self-energy in terms of the `non-interacting' reference Green's function, $\tilde{\Sigma}[G_0]$. From the exact equation-of-motion of the single-particle coupled-cluster Green's function, we derive the self-consistent renormalized coupled-cluster self-energy, $\tilde{\Sigma}[\tilde{G}]$, and demonstrate its relationship to the perturbative expansion of the self-energy, $\tilde{\Sigma}[G_0]$. Subsequently, we show that the usual electronic self-energy can be recovered from the coupled-cluster self-energy by neglecting the effects of the similarity transformation. We show how the coupled-cluster ground state energy can be obtained from the coupled-cluster self-energy and provide an overview of the relationship between approximations for the coupled-cluster self-energy, IP/EA-EOM-CC and the $G_0W_0$ approximation. As a result, we introduce the CC-$G_0W_0$ self-energy by leveraging the connections between Green's function and coupled-cluster theory. Finally, we derive the diagrammatic expansion of the coupled-cluster Bethe-Salpeter kernel.

Title: Fusion Dynamics of Majorana Zero Modes
Authors: Themba Hodge, Tuan Kieu, Jasmin Bedow, Eric Mascot, Dirk K. Morr, Stephan Rachel
Abstract: Braiding and fusion of Majorana zero modes are key elements of any future topological Majorana-based quantum computer. Here, we investigate the fusion dynamics of Majorana zero modes in the spinless Kitaev model, as well as in a spinful model describing magnet-superconductor hybrid structures. We consider various scenarios allowing us to reproduce the fusion rules of the Ising anyon model. Particular emphasis is given to the charge of the fermion obtained after fusing two Majorana zero modes: as long as it remains on the superconductor, charge quantization is absent. When moving the fermion to a non-superconducting region, such as a quantum dot, nearly-quantized charge can be measured. Our findings confirm for both platforms that fusion dynamics of Majorana zero modes can indeed be used for the readout of Majorana qubits.

Title: Effect of interatomic repulsion and quasi-degenerate states on a Kitaev-transmon qubit based on double quantum dots
Authors: Clara Palacios, Armando A. Aligia
Abstract: We investigate the effect of interatomic Coulomb repulsion $V$ and particular states disregarded previously on the Kitaev-transmon system proposed by Pino \textit{et al.} \cite{pino} which consists of a Josephson junction between two double quantum dots (DQDs) modeled by the spinless Kitaev Hamiltonian. For an isolated DQD, we demonstrate that a ``sweet spot'' hosting ``poor man's Majorana'' states persist in the presence of $V$, provided that system parameters are appropriately tuned. For the full system, we demonstrate that at the sweet spots of both DQDs, all eigenstates are doubly degenerate. This degeneracy arises from the existence of an operator that maps between two decoupled Hilbert subspaces. Away from the sweet spots, the microwave spectrum becomes sensitive to the choice of initial state. In our study, we consider transitions from the ground state (which depending on the flux alternates between the above mentioned subspaces) to all possible excited states. This scenario corresponds to a system initially in thermal equilibrium at low temperature.

Title: Bose-Einstein condensation in exotic lattice geometries
Authors: Kamil Dutkiewicz, Marcin Płodzień, Abel Rojo-Francàs, Bruno Juliá-Díaz, Maciej Lewenstein, Tobias Grass
Abstract: Modern quantum engineering techniques allow for synthesizing quantum systems in exotic lattice geometries, from self-similar fractal networks to negatively curved hyperbolic graphs. We demonstrate that these structures profoundly reshape Bose-Einstein condensation. Fractal lattices dramatically lower the condensation temperature and enhance condensation fluctuations. In a Sierpiński carpet, quasi-degeneracies in the tight-binding spectrum fragment the condensate. Hyperbolic lattices, on the other hand, exhibit condensation features similar to regular three-dimensional lattices, despite their embedding in only two dimensions: The critical temperature increases as the system grows, and the temperature-dependence of the condensate fraction follows the same power-law as for cubic lattices. We explain these similarities through the similarity of the densities of state at low energies. When strong repulsive interactions are included, the gas enters a Mott insulating state. Using a multi-site Gutzwiller approach as well as a simple strong-coupling expansion, for the Sierpiński triangle we find a smooth interpolation between the characteristic insulating lobes of one-dimensional and two-dimensional systems. Our findings establish lattice geometry as a powerful tuning knob for quantum phase phenomena and pave the way for experimental exploration in photonic waveguide arrays and Rydberg-atom tweezer arrays.

Title: Universal Phase Transitions of Matter in Optically Driven Cavities
Authors: Tsan Huang, Zhiyuan Sun
Abstract: Optical cavities have been widely applied to manipulate the properties of solid state materials inside them. We propose that in systems embedded within optical cavities driven by incident pump light, the pump induces generic phase transitions into new nonequilibrium steady states. This effect arises from the ponderomotive potential, the effective static potential exerted by the pump on the low energy degrees of freedom, which exhibits a universal steplike structure that pushes the matter degrees of freedom in the direction that redshifts the cavity photon modes. For a two dimensional electron liquid in a driven cavity, this steplike potential pushes the electron density to jump to a smaller value so that a hybrid cavity photon mode is redshifted to slightly below the pump frequency. Similarly, for a dirty superconductor in such a driven cavity, this potential acts on the superconducting order parameter and causes a first order phase transition to a new steady state with a smaller gap. By realistic electromagnetic modeling of the cavity that includes all cavity modes, we construct the nonequilibrium phase diagrams for experimentally relevant devices.

Title: Dynamical stability for dense patterns in discrete attractor neural networks
Authors: Uri Cohen, Máté Lengyel
Abstract: Neural networks storing multiple discrete attractors are canonical models of biological memory. Previously, the dynamical stability of such networks could only be guaranteed under highly restrictive conditions. Here, we derive a theory of the local stability of discrete fixed points in a broad class of networks with graded neural activities and in the presence of noise. By directly analyzing the bulk and the outliers of the Jacobian spectrum, we show that all fixed points are stable below a critical load that is distinct from the classical \textit{critical capacity} and depends on the statistics of neural activities in the fixed points as well as the single-neuron activation function. Our analysis highlights the computational benefits of threshold-linear activation and sparse-like patterns.

Title: Near transform-limited single photons from rapid-thermal annealed quantum dots
Authors: Hendrik Mannel, Fabio Rimek, Marcel Zoellner, Nico Schwarz, Andreas D. Wieck, Nikolai Bart, Arne Ludwig, Martin Geller
Abstract: Single-photon emitters are essential components for quantum communication systems, enabling applications such as secure quantum key distribution and the long-term vision of a quantum internet. Among various candidates, self-assembled InAs/GaAs quantum dots (QDs) remain highly promising due to their ability to emit coherent and indistinguishable photons, as well as their compatibility with photonic integration. In this work, we investigate the impact of post-growth rapid thermal annealing (RTA) on the quantum optical properties of single self-assembled QDs embedded in a p-i-n diode structure. The annealing process induces a controlled blueshift of the emission wavelength by promoting Ga in-diffusion and intermixing. Using resonance fluorescence measurements at cryogenic temperatures (4.2 K), we investigate the single-photon statistics, the emission linewidths, and coherence time $T_2$ of the emitted photons. Our results show that, despite the high annealing temperature of $760^\circ$C, the process does not degrade the optical quality of the quantum dots strongly. Instead, we observe single-photon emission with near transform-limited linewidths, where the dephasing time $T_2$ is only a factor 1.5 above the Fourier-limit $T_2=2T_1$. These findings demonstrate that rapid thermal annealing (RTA) serves as an effective tuning method that preserves the key single-photon emission properties and may help reduce undesirable effects such as non-radiative Auger recombination in quantum photonic applications.

Title: Floquet Non-Bloch Formalism for a Non-Hermitian Ladder: From Theoretical Framework to Topolectrical Circuits
Authors: Koustav Roy, Dipendu Halder, Koustabh Gogoi, B. Tanatar, Saurabh Basu
Abstract: Periodically driven systems intertwined with non-Hermiticity opens a rich arena for topological phases that transcend conventional Hermitian limits. The physical significance of these phases hinges on obtaining the topological invariants that restore the bulk-boundary correspondence, a task well explored for static non-Hermitian (NH) systems, while it remains elusive for the driven scenario. Here, we address this problem by constructing a generalized Floquet non-Bloch framework that analytically captures the spectral and topological properties of time-periodic NH systems. Employing a high-frequency Magnus expansion, we analytically derive an effective Floquet Hamiltonian and formulate the generalized Brillouin zone for a periodically driven quasi-one-dimensional system, namely, the Creutz ladder with a staggered complex potential. Our study demonstrates that the skin effect remains robust (despite the absence of non-reciprocal hopping) across a broad range of driving parameters, and is notably amplified in the low-frequency regime due to emergent longer-range couplings. We further employ a symmetric time frame approach that generates chiral-partner Hamiltonians, whose invariants, when appropriately combined, account for the full edge-state structure. To substantiate the theoretical framework, we propose a topolectrical circuit (TEC) that serves as a viable experimental setting. Apart from capturing the skin modes, the proposed TEC design faithfully reproduces the presence of distinct Floquet edge states, as revealed through the voltage and impedance profiles, respectively. Thus, our work not only offers a theoretical framework for exploring NH-driven systems, but also provides an experimentally feasible TEC architecture for realizing these phenomena stated above in a laboratory.

Authors: Jan Tobochnik, Harvey Gould, William Klein
Abstract: An agent-based model of the economy is generalized to incorporate investment and guaranteed income mechanisms in addition to the exchange and distribution mechanisms considered in earlier models. We find realistic wealth distributions and realistic values of the Gini coefficients and the Pareto index. We also show that although the system reaches a steady state, the system is not in thermal equilibrium. The nonequilibrium behavior is associated with the multiplicative noise generated by the investment mechanism.

Title: Physical Signatures of Supercritical Fluid Boundaries
Authors: Sha Jin, Xinyang Li, Xue Fan, Matteo Baggioli, Yuliang Jin
Abstract: In the supercritical fluid (SCF) region, at temperatures and pressures above the critical point, the thermodynamic singularity separating liquids and gases no longer exists. Recent arguments based on thermodynamics and critical scalings have revived the proposal that the SCF constitutes an intermediate state of matter, separated from the liquid and gas by two supercritical boundaries, the $L^\pm$ lines. However, until now, the nature of the supercritical state and the physical signatures of these boundaries have remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate that the SCF is characterized by distinct structural, transport, and dynamical behavior. Specifically, the spatial arrangement of particles-captured by the radial distribution function-as well as the diffusion coefficient, shear viscosity, and velocity autocorrelation function in the SCF regime are qualitatively different from those in both the liquid and gas states and exhibit clear physical signatures upon crossing the $L^\pm$ lines. Our theoretical predictions are validated by molecular dynamics simulations of argon and are further supported by existing experimental evidence. These results provide a clear physical foundation for a refined phase diagram of matter in the supercritical region, comprising three distinct states-gas, supercritical fluid, and liquid-separated by two crossover boundaries obeying universal scaling laws.

Title: Non-Abelian Statistics for Bosonic Symmetry-Protected Topological Phases
Authors: Hong-Yu Wang, Bao-Zong Wang, Jian-Song Hong, Xiong-Jun Liu
Abstract: Symmetry-protected non-Abelian (SPNA) statistics opens new frontiers in quantum statistics and enriches the schemes for topological quantum computing. In this work, we propose a new paradigm of SPNA statistics in one-dimensional correlated bosonic symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases and uncover exotic universal features from a systematic investigation. In particular, we show that for generic bosonic SPT phases described by real Hamiltonians, the SPNA statistics of topological zero modes fall into two distinct classes. The first class exhibits conventional braiding of hard-core bosonic zero modes. Furthermore, we discover a second class of unconventional braiding statistics characterized by a nonlinear transformation, featuring a fractionalization of the first class and reminiscent of the non-Abelian statistics of symmetry-protected Majorana pairs. The two distinct classes of statistics have topological origin in classifying non-Abelian Berry phases for braiding processes of real-Hamiltonian systems, distinguished by whether the holonomy involves a reflection operation. To illustrate, we focus on a specific bosonic SPT phase with particle-hole symmetry, and demonstrate that both classes of braiding statistics can be feasibly realized in a tri-junction with and without the aid of a controlled defect, respectively. Analytic and numerical results are given. We demonstrate how to encode logical qubits and implement both single- and two-qubit gates using the two classes of SPNA statistics. Finally, we propose feasible experimental schemes to observe these predictions and identify the parameter regimes for the high-fidelity braiding, paving the way for the experimental observation of our results in the near future.

Title: Disorder-induced damping of spin excitations in Cr-doped BaFe$_2$As$_2$

Abstract: In doped Hund's metals, such as the iron-based superconductors, effects like charge doping and chemical pressure are often considered the dominant factors. Partial chemical substitution, however, inevitably introduces disorder. Here, we investigate spin excitations in Ba(Fe$_{1-x}$Cr$_x$)$_2$As$_{2}$ (CrBFA) by high-resolution resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) for samples with $x = 0, 0.035,$ and $ 0.085$. In CrBFA, Cr acts as a hole dopant, but also introduces localized spins that compete with Fe-derived magnetic excitations. We found that the Fe-derived magnetic excitations are softened and damped, becoming overdamped for $x = 0.085$. At this doping level, complementary angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements (ARPES) show increased electronic localization and a suppression of the nematic $d_{xz}/d_{yz}$ band splitting present in the parent compound. We thus propose a localized spin model that explicitly incorporates substitutional disorder and Cr local moments, successfully reproducing our key observations. Our findings reveal a case where disorder dominates over charge doping in the case of a Hund's metal.

Title: Spin-Seebeck Signatures of Spin Chirality in Kagome Antiferromagnets
Authors: Feodor Svetlanov Konomaev, Mithuss Tharmalingam, Kjetil M. D. Hals
Abstract: Non-collinear antiferromagnets (NCAFMs) are appealing for antiferromagnetic spintronics, as they combine the advantages of collinear antiferromagnets with novel emergent phenomena stemming from their complex spin structures. These phenomena are often associated with the intrinsic spin chirality, which characterizes the handedness of the ground-state spin configuration. Non-collinear antiferromagnets (NCAFMs) are appealing for antiferromagnetic spintronics, as they combine the advantages of collinear antiferromagnets with novel emergent phenomena stemming from their complex spin structures. These phenomena are often associated with the intrinsic spin chirality, which characterizes the handedness of the ground-state spin configuration. Here, we investigate a kagome NCAFM interfaced with a normal metal and demonstrate that the ground-state vector spin chirality can be probed through measurements of the spin Seebeck effect (SSE). Starting from a microscopic spin Hamiltonian, we derive the corresponding bosonic Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonians for the two chiral configurations. Using linear response theory, we obtain a general expression for the spin current thermally pumped into the normal metal by the SSE. We show that a sizable in-plane spin current emerges exclusively in the negative-chiral state, providing a direct signature for real-time detection of chirality switching in kagome NCAFMs. In addition, we find a field-dependent out-of-plane spin current whose magnitude differs between the two chiralities by about 81%, reflecting their distinct magnon band structures.

Title: Snakelike trajectories of electrons released from quantum dots driven by the spin Hall effect
Authors: B. Szafran, P. Wojcik
Abstract: Using time dependent simulations, we analyze the trajectories of electrons released from a quantum dot in a waveguide made of a spin-orbit-coupled material (InSb). An electron released from the quantum dot, when driven by an electric field follows a trajectory that is deflected by spin-orbit interaction and undergoes spin precession that results in a spin-dependent, snake-like trajectory. The trajectory strongly depends on the initial state of the electron, enabling detection of the electron quantum state in the dot when connected to the T-junction. Notably, we show that the snake-like trajectory persists even under a small external magnetic field with low, incomplete initial electron spin polarization. Our findings are supported by semiclassical calculations of the electron trajectory, which show good agreement with full quantum mechanical simulations

Title: Physics-Based Factorized Machine Learning for Predicting Ionic Dielectric Tensors
Authors: Atsushi Takigawa, Shin Kiyohara, Yu Kumagai
Abstract: Considerable effort continues to be devoted to the exploration of next-generation high-\k{appa} materials that combine a high dielectric constant with a wide band gap. However, machine learning (ML)-based virtual screening has remained challenging, primarily due to the low accuracy in predicting the ionic contribution to the dielectric tensor, which dominates the dielectric performance of high-\k{appa} materials. We here propose a joint ML model that predicts Born effective charges using an equivariant graph neural network, and phonon properties using a highly accurate pretrained ML potential. The ionic dielectric tensor is then computed analytically from these quantities. This approach significantly improves the accuracy of ionic contribution. Using the proposed model, we successfully identified 38 novel high-\k{appa} oxides from a screening pool of over 8,000 candidates.

Title: Finite-size and quenching effects on hyperuniform structures formed during cooling
Authors: A. Cruz-García, J. Puig, R. M. Besana, A. B. Kolton, Y. Fasano
Abstract: The outstanding physical properties of hyperuniform condensed matter systems holds significant promise for technological applications and studying effects that may disrupt this hidden order is therefore very important. Vortex matter in superconductors is a model system to study this problem since imaging experiments have revealed that correlated disorder in the host media and finite size effects disrupt the hyperuniformity of the in-plane arrangement of vortices. Here we report simulations of layered interacting elastic lines as a model for the vortex lattice in three-dimensional superconductors, following a cooling protocol that closely mimics the experimental conditions. We show that finite-thickness effects limiting the hyperuniformity range arise both in equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium. Our results provide a theoretical framework to draw a realistic road-map on synthesizing hyperuniform materials when cooling structures on finite host media with disorder.

Title: AtomWorld: A Benchmark for Evaluating Spatial Reasoning in Large Language Models on Crystalline Materials
Authors: Taoyuze Lv, Alexander Chen, Fengyu Xie, Chu Wu, Jeffrey Meng, Dongzhan Zhou, Yingheng Wang, Bram Hoex, Zhicheng Zhong, Tong Xie
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at textual reasoning and are beginning to develop spatial understanding, prompting the question of whether these abilities can be combined for complex, domain-specific tasks. This question is essential in fields like materials science, where deep understanding of 3D atomic structures is fundamental. While initial studies have successfully applied LLMs to tasks involving pure crystal generation or coordinate understandings, a standardized benchmark to systematically evaluate their core reasoning abilities across diverse atomic structures has been notably absent. To address this gap, we introduce the AtomWorld benchmark to evaluate LLMs on tasks based in Crystallographic Information Files (CIFs), a standard structure representation format. These tasks, including structural editing, CIF perception, and property-guided modeling, reveal a critical limitation: current models, despite establishing promising baselines, consistently fail in structural understanding and spatial reasoning. Our experiments show that these models make frequent errors on structure modification tasks, and even in the basic CIF format understandings, potentially leading to cumulative errors in subsequent analysis and materials insights. By defining these standardized tasks, AtomWorld lays the ground for advancing LLMs toward robust atomic-scale modeling, crucial for accelerating materials research and automating scientific workflows.

Title: TeMFpy: a Python library for converting fermionic mean-field states into tensor networks
Authors: Simon H. Hille, Attila Szabó
Abstract: We introduce TeMFpy, a Python library for converting fermionic mean-field states to finite or infinite matrix product state (MPS) form. TeMFpy includes new, efficient, and easy-to-understand algorithms for both Slater determinants and Pfaffian states. Together with Gutzwiller projection, these also allow the user to build variational wave functions for various strongly correlated electron systems, such as quantum spin liquids. We present all implemented algorithms in detail and describe how they can be accessed through TeMFpy, including full example workflows. TeMFpy is built on top of TeNPy and, therefore, integrates seamlessly with existing MPS-based algorithms.

Title: Investigation of the Effect of Thermal-Induced Atomic Motion on the Conductance of Copper Thin Films
Authors: Sihe Chen, Kevin Batzinger, Manuel Smeu
Abstract: Decrease in the size of integrated circuits (IC) and metal interconnects raise resistivity due the amplification of electron scattering effects, which decreases the efficiency of chiplets. While previous studies have investigated the electron scattering due to a roughened surface, the effect of thermal induced atomic motion on the roughened surface remains unclear. To address this gap, we investigated electron transport in pristine and roughened Cu thin films by performing \textit{ab initio} molecular dynamics (AIMD) trajectories over 20~ps at temperatures of 218~K, 300~K, and 540~K on Cu thin film models, and then calculating the electron transport properties of the resulting snapshots at 100-fs intervals for the last 10~ps using the non-equilibrium Green's function formalism in combination with density functional theory (NEGF-DFT). As expected, higher temperatures induce larger atomic displacement from their equilibrium positions and increase atomic layer separation. We also find that increase in temperature results in increased resistance (lower conductance) for the pristine film, but less so for the roughened thin film where the surface roughness itself is the main source of resistance. This study provides insights into how pristine and roughened Cu thin films behave under thermal conditions, helping researchers design better treatments to mitigate thermal effects in ICs and their metal interconnects.

Title: Dynamical mean field approach to associative memory model with non-monotonic transfer functions
Authors: Yoshiyuki Kabashima, Kazushi Mimura
Abstract: The Hopfield associative memory model stores random patterns in synaptic couplings according to Hebb's rule and retrieves them through gradient descent on an energy function. This conventional setting, where neurons are assumed to have monotonic transfer functions, has been central to understanding associative memory. Morita (1993, Neural Netw. 6 115), however, showed that introducing non-monotonic transfer functions can dramatically enhance retrieval performance. While this phenomenon has been qualitatively examined, a full quantitative theory remains elusive due to the difficulty of analysis in the absence of an underlying energy function. In this work, we apply dynamical mean-field theory to the discrete-time synchronous retrieval dynamics of the non-monotonic model, which succeeds in accurately characterizing its macroscopic dynamical properties. We also derive conditions for retrieval states, and clarify their relation to previous studies. Our results provide new insights into the non-equilibrium retrieval dynamics of associative memory models.

Title: Magnetic field-tuned magnetic order and metamagnetic criticality in non-stoichiometric CeAuBi$_2$
Authors: Halyna Hodovanets, Hyunsoo Kim, Tristin Metz, Yasuyuki Nakajima, Christopher J. Eckberg, Kefeng Wang, Jie Yong, Shanta R. Saha, David Graf, Nichola P. Butch, Thomas Vojta, Johnpierre Paglione
Abstract: We present a detailed study of magnetization, resistivity, heat capacity, and X-ray and neutron powder diffraction measurements performed on single crystals of non-stoichiometric CeAuBi$_2$, Au deficiency 18$\%$, a strongly correlated antiferromagnet with Néel temperature T$_N$ = 13.2 K. Field-dependent magnetization measurements reveal a large magnetic anisotropy at low temperatures with an easy axis along the crystallographic c-axis, in which direction a spin-flop transition exhibits strong features in magnetization, specific heat, and resistivity at H$_c$ = 75 kOe. The constructed temperature-field phase diagram connects this transition to the suppression of magnetic order, which evolves from a second-order nature into a first-order transition that bifurcates at the spin-flop into three transitions below 1 K. The smoothed nature of the metamagnetic transitions in non-stoichiometric CeAuBi$_2$ is well described by an Ising model with weak quenched disorder, suggesting that the presence of Au vacancies is sufficient to smear the complex metamagnetic behavior and tune the critical behavior of magnetic order.

Title: Thickness dependent rare earth segregation in magnetron deposited NdCo$_{4.6}$ thin films studied by Xray reflectivity and Hard Xray photoemission
Authors: J. Díaz, J. Rodríguez-Fernández, J. Rubio-Zuazo
Abstract: Magnetic anisotropy in disordered rare-earth-transition metals (RE-TM) compounds arises from RE atoms occupying asymmetric environments within the TM lattice. However, the underlying mechanism that promotes such environments remains not fully understood. In this study, we investigate amorphous NdCo$_{4.6}$ thin films deposited by magnetron sputtering, where the magnetic anisotropy evolves with thickness from in-plane to out-of-plane orientation above 40 nm. X-ray reflectivity measurements revealed the progressive formation of an additional layer between the 3 nm Si capping layer and the NdCo film with increasing film thickness. To probe the composition and distribution of Co and Nd near the surface, Hard X-ray Photoemission Spectroscopy (HAXPES) was performed on films ranging from 5 nm to 65 nm in thickness using incident photon energies of 7, 10, and 13 keV. These correspond to inelastic electron mean free paths of 7.2-12.3 nm in cobalt. The cobalt atomic concentration, deduced from HAXPES at the Nd 3d and Co 2p excitations, was consistently below the nominal value and varied with both thickness and photon energy. This indicates segregation of RE atoms at the film surface, which becomes more pronounced with increasing thickness. Background analysis of the Co 2p and Nd 3d peaks supports this conclusion. The thickness of the Nd segregated layer is estimated in 2-3 nm. These findings demonstrate that incorporating neodymium into the cobalt lattice incurs an energy cost which is associated with strain due to the volume mismatch between the two elements. Reducing this strain energy promotes anisotropic atomic environments for Nd, thereby explaining the emergence of perpendicular anisotropy and its dependence on film thickness in these RE-TM compounds.

Title: Single-fluid model for rotating annular supersolids and its experimental implications
Authors: Niccolò Preti, Nicolò Antolini, Charles Drevon, Pietro Lombardi, Andrea Fioretti, Carlo Gabbanini, Giovanni Ferioli, Giovanni Modugno, Giulio Biagioni
Abstract: The famous two-fluid model of finite-temperature superfluids has been recently extended to describe the mixed classical-superfluid dynamics of the newly discovered supersolid phase of matter. We show that for rigidly rotating supersolids one can derive a more appropriate single-fluid model, in which the seemingly classical and superfluid contributions to the motion emerge from a spatially varying phase of the global wavefunction. That allows to design experimental protocols to excite and detect the peculiar rotation dynamics of annular supersolids, including partially quantized supercurrents, in which each atom brings less than $\hbar$ unit of angular momentum. Our results are valid for a more general class of density-modulated superfluids.

Title: Emergent clusters in strongly confined systems
Authors: Pamud Akalanka Bethmage, Ryker Fish, Brennan Sprinkle, Michelle M. Driscoll
Abstract: Driven suspensions, where energy is input at a particle scale, are a framework for understanding general principles of out-of-equilibrium organization. A large number of simple interacting units can give rise to non-trivial structure and hierarchy. Rotationally driven colloidal particles are a particularly nice model system for exploring this pattern formation, as the dominant interaction between the particles is hydrodynamic. Here, we use experiments and large-scale simulations to explore how strong confinement alters dynamics and emergent structure at the particle scale in these driven suspensions. Surprisingly, we find that large-scale (many times the particle size) density fluctuations emerge as a result of confinement, and that these density fluctuations sensitively depend on the degree of confinement. We extract a characteristic length scale for these fluctuations, demonstrating that the simulations quantitatively reproduce the experimental pattern. Moreover, we show that these density fluctuations are a result of the large-scale recirculating flow generated by the rotating particles inside a sealed chamber. This surprising result shows that even when system boundaries are far away, they can cause qualitative changes to mesoscale structure and ordering.

Title: Lieb-Schultz-Mattis-Type and Laughlin-Type Argument for the Quantum Hall Effect in Lattice Fermions with Spiral Boundary Conditions
Authors: Masaaki Nakamura, Masanori Yamanaka
Abstract: We derive the condition for the occurrence of the integer quantum Hall effect in two-dimensional lattice systems with interactions, expressed as $\phi\nu-\rho\in\mathbb{Z}$, where $\phi$, $\nu$, and $\rho$ denote the magnetic flux, the Chern number, and the electron density, respectively. By employing spiral boundary conditions, which treat the system as an extended one-dimensional chain, this condition is obtained directly through a Lieb-Schultz-Mattis-type and Laughlin-type argument. This approach improves upon the preceding work based on conventional periodic boundary conditions, where the condition was derived indirectly with redundant system-size dependence. The key to this approach is that the spatial directions of the external force and the response can be systematically controlled by a factor of the system size.

Title: Plasmon excitations and their attenuation in dirty superconductors
Authors: Daniil K. Karuzin, Mikhail A. Skvortsov
Abstract: We develop a theory for the plasmon spectrum in dirty superconductors across the entire temperature range. Starting with the microscopic Keldysh sigma model description, we link the plasmon dispersion $\omega(q)$ to the optical conductivity $\sigma(\omega,T)$ of a superconductor, which requires analytical continuation to the lower half-plane of complex frequency. This approach reveals a discontinuity at the superconducting transition: a jump in both the real and imaginary parts of $\omega(q)$ at $T_c$. For any temperature below $T_c$, the plasmon dispersion terminates at a critical wave vector $q_c(T)$ where plasmons remains undamped, with weakly $T$-dependent $\omega[q_c(T)] \approx 2\Delta(0)$. Plasmons significantly attenuate only within a narrow 5% temperature window near $T_c$, with the propagating mode recovering at large $q$.

Title: Acoustoelectric Probing of Fractal Energy Spectra in Graphene/hBN Moiré Superlattices
Authors: Wenqing Song, Yicheng Mou, Qing Lan, Guorui Zhao, Zejing Guo, Jiaqi Liu, Tuoyu Zhao, Cheng Zhang, Wu Shi
Abstract: Moiré superlattices with long-range periodicity exhibit Hofstadter energy spectra under accessible magnetic fields, enabling the exploration of emergent quantum phenomena through a hierarchy of fractal states. However, higher-order features, located at elevated energies with narrow bandwidths, typically require high carrier densities and remain difficult to resolve using conventional electrical transport due to limited sensitivity and strong background conductivity. Here, we utilize acoustoelectric (AE) transport to probe high-order fractal states and the Hofstadter spectrum in graphene/hBN moiré superlattices. Surface acoustic waves on a ferroelectric LiNbO$_3$ substrate generate an AE voltage proportional to the derivative of electrical conductivity, significantly enhancing sensitivity to weak spectral features. Combined with substrate-induced high electron doping, this technique resolves fractal Brown-Zak oscillations up to the fifth-order and provides the first AE observation of the Hofstadter butterfly, revealing high-order fractal magnetic Bloch states and symmetry-broken Landau levels over a wide carrier density range. Our results establish AE transport as a powerful derivative-sensitive probe for emergent fractal quantum states in moiré-engineered 2D systems.

Title: Topological Interface States and Nonlinear Thermoelectric Performance in Armchair Graphene Nanoribbon Heterostructures
Authors: David M T Kuo
Abstract: We investigate the emergence and topological nature of interface states (IFs) in N-AGNR/$(N-2)$-AGNR/N-AGNR heterostructure (AGNRH) segments lacking translational symmetry, focusing on their relation to the end states (ESs) of the constituent armchair graphene nanoribbon (AGNR) segments. For AGNRs with $R_1$-type unit cells, the ES numbers under a longitudinal electric field follow the relations $N = N_{A(B)} \times 6 + 1$ and $N = N_{A(B)} \times 6 + 3$, whereas $R_2$-type unit cells exhibit $(N_{A(B)} + 1)$ ESs. The subscripts $A$ and $B$ denote the chirality types of the ESs. The Stark effect lifts ES degeneracy and enables clear spectral separation between ESs and IFs. Using a real-space bulk boundary perturbation approach, we show that opposite-chirality states hybridize through junction-site perturbations and may shift out of the bulk gap. The number and chirality of IFs in symmetric AGNRHs are determined by the difference between the ESs of the outer and central segments, $N_O$ and $N_C$, according to $N_{IF,\beta} = |N_{O,B(A)} - N_{C,A(B)}|$, where $\beta$ labels the chirality. Depending on whether $N_O > N_C$ or $N_C > N_O$, the resulting IFs acquire B- or A-chirality, respectively. Calculated transmission spectra ${\cal T}_{GNR}(\varepsilon)$ reveal that AGNRHs host a topological double quantum dot (TDQD) when IFs originate from the ESs of the central AGNR segment. Using an Anderson model with effective intra-dot and inter-dot Coulomb interactions, we derive an analytical expression for the tunneling current through the TDQD via a closed-form transmission coefficient. Thermoelectric analysis shows that TDQDs yield enhanced nonlinear power output in the electron-dilute and hole-dilute charge states, with Coulomb blockade suppressing thermal current but not thermal voltage.

Title: Magnetic Structures Database from Symmetry-aided High-Throughput Calculations
Authors: Hanjing Zhou, Yuxuan Mu, Dingwen Zhang, Hangbing Chu, Erjun Kan, Chun-Gang Duan, Di Wang, Huimei Liu, Xin-Gao Gong, Xiangang Wan
Abstract: Magnetic structures, which play a central role in determining their physical properties, are known for only very limited compounds. Traditional theoretical approaches to predicting magnetic structures predominantly rely on first-principles calculations. A key challenge of these methods is their requirement for initial magnetic configurations as inputs, which theoretically possess infinite possibilities. In this work, we introduce a strategy based on irreducible representation basis vectors that effectively narrows down the vast space of potential magnetic configurations to a finite set, typically comprising around 20 candidates per material. Despite this significant reduction, the compact input sets generated by our method already encompass the experimental magnetic structures for 253 out of 302 benchmark materials (83.8%) from the MAGNDATA database. These materials have propagation vectors q=0 and unit cells containing up to 40 atoms, all within the Landau framework. Subsequent first-principles calculations correctly identify the magnetic structure in 198 of these cases. We further apply our highly efficient method to 8,422 stoichiometric transition-metal compounds with fewer than 30 atoms per unit cell in the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database, and establish a magnetic structure database containing 2,906 magnetic materials. To demonstrate its utility, we use this database for the systematic exploration of magnetic topological phases and altermagnets, identifying 1,070 and 392 candidate materials, respectively.

Title: The Zubarev Double Time Greens function-A Vintage Many Body Technique
Authors: Vijay Singh, Shraddha Singh
Abstract: These lecture notes present a comprehensive and powerful many-body technique pioneered in 1960 by D. N. Zubarev. The technique, known as the Zubarev Double Time Greens Function method, was used extensively by leading solid state physicists such as John Hubbard and Laura Roth in the 1960s. We present the technique and apply it to the non-interacting electron and boson gas. We next consider the (many-body) Hubbard model and show how it yields the Stoner criterion for ferromagnetism. It is easily extendable to superconductivity and related problems. Our treatment is pedagogical and understandable to those with just an elementary understanding of second quantization.

Title: Bound States from Berry Curvature and Chiral Superconductivity
Authors: Daniil Karuzin, Zhiyu Dong, Leonid Levitov
Abstract: Motivated by the discovery of exotic superconductivity in rhombohedral graphene, we study the two-body problem in electronic bands endowed with Berry curvature and show that it supports chiral, non-$s$-wave bound states with nonzero angular momentum. In the presence of a Fermi sea, these interactions give rise to a chiral pairing problem featuring multiple superconducting phases that break time-reversal symmetry. These phases form a cascade of chiral topological states with different angular momenta, where the order-parameter phase winds by $2\pi m$ around the Fermi surface, with $m = 1,3,5,\ldots$, and the succession of phases is governed by the Berry-curvature flux through the Fermi-sea area, $\Phi = b k_F^2/2$. As $\Phi$ increases, the system undergoes a sequence of first-order phase transitions between distinct chiral phases, occurring nearly periodically in $\Phi$ with period two. This realizes a quantum-geometry analog of the Little-Parks effect -- oscillations in $T_c$ that provide a clear and experimentally accessible hallmark of chiral superconducting order.

Title: Elasticity without a reference state: continuum mechanics of active tension nets
Authors: Nikolas H. Claussen, Fridtjof Brauns, Boris I. Shraiman
Abstract: A constitutive relation between stress and strain relative to a reference state is the basic assumption of elasticity theory. However, in living matter, stress is governed by (motor molecule) activity rather than a constitutive law. What paradigm takes the place of elasticity in this setting? Here, we derive a continuum theory of active mechanics by taking the continuum limit of the Active Tension Network model of 2d epithelia. Instead of a reference state, we start from a prescribed active force configuration, encoded in a Riemannian "tension metric". Intuitively, one expects cells to adjust their positions to achieve force balance by rearranging local sources of active stress. More precisely, the cell positions define an embedding of the tension metric into 2d physical space, which determines the macroscopic physical stress. For free boundaries, tissue adopts a certain intrinsically defined shape, the force-balanced embedding with minimal internal stress. Boundary forces then deform this embedding. The resulting stress transformation yields an effective stress-strain relation. Key elements of elasticity hence emerge from a "stress-only" starting point, explaining how tissue shape can be adiabatically controlled by active stress during morphogenesis. Plastic behavior arises from topological cell rearrangement, which we represent by a continuous reparameterization of the tension metric, providing a principled continuum theory of emergent elasto-plastic flow. To express this physics, we use the mathematics of isothermal coordinates and quasi-conformal maps. An explicit coarse-graining study, described in a companion paper, substantiates the results of our continuum analysis. The present theory elucidates the unconventional mechanics of living tissues and may apply to 2d active and granular materials more generally.

Title: Resolving Overlapping EBSD Patterns by Experiment -- Simulation Residuals Analysis
Authors: Grzegorz Cios, Aimo Winkelmann, Tomasz Tokarski, Wiktor Bednarczyk, Piotr Bała
Abstract: In the technique of Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD), the accurate detection and identification of different phases existing in a sample is often limited by overlapping Kikuchi diffraction patterns originating from the extended probing volume of the individual EBSD map points measured in the scanning electron microscope (SEM). We present an iterative approach that uses simulated Kikuchi patterns to resolve several overlapping diffraction signals. For each measured EBSD pattern, our method first identifies the best-fit simulated Kikuchi pattern using dynamic template matching. This simulated, ideal reference pattern is then further processed to optimally match the experimental image, uncovering any underlying weaker signals after subtraction. Repeatedly utilizing dynamic template matching and pattern subtraction on residual signals of subsequent steps enables the identification of minor phases that might otherwise be missed from the probing volume of the EBSD map point. This method significantly improves phase detection in complex materials, addressing a key limitation of conventional EBSD analysis that conventionally assigns a single phase to each map point. The present method does not require a known orientation relationship between the phases of the overlapping patterns or close neighbor experimental patterns like previously published approaches.

Title: Nanodroplet-Confined Electroplating Enables Submicron Printing of Metals and Oxide Ceramics
Authors: Mirco Nydegger, Rebecca A. Gallivan, Arthur Barras, Henning Galinski, Ralph Spolenak
Abstract: The fabrication of functional micro- and nano-electronic devices requires the deposition of high-quality materials of different electronic material classes, such as conductors, semiconductors and insulators. To establish ultra-high-resolution additive manufacturing as a viable addition to existing fabrication methods requires the combinatorial additive deposition of different electronic material classes. However, current techniques do not provide such a capability. Here, we demonstrate that droplet confined electroplating, an ultra-high-resolution AM technique initially developed for metals as electrohydrodynamic redox printing (EHD-RP), allows not only the direct deposition of many metals, but also of metal-oxides. Particularly, we demonstrate that applying fundamental electrochemical principles in combination with on-the-fly switching of the deposited material allows for the direct co-deposition of metals, metal-hydroxides and -oxides. Our results exemplify the feasibility of leveraging simple water-based electrochemical concepts to produce intricate and multi-material structures at the nanoscale.

Title: Above Room Temperature Ferroelectricity in Epitaxially Strained KTaO3
Authors: Tobias Schwaigert, Salva Salmani-Rezaie, Sankalpa Hazra, Utkarsh Saha, Maya Ramesh, Aiden Ross, Betul Pamuk, Long-Qing Chen, David A. Muller, Darrell G. Schlom, Venkatraman Gopalan, Kaveh Ahadi
Abstract: Epitaxial strain is a powerful means to engineer emergent phenomena in thin films and heterostructures. Here, we demonstrate that KTaO3, a cubic perovskite in bulk form, can be epitaxially strained into a highly tunable ferroelectric. KTaO3 films grown commensurate to SrTiO3 (001) substrates experience an in-plane strain of -2.1 % that transforms the cubic structure into a tetragonal polar phase with transition temperature of 475 K, consistent with our thermodynamic calculations. We show that the Curie temperature and the spontaneous electric polarization can be system- atically controlled with epitaxial strain. Scanning transmission electron microscopy reveals cooperative polar displacements of the potassium columns with respect to the neighboring tantalum columns at room temperature. Optical second-harmonic generation results are described by a tetragonal polar point group (4mm), indicating the emergence of a global polar ground state. We observe a ferroelectric hysteresis response, using metal-insulator-metal capacitor test structures. The results demon- strate a robust intrinsic ferroelectric state in epitaxially strained KTaO3 thin films.

Title: Resolving the band alignment of InAs/InAsSb mid-wave-infrared type-II superlattices
Authors: Michał Rygała, Julian Zanon, Anderas Bader, Tristan Smołka, Fabian Hartmann, Sven Höfling, Michael Flatté, Marcin Motyka
Abstract: In this work, three InAs/InAs$_{0.65}$Sb$_{0.35}$ superlattices with different periods were investigated using photoluminescence and photoreflectance measurements and their band structure was simulated using a 14 bulk-band kp model. The structures were studied by analyzing the evolution of the spectral features in temperature and excitation power to determine the origin of optical transitions. After identifying which of these are related to the superlattice mini-bands, a rich collection of observed higher-order optical transitions was compared with refractive-index calculations. This procedure was used to adjust the parameters of the theoretical model, namely the bowing parameters of the InAsSb valence band offset and bandgap. It was also shown that the spectroscopy of the higher-order states combined with numerical modeling of the refractive index is a powerful tool for improvement of the material parameters, presenting a new approach to material studies of advanced semiconductor heterostructures.

Title: Weak Electron-Phonon Coupling Is Insufficient to Generate Significant CISS in Two-Terminal Transport
Authors: Vipul Upadhyay, Amikam Levy
Abstract: A central open question in chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS) is whether weak electron-phonon coupling in a helical molecular junction can generate a sizable spin polarization in two-terminal transport without invoking additional strong symmetry-breaking ingredients. We address this question by implementing a self-consistent nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) calculation for a helical tight-binding model with spin-orbit coupling and electron-phonon interactions. The electron-phonon self-energies are evaluated self-consistently, and the transport signal is extracted using the standard magnetization-reversal protocol with a spin-polarized analyzer lead. We benchmark a fully self-consistent NEGF within the self-consistent Born approximation (SCBA) treatment for both global and local electron-phonon couplings against commonly used approximations, including diagonal self-energy schemes. We quantify how the resulting transport regime and spin polarization depend on phonon frequency, coupling strength, bias, temperature, and system size. In contrast to large polarizations and anomalous size trends reported under approximate treatments, the fully self-consistent calculation yields negligible spin polarization, additionally the electron-phonon coupling mainly renormalizes the spectrum, and transport remains quasi-ballistic across the explored parameter range.

Title: Cooperative stabilization of persistent currents in superfluid ring networks
Authors: Marzena Ciszak, Nicola Grani, Diego Hernandez-Rajkov, Giulia Del Pace, Giacomo Roati, Francesco Marino
Abstract: Cooperative effects in oscillator networks are often associated with enhanced stability of phase-locked solutions, which increases with system size. We show that the stabilization of persistent currents in annular atomic superfluids with periodic barriers is a concrete manifestation of this phenomenon. Under the simplifying assumption of continuity of atomic flow across identical barriers, the system reduces to a ring of locally coupled Kuramoto-like oscillators. We analytically derive the stability diagram of phase-locked configurations and quantify their robustness to noise and small random initial imperfections, finding excellent agreement with experimental observations. These results are inherent to the ring topology and independent of the specific physical platform.

Title: Third-quantized master equations as a classical Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process
Authors: Léonce Dupays
Abstract: Third quantization is used in open quantum systems to construct a superoperator basis in which quadratic Lindbladians can be turned into a normal form. From it follows the spectral properties of the Lindbladian, including eigenvalues and eigenvectors. However, the connection between third quantization and the semiclassical representations usually employed to obtain the dynamics of open quantum systems remains opaque. We introduce an alternative basis for third quantization that bridges this gap between third quantization and the $Q$ representation by projecting the master equation onto a superoperator coherent-state basis. The equation of motion reduces to a multidimensional complex Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.

Title: Entropy-based analysis of single-qubit Otto and Carnot heat engines
Authors: Andrés Vallejo, Catty Lissardy, Santiago Silva-Gallo, Alejandro Romanelli, Raul Donangelo
Abstract: From an entropy-based formulation of the first law of thermodynamics in the quantum regime, we investigate the performance of Otto-like and Carnot-like engines for a single-qubit working medium. Within this framework, the first law includes an additional contribution -- coherence work -- that quantifies the energetic cost of deviating the quantum trajectory from its natural unitary evolution. We focus on the efficiency of the heat-to-coherence work conversion and show that the Carnot cycle achieves the classical Carnot efficiency, while the performance of the Otto cycle is upper-bounded by the Carnot efficiency corresponding to the extreme temperatures of the cycle. We identify entropy generation during the isochoric stages as the key source of irreversibility limiting the Otto cycle's efficiency.

Title: Generalized Symmetries From Fusion Actions
Authors: Chongying Dong, Siu-Hung Ng, Li Ren, Feng Xu
Abstract: Let $A$ be a condensable algebra in a modular tensor category $\mathcal{C}$. We define an action of the fusion category $\mathcal{C}_A$ of $A$-modules in $\mathcal{C}$ on the morphism space $\mbox{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}}(x,A)$ for any $x$ in $\mathcal{C}$, whose characters are generalized Frobenius-Schur indicators. This fusion action can be considered on $A$, and we prove a categorical generalization of the Schur-Weyl duality for this action. For any fusion subcategory $\mathcal{B}$ of $\mathcal{C}_A$ containing all the local $A$-modules, we prove the invariant subobject $B=A^\mathcal{B}$ is a condensable subalgebra of $A$. The assignment of $\mathcal{B}$ to $A^\mathcal{B}$ defines a Galois correspondence between this kind of fusion subcategories of $\mathcal{C}_A$ and the condensable subalgebras of $A$. In the context of VOAs, we prove for any nice VOAs $U \subset A$, $U=A^{\mathcal{C}_A}$ where $\mathcal{C}=\mathcal{M}_U$ is the category of $U$-modules. In particular, if $U = A^G$ for some finite automorphism group $G$ of $A,$ the fusion action of $\mathcal{C}_A$ on $A$ is equivalent to the $G$-action on $A.$

Title: Non-stabilizerness in quantum-enhanced metrological protocols
Authors: Tanausú Hernández-Yanes, Piotr Sierant, Jakub Zakrzewski, Marcin Płodzień
Abstract: Non-stabilizerness (colloquially "magic") characterizes genuinely quantum (beyond-Clifford) operations necessary for preparation of quantum states, and can be measured by stabilizer Rényi entropy (SRE). For permutationally symmetric states, we show that the SRE depends, for sufficiently large systems, only on a constant number of expectation values of collective spin operators. This compact description is leveraged for analysis of spin-squeezing protocols, which inherently generate non-stabilizerness. Under one-axis twisting (OAT), the generation of optimal squeezing is accompanied by a logarithmic divergence of SRE with system system size. Continued time evolution under OAT produces metrologically useful "kitten" states-superpositions of rotated GHZ states-that feature many-body Bell correlations but exhibit a smaller, system-size-independent SRE that decreases with increasing Bell-correlation strength. Our results reveal connections between non-stabilizerness, multipartite correlations, and quantum metrology, and provide a practical route to quantify non-stabilizerness in experiments for precision sensing.

Abstract: We explore the thermodynamics of quantum processes (quantum channels) by axiomatically introducing the free energy for channels, defined via the quantum relative entropy with an absolutely thermal channel whose fixed output is in equilibrium with a thermal reservoir. This definition finds strong support through its operational interpretations in designated quantum information and thermodynamic tasks. We construct a resource theory of athermality for quantum processes, where free operations are Gibbs preserving superchannels and golden units are unitary channels with respect to absolutely thermal channel having fully degenerate output Hamiltonian. We exactly characterize the one-shot distillation and formation of quantum channels using hypothesis-testing and max-relative entropy with respect to the absolutely thermal channel. These rates converge asymptotically to the channel free energy (up to a multiplicative factor of half the inverse temperature), establishing its operational meaning and proving the asymptotic reversibility of the athermality. We show the direct relation between the resource theory of athermality and quantum information tasks such as private randomness and purity distillation, and thermodynamic tasks of erasure and work extraction. Our work connects the core thermodynamic concepts of free energy, energy, entropy, and maximal extractable work of quantum processes to their information processing capabilities.

Title: Comparing the latent features of universal machine-learning interatomic potentials
Authors: Sofiia Chorna, Davide Tisi, Cesare Malosso, Wei Bin How, Michele Ceriotti, Sanggyu Chong
Abstract: The past few years have seen the development of ``universal'' machine-learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs) capable of approximating the ground-state potential energy surface across a wide range of chemical structures and compositions with reasonable accuracy. While these models differ in the architecture and the dataset used, they share the ability to compress a staggering amount of chemical information into descriptive latent features. Herein, we systematically analyze what the different uMLIPs have learned by quantitatively assessing the relative information content of their latent features with feature reconstruction errors, and observing how the trends are affected by the choice of training set and training protocol. We find that uMLIPs encode the chemical space in significantly distinct ways, with substantial cross-model feature reconstruction errors. When variants of the same model architecture are considered, trends become dependent on the dataset, target, and training protocol of choice. We also observe that fine-tuning of a uMLIP retains a strong pre-training bias in the latent features. Finally, we discuss how atom-level features, which are directly output by MLIPs, can be compressed into global structure-level features via concatenation of progressive cumulants, each adding significantly new information about the variability across the atomic environments within a given system.

Title: Madelung hydrodynamics of spin-orbit coupling: action principles, currents, and correlations
Authors: Cesare Tronci
Abstract: We exploit the variational and Hamiltonian structures of quantum hydrodynamics with spin to unfold the correlation and torque mechanisms accompanying spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in electronic motion. Using Hamilton's action principle for the Pauli equation, we isolate SOC-induced quantum forces that act on the orbital Madelung--Bohm trajectories and complement the usual force terms known to appear in quantum hydrodynamics with spin. While the latter spin-hydrodynamic forces relate to the quantum geometric tensor (QGT), SOC-induced orbital forces originate from a particular current operator that contributes prominently to the spin current. This distinction between force terms reveals two fundamentally different mechanisms generating quantum spin-orbit correlations. Leveraging the Hamiltonian structure of the hydrodynamic system, we also elucidate spin transport features such as the correlation-induced quantum torques and the current shift in the spin Hall effect. This Hall shift leads to a new definition of the transport spin current thereby addressing an open question in spintronics. Finally, we illustrate the framework via the Madelung--Rashba equations for planar SOC configurations and propose a particle-based scheme for numerical implementation.

Abstract: Accurate determination of transition states is central to an understanding of reaction kinetics. Double-endpoint methods where both initial and final states are specified, such as the climbing image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB), identify the minimum energy path between the two and thereby the saddle point on the energy surface that is relevant for the given transition, thus providing an estimate of the transition state within the harmonic approximation of transition state theory. Such calculations can, however, incur high computational costs and may suffer stagnation on exceptionally flat or rough energy surfaces. Conversely, methods that only require specification of an initial set of atomic coordinates, such as the minimum mode following (MMF) method, offer efficiency but can converge on saddle points that are not relevant for transition of interest. Here, we present an adaptive hybrid algorithm that integrates the CI-NEB with the MMF method so as to get faster convergence to the relevant saddle point. The method is benchmarked for the Baker-Chan (BC) saddle point test set using the PET-MAD machine-learned potential as well as 59 transitions of a heptamer island on Pt(111) from the OptBench benchmark set. A Bayesian analysis of the performance shows a median reduction in energy and force calculations of 46% [95% CrI: -55%, -37%] relative to CI-NEB for the BC set, while a 28% reduction is found for the transitions of the heptamer island. These results establish this hybrid method as a highly effective tool for high-throughput automated chemical discovery of atomic rearrangements.
