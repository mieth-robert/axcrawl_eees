Title: Lattice Regularization of Non-relativistic Interacting Fermions in One Dimension
Authors: Zihan Li, Son T. Nguyen
Abstract: Few-body physics plays a central role in many branches of physics, such as nuclear physics and atomic physics. Advances in controlling ultra-cold quantum gases provide an ideal testbed for few-body physics theory. In this work, we study few-body systems consisting of two distinct species of non-relativistic fermions in one spatial dimension using both field theory and lattice methods. Particles of the same type do not interact with each other, but particles of different types can interact via an attractive contact interaction. We first study the dependence of the coupling of a contact interaction on the lattice spacing. Using this input, we extract two-, three-, and four-body ground state energies in the infinite length limit and benchmark them against the calculations from the continuum field theory. This work enables us to systematically study the effect of discretization and finite-length artifacts on few-body observables.

Title: The thermodynamics of liquid-vapor coexistence for a van der Waals fluid. Analytical solution of the Clausius-Clapeyron equation
Authors: J. L. Cardoso, V. G. Ibarra-Sierra, J. C. Sandoval-Santana, A. Kunold
Abstract: This work presents a pedagogical derivation of the thermodynamics of a van der Waals fluid by explicitly incorporating pairwise molecular interactions and the finite size of particles into the statistical-mechanical description. Starting from the Lennard-Jones potential, we evaluate the second virial coefficient to infer the virial expansion of the equation of state and recover the van der Waals equation using only its leading correction. The corresponding partition function allows us to obtain all thermodynamic potentials for both monoatomic and diatomic fluids in a transparent and instructive manner. Building on this framework, we formulate and solve analytically the Clausius-Clapeyron equation in the vicinity of the critical point, obtaining the liquid-vapor coexistence curve in closed form. This approach not only clarifies the microscopic origin of van der Waals thermodynamics but also complements-and in several aspects improves upon-traditional treatments that rely heavily on numerical methods or heuristic arguments. In addition, because the van der Waals equation naturally predicts the liquid-vapor equilibrium, the existence of critical points, and the functional form of the saturation curve of the pressure as a function of temperature, it provides an analytically tractable framework for studying a 150-year-old problem that has historically been addressed using graphical constructions or numerical solutions. As such, the formulation developed here offers a coherent, accessible, and conceptually unified route for students and instructors to understand phase coexistence in simple fluids from first principles.

Title: Altermagnetic and dipolar splitting of magnons in FeF$_2$
Authors: J. Sears, V. O. Garlea, D. Lederman, J. M. Tranquada, I. A. Zaliznyak
Abstract: FeF$_2$ is a prototypical rutile antiferromagnet recently proposed as an altermagnet, with a magnetic symmetry that permits spin-split electronic bands and chiral magnons. Using very-high-resolution inelastic neutron scattering on a single crystal of FeF$_2$, we show that the dominant source of magnon splitting is in fact the long-range dipolar interaction rather than altermagnetic exchange terms. At momenta where the dipolar splitting vanishes, we observe additional broadening due to altermagnetic chiral splitting and estimate this splitting to be $\sim$35 $\mu$eV. Polarized measurements further reveal that, where dipolar splitting is present, the chiral magnon modes become mixed and the resulting modes are predominantly linearly polarized, with at most a small chiral component. These findings highlight the significant effect of dipolar interactions on magnon chirality, particularly when altermagnetic interactions are weak.

Title: Fluctuation conductivity in ultraclean multicomponent superconductors
Authors: Sondre Duna Lundemo, Asle Sudbø
Abstract: We consider the intrinsic fluctuation conductivity in metals with multiply sheeted Fermi surfaces approaching a superconducting critical point. Restricting our attention to extreme type-II multicomponent superconductors motivates focusing on the ultraclean limit. Using functional-integral techniques, we derive the Gaussian fluctuation action from which we obtain the gauge-invariant electromagnetic linear response kernel. This allows us to compute the optical conductivity tensor. We identify essential conditions required for a nonzero longitudinal conductivity at finite frequencies in a disorder-free and translationally invariant system. Specifically, this is neither related to impurity scattering nor electron-phonon interaction, but derives indirectly from the multicomponent character of the incipient superconducting order and the parent metallic state. Under these conditions, the enhancement of the DC conductivity due to fluctuations close to the critical point follows the same critical behaviour as in the diffusive limit.

Title: Unifying Kibble-Zurek Mechanism in Weakly Driven Processes
Authors: Pierre Nazé
Abstract: A description of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism with linear response theory has been done previously, but ad hoc hypotheses were used, like the use of the rate-dependent impulse window via the Zurek equation in the context of no driving in the relaxation time. In this work, I present a new framework where such hypotheses are unnecessary, preserving all the characteristics of the phenomenon. The Kibble-Zurek scaling obtained for the excess work is close to 2/5, a result that holds for open and thermally isolated systems whose relaxation time diverges at the critical point and the first zero of the relaxation function is finite. I exemplify the results using four different but significant types of scaling functions.

Title: Scalable cold-atom quantum simulator of a $3+1$D U$(1)$ lattice gauge theory with dynamical matter
Authors: Simone Orlando, Guo-Xian Su, Bing Yang, Jad C. Halimeh
Abstract: The stated overarching goal of the highly active field of quantum simulation of high-energy physics (HEP) is to achieve the capability to study \textit{ab-initio} real-time microscopic dynamics of $3+1$D quantum chromodynamics (QCD). However, existing experimental realizations and theoretical proposals for future ones have remained restricted to one or two spatial dimensions. Here, we take a big step towards this goal by proposing a concrete experimentally feasible scalable cold-atom quantum simulator of a U$(1)$ quantum link model of quantum electrodynamics (QED) in three spatial dimensions, employing \textit{linear gauge protection} to stabilize gauge invariance. Using tree tensor network simulations, we benchmark the performance of this quantum simulator through near- and far-from-equilibrium observables, showing excellent agreement with the ideal gauge theory. Additionally, we introduce a method for \textit{analog quantum error mitigation} that accounts for unwanted first-order tunneling processes, vastly improving agreement between quantum-simulator and ideal-gauge-theory results. Our findings pave the way towards realistic quantum simulators of $3+1$D lattice gauge theories that can probe regimes well beyond classical simulability.

Title: Energy-Time-Accuracy Tradeoffs in Thermodynamic Computing
Authors: Alberto Rolandi, Paolo Abiuso, Patryk Lipka-Bartosik, Maxwell Aifer, Patrick J. Coles, Martí Perarnau-Llobet
Abstract: In the paradigm of thermodynamic computing, instead of behaving deterministically, hardware undergoes a stochastic process in order to sample from a distribution of interest. While it has been hypothesized that thermodynamic computers may achieve better energy efficiency and performance, a theoretical characterization of the resource cost of thermodynamic computations is still lacking. Here, we analyze the fundamental trade-offs between computational accuracy, energy dissipation, and time in thermodynamic computing. Using geometric bounds on entropy production, we derive general limits on the energy-delay-deficiency product (EDDP), a stochastic generalization of the traditional energy-delay product (EDP). While these limits can in principle be saturated, the corresponding optimal driving protocols require full knowledge of the final equilibrium distribution, i.e., the solution itself. To overcome this limitation, we develop quasi-optimal control schemes that require no prior information of the solution and demonstrate their performance for matrix inversion in overdamped quadratic systems. The derived bounds extend beyond this setting to more general potentials, being directly relevant to recent proposals based on non-equilibrium Langevin dynamics.

Title: Fast Phase Logic Family for Achieving Very Large Scale Integration in Superconductor Electronics
Authors: Sasan Razmkhah, Massoud Pedram
Abstract: Fast Phase Logic (FPL) is a novel digital superconductor electronic (SCE) logic family specifically designed to address critical challenges in state-of-the-art SCE, such as low device density and integration levels. The FPL family improves circuit performance by employing various Josephson junction (JJ) structures, including high-$J_c$ self-shunted 0-JJ stacks, $\pi$-JJs, and 0/$\pi$-JJ stacks. FPL utilizes 0- and $\pi$-JJs to replace the bulky geometric inductors required in single flux quantum (SFQ) logic families like RSFQ. The proposed FPL family can deliver up to two orders of magnitude improvement in integration density over RSFQ logic with a five-fold reduction in the bias current requirements. Circuit performance is enhanced with reduced latency and increased throughput. Furthermore, the FPL family provides a higher output voltage level and higher impedance, which better match those of CMOS circuits. The much smaller flux storage loops in FPL greatly reduce susceptibility to trapped flux and crosstalk. Advancements in fabrication processes that would further benefit FPL implementation include the use of NbTiN-based JJs with higher critical current density and fabrication temperature range up to 400~$^\circ$C, or the use of stacked JJ structures. The resulting increased density makes very large-scale integration (VLSI) more practical. The FPL family has the potential to significantly advance SCE technology. Near-term applications are envisioned in accelerator cores for signal processing and artificial intelligence, with long-term potential in supercomputing applications. The advantages of FPL were demonstrated through an architectural study of a fast Fourier transform (FFT) circuit, comparing it with CMOS and SFQ technologies.

Title: Interactive Analysis of Static, Dynamic, and Crystalline SDTrimSP Simulations: Application to Nitrogen Ion Implantation into Vanadium
Authors: Miroslav Lebeda, Jan Drahokoupil, Vojtěch Smola, Petr Vlčák
Abstract: SDTrimSP is a widely used Monte Carlo simulation code based on the Binary Collision Approximation (BCA) for modeling ion implantation and ion-solid interaction processes. While an established graphical user interface (GUI) exists for simulation setup and execution, efficient post-processing, comparison of multiple simulations, and preparation of specific input file parameters remain limited. In this work, we present a web-based interface (this http URL) that complements existing SDTrimSP tools by focusing on interactive visualization and analysis of depth distribution profiles. The platform enables direct upload and comparison of static and fluence-dependent dynamic profiles, supports unit conversion, and provides an integrated calculator for determining the adjustable atomic density parameter of implanted ions required in dynamic simulations. In addition, the interface offers automated conversion of standard crystallographic file formats into the SDTrimSP-specific crystal structure input format for simulations into crystalline targets. The capabilities of the interface are demonstrated for nitrogen ion implantation into vanadium, including amorphous static and dynamic simulations and static crystalline simulations for different surface orientations. The results illustrate fluence-dependent saturation effects as well as orientation-dependent ion channeling behavior. Overall, the presented web-based tool provides a convenient and flexible extension to existing SDTrimSP workflows.

Title: Oxygen in diamond: thermal stability of ST1 spin centres and creation of oxygen-pair complexes
Authors: Paul Neugebauer, Xinxi Huang, Chloe Newsom, Christophe Arnold, Hjørdis Martelock, Séverine Diziain, Edoardo Monnetti, Jocelyn Achard, Tobias Lühmann, Paolo Olivero, Jan Meijer, Julien Barjon, Alexandre Tallaire, Sébastien Pezzagna
Abstract: Little is known about oxygen-related defects in diamond. Recently, the promising room-temperature spin centre named ST1 was identified as an oxygen centre, but of still unknown atomic structure and thermal stability. In this work, we report on the optically active oxygen-related centres and the conditions for their formation, using ion implantation of oxygen in various conditions of depth and fluence. More specifically, we establish the temperature formation/stability range of the ST1 centre, which has a maximum at about 1100°C and is narrower than for NV centres. In these conditions, optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) on small ST1 ensembles was measured with a spin readout contrast of > 20% at 300K. In cathodoluminescence, the 535 nm ST1 peak is not observed. Besides, a broad peak centred at 460 nm is measured for implantation of O$_2$ molecular ions. For an annealing temperature of 1500°C, a different centre is formed (with ZPL at 584.5 nm) with an intensity increasing with a power law 1.5 < p < 1.9 dependence from the implantation fluence. This suggests that this centre contains two oxygen atoms. Besides, a new spectral feature associated to an intrinsic defect was also observed, with four prominent lines (especially at 594nm). Finally, the thermal formation and stability of oxygen centres in diamond presented here are important for the identification of the atomic structure of defects such as the ST1 and possible O$_2$V$_x$ complex by means of ab initio calculations. Indeed, the formation energies and charge states of defect centres are easier to compute than the full energy level scheme, which to date still remains unsuccessful regarding the ST1 centre.

Title: Hidden dynamics in fast force curves: Transient Damping and Brownian-Driven Contact Resonance
Authors: Roger Proksch
Abstract: Force distance curves (FCs) are among the most direct measurements performed in atomic force microscopy (AFM), yet their information content is often reduced by filtering and quasi-static interpretation. Here, enabled by a new interferometric detector, we show that fast FCs inherently excite short-lived cantilever oscillations whose transient frequency and decay encode local stiffness and dissipation. By analyzing these dynamics on a single-curve, single-pixel basis, we extract time-local mechanical information without external broadband excitation or multi-pass imaging. We develop a state-dependent single-mode harmonic oscillator model that captures snap-in excitation, hydration-mediated dissipation, and contact stiffness during fast force mapping. Experimental analysis of high-bandwidth force-curve data and numerical simulations demonstrate that multiple dynamically distinct interaction regimes occur within a single FC. Accessing these transient dynamics enables high-throughput, high-resolution mapping of mechanical contrast and reveals heterogeneous and non-repeatable behaviors that are lost under conventional averaging or with conventional detection schemes with higher noise floors.

Title: Mesoscale flows in active baths dictate the dynamics of semi-flexible filaments
Authors: Bipul Biswas, Devadyouti Das, Manasa Kandula, Shuang Zhou
Abstract: Semi-flexible filaments in living systems are constantly driven by active forces that often organize into mesoscale coherent flows. Although theory and simulations predict rich filament dynamics, experimental studies of passive filaments in collective active baths remain scarce. Here we present an experimental study on passive colloidal filaments confined to the air-liquid interface beneath a free-standing, quasi-two-dimensional bacterial film featuring jet-like mesoscale flows. By varying filament contour length and bacterial activity, we demonstrate that filament dynamics are governed by its length relative to the characteristic size of the bath. Filaments shorter than the jet width exhibit greatly enhanced translation and rotation with minimal deformation, while long filaments show dramatic deformation but less enhanced transport. We explain our findings through the competition between the active viscous drag of the bath and passive elastic resistance of the filaments, using a modified elastoviscous number that considers the mesoscale flows.

Title: Quantum Geometric Origin of Orbital Magnetization
Authors: Xiao-Bin Qiang, Tianyu Liu, Hai-Zhou Lu, X. C. Xie
Abstract: The exploration of the Riemannian structure of the Hilbert space has led to the concept of quantum geometry, comprising geometric quantities exemplified by Berry curvature and quantum metric. While this framework has profoundly advanced the understanding of various electronic phenomena, its potential for illuminating magnetic phenomena has remained less explored. In this Perspective, we highlight how quantum geometry paves a new way for understanding magnetization within a single-particle framework. We first elucidate the geometric origin of equilibrium magnetization in the modern theory of magnetization, then discuss the role of quantum geometry in kinetic magnetization, and finally outline promising future directions at the frontier of quantum geometric magnetization.

Title: SpectraFormer: an Attention-Based Raman Unmixing Tool for Accessing the Graphene Buffer-Layer Signature on SiC
Authors: Dmitriy Poteryayev, Pietro Novelli, Annalisa Coriolano, Riccardo Dettori, Valentina Tozzini, Fabio Beltram, Massimiliano Pontil, Antonio Rossi, Stiven Forti, Camilla Coletti
Abstract: Raman spectroscopy is a key tool for graphene characterization, yet its application to graphene grown on silicon carbide (SiC) is strongly limited by the intense and variable second-order Raman response of the substrate. This limitation is critical for buffer layer graphene, a semiconducting interfacial phase, whose vibrational signatures are overlapped with the SiC background and challenging to be reliably accessed using conventional reference-based subtraction, due to strong spatial and experimental variability of the substrate signal. Here we present SpectraFormer, a transformer-based deep learning model that reconstructs the SiC Raman substrate contribution directly from post-growth partially masked spectroscopic data without relying on explicit reference measurements. By learning global correlations across the entire Raman shift range, the model captures the statistical structure of the SiC background and enables accurate reconstruction of its contribution in mixed spectra. Subtraction of the reconstructed substrate signal reveals weak vibrational features associated with ZLG that are inaccessible through conventional analysis methods. The extracted spectra are validated by ab initio vibrational calculations, allowing assignment of the resolved features to specific modes and confirming their physical consistency. By leveraging a state-of-the-art attention-based deep learning architecture, this approach establishes a robust, reference-free framework for Raman analysis of graphene on SiC and provides a foundation, compatible with real-time data acquisition, to its integration into automated, closed-loop AI-assisted growth optimization.

Title: Dynamical instability in a Floquet-Driven Dissipative System
Authors: Takuya Okugawa, Jens Paaske, Martin Eckstein, Michael A. Sentef, Angel Rubio, Andrew J. Millis
Abstract: We analyse the magnon spectrum and distribution function of the antiferromagnetic phase of the Floquet-driven Hubbard model. Above a critical drive strength, we find a dynamical instability, resulting from a change in sign of the magnon damping at a non-zero wavevector. The change in sign means that infinitesimal fluctuations grow with time, corresponding to an instability of the driven state. Implications for the nonequilibrium distribution function and the strong drive nonlinear dynamics are discussed.

Title: Discovery of Correlated Electron Molecular Orbital Materials using Graph Representations
Authors: Md. Rajbanul Akhond, Alexandru B. Georgescu
Abstract: Correlated electron molecular orbital (CEMO) materials host emergent electronic states built from molecular orbitals localized over clusters of transition metal ions, yet have historically been discovered sporadically and generally been treated as isolated case studies. Here we establish CEMO materials as a systematically discoverable class and introduce a graph-based framework to identify, classify, and organize transition-metal cluster motifs in inorganic solids. Starting from crystal structures in the Materials Project, we construct transition metal connectivity graphs, extract cluster motifs using a bond-cutting algorithm, and determine cluster point groups, effective cluster sublattice dimensionality, and translational symmetry. Applying this approach in a high-throughput screen of 34,548 compounds yields 5,306 cluster-containing materials, including 2,627 stable or metastable compounds with isolated clusters and 984 materials featuring mixed-metal clusters. The resulting dataset reveals symmetry and element-dependent trends in cluster formation. By integrating cluster classification with flat-band lattice topology and battery-relevant information, we provide further relevant information to multiple scientific communities. The accompanying open dataset, Cluster Finder software, and interactive web platform enable systematic exploration of cluster-driven electronic phenomena and establish a general pathway for discovering correlated quantum materials and functional materials with cluster-based or extended metal-metal bonding in inorganic solids.

Title: Anomalous Dynamical Heterogeneity in Active Glasses as a Signature of Violation of Mermin-Wagner-Hohenberg Theorem
Authors: Subhodeep Dey, Smarajit Karmakar
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) systems have attracted renewed interest within the scientific community due to their anomalous dynamical behaviors, which arise from long-wavelength density fluctuations as predicted by the Mermin-Wagner-Hohenberg (MWH) theorem. In equilibrium, it is well established that continuous spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) in 2D is prohibited at any finite temperature ($T > 0$), resulting in the absence of true long-range positional order and establishing $d_l = 2$ as the lower critical dimension. Recent studies have demonstrated that, in active systems, the lower critical dimension can shift from $d_l = 2$ to $3$. This study examines the impact of MWH theorem violation in active systems on dynamical heterogeneity (DH). As a minimal model, glassy systems of active particles undergoing run-and-tumble (RT) motion are considered. Glass-like dynamical behavior, including anomalously enhanced DH, is observed in various biological systems such as collective cell migration, bacterial cytoplasm, and ant colonies. Furthermore, the study investigates the influence of local positional order, or medium-range crystalline order (MRCO), on DH in the presence of activity. The results indicate that the growth of DH with increasing activity differs significantly between systems with and without MRCO. These findings may have important implications, as many biological systems exhibit local structural ordering, and DH could serve as a useful indicator for quantifying the degree of ordering.

Title: Artificial Gauge Field Engineered Excited-State Topology: Control of Dynamical Evolution of Localized Spinons
Authors: Jie Ren, Yi-Ran Xue, Run-Jia Luo, Rui Wang, Baigeng Wang
Abstract: Spinons are elementary excitations at the core of frustrated quantum magnets. Although it is well-established that a pair of spinons can emerge from a magnon via deconfinement, controlled manipulation of individual spinons and direct observation of their deconfinement remain elusive. We propose an artificial gauge field scenario that enables the engineering of specific excited states in quantum spin models. This generates spatially localized individual spinons with high controllability. By applying time-dependent gauge fields, we realize adiabatic braiding of these spinons, as well as their dynamical evolution in a controllable manner. These results not only provide the first direct visualization of individual spinons localized in the bulk, but also point to new possibilities to simulate their confinement process. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility of our scenario in Rydberg atoms, which suggests an experimentally viable direction--gauge field engineering of correlated phenomena in excited states.

Title: Breaking Four-Point and Three-Point Bending Tests
Authors: Subhrangsu Saha, Jeffery R. Roesler, Oscar Lopez-Pamies
Abstract: Since their initial standardizations in the 1930s and 1950s, the so-called four-point and three-point bending tests on unnotched beams have been embraced by practitioners as two popular methods to indirectly measure the tensile strength of concrete, ceramics, and other materials with a large compressive strength relative to their tensile strength. This is because of the ease that the tests afford in both the preparation of the specimen (a beam of rectangular cross section) and the application of the loads (simple supports pressing on the specimen). Yet, this practical advantage has to be tempered by the fact that the observations from both of these tests -- being \emph{indirect} experiments in the sense that they involve \emph{not} uniform uniaxial tension but non-uniform triaxial stress states throughout the specimen -- have to be appropriately interpreted to be useful. By making use of the phase-field fracture theory initiated by Kumar, Francfort, and Lopez-Pamies (2018), which has been recently established as a complete theory of fracture capable of accurately describing the nucleation and propagation of cracks in elastic brittle materials under arbitrary quasistatic loading conditions, the main objective of this paper is to carry out a thorough 3D quantitative analysis of when and where fracture nucleates and propagates in four-point and three-point bending tests and thereby establish how to appropriately interpret their results. As a corollary, the analysis provides an explanation for why four-point bending tests typically yield smaller flexural strengths than three-point bending tests, a source of constant headaches for practitioners who have been left to wonder which test -- if any -- would be more appropriate for their purposes.

Title: Anisotropic magnon transport in an antiferromagnetic trilayer heterostructure: is BiFeO$_3$ an altermagnet?
Authors: Sajid Husain, Maya Ramesh, Qian Song, Sergei Prokhorenko, Shashank Kumar Ojha, Surya Narayan Panda, Xinyan Li, Yousra Nahas, Yogesh Kumar, Pushpendra Gupta, Tenzin Chang, Alan Ji-in Jung, Rogério de Sousa, James G. Analytis, Lane W. Martin, Zhi Yao, Sang-Wook Cheong, Laurent Bellaiche, Manuel Bibes, Darrell G. Schlom, Ramamoorthy Ramesh
Abstract: Magnons provide a route to ultra-fast transport and non-destructive readout of spin-based information transfer. Here, we report magnon transport and its emergent anisotropic nature in BiFeO$_3$ layers confined between ultrathin layers of the antiferromagnet LaFeO$_3$. Due to the confined state, BiFeO$_3$ serves as an efficient magnon transmission channel as well as a magnetoelectric knob by which to control the stack by means of an electric field. We discuss the mechanism of the anisotropic spin transport based on the interaction between the antiferromagnetic order and the electric field. This allows us to manipulate and amplify the spin transport in such a confined geometry. Furthermore, lower crystal symmetric and suppression of the spin cycloid in ultrathin BiFeO$_3$ stabilizes a non-trivial antiferromagnetic state exhibiting symmetry-protected spin-split bands that provide the non-trivial sign inversion of the spin current, which is a characteristic of an altermagnet. This work provides an understanding of the anisotropic spin transport in complex antiferromagnetic heterostructures where ferroelectricity and altermagnetism coexist, paving the way for a new route to realize electric-field control of a novel state of magnetism.

Title: Spatial resolution(s) in atom probe tomography
Authors: Baptiste Gault, Frédéric De Geuser, Christoph Freysoldt, Benjamin Klaes, François Vurpillot
Abstract: Atom probe tomography (APT) is often quoted to provide "atomic-scale" analysis of materials in three dimensions. Despite efforts to quantify APT's spatial resolution, misunderstanding remain regarding its true spatial performance. If the depth resolution was once reported to be 20 pm, quoting this value outside of its specific context is misleading and should be avoided. The resolution achievable in pure metals, at one specific location within one reconstructed dataset, does not generally apply across materials or analysis conditions, or even throughout a single tomographic reconstruction. Here, we review various efforts at defining and measuring the spatial resolution in the study of single phase and single element materials - i.e. pure metals - in field-ion microscopy (FIM) and APT. We also report on the degradation of the resolution arising from ion optical devices used to improve the mass-resolution. We aim to offer some perspective as to how reported resolutions may be or may not be of any relevance to most of the materials characterisation efforts by APT, including cases of precipitates in a matrix that emphasise the need to consider an effective resolution. Finally, we discuss concepts to improve the spatial accuracy of the technique in a relatively distant future.

Title: Direct Observation of the Spillover of High Magnetic Field-induced SC3 Superconductivity Outside the Spin-Polarized State in UTe2
Authors: Zheyu Wu, Hanyi Chen, Theodore I. Weinberger, Mengmeng Long, David Graf, Andrej Cabala, Vladimir Sechovsky, Michal Valiska, Gilbert G. Lonzarich, F. Malte Grosche, Alexander G. Eaton
Abstract: In our recent study of the high magnetic field phase landscape of UTe$_2$ [Phys. Rev. X 15, 021019 (2025)] we found indirect evidence that the SC3 superconducting phase spills out beyond the first-order phase boundary of the spin-polarized state. This prior study was limited to a maximal field strength of 41.5 T, and mapped the $b-ac$ rotation plane. Here we measure a high quality sample with residual resistivity ratio RRR = 605 under rotations in the $b-c$ plane up to 45 T. This extended field range helps to unambiguously demonstrate the spillover of SC3 outside the polarized paramagnetic state. This is identified by the observation of zero resistance at low temperatures, for magnetic field strengths lower than the metamagnetic transition field resolved at higher temperatures. This observation is consistent with the scenario that electronic pairing of the SC3 phase is mediated by quantum critical fluctuations.

Title: Crystal Generation using the Fully Differentiable Pipeline and Latent Space Optimization
Authors: Osman Goni Ridwan, Gilles Frapper, Hongfei Xue, Qiang Zhu
Abstract: We present a materials generation framework that couples a symmetry-conditioned variational autoencoder (CVAE) with a differentiable SO(3) power spectrum objective to steer candidates toward a specified local environment under the crystallographic constraints. In particular, we implement a fully differentiable pipeline that performs batch-wise optimization on both direct and latent crystallographic representations. Using the GPU acceleration, the implementation achieves about fivefold speed compared to our previous CPU workflow, while yielding comparable outcomes. In addition, we introduce the optimization strategy that alternatively performs optimization on the direct and latent crystal representations. This dual-level relaxation approach can effectively overcome local barrier defined by different objective gradients, thus increasing the success rate of generating complex structures satisfying the targe local environments. This framework can be extended to systems consisting of multi-components and multi-environments, providing a scalable route to generate material structures with the target local environment.

Title: Power-law molecular-weight distributions dictate universal behaviors in highly polydisperse polymer solutions
Authors: Naoya Yanagisawa, Daisuke S. Shimamoto, Miho Yanagisawa
Abstract: Polydispersity is a universal feature of synthetic polymers and biological molecules in the cytoplasm. However, its quantitative impact on collective behavior remains poorly understood because conventional metrics, such as the polydispersity index, fail to capture broad, non-Gaussian size distributions. Here, we develop an experimental platform in which polyethylene glycol (PEG) solutions are engineered to follow tunable power-law molecular-weight distributions spanning an extensive range, from $M = 1$ kg/mol to $10^{4}$ kg/mol. By systematically varying the $M$ distribution exponent $a$, we identify a robust regime ($1 < a \lesssim 2.5$) in which the viscosity scaling exponent in the entangled regime, the overlap concentration $c^{\ast}$, and the entanglement concentration ${c_{\mathrm{e}}}$ all exhibit pronounced maxima that exceed monodisperse limits. This amplification minimizes as the upper cutoff $M_{\max}$ is reduced, with the system approaching monodisperse behavior. The enhanced rheology arises from a competition between long-chain-dominated entanglement and short-chain-mediated void filling, demonstrating that the whole shape of the molecular-weight distribution plays a decisive role. Consequently, these collective behaviors cannot be reproduced by simply tuning the average molecular weight. Together, our results establish the power-law exponent $a$ as a quantitative control parameter that links polymer entanglement, soft packing, and molecular crowding in highly polydisperse systems.

Title: High mobility holes at germanane/Ge(111) allotropic cross-dimensional heterointerface
Authors: Yumiko Katayama, Daiki Kobayashi, Hikaru Okuma, Yuhsuke Yasutake, Susumu Fukatsu, Kazunori Ueno
Abstract: Germanane (GeH) is essentially a hydrogen-terminated Ge analog of graphene with a direct gap (~1.6 eV). Record hole mobility mu_h~67,000 cm2/Vs is found at 15 K for a single allotropic cross-dimensional(D) heterointerface. This is enabled by making topotactically-transformed 2D GeH layers meet the 3D bulk Ge(111). Temperature dependence of mu_h implies metallic conduction without ionized impurity scattering between 20 K and 250 K. Sheet hole density for a Fermi sphere n_S=2.8x10^11 /cm2 agrees well with 3.0x10^11 /cm2 of Hall measurements. A 6,500% magnetoresistance at 7 T accompanies Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations visible even at 15 K. These imply single-band conduction of holes with small effective mass in the in-plane directions, invoking a 2D hole gas (2DHG) picture that allotropic cross-D heterointerface between 2D GeH and 3D Ge harbors 2D-confined high-mobility holes. Even without elaborate heteroepitaxy and modulation doping, allotropic cross-D heterostructures pave the way toward facile 2DHG creation.

Title: Optical Signatures and Quantum Geometry in Proximity-Induced Topological Superconductors
Authors: Myungjun Kang, Yogeshwar Prasad, Nikhil Danny Babu, Rasoul Ghadimi, Jae Hoon Kim, Sangmo Cheon
Abstract: Proximity-induced superconductivity at topological insulator-superconductor (TI-SC) interfaces offers a promising route to topological superconductivity with Majorana boundary modes. However, probing the interfacial superconductivity at buried interfaces is challenging with conventional surface methods. Here, we present a theoretical study of the longitudinal optical response of a TI-SC heterostructure, focusing on the complex interface sheet conductance as a direct and layer-selective probe of the interfacial superconducting gap. Within a minimal TI--SC model, we demonstrate that proximity-induced superconductivity at the buried interface generates a two-dimensional topological superconducting phase supporting Majorana edge modes. Using a Bogoliubov-de Gennes slab model and the Kubo formalism, we compute the optical conductance and introduce a thickness-extrapolation protocol that isolates the interface contribution only. The resulting interface conductance exhibits a robust, thickness-independent coherence peak at an energy set by the proximity-induced gap, distinguishable from both the parent superconductor's pair-breaking feature and the ungapped Dirac cone on the top surface. We further demonstrate that the low-frequency spectral weight of this interface resonance obeys a quantum-metric sum rule, quantitatively linking the optical response to the quantum geometry of the proximitized interfacial state. Our results propose terahertz/infrared spectroscopy of the interfacial sheet conductance as a non-invasive diagnostic of Majorana-hosting TI--SC interfaces.

Title: Construction of asymptotic quantum many-body scar states in the SU($N$) Hubbard model
Authors: Daiki Hashimoto, Masaya Kunimi, Tetsuro Nikuni
Abstract: We construct asymptotic quantum many-body scars (AQMBS) in one-dimensional SU($N$) Hubbard chains ($N\geq 3$) by embedding the scar subspace into an auxiliary Hilbert subspace $\mathcal{H}_P$ and identifying a parent Hamiltonian within it, together with a corresponding extension of the restricted spectrum-generating algebra to the multi-ladder case. Unlike previous applications of the parent-Hamiltonian scheme, we show that the parent Hamiltonian becomes the SU($N$) ferromagnetic Heisenberg model rather than the spin-1/2 case, so that its gapless magnons realize explicit AQMBS of the original model. Working in the doublon-holon subspace, we derive this mapping, obtain the one-magnon dispersion for periodic and open boundaries, and prove (i) orthogonality to the tower of scar states, (ii) vanishing energy variance in the thermodynamic limit, and (iii) subvolume entanglement entropy with rigorous MPS/MPO bounds. Our results broaden the parent-Hamiltonian family for AQMBS beyond spin-1/2 and provide analytic, low-entanglement excitations in SU($N$)-symmetric systems.

Title: Condensation mechanism of high-$T_c$ cuprates: the key role of pairon excitations
Authors: Yves Noat, Alain Mauger, William Sacks
Abstract: In this article we show that the condensation mechanism in cuprates involves the strong coupling of the condensate to pairon excited states. We present an accessible formalism that significantly extends our previous work, providing a theoretical basis for the energy-dependent gap function $\Delta(E)$. The latter is proportional to the effective spin exchange energy, $J_{eff}$, with no retardation effects, such as the case of spin-fluctuation or phonon mediated couplings. The fundamental parameters of the superconducting (SC) state are the condensation energy per pair, $\beta_c$, and the antinodal energy gap, $\Delta_p$, which are quantitatively extracted by fitting the cuprate quasiparticle spectrum from tunneling experiments. An explicit formula for the critical temperature is also derived in the model. Valid for any doping, we find $T_c$ to be proportional to $\beta_c$, and not the gap $\Delta_p$, in sharp contrast to conventional SC. The numerical factor $\beta_c/k_BT_c\simeq 2.24$ originates from pair excitations of the condensate, following Bose statistics, with a mini-gap $\delta_M \simeq 1\,$meV in the excitation spectrum. These results strongly suggest that the same `all-electron' mechanism is at work all along the $T_c$-dome.

Title: Scattering of a weakly bound dimer from a hard wall in one dimension
Authors: Xican Zhang, Shina Tan
Abstract: We consider a dimer formed by two particles with an attractive contact interaction in one dimension, colliding with a hard wall. We compute the scattering phase shifts and the reflection coefficients for various collision energies and various mass ratios of the two particles. For low-energy collisions (with dimer kinetic energies much smaller than the binding energy) our results are consistent with those of D. Lee and M. Pine, The European Physical Journal A 47, 41 (2011). For mass ratios much greater than 1 we use the Born-Oppenheimer approximation to show that the scattering length and the effective range of the dimer-wall collision both depend logarithmically on the mass ratio. For collision energies much greater than the binding energy, the dissociation probability is inversely proportional to the square of the incident momentum of the dimer and we find the constant of proportionality analytically, and we use a semiclassical analysis to approximately derive the ``angular distribution" of the dissociated pair, where the ``angle" $\theta$ depends on the ratio of the velocities of the two outgoing unbound particles.

Title: Chaos in high-dimensional dynamical systems with tunable non-reciprocity
Authors: Samantha Fournier, Pierfrancesco Urbani
Abstract: High-dimensional dynamical systems of interacting degrees of freedom are ubiquitous in the study of complex systems. When the directed interactions are totally uncorrelated, sufficiently strong and non-linear, many of these systems exhibit a chaotic attractor characterized by a positive maximal Lyapunov exponent (MLE). On the contrary, when the interactions are completely symmetric, the dynamics takes the form of a gradient descent on a carefully defined cost function, and it exhibits slow dynamics and aging. In this work, we consider the intermediate case in which the interactions are partially symmetric, with a parameter {\alpha} tuning the degree of non-reciprocity. We show that for any value of {\alpha} for which the corresponding system has non-reciprocal interactions, the dynamics lands on a chaotic attractor. Correspondingly, the MLE is a non-monotonous function of the degree of non-reciprocity. This implies that conservative forcing deriving from the gradient field of a rough energy landscape can make the system more chaotic.

Title: Multigap nodeless superconductivity in Dirac semimetal PdTe
Authors: Fengrui Shi, Weilong Qiu, Chufan Chen, Chunqiang Xu, Yan Zhang, Hao Zheng, Yuwei Zhou, Dongting Zhang, Mengwei Xie, Huiqiu Yuan, Shiyan Li, Yang Liu, Chao Cao, Xiaofeng Xu, Xin Lu
Abstract: PdTe has recently been reported to be a type-II Dirac semimetal while a bulk nodal and surface nodeless superconductivity (SC) has been claimed to coexist. In this work, we applied point-contact spectroscopy (PCS) method to systematically study the superconducting gap in PdTe single crystals with a SC transition temperature $T_{c}=4.3$ K. The obtained differential conductance curves show a common deviation from a single-gap superconducting behavior and can be better fitted by a two-gap Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk model, suggesting the larger gap $\Delta_{L}$ with $2\Delta_{L}$=3.7 $k_{B}T_{c}$ and the smaller gap $\Delta_S$ yielding $2\Delta_{S}$=1.1-2.2 $k_{B}T_{c}$ with a weak interband scattering. The variations of conductance spectra among different contacts are proposed to be caused by the anisotropy of Fermi surface topology associated with different gaps.

Title: How semiconducting are ferroelectrics: The fundamental, optical and transport gaps of Na$_{0.5}$Bi$_{0.5}$TiO$_3$-BaTiO$_3$ and NaNbO$_{3}$
Authors: Pengcheng Hu, Nicole Bein, Chinmay Chandan Parhi, Tadej Rojac, Barbara Malič, Mohammad Amirabbasi, Anton Volodin, Karsten Albe, Jurij Koruza, Andreas Klein
Abstract: The energy gap is a fundamental property of materials, directly related to their optical and electronic properties. The energy gap of ferroelectric compounds and its adjustment by compositional variation has particularly attracted attention in recent years due to potential application in energy conversion and/or catalytic devices. It is demonstrated that it is necessary to distinguish between the fundamental gap, $E_{\rm g}^{0}$, the optical gap, $E_{\rm g}^{\rm opt}$, and the transport gap, $E_{\rm g}^{\rm tr}$, of ferroelectrics, which can differ significantly. The situation is comparable to those in organic semiconductors and emerges from the presence of localized charges. The fundamental gap is a ground state property, i.e.\ the energy difference between the maximum of the fully occupied valence band and the minimum of the completely empty conduction band. In contrast, the optical and transport gaps are excited state properties involving localized (polaronic) electrons and/or holes at energies considerably different from the band edges. This work illustrates how the different energy gaps of ferroelectrics can be determined by combining optical measurements, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and temperature and oxygen partial pressure dependent electrical conductivity measurements. We determine fundamental gaps of $\approx 4.5\,$eV for both materials, optical gaps of $3.25-3.45\,$eV/$3.5\,$eV and electrical gaps of $\approx 1.4\,$eV/$3.3\,$eV for Na$_{0.5}$Bi$_{0.5}$TiO$_3$-BaTiO$_3$/NaNbO$_{3}$, respectively.

Title: K-ion intercalation memristors in prussian blue analogs revealed by C-AFM for Non-Volatile memory and Neuromorphic Computing

Abstract: Here, we demonstrate K-ion intercalation-mediated resistive switching in Prussian blue analogs (PBAs), a mechanism widely exploited in potassium batteries but not previously resolved at the nanoscale for memristive operation. Using C-AFM, we directly visualize and electrically control this intercalation process within sub-100-nm volumes, revealing reversible, localized conductance modulation driven by K-ion intercalation and Fe2+/Fe3+ redox reconfiguration. This nanoscale operability highlights the exceptional potential of PBAs for high-scalable and low-dimension memristor-based devices integration. Due to their modular composition, PBAs constitute a chemically rich, earth-abundant materials platform whose electronic and ionic properties can be precisely tuned for specific device functions. K-ion intercalation PBA-based memristor devices, with their singlestep, aqueous, and room-temperature fabrication, enable low-cost, large-scale processing compatible with CMOS, without any additional post-fabrication processing. Our findings establish PBAs as a new class of intercalation memristors with scalable nanoscale switching and exceptional materials versatility, toward highly integrated neuromorphic and non-volatile memory technologies. This work provides the first demonstration of intercalation-driven resistive switching under ultrafast voltage sweeps, with PW operating up to 200 V/s and PB up to 50 V/s. This unprecedented speed establishes PBAs as a distinct, high-rate class of K-ion intercalation memristors suitable for fast, high-density neuromorphic and memory applications.

Title: Towards understanding the defect properties in the multivalent A-site Na$_{0.5}$Bi$_{0.5}$TiO$_3$-based perovskite ceramics
Authors: Pengcheng Hu, Chinmay Chandan Parhi, Jurij Koruza, Andreas Klein
Abstract: A defect model involving cation and anion vacancies and anti-site defects is proposed that accounts for the non-stoichiometry of multi-valent $A$-site Na$_{0.5}$Bi$_{0.5}$TiO$_3$ based perovskite oxides with $ABO_3$ composition. A series of samples with varying $A$-site non-stoichiometry and $A$:$B$ ratios were prepared to investigate their electrical conductivity. The oxygen partial pressure and temperature dependent conductivities where studied with direct current (dc) and alternating current (ac) techniques, enabling to separate between ionic and electronic conduction. The Na-excess samples, regardless of the $A$:$B$ ratio, exhibit dominant ionic conductivity and $p$-type electronic conduction, with the highest total conductivity reaching $4 \times 10^{-4}$ S/cm at 450$^\circ$C. In contrast, the Bi-excess samples display more insulating characteristics and $n$-type electronic conductivity, with conductivity values within the 10$^{-8}$ S/cm range at 450$^\circ$C. These conductivity results strongly support the proposed defect model, which offers a straightforward description of defect chemistry in NBT-based ceramics and serves as a valuable guide for optimizing sample processing to achieve tailored properties.

Title: Probing quantum critical crossover via impurity renormalization group
Authors: Tao Yang, Z. Y. Xie, Rui Wang, Baigeng Wang
Abstract: Quantum impurities can host exotic many-body states that serve as sensitive probes of bath correlations. However, quantitative and non-perturbative methods for determining impurity thermodynamics in such settings remain scarce. Here, we introduce an impurity renormalization group approach that merges the tensor-network representation with the numerical renormalization group cutoff scheme. This method overcomes conventional limitations by treating bath correlations and impurity interactions on an equal footing. Applying our approach to the finite-temperature quantum critical regime of quantum spin systems, we uncover striking impurity-induced phenomena. In a coupled Heisenberg ladder, the impurity triggers a fractionalization of the local magnetic moment. Moreover, the derivative of the impurity susceptibility develops cusps that mark the crossover into the quantum critical regime. We also observe an exotic evolution of the spin correlation function driven by the interplay between bath correlations and the impurity. Our results demonstrate that this method can efficiently solve correlated systems with defects, opening new pathways to discovering novel impurity physics beyond those in non-interacting thermal baths.

Title: Decoupling Structure and Elasticity in Colloidal Gels Under Isotropic Compression
Authors: M. Milani, E. Cavalletti, V. Ruzzi, A. Martinelli, P. Dieudonne-George, C. Ligoure, T. Phou, L. Cipelletti, L. Ramos
Abstract: We exploit the controlled drying of millimeter-sized gel beads to investigate isotropic compression of colloidal fractal gels. Using a custom dynamic light scattering setup, we demonstrate that stresses imposed by drying on the bead surface propagate homogeneously throughout the gel volume, inducing plastic rearrangements. We find that the Young modulus and yield stress of the gels increase monotonically with the instantaneous colloid volume fraction, $\phi$, exhibiting a mechanical response that depends solely on $\phi$, regardless of the drying history. In striking contrast, small-angle X-ray scattering reveals that the gel microstructure retains a strong memory of its initial state, depending on both $\varphi$ and the entire compression pathway. Our findings challenge the prevailing paradigm of a one-to-one relationship between microstructure and elasticity in colloidal fractal gels, opening new avenues for independent control over the structural and mechanical properties of soft materials.

Title: Topological sensing of superfluid rotation using non-Hermitian optical dimers
Authors: Aritra Ghosh, Nilamoni Daloi, M. Bhattacharya
Abstract: We theoretically investigate a non-Hermitian optical dimer whose parameters are renormalized by dispersive and dissipative backaction from the coupling of the passive cavity with a ring-trapped Bose-Einstein condensate. The passive cavity is driven by a two-tone control laser, where each tone is in a coherent superposition of Laguerre-Gaussian beams carrying orbital angular momenta $\pm \ell \hbar$. This imprints an optical lattice on the ring trap, leading to Bragg-diffracted sidemode excitations. Using an exact Schur-complement reduction of the full light-matter dynamics, we derive a frequency-dependent self-energy and identify a static regime in which the atomic response produces a complex shift of the passive optical mode. This renormalized dimer supports a tunable exceptional point, enabling spectroscopic signatures in the optical transmission due to a probe field, which can in turn be utilized for estimating the winding number of the persistent current. Exploiting the associated half-integer topological charge, we propose a digital exceptional-point-based sensing scheme based on eigenmode permutation, providing a noise-resilient method to sense superfluid rotation without relying on fragile eigenvalue splittings. Importantly, the sensing proposals are intrinsically non-destructive, preserving the coherence of the atomic superfluid.

Title: Scalable Dielectric Tensor Predictions for Inorganic Materials using Equivariant Graph Neural Networks
Authors: Haowei Hua, Chen Liang, Ding Pan, Shengchao Liu, Irwin King, Koji Tsuda, Wanyu Lin
Abstract: Accurate prediction of dielectric tensors is essential for accelerating the discovery of next-generation inorganic dielectric materials. Existing machine learning approaches, such as equivariant graph neural networks, typically rely on specially-designed network architectures to enforce O(3) equivariance. However, to preserve equivariance, these specially-designed models restrict the update of equivariant features during message passing to linear transformations or gated equivariant nonlinearities. The inability to implicitly characterize more complex nonlinear structures may reduce the predictive accuracy of the model. In this study, we introduce a frame-averaging-based approach to achieve equivariant dielectric tensor prediction. We propose GoeCTP, an O(3)-equivariant framework that predicts dielectric tensors without imposing any structural restrictions on the backbone network. We benchmark its performance against several state-of-the-art models and further employ it for large-scale virtual screening of thermodynamically stable materials from the Materials Project database. GoeCTP successfully identifies various promising candidates, such as Zr(InBr$_3$)$_2$ (band gap $E_g = 2.41$ eV, dielectric constant $\overline{\varepsilon} = 194.72$) and SeI$_2$ (anisotropy ratio $\alpha_r = 96.763$), demonstrating its accuracy and efficiency in accelerating the discovery of advanced inorganic dielectric materials.

Title: Mechanisms of Spatiotemporal Damage Evolution in Double Polymer Networks
Authors: Magali Le Goff, Laureano Ortellado, Jiting Tian, Mehdi Bouzid, Jean-Louis Barrat, Kirsten Martens
Abstract: Double polymer networks exhibit a striking enhancement of toughness compared to single networks, yet the microscopic mechanisms governing stress redistribution, damage evolution, and fracture remain incompletely understood. Using large-scale coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations under uniaxial deformation, we resolve bond scission statistics, local stress redistribution following individual bond-breaking events, and the spatiotemporal evolution of damage in single- and double-network architectures. We show that while the early mechanical response is dominated by the pre-stretched sacrificial network, damage evolution in double networks follows a qualitatively distinct pathway. In contrast to single networks, where anisotropic stress redistribution promotes rapid localization and catastrophic fracture, the presence of a soft matrix in double networks induces a screening of stress redistribution generated by sacrificial bond scission. This screening suppresses correlated rupture events and stabilizes multiple damage zones, leading to a strongly delocalized damage landscape over a broad deformation range. At larger strains, when the matrix becomes load-bearing, damage progressively localizes, ultimately triggering fracture. By isolating the dynamics of individual damage zones, we further demonstrate that matrix-mediated stress screening stabilizes defects and delays localization. Together, these results identify stress-screening-induced damage delocalization as a central microscopic mechanism underlying toughness enhancement in multiple-network elastomers.

Title: Berry Phase of Bloch States through Modular Symmetries
Authors: Emanuele Maggio
Abstract: The theoretical identification of crystalline topological materials has enjoyed sustained success in simplified materials models, often by singling out discrete symmetry operations protecting the topological phase. When band structure calculations of realistic materials are considered, complications often arise owing to the requirement of a consistent gauge in the Brillouin zone, or down to the fineness of its sampling. Yet, the Berry phase, acting as topological label, encodes geometrical properties of the system, and it should be easily accessible. Here, an expression for the Berry phase is obtained, thanks to analytical Bloch states constructed from an infinite series of Gaussian type orbitals. Two contributions in the Berry phase are identified, with one having an immediate geometric interpretation, being equal to the Zak phase. Eigenvalues of a modular symmetry, considered here for the first time in the context of crystalline solid state systems, are put in correspondence with the Zak phase: modular symmetries allow to define a non-trivial action for the spatial inversion also when the system does not have an inversion centre. The approach is showcased for the non-centrosymmetric space group no. 22 ($F222$), which is known to host symmetry equivalent Bloch states that can be distinguished by their Berry phase.

Title: Tuning Excitonic Properties and Charge Carrier Dynamics by Halide Alloying in Cs3Bi2(Br1-xIx)9 semiconductors
Authors: He Zhao, Eline M. Hutter
Abstract: The perovskite-inspired bismuth halide semiconductor Cs3Bi2Br9 is widely investigated as photoactive material for light-conversion applications. However, charge generation and separation are inherently limited by its modest sunlight absorption and strong exciton binding energy, respectively. Here, we demonstrate that both the light absorption and exciton dissociation are improved by controlled substitution of Br with I via mechanochemical synthesis of Cs3Bi2(Br1-xIx)9. X-ray diffraction and Raman analyses confirm atomic-level halide mixing and reveal a crystallographic phase transition near x = 0.8. From absorption measurements on thin films, we determine the absorption coefficient, Urbach tail, and exciton binding energy for several Cs3Bi2(Br1-xIx)9 compositions. From here, we find that the band gap can be tuned from 2.59 to 1.93 eV (for x = 0.9), while exciton binding energies reach a minimum at x = 0.6. Finally, transient absorption spectroscopy measurements suggest a weak correlation between recombination lifetime and Urbach energy, where the longest lifetimes are observed for the materials with lowest disorder. These results offer valuable insights for designing stable bismuth halide semiconductors with favorable light absorption properties and charge carrier dynamics.

Title: Single-enantiomer spin polarisers in superconducting junctions
Authors: Lorenz Meyer, Nicolas Néel, Jörg Kröger
Abstract: Chiral matter acting as a spin-selective device in biased electron transport is attracting attention for the quantum-technological design of miniaturized electronics. To date, however, experimental reports on spin selectivity are not conclusive. The magnetoresistance in electron transport measurements observed for chiral materials on ferromagnets upon magnetisation reversal is proposed to result from electrostatic rather than from the sought-after chiral effects. Recent break junction studies even question the spin-dependent electron flow across single chiral molecules. Here, we avoid ferromagnetic electrodes and magnetisation reversal to provide unambiguous experimental evidence for the chirality-induced spin selectivity effect of single enantiomers. Functionalising the superconducting tip of a scanning tunnelling microscope with a manganese atom cluster gives rise to Yu-Shiba-Rusinov resonances that serve as spin-sensitive probes of the tunnelling current in junctions of single heptahelicene molecules adsorbed on a crystalline lead surface. Our key finding is the dependence of the signal strength of these states in spectroscopy of the differential conductance on the handedness of the molecule. The experiments unveil the role of the enantiomers as spin polarisers and the irrelevance of electrostatics in the chosen model system.

Title: Intrinsic Gyrotropic Magnetic Current of Orbital Origin
Authors: Koushik Ghorai, Sankar Sarkar, Amit Agarwal
Abstract: In gyrotropic crystals, an oscillating magnetic field induces a charge response known as the gyrotropic magnetic current. While its conventional origin is attributed to magnetic field modified band energy and shift in the Fermi-surface, a recent study identified an additional spin-driven magnetic displacement contribution. Here, we complete the picture by identifying the orbital counterpart of the magnetic displacement current. Using a density-matrix formulation that incorporates both minimal coupling and spin-Zeeman interactions, we derive the electronic equations of motion in the presence of an oscillating magnetic field and uncover a previously unexplored orbital contribution to the wavepacket velocity. Physically, this contribution arises from the time variation of the magnetic-field induced charge polarization. In the low frequency transport regime, this mechanism becomes purely intrinsic. We illustrate this intrinsic gyrotropic current of orbital origin in the ${\cal P}{\cal T}$-symmetric antiferromagnet CuMnAs. We show that the intrinsic gyrotropic magnetic current reverses sign upon Néel vector reversal, establishing it as a direct probe of antiferromagnetic order in CuMnAs and other $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric antiferromagnets.

Title: Switching magnetization of quantum antiferromagnets: Schwinger boson mean-field theory compared to exact diagonalization
Authors: Florian Johannesmann, Asliddin Khudoyberdiev, Götz S. Uhrig
Abstract: Antiferromagnets have attracted significant attention because of their considerable potential in engineering high-density and ultrafast memory devices, a crucial and increasingly demanded component of contemporary high-performance information technology. Theoretical and experimental investigations are actively progressing to provide the capability of efficient switching and precise control of the Néel vector, which is crucial for the intended practical applications of antiferromagnets. Recently, a time-dependent Schwinger boson mean-field theory has been successfully developed to study the sublattice magnetization switching in anisotropic quantum antiferromagnets [K. Bolsmann $et \, al.$, \textcolor{blue}{\hyperlink{https://doi.org/10.1103/PRXQuantum.4.030332}{PRX Quantum $\mathbf{4}$, 030332 (2023)}}]. Here we use a complementary exact diagonalization method to study such sublattice magnetization switching, but in small-cluster quantum antiferromagnets, by means of an external magnetic field. Furthermore, this article aims to support the findings of the Schwinger boson approach. We show that the results of both approaches are consistent at short time scales, with only about 12.5 $\%$ deviations. The consistency of the outcomes obtained through this alternative exact approach demonstrates that the time-dependent Schwinger boson mean-field theory is a versatile framework to capture the essentials of the switching process in quantum antiferromagnets. Thereby, the findings of current article pave the way for further theoretical and computational progress in the study of antiferromagnets for engineering spintronic devices with ultrahigh density and ultrafast speed.

Title: Electric-Field Modulated Optical Transitions in Monolayer CrI3 and Its Nanoribbons
Authors: Xianzhe Zhu, Pu Liu, Wence Ding, Benhu Zhou, Xiaoying Zhou, Guanghui Zhou
Abstract: The successful synthesis of few-layer CrI3 has opened new avenues for research in two-dimensional magnetic materials. Owing to its simple crystal structure and excellent physical properties, layered CrI3 has been extensively studied in magneto-optical effects, excitons, tunneling transport, and novel memory devices. However, the most current theoretical studies rely heavily on the first-principles calculations, and a general analytical theoretical framework, particularly for electric-field modulation and transport properties, is still lacking. In this work, using a 28-band tight-binding model combined with linear response theory, we systematically investigate the optoelectronic response for monolayer CrI3 and its nanoribbons. The results demonstrate that: (1) a vertical electric field can selectively close the band gap of one spin channel while the other remains insulating, resulting a transition to an half-metallic state; (2) the electric field dynamically shifts the optical transition peaks, providing a theoretical basis for extracting band parameters from experimental photoconductivity spectra; (3) nanoribbons with different edge morphologies exhibit distinct edge-state distributions and electronic properties, indicating that optical transition can be dynamically modualted through edge design. The theoretical model developed in this study, which can describe external electric field effect, offers an efficient and flexible approach for analytically investigating the CrI3 family and related materials. This model overcomes the limitations of first-principles methods and provides a solid foundation for designing spintronic and optoelectronic devices controlled by electric fields and edge effect.

Title: Affordable Five-Orbital Dynamical Mean-Field Theory for Layered Iridates and Rhodates
Authors: Léo Gaspard, Cyril Martins
Abstract: Full $d$-manifold DMFT with numerically exact solvers has remained computationally prohibitive for spin-orbit materials due their scaling and severe sign problem, forcing the community to rely on simplified one- and three-band models that omit the $e_g$ states despite their proximity with the $t_{2g}$ orbitals. We present the first full five-orbital Dynamical Mean-Field Theory (DMFT) calculations including spin-orbit coupling for the layered iridates and rhodates \bio~and \bro, revealing that the correlation effects shift significantly the $e_g$ states through static mean-field corrections rather than dynamical fluctuations. Motivated by this insight, we introduce hybrid-DMFT (hDMFT), which treats these orbitals and their coupling to the low-energy manifold at the mean-field level while maintaining near quantitative accuracy at a drastically reduced computational cost. These calculation establish hDMFT as a practical and accurate method for full $d$-manifold studies of layered iridates and rhodates, enabling systematic investigations of temperature, doping and pressure dependence that were previously computationally intractable.

Title: Floquet-driven tunneling control in monolayer MoS$_2$
Authors: Rachid El Aitouni, Aotmane En Naciri, Clarence Cortes, David Laroze, Ahmed Jellal
Abstract: We study how fermions in molybdenum disulfide MoS$_2$ interact with a laser field and a static potential barrier, focusing on the transmission probability. Our aim is to understand and control photon-assisted quantum transport in this two-dimensional material under external driving. We use the Floquet approximation to describe the wave functions in the three regions of the system. By applying continuity conditions at the boundaries, we obtain a set of equations involving an infinite number of Floquet modes. We explicitly determine transmissions involving the central band $E$ and the first sidebands $E \pm \hbar\omega$. As for higher-order bands, we use the transfer matrix approach together with current density to compute the associated transmissions. Our results reveal that the transmission probability oscillates for both spin-up and spin-down electrons. The oscillations of spin-down electrons occur over nearly twice the period of spin-up electrons. Among all bands, the central one consistently shows the highest transmission. We also find that stronger laser fields and wider barriers both lead to reduced transmission. Moreover, laser irradiation enables controllable channeling and filtering of transmission bands by tuning the laser intensity and system parameters. This highlights the potential of laser-driven MoS$_2$ structures for highly sensitive electromagnetic sensors and advanced optoelectronic devices.

Title: Lateral Graphene-Metallene Interfaces at the Nanoscale
Authors: Mohammad Bagheri, Pekka Koskinen
Abstract: Metallenes are atomically thin, nonlayered two-dimensional materials. While they have appealing properties, their isotropic metallic bonding makes their stabilization difficult and presents considerable challenges to their synthesis and practical applications. However, their stabilization can still be achieved by suspending them in the pores of two-dimensional template materials, making the properties of lateral interfaces of metallenes scientifically relevant. Here, we combined density-functional theory and universal machine-learning interatomic potentials to study lateral interfaces between graphene and 45 metallenes with various profiles. We optimized the interfaces and analyzed their energies, electronic structures, and stabilities at room temperature, defect formations, and structural deformations. While broad trends were identified using machine-learning analysis of all interfaces, density-functional theory was the main tool for studying the microscopic properties of selected elements. We found that the interfaces are the most stable energetically and with respect to lattice mismatch, defect formation, and lateral strain when their profiles were geometrically smooth. The most stable interfaces are found for transition metals. In addition, we demonstrate how universal machine-learning interatomic potentials now offer the accuracy required for the modeling of graphene-metallene interfaces. By systematically expanding the understanding of metallenes' interface properties, we hope these results guide and accelerate their synthesis to enable future applications and benefit from metallenes' appealing properties.

Title: Determining fluid-crystal phase boundaries for a binary hard-sphere mixture using direct-coexistence simulations
Authors: Rinske M. Alkemade, Alessandro Salo, Laura Filion, Frank Smallenburg
Abstract: Determining fluid-crystal phase boundaries via direct-coexistence methods can be challenging due to the fact that the simulation box can introduce crystal strain. Recently, a direct-coexistence approach was developed which allows one to easily identify the equilibrium strain-free fluid-crystal coexistence in monodisperse systems. Here, we show that this approach can be readily extended to binary mixtures forming stoichiometric binary crystals, allowing accurate and efficient determination of the phase boundaries. Moreover, we examine how the choice of crystal plane in contact with the fluid affects the accuracy of the phase boundary determination. The method is easy to implement and does not require prior knowledge of the binary fluid's equation of state. These results further establish the method as a robust and practical tool for accurately determining fluid-crystal phase boundaries.

Title: Triple-well ferroelectricity and kagome-like Chern flat band in two-dimensional multiferroic CuVP$_2$Se$_6$
Authors: Brian Anchico, Jingyi Duan, Haojie Sun, Minjun Wang, Mikhail Talanov, Wei Jiang
Abstract: Two-dimensional multiferroics that host nontrivial topological bands offer a rich platform for correlated and tunable quantum phenomena, yet such materials remain rare. Here, using first-principles calculations, we reveal that monolayer CuVP$_2$Se$_6$ unites a tunable triple-well ferroelectric transition with a spin-polarized Chern flat band. The ferroelectric and paraelectric phases are close in energy and can be reversibly switched by moderate strain or an electric field. During the transition, a kagome-like flat band emerges near the Fermi level, which we describe via a minimal three-orbital tight-binding model on a triangular lattice. Furthermore, the system exhibits sizable magnetic anisotropy and a magnetization-dependent Chern insulating state: the Chern number is $C = \pm 1$ for out-of-plane magnetization but becomes trivial when the moments rotate in-plane. These findings establish CuVP$_2$Se$_6$ as a promising candidate for exploring electrically tunable flat-band correlations and topological magnetism in a multiferroic monolayer.

Title: Half-vortex soliton lattices in spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensates with a quasi-flat band
Authors: Chenhui Wang, Yongping Zhang, Vladimir V. Konotop
Abstract: Periodic potentials with flat bands in their spectra support strongly localized nonlinear excitations. Although a perfectly flat band cannot exist in a continuous system, a spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensate loaded in a Zeeman lattice can realize the quasi-flat lowest band with an extremely narrow bandwidth. In such a quasi flat band, half vortex solitons become confined within a single lattice cell, enabling the formation of arrays of coupled half vortex solitons arranged of various spatial geometries. In this work, we study the existence and stability of these lattices within the framework of the two-component Gross-Pitaevskii equation. We demonstrate that, near the quasi-flat band, half-vortex solitons and their arrays can be excited with a nearly negligible number of atoms and are constrained by their local symmetries, which are isomorphic to a dihedral group of order 8. This allows observation of the respective field patterns in the nearly linear regime where they exhibit enhanced stability. The constructed lattices may have diverse geometric profiles, and in particular create a composite super-half-vortex soliton with nonlinear symmetry breaking.

Abstract: Sawtooth chain magnets have been a subject of historical interest in the field of frustrated magnetism, with classical olivine family $M_2TX_4$, ($M$ - 3d, $T$ - 4p, $X$ - chalcogen elements) typically realizing simple $\mathbf{k} = (000)$ states. The magnetism of the Mn$_2$GeO$_4$ olivine is surprisingly complex, proceeding from commensurate states to a multiferroic commensurate + incommensurate phase. Here we report inelastic neutron scattering results from a Mn$_2$GeO$_4$ single crystal and develop an effective Hamiltonian including long-distance bilinear and dipolar interactions. The magnetic interactions are predominantly antiferromagnetic and span a three-dimensional exchange network consisting of coupled sawtooth chains. Based on the determined strength of the couplings, the dominant sawtooth chains appear at third- and fourth- rather than next-nearest-neighbor. However the next-nearest-neighbor interaction is, along with a modest Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, important for modeling the observed incommensurability. We use the best-fit Hamiltonian as the basis for Langevin dynamics simulations and Luttinger-Tisza calculations of the high-temperature commensurate transition.

Title: Discovery of a new weberite-type antiferroelectric: La3NbO7
Authors: Louis Alaerts, Jesse Schimpf, Xinyan Li, Jiongzhi Zheng, Ella Banyas, Jeffrey B. Neaton, Sinéad M. Griffin, Yimo Han, Lane W. Martin, Geoffroy Hautier
Abstract: Antiferroelectrics are antipolar materials which possess an electric field-induced phase transition to a polar, ferroelectric phase and offer significant potential for sensing/actuation and energy-storage applications. Known antiferroelectrics are relatively scarce and mainly based on a limited set of perovskite materials and their alloys (e.g., PbZrO$_3$, AgNbO$_3$, NaNbO$_3$). Here, a new family of lead-free, weberite-type antiferroelectrics, identified through a large-scale, first-principles computational search is introduced. The screening methodology, which connects lattice dynamics to antipolar distortions, predicted that La$_3$NbO$_7$ could exhibit antiferroelectricity. We confirm the prediction through the synthesis and characterization of epitaxial La$_3$NbO$_7$ thin films, which display the signature double hysteresis loops of an antiferroelectric material as well as clear evidence of an antipolar ground state structure from transmission electron microscopy. The antiferroelectricity in La$_3$NbO$_7$ is simpler than most known antiferroelectrics and can be explained by a Kittel-type mechanism involving the movement of niobium atoms in an oxygen octahedron through a single phonon mode which results in a smaller change in the volume during the field-induced phase transition. Additionally, it is found that La$_3$NbO$_7$ combines a high threshold field with a high breakdown field ($\approx$ 6MV/cm) - which opens up opportunities for energy-storage applications. This new weberite-type family of materials offers many opportunities to tune electrical and temperature response especially through substitutions on the rare-earth site. Ultimately, this work demonstrates a successful data-driven theory-to-experiment discovery of an entirely new family of antiferroelectrics and provides a blueprint for the future design of ferroic materials.

Title: Short-time statistics of extinction and blowup in reaction kinetics
Authors: Rotem Degany, Michael Assaf, Baruch Meerson
Abstract: We study the statistics of extinction and blowup times in well-mixed systems of stochastically reacting particles. We focus on the short-time tail, $T \to 0$, of the extinction- or blowup-time distribution $\mathcal{P}_m(T)$, where $m$ is the number of particles at $t=0$. This tail often exhibits an essential singularity at $T=0$, and we show that the singularity is captured by a time-dependent WKB (Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin) approximation applied directly to the master equation. This approximation, however, leaves undetermined a large pre-exponential factor. Here we show how to calculate this factor by applying a leading- and a subleading-order WKB approximation to the Laplace-transformed backward master equation. Accurate asymptotic results can be obtained when this WKB solution can be matched to another approximate solution (the ``inner" solution), valid for not too large $m$. We demonstrate and verify this method on three examples of reactions which are also solvable without approximations.

Title: Exploring the Potential of Two-dimensional Borospherene for Toxic Gas Sensing and Capture: A DFT Study
Authors: Nicolas F. Martins, José A. dos S. Laranjeira, Kleuton A. L. Lima, Luiz A. Ribeiro Jr, Julio R. Sambrano
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) boron-based materials have gained increasing interest due to their exceptional physicochemical properties and potential technological applications. In this way, borospherenes, a 2D Boron-based fullerene-like lattice (2D-B40), are explored due to their potential for capturing and detecting toxic gases, such as CO, NO, NH3, and SO2. Therefore, density functional theory simulations were carried out to explore the adsorption energy and the distinct interaction regimes, where CO exhibits weak physisorption (-0.16 eV), while NO (-2.24 eV), NH3 (-1.47 eV), and SO2 (-1.51 eV) undergo strong chemisorption. Bader charge analysis reveals significant electron donation from 2D-B40 to NO and electron acceptance from SO2. These interactions cause measurable shifts in work function, with SO2 producing the most significant modulation (14.6%). Remarkably, ab initio molecular dynamics simulations (AIMD) reveal spontaneous SO2 decomposition at room temperature, indicating dual functionality for both sensing and environmental remediation. Compared to other boron-based materials, such as chi3-borophene, beta12-borophene, and B40 fullerene, 2D-B40 exhibits superior gas affinity, positioning it as a versatile platform for the detection and capture of toxic gases.

Title: Exploring structure-property relationship on a nanoscale for tailoring films of amphiphilic polymer co-networks
Authors: Kevin Hagmann, Carina Schneider, Stephanie Ihmann, Frank Böhme, Regine von Klitzing
Abstract: Amphiphilic polymer co-networks (APCNs) provide a large toolbox for tuning coatings important for applications such as bio-interfaces. Therefore, we investigate the influence of network composition and environmental conditions on the structure and mechanical and adhesive properties of thin films composed of hydrophobic tetra-PCL and hydrophilic tetra-PEG stars of varying sizes. State-of-the-art atomic force microscopy (AFM) techniques, including phase imaging, fast quantitative static indentation and dynamic indentation, provide insights into the structure-property- relationship on various length scales. PEG-rich networks exhibit amorphous morphologies with spherical nanodomains and elastic moduli of a few MPa, while PCL- rich networks form semicrystalline cylindrical arrangements with moduli up to several hundred MPa in water. Temperature-dependent measurements in water revealed a strong hysteresis of elastic moduli while shifting the melting/crystallization transitions or preventing crystallization in PEG-rich networks. All networks displayed predominantly elastic behavior. Co-networks in non-selective solvent conditions are overall softer, less adhesive and structurally more homogeneous. These results establish a predictable correlation of network composition, physical and chemical environment, structure and properties, which makes them suitable for a rational design of amphiphilic systems for various applications.

Title: Enhanced Microwave Sensing with Dissipative Continuous Time Crystals
Authors: Yunlong Xue, Zhengyang Bai, Yu-Qiang Ma
Abstract: A dissipative time crystal is an emergent phase in driven-dissipative quantum many-body systems, characterized by sustained oscillations that break time-translation symmetry spontaneously. Here, we explore nonequilibrium phase transitions in a dissipative Rydberg system driven by a microwave (MW) field and demonstrate their critical sensitivity to high-precision MW sensing. Distinct dynamical regimes are identified, including monostable, bistable, and oscillatory phases under mean-field coupling. Unlike single-particle detection--where the beating signal decays linearly with MW field strength--the time crystalline phase exhibits high sensitivity to MW perturbations, with rapid, discontinuous frequency switching near the monostable-oscillatory boundary. The abrupt transition is rooted in spontaneous symmetry breaking in time and is fundamentally insensitive to the background noise. On this basis, a minimum detectable MW field strength on the order of 1nV/cm is achieved by leveraging this sensitivity. Our results establish a framework for controlling time crystalline phases with external fields and advance MW sensing through many-body effects.

Title: Stability and mixed phases of three-component droplets in one dimension
Authors: I. A. Englezos, E. G. Charalampidis, P. Schmelcher, S. I. Mistakidis
Abstract: We explore the ground state properties and excitation spectra of one-dimensional three-component bosonic mixtures accommodating a droplet in two of the species and a third minority component. Relying on the suitable Lee-Huang-Yang framework, we reveal a plethora of distinct self-bound droplet phases and their phase transitions through variations of either the particle number of the majority components or the intercomponent coupling. The ensuing phases demonstrate that the minority component is being un-trapped, partially trapped, or fully trapped by the majority droplet species. These states are characterized by their binding energies captured by the chemical potentials and their low-amplitude excitation spectrum, including mode crossings at the particle-emission threshold. We further derive effective reduced models which are valid in the high-imbalance limit, and accurately reproduce the numerically computed ground states, while providing analytical insights into the role of quantum fluctuations. Our results map out the stability and structure of mixed droplet phases offering guidance into forthcoming experimental and theoretical studies of multicomponent quantum droplets.

Title: Microscopic and hydrodynamic correlation in 1d hard rod gas
Authors: Indranil Mukherjee, Seema Chahal, Anupam Kundu
Abstract: We compute mass density correlations of a one-dimensional gas of hard rods at both microscopic and macroscopic scales. We provide exact analytical calculations of the microscopic correlation. For the correlation at macroscopic scale,, we utilize Ballistic Macroscopic Fluctuation Theory (BMFT) to derive an explicit expression for the correlations of a coarse-grained mass density, which reveals the emergence of long-range correlations on the Euler space-time scale. By performing a systematic coarse-graining of our exact microscopic results, we establish a micro-macro correspondence and demonstrate that the resulting macroscopic correlations agree precisely with the predictions of BMFT. This analytical verification provides a concrete validation of the underlying assumptions of hydrodynamic theory in the context of hard rod gas.

Title: Goldene monolayer as a highly effective catalyst for polysulfide anchoring and conversion: A theoretical study
Authors: Nicolas F. Martins, José A. dos S. Laranjeira, Bill D. A. Huacarpuma, Kleuton A. L. Lima, Luiz A. Ribeiro Jr, Julio R. Sambrano
Abstract: We use first-principles density functional theory to investigate how lithium sulfide and polysulfide clusters (Li2S, Li2S2, Li2S4, Li2S6, Li2S8, and S8) bind to Goldene, a new two-dimensional gold allotrope. All Li-S species exhibit robust binding to Goldene. The adsorption energies range from -4.29 to -1.90 eV. S8 that is alone interacts much less strongly. Charge density difference and Bader analyses indicate that substantial charge is transferred to the substrate, with a maximum 0.92 e for Li-rich clusters. This transfer induces polarization at the interface and shifts the work function to 5.30-5.52 eV. Projected density-of-states calculations indicate that Au-d and S-p states strongly mix near the Fermi level. This hybridization indicates that the electronic coupling is strong. Based on these results, the reaction free-energy profile for the stepwise conversion of S8 to Li2S on Goldene is thermodynamically favorable. The overall stabilization is -3.64 eV, and the rate-determining barrier for the Li2S2 -> Li2S step is 0.47 eV. This shows that Goldene is an effective surface for anchoring and mediating lithium polysulfide reactions.

Title: Three-dimensional Moiré crystallography
Authors: Ilya Popov, Elena Besley
Abstract: Moiré materials, typically confined to stacking atomically thin, two - dimensional (2D) layers such as graphene or transition metal dichalcogenides, have transformed our understanding of strongly correlated and topological quantum phenomena. The lattice mismatch and relative twist angle between 2D layers have shown to result in Moiré patterns associated with widely tunable electronic properties, ranging from Mott and Chern insulators to semi- and super-conductors. Extended to three-dimensional (3D) structures, Moiré materials unlock an entirely new crystallographic space defined by the elements of the 3D rotation group and translational symmetry of the constituent lattices. 3D Moiré crystals exhibit fascinating novel properties, often not found in the individual components, yet the general construction principles of 3D Moiré crystals remain largely unknown. Here we establish fundamental mathematical principles of 3D Moiré crystallography and propose a general method of 3D Moiré crystal construction using Clifford algebras over the field of rational numbers. We illustrate several examples of 3D Moiré structures representing realistic chemical frameworks and highlight their potential applications in condensed matter physics and solid-state chemistry.

Title: Spin-aligned butterfly spectral map in Non-Hermitian quasicrystals
Authors: Soumya Ranjan Padhi, Souvik Roy, Debashree Chowdhury, Tapan Mishra
Abstract: The Non-Hermitian spinful Aubry-André-Harper (AAH) model in the presence of Rashba-type spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) and a spatially varying textured magnetic field is studied. Interestingly, our analysis produces a butterfly spectral map due to the non-trivial extent of localization of the states in the spectrum. This spectral map also exhibits an asymmetric spin alignment with respect to the wings of the butterfly. Our analysis also suggests that the onset of such a spectral map is a combined effect of the non-hermiticity, spin-orbit interaction, and the textured magnetic field.

Title: Kitaev interactions in the van der Waals antiferromagnet VBr3
Authors: Zeyu Kao, Yimeng Gu, Yiqing Gu, Hao Zhang, Shiyi Zheng, Naoki Murai, Seiko Ohira-Kawamura, Jun Zhao
Abstract: Van der Waals materials hosting Kitaev interactions are promising platforms for exploring exotic quantum phenomena. Here, we report inelastic neutron scattering investigations of the van der Waals antiferromagnet VBr3, which forms a honeycomb lattice structure at room temperature and exhibits zigzag-type magnetic order below 26.5 K. Our observations reveal distinctive low-energy spin excitations arising from gamma, gamma', and M' points, each featuring a spin gap of around 2.5 meV. The overall spin excitation spectra can be effectively described by a spin Hamiltonian incorporating substantial nearest-neighbor Kitaev and biquadratic interactions, along with Heisenberg interactions. Our findings not only establish VBr3 as a new Kitaev magnet but also suggest that ligand engineering may provide a promising strategy to modulate Kitaev interactions, offering new opportunities for designing Kitaev materials with tailored quantum properties.

Title: Stable Machine Learning Potentials for Liquid Metals via Dataset Engineering
Authors: Alex Tai, Jason Ogbebor, Rodrigo Freitas
Abstract: Liquid metals are central to energy-storage and nuclear technologies, yet quantitative knowledge of their thermophysical properties remains limited. While atomistic simulations offer a route to computing liquid properties directly from atomic motion, the most accurate approach, ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD), is computationally costly and restricted to short time and length scales. Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLPs) offer AIMD accuracy at far lower cost, but their application to liquids is limited by training datasets that inadequately sample atomic configurations, leading to unphysical force predictions and unstable trajectories. Here we introduce a physically motivated dataset-engineering strategy that constructs liquidlike training data synthetically rather than relying on AIMD configurations. The method exploits the established icosahedral short-range order of metallic liquids, twelvefold, near-close-packed local coordination, and generates "synthetic-liquid" structures by systematic perturbation of crystalline references. MLPs trained on these datasets close the sampling gaps that lead to unphysical predictions, remain numerically stable across temperatures, and reproduce experimental liquid densities, diffusivities, and melting temperatures for multiple elemental metals. The framework links atomic-scale sampling to long-term MD stability and provides a practical route to predictive modeling of liquid-phase thermophysical behavior beyond the limits of direct AIMD.

Title: Correlative Ultrafast Imaging of a Propagating Photo-Driven Phase Transition Using 4D STEM
Authors: Arthur Niedermayr, Jianyu Wu, Bertina Fisher, Ido Kaminer, Jonas Weissenrieder
Abstract: Oxides exhibiting insulator-metal transitions are promising candidates for next generation ultrafast electronic switching devices. However, critical gaps remain in understanding the onset of strain and its dynamics as these materials undergo structural transitions, particularly in nanostructured configurations. Here, we present ultrafast four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy enabling virtual imaging and strain mapping at every point in space and time. Using this technique, we directly probe a laser-excited phase transition in the prototypical material vanadium dioxide (VO2), recording its spatiotemporal propagation. This direct imaging capability reveals the dynamics of the structural phase transition and connects it to the resulting strain formation on picosecond timescales. This correlation reveals how atomic-scale symmetry breaking inherently generates lattice distortions, which then propagate to govern macroscopic property changes. Our findings provide new insights into the coupling between electronic, structural, and mechanical responses in correlated oxides under non-equilibrium conditions.

Title: Electronic structure of Sn(1-x)Mn(x)Te semiconducting solid solution: a resonant photoemission study
Authors: Elzbieta Guziewicz, Bronislaw A. Orlowski, Bogdan J. Kowalski
Abstract: Manganese-doped tin telluride, Sn(1-x)Mn(x)Te, initially investigated as diluted magnetic semiconductor, has recently attracted considerable attention as a prospective thermoelectric material. The introduction of Mn was found to modify the valence band electronic structure, resulting in an improvement in the Seebeck coefficient and thus, the figure of merit (ZT). In the paper, we present a synchrotron radiation study of the electronic band structure of Sn(0.9)Mn(0.1)Te by resonant photoemission. The contribution of the Mn3d electrons to the valence band (VB), calculated as the difference between the Energy Distribution Curves (EDCs) taken at the maximum and minimum of the Fano resonance for the Mn3p - Mn3d absorption threshold, shows a contribution at the VB edge, a dominant maximum at 4 eV, as well as a wide structure between 7 and 11 eV. Moreover, comparison with undoped SnTe reveals strong renormalization of the Sn5p and Te5p electronic states, which certainly influences the shape of the upper part of the valence band and electron effective mass.

Title: Electrically Switchable Flat Band in Two-Dimensional Electron Gases under Nonuniform Magnetic Fields
Authors: You-Ting Huang, Chao-Cheng Kaun, Ching-Hao Chang
Abstract: Flat bands are associated with a range of desirable physical phenomena and potential applications, including enhanced superconducting tendencies due to the high density of states, strongly correlated phases such as quantum Hall states. Systems in which flat bands can be switched or tuned are therefore of particular interest. In this study, we analyze the electronic structure of two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) subjected to a linearly increasing magnetic-field dipole together with a transverse electric field, using the operator formalism of the quantum harmonic oscillator. When the electric field magnitude is tuned to a sequence of discrete values, different levels of energy bands are flattened. Moreover, at a specific electric field strength, the ground-state wave function admits an exact closed-form solution that can be understood through the magnetic drifts cancellation in the classical electrodynamics. We also demonstrate two distinct transmission properties, the quantized Hall conductance and the enhanced density of states, of the electrically switchable flat band. These findings establish a new route toward magnetoelectric band engineering and electrically guided transport in low-dimensional systems.

Title: Full counting statistics in the sine--Gordon model
Authors: Botond C. Nagy, Marton Kormos, Gabor Takacs
Abstract: Full counting statistics (FCS) is a dynamical generalisation of the free energy, encapsulating detailed information about the distribution and large-scale correlation functions of conserved charges and their associated currents. In this work, we present a comprehensive numerical study of the FCS and the cumulants of the three lowest charges across the full parameter space of the sine--Gordon field theory. To this end, we extend the thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz (TBA) formulation of the FCS to the sine--Gordon model, emphasise the methodological subtleties for a reliable numerical implementation, and compare numerical results with analytical predictions in certain limits.

Title: Hierarchical Crystal Structure Prediction of Zeolitic Imidazolate Frameworks Using DFT and Machine-Learned Interatomic Potentials

Morris (3), Mihails Arhangelskis (1) ((1) Faculty of Chemistry, University of Warsaw, (2) Division of Physical Chemistry, Ruder Boskovic Institute, (3) School of Metallurgy and Materials, University of Birmingham, (4) University of Southampton (5) School of Engineering, University of Cambridge)
Abstract: Crystal structure prediction (CSP) is emerging as a powerful method for the computational design of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). In this article we demonstrate the high-throughput exploration of the crystal energy landscape of zinc imidazolate (ZnIm2), a highly polymorphic member of the zeolitic imidazolate (ZIF) family, with at least 24 reported structural and topological forms, with new polymorphs still being regularly discovered. With the aid of custom-trained machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) we have performed a high-throughput sampling of over 3 million randomly-generated crystal packing arrangements and identified 9626 energy minima characterized by 1493 network topologies, including 864 topologies that have not been reported before. Comparisons with previously reported structures revealed 13 topological matches to the experimentally-observed structures of ZnIm2, demonstrating the power of the CSP method in sampling experimentally-relevant ZIF structures. Finally, through a combination of topological analysis, density and porosity considerations, we have identified a set of structures representing promising targets for future experimental screening. Finally, we demonstrate how CSP can be used to assist in the identification of the products of the mechanochemical synthesis.

Title: Quantum Spin Transfer of Spin-Correlated Electron Pairs
Authors: Seongmun Hwang, Jung Hyun Oh, Paul M. Haney, Mark D. Stiles, Kyung-Jin Lee
Abstract: We theoretically investigate quantum spin transfer from spin-correlated conduction-electron pairs to localized spins in a ferromagnet, given that electrons are correlated intrinsically. We show that even spin-singlet pairs and triplet pairs with $m=0$, both carrying no net spin, can transfer finite angular momentum through the quantum fluctuation term inherent to the $sd$ exchange interaction. The amount of transferred spin differs between the singlet and triplet $m=0$ states due to quantum interference. The difference is such that the independent-electron approximation remains valid for spin transfer when injected spin currents are completely incoherent. However, in partially coherent systems, like superconductor/ferromagnet junctions, coherent spin-singlet currents can directly convert into equal-spin triplet currents in generic ferromagnets, without requiring magnetic inhomogeniety or spin-orbit coupling.

Title: A First-principles Study of Weyl Nodal Loop and Multiple Sets of Weyl Points in Trigonal PtBi$_2$
Authors: Lin-Lin Wang
Abstract: Coexistence of surface superconductivity and Fermi arcs in trigonal $\gamma$-PtBi$_2$ has recently attracted attention for possible realization of topological superconductivity. The Fermi arcs on the two different (0001) surface terminations have been associated with the set of Weyl points just above the Fermi energy (E$_F$). Here using first-principles calculations to explore the band crossings over the full Brillouin zone between the nominally highest valence and lowest conduction bands in $\gamma$-PtBi$_2$, we find a Weyl nodal loop (WNL) and multiple sets of Weyl points (WPs). The main difference between the two reported experimental structural parameters is the magnitude of Bi-layer buckling. While the WNL, bulk gap region and the set of Weyl points just above the E$_F$ are robust, the number and location of the other sets of WPs depend sensitively on the structural parameters with different magnitude of Bi-layer buckling. Besides calculating the 2D Fermi surface with Fermi arcs and quasi-particle interference (QPI) around the E$_F$ in good agreements with ARPES and experimental QPI, we also predict new Fermi arc features at higher energy.

Title: Acoustic signatures of the field-induced electronic-topological transitions in YbNi$_4$P$_2$
Authors: E.-O. Eljaouhari, B. V. Schwarze, K. Kliemt, C. Krellner, F. Husstedt, J. Wosnitza, S. Zherlitsyn, G. Zwicknagl, J. Sourd
Abstract: We investigated the magnetoelastic properties of an YbNi$_4$P$_2$ single crystal at low temperatures under magnetic fields directed along the crystallographic [001] axis. We report a series of strong anomalies in the sound velocity, which is consistent with the cascade of electronic-topological transitions reported previously for this compound. In particular, we identify the vanishing of a small orbit on the Fermi surface, associated with a quantum-oscillation frequency of 34 T. Furthermore, the different transitions are better resolved with acoustic modes of particular symmetry. Using a microscopic model adapted to the strongly correlated electronic structure of YbNi$_4$P$_2$, we describe our results by inspecting realistic electron-phonon couplings in reciprocal space for each acoustic mode. This shows how the $k$ selectivity of ultrasound experiments allows to investigate Fermi-surface reconstructions in strongly correlated electronic systems.

Title: Enhanced Electron Reflectionat Mott-Insulator Interfaces
Authors: Jan Verlage, Peter Kratzer
Abstract: The Klein paradox describes an incoming electron being scattered at a supercritical barrier to create electron-positron pairs, a phenomenon widely discussed in textbooks. While demonstrating this phenomenon experimentally with the fundamental particles remains challenging, condensed matter analogs are more accessible to experimental realization. For spinless quasi-particles, theoretical works show an enhancement of the pair production rate, and analogs of this effect in condensed matter systems have been studied theoretically. Here, we present another condensed matter system, a heterostructure comprised of two materials with strongly and weakly interacting electrons, that allows for constructing analytical solutions using the hierarchy-of-correlations method. The results show enhanced electron reflection related with the production of doublon-holon pairs, as known from the Klein paradox.

Title: Prediction of Magnetic Topological Materials Combining Spin and Magnetic Space Groups
Authors: Liangliang Huang, Xiangang Wan, Feng Tang
Abstract: The scarcity of predicted magnetic topological materials (MTMs) by magnetic space group (MSG) hinders further exploration towards realistic device applications. Here, we propose a new scheme combining spin space groups (SSGs)--approximate symmetry groups neglecting spin-orbit coupling (SOC)--and MSGs to diagnose topology in collinear magnetic materials based on symmetry-indicator theory, enabling a systematic classification of the electronic topology across 484 experimentally synthesized collinear magnets from the MAGNDATA database. This new scheme exploits a symmetry-hierarchy due to SOC induced symmetry-breaking, so that nontrivial band topology can be revealed by SSG, that is yet invisible by the conventional MSG-based method, as exemplified by real triple points in ferromagnetic CaCu$_3$Fe$_2$Sb$_2$O$_{12}$, Dirac nodal lines at generic $k$-points in antiferromagnetic FePSe$_3$ and Weyl nodal lines in altermagnetic Sr$_4$Fe$_4$O$_{11}$. Notably, FePSe$_3$ is topologically trivial under MSG but hosts Dirac nodal lines within the SSG framework. Upon including SOC, these nodal lines are gapped and generate a sizable anomalous Hall conductivity. Despite a vanishing bulk net magnetism, FePSe$_3$ can host topologically protected surface states with large non-relativistic band spin-splitting. Moreover, topology in MTMs is tunable by rotating the magnetic moment direction once SOC is included, as exemplified in Sr$_4$Fe$_4$O$_{11}$.The interplay of topology with non-relativistic and SOC-induced control of properties via magnetic moment reorientation in the predicted MTMs is worthy of further studies in future.

Title: Low-loss Material for Infrared Protection of Cryogenic Quantum Applications
Authors: Markus Griedel, Max Kristen, Biliana Gasharova, Yves-Laurent Mathis, Alexey V. Ustinov, Hannes Rotzinger
Abstract: The fragile quantum states of low-temperature quantum applications require protection from infrared radiation caused by higher-temperature stages or other sources. We propose a material system that can efficiently block radiation up to the optical range while transmitting photons at low gigahertz frequencies. It is based on the effect that incident photons are strongly scattered when their wavelength is comparable to the size of particles embedded in a weakly absorbing medium (Mie-scattering). The goal of this work is to tailor the absorption and transmission spectrum of an non-magnetic epoxy resin containing sapphire spheres by simulating its dependence on the size distribution. Additionally, we fabricate several material compositions, characterize them, as well as other materials, at optical, infrared, and gigahertz frequencies. In the infrared region (stop band) the attenuation of the Mie-scattering optimized material is high and comparable to that of other commonly used filter materials. At gigahertz frequencies (pass-band), the prototype filter exhibits a high transmission at millikelvin temperatures, with an insertion loss of less than $0.4\,$dB below $10\,$GHz.

Title: Beyond the imbalance: site-resolved dynamics probing resonances in many-body localization
Authors: Asmi Haldar, Thibault Scoquart, Fabien Alet, Nicolas Laflorencie
Abstract: We explore the limitations of using imbalance dynamics as a diagnostic tool for many-body localization (MBL) and show that spatial averaging can mask important microscopic features. Focusing on the strongly disordered regime of the random-field XXZ chain, we use state-of-the-art numerical techniques (Krylov time evolution and full diagonalization) to demonstrate that site-resolved spin autocorrelators reveal a rich and complex dynamical behavior that is obscured by the imbalance observable. By analyzing the time evolution and infinite-time limits of these local probes, we reveal resonant structures and rare local instabilities within the MBL phase. These numerical findings are supported by an analytical, few-site toy model that captures the emergence of a multiple-peak structure in local magnetization histograms, which is a hallmark of local resonances. These few-body local effects provide a more detailed understanding of ergodicity-breaking dynamics, and also allow us to explain the finite-size effects of long-time imbalance, and its sensitivity to the initial conditions in quench protocols. Overall, our experimentally testable predictions highlight the necessity of a refined, site-resolved approach to fully understand the complexities of MBL and its connection to rare-region effects.

Title: Local Multimodal Dynamics in Mixed Ionic-Electronic Conductors and Their Fingerprints in Organic Electrochemical Transistor Operation
Authors: Shubham Tanwar, Han-Yan Wu, Chi-Yuan Yang, Ruben Millan-Solsona, Simone Fabiano, Adrica Kyndiah, Gabriel Gomila
Abstract: Mixed ionic-electronic conductors host tightly coupled interactions among mobile ions, electronic charges, and the polymer matrix, giving rise to complex multimodal responses spanning electrical, mechanical, and morphological transformations. These materials underpin organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs), which translate such interactions into low-voltage signal amplification and sensing for applications in bioelectronics, neuromorphic computing, and memory. Despite their central role, OECT current-voltage transfer characteristics are often treated phenomenologically, as both the local multimodal dynamics and their connection to global device response remain unresolved. Here, we reveal that the transfer curve encodes a cascade of spatially localized electrochemical transitions, each associated with distinct changes in conductivity, stiffness, and morphology, fundamentally redefining it as a spatially resolved fingerprint of device's internal state. Using automated operando multimodal in-liquid scanning dielectric microscopy, we directly map these dynamics and identify region-specific electrochemical thresholds governing the interplay between source, channel, and drain. We found that the local tip-sample electrostatic force serves as a remarkable mechanistic observable of coupled multimodal dynamics in mixed conductors. A physically grounded model links it to general material, interfacial, and geometric parameters, enabling mechanistic interpretation and predictive insights. Our work provides a new framework for probing and understanding mixed conduction in ion-electron coupled systems.

Title: Hydrodynamic interactions in a binary-mixture colloidal monolayer
Authors: M. Chamorro-Burgos, Alvaro Domínguez
Abstract: A colloidal monolayer embedded in the bulk of a fluid experiences a "compressible", long-range hydrodynamic interaction which, far from boundaries, leads to a breakdown of Fick's law above a well defined length scale, showing up as anomalous collective diffusion. We here extend the model to study the effect of the hydrodynamic interaction on a monolayer formed by two types of particles. The most interesting finding is a new regime, in the limit of very dissimilar kinds of particles, where the effective dynamics of the concentration of "big" (slow) particles appears to obey Fick's law at large scales, but the corresponding collective diffusivity is completely determined, through hydrodynamic coupling, by the diffusivity of the "small" (fast) particles.

Title: Surface chiral Abelian topological order on multilayer cluster Mott insulators
Authors: Xu-Ping Yao, Chao-Kai Li, Gang v. Chen
Abstract: The surface states of a symmetry protected topological state can have many possibilities. Here we propose a chiral Abelian topological order on a distinct surface of a multilayer-stacked cluster Mott insulating system. The first-principle calculation and the slave-rotor mean-field theory are applied to study the surface states of the relevant material system. The angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopic measurement is further suggested to detect the anomalous surface fractionalization of the chiral Abelian topological order on the surface. The connection with real materials is further discussed. We expect our results to inspire the interest in the emergent exotic and correlation physics among the cluster Mott insulating systems and in the interplay between the two different branches of topological phases.

Title: Chiral Graviton Modes in Fermionic Fractional Chern Insulators
Authors: Min Long, Zeno Bacciconi, Hongyu Lu, Hernan B. Xavier, Zi Yang Meng, Marcello Dalmonte
Abstract: Chiral graviton modes are hallmark collective excitations of Fractional Quantum Hall (FQH) liquids. However, their existence on the lattice, where continuum symmetries that protect them from decay are lost, is still an open and urgent question, especially considering the recent advances in the realization of Fractional Chern Insulators (FCI) in transition metal dichalcogenides and rhombohedral pentalayer graphene. Here we present a comprehensive theoretical and numerical study of graviton-modes in fermionic FCI, and thoroughly demonstrate their existence. We first derive a lattice stress tensor operator in the context of the fermionic Harper-Hofstadter(HH) model which captures the graviton in the flat band limit. Importantly, we discover that such lattice stress-tensor operators are deeply connected to lattice quadrupolar density correlators, readily generalizable to generic Chern bands. We then explicitly show the adiabatic connection between FQH and FCI chiral graviton modes by interpolating from a low flux HH model to a Checkerboard lattice model that hosts a topological flat band. In particular, using state-of-the-art matrix product state and exact diagonalization simulations, we provide strong evidence that chiral graviton modes are long-lived excitations in FCIs despite the lack of continuous symmetries and the scattering with a two-magnetoroton continuum. By means of a careful finite-size analysis, we show that the lattice generates a finite but small intrinsic decay rate for the graviton mode. We discuss the relevance of our results for the exploration of graviton modes in FCI phases realized in solid state settings, as well as cold atom experiments.

Abstract: Ab initio calculations and angle-resolved photoemission experiments show that the bulk and surface electronic structure of Weyl semimetal candidate MoTe$_2$ changes significantly by tuning the chemical potential by less than 0.4 eV. Calculations show that several Lifshitz transitions can occur among multiple electron and hole Fermi pockets of differing orbital character. Experiments show that 18% Nb-Mo substitution reduces the occupation of bulk and (001) surface bands, effectively producing a chemical potential shift of $\approx 0.3$ eV. Orbital character and dimensionality of the bulk bands is examined by soft X-ray angle resolved photoemission with control of the excitation light polarization. The band filling at the surface is shown to increase upon deposition of alkali atoms. The results indicate that multiple regimes of electronic properties can be easily accessed in this versatile, layered material.

Title: Fluctuation-response relation for a nonequilibrium system with resolved Markovian embedding
Authors: Rémi Goerlich, Antoine Tartar, Yael Roichman, Igor M Sokolov
Abstract: Fluctuation-response relations must be modified to describe nonequilibrium systems with non-Markovian dynamics. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that such relation is quantitatively recovered when the appropriate Markovian embedding of the dynamics is explicitly resolved. Using a colloidal particle optically trapped in a harmonic potential and driven out of equilibrium by a controlled colored noise, we study the response to a perturbation of the stiffness of the confining potential. While the reduced dynamics violates equilibrium fluctuation-response relations, we show that the dynamical response to the stiffness perturbation is fully determined by steady-state correlations involving the exact conjugate observable in the Markovian embedding.

Title: Mechanics of axis formation in $\textit{Hydra}$
Authors: Arthur Hernandez, Cuncheng Zhu, Luca Giomi
Abstract: The emergence of a body axis is a fundamental step in the development of multicellular organisms. In simple systems such as $\textit{Hydra}$, growing evidence suggests that mechanical forces generated by collective cellular activity play a central role in this process. Here, we explore a physical mechanism for axis formation based on the coupling between active stresses and tissue elasticity. We analyse the elastic deformation induced by activity-generated stresses and show that, owing to the spherical topology of the tissue, forces globally condense toward configurations in which both elastic strain and nematic defect localise at opposite poles. These mechanically selected states define either a polar or apolar head-food axis. To characterize the condensed regime, we introduce a compact parametrization of of the active force and flux distributions, enabling analytical predictions and direct comparison with experiments. Using this framework, we calculate experimentally relevant observables, including areal strain, lateral pressure, and normal displacements during muscular contraction, as well as the detailed structure of topological defect complexes in head and foot regions. Together, our results identify a mechanical route by which active tissues can spontaneously break symmetry at the organismal scale, suggesting a general physical principle underlying body-axis specification during morphogenesis.

Title: When and why non-Hermitian eigenvalues miss eigenstates in topological physics
Authors: Lucien Jezequel, Loïc Herviou, Jens Bardarson
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems exhibit a fundamental spectral dichotomy absent in Hermitian physics: the eigenvalue spectrum and the eigenstate spectrum can deviate significantly in the thermodynamic limit. We explain how non-Hermitian Hamiltonians can support eigenstates completely undetected by eigenvalues, with the unidirectional Hatano-Nelson model serving as both a minimal realization and universal paradigm for this phenomenon. Through exact analytical solutions, we show that this model contains not only hidden modes but multiple macroscopic hidden exceptional points that appear more generally in all systems with a non-trivial bulk winding. Our framework explains how the apparent bulk-edge correspondence failures in models like the non-Hermitian SSH chain instead reflect the systematic inability of the eigenvalue spectrum to detect certain eigenstates in systems with a skin-effect. These results establish the limitation of the eigenvalue spectrum and suggest how the eigenstate approach can lead to improved characterization of non-Hermitian topology.

Title: Stability of the Local Ni$^{2+}$ Electronic Structure to $A$-site Disorder in the Pyrochlore Antiferromagnet NaCaNi$_2$F$_7$
Authors: M. F. DiScala, A. de la Torre, J. W. Krizan, J. Wouters, V. Bisogni, J. Pelliciari, R. J. Cava, K. W. Plumb
Abstract: NaCaNi$_2$F$_7$ is a unique example of spin-1 Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the pyrochlore lattice, but the presence of Na$^{1+}$/Ca$^{2+}$ $A$-site disorder complicates the local electronic and magnetic environment of the Ni$^{2+}$ $B$-site. We utilize resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) to study the influence of $A$-site disorder on the $B$-site electronic structure of NaCaNi$_2$F$_7$. Ni L-edge RIXS measurements reveal a Ni$^{2+}$ electronic structure in nearly ideal octahedral coordination, with only a small trigonal compression ($\delta$ = -200$\;$meV) required to capture all spectral features. Within the $D_{3d}$ symmetry of the Ni local environment, we extract an anisotropic $g$-factor of $g_{\parallel} = 2.26$ and $g_{\perp} = 2.27$, and a corresponding paramagnetic moment of $\mu_{\rm{eff}}=3.2\;\mu_B$. To simulate disorder, RIXS spectra were calculated with realistic distributions of crystal field parameters; however, these spectra are invariant relative to a disorder-free model, demonstrating the robustness of the Ni$^{2+}$ electronic environment to the $A$-site disorder, within the resolution of our measurement.

Title: How many-body chaos emerges in the presence of quasiparticles
Authors: Sibaram Ruidas, Sthitadhi Roy, Subhro Bhattacharjee, Roderich Moessner
Abstract: Many-body chaos is a default property of many-body systems; at the same time, near-integrable behaviour due to weakly interacting quasiparticles is ubiquitous throughout condensed matter at low temperature. There must therefore be a, possibly generic, crossover between these very different regimes. Here, we develop a theory encapsulating the notion of a cascade of lightcones seeded by sequences of scattering of weakly interacting harmonic modes as witnessed by a suitably defined chaos diagnostic (classical decorrelator) that measures the spatiotemporal profile of many-body chaos. Our numerics deals with the concrete case of a classical Heisenberg chain, for either sign of the interaction, at low temperatures where the short-time dynamics are well captured in terms of non-interacting spin waves. To model low-temperature dynamics, we use ensembles of initial states with randomly embedded point defects in an otherwise ordered background, which provides a controlled setting for studying the scattering events. The decorrelator exhibits a short-time integrable regime followed by an intermediate `scarred' regime of the cascade of lightcones in progress; these then overlap, leading to an avalanche of scattering events which finally yields the standard long-time signature of many-body chaos.

Title: Gauging Open EFTs from the top down
Authors: Greg Kaplanek, Maria Mylova, Andrew J. Tolley
Abstract: We present explicit top-down calculations of Open EFTs for gauged degrees of freedom with a focus on the effects of gauge fixing. Starting from the in-in contour with two copies of the action, we integrate out the charged matter in various $U(1)$ gauge theories to obtain the Feynman-Vernon influence functional for the photon, or, in the case of symmetry breaking, for the photon and Stückelberg fields. The influence functional is defined through a quantum path integral, which -- as is always the case when quantizing gauge degrees of freedom -- contains redundancies that must be eliminated via a gauge-fixing procedure. We implement the BRST formalism in this setting. The in-in boundary conditions break the two copies of BRST symmetry down to a single diagonal copy. Nevertheless the single diagonal BRST is sufficient to ensure that the influence functional is itself gauge invariant under two copies of gauge symmetries, retarded and advanced, regardless of the choice of state or symmetry-breaking phase. We clarify how this is consistent with the decoupling limit where the global advanced symmetry is generically broken by the state. We illustrate our results with several examples: a gauge field theory analogue of the Caldeira-Leggett model, spinor QED with fermions integrated out, scalar QED in a thermal state, the Abelian Higgs-Kibble model in the spontaneously broken state with the Higgs integrated out, and Abelian Higgs-Kibble model coupled to a charged bath in a symmetry-broken phase. The latter serves as an example of an open system for Stückelberg/Goldstone fields.

Title: Finding Graph Isomorphisms in Heated Spaces in Almost No Time
Authors: Sara Najem, Amer E. Mouawad
Abstract: Determining whether two graphs are structurally identical is a fundamental problem with applications spanning mathematics, computer science, chemistry, and network science. Despite decades of study, graph isomorphism remains a challenging algorithmic task, particularly for highly symmetric structures. Here we introduce a new algorithmic approach based on ideas from spectral graph theory and geometry that constructs candidate correspondences between vertices using their curvatures. Any correspondence produced by the algorithm is explicitly verified, ensuring that non-isomorphic graphs are never incorrectly identified as isomorphic. Although the method does not yet guarantee success on all isomorphic inputs, we find that it correctly resolves every instance tested in deterministic polynomial time, including a broad collection of graphs known to be difficult for classical spectral techniques. These results demonstrate that enriched spectral methods can be far more powerful than previously understood, and suggest a promising direction for the practical resolution of the complexity of the graph isomorphism problem.

Title: Exploring Metal Additive Manufacturing in Martian Atmospheric Environments
Authors: Zane Mebruer, Wan Shou
Abstract: In-space manufacturing is essential for achieving long-term planetary colonization, particularly on Mars, where material transport from Earth is both costly and logistically restrictive. Traditional subtractive manufacturing methods are highly equipment-, energy-, and material-intensive, making additive manufacturing (AM) a more practical and sustainable alternative for extraterrestrial production. Among various AM technologies, selective laser melting (SLM) stands out due to its exceptional versatility, precision, and capability to produce dense metallic parts with complex geometries. However, conventional SLM processes rely heavily on inert argon environments to prevent oxidation and ensure high-quality part formation, conditions that are difficult to reproduce on Mars. This study investigates the feasibility of using carbon dioxide (CO2), which makes up over 95% of the Martian atmosphere, as a potential substitute for argon in SLM. Single-track and two-dimensional 316L stainless steel specimens were fabricated under argon, CO2, and ambient air environments with a wide range of laser parameters to evaluate the influence of atmospheric composition on surface morphology, microstructural cohesion, and oxidation behavior. The results reveal that no single parameter controls the overall part quality; rather, a balance of parameters is essential to maintain thermal equilibrium during fabrication. Although parts produced in CO2 exhibited slightly inferior surface finish, cohesion, and oxidation resistance compared to argon, they performed significantly better than those fabricated in ambient air. These findings suggest that CO2-assisted SLM could enable sustainable in situ manufacturing on Mars and may also serve as a cost-effective alternative shielding gas for terrestrial applications.

Title: Chiral Lattice Gauge Theories from Symmetry Disentanglers
Authors: Ryan Thorngren, John Preskill, Lukasz Fidkowski
Abstract: We propose a Hamiltonian framework for constructing chiral gauge theories on the lattice based on symmetry disentanglers: constant-depth circuits of local unitaries that transform not-on-site symmetries into on-site ones. When chiral symmetry can be realized not-on-site and such a disentangler exists, the symmetry can be implemented in a strictly local Hamiltonian and gauged by standard lattice methods. Using lattice rotor models, we realize this idea in 1+1 and 3+1 spacetime dimensions for $U(1)$ symmetries with mixed 't Hooft anomalies, and show that symmetry disentanglers can be constructed when anomalies cancel. As an example, we present an exactly solvable Hamiltonian lattice model of the (1+1)-dimensional "3450" chiral gauge theory, and we argue that a related construction applies to the $U(1)$ hypercharge symmetry of the Standard Model fermions in 3+1 dimensions. Our results open a new route toward fully local, nonperturbative formulations of chiral gauge theories.

Title: Microscopic Dynamics of False Vacuum Decay in the $2+1$D Quantum Ising Model
Authors: Umberto Borla, Achilleas Lazarides, Christian Groß, Jad C. Halimeh
Abstract: False vacuum decay, which is understood to happen through bubble nucleation, is a prominent phenomenon relevant to elementary particle physics and early-universe cosmology. Understanding its microscopic dynamics in higher spatial dimensions is currently a major challenge and research thrust. Recent advances in numerical techniques allow for the extraction of related signatures in tractable systems in two spatial dimensions over intermediate timescales. Here, we focus on the $2+1$D quantum Ising model, where a longitudinal field is used to energetically separate the two $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry-broken ferromagnetic ground states, turning them into a ``true'' and ``false'' vacuum. Using tree tensor networks, we simulate the microscopic dynamics of a spin-down domain in a spin-up background after a homogeneous quench, with parameters chosen so that the domain corresponds to a bubble of the true vacuum in a false-vacuum background. Our study identifies how the ultimate fate of the bubble -- indefinite expansion or collapse -- depends on its geometrical features and on the microscopic parameters of the Ising Hamiltonian. We further provide a realistic quantum-simulation scheme, aimed at probing bubble dynamics on atomic Rydberg arrays.

Title: Framing Anomaly in Lattice Chern-Simons-Maxwell Theory
Authors: Ze-An Xu, Jing-Yuan Chen
Abstract: Framing anomaly is a key property of $(2+1)d$ chiral topological orders, for it reveals that the chirality is an intrinsic bulk property of the system, rather than a property of the boundary between two systems. Understanding framing anomaly in lattice models is particularly interesting, as concrete, solvable lattice models of chiral topological orders are rare. In a recent work, we defined and solved the $U(1)$ Chern-Simons-Maxwell theory on spacetime lattice, showing its chiral edge mode and the associated gravitational anomaly on boundary. In this work, we show its framing anomaly in the absence of boundary, by computing the expectation of a lattice version of the modular $T$ operator in the ground subspace on a spatial torus, from which we extract that $\langle T \rangle$ has a universal phase of $-2\pi/12$ as expected: $-2\pi/8$ from the Gauss-Milgram sum of the topological spins of the ground states, and $2\pi/24$ from the framing anomaly; we can also extract the $2\pi/24$ framing anomaly phase alone from the full spectrum of $T$ in the ground subspace by computing $\langle T^m \rangle$. This pins down the last and most crucial property required for a valid lattice definition of $U(1)$ Chern-Simons theory.

Title: When evolution realizes large deviations of fitness: from speciation to dynamical phase transitions
Authors: Sara Dal Cengio, Quentin Laurenceau, Vivien Lecomte, Charline Smadi, Julien Tailleur
Abstract: We explore the connection between evolution and large-deviation theory. To do so, we study evolutionary dynamics in which individuals experience mutations, reproduction, and selection using variants of the Moran model. We show that, in the large population size limit, the impact of reproduction and selection amounts to realizing a large-deviation dynamics for the non-interacting random walk in which individuals simply explore the genome landscape due to mutations. This mapping, which holds at all times, allows us to recast transitions in the population genome distribution as dynamical phase transitions, which can then be studied using the toolbox of large-deviation theory. Finally, we show that the mapping extends beyond the class of Moran models.

Title: Four-point function of the complex Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model at finite chemical potential
Authors: Can Onur Akyuz, Erick Arguello Cruz, Ludo Fraser-Taliente, Grigory Tarnopolsky
Abstract: It is known that, for a range of chemical potentials, the infrared behavior of the complex Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (cSYK) model is governed by a 1D Nearly Conformal Field Theory (NCFT$_{1}$), thereby realizing a continuous line of NCFTs. A finite chemical potential $\mu$ introduces an asymmetry parameter $\mathscr{E}$ into the cSYK fermion two-point function in the conformal limit. In this work, we compute the cSYK four-point function in the conformal limit for an arbitrary value of $\mathscr{E}$ at leading order in $1/N$. We show that the result is fully consistent with the NCFT$_{1}$ structure of the cSYK model and use it to extract the structure constants for correlation functions of two complex fermions with bilinear operators.

Title: Quantum sensing with critical systems: impact of symmetry, imperfections, and decoherence
Authors: Yinan Chen, Sara Murciano, Pablo Sala, Jason Alicea
Abstract: Entangled many-body states enable high-precision quantum sensing beyond the standard quantum limit. We develop interferometric sensing protocols based on quantum critical wavefunctions and compare their performance with Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) and spin-squeezed states. Building on the idea of symmetries as a metrological resource, we introduce a symmetry-based algorithm to identify optimal measurement strategies. We illustrate this algorithm both for magnetic systems with internal symmetries and Rydberg-atom arrays with spatial symmetries. We study the robustness of criticality for quantum sensing under non-unitary deformations, symmetry-preserving and symmetry-breaking decoherence, and qubit loss -- identifying regimes where critical systems outperform GHZ states and showing that non-unitary deformation can even enhance sensing precision. Combined with recent results on log-depth preparation of critical wavefunctions, interferometric sensing in this setting appears increasingly promising.

Title: Exact Multimode Quantization of Superconducting Circuits via Boundary Admittance
Authors: Mustafa Bakr, Robin Wopalenski
Abstract: We show that the Schur complement of the nodal admittance matrix, which reduces a multiport electromagnetic environment to the driving-point admittance $Y_{\mathrm{in}}(s)$ at the Josephson junction, naturally leads to an eigenvalue-dependent boundary condition determining the dressed mode spectrum. This identification provides a four-step quantization procedure: (i) compute or measure $Y_{\mathrm{in}}(s)$, (ii) solve the boundary condition $sY_{\mathrm{in}}(s) + 1/L_J = 0$ for dressed frequencies, (iii) synthesize an equivalent passive network, (iv) quantize with the full cosine nonlinearity retained. Within passive lumped-element circuit theory, we prove that junction participation decays as, we prove that junction participation decays as $O(\omega_n^{-1})$ at high frequencies when the junction port has finite shunt capacitance, ensuring ultraviolet convergence of perturbative sums without imposed cutoffs. The standard circuit QED parameters, coupling strength $g$, anharmonicity $\alpha$, and dispersive shift $\chi$, emerge as controlled limits with explicit validity conditions.

Title: Processing-Dependent Near-Field Radiative Heat Transfer at Au/SiC Interfaces
Authors: A. Márquez, R. Esquivel-Sirvent
Abstract: Thermal annealing is a widely used thin-film processing technique for modifying interfacial optical losses and electronic scattering in plasmonic materials. Here, we investigate how thermal annealing of gold thin films deposited on silicon carbide substrates influences interfacial near-field radiative heat transfer across nanoscale vacuum gaps. Using experimentally measured dielectric functions for annealed and unannealed Au films, we evaluate the spectral and total radiative heat flux between Au/SiC interfaces within a fluctuational electrodynamics framework. We show that annealing-induced changes in the low-frequency dielectric losses of Au significantly alter evanescent electromagnetic coupling at the interface, leading to enhancements of up to ~40\% in the total near-field radiative heat transfer at separations of tens of nanometers. Mode-resolved analysis reveals that this enhancement originates from strengthened coupling of overdamped plasmonic surface modes, which are highly sensitive to thin-film processing and interfacial microstructure. These results demonstrate that standard thermal annealing provides a practical route for tuning interfacial radiative heat transfer in metallic thin-film systems without modifying material composition or geometry, offering guidance for the design and interpretation of nanoscale thermal and plasmonic interfaces.

Title: Mixed-mode loading of a straight crack with surface strain-gradient elasticity
Authors: C. Rodriguez, A. Zemlyanova
Abstract: This work models brittle fracture using a linearized surface-substrate theory in which the crack faces possess surface stresses derived from a surface strain-gradient elastic energy. The model incorporates surface stretching, curvature, and surface gradients of stretching into the surface energy, thereby capturing small-length-scale effects absent from earlier surface elasticity formulations. The theory, supplemented with physically motivated tip conditions, is applied to the mixed mode-I/mode-II loading of a finite straight crack in an infinite isotropic plate. Using complex-analytic techniques, it is shown that the resulting stress and strain fields remain bounded up to the crack tips for nearly all admissible parameter values. Combined with previous results for mode-III loading, the analysis demonstrates that linearized surface-substrate models incorporating surface strain-gradient elasticity eliminate crack-tip singularities across all principal modes of far-field loading.

Title: Momentum-Space Entanglement Entropy as a Universal Signature of Dynamical Quantum Phase Transitions
Authors: Kaiyuan Cao, Mingzhi Li, Xiang-Ping Jiang, Shu Chen, Jian Wang
Abstract: We introduce a momentum-space entanglement entropy to quantify quantum correlations between distinct momentum modes following a quench. We prove analytically in the transverse-field Ising (TFI) model and the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain that every critical momentum $k^{*}$ associated with a dynamical quantum phase transition (DQPT) saturates its entanglement entropy to the maximal value $\ln{d}$ ($d=2$ in TFI and SSH models), coinciding with the vanishing of the Loschmidt echo. This saturation of mode entanglement thus provides a universal, direct signature of DQPTs. Our work thus establishes a unified, entanglement-based perspective on dynamical quantum phase transitions.

Title: Classical solution of the FeMo-cofactor model to chemical accuracy and its implications
Authors: Huanchen Zhai, Chenghan Li, Xing Zhang, Zhendong Li, Seunghoon Lee, Garnet Kin-Lic Chan
Abstract: The main source of reduced nitrogen for living things comes from nitrogenase, which converts N2 to NH3 at the FeMo-cofactor (FeMo-co). Because of its role in supporting life, the uncertainty surrounding the catalytic cycle, and its compositional richness with eight transition metal ions, FeMo-co has fascinated scientists for decades. After much effort, the complete atomic structure was resolved. However, its electronic structure, central to reactivity, remains under intense debate. FeMo-co's complexity, arising from many unpaired electrons, has led to suggestions that it lies beyond the reach of classical computing. Consequently, there has been much interest in the potential of quantum algorithms to compute its electronic structure. Estimating the cost to compute the ground-state to chemical accuracy (~1 kcal/mol) within one or more FeMo-co models is a common benchmark of quantum algorithms in quantum chemistry, with numerous resource estimates in the literature. Here we address how to perform the same task using classical computation. We use a 76 orbital/152 qubit resting state model, the subject of most quantum resource estimates. Based on insight into the multiple configuration nature of the states, we devise classical protocols that yield rigorous or empirical upper bounds to the ground-state energy. Extrapolating these we predict the ground-state energy with an estimated uncertainty on the order of chemical accuracy. Having performed this long-discussed computational task, we next consider implications beyond the model. We distill a simpler computational procedure which we apply to reveal the electronic landscape in realistic representations of the cofactor. We thus illustrate a path to a precise computational understanding of FeMo-co electronic structure.

Title: Higher-Order Knowledge Representations for Agentic Scientific Reasoning
Authors: Isabella A. Stewart, Markus J. Buehler
Abstract: Scientific inquiry requires systems-level reasoning that integrates heterogeneous experimental data, cross-domain knowledge, and mechanistic evidence into coherent explanations. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer inferential capabilities, they often depend on retrieval-augmented contexts that lack structural depth. Traditional Knowledge Graphs (KGs) attempt to bridge this gap, yet their pairwise constraints fail to capture the irreducible higher-order interactions that govern emergent physical behavior. To address this, we introduce a methodology for constructing hypergraph-based knowledge representations that faithfully encode multi-entity relationships. Applied to a corpus of ~1,100 manuscripts on biocomposite scaffolds, our framework constructs a global hypergraph of 161,172 nodes and 320,201 hyperedges, revealing a scale-free topology (power law exponent ~1.23) organized around highly connected conceptual hubs. This representation prevents the combinatorial explosion typical of pairwise expansions and explicitly preserves the co-occurrence context of scientific formulations. We further demonstrate that equipping agentic systems with hypergraph traversal tools, specifically using node-intersection constraints, enables them to bridge semantically distant concepts. By exploiting these higher-order pathways, the system successfully generates grounded mechanistic hypotheses for novel composite materials, such as linking cerium oxide to PCL scaffolds via chitosan intermediates. This work establishes a "teacherless" agentic reasoning system where hypergraph topology acts as a verifiable guardrail, accelerating scientific discovery by uncovering relationships obscured by traditional graph methods.

Title: A joint voxel flow - phase field framework for ultra-long microstructure evolution prediction with physical regularization
Authors: Ao Zhou, Salma Zahran, Chi Chen, Zhengyang Zhang, Yanming Wang
Abstract: Phase-field (PF) modeling is a powerful tool for simulating microstructure evolution. To overcome the high computational cost of PF in solving complex PDEs, machine learning methods such as PINNs, convLSTM have been used to predict PF evolution. However, current methods still face shortages of low flexibility, poor generalization and short predicting time length. In this work, we present a joint framework coupling voxel-flow network (VFN) with PF simulations in an alternating manner for long-horizon temporal prediction of microstructure evolution. The VFN iteratively predicts future evolution by learning the flow of pixels from past snapshots, with periodic boundaries preserved in the process. Periodical PF simulations suppresses nonphysical artifacts, reduces accumulated error, and extends reliable prediction time length. The VFN is about 1,000 times faster than PF simulation on GPU. In validation using grain growth and spinodal decomposition, MSE and SSIM remain 6.76% and 0.911 when predicted 18 frames from only 2 input frames, outperforming similar predicting methods. For an ultra-long grain growth prediction for 82 frames from 2 input frames, grain number decreases from 600 to 29 with NMSE of average grain area remaining 1.64%. This joint framework enables rapid, generalized, flexible and physically consistent microstructure forecasting from image-based data for ultra-long time scales.

Title: Virtual temperatures as a key quantifier for passive states in quantum thermodynamic processes
Authors: Sachin Sonkar, Ramandeep S. Johal
Abstract: We analyze the role of virtual temperatures for passive quantum states through the lens of majorization theory. A mean temperature over the virtual temperatures of adjacent energy levels is defined to compare the passive states of the system resulting from isoenergetic and isoentropic transformations. The role of the minimum and the maximum (min-max) values of the virtual temperatures in determining the direction of heat flow between the system and the environment is argued based on majorization relations. We characterize the intermediate passive states in a quantum Otto engine using these virtual temperatures and derive an upper bound for the Otto efficiency that can be expressed in terms of the min-max virtual temperatures of the working medium. An explicit example of the coupled-spins system is worked out. Moreover, virtual temperatures serve to draw interesting parallels between the quantum thermodynamic processes and their classical counterparts. Thus, virtual temperature emerges as a key operational quantity linking passivity and majorization to the optimal performance of quantum thermal machines.

Title: Long-lived state of a helium-like magnesium donor in silicon

Abstract: The relaxation of ortho states of a helium-like Mg donor in silicon is investigated by measuring the modulation of background radiation transmission through impurity centers under pulsed photoexcitation. Long-lived states of the spin-triplet 1s(3T2) group with a lifetime of about 20 ms are observed. The temperature dependence indicates that the relaxation is governed by the Orbach mechanism with an activation energy ~13 meV, which is close to the exchange splitting energy of the excited 1s states of the Mg donor.

Title: Signatures of Spin Coherence in Chiral Coupled Quantum Dots
Authors: Hanna T. Fridman, Rotem Malkinson, Amir Hen, Shira Yochelis, Yossi Paltiel, Nir Bar-gill
Abstract: Chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS) enables spin selectivity of charge carriers in chiral molecular systems without magnetic materials. While spin selectivity has been widely investigated, its quantum coherence has not yet been explored. Here, we in- vestigate spin-dependent photoluminescence (PL) dynamics in multilayer quantum-dot (QD) assemblies coupled by chiral linkers. Using circularly polarized excitation in the presence of an external magnetic field, we observe a pronounced modulation of the PL lifetime that depends on the magnetic field magnitude and geometry. The lifetime difference between left- and right-circularly polarized excitations exhibits a field-angle dependence, consistent with spin precession driven by the transverse magnetic-field component relative to the chiral axis. A model incorporating coupled spin precession and decay processes reproduces the experimental trends. These results establish chiral QD assemblies as a room-temperature platform for probing quantum coherent manifestations of the CISS effect, with implications for spintronic and quantum technologies.

Title: Entanglement negativity for a free scalar chiral current
Authors: Malen Arias, Marina Huerta, Andrei Rotaru, Erik Tonni
Abstract: We study the entanglement negativity for the free, scalar chiral current in two spacetime dimensions, which is a simple model violating the Haag duality in regions with nontrivial topology. For the ground state of the system, both on the line and on the circle, we consider the setups given by two intervals, either adjacent or disjoint. We find analytic expressions for the moments of the partial transpose of the reduced density matrix and the logarithmic negativity. In the limit of small separation distance, this expression yields the same subleading topological contribution occurring in the mutual information. In the limit of large separation distance between the two intervals, the exponential decay of the logarithmic negativity is obtained from its analytic expression. The analytic formulas are checked against exact numerical results from a bosonic lattice model, finding a perfect agreement. We observe that, since the chiral current generates the neutral subalgebra of the full chiral Dirac fermion theory, this analysis highlights how symmetries produce nontrivial features in the entanglement structure that are analogue to those ones already observed in the mutual information for regions with nontrivial topology.

Title: Graph energy as a measure of community detectability in networks
Authors: Lucas Böttcher, Mason A. Porter, Santo Fortunato
Abstract: A key challenge in network science is the detection of communities, which are sets of nodes in a network that are densely connected internally but sparsely connected to the rest of the network. A fundamental result in community detection is the existence of a nontrivial threshold for community detectability on sparse graphs that are generated by the planted partition model (PPM). Below this so-called ``detectability limit'', no community-detection method can perform better than random chance. Spectral methods for community detection fail before this detectability limit because the eigenvalues corresponding to the eigenvectors that are relevant for community detection can be absorbed by the bulk of the spectrum. One can bypass the detectability problem by using special matrices, like the non-backtracking matrix, but this requires one to consider higher-dimensional matrices. In this paper, we show that the difference in graph energy between a PPM and an Erdős--Rényi (ER) network has a distinct transition at the detectability threshold even for the adjacency matrices of the underlying networks. The graph energy is based on the full spectrum of an adjacency matrix, so our result suggests that standard graph matrices still allow one to separate the parameter regions with detectable and undetectable communities.

Abstract: The quantum-field-theoretic description for the U(1)-Goldstone boson of a scalar Bose-Einstein condensate with time-dependent contact interactions is developed beyond the acoustic approximation in accordance with Bogoliubov theory. The resulting effective action is mapped to a relativistic quantum field theory on a dispersive (or rainbow) cosmological spacetime which has a superluminal Corley-Jacobson dispersion relation. Time-dependent changes of the s-wave scattering length to quantum-simulate cosmological particle production are accompanied by a time-dependent healing length that can be interpreted as an analog Planck length in the comoving frame. Non-adiabatic transitions acquire a dispersive character, which is thoroughly discussed. The framework is applied to exponentially expanding or power-law contracting $(2+1)$-dimensional spacetimes which are known to produce scale-invariant cosmological power spectra. The sensitivity of these scenarios to the time-dependence of the Bogoliubov dispersion is investigated: We find a violation of scale-invariance via analytically trackable Transplanckian damping effects if the cut-off scale is not well separated from the horizon-crossing scale. In case of the exponential expansion, these damping effects remarkably settle and converge to another scale-invariant plateau in the far ultraviolet regime where non-adiabatic transitions are suppressed by the high dispersion. The developed framework enables quantitative access to more drastic analog cosmological scenarios with improved predictability in the ultraviolet regime that ultimately may lead to the observation of a scale-invariant cosmological power spectrum in the laboratory.

Title: Quantum Elastic Network Models and their Application to Graphene
Authors: Ioannis Kolotouros, Adithya Sireesh, Stuart Ferguson, Sean Thrasher, Petros Wallden, Julien Michel
Abstract: Molecular dynamics simulations are a central computational methodology in materials design for relating atomic composition to mechanical properties. However, simulating materials with atomic-level resolution on a macroscopic scale is infeasible on current classical hardware, even when using the simplest elastic network models (ENMs) that represent molecular vibrations as a network of coupled oscillators. To address this issue, we introduce Quantum Elastic Network Models (QENMs) and utilize the quantum algorithm of Babbush et al. (PRX, 2023), which offers an exponential advantage when simulating systems of coupled oscillators under some specific conditions and assumptions. Here, we demonstrate how our method enables the efficient simulation of planar materials. As an example, we apply our algorithm to the task of simulating a 2D graphene sheet. We analyze the exact complexity for initial-state preparation, Hamiltonian simulation, and measurement of this material, and provide two real-world applications: heat transfer and the out-of-plane rippling effect. We estimate that an atomistic simulation of a graphene sheet on the centimeter scale, classically requiring hundreds of petabytes of memory and prohibitive runtimes, could be encoded and simulated with as few as $\sim 160$ logical qubits.

Title: Cell size control in bacteria is modulated through extrinsic noise, single-cell- and population-growth
Authors: Arthur Genthon, Philipp Thomas
Abstract: Living cells maintain size homeostasis by actively compensating for size fluctuations. Here, we present two stochastic maps that unify phenomenological models by integrating fluctuating single-cell growth rates and size-dependent noise mechanisms with cell size control. One map is applicable to mother machine lineages and the other to lineage trees of exponentially-growing cell populations, which reveals that population dynamics alter size control measured in mother machine experiments. For example, an adder can become more sizer-like or more timer-like at the population level depending on the noise statistics. Our analysis of bacterial data identifies extrinsic noise as the dominant mechanism of size variability, characterized by a quadratic conditional variance-mean relationship for division size across growth conditions. This finding contradicts the reported independence of added size relative to birth size but is consistent with the adder property in terms of the independence of the mean added size. Finally, we derive a trade-off between population-growth-rate gain and division-size noise. Correlations between size control quantifiers and single-cell growth rates inferred from data indicate that bacteria prioritize a narrow division-size distribution over growth rate maximisation.

Title: Robust Reasoning as a Symmetry-Protected Topological Phase
Authors: Ilmo Sung
Abstract: Large language models suffer from "hallucinations"-logical inconsistencies induced by semantic noise. We propose that current architectures operate in a "Metric Phase," where causal order is vulnerable to spontaneous symmetry breaking. Here, we identify robust inference as an effective Symmetry-Protected Topological phase, where logical operations are formally isomorphic to non-Abelian anyon braiding, replacing fragile geometric interpolation with robust topological invariants. Empirically, we demonstrate a sharp topological phase transition: while Transformers and RNNs exhibit gapless decay, our Holonomic Network reveals a macroscopic "mass gap," maintaining invariant fidelity below a critical noise threshold. Furthermore, in a variable-binding task on $S_{10}$ ($3.6 \times 10^6$ states) representing symbolic manipulation, we demonstrate holonomic generalization: the topological model maintains perfect fidelity extrapolating $100\times$ beyond training ($L=50 \to 5000$), consistent with a theoretically indefinite causal horizon, whereas Transformers lose logical coherence. Ablation studies indicate this protection emerges strictly from non-Abelian gauge symmetry. This provides strong evidence for a new universality class for logical reasoning, linking causal stability to the topology of the semantic manifold.

Title: Anisotropic Landau-Lifshitz Model in Discrete Space-Time
Authors: Žiga Krajnik, Enej Ilievski, Tomaž Prosen, Vincent Pasquier
Abstract: We construct an integrable lattice model of classical interacting spins in discrete space-time, representing a discrete-time analogue of the lattice Landau-Lifshitz ferromagnet with uniaxial anisotropy. As an application we use this explicit discrete symplectic integration scheme to compute the spin Drude weight and diffusion constant as functions of anisotropy and chemical potential. We demonstrate qualitatively different behavior in the easy-axis and the easy-plane regimes in the non-magnetized sector. Upon approaching the isotropic point we also find an algebraic divergence of the diffusion constant, signaling a crossover to spin superdiffusion.

Title: Identification of graphite with perfect rhombohedral stacking by electronic Raman scattering
Authors: András Pálinkás, Krisztián Márity, Konrád Kandrai, Zoltán Tajkov, Martin Gmitra, Péter Vancsó, Levente Tapasztó, Péter Nemes-Incze
Abstract: Rhombohedral graphite (RG) shows strong correlations in its topological flat band and is pivotal for exploring emergent, correlated electronic phenomena. One key advantage is the enhancement of electronic interactions with the increase in the number of rhombohedrally stacked graphene layers. Increasing thickness also leads to an exponential increase in the number of stacking faults, necessitating a precise method to identify flawless rhombohedral stacking. Overcoming this challenge is difficult because the established technique for stacking sequence identification, based on the Raman 2D peak, fails in thick RG samples. We demonstrate that the strong layer dependence of the band structure can be harnessed to identify RG without stacking faults, or alternatively, to detect their presence. For thicknesses ranging from 3 to 12 layers, we show that each perfect RG structure presents distinctive peak positions in electronic Raman scattering (ERS). This measurement can be carried out using a conventional confocal Raman spectrometer at room temperature, using visible excitation wavelengths. Consequently, this overcomes the identification challenge by providing a simple and fast optical measurement technique, thereby helping to establish RG as a platform for studying strong correlations in one of the simplest crystals possible.

Title: Enhanced Long Wavelength Mermin-Wagner Fluctuations in Active Crystals and Glasses
Authors: Subhodeep Dey, Antik Bhattacharya, Smarajit Karmakar
Abstract: In two-dimensions (2D), the Mermin-Wagner-Hohenberg (MWH) fluctuation plays a significant role, giving rise to striking dimensionality effects marked by long-range density fluctuations leading to the singularities of various dynamical properties. According to the MWH theorem, a 2D equilibrium system with continuous degrees of freedom cannot achieve long-range crystalline order at non-zero temperatures. Recently, MWH fluctuations have been observed in glass-forming liquids, evidenced by the logarithmic divergence in the plateau value of mean squared displacement (MSD). Our research investigates long-wavelength fluctuations in crystalline and glassy systems influenced by non-equilibrium active noises. Active systems serve as a minimal model for understanding diverse non-equilibrium dynamics, such as those in biological systems and self-propelled colloids. We demonstrate that fluctuations from active forces can strongly couple with long-wavelength density fluctuations, altering the lower critical dimension ($d_l$) from $2$ to $3$ and leading to a novel logarithmic divergence of the MSD plateau with system size in 3D.

Title: Hidden order in dielectrics: string condensation, solitons, and the charge-vortex duality
Authors: Sergei Khlebnikov
Abstract: Description of electrons in a dielectric as solitons of the polarization field requires that the interaction between the solitons (prior to their coupling to electromagnetism) is short-ranged. We present an analytical study of the mechanism by which this is achieved. The mechanism is unusual in that it enables screening of electrically neutral soliton cores by polarization charges. We also argue that the structure of the solitons allows them to be quantized as either fermions or bosons. At the quantum level, the theory has, in addition to the solitonic electric, elementary magnetic excitations, which give rise to a topological contribution to the magnetic susceptibility.

Title: Unconventional superconductivity mediated by exciton density wave fluctuations
Authors: Ajesh Kumar, Adarsh S. Patri, T. Senthil
Abstract: Synthetic platforms afford an unparalleled degree of controllability in realizing strongly-correlated phases of matter. In this work, we study the possibility of electrically tunable exciton-mediated superconductivity arising in charge-imbalanced bilayer semiconductors. Focusing on the case of a bilayer semiconductor heterostructure, we identify the gating conditions required to achieve exciton density wave order within a self-consistent Hartree-Fock approximation. We analyze the role of the coupling of excitonic fluctuations to the fermionic charge carriers to find that the Goldstone mode of the density wave order can mediate attractive interactions leading to superconductivity. Furthermore, when the system is close to the density wave ordering, the interactions mediated by low-energy exciton modes can support an interlayer pair-density wave superconductor of anisotropic character. We discuss experimental signatures associated with these phenomena.

Title: Nonequilibrium fluctuation-response relations for state observables
Authors: Krzysztof Ptaszynski, Timur Aslyamov, Massimiliano Esposito
Abstract: Time-integrated state observables, which quantify the fraction of time spent by the system in a specific pool of states, are important in many fields, such as chemical sensing or the theory of fluorescence spectroscopy. We derive exact identities, called Fluctuation-Response Relations (FRRs), that connect the fluctuations of such observables to their response to external perturbations in nonequilibrium steady state of Markov jump processes. Using these results, we derive a first known upper bound on fluctuations of state observables, as well as some new lower bounds. We further demonstrate how our identities provide a deeper understanding of the mechanistic origin of fluctuations and reveal their properties dependent only on system topology, which may be relevant for model inference using measured data.

Title: Magnetization-Tunable Topological Phase Transitions in Ferromagnetic Kagome Monolayers of Co$_3$X$_3$Y$_2$ ($X=\mathrm{Sn},\mathrm{Pb}$; $Y=\mathrm{S},\mathrm{Se}$)
Authors: Ritwik Das, Arkamitra Sen, Indra Dasgupta
Abstract: The quantum anomalous Hall effect in magnetic kagome materials has emerged as a versatile platform for dissipationless electronic and spintronic devices. In this work, we demonstrate that the orientation of magnetic moments $\hat{m}(\theta,\phi)$ at lattice sites provides a practical tuning mechanism for engineering nontrivial topological phases in monolayer kagome ferromagnets. To elucidate the mechanism, we construct a symmetry-adapted minimal tight-binding model for kagome ferromagnets that includes intrinsic spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and the intrinsic Rashba SOC permitted by broken out-of-plane mirror symmetry between nearest-neighbor kagome sites and can capture the resulting topological phase diagram as a function of $\hat{m}(\theta,\phi)$. In particular, the restoration of in-plane mirror symmetry for specific values of $\phi$ drives a topological phase transition upon varying the in-plane orientation of the moments $\hat{m}(\theta = 90^{\circ}, \phi)$. In contrast, for fixed $\phi$, the transitions driven by varying $\theta$ originate from the competition between Rashba SOC and intrinsic SOC. Density functional theory calculations for ferromagnetic kagome monolayers belonging to the Co$_3$X$_3$Y$_2$ family ($X=\mathrm{Sn},\mathrm{Pb}$; $Y=\mathrm{S},\mathrm{Se}$) support the predictions of the proposed minimal tight-binding model. These findings provide design guidelines for tunable topological phases in kagome materials.

Title: Machine learning short-ranged many-body interactions in colloidal systems using descriptors based on Voronoi cells
Authors: Rinske M. Alkemade, Rastko Sknepnek, Frank Smallenburg, Laura Filion
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) strategies are opening the door to faster computer simulations, allowing us to simulate more realistic colloidal systems. Since the interactions in colloidal systems are often highly many-body, stemming from e.g. depletion and steric interactions, one of the challenges for these algorithms is capturing the many-body nature of these interactions. In this paper, we introduce a new ML-based strategy for fitting many-body interactions in colloidal systems where the many-body interaction is highly local. To this end, we develop Voronoi-based descriptors for capturing the local environment and fit the effective potential using a simple neural network. To test this algorithm, we consider a simple two-dimensional model for a colloid-polymer mixture, where the colloid-colloid interactions and colloid-polymer interactions are hard-disk like, while the polymers themselves interact as ideal gas particles. We find that a Voronoi-based description is sufficient to accurately capture the many-body nature of this system. Moreover, we find that the Pearson correlation function alone is insufficient to determine the predictive power of the network emphasizing the importance of additional metrics when assessing the quality of ML-based potentials.

Title: Dynamics of surface electrons in a topological insulator: cyclotron resonance at room temperature
Authors: I. Mohelsky, F. Le Mardele, J. Dzian, J. Wyzula, X. D. Sun, C. W. Cho, B. A. Piot, M. Shankar, R. Sankar, A. Ferguson, D. Santos-Cottin, P. Marsik, C. Bernhard, A. Akrap, M. Potemski, M. Orlita
Abstract: The ability to manipulate the surface states of topological insulators using electric or magnetic fields under ambient conditions is a key step toward their integration into future electronic and optoelectronic devices. Here, we demonstrate - using cyclotron resonance measurements on a tin-doped BiSbTe$_2$S topological insulator - that moderate magnetic fields can quantize massless surface electrons into Landau levels even at room temperature. This finding suggests that surface-state electrons can behave as long-lived quasiparticles at unexpectedly high temperatures.

Title: Strain-Induced Enhancement of Spin Pumping in Pt/YIG Bilayers
Authors: Lara M. Solis, Santiago J. Carreira, Javier Gómez, Alejandro Butera, María Abellán, Carlos García, Fernando Bonetto, Paolo Vavassori, Javier Briático, Laura B. Steren, Myriam H. Aguirre
Abstract: Enhancing spin-to-charge (S$\rightarrow$C) conversion efficiency remains a key challenge in spintronic materials research. In this work we investigate the effect of substrate-induced strains onto the S$\rightarrow$C efficiency. On one hand, we analyze strains-induced magnetic anisotropies in yttrium iron garnet (Y$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$, YIG) by comparing the magnetic and structural properties of YIG films grown on Gd$_3$Ga$_5$O$_{12}$ (GGG) and (CaGd)$_3$(MgZrGa)$_5$O$_{12}$ (SGGG) substrates. Differences in lattice mismatch - YIG//GGG ($\eta = -0.06 \%$) and YIG//SGGG ($\eta = -0.83 \%$) - lead to out-of-plane tensile strains in the first case and unexpected compressive strain in the latter. On the other hand, we study the spin injection efficiency on Pt/YIG bilayers evaluated by the Inverse Spin Hall Effect (ISHE). We find that the resulting perpendicular magnetic anisotropy in YIG//SGGG, while not dominant over shape anisotropy, correlates with enhanced ISHE signals as observed in Spin Pumping Ferromagnetic Resonance (SP-FMR) and Spin Seebeck effect (SSE) experiments. Strain engineering proves effective in enhancing spin-to-charge conversion, providing insight into the design of efficient spintronic devices.

Title: Creation and Microscopic Origins of Single-Photon Emitters in Transition Metal Dichalcogenides and Hexagonal Boron Nitride
Authors: Amedeo Carbone, Diane-Pernille Bendixen-Fernex de Mongex, Arkady V. Krasheninnikov, Martijn Wubs, Alexander Huck, Thomas W. Hansen, Alexander W. Holleitner, Nicolas Stenger, Christoph Kastl
Abstract: We highlight recent advances in the controlled creation of single-photon emitters in van der Waals materials and in the understanding of their atomistic origin. We focus on quantum emitters created in monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenide semiconductors, which provide spectrally sharp single-photon emission at cryogenic temperatures, and the ones in insulating hBN, which provide bright and stable single-photon emission up to room temperature. After introducing the different classes of quantum emitters in terms of band-structure properties, we review the defect creation methods based on electron and ion irradiation as well as local strain engineering and plasma treatments. A main focus of the review is put on discussing the microscopic origin of the quantum emitters as revealed by various experimental platforms, including optical and scanning probe methods.

Title: Finite Thickness Effects on Metallization Vs. Chiral Majorana Fermions
Authors: Xin Yue, Guo-Jian Qiao, C. P. Sun
Abstract: The search for chiral Majorana fermions in quantum anomalous Hall insulator/\textit{s}-wave superconductor heterostructures has attracted intense interest, yet remains controversial due to the lack of conclusive evidence. A key issue is that the heterostructure's metallization can produce half-integer conductance signatures resembling those of chiral Majorana fermions, thereby complicating their identification. In this Letter, we investigate how the competition between metallization and chiral Majorana fermions depends on superconductor thickness, revealing its critical role through three distinct regimes: (i) For thin superconductors ($\sim$10 nm), metallization shows periodic oscillations with thickness, matching the Fermi wavelength. (ii) Intermediate thicknesses ($\sim$100 nm) exhibit periodic windows for observing chiral Majorana fermions. (iii) Thick superconductors ($\sim$1000 nm) sustain stable chiral Majorana fermions that are insensitive to thickness variations. These results suggest that superconductor thickness is a key control parameter for advancing efforts to conclusively identify chiral Majorana fermions.

Title: Anomalous Energy Injection in the Gross-Pitaevskii Framework for Turbulence in Neutron Star Glitches
Authors: Anirudh Sivakumar, Pankaj Kumar Mishra, Ahmad A. Hujeirat, Paulsamy Muruganandam
Abstract: Neutron star glitches -- sudden increases in rotational frequency -- are thought to result from angular momentum transfer via quantized vortices in the superfluid core. To investigate the underlying superfluid dynamics, we employ a two-dimensional rotating atomic Bose-Einstein condensate described by a damped Gross-Pitaevskii equation with an imposed pinning potential that serves as a simplified analogue of a crust. Within this minimal framework, we examine the emergence and evolution of turbulent vortex motion following impulsive perturbations reminiscent of glitch-like forcing. Our simulations reveal a transient Kolmogorov-like turbulent cascade ($k^{-5/3}$) that transitions to a Vinen-like scaling ($k^{-1}$). We identify an anomalous secondary injection mechanism driven primarily by quantum pressure, which can sustain turbulent fluctuations in such a system. By tuning the damping coefficient $\gamma$, we determine an optimal regime for energy transfer. While idealized, these findings illustrate how quantum turbulence with multiple scaling regimes can arise in pinned, rotating superfluids, and they suggest possible qualitative connections to vortex-mediated dynamics in neutron stars and other astrophysical superfluid systems.

Title: Characterizing the cage state of glassy systems and its sensitivity to frozen boundaries
Authors: Rinske M. Alkemade, Frank Smallenburg, Laura Filion
Abstract: Understanding the role that structure plays in the dynamical arrest observed in glassy systems remains an open challenge. Over the last decade, machine learning (ML) strategies have emerged as an important tool for probing this structure-dynamics relationship, particularly for predicting heterogeneous glassy dynamics from local structure. A recent advancement is the introduction of the cage state, a structural quantity that captures the average positions of particles while rearrangements are forbidden. During the caging regime, linear models trained on the cage state have been shown to outperform more complex ML methods trained on initial configurations only. In this paper, we explore the properties associated with the cage state in more detail to better understand why it serves as such an effective predictor for the dynamics. Specifically, we examine how the cage state in a binary hard-sphere mixture is influenced by both packing fraction and boundary conditions. Our results reveal that, as the system approaches the glassy regime, the cage state becomes increasingly influenced by long-range structural effects. This influence is evident both in its predictive power for particle dynamics and in the internal structure of the cage state, suggesting that the CS might be associated with some form of an amorphous growing structural length scale.

Title: Fast hydrogen atom diffraction through monocrystalline graphene
Authors: Pierre Guichard, Arnaud Dochain, Raphaël Marion, Pauline de Crombrugghe de Picquendaele, Nicolas Lejeune, Benoît Hackens, Paul-Antoine Hervieux, Xavier Urbain
Abstract: We report fast atom diffraction through single-layer graphene using hydrogen atoms at kinetic energies from 150 to 1200 eV. High-resolution images reveal overlapping hexagonal patterns from coexisting monocrystalline domains. Time-of-flight tagging confirms negligible energy loss, making the method suitable for matter-wave interferometry. The diffraction is well described by the eikonal approximation, with accurate modeling requiring the full 3D interaction potential from DFT. Simpler models fail to reproduce the data, highlighting the exceptional sensitivity of diffraction patterns to atom-surface interactions and their potential for spectroscopic applications.

Title: Predictive models for strain energy in condensed phase reactions
Authors: Baptiste Martin, Shukai Yao, Chunyu Li, Anthony Bocahut, Matthew Jackson, Alejandro Strachan
Abstract: Molecular modeling of thermally activated chemistry in condensed phases is essential to understand polymerization, depolymerization, and other processing steps of molecular materials. Current methods typically combine molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to describe short-time relaxation with a stochastic description of predetermined chemical reactions. Possible reactions are often selected on the basis of geometric criteria, such as a capture distance between reactive atoms. Although these simulations have provided valuable insight, the approximations used to determine possible reactions often lead to significant molecular strain and unrealistic structures. We show that the local molecular environment surrounding the reactive site plays a crucial role in determining the resulting molecular strain energy and, in turn, the associated reaction rates. We develop a graph neural network capable of predicting the strain energy associated with a cyclization reaction from the pre-reaction, local, molecular environment surrounding the reactive site. The model is trained on a large dataset of condensed-phase reactions during the activation of polyacrylonitrile (PAN) obtained from MD simulations and can be used to adjust relative reaction rates in condensed systems and advance our understanding of thermally activated chemical processes in complex materials

Title: Landau-de Gennes Modelling of Confinement Effects and Cybotactic Clusters in Bent-Core Nematic Liquid Crystals
Authors: Yucen Han, Prabakaran Rajamanickam, Bedour Alturki, Apala Majumdar
Abstract: We study bent-core nematic (BCN) systems in two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) settings, focusing on the role of cybotactic clusters, phase transitions, confinement effects and applied external fields. We propose a generalised version of Madhusudana's two-state model for BCNs in [Madhusudhana NV, Physical Review E, 96(2), 022710] with two order parameters: $\mathbf{Q}_g$ to describe the ambient ground-state (GS) molecules and $\mathbf{Q}_c$ to describe the additional ordering induced by the cybotactic clusters. The equilibria are modelled by minimisers of an appropriately defined free energy, with an empirical coupling term between $\mathbf{Q}_g$ and $\mathbf{Q}_c$. We demonstrate two phase transitions in spatially homogeneous 3D BCN systems at fixed temperatures: a first-order nematic-paranematic transition followed by a paranematic-isotropic phase transition driven by the GS-cluster coupling. We also numerically compute and give heuristic insights into solution landscapes of confined BCN systems on 2D square domains, tailored by the GS-cluster coupling, temperature and external fields. This benchmark example illustrates the potential of this generalised model to capture tunable director profiles, cluster properties and potential biaxiality induced by antagonistic $\mathbf{Q}_g$ and $\mathbf{Q}_c$-profiles.

Title: Cheaper access to universal fluctuations in integrable spin chains from boundary effects
Authors: Sylvain Prolhac
Abstract: Observing super-diffusive fluctuations from Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality in isotropic integrable spin chains is usually challenging as it requires a fairly large number of spins in interaction. We demonstrate in this paper, in the context of classical spins, that accounting for boundary effects lowers the bar, down to a few dozen spins in some cases. Additionally, boundaries control the relaxation to stationarity, which leads to many new universal scaling functions to explore, both in periodic spin chains and for open chains with magnetization imposed by reservoirs at the ends.

Title: Li+/H+ exchange in solid-state oxide Li-ion conductors
Authors: Zhuohan Li, Benjamin X. Lam, Shilong Wang, Gerbrand Ceder
Abstract: Understanding the moisture stability of oxide Li-ion conductors is important for their practical applications in solid-state batteries. Unlike sulfide or halide conductors, oxide conductors generally better resist degradation when in contact with water, but can still undergo topotactic \ch{Li+}/\ch{H+} exchange (LHX). Here, we combine density functional theory (DFT) calculations with a machine-learning interatomic potential model to investigate the thermodynamic driving force of the LHX reaction for two representative oxide Li-ion conductor families: garnets and NASICONs. Li-stuffed garnets exhibit a strong driving force for proton exchange due to their high Li chemical potential. In contrast, NASICONs demonstrate a higher resistance against proton exchange due to the lower Li chemical potential and the lower O-H bond covalency for polyanion-bonded oxygens. Our findings reveal a critical trade-off: Li stuffing enhances conductivity but increases moisture susceptibility. This study underscores the importance of designing Li-ion conductors that possess both high conductivity and high stability in practical environments.

Title: Defect configuration of an active nematic around a circular obstacle
Authors: Hiroki Matsukiyo, Jun-ichi Fukuda
Abstract: To enhance the understanding of the behavior of active nematic, it is important to understand the behavior of topological defects. In this paper, we study the configuration of topological defects of a two-dimensional active nematic around a circular obstacle. In the case of a passive nematic liquid crystal, the equilibrium configuration of defects can be easily identified by the method of image charges. In the case of an active nematic, however, one must take account of the flow field generated by active constituents, and the problem of identifying the defect configuration becomes complicated. We first perform numerical simulations and investigate how the stationary defect configuration deviates from the passive case. Furthermore, we carry out a theoretical calculation based on an analytical expression relating the defect velocity with the force exerted on the defect. Our theoretical calculation qualitatively reproduces the simulation results. Our study may be applied to describing the behaviour of e.g. cell populations in the presence of obstacles, and has the potential to benefit related fields, e.g., developmental biology.

Title: Thickness dependent rare earth segregation in magnetron deposited NdCo$_{4.6}$ thin films studied by Xray reflectivity and Hard Xray photoemission
Authors: J. Díaz, J. Rodríguez-Fernández, J. Rubio-Zuazo
Abstract: Magnetic anisotropy in disordered rare-earth-transition metals (RE-TM) compounds arises from RE atoms occupying asymmetric environments within the TM lattice. However, the underlying mechanism that promotes such environments remains not fully understood. In this study, we investigate amorphous NdCo$_{4.6}$ thin films deposited by magnetron sputtering, where the magnetic anisotropy evolves with thickness from in-plane to out-of-plane orientation above 40 nm. X-ray reflectivity measurements revealed the progressive formation of an additional layer between the 3 nm Si capping layer and the NdCo film with increasing film thickness. To probe the composition and distribution of Co and Nd near the surface, Hard X-ray Photoemission Spectroscopy (HAXPES) was performed on films ranging from 5 nm to 65 nm in thickness using incident photon energies of 7, 19, and 13 keV. These correspond to inelastic electron mean free paths of 7.2-12.3 nm in cobalt. The cobalt atomic concentration, deduced from HAXPES at the Nd 3d and Co 2p excitations, was consistently below the nominal value and varied with both thickness and photon energy. This indicates segregation of RE atoms at the film surface, which becomes more pronounced with increasing thickness. Background analysis of the Co 2p and Nd 3d peaks supports this conclusion. The thickness of the Nd segregated layer is estimated in 2-3 nm. These findings demonstrate that incorporating neodymium into the cobalt lattice incurs an energy cost which is associated with strain due to the volume mismatch between the two elements. Reducing this strain energy promotes anisotropic atomic environments for Nd, thereby explaining the emergence of perpendicular anisotropy and its dependence on film thickness in these RE-TM compounds.

Title: Quantum Spin Liquids Stabilized by Disorder in Non-Kramers Pyrochlores
Authors: Marcus V. Marinho, Eric C. Andrade
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of quantum spin liquid phases in pyrochlore oxides with non-Kramers ions, in which structural randomness effectively acts as a transverse field, introducing quantum fluctuations on top of the spin ice manifold. This is contrary to the naive expectation that disorder favors phases with short-range entanglement by adjusting the spins with their local environment. We study a minimal model for a disordered quantum spin ice, the transverse-field Ising model, using a real-space formulation of the gauge mean-field theory. This approach allows the inclusion of non-perturbative disorder effects exactly, and thus to assess the stability of the spin-liquid phase with respect to the disorder. The analysis shows that the quantum spin ice remains remarkably stable with respect to disorder up to the transition to the polarized phase at high fields, indicating that it can occur in real materials. A Griffiths region of enhanced disorder-induced fluctuations is restricted to the immediate vicinity of this transition due to the peculiar nature of the low-energy excitations of the problem. For most of the phase diagram, an average description of the disorder captures the physical behavior well, indicating that the inhomogeneous quantum spin ice behaves closely to its homogeneous counterpart.

Title: Interaction-Induced Quasicrystalline Order: Emergence of Quasi-Solid and Quasi-Supersolid Phases
Authors: Chao Zhang
Abstract: Deterministic quasiperiodicity in quantum systems has long been associated with localization, criticality, or glassy behavior, and has therefore been believed to suppress long-range order rather than stabilize it. Here we demonstrate the opposite: quasiperiodicity in interactions--without any quasiperiodic potential, disorder, or geometric modulation--can generate coherent, ordered quantum phases. We study hard-core bosons in one dimension with quasiperiodic long-range interactions, V_{ij}=V_0 \cos(\pi \alpha i)\cos(\pi \alpha j), where n=\alpha=(\sqrt{5}-1)/2 is the inverse golden ratio. Using large-scale path-integral quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we uncover thermodynamically stable incompressible plateaus at irrational densities tied to Fibonacci ratios. These plateaus exhibit sharp incommensurate Bragg peaks, signaling an emergent quasi-solid with long-range quasicrystalline density order. More strikingly, at nearby fillings and interaction strengths, we identify a quasi-supersolid phase that supports both Fibonacci density ordering and finite superfluid density--demonstrating that interaction-induced quasiperiodicity can stabilize supersolid coherence. Our results establish a new mechanism for realizing ordered quasicrystalline quantum matter, and provide realistic guidance for implementation in Rydberg atom arrays, multimode cavity-QED systems, and trapped-ion quantum simulators.

Title: Fermionic spinon theory of the hourglass spin excitation spectrum of the cuprates
Authors: Alexander Nikolaenko, Pietro M. Bonetti, Subir Sachdev
Abstract: We present a theory for the spin fluctuation spectrum of the hole-doped cuprates in a ground state with period 4 unidirectional charge density wave (`stripe') order. Motivated by recent experimental evidence for a fractionalized Fermi liquid (FL*) description of the intermediate temperature pseudogap metal, we employ a theory of fermionic spinons which are confined with the onset of stripe order at low temperatures. The theory produces the `hourglass' spectrum near stripe-ordering wavevector observed by neutron scattering. Additional scattering from spinon continua and bound states appears at higher energies and elsewhere in the Brillouin zone, and could be observed by neutron or X-ray scattering.

Title: Mode-resolved logarithmic quasiballistic heat transport in thin silicon layers: Semianalytic and Boltzmann transport analysis
Authors: Jae Sik Jin
Abstract: Nonequilibrium phonon transport driven by nanoscale hotspot heating in silicon device layers governs heat dissipation in advanced microelectronics and underscores the need for a better microscopic understanding of such processes. Yet the origin of the frequently observed logarithmic (ln) dependence of the apparent thermal response on hotspot size in crystalline silicon, and the role of individual phonon modes in this regime, remain unclear. Here, we develop a semianalytical, mode-resolved framework in the spectral phonon mean free path (MFP) domain and validate it against a full-phonon-dispersion Boltzmann transport model for heat removal from a 10 x 10 nm^2 hotspot in a thin Si layer (thicknesses of 41, 78, and 177 nm) representative of a silicon-on-insulator transistor. We show that ln-type quasiballistic scaling arises only for modes that lie on a log-uniform conductivity plateau and are diffusive-side or quasiballistic with respect to the hotspot size, whereas fully ballistic long-MFP modes contribute a saturated, nonlogarithmic background, leading to extremely slow suppression of their heat-carrying capability. The resulting phonon-modal nonlocal spectrum establishes spectral selection rules for ln-regime transport in confined Si and provides a compact basis for incorporating mode-selective quasiballistic corrections into continuum thermal models and for interpreting phonon-resolved thermometry experiments.

Title: Local Reversibility and Divergent Markov Length in 1+1-D Directed Percolation
Authors: Yu-Hsueh Chen, Tarun Grover
Abstract: Recent progress in open many-body quantum systems has highlighted the importance of the Markov length, the characteristic scale over which conditional correlations decay. It has been proposed that non-equilibrium phases of matter can be defined as equivalence classes of states connected by short-time evolution while maintaining a finite Markov length, a notion called local reversibility. A natural question is whether well-known classical models of non-equilibrium criticality fit within this framework. Here we investigate the Domany-Kinzel model -- which exhibits an active phase and an absorbing phase separated by a 1+1-D directed-percolation transition -- from this information-theoretic perspective. Using tensor network simulations, we provide evidence for local reversibility within the active phase. Notably, the Markov length diverges upon approaching the critical point, unlike classical equilibrium transitions where Markov length is zero due to their Gibbs character. Correspondingly, the conditional mutual information exhibits scaling consistent with directed percolation universality. Further, we analytically study the case of 1+1-D compact directed percolation, where the Markov length diverges throughout the phase diagram due to spontaneous breaking of domain-wall parity symmetry from strong to weak. Nevertheless, the conditional mutual information continues to faithfully detect the corresponding phase transition.

Title: Magnetic field-bias current interplay in HgTe-based three-terminal Josephson junctions
Authors: J. Thieme, W. Himmler, F. Dominguez, G. Platero, N. Hüttner, S. Hartl, E. Richter, D. A. Kozlov, N. N. Mikhailov, S. A. Dvoretsky, D. Weiss
Abstract: We investigate HgTe/Nb-based three-terminal Josephson junctions in T-shaped and X-shaped geometries and their critical current contours (CCCs). By decomposing the CCCs into the contributions from individual junctions, we uncover how bias current and magnetic field jointly determine the collective Josephson behavior. A perpendicular magnetic field induces a tunable crossover between SQUID-like and Fraunhofer-like interference patterns, controlled by the applied bias. Moreover, magnetic flux produces pronounced deformations of the CCC, enabling symmetry control in the $(I_1,I_2)$ plane. Remarkably, we identify a regime of strongly enhanced Josephson diode efficiency, reaching values up to $\eta\approx 0.8$ at low bias and magnetic field. The experimental results are quantitatively reproduced by resistively shunted junction (RSJ) simulations, which capture the coupled dynamics of current and flux in these multi-terminal superconducting systems.

Title: Detection of a Rényi Index Dependent Transition in Entanglement Entropy Scaling
Authors: Hatem Barghathi, Adrian Del Maestro
Abstract: The scaling of entanglement with subsystem size encodes key information about phases and criticality, but the von Neumann entropy is costly to access in experiments and simulations, often requiring full state tomography. The second Rényi entropy is readily measured using two-copy protocols and is often used as a proxy for the von Neumann entanglement entropy, where it is assumed to track its asymptotic scaling. Sugino and Korepiny (Int. J. Mod. Phys. B 32, 1850306 (2018)) revealed that in the ground state of some highly constrained spin models, the scaling of the von Neumann and \ren entropies can differ, varying from power law to logarithmic scaling as a function of the \ren index. Here, we construct a number-conserving many-body state that demonstrates a Rényi-index-dependent change in the leading entanglement scaling, generalizing previous results to the case of interacting fermions. We introduce a symmetry-aware lower bound on the von Neumann entropy built from charge-resolved Rényi entropies that can provide a protocol for diagnosing anomalous entanglement scaling from experimentally accessible data.

Title: Strong anchoring boundary conditions in nematic liquid crystals: Higher-order corrections to the Oseen-Frank limit and a revised small-domain theory
Authors: Prabakaran Rajamanickam
Abstract: Strong anchoring boundary conditions are conventionally modelled by imposing Dirichlet conditions on the order parameter in Landau--de Gennes theory, neglecting the finite surface energy of realistic anchoring. This work revisits the strong anchoring limit for nematic liquid crystals in confined two-dimensional domains. By explicitly retaining a Rapini-Papoular surface energy and adopting a scaling where the extrapolation length $l_{ex}$ is comparable to the coherence length $\xi$, we analyse both the small-domain ($\epsilon = h/\xi\to 0$; $h$ is the domain size) and Oseen-Frank $(\epsilon \to \infty$) asymptotic regimes. In the small-domain limit, the leading-order equilibrium solution is given by the average of the boundary data, which can vanish in symmetrically frustrated geometries, leading to isotropic melting. In the large-domain limit, matched asymptotic expansions reveal that surface anchoring introduces an $O(1/\epsilon)$ correction to the director field near boundaries, in contrast to the $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ correction predicted by Dirichlet conditions. The analysis captures the detailed structure of interior and boundary defects, showing that mixed (Robin-type) boundary conditions yield smoother defect cores and more physical predictions than rigid Dirichlet conditions. Numerical solutions for square and circular wells with tangential anchoring illustrate the differences between the two boundary condition treatments, particularly in defect morphology. The results demonstrate that a consistent treatment of anchoring energetics is essential for accurate modelling of nematic equilibria in micro- and nano-scale confined geometries.

Title: Detection of MEMS Acoustics via Scanning Tunneling Microscopy
Authors: R. J. G. Elbertse, M. Xu, A. Keşkekler, S. Otte, R. A. Norte
Abstract: Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) have traditionally addressed vastly different length scales - one resolving atoms, the other engineering macroscopic motion. Here we unite these two fields to perform minimally invasive-measurements of high aspect-ratio MEMS resonators using the STM tip as both actuator and detector. Operating at cryogenic temperatures, we resolve acoustic modes of millimeter-scale, high-Q membranes with picometer spatial precision, without making use of lasers or capacitive coupling. The tunneling junction introduces negligible back-action or heating, enabling direct access to the intrinsic dynamics of microgram-mass oscillators. In this work we explore three different measurement modalities, each offering unique advantages. Combined, they provide a pathway to quantum-level readout and exquisite high-precision measurements of forces, displacements, and pressures at cryogenic conditions. This technique provides a general platform for minimally-perturbative detection across a wide range of nanomechanical and quantum devices.

Title: Hybrid Disclination Skin-topological Effects in Non-Hermitian Circuits
Authors: Boyuan Li, Zekun Huang, Wenao Wang, Jiaxi Wang, Yu Chen, Shaojie Ma, Ce Shang, Tie Jun Cui, Shuo Liu
Abstract: The bulk-disclination correspondence (BDC) is a fundamental concept in Hermitian systems that has been widely applied to predict disclination states. Recently, disclination states have also been observed and experimentally verified in non-Hermitian systems with C6 lattice symmetry, where gain and loss are introduced to induce non-Hermiticity. In this Letter, we propose a non-Hermitian two-dimensional (2D) Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) disclination model with skin-topological (ST) disclination states, and calculate its biorthogonal Zak phase. Together with the real-space disclination index, we predict the emergence of disclination states in a C4-symmetric non-Hermitian lattice and the corresponding fractional charge. We also generalize the symmetry indicator within the biorthogonal framework to predict the anomalous filling near the disclination core. Experimentally, the model is implemented on a nonreciprocal circuit platform, where we analyze the impedance matrix characterized by complex eigenfrequencies and directly observe the ST disclination states. Our work further extends the bulk-disclination correspondence to the non-Hermitian realm.

Title: The Fate of Entanglement
Authors: Gilles Parez, William Witczak-Krempa
Abstract: Quantum entanglement manifests itself in non-local correlations between the constituents of a system. In its simplest realization, a measurement on one subsystem is affected by a prior measurement on its partner, irrespective of their separation. For multiple parties, purely collective types of entanglement exist but their detection, even theoretically, remains an outstanding open question. Here, we argue that all forms of multipartite entanglement entirely disappear during the typical evolution of a physical state as it heats up, evolves in time in a large family of dynamical protocols, or as its parts become separated. We focus on the generic case where the system interacts with an environment. These results mainly follow from the geometry of the entanglement-free continent in the space of physical states, and hold in great generality. We illustrate these phenomena with a frustrated molecular quantum magnet in and out of equilibrium, and a quantum spin chain. In contrast, if the particles are fermions, such as electrons, another notion of entanglement exists that protects bipartite quantum correlations. However, genuinely collective fermionic entanglement disappears during typical evolution, thus sharing the same fate as in bosonic systems. These findings provide fundamental knowledge about the structure of entanglement in quantum matter and architectures, paving the way for its manipulation.

Title: A Versatile Three Dimensional Traction Force Microscopy Framework for Uncovering the Mechanics of Bio-Adhesion
Authors: Yingwei Hou, Fusheng Wang, Tao Liu
Abstract: This study presents a novel, versatile traction force microscopy framework for quantifying three-dimensional (3D) interfacial forces during bio-adhesion by integrating in situ stereo digital image correlation with finite element (FE) simulation. The method enables accurate measurement of microscale displacements and force distributions at the interfaces in both dry and wet environments, addressing limitations of conventional microscopy techniques related to limited measurement scales, restricted fields of view, and surface disturbance from contact or fluorescence. An analytical model was developed to guide the design of a deformable substrate, supporting selection of substrate material and thickness of the substrate. System accuracy was examined through steel ball compression experiments, which were validated against FE simulations. The framework was applied to marine mussel plaque adhesion under 15 directional tension to characterize interfacial traction force distributions. Sensitivity analyses examined the effects of Poisson's ratio, Young's modulus, and constitutive models on the results. This approach offers a versatile platform for investigating interfacial mechanics in adhesives, with broad relevance to bioengineering applications.

Title: Optical vortex generation by magnons with spin-orbit-coupled light
Authors: Ryusuke Hisatomi, Alto Osada, Kotaro Taga, Haruka Komiyama, Takuya Takahashi, Shutaro Karube, Yoichi Shiota, Teruo Ono
Abstract: Light possesses both spin and orbital angular momentum. In spatially asymmetric optical fields, these properties undergo spontaneous coupling, referred to as optical spin-orbit coupling. The study of the coupling has recently become central in modern optics due to its substantial applications in communications, sensing, and quantum control. A key challenge is to clarify the relationship between the origins of spatially asymmetric optical fields and the resulting spin-orbit coupling. Current research focuses on materials and configurations exhibiting spatial asymmetry, such as focusing lenses, interfaces, inhomogeneous media, and metasurfaces. However, Maxwell's equations indicate that matter can introduce both spatial and temporal asymmetry into optical fields. For instance, magnetic ordering breaks the time-reversal symmetry of interacting optical fields via the magneto-optical effect, introducing nonreciprocity in the resulting optical phenomena. Despite the importance, optical phenomena involving both spatially and temporally asymmetric optical fields remain unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that breaking time and spatial symmetries through magnons and light focusing, respectively, transforms an input Gaussian beam into a specific optical vortex beam in a nonreciprocal manner. This phenomenon is quantitatively explained by integrating the physics of magnon-induced Brillouin light scattering with optical spin-orbit coupling. The observed conservation of total angular momentum, encompassing both magnons and photons, further indicates that magnons can control both spin and orbital angular momentum of light. Finally, we outline future research directions enabled by asymmetric optical fields in both space and time.

Title: Temporal coherence of single photons emitted by hexagonal Boron Nitride defects at room temperature
Authors: J.-V. Vidal Martínez-Pons, S.-K. Kim, M. Behrens, A. Izquierdo-Molina, A. Menendez Rua, S. Paçal, S. Ateş, L. Viña, C. Antón-Solanas
Abstract: Color centers in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) emerge as promising quantum light sources at room temperature, with potential applications in quantum communications, among others. The temporal coherence of emitted photons (i.e. their capacity to interfere and distribute photonic entanglement) is essential for many of these applications. Hence, it is crucial to study and determine the temporal coherence of this emission under different experimental conditions. In this work, we report the coherence time of the single photons emitted by an hBN defect in a nanocrystal at room temperature, measured via Michelson interferometry. The visibility of this interference vanishes when the temporal delay between the interferometer arms is a few hundred femtoseconds, highlighting that the phonon dephasing processes are four orders of magnitude faster than the spontaneous decay time of the emitter. We also analyze the single photon characteristics of the emission via correlation measurements, defect blinking dynamics, and its Debye-Waller factor. Our room temperature results highlight the presence of a strong phonon-electron coupling, suggesting the need to work at cryogenic temperatures to enable quantum photonic applications based on photon interference.

Title: Redundancy Channels in the Conformal Bootstrap
Authors: Stefanos R. Kousvos, Andreas Stergiou
Abstract: A method for obstructing symmetry enhancement in numerical conformal bootstrap calculations is proposed. Symmetry enhancement refers to situations where bootstrap studies initialised with a certain symmetry end up allowing theories with higher symmetry. In such cases, it is shown that redundant operators in the less symmetric theory can descend from primary scaling operators of the more symmetric one, motivating the imposition of spectral gaps that are justified in the former but not the latter. The same mechanism can also be used to differentiate between decoupled and fully coupled theories which otherwise have the same global symmetry. A systematic understanding of this mechanism is developed and applied to distinguish the cubic from the $O(3)$ model in three dimensions, where a strip of disallowed parameter space, referred to as the cubic redundancy channel, emerges once a gap associated with a redundant operator of the cubic theory is imposed. The channel corresponds precisely to the region of parameter space where the assumed cubic symmetry would be enhanced to $O(3)$.

Title: A universal machine learning model for the electronic density of states
Authors: Wei Bin How, Pol Febrer, Sanggyu Chong, Arslan Mazitov, Filippo Bigi, Matthias Kellner, Sergey Pozdnyakov, Michele Ceriotti
Abstract: In the last few years several ``universal'' interatomic potentials have appeared, using machine-learning approaches to predict energy and forces of atomic configurations with arbitrary composition and structure, with an accuracy often comparable with that of the electronic-structure calculations they are trained on. Here we demonstrate that these generally-applicable models can also be built to predict explicitly the electronic structure of materials and molecules. We focus on the electronic density of states (DOS), and develop PET-MAD-DOS, a rotationally unconstrained transformer model built on the Point Edge Transformer (PET) architecture, and trained on the Massive Atomistic Diversity (MAD) dataset. We demonstrate our model's predictive abilities on samples from diverse external datasets, showing also that the DOS can be further manipulated to obtain accurate band gap predictions. A fast evaluation of the DOS is especially useful in combination with molecular simulations probing matter in finite-temperature thermodynamic conditions. To assess the accuracy of PET-MAD-DOS in this context, we evaluate the ensemble-averaged DOS and the electronic heat capacity of three technologically relevant systems: lithium thiophosphate (LPS), gallium arsenide (GaAs), and a high entropy alloy (HEA). By comparing with bespoke models, trained exclusively on system-specific datasets, we show that our universal model achieves semi-quantitative agreement for all these tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that fine-tuning can be performed using a small fraction of the bespoke data, yielding models that are comparable to, and sometimes better than, fully-trained bespoke models.

Title: Electronically-controlled one- and two-qubit gates for transmon quasicharge qubits
Authors: Nicholas M. Christopher, Deniz E. Stiegemann, Abhijeet Alase, Thomas M. Stace
Abstract: Superconducting protected qubits aim to achieve sufficiently low error rates so as to allow realization of error-corrected, utility-scale quantum computers. A recent proposal encodes a protected qubit in the quasicharge degree of freedom of the conventional transmon device. Operating such a protected `quasicharge qubit' requires implementing new strategies. Here we show that an electronically-controllable tunnel junction formed by two topological superconductors can be used to implement single- and two-qubit gates on quasicharge qubits. Schemes for both these gates are based on the same dynamical $4\pi$-periodic Josephson effect and therefore have the same gate times and error characteristics. We simulate the dynamics of a topological Josephson junction in a parameter regime with non-negligible charging energy, and characterize the robustness of such gate operations against charge noise. Our results point to a compelling strategy for implementation of quasicharge qubit gates based on junctions of minimal Kitaev chains of quantum dots.

Title: The Thermodynamics of the Gravity from Entropy Theory
Authors: Ginestra Bianconi
Abstract: The Gravity from Entropy (GfE) action posits that the fundamental nature of gravity is information encoded in the metric degrees of freedom. This statistical mechanics theory is associated with the GfE Lagrangian given by the Geometric Quantum Relative Entropy (GQRE) between the true metric and the metric induced by the matter fields and the curvature. The GfE action leads to the GfE modified gravity equations displaying an emergent dynamical cosmological constant. Interestingly, the GfE equations of motion reduce to the Einstein equations in the limit of low energy and small curvature. Here we embrace a thermodynamic point of view and we associate the energy density of the GfE to the emergent dynamical cosmological constant of the theory. Focusing on homogeneous and isotropic spacetimes, we reveal that the GfE universes associated with the FRW metrics are thermal. Indeed they are associated with the $k$-temperatures and the $k$-pressures which are related to their local GQRE and their local energy by the first law of GfE thermodynamics. The thermodynamics of the GfE theory is illustrated in the low energy, small curvature limit with matter content modelled as perfect fluid, where the solutions of the GfE equations of motion are well approximated by the Friedmann universes. We show that while the total GQRE per unit volume is not increasing, coherently with its relative entropy nature, the total entropy of GfE universes is not decreasing in time. These results provide a natural thermodynamic interpretation of GfE cosmologies and a framework for reconciling local complexity with the global increase in entropy of the universe.

Title: Scalable Quantum Computational Science: A Perspective from Block-Encodings and Polynomial Transformations
Authors: Kevin J. Joven, Elin Ranjan Das, Joel Bierman, Aishwarya Majumdar, Masoud Hakimi Heris, Yuan Liu
Abstract: Significant developments made in quantum hardware and error correction recently have been driving quantum computing towards practical utility. However, gaps remain between abstract quantum algorithmic development and practical applications in computational sciences. In this Perspective article, we propose several properties that scalable quantum computational science methods should possess. We further discuss how block-encodings and polynomial transformations can potentially serve as a unified framework with the desired properties. Recent advancements on these topics are presented including construction and assembly of block-encodings, and various generalizations of quantum signal processing (QSP) algorithms to perform polynomial transformations. The scalability of QSP methods on parallel and distributed quantum architectures is also highlighted. Promising applications in simulation and observable estimation in chemistry, physics, and optimization problems are presented. We hope this Perspective serves as a gentle introduction of state-of-the-art quantum algorithms to the computational science community, and inspires future development on scalable quantum computational science methodologies that bridge theory and practice.

Title: Scaling limits of complex Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev models and holographic geometry
Authors: Elena Gubankova, Subir Sachdev, Grigory Tarnopolsky
Abstract: We compare different limits of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model of $N$ complex fermion with $p$-fermion interactions. First, we compute the fermion Green's function and free energy in the limit of large $N$ followed subsequently by the limit of large $p$. Next, we examine the `double-scaling' limit in which the large $N,p$ limits are taken at fixed $\lambda = p^2/N$. Earlier results on the latter limit are resummed for small $\lambda$, and shown to match our results for the first limit. We also describe the holographic match of our results to two-dimensional Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity with an additional $U(1)$ gauge field.

Abstract: We define a black hole state in a spin chain by studying thermal correlators in holography. Focusing on the Heisenberg model we investigate the thermal and complexity properties of the black hole state by evaluating its entanglement entropy, emptiness formation probability and Krylov complexity. The entanglement entropy grows logarithmically with effective central charge c=5.2. We find evidence for thermalization at infinite temperature.

Title: Massless graviton in de Sitter as second sound in two-fluid hydrodynamics
Authors: G.E. Volovik
Abstract: The concept of gravitons and their masses, clear in the case of Minkowski spacetime, remains ambiguous for de Sitter spacetime. Here, we used a two-fluid approach to de Sitter thermodynamics and found a collective mode that is analogous to second sound in the two-fluid dynamics of the de Sitter state. This mode is massless and propagates at the speed of light. This suggests that this second-sound analog is a massless graviton propagating in de Sitter spacetime. The type of graviton this mode represents requires further consideration.

Title: Spin-operator form factors of the critical Ising chain and their finite volume scaling limits
Authors: Yizhuang Liu
Abstract: In this work, we provide a self-contained derivation of the spin-operator matrix elements in the fermionic basis, for the critical Ising chain at a generic system length $N\in 2Z_{\ge 2}$. The approach relies on the near-Cauchy property of certain matrices formed by the Toeplitz symbol in the critical model, and leads to simpler product formulas for the dressing functions in terms of square root functions. These square root products allow fully dis-singularized integral representations. In the finite volume scaling limit, they further reduce to the Binet's second integral for the gamma function logarithm and its Hermite's generalization. As such, all the matrix elements in the scaling limit allow simple product formulas in terms of the gamma function at integer and half-integer arguments, and are rational numbers up to $\sqrt{2}$. They are exactly the spin-operator form factors of the Ising CFT in the fermionic basis, whose explicit forms are much less well known in comparison to the finite-volume form factors in the massive theory. We also fully determine the normalization factor of the spin-operator and show explicitly how the coefficient $G(\frac{1}{2})G(\frac{3}{2})$ appear through a ground state overlap.

Title: Simulating Non-Markovian Dynamics in Open Quantum Systems
Authors: Meng Xu, Vasilii Vadimov, J. T. Stockburger, J. Ankerhold
Abstract: Recent advances in quantum technologies and related experiments have created a need for highly accurate, versatile, and computationally efficient simulation techniques for the dynamics of open quantum systems. Long-lived correlation effects (non-Markovianity), system-environment hybridization, and the necessity for accuracy beyond the Born-Markov approximation form particular challenges. Approaches to meet these challenges have been introduced, originating from different fields, such as hierarchical equations of motion, Lindblad-pseudomode formulas, chain-mapping approaches, quantum Brownian motion master equations, stochastic unravelings, and refined quantum master equations. This diversity, while indicative of the field's relevance, has inadvertently led to a fragmentation that hinders cohesive advances and their effective cross-community application to current problems for complex systems. How are different approaches related to each other? What are their strengths and limitations? Here we give a systematic overview and concise discussion addressing these questions. We make use of a unified framework which very conveniently allows to link different schemes and, this way, may also catalyze further progress. In line with the state of the art, this framework is formulated not in a fully reduced space of the system but in an extended state space which in a minimal fashion includes effective reservoir modes. This in turn offers a comprehensive understanding of existing methods, elucidating their physical interpretations, interconnections, and applicability.
