Title: Nonlinear Spectroscopy as a Magnon Breakdown Diagnosis and its Efficient Simulation
Authors: David A. S. Kaib, Marius Möller, Roser Valenti
Abstract: Identifying quantum spin liquids, magnon breakdown, or fractionalized excitations in quantum magnets is an ongoing challenge due to the ambiguity of possible origins of excitation continua occurring in linear response probes. Recently, it was proposed that techniques measuring higher-order response, such as two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (2DCS), could resolve such ambiguities. Numerically simulating nonlinear response functions can, however, be computationally very demanding. We present an efficient Lanczos-based method to compute second-order susceptibilities $\chi^{2}\omega_t,\omega_\tau)$ directly in the frequency domain. Applying this to extended Kitaev models describing $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$, we find qualitatively different nonlinear responses between intermediate magnetic field strengths and the high-field regime. To put these results into context, we derive the general 2DCS response of partially-polarized magnets within the linear spin-wave approximation, establishing that $\chi^2(\omega_t,\omega_\tau)$ is restricted to a distinct universal form if the excitations are conventional magnons. Deviations from this form, as predicted in our (Lanczos-based) simulations for $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$, can hence serve in 2DCS experiments as direct criteria to determine whether an observed excitation continuum is of conventional two-magnon type or of different nature.

Title: Speedups in nonequilibrium thermal relaxation: Mpemba and related effects
Authors: Gianluca Teza, John Bechhoefer, Antonio Lasanta, Oren Raz, Marija Vucelja
Abstract: Most of our intuition about the behavior of physical systems is shaped by observations at or near thermal equilibrium. However, even a thermal quench can lead to states far from thermal equilibrium, where counterintuitive, anomalous effects can occur. A prime example of anomalous thermal relaxation is the Mpemba effect, in which a system prepared at a hot temperature cools down to the temperature of the cold environment faster than an identical system prepared at a warm temperature. Although reported for water more than 2000 years ago by Aristotle, the recent observations of analogous relaxation speedups in a variety of systems have motivated the search for general explanations. We review anomalous relaxation effects, which all share a nonmonotonic dependence of relaxation time versus initial ``distance" from the final state or from the phase transition. The final state can be an equilibrium or a nonequilibrium steady state. We first review the water experiments and classify the anomalous relaxation phenomena related to the Mpemba effect. We then provide a modern definition of the Mpemba effect, focusing on the theoretical frameworks of stochastic thermodynamics, kinetic theory, Markovian dynamics, and phase transitions. We discuss the recent experimental and numerical developments that followed these theoretical advances. These developments paved the way for the prediction and observation of novel phenomena, such as the inverse Mpemba effect. The review is self-contained and introduces anomalous relaxation phenomena in single- and many-body systems, both classical and quantum. We also discuss the broader relevance of the Mpemba effect, including its relation with phase transitions and its experimental implications. We end with perspectives that connect anomalous speedups to ideas for designing optimal heating/cooling protocols, heat engines, and efficient samplers.

Title: Circular-polarization-selective perfect reflection from chiral superconductors
Authors: Junyeong Ahn, Ashvin Vishwanath
Abstract: Integrating mirrors with magnetic components is crucial for constructing chiral optical cavities, which provide tunable platforms for time-reversal-asymmetric light-matter interactions. Here, we introduce single-crystal circular-polarization-selective mirrors based on chiral superconductors, which break time-reversal symmetry by themselves eliminating the need for additional components. We show that a circular-polarization-selective perfect reflection (CSPR) occurs for strong-coupling superconductors in the BCS-BEC crossover regime or beyond if the optical Hall conductivity is significant in the unit of conductivity quantum per unit layer, $e^2/ha_z$, where $a_z$ is the lattice constant along the surface normal. While the optical Hall conductivity in chiral superconductors is typically tiny, we classify three routes to obtain a large value. We demonstrate the significant optical Hall conductivity and the resulting CSPR with two examples: (1) superconductivity in doped quantum Hall insulators and (2) chiral pairing that preserves the Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces in the weak-pairing limit. We also discuss the application of our theory to the recently discovered chiral superconducting phase in rhombohedral graphene. Our theory reveals the potential of these classes of chiral superconductors as promising elements for building high-quality-factor terahertz chiral cavities.

Title: Resonance Raman Scattering and Anomalous Anti-Stokes Phenomena in CrSBr
Authors: Satyam Sahu, Charlotte Berrezueta-Palacios, Sabrina Juergensen, Kseniia Mosina, Zdeněk Sofer, Matěj Velický, Patryk Kusch, Otakar Frank
Abstract: CrSBr, a van der Waals material, stands out as an air-stable magnetic semiconductor with appealing intrinsic properties such as crystalline anisotropy, quasi-1D electronic characteristics, layer-dependent antiferromagnetism, and non-linear optical effects. In this study, we investigate the differences between the absorption and emission spectra, focusing on the origin of the emission peak near 1.7 eV observed in the photoluminescence spectrum of CrSBr. Our findings are corroborated by excitation-dependent Raman experiments. Additionally, we explore the anti-Stokes Raman spectra and observe an anomalously high anti-Stokes to Stokes intensity ratio of up to 0.8, which varies significantly with excitation laser power and crystallographic orientation relative to the polarization of the scattered light. This ratio is notably higher than that observed in graphene ($\approx$ 0.1) and MoS$_2$ ($\approx$ 0.4), highlighting the unique vibrational and electronic interactions in CrSBr. Lastly, we examine stimulated Raman scattering and calculate the Raman gain in CrSBr, which attains a value of 1 $\times$ 10$^{8}$ cm/GW, nearly four orders of magnitude higher than that of previously studied three-dimensional systems.

Title: Machine Learning-Driven Analytical Models for Threshold Displacement Energy Prediction in Materials
Authors: Rosty B. Martinez Duque, Arman Duha, Mario F. Borunda
Abstract: Understanding the behavior of materials under irradiation is crucial for the design and safety of nuclear reactors, spacecraft, and other radiation environments. The threshold displacement energy (Ed) is a critical parameter for understanding radiation damage in materials, yet its determination often relies on costly experiments or simulations. This work leverages the machine learning-based Sure Independence Screening and Sparsifying Operator (SISSO) method to derive accurate, analytical models for predicting Ed using fundamental material properties. The models outperform traditional approaches for monoatomic materials, capturing key trends with high accuracy. While predictions for polyatomic materials highlight challenges due to dataset complexity, they reveal opportunities for improvement with expanded data. This study identifies cohesive energy and melting temperature as key factors influencing Ed, offering a robust framework for efficient, data-driven predictions of radiation damage in diverse materials.

Title: Universal Superconductivity in FeTe and All-Iron-Based Ferromagnetic Superconductor Heterostructures
Authors: Hee Taek Yi, Xiong Yao, Deepti Jain, Ying-Ting Chan, An-Hsi Chen, Matthew Brahlek, Kim Kisslinger, Kai Du, Myung-Geun Han, Yimei Zhu, Weida Wu, Sang-Wook Cheong, Seongshik Oh
Abstract: Ferromagnetism (FM) and superconductivity (SC) are two of the most famous macroscopic quantum phenomena. However, nature normally does not allow SC and FM to coexist without significant degradation. Here, we introduce the first fully iron-based SC/FM heterostructures, composed of Fe(Te,Se) and Fe3GeTe2, and show that in this platform strong FM and high-temperature SC robustly coexist. We subsequently discover that chemical proximity effect from neighboring layers can universally drive the otherwise non-superconducting FeTe films into a SC state. This suggests that the ground state of FeTe is so close to the SC state that it could be driven in and out of the SC state with various other perturbations. Altogether, this shows that Fe-Te-based heterostructures provide a unique opportunity to manipulate magnetism, superconductivity and topological physics, paving the way toward new superconducting technologies.

Title: RKKY quadratic and biquadratic spin-spin interactions in twisted bilayer graphene
Authors: D. O. Oriekhov, T. T. Osterholt, R. A. Duine, V. P. Gusynin
Abstract: We study the competition between the RKKY quadratic and biquadratic spin-spin interactions of two magnetic impurities in twisted bilayer graphene away from the magic angle. We apply the Bistritzer-MacDonald model of two graphene layers twisted with respect to each other by a small angle. By reducing the model to the Dirac-type one with modified Fermi velocity, we derive expressions for the RKKY quadratic and biquadratic spin interactions using perturbation theory for the free energy. The biquadratic interaction is suppressed by a larger power of the interaction constant and decreases faster with a the distance between impurities comparing to the quadratic one. Nevertheless, due to the different period of oscillations with impurity separation distance, chemical potential, twist angle and temperature, it is possible to fine-tune the system to the regime of dominating biquadratic interaction. Such a regime might be characterized by non-conventional spin order parameters such as quadrupole order.

Title: Observation of quantum oscillations, linear magnetoresistance, and crystalline electric field effect in quasi-two-dimensional PrAgBi$_2$
Authors: Sudip Malick, Hanna Świątek, Michał J Winiarski, Tomasz Klimczuk
Abstract: We report the magnetic and magnetotransport properties with electronic band structure calculation of the Bi square net system PrAgBi$_2$. The magnetization and heat capacity data confirm the presence of a crystalline electric field (CEF) effect in PrAgBi$_2$. Analysis of the CEF effect using a multilevel energy scheme reveals that the ground state of PrAgBi$_2$ consists of five singlets and two doublets. The de Haas-van Alphen (dHvA) quantum oscillations data show a single frequency with a very small cyclotron effective mass of approximately 0.11 $m_e$. A nontrivial Berry phase is also observed from the quantum oscillations data. The magnetotransport data shows linear and unsaturated magnetoresistance, reaching up to 1060\% at 2 K and 9 T. Notably, there is a crossover from a weak-field quadratic dependence to a high-field linear dependence in the field-dependent magnetoresistance data. The crossover critical field $B^*$ follows the quadratic temperature dependence, indicating the existence of Dirac fermions. The band structure calculation shows several Dirac-like linear band dispersions near the Fermi level and a Dirac point close to the Fermi level, located at the Brillouin zone boundary. \textit{Ab inito} calculations allowed us to ascribe the observed dHvA oscillation frequency to a particular feature of the Fermi surface. Our study suggests layered PrAgBi$_2$ is a plausible candidate for hosting the CEF effect and Dirac fermion in the Bi square net.

Title: Creation, stabilization, and study at ambient pressure of pressure-induced superconductivity in Bi$_{0.5}$Sb$_{1.5}$Te$_3$

Abstract: In light of breakthroughs in superconductivity under high pressure, and considering that record critical temperatures (T$_c$s) across various systems have been achieved under high pressure, the primary challenge for higher Tc should no longer solely be to increase T$_c$ under extreme conditions but also to reduce, or ideally eliminate, the need for applied pressure in retaining pressure-induced or -enhanced superconductivity. The topological semiconductor Bi$_{0.5}$Sb$_{1.5}$Te$_3$ (BST) was chosen to demonstrate our approach to addressing this challenge and exploring its intriguing physics. Under pressures up to ~ 50 GPa, three superconducting phases (BST-I, -II, and -III) were observed. A superconducting phase in BST-I appears at ~ 4 GPa, without a structural transition, suggesting the possible topological nature of this phase. Using the pressure-quench protocol (PQP) recently developed by us, we successfully retained this pressure-induced phase at ambient pressure and revealed the bulk nature of the state. Significantly, this demonstrates recovery of a pressure-quenched sample from a diamond anvil cell at room temperature with the pressure-induced phase retained at ambient pressure. Other superconducting phases were retained in BST-II and -III at ambient pressure and subjected to thermal and temporal stability testing. Superconductivity was also found in BST with T$_c$ up to 10.2 K, the record for this compound series. While PQP maintains superconducting phases in BST at ambient pressure, both depressurization and PQP enhance its T$_c$, possibly due to microstructures formed during these processes, offering an added avenue to raise T$_c$. These findings are supported by our density-functional theory calculations.

Title: Suppression of ferromagnetism in rippled La$_{2/3}$Sr$_{1/3}$MnO$_3$ membrane with process-induced strain prepared by epitaxial lift-off technique
Authors: Kota Kanda, Ryuji Atsumi, Takamasa Usami, Takumi Yamazaki, Kohei Ueda, Takeshi Seki, Shigeki Miyasaka, Jobu Matsuno, Junichi Shiogai
Abstract: Transition metal oxides are a platform for exploring strain-engineered intriguing physical properties and developing spintronic or flexible electronic functionalities owing to strong coupling of spin, charge and lattice degrees of freedom. In this study, we exemplify the strain-engineered magnetism of La$_{2/3}$Sr$_{1/3}$MnO$_3$ in freestanding and rippled membrane forms without and with process-induced strain, respectively, prepared by epitaxial lift-off technique. We find that the deposition of Pt/Ti stressor suppresses the crack formation in the lift-off process and induces a ripple structure in the La$_{2/3}$Sr$_{1/3}$MnO$_3$ membrane. Laser micrograph and Raman spectroscopy show a ripple period of about 30 um and a height of a few um, where alternating convex and concave structures are subjected to tensile strain of 0.6% and compressive strain of 0.5%, respectively. While the freestanding La$_{2/3}$Sr$_{1/3}$MnO$_3$ membrane exhibits room-temperature ferromagnetism, the macroscopic magnetic transition temperature (TC) of the rippled membrane is reduced by as large as 27%. Temperature-variable Kerr microscopy observation in the rippled membrane reveals that the spatial variation of TC to be approximately 4% of the macroscopic TC, which coincides with the local strains at convex and concave structures. The large reduction of macroscopic TC in the rippled membrane may be ascribed to the lattice disorders due to strain gradient. Our demonstration of tuning ferromagnetism by the ripple structure validates the high potential of the process-induced strain in epitaxial lift-off technique and paves the way for strain-mediated emerging physical properties in various transition metal oxides.

Title: Adiabatic transverse thermoelectric conversion enhanced by heat current manipulation in artificially tilted multilayers
Authors: Fuyuki Ando, Takamasa Hirai, Hiroto Adachi, Ken-ichi Uchida
Abstract: We phenomenologically formulate and experimentally observe an adiabatic transverse thermoelectric conversion enhanced by a heat current re-orientation in artificially tilted multilayers (ATMLs). By alternately stacking two materials with different thermal conductivities and rotating its multilayered structure with respect to a longitudinal temperature gradient, off-diagonal components in the thermal conductivity tensor are induced. This off-diagonal thermal conduction (ODTC) generates a finite transverse temperature gradient and Seebeck-effect-induced thermopower in the adiabatic condition, which is superposed on the isothermal transverse thermopower driven by the off-diagonal Seebeck effect (ODSE). In this study, we calculate and observe the two-dimensional temperature distribution and the resultant transverse thermopower in ATMLs comprising thermoelectric Co$_{2}$MnGa Heusler alloys and Bi$_{2-a}$Sb$_{a}$Te$_{3}$ compounds. By changing the tilt angle from 0° to 90°, the transverse temperature gradient obviously appeared in the middle angles and the transverse thermopower increases up to -116.1 ${\mu}$V/K in Co$_{2}$MnGa/Bi$_{0.2}$Sb$_{1.8}$Te$_{3}$-based ATML at the tilt angle of 45° whereas the isothermal contribution is estimated to be -82.6 ${\mu}$V/K from the analytical calculation. This hybrid action derived from ODTC results in the significant variation of the maximum reduced efficiency for transverse thermoelectric conversion from 3.1% in the isothermal limit to 8.1% in the adiabatic limit.

Title: Pressure-induced structural and superconducting transitions in black arsenic
Authors: Y. Y. Wu, L. Mu, Y. L. Zhang, D. Z. Dai, K. Meng, S. Y. Huang, X. Zhang, S. C. Huang, J. Chen, H. G. Yan, S. Y. Li
Abstract: We report high-pressure Raman spectra and resistance measurements of black arsenic (b-As) up to 58 GPa, along with phonon density of states (DOS) and enthalpy calculations for four reported arsenic phases up to 50 GPa. It is found that metastable b-As transforms into gray arsenic (g-As) phase at a critical pressure of 1.51 GPa, followed by subsequent transitions to simple cubic arsenic (c-As) and incommensurate host-guest arsenic (hg-As) phases at 25.9 and 44.8 GPa, respectively. Superconductivity emerges above 25 GPa in the c-As phase, with the superconducting transition temperature ($T$$\rm_c$) remaining nearly a constant of 3 K. Upon further compression, $T$$\rm_c$ steeply increases to a higher value around 4.5 K in the incommensurate hg-As phase above 43 GPa. We use our results to update the structural and superconducting phase diagrams under pressure for the novel semiconductor, black arsenic.

Title: Complex entanglement entropy for complex conformal field theory
Authors: Haruki Shimizu, Kohei Kawabata
Abstract: Conformal field theory underlies critical ground states of quantum many-body systems. While conventional conformal field theory is associated with positive central charges, nonunitary conformal field theory with complex-valued central charges has recently been recognized as physically relevant. Here, we demonstrate that complex-valued entanglement entropy characterizes complex conformal field theory and critical phenomena of open quantum many-body systems. This is based on non-Hermitian reduced density matrices constructed from the combination of right and left ground states. Applying the density matrix renormalization group to non-Hermitian systems, we numerically calculate the complex entanglement entropy of the non-Hermitian five-state Potts model, thereby confirming the scaling behavior predicted by complex conformal field theory.

Title: Conductivity of high-mobility epitaxial GdN
Authors: Edward X. M. Trewick, B. J. Ruck, W. F. Holmes-Hewett, H. J. Trodahl
Abstract: We report electron transport studies of a (001) GdN film grown on the square net presented by the (001) surface of LaAlO3, motivated by recent advances in epitaxial thin-film growth of several lanthanide nitrides. The film we have grown for the purpose is characterised by in-situ RHEED and ex-situ XRD and XRR to show the best crystallinity and smoothest surfaces we have accomplished to date. It shows a clear ferromagnetic transition at $\sim70$ K with a saturation magnetisation within uncertainly of 7 $\mu$B/Gd$^{3+}$ ion, a remanence of 5 $\mu$B/Gd$^{3+}$ ion and a coercive field of $\sim$5 mT. It is doped by $\sim1$% nitrogen vacancies that introduce $\sim3\times10^{20}$ cm$^{-3}$ electrons into the conduction band. The resistivity shows transport in a conduction band doped to degeneracy by $\sim0.01$ electrons/formula unit with a residual resistance ratio of 2 and a Hall resistivity permitting easily-separated ordinary and anomalous Hall components. The mobility is an order of magnitude larger than we have found in earlier films.

Title: Magnetic field imaging with an optical microscope using a quantum diamond sensor add-on
Authors: Alex Shaji (1), David A. Broadway (1), Philipp Reineck (1), Kevin J. Rietwyk (1), Jean-Philippe Tetienne (1) ((1) School of Science, RMIT University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia)
Abstract: Widefield magnetic imaging using ensembles of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centres in diamond has emerged as a useful technique for studying the microscopic magnetic properties of materials. Thus far, this technique has mainly been implemented on custom-made optical microscopes. We have developed an add-on for a standard laboratory optical microscope that integrates the NV-diamond sensor and necessary light source, microwave antenna, and bias magnet, enabling NV-based magnetic imaging while retaining the typical optical measurements modes of the microscope. We demonstrate our retrofitted quantum diamond microscope by imaging a magnetic particle sample using brightfield, darkfield, and magnetic imaging modes. Furthermore, we employ an iso-magnetic field imaging technique to visualise the magnetic field of the sample within seconds, and finally demonstrate three-dimensional stray field imaging. Retrofitting existing microscopes exploits the stability and high quality of traditional optical microscope systems while reducing the cost and space requirements of establishing a standalone magnetic imaging system.

Title: Majorana flat bands and anomalous proximity effects in $p$-wave magnet--superconductor hybrid systems
Authors: Yutaro Nagae, Leo Katayama, Satoshi Ikegaya
Abstract: Flat-band Majorana bound states of nodal $p$-wave superconductors give rise to striking electromagnetic anomalies, reflecting their high degree of degeneracy at the Fermi level. However, experimental investigations of these states have been hindered by the scarcity of materials exhibiting intrinsic $p$-wave superconductivity. In this Letter, we show that Majorana flat bands can emerge in a hybrid system consisting of a conventional superconductor and a $p$-wave magnet, a recently proposed class of unconventional magnets that possess a unique composite symmetry known as the $[C_{2\perp}||\boldsymbol{t}]$ symmetry. The degeneracy of the flat-band Majorana bound states is protected by chiral symmetry from the BDI symmetry class, which originates from the $[C_{2\perp}||\boldsymbol{t}]$ symmetry of the $p$-wave magnet. Furthermore, we predict the robust appearance of a zero-bias conductance peak in a dirty normal-metal--superconductor junction containing a $p$-wave magnet, which serves as an unambiguous signature of anomalous proximity effects associated with the Majorana flat bands.

Title: Direct derivation of anisotropic atomic displacement parameters from molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated in thermoelectric materials
Authors: Yoyo Hinuma
Abstract: Atomic displacement parameters (ADPs) are crystallographic information that describe the statistical distribution of atoms around an atom site. Direct derivation of anisotropic ADPs by atom from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, where the (co)valences of atom positions are taken over recordings at different time steps in a single MD simulation, was demonstrated on three thermoelectric materials, Ag8SnSe6, Na2In2Sn4, and BaCu1.14In0.86P2. Unlike the very frequently used lattice dynamics approach, the MD approach can obtain ADPs in disordered crystals and at finite temperature, but not under conditions where atoms migrate in the crystal. ADPs from MD simulations would act as a tool complementing experimental efforts to understand the crystal structure including the distribution of atoms around atom sites.

Title: Valley Gapless Semiconductor: Models and Applications
Authors: Kok Wai Lee, Pei-Hao Fu, Jun-Feng Liu, Ching Hua Lee, Yee Sin Ang
Abstract: The emerging field of valleytronics harnesses the valley degree of freedom of electrons, akin to how electronic and spintronic devices utilize the charge and spin degrees of freedom of electrons respectively. The engineering of valleytronic devices typically relies on the coupling between valley and other degrees of freedom such as spin, giving rise to valley-spintronics where an external magnetic field manipulates the information stored in valleys. Here, the valley gapless semiconductor is proposed as a potential electrically controlled valleytronic platform because the valley degree of freedom is coupled to the carrier type, i.e., electrons and holes. The valley degree of freedom can be electrically controlled by tuning the carrier type via the device gate voltage. We demonstrate the proposal for realizing a valley gapless semiconductor in the honeycomb lattice with the Haldane and modified Haldane models. The system's valley-carrier coupling is further studied for its transport properties in an all-electrically controlled valley filter device setting. Our work highlights the significance of the valley gapless semiconductor for valleytronic devices.

Title: Enhanced Non-Ohmic Drain Resistance of 2DFETs at Cryogenic Temperature
Authors: Kwok-Ho Wong, Mansun Chan
Abstract: The contact issue for two-dimensional (2D) materials-based field-effect transistors (FETs) has drawn enormous attention in recent years. Although ohmic behavior is achieved at room temperature, the drain current of 2DFETs shifts from ohmic to non-ohmic behavior at cryogenic temperatures. In this work, we demonstrate that the shift is attributed to the asymmetric current reduction at the metal-semiconductor contact at low temperature. Under low drain bias, carriers tunnel from the source to the channel but diffuse to the drain side due to the channel-to-drain barrier, resulting in the current suppression. By studying the property of ohmic metal-semiconductor contact at different temperatures, we analyzed the mechanisms behind this phenomenon and the dependence on metal-to-semiconductor barrier height. The work opens the semiconductor physics of 2D material contact at cryogenic temperature and the importance of contact metal selection in the development of 2DFET at cryogenic temperature.

Title: Strain-induced proximity effect in topological insulator TaSe$_3$
Authors: R.M. Lukmanova, I.A. Cohn, V.E. Minakova, S.V. Zaitsev-Zotov
Abstract: The magnetoresistance of superconductor-topological insulator-superconductor structures, with indium as the superconductor and TaSe$_3$ as the topological insulator, shows stepwise resistance dependencies on an applied magnetic field. These resistance steps result from the suppression of superconductivity, induced by the proximity effect in both the bulk and surface states of the topological insulator. The position and amplitude of the steps, occurring at approximately 0.1 T, exhibit unusual dependence on the magnitude of uniaxial strain $\epsilon$. This behavior follows the expected transition sequence: semi-metal -- strong topological insulator -- trivial dielectric and proves the appearance of the surface states at $0.46\% \lesssim \epsilon \lesssim 1\%$.

Title: Silicon nitride resistance switching MIS cells doped with silicon atoms
Authors: A Mavropoulis, N Vasileiadis, C Bonafos, P Normand, V Ioannou-Sougleridis, G Ch Sirakoulis, P Dimitrakis
Abstract: Stoichiometric SiNx layers (x = [N]/[Si] = 1.33) are doped with Si atoms by ultra-low energy ion implantation (ULE-II) and subsequently annealed at different temperatures in inert ambient conditions. Detailed material and memory cells characterization is performed to investigate the effect of Si dopants on the switching properties and performance of the fabricated resistive memory cells. In this context extensive dc current-voltage and impedance spectroscopy measurements are carried out systematically and the role of doping in dielectric properties of the nitride films is enlightened. The dc and ac conduction mechanisms are investigated in a comprehensive way. Room temperature retention characteristics of resistive states are also presented.

Title: Role of Molecular Structure in Defining the Dynamical Landscape of Deep Eutectic Solvents at Nanoscale
Authors: T. Rinesh, H. Srinivasan, V.K. Sharma, V. García Sakai, S. Mitra
Abstract: The molecular dynamics of deep eutectic solvents (DESs) are complex, characterized by nanoscale spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for tailoring transport properties like diffusion, viscosity and ionic conductivity. Molecular diffusion in DESs stems from transient caging and translation jumps, necessitating an understanding of how molecular structure regulates these processes. This study explores the influence of alkyl chain length on the nanoscopic dynamics of alkylamide-lithium perchlorate based DESs using quasielastic neutron scattering (QENS) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. QENS results show that, despite its shorter chain length and lighter mass, acetamide (ACM) exhibited the lowest mobility among the alkylamides, including propanamide (PRM) and butyramide (BUT). Detailed analysis of QENS data reveals that long-range jump diffusion is fastest in ACM and slowest in BUT, essentially due to their differences in molecular size, mass and also enhanced complexation in longer alkyl chain molecules. However, the localized dynamics follows an unusual trend, where PRM is the fastest and ACM is the slowest. Despite greater flexibility in BUT, the slower caged dynamics impedes its localized motion. These findings highlight the interplay between alkyl chain length and DES dynamics, emphasizing role of molecular structure in governing transport properties.

Title: High-pressure modulation of breathing kagome lattice: Cascade of Lifshitz transitions and evolution of the electronic structure
Authors: Marcos V. Gonçalves-Faria, Maxim Wenzel, Yuk Tai Chan, Olga Iakutkina, Francesco Capitani, Davide Comboni, Michael Hanfland, Qi Wang, Hechang Lei, Martin Dressel, Alexander A. Tsirlin, Alexej Pashkin, Stephan Winnerl, Manfred Helm, Ece Uykur
Abstract: The interplay between electronic correlations, density wave orders, and magnetism gives rise to several fascinating phenomena. In recent years, kagome metals have emerged as an excellent platform for investigating these unique properties, which stem from their itinerant carriers arranged in a kagome lattice. Here, we show that electronic structure of the prototypical kagome metal, Fe$_3$Sn$_2$, can be tailored by manipulating the breathing distortion of its kagome lattice with external pressure. The breathing distortion is suppressed around 15 GPa and reversed at higher pressures. These changes lead to a series of Lifshitz transitions that we detect using broadband and transient optical spectroscopy. Remarkably, the strength of the electronic correlations and the tendency to carrier localization are enhanced as the kagome network becomes more regular, suggesting that breathing distortion can be a unique control parameter for the microscopic regime of the kagome metals and their electron dynamics.

Title: Undamped soliton-like domain wall motion in sliding ferroelectrics
Authors: Yubai Shi, Ri He, Hua Wang, Yuxiang Gao, Binwen Zhang, Zhicheng Zhong
Abstract: Sliding ferroelectricity, which is a unique polarity recently discovered in bilayer van der Waals materials, achieves polarization switching through in-plane interlayer sliding. The unique mechanism, combining intralayer stiffness and interlayer slipperiness, leads to wider domain walls (DWs) and faster DW motion compared to conventional ferroelectrics. Herein, using machine-learning-assisted molecular dynamics simulations and field theory analysis, we find the DW in classical sliding ferroelectric bilayer 3R-MoS2 system exhibits uniformly accelerated motion under an external field, like the Newtonian particle with undamped motion. Remarkably, DW velocity remains constant even after the external field removal, completely deviating from the velocity breakdown observed in conventional ferroelectrics. We further propose an experimental approach to validate this undamped soliton-like DW behavior in sliding ferroelectric systems.

Title: Strengthening by softening: Rigidity increase of a curved sheet from nonlinear regime of deformation
Authors: Nino Quillent-Elinguel, Thomas Barois
Abstract: It is well-known that a thin sheet held in a rigid circular clamp has a larger flexural strength than when it is flat. Here, we report that the flexural strength of curved sheets is further increased with a softening of the clamping condition. This unexpected compliance effect relates to the geometrical properties of curvature-induced rigidity that we observe in controlled experiments and further analyze with numerical simulations. In addition, we identify another compliance effect in which opened curved sheets can be more resistant to bending than closed cylinders of same dimensions.

Title: Dislocations and plasticity of KTaO$_3$ perovskite modeled with a new interatomic potential
Authors: Pierre Hirel, Franck Junior Kakdeu Yewou, Jiawen Zhang, Wenjun Lu, Xufei Fang, Philippe Carrez
Abstract: Potassium tantalate KTaO3 is a cubic, paraelectric perovskite ceramic that exhibits surprising ductility at room temperature as most recently reported. Much like strontium titanate (SrTiO3), plastic deformation is accommodated by dislocations gliding in {110} planes. In this work we propose a new interatomic potential for KTaO3, and apply it to model dislocations with <110> Burgers vector. We demonstrate that dislocations dissociate, and finely characterize their core structure and Peierls potential. Dislocations of edge character can carry a positive or negative electric charge, but we show that charge-neutral configurations are energetically more favorable. We also perform high-resolution electron microscopy to validate our simulation methodology. Comparing our results with other ductile perovskites, we confirm KTaO3 to be ductile, but stiffer than SrTiO3.

Title: Topological Josephson vortices at finite voltage bias
Authors: Kiryl Piasotski, Adrian Reich, Alexander Shnirman
Abstract: We study the effects of finite voltage bias on Caroli-de Gennes-Matricon (CdGM) states in topological Josephson junctions with a vortex lattice. The voltage drives vortices into steady motion, squeezing the CdGM spectrum due to quasi-relativistic dispersion. A finite voltage range allows well-defined states, but beyond a critical breakdown voltage, the states collapse to zero energy and become sharply localized, marking a dynamical transition. Additionally, finite bias modifies selection rules for CdGM state transitions. Notably, in the steady-state regime, the time-averaged current vanishes, revealing a novel interplay between vortex dynamics and quantum coherence.

Title: Relationship between polymorphic structures and magnetic properties of La$_{2-x}A'_{x}$Ni$_{7}$ compounds ($A$' = Sm, Gd)
Authors: Valérie Paul-Boncour, Véronique Charbonnier, Nicolas Madern, Lotfi Bessais, Judith Monnier, Junxian Zhang
Abstract: In this study, the crystal structure and magnetic properties of La$_{2-x} A'_{x}$Ni$_{7}$ compounds with magnetic rare earth elements ($A$' = Sm, Gd) have been investigated combining X-ray powder diffraction and magnetic measurements. These intergrowth compounds crystallize in a mixture of 2$H$ hexagonal (Ce$_{2}$Ni$_{7}$-type) and 3$R$ rhombohedral (Gd$_{2}$Co$_{7}$-type) polymorphic structures which are related to the stacking of [$AB_{5}$] and [$A_{2}B_{4}$] subunits along the $c$-this http URL average cell volume decreases linearly versus $A$' content, whereas the $c/a$ ratio reaches a minimum at $x$ = 1, due to geometric constraints upon $A$' for La substitution between the two different subunits. The magnetic properties strongly depend on the structure type and the $A$' content. Hexagonal La$_{2}$Ni$_{7}$ is a weak antiferromagnet (wAFM) at low field and temperature and undergoes metamagnetic transitions towards weak ferromagnetic state (wFM) under applied field. Under an applied field of 0.1 T, La$_{2-x}A'_{x}$Ni$_{7}$ intermetallic compounds display two different transition temperatures $T_{1}$ and $T_{2}$ that both increase with $x$. $T_{1}$ is associated with a wFM-wAFM transition in the 2$H$ phase for $A$'= Sm, whereas $T_{2}$ is related to the Curie temperature of both 2$H$ and 3$R$ phases. A metamagnetic behaviour is observed between $T_{1}$ and $T_{2}$ with transition field $\mu_{0}H_{Trans}$ between 2 and 3.5 T for compounds with $A$' = Sm. The La$_{2-x}Sm_{x}$Ni$_{7}$ compounds ($x$ > 0} behave as hard magnets with a large coercive field $\mu_{0}H_{C}$ at low temperature ($\mu_{0}H_{C}$ > 9 T at 5 K for $x$ = 2), whereas the La$_{2-x} Gd_{x}$Ni$_{7}$ compounds ($x$ > 0) are soft ferrimagnets with a linear increase of the saturation magnetization versus Gd content.

Title: Charge Order Driven Multiferroic Behaviour in Sr$_4$Fe$_6$O$_{12}$: An $\textit{Ab-initio}$ Study
Authors: Arindam Sarkar, Hena Das, Prashant Singh, Aftab Alam
Abstract: In this letter, we report the structural, electronic and ferroelectric properties of the layered mixed-valent transition-metal compound, Sr$_{4}$Fe$_{6}$O$_{12}$ (SFO). We demonstrate how SFO undergoes a phase transition from a high-temperature (T) centrosymmetric tetragonal phase ($P4_{2}/mnm$) to a low-T polar orthorhombic phase ($Pmn2_{1}$). The transition is primarily driven by charge ordering at tetrahedral Fe-layer creating Fe$^{3+}$ and Fe$^{2+}$ cations between two edge sharing tetrahedra. This charge ordering induces electronic polarization, which is remarkably larger (3.5 times) in magnitude than ionic polarization and oppositely directed, giving a net polarization of 0.05 C/m$^2$ which is comparable to the state-of-the-art rare-earth nickelets and manganite perovskites. The direction of structural distortion, governed by the polar mode irrep $\Gamma_{5}^{-}$, depends sensitively on the type of magnetic ordering in the Fe-octahedral layer. Consequently, both the ionic and electronic polarization directions are influenced by magnetic ordering, suggesting the potential for multiferroic behavior with strong magneto-electric coupling in this material.

Title: Direction-Dependent Conduction Polarity in Altermagnetic CrSb
Authors: Banik Rai, Krishnendu Patra, Satyabrata Bera, Kakan Deb, Mintu Mondal, Priya Mahadevan, Nitesh Kumar
Abstract: CrSb has recently gained immense attention as an altermagnetic candidate. This work reports on the experimental observation of direction-dependent conduction polarity (DDCP) in altermagnetic CrSb through Hall and Seebeck thermopower measurements. Conduction is dominated by holes along the c-axis and by electrons in the ab-plane of the hexagonal crystal of CrSb. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that DDCP in CrSb arises from a multicarrier mechanism, where electrons and holes living in distinct bands dominate conduction along different crystallographic directions. Furthermore, DFT predicts that DDCP exists within a narrow energy window near the Fermi level and is sensitive to small doping levels. This prediction is experimentally validated by the loss of DDCP in hole-doped Cr$_{0.98}$V$_{0.02}$Sb. These findings highlight the potential for tunable electronic behavior in CrSb, offering promising avenues for applications in devices that require both p-type and n-type functionalities within a single material.

Title: Multiscale micromagnetic / atomistic modeling of heat assisted magnetic recording
Authors: Mohammed Gija, Alexey Dobrynin, Kevin McNeill, Mark Gubbins, Tim Mercer, Philip Bissell, Serban Lepadatu
Abstract: Heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR) is a recent advancement in magnetic recording, allowing to significantly increase the areal density capability (ADC) of hard disk drives (HDDs) compared to the perpendicular magnetic recording (PMR) technology. This is enabled by high anisotropy FePt media, which needs to be heated through its Curie temperature ($T_C$) to facilitate magnetization reversal by an electromagnetic write pole. HAMR micromagnetic modeling is therefore challenging, as it needs to be performed in proximity to and above $T_C$, where a ferromagnet has no spontaneous magnetization. An atomistic model is an optimal solution here, as it doesn't require any parameter renormalization or non-physical assumptions for modeling at any temperature. However, a full track atomistic recording model is extremely computationally expensive. Here we demonstrate a true multiscale HAMR modeling approach, combining atomistic spin dynamics modeling for high temperature regions and micromagnetic modeling for lower temperature regions, in a moving simulation window embedded within a long magnetic track. The advantages of this approach include natural emergence of $T_C$ and anisotropy distributions of FePt grains. Efficient GPU optimization of the code provides very fast running times, with a 60~nm wide track of twenty-five 20~nm - long bits being recorded in several hours on a single GPU. The effects of realistic FePt L$_{10}$ vs simple cubic crystal structure is discussed, with the latter providing further running time gains while keeping the advantages of the multiscale approach.

Dürr
Abstract: The use of advanced X-ray sources plays a key role in the study of dynamic processes in magnetically ordered materials. The progress in X-ray free electron lasers enables the direct and simultaneous observation of the femtosecond evolution of electron and spin systems through transient X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD), respectively. Such experiments allow us to resolve the response seen in the population of the spin-split valence states upon optical excitation. Here, we utilize circularly polarized ultrashort soft X-ray pulses from the new helical afterburner undulator at the free-electron laser FLASH in Hamburg to study the femtosecond dynamics of a laser-excited CoPt alloy at the Co $L_{3}$ absorption edge. Despite employing a weaker electronic excitation level we find a comparable demagnetization for the Co $3d$-states in CoPt compared to previous measurements on CoPd. This is attributed to distinctly different orbital hybridization and spin-orbit coupling between $3d$ and $4d$ vs. $3d$ and $5d$ elements in the corresponding alloys and multilayers.

Title: An altruistic resource-sharing mechanism for synchronization: The energy-speed-accuracy tradeoff
Authors: Dongliang Zhang, Yuansheng Cao, Qi Ouyang, Yuhai Tu
Abstract: Synchronization among a group of active agents is ubiquitous in nature. Although synchronization based on direct interactions between agents described by the Kuramoto model is well understood, the other general mechanism based on indirect interactions among agents sharing limited resources are less known. Here, we propose a minimal thermodynamically consistent model for the altruistic resource-sharing (ARS) mechanism wherein resources are needed for individual agent to advance but a more advanced agent has a lower competence to obtain resources. We show that while differential competence in ARS mechanism provides a negative feedback leading to synchronization it also breaks detailed balance and thus requires additional energy dissipation besides the cost of driving individual agents. By solving the model analytically, our study reveals a general tradeoff relation between the total energy dissipation rate and the two key performance measures of the system: average speed and synchronization accuracy. For a fixed dissipation rate, there is a distinct speed-accuracy Pareto front traversed by the scarcity of resources: scarcer resources lead to slower speed but more accurate synchronization. Increasing energy dissipation eases this tradeoff by pushing the speed-accuracy Pareto front outwards. The connections of our work to realistic biological systems such as the KaiABC system in cyanobacterial circadian clock and other theoretical results based on thermodynamic uncertainty relation are also discussed.

Title: From superconductivity to non-superconductivity in LiPdH: a first principle approach
Authors: Zahra Alizadeh, Yue-Wen Fang, Ion Errea, M.R. Mohammadizadeh
Abstract: The layered structure of LiPdH was theoretically suggested to be a superconductor as a result of its larger electron-phonon coupling constant compared to that of PdH. However, the experimental results reported contrary findings, with no trace of superconductivity. We study the electronic, vibrational, and superconducting properties of the ambient pressure tetragonal phase of LiPdH ($P4/mmm$) within first principles density functional theory methods, both in the harmonic and anharmonic approximations for the lattice dynamics, and conclude that it does not show any superconducting behavior. High-pressure crystal structure prediction calculations indicate that no structural transition is expected to occur under pressure up to 100 GPa in LiPdH. Our theoretical calculations demonstrate that increasing pressure reduces the density of states at the Fermi surface and consequently weakens electron-phonon interactions, leading to a further suppression of the superconducting critical temperature.

Title: Benchmarking a magnon-scattering reservoir with modal and temporal multiplexing
Authors: Christopher Heins, Joo-Von Kim, Lukas Körber, Jürgen Fassbender, Helmut Schultheiss, Katrin Schultheiss
Abstract: Physical reservoir computing has emerged as a powerful framework for exploiting the inherent nonlinear dynamics of physical systems to perform computational tasks. Recently, we presented the magnon-scattering reservoir, whose internal nodes are given by the fundamental wave-like excitations of ferromagnets called magnons. These excitations can be geometrically-quantized and, in response to an external stimulus, show transient nonlinear scattering dynamics that can be harnessed to perform memory and nonlinear transformation tasks. Here, we test a magnon-scattering reservoir in a single magnetic disk in the vortex state towards two key performance indicators for physical reservoir computing, the short-term memory and parity-check tasks. Using time-resolved Brillouin-light-scattering microscopy, we measure the evolution of the reservoir's spectral response to an input sequence consisting of random binary inputs encoded in microwave pulses with two distinct frequencies. Two different output spaces of the reservoir are defined, one based on the time-averaged frequency spectra and another based on temporal multiplexing. Our results demonstrate that the memory and nonlinear transformation capability do not depend on the chosen read-out scheme as long as the dimension of the output space is large enough to capture all nonlinear features provided by the magnon-magnon interactions. This further shows that solely the nonlinear magnons in the physical system, not the read-out, determine the reservoir's capacity.

Title: Computational insights into Cobalt-based novel half-Heusler alloy for sustainable energy applications
Authors: Sumit Kumar, Diwaker, Ashwani Kumar, Vivek, Arvind Sharma, Karan S. Vinayak, Shyam Lal Gupta
Abstract: The quest for efficient and sustainable green energy solutions has led to a growing interest in half Heusler alloys, particularly for thermoelectric and spintronic applications. This study investigates the multifaceted nature of cobalt based half Heusler alloy, CoVAs, employing DFT with advanced computational techniques, such as the FLAPW method. The elastic, electronic, magnetic, thermodynamic, and optical properties of CoVAs are meticulously analyzed. Structural and mechanical evaluations reveal mechanical stability and brittleness under varying pressures. Electronic and magnetic properties are examined through band structure and DOS analysis, revealing a half metallic nature with a minority spin band gap. The total magnetic moment aligns with the Slater Pauling rule, further confirming ferromagnetism and half metallicity. Thermodynamic investigations, based on the quasi-harmonic Debye approximation, provide insights into temperature- and pressure dependent behavior, including thermal expansion, heat capacity, and Debye temperature, establishing CoVAs as a viable candidate for high temperature applications. Additionally, the optical properties underestimate its potential in optoelectronic applications due to high absorption in the UV region, showing a distinct absorption edge corresponding to the electronic band gap. Phonon dispersion relations reflect the stability of the alloy, and the figure of merit confirms the alloy's suitability for thermodynamics applications. The findings highlight the potential of CoVAs as a promising candidate for spintronic photovoltaic and optoelectronic applications, providing insights into its fundamental properties that could facilitate experimental synthesis and industrial implementation for green energy and advanced technological applications.

Title: Anomalous Creep as a Precursor to Failure in Granular Materials
Authors: Kasra Farain, Daniel Bonn
Abstract: Granular materials, composed of discrete solid grains, can be modeled as simple mechanical systems. However, these materials can undergo spontaneous slow deformation, or creep, even under small forces and while in apparent mechanical equilibrium; a phenomenon central to understanding soil mechanics and the behavior of earthquake faults. We show that creep in granular materials originates from frictional dynamics at the contact points between grains. We reveal that the stability of these materials is governed by the interplay between creep and aging at these frictional contacts. Near the yield threshold, the frictional interactions result in anomalously accelerating creep, eventually leading to the delayed failure of the fragile packing. This behavior may serve as an early warning signal for catastrophic events like earthquakes and landslides.

Title: Ultrafast laser synthesis of zeolites

Abstract: Research has demonstrated that zeolite nucleation and growth can be controlled by fine-tuning chemical composition, temperature, and pressure, resulting in structures with diverse porosities and functionalities. Nevertheless, current energy delivery methods lack the finesse required to operate on the femto- and picosecond timescales of silica polymerisation and depolymerisation, limiting their ability to direct synthesis with high precision. To overcome this limitation, we introduce an ultrafast laser synthesis technique capable of delivering energy at these timescales with unprecedented spatiotemporal precision. Unlike conventional or emerging approaches, this method bypasses the need for specific temperature and pressure settings, as nucleation and growth are governed by dynamic phenomena arising from nonlinear light-matter interactions, such as convective flows, cavitation bubbles, plasma formation, and shock waves. These processes can be initiated, paused, and resumed within fractions of a second, effectively freezing structures at any stage of self-assembly. Using this approach, we traced the entire nucleation and growth pathway of laser-synthesized TPA-silicate-1 zeolites, from early oligomer formation to fully developed crystals. The unprecedented spatiotemporal control of this technique unlocks new avenues for manipulating reaction pathways and exploring the vast configurational space of zeolites.

Title: Spin filtration in a single-stranded antiferromagnetic helix with slowly varying disorder: Higher order electron hopping
Authors: Suparna Sarkar, Santanu K. Maiti, David Laroze
Abstract: This work explores spin filtration in a helical magnetic system within a tight-binding framework, where neighboring magnetic moments are aligned antiparallel. The helix experiences a slowly-varying diagonal disorder, following a cosine form, which creates a finite energy mismatch between up and down spin channels. Unlike earlier studies that relied on external electric fields, this investigation demonstrates that disorder alone can achieve high spin filtration, even at low bias and high temperatures. Higher-order electron hopping in the helix leads to a non-uniform energy level distribution, facilitating favorable spin filtration, sometimes reaching $100\%$. The interplay between higher-order hopping and atypical disorder may enable selective spin transmission through various antiferromagnetic helices, potentially opening new avenues for functional elements.

Title: Flow rate from a vertical silo with a tilted orifice
Authors: Ryan Kozlowski, Luis A. Pugnaloni
Abstract: The flow of dry granular materials from silos is of great practical interest in industry and of theoretical import for understanding multiphase dynamics. Recent studies have demonstrated that one way to control the rate of flow from a silo is to tilt it. However, this may not be practical in many industrial applications. Here, we demonstrate in experiments of quasi-2D silo discharge of monodisperse grains that the flow rate can be modulated by rotating the orifice - through elevating and shifting one side of the base - instead of tilting the entire silo. We use high-speed image analysis to track the average motion of grains in the silo. We first show that the flow rate decreases with orifice angle, but that this decrease is not as strong as when a silo is tilted or when a lateral orifice is used. However, with the addition of a grain-sized ridge on each side of the orifice, the flow rate collapses with prior tilted-silo results. We then characterize the flow velocity of grains exiting the orifice and highlight key features of the stagnant zones and slip zones on each orifice side. Finally, we model our results based on these measurements, demonstrating the importance of horizontal creep along slip zones next to the orifice and the narrowest opening cross-section through which the material flows. These findings reveal a simple method for controlling both flow rate and direction, and highlight the importance of both dynamics within and geometry of the stagnant zones near the orifice.

Title: Quasiparticle interference on the surface of Bi$_{\mathbf{2}}$Se$_{\mathbf{3}}$ terminated (PbSe)$_{\mathbf 5}$(Bi$_{\mathbf 2}$Se$_{\mathbf 3}$)$_{\mathbf 6}$
Authors: Mahasweta Bagchi, Philipp Rüßmann, Gustav Bihlmayer, Stefan Blügel, Yoichi Ando, Jens Brede
Abstract: The family of topological superconductors derived from $\mathrm{Bi}_{2}\mathrm{Se}_{3}$, $\mathrm{Cu}_x(\mathrm{PbSe})_{5}(\mathrm{Bi}_{2}\mathrm{Se}_{3})_{6}$ is unique in its surface termination of a single quintuple layer (QL) of the topological insulator (TI) $\mathrm{Bi}_{2}\mathrm{Se}_{3}$ on an ordinary insulator PbSe. Here, we report a combined scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and density functional theory (DFT) characterization of the cleaved surface of the parent compound $(\mathrm{PbSe})_{5}(\mathrm{Bi}_{2}\mathrm{Se}_{3})_{6}$ (PSBS). Interestingly, the potential disorder due to the random distribution of native defects is only $\Gamma \sim 4~\mathrm{meV}$, comparable to the smallest reported for TIs. Performing high-resolution quasiparticle interference imaging (QPI) near the Fermi energy ($E-E_\mathrm{F} = -1~\mathrm{eV}$ to $0.6~\mathrm{eV}$) we reconstruct the dispersion relation of the dominant spectral feature and our $\textit{ab initio}$ calculations show that this surface feature originates from two bands with Rashba-like splitting due to strong spin-orbit coupling and inversion symmetry breaking. Moreover, a small hexagonal distortion of the calculated Fermi surface is seen in the full momentum space distribution of the measured scattering data. Interestingly, the scattering pattern at lower energies transforms into a flower-like shape with suppressed intensity along the $\overline{\Gamma K}$ direction. However, this effect is not due to the forbidden backscattering in the spin-momentum locked surface state in $\mathrm{Bi}_{2}\mathrm{Se}_{3}$ but reflects the threefold symmetry of the scattering potential.

Title: Photo-induced Dynamics and Momentum Distribution of Chiral Charge Density Waves in 1T-TiSe$_{2}$

Abstract: Exploring the photoinduced dynamics of chiral states offers promising avenues for advanced control of condensed matter systems. Photoinduced or photoenhanced chirality in 1T-TiSe$_{2}$ has been suggested as a fascinating platform for optical manipulation of chiral states. However, the mechanisms underlying chirality training and its interplay with the charge density wave (CDW) phase remain elusive. Here, we use time-resolved X-ray diffraction (tr-XRD) with circularly polarized pump lasers to probe the photoinduced dynamics of chirality in 1T-TiSe$_{2}$. We observe a notable ($\sim$20%) difference in CDW intensity suppression between left- and right-circularly polarized pumps. Additionally, we reveal momentum-resolved circular dichroism arising from domains of different chirality, providing a direct link between CDW and chirality. An immediate increase in CDW correlation length upon laser pumping is detected, suggesting the photoinduced expansion of chiral domains. These results both advance the potential of light-driven chirality by elucidating the mechanism driving chirality manipulation in TiSe$_2$, and they demonstrate that tr-XRD with circularly polarized pumps is an effective tool for chirality detection in condensed matter systems.

Title: Composition Effects on Ni/Al Reactive Multilayers: A Comprehensive Study of Mechanical Properties, Reaction Dynamics and Phase Evolution
Authors: Nensi Toncich, Fabian Schwarz, Rebecca A. Gallivan, Jemma Gillon, Ralph Spolenak
Abstract: Ni/Al reactive multilayers are promising materials for applications requiring controlled local energy release and superior mechanical performance. This study systematically investigates the impact of compositional variations, ranging from 30 to 70 at.% Ni, and bilayer thicknesses (30 nm and 50 nm) on the mechanical properties and reaction dynamics of Ni/Al multilayers. Multilayers with varying Ni-to-Al ratios were fabricated and subjected to instrumented nanoindentation testing to evaluate hardness and elastic modulus. Combustion experiments, conducted on dogbone-shaped multilayers deposited onto silicon wafers with thermal barrier coatings, characterized the reaction front's speed, temperature, and the resulting phases. The findings revealed that composition variations within this range enable precise tuning of reaction speed and temperature without significant changes in mechanical properties, while deviations in modulus and hardness at higher nickel concentrations suggest microstructural influences. Notably, phase formation in Al-rich samples deviated from equilibrium predictions, highlighting the role of kinetic factors, such as diffusion and rapid quenching, in driving non-adiabatic processes during phase evolution. Molecular dynamics simulations provided complementary atomistic insights into mechanical responses and reaction kinetics, bridging experimental observations with theoretical predictions. This integrated approach advances the understanding of Ni/Al multilayers, offering a framework for optimizing their composition and structural design to achieve tailored performance for application-specific requirements.

Title: Direct observation of the exciton polaron by serial femtosecond crystallography on single CsPbBr$_3$ quantum dots

Mancuso, Richard Bean, Henry N. Chapman, Jochen Küpper, Ivan Infante, Holger Lange, Zeger Hens, Kartik Ayyer
Abstract: The outstanding opto-electronic properties of lead halide perovskites have been related to the formation of polarons. Nevertheless, the observation of the atomistic deformation brought about by one electron-hole pair in these materials has remained elusive. Here, we measure the diffraction patterns of single CsPbBr$_3$ quantum dots (QDs) with and without resonant excitation in the single exciton limit using serial femtosecond crystallography (SFX). By reconstructing the 3D differential diffraction pattern, we observe small shifts of the Bragg peaks indicative of a crystal-wide deformation field. Building on DFT calculations, we show that these shifts are consistent with the lattice distortion induced by a delocalized electron and a localized hole, forming a mixed large/small exciton polaron. This result creates a clear picture of the polaronic deformation in CsPbBr$_3$ QDs, highlights the exceptional sensitivity of SFX to lattice distortions in few-nanometer crystallites, and establishes an experimental platform for future studies of electron-lattice interactions.

Title: Electrical probe of spin-spiral order in quantum spin Hall/spin-spiral magnet van der Waals heterostructures
Authors: Fedor Nigmatulin (1), Jose L. Lado (2), Zhipei Sun (1) ((1) QTF Centre of Excellence, Department of Electronics and Nanoengineering, Aalto University, (2) Department of Applied Physics, Aalto University)
Abstract: Two-dimensional spin-spiral magnets provide promising building blocks for van der Waals heterostructures due to their tunable spin textures and potential for novel functionalities for quantum devices. However, due to its vanishing magnetization and two-dimensional nature, it is challenging to detect the existence of its noncollinear magnetization. Here, we show that a van der Waals junction based on a spin-spiral magnet and a quantum spin Hall insulator enables obtaining signatures of noncollinear magnetization directly from electrical measurements. Our strategy exploits the sensitivity of helical states to local breaking of time-reversal symmetry, enabling the detection of local magnetic orders even in the absence of net magnetization. We show that the combination of spin-spiral order and nonmagnetic disorder gives rise to scattering in the helical channels that can be directly associated with the spiral exchange coupling and residual nonmagnetic disorder strength. Our results show how electrical transport measurement provides a method to detect spin-spiral magnets by leveraging helical states in van der Waals heterostructures.

Abstract: Antiferroelectrics are valuable dielectric materials, offering promise for both high energy storage and solid-state caloric cooling applications. However, few antiferroelectrics are known or available. Therefore, it is crucial to discover or design materials showing antiferroelectric behaviour. In this study, we fabricated highly ordered lead scandium tantalate ceramics doped with calcium. From calorimetry and polarization-electric field loops, we demonstrate the effect of calcium on the thermal properties and phase transition sequences of lead scandium tantalate. We identify an antiferroelectric phase appearing at temperatures intermediate between the ferroelectric and paraelectric phases, which becomes increasingly stable as the calcium concentration increases. These findings are supported by density functional theory calculations and Raman spectroscopy. Finally, we propose a phase diagram for calcium-doped lead scandium tantalate. Our results highlight the potential of stabilizing antiferroelectricity in ferroelectric perovskite materials through A-site doping.

Title: Neural network potential molecular dynamics simulations of (La,Ce,Pr,Nd)0.95(Mg,Zn,Pb,Cd,Ca,Sr,Ba)0.05F2.95
Authors: Yoyo Hinuma
Abstract: Tysonite structure fluorides doped with divalent cations, represented by Ce0.95Ca0.05F2.95, are a class of good F- ion conductors together with fluorite-structured compounds. Computational understanding of the F- conduction process is difficult because of the complicated interactions between three symmetrically distinct F sites and the experimentally observed change in the F diffusion mechanism slightly above room temperature, effectively making first principles molecular dynamics (FP-MD) simulations, which are often conducted well above the transition temperature, useless when analyzing behavior below the transition point. Neural network potential (NNP) MD simulations showed that the F diffusion coefficient is higher when the divalent dopant cation size is similar to the trivalent cation size. The diffusion behavior of F in different sites changes at roughly 500 K in Ce0.95Ca0.05F2.95 because only the F1 site sublattice contributes to F diffusion below this temperature but the remaining F2 and F3 sublattices becomes gradually active above this temperature. The paradox of higher diffusion coefficients in CeF3-based compounds than similar LaF3-based compounds even though the lattice parameters are larger in the latter may be caused by a shallower potential of Ce and F in CeF3 compared to the LaF3 counterparts.

Title: Electric-Field Driven Nuclear Dynamics of Liquids and Solids from a Multi-Valued Machine-Learned Dipolar Model
Authors: Elia Stocco, Christian Carbogno, Mariana Rossi
Abstract: The driving of vibrational motion by external electric fields is a topic of continued interest, due to the possibility of assessing new or metastable material phases with desirable properties. Here, we combine ab initio molecular dynamics within the electric-dipole approximation with machine-learning neural networks (NNs) to develop a general, efficient and accurate method to perform electric-field-driven nuclear dynamics for molecules, solids, and liquids. We train equivariant and autodifferentiable NNs for the interatomic potential and the dipole, modifying the prediction target to account for the multi-valued nature of the latter in periodic systems. We showcase the method by addressing property modifications induced by electric field interactions in a polar liquid and a polar solid from nanosecond-long molecular dynamics simulations with quantum-mechanical accuracy. For liquid water, we present a calculation of the dielectric function in the GHz to THz range and the electrofreezing transition, showing that nuclear quantum effects enhance this phenomenon. For the ferroelectric perovskite LiNbO3, we simulate the ferroelectric to paraelectric phase transition and the non-equilibrium dynamics of driven phonon modes related to the polarization switching mechanisms, showing that a full polarization switch is not achieved in the simulations.

Title: Hydrogen liquid-liquid transition from first principles and machine learning
Authors: Giacomo Tenti, Bastian Jäckl, Kousuke Nakano, Matthias Rupp, Michele Casula
Abstract: The molecular-to-atomic liquid-liquid transition (LLT) in high-pressure hydrogen is a fundamental topic touching domains from planetary science to materials modeling. Yet, the nature of the LLT is still under debate. To resolve it, numerical simulations must cover length and time scales spanning several orders of magnitude. We overcome these size and time limitations by constructing a fast and accurate machine-learning interatomic potential (MLIP) built on the MACE neural network architecture. The MLIP is trained on Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) density functional calculations and uses a modified loss function correcting for an energy bias in the molecular phase. Classical and path-integral molecular dynamics driven by this MLIP show that the LLT is always supercritical above the melting temperature. The position of the corresponding Widom line agrees with previous ab initio PBE calculations, which in contrast predicted a first-order LLT. According to our calculations, the crossover line becomes a first-order transition only inside the molecular crystal region. These results call for a reconsideration of the LLT picture previously drawn.

Title: Solvers for Large-Scale Electronic Structure Theory: ELPA and ELSI
Authors: Petr Karpov, Andreas Marek, Tobias Melson, Alexander Pöppl, Victor Wen-zhe Yu, Ben Hourahine, Alberto Garcia, William Dawson, Yi Yao, William Huhn, Jonathan Moussa, Sam Hall, Reinhard Maurer, Uthpala Herath, Konstantin Lion, Sebastian Kokott, Volker Blum
Abstract: In this contribution, we give an overview of the ELPA library and ELSI interface, which are crucial elements for large-scale electronic structure calculations in FHI-aims. ELPA is a key solver library that provides efficient solutions for both standard and generalized eigenproblems, which are central to the Kohn-Sham formalism in density functional theory (DFT). It supports CPU and GPU architectures, with full support for NVIDIA and AMD GPUs, and ongoing development for Intel GPUs. Here we also report the results of recent optimizations, leading to significant improvements in GPU performance for the generalized eigenproblem. ELSI is an open-source software interface layer that creates a well-defined connection between "user" electronic structure codes and "solver" libraries for the Kohn-Sham problem, abstracting the step between Hamilton and overlap matrices (as input to ELSI and the respective solvers) and eigenvalues and eigenvectors or density matrix solutions (as output to be passed back to the "user" electronic structure code). In addition to ELPA, ELSI supports solvers including LAPACK and MAGMA, the PEXSI and NTPoly libraries (which bypass an explicit eigenvalue solution), and several others.

Title: Hydroelastic scattering and trapping of microswimmers
Authors: Sagnik Garai, Ursy Makanga, Akhil Varma, Christina Kurzthaler
Abstract: Deformable boundaries are omnipresent in the habitats of swimming microorganisms, leading to intricate hydroelastic couplings. Employing a perturbation theory, valid for small deformations, we study the swimming dynamics of pushers and pullers near instantaneously deforming boundaries, endowed with a bending rigidity and surface tension. Our results reveal that pushers can both reorient away from the boundary, leading to overall hydroelastic scattering, or become trapped by the boundary, akin to the enhanced trapping found for pullers. These findings demonstrate that the complex hydroelastic interactions can generate behaviors that are in striking contrast to swimming near planar walls.

Authors: Žiga Krajnik, Katja Klobas, Bruno Bertini, Tomaž Prosen
Abstract: We obtain the exact full counting statistics of a cellular automaton with freely propagating vacancies and charged particles that are stochastically scattered or transmitted upon collision by identifying the problem as a colored stochastic six-vertex model with one inert color. Typical charge current fluctuation at vanishing net charge follow a one-parameter distribution that interpolated between the distribution of the charged single-file class in the limit of pure reflection and a Gaussian distribution in the limit of pure transmission.

Title: Automated tuning and characterization of a single-electron transistor charge sensor
Authors: Andrija Paurevic, Ali Sakr, Tanmay Joshi, Dennis van der Bovenkamp, Quim T. Nicolau, Floris A. Zwanenburg, Jonathan Baugh
Abstract: We present an automated protocol for tuning single-electron transistors (SETs) or single-hole transistors (SHTs) to operate as precise charge sensors. Using minimal device-specific information, the protocol performs measurements to enable the selection and ranking of high-sensitivity operating points. It also characterizes key device parameters, such as dot radius and gate lever arms, through acquisition and analysis of Coulomb diamonds. Demonstration on an accumulation-mode silicon SET at 1.5 K highlights its potential in the 1-2 K range for "hot" spin qubits in scalable quantum computing systems. This approach significantly reduces the tuning time compared to manual methods, with future improvements aimed at faster runtimes and dynamic feedback for robustness to charge fluctuations.

Title: Fluctuation Dissipation Relations for the Non-Reciprocal Cahn-Hilliard Model
Authors: Martin Kjøllesdal Johnsrud, Ramin Golestanian
Abstract: Recent results demonstrate how deviations from equilibrium fluctuation-dissipation theorem can be quantified for active field theories by deriving exact fluctuations dissipation relations that involve the entropy production [M. K. Johnsrud and R. Golestanian, arXiv:2409.14977]. Here we develop and employ diagrammatic tools to perform perturbative calculations for a paradigmatic active field theory, the Non-Reciprocal Cahn-Hilliard (NRCH) model. We obtain analytical results, which serve as an illustration of how to implement the recently developed framework to active field theories, and help to illuminate the specific non-equilibrium characteristics of the NRCH field theory.

Title: Optimizing oil-water separation using fractal surfaces
Authors: Cristina Gavazzoni, Davi Lazzari, Iara Patrícia da Silva Ramos, Carolina Brito
Abstract: Oil has become a prevalent global pollutant, stimulating the research to improve the techniques to separate oil from water. Materials with special wetting properties - primarily those that repel water while attracting oil - have been proposed as suitable candidates for this task. However, one limitation in developing efficient substrates is the limited available volume for oil absorption. In this study we investigate the efficacy of disordered fractal materials in addressing this challenge, leveraging their unique wetting properties. Using a combination of a continuous model and Monte Carlo simulations, we characterize the hydrophobicity and oleophilicity of substrates created through ballistic deposition (BD). Our results demonstrate that these materials exhibit high contact angles for water, confirming their hydrophobic nature, while allowing significant oil penetration, indicative of oleophilic behavior. The available free volume within the substrates vary from $60\%$ to $90\%$ of the total volume of the substrate depending on some parameters of the BD. By combining their water and oil wetting properties with a high availability of volume, the fractal substrates analyzed in this work achieve an efficiency in separating oil from water of nearly $98\%$, which is significantly higher compared to a micro-pillared surfaces made from the same material but lacking a fractal design.

Title: Influence of the growth temperature and annealing on the optical properties of {CdO/ZnO}30 superlattices
Authors: E. Przeździecka, A. Lysak, A. Adhikari, M. Stachowicz, A. Wierzbicka, R. Jakiela, K. Zeinab, P. Sybilski, A. Kozanecki
Abstract: Optical properties of the short period {CdO/ZnO} superlattices grown by plasma assisted MBE were analyzed. The superlattice (SLs) structures were successfully obtained at different growth temperatures from 360 to 550 °C. Interestingly, the growth temperature of the SLs influences quality of multilayers and also optical properties of these structures. After annealing at 900°C by rapid thermal method various defect luminescence located at different energetic positions , were detected, and intensity of luminescence strongly depends on applied growth temperature.

Title: The Classical-to-Quantum Crossover in strain-induced ferroelectric transition in SrTiO$_3$ membranes
Authors: Jiarui Li, Yonghun Lee, Yongseong Choi, Jong-Woo Kim, Paul Thompson, Kevin J. Crust, Ruijuan Xu, Harold Y. Hwang, Philip J. Ryan, Wei-Sheng Lee
Abstract: Mechanical strain presents an effective control over symmetry-breaking phase transitions. In quantum paralelectric SrTiO3, strain can induce the ferroelectric transition via modification of local Ti potential landscape. However, brittle bulk materials can only withstand limited strain range (~0.1%). Taking advantage of nanoscopically-thin freestanding membranes, we demonstrated in-situ strain-induced reversible ferroelectric transition in a single freestanding SrTiO3 membranes. We measure the ferroelectric order by detecting the local anisotropy of the Ti 3d orbital using X-ray linear dichroism at the Ti-K pre-edge, while the strain is determined by X-ray diffraction. With reduced thickness, the SrTiO3 membranes remain elastic with >1% tensile strain cycles. A robust displacive ferroelectricity appears beyond a temperature-dependent critical strain. Interestingly, we discover a crossover from a classical ferroelectric transition to a quantum regime at low temperatures, which enhances strain-induced ferroelectricity. Our results offer a new opportunities to strain engineer functional properties in low dimensional quantum materials and provide new insights into the role of the ferroelectric fluctuations in quantum paraelectric SrTiO3.

Abstract: In the span of four decades, quantum computation has evolved from an intellectual curiosity to a potentially realizable technology. Today, small-scale demonstrations have become possible for quantum algorithmic primitives on hundreds of physical qubits and proof-of-principle error-correction on a single logical qubit. Nevertheless, despite significant progress and excitement, the path toward a full-stack scalable technology is largely unknown. There are significant outstanding quantum hardware, fabrication, software architecture, and algorithmic challenges that are either unresolved or overlooked. These issues could seriously undermine the arrival of utility-scale quantum computers for the foreseeable future. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of these scaling challenges. We show how the road to scaling could be paved by adopting existing semiconductor technology to build much higher-quality qubits, employing system engineering approaches, and performing distributed quantum computation within heterogeneous high-performance computing infrastructures. These opportunities for research and development could unlock certain promising applications, in particular, efficient quantum simulation/learning of quantum data generated by natural or engineered quantum systems. To estimate the true cost of such promises, we provide a detailed resource and sensitivity analysis for classically hard quantum chemistry calculations on surface-code error-corrected quantum computers given current, target, and desired hardware specifications based on superconducting qubits, accounting for a realistic distribution of errors. Furthermore, we argue that, to tackle industry-scale classical optimization and machine learning problems in a cost-effective manner, heterogeneous quantum-probabilistic computing with custom-designed accelerators should be considered as a complementary path toward scalability.

Title: Design of Engineered Living Materials for Martian Construction
Authors: Nisha Rokaya, Erin C. Carr, Richard A. Wilson, Congrui Jin
Abstract: As the next step in extraterrestrial exploration, many engineers and scientists around the country revealed their intense interest to enable multiplanetary human life, including colonizing Mars. This study proposes that architecture on Mars can be realized by a synthetic lichen system, composed of diazotrophic cyanobacteria and filamentous fungi, which produce abundant biominerals and biopolymers to bond Martian regolith into consolidated building blocks. These self-growing building blocks can be assembled into a wide range of structures. Diazotrophic cyanobacteria will 1) fix carbon dioxide and dinitrogen from the atmosphere and convert them into oxygen and organic carbon and nitrogen sources to support filamentous fungi; and 2) give rise to high concentrations of carbonate ions because of photosynthetic activities. Filamentous fungi will 1) bind metal ions onto fungal cell walls and serve as nucleation sites to promote biomineral precipitates; and 2) assist the survival and growth of cyanobacteria by providing them water, minerals, additional carbon dioxide, and protection. This report presents the major progress of the project. It has been tested and confirmed that such co-culture systems can be created, and they grow very well solely on Martian regolith simulants, air, light, and an inorganic liquid medium without any additional carbon or nitrogen sources. The cyanobacterial and fungal growth in such co-culture systems is significantly better than their axenic growth due to mutual interactions. The amounts and morphologies of the precipitated crystals vary remarkably depending on the cultivation condition.

Title: Holographic Time Crystals vs Penrose
Authors: Åsmund Folkestad
Abstract: In the large$-N$ limit, no known no-go theorem rules out thermal time crystals that spontaneously break continuous time-translation, unlike in the large volume limit. If thermal time crystals exist in holographic CFTs, they would correspond to ensemble-dominating black holes with eternally time-varying exterior geometries. We point out that recent work on a conjectured non-linear instability of slowly rotating Kerr-AdS$_4$ produced viable candidates for such states. Then we show that the existence of holographic microcanonical time crystals would imply violations of the AdS Penrose inequality (PI). We proceed to look for violations of the PI in spherical symmetry, working with Einstein-scalar gravity with the most general possible boundary conditions compatible with boundary conformal invariance. We derive a set of ODEs for maximally PI-violating initial data. Solving these numerically, we find strong evidence that in the particular case of spherical symmetry, the PI holds iff the positive mass theorem (PMT) holds. This suggests that holographic CFT$_3$ time crystals can only possibly exist at non-zero angular momentum, at least in the absence of electric charge. We also discover neutral hairy black holes in a consistent truncation of M-theory that has a PMT and boundary conditions respecting conformal invariance, disproving an existing no-hair conjecture. Finally, we show that previous PI-violating solutions by the author all existed in theories where the PMT is violated. Unfortunately, our results imply that there currently are no known examples where the PI functions as a non-trivial Swampland constraint.

Title: Direct Dark Matter searches with Metal Halide Perovskites
Authors: Davide Baiocco, Damiano Marian, Giulio Marino, Paolo Panci, Marco Polini, Alessandro Tredicucci
Abstract: Polar materials with optical phonons in the meV range are excellent candidates for both dark matter direct detection (via dark photon-mediated scattering) and light dark matter absorption. In this study, we propose, for the first time, the metal halide perovskites MAPbI$_3$, MAPbCl$_3$, and CsPbI$_3$ for these purposes. Our findings reveal that CsPbI$_3$ is the best material, significantly improving exclusion limits compared to other polar materials. For scattering, CsPbI$_3$ can probe dark matter masses down to the keV range. For absorption, it enhances sensitivity to detect dark photon masses below $\sim 10~{\rm meV}$. The only material which has so far been investigated and that could provide competitive bounds is CsI, which, however, is challenging to grow in kilogram-scale sizes due to its considerably lower stability compared to CsPbI$_3$. Moreover, CsI is isotropic while the anisotropic structure of CsPbI$_3$ enables daily modulation analysis, showing that a significant percentage of daily modulation exceeding 1% is achievable for dark matter masses below $40~{\rm keV}$.

Title: Postselection-free experimental observation of the measurement-induced phase transition in circuits with universal gates
Authors: Xiaozhou Feng, Jeremy Côté, Stefanos Kourtis, Brian Skinner
Abstract: Monitored many-body systems can exhibit a phase transition between entangling and disentangling dynamical phases by tuning the strength of measurements made on the system as it evolves. This phenomenon is called the measurement-induced phase transition (MIPT). Understanding the properties of the MIPT is a prominent challenge for both theory and experiment at the intersection of many-body physics and quantum information. Realizing the MIPT experimentally is particularly challenging due to the postselection problem, which demands a number of experimental realizations that grows exponentially with the number of measurements made during the dynamics. Proposed approaches that circumvent the postselection problem typically rely on a classical decoding process that infers the final state based on the measurement record. But the complexity of this classical process generally also grows exponentially with the system size unless the dynamics is restricted to a fine-tuned set of unitary operators. In this work we overcome these difficulties. We construct a tree-shaped quantum circuit whose nodes are Haar-random unitary operators followed by weak measurements of tunable strength. For these circuits, we show that the MIPT can be detected without postselection using only a simple classical decoding process whose complexity grows linearly with the number of qubits. Our protocol exploits the recursive structure of tree circuits, which also enables a complete theoretical description of the MIPT, including an exact solution for its critical point and scaling behavior. We experimentally realize the MIPT on Quantinuum's H1-1 trapped-ion quantum computer and show that the experimental results are precisely described by theory. Our results close the gap between analytical theory and postselection-free experimental observation of the MIPT.

Title: Grokking vs. Learning: Same Features, Different Encodings
Authors: Dmitry Manning-Coe, Jacopo Gliozzi, Alexander G. Stapleton, Edward Hirst, Giuseppe De Tomasi, Barry Bradlyn, David S. Berman
Abstract: Grokking typically achieves similar loss to ordinary, "steady", learning. We ask whether these different learning paths - grokking versus ordinary training - lead to fundamental differences in the learned models. To do so we compare the features, compressibility, and learning dynamics of models trained via each path in two tasks. We find that grokked and steadily trained models learn the same features, but there can be large differences in the efficiency with which these features are encoded. In particular, we find a novel "compressive regime" of steady training in which there emerges a linear trade-off between model loss and compressibility, and which is absent in grokking. In this regime, we can achieve compression factors 25x times the base model, and 5x times the compression achieved in grokking. We then track how model features and compressibility develop through training. We show that model development in grokking is task-dependent, and that peak compressibility is achieved immediately after the grokking plateau. Finally, novel information-geometric measures are introduced which demonstrate that models undergoing grokking follow a straight path in information space.

Authors: Aditya N. Singh, Avishek Das, David T. Limmer
Abstract: This article reviews the concepts and methods of variational path sampling. These methods allow computational studies of rare events in systems driven arbitrarily far from equilibrium. Based upon a statistical mechanics of trajectory space and leveraging the theory of large deviations, they provide a perspective with which dynamical phenomena can be studied with the same types of ensemble reweighting ideas that have been used for static equilibrium properties. Applications to chemical, material, and biophysical systems are highlighted.

Title: ContinuouSP: Generative Model for Crystal Structure Prediction with Invariance and Continuity
Authors: Yuji Tone, Masatoshi Hanai, Mitsuaki Kawamura, Kenjiro Taura, Toyotaro Suzumura
Abstract: The discovery of new materials using crystal structure prediction (CSP) based on generative machine learning models has become a significant research topic in recent years. In this paper, we study invariance and continuity in the generative machine learning for CSP. We propose a new model, called ContinuouSP, which effectively handles symmetry and periodicity in crystals. We clearly formulate the invariance and the continuity, and construct a model based on the energy-based model. Our preliminary evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of this model with the CSP task.

Title: Cyclic behavior of masonry barrel vaults strengthened through Composite Reinforced Mortar, considering the role of the connection with the abutments
Authors: Ingrid Boem, Natalino Gattesco
Abstract: The original results of experimental investigations concerning the reduction of the seismic vulnerability of masonry vaults through Composite Reinforced Mortar CRM are presented in the paper. The transversal performances of full scale, masonry barrel vault samples, i.e. running bond pattern vaults and brick in folio vaults, carrying their own weight and reinforced at the extrados or at the intrados are investigated through cyclic tests. The connection of the reinforced vaults with the masonry abutment is particularly considered and discussed, due to the importance of this detail to avoid uplift and slip at the skewback sections and better exploit the CRM benefits. The experimental behavior of the vault samples is described and analyzed in terms of global behavior, crack pattern and load displacement curves, also in comparison with the unreinforced configurations. The CRM allowed significant improvements in both vaults strength and displacement capacities, as contrasted the cracks opening and foster the spreading of cracks all along the vault. Considerable performances emerged also in terms of dissipative capacities, with a mean damping value of about 0.13 in the post cracking configuration. The vault-to-wall connection, based on embedded steel and composite bars, resulted essential for avoiding dangerous vault sliding at skewback sections, that may reduce the vault performances and also cause the fall from the support.

Title: Fourier-Tailored Light-Matter Coupling in van der Waals Heterostructures
Authors: Dorte R. Danielsen, Nolan Lassaline, Sander J. Linde, Magnus V. Nielsen, Xavier Zambrana-Puyalto, Avishek Sarbajna, Duc Hieu Nguyen, Timothy J. Booth, Nicolas Stenger, Søren Raza
Abstract: Dielectric structures can support low-absorption optical modes, which are attractive for engineering light-matter interactions with excitonic resonances in two-dimensional (2D) materials. However, the coupling strength is often limited by the electromagnetic field being confined inside the dielectric, reducing spatial overlap with the active excitonic material. Here, we demonstrate a scheme for enhanced light-matter coupling by embedding excitonic tungsten disulfide (WS$_2$) within dielectric hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), forming a van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure that optimizes the field overlap and alignment between excitons and optical waveguide modes. To tailor diffractive coupling between free-space light and the waveguide modes in the vdW heterostructure, we fabricate Fourier surfaces in the top hBN layer using thermal scanning-probe lithography and etching, producing sinusoidal topographic landscapes with nanometer precision. We observe the formation of exciton-polaritons with a Rabi splitting indicating that the system is at the onset of strong coupling. These results demonstrate the potential of Fourier-tailored vdW heterostructures for exploring advanced optoelectronic and quantum devices.

Title: Tadah! A Swiss Army Knife for Developing and Deployment of Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials
Authors: M. Kirsz, A. Daramola, A. Hermann, H. Zong, G. J. Ackland
Abstract: The Tadah! code provides a versatile platform for developing and optimizing Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs). By integrating composite descriptors, it allows for a nuanced representation of system interactions, customized with unique cutoff functions and interaction distances. Tadah! supports Bayesian Linear Regression (BLR) and Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR) to enhance model accuracy and uncertainty management. A key feature is its hyperparameter optimization cycle, iteratively refining model architecture to improve transferability. This approach incorporates performance constraints, aligning predictions with experimental and theoretical data. Tadah! provides an interface for LAMMPS, enabling the deployment of MLIPs in molecular dynamics simulations. It is designed for broad accessibility, supporting parallel computations on desktop and HPC systems. Tadah! leverages a modular C++ codebase, utilizing both compile-time and runtime polymorphism for flexibility and efficiency. Neural network support and predefined bonding schemes are potential future developments, and Tadah! remains open to community-driven feature expansion. Comprehensive documentation and command-line tools further streamline the development and application of MLIPs.

Title: Suppressing Mechanical Property Variability in Recycled Plastics via Bio-inspired Design
Authors: Dimitrios Georgiou, Danqi Sun, Xing Liu, Christos E Athanasiou
Abstract: The escalating plastic waste crisis demands global action, yet mechanical recycling - currently the most prevalent strategy - remains severely underutilized. Only a small fraction of the total plastic waste is recycled in this manner, largely due to the significant variability in recycled plastics' mechanical properties. This variability stems from compositional fluctuations and impurities introduced throughout the materials' lifecycle and the recycling process, deterring industries with stringent product specifications from adopting recycled plastics on a wider scale. To overcome this challenge, we propose a composite structure inspired by nacre's microstructure - a natural material known for its exceptional mechanical performance despite its inherent randomness across multiple length scales. This bio-inspired design features stiff recycled plastic platelets ("bricks") within a soft polymeric matrix ("mortar"). We use a tension-shear-chain model to capture the deformation mechanism of the structure, and demonstrate, through a case study of commercial stretch wrap, that the proposed design reduces variability in effective elastic modulus by 89.5% and in elongation at break by 42%, while achieving the same modulus as the virgin stretch wrap material. These findings highlight the potential of the proposed bio-inspired design to enhance the mechanical performance of recycled plastics, but also demonstrate that a universally applicable, chemistry-agnostic approach can substantially broaden their applications, paving the way for sustainable plastic waste management.

Title: Excited States of the Uniform Electron Gas
Authors: Pierre-François Loos
Abstract: The uniform electron gas (UEG) is a cornerstone of density-functional theory (DFT) and the foundation of the local-density approximation (LDA), one of the most successful approximations in DFT. In this work, we extend the concept of UEG by introducing excited-state UEGs, systems characterized by a gap at the Fermi surface created by the excitation of electrons near the Fermi level. We report closed-form expressions of the reduced kinetic and exchange energies of these excited-state UEGs as functions of the density and the gap. Additionally, we derive the leading term of the correlation energy in the high-density limit. By incorporating an additional variable representing the degree of excitation into the UEG paradigm, the present work introduces a new framework for constructing local and semi-local state-specific functionals for excited states.

Title: Emergent clogging of continuum particle suspensions in constricted channels
Authors: Anushka Herale, Philip Pearce, Duncan Hewitt
Abstract: Particle suspensions in confined geometries can become clogged, which can have a catastrophic effect on function in biological and industrial systems. Here, we investigate the macroscopic dynamics of suspensions in constricted geometries. We develop a minimal continuum two-phase model that allows for variation in particle volume fraction. The model comprises a ``wet solid'' phase with material properties dependent on the particle volume fraction, and a seepage Darcy flow of fluid through the particles. We find that spatially varying geometry (or material properties) can induce emergent heterogeneity in the particle fraction and trigger the abrupt transition to a high-particle-fraction ``clogged'' state.

Title: Topological Tenfold Classification and the Entanglement of Two Qubits
Authors: Nadav Orion, Eric Akkermans
Abstract: We present a constructive method utilizing the Cartan decomposition to characterize topological properties and their connection to two-qubit quantum entanglement, in the framework of the tenfold classification and Wootters' concurrence. This relationship is comprehensively established for the 2-qubit system through the antiunitary time reversal (TR) operator. The TR operator is shown to identify concurrence and differentiate between entangling and non-entangling operators. This distinction is of a topological nature, as the inclusion or exclusion of certain operators alters topological characteristics. Proofs are presented which demonstrate that the 2-qubit system can be described in the framework of the tenfold classification, unveiling aspects of the connection between entanglement and a geometrical phase. Topological features are obtained systematically by a mapping to a quantum graph, allowing for a direct computation of topological integers and of the 2-qubit equivalent of topological zero-modes. An additional perspective is provided regarding the extension of this new approach to condensed matter systems, illustrated through examples involving indistinguishable fermions and arrays of quantum dots.

Abstract: The advent of 6G communication demands seamlessly integrated terminals operating above 100 GHz with low power consumption for human-centric applications. In this work, we report high-performance, flexible radio-frequency (RF) transistors based on aligned carbon nanotube (CNT) arrays, achieving, for the first time, as-measured current gain cutoff frequency ($f_{\mathrm{T}}$) and power gain cutoff frequency ($f_{\mathrm{max}}$) both exceeding 100 GHz. Electro-thermal co-design improves both heat dissipation and RF performance, despite the low thermal conductivity of the flexible substrate. The transistors deliver 0.947 mA/ $\mathrm{\mu}$m on-state current and 0.728 mS/ $\mathrm{\mu}$m transconductance. Peak extrinsic $f_{\mathrm{T}}$ and $f_{\mathrm{max}}$ reach 152 GHz and 102 GHz, with low power consumption of 199 mW/mm and 147 mW/mm, respectively, setting new performance records for flexible CNT-based RF transistors by nearly $100\times$, outperforming all other flexible RF devices. Additionally, flexible RF amplifiers achieve output power of 64 mW/mm and power gain of 11 dB in the K-band (18 GHz), marking a significant milestone in the development of flexible RF technologies for next-generation wireless communication systems.

Title: Deep Linear Network Training Dynamics from Random Initialization: Data, Width, Depth, and Hyperparameter Transfer
Authors: Blake Bordelon, Cengiz Pehlevan
Abstract: We theoretically characterize gradient descent dynamics in deep linear networks trained at large width from random initialization and on large quantities of random data. Our theory captures the ``wider is better" effect of mean-field/maximum-update parameterized networks as well as hyperparameter transfer effects, which can be contrasted with the neural-tangent parameterization where optimal learning rates shift with model width. We provide asymptotic descriptions of both non-residual and residual neural networks, the latter of which enables an infinite depth limit when branches are scaled as $1/\sqrt{\text{depth}}$. We also compare training with one-pass stochastic gradient descent to the dynamics when training data are repeated at each iteration. Lastly, we show that this model recovers the accelerated power law training dynamics for power law structured data in the rich regime observed in recent works.

Title: Optimal Spectral Transitions in High-Dimensional Multi-Index Models
Authors: Leonardo Defilippis, Yatin Dandi, Pierre Mergny, Florent Krzakala, Bruno Loureiro
Abstract: We consider the problem of how many samples from a Gaussian multi-index model are required to weakly reconstruct the relevant index subspace. Despite its increasing popularity as a testbed for investigating the computational complexity of neural networks, results beyond the single-index setting remain elusive. In this work, we introduce spectral algorithms based on the linearization of a message passing scheme tailored to this problem. Our main contribution is to show that the proposed methods achieve the optimal reconstruction threshold. Leveraging a high-dimensional characterization of the algorithms, we show that above the critical threshold the leading eigenvector correlates with the relevant index subspace, a phenomenon reminiscent of the Baik-Ben Arous-Peche (BBP) transition in spiked models arising in random matrix theory. Supported by numerical experiments and a rigorous theoretical framework, our work bridges critical gaps in the computational limits of weak learnability in multi-index model.

Abstract: The discovery of new materials is essential for enabling technological advancements. Computational approaches for predicting novel materials must effectively learn the manifold of stable crystal structures within an infinite design space. We introduce Open Materials Generation (OMG), a unifying framework for the generative design and discovery of inorganic crystalline materials. OMG employs stochastic interpolants (SI) to bridge an arbitrary base distribution to the target distribution of inorganic crystals via a broad class of tunable stochastic processes, encompassing both diffusion models and flow matching as special cases. In this work, we adapt the SI framework by integrating an equivariant graph representation of crystal structures and extending it to account for periodic boundary conditions in unit cell representations. Additionally, we couple the SI flow over spatial coordinates and lattice vectors with discrete flow matching for atomic species. We benchmark OMG's performance on two tasks: Crystal Structure Prediction (CSP) for specified compositions, and 'de novo' generation (DNG) aimed at discovering stable, novel, and unique structures. In our ground-up implementation of OMG, we refine and extend both CSP and DNG metrics compared to previous works. OMG establishes a new state-of-the-art in generative modeling for materials discovery, outperforming purely flow-based and diffusion-based implementations. These results underscore the importance of designing flexible deep learning frameworks to accelerate progress in materials science.

Title: Maximizing free energy gain
Authors: Artemy Kolchinsky, Iman Marvian, Can Gokler, Zi-Wen Liu, Peter Shor, Oles Shtanko, Kevin Thompson, David Wolpert, Seth Lloyd
Abstract: Maximizing the amount of work harvested from an environment is important for a wide variety of biological and technological processes, from energy-harvesting processes such as photosynthesisto energy storage systems such as fuels and batteries. Here we consider the maximization of free energy -- and by extension, the maximum extractable work -- that can be gained by a classical or quantum system that undergoes driving by its environment. We consider how the free energy gain depends on the initial state of the system, while also accounting for the cost of preparing the system. We provide simple necessary and sufficient conditions for increasing the gain of free energy by varying the initial state. We also derive simple formulae that relate the free energy gained using the optimal initial state rather than another suboptimal initial state. Finally, we demonstrate that the problem of finding the optimal initial state may have two distinct regimes, one easy and one difficult, depending on the temperatures used for preparation and work extraction. We illustrate our results on a simple model of an information engine.

Title: Breakdown of random-matrix universality in persistent Lotka--Volterra communities
Authors: Joseph W. Baron, Thomas Jun Jewell, Christopher Ryder, Tobias Galla
Abstract: The eigenvalue spectrum of a random matrix often only depends on the first and second moments of its elements, but not on the specific distribution from which they are drawn. The validity of this universality principle is often assumed without proof in applications. In this letter, we offer a pertinent counterexample in the context of the generalised Lotka--Volterra equations. Using dynamic mean-field theory, we derive the statistics of the interactions between species in an evolved ecological community. We then show that the full statistics of these interactions, beyond those of a Gaussian ensemble, are required to correctly predict the eigenvalue spectrum and therefore stability. Consequently, the universality principle fails in this system. We thus show that the eigenvalue spectra of random matrices can be used to deduce the stability of `feasible' ecological communities, but only if the emergent non-Gaussian statistics of the interactions between species are taken into account.

Title: Superconducting-insulating phase transition in pressurized Ba1-xKxBiO3
Authors: Jinyu Han, Xiangde Zhu, Jianfeng Zhang, Shu Cai, Luhong Wang, Yang Gao, Fuyang Liu, Haozhe Liu, Saori I. Kawaguchi, Jing Guo, Yazhou Zhou, Jinyu Zhao, Pengyu Wang, Lixin Cao, Mingliang Tian, Qi Wu, Tao Xiang, Liling Sun
Abstract: We report the first observation of a pressure-induced transition from a superconducting (SC) to an insulating (I) phase in single-crystal Ba1-xKxBiO3 (x = 0.4, 0.43, 0.52, and 0.58) superconductors. X-ray diffraction measurements conducted at 20 K reveal a direct relationship between this SC-I transition and a pressure-induced distortion of crystal structure. With increasing pressure, the lattice parameters a and c of the ambient-pressure superconducting tetragonal (T) phase are compressed continuously below a critical pressure (Pc1), wherein the pressure (P) dependence of superconducting transition temperature (Tc) displays a small variation. However, upon further compression, the lattice of the compressed T phase displays an anisotropic change, and Tc shows a monotonous decrease. When the pressure reaches Pc2 (Pc2 > Pc1), the compressed T phase collapses along the c axis, followed by the disappearance of superconductivity and the appearance of the insulating phase. This SC-I transition is fully reversible, with the critical pressure increasing alongside K doping concentration. These findings are strikingly similar to the SC-I transition observed in hole-doped high-Tc cuprate superconductors under pressure. Identifying their commonalities could deepen our understanding of the mechanisms that underlie high- Tc superconductivity in these two oxide superconductors with a perovskite structure.

Title: A path integral approach to sparse non-Hermitian random matrices
Authors: Joseph W. Baron
Abstract: The theory of large random matrices has proved an invaluable tool for the study of systems with disordered interactions in many quite disparate research areas. Widely applicable results, such as the celebrated elliptic law for dense random matrices, allow one to deduce the statistical properties of the interactions in a complex dynamical system that permit stability. However, such simple and universal results have so far proved difficult to come by in the case of sparse random matrices. Here, we perform an expansion in the inverse connectivity, and thus derive general modified versions of the classic elliptic and semi-circle laws, taking into account the sparse correction. This is accomplished using a dynamical approach, which maps the hermitized resolvent of a random matrix onto the response functions of a linear dynamical system. The response functions are then evaluated using a path integral formalism, enabling one to construct Feynman diagrams, which facilitate the perturbative analysis. Additionally, in order to demonstrate the broad utility of the path integral framework, we derive a generic non-Hermitian generalization of the Marchenko-Pastur law, and we also show how one can handle non-negligible higher-order statistics (i.e. non-Gaussian statistics) in dense ensembles.

Title: Optical manifestations and bounds of topological Euler class
Authors: Wojciech J. Jankowski, Arthur S. Morris, Adrien Bouhon, F. Nur Ünal, Robert-Jan Slager
Abstract: We analyze quantum-geometric bounds on optical weights in topological phases with pairs of bands hosting nontrivial Euler class, a multigap invariant characterizing non-Abelian band topology. We show how the bounds constrain the combined optical weights of the Euler bands at different dopings and further restrict the size of the adjacent band gaps. In this process, we also consider the associated interband contributions to dc conductivities in the flat-band limit. We physically validate these results by recasting the bound in terms of transition rates associated with the optical absorption of light, and demonstrate how the Euler connections and curvatures can be determined through the use of momentum and frequency-resolved optical measurements, allowing for a direct measurement of this multiband invariant. Additionally, we prove that the bound holds beyond the degenerate limit of Euler bands, resulting in nodal topology captured by the patch Euler class. In this context, we deduce optical manifestations of Euler topology within $\vec{k} \cdot \vec{p}$ models, which include quantized optical conductivity, and third-order jerk photoconductivities. We showcase our findings with numerical validation in lattice-regularized models that benchmark effective theories for real materials and are realizable in metamaterials and optical lattices.

Title: Investigations of key issues on the reproducibility of high-Tc superconductivity emerging from compressed La3Ni2O7
Authors: Yazhou Zhou, Jing Guo, Shu Cai, Hualei Sun, Pengyu Wang, Jinyu Zhao, Jinyu Han, Xintian Chen, Yongjin Chen, Qi Wu, Yang Ding, Tao Xiang, Ho-kwang Mao, Liling Sun
Abstract: Recently, the signatures of superconductivity near 80 K have been discovered in the single crystal of La3Ni2O7 under pressure, which makes it a new candidate of the high-temperature superconductors dominated by 3d transition elements after the cuprate and iron-pnictide superconductors. However, there are several critical questions that have been perplexing the scientific community. These questions include (1) what factors contribute to the inconsistent reproducibility of the experimental results? (2) what is the fundamental nature of pressure-induced superconductivity: bulk or non-bulk (filamentary-like)? (3) where does the superconducting phase locate within the sample if it is filamentary-like? (4) is the oxygen content important for developing and stabilizing its superconductivity? In this study, we employ comprehensive high-pressure techniques to address these crucial issues. Through our modulated ac susceptibility measurements, we are the first to find that the superconductivity in this nickelate is filamentary-like. Our scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) investigations suggest that the filamentary-like superconductivity most likely emerges at the interface between the La3Ni2O7 and La4Ni3O10 phases. By tuning the oxygen content on the polycrystalline La3Ni2O7, we also find that the oxygen content plays vital role for developing and stabilizing its superconductivity. The upper and lower bounds of the oxygen content are 7.35 and 6.89, respectively. Our results provide not only new insights into understanding the puzzling issues in this material, but also significant information for achieving a better understanding on the superconductivity of this material.

Title: Statistical Mechanics of Dynamical System Identification
Authors: Andrei A. Klishin, Joseph Bakarji, J. Nathan Kutz, Krithika Manohar
Abstract: Recovering dynamical equations from observed noisy data is the central challenge of system identification. We develop a statistical mechanics approach to analyze sparse equation discovery algorithms, which typically balance data fit and parsimony via hyperparameter tuning. In this framework, statistical mechanics offers tools to analyze the interplay between complexity and fitness similarly to that of entropy and energy in physical systems. To establish this analogy, we define the hyperparameter optimization procedure as a two-level Bayesian inference problem that separates variable selection from coefficient inference and enables the computation of the posterior parameter distribution in closed form. Our approach provides uncertainty quantification, crucial in the low-data limit that is frequently encountered in real-world applications. A key advantage of employing statistical mechanical concepts, such as free energy and the partition function, is to connect the large data limit to thermodynamic limit and characterize the sparsity- and noise-induced phase transitions that delineate correct from incorrect identification. We thus provide a method for closed-loop inference, estimating the noise in a given model and checking if the model is tolerant to that noise amount. This perspective of sparse equation discovery is versatile and can be adapted to various other equation discovery algorithms.

Title: Enhanced strong interaction effect in synthetic spin-orbit coupling with mixed spin symmetry
Authors: Ayaka Usui, Abel Rojo-Francàs, James Schloss, Bruno Juliá-Díaz
Abstract: Synthetic spin-orbit coupling in cold atoms couples the pseudo-spin and spatial degrees of freedom, and therefore the inherent spin symmetry of the system plays an important role. In systems of two pseudo-spin degrees, two particles contain symmetric states and anti-symmetric states, but the spin symmetry can be mixed for more particles. This mixed spin symmetry has been overlooked and has not been investigated thoroughly. We study the role of mixed spin symmetry in the presence of spin-orbit coupling and consider the system of three bosons with two hyper-fine states trapped in a harmonic potential. We investigate the ground state and the energy spectrum by implementing exact diagonalization. Similarly to two-particle systems, the interplay between spin-orbit coupling and repulsive interactions between anti-aligned pseudo-spins increases the population of the unaligned spin components in the ground state. Also, the emergence of the mixed spin symmetric states compensates for the rise of the interaction energy. In contrast to two-particle systems, the pair correlation of the ground state is analogous to the Tonks-Girardeau gas even for relatively small contact interactions, and this feature is enhanced by the spin-orbit coupling.

Title: Tailoring topological band properties of twisted double bilayer graphene: effects due to spin-orbit coupling
Authors: Kamalesh Bera, Priyanka Mohan, Arijit Saha
Abstract: Our theoretical study unfolds the topological phase transitions (within bands of the Moiré super-lattice) in small angle twisted double bilayer graphene (tDBLG) under the influence of external gate voltage and intrinsic spin-orbit coupling (SOC) for both AB-AB and AB-BA stacking configurations. Utilizing a low-energy continuum model, we investigate the band structure and perform a comprehensive topological characterization of the system by analysing the direct band gap closing as well as various Chern numbers. In the absence of SOC, the tDBLG exhibits characteristics of a valley Hall insulator. However, in the presence of SOC, we observe a transition to a quantum spin Hall insulator state and band topology emerges in the parameter spaces of non-topological regime without SOC. Furthermore, we conduct a comparative analysis between untwisted double bilayer graphene and tDBLG to assess the impact of twisting on the system's properties. Our findings reveal the construction of topological phase diagrams that showcase distinct phases arising from changes in the twist angle compared to the untwisted case. These phase diagrams provide valuable insights into the diverse topological phases achievable in tDBLG with SOC. Our findings contribute to the understanding of the interplay between small twist angle, SOC, and external electric field on the topological band properties of twisted multilayer graphene systems.

Title: Prediction and identification of point defect fingerprints in X-ray photoelectron spectra of TiN$_x$ with 1.18 $\le x \le$ 1.37
Authors: Pavel Ondračka, Pauline Kümmerl, Marcus Hans, Stanislav Mráz, Daniel Primetzhofer, David Holec, Petr Vašina, Jochen M. Schneider
Abstract: We investigate the effect of selected N and Ti point defects in $B$1 TiN on N\,1s and Ti\,2p$_{3/2}$ binding energies (BE) by experiments and {\it ab initio} calculations. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements of TiN$_x$ films with 1.18 $\le x \le$ 1.37 reveal additional N\,1s spectral components at lower binding energies. {\it Ab initio} calculations predict that these components are caused by either Ti vacancies, which induce a N\,1s BE shift of -0.54\,eV in its first N neighbors, and/or N tetrahedral interstitials, which have their N\,1s BE shifted by -1.18\,eV and shift the BE of their first N neighbors by -0.53\,eV. However, based on {\it ab initio} data the tetrahedral N interstitial is estimated to be unstable at room temperature. We, therefore, unambiguously attribute the N\,1s spectral components at lower BE in Ti-deficient TiN$_x$ thin films to the presence of Ti vacancies. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the vacancy concentration in Al-capped Ti-deficient TiN$_x$ can be quantified with the here proposed correlative method based on measured and predicted BE data. Our work highlights the potential of {\it ab initio}-guided XPS measurements for detecting and quantifying point defects in $B$1 TiN$_x$.

Title: Peculiar magnetic and magneto-transport properties in a non-centrosymmetric self-intercalated van der Waals ferromagnet Cr5Te8
Authors: Banik Rai, Sandip Kumar Kuila, Rana Saha, Sankalpa Hazra, Chandan De, Jyotirmoy Sau, Venkatraman Gopalan, Partha Pratim Jana, Stuart S. P. Parkin, Nitesh Kumar
Abstract: Trigonal Cr$_5$Te$_8$, a self-intercalated van der Waals ferromagnet with an out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy, has long been known to crystallize in a centrosymmetric structure. However, optical second harmonic generation experiments, together with comprehensive structural analysis, indicate that this compound rather adopts a non-centrosymmetric structure. Lorentz transmission electron microscopy reveals the presence of Néel-type skyrmions, consistent with its non-centrosymmetric structure. A large anomalous Hall conductivity of 102 ohm$^{-1}$cm$^{-1}$ at low temperature stems from intrinsic origin, which is larger than any previously reported values in the bulk Cr-Te system. Notably, spontaneous topological Hall resistivity arising from the skyrmionic phase has been observed. Our findings not only elucidate the unique magnetic and magneto-transport properties of non-centrosymmetric trigonal Cr$_5$Te$_8$, but also open new avenues for investigating the effects of broken inversion symmetry on material properties and their potential applications.

Title: Synthesis of layered gold tellurides AuSbTe and Au$_2$Te$_3$ and their semiconducting and metallic behavior
Authors: Emma A. Pappas, Rong Zhang, Cheng Peng, Robert T. Busch, Jian-Min Zuo, Thomas P. Devereaux, Daniel P. Shoemaker
Abstract: Previous studies on natural samples of pampaloite (AuSbTe) revealed the crystal structure of a potentially cleavable and/or exfoliable material, while studies on natural and synthetic montbrayite (Sb-containing Au$_2$Te$_3$) claimed various chemical compositions for this low symmetry compound. Few investigations of synthetic samples have been reported for both materials, leaving much of their chemical, thermal and electronic characteristics unknown. Here, we investigate the stability, electronic properties and synthesis of the gold antimony tellurides AuSbTe and Au$_{1.9}$Sb$_{0.46}$Te$_{2.64}$ (montbrayite). Differential thermal analysis and $\textit{in situ}$ powder x-ray diffraction revealed that AuSbTe is incongruently melting, while Au$_{1.9}$Sb$_{0.46}$Te$_{2.64}$ is congruently melting. Calculations of the band structures and four-point resistivity measurements showed that AuSbTe is a semiconductor and Au$_{1.9}$Sb$_{0.46}$Te$_{2.64}$ a metal. Various synthesis attempts confirmed the limited stable chemical composition of Au$_{1.9}$Sb$_{0.46}$Te$_{2.64}$, identified successful methods to synthesize both compounds, and highlighted the challenges associated with single crystal synthesis of AuSbTe.

Title: Simulating Spin Dynamics of Supersolid States in a Quantum Ising Magnet
Authors: Yi Xu, Juraj Hasik, Boris Ponsioen, Andriy H. Nevidomskyy
Abstract: Motivated by a recent experimental study on the quantum Ising magnet $\text{K}_2\text{Co}(\text{SeO}_3)_2$ that presented spectroscopic evidence of zero-field supersolidity (Chen et al., arXiv:2402.15869), we simulate the excitation spectrum of the corresponding microscopic $XXZ$ model for the compound, using the recently developed excitation ansatz for infinite projected entangled-pair states. We map out the ground state phase diagram and compute the dynamical spin structure factors across a range of magnetic field strengths, focusing especially on the two supersolid phases found near zero and saturation fields. Our simulated excitation spectra for the zero-field supersolid "Y" phase are in excellent agreement with the experimental data - recovering the low-energy branches and integer quantized excited energy levels $\omega_n=nJ_{zz}$. Furthermore, we demonstrate the nonlocal multi-spin-flip features for modes at $\omega_2$, indicative of their multi-magnon nature. Additionally, we identify characteristics of the high-field supersolid "$\Psi$" phase in the simulated spectra, which should be compared with future experimental results.

Title: (H,Li)$_{6}$Ru$_{2}$O$_{6}$ : a possible zero-field Ru$^{3+}$-based Kitaev Quantum Spin Liquid
Authors: Sanjay Bachhar, M. Baenitz, Hubertus Luetkens, John Wilkinson, Sumiran Pujari, A.V. Mahajan
Abstract: We report the synthesis and properties of (H,Li)$_{6}$Ru$_{2}$O$_{6}$, which is shown to be a $J_{\text{eff}}=\frac{1}{2}$ system made out of Ru$^{3+}$ moments in a honeycomb geometry. Bulk magnetization, heat capacity, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and muon spin relaxation ($\mu$SR) rule out the presence of static moments or any spin glass phase down to 500 mK. All techniques suggest a crossover to a liquid-like state below about 40 K. The $^{7}$Li nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) shift data suggest a non-zero $T$-independent spin susceptibility at low $T$. In zero field, $C_m/T$ shows $T^{-1}$ divergence which is consistent with vacancy-induced effects on low-energy excitations of the pristine Kitaev spin liquid. With field, power-law variations in the $^{7}$Li NMR spin-lattice relaxation rate 1/T$_{1}$ and magnetic heat capacity $C_{m}$ show quantitatively new scaling behaviors. A two-step entropy release in heat capacity is also observed putatively from $Z_{2}$ flux (low-$T$ step) and itinerant Majorana fermions (high-$T$ step). Based on these findings, we propose that (H,Li)$_{6}$Ru$_{2}$O$_{6}$ realizes a Kitaev spin liquid with no evidence of inherent magnetic ordering in zero field unlike $\alpha$-RuCl$_{3}$ where approximately $8$ Tesla field is required to suppress magnetic order.

Title: Data-driven discovery of self-similarity using neural networks
Authors: Ryota Watanabe, Takanori Ishii, Yuji Hirono, Hirokazu Maruoka
Abstract: Finding self-similarity is a key step for understanding the governing law behind complex physical phenomena. Traditional methods for identifying self-similarity often rely on specific models, which can introduce significant bias. In this paper, we present a novel neural network-based approach that discovers self-similarity directly from observed data, without presupposing any models. The presence of self-similar solutions in a physical problem signals that the governing law contains a function whose arguments are given by power-law monomials of physical parameters, which are characterized by power-law exponents. The basic idea is to enforce such particular forms structurally in a neural network in a parametrized way. We train the neural network model using the observed data, and when the training is successful, we can extract the power exponents that characterize scale-transformation symmetries of the physical problem. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with both synthetic and experimental data, validating its potential as a robust, model-independent tool for exploring self-similarity in complex systems.

Title: Altermagnetism in orthorhombic $Pnma$ structure through group theory and DFT calculations
Authors: Suman Rooj, Sugandha Saxena, Nirmal Ganguli
Abstract: Antiferromagnetism, initially considered interesting but useless, recently emerged as one of the most promising magnetic phases for technology. Recently, a low symmetry antiferromagnetic phase, known as altermagnetic phase, have been discovered, where no time reversal ($\mathcal{T}$) symmetry is observed in spite of a vanishing net magnetization, leading to non-degenerate bands from the opposite magnetic sublattices. In this work, we consider two representatives of orthorhombic $Pnma$ space group, namely, BiFeO$_3$ and CaMnO$_3$ and find altermagnetic lowest energy phase in both from our density functional theory calculations. We find a substantial spin-splitting in both systems along a high-symmetry path in the Brillouin zone without considering the spin-orbit interaction (SOI). Detailed features of the band dispersion obtained from our calculation confirm the lifting of sublattice spin degeneracy only in the $k_y$-$k_z$ plane while preserving the spin degeneracy in the other planes of the Brillouin zone. We provide a comprehensive symmetry analysis based on the magnetic space group (MSG) to explain our DFT findings and an insightful symmetry-allowed model Hamiltonian, which qualitatively agrees with our results. Additionally, we extend our symmetry analysis to encompass two other potential MSGs within the $Pnma$ space group that may host the spin-splitting phenomenon without considering SOI and the likely form of their Hamiltonian. These detailed studies pave the way for a deeper understanding of the spin-splitting phenomena within the $Pnma$ space group, offering insights into the intricate interplay between symmetry and electronic as well as magnetic properties.

Title: Pushing an Altermagnet to the Ultimate 2D Limit: Evidence of Symmetry Breaking in Monolayers of GdAlSi
Authors: Oleg E. Parfenov, Dmitry V. Averyanov, Ivan S. Sokolov, Alexey N. Mihalyuk, Oleg A. Kondratev, Alexander N. Taldenkov, Andrey M. Tokmachev, Vyacheslav G. Storchak
Abstract: Altermagnets have emerged as a class of materials combining certain ferromagnetic properties with zero net magnetization. This combination is highly promising for spintronics, especially if a material can be brought to a nanoscale size. However, experimental studies of the 2D limit of altermagnets and evolution of their properties with thickness are lacking. Here, we study epitaxial films on silicon of the Weyl altermagnet GdAlSi ranging from more than a hundred unit cells to a single unit cell. The films are synthesized by molecular beam epitaxy and, expectedly, do not show any discernible net magnetic moments. Electron transport studies reveal a remarkable transformation of the electron state with the film thickness. Thick films exhibit negative longitudinal magnetoresistance associated with the chiral anomaly but do not demonstrate altermagnetic properties in electron transport due to symmetry restrictions. In ultrathin films, a spontaneous anomalous Hall effect manifests itself, indicating a non-relativistic spin splitting in the electronic structure. The transformation is associated with crystal symmetry breaking accompanying the 3D-to-2D crossover. The work highlights the role of dimensionality in altermagnetism and provides a platform for studies of altermagnets aiming at ultra-compact spintronics.

Title: Thermal Hall Effect of Magnons from Many-Body Skew Scattering
Authors: Dimos Chatzichrysafis, Alexander Mook
Abstract: We present a theory of magnonic thermal Hall transport driven by many-body skew scattering. In field-polarized chiral magnets, the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction induces three-magnon interactions that violate time-reversal symmetry and interfere with the four-magnon scattering, thereby breaking microscopic detailed balance and causing thermal Hall currents. This mechanism operates without disorder or Berry curvature and is intrinsic to interacting spin systems. We argue that it can be as significant as the band-geometric anomalous velocity, highlighting the importance of magnon interactions in thermal Hall physics.

Title: Unconventional p-wave and finite-momentum superconductivity induced by altermagnetism through the formation of Bogoliubov Fermi surface
Authors: SeungBeom Hong, Moon Jip Park, Kyoung-Min Kim
Abstract: Altermagnet is an exotic class of magnetic materials wherein the Fermi surface exhibits a momentum-dependent spin-splitting while maintaining a net zero magnetization. Previous studies have shown that this distinctive spin-splitting can induce chiral p-wave superconductors or Fulde-Ferrell (FF) superconducting states carrying finite momentum. However, the underlying mechanisms of such unconventional superconductivities remain elusive. Here, we propose that the formation of the Bogoliubov Fermi surface (BFS) through the exchange field can play a significant role in such phenomena. Through a systematic self-consistent mean-field analysis on the extended attractive Hubbard model combined with the d-wave spin-splitting induced by the exchange field, as observed in RuO2, we demonstrate that the formation of the BFS suppresses conventional spin-singlet superconducting states with s-wave characteristics. In contrast, the chiral p-wave state maintains a fully gapped spectrum without the Fermi surface, thereby becoming the ground state in the strong field regime. In the intermediate regime, we find that the FF state becomes the predominant state through the optimization of available channels for Cooper pairing. Moreover, we illustrate how the prevalence of the chiral p-wave and FF states over the s-wave state changes under the variation of the field strength or chemical potential. Our findings provide valuable insights into potential pathways for realizing sought-after topological p-wave superconductivity and finite momentum pairing facilitated by altermagnetism.

Title: Explosive neural networks via higher-order interactions in curved statistical manifolds
Authors: Miguel Aguilera, Pablo A. Morales, Fernando E. Rosas, Hideaki Shimazaki
Abstract: Higher-order interactions underlie complex phenomena in systems such as biological and artificial neural networks, but their study is challenging due to the scarcity of tractable models. By leveraging a generalisation of the maximum entropy principle, here we introduce curved neural networks as a class of prototypical models with a limited number of parameters that are particularly well-suited for studying higher-order phenomena. Through exact mean-field descriptions, we show that these curved neural networks implement a self-regulating annealing process that can accelerate memory retrieval, leading to explosive order-disorder phase transitions with multi-stability and hysteresis effects. Moreover, by analytically exploring their memory-retrieval capacity using the replica trick near ferromagnetic and spin-glass phase boundaries, we demonstrate that these networks can enhance memory capacity and robustness of retrieval over classical associative-memory networks. Overall, the proposed framework provides parsimonious models amenable to analytical study, revealing novel higher-order phenomena in complex networks.

Title: Density-Dependent Gauge Field with Raman Lattices
Authors: Xiang-Can Cheng, Zong-Yao Wang, Jinyi Zhang, Shuai Chen, Xiaotian Nie
Abstract: The study of the gauge field is an everlasting topic in modern physics. Spin-orbit coupling is a powerful tool in ultracold atomic systems, resulting in an artificial gauge field that can be easily manipulated and observed in a tabletop environment. Combining optical Raman lattices and atom-atom interaction, the artificial gauge field can be made density-dependent. In this work, we propose a straightforward way to engineer one-dimensional density-dependent gauge field in a Bose-Hubbard model in spin-orbit coupled Raman lattices. Next, we study the model from two perspectives: few-body quantum walk dynamics and many-body ground state. In the first perspective, we show that large spin-flipped tunneling can lead to a deep two-body bound state. In the second perspective, mean-field and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations consistently reveal three different phases, i.e. the Mott insulator phase, the superfluid phase, and the magnetic superfluid phase. Finally, we discuss the experimental protocol with Raman lattices based on existing experimental platforms.

Title: Topological Charge Quadrupole Protected by Spin-Orbit U(1) Quasi-Symmetry in Antiferromagnet NdBiPt
Authors: Ao Zhang, Xiaobing Chen, Jiayu Li, Pengfei Liu, Yuntian Liu, Qihang Liu
Abstract: The interplay of symmetry and topology in crystal solids has given rise to various elementary excitations as quasiparticles. Among these, those with significant Berry-phase-related transport responses are of particular interest. Here, we predict a new type of quasiparticle called topological charge quadruple (TCQ), which is analogous to a charge quadrupole but consists of two closely-packed pairs of Weyl points in momentum space, specifically in a half-Heusler antiferromagnet NdBiPt. Interestingly, the TCQ is protected by the spin-orbit $U(1)$ quasi-symmetry, rather than any exact crystallographic symmetries. This quasi-symmetry restricts the energy splitting induced by symmetry-lowering perturbations to a second-order effect. Furthermore, the closely located Berry curvature sources and sinks in the TCQ lead to a large Berry curvature dipole, resulting in a significant nonlinear Hall effect. Our work opens an avenue for designing novel quasiparticles using quasi-symmetries and developing materials with enhanced nonlinear responses.

Title: Comparison of renormalized interactions using one-dimensional few-body systems as a testbed
Authors: Fabian Brauneis, Hans-Werner Hammer, Stephanie M. Reimann, Artem G. Volosniev
Abstract: Even though the one-dimensional contact interaction requires no regularization, renormalization methods have been shown to improve the convergence of numerical ab initio calculations considerably. In this work, we compare and contrast these methods: `the running coupling constant' where the two-body ground state energy is used as a renormalization condition, and two effective interaction approaches that include information about the ground as well as excited states. In particular, we calculate the energies and densities of few-fermion systems in a harmonic oscillator with the configuration interaction method, and compare the results based upon renormalized and bare interactions. We find that the use of the running coupling constant instead of the bare interaction improves convergence significantly. A comparison with an effective interaction, which is designed to reproduce the relative part of the energy spectrum of two particles, showed a similar improvement. The effective interaction provides an additional improvement if the center-of-mass excitations are included in the construction. Finally, we discuss the transformation of observables alongside the renormalization of the potential, and demonstrate that this might be an essential ingredient for accurate numerical calculations.

Title: Local order metrics for many-particle systems across length scales
Authors: Charles Emmett Maher, Salvatore Torquato
Abstract: Formulating order metrics that sensitively quantify the degree of order/disorder in many-particle systems in $d$-dimensional Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^d$ across length scales is an outstanding challenge in physics, chemistry, and materials science. Since an infinite set of $n$-particle correlation functions is required to fully characterize a system, one must settle for a reduced set of structural information, in practice. We initiate a program to use the local number variance $\sigma_N^2(R)$ associated with a spherical sampling window of radius $R$ (which encodes pair correlations) and an integral measure derived from it $\Sigma_N(R_i,R_j)$ that depends on two specified radial distances $R_i$ and $R_j$. Across the first three space dimensions ($d = 1,2,3$), we find these metrics can sensitively describe and categorize the degree of order/disorder of 41 different models of antihyperuniform, nonhyperuniform, disordered hyperuniform, and ordered hyperuniform many-particle systems at a specified length scale $R$. Using our local variance metrics, we demonstrate the importance of assessing order/disorder with respect to a specific value of $R$. These local order metrics could also aid in the inverse design of structures with prescribed length-scale-specific degrees of order/disorder that yield desired physical properties. In future work, it would be fruitful to explore the use of higher-order moments of the number of points within a spherical window of radius $R$ [S. Torquato {\it et al}., Phys. Rev. X, \textbf{11}, 021028 (2021)] to devise even more sensitive order metrics.

Title: Surface Patterns Shaped by Additives in Crystals
Authors: M. A. Chabowska, M. A. Załuska-Kotur
Abstract: One technique for creating semiconductor crystals with new, desired properties involves replacing some atoms in the crystal lattice with additives - atoms of a different type. This substitution not only alters the bulk properties of the crystal but also affects the patterns formed on its surface. A surface that is smooth and regular in a uniform crystal can become bunched or meandered under the same growth conditions if some atoms are replaced by additives. The Vicinal Cellular Automaton (VicCA) model is used to study this behavior, analyzing the mechanism of pattern formation when additives are introduced into the system. It has also been shown that the newly formed structures resulting from the presence of additives can be smoothed by applying successive layers of a homogeneous composition on top for a sufficiently long time. Additives can also act as smoothing agents for bunched or meandered surface patterns that develop in a homogeneous crystal. However, their effectiveness diminishes for spatially extended patterns such as nanowires. Typically, when homogeneous crystal layers are applied to spatial structures, the resulting surface is not entirely smoothed but instead transforms into a distinct shape. This phenomenon is demonstrated, and its underlying mechanism is thoroughly analyzed.

Title: Successive topological phase transitions in two distinct spin-flop phases on the honeycomb lattice
Authors: Xudong Li, Jize Zhao, Jinbin Li, Qiang Luo
Abstract: The Kitaev magnets with bond-dependent interactions have garnered considerable attention in recent years for their ability to harbor exotic phases and nontrivial excitations. The topological magnons, which are indicated by nonzero Chern number that can enhance the thermal Hall conductivity, are proposed to partially explain thermal Hall measurements in real materials. Hitherto, topological magnons have been extensively explored when the magnetic field is normal to the honeycomb plane, but their topological characteristics are less studied in the presence of in-plane magnetic field. Here, we study two distinct in-plane field induced spin-flop phases in the $\Gamma$-$\Gamma'$ model, both of which are off-diagonal couplings that have intimate relation to the Kitaev interaction. The two spin-flop phases are distinguished by their out-of-plane spin components which can be either antiparallel or parallel, thus dubbing antiferromagnetic (AFM) or ferromagnetic (FM) spin-flop phases, respectively. We map out topological phase diagrams for both phases, revealing a rich pattern of the Chern number over exchange parameters and magnetic field. We analytically calculate the boundaries of topological phase transitions when the magnetic field is along the $a$ and $b$ directions. We find that the thermal Hall conductivity and its derivative display contrasting behaviors when crossing different topological phase transitions. The striking difference of the two phases lies in that when the magnetic field is along the $b$ direction, topological magnons are totally absent in the AFM spin-flop phase, while they can survive in the FM analogue in certain parameter regions.

Title: Confinement and false vacuum decay on the Potts quantum spin chain
Authors: Octavio Pomponio, Anna Krasznai, Gábor Takács
Abstract: We consider non-equilibrium dynamics after quantum quenches in the mixed-field three-state Potts quantum chain in the ferromagnetic regime. Compared to the analogous setting for the Ising spin chain, the Potts model has a much richer phenomenology, which originates partly from baryonic excitations in the spectrum and partly from the various possible relative alignments of the initial magnetisation and the longitudinal field. We obtain the excitation spectrum by combining semi-classical approximation and exact diagonalisation, and we use the results to explain the various dynamical behaviours we observe. Besides recovering dynamical confinement, as well as Wannier-Stark localisation due to Bloch oscillations similar to the Ising chain, a novel feature is the presence of baryonic excitations in the quench spectroscopy. In addition, when the initial magnetisation and the longitudinal field are misaligned, both confinement and Bloch oscillations only result in partial localisation, with some correlations retaining an unsuppressed light-cone behaviour together with a corresponding growth of entanglement entropy.

Title: Phases of three-dimensional $d$-wave superconductors with two attractive interactions
Authors: Majid Kheirkhah, Igor F. Herbut
Abstract: Three-dimensional $d$-wave ($j=2$) superconducting state may result from Cooper pairing in channels with different angular momenta and spin, such as $(l=0, s=2)$ or $(l=2, s=0)$. We consider spin-3/2 Luttinger fermions in the limit of small spin-orbit coupling parameter and with weak attractive interactions in both of these channels, and demonstrate that the stable $d$-wave superconducting phase of the system below critical temperature depends critically on the ratio of two interactions. When a weak inversion-breaking term in the kinetic energy is included, all three of the real, ferromagnetic, and cyclic phases can be realized within a narrow range around unit ratio. The result shows how models of multicomponent superconductors can be surprisingly sensitive to precise values of some of its parameters and display radically different superconducting ground states with their variation.

Title: Mechanisms of electrostatic interactions between two charged dielectric spheres inside a polarizable medium: An effective-dipole analysis
Authors: Yanyu Duan, Zecheng Gan, Ho-Kei Chan
Abstract: The mechanisms of electrostatic interactions between two charged dielectric spheres inside a polarizable medium have been investigated, in terms of hypothetical effective dipoles that depict how the positive and negative charge in each particle are separated. Our findings, which revealed that it is possible for polarization-induced opposite-charge repulsion to occur at short interparticle separations if the dielectric constant of the medium is greater than the dielectric constants of both spheres, provide insights into the physics of charge separation in each sphere and of polarization in the medium behind such counterintuitive behaviour.

Title: Evolution and Instability of Bogoliubov Fermi Surfaces under Zeeman Field
Authors: Tatsuaki Mori, Hiroshi Watanabe, Hiroaki Ikeda
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the evolution and instability of the Bogoliubov Fermi surface (BFS) in the spherical $j=3/2$ model under a Zeeman field. The applied field induces a pronounced expansion in the BFS with $j_z = \pm 3/2$ component. Such behavior can be detected by spectroscopic techniques such as angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). Interestingly, the Pauli susceptibility exhibits behavior that appears discontinuous just below the transition temperature at zero field, even though it is a second-order transition. This is due to spontaneous magnetization. Furthermore, the analysis of the bogolon correlations in the superconducting phase suggests the possibility of the chiral $p$- or $f$-wave bogolon pairing instabilities rather than the Pomeranchuk instability. These chiral states coexist with the chiral $d$-wave superconducting state, spontaneously break inversion symmetry, and lead to the disappearance of the torus-shaped BFS structure.

Title: Dissipation enables robust extensive scaling of multipartite correlations
Authors: Krzysztof Ptaszynski, Massimiliano Esposito
Abstract: We investigate the multipartite mutual information between $N$ discrete-state stochastic units interacting in a network that is invariant under unit permutations. We show that when the system relaxes to fixed point attractors, multipartite correlations in the stationary state either do not scale extensively with $N$, or the extensive scaling is not robust to arbitrarily small perturbations of certain system parameters. In particular, robust extensive scaling cannot occur in thermodynamic equilibrium. In contrast, mutual information scales extensively when the system relaxes to time-dependent attractors (e.g., limit cycles), which can occur only far from equilibrium. This demonstrates the essential role of dissipation in the generation and maintenance of multipartite correlations. We illustrate our theory with the nonequilibrium Potts model.

Title: Rectification from band gap oscillation
Authors: Anwesha Chattopadhyay
Abstract: We consider a chain of divalent atoms with two electronic orbitals per atom, whose length is periodically oscillating with time in response to an external oscillating pressure source. We introduce both inter-orbital and intra-orbital hopping between neighboring atoms which as a consequence of the oscillating lattice separation, are also periodically oscillating in time. Within the tight binding approximation and in the limit of very small inter-orbital hopping, we get two bands separated by an indirect band gap which itself oscillates due to the oscillating chain length. Under suitable choice of hopping parameters (about which it oscillates) and orbital energies, we show that there can be a periodic metal-insulator transition in the half-filled system. If the frequency of the metal-insulator transition resonates with an externally applied alternating electric field, it can give rise to the phenomena of half-wave rectification wherein in one half of the cycle the system is metallic and conducting, where as in the other half of the cycle it is insulating and non-conducting. We also observe that the phenomena remains robust even in the presence of small to intermediate values of onsite electron-electron repulsive interactions.

Title: Tuning the lasing threshold of quantum well exciton-polaritons under a magnetic field in Faraday geometry: a theoretical study
Authors: Le Tri Dat, Nguyen Dung Chinh, Vinh N.T. Pham, Vo Quoc Phong, Nguyen Duy Vy
Abstract: Polariton lasing is a promising phenomenon with potential applications in next-generation lasers that operate without the need for population inversion. Applying a perpendicular magnetic field to a quantum well (QW) significantly alters the properties of exciton-polaritons. In this theoretical study, we investigate how the lasing threshold of QW exciton-polaritons depends on the magnetic field. By modifying the exciton's effective mass and Rabi splitting, the magnetic field induces notable changes in the relaxation kinetics, which directly affect the lasing threshold. For low-energy pumping, an increase in the magnetic field delays the lasing threshold, while for high-energy pumping, the threshold is reached at much lower pump intensities. Furthermore, increasing both the pump energy and the magnetic field enhances relaxation efficiency, leading to a substantially larger number of condensed polaritons. Our result gives insights into the modulation of exciton-polariton condensation through magnetic fields, with potential implications for the design of low-threshold polariton lasers.

Title: Formulation of entropy through work by Carnot machine and direct derivation of law of entropy non-decrease from Kelvin principle
Authors: Yuki Izumida
Abstract: We derive the law of entropy non-decrease directly from the Kelvin principle for simple and compound systems without using Clausius inequality. A key of the derivation is a formulation of entropy in terms of work by a Carnot machine operating between a system and a single heat reservoir, which is equivalent to Clausius entropy based on heat and Gyftopoulos-Beretta entropy based on work.

Title: Step meandering: The balance between the potential well and the Ehrlich-Schwoebel barrier
Authors: Marta A. Chabowska, Hristina Popova, Magdalena A. Załuska-Kotur
Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive and innovative exploration of how the surface potential energy landscape influences meander formation. Using the Vicinal Cellular Automaton model, which distinguishes surface diffusion from adatom incorporation into the crystal, the research delves into various factors affecting surface pattern dynamics. By isolating the diffusion process within a defined energy potential, the study provides a detailed analysis of how changes in the potential energy well and the barrier at the top of the step contribute to meander formation. Remarkably, the results reveal that the mere presence of a potential well at the step's bottom is sufficient to induce meandering. The role of the Ehrlich-Schwoebel barrier on formed meanders is further investigated, and a mechanism for meander formation is proposed to clarify this process. The derived relation successfully reflects the wavelength of the meandered patterns observed in the simulations, emphasizing its reliability. Overall, the results illustrate the crucial influence of the surface energy potential's shape in driving surface pattern formation.

Title: Time-resolved diamond magnetic microscopy of superparamagnetic iron-oxide nanoparticles
Authors: B. A. Richards, N. Ristoff, J. Smits, A. Jeronimo Perez, I. Fescenko, M. D. Aiello, F. Hubert, Y. Silani, N. Mosavian, M. Saleh Ziabari, A. Berzins, J. T. Damron, P. Kehayias, D. Egbebunmi, J. E. Shield, D. L. Huber, A. M. Mounce, M. P. Lilly, T. Karaulanov, A. Jarmola, A. Laraoui, V. M. Acosta
Abstract: Superparamagnetic iron-oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) are promising probes for biomedical imaging, but the heterogeneity of their magnetic properties is difficult to characterize with existing methods. Here, we perform widefield imaging of the stray magnetic fields produced by hundreds of isolated ~30-nm SPIONs using a magnetic microscope based on nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond. By analyzing the SPION magnetic field patterns as a function of applied magnetic field, we observe substantial field-dependent transverse magnetization components that are typically obscured with ensemble characterization methods. We find negligible hysteresis in each of the three magnetization components for nearly all SPIONs in our sample. Most SPIONs exhibit a sharp Langevin saturation curve, enumerated by a characteristic polarizing applied field, B_c. The B_c distribution is highly asymmetric, with a standard deviation (1.4 mT) that is larger than the median (0.6 mT). Using time-resolved magnetic microscopy, we directly record SPION Néel relaxation, after switching off a 31 mT applied field, with a temporal resolution of ~60 ms that is limited by the ring-down time of the electromagnet coils. For small bias fields B_{hold}=1.5-3.5 mT, we observe a broad range of SPION Néel relaxation times--from milliseconds to seconds--that are consistent with an exponential dependence on B_{hold}. Our time-resolved diamond magnetic microscopy study reveals rich SPION sample heterogeneity and may be extended to other fundamental studies of nanomagnetism.

Title: Stationary and transient correlations in driven electrolytes
Authors: Haggai Bonneau, Vincent Démery, Elie Raphaël
Abstract: Particle-particle correlation functions in ionic systems control many of their macroscopic properties. In this work, we use stochastic density functional theory to compute these correlations, and then we analyze their long-range behavior. In particular, we study the system's response to a rapid change (quench) in the external electric field. We show that the correlation functions relax diffusively toward the non-equilibrium stationary state and that in a stationary state, they present a universal conical shape. This shape distinguishes this system from systems with short-range interactions, where the correlations have a parabolic shape. We relate this temporal evolution of the correlations to the algebraic relaxation of the total charge current reported previously.

Title: Molecular tuning of excitons in four-atom-thick hybrid bilayer crystals
Authors: Tomojit Chowdhury, Aurélie Champagne, Patrick Knüppel, Zehra Naqvi, Mengyu Gao, Nathan Guisinger, Kin Fai Mak, Jeffrey B. Neaton, Jiwoong Park
Abstract: Bilayer crystals, formed by stacking monolayers of two-dimensional (2D) crystals, create interlayer potentials that govern excitonic phenomena but are constrained by their fixed covalent lattices. Replacing one layer with an atomically thin molecular crystal overcomes this limitation, as precise control of functional groups enables tunable 2D molecular lattices and, consequently, electronic structures. Here, we report molecular tuning of lattices and excitons in four-atom-thick hybrid bilayer crystals (HBCs), synthesized as monolayers of perylene-based molecular and transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) single crystals. In HBCs, we observe an anisotropic photoluminescence signal exhibiting characteristics of both molecular and TMD excitons, directly tuned by molecular geometry and HBC composition. Ab initio calculations reveal that this anisotropic emission arises from hybrid excitons, which inherit properties from both layers through a hybridized bilayer band structure. Our work establishes a synthetically derived, molecule-based 2D quantum materials platform with the potential for engineering interlayer potentials.

Title: Effect of molar volume of diffusing elements and cross terms of Onsager formalism (vacancy wind effect) on estimated diffusion coefficients in ternary and multicomponent solid solutions
Authors: Aloke Paul
Abstract: The correlation between intrinsic and tracer diffusion coefficients considering the molar volume of the diffusing elements and cross phenomenological constants of Onsager contributing to the vacancy wind effect in ternary and multicomponent systems. Manning established this correlation assuming constant molar volume. The difference in data calculated considering a constant molar volume and neglecting the vacancy wind effect, which is mainly practised until today, is compared with the data considering the molar volume of diffusing elements and vacancy wind effect in NiCoFeCr and an imaginary quaternary multi-principal element system. This indicates a significant error in estimated data when considering a constant molar volume if the molar volumes of the diffusing elements are reasonably different. Therefore, the outcome of this study is expected to bring a significant change in diffusion analysis in ternary and multicomponent systems.

Title: Emerging Microelectronic Materials by Design: Navigating Combinatorial Design Space with Scarce and Dispersed Data
Authors: Hengrui Zhang, Alexandru B. Georgescu, Suraj Yerramilli, Christopher Karpovich, Daniel W. Apley, Elsa A. Olivetti, James M. Rondinelli, Wei Chen
Abstract: The increasing demands of sustainable energy, electronics, and biomedical applications call for next-generation functional materials with unprecedented properties. Of particular interest are emerging materials that display exceptional physical properties, making them promising candidates in energy-efficient microelectronic devices. As the conventional Edisonian approach becomes significantly outpaced by growing societal needs, emerging computational modeling and machine learning (ML) methods are employed for the rational design of materials. However, the complex physical mechanisms, cost of first-principles calculations, and the dispersity and scarcity of data pose challenges to both physics-based and data-driven materials modeling. Moreover, the combinatorial composition-structure design space is high-dimensional and often disjoint, making design optimization nontrivial. In this Account, we review a team effort toward establishing a framework that integrates data-driven and physics-based methods to address these challenges and accelerate materials design. We begin by presenting our integrated materials design framework and its three components in a general context. We then provide an example of applying this materials design framework to metal-insulator transition (MIT) materials, a specific type of emerging materials with practical importance in next-generation memory technologies. We identify multiple new materials which may display this property and propose pathways for their synthesis. Finally, we identify some outstanding challenges in data-driven materials design, such as materials data quality issues and property-performance mismatch. We seek to raise awareness of these overlooked issues hindering materials design, thus stimulating efforts toward developing methods to mitigate the gaps.

Title: Nonequilibrium Response Theory: From Precision Limits to Strong Perturbation
Authors: Ruicheng Bao, Shiling Liang
Abstract: Understanding the response of nonequilibrium systems to external perturbations remains a fundamental challenge in statistical physics. Here, we prove a novel universal bound stating that the response precision for state observable is fundamentally constrained to $1/2$ under single edge or vertex perturbations, independent of system size. Furthermore, we develop exact relations connecting responses to perturbations of arbitrary strengths, extending nonequilibrium response theory beyond the weak-perturbation regime. Through response equalities we also provide a novel physical interpretation of response sensitivity and recovers bounds previously obtained using graph-theoretical methods and extensive linear algebra. Our results provide a general mathematical framework applicable across diverse nonequilibrium systems and offer design principles for optimal sensing and information processing in biochemical systems.

Title: Chiral electronic network within skyrmionic lattice on topological insulator surfaces
Authors: Matteo Wilczak, Dmitry K. Efimkin, Victor Gurarie
Abstract: We consider a proximity effect between Dirac surface states of a topological insulator and the skyrmion phase of an insulating magnet. A single skyrmion results in the surface states having a chiral gapless mode confined to the perimeter of the skyrmion. For the lattice of skyrmions, the tunneling coupling between confined states leads to the formation of low energy bands delocalized across the whole system. We show that the structure of these bands can be investigated with the help of the phenomenological chiral network model with a kagome lattice geometry. While the network model by itself can be in a chiral Floquet phase unattainable without external periodic driving, we show how to use a procedure known as band reconstruction to obtain the low energy bands of the electrons on the surface of the topological insulator for which there is no external driving. We conclude that band reconstruction is essential for the broad class of network models recently introduced to describe the electronic properties of different nanostructures.

Title: Nonlinear Hall effect driven by spin-charge-coupled motive force
Authors: Kohei Hattori, Hikaru Watanabe, Ryotaro Arita
Abstract: Parity-time-reversal symmetric ($\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric) magnets have garnered much attention due to their spin-charge coupled dynamics enriched by the parity-symmetry breaking. By real-time simulations, we study how localized spin dynamics can affect the nonlinear Hall effect in $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric magnets. To identify the leading-order term, we derive analytical expressions for the second-order optical response and classify the contributions by considering their transformation properties under $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry. Notably, our results reveal that the sizable contribution is attributed to the mixed dipole effect, which is analogous to the Berry curvature dipole term.

Title: Magnetism in symmetry-enforced nodal-line semimetals
Authors: Andressa R. Medeiros-Silva, Mariana Malard, Rodrigo G. Pereira, Thereza Paiva
Abstract: Nodal-line semimetals (NLSMs) harbor a variety of novel physical properties owing to the particularities of the band degeneracies that characterize the spectrum of these materials. In symmetry-enforced NLSMs, band degeneracies, being imposed by symmetries, are robust to arbitrarily strong perturbations that preserve the symmetries. We investigate the effects of electron-electron interactions on a recently proposed vacancy-engineered NLSM known as holey graphene. Using mean-field calculations and quantum Monte Carlo simulation, we show that the Hubbard model on the depleted holey-graphene lattice at half-filling exhibits a transition from a NLSM to an insulating antiferromagnetic phase for an arbitrarily weak repulsive interaction $U$. In contrast to the semi-metal-insulator transition in the pristine honeycomb lattice, which occurs at a finite critical value of $U$, in the depleted lattice, the transition at $U=0$ is associated with a van Hove singularity arising from the crossing of accidental nodal lines enforced by symmetry. We also employ linear spin wave theory (LSWT) to the effective Heisenberg model in the strong-coupling limit and obtain the global antiferromagnetic order parameter $m_{\rm AFM} \approx 0.146$. The order parameters from both QMC and LSWT agree quantitatively. Our findings indicate that vacancy engineering offers an effective way to tailor the magnetic properties of quantum materials.

Title: Fully-frustrated octahedral antiferromagnets: emergent complexity in external field
Authors: A. S. Gubina, T. Ziman, M. E. Zhitomirsky
Abstract: Octahedral antiferromagnets are distinguished by crystal lattices composed of octahedra of magnetic ions. In the fully frustrated case, the Heisenberg Hamiltonian can be represented as a sum of squares of total spins for each octahedral block. We study the fully frustrated spin model for a lattice of edge-shared octahedra, which corresponds to the J1-J2 fcc antiferromagnet with J2/J1 = 1/2. The magnetization process at this strongly frustrated point features a remarkably rich sequence of different magnetic phases that include fractional plateaus at m = 1/3 and 2/3 values of the total magnetization. By performing extensive Monte Carlo simulations we construct the H-T phase diagram of the classical model with eight field-induced states, which acquire stability via the order by disorder mechanism. These antiferromagnetic states have distinct spin configurations of their octahedral blocks. The same spin configurations are also relevant for the fully frustrated corner-shared model bringing an apparent similarity to their field-induced states.

Title: Self-induced Josephson oscillations and self-trapping in a supersolid dipolar quantum gas
Authors: Beatrice Donelli, Nicolò Antolini, Giulio Biagioni, Marco Fattori, Andrea Fioretti, Carlo Gabbanini, Massimo Inguscio, Luca Tanzi, Giovanni Modugno, Augusto Smerzi, Luca Pezzè
Abstract: The Josephson effect characterizes superfluids and superconductors separated by a weak link, the so-called Josephson junction. A recent experiment has shown that Josephson oscillations can be observed also in a supersolid, where the weak link is not due to an external barrier, but is self-induced by interparticle interactions. Here we show theoretically that supersolids -- despite their self-induced character -- feature all the standard properties of bosonic Josephson junction arrays, including macroscopic quantum self-trapping. We focus on the harmonically trapped dipolar supersolids of interest for current experiments, and show that they can be described with a generalized Josephson model that takes into account spatial inhomogeneities. Our work shades new light on the dynamics of supersolids and opens the way to the study of a novel class of Josephson junctions.

Title: Phonon-mediated electron attraction in SrTiO$_3$ via the generalized Fr\"ohlich and deformation potential mechanisms
Authors: Norm M. Tubman, Christopher J.N. Coveney, Chih-En Hsu, Andres Montoya-Castillo, Marina R. Filip, Jeffrey B. Neaton, Zhenglu Li, Vojtech Vlcek, Antonios M. Alvertis
Abstract: Superconductivity in doped SrTiO$_3$ was discovered in 1964, the first superconducting transition observed in a doped semiconductor. However, the mechanism behind electron pairing in SrTiO$_3$ remains a subject of debate. By developing a theoretical framework to incorporate dynamical lattice screening in the electronic Coulomb interactions of semiconductors and insulators, we demonstrate analytically that long-range electron-phonon interactions described by a generalized multi-phonon Fröhlich mechanism result in phonon-mediated electron-electron attraction in SrTiO$_3$. Moreover, by combining our theory with first-principles calculations, we reveal an additional attractive interaction between electrons in SrTiO$_3$ due to the deformation potential mechanism, arising from the mixed ionic-covalent character of the Ti-O bond. Our results may have implications for the emergence of phonon-mediated electron attraction and superconductivity in a broader range of materials.

Title: Signatures of Non-Abelian Kitaev quantum spin liquids in noise magnetormetry
Authors: Xiao Xiao, Masahiro O. Takahashi, Paul Stevenson, Satoshi Fujimoto, Arun Bansil
Abstract: Identification of isolated Majorana zero modes (MZMs) is a key step towards the realization of fault-tolerant topological quantum computation. Here we show how the $T_1$-based noise magnetormetry of a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center qubit can reveal the unique signatures of Majorana fermions attached to vacancies in a non-Abelian Kitaev quantum spin liquid (KQSL). The $1/T_1$ of the NV center is found to be increased significantly when the working frequency of the NV center matches the energy difference between a MZM and a low-energy hybridized mode involving dangling Majorana fermions adjacent to vacancies. In experiments, this energy difference can be tuned by an external Zeeman field. Because of the large excitation gap of flipping a local $Z_2$ gauge field, the $1/T_1$ spectrum is robust against other fluctuations in KQSLs. Our study presents a promising pathway for identifying the non-Abelian phase in Kitaev materials.

Title: Anomalous Hall effect in highly c-plane oriented Mn$_{3}$Ge/Si(100) thin films grown by pulsed laser deposition
Authors: Indraneel Sinha, Purba Dutta, Nazma Firdosh, Shreyashi Sinha, Nirmal Ganguli, Sujit Manna
Abstract: Antiferromagnetic Mn$_{3}$Ge with a non-collinear Kagome structures present exciting prospects for exploring Berry curvature driven anomalous Hall effects (AHE). Despite substantial progress in bulk systems, the synthesis of crystalline thin films directly on silicon with a hexagonal phase presents a particular challenge unless a buffer layer is employed. In this study, we report the synthesis of single phase c-plane oriented hexagonal Mn$_{3}$Ge(0001) films on Si(100) using pulsed laser deposition. Under suitable growth conditions, we obtain layer-by-layer films with atomically flat surfaces and interfaces. High-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy study reveals the detail surface atomic structures, where the surface Mn atoms spontaneously arrange into a Kagome lattice. Tunneling spectroscopy (dI/dV) measurement on the atomically resolved Kagome surface show a minima in local density of states near the Fermi level, likely originated from the Weyl crossings near K points. Despite the nearly vanishing magnetization, magnetotransport measurements in 30 nm $Mn_{3}$Ge(0001) films show anomalous Hall resistivity up to 0.41 ($\mu\Omega\cdot\text{cm}$) at 2 K. Our \textit{ab initio} calculations shed further light on the existence of topological features and the band structures in Mn$_{3+x}$Ge$_{1-x}$ with increasing Mn concentration $x$. The anomalous Hall response at room temperature in crystalline Mn$_{3}$Ge films on Si(100) offer promising potential for the development of antiferromagnetic spintronics.

Title: Nonclassical dynamics of N\'eel vector and magnetization accompanied by THz and high-harmonic radiation from ultrafast-light-driven NiO antiferromagnet insulator
Authors: Federico Garcia-Gaitan, Adrian E. Feiguin, Branislav K. Nikolic
Abstract: Ultrafast-light-driven strongly correlated antiferromagnetic insulators, such as prototypical NiO with large energy gap 4 eV, have recently attracted experimental attention using either above-gap [K. Gillmeister et al., Nat. Commun. 11, 4095 (2020)] or subgap [H. Qiu et al., Nat. Phys. 17, 388 (2021)] energy photons that are of fundamental interest in far-from-equilibrium quantum matter or spintronic applications, respectively. In the latter context, emission of THz radiation is also observed from NiO/Pt bilayers, where heavy metal (HM) Pt introduces strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC). However, microscopic mechanisms of such emission remain obscure because spintronic THz emitters have been amply studied using FM/HM (FM-ferromagnetic metal of conventional type) bilayers, where ultrafast demagnetization takes place and is directly related to THz emission. Conversely, in NiO total magnetization is zero prior to the fs laser pulse (fsLP) application. Here we employ the two-orbital Hubbard-Hund-Heisenberg model and study, via numerically exact nonequilibrium quantum many-body methods, the dynamics of its Neel vector and nonequilibrium magnetization. Additionally, we compute electromagnetic radiation by both time-dependent magnetization and local charge currents arising in either plain NiO or NiO with proximity SOC introduced by HM layer. Our analysis reveals nonclassical dynamics of Neel vector and nonequilibrium magnetization, changing only in length while not rotating, where the former is substantially reduced only in the case above-gap fsLP. In the plain NiO case, THz radiation of interest to applications is insignificant, but adding SOC enhances both current and magnetic dipole contributions to it. Above THz range, we find integer high-harmonic generation, as well as unusual noninteger harmonics for above-gap fsLP pump.

Abstract: Quantum computation with electron spin qubits requires coherent and efficient manipulation of these spins, typically accomplished through the application of alternating magnetic or electric fields for electron spin resonance (ESR). In particular, electrical driving allows us to apply localized fields on the electrons, which benefits scale-up architectures. However, we have found that Electric Dipole Spin Resonance (EDSR) is insufficient for modeling the Rabi behavior in recent experimental studies. Therefore, we propose that the electron spin is being driven by a new method of electric spin qubit control which generalizes the spin dynamics by taking into account a quadrupolar contribution of the quantum dot: electric quadrupole spin resonance (EQSR). In this work, we explore the electric quadrupole driving of a quantum dot in silicon, specifically examining the cases of 5 and 13 electron occupancies.

Title: Phase dependence of the Thermal Memory Effect in Polycrystalline Ribbon and Bulk Ni55Fe19Ga26 Heusler Alloys
Authors: A. Vidal-Crespo, A.F. Manchón-Gordón, J.M. Martín-Olalla, F.J. Romero, J.J. Ipus, M.C. Gallardo, J.S. Blázquez, C.F. Conde
Abstract: The thermal memory effect, TME, has been studied in Ni55Fe19Ga26 shape memory alloys, fabricated as ribbons via melt-spinning and as pellets via arc-melting, to evaluate its dependence on the martensitic structure and the macrostructure of the samples. When the reverse martensitic transformation is interrupted, a kinetic delay in the subsequent complete transformation is only evident in the ribbon samples, where the 14M modulated structure is the dominant phase. In contrast, degradation of the modulated structure or the presence of the gamma-phase significantly reduces the observed TME. In such cases, the magnitude of the TME approaches the detection limits of commercial calorimeters, and only high-resolution calorimeter at very low heating rate (40 mK h-1) can show the effect. Following the kinetic arrest and subsequent cooling, the reverse martensitic transformation was completed at several heating rates to confirm the athermal nature of the phenomenon.

Title: Susceptibility anisotropy and absence of ferroelectric order in the Kitaev spin liquid candidate Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$
Authors: C. Dhanasekhar, Monika Jawale, Rahul Kumar, D. Chandrasekhar Kakarla, Sagar Mahapatra, Mitch M.C. Chou, A. Sundaresan, H.D. Yang, A.V. Mahajan
Abstract: We report the magnetic, magnetodielectric, and electric polarization properties of single crystals of the Co-based Kitaev Spin Liquid (KSL) candidate Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$ (NCTO). The sample shows magnetic transitions at 26 K, 16 K, and 5 K, consistent with the literature. The magnetic measurements along and perpendicular to the Co-honeycomb planes show a strong anisotropy in susceptibility and in Curie-Weiss (C-W) temperatures. The experimental anisotropic C-W temperatures of NCTO qualitatively match with the theoretical C-W temperatures, calculated using the HKTF model [C. Kim \textit{et al.}, J. Phys.: Condens. Matter \textbf{34}, 045802 (2021)]. We find from our temperature- and field-dependent dielectric and pyroelectric ($I_p$) current studies ($H\parallel ab$ and $E\perp ab$) that our single crystal NCTO samples do not have a finite electric polarization below 100 K. These $I_p$ studies confirm the absence of a magnetoelectric coupling and electric polarization properties in the title compound and suggest that the zig-zag AFM structure is more favorable than the triple-$Q$ structure with AFM Kitaev interactions.

Title: From Dyson Models to Many-Body Quantum Chaos
Authors: Alexei Andreanov, Matteo Carrega, Jeff Murugan, Jan Olle, Dario Rosa, Ruth Shir
Abstract: A deep understanding of the mechanisms underlying many-body quantum chaos is one of the big challenges in contemporary theoretical physics. We tackle this problem in the context of a set of perturbed quadratic Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) Hamiltonians defined on graphs. This allows us to disentangle the geometrical properties of the underlying single-particle problem and the importance of the interaction terms, showing that the former is the dominant feature ensuring the single-particle to many-body chaotic transition. Our results are verified numerically with state-of-the-art numerical techniques, capable of extracting eigenvalues in a desired energy window of very large Hamiltonians. Our approach essentially provides a new way of viewing many-body chaos from a single-particle perspective.

Title: Near-future projections in continuous agent-based models for crowd dynamics: mathematical structures in use and their implications
Authors: Iñaki Echeverría-Huarte (ULISBOA), Antonin Roge (ILM, ENS Paris Saclay), Olivier Simonin (CITI, UCBL), Alexandre Nicolas (ILM, CNRS)
Abstract: This paper addresses the theoretical foundations of pedestrian models for crowd dynamics. While the topic gains momentum, current models differ widely in their mathematical structure, even if we only consider continuous agent-based models. To clarify their underpinning, we first lay mathematical foundations for the common hierarchical decomposition into strategic, tactical, and operational levels and underline the practical interest in preserving the continuity between the latter two levels by working with a floor field, rather than way-points. Turning to local navigation, we clarify how three archetypical approaches, namely, purely reactive models, anticipatory models based on the idea of times to collision, and game theory, differ in the way they extrapolate trajectories in the near future. We also insist on the oft-overlooked distinction between processes pertaining to decision-making and mechanical effects in dense settings. The implications of these differences are illustrated with a comparison of the numerical predictions of these models in the simple scenario of head-on collision avoidance between agents, by varying the walking speed, the reaction times, and the degree of courtesy of the agents, notably.

Title: Pauli Spectrum and Non-stabilizerness of Typical Quantum Many-Body States
Authors: Xhek Turkeshi, Anatoly Dymarsky, Piotr Sierant
Abstract: An important question of quantum information is to characterize genuinely quantum (beyond-Clifford) resources necessary for universal quantum computing. Here, we use the Pauli spectrum to quantify how magic, beyond Clifford, typical many-qubit states are. We first present a phenomenological picture of the Pauli spectrum based on quantum typicality and then confirm it for Haar random states. We then introduce filtered stabilizer entropy, a magic measure that can resolve the difference between typical and atypical states. We proceed with the numerical study of the Pauli spectrum of states created by random circuits as well as for eigenstates of chaotic Hamiltonians. We find that in both cases the Pauli spectrum approaches the one of Haar random states, up to exponentially suppressed tails. Our results underscore differences between typical and atypical states from the point of view of quantum information.

Title: Universal correlations in chaotic many-body quantum states: Fock-space formulation of Berrys random wave model
Authors: Florian Schoeppl, Remy Dubertrand, Juan-Diego Urbina, Klaus Richter
Abstract: The apparent randomness of chaotic eigenstates in interacting quantum systems hides subtle correlations dynamically imposed by their finite energy per particle. These correlations are revealed when Berrys approach for chaotic eigenfunctions in single-particle systems is lifted into many-body space. We achieve this by a many-body semiclassics analysis, appropriate for the mesoscopic regime of large but finite number of particles. We then identify the universality of both the cross-correlations and the Gaussian distribution of expansion coefficients as the signatures of chaotic eigenstates. Combined, these two aspects imprint a distinctive backbone to the morphology of eigenstates that we check against extensive quantum simulations. The universality of eigenstate correlations for fixed energy density is then a further signature of many-body quantum chaos that, while consistent with the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, lies beyond random matrix theory.

Abstract: In the ongoing effort towards a scalable quantum computer, multiple technologies have been proposed. Some of them exploit topological materials to process quantum information. In this work, we propose a lattice of photonic cavities with alternating hoppings to create a modified multidomain SSH chain, that is, a sequence of topological insulators made from chains of dimers. A qubit is then coupled to each boundary. We show this system is well suited for quantum information processing because topological transfer of photons through this one-dimensional lattice can entangle any set of qubits on demand, providing a scalable quantum platform. We verify this claim evaluating entanglement measures and witnesses proving that bipartite and multipartite entanglement is produced, even in the presence of some disorder.

Title: Quasiparticle cooling algorithms for quantum many-body state preparation
Authors: Jerome Lloyd, Alexios Michailidis, Xiao Mi, Vadim Smelyanskiy, Dmitry A. Abanin
Abstract: Probing correlated states of many-body systems is one of the central tasks for quantum simulators and processors. A promising approach to state preparation is to realize desired correlated states as steady states of engineered dissipative evolution. A recent experiment with a Google superconducting quantum processor [X. Mi et al., Science 383, 1332 (2024)] demonstrated a cooling algorithm utilizing auxiliary degrees of freedom that are periodically reset to remove quasiparticles from the system, thereby driving it towards its ground state. In this work, we develop a kinetic theory framework to describe quasiparticle cooling dynamics, and employ it to compare the efficiency of different cooling algorithms. In particular, we introduce a protocol where coupling to auxiliaries is modulated in time to minimize heating processes, and demonstrate that it allows a high-fidelity preparation of ground states in different quantum phases. We verify the validity of the kinetic theory description by an extensive comparison with numerical simulations for the examples of a 1d transverse-field Ising model, the transverse-field Ising model with an additional integrability-breaking field, and a non-integrable antiferromagnetic Heisenberg spin ladder. In all cases we are able to efficiently cool into the many-body ground state. The effects of noise, which limits efficiency of variational quantum algorithms in near-term quantum processors, are investigated through the lens of the kinetic theory: we show how the steady state quasiparticle populations depend on the noise rate, and we establish maximum noise values for achieving high-fidelity ground states. This work establishes quasiparticle cooling algorithms as a practical, robust method for many-body state preparation on near-term quantum processors.

Title: Dynamic thermalization on noisy quantum hardware
Authors: H. Perrin, T. Scoquart, A. I. Pavlov, N. V. Gnezdilov
Abstract: Emulating thermal observables on a digital quantum computer is essential for quantum simulation of many-body physics. However, thermalization typically requires a large system size due to incorporating a thermal bath, whilst limited resources of near-term digital quantum processors allow for simulating relatively small systems. We show that thermal observables and fluctuations may be obtained for a small closed system without a thermal bath. Thermal observables occur upon classically averaging quantum mechanical observables over randomized variants of their time evolution that run independently on a digital quantum processor. Using an IBM quantum computer, we experimentally find thermal occupation probabilities with finite positive and negative temperatures defined by the initial state's energy. Averaging over random evolutions facilitates error mitigation, with the noise contributing to the temperature in the simulated observables. This result fosters probing the dynamical emergence of equilibrium properties of matter at finite temperatures on noisy intermediate-scale quantum hardware.

Title: Fluctuation theorems in general relativistic stochastic thermodynamics
Authors: Yifan Cai, Tao Wang, Liu Zhao
Abstract: Based on the recently proposed framework of general relativistic stochastic mechanics [{\em J. Stat. Phys.}, 190:193, 2023; {\em J. Stat. Phys.}, 190:181, 2023] and stochastic thermodynamics [{\em SciPost Physics Core} 7, 082, 2024] at the ensemble level, this work focuses on general relativistic stochastic thermodynamics at the trajectory level. The first law of stochastic thermodynamics is reformulated and the fluctuation theorems are proved on this level, with emphasis on maintaining fully general covariance and on the choice of observers.

Title: Phase transitions in (2 + 1)D subsystem-symmetric monitored quantum circuits
Authors: Cole Kelson-Packer, Akimasa Miyake
Abstract: The interplay of unitary evolution and projective measurements is a modern interest in the study of many-body entanglement. On the one hand, the competition between these two processes leads to the recently discovered measurement-induced phase transition (MIPT). On the other hand, measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) is a well-known computational paradigm where measurements simulate unitary evolution by utilizing the entanglement of special resources such as the two-dimensional (2D) cluster state. The entanglement properties enabling MBQC may be attributed to symmetry-protected topological (SPT) orders, particularly subsystem-symmetric topological (SSPT) orders. It was recently found that the one-dimensional cluster state may be associated with an SPT phase in random circuits respecting a global $\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, and furthermore that all phase transitions in this scenario belong to the same universality class. As resources with greater computational power feature greater symmetry, it is fruitful to investigate further any relationship between levels of symmetry in MIPTs and MBQC. In this paper we investigate MIPTs on a torus with three levels of symmetry-respecting unitary evolution interspersed by measurements. Although we find two area-law phases and one volume-law phase with distinct entanglement structures for each ensemble, the phase transition from the volume-law phase to the area-law phase associated with the 2D SSPT cluster state has variable correlation length exponent $\nu$. Whereas $\nu\approx 0.90$ for unconstrained Clifford unitaries and $\nu\approx0.83$ for globally-symmetric Cliffords, subsystem-symmetric Cliffords feature a much smaller value $\nu\approx 0.38$. We discuss how these distinct $\nu$'s quantify spacetime response scales where quantum information is manipulated by single-qubit measurements as in MBQC.

Title: Protons accumulate at the graphene-water interface
Authors: Xavier R. Advincula, Kara D. Fong, Angelos Michaelides, Christoph Schran
Abstract: Water's ability to autoionize into hydroxide and hydronium ions profoundly influences surface properties, rendering interfaces either basic or acidic. While it is well-established that protons show an affinity to the air-water interface, a critical knowledge gap exists in technologically relevant surfaces like the graphene-water interface. Here we use machine learning-based simulations with first-principles accuracy to unravel the behavior of the hydroxide and hydronium ions at the graphene-water interface. Our findings reveal that protons accumulate at the graphene-water interface, with the hydronium ion predominantly residing in the first contact layer of water. In contrast, the hydroxide ion exhibits a bimodal distribution, found both near the surface and towards the interior layers. Analysis of the underlying electronic structure reveals local polarization effects, resulting in counterintuitive charge rearrangement. Proton propensity to the graphene-water interface challenges the interpretation of surface experiments and is expected to have far-reaching consequences for ion conductivity, interfacial reactivity, and proton-mediated processes.

Title: Simulation of 24,000 Electrons Dynamics: Real-Time Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (TDDFT) with the Real-Space Multigrids (RMG)
Authors: Jacek Jakowski, Wenchang Lu, Emil Briggs, David Lingerfelt, Bobby G. Sumpter, Panchapakesan Ganesh, Jerzy Bernholc
Abstract: We present the theory, implementation, and benchmarking of a real-time time-dependent density functional theory (RT-TDDFT) module within the RMG code, designed to simulate the electronic response of molecular systems to external perturbations. Our method offers insights into non-equilibrium dynamics and excited states across a diverse range of systems, from small organic molecules to large metallic nanoparticles. Benchmarking results demonstrate excellent agreement with established TDDFT implementations and showcase the superior stability of our time-integration algorithm, enabling long-term simulations with minimal energy drift. The scalability and efficiency of RMG on massively parallel architectures allow for simulations of complex systems, such as plasmonic nanoparticles with thousands of atoms. Future extensions, including nuclear and spin dynamics, will broaden the applicability of this RT-TDDFT implementation, providing a powerful toolset for studies of photoactive materials, nanoscale devices, and other systems where real-time electronic dynamics is essential.

Title: Fermionic and parafermionic CFTs with $\widehat{su}(2)$ and $\widehat{su}(3)$ symmetry
Authors: Kohki Kawabata
Abstract: We investigate two-dimensional conformal field theories (CFTs) with affine $\widehat{su}(2)$ and $\widehat{su}(3)$ algebra symmetry. Their bosonic modular-invariant partition functions have been fully classified based on the ADE classification. In this work, we extend the classification to include fermionic and parafermionic CFTs with the same affine symmetries, utilizing techniques of fermionization and parafermionization. We find that the fermionic and parafermionic $\widehat{su}(2)$ models are related to non-simply laced Dynkin diagrams.

Title: On Chord Dynamics and Complexity Growth in Double-Scaled SYK
Authors: Jiuci Xu
Abstract: We study the time evolution governed by the two-sided chord Hamiltonian in the double-scaled SYK model, which induces a probability distribution over operators in the double-scaled algebra. Through the bulk-to-boundary map, this distribution translates into dynamical profiles of bulk states within the chord Hilbert space. We derive analytic expressions for such profiles, valid across a broad parameter range and all time scales. Additionally, we demonstrate how distinct semi-classical behaviors emerge by localizing within specific energy regions in the semi-classical limit. We revisit the doubled Hilbert space formalism as an isometric map between the one-particle sector of the chord Hilbert space and the doubled zero-particle sector. Utilizing this map, we obtain analytic results for correlation functions and investigate the dynamical properties of operator Krylov complexity for chords, establishing an equivalence between the chord number generating function and the crossed four-point correlation function. We also explore finite-temperature effects, showing that operator spreading slows as temperature decreases. In the semi-classical limit, we perform a saddle point analysis and incorporate the one-loop determinant to derive the normalized time-ordered four-point correlation function. The leading correction reproduces the \(1/N\) connected contribution observed in the large-\(p\) SYK model at infinite temperature. Finally, we examine the time evolution of operator Krylov complexity for a matter chord in the triple-scaled regime, linking it to the renormalized two-sided length in JT gravity with matter.

Title: Nonlinear optics in 2D materials: from classical to quantum
Authors: Liuxin Gu, You Zhou
Abstract: Nonlinear optics has long been a cornerstone of modern photonic technology, enabling a wide array of applications, from frequency conversion to the generation of ultrafast light pulses. Recent breakthroughs in two-dimensional (2D) materials have opened a frontier in this field, offering new opportunities for both classical and quantum nonlinear optics. These atomically thin materials exhibit strong light-matter interactions and large nonlinear responses, thanks to their tunable lattice symmetries, strong resonance effects, and highly engineerable band structures. In this paper, we explore the potential that 2D materials bring to nonlinear optics, covering topics from classical nonlinear optics to nonlinearities at the few-photon level. We delve into how these materials enable possibilities, such as symmetry control, phase matching, and integration into photonic circuits. The fusion of 2D materials with nonlinear optics provides insights into the fundamental behaviors of elementary excitations such as electrons, excitons, and photons in low dimensional systems and has the potential to transform the landscape of next-generation photonic and quantum technologies.

Title: Emergent cell migration from cell shape deformations and T1 transitions
Authors: Harish P. Jain, Richard D.J.G. Ho, Luiza Angheluta
Abstract: T1 transitions, which are localised cell rearrangements, play an important role in the fluidization of epithelial monolayers. Using a multi-phase field model and an active elastic solid model, we show that although each cell undergoes T1 transitions in time as uncorrelated, random events, the spatial distribution of these events is highly correlated and is dependent on cell shape. T1 transitions have a dual effect. Cells losing neighbours tend to relax their shape, while those gaining neighbours tend to elongate. By analysing the statistics of successive T1 transitions undergone by a deformable cell, we find asymmetric spatial distributions related to how cells lose or gain neighbours. These asymmetric spatial patterns of T1 transitions promote directed cell migration, and form the backbone for coherent flow patterns at tissue scales.

Title: Implicit Time-Marching for Lagrange Multiplier Formulation for Couple Stress Elastodynamics
Authors: José Ortiz-Ocampo, Nicolás Guarín-Zapata
Abstract: The study of metamaterials and architected materials has intensified interest in continuum mechanics models that capture size-dependent microstructure interactions. Among these, Consistent Couple-Stress Theory (C-CST) incorporates microscale mechanical interactions by introducing higher-order derivatives in the strain energy. While previous studies have relied on convolutional principles or inverse Laplace transforms to obtain time-dependent solutions, this work demonstrates that implicit time integration applied to a mixed finite element method with a Lagrange multiplier provides stable, direct time-domain solutions for dynamic C-CST modeling. The proposed finite element scheme is tested through the Method of Manufactured Solutions (MMS) for static cases and dynamic simulations of simple mechanical scenarios. Our computational experiments revealed energy dissipation, emphasizing the importance of exploring symplectic integrators in future work to impose energy conservation. Additionally, further research is required to verify temporal stability through time-domain MMS and to investigate complex mechanical scenarios, including those previously restrictive, challenging to simulate, or unfeasible with existing dynamic methods. This work lays the groundwork for studying size-dependent material behavior and provides the foundation for advanced applications in material design and wave propagation.

Title: Optimizing lossy state preparation for quantum sensing using Hamiltonian engineering
Authors: Bharath Hebbe Madhusudhana
Abstract: One of the most prominent platforms for demonstrating quantum sensing below the standard quantum limit is the spinor Bose-Einstein condensate. While a quantum advantage using several tens of thousands of atoms has been demonstrated in this platform, it faces an important challenge: atom loss. Atom loss is a Markovian error process modelled by Lindblad jump operators, and a no-go theorem, which we also show here, states that the loss of atoms in all spin components reduces the quantum advantage to a constant factor. Here, we show that this no-go theorem can be circumvented if we constrain atom losses to a single spin component. Moreover, we show that in this case, the maximum quantum Fisher information with $N$ atoms scales as $N^{3/2}$, establishing that a scalable quantum advantage can be achieved despite atom loss. Although Lindblad jump operators are generally non-Hermitian and non-invertible, we use their Moore-Penrose inverse to develop a framework for constructing several states with this scaling of Fisher information in the presence of losses. We use Hamiltonian engineering with realistic Hamiltonians to develop experimental protocols for preparing these states. Finally, we discuss possible experimental techniques to constrain the losses to a single spin mode.
