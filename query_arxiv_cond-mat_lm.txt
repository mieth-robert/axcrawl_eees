Title: Effects of oblique collimated irradiation on the onset of phototaxis-driven bioconvection in an isotropic porous medium
Authors: S. K. Rajput, M. K. Panda
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the effects of oblique collimated irradiation on the onset of phototaxis-driven bioconvection in an isotropic porous medium. A linear stability analysis is conducted to assess the system's stability under fixed parameter values. The resulting eigenvalue problem is numerically solved using a fourth-order accurate finite difference scheme combined with Newton-Raphson-Kantorovich iterations. The results indicate that the system exhibits increased instability as the angle of incidence rises for a given Darcy number. Additionally, the critical Rayleigh number is found to be higher when a rigid top wall is considered compared to a stress-free top wall, suggesting that the suspension attains greater stability in the presence of a rigid top boundary.

Title: Active Saffman-Taylor Viscous Fingering
Authors: Akash Ganesh (FAST), Carine Douarche (FAST), Harold Auradou (FAST)
Abstract: Adding swimming bacteria to a liquid causes its effective shear viscosity to decrease, eventually reaching a regime of zero viscosity. We examined whether this property leads to viscous finger-like displacement fronts like those observed when a less viscous fluid displaces a more viscous liquid. Our study revealed that this system exhibits more complex dynamic characteristics than the classical Saffman-Taylor instability. We discovered that this instability occurs when the bacterial volume fraction exceeds a critical value, and the imposed shear rate is below critical value, for which the viscosity of the suspension is zero.

Title: Rouse Mode Analysis of Chain Relaxation in Reversibly Crosslinked Polymer Melts
Authors: Rahul Karmakar, Srikanth Sastry, Sanat K. Kumar, Tarak K. Patra
Abstract: Polymer melts with chains undergoing reversible crosslinking have distinctively favorable dynamic properties, e.g., self healing and reprocessability. In these situations there are two relevant elementary time scales: the segmental and the sticker association times. A convenient framework to model these situations is the sticky Rouse model and here we perform hybrid moleculear dynamics (MD) Monte Carlo (MC) simulations to examine its relevance. In agreement with the underpinning idea discussed above we find that reversibly crosslinked chains show two distinct modes of relaxation behavior depending on the magnitude of bond lifetimes. For bond lifetimes shorter than the chain end-to-end relaxation time, the polymers exhibit essentially Rouse like dynamics, but with an apparently increased local friction relative to the non-sticky analog. For longer bond lifetimes, the chains exhibit two modes of relaxation: the faster mode is independent of bond lifetime, but the slower mode is controlled by it. However, these slower mode results are not consistent with the predictions of the sticky Rouse model. Our Rouse mode analysis as a function of chain length, N, imply that this is likely a result of the relatively short chain length employed, but they nevertheless suggest that theories need to include these small chain effects if they are to be relevant to experimental systems with short chains following Rouse dynamics.

Title: Brownian motion and microrheology in complex fluids under periodic boundary conditions
Authors: Yasuya Nakayama
Abstract: We review the theoretical aspects of determining linear rheology using passive microrheology from simulations under periodic boundary conditions (PBC). It is common to impose periodic boundary conditions when evaluating bulk properties by molecular simulation. The Brownian motion of the probe particles is affected by PBCs, and thus their effects must be considered when microrheological analysis is applied to evaluate the dynamic modulus. First, we review the theory of microrheology based on the generalized Langevin equation (GLE) in an unbounded domain. Then, we briefly discuss the effect of periodic boundary conditions on the diffusion coefficient. After that, we explain the effect of PBCs on the mean-square displacement of Brownian particles and their impact on microrheology. The passive microrheology technique under PBCs provides a new approach for rheology evaluation in molecular simulations of complex liquids in addition to the traditional Green-Kubo formula and non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD).

Title: Extension of Sequence of Physical Processes framework relating the second Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor to the Green-Lagrange strain tensor
Authors: Louis-Vincent Bouthier, Romain Castellani, Rudy Valette
Abstract: An extension of the Sequence of Physical Processes using geometrical corrections of the Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor and the Green-Lagrange strain tensor is addressed. More precisely, the usual Sequence of Physical Processes omits some geometrical non linearities that appear when the deformation becomes large. With this extension, geometrical corrections are added and let the opportunity to study rheological non linearities. Application on two famous classical viscoelastic models, namely the linear Maxwell model and the linear Kelvin-Voigt model, helps to understand how some complex behaviours may be rationalised to better understand the behaviours after some corrections.

Title: Active learning for parameter-free multiscale modeling of boundary lubrication
Authors: Hannes Holey, Peter Gumbsch, Lars Pastewka
Abstract: Lubricated friction is a multiscale problem where molecular processes dictate the macroscopic response of the system. Traditional lubrication models rely on semi-empirical constitutive relations, which become unreliable under extreme conditions. Here, we present a simulation framework that seamlessly couples molecular and continuum models for boundary lubrication without fixed-form constitutive laws. We train Gaussian process regression models as surrogates for predicting interfacial shear and normal stress in molecular dynamics simulations. An active learning algorithm ensures that our model adapts in scenarios where common constitutive laws fail, such as near phase transitions. We demonstrate our approach for nanoscale fluid flow over rough and heterogeneous surfaces, paving the way for accurate boundary lubrication simulations at experimental length and time scales.

Title: Two-component atomic Fermi superfluid with spin-orbital coupling in thin spherical-shell geometry
Authors: Yan He, Chih-Chun Chien
Abstract: We present a theory of two-component atomic Fermi superfluid with tunable pairing interaction in a thin spherical shell subject to spin-orbit coupling (SOC). By incorporating SOC into the Fermi superfluid in the BCS-Bose Einstein condensation (BEC) crossover, we obtain the energy spectrum and equations of state. While the order parameter and chemical potential are suppressed by SOC on the BCS side, the former remains positive but the latter may be pushed to negative values by SOC. Meanwhile, the compressibility exhibits kinks as the pairing interaction or SOC varies, indicating singular behavior of higher-derivatives of the free energy despite the presence of the superfluid order parameter. The minimum of the energy dispersion indicates a decoupling of the energy gap from the order parameter, and the compressibility kinks occur when the energy gap approaches zero. We found the particle-hole mixing in the Fermi superfluid essential for the compressibility kinks since a Fermi gas with the same SOC but no pairing interaction only exhibits complicated dispersions but no singular behavior. Therefore, our results show that a combination of superfluid, SOC, and geometry can lead to interesting phenomena. We also discuss possible experimental realizations and implications.

Title: The benefit of ignorance for traffic through a random congestible network
Authors: Alican Saray, Calvin Pozderac, Ari Josephson, Brian Skinner
Abstract: When traffic is routed through a network that is susceptible to congestion, the self-interested decisions made by individual users do not, in general, produce the optimal flow. This discrepancy is quantified by the so-called "price of anarchy." Here we consider whether the traffic produced by self-interested users is made better or worse when users have uncertain knowledge about the cost functions of the links in the network, and we define a parallel concept that we call the "price of ignorance." We introduce a simple model in which fast, congestible links and slow, incongestible links are mixed randomly in a large network and users plan their routes with finite uncertainty about which of the two cost functions describes each link. One of our key findings is that a small level of user ignorance universally improves traffic, regardless of the network composition. Further, there is an optimal level of ignorance which, in our model, causes the self-interested user behavior to coincide with the optimum. Many features of our model can be understood analytically, including the optimal level of user ignorance and the existence of critical scaling near the percolation threshold for fast links, where the potential benefit of user ignorance is greatest.

Title: Magnetism in Twisted Bilayer WSe$_2$
Authors: Liangtao Peng, Christophe De Beule, Du Li, Li Yang, E. J. Mele, Shaffique Adam
Abstract: Using a self-consistent Hartree-Fock theory, we show that the recently observed ferromagnetism in twisted bilayer WSe$_2$ [Nat. Commun. 16, 1959 (2025)] can be understood as a Stoner-like instability of interaction-renormalized moiré bands. We quantitatively reproduce the observed Lifshitz transition as function of hole filling and applied electric field that marks the boundary between layer-hybridized and layer-polarized regimes. The former supports a ferromagnetic valley-polarized ground state below half-filling, developing a topological charge gap at half-filling for small twists. At larger twist angles there is a transition to a gapped triangular Néel antiferromagnet. The layer-polarized regime supports a stripe antiferromagnet below half-filling and a wing-shaped multiferroic ground state above half-filling. We map the evolution of these states as a function of filling factor, electric field, twist angle, and interaction strength. Beyond providing an understanding of recent experiments, our methodology is applicable to a broad class of moiré systems.

Title: "Berry Trashcan" Model of Interacting Electrons in Rhombohedral Graphene
Authors: B. Andrei Bernevig, Yves H. Kwan
Abstract: We present a model for interacting electrons in a continuum band structure that resembles a ``trashcan'', with a flat bottom of radius $k_b$ beyond which the dispersion increases rapidly with velocity $v$. The form factors of the Bloch wavefunctions can be well-approximated by the Girvin-MacDonald-Platzman algebra, which encodes the uniform Berry curvature. We demonstrate how this model captures the salient features of the low-energy Hamiltonian for electron-doped pristine $n$-layer rhombohedral graphene (R$n$G) for appropriate values of the displacement field, and provide corresponding expressions for $k_b$. In the regime where the Fermi wavevector is close to $k_b$, we analytically solve the Hartree-Fock equations for a gapped Wigner crystal in several limits of the model. We introduce a new method, the sliver-patch approximation, which extends the previous few-patch approaches and is crucial in both differentiating even vs odd Chern numbers of the ground state and gapping the Hartree-Fock solution. A key parameter is the Berry flux $\varphi_{\text{BZ}}$ enclosed by the (flat) bottom of the band. We analytically show that there is a ferromagnetic coupling between the signs of $\varphi_{\text{BZ}}$ and the Chern number $C$ of the putative Wigner crystal. We also study the competition between the $C=0$ and $1$ solutions as a function of the interaction potential for parameters relevant to R$n$G. By exhaustive comparison to numerical Hartree-Fock calculations, we demonstrate how the analytic results capture qualitative trends of the phase diagram, as well as quantitative details such as the enhancement of the effective velocity. Our analysis paves the way for an analytic and numerical examination of the stability and competition beyond mean-field theory of the Wigner crystals in this model.

Title: Modified large-$N$ approach to gapless spin liquids, magnetic orders, and dynamics: Application to triangular lattice antiferromagnets
Authors: Anjishnu Bose, Kathleen Hart, Ruairidh Sutcliffe, Arun Paramekanti
Abstract: Recent work has shown that the triangular lattice spin-$1/2$ $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg and XXZ antiferromagnets may exhibit coplanar or supersolid orders proximate to a gapless Dirac spin liquid phase. We explore a distinct $SU(2N)\!\!\times\!\!SU(M)$ fermionic parton approach, complemented by variational Monte Carlo calculations for the spin-$1/2$ model, to study the phase diagram of these models. We also calculate their dynamical spin response including parton interactions within a random phase approximation, and discuss implications for neutron scattering on triangular lattice cobaltates Ba$_3$CoSb$_2$O$_9$, Na$_2$BaCo(PO$_4$)$_2$, K$_2$Co(SeO$_3$)$_2$, Rb$_2$Co(SeO$_3$)$_2$, and Yb-based magnet KYbSe$_2$.

Title: Fluctuation corrections to the free energy of strongly correlated electron systems
Authors: David Riegler, Jannis Seufert, Ronny Thomale, Peter Wölfle
Abstract: We determine the free energy of strongly correlated electron systems in the example of the Hubbard model by calculating the contribution of spin and charge fluctuations to the Gutzwiller approximation mean field result. We employ the slave boson formulation of Kotliar and Ruckenstein in its spin-rotation invariant form in the usual continuous time approximation of the functional integral representation, corrected by "high frequency contributions" (SRIKR+). Previous method-related shortcomings are shown to be overcome when the correct operator ordering for the renormalized kinetic energy is used. The results for the ground state energy in the paramagnetic phase are in very good agreement with state-of-the-art results obtained by methods such as density matrix embedded theory (DMET), quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) and others. The leading low temperature behavior of the free energy allows to extract the quasiparticle effective mass, in particular its enhancement near a continuous phase transition into an ordered state. Our work demonstrates that the SRIKR+ method is competitive with the best available alternative methods and equips the slave-boson approach with an improved synoptic power to explore strongly correlated electron systems.

Title: Resolving the Kagome Origin of the Strange Metallicity in Ni$_3$In

Abstract: Strong correlations promote singular properties such as strange metallicity, which shows considerable commonality across quantum materials platforms. Understanding the mechanism for such emerging universality is an outstanding challenge, given that the underlying degrees of freedom can be complex and varied. Progress may be made in flat band systems, especially kagome and other frustrated-lattice metals with active flat bands. These systems show strange metal behavior that bears a striking resemblance to what happens in heavy-fermion metals. Here, in scanning tunneling spectroscopy of kagome metal Ni$_3$In, we find a zero-bias peak-dip structure whose variation with magnetic field and temperature tracks the evolution of the strange metal properties. We identify the origin of the peak as compact molecular orbitals formed by destructive interference over the kagome sites, resulting in emergent $f$-shell-like localized moments. Using quasi-particle interference, we visualize their interaction with the Dirac light bands. We thus unveil the essential microscopic ingredients of the $d$-electron-based kagome metals that, while distinct from the atomic orbitals of the $f$-electron-based heavy fermion materials, are responsible for a shared phenomenology between the two types of systems. Our findings provide a new window to uncover and interconnect the essential and yet diverse microscopic building blocks in disparate families of quantum materials that drive a convergence towards a universal understanding in the regime of amplified quantum fluctuations.

Title: Altermagnets with topological order in Kitaev bilayers
Authors: Aayush Vijayvargia, Ezra Day-Roberts, Antia S. Botana, Onur Erten
Abstract: Building on recent advancements in altermagnetism, we develop a highly-frustrated magnetic model with Kitaev-like interactions that integrates key aspects of both quantum spin liquids and altermagnets. While the ground state is a gapless quantum spin liquid, our analysis indicates that an altermagnetic local order emerges upon the introduction of additional interactions that gap the excitation spectrum and give rise to a $\mathbb{Z}_2 $ topological order. This magnetically-fragmented topological altermagnet has fractionalized fermionic excitations with momentum-dependent splitting, in stark contrast to both standard altermagnets and Kitaev spin liquids. In addition, we discover two more altermagnetic phases, including a pseudo-altermagnet that exhibits splitting in the absence of a local order and a half-altermagnet that possesses only one type of fractionalized excitations, similar to a half-metal. We discuss experimental approaches for detecting these phases, including layer-dependent spin and heat transport. Our results highlight the rich physics that can arise due to the interplay between altermagnetism and fractionalized excitations in quantum magnets.

Title: Correlated flat-band physics in a bilayer kagome metal based on compact molecular orbitals
Authors: Mounica Mahankali, Fang Xie, Yuan Fang, Lei Chen, Shouvik Sur, Silke Paschen, Jean C. Souza, Moshe Haim, Ambikesh Gupta, Nurit Avraham, Haim Beidenkopf, Hengxin Tan, Binghai Yan, Qimiao Si
Abstract: Flat bands, when located close to the Fermi energy, can considerably enhance the influence of electron correlations on the low energy physics in kagome and other frustrated-lattice metals. A major challenge in describing the interaction effects in such bulk materials is that the flat band is often intermixed with a large number of other bands. Here we show that the recently introduced notion of compact molecular orbitals (CMOs) enable a path forward in describing the dominant effect of the Coulomb interactions in spite of the complexity of the bandstructure. Our materials-based analysis allows for the understanding of the scanning-tunneling-microscopy experiment [J. C. Souza et al., preprint (2024)] of the bilayer kagome metal Ni$_3$In in terms of the CMO notion. From the resulting CMO, an effective Anderson lattice model can be set up. This CMO-based approach enables the calculation of correlation effects that is difficult to do based on the atomic orbitals. Furthermore, it suggests an enriched phase diagram for the strange metal physics of the kagome metal, which can be tested by future experiments. We discuss the implications of our results for the general correlation physics of flat band systems and beyond.

Title: Generalized Peierls substitution for Wannier obstructions: response to disorder and interactions
Authors: Shuai A. Chen, Roderich Moessner, Tai Kai Ng
Abstract: We study the interplay between quantum geometry, interactions, and external fields in complex band systems. When Wannier obstructions preclude a description based solely on atomic-like orbitals,this complicates the prediction of electromagnetic responses particularly in the presence of disorder and interactions. In this work, we introduce a generalized Peierls substitution framework based on Lagrange multipliers to enforce the constraints of the Wannier obstruction in the band of interest. Thus we obtain effective descriptions of interactions and disorder in the presence of non-trivial quantum geometry of that band. We apply our approach to examples including the diamagnetic response in flat-band superconductors and delocalization effects in flat-band metals caused by interactions and disorder.

Title: The role of effective mass and long-range interactions in the band-gap renormalization of photo-excited semiconductors
Authors: Cian C. Reeves, Scott K. Cushing, Vojtech Vlcek
Abstract: Understanding how to control changes in electronic structure and related dynamical renormalizations by external driving fields is the key for understanding ultrafast spectroscopy and applications in electronics. Here we focus on the band-gap's modulation by external electric fields and uncover the effect of band dispersion on the gap renormalization. We employ the Green's function formalism using the real-time Dyson expansion to account for dynamical correlations induced by photodoping. The many-body formalism captures the dynamics of systems with long-range interactions, carrier mobility, and variable electron and hole effective mass. We also demonstrate that mean-field simulations based on the Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian, which lacks dynamical correlations, yields a qualitatively incorrect picture of band-gap renormalization. We find the trend that increasing effective mass, thus decreasing mobility, leads to as much as a 6\% enhancement in band-gap renormalization. Further, the renormalization is strongly dependent on the degree of photodoping. As the screening induced by free electrons and holes effectively reduces any long-range and interband interactions for highly excited systems, we show that there is a specific turnover point with minimal band-gap. We further demonstrate that the optical gap renormalization follows the same trend though its magnitude is altered by the Moss-Burstein effect.

Title: Disentangling anomaly-free symmetries of quantum spin chains
Authors: Sahand Seifnashri, Wilbur Shirley
Abstract: We clarify the lore that anomaly-free symmetries are either on-site or can be transformed into on-site symmetries. We prove that any finite, internal, anomaly-free symmetry in a 1+1d lattice Hamiltonian system can be disentangled into an on-site symmetry by introducing ancillas and applying conjugation via a finite-depth quantum circuit. We provide an explicit construction of the disentangling circuit using Gauss's law operators and emphasize the necessity of adding ancillas. Our result establishes the converse to a generalized Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem by demonstrating that any anomaly-free symmetry admits a trivially gapped Hamiltonian.

Title: Crystal field splittings and magnetic ground state of the Jeff = 1/2 square lattice antiferromagnets YbBi2ClO4 and YbBi2IO4
Authors: Pyeongjae Park, Qianli Ma, G. Sala, S. Calder, Douglas L. Abernathy, Matthew B. Stone, Andrew F. May, Andrew D. Christianson
Abstract: We report on the crystal field level splitting and magnetic ground state of the Jeff = 1/2 square lattice antiferromagnets YbBi2ClO4 and YbBi2IO4 using powder inelastic neutron scattering (INS) and neutron diffraction measurements. Both compounds exhibit a well-isolated $\Gamma_{7}$ doublet ground state under a tetragonal crystal field environment, confirming a robust Jeff = 1/2 picture with slight XY-type anisotropic character in the g-tensor. Notably, the ground state wave functions closely resemble the $\Gamma_{7}$ doublet expected in the perfect cubic limit, consistent with the nearly cubic ligand configuration of eight O2- ions surrounding Yb3+. Below TN =0.21 K, YbBi2IO4 exhibits a stripe long-range magnetic order characterized by an ordering wave vector qm = (1/2, 0, 0) or its symmetry-equivalent (0, 1/2, 0), with magnetic moments aligned along qm. The ordered moment is approximately 79 % of the classical prediction, significantly larger than expected from the isotropic J1-J2 model, suggesting the possible involvement of exchange anisotropy in explaining this observation. We show that symmetry-allowed XXZ and bond-dependent anisotropic exchange terms in a square lattice can play a critical role in stabilizing the stripe order and suppressing the moment reduction as observed. These findings establish YbBi2ClO4 and YbBi2IO4 as unique platforms for exploring rich Jeff = 1/2 magnetism from two less investigated perspectives: (i) on a square lattice and (ii) within a (nearly) cubic ligand environment.

Title: Josephson effect and critical currents in trivial and topological full-shell hybrid nanowires
Authors: Carlos Payá, Ramón Aguado, Pablo San-Jose, Elsa Prada
Abstract: We perform microscopic numerical simulations of the Josephson effect through short junctions between two full-shell hybrid nanowires, comprised of a semiconductor core fully wrapped by a thin superconductor shell, both in the trivial and topological regimes. We explore the behavior of the current-phase relation and the critical current $I_c$ as a function of a threading flux for different models of the semiconductor core and different transparencies of the weak link. We find that $I_c$ is modulated with flux due to the Little-Parks (LP) effect and displays a characteristic skewness towards large fluxes within non-zero LP lobes, which is inherited from the skewness of a peculiar kind of subgap states known as Caroli-de Gennes-Matricon (CdGM) analogs. The appearance of Majorana zero modes at the junction in the topological phase is revealed in $I_c$ as fin-shaped peaks that stand out from the background at low junction transparencies. The competition between CdGMs of opposite electron- and hole-like character produces steps and dips in $I_c$. A rich phenomenology results, which includes 0-, $\pi$- and $\phi_0$-junction behaviors depending on the charge distribution across the wire core and the junction transparency.

Title: A first principles approach to electromechanics in liquids
Authors: Anna T. Bui, Stephen J. Cox
Abstract: Electromechanics in fluids describes the response of the number density to electric fields, and thus provides a powerful means by which to control the behavior of liquids. While continuum approaches have proven successful in describing electromechanical phenomena in macroscopic bodies, their use is questionable when relevant length scales become comparable to a system's natural correlation lengths, as commonly occurs in, e.g., biological systems, nanopores, and microfluidics. Here, we present a first principles theory for electromechanical phenomena in fluids. Our approach is based on the recently proposed hyperdensity functional theory [Sammüller et al, Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 098201 (2024)] in which we treat the charge density as an observable of the system, with the intrinsic Helmholtz free energy functional dependent upon both density and electrostatic potential. Expressions for the coupling between number and charge densities emerge naturally in this formalism, avoiding the need to construct density-dependent and spatially-varying material parameters such as the dielectric constant. Furthermore, we make our theory practical by deriving a connection between hyperdensity functional theory and local molecular field theory, which facilitates machine learning explicit representations for the free energy functionals of systems with short-ranged electrostatic interactions, with long-ranged effects accounted for in a well-controlled mean field fashion.

Title: Peridynamics based model of anticrack-type fracture in brittle foams
Authors: Shucheta Shegufta, Michael Zaiser
Abstract: A particular failure mode of highly porous brittle materials consists in the propagation of cracks under uniaxial compressive loads. Such 'anticracks' have been observed in a range of materials, from snow and porous sandstone to brittle foams. Here we present a computational model for the formation and propagation of anticrack-type failure in porous materials within the general computational framework of bond-based peridynamics. Random porosity is represented, on a scale well above the characteristic pore size, by random bond deletion (dilution disorder). We apply our framework to experimental data on anticrack propagation in silicate foams.

Title: Understanding phonon selection and interference in momentum-resolved electron energy loss spectroscopy
Authors: Thomas W. Pfeifer, Harrison A. Walker, Henry T. Aller, Samuel Graham, Sokrates Pantelides, Jordan A. Hachtel, Eric R. Hoglund, Patrick E. Hopkins
Abstract: As momentum-resolved Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (q-EELS) becomes more widely used for phonon measurements, better understanding of the intricacies of the acquired signal becomes necessary. Selection rules limit the allowed scattering directions, which may prohibit the appearance of specific phonon branches, and features may appear with no clear explanation. To explore both, we perform frequency-resolved q-EELS simulations via the multislice method and compare results to Spectral Energy Density (SED) and Lattice Dynamics (LD) calculations. We discuss common misconceptions of phonon behavior and characterization generally and in the context of measured or simulated q-EELS signals. We highlight the presence of an ``interferometric Brillouin zone'' (closely related to the Dynamic Structure Factor), resulting from the simultaneous sampling of the lattice across each basis index. We also demonstrate the scattering selection rules on well-studied systems and explore the acquisition of a polarization-selective signal based on this phenomena. Finally, we identify thickness-dependent sensitivity effects, where the upper surface of a film is sampled at a disproportionate level. We show that this can yield sensitivity to through-plane vibrational modes, which may be measured experimentally assuming sufficient sensitivity can be achieved. Our work should serve as a road map to guide momentum-resolved vibrational EELS measurements in the future, particularly as ever-increasing energy and momentum resolution becomes available.

Abstract: The design of structural & functional materials for specialized applications is being fueled by rapid advancements in materials synthesis, characterization, manufacturing, with sophisticated computational materials modeling frameworks that span a wide spectrum of length & time scales in the mesoscale between atomistic & continuum approaches. This is leading towards a systems-based design methodology that will replace traditional empirical approaches, embracing the principles of the Materials Genome Initiative. However, several gaps remain in this framework as it relates to advanced structural materials:(1) limited availability & access to high-fidelity experimental & computational datasets, (2) lack of co-design of experiments & simulation aimed at computational model validation,(3) lack of on-demand access to verified and validated codes for simulation and for experimental analyses, & (4) limited opportunities for workforce training and educational outreach. These shortcomings stifle major innovations in structural materials design. This paper describes plans for a community-driven research initiative that addresses current gaps based on best-practice recommendations of leaders in mesoscale modeling, experimentation & cyberinfrastructure obtained at an NSF-sponsored workshop dedicated to this topic. The proposal is to create a hub for Mesoscale Experimentation and Simulation co-Operation (hMESO)-that will (I) provide curation and sharing of models, data, & codes, (II) foster co-design of experiments for model validation with systematic uncertainty quantification, & (III) provide a platform for education & workforce development. It will engage experimental & computational experts in mesoscale mechanics and plasticity, along with mathematicians and computer scientists with expertise in algorithms, data science, machine learning, & large-scale cyberinfrastructure initiatives.

Title: Fusion Dynamics of Majorana Zero Modes
Authors: Themba Hodge, Tuan Kieu, Jasmin Bedow, Eric Mascot, Dirk K. Morr, Stephan Rachel
Abstract: Braiding and fusion of Majorana zero modes are key elements of any future topological Majorana-based quantum computer. Here, we investigate the fusion dynamics of Majorana zero modes in the spinless Kitaev model, as well as in a spinfull model describing magnet-superconductor hybrid structures. We consider various scenarios allowing us to reproduce the fusion rules of the Ising anyon model. Particular emphasis is given to the charge of the fermion obtained after fusing two Majorana zero modes: as long as it remains on the superconductor, charge quantization is absent. When moving the fermion to a non-superconducting region, such as a quantum dot, nearly-quantized charge can be measured. Our findings confirm for both platforms that fusion dynamics of Majorana zero modes can indeed be used for the readout of Majorana qubits.

Abstract: The rapid development and large body of literature on machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) can make it difficult to know how to proceed for researchers who are not experts but wish to use these tools. The spirit of this review is to help such researchers by serving as a practical, accessible guide to the state-of-the-art in MLIPs. This review paper covers a broad range of topics related to MLIPs, including (i) central aspects of how and why MLIPs are enablers of many exciting advancements in molecular modeling, (ii) the main underpinnings of different types of MLIPs, including their basic structure and formalism, (iii) the potentially transformative impact of universal MLIPs for both organic and inorganic systems, including an overview of the most recent advances, capabilities, downsides, and potential applications of this nascent class of MLIPs, (iv) a practical guide for estimating and understanding the execution speed of MLIPs, including guidance for users based on hardware availability, type of MLIP used, and prospective simulation size and time, (v) a manual for what MLIP a user should choose for a given application by considering hardware resources, speed requirements, energy and force accuracy requirements, as well as guidance for choosing pre-trained potentials or fitting a new potential from scratch, (vi) discussion around MLIP infrastructure, including sources of training data, pre-trained potentials, and hardware resources for training, (vii) summary of some key limitations of present MLIPs and current approaches to mitigate such limitations, including methods of including long-range interactions, handling magnetic systems, and treatment of excited states, and finally (viii) we finish with some more speculative thoughts on what the future holds for the development and application of MLIPs over the next 3-10+ years.

Title: Majorana edge states in s-wave kagome superconductors with Rashba interaction
Authors: M. A. Mojarro, Sergio E. Ulloa
Abstract: We study kagome lattices with on-site and extended spin-singlet s-wave superconducting pairing and show that the inclusion of Rashba spin-orbit (RSO) interaction allows time-reversal-invariant topological superconducting states which support helical Majorana pairs at the edge. We calculate the Z2 topological invariant as a function of the pairing parameters for different chemical potentials. The rich phase diagrams reveal topological, nodal, and trivial superconducting states depending on the system parameters. We also consider a 2X2 time-reversal symmetry-breaking chiral flux phase, which has been demonstrated to be energetically favorable in the AV3Sb5 family of superconductors. Incorporating such symmetry-breaking order in our model leads to chiral Majorana edge states defined by a Chern number. We show how the RSO interaction allows for topological phases with even and odd Chern numbers for different system parameters. This work demonstrates how a simple s-wave kagome superconductor with RSO interaction can support helical and chiral Majorana edge states, and motivates the search for Majorana fermions in kagome superconductors.

Abstract: Manipulating electronic orbital states in quantum materials provides a powerful means to control their physical properties and technological functionality. Here, we demonstrate that orbital populations in strongly correlated oxide thin films can be continuously and reversibly tuned through post-synthesis He ion implantation. Using LaNiO$_3$ as a model system, we show that the orbital preference can be systematically adjusted from favoring in-plane d$_{x^2-y^2}$ occupation toward out-of-plane d$_{z^2}$ states through precise control of ion fluence. X-ray linear dichroism measurements reveal this orbital reconstruction, while density functional theory calculations show the effect stems from ion implantation induced changes in unit cell tetragonality. Unlike conventional heteroepitaxial approaches that lock in orbital configurations during growth, this strain doping technique enables continuous orbital tuning and selective modification of specific film regions after device fabrication. We demonstrate the practical impact of this control by achieving a seven-fold enhancement in oxygen reduction reaction catalysis that can be reversibly tuned through the implantation process. This work establishes ion implantation as a powerful approach for orbital engineering that complements existing synthesis-based strategies while offering unique advantages for both basic research and device development.

Title: Dynamical probe of the pseudo Jahn-Teller effect in one-dimensional confined fermions
Authors: André Becker, Georgios M. Koutentakis, Peter Schmelcher
Abstract: We investigate the real-time dynamics of a quenched quantum impurity immersed in a one-dimensional ultracold Fermi gas, focusing on the breakdown of the adiabatic Born-Oppenheimer approximation due to non-adiabatic effects. Despite a sizable impurity-bath mass imbalance, increasing interactions induce strong non-adiabatic couplings, disrupting adiabatic motion and enabling population transfer between the adiabatic potential energy curves. These transitions are governed by conical intersections arising from the pseudo Jahn-Teller effect, dynamically shaping the impurity's motion through the bath. Using ab initio simulations via the Multi-Layer Multi-Configuration Time-Dependent Hartree method and a multi-channel Born-Oppenheimer framework, we track the impurity's evolution and directly prove the dynamical manifestation of the pseudo Jahn-Teller effect. We analyze two key scenarios: (i) a small initial shift, where a single avoided crossing drives transitions, and (ii) a large shift, where multiple avoided crossings lead to enhanced non-adiabaticity, self-trapping, and energy redistribution. Our findings establish ultracold fermionic few-body systems as tunable platforms for studying non-adiabatic quantum dynamics, opening new avenues for controlled impurity transport in strongly correlated environments.

Title: Dielectrocapillarity for exquisite control of fluids
Authors: Anna T. Bui, Stephen J. Cox
Abstract: Spatially varying electric fields are prevalent throughout nature and technology, arising from heterogeneity inherent to all physical systems. Inhomogeneous electric fields can originate naturally, such as in nanoporous materials and biological membranes, or be engineered, e.g., with patterned electrodes or layered van der Waals heterostructures. While uniform fields cause free ions to migrate, for polar fluids they simply act to reorient the constituent molecules. In contrast, electric field gradients (EFGs) induce a dielectrophoretic force, offering exquisite electrokinetic control of a fluid, even in the absence of free charge carriers. EFGs, therefore, offer vast potential for optimizing fluid behavior under confinement, such as in nanoporous electrodes, nanofluidic devices, and chemical separation materials. Yet, EFGs remain largely unexplored at the microscopic level owing to the absence of a rigorous, first principles theoretical treatment of electrostrictive effects. By integrating state-of-the-art advances in liquid state theory and deep learning, we reveal how EFGs modulate fluid structure and capillary phenomena. We demonstrate, from first principles, that dielectrophoretic coupling enables tunable control over the liquid-gas phase transition, capillary condensation, and fluid uptake into porous media. Our findings establish "dielectrocapillarity'' -- the use of EFGs to control confined fluids -- as a powerful tool for controlling volumetric capacity in nanopores, which holds immense potential for optimizing energy storage in supercapacitors, selective gas separation, and tunable hysteresis in neuromorphic nanofluidic devices.

Title: Superconductivity in tin telluride films grown by molecular beam epitaxy
Authors: Antonio Gonzalez, Samuel J. Poage, Bernardo Langa Jr., Deepak Sapkota, Salva Salmani-Rezaie, Shalinee Chikara, Michael D. Williams, David A. Muller, Kasra Sardashti, Kaveh Ahadi
Abstract: The intersection of superconductivity and ferroelectricity hosts a wide range of exotic quantum phenomena. Here, we report on the observation of superconductivity in high-quality tin telluride films grown by molecular beam epitaxy. Unintentionally doped tin telluride undergoes a ferroelectric transition at ~100 K. The critical temperature of superconductivity increases monotonically with indium concentration. The critical field of superconductivity, however, does not follow the same behavior as critical temperature with indium concentration and exhibits a carrier-density-dependent violation of the Pauli limit. The electron-phonon coupling, from the McMillan formula, exhibits a systematic enhancement with indium concentration, suggesting a potential violation of BCS weak coupling at high indium concentrations.

Title: A New Circle Theorem for Two Dimensional Ising Spin Glasses
Authors: Chaoming Song
Abstract: The Lee-Yang circle theorem revolutionized our understanding of phase transitions in ferromagnetic systems by showing that the complex zeros of partition functions lie on the unit circle, with criticality arising as these zeros approach the real axis in the thermodynamic limit. However, in frustrated systems such as antiferromagnets and spin glasses, the zeros deviate from this structure, making it challenging to extend the Lee-Yang theory to disordered systems. In this work, we establish a new circle theorem for two-dimensional Ising spin glasses, proving that the square of the partition function exhibits zeros densely packed along the unit circle. Numerical simulations on the square lattice confirm our theoretical predictions, demonstrating the validity of the circle law for quenched disorder. Furthermore, our results uncover a finite-temperature crossover in $\pm J$ spin glasses, characterized by the emergence of a spectral gap in the angular distribution of zeros. This result extends the Lee-Yang framework to disordered systems, offering new insights into spin-glass criticality.

Title: Two-dimensional antiferromagnets with non-relativistic spin splitting switchable by electric polarization
Authors: Himanshu Mavani, Kai Huang, Kartik Samanta, Evgeny Y. Tsymbal
Abstract: Spin-split antiferromagnets have significance for antiferromagnetic (AFM) spintronics due to their momentum dependent spin polarization which can be exploited for the control and detection of the AFM order parameter. Here, we explore the polar-layer stacking of AFM-ordered bilayers driving the emergence of reversable electric polarization and non-relativistic spin splitting (NRSS) of their band structure. Based on the spin-space group approach, we identify several representative two-dimensional AFM materials which exhibit different types of NRSS when stacked into a polar bilayer. We demonstrate that NRSS can have both altermagnetic and non-altermagnetic origins and elucidate symmetry requirements for NRSS to be switchable by electric polarization. We argue that the electric polarization switching of NRSS in polar AFM bilayers may be more practical for device applications than the current-induced Néel vector switching.

Title: Critical Structural Parameter Determining Magnetic Phases in the Fe2Mo3O8 Altermagnet System
Authors: T. A. Tyson, S. Liu, S. Amarasinghe, K. Wang, S. Chariton, V. Prakapenka, T. Chang, Y.-S. Chen, C. J. Pollock, S.-W. Cheong, M. Abeykoon
Abstract: A systematic structural study of the Fe2Mo3O8 system as a function of pressure, temperature, and magnetic field reveals that the P63mc space group of this material remains stable for a broad range of these parameters. No changes are seen in the long-range structure for pressures between 0 and 10 GPa, temperatures between 11 K and 300 K, and magnetic fields up to 9 T. The magnetostructural response (delta c/c) for a magnetic field transverse to the c-axis displacement is determined. The system is found to exhibit strong magnetostructural coupling. The well-known magnetic field-induced first-order transition is found to be isostructural and accessible by fields in the a-b plane. In terms of the c/a ratio, the structures between ambient pressure and 10 GPa are found to map onto the full Zn doping range ((Fe1-yZny)2Mo3O8, for y=0 to y=1) in this system. The results show that the critical sensitive structural parameter for tuning the magnetic properties with pressure, temperature, and pressure is the c-axis length. The results indicate that the magnetic order found in this complex metal oxide system (A2Mo3O8, A=Co, Mn, and Ni) can be tuned cleanly with pressure, making this class of materials an excellent platform for magnetic order switching for films grown of piezoelectric substrates.

Title: New perspectives on Density-Matrix Embedding Theory
Authors: Alicia Negre, Fabian Faulstich, Raehyun Kim, Thomas Ayral, Lin Lin, Eric Cancès
Abstract: Quantum embedding methods enable the study of large, strongly correlated quantum systems by (usually self-consistent) decomposition into computationally manageable subproblems, in the spirit of divide-and-conquer methods. Among these, Density Matrix Embedding Theory (DMET) is an efficient approach that enforces self-consistency at the level of one-particle reduced density matrices (1-RDMs), facilitating applications across diverse quantum systems. However, conventional DMET is constrained by the requirement that the global 1-RDM (low-level descriptor) be an orthogonal projector, limiting flexibility in bath construction and potentially impeding accuracy in strongly correlated regimes. In this work, we introduce a generalized DMET framework in which the low-level descriptor can be an arbitrary 1-RDM and the bath construction is based on optimizing a quantitative criterion related to the maximal disentanglement between different fragments. This yields an alternative yet controllable bath space construction for generic 1-RDMs, lifting a key limitation of conventional DMET. We demonstrate its consistency with conventional DMET in appropriate limits and exploring its implications for bath construction, downfolding (impurity Hamiltonian construction), low-level solvers, and adaptive fragmentation. We expect that this more flexible framework, which leads to several new variants of DMET, can improve the robustness and accuracy of DMET.

Title: Large symmetry and hierarchical ordering transitions in sliding ferroelectrics
Authors: Benjamin Remez, Moshe Goldstein
Abstract: Van der Waals "sliding" ferroelectric bilayers, whose electric polarization is locked to the interlayer alignment, show promise for future non-volatile memory and other nanoelectronic devices. These applications require a fuller understanding of the polarization stability and switching properties, which present models have described in terms of an Ising-like binary polarization. However, it is a much larger translation symmetry that is broken in the polar state. Here we introduce a discrete statistical-mechanical model that emphasizes the effect of this larger symmetry. Through Monte-Carlo numerics we show this model possesses a richer phase diagram, including an intermediate critical phase of algebraically-correlated polarization. A low energy effective theory allows us to connect the ferroelectric-paraelectric transition to the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless class, driven by excitations not available in Ising-like models. Our results indicate the need for theoretical models of this ferroelectric system to account for the larger symmetry.

Title: Intertwined Nematicity, Multiferroicity, and Nonlinear Hall Effect in Rhombohedral Pentalayer Graphene
Authors: Erin Morissette, Peiyu Qin, K. Watanabe, T. Taniguchi, J.I.A. Li
Abstract: Electronic nematicity-the spontaneous reduction of rotational symmetry-has been widely studied in strongly correlated quantum materials, yet its interplay with other symmetry-breaking phases remains an outstanding experimental challenge to unravel, particularly in van der Waals heterostructures. Here, using angle-resolved transport measurements, we reveal a unique intertwinement of nematicity, orbital multiferroicity, and the nonlinear Hall effect in rhombohedral pentalayer graphene. This coupling enables electric-field-driven switching of the nematic principal axis and the nonlinear Hall polar vector, coinciding with the butterfly-shaped hysteresis of the multiferroic order. We identify two sharply defined nematic phase transitions: the first coincides with the onset of orbital ferromagnetism, while the second, at lower temperatures, aligns with the emergence of ferroelectricity. Our findings point to a nematic-driven instability that intertwines rotational, time-reversal, and inversion symmetry breaking. This is consistent with spontaneous momentum polarization, proposed to occur under the influence of the Coulomb-driven flocking effect. Together, our observations establish nematicity as a fundamental organizing principle in the landscape of intertwined electronic orders in strongly correlated two-dimensional systems.

Title: Quantized crystalline-electromagnetic responses in insulators
Authors: Sachin Vaidya, André Grossi Fonseca, Mark R. Hirsbrunner, Taylor L. Hughes, Marin Soljačić
Abstract: We introduce new classes of gapped topological phases characterized by quantized crystalline-electromagnetic responses, termed "multipolar Chern insulators". These systems are characterized by nonsymmorphic momentum-space symmetries and mirror symmetries, leading to quantization of momentum-weighted Berry curvature multipole moments. We construct lattice models for such phases and confirm their quantized responses through numerical calculations. These systems exhibit bound charge and momentum densities at lattice and magnetic defects, and currents induced by electric or time-varying strain fields. Our work extends the classification of topological matter by uncovering novel symmetry-protected topological phases with quantized responses.

Title: Thermodynamic Bound on Energy and Negentropy Costs of Inference in Deep Neural Networks
Authors: Alexei V. Tkachenko
Abstract: The fundamental thermodynamic bound is derived for the energy cost of inference in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). By applying Landauer's principle, we demonstrate that the linear operations in DNNs can, in principle, be performed reversibly, whereas the non-linear activation functions impose an unavoidable energy cost. The resulting theoretical lower bound on the inference energy is determined by the average number of neurons undergoing state transition for each inference. We also restate the thermodynamic bound in terms of negentropy, a metric which is more universal than energy for assessing thermodynamic cost of information processing. Concept of negentropy is further elaborated in the context of information processing in biological and engineered system as well as human intelligence. Our analysis provides insight into the physical limits of DNN efficiency and suggests potential directions for developing energy-efficient AI architectures that leverage reversible analog computing.

Title: Oscillate and Renormalize: Fast Phonons Reshape the Kondo Effect in Flat Band Systems
Authors: Liam L.H. Lau, Andreas Gleis, Daniel Kaplan, Premala Chandra, Piers Coleman
Abstract: We examine the interplay between electron correlations and phonons in an Anderson-Holstein impurity model with an Einstein phonon. When the phonons are slow compared to charge fluctuations (frequency $\omega_0 \ll U/2$, the onsite Coulomb scale $U/2$), we demonstrate analytically that the expected phonon-mediated reduction of interactions is completely suppressed, even in the strong coupling regime. This suppression arises from the oscillator's inability to respond to rapid charge fluctuations, manifested as a compensation effect between the polaronic cloud and the excited-state phonons associated with valence fluctuations. We identify a novel frozen mixed valence phase, above a threshold dimensionless electron-phonon coupling $\alpha^*$ when the phonons are slow, where the static phonon cloud locks the impurity into specific valence configurations, potentially explaining the puzzling coexistence of mixed valence behavior and insulating properties in materials like rust. Conversely, when the phonon is fast ($\omega_0 \gtrsim U/2$), the system exhibits conventional polaronic behavior with renormalized onsite interactions effectively $U_{\text{eff}}$ due to phonon mediated attraction, with additional satellite features in the local spectral function due to phonon excitations. Using numerical renormalization group (NRG) calculations, a fully dynamic renormalization technique, we confirm these behaviors in both regimes. These findings have important implications for strongly correlated systems where phonon energy scales may be comparable to the Coulomb scale, such as in twisted bilayer graphene, necessitating careful consideration of interaction renormalizations in theoretical models.

Title: Engineered substrates for domain control in CrSe thin-film growth: Single-domain formation on lattice-matched YSZ(111) substrate
Authors: Yusuke Tajima, Junichi Shiogai, Masayuki Ochi, Kazutaka Kudo, Jobu Matsuno
Abstract: Epitaxial thin-film growth is a versatile and powerful technique for achieving a precise control of composition, stabilizing non-equilibrium phases, tailoring growth orientation, as well as forming heterointerfaces of various quantum materials. For synthesis of highly crystalline thin films, in-depth understanding of epitaxial relationship between the desired thin film and the single-crystalline substrates is necessary. In this study, we investigate epitaxial relationship in thin-film growth of triangular-lattice antiferromagnet CrSe on the (001) plane of Al2O3 and the lattice-matched (111) plane of yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) substrates. Structural characterization using out-of-plane and in-plane x-ray diffraction shows that the presence of 19.1o-twisted domains of CrSe significantly dominates the aligned domain on the Al2O3 substrate while it reveals a single-domain formation on the YSZ substrate. The stability of the 19.1o-twisted domain rather than the aligned domain can be explained by rotational commensurate epitaxy, which is well reproduced by density functional theory calculations. The single-domain CrSe thin film on the YSZ substrate exhibits a superior metallic conductivity compared to the twisted-domain thin film on the Al2O3 substrate, implying contribution of the grain boundary scattering mechanism to electrical transport.

Title: Quantum Spin Correlation Amplification Enables Macroscopic Detection of Atomic-Level Fatigue in Ferromagnetic Metals
Authors: Benniu Zhang, Liangshuo Zhang, Xiaodong Wu, Jigang Yu, Xiaochuan Cao, Zhijian Zhang, Xin Li, Fupeng Zhou, Jinglin Pan, Haifei Jiang, Gang Zheng
Abstract: Structural fatigue failures account for most of catastrophic metal component failures, annually causing thousands of accidents, tens of thousands of casualties, and $100 billion in global economic losses. Current detection methods struggle to identify early-stage fatigue damage characterized by sub-nanometer atomic displacements and localized bond rupture. Here we present a quantum-enhanced monitoring framework leveraging the fundamental symbiosis between metallic bonding forces and magnetic interactions. Through magnetic excitation of quantum spin correlation in metallic structures, we establish a macroscopic quantum spin correlation amplification technology that visualizes fatigue-induced magnetic flux variations corresponding to bond strength degradation. Our multi-scale analysis integrates fatigue life prediction with quantum mechanical parameters (bonding force constants, crystal orbital overlap population) and ferromagnetic element dynamics, achieving unprecedented prediction accuracy (R^2>0.9, p<0.0001). In comprehensive fatigue trials encompassing 193 ferromagnetic metal specimens across 3,700 testing hours, this quantum magnetic signature consistently provided macroscopic fracture warnings prior to failure - a critical advance enabling 100% early detection success. This transformative framework establishes the first operational platform for preemptive fatigue mitigation in critical infrastructure, offering a paradigm shift from post-failure analysis to quantum-enabled predictive maintenance.

Title: Rapid analysis of point-contact Andreev reflection spectra via machine learning with adaptive data augmentation
Authors: Dongik Lee, Valentin Stanev, Xiaohang Zhang, Mijeong Kang, Ichiro Takeuchi, Seunghun Lee
Abstract: Delineating the superconducting order parameters is a pivotal task in investigating superconductivity for probing pairing mechanisms, as well as their symmetry and topology. Point-contact Andreev reflection (PCAR) measurement is a simple yet powerful tool for identifying the order parameters. The PCAR spectra exhibit significant variations depending on the type of the order parameter in a superconductor, including its magnitude ($\mathit{\Delta}$), as well as temperature, interfacial quality, Fermi velocity mismatch, and other factors. The information on the order parameter can be obtained by finding the combination of these parameters, generating a theoretical spectrum that fits a measured experimental spectrum. However, due to the complexity of the spectra and the high dimensionality of parameters, extracting the fitting parameters is often time-consuming and labor-intensive. In this study, we employ a convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm to create models for rapid and automated analysis of PCAR spectra of various superconductors with different pairing symmetries (conventional $s$-wave, chiral $p_x+ip_y$-wave, and $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave). The training datasets are generated based on the Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk (BTK) theory and further modified and augmented by selectively incorporating noise and peaks according to the bias voltages. This approach not only replicates the experimental spectra but also brings the model's attention to important features within the spectra. The optimized models provide fitting parameters for experimentally measured spectra in less than 100 ms per spectrum. Our approaches and findings pave the way for rapid and automated spectral analysis which will help accelerate research on superconductors with complex order parameters.

Title: Locating the Atoms at the Hard-soft Interface of Gold Nanoparticles
Authors: Weilun Li, Bryan D. Esser, Wenming Tong, Anchal Yadav, Colin Ophus, Changlin Zheng, Scott D. Findlay, Timothy Petersen, Alison M. Funston, Joanne Etheridge
Abstract: Surface structure affects the growth, shape and properties of nanoparticles. In wet chemical syntheses, metal additives and surfactants are used to modify surfaces and guide nanocrystal growth. To understand this process, it is critical to understand how the surface structure is modified. However, measuring the type and arrangement of atoms at hard-soft interfaces on nanoscale surfaces, especially in the presence of surfactants, is extremely challenging. Here, we determine the atomic structure of the hard-soft interface in a metallic nanoparticle by developing low-dose imaging conditions in four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy that are preferentially sensitive to surface adatoms. By revealing experimentally the copper additives and bromide surfactant counterion at the surface of a gold nanocuboid and quantifying their interatomic distances, our direct, low-dose imaging method provides atomic-level understanding of chemically sophisticated nanomaterial surface structures. These measurements of the atomic structure of the hard-soft interface provide the information necessary to understand and quantify surface chemistries and energies and their pivotal role in nanocrystal growth.

Title: Structure factors and quantum geometry in multiband BCS superconductors
Authors: M. Iskin
Abstract: We consider multiband BCS superconductors that exhibit time-reversal symmetry and uniform pairing, and analyze their dynamic density and spin structure factors using linear-response theory within the mean-field BCS-BEC crossover framework at zero temperature. Our results for the multi-orbital Hubbard model satisfy the associated f-sum rules in several limits. In particular, in the strong-coupling limit, they coincide with those of a weakly-interacting Bose gas of Cooper pairs, where the low-energy collective Goldstone modes serve as Bogoliubov phonons. We further reveal that the quantum-geometric origin of the low-energy structure factors, along with related observables such as the superfluid-weight tensor and the effective-mass tensor of Cooper pairs, can be traced all the way back to the effective-mass theorem for Bloch bands in this limit. As an illustration, we investigate the pyrochlore-Hubbard model numerically and demonstrate that the Goldstone modes are the only relevant collective degrees of freedom in the flat-band regime.

Title: Magnetotransport evidence of a potential low-lying Dirac node in NbAl$_3$
Authors: Ying Kit Tsui, Chia-Nung Kuo, Makoto Shimizu, Yajian Hu, Youichi Yanase, Chin Shan Lue, Wei Zhang, Swee K. Goh
Abstract: NbAl$_3$ is a novel semimetal with a type-II Dirac node ~230 meV above the Fermi energy. We have performed both out-of-plane ($B\parallel c$) and in-plane magnetotransport measurements ($B\perp c$) on single-crystalline NbAl$_3$. In our out-of-plane data, we observe an interesting linear component in the transverse magnetoresistance, and the mobility spectrum analysis of the out-of-plane data reveals an emergence of high-mobility electrons at low temperatures. Near $B\parallel c$, Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations are discerned in the magnetoresistance. The oscillation frequencies agree with the density functional theory calculation, the same theory that shows that the Dirac node is far above the Fermi energy. Therefore, the out-of-plane results cannot be attributed to the type-II Dirac node but suggest NbAl$_3$ has additional Dirac or Weyl nodes close to the Fermi energy. To support this, we examine the in-plane data obtained with the magnetic field perpendicular to the tilting direction of the type-II Dirac cone. Such field direction excludes the possibility of chiral anomaly from the predicted type-II Dirac node. Remarkably, we observe the planar Hall effect, anisotropic magnetoresistance, and negative longitudinal magnetoresistance. These in-plane results are a strong indication of chiral anomaly unrelated to the previously established type-II Dirac node, pointing to the presence of additional Dirac or Weyl nodes near the Fermi energy. Our new density functional theory calculation reveals a type-I Dirac node ~50 meV below the Fermi energy that has previously been overlooked. We argue that the exotic transport phenomena observed in NbAl$_3$ can be attributed to the newly identified type-I Dirac node.

Title: Non-linear vortex dynamics in the mixed state of superconducting a-MoGe and NbN thin films using low-frequency two-coil mutual inductance technique
Authors: Somak Basistha, Soumyajit Mandal, John Jesudasan, Vivas Bagwe, Pratap Raychaudhuri
Abstract: We use a two-coil mutual inductance technique to investigate the non-linear response of the vortex lattice of two type-II superconducting thin films, namely a very weakly pinned amorphous Molybdenum Germanium (a-MoGe) and a moderate-to-strongly pinned Niobium Nitride (NbN). We observe a strong dependence of the magnetic shielding response of the superconductors on the ac excitation amplitude in the primary coil of the two-coil setup. The sample response is studied through the evolution of the radial profile of the induced current density with increasing drive amplitude, which gets significantly modified by the effect of flux creep. We develop a computation scheme where we iteratively combine the coupled Maxwell-London equations for the geometry of the two coils and the sample involved, with a model developed by Coffey and Clem, to analyze the non-linear ac response. The central result of this analysis is that the effect of flux creep gives rise to a strong nonlinearity in the electrodynamic response in the vortex state of the superconducting thin films, that extends down to very low amplitudes of ac excitation. Our results also show that at subcritical low frequency ac drives, the vortex viscosity is exponentially larger than the Bardeen-Stephen estimate. We present a simple scheme to obtain the intrinsic value of the pinning force constant, which otherwise gets affected due to flux creep even at very low ac drives and point out some outstanding issues that need to be addressed in future theoretical and experimental studies.

Title: Nonequilibrium hysteretic phase transitions in periodically light-driven superconductors
Authors: Huanyu Zhang, Kazuaki Takasan, Naoto Tsuji
Abstract: We find nonequilibrium phase transitions accompanied by multiple (nested) hysteresis behaviors in superconductors coupled to baths under a time-periodic light this http URL transitions are demonstrated with a full phase diagram in the domain of the driving amplitude and frequency by means of the Floquet many-body theory. In the weak driving regime with a frequency smaller than half of the superconducting gap, excited quasiparticles are accumulated at the far edges of the bands, realizing a distribution reminiscent of the Eliashberg effect, which suddenly becomes unstable in the strong driving regime due to multi-photon-assisted tunneling across the gap mediated by the in-gap Floquet sidebands. We also show that superconductivity is enhanced in the weak driving regime without effective cooling, which is attributed to the modulation of the spectrum due to Floquet sidebands.

Title: Rotation-mediated bosonic Josephson junctions in position and momentum spaces
Authors: Sunayana Dutta, Ofir E. Alon
Abstract: In ultracold atoms, bosons tunneling in a double-well potential can produce a typical Josephson junction in real space. A major advancement in quantum matter and simulations is anticipated by the recently found momentum-space Josephson junction effect, which elucidates the supercurrent flow between spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensates at two distinct independent momentum states. For the first time, our study unveils specific protocols to engineer momentum-space Josephson dynamics for scalar bosons (or a single-component condensate) in a rotating frame through modulation of the geometry of a double-well trapping potential and rotation frequencies. In this setup, rotation simultaneously results in effective double wells both in position and in momentum spaces, and the dynamics of the corresponding Josephson junctions is hosted in these double wells. Consequently, it is observed that the rotation generates momentum-space Josephson dynamics of the condensate along the transverse direction and position-space Josephson dynamics along the longitudinal direction; these effects are particularly noticeable for high rotation frequencies. Additionally, the rotation-induced momentum-space effects are highly significant in both the mean-field and many-body dynamics. Our protocols offer a framework for investigating momentum-space Josephson effects for single-component condensate in both theoretical and experimental contexts, as well as their significant applications in quantum mechanical devices.

Title: Ab Initio Framework of Electron-Phonon Coupling for Chiral Phonons with Giant Phonon Magnetic Moments in Magnetic Materials
Authors: Fuyi Wang, Xinqi Liu, Hong Sun, Huaiqiang Wang, Shuichi Marakami, Lifa Zhang, Haijun Zhang, Dingyu Xing
Abstract: Chiral phonons, characterized by nonzero angular momenta and magnetic moments, have attracted extensive attention. However, this field remains severely limited due to the inability to accurately account for electron-phonon-coupling (EPC) effects for chiral phonons. Here, we resolve this challenge through developing an ab initio framework for computing EPC-driven phonon magnetic properties, applicable to all insulating and metallic materials. Our theory predicts a dramatic enhancement of phonon magnetic moments exceeding classical predictions by multiple orders, accompanied by distinct Zeeman splitting. Interestingly, these splittings induce observable topological gaps in phonon spectra of magnets, generating intrinsic phonon Chern states. Through first-principles calculations, we identify five topological phonon magnets with intrinsic phonon Chern states and also propose to detect low-energy neutral particles such as dark matters. This research not only establishes a computational framework for investigating EPC-driven phonon magnetic properties, but also provides a material design strategy for realizing topological phonon states in quantum magnetic materials.

Title: Memory effect by coupling between translational and rotational Brownian motion in water-ethanol mixtures
Authors: Ken Judai, Satoshi Shibuta, Kazuki Furukawa
Abstract: The Brownian motion in water-ethanol mixtures exhibits abnormally large displacements. Using falling-ball viscometry applied to colloidal particles, we experimentally verified that no anomaly exists in the viscosity coefficient of the solution. Our findings reveal that the anomalous Brownian motion can be attributed to the memory effect arising from the coupling between rotational and translational motion. It was deduced that the relaxation time of sub-microsecond rotational motion serves as a memory effect, influencing translational motion and leading to anomalously large Brownian displacements over a timescale of seconds. This study demonstrates that short-time memory effects can be effectively investigated through long-duration measurements.

Title: Quantum Spin Liquid phases in Kitaev Materials
Authors: Po-Hao Chou, Chung-Yu Mou, Chung-Hou Chung, Sungkit Yip
Abstract: We develop a gauge-invariant renormalized mean-field theory (RMFT) method, to reliably find the quantum spin liquid (QSL) states and their field response in realistic Kitaev materials. Remarkably, while our RMFT reproduces previous results based on more complicated numerical methods, it also predicts several new stable QSL states. In particular, since Kitaev spin liquid(KSL) is no longer a saddle point solution, a new exotic 2-cone state distinct from the KSL, is found to describe the experimental observations well, and hence the candidate state be realized in the Kitaev material, {\alpha}-RuCl3. We further explore the mechanism for the suppression of the observed thermal Hall conductivity at low temperatures within the fermionic framework, and show the theoretical polarangle dependence of fermionic gap that can distinguish the found 2-cone state from the KSL state in further experiment.

Title: Formulation of spin Nernst effect for spin-nonconserving insulating magnets
Authors: Shinnosuke Koyama, Joji Nasu
Abstract: The spin Nernst effect, an antisymmetric response of a spin current to a temperature gradient, has attracted attention as spin transport phenomenon arising from the topologically nontrivial band structure of carriers. This effect can occur not only in itinerant electron systems but also in localized electron systems that emerge due to electronic correlations. In such systems, elementary excitations behaving as bosons govern spin transport, and magnetic interactions originating from spin-orbit coupling can induce a topologically nontrivial band structure. However, such magnetic interactions can potentially break spin conservation, thereby preventing conventional spin currents from being conserved. In this study, starting from a general localized electron model, we formulate the spin Nernst effect in terms of a conserved spin current that remains applicable even in spin-nonconserving systems. To address the torque term appearing in the conserved spin current, we adopt semiclassical theory and derive an expression for the spin Nernst coefficient for bosonic systems. This coefficient consists of two terms originating from the Berry curvature and the quantum metric, which are distinctly different from the spin Berry curvature obtained in an approach that neglects the torque term. We apply our framework to two specific quantum spin models, the Kitaev-Heisenberg and Shastry-Sutherland models, and calculate the temperature dependence of the spin Nernst coefficient. We find that this quantity significantly differs from that obtained by neglecting the torque term in both models. Furthermore, we clarify that the impact of the torque term on the spin Nernst effect strongly depends on the model parameters, suggesting that our formulation based on the conserved spin current is essential for understanding this effect in insulating magnets.

Abstract: Spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnetic frustrated spin chain systems display exotic ground states with unconventional excitations and distinct quantum phase transitions as the ratio of next-nearest-neighbor to nearest-neighbor coupling is tuned. We present a comprehensive investigation of the structural, magnetic, and thermodynamics properties of the spin-1/2 compound, Cu(Ampy)ClBr (Ampy= C6H8N2 = 2-(Aminomethyl)pyridine) via x-ray diffraction, magnetization, specific heat, 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), electron spin resonance (ESR), and muon spin relaxation (muSR) techniques. The crystal structure features an anisotropic triangular chain lattice of magnetic Cu2+ ions. Our bulk and local probe experiments detect neither long-range magnetic ordering nor spin freezing down to 0.06 K despite the presence of moderate antiferromagnetic interaction between Cu2+ spins as reflected by a Curie-Weiss temperature of about -9 K from the bulk susceptibility data. A broad maximum is observed at about 9 K in magnetic susceptibility and specific heat data, indicating the onset of short-range spin correlations. At low temperatures, the zero-field magnetic specific heat and the 1H NMR spin-lattice relaxation rate follow an exponential temperature dependence, indicating the presence of gapped magnetic excitations. Furthermore, persistent spin dynamics down to 0.088 K observed by zero-field muSR evidences lack of any static magnetism. We attribute these experimental results to the stabilization of a dimer-singlet phase in the presence of a next-near neighbor interaction and of a randomness in the exchange coupling driven by Cl/Br mixing.

Title: A Fluctuation Theory of Transport Properties in Liquid-Phase Solutions
Authors: Yury A. Budkov, Nikolai N. Kalikin, Petr E. Brandyshev
Abstract: The challenge of comprehensively describing liquids and their mixtures beyond equilibrium continues to be a main concern in modern chemical physics and physical chemistry, particularly in the context of calculating the transport properties of liquid-phase systems. This paper presents a step towards a phenomenological nonequilibrium theory tailored for multicomponent liquid-phase solutions. This field-theoretical framework, grounded in the principles of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics, integrates quasi-stationary concentration fluctuations consistent with equilibrium liquid theory as described by classical density functional theory. This approach, which is a phenomenological extension of the well-known Dean-Kawasaki stochastic density functional theory, allows for the computation of practically important transport properties such as mobility and shear viscosity. We apply our approach to the calculation of the corresponding quantities for solutions with a single solute. We derive general formulas for the mobility of solute molecules and the shear viscosity of a single-solute solution. Based on these findings, we present new results and reproduce previously established results for systems such as the Gaussian-core model, one-component plasma, and near-critical solutions.

Title: Dynamical response theory of interacting Majorana fermions and its application to generic Kitaev quantum spin liquids in a field
Authors: Peng Rao, Roderich Moessner, Johannes Knolle
Abstract: Motivated by the appearance of Majorana fermions in a broad range of correlated and topological electronic systems, we develop a general method to compute the dynamical response of interacting Majorana fermions in the random-phase approximation (RPA). This can be applied self-consistently on top of Majorana mean-field theory (MFT) backgrounds, thereby in particular providing a powerful tool to analyse $\textit{generic}$ behaviour in the vicinity of (various heavily studied) exactly soluble models. Prime examples are quantum spin liquids (QSL) with emergent Majorana excitations, with the celebrated exact solution of Kitaev. We employ the RPA to study in considerable detail phase structure and dynamics of the extended Kitaev honeycomb $KJ\Gamma$-model, with and without an applied field. First, we benchmark our method with Kitaev's exactly soluble model, finding a remarkable agreement. The interactions between Majorana fermions even turn out to mimic the effect of local $\mathbb{Z}_2$ flux excitations, which we explain analytically. Second, we show how small non-Kitaev couplings $J$ and $\Gamma$ induce Majorana bound states, resulting in sharp features in the dynamical structure factor in the presence of fractionalisation: such 'spinon excitons' naturally appear, and can coexist and interact with the broad Majorana continuum. Third, for increasing couplings or field, our theory predicts instabilities of the KQSL triggered by the condensation of the sharp modes. From the high symmetry momenta of the condensation we can deduce which magnetically ordered phases surround the KQSL, in good agreement with previous finite-size numerics. We discuss implications for experiments and the broad range of applicability of our method to other QSL and Majorana systems.

Title: Complex Frequency Detection in a Subsystem
Authors: Juntao Huang, Jiangping Hu, Zhesen Yang
Abstract: In this study, we systematically explore the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) and its associated complex-frequency detection in the context of a frequency-dependent non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. This Hamiltonian arises from the self-energy correction of the subsystem and can be calculated exactly within our theoretical model, without the need for non-Hermitian approximations. Additionally, complex frequency detection, which encompasses complex frequency excitation, synthesis, and fingerprint, enables us to detect the physical responses driven by complex frequency excitations. Our calculations reveal that both complex frequency excitation and synthesis are sensitive to the non-Hermitian approximation and are unable to characterize the presence or abscence of the NHSE. In contrast, the complex-frequency fingerprint successfully detects the novel responses induced by the NHSE through the introduction of a double-frequency Green's function. Our work paves the way for a rigorous understanding of non-Hermitian physics in quantum systems and their experimental verification through complex frequency-domain techniques.

Title: Plasmon-Mediated Hybridization of Wannier-Mott and Frenkel Excitons in a Monolayer WS2 -- J-Aggregate Hybrid System
Authors: Nicolas Zorn Morales, Daniel Steffen Rühl, Sergey Sadofev, Emil List-Kratochvil, Sylke Blumstengel
Abstract: We present a tunable plasmonic platform that allows room temperature hybridization of dissimilar excitons, namely of Wannier-Mott excitons in monolayer (1L) WS2 and Frenkel excitons in molecular J-aggregates via simultaneous strong coupling to surface plasmon polaritons. It is based on a simple layered design consisting of a thin planar silver film and a dielectric spacer on which monolayer and the aggregates are assembled. Strong coupling is revealed by angle-dependent spectroscopic ellipsometry measurements in total internal reflection geometry by the observation of double Rabi splitting at the two excitonic resonances. We analyze the exciton-exciton-plasmon system with the coupled oscillator model and demonstrate modulation of polariton character and dynamics by the number of molecules participating in the coupling. Furthermore, we propose a route to remotely control the mode splitting at the Frenkel excitonic resonance via electrostatic gating of the 1L-WS2 and to switch the molecule-plasmon interaction between the weak and strong coupling regime.

Title: Coherent cellular dynamical mean-field theory: a real-space quantum embedding approach to disorder in strongly correlated electron systems
Authors: Patrick Tscheppe, Marcel Klett, Henri Menke, Sabine Andergassen, Niklas Enderlein, Philipp Hansmann, Thomas Schäfer
Abstract: We formulate a quantum embedding algorithm in real-space for the simultaneous theoretical treatment of nonlocal electronic correlations and disorder, the coherent cellular dynamical mean-field theory (C-CDMFT). This algorithm combines the molecular coherent potential approximation with the cellular dynamical mean-field theory. After a pedagogical introduction to quantum embedding theories for disordered and interacting electron systems, and a detailed discussion of its work flow, we present first results from C-CDMFT for the half-filled two-dimensional Anderson-Hubbard model on a square lattice: (i) the analysis of its Mott metal-insulator transition as a function of disorder strength, and (ii) the impact of different types of disorder on its magnetic phase diagram. For the latter, by means of a "disorder diagnostics", we are able to precisely identify the contributions of different disorder configurations to the system's magnetic response.

Title: Prediction of two-dimensional ferromagnetic VO$_2$ layers in the hexagonal and tetragonal phases
Authors: Lihui Han, Lujia Tian, Bing-Xin Liu, Zong-liang Li, Miao Gao, Fengjie Ma, Xun-Wang Yan
Abstract: Ferromagnetism in the two-dimensional materials is of great significance and has become an emerging topic. The ferromagnetic VS$_2$ and VSe$_2$ monolayers have been experimentally synthesized, and O element belongs to the same group as S and Se elements. Thus, whether there exists the ferromagnetic VO$_2$ monolayer is a necessary and urgent question. Using first-principles methods within the framework of density functional theory, we predict two kinds of VO$_2$ monolayers with the hexagonal and tetragonal phases and investigate their structural stability, electronic and magnetic properties, and ferromagnetic phase transition. The computational results demonstrate that the two two-dimensional structural phases are stable and possess the ferromagnetic ground states, and they are half-metal with large energy gap. In addition, by solving the Heisenberg model with the Monte Carlo simulation methods, the ferromagnetic phase transition at 270 K in the hexagonal phase is determined. These findings not only predict a new type of intrinsic half-metallic ferromagnet with a high Curie temperature but also fill in an important gap that are lacking in the series of studies from VO$_2$, VS$_2$, VSe$_2$, to VTe$_2$.

Title: Effects of Homogeneous Doping on Electron-Phonon Coupling in SrTiO3
Authors: Minwoo Park, Suk Bum Chung
Abstract: Bulk n-type SrTiO3 (STO) has long been known to possess a superconducting ground state at an exceptionally dilute carrier density. This has raised questions about the applicability of the BCS-Eliashberg paradigm with its underlying adiabatic assumption. However, recent experimental reports have set the pairing gap to the critical temperature (Tc) ratio at the BCS value for superconductivity in Nb-doped STO, even though the adiabaticity condition the BCS pairing requires is satisfied over the entire superconducting dome only by the lowest branch of optical phonons. In spite of the strong implications these reports have on specifying the pairing glue, they have not proved sufficient in explaining the magnitude of the optimal doping. This motivated us to apply density functional theory to Nb-doped STO to analyze how the phonon band structures and the electron-phonon coupling evolve with doping. To describe the very low doping concentration, we tuned the homogeneous background charge, from which we obtained a first-principles result on the doping-dependent phonon frequency that is in good agreement with experimental data for Nb-doped STO. Using the EPW code, we obtain the doping-dependent phonon dispersion and the electron-phonon coupling strength. Within the framework of our calculation, we found that the electron-phonon coupling forms a dome in a doping range lower than the experimentally observed superconducting dome of the Nb-doped STO. Additionally, we examined the doping dependence of both the orbital angular momentum quenching in the electron-phonon coupling and the phonon displacement correlation length and found the former to have a strong correlation with our electron-phonon coupling in the overdoped region.

Title: Topotactic Reduction-Driven Crystal Field Excitations in Brownmillerite Manganite Thin Films
Authors: Feng Jin, Shiyu Fan, Mingqiang Gu, Qiming Lv, Min Ge, Zixun Zhang, Jinfeng Zhang, Jingdi Lu, Taehun Kim, Vivek Bhartiya, Zhen Huang, Lingfei Wang, Valentina Bisogni, Jonathan Pelliciari, Wenbin Wu
Abstract: Topotactic reduction of perovskite oxides offers a powerful approach for discovering novel phenomena, such as superconducting infinite-layer nickelates and polar metallicity, and is commonly accompanied by the emergence of multiple valence states and/or complex crystal fields of transition metals. However, understanding the complex interplay between crystal chemistry, electronic structure, and physical properties at the spin- and orbital-resolved levels in these reduced systems remains elusive. Here, we combine x-ray absorption spectroscopy, resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS), and density functional theory calculations to uncover topotactic metal-insulator transition and orbital-specific crystal field excitations in brownmillerite La0.67Ca0.33MnO2.5 thin films. We reveal the Mn valence states to be predominantly Mn2+/Mn3+, along with their corresponding populations at octahedral and tetrahedral sites, which effectively weaken the Mn-O hybridization compared to the parent perovskite phase. As a result, La0.67Ca0.33MnO2.5 films exhibit an antiferromagnetic insulating ground state. Moreover, by combining the RIXS measurements on selected single-valence manganites, specifically MnO, LaMnO3, and CaMnO3, with orbital- and spin-resolved density-of-states calculations, we identify the dd excitations of octahedrally and tetrahedrally coordinated Mn2+/Mn3+ ions, directly linking the microscopic electronic structure to the macroscopic magnetic/electrical properties.

Title: Use of frit-disc crucible sets to make solution growth more quantitative and versatile
Authors: Paul C. Canfield, Tyler J. Slade
Abstract: The recent availability of step-edge, frit-disc crucible sets (generally sold as Canfield Crucible Sets or CCS) has led to multiple innovations associated with our group's use of solution growth. Use of CCS allows for the clean separation of liquid from solid phases during the growth process. This clean separation enables the reuse of the decanted liquid, either allowing for simple, economic, savings associated with recycling expensive precursor elements or allowing for the fractionation of a growth into multiple, small steps, revealing the progression of multiple solidifications. Clean separation of liquid from solid phases also allows for the determination of the liquidus line (or surface) and the creation, or correction, of composition-temperature phase diagrams. The reuse of clean decanted liquid has also allowed us to prepare liquids ideally suited for the growth of large single crystals of specific phases by tuning the composition of the melt to the optimal composition for growth of the desired phase, often with reduced nucleation sites. Finally, we discuss how solution growth and CCS use can be harnessed to provide a plethora of composition-temperature data points defining liquidus lines or surfaces with differing degrees of precision to either test or anchor artificial intelligence and/or machine learning based attempts to augment and extend the limited experimentally determined data base.

Title: Reexamining Circular Dichroism in Photoemission From a Topological Insulator

Abstract: The orbital angular momentum (OAM) of electron states is an essential ingredient for topological and quantum geometric quantities in solids. For example, Dirac surface states with helical spin- and orbital-angular momenta are a hallmark of a 3D topological insulator. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) with variable circular light polarization, known as circular dichroism (CD), has been assumed to be a direct probe of OAM and, by proxy, of the Berry curvature of electronic bands in energy- and momentum-space. Indeed, topological surface states have been shown to exhibit angle-dependent CD (CDAD), and more broadly, CD is often interpreted as evidence of spin-orbit coupling. Meanwhile, it is well-established that CD originates from the photoemission matrix elements, which can have extrinsic contributions related to the experimental geometry and the inherently broken inversion symmetry at the sample surface. Therefore, it is important to broadly examine CD-ARPES to determine the scenarios in which it provides a robust probe of intrinsic material physics. We performed CD-ARPES on the canonical topological insulator $\mathrm{Bi}_2\mathrm{Se}_3$ over a wide range of incident photon energies. Not only do we observe angle-dependent CD in the surface states, as expected, but we also find CD of a similar magnitude in virtually all bulk bands. Since OAM is forbidden by inversion symmetry in the bulk, we conclude this originates from symmetry-breaking in the photoemission process. Comparison with theoretical calculations supports this view and suggests that $\textit{hidden}$ OAM - localized to atomic sites within each unit cell - contributes significantly. Additional effects, including inter-atomic interference and final-state resonances, are responsible for the rapid variation of the CDAD signal with photon energy.

Title: Emerging orthorhombic two-dimensional van der Waals magnets
Authors: Xiaoyu Guo, Wenhao Liu, Bing Lv, Liuyan Zhao
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) magnetism realized in van der Waals (vdW) materials has expanded to include a great variety of magnetic phases, over a short decade since its first discovery in 2016-2017. However, most of the investigated vdW magnets so far have highly symmetric crystal fields and isotropic in-plane lattice structures, making their 2D magnetism robust but often classical and expected. In this Perspective, we highlight a family of vdW magnets that have distorted crystal fields with low symmetries and orthorhombic crystal lattices with strong anisotropy, and furthermore, show their prospects for realizing a much richer landscape of magnetic phases and phase transitions. First, we introduce the classification of 2D vdW magnets based on their crystal fields and make a contrast between the orthorhombic vdW magnets of focus here and other popular honeycomb/hexagonal/kagome vdW magnets. We then discuss the material candidates, the emergent properties, and the designed controls for these orthorhombic 2D vdW magnets, using the representative CrSBr as an example and extending beyond it. Finally, we discuss a few existing challenges in orthorhombic 2D vdW magnets, overcome which would pave the way towards magneto-optical, opto-magnetic, and spintronic devices based on orthorhombic 2D vdW magnetism.

Title: Symmetry Breaking during Low-Temperature Domain Formation in Micron-sized Magnetite Crystals
Authors: Yue Dong, David Yang, Jialun Liu, Aly Abdeldaim, Wei Wang, Ian Robinson
Abstract: We report the results of synchrotron Bragg Coherent X-ray Diffraction Imaging (BCDI) experiments to investigate domain formation in a micron-sized magnetite crystal undergoing the Verwey transition at low temperature. A strong splitting of the measured 311 Bragg reflection was observed in the low-temperature phase, indicating the formation of domains. BCDI revealed pronounced strain distributions, characterized by a clear layered stripe domain structure in real-space. Stripes were seen only along the [001] crystallographic direction, normal to the substrate surface direction, breaking the symmetry of the cubic high-temperature phase. It is argued that other domain directions were suppressed by the sample mounting orientation. More surprisingly, only a single domain orientation was observed, suggesting an additional symmetry-breaking influence originating from the shape of the crystal.

Title: Comment on Boosting large scale capacitive harvesting of osmotic power by dynamical matching of ion exchange kinetics
Authors: Nan Wu, Mathieu BA Freville, Zhiyi Man, Adérito Fins Carreira, Timothée Derkenne, Corentin Tregouet, Annie Colin
Abstract: This article is a comment of N. Chapuis and L. Bocquet, Sustainable Energy Fuels, 2025, DOI: https://doi.org/10.1039/D4SE01366B which title is "Boosting large scale capacitive harvesting of osmotic power by dynamical matching of ion exchange kinetics". In this work, the authors present an experimental process that shows how it is possible to set up a reverse electrodialysis cell capable of achieving power values of 5 W/m2. This value is the profitability threshold. Our work challenges this claim and questions whether the proposed technique can be scaled up, as well as the modeling of the process.

Title: Imaging Ultrafast Dynamical Diffraction wavefronts of femtosecond laser-induced lattice distortions inside crystalline semiconductors
Authors: Angel Rodríguez-Fernández, Jan-Etienne Pudell, Roman Shayduk, Wonhyuk Jo, James Wrigley, Johannes Möller, Peter Zalden, Alexey Zozulya, Jörg Hallmann, Anders Madsen, Pablo Villanueva-Perez, Zdenek Matej, Thies J.

Abstract: Material processing with femtosecond lasers has attracted enormous attention because of its potential for technology and industry applications. In parallel, time-resolved x-ray diffraction has been successfully used to study ultrafast structural distortion dynamics in semiconductor thin films. Gracing incident x-ray geometry has been also used to look to distortion dynamics, but this technique is only sensitive to the surface of bulk materials with a limited temporal resolution. However, 'real-world' processing applications deal mostly with bulk materials, which prevent the use of such techniques. For processing applications, a fast and depth-sensitive probe is needed. To address this, we present a novel technique based on ultrafast dynamical diffraction (UDD) capable of imaging transient strain distributions inside bulk crystals upon single-pulse excitation. This pump-probe technique provides a complete picture of the temporal evolution of ultrafast distortion depth profiles. Our measurements were obtained in a thin crystalline Si wafer upon single pulse femtosecond optical excitation revealing that even below the melting threshold strong lattice distortions appear on ps time scales due to the formation and propagation of high-amplitude strain waves into the bulk.

Authors: Ao Chen, Vighnesh Dattatraya Naik, Markus Heyl
Abstract: Deep neural quantum states have recently achieved remarkable performance in solving challenging quantum many-body problems. While transformer networks appear particularly promising due to their success in computer science, we show that previously reported transformer wave functions haven't so far been capable to utilize their full power. Here, we introduce the convolutional transformer wave function (CTWF). We show that our CTWFs exhibit superior performance in ground-state search and non-equilibrium dynamics compared to previous results, demonstrating promising capacity in complex quantum problems.

Title: Siamese Foundation Models for Crystal Structure Prediction
Authors: Liming Wu, Wenbing Huang, Rui Jiao, Jianxing Huang, Liwei Liu, Yipeng Zhou, Hao Sun, Yang Liu, Fuchun Sun, Yuxiang Ren, Jirong Wen
Abstract: Crystal Structure Prediction (CSP), which aims to generate stable crystal structures from compositions, represents a critical pathway for discovering novel materials. While structure prediction tasks in other domains, such as proteins, have seen remarkable progress, CSP remains a relatively underexplored area due to the more complex geometries inherent in crystal structures. In this paper, we propose Siamese foundation models specifically designed to address CSP. Our pretrain-finetune framework, named DAO, comprises two complementary foundation models: DAO-G for structure generation and DAO-P for energy prediction. Experiments on CSP benchmarks (MP-20 and MPTS-52) demonstrate that our DAO-G significantly surpasses state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across all metrics. Extensive ablation studies further confirm that DAO-G excels in generating diverse polymorphic structures, and the dataset relaxation and energy guidance provided by DAO-P are essential for enhancing DAO-G's performance. When applied to three real-world superconductors ($\text{CsV}_3\text{Sb}_5$, $ \text{Zr}_{16}\text{Rh}_8\text{O}_4$ and $\text{Zr}_{16}\text{Pd}_8\text{O}_4$) that are known to be challenging to analyze, our foundation models achieve accurate critical temperature predictions and structure generations. For instance, on $\text{CsV}_3\text{Sb}_5$, DAO-G generates a structure close to the experimental one with an RMSE of 0.0085; DAO-P predicts the $T_c$ value with high accuracy (2.26 K vs. the ground-truth value of 2.30 K). In contrast, conventional DFT calculators like Quantum Espresso only successfully derive the structure of the first superconductor within an acceptable time, while the RMSE is nearly 8 times larger, and the computation speed is more than 1000 times slower. These compelling results collectively highlight the potential of our approach for advancing materials science research and development.

Title: Double-Crucible Vertical Bridgman Technique for Stoichiometry-Controlled Chalcogenide Crystal Growth
Authors: Yingdong Guan, Suguru Yoshida, Jairo Obando-Guevara, Seng Huat Lee, Heike Pfau, Zhiqiang Mao
Abstract: Precise stoichiometry control in single-crystal growth is essential for both technological applications and fundamental research. However, conventional growth methods often face challenges such as non-stoichiometry, compositional gradients, and phase impurities, particularly in non-congruent melting systems. Even in congruent melting systems like Bi2Se3, deviations from the ideal stoichiometric composition can lead to significant property degradation, such as excessive bulk conductivity, which limits its topological applications. In this study, we introduce the double-crucible vertical Bridgman (DCVB) method, a novel approach that enhances stoichiometry control through the combined use of continuous source material feeding, traveling-solvent growth, and liquid encapsulation, which suppresses volatile element loss under high pressure. Using Bi2Se3 as a model system, we demonstrate that crystals grown via DCVB exhibit enhanced stoichiometric control, significantly reducing defect density and achieving much lower carrier concentrations compared to those produced by conventional Bridgman techniques. Moreover, the continuous feeding of source material enables the growth of large crystals. This approach presents a promising strategy for synthesizing high-quality, large-scale crystals, particularly for metal chalcogenides and pnictides that exhibit challenging non-congruent melting behaviors.

Title: Observation of supersolid-like sound modes in a driven quantum gas
Authors: Nikolas Liebster, Marius Sparn, Elinor Kath, Jelte Duchene, Helmut Strobel, Markus K. Oberthaler
Abstract: Driven systems are of fundamental scientific interest, as they can exhibit properties that are radically different from the same system at equilibrium. In certain cases, long-lived states of driven matter can emerge, which exhibit new material properties. In this work, we probe the excitation spectrum of an emergent patterned state in a driven superfluid, finding that its response is identical to that of a one-dimensional supersolid. In order to extract physical quantities that parametrize the observed sound modes, we apply an effective hydrodynamic theory of superfluid smectics, which is agnostic to microscopic processes. We therefore use the conceptual framework of supersolids to characterize an otherwise dynamic and far-from-equilibrium state.

Title: On the Automation of High Throughput Modeling of Adsorption In Porous Zeolytic Imidazolate Frameworks
Authors: Michael O. Atambo, Korir Kiptiemoi
Abstract: The zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIF) have emerged as a promising candidate for catalysis, carbon-dioxide (CO$_{2}$) capture and storage as well as flue gas separation due to their tunable porosity and chemical stability. ZIFs consists of transition metals in a tetrahedral coordination with imidazolate linkers, allowing for structural modifications that can enhance CO$_{2}$ adsorption and storage. To systematically design and optimize ZIFs for superior CO$_{2}$ capture performance, theoretical modelling provides an effective approach, though hindered by the sheer size of the search space, with hundred to thousands of possible sites per ZIF, and thousands of possible ZIF that can be synthesized. In this work, we employ a high-throughput techniques underpinned by first-principle Density Functional Theory (DFT) to develop a systematic automated method for characterizing adsorption energetics in ZIFs, guiding the rational design and selection of desirable ZIF structures. Using high-throughput computing tools, we perform pore and pore size analysis, and implement automated CO$_{2}$ molecule placement algorithm, accounting for positional symmetry, crystallographic orientation, and collision detection. The results obtained are in good agreement with previous studies, demonstrating the reliability of the approach in accelerating the discovery of next-generation ZIFs for CO$_{2}$ capture and storage.

Title: Phase locking and fractional Shapiro steps in collective dynamics of microparticles
Authors: Seemant Mishra, Artem Ryabov, Philipp Maass
Abstract: In driven nonlinear systems, phase locking is an intriguing effect leading to robust stationary states that are stable over extended ranges of control parameters. Recent experiments allow for exploring microscopic mechanisms underlying such phenomena in collective dynamics of micro- and nanoparticles. Here we show that phase-locked dynamics of hardcore-interacting microparticles in a densely populated periodic potential under time-periodic driving arises from running solitary cluster waves. We explain how values of phase-locked currents are related to soliton velocities and why collective particle dynamics synchronize with the driving for certain particle diameters only. Our analysis is based on an effective potential for the solitary wave propagation and a unit displacement law, saying that the total average shift of all particle positions per soliton period equals one wavelength of the periodic potential.

Title: Magnetoelectricity of Topological Solitons in 2D Magnets
Authors: Alexander Edström, Paolo Barone, Silvia Picozzi, Massimiliano Stengel
Abstract: We develop a multiscale approach to magnetoelectric effects, bridging atomistic and continuum models, with all parameters determined from ab initio electronic structure calculations. We show that the parameters of the model are equivalent to the electric field-induced Dzyaloshinski-Moriya interactions. After careful validation, we apply the models to study electric polarization and dipole moments carried by spin spirals and topological solitons, in the form of magnetic domain walls and Skyrmions, in the prototypical 2D magnet CrI$_3$. We show that the reduced symmetry of the material leads to additional magnetoelectric coupling terms, dominating over those expected in high symmetry (cubic) materials. An interesting consequence is that Skyrmions carry an out-of-plane electric dipole moment, while that of anti-Skyrmions is an order of magnitude larger and in-plane. Finally, we discuss the possibility to stabilize non-collinear spin states using electric fields.

Title: Controlling the dynamical phase diagram of a spinor BEC using time-dependent potentials
Authors: Q. Guan, D. Blume, R. J. Lewis-Swan
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the spin-mixing dynamics of a spinor BEC subject to a time-dependent confining potential. Our study provides a theory framework for the experimental results reported in Phys. Rev. A 109, 043309 (2024). We exploit the disparity of energy scales associated with the spatial and internal (spin) degrees of freedom under typical experimental conditions to develop an effective few-mode description of the spin dynamics. Our model demonstrates how the details of the potential, such as driving frequency and amplitude, can be used to independently control spin-changing and spin-preserving collision processes as well as the effective Zeeman energy of the internal states. We obtain the dynamical phase diagram of the effective model and discuss how its structure is altered relative to a spinor BEC with frozen spatial degrees of freedom. The applicability of our effective model is verified through Gross-Pitaevskii simulations that capture the interplay of spin and spatial degrees of freedom, and we identify parameter regimes that can be feasibly explored by future experiments. Our findings highlight the utility of dynamical confining potentials for the control of non-equilibrium spin-mixing dynamics in spinor BECs.

Title: Velocity trapping in the lifted TASEP and the true self-avoiding random walk
Authors: Brune Massoulié, Clément Erignoux, Cristina Toninelli, Werner Krauth
Abstract: We discuss non-reversible Markov-chain Monte Carlo algorithms that, for particle systems, rigorously sample the positional Boltzmann distribution and that have faster than physical dynamics. These algorithms all feature a non-thermal velocity distribution. They are exemplified by the lifted TASEP (totally asymmetric simple exclusion process), a one-dimensional lattice reduction of event-chain Monte Carlo. We analyze its dynamics in terms of a velocity trapping that arises from correlations between the local density and the particle velocities. This allows us to formulate a conjecture for its out-of-equilibrium mixing time scale, and to rationalize its equilibrium superdiffusive time scale. Both scales are faster than for the (unlifted) TASEP. They are further justified by our analysis of the lifted TASEP in terms of many-particle realizations of true self-avoiding random walks. We discuss velocity trapping beyond the case of one-dimensional lattice models and in more than one physical dimensions. Possible applications beyond physics are pointed out.

Title: Benchmarking low-power flopping-mode spin qubit fidelities in Si/SiGe devices with alloy disorder
Authors: Steve M. Young, Mitchell Brickson, Jason R. Petta, N. Tobias Jacobson
Abstract: In the "flopping-mode" regime of electron spin resonance, a single electron confined in a double quantum dot is electrically driven in the presence of a magnetic field gradient. The increased dipole moment of the charge in the flopping mode significantly reduces the amount of power required to drive spin rotations. However, the susceptibility of flopping-mode spin qubits to charge noise, and consequently their overall performance, has not been examined in detail. In this work, we simulate single-qubit gate fidelities of electrically driven spin rotations in an ensemble of devices configured to operate in both the single-dot and flopping-mode regimes. Our model accounts for the valley physics of conduction band electrons in silicon and realistic alloy disorder in the SiGe barrier layers, allowing us to investigate device-to-device variability. We include charge and magnetic noise, as well as spin relaxation processes arising from charge noise and electron-phonon coupling. We find that the two operating modes exhibit significantly different susceptibilities to the various noise sources, with valley splitting and spin relaxation times also playing a role in their relative performance. For realistic noise strengths, we find that single-dot gate fidelities are limited by magnetic noise while flopping-mode fidelities are primarily limited by charge noise and spin relaxation. For sufficiently long spin relaxation times, flopping-mode spin operation is feasible with orders-of-magnitude lower drive power and gate fidelities that are on par with conventional single-dot electric dipole spin resonance.

Title: Simulating charging characteristics of lithium iron phosphate by electro-ionic optimization on a quantum annealer
Authors: Tobias Binninger, Yin-Ying Ting, Konstantin Köster, Nils Bruch, Payam Kaghazchi, Piotr M. Kowalski, Michael H. Eikerling
Abstract: The rapid evolution of quantum computing hardware opens up new avenues in the simulation of energy materials. Today's quantum annealers are able to tackle complex combinatorial optimization problems. A formidable challenge of this type is posed by materials with site-occupational disorder for which atomic arrangements with a low, or lowest, energy must be found. In this article, a method is presented for the identification of the correlated ground-state distribution of both lithium ions and redox electrons in lithium iron phosphate (LFP), a widely employed cathode material in lithium-ion batteries. The point-charge Coulomb energy model employed correctly reproduces the LFP charging characteristics. As is shown, grand-canonical transformation of the energy cost function makes the combinatorial distribution problem solvable on quantum annealing (QA) hardware. The QA output statistics follow a pseudo-thermal behavior characterized by a problem-dependent effective sampling temperature, which has bearings on the estimated scaling of the QA performance with system size. This work demonstrates the potential of quantum computation for the joint optimization of electronic and ionic degrees of freedom in energy materials.

Authors: Cai Dieball, Aljaž Godec
Abstract: Recently, a thermodynamic bound on correlation times was formulated in [A. Dechant, J. Garnier-Brun, S.-i. Sasa, Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 167101 (2023)], showing how the decay of correlations in Langevin dynamics is bounded by short-time fluctuations and dissipation. Whereas these original results only address very long observation times in steady-state dynamics, we here generalize the respective inequalities to finite observations and general initial conditions. We utilize the connection between correlations and the fluctuations of time-integrated density functionals and generalize the direct stochastic calculus approach from [C. Dieball and A. Godec, Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 087101 (2023)] which paves the way for further generalizations. We address the connection between short and long time scales, as well as the saturation of the bounds via complementary spectral-theoretic arguments. Motivated by the spectral insight, we formulate all results also for complex-valued observables.

Title: Current-linear emergent induction of pinned skyrmion textures in an oxide bilayer
Authors: Ludwig Scheuchenpflug, Sebastian Esser, Robert Gruhl, Max Hirschberger, Philipp Gegenwart
Abstract: Emergent electromagnetic induction (EEMI) induced through current-driven spin dynamics was recently predicted and subsequently observed in helical spin magnets, opening a new direction in spintronics and paving the way towards further miniaturization of electronic circuit elements. In contrast to conventional inductors consisting of coil-like structures whose inductance $L$ shows a linear dependence on the cross-section $A$, emergent inductors exhibit an inverse ($\propto {A}^{-1}$) proportionality, favorable for the miniaturization of electrical devices. However, the expected current-linear response of the EEMI voltage has not been demonstrated. Magnetic skyrmions hold promise as a simple platform to study the conceptual foundations of EEMI from current-driven spin dynamics. We fabricated devices of thin film bilayers of ferromagnetic SrRuO$_3$ and paramagnetic SrIrO$_3$, which are known to host interfacial Néel skyrmions detected by the appearance of a topological Hall-effect (THE). A large, positive and current-linear inductive response is found to accompany the THE. In our experiment, the current-induced dynamics of pinned magnetic skyrmions creates a voltage both parallel and perpendicular to the applied electric current flow, corresponding to longitudinal and transverse induction, respectively. This is the first report of transverse EEMI, indicating an angle of $80^{\circ}$ between skyrmion motion and the applied current. Our observation of current-linear longitudinal and transverse EEMI is a hallmark of pinned dynamics of magnetic skyrmion textures in oxide heterostructures.

Title: Hierarchical Bayesian inference for uncertainty quantification of thermal grease rheology
Authors: Pranay P. Nagrani, Akshay J. Thomas, Amy M. Marconnet, Ivan C. Christov
Abstract: Rheologically complex soft solids such as thermal greases consist of filler particles within a polymer matrix. These materials find applications in improving the conformity of solid-solid contacts and enhancing heat transfer. Complex soft solids exhibit a transient non-Newtonian rheological response, including thixotropy and viscoelasticity. Previously, stress relaxation and buildup in sheared commercial thermal greases were successfully captured using a nonlinear elasto-visco-plastic (NEVP) model and a thixo-elasto-visco-plastic (TEVP). However, the previous model calibration methods ignored parameter uncertainty, providing only single values of the rheological parameters, and did not quantitatively address the chosen model's identifiability from the data or credibility of the calibration. We address these limitations via hierarchical Bayesian inference, accounting for uncertainties arising from epistemic and aleatoric sources. Importantly, the hierarchical approach allows us to assimilate experiments measuring the stress responses at various startup shear rates by allowing the models' parameters to vary across different shear rates. Then, a global distribution and the associated uncertainty are obtained by pooling. We also propagate uncertainties to the transient shear stress response predicted by the models. Overall, we demonstrate that the chosen NEVP and NEVP models are identifiable from rheometric startup data. However, for the TEVP model, the uncertainty of the parameters is lower (narrower distributions) when higher shear rates are used for inference.

Title: Topological Quantum Dark Matter via Global Anomaly Cancellation
Authors: Juven Wang
Abstract: Standard Model (SM) with 15 Weyl fermions per family (lacking the 16th, the sterile right-handed neutrino $\nu_R$) suffers from mixed gauge-gravitational anomalies tied to baryon number plus or minus lepton number ${\bf B} \pm {\bf L}$ symmetry. Including $\nu_R$ per family can cancel these anomalies, but when ${\bf B} \pm {\bf L}$ symmetry is preserved as discrete finite subgroups rather than a continuous U(1), the perturbative local anomalies become nonperturbative global anomalies. In this work, we systematically enumerate these gauge-gravitational global anomalies involving discrete ${\bf B} \pm {\bf L}$ that are enhanced from the fermion parity $\mathbb{Z}_2^{\rm F}$ to $\mathbb{Z}_{2N}^{\rm F}$, with $N=2,3,4,6,9$, etc. The ${\bf B} \pm {\bf L}$ discreteness is constrained by multi-fermion deformations beyond-the-SM and the family number $N_f$. Unlike the free quadratic $\nu_R$ Majorana mass gap preserving the minimal $\mathbb{Z}_2^{\rm F}$, we explore novel scenarios canceling $({\bf B} \pm {\bf L})$-gravitational anomalies while preserving the $\mathbb{Z}_{2N}^{\rm F}$ discrete symmetries, featuring 4d interacting gapped topological orders (potentially with or without low-energy TQFT descriptions) or gapless sectors (e.g., conformal field theories). We propose anomalous sectors as quantum dark matter to cancel SM's global anomalies. We find the $N_f=3$ uniqueness, when the $\mathbb{Z}_{2N}^{\rm F}$ representation from the faithful ${\bf B} + {\bf L}$ for baryons at $N=N_c=3$ is extended to the faithful ${\bf Q} + N_c {\bf L}$ for quarks at $N=N_c N_f=9$, this symmetry extension matches with the topological order dark matter construction. Key implications include: (1) a 5th force mediating between SM and dark matter via discrete gauge fields. (2) dark matter as topological order quantum matter with gapped anyon excitations at ends of extended defects. (3) topological leptogenesis.

Title: A general formalism for machine-learning models based on multipolar-spherical harmonics
Authors: Michelangelo Domina, Stefano Sanvito
Abstract: The formulation of descriptors of the local chemical environment, enabling the construction of machine-learning models, is usually obtained by studying the properties of the expansion coefficients of a neighborhood density. In this work, we show that all the transformation properties of the descriptors and their behaviour under rotation, inversion and complex conjugation, are derived from the choice of the basis over which the density is expanded. Furthermore, crucially they are independent from the explicit mathematical form of the neighborhood density. In particular, we show that all the descriptors investigated, can be obtained by an expansion in multipolar spherical harmonics, which constitutes the core of this work, and which is introduced and analysed in great detail. By exploiting the orthogonality and the transformation rules of the multipolar spherical harmonics, we show that several formulations are simplified, such as the one needed to obtain the $\lambda-$SOAP kernel and its properties. We close this work by applying our framework to several multi-body descriptors available in literature, providing an in-depth analysis of their main properties, as made clear from the vantage viewpoint of a basis-centered approach.

Title: Non-equilibrium charge-vortex duality
Authors: Lazaros Tsaloukidis, Francisco Peña-Benítez, Piotr Surówka
Abstract: Traditionally applied within equilibrium states, the charge-vortex dualities are expanded to address the complex dynamics of superfluids and ideal fluids under non-static conditions. We have constructed explicit mappings of finite temperature fluid dynamics to gauge theories, enabling a dual description where vortices in both superfluids and ideal fluids are interpreted as charges within these theories. We found that vortices in the normal component naturally exhibit mobility restrictions, as manifested by the symmetries and conservation laws. Next, we formulated the Liénard-Wiechert problem for the ideal fluid at finite temperature and extracted the wave dynamics in the system along with the speed of sound corrections for both fluid components. Finally, we computed the correlation functions for the gauge potentials, particularly elucidating explicit cross-correlations between the normal and superfluid components.

Title: Light Drag in a Cavity Magnomechanics
Authors: Amjad Sohail, Hazrat Ali, Khalid Naseer, Rizwan Ahmed
Abstract: The term "light dragging" describes how the trajectory of light changes as it travels through a moving medium. This phenomenon facilitates the precise detection of incredibly slow speeds of light, which is widely used in quantum gate operations, state transfer, and quantum memory implementations, etc. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time we have proposed the existence of a light-dragging effect in a magnomechanical system (MMS). The origin of this crucial element stems from nonlinear dipole and magnetostrictive interactions in MMS. Magnomechanical characteristics such as magnon-photon and magnon-phonon couplings have a strong impact on both refractive and group index profile spectra. We also explore that lateral light drag shows a strong dependence on detuning by altering the amplitude and direction of the translational velocity. This enabled us to alter the light's propagation within the magnomechanical system from superluminal to subluminal and vice versa by adjusting the probe's detuning. The ability to control and manipulate the light drag through the MMS could be helpful in designing novel devices with improved functionality at the microscopic scale.

Title: Multi-Timescale Quantum Averaging Theory for Driven Quantum Systems
Authors: Kristian D. Barajas, Wesley C. Campbell
Abstract: We present a multi-timescale Quantum Averaging Theory (QAT), a generalized unitarity-preserving analytic framework for modeling periodically and almost-periodically driven quantum systems across multiple timescales. By integrating the Magnus expansion with the method of averaging on multiple scales, QAT captures the effects of both far-detuned and near-resonant interactions on system dynamics. The framework yields an effective Hamiltonian description while retaining fast oscillatory effects within a separate dynamical phase operator, ensuring accuracy across a wide range of driving regimes. We demonstrate the rapid convergence of QAT results toward exact numerical solutions in both detuning regimes for touchstone problems in quantum information science.

Title: Polarization-controlled strong light-matter interaction with templated molecular aggregates
Authors: Roland Schäfer, Philipp Weitkamp, Otgonbayar Erdene-Ochir, Klaus Meerholz, Klas Lindfors
Abstract: We demonstrate strong light-matter interaction for a layer of templated merocyanine molecules in a planar microcavity. Using a single layer of graphene nanoribbons as a templating layer, we obtain an aligned layer of aggregated molecules. The molecular layer displays anisotropic optical properties resembling those of a biaxial crystal. The anisotropic excitonic component in the cavity results in strongly polarization-dependent light-matter interaction and in increased Rabi-energies. The increased light-matter interaction is possibly due to reduced molecular disorder in the templated molecular layer. This conclusion is supported by an analysis based on a multi-oscillator model. We further use photoluminescence microspectroscopy to demonstrate that the light-matter coupling is spatially homogeneous. Our study introduces molecular templating to strong light-matter studies. The reduced disorder of the system as a consequence of templating is highly beneficial for engineering light-matter interaction.

Title: Two-by-two ordinal patterns in art paintings
Authors: Mateus M. Tarozo, Arthur A. B. Pessa, Luciano Zunino, Osvaldo A. Rosso, Matjaz Perc, Haroldo V. Ribeiro
Abstract: Quantitative analysis of visual arts has recently expanded to encompass a more extensive array of artworks due to the availability of large-scale digitized art collections. Consistent with formal analyses by art historians, many of these studies highlight the significance of encoding spatial structures within artworks to enhance our understanding of visual arts. However, defining universally applicable, interpretable, and sufficiently simple units that capture the essence of paintings and their artistic styles remains challenging. Here we examine ordering patterns in pixel intensities within two-by-two partitions of images from nearly 140,000 paintings created over the past thousand years. These patterns, categorized into eleven types based on arguments of continuity and symmetry, are both universally applicable and detailed enough to correlate with low-level visual features of paintings. We uncover a universal distribution of these patterns, with consistent prevalence within groups, yet modulated across groups by a nontrivial interplay between pattern smoothness and the likelihood of identical pixel intensities. This finding provides a standardized metric for comparing paintings and styles, further establishing a scale to measure deviations from the average prevalence. Our research also shows that these simple patterns carry valuable information for identifying painting styles, though styles generally exhibit considerable variability in the prevalence of ordinal patterns. Moreover, shifts in the prevalence of these patterns reveal a trend in which artworks increasingly diverge from the average incidence over time; however, this evolution is neither smooth nor uniform, with substantial variability in pattern prevalence, particularly after the 1930s.

Title: Stabilizing steady-state properties of open quantum systems with parameter engineering
Authors: Koray Aydoğan, Anthony W. Schlimgen, Kade Head-Marsden
Abstract: Realistic quantum systems are affected by environmental loss, which is often seen as detrimental for applications in quantum technologies. Alternatively, weak coupling to an environment can aid in stabilizing highly entangled and mixed states, but determining optimal system-environment parameters can be challenging. Here, we describe a technique to optimize parameters for generating desired non-equilibrium steady states (NESSs) in driven-dissipative quantum systems governed by the Lindblad equation. We apply this approach to predict highly-entangled and mixed NESSs in Ising, Kitaev, and Dicke models in several quantum phases.

Title: Scalable solution chemical synthesis and comprehensive analysis of Bi2Te3 and Sb2Te3
Authors: Bejan Hamawandi, Parva Parsa, Inga Pudza, Kaspars Pudzs, Alexei Kuzmin, Sedat Ballikaya, Edmund Welter, Rafal Szukiewicz, Maciej Kuchowicz, Muhammet S. Toprak
Abstract: Thermoelectric (TE) materials can directly convert heat into electrical energy. However, they sustain costly production procedures and batch-to-batch performance variations. Therefore, developing scalable synthetic techniques for large-scale and reproducible quality TE materials is critical for advancing TE technology. This study developed a facile, high throughput, solution-chemical synthetic technique. Microwave-assisted thermolysis process, providing energy-efficient volumetric heating, was used for the synthesis of bismuth and antimony telluride (Bi2Te3, Sb2Te3). As-made materials were characterized using various techniques, including XRPD, SEM, TEM, XAS, and XPS. Detailed investigation of the local atomic structure of the synthesized Bi2Te3 and Sb2Te3 powder samples was conducted through synchrotron radiation XAS experiments. The sintered TE materials exhibited low thermal conductivity, achieving the highest TE figure-of-merit values of 0.7 (573 K) and 0.9 (523 K) for n-type Bi2Te3 and p-type Sb2Te3, respectively, shifted significantly to the high-temperature region when compared to earlier reports, highlighting their potential for power generation applications. The scalable, energyand time-efficient synthetic method developed, along with the demonstration of its potential for TE materials, opens the door for a wider application of these materials with minimal environmental impact.

Title: Nonlinear Dynamics of a Dicke Model for V-Type Atoms
Authors: Ofri Adiv, Bernd Krauskopf, Scott Parkins
Abstract: We study the nonlinear, semiclassical dynamics of an open spin-1 (three-level) variant of the traditional Dicke model. In particular, we focus on V-type energy-level configurations with varying degrees of energy-level asymmetry. We also allow for unbalanced coupling -- where co-rotating and counter-rotating Hamiltonian terms are independently tunable. We characterise the system with a dynamical systems approach, where different behaviors map to definite dynamical objects, and phase transitions to bifurcations. We find the emergence of both periodic and two-frequency oscillations, as well as multistability and chaotic dynamics.

Title: Beyond the Boltzmann equation for weakly coupled quantum fields
Authors: Xu-Yao Hu, Vladimir Rosenhaus
Abstract: We study the kinetic theory of a weakly interacting quantum field. Assuming a state that is close to homogeneous and stationary, we derive a closed kinetic equation for the rate of change of the occupation numbers, perturbatively in the coupling. For a dilute gas, this reproduces the quantum Boltzmann equation, which only accounts for two-to-two scattering processes. Our expression goes beyond this, with terms accounting for multi-particle scattering processes, which are higher order in the density.

Title: Capturing an Electron in the Virtual State
Authors: Alok Nath Singh, Bibek Bhandari, Rafael Sánchez, Andrew N. Jordan
Abstract: We address a foundational question in quantum mechanics: can a particle be directly found in a classically forbidden virtual state? We instantiate this conceptual question by investigating the traversal of electrons through a tunnel barrier, which we define in a triple quantum dot (TQD) system where the occupation of the central dot is energetically avoided. The motivation behind this setup is to answer whether the central dot is occupied or not during a virtual transition when it is being explicitly monitored. We investigate this problem in two different limits of continuous measurements: the stochastic quantum diffusion and the quantum jump. We find that, even though individual trajectories differ considerably across these limits, measuring leads to a higher occupation in the central dot on average. Our results demonstrate that the act of observation fundamentally reshapes tunneling dynamics, resolving the seeming paradox of detecting a particle in a classically forbidden region: weak measurements partially localize the particle, while strong measurements enforce a discontinuous either/or detection or no detection outcome.

Title: Flow birefringence of shear-thinning fluid in a Hele-Shaw cell
Authors: Misa Kawaguchi, William Kai Alexander Worby, Yuto Yokoyama, Ryuta X. Suzuki, Yuichiro Nagatsu, Yoshiyuki Tagawa
Abstract: Flow birefringence measurement is an emerging technique for visualizing stress fields in fluid flows. This study investigates flow birefringence in the steady radial Hele-Shaw flow of a shear-thinning fluid. In this flow configuration, stress is dominant along the optical axis, challenging the applicability of the conventional stress-optic law (SOL). We conduct flow birefringence measurements at various flow rates and compare the results with theoretical predictions. The observed phase retardation cannot be quantitatively explained using the conventional SOL, but is successfully described using the second-order SOL, which accounts for stress along the optical direction, using the results of rheo-optical measurements. Furthermore, we investigate the shear-thinning effects on phase retardation from two perspectives: (i) stress changes resulting from viscosity variations and (ii) the variation of the shear-dependent stress-optic coefficient in the second-order SOL. Our findings indicate that the latter is more significant and shear-thinning behavior suppresses radial variations in phase retardation. This study demonstrates that the combination of the second-order SOL and rheo-optical measurements is essential for an accurate interpretation of flow birefringence in Hele-Shaw flow, providing a noninvasive approach for stress field analysis in high-aspect-ratio geometries.

Title: A novel metric for species vulnerability and coexistence in spatially-extended ecosystems
Authors: Davide Bernardi, Giorgio Nicoletti, Prajwal Padmanabha, Samir Suweis, Sandro Azaele, Andrea Rinaldo, Amos Maritan
Abstract: We develop a theoretical framework to understand the persistence and coexistence of competitive species in a spatially explicit metacommunity model with a heterogeneous dispersal kernel. Our analysis, based on methods from the physics of disordered systems and non-Gaussian dynamical mean field theory, reveals that species coexistence is governed by a single key parameter, which we term competitive balance. From competitive balance, we derive a novel metric to quantitatively assess the vulnerability of a species, showing that abundance alone is not sufficient to determine it. Rather, a species' vulnerability crucially depends on the state of the metacommunity as a whole. We test our theory by analyzing two distinct tropical forest datasets, finding excellent agreement with our theoretical predictions. A key step in our analysis is the introduction of a new quantity - the competitive score - which disentangles the abundance distribution and enables us to circumvent the challenge of estimating both the colonization kernel and the joint abundance distribution. Our findings provide novel and fundamental insights into the ecosystem-level trade-offs underlying macroecological patterns and introduce a robust approach for estimating extinction risks.

Title: The Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes Framework for Multiphase Fluid Flows: Laminar, Turbulent, and Active
Authors: Nadia Bihari Padhan, Rahul Pandit
Abstract: The Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes (CHNS) partial differential equations (PDEs) provide a powerful framework for the study of the statistical mechanics and fluid dynamics of multiphase fluids. We provide an introduction to the equilibrium and nonequilibrium statistical mechanics of systems in which coexisting phases, distinguished from each other by scalar order parameters, are separated by an interface. We then introduce the coupled Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes (CHNS) PDEs for two immiscible fluids and generalisations for (a) coexisting phases with different viscosities, (b) CHNS with gravity, (c) the three-component fluids (CHNS3), and (d) the CHNS for active fluids. We discuss mathematical issues of the regularity of solutions of the CHNS PDEs. Finally we provide a survey of the rich variety of results that have been obtained by numerical studies of CHNS-type PDEs for diverse systems, including bubbles in turbulent flows, antibubbles, droplet and liquid-lens mergers, turbulence in the active-CHNS model, and its generalisation that can lead to a self-propelled droplet.

Title: Pushing the Boundary of Quantum Advantage in Hard Combinatorial Optimization with Probabilistic Computers

Abstract: Recent demonstrations on specialized benchmarks have reignited excitement for quantum computers, yet whether they can deliver an advantage for practical real-world problems remains an open question. Here, we show that probabilistic computers (p-computers) when co-designed with hardware to implement powerful Monte Carlo algorithms surpass state-of-the-art quantum annealers [\href{this https URL}{King et al., Nature (2023)}] in solving hard optimization problems. We focus on two key algorithms: discrete-time simulated quantum annealing (DT-SQA) and adaptive parallel tempering (APT), both applied to 3D spin glasses. For DT-SQA, we find that increasing the number of replicas improves residual energy scaling, while parallelizing fewer replicas across independent runs also achieves comparable scaling. Both strategies align with the theoretical expectations from extreme value theory. In addition, APT outperforms DT-SQA when supported by non-local isoenergetic cluster moves. Finite-size scaling analysis suggests a universal behavior that explains the superior performance of APT over both DT-SQA and quantum annealing. We show that these algorithms are readily implementable in modern hardware thanks to the mature semiconductor technology. Unlike software simulations, replicas can be monolithically housed on a single chip and a large number of spins can be updated in parallel and asynchronously, similar to a quantum annealer. We project that custom Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) or specialized chips leveraging massive parallelism can further accelerate these algorithms by orders of magnitude, while drastically improving energy efficiency. Our results challenge the notion of a practical quantum advantage in optimization and present p-computers as scalable, energy-efficient hardware for real-world optimization problems.

Title: Mixed-state learnability transitions in monitored noisy quantum dynamics
Authors: Hansveer Singh, Romain Vasseur, Andrew C. Potter, Sarang Gopalakrishnan
Abstract: We consider learnability transitions in monitored quantum systems that undergo noisy evolution, subject to a global strong symmetry -- i.e., in addition to the measuring apparatus, the system can interact with an unobserved environment, but does not exchange charge with it. As in the pure-state setting, we find two information-theoretic phases -- a sharp (fuzzy) phase in which an eavesdropper can rapidly (slowly) learn the symmetry charge. However, because the dynamics is noisy, both phases can be simulated efficiently using tensor networks. Indeed, even when the true dynamics is unitary, introducing noise by hand allows an eavesdropper to efficiently learn the symmetry charge from local measurements, as we demonstrate. We identify the fuzzy phase in this setting as a mixed-state phase that exhibits spontaneous strong-to-weak symmetry breaking.

Title: Strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking and average symmetry protected topological order in the doubled Hilbert space
Authors: Yoshihito Kuno, Takahiro Orito, Ikuo Ichinose
Abstract: Discovering and categorizing quantum orders in mixed many-body systems are currently one of the most important problems. Target model in this study is an extended version of the cluster model in one dimension with $Z_2\otimes Z_2$ symmetry, and we investigate effects of decoherence applied to the ground state of the model, focusing on the symmetry aspect. By using a scheme that we propose, a strong symmetry protected topological (SPT) mixed state and double average SPT (ASPT) state are constructed through the pure gapless SPT order and the domain-wall duality. Among them, the double ASPT is categorized by coexisting orders, i.e., a strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking and ASPT defined by the remaining weak and strong symmetries. We make use of the doubled Hilbert space formalism for the construction scheme. We numerically demonstrate the emergence of the two mixed SPT states and find that a phase transition takes place between them tuned by the strength of decoherence. Suitable multiple-decoherence channel applied to SPT states gives a broad possibility to induce rich ASPTs, possessing non-trivial internal entanglement properties from the view of doubled Hilbert space formalism.

Title: No-go theorem for environment-assisted invariance in non-unitary dynamics
Authors: Akira Sone, Akram Touil, Kenji Maeda, Paola Cappellaro, Sebastian Deffner
Abstract: We elucidate the requirements for quantum operations that achieve environment-assisted invariance (envariance), a symmetry of entanglement. While envariance has traditionally been studied within the framework of local unitary operations, we extend the analysis to consider non-unitary local operations. First, we investigate the conditions imposed on operators acting on pure bipartite entanglement to attain envariance. We show that the local operations must take a direct-sum form in their Kraus operator representations, establishing decoherence-free subspaces. Furthermore, we prove that the unitary operation on the system's subspace uniquely determines the corresponding unitary operator on the environment's subspace. As an immediate consequence, we demonstrate that environment-assisted shortcuts to adiabaticity cannot be achieved through non-unitary operations. In addition, we identify the requirements that local operations must satisfy to ensure that the eternal black hole states remain static in AdS/CFT.

Title: Architecture-Aware Minimization (A$^2$M): How to Find Flat Minima in Neural Architecture Search
Authors: Matteo Gambella, Fabrizio Pittorino, Manuel Roveri
Abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has become an essential tool for designing effective and efficient neural networks. In this paper, we investigate the geometric properties of neural architecture spaces commonly used in differentiable NAS methods, specifically NAS-Bench-201 and DARTS. By defining flatness metrics such as neighborhoods and loss barriers along paths in architecture space, we reveal locality and flatness characteristics analogous to the well-known properties of neural network loss landscapes in weight space. In particular, we find that highly accurate architectures cluster together in flat regions, while suboptimal architectures remain isolated, unveiling the detailed geometrical structure of the architecture search landscape. Building on these insights, we propose Architecture-Aware Minimization (A$^2$M), a novel analytically derived algorithmic framework that explicitly biases, for the first time, the gradient of differentiable NAS methods towards flat minima in architecture space. A$^2$M consistently improves generalization over state-of-the-art DARTS-based algorithms on benchmark datasets including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet16-120, across both NAS-Bench-201 and DARTS search spaces. Notably, A$^2$M is able to increase the test accuracy, on average across different differentiable NAS methods, by +3.60\% on CIFAR-10, +4.60\% on CIFAR-100, and +3.64\% on ImageNet16-120, demonstrating its superior effectiveness in practice. A$^2$M can be easily integrated into existing differentiable NAS frameworks, offering a versatile tool for future research and applications in automated machine learning. We open-source our code at this https URL.

Title: Meta-learning characteristics and dynamics of quantum systems
Authors: Lucas Schorling, Pranav Vaidhyanathan, Jonas Schuff, Miguel J. Carballido, Dominik Zumbühl, Gerard Milburn, Florian Marquardt, Jakob Foerster, Michael A. Osborne, Natalia Ares
Abstract: While machine learning holds great promise for quantum technologies, most current methods focus on predicting or controlling a specific quantum system. Meta-learning approaches, however, can adapt to new systems for which little data is available, by leveraging knowledge obtained from previous data associated with similar systems. In this paper, we meta-learn dynamics and characteristics of closed and open two-level systems, as well as the Heisenberg model. Based on experimental data of a Loss-DiVincenzo spin-qubit hosted in a Ge/Si core/shell nanowire for different gate voltage configurations, we predict qubit characteristics i.e. $g$-factor and Rabi frequency using meta-learning. The algorithm we introduce improves upon previous state-of-the-art meta-learning methods for physics-based systems by introducing novel techniques such as adaptive learning rates and a global optimizer for improved robustness and increased computational efficiency. We benchmark our method against other meta-learning methods, a vanilla transformer, and a multilayer perceptron, and demonstrate improved performance.

Title: Characterization of porous nanoparticles using the lattice Boltzmann method for fluid flow
Authors: Wagner Gomes Rodrigues Junior, Vera Bohomoletz Henriques
Abstract: Nanoporous capsules have been the subject of intense investigation in the field of drug delivery. One of the essential properties of such particles, which requires characterization, is their structure. Many experimental techniques have been used for this purpose, such as wide-angle neutron or X-ray scattering, or light scattering. Herein, we report theoretical data on the relationship between the size, porosity and drag force of porous particles. Data were obtained from a numerical procedure based on the lattice Boltzmann method for the calculation of the creeping flow over porous spherical objects. Previous analytical solutions to the hydrodynamic equations yielded different predictions for the drag force under conditions of high permeability. In the light of our findings, we compared our data to previous divergent analytical solutions and analyzed experimental results for dynamic and static light scattering of porous membrane vesicles Our findings strongly indicate a potential source of error that has led to inconsistencies in DLS measurements when compared to other techniques.

Title: Holographic study of shear viscosity and butterfly velocity for magnetic field-driven quantum criticality
Authors: Jun-Kun Zhao, Li Li
Abstract: We investigate the shear viscosity and butterfly velocity of a magnetic field-induced quantum phase transition in five dimensional Einstein-Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory, which is holographically dual to a class of strongly coupled quantum field theories with chiral anomalies. Our analysis reveals that the ratio of longitudinal shear viscosity to entropy density $\eta_\parallel/s$ exhibits a pronounced non-monotonic dependence on temperature $T$ when the magnetic field $B$ is slightly below the critical value $B_c$ of the quantum phase transition. In particular, it can develop a distinct minimum at an intermediate temperature. This contrasts sharply with the monotonic temperature scaling observed at and above $B_c$, where $\eta_\parallel/s$ follows the scaling $T^{2/3}$ at $B=B_c$ and transitions to $T^2$ for $B>B_c$ as $T\to0$. The non-vanishing of $\eta_\parallel/s$ for $B<B_c$ in the zero temperature limit suggests that it could serve as a good order parameter of the quantum phase transition. We also find that all butterfly velocities change dramatically near the quantum phase transition, and thus their derivatives with respect to $B$ can be independently used to detect the quantum critical point.

Title: Magneto-transport signatures in periodically-driven Weyl and multi-Weyl semimetals
Authors: Shivam Yadav, Serena Fazzini, Ipsita Mandal
Abstract: We investigate the influence of a time-periodic driving (for example, by shining circularly polarized light) on three-dimensional Weyl and multi-Weyl semimetals, in the planar Hall and planar thermal Hall set-ups. We incorporate the effects of the drive by using the Floquet formalism in the large frequency limit. We evaluate the longitudinal magneto conductivity, planar Hall conductivity, longitudinal thermo-electric coefficient, and transverse thermo-electric coefficient, using the semi-classical Boltzmann transport equations. We demonstrate the explicit expressions of these transport coefficients in certain limits of the parameters, where it is possible to perform the integrals analytically. We cross-check our analytical approximations by comparing the physical values with the numerical results, obtained directly from the numerical integration of the integrals. The answers obtained show that the topological charges of the corresponding semimetals have profound signatures in these transport properties, which can be observed in experiments.

Title: Flexoelectricity and surface ferroelectricity of water ice
Authors: Xin Wen, Qianqian Ma, Anthony Mannino, Marivi Fernandez-serra, Shengping Shen, Gustau Catalan
Abstract: The phase diagram of ice is complex and contains many phases, but the most common (frozen water at ambient pressure, also known as Ih ice) is a non-polar material despite individual water molecules being polar1,2. Consequently, ice is not piezoelectric and cannot generate electricity under pressure3. On the other hand, the coupling between polarization and strain gradient (flexoelectricity) is universal4, so ice may in theory generate electricity under bending. Here we report the experimental demonstration that ice is flexoelectric, finding a coefficient of 1.14+-0.13 nC/m, comparable to that of ceramics such as SrTiO3, TiO2, or PbZrO3. Additionally, and unexpectedly, the sensitivity of flexoelectric measurements to surface boundary conditions has also revealed a ferroelectric phase transition around ~160K confined in the near-surface region of the ice slabs. The electromechanical properties of ice may find applications for low-cost transducers made in-situ in cold and remote locations. Importantly, there are also consequences for natural phenomena. In particular, we have calculated the flexoelectric charge density generated in ice-graupel collisions, and found it to be comparable to the experimental charge transferred in such events, suggesting a possible participation of ice flexoelectricity in the charging up of thunderstorms.

Title: Large circular photogalvanic effect in non-centrosymmetric magnetic Weyl semimetal CeAlSi
Authors: Abhirup Roy Karmakar, A. Taraphder, G. P. Das
Abstract: The recent discovery of the Weyl semimetal CeAlSi with simultaneous breaking of inversion and time-reversal symmetries has opened up new avenues for research into the interaction between light and topologically protected bands. In this work, we present a comprehensive examination of shift current and injection current responsible for the circular photogalvanic effect in CeAlSi using first-principles calculations. Our investigation identifies a significant injection current of 4 mA/V$^2$ over a broad range in the near-infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum, exceeding previously reported findings. In addition, we explored several externally controllable parameters to further enhance the photocurrent. A substantial boost in the injection current is observed when applying uniaxial strain along the $c$-axis of the crystal - a 5% strain results in a remarkable 64% increment. The exceptional photocurrent response in CeAlSi suggests that magnetic non-centrosymmetric Weyl semimetals may provide promising opportunities for novel photogalvanic applications.

Title: Disorder-Induced Delocalization in Magic-Angle Twisted Bilayer Graphene
Authors: Pedro Alcázar Guerrero, Viet-Hung Nguyen, Jorge Martínez Romeral, Aron W. Cummings, José-Hugo Garcia, Jean-Christophe Charlier, Stephan Roche
Abstract: Flat bands in moiré systems are exciting new playgrounds for the generation and study of exotic many-body physics phenomena in low-dimensional materials. Such physics is attributed to the vanishing kinetic energy and strong spatial localization of the flat-band states. Here we use numerical simulations to examine the electronic transport properties of such flat bands in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene in the presence of disorder. We find that while a conventional downscaling of the mean free path with increasing disorder strength occurs at higher energies, in the flat bands the mean free path can actually increase with increasing disorder this http URL phenomenon is also captured by the disorder-dependent quantum metric, which is directly linked to the ground state this http URL disorder-induced delocalization suggests that weak disorder may have a strong impact on the exotic physics of magic-angle bilayer graphene and other related moiré systems.

Title: Picosecond transfer from short-term to long-term memory in analog antiferromagnetic memory device
Authors: M. Surynek, J. Zubac, K. Olejnik, A. Farkas, F. Krizek, L. Nadvornik, P. Kubascik, F. Trojanek, R.P. Campion, V. Novak, T. Jungwirth, P. Nemec
Abstract: Previous experiments in compensated magnets have demonstrated a potential for approaching the limit of fastest and least-dissipative operation of digital memory bits. However, the analog route has been virtually unexplored at (sub)ps time scales. In this paper, we report on experimental separation of heat-related and quench-switching-related resistance signal dynamics induced at room temperature by a single femtosecond-laser-pulse in memory devices made from a metallic antiferromagnetic CuMnAs. We show that the heat-related dynamics, on picosecond to hundreds of nanoseconds time scales, can be used as a short-term memory where information about input stimuli, represented by laser-pulses, is stored temporarily. When the quench-switching threshold is reached, information is transferred to the device's variable resistance, serving as a long-term memory, with time components of 10 ms and 10 s. The potentially appealing features of the heat-based memory for several distinct research fields, including bio-inspired analogue devices and heat-based logic, are also discussed.

Title: Similarity Equivariant Graph Neural Networks for Homogenization of Metamaterials
Authors: Fleur Hendriks (1), Vlado Menkovski (1), Martin Doškář (2), Marc G. D. Geers (1), Ondřej Rokoš (1) ((1) Eindhoven University of Technology, (2) Czech Technical University in Prague)
Abstract: Soft, porous mechanical metamaterials exhibit pattern transformations that may have important applications in soft robotics, sound reduction and biomedicine. To design these innovative materials, it is important to be able to simulate them accurately and quickly, in order to tune their mechanical properties. Since conventional simulations using the finite element method entail a high computational cost, in this article we aim to develop a machine learning-based approach that scales favorably to serve as a surrogate model. To ensure that the model is also able to handle various microstructures, including those not encountered during training, we include the microstructure as part of the network input. Therefore, we introduce a graph neural network that predicts global quantities (energy, stress stiffness) as well as the pattern transformations that occur (the kinematics). To make our model as accurate and data-efficient as possible, various symmetries are incorporated into the model. The starting point is an E(n)-equivariant graph neural network (which respects translation, rotation and reflection) that has periodic boundary conditions (i.e., it is in-/equivariant with respect to the choice of RVE), is scale in-/equivariant, can simulate large deformations, and can predict scalars, vectors as well as second and fourth order tensors (specifically energy, stress and stiffness). The incorporation of scale equivariance makes the model equivariant with respect to the similarities group, of which the Euclidean group E(n) is a subgroup. We show that this network is more accurate and data-efficient than graph neural networks with fewer symmetries. To create an efficient graph representation of the finite element discretization, we use only the internal geometrical hole boundaries from the finite element mesh to achieve a better speed-up and scaling with the mesh size.

Title: Emergent quantum Majorana metal from a chiral spin liquid
Authors: Penghao Zhu, Shi Feng, Kang Wang, Tao Xiang, Nandini Trivedi
Abstract: We propose a mechanism to explain the emergence of an intermediate gapless spin liquid phase in the antiferromagnetic Kitaev model in an externally applied magnetic field, sandwiched between the well-known gapped chiral spin liquid and the gapped partially polarized phase. We propose that, in moderate fields, $\pi$-fluxes nucleate in the ground state and trap Majorana zero modes. As these fluxes proliferate with increasing field, the Majorana zero modes overlap creating an emergent $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum Majorana metallic state with a `Fermi surface' at zero energy. We further show that the Majorana spectral function captures the dynamical spin and dimer correlations obtained by the infinite Projected Entangled Pair States method, thereby validating our variational approach.

Abstract: Recently, light-matter interaction has been vastly expanded as a control tool for inducing and enhancing many emergent non-equilibrium phenomena. However, conventional schemes for exploring such light-induced phenomena rely on uniform and diffraction-limited free-space optics, which limits the spatial resolution and the efficiency of light-matter interaction. Here, we overcome these challenges using metasurface plasmon polaritons (MPPs) to form a sub-wavelength optical lattice. Specifically, we report a ``non-local" pump-probe scheme where MPPs are excited to induce a spatially modulated AC Stark shift for excitons in a monolayer of MoSe$_2$, several microns away from the illumination spot. Remarkably, we identify nearly two orders of magnitude reduction for the required modulation power compared to the free-space optical illumination counterpart. Moreover, we demonstrate a broadening of the excitons' linewidth as a robust signature of MPP-induced periodic sub-diffraction modulation. Our results will allow exploring power-efficient light-induced lattice phenomena below the diffraction limit in active chip-compatible MPP architectures.

Title: Phase behaviors and dynamics of active particle systems in double-well potential
Authors: Lu Chen, Baopi Liu, Ning Liu
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the behaviors and dynamics of self-propelled particles with active reorientation (AR) in a double-well potential. We explore the competition between AR and external potentials, revealing that self-propelled particles exhibit flocking and clustering behaviors in an asymmetric potential trap. Through molecular dynamics simulations, we obtain a phase diagram that illustrates flocking behavior as a function of active reorientation and potential asymmetry. We compare the responses of inactive and active particles to the potential, finding that active reorientation significantly increases aggregation on one side of the asymmetric potential well. Additionally, by calculating the mean squared displacement and scaling exponent, we identify distinct diffusion regimes. Our findings demonstrate that active particles with active reorientation are more sensitive to variations in double-well potentials.

Title: Cascade of pressure induced competing CDWs in the kagome metal FeGe

Abstract: Electronic ordering is prevalent in correlated systems, which commonly exhibit competing interactions. Here, we use x-ray diffraction to demonstrate a cascade of pressure induced order-disorder transformations, with propagation vectors $\mathbf{q}_\mathrm{CDW}$= $\left(\frac{1}{2}\ 0\ \frac{1}{2}\right)$, $\mathbf{q}^*$=$\left(\frac{1}{3}\ \frac{1}{3}\ \frac{1}{2}\right)$ and $\mathbf{q}^\dagger$=$\left(\frac{1}{3}\ \frac{1}{3}\ \frac{1}{3}\right)$, in the kagome metal FeGe. In the pressure interval between 4$<p<$10 GPa, $\mathbf{q}_\mathrm{CDW}$ and $\mathbf{q}^*$ coexist and the spatial extent of the $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ order is nearly long-range at $\sim$15 GPa, $\sim$30 unit cells. Above $\sim$25 GPa, the periodic lattice distortion has a propagation wavevector of $\mathbf{q}^\dagger$=$\left(\frac{1}{3}\ \frac{1}{3}\ \frac{1}{3}\right)$ at room temperature. The cascade of phase transitions are captured by the Ising model of frustrated triangular lattices and modeled by Monte Carlo simulations based on the dimerization of trigonal Ge$_1$. The pressure dependence of the integrated intensities and correlation lengths of $\mathbf{q}_\mathrm{CDW}$, $\mathbf{q}^*$ and $\mathbf{q}^\dagger$ demonstrate a competition between the 2$\times$2 and $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ phases prove the tunability of order-disorder phase transitions under pressure and the rich landscape of metastable/fragile phases of FeGe.

Title: Electronic structure, spin-orbit interaction and electron-phonon coupling of triangular adatom lattices on semiconductor substrates
Authors: Lucca Marchetti, Matthew Bunney, Domenico Di Sante, Stephan Rachel
Abstract: A one-third monolayer of the heavy metals Sn and Pb deposited on semiconductor substrates can lead to a $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ surface reconstruction, constituting an exciting triangular lattice material platform. A long history of experiments identified charge-ordered and magnetic ground states. These discoveries were accompanied by a decades-long debate of whether electron correlations or other effects involving phonons are the driving force of the symmetry-broken states. The most recent discovery of superconductivity in boron-doped Sn/Si(111) with a $T_c$ between 5K and 9K led to a renewed excitement. Here we revisit the electronic and phononic properties of Sn and Pb adatom triangular lattices on Si(111) and SiC(0001). For all materials we compute relativistic bandstructures using DFT+$U$ where $U$ is only applied to the substrate atoms in order to adjust the band gap to match the experimental value; as a consequence, some of the resulting tight-binding parameters of the metallic surface band differ substantially compared to previous studies. Remarkably, for Pb/SiC(0001) we predict Rashba spin-orbit coupling as large as 45% of the nearest-neighbor hopping energy. In addition, we compute the phonon spectra and electron-phonon coupling constants for all materials, and for Pb/Si(111) even relativistically although the inclusion of spin-orbit coupling has surprisingly little effect on the electron-phonon coupling constant. We conclude that the resulting couplings are too weak to account for electron-phonon mediated superconductivity in any of these materials.

Title: Universality in diffusion-controlled nucleation and growth
Authors: Alexei V. Tkachenko
Abstract: Nucleation and growth is studied in a system undergoing diffusion-controlled condensation under gradual changes in parameters, such as cooling. It is demonstrated that when Gibbs-Thompson effect becomes negligible, the system falls into a universal regime. i.e. the final droplet size distribution remains invariant under certain rescaling of system parameters. An approximate yet very accurate analytic form is obtained for the size distribution function in this regime.

Title: Static structure factor and the dispersion of the Girvin-MacDonald-Platzman density mode for fractional quantum Hall fluids on the Haldane sphere
Authors: Rakesh K. Dora, Ajit C. Balram
Abstract: We study the neutral excitations in the bulk of the fractional quantum Hall (FQH) fluids generated by acting with the Girvin-MacDonald-Platzman (GMP) density operator on the uniform ground state. Creating these density modulations atop the ground state costs energy, since any density fluctuation in the FQH system has a gap stemming from underlying interparticle interactions. We calculate the GMP density-mode dispersion for many bosonic and fermionic FQH states on the Haldane sphere using the ground state static structure factor computed on the same geometry. Previously, this computation was carried out on the plane. Analogous to the GMP algebra of the lowest Landau level (LLL) projected density operators in the plane, we derive the algebra for the LLL-projected density operators on the sphere, which facilitates the computation of the density-mode dispersion. Contrary to previous results on the plane, we find that, in the long-wavelength limit, the GMP mode accurately describes the dynamics of the primary Jain states.

Title: Observation of edge and bulk states in a three-site Kitaev chain

Abstract: A chain of quantum dots (QDs) in semiconductor-superconductor hybrid systems can form an artificial Kitaev chain hosting Majorana bound states (MBSs). These zero-energy states are expected to be localised on the edges of the chain, at the outermost QDs. The remaining QDs, comprising the bulk, are predicted to host an excitation gap that protects the MBSs at the edges from local on-site perturbations. Here we demonstrate this connection between the bulk and edges in a minimal system, by engineering a three-site Kitaev chain in a two-dimensional electron gas. Through direct tunneling spectroscopy on each site, we show that the appearance of stable zero-bias conductance peaks at the outer QDs is correlated with the presence of an excitation gap in the middle QD. Furthermore, we show that this gap can be controlled by applying a superconducting phase difference between the two hybrid segments and that the MBSs are robust only when the excitation gap is present. We find a close agreement between experiments and the original Kitaev model, thus confirming key predictions for MBSs in a three-site chain.

Title: Interband spectroscopy of Landau levels and magnetoexcitons in bulk black phosphorus
Authors: H. Okamura, S. Iguchi, T. Sasaki, Y. Ikemoto, T. Moriwaki, Y. Akahama
Abstract: Low-dimensional systems based on black phosphorus (BP) have recently attracted much interest. Since the crystal structure of BP consists of 2D layers with a strong in-plane anisotropy, its electronic properties at a high magnetic field ($B$) are quite interesting. Here, we report a magneto-optical study of bulk BP at high $B$ to 12 T perpendicular to the 2D layers. In the obtained optical conductivity spectra, periodic peaks are clearly observed corresponding to Landau levels of up to $n$=6 quantum number. They exhibit almost linear shifts with $B$, and from their analysis an electron-hole reduced mass of 0.13 $m_0$ is obtained, where $m_0$ is the electron mass. Many of the peaks appear in pairs, which is interpreted in terms of Zeeman splitting and an electron-hole combined $g$-factor of 6.6 is obtained. In addition, magnetoexciton peaks are observed to shift quadratically with $B$, and the exciton binding energy at $B$=0 is estimated to be 9.7 meV.

Title: Giant Dynamical Paramagnetism in the driven pseudogap phase of $ \rm YBa_2Cu_3O_{6+x}$
Authors: Marios H. Michael, Duilio De Santis, Eugene A. Demler, Patrick A. Lee
Abstract: In the past decade, photo-induced superconducting-like behaviors have been reported in a number of materials driven by intense pump fields. Of particular interest is the high-$T_c$ cuprate $\rm Y Ba_2 Cu_2 O_{6+x}$, where such effect has been reported up to the so-called pseudogap temperature $T^* \sim 300-400$ K. In a recent tour-de-force experiment, a transient magnetic field which is proportional to and in the same direction of an applied field has been observed outside the sample, suggestive of flux exclusion due to the Meissner effect. In this paper, we point out that the transient magnetic field could be explained by a model of bilayers of copper-oxygen planes with a local superconducting phase variable persisting up to the pseudo-gap temperature at equilibrium. Under pumping, the time evolution is described by a driven sine-Gordon equation. In the presence of an external magnetic field, this model exhibits a novel instability which amplifies the current at the edges of the bilayer formed by defects or grain boundaries, producing a giant paramagnetic magnetization in the same direction as the applied field. We present how this scenario can fit most of the available data and propose additional experimental tests which can distinguish our proposal from the Meissner flux exclusion scenario. To the extent that this model can account for the data, we conclude that the experiments have the important consequence of revealing the presence of local pairing in the pseudogap phase. More broadly, this work provides a new mechanism for amplifying external magnetic fields at ultra-fast time scales.

Title: Integrable fishnet circuits and Brownian solitons
Authors: Žiga Krajnik, Enej Ilievski, Tomaž Prosen, Benjamin J. A. Héry, Vincent Pasquier
Abstract: We introduce classical many-body dynamics on a one-dimensional lattice comprising local two-body maps arranged on discrete space-time mesh that serve as discretizations of Hamiltonian dynamics with arbitrarily time-varying coupling constants. Time evolution is generated by passing an auxiliary degree of freedom along the lattice, resulting in a `fishnet' circuit structure. We construct integrable circuits consisting of Yang-Baxter maps and demonstrate their general properties, using the Toda and anisotropic Landau-Lifschitz models as examples. Upon stochastically rescaling time, the dynamics is dominated by fluctuations and we observe solitons undergoing Brownian motion.

Title: Origin of $A$-type antiferromagnetism and chiral split magnons in altermagnetic $α$-MnTe
Authors: Mojtaba Alaei, Pawel Sobieszczyk, Andrzej Ptok, Nafise Rezaei, Artem R. Oganov, Alireza Qaiumzadeh
Abstract: The origin of the $A$-type antiferromagnetic ordering, characterized by ferromagnetic layers coupling antiferromagnetically, in the prototype semiconductor altermagnet $\alpha$-MnTe has been a topic of ongoing debate. Experimentally, $\alpha$-MnTe exhibits an in-plane ferromagnetic exchange interaction, whereas previous \emph{ab initio} calculations predicted an antiferromagnetic interaction. In this paper, we resolve this discrepancy by considering an expanded set of magnetic configurations, which reveals a ferromagnetic in-plane exchange interaction in agreement with experimental findings. Additionally, we demonstrate that the 10th nearest-neighbor exchange interaction is directionally dependent, inducing a nonrelativistic chiral splitting in the magnon bands, as recently observed experimentally. We further show that applying a compressive strain may significantly enhance both nonrelativistic spin and chiral magnon splittings. The strain can also change the sign of the in-plane exchange interaction. Computing magnetic susceptibility, we show that strain enhances the N{é}el temperature, significantly. Our results highlight the critical importance of convergence in the number of magnetic configurations for spin interactions in antiferromagnetic materials.

Title: Stacking-dependent electronic structure of ultrathin perovskite bilayers
Authors: Daniel T. Larson, Daniel Bennett, Abduhla Ali, Anderson S. Chaves, Raagya Arora, Karin M. Rabe, Efthimios Kaxiras
Abstract: Twistronics has received much attention as a new method to manipulate the properties of 2D van der Waals structures by introducing moiré patterns through a relative rotation between two layers. Here we begin a theoretical exploration of twistronics beyond the realm of van der Waals materials by developing a first-principles description of the electronic structure and interlayer interactions of ultrathin perovskite bilayers. We construct both an ab initio tight-binding model as well as a minimal 3-band effective model for the valence bands of monolayers and bilayers of oxides derived from the Ruddlesden-Popper phase of perovskites, which is amenable to thin-layer formation. We illustrate the approach with the specific example of Sr$_2$TiO$_4$ layers but also provide model parameters for Ca$_2$TiO$_4$ and Ba$_2$TiO$_4$ .

Title: Stability of chiral magnon condensates in collinear antiferromagnetic insulators
Authors: Therese Frostad, Anne Louise Kristoffersen, Verena Brehm, Roberto E. Troncoso, Arne Brataas, Alireza Qaiumzadeh
Abstract: Quasiequilibrium magnon Bose-Einstein condensates in ferromagnetic insulators have been a field of great interest, while condensation in antiferromagnetic systems has not yet been explored in detail. We analyze the stability of condensed chiral magnons in two antiferromagnetic insulators: a uniaxial easy-axis system and a biaxial system. We show that two-component magnon condensation and inter-magnon interactions are essential to create metastable magnon condensation. The uniaxial system with a Rashba-type Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction supports two degenerate condensate populations at finite wave vectors. We find that the condensation state in this model is (meta)stable only when the distribution of condensed magnons between the two populations is symmetric. In addition, we demonstrate the emergence of a zero-sound-like Goldstone mode in antiferromagnetic systems that support two-component magnon condensation. On the other hand, in the biaxial system without Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, we predict that the magnon condensate cannot stabilize due to the breaking of the magnon degeneracy. Our results suggest that this instability is a general characteristic of single-component quasiequilibrium quasiparticle condensates.

Title: The underappreciated role of nonspecific interactions in the crystallization of DNA-coated colloids
Authors: Hunter Seyforth, Sambarta Chatterjee, Thomas E. Videbæk, Manodeep Mondal, William M. Jacobs, W. Benjamin Rogers
Abstract: Over the last decade, the field of programmable self-assembly has seen an explosion in the diversity of crystal lattices that can be synthesized from DNA-coated colloidal nanometer- and micrometer-scale particles. The prevailing wisdom has been that a particular crystal structure can be targeted by designing the DNA-mediated interactions, to enforce binding between specific particle pairs, and the particle diameters, to control the packing of the various species. In this article, we show that other ubiquitous nonspecific interactions can play equally important roles in determining the relative stability of different crystal polymorphs and therefore what crystal structure is most likely to form in an experiment. For a binary mixture of same-sized DNA-coated colloidal micrometer-scale particles, we show how changing the magnitudes of nonspecific steric and van der Waals interactions gives rise to a family of binary body-centered tetragonal crystals, including both cesium-chloride and copper-gold crystals. Simulations using pair potentials that account for these interactions reproduce our experimental observations quantitatively, and a theoretical model reveals how a subtle balance between specific and nonspecific forces determines the equilibrium crystal structure. These results highlight the importance of accounting for nonspecific interactions in the crystal-engineering design process.

Title: Phenomenological model of crack patterns in thin colloidal films undergoing desiccation
Authors: Yuri Yu. Tarasevich, Andrei V. Eserkepov, Irina V. Vodolazskaya, Avik P. Chatterjee
Abstract: A number of geometric and topological properties of samples of crack-template based conductive films are examined to assess the degree to which Voronoi diagrams can successfully model structure and conductivity in such networks. Our analysis suggests that although Poisson--Voronoi diagrams are only partially successful in modeling structural features of real-world crack patterns formed in films undergoing desiccation, such diagrams can nevertheless be useful in situations where topological characteristics are more important than geometric ones. A phenomenological model is proposed that is more accurate at capturing features of the real-world crack patterns.

Title: Neural Density Functional Theory in Higher Dimensions with Convolutional Layers
Authors: Felix Glitsch, Jens Weimar, Martin Oettel
Abstract: Based on recent advancements in using machine learning for classical density functional theory for systems with one-dimensional, planar inhomogeneities, we propose a machine learning model for application in two dimensions (2D) akin to density functionals in weighted density forms, as e. g. in fundamental measure theory (FMT). We implement the model with fast convolutional layers only and apply it to a system of hard disks in fully 2D inhomogeneous situations. The model is trained on a combination of smooth and steplike external potentials in the fluid phase. Pair correlation functions from test particle geometry show very satisfactory agreement with simulations although these types of external potentials have not been included in the training. The method should be fully applicable to 3D problems, where the bottleneck at the moment appears to be in obtaining smooth enough 3D histograms as training data from simulations.

Title: Dumbbell Fermions and Spin Models on Honeycomb Lattices
Authors: T. Banks
Abstract: We express Kitaev's exact solution of spin models on the honeycomb lattice as a special case of a higher dimensional duality between staggered Majorana fermions and Pauli spins. General models with bilinear nearest neighbor couplings of spins and external magnetic fields are soluble in this way. Each model gives rise to an infinite number of single particle fermion Schrodinger equations, depending on the choice of discrete gauge field flux.

Title: Proximity Effects Between the Graphene Quasicrystal and Magic-Angle Twisted Bilayer Graphene
Authors: Pedro Alcázar Guerrero, Viet-Hung Nguyen, Aron W. Cummings, Jean-Christophe Charlier, Stephan Roche
Abstract: We report a numerical study of graphene heterostructures comprised of three individual layers twisted by either the magic angle of $\sim$1.1$^\circ$, or $\sim$$30^\circ$, corresponding to the graphene quasicrystal. The heterostack is modeled using realistic structural and tight-binding models, while transport properties are calculated in both clean and disordered systems containing up to $\sim$8 million atoms. The weak interaction between different layers allows us to scrutinize the electronic mixing of flat bands and quasicrystalline states, which are altered differently in the low- and high-energy regimes and provide a new type of hybrid physics to be explored.

Title: Direct Observation of Massless Excitons and Linear Exciton Dispersion
Authors: Luna Y. Liu, Steffi Y. Woo, Jinyuan Wu, Bowen Hou, Cong Su, Diana Y. Qiu
Abstract: Excitons -- elementary excitations formed by bound electron-hole pairs -- govern the optical properties and excited-state dynamics of materials. In two-dimensions (2D), excitons are theoretically predicted to have a linear energy-momentum relation with a non-analytic discontinuity in the long wavelength limit, mimicking the dispersion of a photon. This results in an exciton that behaves like a massless particle, despite the fact that it is a composite boson composed of massive constituents. However, experimental observation of massless excitons has remained elusive. In this work, we unambiguously experimentally observe the predicted linear exciton dispersion in freestanding monolayer hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) using momentum-resolved electron energy-loss spectroscopy. The experimental result is in excellent agreement with our theoretical prediction based on ab initio many-body perturbation theory. Additionally, we identify the lowest dipole-allowed transition in monolayer hBN to be at 6.6 eV, illuminating a long-standing debate about the band gap of monolayer hBN. These findings provide critical insights into 2D excitonic physics and open new avenues for exciton-mediated superconductivity, Bose-Einstein condensation, and high-efficiency optoelectronic applications.

Title: Unsaturated Dinitrogen Difluoride under Pressure: toward high-Energy Density Polymerized NF Chains
Authors: Guo Chen, Ling Lin, Chengfeng Zhang, Jie Zhang, Gilles Frapper, Xianlong Wang
Abstract: Based on first-principles calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, the polymerisation of the unsaturated cis dinitrogen-difluoride (cis-N2F2) molecular compound is investigated. The thermodynamic, dynamical and thermal stabilities of the nitrogen fluorine NF system are investigated at conditions of 0-3000 K and 0-200 GPa. The cis-N2F2 molecule is a suitable precursor to obtain one-dimensional polymerized nitrogen-fluorine (poly-NF) chains at a pressure above 90 GPa and at a temperature around 1900 K. Importantly, these poly-NF chains can be quenched to room conditions, and potentially serve as a High-energy-density materials (HEDM). It has been established that when Al is utilised as a reducing agent, poly-NF chains exhibit a gravimetric energy density of 13.55 kJ/g, which exceeds that of cubic gauche nitrogen (cg-N, 9.70 kJ/g). This is attributable to the presence of both polymerised nitrogen and strong oxidising F atoms.

Title: Angular Dependence of Specific Heat and Magnetization Effects in the Kitaev Model
Authors: Takao Morinari, Hibiki Takegami
Abstract: We investigate the effect of a magnetic field on the Kitaev model using the equation of motion approach for the spin Green's function. Our study considers both cases: suppressed magnetization and finite magnetization in the paramagnetic phase of the Kitaev model. When magnetization is suppressed, the specific heat exhibits an angular dependence with a $60^\circ$ periodicity, consistent with recent experimental observations in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. This behavior can be interpreted as a signature of Majorana fermion gap formation. However, when magnetization is included, the periodicity shifts from $60^\circ$ to $180^\circ$, suggesting that the Majorana fermion gap behavior is no longer present in this regime. Our results indicate that the suppression of magnetization is essential for observing features associated with Majorana fermions, suggesting that a nearest-neighbor antiferromagnetic interaction could contribute to this suppression.

Title: Fluctuations of blowup time in a simple model of a super-Malthusian catastrophe
Authors: Baruch Meerson
Abstract: Motivated by the paradigm of a super-Maltusian population catastrophe, we study a simple stochastic population model which exhibits a finite-time blowup of the population size and is strongly affected by intrinsic noise. We focus on the fluctuations of the blowup time $T$ in the asexual binary reproduction model $2A \to 3A$, where two identical individuals give birth to a third one. We determine exactly the average blowup time as well as the probability distribution $\mathcal{P}(T)$ of the blowup time and its moments. In particular, we show that the long-time tail $\mathcal{P}(T\to \infty)$ is purely exponential. The short-time tail $\mathcal{P}(T\to 0)$ exhibits an essential singularity at $T=0$, and it is dominated by a single (the most likely) population trajectory which we determine analytically.

Title: Materials Map Integrating Experimental and Computational Data through Graph-Based Machine Learning for Enhanced Materials Discovery
Authors: Yusuke Hashimoto, Xue Jia, Hao Li, Takaaki Tomai
Abstract: Materials informatics (MI), which emerges from the integration of materials science and data science, is expected to greatly streamline the material discovery and development. The data used for MI are obtained from both computational and experimental studies, while their integration remains challenging. In our previous study, we reported the integration of these datasets by applying a machine learning model that captures trends hidden in the experimental datasets to compositional data stored in the computational database. In this study, we use the obtained data to construct materials maps, which visualize the relation in the structural features of materials, aiming to support study by the experimental researchers. The map is constructed using the MatDeepLearn (MDL) framework, which implements the graph-based representation of material structures, deep learning, and dimensional reduction for the map construction. We evaluate the obtained materials maps through statistical analysis and found that the MDL using message passing neural network (MPNN) enables efficient extraction of features that reflect the structural complexity of materials. Moreover, we found that this advantage does not necessarily translate into improved accuracy in predicting material properties. We attribute this unexpected outcome to the high learning performance inherent in MPNN, which can contribute to the structuring of data points within the materials map.

Abstract: High-entropy oxide (HEO) thermodynamics transcend temperature-centric approaches, spanning a multidimensional landscape where oxygen chemical potential plays a decisive role. Here, we experimentally demonstrate how controlling the oxygen chemical potential coerces multivalent cations into divalent states in rock salt HEOs. We construct a preferred valence phase diagram based on thermodynamic stability and equilibrium analysis, alongside a high throughput enthalpic stability map derived from atomistic calculations leveraging machine learning interatomic potentials. We identify and synthesize seven equimolar single-phase rock salt compositions that accommodate multivalent Mn, Fe, or both, as confirmed by X-ray diffraction and fluorescence. X-ray absorption fine structure spectra reveal predominantly divalent cations. Ultimately, we introduce oxygen chemical potential overlap as a key complementary descriptor predicting HEO stability and synthesizability. Although we focus on rock salt HEOs, our methods are chemically and structurally agnostic, providing a broadly adaptable framework for navigating HEOs thermodynamics and enabling a broader compositional range with contemporary property interest.

Title: Intrinsic low-temperature magnetic properties on the ultra-clean UTe$_2$ with $T_{\rm c}$ = 2.1 K revealed by $^{125}$Te NMR
Authors: Hiroki Matsumura, Shunsaku Kitagawa, Shiki Ogata, Riku Matsubayashi, Hiroki Fujibayashi, Katsuki Kinjo, Kenji Ishida, Yo Tokunaga, Hironori Sakai, Shinsaku Kambe, Ai Nakamura, Yusei Shimizu, Yoshiya Homma, Dexin Li, Fuminori Honda, Atsushi Miyake, Dai Aoki
Abstract: To investigate the intrinsic magnetic properties of UTe$_2$, we performed $^{125}$Te-NMR measurements on the ultra-clean single-crystalline UTe$_2$ with superconducting transition temperature $T_{\rm c}$ = 2.1~K and compared the results with those of the $T_{\rm c}$ = 1.6~K sample. The broadening of the linewidth of the NMR spectrum in the $a$-axis magnetic field and the low-temperature magnetic fluctuations observed in the 1.6~K sample are suppressed in the ultra-clean sample, indicating that such magnetic properties originate from a tiny amount of U deficiency. The present results suggest that the magnetic properties in UTe$_2$ are sensitive to the U deficiency. We also observed a peculiar angular dependence of the NMR quantities due to large magnetic anisotropy with the $a$-axis as the magnetic easy axis.

Title: Cooperation and competing of antipolar charge order and superconducting states in a quasi-2D superatomic metallic crystal
Authors: Shuya Xing, Zhongxu Wei, Xu Chen, Junming Zhang, Zhenyu Yuan, Jiali Zhao, Feng Jin, Tao Sun, Huifen Ren, Minjie Cui, Hong Chang, Tianping Ying, Jiangang Guo, Xiaolong Chen, Shifeng Zhao, Wenping Zhou, Xinqi Li, Tian Qian, Zhihai Cheng
Abstract: Exploring various unexpected new quantum states and their corresponding extraordinary physics in low dimensional quantum materials, and investing them into application fields, is a primary concern of condensed matter physics. Previously, we performed joint experiments and theoretical calculations to investigate a superatomic crystal of Au6Te12Se8 with low symmetry, which stacks through non-covalent inter-cube quasi-bonds. Au6Te12Se8 exhibits a triple-cube charge density wave and spatially polarized metallic states interweaving at 9 K. In addition, it undergoes a BKT phase transition at 2.8 K to form a quasi-two-dimensional superconducting state. The subsequent high-pressure experimental results indicate that the two quantum states above compete with superconductivity. Here, we experimentally revealed competition and coexistence among superconductivity, triple-cube charge density waves, and polarized metallic states during further temperature-decreasing process, as examined using ultra-low temperature scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy, transport measurement, and Raman spectra. An extraordinary inversion symmetry broken emerged inside the triple-cube-period of the original CDW at 300 mK, leading to the polarized metallic states transforming into parallel polarization states. The evidence of spontaneous polarization coexisting with superconductivity in real space is extremely rare and has been revealed by STM. In addition, transport and Raman measurements indicate that there are multiple phase transition temperatures from 80K to that below the superconducting transition temperature of Au6Te12Se8, which may also contain more unknown exotic quantum states, providing a platform for further exploration of intriguing physical properties.

Title: Canonical equilibrium of mean-field $O(n)$~models in presence of random fields
Authors: Soumya Kanti Pal, Shamik Gupta
Abstract: We study canonical-equilibrium properties of Random Field $O(n)$ Models involving classical continuous vector spins of $n$ components with mean-field interactions and subject to disordered fields acting on individual spins. To this end, we employ two complementary approaches: the mean-field approximation, valid for any disorder distribution, and the replica trick, applicable when the disordered fields are sampled from a Gaussian distribution. On the basis of an exact analysis, we demonstrate that when replica symmetry holds, both the approaches yield identical expression for the free energy per spin of the system. As consequences, we study the case of $n=2$ ($XY$ spins) and that of $n=3$ (Heisenberg spins) for two representative choices of the disorder distribution, namely, a Gaussian and a symmetric bimodal distribution. For both $n=2$ and $n=3$, we demonstrate that while the magnetization exhibits a continuous phase transition as a function of temperature for the Gaussian case, the transition could be either continuous or first-order with an emergent tricriticality when the disorder distribution is bimodal. We also discuss in the context of our models the issue of self-averaging of extensive variables near the critical point of a continuous phase transition.

Title: Spectral Flow for the Riemann zeros
Authors: André LeClair
Abstract: Recently, with Mussardo we defined a quantum mechanical problem of a single particle scattering with impurities wherein the quantized energy levels $E_n (\sigma)$ are exactly equal to the zeros of the Riemann $\zeta (s)$ where $\sigma = \Re (s)$ in the limit $\sigma \to 1/2$. The S-matrix is based on the Euler product and is unitary by construction, thus the underlying hamiltonian is hermitian and all eigenvalues must be real. Motivated by the Hilbert-Pólya idea we study the spectral flows for $\{ E_n (\sigma) \}$. This leads to a simple criterion for the validity of the Riemann Hypothesis. The spectral flow arguments are simple enough that we present analogous results for the Generalized and Grand Riemann Hypotheses. We also illustrate our results for a counter example where the Riemann Hypothesis is violated since there is no underlying unitary S-matrix due to the lack of an Euler product.

Title: Quantum thermal machine regimes in the transverse-field Ising model
Authors: Vishnu Muraleedharan Sajitha, Bodhaditya Santra, Matthew J. Davis, L. A. Williamson
Abstract: We identify and interpret the possible quantum thermal machine regimes with a transverse-field Ising model as the working substance. In general, understanding the emergence of such regimes in a many-body quantum system is challenging due to the dependence on the many energy levels in the system. By considering infinitesimal work strokes, we can understand the operation from equilibrium properties of the system. We find that infinitesimal work strokes enable both heat engine and accelerator operation, with the output and boundaries of operation described by macroscopic properties of the system, in particular the net transverse magnetization. At low temperatures, the regimes of operation and performance can be understood from quasiparticles in the system, while at high temperatures an expansion of the free energy in powers of inverse temperature describes the operation. The understanding generalises to larger work strokes when the temperature difference between the hot and cold reservoirs is large. For hot and cold reservoirs close in temperature, a sufficiently large work stroke can enable refrigerator and heater regimes. Our results and method of analysis will prove useful in understanding the possible regimes of operation of quantum many-body thermal machines more generally.

Title: Topological stabilizer models on continuous variables
Authors: Julio C. Magdalena de la Fuente, Tyler D. Ellison, Meng Cheng, Dominic J. Williamson
Abstract: We construct a family of two-dimensional topological stabilizer codes on continuous variable (CV) degrees of freedom, which generalize homological rotor codes and the toric-GKP code. Our topological codes are built using the concept of boson condensation -- we start from a parent stabilizer code based on an $\mathbb{R}$ gauge theory and condense various bosonic excitations. This produces a large class of topological CV stabilizer codes, including ones that are characterized by the anyon theories of $U(1)_{2n}\times U(1)_{-2m}$ Chern-Simons theories, for arbitrary pairs of positive integers $(n,m)$. Most notably, this includes anyon theories that are non-chiral and nevertheless do not admit a gapped boundary. It is widely believed that such anyon theories cannot be realized by any stabilizer model on finite-dimensional systems. We conjecture that these CV codes go beyond codes obtained from concatenating a topological qudit code with a local encoding into CVs, and thus, constitute the first example of topological codes that are intrinsic to CV systems. Moreover, we study the Hamiltonians associated to the topological CV stabilizer codes and show that, although they have a gapless spectrum, they can become gapped with the addition of a quadratic perturbation. We show that similar methods can be used to construct a gapped Hamiltonian whose anyon theory agrees with a $U(1)_2$ Chern-Simons theory. Our work initiates the study of scalable stabilizer codes that are intrinsic to CV systems and highlights how error-correcting codes can be used to design and analyze many-body systems of CVs that model lattice gauge theories.

Title: Dynamics of edge modes in monitored Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Models
Authors: Giulia Salatino, Gianluca Passarelli, Angelo Russomanno, Giuseppe E. Santoro, Procolo Lucignano, Rosario Fazio
Abstract: We investigate the effect of dissipation on the dynamics of edge modes in the monitored Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. Our study considers both a linear observable and a nonlinear entanglement measure, namely the two-point correlation function and the Disconnected Entanglement Entropy (DEE), as diagnostic tools. While dissipation inevitably alters the entanglement properties observed in the closed system, statistical analysis of quantum trajectories reveals that by protecting the chain's edges from dissipation, it is possible to recover characteristic features analogous to those found in the unitary limit. This highlights the fundamental role of spatial dissipation patterns in shaping the dynamics of edge modes in monitored systems.

Title: Quantum combinatorial optimization beyond the variational paradigm: simple schedules for hard problems
Authors: Tim Bode, Krish Ramesh, Tobias Stollenwerk
Abstract: Advances in quantum algorithms suggest a tentative scaling advantage on certain combinatorial optimization problems. Recent work, however, has also reinforced the idea that barren plateaus render variational algorithms ineffective on large Hilbert spaces. Hence, finding annealing protocols by variation ultimately appears to be difficult. Similarly, the adiabatic theorem fails on hard problem instances with first-order quantum phase transitions. Here, we show how to use the spin coherent-state path integral to shape the geometry of quantum adiabatic evolution, leading to annealing protocols at polynomial overhead that provide orders-of-magnitude improvements in the probability to measure optimal solutions, relative to linear protocols. These improvements are not obtained on a controllable toy problem but on randomly generated hard instances (Sherrington-Kirkpatrick and Maximum 2-Satisfiability), making them generic and robust. Our method works for large systems and may thus be used to improve the performance of state-of-the-art quantum devices.

Title: Dynamic Realization of Majorana Zero Modes in a Particle-Conserving Ladder
Authors: Anais Defossez, Laurens Vanderstraeten, Lucila Peralta Gavensky, Nathan Goldman
Abstract: We present a scheme to realize a topological superconducting system supporting Majorana zero modes, within a number-conserving framework suitable for optical-lattice experiments. Our approach builds on the engineering of pair-hopping processes on a ladder geometry, using a sequence of pulses that activate single-particle hopping in a time-periodic manner. We demonstrate that this dynamic setting is well captured by an effective Hamiltonian that preserves the parity symmetry, a key requirement for the stabilization of Majorana zero modes. The phase diagram of our system is determined using a bosonization theory, which is then validated by a numerical study of the topological bulk gap and entanglement spectrum using matrix product states. Our results indicate that Majorana zero modes can be stabilized in a large parameter space, accessible in optical-lattice experiments.

Title: Topological Constraints on Defect Dynamics
Authors: Andrea Antinucci, Christian Copetti, Giovanni Galati, Giovanni Rizi
Abstract: Extended objects (defects) in Quantum Field Theory exhibit rich, nontrivial dynamics describing a variety of physical phenomena. These systems often involve strong coupling at long distances, where the bulk and defects interact, making analytical studies challenging. By carefully analyzing the behavior of bulk symmetries in the presence of defects, we uncover robust topological constraints on defect RG flows. Specifically, we introduce the notions of $\textit{defect anomalies}$ and $\textit{symmetry reflecting defects}$, both of which are RG-invariant. Several known notions, such as higher-form symmetries, fractionalization, and projective lines, are revealed to be manifestations of defect anomalies, which also encompass novel phenomena and forbid trivial defect dynamics in the IR. Meanwhile, symmetry reflecting defects are shown to remain coupled at low energies, imposing powerful dynamical constraints. We verify our findings through concrete examples: exactly solvable defect RG flows in (1+1)d Conformal Field Theories with symmetry reflecting lines and a surface defect in (2+1)d scalar QED.

Title: On-the-Fly Path Planning for the Design of Compositional Gradients in High Dimensions
Authors: Samuel Price, Zhaoxi Cao, Ian McCue
Abstract: Functional gradients have recently experienced an explosion in activity due to advances in manufacturing, where compositions can now be spatially varied on-the-fly during fabrication. In addition, modern computational thermodynamics has reached sufficient maturity -- with respect to property databases and the availability of commercial software -- that gradients can be designed with specific sets of properties. Despite these successes, there are practical limitations on the calculation speeds of these thermodynamic tools that make it intractable to model every element in an alloy. As a result, most path planning is carried out via surrogate models on simplified systems (e.g., approximating Inconel 718 as Ni$_{59}$Cr$_{23}$Fe$_{18}$ instead of Ni$_{53}$Cr$_{23}$Fe$_{18}$Nb$_{3}$Mo$_{2}$Ti$_{1}$). In this work, we demonstrate that this limitation can be overcome using a combination of on-the-fly sampling and a conjectured corollary of the lever rule for transformations of isothermal paths in arbitrary compositional dimensions. We quantitatively benchmark the effectiveness of this new method and find that it can be as much as 106 times more efficient than surrogate modeling.

Title: Unveiling a Hidden Percolation Transition in Monitored Clifford Circuits: Inroads from ZX-Calculus
Authors: Einat Buznach, Debanjan Chowdhury, Jonathan Ruhman
Abstract: We revisit the measurement-induced phase transition (MPT) in Clifford circuits, which are both classically simulable and exhibit critical behavior widely believed to be distinct from classical percolation theory, using ZX-calculus. We analyze the MPT in a dynamical model composed of CNOT, SWAP, identity gates, and Bell-pair measurements, respectively, arranged randomly in a brickwork pattern. Our circuits exhibit a transition that is seemingly distinct from classical percolation based on standard arguments, that is in line with the prevailing understanding in the field. In contrast, by employing ZX-calculus based simplification techniques, we unveil a hidden percolation transition within the circuit structure. Over a range of parameters tied to the probabilities for applying different gates, we demonstrate that the classical percolation transition in the ZX-simplified network coincides with the MPT observed through mutual information. Our findings suggest that the MPT in Clifford circuits is, in fact, controlled by a classical percolation transition in disguise.

Title: Exactly solvable model of the square-root price impact dynamics under the long-range market-order correlation
Authors: Yuki Sato, Kiyoshi Kanazawa
Abstract: In econophysics, there are several enigmatic empirical laws: (i)~the market-order flow has strong persistence (long-range order-sign correlation), well formulated as the Lillo-Mike-Farmer model. This phenomenon seems paradoxical given the diffusive and unpredictable price dynamics; (ii)~the price impact $I(Q)$ of a large metaorder $Q$ follows the square-root law, $I(Q)\propto \sqrt{Q}$. In this Letter, we propose an exactly solvable model of the nonlinear price-impact dynamics that unifies these enigmas. We generalize the Lillo-Mike-Farmer model to nonlinear price-impact dynamics, which is mapped to an exactly solvable Lévy-walk model. Our exact solution and numerical simulations reveal three important points: First, the price dynamics remains diffusive under the square-root law, even under the long-range correlation. Second, price-movement statistics follows truncated power laws with typical exponent around three. Third, volatility has long memory. While this simple model lacks adjustable free parameters, it naturally aligns even with other enigmatic empirical laws, such as (iii)~the inverse-cubic law for price statistics and (iv)~volatility clustering. This work illustrates the crucial role of the square-root law in understanding rich and complex financial price dynamics from a single coherent viewpoint.

Title: Optimal Symbolic Construction of Matrix Product Operators and Tree Tensor Network Operators
Authors: Hazar Çakır, Richard M. Milbradt, Christian B. Mendl
Abstract: This research introduces an improved framework for constructing matrix product operators (MPOs) and tree tensor network operators (TTNOs), crucial tools in quantum simulations. A given (Hamiltonian) operator typically has a known symbolic "sum of operator strings" form that can be translated into a tensor network structure. Combining the existing bipartite-graph-based approach and a newly introduced symbolic Gaussian elimination preprocessing step, our proposed method improves upon earlier algorithms in cases when Hamiltonian terms share the same prefactors. We test the performance of our method against established ones for benchmarking purposes. Finally, we apply our methodology to the model of a cavity filled with molecules in a solvent. This open quantum system is cast into the hierarchical equation of motion (HEOM) setting to obtain an effective Hamiltonian. Construction of the corresponding TTNO demonstrates a sub-linear increase of the maximum bond dimension.

Title: Temporal CW polarization-tomography of photon pairs from the biexciton radiative cascade: theory and experiment
Authors: Noam Tur, Ismail Nassar, Ido Schwartz, Joseph Avron, Dan Dalacu, Philip J. Poole, David Gershoni
Abstract: We study, experimentally and theoretically, temporal correlations between the polarization of photon pairs emitted during the biexciton-exciton radiative cascade from a single semiconductor quantum dot, optically excited by a continuous-wave light source. The system is modeled by a Lindbladian coupled to two Markovian baths: One bath represents the continuous light source, and a second represents the emitted radiation. Very good agreement is obtained between the theoretical model that we constructed and a set of 36 different time resolved, polarization correlation measurements between cascading photon pairs.

Title: Quantum Averaging for High-Fidelity Quantum Logic Gates
Authors: Kristian D. Barajas, Wesley C. Campbell
Abstract: We present a two-timescale quantum averaging theory (QAT) for analytically modeling unitary dynamics in driven quantum systems. Combining the unitarity-preserving Magnus expansion with the method of averaging on multiple scales, QAT addresses the simultaneous presence of distinct timescales by generating a rotating frame with a dynamical phase operator that toggles with the high-frequency dynamics and yields an effective Hamiltonian for the slow degree of freedom. By retaining the fast-varying effects, we demonstrate the high precision achievable by applying this analytic technique to model a high-fidelity two-qubit quantum gate beyond the validity of first-order approximations. The results rapidly converge with numerical calculations of a fast-entangling Mølmer-Sørensen trapped-ion-qubit gate in the strong-field regime, illustrating QAT's ability to simultaneously provide both an intuitive, effective-Hamiltonian model and high accuracy.

Title: Detuning-symmetric laser cooling of many mechanical modes with a photothermally modified cavity
Authors: Thomas J. Clark, Jiaxing Ma, Jack C. Sankey
Abstract: We simultaneously cool $\gtrsim$100 mechanical modes of a membrane with a photothermally modified optical cavity driven by a single blue-detuned laser. In contrast to radiation pressure and bolometric forces applied directly to the mechanical system, this cooling effect does not depend on the sign of detuning, allowing for single-laser stabilization (i.e., simultaneous positive optical spring and damping) that is especially effective at room temperature and high laser power. We also provide intuition about the competing thermal processes, and propose two simple modifications to the mirror coatings that can strongly enhance this effect.

Title: A low-background setup for in-situ X-ray total scattering combined with fast scanning calorimetry
Authors: Peihao Sun, Jacopo Baglioni, Beatrice Baraldi, Weilong Chen, Daniele Lideo, Lara Piemontese, Francesco Dallari, Marco Di Michiel, Giulio Monaco
Abstract: We demonstrate a setup combining fast scanning calorimetry with X-ray total scattering at a synchrotron beamline, allowing for \emph{in-situ} characterizations of the nano-scale structure of samples during and after temperature scans. The setup features a portable vacuum chamber giving high signal-to-background ratio even on amorphous samples, which enables the observation of detailed structural changes between different sample states. We show three use cases, including one which leverages the high cooling rate of 10$^4$\,K/s achievable by this setup. Our demonstration opens the door to various applications in materials science where it is important to understand the interplay between structure and thermodynamics.
