Title: Photothermomechanicaly Efficient, Low-Cost, High-Cycle-Life, Hybrid MXene-Polymer Actuators
Authors: Ken Iiyoshi, Georgios Korres, Orsolya Nagy, Gabriel Roldán, Panče Naumov, Stefan Schramm, Mohamad Eid
Abstract: Photothermomechanical polymer film actuators stand out among the dynamic components available for soft robotics due to a combination of assets, such as capability for rapid energy transduction, wireless control, and ease of miniaturization. Despite their anticipated superior performance, several design challenges remain. These include high operational temperatures, inadequate mechanical output relative to the radiation energy provided, limited durability during repeated use, and high production costs; such factors hinder the scalability of these actuating materials in practical applications. Here, we report a viable solution by substituting performance-enhancing nanoparticles with MXenes--carbon-based, two-dimensional materials known for their theoretical photothermal conversion efficiency of up to 100%. This led to the development of MXene-dispersed polymer trilayer actuators (MPTAs). Extensive photothermal and thermomechanical characterization demonstrated superior performance compared to previously reported actuators, with a reduced shed power demand (0.1 mW cm$^{-2}$ $^\circ$C$^{-1}$), substantial bending capacity per irradiation power per time (0.1$^\circ$ mW$^{-1}$ cm$^{2}$ s$^{-1}$), and enhanced cyclic longevity, with fatigueless operation of at least 1,000 cycles. We demonstrate three applications: A kirigami-inspired flower, parallel manipulator, and soft gripper. Additionally, these materials are cost-effective; thus, they are the optimal choice for long-term, reversible operation with efficient heat-to-work transduction.

Title: Poroelasticity of bottlebrush and linear polymer networks
Authors: Nolan A. Miller, Alfred J. Crosby
Abstract: The transport of solvent molecules through soft, swollen networks is critical in both natural and engineered systems. While this poroelastic flow has traditionally been explored in networks where the mesh size is comparable to the solvent molecule size, the effect of network architecture on permeability remains underexplored. Here we investigate solvent transport in linear polymer networks (LPN) and highly elastic bottlebrush elastomer networks (BBN), where the presence of densely grafted sidechains allows for control over swelling and mechanical properties. By synthesizing BBNs with systematically varied crosslinking density while maintaining constant sidechain length and grafting density, we probe the poroelastic response in the stretched backbone regime (SBB). Poroelastic relaxation indentation experiments, performed in toluene, reveal how permeability scales with crosslink density and polymer volume fraction. Compared to LPN with identical chemistry, the BBN exhibited a lower permeability scaling exponent with polymer volume fraction that closely matches the theoretical exponent. Despite architectural differences, permeability data for both networks collapse onto a single curve when plotted against dry shear modulus. Our findings demonstrate that molecular network architecture significantly influences permeability, offering new routes to tailor solvent transport in soft, swollen networks. These insights highlight BBNs as a promising platform for applications in permeable membranes, filtration, and microfluidic systems, and pave the way for further studies on how network parameters, such as sidechain length, impact permeability in these highly tunable materials.

Title: When wall slip wins over shear flow: A temperature-dependent Eyring slip law and a thermal multiscale model for diamond-like carbon lubricated by a polyalphaolefin oil
Authors: Stefan Peeters, Edder J. García, Franziska Stief, Thomas Reichenbach, Kerstin Falk, Gianpietro Moras, Michael Moseler
Abstract: The quantitative description of lubricant flow in nanoscale channels is complicated by various finite-size effects that are not taken into account in conventional thermo-elasto-hydrodynamic lubrication (TEHL) models. One of these effects is wall slip, a phenomenon that has been extensively studied both theoretically and experimentally. The relationship between wall slip and thermal effects is intricate, and some authors debate whether the friction reduction observed in their experiments in the TEHL regime can be explained by either slip or viscosity reduction in heated lubricants. To disentangle these mechanisms, a comprehensive molecular dynamics study of the relationship between temperature and slip in the shear flow of a 4 cSt polyalphaolefin (PAO4) base oil in a nanoscale diamond-like carbon (DLC) channel is performed here. An Eyring law describes the relationship between slip velocity and shear stress at the solid-liquid interface for a given temperature and pressure. The same simulation campaign provides a pressure-dependent law for the interface thermal resistance (ITR) between DLC and PAO4. These constitutive laws are employed in a continuum model for lubricated parallel channels. By taking heat conduction into account and combining the slip and ITR laws with a temperature- and pressure-dependent Eyring viscosity law, questions about the competition of slip and thermal thinning of the lubricant can be answered. For DLC film thicknesses compatible with tribological experiments and applications, this model shows that slip is only relevant for very thin lubricant films that are typical of boundary lubrication, suggesting the dominance of thermal thinning in the TEHL regime.

Title: Homogenization framework for rigid and non-rigid foldable origami metamaterials
Authors: Xuwen Li, Amin Jamalimehr, Mathias Legrand, Damiano Pasini
Abstract: Origami metamaterials typically consist of folded sheets with periodic patterns, conferring them with remarkable mechanical properties. In the context of Continuum Mechanics, the majority of existing predictive methods are mechanism analogs which favor rigid folding and panel bending. While effective in predicting primary deformation modes, existing methods fall short in capturing the full spectrum of deformation of non-rigid foldable origami, such as the emergence of curvature along straight creases, local strain at vertices and warpage in panels. To fully capture the entire deformation spectrum and enhance the accuracy of existing methods, this paper introduces a homogenization framework for origami metamaterials where the faces are modeled as plate elements. Both asymptotic and energy-based homogenization methods are formulated and implemented. As a representative crease pattern, we examine the Miura origami sheet homogenized as an equivalent Kirchhoff-Love plate. The results reveal that certain effective elastic properties are nonlinearly related to both the initial fold angle and the crease stiffness. When benchmarked with results from fully resolved simulations, our framework yields errors up to 12.9\%, while existing models, including the bar-and-hinge model and the rigid-panel model, show up to 161\% error. The differences in errors are associated with the complex modes of crease and panel deformation in non-rigid origami, unexplored by the existing models. This work demonstrates a precise and efficient continuum framework for origami metamaterials as an effective strategy for predicting their elastic properties, understanding their mechanics, and designing their functionalities.

Title: Ostwald Ripening in Underground Gas Storage
Authors: Mohammad Salehpour, Tian Lan, Nicolas Bueno, Md Zahidul Islam Laku, Yashar Mehmani, Benzhong Zhao
Abstract: Underground gas storage is central to both climate mitigation and energy transition strategies, supporting both long-term carbon sequestration and seasonal hydrogen storage. A key mechanism governing the fate of injected gases is Ostwald ripening, the curvature-driven mass transfer between trapped gas ganglia in porous media. While ripening is well understood in open systems, its behavior in geometrically confined porous structures remains poorly characterized, especially over long timescales relevant to subsurface operations. Here, we present ultra-high-resolution microfluidic experiments that capture the evolution of residually trapped hydrogen over weeks in realistic, heterogeneous pore geometries under well-defined boundary conditions. We observe a distinct two-stage dynamic: a rapid local equilibration among neighboring bubbles, followed by slow global depletion driven by long-range diffusion toward low-chemical potential boundaries. Building on these insights, we develop and validate a continuum model that couples microscale capillary pressure-saturation (Pc-s) relationships, extracted via the pore-morphology method, with macroscopic diffusive transport. The model accurately predicts gas saturation evolution without fitting parameters and collapses experimental results across a range of experimental conditions. Extending the model to reservoir scales, we estimate equilibration timescales for CO2 and H2 in homogeneous sandstone aquifers. We find that ripening occurs much faster than convective dissolution in CO2 sequestration, and on timescales comparable to seasonal H2 storage operations. These findings establish a quantitative framework linking pore-scale heterogeneity to field-scale gas redistribution, with implications for the design and longevity of subsurface storage strategies.

Title: Phase-Field Modeling of Two-Phase Flows: A Projection-Based Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes Framework
Authors: Sukriti Manna, Constantine M Megaridis, Subramanian KRS Sankaranarayanan
Abstract: The coupled Cahn-Hilliard and Navier-Stokes (CH-NS) equations provide a powerful framework for modeling multiphase flows with diffuse interfaces, enabling simulations of droplet breakup, bubble dynamics, and hydrodynamic instabilities. These capabilities are vital in boiling heat transfer, microfluidics, coating, additive manufacturing, and oil-water separation, where resolving fluid-fluid interactions is essential. Numerically, the CH-NS system is challenging: the Cahn-Hilliard equation involves higher-order derivatives and nonlinearities, and coupling with Navier-Stokes introduces strong two-way interactions. The velocity field advects the phase field, while the evolving interface alters density and viscosity, feeding back into the flow. Variable-density and variable-viscosity systems further increase complexity, requiring accurate treatment of property contrasts without losing stability or mass conservation. To address this, we employ a decoupled pressure-projection method with finite differences on staggered grids and explicit Euler time stepping. Our formulation extends the CH-NS system to homogeneous and variable-property fluids with consistent hydrodynamic-phase-field coupling. Validation against canonical benchmarks-including bubble rise and Plateau-Taylor instability shows excellent agreement in rise velocity, interface shape, and instability wavelength. This framework establishes a reproducible foundation for multiphysics extensions such as heat transfer, phase change, and electrohydrodynamics in boiling, droplet manipulation, and electronics cooling

Title: Self-organized learning emerges from coherent coupling of critical neurons
Authors: Chuanbo Liu, Jin Wang
Abstract: Deep artificial neural networks have surpassed human-level performance across a diverse array of complex learning tasks, establishing themselves as indispensable tools in both social applications and scientific research. Despite these advances, the underlying mechanisms of training in artificial neural networks remain elusive. Here, we propose that artificial neural networks function as adaptive, self-organizing information processing systems in which training is mediated by the coherent coupling of strongly activated, task-specific critical neurons. We demonstrate that such neuronal coupling gives rise to Hebbian-like neural correlation graphs, which undergo a dynamic, second-order connectivity phase transition during the initial stages of training. Concurrently, the connection weights among critical neurons are consistently reinforced while being simultaneously redistributed in a stochastic manner. As a result, a precise balance of neuronal contributions is established, inducing a local concentration within the random loss landscape which provides theoretical explanation for generalization capacity. We further identify a later on convergence phase transition characterized by a phase boundary in hyperparameter space, driven by the nonequilibrium probability flux through weight space. The critical computational graphs resulting from coherent coupling also decode the predictive rules learned by artificial neural networks, drawing analogies to avalanche-like dynamics observed in biological neural circuits. Our findings suggest that the coherent coupling of critical neurons and the ensuing local concentration within the loss landscapes may represent universal learning mechanisms shared by both artificial and biological neural computation.

Title: A correction tensor for approximating drag on slow-moving particles of arbitrary shape
Authors: Duncan A. Lockerby
Abstract: A new form of the Cunningham correction factor is presented that requires no experimental fitting. It is expanded to provide a predictive heuristic for non-spherical particles, via definition of a "correction tensor''. Its accuracy is tested against experiments and kinetic theory for the sphere, and stochastic solutions to the Boltzmann equation for a range of spheroids. It represents a simple, general tool for approximating transport properties of non-spherical micro/nano particles in a gas.

Title: Statistical Mechanics of Paraparticles
Authors: Nupoor Thakur, Navinder Singh
Abstract: Quantum mechanics broadly classifies the particles into two categories: $(1)$ fermions and $(2)$ bosons. Fermions are half-integer spin particles, obeying Pauli's exclusion principle and Fermi-Dirac statistics. Whereas bosons are integer spin particles, not obeying Pauli's exclusion principle, and obeying Bose-Einstein statistics. However, there are two exceptions to this standard case: first, anyons, which exist in 2-dimensional systems, and secondly, paraparticles, which can exist in any dimension. Paraparticles follow their non-trivial parastatistics, obeying their generalised exclusion principle. In this paper, we provide a detailed review of the foundations of paraparticle statistics established in \cite{wang2025particle}. We extend this work further and then derive an important expression for the heat capacity of paraparticles for a specific case, which would provide a handle for the experimental detection of paraparticles in appropriate systems.

Title: Majorana edge modes in number-conserving models with long-range interactions
Authors: Jaden Thomas-Markarian, Kartiek Agarwal, Ivar Martin
Abstract: Topological superconductors are believed to host exotic quasiparticle excitations known as Majorana zero-modes, with much of the evidence based on BCS mean-field theory. The direct application of mean-field arguments is tenuous in finite, isolated systems relevant in some experiments. Here, we numerically study fermion number-conserving models with long-range interactions, which under periodic boundary conditions exhibit robust topological and non-topological superconductivity, tuned by the strength of interaction [1]. We find evidence that, on the topological side, Majorana edge modes appear in open chains, manifesting as the vanishing of the energy splitting between odd- and even-parity ground states with increasing system size. Additionally, off-diagonal two-point correlation functions show nonlocal, parity-dependent edge effects consistent with Majorana phenomenology. We develop a correlation-based method revealing the spatial structure of Majorana modes in this fully interacting many-body setting.

Title: Nonadiabatic Wave-Packet Dynamics: Nonadiabatic Metric, Quantum Geometry, and Analogue Gravity
Authors: Yafei Ren, M. E. Sanchez Barrero
Abstract: We develop a unified theory for the nonadiabatic wave-packet dynamics of Bloch electrons subject to slowly varying spatial and temporal perturbations. Extending the conventional wave-packet ansatz to include interband contributions, we derive equations for the interband coefficients using the time-dependent variational principle, referred to as the wave-packet coefficient equation. Solving these equations and integrating out interband contributions yields the leading-order nonadiabatic corrections to the wave-packet Lagrangian. These corrections appear in three forms: (i) a nonadiabatic metric in real and momentum space, which we identify with the energy-gap-renormalized quantum metric, (ii) modified Berry connections associated with the motion of the wave-packet center, and (iii) an energy correction arising from spatial and temporal variations of the Hamiltonian. This metric reformulates the wave-packet dynamics as geodesic motion in phase space, enabling an analogue-gravity perspective in condensed matter systems. As an application, we analyze one-dimensional Dirac electron systems under a slowly varying exchange field $\bm{m}$. Our results demonstrate that variations in the magnitude of $\bm{m}$ are important to nonadiabatic dynamics, in sharp contrast to the adiabatic regime where directional variations of $\bm{m}$ are crucial.

Title: Percolation transition in entangled granular networks
Authors: Seongmin Kim, Daihui Wu, Yilong Han
Abstract: Highly nonconvex granular particles, such as staples and metal shavings, can form solid-like cohesive structures through geometric entanglement (interlocking). The network structure formed by this entanglement, however, remains largely unexplored. Here we utilize network science to investigate the entanglement networks of C-shaped granular particles under vibration through experiments and simulations. By analyzing key network properties, we demonstrate that these networks undergo a percolation transition as the number of links increases logarithmically over time; the entangled particles form a giant cluster when the number of links exceeds a critical threshold. We propose a continuum percolation model of rings that effectively describes the observed transition. Additionally, we find that particle's opening angle significantly affects mechanical bonding and, consequently, the network structure. This work highlights the potential of network-based approaches to study entangled materials, paving the way for advancements in applications ranging from mechanical metamaterials to entangled robot swarms.

Title: Pattern formation in a coupled driven diffusive system
Authors: G. E. Freire Oliveira, R. Dickman, M. O. Lavrentovich, R. K. P. Zia
Abstract: We investigate pattern formation in a driven mixture of two repulsive particles by introducing a Field-based Lattice Model (FLM), a hybrid model that combines aspects of the driven Widom-Rowlison lattice gas (DWRLG) and its statistical field theory \cite{DWRLG1,DWRLG2}. We find that the FLM effectively captures the bulk behavior of the DWRLG in both low- and high-density phases, suggesting that phase transitions in these models may share a universality class. Under the effect of the drive, the FLM additionally reveals an intermediate regime, not reported in the previous DWRLG studies, characterized by ``irregular stripes" with widely fluctuating widths, contrasting with the ``regular", well-ordered stripes found at higher densities. In this intermediate phase, the system exhibits long-range order, predominantly perpendicular to the drive direction. To construct a continuum description, we derive two coupled partial differential equations via a gradient expansion of the FLM mean mass-transfer equations, supplemented with additive noise. Designing a numerical solver using the pseudospectral method with dealiasing and stochastic time differencing, we reproduce the low-density microemulsion phase (characterized by a non-zero characteristic wavenumber $q^*$) and perpendicular stripes at high density. We identify the non-zero difference in the characteristic velocities of the fields as a necessary condition for perpendicular stripe formation in the high-density phase. The continuum model also uncovers novel behaviors not previously observed in the FLM, such as stripes aligned parallel to the drive and chaotic patterns. This work highlights how the interplay of external drive, particle interactions, and noise can lead to a rich phenomenology in strongly driven binary mixtures.

Title: Universal Mott quantum criticality in a modified periodic Anderson model
Authors: Sujan K. K., N. S. Vidhyadhiraja
Abstract: Mott quantum criticality is a central theme in correlated electron physics, observed in systems featuring both continuous zero-temperature transitions and those with finite-temperature critical endpoints. Within dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT), the paradigmatic single-band Hubbard model (SBHM) displays such criticality only above a finite-temperature endpoint. In contrast, the modified periodic Anderson model (MPAM) is a rare example known to host a surface of genuinely continuous Mott quantum critical points (QCPs) at zero temperature. Using DMFT with the numerical renormalization group as an impurity solver, we investigate the finite-temperature, real-frequency properties of the MPAM. Our central finding is the emergence of quantum critical scaling in the electrical resistivity, with critical exponents $z_{\text{met}} = 0.76$ and $z_{\text{ins}} = 0.66$ on the metallic and insulating sides, respectively. These values fall within the range reported for the SBHM, suggesting that both transitions are governed by a common universality class. We further substantiate the presence of local quantum criticality by demonstrating robust $\omega/T$ scaling in single- and two-particle correlation functions. Finally, we identify novel transport signatures in the optical conductivity, where the distinct evolution of two isosbestic points serves as a unique fingerprint of the QCP. These results establish the MPAM as a canonical model for investigating genuine Mott quantum criticality and support the existence of a universal framework for this fundamental phenomenon.

Title: Impact of periodic thermal driving on heat fluctuations in a harmonic system
Authors: Felipe P. Abreu, Welles A. M. Morgado
Abstract: The thermodynamics of mesoscopic systems driven by time-varying temperatures is crucial for understanding biological systems, designing nanoscale engines, and performing micro-particle cooling. In this work, we analyze an underdamped Brownian particle in a harmonic trap under a sinusoidal thermal protocol. Through analytical methods and numerical simulations, we analyze the system's dynamics and heat statistics. We report the emergence of resonant position-velocity correlations and a non-Gaussian, asymmetric heat distribution consistent with the Fluctuation Theorem. We demonstrate that inertia is a key parameter, damping the system's response and slowing its relaxation to a periodic non-equilibrium steady state. Our results show that oscillatory thermal driving is a powerful tool for controlling nanoscale energy flow.

Title: Disorder-Induced Damping of Spin Excitations in Cr-Doped BaFe$_2$As$_2$
Authors: Marli R. Cantarino, Rafael M. P. Teixeira, R. Pakuszewski, Wagner R. da Silva Neto, Juliana G. de Abrantes, Mirian Garcia-Fernandez, P. G. Pagliuso, C. Adriano, Claude Monney, Thorsten Schmitt, Eric C. Andrade, Fernando A. Garcia
Abstract: Partial chemical substitution inevitably introduces disorder. In doped Hund's metals, such as the iron-based superconductors, effects like charge doping and chemical pressure are often considered dominant. Here, we investigate spin excitations in Ba(Fe$_{1-x}$Cr$_x$)$_2$As$_{2}$ (CrBFA) by high-resolution Resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) for samples with $x = 0, 0.035,$ and $ 0.085$. In CrBFA, Cr acts as a hole dopant, but also introduces localized spins that compete with Fe-derived magnetic excitations. We found that the Fe-derived magnetic excitations are softened primarily by damping, becoming overdamped for $x = 0.085$. At this doping level, complementary angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements (ARPES) show the absence of electronic structure reconstruction effects such as the nematic band splitting. We propose a localized spin model that explicitly incorporates substitutional disorder and Cr local moments, successfully reproducing our key observations. These results reveal a case where disorder dominates over charge doping in the case of a correlated Hund's metal.

Title: Follow the curvature of viscoelastic stress: Insights into the steady arrowhead structure
Authors: Pierre-Yves Goffin, Yves Dubief, Vincent E. Terrapon
Abstract: Focusing on simulated dilute polymer solutions, this letter investigates the interactions between flow structures and organized polymer stress sheets for the steady arrowhead coherent structure in a two-dimensional periodic channel flow. Formulating the problem in a frame of reference moving with the arrowhead velocity, streamlines, which are also pathlines in this frame, enables the identification of two distinct topological regions linked to two stagnation points. The streamlines help connecting the spatial distribution of polymer stress within the sheets and the dynamics of polymers transported by the flow. Using stresslines, lines parallel to the eigenvectors of polymer stress, a novel formulation of the viscoelastic stress term in the momentum transport equation proposes a more intuitive interpretation of the relation between the curvature of the stresslines, and the variation of stress along these lines, with the local flow topology. An approximation of this formulation is shown to explain the pressure jump observed in the arrowhead structure as a function of the local curvature of the polymer stress sheet.

Title: Strange diffusivity of incoherent metal in half-filled two-dimensional Hubbard model
Authors: Youngmin Eom, Igor S. Tupitsyn, Nikolay V. Prokof'ev, Boris Svistunov, Evgeny Kozik, Aaram J. Kim
Abstract: We study charge transport across the metal-insulator crossover in the half-filled two-dimensional Hubbard model, with particular emphasis on precision control. The dynamic current-current correlation function is obtained directly in the thermodynamic limit, and the optical conductivity is extracted using numerical analytic continuation. To achieve this, we develop a multiscale approach: the non-perturbative low-frequency behavior is computed using the unbiased diagrammatic Monte Carlo technique, while the high-frequency physics is captured via a self-consistent (semi-)analytic diagrammatic theory. We found that across a broad temperature range where the DC resistivity displays anomalous scaling, $\sim T^\alpha$ with $0<\alpha\lesssim 1$, the Nernst-Einstein relation implies the diffusion constant with the characteristic $\sim 1/\sqrt{T}$ "strange metal" behavior. It was also revealed that the insulating regime is entered through a peculiar non-Fermi liquid state-which we call a Pseudogap Metal-characterized by insulating charge compressibility coexisting with metallic transport. Diagrammatically, the high-temperature incoherent transport is captured by the dressed polarization bubble, whereas near the metal-insulator crossover, the effective interaction vertex between opposite-spin particles is responsible for transferring the Drude weight to a high-frequency continuum.

Title: Reexamining Machine Learning Models on Predicting Thermoelectric Properties
Authors: Chung T. Ma, S. Joseph Poon
Abstract: Thermoelectric materials can generate clean energy by transforming waste heat into electricity. The effectiveness of thermoelectric materials is measured by the dimensionless figure of merit, ZT. The quest for high ZT materials has drawn extensive research experimentally and theoretically. However, due to the vast material space, finding high ZT materials is time-consuming and costly. To improve the efficiency of discovering new thermoelectric materials, recent studies have employed machine learning with databases to search for high ZT candidates. In this work, we examine the effects of adding various physical concepts on the performance of machine learning models in predicting TE properties. The objective is to improve the model ability to capture the underlying physics in designing TE materials. These concepts include short range order and crystal structure class. Results show some improvements in accuracy. However, the current models do not distinguish between dilute alloys and concentrated alloys, rendering them inadequate in predicting doping effects. To better capture the electronic band structure effect from doping, we included various dopant properties as features. This increases the prediction accuracy in doped materials. Furthermore, we used a genetic algorithm to rank features for various thermoelectric properties to provide physical insight into key parameters in designing thermoelectric materials.

Title: Free-carrier screening unlocks high electron mobility in ultrawide bandgap semiconductor CaSnO$_3$
Authors: Jiayi Gong, Chuanyu Zhang, Wenjie Hu, Jin-Jian Zhou
Abstract: Alkaline earth stannates have emerged as promising transparent conducting oxides due to their wide band gaps and high room-temperature electron mobilities. Among them, CaSnO$_3$ possesses the widest band gap, yet reported mobilities vary widely and are highly sample-dependent, leaving its intrinsic limit unclear. Here, we present ab initio calculations of electron mobility in CaSnO$_3$ across a range of temperatures and doping levels, using state-of-the-art methods that explicitly account for free-carrier screening in electron-phonon interactions. We identify the dominant limiting mechanism to be the long-range longitudinal optical phonon scattering, which is significantly suppressed at high doping due to free-carrier screening, leading to enhanced phonon-limited mobility. While ionized impurity scattering emerges as a competing mechanism at carrier concentrations up to ~10$^{20}$ cm$^{-3}$, the phonon scattering reduction dominates, yielding a net mobility increase with predicted room-temperature values reaching about twice the highest experimental report. Our work highlights the substantial untapped conductivity in CaSnO$_3$, establishing it as a compelling ultrawide bandgap semiconductor for transparent and high-power electronic applications.

Title: Capturing the fractocohesive length scale through a gradient-enhanced damage model for elastomers
Authors: S. Mohammad Mousavi, Jason Mulderrig, Brandon Talamini, Nikolaos Bouklas
Abstract: This study aims to unravel the micro-mechanical underpinnings of the emergence of the fractocohesive length scale as a central concept in modern fracture mechanics. A thermodynamically consistent damage and fracture model for elastomers is developed, incorporating elements of polymer chain statistical mechanics. This approach enables the direct incorporation of polymer chain response into a continuum gradient enhanced damage formulation, that in turn allows a physically meaningful description of diffuse chain damage and corresponding fracture events. Through a series of numerical experiments, we simulate crack propagation and extract the fracture energy as an output of the model, while keeping track of the micromechanical signatures of diffuse chain damage that accommodate fracture propagation. Furthermore, we investigate flaw sensitivity and demonstrate that when flaw sizes are smaller than a critical length scale, the material response becomes largely insensitive to notch size. Finally, by combining the fracture toughness and the work to rupture, we identify a fractocohesive length of the material, corresponding to the full width of the damage zone and representing the region where the irreversible dissipation process (i.e., bond scission) is happening. As this region is dictated in the proposed FED model through the introduction of a length scale associated with the non-local nature of the damage and fracture process, the emerging relationship of the two length scales is discussed, effectively connecting the microscopic characteristics of damage to the effective macroscopic response.

Title: Landau-de Gennes Modelling of Confinement Effects and Cybotactic Clusters in Bent-Core Nematic Liquid Crystals
Authors: Yucen Han, Prabakaran Rajamanickam, Bedour Alturki, Apala Majumdar
Abstract: We study bent-core nematic (BCN) systems in two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) settings, focusing on the role of cybotactic clusters, phase transitions, confinement effects and applied external fields. We propose a generalised version of Madhusudhana's two-state model for BCNs in [Madhusudana NV, Physical Review E, 96(2), 022710] with two order parameters: $\mathbf{Q}_g$ to describe the ambient ground-state (GS) molecules and $\mathbf{Q}_c$ to describe the ordering within the cybotactic clusters. The equilibria are modelled by minimisers of an appropriately defined free energy, with an empirical coupling term between $\mathbf{Q}_g$ and $\mathbf{Q}_c$. We demonstrate two phase transitions in spatially homogeneous 3D BCN systems at fixed temperatures: a first-order nematic-paranematic transition followed by a paranematic-isotropic phase transition driven by the GS-cluster coupling. We also numerically compute and give heuristic insights into solution landscapes of confined BCN systems on 2D square domains, tailored by the GS-cluster coupling, temperature and external fields. This benchmark example illustrates the potential of this generalised model to capture tunable director profiles, cluster properties and macroscopic biaxiality.

Title: Dimensional hierarchy of topological bound states in the continuum
Authors: Shunda Yin, Zhenyu Wang, Liping Ye, Hailong He, Manzhu Ke, Weiyin Deng, Jiuyang Lu, Zhengyou Liu
Abstract: Bound states in the continuum (BICs), with the ability of trapping and manipulating waves within the radiation continuum, have gained significant attention for their potential applications in optics and acoustics. However, challenges arise in reducing wave leakage and noise from fabrication imperfections. The emergence of robust wave manipulations based on topological BICs (TBICs) offers promising solutions. Traditionally, TBICs of different dimensions are observed separately in distinct systems. Here, we report the experimental discovery of the coexistence of two-dimensional surface TBICs and one-dimensional hinge TBICs in a single three-dimensional phononic crystal system. Such an unprecedented dimensional hierarchy of TBICs is triggered by the mechanism of separability and protected by the valley Chern numbers. Notably, these TBICs inherit dispersive propagation characteristics from valley topology and can propagate robustly against defects without leakage. Our findings offer an efficient approach to multidimensional TBICs and can be applied in designing highly efficient acoustic devices for wave trapping and manipulation in multidimensional environments.

Title: Simulations of grain growth in tungsten armor materials under ARC plasma edge operation conditions using an integrated plasma-edge/materials model
Authors: Jinxin Yu, Nithin Mathew, Sophie Blondel, Ane Lasa, Jon Hillesheim, Lauren Garrison, Brian D. Wirth, Jaime Mariana
Abstract: An integrated model of grain growth deuterium-exposed tungsten polycrystals, consisting of a two-dimensional vertex dynamics model fitted to atomistic data, has been developed to assess the grain growth kinetics of deuterium-exposed polycrystalline tungsten (W). The model tracks the motion of grain boundaries under the effect of driving forces stemming from grain boundary curvature and differential deuterium concentration accumulation. We apply the model to experimentally-synthesized W polycrystals under deuterium saturated conditions consistent with those of the ARC concept design, and find fast grain growth kinetics in the material region adjacent to the plasma (at 1400 K, <100 seconds for full transformation), while the microstructure is stable deep inside the material (several days to complete at a temperature of 1000 K). Our simulations suggest that monolithic W fabricated using conventional techniques will be highly susceptible to grain growth in the presence of any driving force at temperatures above 1000 K.

Title: Hidden ferromagnetism of centrosymmetric antiferromagnets
Authors: I. V. Solovyev
Abstract: The time-reversal symmetry ($\mathcal{T}$) breaking is a signature of ferromagnetism, giving rise to such phenomena as the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) and orbital magnetism (OM). Nevertheless, $\mathcal{T}$ can be also broken in certain classes of antiferromagnets, such as weak ferromagnets or altermagnets, which remain invariant under the spatial inversion. In the light of this similarity with the ferromagnetism, it is tempting to ask whether such anomalous antiferromagnetic (AFM) state can be presented as a simplest ferromagnetic one, i.e. within a minimal unit cell containing only one magnetic cite. We show that such presentation is possible due to the special form of the spin-orbit (SO) interaction in an antiferroelectrically distorted lattice hosting this AFM state. The inversion symmetry, combined with the lattice translations, imposes a severe constraint on the form of the SO interaction, which becomes invariant under the symmetry operation $\{ \mathcal{S}| {\bf t} \}$, combining the $180^{\circ}$ rotation of spins ($\mathcal{S}$) with the lattice shift ${\bf t}$, connecting antiferromagnetically coupled sublattices. This is the fundamental symmetry property of centrosymmetric antiferromagnets, which justifies the use of the generalized Bloch theorem and transformation to the local coordinate frame with one magnetic cite per cell. It naturally explains the emergence of AHE and OM, and provides transparent expressions for these properties in terms of the electron hoppings and SO interaction operating between nearest neighbors as well as the orthorhombic strain of the next-nearest-neighbor hoppings. The idea is illustrated on a number of examples, using realistic models derived from first-principles calculations. These examples include two-dimensional square lattice, monoclinic VF$_4$ and CuF$_2$, and RuO$_2$-type materials with the tetragonal symmetry.

Title: Activity-driven sorting, approach to criticality and turbulent flows in dense persistent active fluids
Authors: Suman Dutta, Pinaki Chaudhuri, Madan Rao, Chandan Dasgupta
Abstract: We show that dense active fluids comprising interacting particles with persistent self-propulsion are driven to a non-equilibrium steady state consisting of co-moving particles with co-aligned active forces. This velocity and force sorting appears to be associated with a critical state where the length scales associated with spatial correlations of the velocity and the propulsive force grow with system size. At large system sizes, these growing velocity domains are accompanied by the appearance of dynamic macroscopic voids in the steady state, associated with large density fluctuations. The dynamics of the macroscopic voids drives a new kind of turbulent state.

Title: Role of lattice structure and breaking of antiferromagnetic spin order in enhancement of ferromagnetic, electronic, and magneto-electric properties in Fe$_{2-x}$Sc$_x$O$_3$ system
Authors: R. N. Bhowmik, Bipin Kumar Parida, Amit Kumar, P.D. Babu, S. M. Yusuf
Abstract: The strategy of breaking AFM ground state of alpha-Fe2O3 by doping non-magnetic Sc3+ (3d0) ions at the Fe3+ (3d5) sites has been used to understand modified lattice-structure, magnetic spin order, and charge-spin coupling in Fe$_{2-x}$Sc$_x$O$_3$  system ($x =$ 0.2, 0.5, 1.0). The material has been stabilized in single-phased (rhombohedral $\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$) or mix-phased (rhombohedral alpha-Fe$_2$O$_3$ and cubic Sc$_2$O$_3$-types) structures by varying the Sc content and heat treatment temperature. Neutron diffraction confirmed magnetic moment approximately 2.75-4.68 Bohr-magneton per Fe site and spin reorientation from in-plane to out of plane direction below the Morin transition approximately 260 K. The material showed magnetic coercivity (0.2 to 6 kOe). The electrical properties transformed from insulating state (conductivity 10-14-10-10 S/cm and polarization 0.5-2 micro-C/cm$^2$) to high conductive state (conductivity approximately 10-10 -10-7 S/cm and polarization greater than 2 micro-C/cm$^2$) above Morin transition. The material at 300 K produced the maximum current density 20-95 micro-A/cm$^2$, ferroelectric polarization 2.7-15.6 micro-C/cm$^2$, ME voltage up to 5 mV with coupling coefficient 0.53 mV/Oe/cm and huge negative magnetoconductance up to 90%. The results in the present hematite based canted ferromagnetic materials are expected to be useful for applying in low power spintronic devices.

Authors: Hongyu Yu, Junyi Ji, Wei Luo, Xingao Gong, Hongjun Xiang
Abstract: Emerging ferroic materials may pave a new way to next-generation nanoelectronic and spintronic devices due to their interesting physical properties. Here, we systematically review unconventional ferroelectric systems, from Hf-based and elementary ferroelectrics to stacking ferroelectricity, polar metallicity, fractional quantum ferroelectricity, wurtzite-type ferroelectricity, and freestanding membranes ferroelectricity. Moreover, multiferroic materials are reviewed, particularly the interplay between novel magnetic states and ferroelectricity, as well as ferrovalley-ferroelectric coupling. Finally, we conclude by discussing current challenges and future opportunities in this field.

Title: Stabilization of Ferroelectric Hafnia and Zirconia through Y2O3 doping
Authors: Li Yin, Cong Liu, R. E. Cohen
Abstract: We investigate the possible stabilization of ferroelectricity in bulk Y2O3-doped hafnia and zirconia. We use density functional theory (DFT) with large random supercells of hafnia and zirconia and study the relative phase stability of the centrosymmetric cubic and monoclinic phases compared with the polar orthorhombic phase. We find that Y2O3-doping stabilizes the polar ferroelectric phase over the monoclinic baddeleyite phase in both hafnia and zirconia.

Title: Extreme dynamics and relaxation of quantum gases: A hydrodynamic approach
Authors: Ritwik Mukherjee, Abhishek Dhar, Manas Kulkarni, Samriddhi Sankar Ray
Abstract: The evolution of quantum gases, released from traps, are studied through hydrodynamics, both analytically and numerically, in one and two dimensions. In particular, we demonstrate the existence of long time self-similar solutions of the Euler equations, for the density and velocity fields, and derive the scaling exponents as well as the scaling functions. We find that the expanding gas develops a shock front and the size of the cloud grows in time as a powerlaw. We relate the associated exponent to that appearing in the corresponding equation of state of the quantum gas. Furthermore, we study the relaxation dynamics of a trapped quantum gas and show that the resulting steady state is in excellent agreement with that derived analytically. Our hydrodynamic approach is versatile and can be used to unravel several other far-from-equilibrium collective phenomenon of extreme nature, relevant to the growing experimental interests in quantum gases.

Title: Discovery of nodal-line superconductivity in chiral crystals
Authors: Tian Shang, Jianzhou Zhao, Lun-Hui Hu, Weikang Wu, Keqi Xia, Mukkattu O. Ajeesh, Michael Nicklas, Yang Xu, Qingfeng Zhan, Dariusz J. Gawryluk, Ming Shi, Toni Shiroka
Abstract: Chiral crystals, whose key feature is the structural handedness, host exotic quantum phenomena driven by the interplay of band topology, spin-orbit coupling (SOC), and electronic correlations. Due to the limited availability of suitable chiral-crystal materials, their unconventional superconductivity (SC) remains largely unexplored. Here, we report the discovery of unconventional SC in the La(Rh,Ir)Si family of materials by combining muon-spin spectroscopy, band-structure calculations, and perturbation theory. This family, characterized by a double-helix chiral structure, hosts exotic multifold fermions that are absent in other topological chiral crystals. While LaRhSi behaves as a fully-gapped superconductor, the substitution of 4$d$-Rh by 5$d$-Ir significantly enhances the SOC and leads to the emergence of topological nodal-line SC in LaIrSi. The developed model shows that the nodal-line SC arises from an isotropic SOC with a specific strength. Such an exotic mechanism expands our conventional understanding of material candidates for unconventional SC, which typically rely on a significantly anisotropic SOC to promote the triplet pairing. Our work establishes a new type of phase diagram, which provides a comprehensive roadmap for identifying and engineering unconventional SC in chiral crystals. Furthermore, it calls for renewed investigations of unconventional SC in other widely studied superconductors with a chiral structure.

Title: From diamond to BC8 to simple cubic and back: kinetic pathways to post-diamond carbon phases from metadynamics
Authors: Roman Martoňák, Sergey Galitskiy, Azat Tipeev, Joseph M. Gonzalez, Ivan I. Oleynik
Abstract: The experimental observation of elusive post-diamond carbon phases at extreme pressures remains a major challenge in high-pressure science. Using metadynamics with coordination-number-based collective variables and SNAP machine-learned interatomic potential, we uncover atomistic mechanisms governing the transformation of cubic and hexagonal diamond into post-diamond phases above 1.5 TPa. The transition initiates via homogeneous nucleation of nanoscale liquid droplets, which rapidly crystallize into either BC8 (below 1.8 TPa) or simple cubic phases (above 2.1 TPa), once the liquid nucleus surpasses a critical size. Favorable conditions for synthesizing BC8 are identified near 1.8 TPa and 3500--5000 K. Decompression pathways from simple cubic and BC8 phases were also simulated to study possible experimental recovery of post-diamond carbon allotropes at ambient conditions. We also find a new metastable low-enthalpy structure with four-coordinated carbon atoms and space group P222. Our insights provide a theoretical foundation for experimental discovery of ultra-dense carbon phases under extreme conditions.

Title: Sliding-induced ferrovalley polarization and possible antiferromagnetic half-metal in bilayer altermagnets
Authors: Xin Zhang, Shihao Zhang
Abstract: Altermagnets, a newly discovered class of materials, exhibit zero net magnetization while hosting spin-split electronic bands. However, monolayer altermagnets maintain degenerate band gaps at the high-symmetry X and Y points in the Brillouin zone, manifesting a paravalley phase characterized by unpolarized valley states. In this work, we demonstrate that spontaneously broken valley degeneracy can be achieved through interlayer sliding in engineered M$_2$A$_2$B and M$_2$AA$'$B bilayer altermagnets by first-principles calculations and minimal microscopic model. We propose a promising route to achieve antiferromagnetic half-metal driven by sliding and emergent ferrovalley phase without applied electric field, which is realized in the V$_2$SSeO engineered bilayer. Our calculations also reveal that Mo$_2$O$_2$O exhibits the largest valley splitting gap of ~0.31 eV, making it a promising candidate for valley-spin valve devices. Furthermore, band structure calculations on Mo$_2$AA$'$O materials demonstrate that increasing the difference in atomic number ($\Delta$Z) between A and A$'$ site atoms effectively enhances valley polarization. This work establishes a novel platform for discovering and controlling ferrovalley states in altermagnetic systems.

Title: Probing the Nanoscale Excitonic Landscape and Quantum Confinement of Excitons in Gated Monolayer Semiconductors
Authors: Yueh-Chun Wu, Bogdan Dryzhakov, Huan Zhao, Ivan Vlassiouk, Kyle Kelley, Takashi Taniguchi, Kenji Watanabe, Jun Yan, Benjamin Lawrie
Abstract: Engineering and probing excitonic properties at the nanoscale remains a central challenge in quantum photonics and optoelectronics. While exciton confinement via electrical control and strain engineering has been demonstrated in 2D semiconductors, substantial nanoscale heterogeneity limits the scalability of 2D quantum photonic device architectures. In this work, we use cathodoluminescence spectroscopy to probe the excitonic landscape of monolayer $WS_2$ under electrostatic gating. Exploiting the high spatial resolution of the converged electron beam, we resolve a homojunction arising between gated and ungated regions. Moreover, we reveal an exciton confinement channel arising from an unconventional doping mechanism driven by the interplay between the electron beam and the applied gate fields. These findings offer new insights into the optoelectronic behavior of monolayer semiconductors under the combined influence of electron-beam excitation and electrostatic gating. Our approach provides a pathway for exciton manipulation at the nanoscale and opens opportunities for controlling quantum-confined exciton transport in two-dimensional materials.

Title: Energy non-equipartition in vibrofluidized particles
Authors: Alok Tiwari, Manaswita Bose, V. Kumaran
Abstract: The aim of the present work is to investigate the influence of the realistic model parameters on the equipartition of energy in a vibrofluidized system. To achieve this, a three-dimensional vertically vibrated granular system consisting of spherical particles is simulated using the discrete element method (DEM) using the open-source software LAMMPS. Interparticle and wall-particle interactions are determined using the linear-spring dashpot model. Simulations are performed for nearly perfectly smooth to nearly perfectly rough particles. Two different values for the ratio of the tangential to normal spring stiffness coefficient $\kappa$ ($2/7$ and $3/4$) are chosen. Non-equipartition of energy between the translational and rotational modes is observed for all realistic values in the parametric range.

Title: Shot noise as a probe for Andreev reflection in graphene-based heterojunctions
Authors: Shahrukh Salim, Poornima Shakya
Abstract: Shot noise emerges due to the discrete nature of charge transport and provides direct access to the underlying microscopic transport mechanisms governing current flow in mesoscopic conductors. In this work, we demonstrate that quantum shot noise offers a direct and robust fingerprint of Andreev reflection, distinguishing between retro and specular processes in graphene-superconductor, graphene-superconductor-graphene, and superconductor-graphene-superconductor junctions. At the graphene-superconductor interface, exact reflection amplitudes obtained from full wavefunction matching within the Bogoliubov-de Gennes formalism capture retro and specular regimes. The associated Fano factor exhibits distinct Fermi-level-dependent signatures, with retro Andreev reflection suppressing and specular Andreev reflection enhancing the shot noise. Extensions to graphene-superconductor-graphene and superconductor-graphene-superconductor configurations reveal how the transmission spectrum and, consequently, the noise profile are modified in the presence of multiple interfaces, coherent quasiparticle interference, and superconducting phase variations. Our findings establish shot noise spectroscopy as a potent and experimentally viable probe for differentiating Andreev reflection types in graphene-based quantum devices, providing complementary insights beyond conventional conductance measurements.

Title: Dynamically generated correlations in a trapped bosonic gas via frequency quenches
Authors: Nikhil Mesquita, Manas Kulkarni, Satya N. Majumdar, Sanjib Sabhapandit
Abstract: We study a system of $N$ noninteracting bosons in a harmonic trap subjected to repeated quantum quenches, where the trap frequency is switched from one value to another after a random time duration drawn from an exponential distribution. Each cycle contains two steps: (i) changing the trap frequency to enable unitary evolution under a Hamiltonian, and (ii) reapplying the original trap at stochastic times to cool the gas back to its initial state. This protocol effectively makes it an open quantum system and drives it into a unique nonequilibrium steady state (NESS). We analytically and numerically characterize the NESS, uncovering a conditionally independent and identically distributed (CIID) structure in the joint probability density function (JPDF) of the positions. The JPDF in the CIID structure is a product of Gaussians with a common random variance, which is then averaged with respect to its distribution, making the JPDF non-factorizable, giving rise to long-range emergent dynamical correlations. The average density profile of the gas shows significant deviations from the initial Gaussian shape. We further compute the order and the gap statistics, revealing universal scaling in both bulk and edge regimes. We also analyze the full counting statistics, exposing rich parameter-dependent structure. Our results demonstrate how stochastic quenches can generate nontrivial correlations in quantum many-body systems.

Title: Stochastic Two-temperature Nonequilibrium Ising model
Authors: Debraj Dutta, Ritwick Sarkar, Urna Basu
Abstract: We investigate the nonequilibrium stationary state (NESS) of the two-dimensional Ising model under a stochastic dichotomous modulation of temperature, which alternates between $T_c \pm \delta$ around the critical temperature $T_c$ at a rate $\gamma$. Both magnetization and energy exhibit non-monotonic dependence on $\gamma$, explained by a renewal approach in the slow-switching limit, while for small $\delta$ dynamical response theory quantitatively captures the $\gamma$-dependence of the observables. In the fast-switching regime, the NESS appears Boltzmann-like with a $\gamma$-dependent effective temperature. However, a finite energy current flowing through the system from hot to cold reservoir confirms the intrinsic nonequilibrium nature of the dynamics.

Title: "One defect, one potential" strategy for accurate machine learning prediction of defect phonons
Authors: Junjie Zhou, Xinpeng Li, Menglin Huang, Shiyou Chen
Abstract: Atomic vibrations play a critical role in phonon-assisted electron transitions at defects in solids. However, accurate phonon calculations in defect systems are often hindered by the high computational cost of large-supercell first-principles calculations. Recently, foundation models, such as universal machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs), emerge as a promising alternative for rapid phonon calculations, but the quantitatively low accuracy restricts its fundamental applicability for high-level defect phonon calculations, such as nonradiative carrier capture rates. In this paper, we propose a "one defect, one potential" strategy in which an MLIP is trained on a limited set of perturbed supercells. We demonstrate that this strategy yields phonons with accuracy comparable to density functional theory (DFT), regardless of the supercell size. The predicted accuracy of defect phonons is validated by phonon frequencies, Huang-Rhys factors, and phonon dispersions. Further calculations of photoluminescence (PL) spectra and nonradiative capture rates based on this defect-specific model also show good agreements with DFT results, meanwhile reducing the computational expenses by more than an order of magnitude. Our approach provides a practical pathway for studying defect phonons in 10$^4$-atom large supercell with high accuracy and efficiency.

Title: Magnetic dynamics in NiTiO3 honeycomb antiferromagnet using neutron scattering
Authors: Srimal Rathnayaka, Luke Daemen, Tao Hong, Songxue Chi, Stuart Calder, John A. Schneeloch, Yongqiang Cheng, Bing Li, Despina Louca
Abstract: The ilmenite NiTiO3 consists of a buckled honeycomb lattice, with the Ni spins aligned ferromagnetically in-plane and antiferromagnetically out-of-plane. Using neutron spectroscopy, the magnetic structure and the dynamics were investigated as a function of temperature. Dispersive acoustic bands and nearly dispersionless optical bands at ~3.7 meV are described by a highly anisotropy Heisenberg model with stronger antiferromagnetic (AFM) out-of-plane, weaker ferromagnetic (FM) in-plane interactions and an anisotropy gap of 0.95 meV. The order parameter yields a critical exponent between the Heisenberg and two-dimensional Ising models, consistent with highly anisotropic Heisenberg systems. The frustration parameter ~ 2 supports a weakly frustrated system.

Abstract: Cu2OSeO3 is a skyrmion host material in which two distinct thermodynamically stable skyrmion phases were identified. We report magnetic force microscopy imaging of the low-temperature magnetic phases in bulk Cu2OSeO3(100) single crystal. Tuning the external magnetic field over the various phase transition at a temperature of 10 K, we observe the formation of helical, conical, tilted conical and skyrmion lattice domains in real space.

Title: Theory of Emergent Trionic Order in One-Dimensional Bose-Fermi Mixtures
Authors: Yan-Guang Yue, Qi Song, Jie Lou, Yan Chen
Abstract: We study a one-dimensional (1D) lattice mixture of hard-core bosons and spinless fermions with attractive interspecies interaction and correlated fermion pair hopping. Using Schrieffer-Wolff (SW) transformation and bosonization, we derive an effective low-energy theory that reveals a density-induced resonance mechanism. When the filling ratio satisfies $\rho_{c0}:\rho_{b0} = 2:1$, a non-oscillatory cosine term emerges in the bosonized theory. This term favors the formation of trions, i.e., bound states of two fermions and one boson. By performing a renormalization-group (RG) analysis, we identify a phase transition from a gapless two-component Luttinger liquid to a partially gapped trionic phase, where trionic correlations exhibit dominant quasi-long-range order. Our findings provide a microscopic understanding of composite superfluidity and offer experimentally relevant signatures for Bose-Fermi mixtures in 1D lattices.

Title: Josephson Dynamics in 2D Ring-shaped Condensates
Authors: Koon Siang Gan, Vijay Pal Singh, Luigi Amico, Rainer Dumke
Abstract: We investigate Josephson transport in a fully closed, two-dimensional superfluid circuit formed by a ring-shaped 87Rb Bose-Einstein condensate that contains two optical barriers acting as movable weak links. Translating these barriers at controlled speeds imposes a steady bias current, enabling direct mapping of the current-chemical-potential (I-{\Delta}{\mu}) characteristics. For narrow junctions (w \approx 1{\mu}m) the circuit exhibits a pronounced dc branch that terminates at a critical current I_c = 9(1) x 10^3 s^{-1}; above this threshold the system switches to an ac, resistive regime. Classical-field simulations that include the moving barriers quantitatively reproduce both the nonlinear I-{\Delta}{\mu} curve and the measured I_c, validating the underlying microscopic picture. Analysis of the ensuing phase dynamics shows that dissipation is mediated by the nucleation and traversal of vortex-antivortex pairs through the junctions, while the bulk condensate remains globally phase-locked \textemdash direct evidence of the ring's topological constraint enforcing quantized circulation. These results establish a cold-atom analogue of a SQUID in which Josephson dynamics can be resolved at the single-vortex level, providing a versatile platform for atomtronic circuit elements, non-reciprocal Josephson devices, and on-chip Sagnac interferometers for multi-axis rotation sensing.

Title: Unveiling Insulating Ferro and Ferrimagnetism in Double-Double Perovskite Oxides
Authors: Monirul Shaikh, Fengyi Zhou, Sathiyamoorthy Buvaneswaran, Rajan Gowsalya, Trilochan Sahoo, Duo Wang, Saurabh Ghosh
Abstract: The emergence of ferro- and ferrimagnetic behavior in insulating materials is uncommon, largely due to Hund's rules. Utilizing symmetry analysis, first-principles methods, and classical Monte Carlo simulations, \textcolor{black}{we report technologically important insulating ferro and ferrimagnetic double-double perovskite oxides. Our study predicts LaA$^{\prime}$MnNiO$_6$ (A$^{\prime}$ = V, Cr, Mn, Co, and Ni) as promising candidates for spintronic and optical applications exhibiting band gaps between 1.3 eV and 1.9 eV. We explain the mechanisms driving band gap openings and magnetic exchange interactions in these ferro and ferrimagnetic compounds. Monte Carlo simulations, together with state-of-the-art orbital-decomposed exchange parameter analysis, reveal intriguing variations in magnetic transition temperatures (up to 242 K) and the corresponding exchange mechanisms in all LaA$^{\prime}$MnNiO$_6$ compounds.} In addition, we assess the thermodynamic and dynamic stability of these compounds to comment on the feasibility of these systems.

Title: Radio-Frequency Method for Detecting Superconductivity Under High Pressure
Authors: Dmitrii V. Semenok, Di Zhou, Jianbo Zhang, Toni Helm, Yang Ding, Ho-kwang Mao, Viktor V. Struzhkin
Abstract: We introduce a contactless technique for probing superconductivity, metal-insulator transitions, and magnetic ordering in micron-sized samples under extreme pressure. Utilizing a multistage Lenz lens system, directly sputtered onto diamond anvils, we realize a radio-frequency (RF, 50 kHz - 200 MHz) transformer with a sample, of 50-100 microns in diameter, as its core. This configuration enables efficient transfer and focusing of an electromagnetic field within the diamond anvil cell's chamber. Consequently, the transmitted RF signal exhibits high sensitivity to variations in the sample's surface conductivity and magnetic permeability. We validate this method by determining the critical temperatures ($T_{\text{c}}$) of known superconductors, including NbTi, MgB$_2$, Hg-1223, BSCCO, and REBCO in various magnetic fields, as well as the magnetic ordering temperatures of Gd and Tb, and the metal-insulator transition in VO$_2$. Notably, we apply this technique to the (La,Ce)H$_{10-12}$ superhydride at a pressure of about 150 GPa. The observed superconducting transition, at 215-220 K, is noticeably higher than the $T_{\text{c}}$ determined via traditional electrical-resistance measurements (200-205 K), demonstrating the method's enhanced sensitivity. Moreover, we show how multiple repetitions of the RF experiment with the La-Ce superhydride make it possible to detect the increase in $T_{\text{c}}$ over time up to 260-270 K. This finding opens a pathway towards reaching a critical $T_{\text{c}}$ above 0$^\circ$C in the La-based superhydrides.

Title: Sub-GHz Breathing Dynamics of Magnetic Hopfions
Authors: Felipe Tejo, Rubén M. Otxoa
Abstract: Magnetic hopfions are three-dimensional topological solitons whose static stability has recently been confirmed in experiments, yet their dynamical modes remain largely unexplored. Here we combine micromagnetic simulations and analytical modelling to characterise the fundamental breathing excitation of hopfions. We show that the breathing mode corresponds to a coherent oscillation of both the hopfion core diameter and the shell width, while preserving the topological charge. An analytical domain-wall interaction model explains the weak field dependence of the shell thickness and yields a closed-form expression for the restoring stiffness. From this curvature and the collective-coordinate inertia, we derive an estimated breathing frequency in excellent agreement with micromagnetic spectra. The ability to capture the hopfion dynamics quantitatively from material constants highlights a direct route to experimental detection by ferromagnetic resonance or Brillouin light scattering, and establishes a framework for frequency-encoded control in reconfigurable spintronic devices.

Title: Topology of Fermi seas and geometry of their boundaries for free particles in one and two-dimensional lattices
Authors: Guillermo R. Zemba
Abstract: Free gases of spinless fermions moving on a geometric background with lattice symmetries are considered. Their Fermi seas and corresponding boundaries may be classified according to their topological properties at zero temperature. This is accomplished by considering the flat orbifolds $R^{d}/\Gamma$, with $\Gamma$ being the crystallographic group of symmetry in $d$-dimensional momentum space. For $d=1$, there are 2 topological classes: a circumference, corresponding to an insulator and an interval, identified as a conductor. For $d=2$, the number of topological classes extends to 17: there are 8 with the topology of a disk identified as conductors and 4 corresponding to a 2-sphere matching insulators, both sets eventually including finite numbers of conical singularities and reflection corners at the boundaries. The rest of the listing includes single cases corresponding to insulators (2-torus, real projective plane, Klein bottle) and conductors (annulus, Möbius strip). Physical interpretations of the singularities are provided, as well as examples that fit within this listing. Given the topological nature of this classification, its results are expected to be robust against small perturbative interactions.

Clark (1), Cory Pecinovsky (2), Matthew A. Glaser (1) ((1) Department of Physics, University of Colorado Boulder, CO, USA (2) Polaris Electro-Optics, Inc., Broomfield, CO, USA)
Abstract: Electronic electro-optic (EEO) phase modulation is a key emerging technology for the chip-scale inter-conversion of signals between the electronic and photonic domains. The recent discovery of the ferroelectric nematic ($N_F$) liquid crystal phase, a three dimensional fluid of rod-shaped organic molecules having near-perfect equilibrium polar molecular orientational order, offers attractive opportunities for the creation of second-order nonlinear optical materials for EEO. Here we propose and realize a design motif for NF EEO molecules in which few-nanometer-long molecular rods are functionalized both for electro-static end-to-end association, facilitating NF phase formation, and for chromophoric optical nonlinearity, enabling high EEO efficiency, a combination enabling an active second-order nonlinear EEO medium that is 100% chromophoric.

Title: Surface Effects on the Magnetocrystalline Anisotropy of IrMn$_3$
Authors: Robert A. Lawrence, Matt I.J. Probert
Abstract: Magnetic anisotropy is a key parameter to describe the exchange bias effect in heterostructures. In this paper, we describe explicit density functional calculations of the magnetic structure of an interface between the industrially critically antiferromagnetic material, IrMn, and Fe, which together form a simple ferromagnet-antiferromagnet heterostructure. Additionally, the magnetic anisotropy was evaluated for several terminations of the IrMn. It was found that the [111] surface had a perpendicular anisotropy of 1.62 meV/$\textÅ^2$, whereas the two possible [100] surfaces (Ir-rich and Mn-rich) had in-plane anisotropies of 0.13 meV/$\textÅ^2$ and 1.39 meV/$\textÅ^2$ respectively. The affect of the magnetic order of the easy and hard configurations were calculated and used to explain the relative values of the anisotropies.

Title: Electronic frictional effects near metal surfaces with strong correlations
Authors: Yunhao Liu, Wenjie Dou
Abstract: The electronic friction-Langevin dynamics (EF-LD) offers a simplified framework for describing nonadiabatic effects at metal surfaces, particularly in electrochemical and molecular electronic applications. We investigate the electronic friction behavior for the Hubbard-Holstein model using density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) theory. We show that electron-electron interactions lead to the formation of two energy levels in the impurity, resulting in two peaks in the electronic friction at the resonances of electron attachment or detachment with the metal's Fermi level. We further benchmark our results against mean field theory (MFT) and exact diagonalization (ED). The results calculated by ED and DMRG show strong agreement at high temperatures, suggesting the results from DMRG are reliable; however, at low temperatures, ED exhibits significant deviations relative to DMRG due to the finite-size limitations inherent in ED calculations. MFT completely fails to recover Fermi resonance in electronic friction. Moreover, we investigate the dynamics of the electronic friction using EF-LD. Simulations reveal differences between the electronic population and kinetic energy dynamics predicted by MFT and DMRG approaches, suggesting that MFT approach is unreliable for nonadiabatic dynamics of strongly correlated systems.

Title: Parametrically Driven Superradiance of an Interacting Tavis-Cummings Model
Authors: Wen-Jie Geng, Yiwen Han, Wei Yi
Abstract: We consider the superradiant transition of a generalized Tavis-Cummings model, where a number of two-level qubits are coupled to a dissipative cavity. The cavity is coherently driven through a parametric medium, and all-to-all interactions between the qubits are introduced. While the nonlinear gain from the parametric drive breaks the U(1) symmetry of the standard Tavis-Cummings model, thus giving rise to superradiance with squeezed cavity fields, we show that the interactions impact the collective excitations and significantly modify the superradiant transition. Insights to the superradiant phase transitions, as well as the interaction effects, are obtained through effective models involving only a handful of low-lying collective states, under which the steady-state phase diagram of the hybrid system is faithfully reproduced. Our study is relevant to Rydberg-atom arrays coupled to a parametrically driven cavity, where the long-range interactions derive from the dipole-dipole interatomic interactions.

Title: Domain-Wall Mediated Polarization Switching in Ferroelectric AlScN: Strain Relief and Field-Dependent Dynamics
Authors: Xiangyu Zheng, Charles Paillard, Dawei Wang, Peng Chen, Hong Jian Zhao, Yu Xie, Laurent Bellaiche
Abstract: Aluminum nitride is a traditional wide-bandgap semiconductor that has been widely used in high-power electronic and optoelectronic devices. Recently, scandium-doped aluminum nitride (AlScN) was shown to host ferroelectricity with high remnant polarization and excellent thermal stability. However, its practical use is currently limited by its high coercive field, $E_c$. Understanding the atomic-scale switching mechanism is essential to guide strategies for reducing $E_c$. Here, we combine density functional theory and machine-learning molecular dynamics to investigate polarization switching mechanisms in AlScN over various Sc concentrations and applied electric fields. We find that collective switching induces excessive lattice strain and is therefore unlikely to occur. Rather, pre-existing domain walls relieve strain and lead to a distinct switching dynamics, with the associated switching mechanism being field dependent. More precisely, at low electric fields, switching proceeds via gradual domain-wall propagation, well described by the Kolmogorov-Avram-Ishibashi model; meanwhile high fields trigger additional nucleation events, producing rapid and more homogeneous reversal, whose mixed switching process is better described by the simultaneous non-linear nucleation and growth model. These findings highlight the critical role of domain-wall dynamics in nitride ferroelectrics and suggest that domain engineering provides a viable route to control coercive fields and enhance device performance.

Title: Edge states, pairing, and sorting of motile chiral particles
Authors: Raushan Kant, Ananyo Maitra, A K Sood, Sriram Ramaswamy
Abstract: We present experiments on chiral active polar particles, realized as vibrated granular rods, revealing the formation of robust ``skipping orbits'' at hard boundaries. These edge states exhibit a net circulation opposite to the particles' intrinsic rotation and lead to a pronounced accumulation at the boundary, stronger than for their achiral counterparts. The directed nature of these orbits provides a simple yet high-fidelity mechanism for chiral sorting -- even for solitary particles, unlike in T Barois et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 125 , 238003 (2020). We propose a unified theoretical framework for boundary interactions of both chiral and achiral particles. In this model, an effective outward radial force, proportional to motility and chirality, explains the observed boundary-hugging. Our theory predicts, and our experiments confirm, a transition in the pairing of two particles of the same chirality, from apolar spinners to polar circle walkers, with increasing packing fraction of an ambient medium of beads.

Title: Self-Organising Memristive Networks as Physical Learning Systems
Authors: Francesco Caravelli, Gianluca Milano, Adam Z. Stieg, Carlo Ricciardi, Simon Anthony Brown, Zdenka Kuncic
Abstract: Learning with physical systems is an emerging paradigm that seeks to harness the intrinsic nonlinear dynamics of physical substrates for learning. The impetus for a paradigm shift in how hardware is used for computational intelligence stems largely from the unsustainability of artificial neural network software implemented on conventional transistor-based hardware. This Perspective highlights one promising approach using physical networks comprised of resistive memory nanoscale components with dynamically reconfigurable, self-organising electrical circuitry. Experimental advances have revealed the non-trivial interactions within these Self-Organising Memristive Networks (SOMNs), offering insights into their collective nonlinear and adaptive dynamics, and how these properties can be harnessed for learning using different hardware implementations. Theoretical approaches, including mean-field theory, graph theory, and concepts from disordered systems, reveal deeper insights into the dynamics of SOMNs, especially during transitions between different conductance states where criticality and other dynamical phase transitions emerge in both experiments and models. Furthermore, parallels between adaptive dynamics in SOMNs and plasticity in biological neuronal networks suggest the potential for realising energy-efficient, brain-like continual learning. SOMNs thus offer a promising route toward embedded edge intelligence, unlocking real-time decision-making for autonomous systems, dynamic sensing, and personalised healthcare, by enabling embedded learning in resource-constrained environments. The overarching aim of this Perspective is to show how the convergence of nanotechnology, statistical physics, complex systems, and self-organising principles offers a unique opportunity to advance a new generation of physical intelligence technologies.

Authors: Xixiang Zhang, Xinmei Yu, Liang Ma, Yanfeng Ge, Yong Liu, Wenhui Wan
Abstract: Although two-dimensional (2D) oxide semiconductors exhibit remarkable oxidation resistance compared to conventional 2D materials, the microscopic physical processes that govern this behavior at the atomic scale remains elusive. Using first-principles calculations, we investigated the defect formation and oxidation dynamics of the GeO${_2}$ monolayer (ML). The investigations reveal that the intrinsic GeO${_2}$ ML is resistant to oxidation due to strong electrostatic repulsion between surface oxygen ions and approaching O$_2$ molecules, effectively suppressing chemisorption. In contrast, defective GeO$_2$ ML with surface O vacancies shows vulnerability to oxidation with the O$_2$ molecule occupying the vacancy through a low-energy activation energy ($E_a$) of 0.375 eV. Remarkably, the subsequent O$_2$ dissociation into atomic species faces a higher activation barrier ($E_a$ = 1.604 eV), suggesting self-limiting oxidation behavior. Electronic structure analysis demonstrates that oxidation primarily modifies the valence bands of defective GeO${_2}$ MLs through oxygen incorporation, while the conduction bands and electron effective mass recover to pristine-like characteristics. We further proved that the high O$_2$ pressure hinders the formation of the O vacancy, while high temperature increases the oxidation rate in GeO$_2$ ML. These atomic-level insights not only advance our understanding of oxidation resistance in 2D oxides but also provide guidelines for developing stable GeO${_2}$-based nanoelectronic devices.

Title: Integration of promising piezoelectric and photocatalytic properties in Janus In$XY$ ($X$ = S, Se, Te; $Y$ = Cl, Br, I) monolayers and their heterojunctions
Authors: Xinyue Liu, Ziqiang Li, Yanfeng Ge, Yong Liu, Xing Wang, Wenhui Wan
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) Janus materials show great promise as piezoelectric materials and photocatalysts for water splitting. In this work, we systematically investigated the piezoelectric and photocatalytic properties of the hexagonal Janus InXY (X = S, Se, Te; Y = Cl, Br, I) monolayers (MLs) using first-principles calculations. Except for InSeCl ML, the remaining eight InXY MLs are stable and exhibit exceptionally high in-plane piezoelectric coefficients ($|d_{22}| = $6.07--155.27 pm/V), which exceed those of most known 2D materials. InXY MLs possess band edges straddling the water redox potentials at pH = 0. Their intrinsic vertical polarization induces an intralayer polarization field $E_{\rm intra}$, leading to low exciton binding energies (0.44--0.78 eV). Moreover, their strong vertical piezoelectric responses ($|d_{32}|$ = 0.34--0.65 pm/V) suggest that in-plane stress can further enhance $E_{\rm intra}$ to facilitate the separation of photogenerated carriers. Additionally, these InXY MLs exhibit high electron mobility (101--899 cm$^2$/V/s) and a pronounced anisotropy ratio in carrier mobility, which effectively suppresses charge recombination. To optimize performance, we constructed a van der Waals heterojunction (InSI/InSeBr), which demonstrates remarkable photocatalytic properties, including enhanced redox ability, a direct Z-scheme charge transfer pathway, strong visible-light absorption, high carrier mobility, and excellent photocorrosion resistance. Our results indicate that hexagonal Janus InXY MLs and their heterojunctions are multifunctional materials integrating piezoelectricity and photocatalysis, paving the way for energy conversion applications.

Abstract: Van der Waals heterostructures (vdWHs) composed of transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and layered magnetic semiconductors offer great opportunities to manipulate exciton and valley properties of TMDs. Here, we present magneto-photoluminescence (PL) studies in a WSe2 monolayer (ML) on a CrSBr crystal, an anisotropic layered antiferromagnetic semiconductor. Our results reveal unique behavior of each of the ML-WSe2 PL peaks under magnetic field that is distinct from the pristine case. An intriguing feature is the clear enhancement of the PL intensity that we observe each time the external magnetic field tunes the energy of an exciton in CrSBr into resonance with one of the optical states of WSe2. This result suggests a magnetic field-controlled resonant energy transfer (RET) beyond other effects reported in similar structures. Our work provides deep insight on the importance of different mechanisms into magnetic vdWHs and underscores its great potential for light harvesting and emission enhancement of two-dimensional materials.

Title: Topological switching in bilayer magnons via electrical control
Authors: Xueqing Wan, Quanchao Du, Jinlian Lu, Zhenlong Zhang, Jinyang Ni, Lei Zhang, Zhijun Jiang, Laurent Bellaiche
Abstract: Topological magnons, quantized spin waves featuring nontrivial boundary modes, present a promising route toward lossless information processing. Realizing practical devices typically requires magnons excited in a controlled manner to enable precise manipulation of their topological phases and transport behaviors. However, their inherent charge neutrality and a high frequency nature pose a significant challenge for nonvolatile control, especially via electric means. Herein, we propose a general strategy for electrical control of topological magnons in bilayer ferromagnetic insulators. With strong spin-layer coupling, an applied vertical electric field induces an interlayer potential imbalance that modifies intralayer Heisenberg exchanges between adjacent layers. This electric-field-driven modulation competes with the bilayer's intrinsic Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, enabling the accurate tuning of the band topology and nonreciprocal dynamics of magnons. More importantly, such an electric control mechanism exhibits strong coupling with external magnetic fields, unveiling new perspectives on magnetoelectric coupling in charge-neutral quasiparticles

Title: Infinite-temperature quantum phases and phase transitions
Authors: Tengzhou Zhang, Zhizhen Chen, Zi Cai
Abstract: In this study, we reveal nontrivial quantum physics in an infinite-temperature system. By performing an unbiased quantum Monte Carlo simulation, we study a hybrid model composed of hard-core bosons, whose hopping amplitude is mediated by the density of another type of soft-core bond bosons that can absorb entropy indefinitely. It is shown that the Bose-Einstein condensate can persist in three dimensions even when the temperature approaches the infinite-temperature limit. In contrast, in two dimensions, the quasi-superfluid is depleted by the fluctuations of the bond bosons, which, on the other hand, enhance the conductivity of the hard-core bosons in the normal phase. A generalization to the fermionic model has also been discussed.

Title: Dissipation in passive non-reciprocal microwave devices
Authors: Stefano Bosco
Abstract: Non-reciprocal devices are key components in both classical and quantum electronics. One approach to realizing passive non-reciprocal microwave devices is through capacitive coupling between external electrodes and materials exhibiting non-reciprocal conductance. In this work, we develop an analytic framework that captures the response of such devices in the presence of dissipation while accounting for the full AC dynamics of the material. Our results yield an effective circuit model that accurately describes the device response in experimentally relevant regimes even at small dissipation levels. Furthermore, our analysis reveals counterpropagating features arising from the intrinsic AC response of the material that could be exploited to dynamically switch the non-reciprocity of the device, opening pathways for tunable non-reciprocal microwave technologies.

Title: Observation of moiré trapped biexciton through sub-diffraction-limit probing using hetero-bilayer on nanopillar
Authors: Mayank Chhaperwal, Suman Chatterjee, Suchithra Puliyassery, Jyothsna Konkada Manattayil, Rabindra Biswas, Patrick Hays, Seth Ariel Tongay, Varun Raghunathan, Kausik Majumdar
Abstract: The ability to tune the degree of interaction among particles at the nanoscale is highly intriguing. The spectroscopic signature of such interaction is often subtle and requires special probes to observe. To this end, inter-layer excitons trapped in the periodic potential wells of a moiré superlattice offer rich interaction physics, specifically due to the presence of both attractive and repulsive components in the interaction. Here we show that the Coulomb force between two inter-layer excitons switches from repulsive to attractive when the length scale reduces from inter-moiré-pocket to intra-moiré-pocket in a WS$_2$/WSe$_2$ hetero-bilayer - thanks to the complex competition between direct and exchange interaction. The finding is a departure from the usual notion of repelling inter-layer excitons due to layer polarization. This manifests as the simultaneous observation of an anomalous superlinear power-law of moiré exciton and a stabilization of moiré trapped biexciton. The experimental observation is facilitated by placing the hetero-bilayer on a polymer-nanopillar/gold-film stack which significantly reduces the inhomogeneous spectral broadening by selectively probing a smaller ensemble of moiré pockets compared with a flat sample. This creates an interesting platform to explore interaction among moiré trapped excitons and higher order quasiparticles.

Title: Möbius-topological auxiliary function for $f$ electrons
Authors: Biaoyan Hu
Abstract: $f$-electron systems exhibit a subtle interplay between strong spin--orbit coupling and crystal-field effects, producing complex energy landscapes that are somewhat cumbersome to compute. We introduce auxiliary functions, constructed by extending hydrogen-like wave functions through a modification of the Legendre function. These functions often possess a Möbius-like topology, satisfying $\psi(\varphi) = -\psi(\varphi + 2\pi)$, while their squared modulus respects inversion symmetry. By aligning $|\psi|^2$ with the symmetry of the crystal field, they allow rapid determination of eigenstate structures without the need for elaborate calculations. The agreement with established results indicates that these functions capture the essential physics while offering considerable computational simplification.

Title: Quantum action of the Josephson dynamics
Authors: Cesare Vianello, Sofia Salvatore, Luca Salasnich
Abstract: We study the beyond-mean-field Josephson dynamics of the relative phase between two coupled macroscopic quantum systems. Using a covariant background field method, we derive the one-loop only-phase quantum effective action and the corresponding equation of motion for the quantum average of the phase. These analytical results are benchmarked against the exact quantum dynamics of the two-site Bose-Hubbard model, demonstrating a relevant improvement over the standard mean-field predictions across a wide range of interaction strengths.

Title: Role of correlations in Ruddlesden-Popper bilayer nickelates under compressive strain
Authors: Logan Bleys, Nicholas Corkill, Yi-Feng Zhao, Gheorghe Lucian Pascut, Harrison LaBollita, Antia S. Botana, Khandker F. Quader
Abstract: The recent discovery of superconductivity in thin films of the bilayer Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ (La327) under compressive strain has generated enormous interest, opening up further opportunities to stabilize superconductivity in this class of materials at ambient pressure. To better understand the many-body normal state from which superconductivity arises, it is important to ascertain the nature and role of correlations in its electronic structure. To provide insights into this question, we use a fully charge self-consistent DFT+e-DMFT (eDMFT) approach to study La327 at several compressive strain levels. At the strain level where superconductivity has been observed experimentally (-2\%), in contrast with DFT and DFT+$U$ results, the so-called $\gamma$ pocket emerges and the associated band, of mostly $d_{z^2}$ character, crosses the Fermi level exhibiting `flat band''-like features when dynamical correlations are included. Larger strain levels suppress the $\gamma$ pocket, which may have implications for superconductivity or its pairing symmetry.

Title: Superconducting Diode Effect in Gradiently Strained Nb0.5Ti0.5N Films
Authors: Zherui Yang, Shengyao Li, Shaoqin Peng, Xueyan Wang, Liang Wu, Ri He, Zhen Wang, Yanwei Cao, Xiao Renshaw Wang
Abstract: The superconducting diode effect (SDE), combining superconductivity with diode-like nonreciprocal current flow, recently emerges as an ideal candidate for zero-dissipation electronic circuits. Such technologically advantageous diodes are achieved by intricate material engineering to disrupt inversion symmetry, which leads to the production challenges as well as a limited pool of viable materials. Here we exploit the gradient interfacial strain to experimentally induce the SDE in Nb0.5Ti0.5N (NTN) films grown on MgO substrates. Additionally, the SDE is tunable with an in-plane magnetic field and can be further enhanced by introducing an interfacial anisotropic pinning potential. Our findings establish interfacial strain gradient as a versatile tool for creating and enhancing tunable SDE.

Title: Protocol for Clustering 4DSTEM Data for Phase Differentiation in Glasses
Authors: Mridul Kumar, Yevgeny Rakita
Abstract: Phase-change materials (PCMs) such as Ge-Sb-Te alloys are widely used in non-volatile memory applications due to their rapid and reversible switching between amorphous and crystalline states. However, their functional properties are strongly governed by nanoscale variations in composition and structure, which are challenging to resolve using conventional techniques. Here, we apply unsupervised machine learning to 4-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) data to identify compositional and structural heterogeneity in Ge-Sb-Te. After preprocessing and dimensionality reduction with principal component analysis (PCA), cluster validation was performed with t-SNE and UMAP, followed by k-means clustering optimized through silhouette scoring. Four distinct clusters were identified which were mapped back to the diffraction data. Elemental intensity histograms revealed chemical signatures change across clusters, oxygen and germanium enrichment in Cluster 1, tellurium in Cluster 2, antimony in Cluster 3, and germanium again in Cluster 4. Furthermore, averaged diffraction patterns from these clusters confirmed structural variations. Together, these findings demonstrate that clustering analysis can provide a powerful framework for correlating local chemical and structural features in PCMs, offering deeper insights into their intrinsic heterogeneity.

Title: Transitioning from Silicon to Carbon Nanotube based transistors
Authors: Suhas Bharadwaj, Reuben Thomas Thovelil, Rohith Chembattammal, Sradha Mishra, Sunit Sahoo, Himnish Dave, Karthik S., Kabir Jaisinghani
Abstract: Carbon Nanotubes have shown to be an attractive option in the race to find a replacement to silicon-based transistors, due to its high electrical conductivity, extraordinary mechanical strength, and thermal conductivity. However, challenges with regards to controlling the purity and chirality of CNTs have raised doubts if the mass production of these transistors are even viable. This paper explores the challenges of scalability and proposes methods such as Liquid and Gas phase oxidative methods and microwave heating to tackle the problem of metal impurities found within CNTs and the methods of Catalyst Engineering and Chemical Vapor Deposition to control the chirality of CNTs. It also suggests techniques such as Lithography, Screen Printing and Stack Engineering to facilitate the large-scale production of CNT transistors. This paper also attempts to explore the methods of Laser Ablation and Arc Discharge that allows for the synthesis of CNTs of pure quality and high yield further facilitating the rise of mass production of CNT transistors. The feasibility and challenges relating to the integration of CNT transistors with already pre-existing circuitry was also investigated and the methods of annealing and potassium doping were studied and analyzed. The main aim of this paper is providing a comprehensive guide to allow for the mass production and rapid integration of CNT transistors into the semi-conductor market.

Title: Performance Improvement of Deorbitalized Exchange-Correlation Functionals
Authors: H. Francisco, B. Thapa, S.B. Trickey, A.C. Cancio
Abstract: Deorbitalization of a conventional meta-generalized-gradient exchange-correlation approximation replaces its dependence upon the Kohn-Sham kinetic energy density with a dependence on the density gradient and Laplacian. In principle, that simplification should provide improved computational performance relative to the original meta-GGA form because of the shift from an orbital-dependent generalized Kohn-Sham potential to a true KS local potential. Often that prospective gain is lost because of problematic roughness in the density caused by the density Laplacian and consequent roughness in the exchange-correlation potential from the resulting higher-order spatial derivatives of the density in it. We address the problem by constructing a deorbitalizer based on the RPP deorbitalizer [Phys. Rev. Mater. 6, 083803 (2022)] with comparative smoothness of the potential along with retention of constraint satisfaction as design goals. Applied to the r^2SCAN exchange-correlation functional [J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 11, 8208 (2020)], we find substantial timing improvements for solid-state calculations over both r^2SCAN and its earlier deorbitalization for high precision calculations of structural properties, while improving upon the accuracy of RPP deorbitalization for both solids and molecules.

Title: Common errors in BoltzTraP-based calculations
Authors: Øven A. Grimenes, Kristian Berland
Abstract: Boltzmann transport calculations based on band structures computed from first principles play an important role in modern thermoelectric materials research. Among available codes, the \textsc{BoltzTraP} code is the most widely adopted, but many recent studies contain systematic mistakes. We identify three error modes: (1) inserting the electronic thermal conductivity at zero electric field, $\kappa_0$, in place of the electronic thermal conductivity at zero electric current, $\kappa_e$, (2) computing the figure of merit $zT$ by combining a constant relaxation time of unity while keeping the lattice thermal conductivity $\kappa_\ell$ in standard units, and (3) doing both errors at once. We have found many examples of the third error, but since the first two are simpler, we suspect they are also present in the literature. For the single parabolic band model, we derive exact analytical limits in the non-degenerate and near-degenerate regimes, and we show how mistakes appear for the realistic case study of ZrNiSn. Our results illustrate how faulty calculations can appear reasonable at certain temperatures and Fermi levels, and we provide practical guidance for identifying faulty results and avoiding such pitfalls in thermoelectric transport studies.

Title: Calculations of current in the cotunneling regime using Lindblad equations
Authors: Kian Maleki, Michael E. Flatté
Abstract: Transport through zero-dimensional states in a tunneling barrier can occur via co-tunneling, wherein a carrier occupying a state outside the range of energies between the chemical potentials of the two leads hops to a lead, and within the brief time permitted by the energy-time uncertainty relationship the occupancy is replenished from the other lead. Here, we calculate the current in such junctions using a Lindblad formalism within the Markovian approximation. We consider transport in the Coulomb blockade regime with spin-polarized leads and a magnetic field smaller than the coercive field of either lead. Dependences on magnetic field and lead spin polarization of the spin blockade, decoherence, and spin lifetime of the subsystems of this model are calculated.

Title: Emergent Rotational Order and Re-entrant Global Order of Vicsek Agents in a Complex Noise Environment
Authors: Mohd Yasir Khan
Abstract: Noisy pursuit in complex environments drives emergent collective behaviors in active matter systems. A compelling platform to study the impact of environment cues is provided by the standard Vicsek model for studying flocking and swarming phenomena. In this study, we explore the collective dynamics of Vicsek agents in a complex noise environment, featuring a noiseless circular region ($\eta_{\text{c}} = 0.0$) surrounded by a noisy outer region ($\eta_{\text{b}} = 1.0$, tunable), with a mutually repelling interactions. By varying the outer noise intensity, we observe an emergent rotational order ($\phi_r$) that peaks at higher noise levels ($\eta_{\text{b}}\sim 1$), as revealed by phase and susceptibility plots. Global order follows ($\phi$) follows a `U' shaped curve, $\phi \sim 0.965$ at $\eta_b=0$, dies down to $\phi \sim 0.57$ at $\eta_b=0.9$ and re-enters at $\eta_b > 1$ and peaks $\phi \sim 0.960$ at $\eta_b=1.5$. The latter rise attributing to $\phi_r$ increase. Higher particle velocities enhance escape rates ($\kappa$) from the circular region, with slower-moving agents exhibiting greater virtual confinement. We quantify escape dynamics through time-averaged and first-passage escape rates, demonstrating velocity-dependent retention on the probability of finding the bi-motility agent flocks at a give time resulting in segregation and trapping. Introducing a gradual noise increase from the circle's center to the outer region reduces both global ($\phi$) and rotational ($\phi_r$) order, underscoring the impact of environmental heterogeneity and sudden annealing over gradual change. These findings offer insights into predicting and manipulating active agent dynamics in heterogeneous environments, with applications in biological and synthetic swarming systems.

Title: Control of Covalent Bond Enables Efficient Magnetic Cooling

Abstract: Magnetic cooling, harnessing the temperature change in matter when exposed to a magnetic field, presents an energy-efficient and climate-friendly alternative to traditional vapor-compression refrigeration systems, with a significantly lower global warming potential. The advancement of this technology would be accelerated if irreversible losses arising from hysteresis in magnetocaloric materials were minimized. Despite extensive efforts to manipulate crystal lattice constants at the unit-cell level, mitigating hysteresis often compromises cooling performance. Herein, we address this persistent challenge by forming Sn(Ge)3/Sn(Ge)3 bonds within the unit cell of the Gd5Ge4 compound. Our approach enables an energetically favorable phase transition, leading to the elimination of thermal hysteresis. Consequently, we achieve a synergistic improvement of two key magnetocaloric figures of merit: a larger magnetic entropy change and a twofold increase in the reversible adiabatic temperature change (from 3.8 to 8 K) in the Gd5Sn2Ge2 compound. Such synergies can be extended over a wide temperature range. This study demonstrates a paradigm shift in mastering hysteresis toward simultaneously achieving exceptional magnetocaloric metrics and opens up promising avenues for gas liquefaction applications in the longstanding pursuit of sustainable energy solutions.

Title: Luminescence-Induced Tunable Superconductivity in BSCCO via GaP Quantum Dots
Authors: Qingyu Hai, Duo Chen, Ruiyuan Bi, Yao Qi, Lifeng Xun, Xiaoyan Li, Xiaopeng Zhao
Abstract: The enhancement of superconducting properties in high-temperature copper-oxide superconductor B(P)SCCO remains a hot research topic in the field of superconducting materials. Building on previous research, here we introduce GaP quantum dots as an heterophase into the B(P)SCCO superconductor, aiming to enhance its superconductivity through the luminescent properties of GaP quantum dots. The experimental results demonstrate that the introduction of GaP quantum dots into B(P)SCCO generates significant tunable superconducting effects, leading to enhanced critical transition temperature (Tc), critical current density (Jc), and Meissner field (Hc) of B(P)SCCO with increasing luminescent intensity of the GaP quantum dots. The enhancement effect induced by GaP quantum dots exhibits a positive correlation with luminescent intensity, meaning samples with the addition of GaP quantum dots exhibiting higher luminescent intensity show elevated Tc, Jc, and Hc values. Unlike impurity effects, a distinct critical concentration dependency is observed. Notably, this GaP quantum dot modification strategy is not only effective in conventional superconductors but also applicable to high-temperature oxide superconductors.

Title: Topological characterization of phase transitions and critical edge states in one-dimensional non-Hermitian systems with sublattice symmetry
Authors: Longwen Zhou, Rujia Jing, Shenlin Wu
Abstract: Critical edge states appear at the bulk gap closing points of topological transitions. Their emergence signify the existence of topologically nontrivial critical points, whose descriptions fall outside the scope of gapped topological matter. In this work, we reveal and characterize topological critical points and critical edge states in non-Hermitian systems. By applying the Cauchy's argument principle to two characteristic functions of a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, we obtain a pair of winding numbers, whose combination yields a complete description of gapped and gapless topological phases in one-dimensional, two-band non-Hermitian systems with sublattice symmetry. Focusing on a broad class of non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chains, we demonstrate the applicability of our theory for characterizing gapless symmetry-protected topological phases, topologically distinct critical points, phase transitions along non-Hermitian phase boundaries and their associated topological edge modes. Our findings not only generalize the concepts of topologically nontrivial critical points and critical edge modes to non-Hermitian setups, but also yield additional insights for analyzing topological transitions and bulk-edge correspondence in open systems.

Title: Effective diffusion of Brownian motion in spatially quasi-periodic noise
Authors: Sang Yang, Zhixin Peng
Abstract: The effective diffusion of Brownian particles in periodic potential has been a central topic in nonequilibrium statistical physcis. A classical result is the Lifson formula which provides the effective diffusion constant in periodic potentials. Extending beyong periodicity, our recent work [arXiv:2504.16527] has demonstrated that a modified Lifson expression remains valid for Brownian motion in quasi-periodic potentials. In this work, we extend our previous results by incorporating spatial quasi-periodic noise and examining different stochastic interpretations, $\alpha\in[0,1]$. The proposed framework is simple, computationally efficient, and unifies the treatment of diffusion in both periodic and quasi-periodic systems.

Title: Phase Diagram and Spectral Function of the Two-Dimensional Disordered Bose-Hubbard Model: A Real-Space Dynamical Mean-Field Theory Analysis
Authors: Bastian Schindler, Renan da Silva Souza, Walter Hofstetter
Abstract: We numerically investigate the two-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model with local onsite disorder, where the competition between disorder and short-range interactions leads to the emergence of a Bose glass (BG) phase between the Mott insulator (MI) and superfluid (SF) phases. In order to analyze the inhomogeneous system we employ real-space bosonic dynamical mean-field theory and perform an ensemble average over disorder realizations. To distinguish the MI from the BG phase, we compare the Edwards-Anderson order parameter and the compressibility with the energy gap condition. To identify the insulator to SF transition, we apply a percolation analysis to the condensate order parameter. In qualitative accordance with the theorem of inclusions we always find an intermediate BG phase between the SF and MI. However, the quantitative comparison indicates significant deviations between the MI to BG phase boundary expected in the thermodynamic limit and the one obtained for a finite system size. Analyzing the spectral function in the strong-coupling regime reveals evidence for analytically predicted damped localized modes in the dispersion relation.

Title: Odd-Parity Selection in Parity-Forbidden Electronic Transitions Revealed by Mn4+ Fluorescence Spectroscopy
Authors: Yitong Wang, Fei Tang, Jiqiang Ning, Shijie Xu
Abstract: Mn4+-doped fluoride phosphors represent a significant class of narrow band red-emitting materials, whose luminescent properties are profoundly influenced by electron-phonon coupling. However, the parity-forbidden nature of these electronic transition systems is incompatible with the conventional Condon approximation, which is widely adopted in the classic theories such as the Huang-Rhys theory, a framework established on the assumption of parity-allowed electric dipole transitions. This results in a critical knowledge gap regarding the principles governing the phonon sidebands of parity-forbidden electronic transitions. This study experimentally reveals a pronounced parity-dependent intensity distribution in the phonon sidebands of these systems: significantly suppressed even-order sidebands and normally observed odd-order sidebands. To elucidate the phenomenon, we extend the Huang-Rhys theory to parity-forbidden systems by incorporating the Herzberg-Teller approximation into the treatment of the transition matrix elements. The improved theory successfully uncovers the physical mechanism behind the strong suppression of the even-order sidebands in the parity-forbidden systems, in which the Huang-Rhys factor is derived as S=((2I_3)/(9I_1 ))^(1/2). This work not only reveals new findings regarding the phonon sidebands of the parity-forbidden electronic transition systems, but also establishes an improved theoretical framework for understanding the electron-phonon coupling mechanisms of color centers in solids.

Title: Short-time blowup statistics of a Brownian particle in repulsive potentials
Authors: Baruch Meerson
Abstract: We study the dynamics of an overdamped Brownian particle in a repulsive scale-invariant potential $V(x) \sim -x^{n+1}$. For $n > 1$, a particle starting at position $x$ reaches infinity in a finite, randomly distributed time. We focus on the short-time tail $T \to 0$ of the probability distribution $P(T, x, n)$ of the blowup time $T$ for integer $n > 1$. Krapivsky and Meerson [Phys. Rev. E \textbf{112}, 024128 (2025)] recently evaluated the leading-order asymptotics of this tail, which exhibits an $n$-dependent essential singularity at $T = 0$. Here we provide a more accurate description of the $T \to 0$ tail by calculating, for all $n = 2, 3, \dots$, the previously unknown large pre-exponential factor of the blowup-time probability distribution. To this end, we apply a WKB approximation -- at both leading and subleading orders -- to the Laplace-transformed backward Fokker--Planck equation governing $P(T, x, n)$. For even $n$, the WKB solution alone suffices. For odd $n$, however, the WKB solution breaks down in a narrow boundary layer around $x = 0$. In this case, it must be supplemented by an ``internal'' solution and a matching procedure between the two solutions in their common region of validity.

Title: Identification of the transport regimes of the one-dimensional Holstein model
Authors: Suzana Miladić, Nenad Vukmirović
Abstract: The Holstein model is a benchmark model of systems with electron-phonon interaction. However, its electrical transport properties are not yet fully understood. In this work, we performed numerically exact calculations of imaginary-time current-current correlation function of the Holstein Hamiltonian for a broad range of model parameters. These calculations were performed using a path-integral based Quantum Monte Carlo method. We compared these results with the results obtained under the assumption of conventional band transport, small polaron hopping and polaron band transport. From this comparison we identified the regions in parameter space where each of these transport regimes is valid. In some cases when imaginary-time comparison of current-current correlation functions could not give conclusive results, we complemented them with real-time comparisons or the comparison with literature data on numerically exact dc mobilities. Overall, we found that the parameter space is almost completely covered by the three mentioned transport regimes.

Title: Phase diagram and eigenvalue dynamics of stochastic gradient descent in multilayer neural networks
Authors: Chanju Park (Swansea University), Biagio Lucini (Queen Mary University of London), Gert Aarts (Swansea University)
Abstract: Hyperparameter tuning is one of the essential steps to guarantee the convergence of machine learning models. We argue that intuition about the optimal choice of hyperparameters for stochastic gradient descent can be obtained by studying a neural network's phase diagram, in which each phase is characterised by distinctive dynamics of the singular values of weight matrices. Taking inspiration from disordered systems, we start from the observation that the loss landscape of a multilayer neural network with mean squared error can be interpreted as a disordered system in feature space, where the learnt features are mapped to soft spin degrees of freedom, the initial variance of the weight matrices is interpreted as the strength of the disorder, and temperature is given by the ratio of the learning rate and the batch size. As the model is trained, three phases can be identified, in which the dynamics of weight matrices is qualitatively different. Employing a Langevin equation for stochastic gradient descent, previously derived using Dyson Brownian motion, we demonstrate that the three dynamical regimes can be classified effectively, providing practical guidance for the choice of hyperparameters of the optimiser.

Title: When Blood Parts Ways: Phase Separation in Microstructured Environments
Authors: Sampad Laha, Ananta Kumar Nayak, Alexander Farutin, Suman Chakraborty, Chaouqi Misbah
Abstract: Understanding how red blood cell (RBC) suspensions navigate porous materials is critical for for both fundamental physiology, such as maternal-fetal exchange in the placenta, and transformative biomedical applications, including rapid, low-cost disease diagnostics from a single drop of blood in resource-constrained settings. Here we elucidate how RBC movement through fibrous microporous structures is influenced by cell aggregation agents, emphasizing the impact of their clustering, membrane flexibility, and confinement. By varying the volume fraction of the RBC (hematocrit) and aggregation strength, we reveal a surprising phase separation: a dense RBC core surrounded by a cell-free layer, an effect not previously reported in whole blood studies. This separation is shown to be more pronounced with rigidified cells and persists even at high hematocrit levels, unlike in healthy samples. By connecting RBC deformability and aggregability to pore-mediated phase dynamics, our study provides a foundation for new diagnostic tools capable of classifying blood disorders or evaluating blood quality using only a sheet of structured paper, seamlessly integrating fundamental fluid mechanics with translational biomedical innovation in a previously unexplored manner.

Title: Two-level system loss characterization of NbTi superconducting resonators on Si/SiO2 substrates
Authors: Bongkeon Kim, Yong-Joo Doh
Abstract: Superconducting coplanar waveguide (SCPW) resonators, key components for quantum computing and sensing applications, require a high internal quality factor (Qi) for effective qubit readout and quantum sensing applications. Minimizing two-level system (TLS) losses, particularly at material interfaces, is critical for gatemon and topological qubits operating at low temperatures and in high magnetic fields. NbTi, a superconducting alloy with a high upper critical field, enables SCPW resonators resilient to such conditions. We fabricated NbTi SCPW resonators on Si/SiO2 substrates and systematically characterized their TLS-limited quality factors as functions of temperature and microwave photon number. Our results demonstrate that NbTi-based SCPWs on Si/SiO2 substrates provide a promising platform for developing next-generation quantum circuits.

Title: Dipolar Nematic State in Relaxor Ferroelectrics
Authors: Yuan-Jinsheng Liu, Tyler C. Sterling, Shi Liu
Abstract: Relaxor ferroelectrics exhibit exceptional dielectric and electromechanical properties, yet their microscopic origins remain elusive due to the interplay of hierarchical polar structures and chemical complexity. While models based on polar nanoregions or nanodomains offer valuable phenomenological insights, they often lack the first-principles predictive capability necessary for quantitatively describing functional properties such as piezoelectric coefficients. Here, we use large-scale molecular dynamics simulations, enabled by a universal first-principles-based machine-learning interatomic potential, to investigate atomic-scale polar dynamics in canonical Pb-, Bi-, and Ba-based relaxors. Across all systems, we uncover a universal dipolar nematic state, characterized by long-range orientational order of local polarizations without local alignment, challenging conventional polar cluster-based paradigms. We introduce a universal order parameter, derived from the skewness of the distributions of the local polarization autocorrelation functions, that captures the thermal evolution of both lead-based and lead-free systems within a single master curve. This nematic order, and its robust structural memory under electric field cycling, underpins key relaxor phenomena, including diffuse phase transition, frequency-dependent dielectric dispersion, and reversible giant piezoelectricity. Our findings establish a unified microscopic framework for relaxors and present a broadly applicable statistical approach to understanding complex disordered materials.

Title: Quantum Spin Hall effect on planar Archimedean lattices
Authors: L. V. Duc Pham, Nicki F. Hinsche, Ingrid Mertig
Abstract: Archimedean lattices constitute a unique family of two-dimensional tilings formed from regular polygons arranged with uniform vertex configurations. While the kagome lattice has been extensively studied and the snub square lattice has served as a quasicrystal approximant, the broader family remains comparatively unexplored in the context of electronic and topological properties. In this work, we present a systematic tight-binding study of all eight pure Archimedean lattices, incorporating both $s$ and $p$ orbitals. We analyze their band structures, investigate topological edge states arising from unconventional nanoribbon geometries, and evaluate $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariants as well as intrinsic spin Hall conductivities using the Kubo formalism. Our results reveal that several Archimedean lattices, such as the truncated hexagonal and truncated trihexagonal lattices, host nearly dispersionless flat bands extending across the Brillouin zone, which remain robust even in the presence of next-nearest-neighbor hopping and strong spin-orbit coupling. In particular, the truncated trihexagonal lattice supports topologically protected, highly spin-polarized edge states across multiple ribbon geometries. These states are stable against defects and spin-flip scattering, and they give rise to sizable spin Hall currents.

Title: The non-perturbative sides of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation
Authors: Léonie Canet
Abstract: The Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation is a celebrated non-linear stochastic equation yielding non-equilibrium universal scaling. It exhibits notorious non-perturbative aspects. The KPZ fixed point is strong-coupling, all the more in $d>1$. Strikingly, another, even stronger-coupling fixed point of the KPZ equation, called inviscid Burgers fixed point, has been recently unveiled. These non-pertubative features can be theoretically accessed and studied in a controlled way in all dimensions using the functional renormalisation group. We propose an overview of the related results, which provide the full picture of the fixed-point structure and associated scaling regimes of the KPZ equation in $d=1$ and in higher dimensions.

Title: Quality of Helicity-Dependent Magnetization Switching by Phonons
Authors: F.G.N. Fennema, C.S. Davies, A. Tsukamoto, A. Kirilyuk
Abstract: Optical control of magnetization has emerged as a promising approach to achieve ultrafast and energy-efficient magnetization reversal. Here, we investigate helicity-dependent switching of magne- tization driven by the resonant excitation of circularly-polarized transverse-optical phonons, using a polarization-modulated transient grating. Our results show that the polarized phonons within the sample substrate induce robust, helicity-defined magnetization reversal in the magnetic overlayer. Moreover, the quality of switching remains largely unaffected when the degree of ellipticity of the infrared excitation is varied at frequencies resonant with the targeted phonon modes. Conversely, as the excitation is moved slightly off-resonance, switching quality becomes highly sensitive to the ellipticity of the incident light.

Title: Ideal Optical Flux Lattices
Authors: Ophelia Evelyn Sommer, Nigel R. Cooper
Abstract: The realization of fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states in cold atomic gases is a long-standing goal in quantum simulation. Established approaches, including rapidly rotating gases and tight-binding lattices, are often hampered by low interaction energies and small many-body energy gaps. While optical flux lattices (OFLs) can achieve higher effective magnetic flux densities, standard two-state configurations generate highly non-uniform fields, and extensions to multi-state systems introduce significant experimental complexity. Here, we present a new paradigm for engineering robust FQH phases in OFLs using only two internal atomic states. We show that the introduction of an additional scalar potential provides a generic mechanism for creating Chern bands that are simultaneously essentially flat and "ideal." Drawing on concepts from moiré materials, these desirable properties arise by tuning lattice parameters to certain $N$-flat manifolds $(N=1,2,\dots)$, where the $1$-flat manifold shares its origin with certain "magic-angle" conditions. We provide a variety of examples of how to design optical flux lattices, including dark-state OFLs, to achieve these goals. This method allows for precise tuning of band flatness and stabilizes both Abelian and non-Abelian FQH phases. Our scheme is compatible with existing experimental capabilities using vector polarizability, opening practical routes to exploring strongly correlated topological physics with cold atoms.

Title: Realizing Blume-Capel Degrees of Freedom with Toroidal Moments in a Ruby Artificial Spin Ice
Authors: Luca Berchialla, Gavin M. Macauley, Flavien Museur, Tianyue Wang, Armin Kleibert, Peter M. Derlet, Laura J. Heyderman
Abstract: Realizing exotic Hamiltonians beyond the Ising model is a key pursuit in experimental statistical physics. One such example is the Blume-Capel model, a three-state spin model, whose phase diagram features a tricritical point where second-order and first-order transition lines converge, leading to a coexistence of paramagnetic, ferromagnetic, and disordered phases. Here, we realize an artificial crystal of single-domain nanomagnets, placed on the links of the Ruby lattice, enabling real-space observation of the Blume-Capel degrees of freedom. These Blume-Capel degrees of freedom are represented by the presence, sign and interactions of the toroidal moments that emerge naturally in plaquettes of nanomagnets in the Ruby artificial spin ice. By precisely tuning the lattice parameters of the Ruby artificial spin ice, we demonstrate control over the two-step ordering process of the toroidal moments, whereby there is a high-temperature crossover from a paramagnetic phase to an intermediate paratoroidic regime, followed by a second-order phase transition to a ferrotoroidic ground state. This sequence of toroidal phases and transitions is accurately captured by the Blume-Capel framework and provides a direct realization of a substantial portion of the phase diagram associated with the model. This establishes a new platform for exploring exotic Hamiltonians in terms of artificial spin ice superstructures, here with groups of nanomagnets forming toroidal moments. The success of this mapping paves the way for an entirely new frontier in artificial spin ice: intentionally engineering lattice designs whose effective Hamiltonians mediate unconventional forms of magnetic order, with new behaviors and functionalities.

Title: Active sorting to boundaries in active nematic -- passive isotropic fluid mixtures
Authors: Saraswat Bhattacharyya, Julia M. Yeomans
Abstract: We use a two-fluid model to study a confined mixture of an active nematic fluid and a passive isotropic fluid. We find that an extensile active fluid preferentially accumulates at a boundary if the anchoring is planar, whereas its boundary concentration decreases for homeotropic anchoring. These tendencies are reversed if the active fluid is contractile. We argue that the sorting results from gradients in the nematic order, and show that the behaviour can be driven by either imposed boundary anchoring or spontaneous anchoring induced by active flows. Our results can be tested by experiments on microtubule-kinesin motor networks, and may be relevant to sorting to the boundary in cell colonies or cancer spheroids.

Title: Electron transfer between surface-acoustic-wave-induced moving and static quantum dots
Authors: Mikel Olano, Geza Giedke
Abstract: Fast long-range interactions between distant quantum dots in arrays remains an unsolved issue, which can be key to solve scalability issues in quantum simulation and computation processes, particularly related to the overhead associated with quantum error correction schemes. Furthermore, transport between static and moving quantum dots, relevant in surface acoustic wave induced experiments, has not been studied in detail. This article presents a paradigmatic model for picturing this process, where non-adiabatic terms driving a two-state transfer process are derived and discussed. Moreover, the main effects in the spin state of the electron and its effect on the transfer probability of the loading are analyzed including the most relevant interaction in semiconductor heterostructure induced 2 dimensional electron gases i.e. the Rashba-Dresselhaus terms.

Title: Magnetic-Field Control of Emergent Order in a 3D Dipolar Pyramid Artificial Spin Ice
Authors: Luca Berchialla, Gavin M. Macauley, Flavien Museur, Anja Weber, Laura J. Heyderman
Abstract: We realize a three-dimensional artificial spin ice of disconnected nanomagnets interacting solely via dipolar coupling, patterned on square pyramids. This Pyramid artificial spin ice, with both tilted and in-plane nanomagnets, supports tunable states. Monte Carlo simulations reveal a rich phase diagram and an emergent square ice of vertex-level effective spins. Tailored demagnetization protocols and magnetic force microscopy allow experimental access to low-energy states, establishing a platform for exploring three-dimensional artificial spin ices.

Title: Conductive domain walls in ferroelectrics as tunable coherent THz radiation source
Authors: Ramaz Khomeriki, Kathrin Dörr, Jamal Berakdar
Abstract: THz emission associated with currents in conductive domains in BiFeO$_3$ following infrared radiation is theoretically investigated. This experimentally observed phenomenon is explained by the domain wall stripes acting as metallic resonators with the oscillating charge accumulation being at the domain wall edges. The charge oscillation frequency is related to the plasma frequency inside the domain wall. The value of plasma frequency determines both the frequency and the amplitude of the emission emanating from the BiFeO$_3$ lattice. We show that for certain geometries of the domain wall structure and for specific polarization of the incident pulse the THz emission embodies a non-vanishing chirality.

Title: Geometric phases on graphene from Atiyah-Singer index theorem
Authors: M. Dantas, A. Carvalho, G. Garcia, C. Furtado
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of geometric phases in graphene-based nanostructures through the lens of the Atiyah-Singer index theorem. By modeling low-energy quasiparticles in curved graphene geometries as Dirac fermions, we demonstrate that topological defects arising from the insertion of pentagonal or heptagonal carbon rings generate effective gauge fields that induce quantized Berry phases. We derive a compact expression for the geometric phase in terms of the genus and number of open boundaries of the structure, providing a topological classification of zero-energy modes. This framework enables a deeper understanding of quantum holonomies in graphene and their potential application in holonomic quantum computation. Our approach bridges discrete lattice models with continuum index theory, yielding insights that are both physically intuitive and experimentally accessible.

Title: Dynamics of Loschmidt echoes from operator growth in noisy quantum many-body systems
Authors: Takato Yoshimura, Lucas Sá
Abstract: We study the dynamics of Loschmidt echoes in noisy quantum many-body systems without conservation laws. We first show that the operator Loschmidt echo in noisy unitary dynamics is equivalent to the operator norm of the corresponding dissipative dynamics upon noise averaging. We then analyze this quantity in two complementary ways, revealing universal dynamical behavior. First, we develop a heuristic picture for generic Floquet systems that connects Loschmidt echoes, out-of-time-order correlators, and operator growth, which is valid at any dissipation strength. We assert that the Loschmidt echo has two dynamical regimes depending on the time $t$ and the strength of the noise $p$: Gaussian decay for $pt\ll1$ and exponential decay (with a noise-independent decay rate) for $pt\gg1$. Lastly, we rigorously prove all our results for a solvable chaotic many-body quantum circuit, the dissipative random phase model -- thus providing exact insight into dissipative quantum chaos.

Title: Disorder-aided Early Warning Signals: Predicting Catastrophic Shifts in Athermal Systems
Authors: Tapas Bar, Anurag Banerjee, Blai Casals, Gustau Catalan, Javier Rodríguez-Viejo
Abstract: The early prediction of tipping points, distinguished by sudden and catastrophic shifts from stable states, poses a challenging task that would enable us to assess the impending threat across natural and engineered systems. This threat becomes particularly acute in low-fluctuation environments, where tipping occurs through saddle-node bifurcation without prior warning in noise dynamics. In this study, we investigate the tipping point dynamics of avalanche catastrophes in low-fluctuation domain, employing model system like the zero temperature random field Ising model and thermally deposited cobalt films. As the system approaches the tipping point, avalanche activity reveals pronounced critical behaviour, including critical slowing down, variance enhancement, and a growing spatial correlation length--hallmarks that may serve as early warning signals of impending collapse. Crucially, we demonstrate that increasing disorder in the system reduces its vulnerability to catastrophic failure. In highly disorder regimes, these early warning signals emerge well before the transition, thereby providing a large margin for anticipation and mitigation. This key finding suggests a protective role of disorder offering a novel perspective on resilience in complex systems. Our results not only deepen the understanding of tipping phenomena in disorder materials but also have broader implications for forecasting regime shift in diverse real-world systems.

Title: Reduced fidelities for free fermions out of equilibrium: From dynamical quantum phase transitions to Mpemba effect
Authors: Gilles Parez, Vincenzo Alba
Abstract: We investigate the out-of-equilibrium dynamics after a quantum quench of the reduced fidelities between the states of a subregion $A$ at different times. Precisely, we consider the fidelity between the time-dependent state of $A$ and its initial value, as well as with the state at infinite time. We denote these fidelities as the reduced Loschmidt echo (RLE) and the final-state fidelity (FSF), respectively. If region $A$ is the full systems, the RLE coincide with the standard Loschmidt echo. We focus on quenches from Gaussian states in several instances of the XY spin chain. In the hydrodynamic limit of long times and large sizes of $A$, with their ratio fixed, the reduced fidelities admit a quasiparticle picture interpretation. Interestingly, for some quenches in the hydrodynamic regime the RLE features a complicated structure with an infinite sequence of nested lightcones, corresponding to quasiparticles with arbitrary large group velocities. This leads to a ''staircase'' of cusp-like singularities in the time-derivative of the fidelity. At the sub-hydrodynamic regime for some quenches the RLE exhibits cusp-like singularities, similar to the so-called dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPT). We conjecture a criterion for the occurrence of the DQPT and for the ''critical'' times at which the singularities occur. Finally, we discuss the hydrodynamic limit of the FSF. In particular, we show that it provides a valuable tool to detect the so-called quantum Mpemba effect.

Title: Embodying computation in nonlinear perturbative metamaterials
Authors: Sima Zahedi Fard, Paolo Tiso, Parisa Omidvar, Marc Serra-Garcia
Abstract: Designing metamaterials that carry out advanced computations poses a significant challenge. A powerful design strategy splits the problem into two steps: First, encoding the desired functionality in a discrete or tight-binding model, and second, identifying a metamaterial geometry that conforms to the model. Applying this approach to information-processing tasks requires accurately mapping nonlinearity -- an essential element for computation -- from discrete models to geometries. Here we formulate this mapping through a nonlinear coordinate transformation that accurately connects tight-binding degrees of freedom to metamaterial excitations in the nonlinear regime. This transformation allows us to design information-processing metamaterials across the broad range of computations that can be expressed as tight-binding models, a capability we showcase with three examples based on three different computing paradigms: a coherent Ising machine that approximates combinatorial optimization problems through energy minimization, a mechanical racetrack memory exemplifying in-memory computing, and a speech classification metamaterial based on analog neuromorphic computing.

Title: Quantum Computation of the Electronic Structure of Some Prototype Solids
Authors: Naman Khandelwal, Nidhi Verma, Pooja Jamdagni, Ashok Kumar
Abstract: Over the last decade, researchers have been working to improve a crucial aspect of quantum computing to predict Hamiltonian energy of solids. Quantum algorithms such as Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and Variational Quantum Deflation (VQD) have been used to study the molecular systems. However, there is growing interest in adapting and applying these methods to periodic solid-state materials. In this work, we have integrated first-principles density functional theory with VQE and VQD algorithms and utilizing the Wannier Tight-Binding Hamiltonian (WTBH) method to predict the electronic characteristics of solids. We demonstrate that VQE and VQD algorithms can be used to accurately predict electronic characteristics in a variety of multi-component prototype solid-state materials such as-Silicon (semiconductor), Gold (metallic), Boron Nitrile (insulator), Graphene (semi-metal). Efficient SU2 performs well among all the predefined ansatz used in the study. COBYLA is the fastest optimizer among the classical optimizers with minimum number of iterations for convergence. Results of noise models help to understand the band structure when calculated on real quantum hardware. As quantum hardware advances, our method stands as a prototype for future quantum simulations of materials pushing us closer to autonomous quantum discovery engines.

Title: Racetrack computing with a topological boundary ratchet
Authors: Parisa Omidvar, Markus Bestler, Sima Zahedi Fard, Oded Zilberberg, Marc Serra-Garcia
Abstract: Multistable order parameters provide a natural means of encoding non-volatile information in spatial domains, a concept that forms the foundation of magnetic memory devices. However, this stability inherently conflicts with the need to move information around the device for processing and readout. While in magnetic systems, domains can be transported using currents or external fields, mechanisms to robustly shuttle information-bearing domains across neutral systems are scarce. Here, we experimentally realize a topological boundary ratchet in an elastic metamaterial, where digital information is encoded in buckling domains and transported in a quantized manner via cyclic loading. The transport is topological in origin: neighboring domains act as different topological pumps for their Bogoliubov excitations, so their interface hosts topological boundary modes. Cyclic loading renders these modes unstable through inter-domain pressure, which in turn drives the motion of the domain wall. We demonstrate that the direction of information propagation can be controlled through adjustable mechanical constraints on the buckling beams, and numerically investigate buckling-based domain-wall logic circuits in an elastic metamaterial network. The underlying tight-binding structure with low-order nonlinearities makes this approach a general pathway toward racetrack memories in neutral systems.

Title: Generalized Rényi Entropy Production Rate in Non-equilibrium Systems: From Markov Processes to Chaotic Dynamics
Authors: J.M. Nieto-Villar, R. Mansilla, I. Santamaria-Holek
Abstract: A generalization of the entropy production rate is proposed $\Pi_q$ in non-equilibrium systems by extending the formalism of classical stochastic thermodynamics to regimes with non-Gaussian fluctuations. Through the Rényi entropy $S_q$ , where entropic parameter $q$ modulates critical fluctuations, it is defined $\Pi_q$ and the postulated generalized $q$-affinity ${\cal A}_q$ for Markov processes, where it is demonstrated that $\Pi_q \geq 0$, generalizing the second thermodynamics this http URL derived formal framework was applied to the Rössler model, a nonlinear dynamical system exhibiting chaos. Numerical simulations show that the entropy production rate $\Pi_q$ can be used as an index of robustness and complexity by quantitatively corroborating the greater robustness of funnel-type chaos compared to spiral-type chaos. Our results reveal limitations of Gibbs-Shannon entropy in capturing non-Gaussian fluctuations induced by nonlinearity. On the contrary, it is found that $\Pi_q$ it can be a suitable magnitude to measure the intensity of chaotic dynamics through the entropy parameter $q$ , indicating a plausible link with Lyapunov exponents. The proposed formal framework extends the scope of stochastic thermodynamics to complex systems, integrating chaotic dynamics and the role of the entropic index q as a source of irreversibility and in capturing non-Gaussian contributions to entropy production.

Title: Direct spatiotemporal imaging of a long-lived bulk photovoltaic effect in $BiFeO_{3}$
Authors: Saptam Ganguly, Sebin Varghese, Aaron M. Schankler, Xianfei Xu, Kazuki Morita, Michel Viret, Andrew M. Rappe, Gustau Catalan, Klaas-Jan Tielrooij
Abstract: The bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE), a manifestation of broken centrosymmetry, has attracted interest as a probe of the symmetry and quantum geometry of materials, and for use in novel optoelectronic devices. Despite its bulk nature, the BPVE is typically measured with interfaces and metal contacts, raising concerns as to whether the observed signals are genuinely of bulk origin. Here, we use a contactless pump-probe microscopy method to observe the space- and time-resolved dynamics of photoexcited carriers in single-crystal, monodomain $BiFeO_{3}$. We observe asymmetric transport of carriers along the polar axis, confirming the intrinsic bulk and symmetry-driven nature of BPVE. This asymmetric transport persists for several nanoseconds after photoexcitation, which cannot be explained by the shift or phonon ballistic current BPVE mechanisms. Monte Carlo simulations show that asymmetric momentum scattering by defects under non-equilibrium conditions explains the long-lived carrier drift, while first principles calculations confirm that oxygen vacancies have an asymmetric electronic state that can cause such asymmetric scattering. Our findings highlight the critical role of defects in long-lived photoresponses.

Title: Quantitative and bond-traceable resonant X-ray optical tensors of organic molecules
Authors: Victor Murcia, Obaid Alqahtani, Harlan Heilman, Brian A. Collins
Abstract: X-ray scattering at the carbon absorption edge is uniquely sensitive to local molecular bond identity and orientation in organic nanostructures, encoded as a function of photon energy and polarization. However, quantitative analysis is precluded due to the lack of accurate optical models with bond and orientation specificity. We generate such a model through an algorithm that parameterizes and refines density functional theory calculations with angle-resolved absorbance spectroscopy measurements. The resulting optical tensor is shown to reproduce data from samples with domains of different orientation and crystalline packing, enabling label-free orientation analyses of individual chemical moieties within molecular nanostructures using resonant X-rays.

Title: Topological polar textures on CsPbBr3 nanoplatelets
Authors: Monika Bhakar, Pooja Bhardwaj, Gokul M. Anilkumar, Atikur Rahman, Goutam Sheet
Abstract: Polar topological textures like the bubble domains, flux--closures, and labyrinth etc., unlock functional responses in ferroic systems but are difficult to stabilize and control in chemically simple, solution--grown materials. Here we show that ultra--thin, large--area CsPbBr$_3$ nanoplatelets host room--temperature ferroelectric bubble domains whose characteristic size is tunable by thickness. Using contact--resonance piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) across 125ñm--2\~$\mu$m, we observe a systematic decrease in domain size with decreasing thickness, consistent with a depolarization--field controlled stability window. Repeated scanning transforms bubbles into labyrinthine patterns, indicating metastability under weak mechanical/electrical perturbations. Upon heating, bubbles evolve into labyrinths and vanish at $T_C\!\approx\!90^\circ$C, with domain nucleation recovered on cooling. These results establish a controllable platform for polar topology in a stable, stochiometric perovskite grown via a solvothermal route, and clarify how electrical boundary conditions (set by thickness and temperature) govern texture selection. The thickness--tunable polar textures identified here offer a route to engineer domain--wall--mediated functionalities in halide perovskites.

Title: AM-DefectNet: Additive Manufacturing Defect Classification Using Machine Learning - A comparative Study
Authors: Mohsen Asghari Ilani, Yaser Mike Banad
Abstract: Additive Manufacturing (AM) processes present challenges in monitoring and controlling material properties and process parameters, affecting production quality and defect detection. Machine Learning (ML) techniques offer a promising solution for addressing these challenges. In this study, we introduce a comprehensive framework, AM-DefectNet, for benchmarking ML models in melt pool characterization, a critical aspect of AM. We evaluate 15 ML models across 10 metrics using 1514 training and 505 test datasets. Our benchmarking reveals that non-linear tree-based algorithms, particularly CatBoost, LGBM, and XGBoost, outperform other models, achieving accuracies of 92.47%, 91.08%, and 90.89%, respectively. Notably, the Deep Neural Network (DNN) also demonstrates competitive performance with an accuracy of 88.55%. CatBoost emerges as the top-performing algorithm, exhibiting superior performance in precision, recall, F1-score, and overall accuracy for defect classification tasks. Learning curves provide insights into model performance and data requirements, indicating potential areas for improvement. Our study highlights the effectiveness of ML models in melt pool characterization and defect detection, laying the groundwork for process optimization in AM.

Authors: Mohsen Asghari Ilani, Yaser Mike Banad
Abstract: Electrical discharge machining (EDM) is a crucial process in precision manufacturing, leveraging electro-thermal energy to remove material without electrode contact. In this study, we delve into the realm of Machine Learning (ML) to enhance the efficiency and precision of EDM, particularly focusing on Powder-Mixed Electrical Discharge Machining (PMEDM) with the integration of a vibration system. We comprehensively evaluate four leading ML models - Deep Neural Network (DNN), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Adaptive Gradient Boosting (AdaBoost), and ElasticNet, against a pool of ML models, employing various evaluation metrics including Accuracy, Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Our evaluations, conducted on datasets enriched with features derived from powder addition and electrode vibration, reveal XGBoost superior accuracy, followed by AdaBoost, DNN, and ElasticNet. Furthermore, through the integration of Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) such as NSGA-II, NSGA-III, UNSGA-III, and C-TAEA, we explore and optimize the Pareto front to attain optimal solutions. Our findings underscore the transformative potential of ML and optimization techniques in advancing EDM processes, offering cost-effective, time-efficient, and reliable solutions for precision manufacturing applications.

Title: Hidden orders in spin-orbit entangled correlated insulators
Authors: Leonid V. Pourovskii, Dario Fiore Mosca, Lorenzo Celiberti, Sergii Khmelevskyi, Arun Paramekanti, Cesare Franchini
Abstract: In many materials, ordered phases and their order parameters are easily characterized by standard experimental methods. "Hidden order" refers to a phase transition in which an ordered state emerges without such an easily detectable order parameter, despite clear thermodynamic evidence of the transition. The underlying mechanisms for these unconventional states of matter stem from spin-orbit coupling, which intertwines inter-site exchange, classical electron-magnetic interactions, and electron-lattice effects. This physics is elusive to experimental probes and beyond traditional theories of insulating magnetism, requiring sophisticated methodologies for its exploration. In this Review, we survey exotic hidden-order phases in correlated insulators, particularly focusing on the latest progress in material-specific theories and numerical approaches. The relevant degrees of freedom in these phases are local high-rank multipole moments of magnetic and charge density that emerge from spin-orbit entangled correlated shells of heavy d and f electron ions and interact on the lattice via various mechanisms. We discuss approaches to modelling hidden orders in realistic systems via direct ab initio calculations or by constructing low-energy many-body effective Hamiltonian. We also describe how these new theoretical tools have helped to uncover driving mechanisms for recently discovered multipolar phases in double perovskites of heavy transition metals, and how they have proved instrumental in disentangling the role of various interactions in "traditional" f-electron multipolar materials like actinide dioxides. In both cases, material-specific theories have played a key role in interpreting and predicting experimental signatures of hidden orders.

Title: The Crooks relationship in single molecule pulling simulations of coupled harmonic oscillators
Authors: Julián David Jiménez-Paz, José Daniel Muñoz-Castaño
Abstract: In this work, we propose two models of coupled harmonic oscillators under Brownian motion to computationally study the applications of fluctuation theorems. This paper also illustrates how to analytically calculate free energy differences for these systems. The computational results clearly show that Crooks relation is able to predict free energy differences between initial and final canonical ensembles with around $1\%$ accuracy by using probability distributions of cumulative work done during nonequilibrium protocols carried out with velocities up to three orders of magnitude larger than the quasi-stationary evolution velocity. The curves of instantaneous force and cumulative work for the second model resemble those obtained experimentally on the unfolding of ARN molecules. Hence, the proposed systems are not just useful to illustrate the performance and conceptual significance of the fluctuation theorems, but also they could be studied as simplified models for biophysical systems.

Title: Intermittent localization and fast spatial learning by non-Markov random walks with decaying memory
Authors: Paulina R. Martí n-Cornejo, Denis Boyer
Abstract: Random walks on lattices with preferential relocation to previously visited sites provide a simple modeling of the displacements of animals and humans. When the lattice contains a single impurity or resource site where the walker spends more time on average at each visit than on the other sites, the long range memory can suppress diffusion and induce by reinforcement a steady state localized around the resource. This phenomenon can be identified with a spatial learning process by the walker. Here we study theoretically and numerically how the decay of memory impacts learning in these models. If memory decays as $1/\tau$ or slower, where $\tau$ is the time backward into the past, the localized solutions are the same as with perfect, non-decaying memory and they are linearly stable. If forgetting is faster than $1/\tau$, for instance exponential, an unusual regime of intermittent localization is observed, where well localized periods of exponentially distributed duration are interspersed with intervals of diffusive motion. At the transition between the two regimes, for a kernel in $1/\tau$, the approach to the stable localized state is the fastest, opposite to the expected critical slowing down effect. Hence forgetting can allow the walker to save memory without compromising learning and to achieve a faster learning. These findings agree with biological evidence on the benefits of forgetting.

Title: Spin-orbit torque control of topology in intrinsic antiferromagnetic insulators
Authors: Rajibul Islam, Shakeel Ahmad, Fei Xue
Abstract: Magnetic topological insulators host exotic phenomena such as the quantum anomalous Hall effect and quantized magnetoelectric responses, but dynamic electrical control of their topological phases remains elusive. Here we demonstrate from first principles that spin-orbit torque enables direct switching of the topological state in the intrinsic antiferromagnetic bilayer MnBi$_2$Te$_4$. A symmetry-enforced interband (time-reversal even) torque persists inside the bulk gap and deterministically reverses the Néel order and layer-resolved Chern number without free carriers. Upon doping, both interband and intraband torques are amplified, lowering the critical electric field for switching by two orders of magnitude. Together, these results establish two complementary regimes of control, dissipationless in-gap torques without Joule heating and enhanced current-induced torques, providing a robust route to manipulate local Chern numbers, quasi-helical edge states, and topological responses in antiferromagnetic topological insulators.

Title: Optical Voltammetry of redox processes inside a nanohole with Opto-iontronic microscopy
Authors: Zhu Zhang, Haolan Tao, Cheng Lian, René van Roij, Sanli Faez
Abstract: Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) is the most commonly used method in electrochemistry to characterize electrochemical reactions, usually involving macroscopic electrodes. Here we demonstrate a novel optical CV technique called Opto-iontronic Microscopy, which is capable of monitoring electrochemical processes at the nanoscale. By integrating optical microscopy with nanohole electrodes, we enhance sensitivity in detecting redox reactions within volumes as small as an attoliter ($(100 \text{~nm})^{3}$). This technique uses total internal reflection (TIR) illumination, Electric-double-layer modulation, cyclic voltammetry, and lock-in detection, to probe ion dynamics inside nanoholes. We applied this method to study EDL (dis)charging coupled to ferrocenedimethanol (Fc(MeOH)$_2$) redox reactions. Experimental results were validated against a theoretical Poisson-Nernst-Planck-Butler-Volmer (PNP-BV) model, providing insights into ion concentration changes of reaction species that contribute to the optical contrast. This work opens up opportunities for high-sensitivity, label-free analysis of electrochemical reactions in nanoconfined environments, with potential applications in pure nanocrystal growth and monitoring, and potentially single-molecule electrochemistry.

Title: A Practical Flake Segmentation and Indexing Pipeline for Automated 2D Material Stacking
Authors: Yutao Li, Logan Sherlock, Ryan Benderson, Daniel Ostrom, Huandong Chen, Kazuhiro Fujita, Abhay Pasupathy
Abstract: A cost-effective and robust image-processing pipeline is presented for the detection and characterization of exfoliated two-dimensional (2D) material flakes in optical microscope images, designed to facilitate automation in van der Waals heterostructure assembly. The system combines shallow machine learning (ML)-based material classification with a precision-first flake detection algorithm driven by edge morphology and color discontinuity. Step edges are resolved when supported by optical contrast, while spurious features such as dust and background texture are reliably rejected. Each identified flake is exported in a structured format that includes centroid coordinates, bounding geometries, average RGB color, and estimated optical thickness, enabling seamless integration into automated pick-up and stacking workflows. The pipeline is hardware-light and operates without the need for deep learning models or nanoscale ground-truth labels, making it practical for scalable front-end wafer processing at a hardware cost of under 30,000 USD. In contrast to prior approaches that focus solely on detection accuracy, the proposed system unifies flake segmentation with indexing, filtering, and blueprint-driven stacking, forming a closed-loop workflow from image acquisition to device planning. Its low annotation requirement and flexible implementation enable rapid deployment across diverse 2D material systems and imaging conditions.

Title: Influence of Stretching Boundary Conditions on Fracture in Phantom Star Polymer Networks: From Volume to Cross-sectional Area Conservation
Authors: Yuichi Masubuchi, Takato Ishida, Yusuke Koide, Takashi Uneyama
Abstract: This study systematically investigates the effect of stretching boundary conditions, ranging from conservation of cross-sectional area to conservation of volume, on the rupture behavior of phantom star polymer networks using energy-minimizing coarse-grained molecular simulations. By continuously varying the deformation parameter, the simulations reveal that true stress and rupture characteristics, such as strain and stress at break and work for rupture, systematically decrease as the boundary condition approaches cross-sectional area conservation. In contrast, nominal stress and the corresponding rupture characteristics exhibit near-independence from boundary conditions, indicating that bond tension remains largely unaffected for phantom networks under the examined conditions. These results clarify that volume expansion primarily drives deviations in true stress and highlight a critical distinction between true and nominal stress-strain definitions. The difference between true and nominal stress-strain relations also affected the scaling exponent for strand length dependence on stretch at break. The findings stress the importance of specifying both deformation boundary conditions and stress-strain definitions in polymer network simulations for accurate interpretation of mechanical properties.

Title: A Concise Review of Recently Synthesized 2D Carbon Allotropes: Amorphous Carbon, Graphynes, Biphenylene and Fullerene Networks
Authors: Ricardo Paupitz, Alexandre F. Fonseca, Mizraim Bessa, Guilherme S. L. Fabris, William F. da Cunha, Leonardo D. Machado, Marcelo L. Pereira Junior, Luiz A. Ribeiro Junior Douglas S. Galvão
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) carbon allotropes have received considerable attention due to their unique properties and potential applications in several fields, including electronics, catalysis, energy storage, and sensing. Following the experimental realization of graphene, numerous other 2D carbon structures have been proposed and, in some cases, successfully synthesized. This work presents a concise review of the recently experimentally realized 2D carbon allotropes, including graphynes, biphenylene-based networks, fullerene networks, and monolayer amorphous carbon. For each class, we discuss structural characteristics, theoretical predictions, and synthesis methods, with emphasis on the interplay between theory and experiment. We also highlight instances where experimental studies overlooked relevant theoretical contributions. Finally, we identify theoretically predicted structures that remain unexplored experimentally, suggesting opportunities for synthesis-driven investigations.

Title: Magnonic radar for dynamic domain walls in synthetic antiferromagnets
Authors: Jin Lan, Yang Zhang
Abstract: Spin wave and magnetic domain wall are two of basic excitations in magnetic systems, and their spatiotemporal interplay encodes rich information of underlying magnetic interactions. In synthetic antiferromagnets, the domain wall acquires an inertia and the spin wave unlocks the full polarization degree of freedom, lays a salient platform for their interplay. Here we show that both the translational and angular velocities of domain wall in synthetic antiferromagnets can be detected via the scattered spin wave, through the synergy of translational and angular Doppler effects. Following the setup of an electromagnetic or acoustic radar, the time evolution of a domain wall state are accessible via a series of spin wave packets, in both non-invasive and invasive fashion. The inspections in frequency domain, offer new paradigms in exploration and exploitation of magnetic excitations.

Title: Raman spectroscopy of graphite with water as the pressure medium
Authors: K. Perry, A. T. Roy, A. R. Parmenter, Y. J. Ryu, V. B. Prakapenka, J. Lim
Abstract: We report a high-pressure Raman spectroscopy study of a graphite-water mixture using water as the pressure-transmitting medium up to 9.9 GPa. In the graphite-rich region, three characteristic Raman features-the $E_{2g}^{(1)}$ shear mode, the G band ($E_{2g}^{(2)}$), and the 2D band-were observed and tracked as a function of pressure. The G band exhibits a pronounced blue shift with increasing pressure, indicating enhanced interlayer coupling between graphite planes. In the water-rich region, the librational band and three distinct O-H stretching modes were identified. Notably, above 8 GPa, the slope of the pressure dependence decreases relative to the earlier report, likely due to the influence of the water pressure medium, emphasizing the need for further investigation at higher pressures.

Title: Defining structural gradient hardening through Type II back stress for heterostructured materials
Authors: En Ma, Ting Zhu
Abstract: The recently proposed term "heterostructured (HS) materials" serves as an umbrella classification encompassing a wide range of materials that hold great promise for enhanced mechanical properties. Most HS materials exhibit back-stress strengthening, as is typical for all plastically non-homogeneous materials. To better embody the distinctiveness of materials crafted via innovative heterostructuring, here we introduce the concept of "structural gradient hardening" (SGH), which captures an essential feature of HS materials and complements traditional strengthening mechanisms. SGH refers to the extra strengthening that arises from a characteristic gradient structure introduced by heterostructuring, beyond what is predicted by the rule of mixtures. This distinction is useful, as the overall back stress can in fact be partitioned into Type I and Type II components, with the latter specifically quantifying the extra hardening originating from the structural and strain gradients established by heterostructuring, as articulated in this Viewpoint article.

Title: Heavy Fermi polarons in a one-dimensional harmonic trap
Authors: Nikolay Yegovtsev
Abstract: We provide an analytically tractable toy model of an infinitely heavy impurity interacting with the spin-polarized gas of bath fermions via a contact potential in 1D and placed in a harmonic trap. The solution to this problem requires knowledge of the single-particle fermionic eigenstates in the presence of a harmonic trap and a contact potential. We show how the spectrum can be understood from a perturbative solution of the exact transcendental equation in the weak and strong-coupling regimes. We additionally provide expressions for normalized wavefunctions and different overlaps between the states in the presence and absence of the impurity. Using these exact results, we analyze the energy of the polaron, derive Tan's contact-like relation for the density at the center of the harmonic trap, and compute the quasiparticle residue.

Title: High-quality Tungsten-doped Vanadium Dioxide Thin Films Fabricated in an Extremely Low-oxygen Furnace Environment
Authors: Vishwa Krishna Rajan, Ken Araki, Robert Y. Wang, Liping Wang
Abstract: This work reports the fabrication and characterization of high-quality tungsten-doped vanadium dioxide (WxV1-xO2, x = 0~3 at. %) by thermal oxidation of sputtered tungsten-vanadium alloyed thin films with different atomic percentages and high-temperature annealing in an extremely low oxygen atmosphere (5 to 20 ppm) along with reduction of surface over-oxides in high vacuum (1 mPa). Oxidation parameters such as temperature, time and nitrogen purging rate are first optimized for obtaining high quality undoped VO2 thin film. Insulator-to-metal (IMT) phase transition behavior of VO2 thin films fabricated in a low-O2 environment is characterized with temperature dependent spectral infrared transmittance and electrical resistivity measurements, where there is 15% higher infrared transmittance change and additional 1 order change in resistivity in comparison with VO2 thin films fabricated in a O2-rich environment. Grazing angle X-ray diffraction scan confirms no presence of higher oxides in the VO2 oxidized in low-O2 environment, which improves its quality significantly. Comprehensive studies on thermal annealing and vacuum reduction for tungsten doped VO2 thin films are also carried out to find the optimal fabrication conditions. With the tungsten at. % measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, the optimal WVO2 thin films fabricated through this streamlined oxidation, annealing and reduction processes in extremely low-O2 furnace environment exhibit lowered IMT temperature at -23°C per at.% of tungsten dopants from 68°C without doping. This low-cost and scalable fabrication method could facilitate the wide development of tunable WVO2 coatings in thermal and energy applications.

Title: Intrinsic nonlinear valley Nernst effect in the strained bilayer graphene
Authors: Ying-Li Wu, Jia-Liang Wan, Xiao-Qin Yu
Abstract: We theoretically analyze the nonlinear valley Nernst effect (NVNE) as the second-order response of temperature gradient through the semiclassical framework of electron dynamics up to second order. Our study shows that an intrinsic nonlinear pure valley current can be generated vertically to the applied temperature in the materials with both inversion and time-reversal symmetries. This intrinsic NVNE has a quantum origin from the quantum metric and shows independence from the relaxation time. It's found that the local largest symmetry near the valleys for the nonvanishing intrinsic NVNE is a single mirror symmetry in two-dimensional systems. We theoretically investigate the intrinsic NVNE in the uniaxially strained gapless bilayer graphene and find the intrinsic NVNE can emerge when applying the temperature gradient vertically to the direction of strain. Interestingly, a transition from the compressive strain to the tensile one results in the sign reversal of the intrinsic NVNE.

Title: Thermodynamic uncertainty relation for generalized time-reversal observables
Authors: Tetta Indo, Yoshihiko Hasegawa
Abstract: Time-reversal symmetry plays an essential role in the thermodynamic uncertainty relation, which bound the fluctuations of observables in terms of the associated dissipation. In fact, thermodynamic uncertainty relations are typically derived under the assumption that the observable of interest is antisymmetric under time reversal. This also suggests that existing thermodynamic uncertainty relations are restricted to a limited class of observables. In this paper, we mitigate this restriction by introducing a new class of observables that do not exhibit the exact antisymmetry but only change the sign under time reversal. We call it generalized time reversal and derive a broadly applicable thermodynamic uncertainty relation for observables with this condition. The generalization is achieved by direct statistical arguments on the probability distributions of dissipation and the observable, and holds for both deterministic and stochastic dynamics. We demonstrate the derived thermodynamic uncertainty relation in a quantum refrigeration model, showing that the precision of generalized observables remains expressible in terms of the heat-dissipation cost. The result extends the scope of thermodynamic uncertainty relations beyond what was reached by frameworks relying on strong symmetries imposed by fluctuation theorems.

Title: Interfacial Control of both Magnetism and Polarization in a van der Waals Ferromagnet/Ferroelectric Heterostructure
Authors: Priyanshu Raj, Sourav Mal, Rana Saha, Prasenjit Sen
Abstract: Two-dimensional multiferroic van der Waals heterostructures provide a promising platform for the simultaneous control of distinct ferroic orders, with potential applications in magnetoelectric devices and spintronics. The practical implementation of such technologies requires 2D magnets with high Curie temperatures and strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA). Here, based on first-principles calculations, we propose a multiferroic heterostructure composed of the room-temperature ferromagnet $\text{Fe}_3\text{Ga}\text{Te}_2$ and the ferroelectric $\text{In}_2\text{Se}_3$. We show that intercalation of Fe atoms into the van der Waals gap of the $\text{Fe}_3\text{Ga}\text{Te}_2$/$\text{In}_2\text{Se}_3$ heterostructure enhances PMA by nearly an order of magnitude relative to the pristine $\text{Fe}_3\text{Ga}\text{Te}_2$ monolayer, while simultaneously allowing electric polarization to be modulated through interfacial charge redistribution. The enhancement of PMA arises from interfacial hybridization that modifies the spin-orbit coupling of Fe $d$-orbitals. Our results demonstrate an effective pathway to engineer magnetoelectric coupling in two-dimensional multiferroic heterostructures and pave the way toward energy-efficient spintronic devices.

Title: Dipolar Self-Interactions Drive Polymer Chain Collapse
Authors: Pratik Khandagale, Gal deBotton, Timothy Breitzman, Carmel Majidi, Kaushik Dayal
Abstract: We report that a dielectric polymer chain, constrained at both ends, sharply collapses when exposed to a high electric field. The chain collapse is driven by nonlocal dipolar interactions and anisotropic polarization of monomers, a characteristic of real polymers that prior theories were unable to incorporate. Once collapsed, a large number of chain monomers accumulate at the center location between the chain ends, locally increasing the electric field and polarization by orders of magnitude. The chain collapse is sensitive to the orientation of the applied electric field and chain stretch. Our findings not only offer new ways for rapid actuation and sensing but also provide a pathway to discover the critical physics behind instabilities and electrical breakdown in dielectric polymers.

Title: Coordinate space representation of a one dimensional $p$-wave pseudopotential
Authors: Marc Camus-Sais, Abel Rojo-Francàs, Grigori E. Astrakharchik, Bruno Juliá-Díaz
Abstract: We propose a discrete-space representation of the $p$-wave pseudopotential. The proposed representation is validated by applying it to the analytically solvable case of two fermions in a harmonic trap and successfully recovering the exact energy spectrum and eigenfunctions. Furthermore, we use the square-well and modified Pöschl-Teller potentials as finite-range representations of the $p$-wave interaction and study their convergence to the contact interaction when the range tends to zero. Finally, we perform natural orbital analysis and compute the eigenvalues of the one-body density matrix for different particle numbers, examining their dependence on the one-dimensional scattering length and identifying distinct physical regimes.

Title: Optically induced spin Hall current in monolayer Janus NbSSe: A first-principles study
Authors: Souren Adhikary, Tomoaki Kameda, Katsunori Wakabayashi
Abstract: Monolayer Janus transition-metal dichalcogenides possess Ising- and Rashba-type spin-orbit-couplings (SOC), leading to intriguing spin splitting effects at K and K$'$, and around $\Gamma$ points across the wide energy range. Using first-principles calculations, we unveil these SOC characteristics in metallic Janus NbSSe and demonstrate its potential for optically controlled spin current eneration. On the basis of the symmetry of the system, we show that different linear polarized light can selectively drive spin currents of distinct spin components. Our findings establish NbSSe as a promising candidate for next-generation optospintronic technologies, which is offering a pathway toward the development of polarization-tunable spin-current sources.

Title: Extremely Large and Angle-Dependent Magnetoresistance in Kagome Dirac Semimetal RFe$_6$Sn$_6$ (R=Ho, Dy)
Authors: Susanta Ghosh, Achintya Low, Nayana Devaraj, Susmita Changdar, Awadhesh Narayan, Setti Thirupathaiah
Abstract: We report on the electronic, magnetic, and magneto-transport properties of Fe-based kagome Dirac system, RFe$_6$Sn$_6$ (R = Ho, Dy). Magnetic properties study reveals an antiferromagnetic order with N$\acute{e}$el temperature of $T_N \approx$ 570 K. Additionally, a weak ferromagnetic order emerge at low temperatures. Magnetotransport measurements demonstrate an extremely large magnetoresistance (XMR) reaching as high as $3\times 10^{3} \%$ for HoFe$_6$Sn$_6$ and $ 1\times 10^{3} \%$ for DyFe$_6$Sn$_6$ when measured at 2 K with 9 T of magnetic field. The semi-classical two-band model fitting of the Hall conductivity reveals nearly perfect electron-hole compensation and high carrier mobility, which leads to XMR behaviour in these system. Further, we identify large magnetoresistance anisotropy for the magnetic fields applied in different crystallographic orientations. In addition, considerable modification in the angle-dependent magnetoresistance (ADMR) pattern has been noticed between 2 and 50 K, indicating temperature-dependent changes in the Fermi surface topology of these systems.

Title: Phase field simulation of dendrite growth in solid-state lithium batteries based on mechanical-thermo-electrochemical coupling
Authors: Pengyang Hou, Jiamiao Xie, Jingyang Li, Peng Zhang, Zhaokai Li, Wenqian Hao, Jia Tian, Zhe Wang, Fuzheng Li
Abstract: Solid-state lithium batteries possess numerous advantages, such as high energy density, excellent cycle stability, superior mechanical strength, non-flammability, enhanced safety, and extended service life. These characteristics make them highly suitable for applications in aerospace, new energy vehicles, and portable electronic devices. However, the growth of lithium dendrite at the electrode/electrolyte interface remains a critical challenge, limiting both performance and safety. The growth of lithium dendrites in the electrolyte not only reduces the Coulombic efficiency of the battery but also poses a risk of puncturing the electrolyte, leading to internal short circuits between the anode and cathode. This study is to solve the problem of lithium dendrite growth in solid-state lithium batteries by employing phase-field theory for numerical simulations. A phase-field model is developed by coupling the mechanical stress field, thermal field, and electrochemical field, to investigate the morphology and evolution of lithium dendrites under the condition of different ambient temperatures, external pressures, and their combined effects. The results indicate that higher temperature and greater external pressure significantly suppress lithium dendrite growth, leading to fewer side branches, smoother surfaces, and more uniform electrochemical deposition. Increased external pressure inhibits longitudinal dendrite growth, resulting in a compressed morphology with higher compactness, but at the cost of increased mechanical instability. The combined effect of temperature and pressure exhibits a pronounced inhibitory influence on dendrite growth, with stress concentrating at the dendrite roots. This stress distribution promotes lateral growth, facilitating the formation of flatter and denser lithium deposits.

Title: Boundary Renormalization Group Flow of Entanglement Entropy at a (2+1)-Dimensional Quantum Critical Point
Authors: Zhiyan Wang, Zhe Wang, Yi-Ming Ding, Zenan Liu, Zheng Yan, Long Zhang
Abstract: We investigate the second order Rényi entanglement entropy at the quantum critical point of spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on a columnar dimerized square lattice. The universal constant $\gamma$ in the area-law scaling $S_{2}(\ell) = \alpha\ell - \gamma$ is found to be sensitive to the entangling surface configurations, with $\gamma_{\text{sp}} > 0$ for strong-bond-cut (special) surfaces and $\gamma_{\text{ord}} < 0$ for weak-bond-cut (ordinary) surfaces, which is attributed to the distinct conformal boundary conditions. Introducing boundary dimerization drives a renormalization group (RG) flow from the special to the ordinary boundary criticality, and the constant $\gamma$ decreases monotonically with increasing dimerization strength, demonstrating irreversible evolution under the boundary RG flow. These results provide strong numerical evidence for a higher-dimensional analog of the $g$-theorem, and suggest $\gamma$ as a characteristic function for boundary RG flow in (2+1)-dimensional conformal field theory.

Title: Information-Theoretical Approach to Relaxation Time Distribution in Rheology: Log-Normal Relaxation Spectrum Model
Authors: Takashi Uneyama
Abstract: The relaxation modulus of a viscoelastic fluid can be decomposed into multiple Maxwell models and characterized by the relaxation spectrum for the relaxation time. It is empirically known that the logarithmic relaxation time is useful to express the relaxation spectrum. We use information geometry to analyze the relaxation modulus and shown that the logarithmic relaxation time is the most natural variable for the relaxation spectrum. Then we use information theory to estimate the most probable functional form for the relaxation spectrum. We show that the log-normal distribution is the information-theoretically most probable relaxation spectrum. We analyze the properties of the log-normal relaxation spectrum model and compare it with the fractional Maxwell model. The fractional Maxwell model with a small power-law exponent can be approximated as the log-normal relaxation spectrum model with a large standard deviation. We also compare the log-normal relaxation spectrum model with experimental linear viscoelasticity data for a high-density polyethylene, both at melt and solid states.

Title: Reentrant superconductivity and superconductor-to-insulator transition in a naturally occurring Josephson junction array tuned by RF power
Authors: S. Avraham, S. Sankar, S. Sandik, A. Burshtein, M. Goldstein, E. Sela, Y. Dagan
Abstract: Superconductivity, characterized by dissipationless current flow with flux expulsion or quantization, is usually muted when the magnetic field or the temperature is sufficiently high. However, in rare instances, superconductivity can reappear upon increasing the temperature or magnetic field, a phenomenon known as reentrant superconductivity. It usually emerges from competing orders in strongly correlated materials. Here we demonstrate reentrant superconductivity as a function of both temperature and magnetic field, tuned by radio frequency (RF) power in a relatively simple system: granular aluminum (grAl), which exhibits the properties of a naturally occurring Josephson junction array. At low temperatures, giant Shapiro steps emerge, exhibiting characteristics of a single Josephson junction. Coherent phase locking across the array's multiple junctions amplifies the quantized voltage, enabling tunability at radio frequencies, as observed in artificially designed Josephson arrays. We show that our system can be tuned from a coherent superconducting (stiff-phase) to an insulating (phase-fluctuating) state using RF power. We propose that the RF power modulates the Josephson coupling energy, $E_J$. Remarkably, at elevated temperatures, the screening of the electron charge suppresses the charging energy, causing superconductivity to reappear. This many-body effect cannot be described within a single junction framework and involves many-body correlations. Our system can therefore be tuned to observe both the single-junction regime and many-body correlation effects, serving as a quantum simulator for complex phenomena in condensed matter physics.

Title: Cryogenic performance of field-effect transistors and amplifiers based on selective area grown InAs nanowires
Authors: Giulia Meucci, Dags Olšteins, Damon J. Carrad, Gunjan Nagda, Daria V. Beznasyuk, Christian E. N. Petersen, Sara Martí-Sánchez, Jordi Arbiol, Thomas Sand Jespersen
Abstract: Indium-Arsenide (InAs) nanowire field-effect transistors (NWFETs) are promising platforms for high-speed, low power nanoelectronics operating at cryogenic conditions, relevant for quantum information processing. We present selective area growth (SAG) of nanowires, which enable scalability and planar geometries that are compatible with standard semiconductor processing techniques. NWFETs are fabricated and their low temperature characteristics - including ION/IOFF ratios, threshold voltages, sub-threshold slope, interfacial trap density, hysteresis, and mobility - are characterized. The NWFETs operate successfully in integrated circuitry relying on saturation-mode operation. In sub-threshold applications such as amplifiers, we find bandwidths exceeding our cryostat wiring, but the gate hysteresis presents challenges for precise tuning of the amplifier operating point. We discuss the role of crystal imperfections and fabrication processes on the transistor characteristics and propose strategies for further improvements.

Title: Magnetization Dynamics in Quasiperiodic Magnonic Crystals
Authors: Riya Mehta, Bivas Rana, Susmita Saha
Abstract: Quasiperiodic magnonic crystals, in contrast to their periodic counterparts, lack strict periodicity which gives rise to complex and localised spin wave spectra characterized by numerous band gaps and fractal features. Despite their intrinsic structural complexity, quasiperiodic nature of these magnonic crystals enables better tunability of spin wave spectra over their periodic counterparts and therefore holds promise for the applications in reprogrammable magnonic devices. In this article, we provide an overview of magnetization reversal and precessional magnetization dynamics studied so far in various quasiperiodic magnonic crystals, illustrating how their quasiperiodic nature gives rise to tailored band structure, enabling unparalleled control over spin waves. The review is concluded by highlighting the possible potential applications of these quasiperiodic magnonic crystals, exploring potential avenues for future exploration followed by a brief summary.

Title: Domain Wall Engineering in Graphene-Based Josephson Junctions
Authors: Xia'an Du, Junjie Qi, Hua Jiang, X. C. Xie
Abstract: Recent progress has enabled the controlled fabrication of domain walls (DWs) in graphene, which host topological kink states. Meanwhile, reliable techniques for constructing graphene-based Joseph- son junctions have been established. While the experimental prerequisites for combining DWs with Josephson junctions are now available, this direction remains largely unexplored. In this work, we theoretically investigate transport properties in graphene-based Josephson junctions mediated by topological kink states and propose three DW engineering strategies. (i) DW number engineering uncovers a continuous evolution of critical current interference pattern from Aharonov-Bohm oscil- lation to Fraunhofer diffraction with increasing DW number, reproducing experimental observations [Barrier et al., Nature 628, 741 (2024)] and suggesting enhanced sensitivity for magnetometry ap- plications. (ii) DW symmetry engineering demonstrates that an asymmetric configuration of DWs under magnetic field yields an ideal Josephson diode characterized by pronounced nonreciprocal transport. (iii) DW geometry engineering reveals that intersecting DWs enable controllable super- current splitting with ratios among leads tunable through the intersection angle, magnetic field, and superconducting phase difference. Our findings elucidate the rich physics of DW-based Josephson junctions and establish a versatile platform for next-generation quantum devices.

Title: Wide Electrical Tunability of the Valley Splitting in a Doubly gated Silicon-on-Insulator Quantum Well
Authors: Nathan Aubergier, Vincent T. Renard, Sylvain Barraud, Kei Takashina, Benjamin A. Piot
Abstract: The valley splitting of 2D electrons in doubly-gated silicon-on-insulator quantum wells is studied by low temperature transport measurements under magnetic fields. At the buried thermal-oxide SiO$_{2}$ interface, the valley splitting increases as a function of the electrostatic bias $\delta n = n_{B}-n_{F}$ (where $n_{B}$ and $n_{F}$ are electron densities contributed by back and front gates, respectively) and reaches values as high as $6.3$~meV, independent of the total carrier concentration of the channel. We show that $\delta n$ tunes the square of the wave function modulus at the interface and its penetration into the barrier, both of which are key quantities in a theory describing interface-induced valley splitting, and is therefore the natural experimental parameter to manipulate valleys in 2D silicon systems. At the front interface, made of a thin ``high-k'' dielectric, a smaller valley splitting is observed, adding further options to tune the valley splitting within a single device.

Title: Electromagnetic responses of bilayer excitonic insulators
Authors: Yuelin Shao, Hao Shi, Xi Dai
Abstract: We investigate the electromagnetic responses of a bilayer excitonic insulators (EI) and identify two types of collective modes: (1) Two gapped plasmon modes couple to the layer symmetric gauge field. The transverse mode is nearly dispersionless in the long-wavelength limit, while the longitudinal mode, accounting for total charge fluctuations, has a linear dispersion with velocity proportional to two dimensional (2D) electrical polarizability. (2) A gapless phase (Goldstone) mode and a gapped amplitude mode, associated with the fluctuations of EI order parameter, couple to the layer antisymmetric gauge field. In the long-wavelength limit, the Goldstone mode exhibits linear dispersion with velocity inversely proportional to the square root of exciton compressibility, representing the first sound mode of the exciton condensate Significantly, its linear dispersion yields a cubic frequency dependence of the real admittance in microwave impedance microscopy (MIM), providing a method to detect the Goldstone mode directly.

Title: Classification of topological insulators and superconductors with multiple order-two point group symmetries
Authors: Ken Shiozaki
Abstract: We present a method for computing the classification groups of topological insulators and superconductors in the presence of $\mathbb{Z}_2^{\times n}$ point group symmetries, for arbitrary natural numbers $n$. Each symmetry class is characterized by four possible additional symmetry types for each generator of $\mathbb{Z}_2^{\times n}$, together with bit values encoding whether pairs of generators commute or anticommute. We show that the classification is fully determined by the number of momentum- and real-space variables flipped by each generator, as well as the number of variables simultaneously flipped by any pair of generators. As a concrete illustration, we provide the complete classification table for the case of $\mathbb{Z}_2^{\times 2}$ point group symmetry.

Title: Three prerequisites for high-temperature superconductivity in t-PtBi$_2$
Authors: Andrii Kuibarov, Susmita Changdar, Riccardo Vocaturo, Oleksandr Suvorov, Alexander Fedorov, Rui Lou, Maxim Krivenkov, Luminita Harnagea, Sabine Wurmehl, Jeroen van den Brink, Bernd Büchner, Sergey Borisenko
Abstract: Although the generic mechanism behind high-temperature superconductivity remains notoriously elusive, a set of favorable conditions for its occurrence in a given material has emerged: (i) the electronic structure should have a very high density of states near the Fermi level; (ii) electrons need to be susceptible to a sizable interaction with another degree of freedom to ensure pairing themselves; (iii) the ability to fine-tune some of the system properties significantly helps maximising the critical temperature. Here, by means of high-resolution ARPES, we show that all three criteria are remarkably fulfilled in trigonal platinum bismuthide (t-PtBi$_2$). Specifically, this happens on its surface, which hosts topological surface states known as Fermi arcs. Our findings pave the way for the stabilisation and optimisation of high-temperature superconductivity in this topological material.

Title: Impact of early-age exposure to power ultrasound on the micromechanical properties of hardened cement paste
Authors: Martin Chaigne, Sébastien Manneville, Michael Haist, Roland J.-M. Pellenq, Thibaut Divoux
Abstract: Cement paste serves as the universal binder in concrete, formed by mixing water with Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC). In its fresh state, cement paste is a suspension in which the initial particle inventory continuously dissolves, while simultaneously, a growing population of colloidal calcium silica-hydrate (C-S-H) particles forms and progressively builds a percolated structure that densifies and hardens through hydration. Like most colloidal gels, cement paste is sensitive to external stimuli such as mechanical vibrations and temperature variations. Here, we show that power ultrasound (PUS) applied to OPC paste during the very early stages of hydration significantly alters the mechanical properties of the hardened material. Freshly prepared cement pastes are exposed to PUS at varying durations and intensities before curing for 28 days. Micro-indentation testing at the scale of tens of microns reveals that increasing PUS amplitude and prolonged PUS exposure degrade the micro-mechanical properties of hardened cement paste, making it more ductile. This softening behavior evolves continuously with exposure conditions and is consistent with an increase in porosity, likely caused by micro-cracks induced by PUS. This scenario is further supported by micro-scratch testing, which shows higher levels of acoustic emission in PUS-exposed samples. Finally, nano-indentation confirms that the properties of the individual phases composing the hardened paste -- low-density and high-density C-S-H -- remain largely unaffected. These findings offer valuable experimental insights into novel pathways for modifying the mechanical properties of reactive colloidal gels.

Title: Mechanical performance of hybrid polymer-lipid vesicles with leaflet asymmetry engineered using microfluidics
Authors: Yuting Huang, Arash Manafirad, Simon Matoori, Laura R. Arriaga, Sijie Sun, Anqi Chen, Anthony D. Dinsmore, David J. Mooney, David A. Weitz
Abstract: Lipid vesicles consist of aqueous cores surrounded by a bilayer of phospholipids. Hybrid polymer-lipid vesicles incorporate both polymers and lipids, offering promising properties for developing pharmaceuticals, biosensors, and artificial cells. The hybrid vesicles can be symmetric, in which their two leaflets contain identical compositions, or asymmetric, in which the leaflets possess dissimilar compositions and can lead to dramatically modified properties. However, methods to produce both symmetric and asymmetric hybrid vesicles result in heterogenous compositions and sizes, making it challenging to quantify the effect of asymmetry and limiting applications. Here, we use a microfluidic approach to produce hybrid vesicles containing symmetric or asymmetric leaflets with precisely engineered compositions. We find the vesicles with asymmetric leaflets are significantly stiffer and tougher than those with symmetric leaflets; moreover, the lateral diffusivity of lipids is greatly decreased. The structure for improved toughness consists of an inner leaflet that is a stretchable lipid leaflet and an outer leaflet that is a fully continuous polymer leaflet. This technique of precisely engineering asymmetric structures may be applied to hybrid vesicles composed of block copolymers and phospholipids dissolvable in chloroform and hexane, further expanding their applications.

Title: A High-Throughput Search for Stable and Magnetically Robust Fe$_3$XY$_2$ Monolayers
Authors: Soheil Ershadrad, Biplab Sanyal
Abstract: We present first principles exploration of 529 Fe$_3$XY$_2$ compounds, where $X$ and $Y$ elements are selected from the $p$-block of the periodic table. Out of the entire set, 31 compounds satisfy all criteria for energetic, dynamic, mechanical, and thermal stability. Our analysis reveals several key trends: halide-containing systems exhibit the highest average magnetic moments and the highest magnetic transition temperatures, highlighting their potential for room-temperature spintronic applications. The majority of stable compounds display perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA), with Fe$_3$SiTe$_2$ exhibiting the strongest PMA among all candidates. Exchange interactions are found to be governed by a dual mechanism, direct exchange between nearest-neighbor Fe atoms and indirect, $p$-orbital-mediated exchange for second-nearest neighbors and beyond. Notably, four compounds have non-centrosymmetric crystal structures and exhibit finite spiralization constants. Among them, Fe$_3$AsBr$_2$ is predicted to host Néel-type skyrmions even at zero external magnetic field, as confirmed by micromagnetic simulations. These findings offer a roadmap for experimental realization of novel 2D ferromagnets with enhanced functionalities.

Title: Theoretical calculation of finite-temperature X-ray absorption fine structure: application to sodium K-edge in NaCl
Authors: Philipp Hönicke, Yves Kayser, Pouya Partovi-Azar
Abstract: We present a comprehensive computational framework for reproducing the full X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) through quantum-chemical simulations. The near-edge region is accurately captured using an efficient implementation of time-dependent density-functional perturbation theory applied to core excitations, while ab initio molecular dynamics provides essential sampling of core-excitation energies and interatomic distance distributions for interpreting extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) features. Owing to the efficiency of the approach, the total spectrum can be decomposed into contributions from bulk, defective, and surface environments, which commonly coexist in experimental systems. The methodology is demonstrated for sodium at the Na K-edge in NaCl, where the predicted spectra show good agreement with experimental measurements on thin film samples. This strategy offers a practical route to generating chemically specific XAFS cross-section data for elements and species that remain challenging to characterize experimentally, thereby enabling deeper insights into materials of technological importance.

Title: Probing Non-Fermi-Liquid Behaviour of Composite Fermi Liquid via Efficient Thermal Simulations
Authors: Bin-Bin Chen, Hongyu Lu, Zi Yang Meng
Abstract: The two-dimensional electron gas in a perpendicular magnetic field, i.e., the quantum Hall system, is remarkably rich. At half filling of the lowest Landau level, it has been predicted that ``composite fermions'' -- emergent quasiparticle of an electron with two magnetic flux quanta -- can experience zero net magnetic field and form a Fermi sea, dubbed composite Fermi liquid (CFL). However, the seemingly simple appearance of CFL is a strongly correlated quantum many-body state in disguise, and to solve it in a controlled manner is extremely difficult, to the level that the thermodynamic properties of CFL is still largely unknown. In this work, we perform state-of-the-art thermal tensor network simulations on the $\nu=1/2$ Landau level systems, and observe low-temperature power-law behaviour of the specific heat, signaling the gapless nature of CFL. More importantly, the power is extracted to be closed to $2/3$, clearly deviated from the ordinary linear-$T$ Fermi liquid behaviour, suggesting the coupling between the CFs and the dynamical emergent gauge field and therefore revealed the quantum many-body aspect of the CFL state. Relevance of our methodology to other quantum Hall settings and moiré systems is discussed.

Title: Dual Cross-Linked Hydrogels: Linear Rheology and Fractional Calculus Modeling
Authors: Agniva Dutta, Valeriy V. Ginzburg, Gleb Vasilyev, Eyal Zussman
Abstract: Hydrogels are increasingly recognized as a versatile platform for applications spanning from tissue engineering to soft robotics or flexible electronics. Recent efforts have focused on enhancing and tailoring their mechanical performance to meet application-specific demands. However, the intricate viscoelastic response of hydrogels remains challenging to capture using conventional phenomenological models. In this study, we prepared a series of tough dual crosslinked hydrogels -- poly(methacrylamide-co-acrylic acid)-Fe3+ and systematically tuned their mechanical properties by leveraging the salting-out effect. The viscoelastic behavior of the hydrogels was characterized under shear deformations, and a four-parameter Fractional Maxwell Model (FMM) was constructed to quantitatively describe oscillatory shear, creep, and stress relaxation responses. The influence of salt concentration on each FMM parameter was analyzed and correlated with bulk mechanical performance. This framework provides a first step toward capturing the complex viscoelastic nature of the advanced hydrogels and lays the foundation for developing more comprehensive nonlinear constitutive models.

Title: Non-Ferroelectric to Ferroelectric Phase Transition in epitaxial Y:HfO$_2$ via Rapid Thermal Annealing Induced Nitrogen Doping
Authors: Soumyajyoti Mondal, Asraful Haque, Binoy Krishna De, Shubham Kumar Parate, Pramod Kumar Yadav, Arup Basak, Kaushal Tiwari, Bhagwati Prasad, Pavan Nukala
Abstract: Oxygen vacancies are often essential for stabilizing the orthorhombic ferroelectric phase in HfO$_2$, with cationic doping widely employed to introduce such defects. In contrast, systematic studies on anionic doping to induce ferroelectricity remain largely in nascent stages. On epitaxial Y:HfO$_2$ grown on ITO buffered YSZ substrates that crystallize in a mixed monoclinic (non-polar) and orthorhombic (polar) phases, we introduce nitrogen doping via post deposition rapid thermal annealing (RTA) in N$_2$ atmosphere at 900~$^\circ$C. As the annealing time increases from 10s to 4min, the monoclinic phase fraction diminishes, enabling the emergence of well-defined ferroelectric loops in films annealed beyond 2~min. We clearly show that this is an effect of nitrogen incorporation (doping) into the samples through a suite of structure-property correlation measurements including x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. These results reveal that nitrogen actively participates in the RTA-induced phase stabilization, enabling ferroelectricity in epitaxial Y:HfO$_2$ without sacrificing crystallographic coherence, providing a viable pathway for structure-property correlation studies and a model system to study opto-electronic devices integrated with ferroelectrics.

Title: Nanoscale Dipolar Fields in Artificial Spin Ice Probed by Scanning NV Magnetometry
Authors: Ephraim Spindler, Vinayak Shantaram Bhat, Elke Neu, Mathias Weiler, M. Benjamin Jungfleisch
Abstract: We investigate dipolar coupling fields in two square-lattice artificial spin ice (ASI) systems with different lattice constants using scanning probe microscopy based on a single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond. This technique offers unprecedented spatial resolution, operates under ambient condition, and provides quantitative stray field measurements, making it uniquely suited for studying nanoscale magnetic textures. Our approach combines fluorescence quenching imaging and continuous-wave optically detected magnetic resonance (cODMR). A comparison of the two ASI samples, which differ in their lattice constants of 1000 nm and 910 nm respectively, reveals differences in the appearance of ice-rule violations - deviations from the lowest energy configuration in ASI vertices. We attribute these variations to varying coupling strengths dictated by the lattice constant. From the cODMR data, we extract both axial and transverse components of the local magnetic field relative to the NV axis. Micromagnetic modeling of these measurements allows for an iterative determination of the external magnetic field orientation, the detection of subtle magnetization tilts induced by weak external fields (well below the nanomagnets' switching threshold), and an estimation of the effective saturation magnetization, thereby accounting for deviations in nanomagnet dimensions. These findings provide crucial insights into the tunable magnetic interactions in ASI, paving the way for the design of advanced magnonic and spintronic devices.

Title: Improving atomic force microscopy structure discovery via style-translation
Authors: Jie Huang, Niko Oinonen, Fabio Priante, Filippo Federici Canova, Lauri Kurki, Chen Xu, Adam S. Foster
Abstract: Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is a key tool for characterising nanoscale structures, with functionalised tips now offering detailed images of the atomic structure. In parallel, AFM simulations using the particle probe model provide a cost-effective approach for rapid AFM image generation. Using state-of-the-art machine learning models and substantial simulated datasets, properties such as molecular structure, electrostatic potential, and molecular graph can be predicted from AFM images. However, transferring model performance from simulated to experimental AFM images poses challenges due to the subtle variations in real experimental data compared to the seemingly flawless simulations. In this study, we explore style translation to augment simulated images and improve the predictive performance of machine learning models in surface property analysis. We reduce the style gap between simulated and experimental AFM images and demonstrate the method's effectiveness in enhancing structure discovery models through local structural property distribution comparisons. This research presents a novel approach to improving the efficiency of machine learning models in the absence of labelled experimental data.

Title: Diamagnetic Meissner response of odd-frequency superconducting pairing from quantum geometry
Authors: Ankita Bhattacharya, Annica M. Black-Schaffer
Abstract: We investigate the role of quantum geometry in the Meissner response for odd-frequency superconducting pairs in multiband systems. Odd-frequency pairing is traditionally associated with a paramagnetic Meissner response, which raises questions about the stability of the superconducting phase, especially in multiband systems where odd-frequency pairing is ubiquitous. Using analytical calculations in a general two-band, we show that the quantum geometric contribution to the Meissner response from odd-frequency pairs is always diamagnetic for its interband processes, while intraband processes always yield a paramagnetic response. With odd-frequency pairing itself generated by interband pairing, an overall diamagnetic response may often be anticipated. We confirm these results with numerical calculations of models with both flat and dispersive bands. In flat band systems, where geometric effects dominate, the diamagnetic odd-frequency response can even exceed the even-frequency contribution, making odd-frequency pairs the primary source of the diamagnetic Meissner response. In a dispersive two-band system with finite quantum geometry, we similarly find a robust diamagnetic contribution from odd-frequency pairing, even when the total response turns paramagnetic due to even-frequency contributions. These results establish that quantum geometry stabilizes odd-frequency superconductivity and also identify flat-band materials as candidates for realizing odd-frequency superconductivity with a diamagnetic Meissner effect.

Title: Intricacies of Frustrated Magnetism in the Kondo Metal YbAgGe

Abstract: The combination of localized magnetic moments, their frustration and interaction with itinerant electrons is a key challenge of condensed matter physics. Frustrated magnetic interactions promote degenerate ground states with enhanced fluctuations, a topic that is predominantly studied in magnetic insulators. The coupling between itinerant and localized electrons in metals add complexity to the problem, and presently formulated only for extreme cases in which the itinerant electrons mediate exchange between localized spins (RKKY interaction) or suppress the formation of magnetic moments (Kondo screening). Here, we report an in-depth experimental study of the distorted Kagome metal YbAgGe, unravelling the open questions of how frustration, localized magnetism and itinerant electrons are intertwined in frustrated Kondo metals. We find that coupled itinerant and localized electrons give rise to dynamic magnetic correlations below T* ~ 20 K. At lower temperature, frustrated magnetic interactions establish anisotropic magnetic short-range correlations that culminate into antiferromagnetic long-range order below TN = 0.68 K with a significantly reduced modulated magnetic moment. We show that local moment Hamiltonians can yield limited understanding of the microscopic behaviour in frustrated metals, and prompt the extension of more sophisticated model Hamiltonians incorporating itinerant effects.

Title: Unconventional Electromechanical Response in Ferrocene Assisted Gold Atomic Chain
Authors: Biswajit Pabi, Štěpán Marek, Tal Klein, Arunabha Thakur, Richard Korytár, Atindra Nath Pal
Abstract: Atomically thin metallic chains serve as pivotal systems for studying quantum transport, with their conductance strongly linked to the orbital picture. Here, we report a non-monotonic electro-mechanical response in a gold-ferrocene junction, characterized by an unexpected conductance increase over a factor of ten upon stretching. This response is detected in the formation of ferrocene-assisted atomic gold chain in a mechanically controllable break junction at a cryogenic temperature. DFT based calculations show that tilting of molecules inside the chain modifies the orbital overlap and the transmission spectra, leading to such non-monotonic conductance evolution with stretching. This behavior, unlike typical flat conductance plateaus observed in metal atomic chains, pinpoints the unique role of conformational rearrangements during chain elongation. Our findings provide a deeper understanding of the role of orbital hybridization in transport properties and offer new opportunities for designing nanoscale devices with tailored electro-mechanical characteristics.

Title: Transforming tubular packings to bicontinuous surfaces
Authors: Vira Raichenko, Alicja Bukat, Michal Bykowski, Lucja Kowalewska, Myfanwy E. Evans
Abstract: The link between bicontinuous architectures in biological membranes and triply-periodic minimal surfaces (TPMS) is a well established example of stunning geometric form in nature. The prolamellar body (PLB) in early plant plastid development is a classic example, forming the Diamond TPMS in a lipid-protein-pigment membrane. However, the early development of such spectacular geometric structures is poorly understood. Inspired by the presence of tubules in the micrographs of early plastid membrane formation, we explore here geometric modelling of transformations of packings of cylinders that coalesce together to form bicontinuous structures. Using computational modelling, we find that specific cylinder packings with cubic symmetry transform into highly symmetric TPMS, which now stand as a candidate set of surfaces for further investigation into the PLB, as well as other occurrences of bicontinuous membranes.

Title: Dynamic structure factor of quantum hard rods from exact form-factors
Authors: Stanisław Kiedrzyński, Emilia Witkowska, Miłosz Panfil
Abstract: We study the quantum hard-rods model and obtain compact analytical expressions for density form factors, and a semi-analytical treatment for dynamic and static structure factors calculations, greatly reducing computational complexity. We identify conditions under which these form factors vanish and analyze real-space correlations, confirming the model's Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid behavior. The results reveal universal features of low energy physics of gapless quantum fluid and relation to Luttinger liquid theory, providing precise benchmarks for numerical simulations. This work establishes quantum hard rods as an important testbed for theories of strongly correlated one-dimensional systems.

Title: Permeability heterogeneity and bulk linear elasticity determine interfacial pattern morphologies during confined, miscible displacements of clay suspensions
Authors: Vaibhav Raj Singh Parmar, Ranjini Bandyopadhyay
Abstract: When a less viscous Newtonian fluid displaces an aging aqueous clay suspension in a confined space, a rich array of interfacial patterns emerges due to a predominantly viscous instability. In the present work, we controlled the mechanical properties of clay suspensions by incorporating additives and studied the interfacial instabilities that resulted when these suspensions were radially displaced by water in a Hele-Shaw cell. When the elasticity of clay was low, the interfacial dynamics exhibited features of nonlinear viscous fingering in heterogeneous media. By tuning the nature and content of additives that delay clay aging, we uncovered two novel propagation mechanisms: pattern growth via skewering and zig-zag finger propagation. These patterns have hitherto never been observed in experiments with colloidal systems. For moderate clay elasticities, we demonstrate here that shear-thinning-induced flow anisotropy leads to the formation of dendrites with dominant side branches. As clay elasticity increases due to the incorporation of salts, the energy required to create fractures becomes smaller than that for system-wide yielding. This scenario is characterized by the emergence of viscoelastic fractures. Our work demonstrates that incorporating additives is an effective strategy to manipulate the onset and growth of interfacial instabilities during the confined displacement of clay by miscible Newtonian fluids.

Title: Transient Dynamical Phase Diagram of the Spin-Boson Model at Finite Temperature
Authors: Olga Goulko, Hsing-Ta Chen, Moshe Goldstein, Guy Cohen
Abstract: We present numerically exact inchworm quantum Monte Carlo results for the real-time dynamics of the spin polarization in the sub-Ohmic spin--boson model at finite temperature. We focus in particular on the localization and coherence behavior of the model, extending our previous study at low temperature [Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 056502 (2025)]. As the temperature increases, the system becomes less localized and less coherent. The loss of coherence, which is controlled by two independent mechanisms -- a smooth damping-driven crossover and a sharp frequency-driven transition -- exhibits a nontrivial temperature dependence. While both types of coherence loss occur at lower coupling in the high temperature regime, the frequency exhibits a sharper drop at high temperatures and this drop is observed for all values of the sub-Ohmic exponent, in contrast to the zero-temperature case. We discuss the full temperature-dependent dynamical phase diagram of the system and the interplay between coherence and localization across a wide range of physical parameters.

Title: Van der Waals Density Functional for Molecular Crystals
Authors: Trevor Jenkins, Kristian Berland, Timo Thonhauser
Abstract: Since the development of the nonlocal correlation functional vdW-DF, the family of van der Waals density functionals has grown to better describe a wide variety of systems. A recent generation of the vdW-DF family, vdW-DF3, featured a newly-constructed form of the nonlocal correlation that more accurately modeled molecular dimers, layered structures, and surface adsorption. However, it also revealed an intrinsic tradeoff in vdW-DF3's parametrization and inflexibility of exchange in the generalized gradient approximation (GGA), limiting its accuracy for molecular crystals. In this paper we propose a new optimization of vdW-DF3 that is tailored to 3D molecular crystals. This functional, called vdW-DF3-mc, contains a new, tunable form of the exchange enhancement factor with parameters that directly correspond to physically relevant qualities. In addition, within the nonlocal correlation, we prioritize smoothness of the kernel switching function as a means of restoring flexibility to vdW-DF3's design. Testing vdW-DF3-mc on several benchmark sets, we achieve highly accurate energetics and geometries for molecular crystals. This is particularly evident for the case of polymorphs of ice, for which errors in the volume and cohesive energy are on the order of only 1%, indicating very promising performance for important subcategories of molecular crystals, such as polymorphism and hydrogen-bonded solids.

Abstract: The nature of relativistic electrons in solids depends on the precise shape of the underlying band structure. Prominently, symmetry-related mechanisms, such as the breaking of time reversal symmetry in topological insulators, can lead to the emergence of band gaps on small energy scales. It is, thus, important to quantify potential gaps of the Dirac cone with meV precision. Yet established band structure measurements are often challenged by their strict surface sensitivity or limited energy resolution. In this work, we use broadband, time-resolved THz magneto-spectroscopy to access the band structure of Dirac electrons in a buried HgTe quantum well by contact-free, all-optical measurements. Optical doping allows us to control the Fermi level without applying any electrical gate voltages. The background-free measurement of the cyclotron resonance of the Dirac system over 2.5 optical octaves, a broad range of magnetic field strengths, and different Fermi energies allows us to reconstruct the band structure near the Dirac point with sub-meV precision, and to observe a crossover of Landau quantization from a quasi-classical to the relativistic regime.

Title: Magnetic Worms: Oscillatory Bimeron Pairing And Collective Transport In Patterned Stripes
Authors: Jose Toledo-Marin, Mario Castro, David Galvez-Poblete, Bruno Grossi, Sebastián Castillo-Sepúlveda, Alvaro S. Nunez, Sebastian Allende
Abstract: Magnetic bimerons in a domain wall provide a practical route for current driven transport in patterned magnetic stripes. However, coupling between bimerons and pinning by defects complicate reliable motion. Here we show that a periodic array of edge defects both stabilizes transport of multiple bimerons and gives rise to a distinctive collective state, the magnetic worm. A single bimeron travels at constant speed; defects lower this speed while preserving an approximately linear relation between velocity $v$ and current density $J$. With two bimerons, the center of mass advances nearly uniformly while their separation exhibits a bounded oscillation whose frequency increases and amplitude decreases with current. For larger trains, these oscillations lose synchrony, producing segmented, worm like motion. The center of mass speed grows with current but decreases as the number of bimerons increases. Notably, eight bimerons cannot be sustained in a smooth stripe but can be stabilized by the periodic defects

Title: Self-propulsive active nematics
Authors: Niels de Graaf Sousa, Simon Guldager Andersen, Aleksandra Ardaševa, Amin Doostmohammadi
Abstract: Increasing evidence suggests that active matter exhibits instances of mixed symmetry that cannot be fully described by either polar or nematic formalism. Here, we introduce a minimal model that integrates self-propulsion into the active nematic framework. Our linear stability analyses reveal how self-propulsion shifts the onset of instability, fundamentally altering the dynamical landscape. Numerical simulations confirm these predictions, showing that self-propulsion induces anti-hyperuniform fluctuations, anomalous long-range order in vorticity, and non-universal self-similar energy cascades. Notably, these long-range ordered states emerge within the active turbulence regime well before the transition to a flocking state. Additionally, our analyses highlight a non-monotonic dependence of self-organization on self-propulsion, with optimal states characterized by a peak in correlation length. These findings are relevant for understanding of active nematic systems that self-propel, such as migrating cell layers or swarming bacteria, and offer new avenues for designing synthetic systems with tailored collective behaviours, bridging the gap between active nematics and self-propulsive systems.

Title: Revisiting the diffusion equation derivation in Persson's theory of contact
Authors: Yang Xu, Siyuan Yang, Yunong Zhou, Liang Luo
Abstract: In Persson's seminal work on tire-road interaction (Persson, J. Chem. Phys. {\bf 115}(8), 2001), he ingeniously derived a diffusion equation in Appendix B to characterize the evolution of contact pressure between a rigid rough indenter and an elastic half-space with spatial magnification, which constitutes the foundation of Persson's theory of contact. Persson's theory has been extensively validated and applied to investigate nearly all critical aspects of tribological problems. In contrast to the well-known Greenwood-Williamson (GW) model, Persson's theory receives relatively less attention within the tribology community. One contributing factor to this discrepancy is that the original derivation of the diffusion equation in Appendix B is not easily understandable to non-physicists. In this technical note, the authors provide supplementary information for each step of the derivation, aiming to clarify the conceptual foundation for researchers who encounter difficulties in understanding Persson's theory, thereby encouraging its broader application within and beyond tribology.

Title: Hybrid quantum-classical systems: statistics, entropy, microcanonical ensemble and its connection to the canonical ensemble
Authors: J.L. Alonso, C. Bouthelier-Madre, A. Castro, J. Clemente-Gallardo, J. A. Jover-Galtier
Abstract: We describe in detail a mathematical framework in which statistical ensembles of hybrid classical- quantum systems can be properly described. We show how a maximum entropy principle can be applied to derive the microcanonical ensemble of hybrid systems. We investigate its properties, and in particular how the microcanonical ensemble and its marginal classical and quantum ensembles can be defined for arbitrarily small range of energies for the whole system. We show how, in this situations, the ensembles are well defined for a continuum of energy values, unlike the purely quantum microcanonical ensemble, thus proving that hybrid systems translate properties of classical systems to the quantum realm. We also analyze the relation with the hybrid canonical ensemble by considering the microcanonical ensemble of a compound system composed of a hybrid subsystem weakly coupled to a reservoir and computing the marginal ensemble of the hybrid subsystem. Lastly, we apply the theory to the statistics of a toy model, which gives some insight on the different properties presented along the article.

Title: Pressure-Induced Mechanical Instabilities in Cubic SiC: Structural and Electronic Properties
Authors: Carlos P. Herrero, Eduardo R. Hernandez, Gabriela Herrero-Saboya, Rafael Ramirez
Abstract: Silicon carbide is widely used in electronics, ceramics, and renewable energy due to its exceptional hardness and resistance. In this study, we investigate the effects of hydrostatic and uniaxial pressure (both compressive and tensile) on the structural and electronic properties of $3C$-SiC. Our analysis is based on atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using an efficient tight-binding Hamiltonian, whose accuracy is validated against density functional theory calculations. Moreover, to account for nuclear quantum effects, we employ path-integral MD simulations. Our results show significant changes in the direct electronic gap as a function of temperature and pressure, with a renormalization of about 80 meV due to zero-point motion. Under hydrostatic tensile pressure, the direct band gap $E_{\Gamma}$ vanishes at the material's mechanical stability limit (spinodal point, where the bulk modulus $B \to 0$). For uniaxial pressure, we observe instabilities (Young's modulus $Y \to 0$) at approximately 90 GPa for both tension and compression, where $E_{\Gamma} \to 0$. Additionally, we analyze the pressure dependence of the internal energy, lattice parameter, and bond length, along with their finite-temperature fluctuations, which exhibit anomalies near the instability points.

Title: Experimental electronic structure of the mineral superconductor covellite CuS
Authors: Alexandre Antezak, Takemi Kato, Pedro Rezende Gonçalves, Franck Fortuna, Marcin Rosmus, Natalia Olszowska, Andrés Felipe Santander-Syro, Emmanouil Frantzeskakis
Abstract: Covellite (CuS) is the first known natural mineral superconductor. Despite its simple chemical formula, covellite exhibits a rich crystal structure at the origin of several remarkable properties. The ionic arrangement in CuS crystals leads to a mixed valence of Cu and a second-order structural transition at 55 K. Despite the abundance of structural studies and theoretical reports on its electronic structure, there are scarce references on its experimental band structure. By means of Angle Resolved PhotoEmission Spectroscopy (ARPES), we have probed the experimental electronic structure of covellite. We compare our results with the predictions of density-functional theory (DFT) calculations. Our experimental data are in remarkable agreement with the calculations, revealing subtle fingerprints of the structural phase transition, and confirming the quasi-2D nature of the electronic structure of CuS.

Title: Signatures of three-state Potts nematicity in spin excitations of the van der Waals antiferromagnet FePSe$_3$
Authors: Weiliang Yao, Viviane Peçanha Antonio, Devashibhai Adroja, S. J. Gomez Alvarado, Bin Gao, Sijie Xu, Ruixian Liu, Xingye Lu, Pengcheng Dai
Abstract: In two-dimensional (2D) nearly square-lattice quantum materials, electron correlations can induce an electronic nematic phase with twofold rotational ($C_2$) symmetry that profoundly impacts their properties. For 2D materials with threefold rotational ($C_3$) symmetry, such as the honeycomb lattice, a vestigial three-state Potts nematic order has been observed in the van der Waals antiferromagnet (AFM) FePSe$_3$ via optical and thermodynamic methods under uniaxial strain. Here, we use neutron scattering to study the magnetic order and spin excitations of FePSe$_3$ under uniaxial strain. In the AFM ordered state, we find that $\sim$0.6% tensile strain significantly suppresses one zigzag domain and promotes the other two, lowering the AFM order and spin waves to $C_2$ symmetry. The broken $C_3$ symmetry in spin excitations persists slightly above $T_{\rm{N}}\approx 108.6$ K, where the zigzag AFM order is absent. Our results thus provide direct evidence of magnetoelastic coupling and suggest that the three-state Potts nematicity in paramagnetic spin excitations arises from the vestigial order associated with the low-temperature zigzag AFM order.

Title: Medium-range structural order in amorphous arsenic
Authors: Yuanbin Liu, Yuxing Zhou, Richard Ademuwagun, Luc Walterbos, Janine George, Stephen R. Elliott, Volker L. Deringer
Abstract: Medium-range order (MRO) is a key structural feature of amorphous materials, but its origin and nature remain elusive. Here, we reveal the MRO in amorphous arsenic (a-As) using advanced atomistic simulations, based on machine-learned potentials derived using automated workflows. Our simulations accurately reproduce the experimental structure factor of a-As, especially the first sharp diffraction peak (FSDP), which is a signature of MRO. We compare and contrast the structure of a-As with that of its lighter homologue, red amorphous phosphorus (a-P), identifying the dihedral-angle distribution as a key factor differentiating the MRO in both. The pressure-dependent structural behaviors of a-As and a-P differ as well, which we link to the interplay of ring topology and structural entropy. We finally show that the origin of the FSDP is closely correlated with the size and spatial distribution of voids in the amorphous networks. Our work provides fundamental insights into MRO in an amorphous elemental system, and more widely it illustrates the usefulness of automation for machine-learning-driven atomistic simulations.

Title: General structure factor and dynamic effects of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in S = 1/2 clusters
Authors: Evan M. Wilson, Joseph A. Prescott, Jason T. Haraldsen
Abstract: Understanding the effects of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) has become increasingly important in the context of nanoscale magnetism and spintronics. In this study, we derive a general structure factor equation for an S = 1/2 dimer and show that the anisotropic ratio $D_z/|J|$ and complex phase $\phi$ of the DMI control the gap energy and intensity of the $|0,0\rangle \to |1,0\rangle$ transition. {Using exact diagonalization of the Heisenberg spin-spin Hamiltonian that incorporates both isotropic and anisotropic interactions,} as well as the effects of an external magnetic field and an electric field. Our results show that the DM interaction splits energy eigenstates, induces level repulsion, and significantly modifies the spin dimer structure factor. These effects reveal a direct correspondence between thermodynamic anomalies in the heat capacity and spin-resolved selection rules.

Title: Enhanced Terahertz Thermoelectricity via Engineered van Hove Singularities and Nernst Effect in Moiré Superlattices
Authors: L. Elesin, A. L. Shilov, S. Jana, I. Mazurenko, P. A. Pantaleon, M. Kashchenko, N. Krivovichev, V. Dremov, I. Gayduchenko, G. Goltsman, T. Taniguchi, K. Watanabe, Y. Wang, E. I. Titova, D. A. Svintsov, K. S. Novoselov, D. A. Bandurin
Abstract: Thermoelectric materials, long explored for energy harvesting and thermal sensing, convert heat directly into electrical signals. Extending their application to the terahertz (THz) frequency range opens opportunities for low-noise, bias-free THz detection, yet conventional thermoelectrics lack the sensitivity required for practical devices. Thermoelectric coefficients can be strongly enhanced near van Hove singularities (VHS), though these are usually difficult to access in conventional materials. Here we show that moiré band engineering unlocks these singularities for THz optoelectronics. Using 2D moiré structures as a model system, we observe strong enhancement of the THz photothermoelectric response in monolayer and bilayer graphene superlattices when the Fermi level is tuned to band singularities. Applying a relatively small magnetic field further boosts the response through the THz-driven Nernst effect, a transverse thermoelectric current driven by the THz-induced temperature gradient. Our results establish moiré superlattices as a versatile platform for THz thermoelectricity and highlight engineered band structures as a route to high-performance THz optoelectronic devices.

Title: Interaction-limited conductivity of twisted bilayer graphene revealed by giant terahertz photoresistance
Authors: A. L. Shilov, M. Kravtsov, J. Covey, M. A. Kashchenko, O. Popova, X. Zhou, I. Yahniuk, T. Taniguchi, K. Watanabe, A. I. Berdyugin, Y. Wang, S. D. Ganichev, V. Perebeinos, D. A. Svintsov, A. Principi, K. S. Novoselov, D. L. Maslov, D. A. Bandurin
Abstract: Identifying the microscopic processes that limit conductivity is essential for understanding correlated and quantum-critical states in quantum materials. In twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) and other twist-controlled materials, the temperature dependence of metallic resistivity follows power-law scaling, with the exponent spanning a broad range, rendering standard transport measurements insufficient to unambiguously identify the dominant scattering processes and giving rise to competing interpretations ranging from phonon-limited transport and umklapp scattering to strange metallicity and heavy fermion renormalization. Here, we use terahertz (THz) excitation to selectively raise the electron temperature in TBG while keeping the lattice cold, enabling a direct separation of electron-electron and electron-phonon contributions to resistivity. We observe a giant THz photoresistance, reaching up to 70% in magic-angle devices, demonstrating that electronic interactions dominate transport even in regimes previously attributed to phonons, including the linear-in-temperature resistivity near the magic angle. Away from the magic angle, we observe coexisting photoresistance and robust quadratic-in-temperature resistivity at extremely low carrier densities where standard electron-electron scattering mechanisms (umklapp and Baber inter-band scattering) are kinematically forbidden. Our analysis identifies the breakdown of Galilean invariance in the Dirac-type dispersion as a possible origin of the interaction-limited conductivity, arising from inter-valley electron-electron collisions. Beyond twisted bilayer graphene, our approach establishes THz-driven hot-electron transport as a general framework for disentangling scattering mechanisms in low-density quantum materials.

Title: Floquet multiple exceptional points with higher-order skin effect
Authors: Gaurab Kumar Dash, Subhendu Kumar Patra, Diptiman Sen, Manisha Thakurathi
Abstract: We investigate the rich non-equilibrium physics arising in periodically driven open quantum systems, specifically those realized within microcavity resonators, whose dynamics are governed by a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian hosting Floquet Exceptional Points (FEPs). By introducing a periodically quenched driving protocol, we analytically derive the Floquet effective Hamiltonian and determine the locations of multiple FEPs harbored within the Floquet bulk bands. We demonstrate that the pair-production and annihilation of these FEPs can be precisely controlled by fine-tuning the system parameters, and zero and $\pi$ FEPs are topologically characterized by robust integer quantized winding numbers. To probe these singularities, we introduce a bi-orthogonal Floquet fidelity susceptibility, whose value exhibits large non-zero peaks at the momentum points hosting FEPs in the Brillouin zone. Furthermore, the momentum-summed susceptibility displays a sharp divergence when the number of FEPs change with respect to the time period of the drive. Our findings also reveal the emergence of Floquet edge states around zero energy and Dirac-like dispersion around $\pi$. Moreover, our model reveals a higher-order skin effect, where the periodically driven Hamiltonian hosts skin modes localized at both edges and corners. These insights offer novel avenues for the Floquet engineering of topological singularities in driven dissipative systems, with significant potential for manipulating light and matter at the microscale.

Title: Stress Analysis of a Square Elastic Body Under Biaxial Loading Using Airy Stress Functions
Authors: Ryu Suzuki, Shintaro Hokada, Satoshi Takada
Abstract: This study presents an analytical investigation of stress distributions in square-shaped elastic bodies subjected to concentrated compressive loads under uniaxial and biaxial conditions. By employing the Airy stress function method, we derive closed-form solutions that satisfy the governing biharmonic equation and the prescribed boundary conditions along the edges of the square domain. The stress components are expressed as series expansions, with coefficients determined to enforce boundary constraints. In the uniaxial compression case, the resulting stress fields exhibit strong agreement with photoelastic fringe patterns previously observed in experimental studies. For biaxial loading, the solution represents a superposition of two orthogonal compression scenarios, producing spatial variations in the principal stress difference depending on the location within the domain.

Abstract: Mössbauer spectroscopy is widely used in biochemistry, geology, and solid-state physics to obtain structural information on materials. Here, we extend this technique into the optical range using a vacuum ultraviolet laser to probe the low-energy nuclear transitions of thorium-229, doped in calcium fluoride crystals. We discover four distinct doping sites for the thorium ions, determine the characteristic electric field gradients emerging in the interaction with the host crystal, and identify the microscopic structure of the two dominant configurations. Site-selective laser excitation allows to study the isomeric state lifetime and laser-induced quenching for all sites. This laser-based Mössbauer spectroscopy provides a powerful probe of the nuclear environment, yielding foundational data for designing future solid-state nuclear clocks.

Title: Migration as a Probe: A Generalizable Benchmark Framework for Specialist vs. Generalist Machine-Learned Force Fields in Doped Materials
Authors: Yi Cao, Paulette Clancy
Abstract: Machine-learned force fields (MLFFs), particularly pre-trained foundation models, promise to bring ab initio-level accuracy to the length and time scales of molecular dynamics. Yet this shift raises a central question: is it better to build a specialist model from scratch or adapt a generalist foundation model for a specific system? The trade-offs in data efficiency, predictive accuracy, and risks of out-of-distribution (OOD) failure remain unclear. Here, we present a benchmarking framework that contrasts bespoke (from scratch) and fine-tuned foundation models in a test case of a technologically relevant 2D material, Cr-intercalated Sb2Te3, using the MACE architecture. Our framework employs migration pathways, evaluated through nudged elastic band (NEB) trajectories, as a diagnostic probe that tests both interpolation and extrapolation. We assess accuracy for equilibrium, kinetic (atomic migration), and mechanical (interlayer sliding) tasks. While all models capture equilibrium structures, predictions for non-equilibrium processes diverge. Task-specific fine-tuning substantially improves kinetic accuracy compared with both from-scratch and zero-shot models, but can degrade learned representations of long-range physics. Analysis of internal representations shows that training paradigms yield distinct, non-overlapping latent encodings of system physics. This work offers a practical guide for MLFF development, highlights migration-based probes as efficient diagnostics, and suggests pathways toward uncertainty-aware active learning strategies.

Title: Operating advanced scientific instruments with AI agents that learn on the job
Authors: Aikaterini Vriza, Michael H. Prince, Tao Zhou, Henry Chan, Mathew J. Cherukara
Abstract: Advanced scientific user facilities, such as next generation X-ray light sources and self-driving laboratories, are revolutionizing scientific discovery by automating routine tasks and enabling rapid experimentation and characterizations. However, these facilities must continuously evolve to support new experimental workflows, adapt to diverse user projects, and meet growing demands for more intricate instruments and experiments. This continuous development introduces significant operational complexity, necessitating a focus on usability, reproducibility, and intuitive human-instrument interaction. In this work, we explore the integration of agentic AI, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), as a transformative tool to achieve this goal. We present our approach to developing a human-in-the-loop pipeline for operating advanced instruments including an X-ray nanoprobe beamline and an autonomous robotic station dedicated to the design and characterization of materials. Specifically, we evaluate the potential of various LLMs as trainable scientific assistants for orchestrating complex, multi-task workflows, which also include multimodal data, optimizing their performance through optional human input and iterative learning. We demonstrate the ability of AI agents to bridge the gap between advanced automation and user-friendly operation, paving the way for more adaptable and intelligent scientific facilities.

Title: afspm: A Framework for Manufacturer-Agnostic Automation in Scanning Probe Microscopy
Authors: Nicholas J. Sullivan, Julio J. Valdés, Kirk H. Bevan, Peter Grutter
Abstract: Scanning probe microscopy (SPM) is a valuable technique by which one can investigate the physical characteristics of the surfaces of materials. However, its widespread use is hampered by the time-consuming nature of running an experiment and the significant domain knowledge required. Recent studies have shown the value of multiple forms of automation in improving this, but their use is limited due to the difficulty of integrating them with SPMs other than the one it was developed for. With this in mind, we propose an automation framework for SPMs aimed toward facilitating code sharing and reusability of developed components. Our framework defines generic control and data structure schemas which are passed among independent software processes (components), with the final SPM commands sent after passing through an SPM-specific translator. This approach permits multi-language support and allows for experimental components to be decoupled among multiple computers. Our mediation logic limits access to the SPM to a single component at a time, with a simple override mechanism in order to correct detected experiment problems. To validate our proposal, we integrated and tested it with two SPMs from separate manufacturers, and ran an experiment involving a thermal drift correction component.

Title: Strategies to search for two-dimensional materials with long spin qubit coherence time
Authors: Michael Y. Toriyama, Jiawei Zhan, Shun Kanai, Giulia Galli
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials that can host qubits with long spin coherence time (T2) have the distinct advantage of integrating easily with existing microelectronic and photonic platforms, making them attractive for designing novel quantum devices with enhanced performance. However, the relative lack of 2D materials as spin qubit hosts, as well as appropriate substrates that can help maintain long T2, necessitates a strategy to search for candidates with robust spin coherence. Here, we develop a high-throughput computational workflow to predict the nuclear spin bath-driven qubit decoherence and T2 in 2D materials and heterostructures. We initially screen 1173 2D materials and find 190 monolayers with T2 > 1 ms, higher than that of naturally-abundant diamond. We then construct 1554 lattice-commensurate heterostructures between high-T2 2D materials and select 3D substrates, and we find that T2 is generally lower in a heterostructure than in the bare 2D host material; however, low-noise substrates (such as CeO2 and CaO) can help maintain high T2. To further accelerate the material screening effort, we derive analytical models that enable rapid predictions of T2 for 2D materials and heterotructures. The models offer a simple, yet quantitative, way to determine the relative contributions to decoherence from the nuclear spin baths of the 2D host and substrate in a heterostructural system. By developing a high-throughput workflow and analytical models, we expand the genome of 2D materials and their spin coherence times for the development of spin qubit platforms.

Title: Hawking-Rényi thermodynamics of rotating black holes from locally Kiselev-type behavior
Authors: Viktor G. Czinner, Hideo Iguchi
Abstract: The Hawking-Rényi model requires the Rényi entropy thermodynamic temperature of a black hole to be identical with the surface gravity defined-, Hawking temperature. We investigate this approach for stationary black hole space-times, and show that a locally Kiselev-type behavior around the horizon with a coupled anisotropic fluid is sufficient to provide a solution to the problem. In addition, due to the rotating motion, an extra shift has also to be present in the effective mass of the black hole, which is determined by the rotation parameter, $a$, and the Rényi parameter, $\lambda$. We consider space-times with and without electric charge, and show that the functional form of the solution is the same for both cases. A full thermodynamic analysis of the model falls beyond the scope of this Letter, the main achievements are the derivation and interpretation of the solution.

Title: Insights into the Structure and Dynamics of Water at Co$_3$O$_4$(001) Using a High-Dimensional Neural Network Potential
Authors: Amir Omranpour, Jörg Behler
Abstract: Co$_3$O$_4$ is an important catalyst for the oxidation of organic molecules in the liquid phase. Still, understanding the atomistic details of Co$_3$O$_4$-water interfaces under operando conditions remains extremely challenging. While ab initio molecular dynamics have become an essential tool for investigating these dynamic interfaces in silico, they are limited to only a few picoseconds and a few hundred atoms. In this work, we overcome these limitations by training a high-dimensional neural network potential (HDNNP) on density functional theory data, which allows us to significantly extend the accessible time and length scales. Employing this HDNNP, we perform simulations to unravel the structure, dynamics, and reactivity of Co$_3$O$_4$(001)-water interfaces in detail. Our simulations reveal distinct characteristics of the two possible A and B terminations. The B-terminated surface stabilizes a compact, quasi-epitaxial hydration layer with strong templating effects, enhanced hydroxylation, and a well-organized hydrogen-bond network. In contrast, the A-termination forms a more diffuse contact layer with weaker templating, lower hydroxylation, and less ordered interfacial water. Extended simulations further uncover proton transfer pathways, including intermittent protonation of surface hydroxyls, migration of water molecules into the epitaxial layer, and rare hydronium-like configurations.

Title: Rectification of Vibrational Energy Transfer in Driven Chiral Molecules
Authors: Jichen Feng, Ethan D. Abraham, Joseph E. Subotnik, Abraham Nitzan
Abstract: We show that the combination of molecular chirality and phase controlled driving can lead to rectification of vibrational energy transfer. We demonstrate this effect using classical models of (1) a single helical chain and (2) a more realistic model of polyethylene double helix. We examine the effect of the driving frequency, polarization, and temperature on this phenomenon. Notably, we find that the direction and magnitude of the observed directionality preference depends on the driving frequency and phase, and that the effect persists at room temperature.

Title: Spectral analysis of Dirac materials in position-dependent magnetic and electric fields via Heun functions
Authors: Daniel O-Campa, Omar Pedraza, L. A. López, Erik Díaz-Bautista
Abstract: This work focuses on the study of the spectral problem for Dirac materials immersed in position-dependent magnetic and electric fields. To achieve this, the system of differential equations satisfied by the eigenfunction components of the Hamiltonian has been decoupled, and the solutions for some specific cases have been analyzed using Heun functions, which provide us with a quantization relation and allow us to determine the solutions for the bound states.

Title: Quantum States in Twisted Tubes with Linear Cross-Section Variation
Authors: Guo-Hua Liang, Ai-Guo Mei, Men-Yun Lai, Shu-Sheng Xu
Abstract: We study the quantum dynamics of a particle confined in a twisted tube with a linearly varying cross section. By relating a general linear transformation matrix to the system's Hamiltonian, we use an extended thin-layer method to derive an effective Hamiltonian for tangential motion under mild and general linear transformations. Explicit forms are provided for three fundamental transformations: rotation, scaling, and shearing. Rotation introduces a gauge field coupled to angular momentum, while scaling and shearing produce geometric potentials that lift degeneracies in non-circular cross sections. In square cross sections, these transformations cause energy splittings among formerly degenerate states, whereas circular cross sections retain degeneracy. Through an example combining rotation and squeezing, we analyze state evolution and compute the quantum geometric tensor to quantify geometric response. Our results demonstrate how geometric transformations can tailor quantum states and suggest that circular waveguides are more robust against mode mixing.

Title: The Group-IV-Vacancy Color Center in Diamond
Authors: Fenglei Gu
Abstract: Group-IV vacancy (G4V, or XV, where X = Si, Ge, Sn, Pb) color centers constitute a novel and promising class of defects in diamonds. This chapter reviews and refines the theoretical models for the XV systems, encompassing the intrinsic interactions, including spin-orbit coupling and electron-phonon interactions, and the external interactions involving strain, electric, light, and magnetic fields. Based on the refined model, we predict their properties, explain the experimental data, and suggest follow-up experiments. This article established a solid foundation for controlling the XV system, thus paving the way for quantum information processing.

Title: A Further Comparison of TD-DMRG and ML-MCTDH for Nonadiabatic Dynamics of Exciton Dissociation
Authors: Weitang Li, Jiajun Ren, Jun Yan
Abstract: Tensor network methods, such as time-dependent density matrix renormalization group (TD-DMRG) and multi-layer multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree (ML-MCTDH), are powerful tools for simulating quantum dynamics. While both methods are theoretically exact in the limit of large bond dimensions, a recent study reported up to 60% discrepancy in their calculations for exciton dissociation. To resolve this inconsistency, we conduct a systematic comparison using Renormalizer, a unified software framework for matrix product states (MPS) and tree tensor network states (TTNS). By revisiting the benchmark P3HT:PCBM heterojunction model, we show that the observed discrepancies arise primarily from insufficient bond dimensions. By increasing bond dimensions, we first reduce the difference to less than 10%. Further refinement using an extrapolation scheme and an optimized tensor network structure lowers the difference to approximately 2%. Our results confirm both methods converge to numerically exact solutions when bond dimensions are adequately scaled. This work not only validates the reliability of both methods but also provides high-accuracy benchmark data for future developments in quantum dynamics simulations.

Title: rhodent: A Python package for analyzing real-time TDDFT response
Authors: Jakub Fojt, Tuomas P. Rossi, Paul Erhart
Abstract: Real-time time-dependent density functional theory (rt-TDDFT) is a well-established method for studying the dynamic response of matter in the femtosecond or optical range. In this method, the Kohn-Sham (KS) wave functions are propagated forward in time, and in principle, one can extract any observable at any given time. Alternatively, by taking a Fourier transform, spectroscopic quantities can be extracted. There are many publicly available codes implementing rt-TDDFT, which differ in their numeric solution of the KS equations, their available exchange-correlation functionals, and in their analysis capabilities. For users of rt-TDDFT, this is an inconvenient situation because they may need to use a numerical method that is available in one code, but an analysis method available in another. Here, we introduce rhodent, a modular Python package for processing the output of rt-TDDFT calculations. Our package can be used to calculate hot-carrier distributions, energies, induced densities, and dipole moments, and various decompositions thereof. In its current version, rhodent handles calculation results from the gpaw code, but can readily be extended to support other rt-TDDFT codes. Additionally, under the assumption of linear response, rhodent can be used to calculate the response to a narrow-band laser, from the response to a broad-band perturbation, greatly speeding up the analysis of frequency-dependent excitations. We demonstrate the capabilities of rhodent via a set of examples, for systems consisting of Al and Ag clusters and organic molecules.

Title: Breakdown of the Kirchhoff's law of thermal radiation by a spatiotemporally modulated nonreciprocal metasurface
Authors: Anatoly Efimov, Chun-Chieh Chang, Simo Pajovic, Wilton J.M. Kort-Kamp, Dongsung Kim, Hou-Tong Chen, Diego A. R. Dalvit, Abul K. Azad
Abstract: Kirchhoff's law of thermal radiation, which dictates that the emissivity of a surface equals its absorptivity under thermal equilibrium, which dictates that the emissivity of a surface equals its absorptivity under thermal equilibrium, fundamentally limits the efficiency of photonic systems by enforcing reciprocal energy exchange between source and detector. Breaking this reciprocity is particularly important for advancing photonic devices for energy conversion, radiative cooling, and mid-infrared sensing and imaging. Driven by the growing need for photonic platforms to overcome reciprocity constraints, we present the first demonstration of spatiotemporally modulated nonreciprocal metasurfaces operating at mid-infrared frequencies suitable for the violation of the Kirchhoff's law at room temperature. We fabricate a graphene-based integrated photonic structure and experimentally demonstrate nonreciprocal reflection from a metasurface modulated at gigahertz frequencies. We develop a theoretical framework to relate nonreciprocal scattering under spatiotemporal modulation with unequal absorptivity and emissivity for violation of the spectral directional Kirchhoff's law. Our experiment and theory imply effective decoupling of absorption and emission channels by breaking time-reversal symmetry at thermal wavelengths.

Title: A noncommutative Ruelle's Theorem for a normalized potential taking values on positivity-improving operators
Authors: W. M. M.Braucks, A. O. Lopes
Abstract: Let \(\mathcal{A}\) be a finite-dimensional real (or complex) C*-algebra, \(\Omega_{A}\) an aperiodic subshift of finite type, and \(\mathcal{C}(\Omega_{A}; \mathcal{A})\) the set of continuous functions from \(\Omega_{A}\) to \(\mathcal{A}\). The shift $\sigma$ provides dynamics. Given a real Lipschitz potential $\varphi\in \mathcal{C}(\Omega_{A}; \mathfrak{L}(\mathcal{A}))$, where $\mathfrak{L}(\mathcal{A})$ is the set of linear operators acting on a real $\mathcal{A}$, we introduce a noncommutative analogue of Ruelle's operator, which acts on \(\mathcal{C}(\Omega_{A}; \mathcal{A})\). Assuming the positivity-improving hypothesis, we prove a version of Ruelle's Theorem whenever the operator is normalized. An eigenstate (a linear functional) invariant for the action of the noncommutative Ruelle's operator will play the role of the Gibbs probability of Thermodynamic Formalism; to be called a Gibbs eigenstate. We introduce the concept of entropy for a Gibbs eigenstate (obtained from a certain family of potentials $\varphi$) - generalizing the classical one. In our setting, there is currently no direct relationship with cocycles and Lyapunov exponents. We present examples illustrating the novelty of the cases that can be considered, ranging from topics related to quantum channels to Pauli matrices. Interesting cases: $\mathcal{A}=M_{N \times N}(\mathbb{R})$ and $\mathcal{A}= \mathbb{R}^{N}$.

Abstract: We study the spin-J Fermi gas, interacting through a general repulsive 2-body potential, and prove asymptotics of the ground state energy in the dilute limit. The asymptotic behaviour is given in terms of the ground state energy of a spin chain, which is the Heisenberg antiferromagnet in the case of spin-1/2 fermions.

Title: Genuine multi-entropy, dihedral invariants and Lifshitz theory
Authors: Clément Berthière, Paul Gaudin
Abstract: Multi-invariants are local unitary invariants of state replicas introduced as potential new probes of multipartite entanglement and correlations in quantum many-body systems. In this paper, we investigate two multi-invariants for tripartite pure states, namely multi-entropy and dihedral invariant. We compute the (genuine) multi-entropy for groundstates of Lifshitz theories, and obtain its analytical continuation to noninteger values of Rényi index. We show that the genuine multi-entropy can be expressed in terms of mutual information and logarithmic negativity. For general tripartite pure states, we demonstrate that dihedral invariants are directly related to Rényi reflected entropies. In particular, we show that the dihedral permutations of replicas are equivalent to the reflected construction, or alternatively to the realignment of density matrices.

Title: Quantum-group-invariant $D^{(2)}_{n+1}$ models: Bethe ansatz and finite-size spectrum
Authors: Holger Frahm, Sascha Gehrmann, Rafael I. Nepomechie, Ana L. Retore
Abstract: We consider the quantum integrable spin chain models associated with the Jimbo R-matrix based on the quantum affine algebra $D^{(2)}_{n+1}$, subject to quantum-group-invariant boundary conditions parameterized by two discrete variables $p=0,\dots, n$ and $\varepsilon = 0, 1$. We develop the analytical Bethe ansatz for the previously unexplored case $\varepsilon = 1$ with any $n$, and use it to investigate the effects of different boundary conditions on the finite-size spectrum of the quantum spin chain based on the rank-$2$ algebra $D^{(2)}_3$. Previous work on this model with periodic boundary conditions has shown that it is critical for the range of anisotropy parameters $0<\gamma<\pi/4$, where its scaling limit is described by a non-compact CFT with continuous degrees of freedom related to two copies of the 2D black hole sigma model. The scaling limit of the model with quantum-group-invariant boundary conditions depends on the parameter $\varepsilon$: similarly as in the rank-$1$ $D^{(2)}_2$ chain, we find that the symmetry of the lattice model is spontaneously broken, and the spectrum of conformal weights has both discrete and continuous components, for $\varepsilon=1$. For $p=1$, the latter coincides with that of the $D^{(2)}_2$ chain, which should correspond to a non-compact brane related to one black hole CFT in the presence of boundaries. For $\varepsilon=0$, the spectrum of conformal weights is purely discrete.

Title: Entropy Flow at the Quantum Limit
Authors: Marco A. Jimenez-Valencia, Parth Kumar, Yiheng Xu, Ferdinand Evers, Charles A. Stafford
Abstract: Thermal management is a key challenge, both globally and microscopically in integrated circuits and quantum technologies. The associated heat flow $I_Q$ has been understood since the advent of thermodynamics by a process of elimination, $I_Q{=}I_E{-}\mu I_N$, subtracting from the energy flow $I_E$ its convective contribution. However, in the quantum limit, this formula implies the paradoxical result that the entropy entrained by heat flow is unbounded even though the entropy itself tends to zero. We resolve this conundrum by recognizing that the traditional formula for heat is missing a quantum term. The correct quantum formula predicts that the heat produced in quantum processes is vastly smaller than previously believed, with correspondingly beneficial consequences for the efficiency of quantum machines.

Title: Vacuum currents in elliptic pseudosphere tubes
Authors: A. A. Saharian, G. V. Mirzoyan
Abstract: We examine the effects of spatial topology, curvature, and magnetic flux on the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the current density for a charged scalar field in (2+1)-dimensional spacetime. The elliptic pseudosphere is considered as an exactly solvable background geometry. The topological contribution is separated in the Hadamard function for general phases in the periodicity condition along the compact dimension. Two equivalent expressions are provided for the component of the current density in that direction. The corresponding VEV is a periodic function of the magnetic flux with a period equal to the flux quantum. In the flat spacetime limit, we recover the result for a conical space with a general value of the planar angle deficit. Near the origin of the elliptic pseudosphere, the effect of the spatial curvature on the vacuum current density is weak. The same applies for small values of the length of the compact dimension. Using the conformal relations between the elliptic pseudosphere and the (2+1)-dimensional de Sitter spacetime with a planar angle deficit, we determine the current densities for a conformally coupled massless scalar field in the static and hyperbolic vacuum states of locally de Sitter spacetime.

Title: Response function as a quantitative measure of consciousness in brain dynamics
Authors: Wenkang Du, Haiping Huang
Abstract: Understanding the neural correlates of consciousness remains a central challenge in neuroscience. In this study, we investigate the relationship between consciousness and neural responsiveness by analyzing intracranial ECoG recordings from non-human primates across three distinct states: wakefulness, anesthesia, and recovery. Using a nonequilibrium recurrent neural network (RNN) model, we fit state-dependent cortical dynamics to extract the neural response function as a dynamics complexity indicator. Our findings demonstrate that the amplitude of the neural response function serves as a robust dynamical indicator of conscious state, consistent with the role of a linear response function in statistical physics. Notably, this aligns with our previous theoretical results showing that the response function in RNNs peaks near the transition between ordered and chaotic regimes -- highlighting criticality as a potential principle for sustaining flexible and responsive cortical dynamics. Empirically, we find that during wakefulness, neural responsiveness is strong, widely distributed, and consistent with rich nonequilibrium fluctuations. Under anesthesia, response amplitudes are significantly suppressed, and the network dynamics become more chaotic, indicating a loss of dynamical sensitivity. During recovery, the neural response function is elevated, supporting the gradual re-establishment of flexible and responsive activity that parallels the restoration of conscious processing. Our work suggests that a robust, brain-state-dependent neural response function may be a necessary dynamical condition for consciousness, providing a principled framework for quantifying levels of consciousness in terms of nonequilibrium responsiveness in the brain.

Stefan Tautz, Sabine Wenzel
Abstract: On-surface synthesis has allowed for the tuneable preparation of numerous molecular systems with variable properties. Recently, we demonstrated the highly selective synthesis of kekulene (>99%) on Cu(111) and isokekulene (92%) on Cu(110) from the same molecular precursor (Ruan et al., Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2025, e202509932). Scanning tunneling microscopy with CO-functionalized tips can identify the single molecules on the basis of their geometric structure at a low coverage on Cu(110), but it also detects complex features due to electronic contributions close to the Fermi energy. Here, we investigate the origin of these features by simulating STM images based on a weighted sum of multiple molecular orbitals, for which we employ weights based on the calculated molecular-orbital projected density of states. This allows for an experimental confirmation of charge transfer from the surface into multiple formerly unoccupied molecular orbitals for single molecules of kekulene as well as isokekulene in its two nonplanar adsorption configurations. In comparison, the area-integrating photoemission orbital tomography technique confirms the charge transfer as well as the high selectivity for the formation of a full monolayer of mainly isokekulene on Cu(110). Our STM-based approach is applicable to a wide range of adsorbed molecular systems and specifically also suited for strongly interacting surfaces, nonplanar molecules, and such molecules which can only be prepared at extremely low yields.

Title: Aligning Reasoning LLMs for Materials Discovery with Physics-aware Rejection Sampling
Authors: Lee Hyun, Sohee Yoon, Jinwoo Park, Sue In Chae, Seongeon Park, Jooyeon Ahn, Yebin Jung, Youjung Chung, Hogeun Chang, Myeonginn Kang, Jina Kim, Ho-Gyeong Kim, Myeonghun Jeong
Abstract: AI-driven materials discovery that couples automated experimentation with algorithmic decision-making requires process aware recipe to property predictors that are accurate, calibrated, and physically admissible. We approach this as a reasoning problem with large reasoning models (LRMs). To instill reasoning capability into language models, we curate reasoning traces from a teacher model to train a student model. However, most training pipelines select reasoning traces using binary correctness or learned preference signals that poorly reflect physical admissibility. We introduce Physics-aware Rejection Sampling (PaRS), a training-time trace selection scheme that favors traces consistent with fundamental physics and numerically close to targets, with lightweight halting to control compute. We instantiate our framework with a large student model fine-tuned on traces synthesized by a larger teacher model, and evaluate under matched token budgets against various rejection sampling baselines. Our method improves accuracy and calibration, reduces physics-violation rates, and lowers sampling cost relative to baselines. These results indicate that modest, domain-aware constraints combined with trace-level selection provide a practical path toward reliable, efficient LRMs for process-aware property prediction and closed-loop materials design.

Title: Band Geometry Induced Third-Harmonic Generation
Authors: Sanjay Sarkar, Debottam Mandal, Amit Agarwal
Abstract: Third-harmonic generation (THG) is a key nonlinear optical process for ultrafast imaging, terahertz (THz) signal generation, and symmetry-sensitive probes, often dominating in centrosymmetric materials where lower-order responses vanish. Yet, the role of band geometry, Fermi surface effects, and disorder in enabling large and tunable THG remains poorly understood. Here, we develop a finite-frequency quantum kinetic theory of THG based on the density matrix formalism, deriving the third-harmonic conductivity tensor. Our framework isolates five distinct band-geometric contributions to interband and intraband processes, separates Fermi sea from Fermi surface terms, and incorporates disorder effects phenomenologically. We further provide a complete symmetry classification of THG for all 122 magnetic point groups. Applying the theory to the spin-split altermagnet RuO$_2$, we trace its THG response to specific geometric terms. These results establish a predictive foundation for designing materials with enhanced and tunable THG in the finite-frequency regime.

Title: Multispecies totally asymmetric simple exclusion process with long-range swap
Authors: Eunghyun Lee
Abstract: We introduce the multispecies totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (mTASEP) with long-range swap, a new interacting particle system combining the backward-push rule with the forward-jump rule. Although governed by local dynamics, the model induces effective long-range particle exchanges. We establish its integrability by proving two-particle reducibility and showing that the associated scattering matrix satisfies the Yang-Baxter equation. In addition, we derive explicit contour integral formulas for transition probabilities. These results position the long-range swap model as a novel exactly solvable multispecies process, characterized by distinctive algebraic features and opening new directions for further study in integrable probability and statistical mechanics.

Title: Crystal Structure Prediction with a Geometric Permutation-Invariant Loss Function
Authors: Emmanuel Jehanno, Romain Menegaux, Julien Mairal, Sergei Grudinin
Abstract: Crystalline structure prediction remains an open challenge in materials design. Despite recent advances in computational materials science, accurately predicting the three-dimensional crystal structures of organic materials--an essential first step for designing materials with targeted properties--remains elusive. In this work, we address the problem of molecular assembly, where a set $\mathcal{S}$ of identical rigid molecules is packed to form a crystalline structure. Existing state-of-the-art models typically rely on computationally expensive, iterative flow-matching approaches. We propose a novel loss function that correctly captures key geometric molecular properties while maintaining permutation invariance over $\mathcal{S}$. We achieve this via a differentiable linear assignment scheme based on the Sinkhorn algorithm. Remarkably, we show that even a simple regression using our method {\em SinkFast} significantly outperforms more complex flow-matching approaches on the COD-Cluster17 benchmark, a curated subset of the Crystallography Open Database (COD).

Title: Deformation-Driven Enhancement of Spin Defect Emission in Hexagonal Boron Nitride
Authors: Jianpei Geng, Xuankai Zhou, Nils Gross, Song Li, Yan Tung Kong, Jixing Zhang, Guodong Bian, San Lam Ng, Cheng-I Ho, Andrej Denisenko, Rainer Stöhr, Ruoming Peng, Jurgen Smet, Jörg Wrachtrup
Abstract: The negatively charged boron vacancy (VB-) in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has been extensively investigated as it offers a novel playground for two-dimensional quantum sensing, with ultimate proximity to target samples. However, its practical sensitivity is limited by the intrinsically weak photoluminescence of the spin ensemble. Here, we report a photoluminescence enhancement of up to 30 times from VB- centers in suspended regions of hBN compared to those in substrate-supported areas. The key spin properties, such as the optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) contrast and linewidth, as well as the spin lifetime, of the VB- centers in this region are well preserved. Detailed investigations, including measurements of zero-field ODMR, Raman spectroscopy, and Kelvin probe force microscopy, reveal a correlation between emission enhancement and local deformation in the sample. It is concluded that the suspended regions exhibit higher local deformation compared to the supported areas, breaking the local symmetry and thereby activating otherwise forbidden or weak optical transitions of the VB- centers.

Title: Massive Dirac states bound to vortices by a boson-fermion interaction
Authors: Ethan P. Honda
Abstract: Results are presented from numerical simulations of the flat-space nonlinear Maxwell-Klein-Gordon-Dirac equations. The introduction of a boson-fermion interaction allows a scalar vortex to act as a harmonic trap that can confine massive Dirac bound states. A parametric analysis is performed to understand the range of boson-fermion coupling strengths, Ginzburg-Landau parameters, and fermion effective masses that support the existence of bound state solutions. Solutions are time-evolved and are observed to be stable until the fermion number density becomes large enough to collapse the spontaneously broken vacuum of the condensate. Head-on scattering simulations are performed, and traditional vortex right-angle scattering is shown to break down with increased fermion number density, $n_f$. For sufficiently large $n_f$ and low velocity, the collision of two vortices results in a pseudostable bound state with winding number $m=2$ that eventually becomes unstable and decays into two $m=1$ vortices. For large $n_f$ and collision velocity, vortex scattering is observed to produce nontopological (zero winding number) scalar bound states that are ejected from the collision. The scalar bubbles contain coherent fermion bound states in their interiors and interpolate between the spontaneously broken vacuum of the bulk and the modified vacuum induced by the boson-fermion interaction.

Authors: P. L. Krapivsky, A. Yu. Plakhov
Abstract: A compromise process describes the evolution of opinions through binary interactions. Opinions are real numbers, and in each step, two randomly selected agents reach a compromise, namely, they acquire the average of their pre-interaction opinions. We prove that if the number $N$ of agents is a power of two, the consensus emerges after a finite number of compromise events with probability one; otherwise, the consensus cannot be reached in a finite number of steps (if initial opinions are in a general position). The number of steps required to reach consensus is random for $N=2^k$ with $k\geq 2$. We prove that typically, the smallest number of steps to reach consensus is equal to $k\cdot 2^{k-1}$. For $N=4$, we determine the distribution of the number of steps, e.g., we show that it has a purely exponential tail and compute all cumulants.

Title: Testing maximum entropy models with e-values
Authors: Francesca Giuffrida, Diego Garlaschelli, Peter Grünwald
Abstract: E-values have recently emerged as a robust and flexible alternative to p-values for hypothesis testing, especially under optional continuation, i.e., when additional data from further experiments are collected. In this work, we define optimal e-values for testing between maximum entropy models, both in the microcanonical (hard constraints) and canonical (soft constraints) settings. We show that, when testing between two hypotheses that are both microcanonical, the so-called growth-rate optimal e-variable admits an exact analytical expression, which also serves as a valid e-variable in the canonical case. For canonical tests, where exact solutions are typically unavailable, we introduce a microcanonical approximation and verify its excellent performance via both theoretical arguments and numerical simulations. We then consider constrained binary models, focusing on $2 \times k$ contingency tables -- an essential framework in statistics and a natural representation for various models of complex systems. Our microcanonical optimal e-variable performs well in both settings, constituting a new tool that remains effective even in the challenging case when the number $k$ of groups grows with the sample size, as in models with growing features used for the analysis of real-world heterogeneous networks and time-series.

Title: Calibration-sample free distortion correction of electron diffraction patterns using deep learning
Authors: Matthew R.C. Fitzpatrick, Arthur M. Blackburn, Cristina Cordoba
Abstract: The accuracy of the information that can be extracted from electron diffraction patterns is often limited by the presence of optical distortions. Existing distortion characterization techniques typically require knowledge of the reciprocal lattice of either the sample of interest or a separate calibration sample, the latter of which would need to be swapped in, thus adding time and inconvenience to an experiment. To overcome this limitation, we develop a deep learning (DL) framework for measuring and correcting combinations of different types of optical distortion in CBED patterns. Quantitative performance tests of our DL model are conducted using testing datasets of artificial distorted CBED patterns of molybdenum disulfide on amorphous carbon, with varying sizes of CBED disks, that are generated using multislice simulations. The performance test results of our DL approach are benchmarked against those obtained using a conventional distortion estimation technique that uses the radial gradient maximization (RGM) technique and knowledge of the reciprocal lattice system. While the RGM approach outperforms our DL approach for the CBED patterns with very small disks, our DL approach outperforms the RGM approach for the CBED patterns with medium-sized disks, as well as those with large overlapping disks. The benchmarking results suggest that our DL approach, which does not require knowledge of the sample, achieves a good compromise between convenience and accuracy. We also show how our DL framework can be used to improve experimental ptychographic reconstructions, and to correct optical distortion in experimental selected area electron diffraction patterns.

Title: Energy Efficiency of Hydrocarbon Isomer Separation via Levi-Blow Mechanism: Benchmarking Against Conventional Methods
Authors: Shubhadeep Nag, Yashonath Subramanian
Abstract: Separation of hydrocarbon isomers with closely matched physicochemical properties remains an energetically demanding challenge in the petrochemical refineries. This study presents a comparative analysis of three methods: the fractional distillation, the Molex process, and the Levi-Blow (LB) technique. Using experimentally validated thermodynamic data and heat-transfer estimates, we quantify the energy expenditure and number of cycles required to achieve ultrahigh-purity separation. The LB method achieves eight-9s purity in a single cycle with just 39.4~kJ/mol, while fractional distillation and Molex require multiple iterations and up to five orders of magnitude more energy. Each method is also benchmarked against the thermodynamic minimum work of separation of the mixture of interest. It is found that the LB technique operates within a factor of 23 of this lower bound, compared to $\sim 10^2$ for Molex (Molex is a trademark and/or service mark of UOP Inc.) and $\sim 10^5$ for fractional distillation, demonstrating its thermodynamic and operational superiority.

Title: Topological Control of Polaritonic Flatbands in Anisotropic van der Waals Metasurfaces
Authors: Connor Heimig, Thomas Weber, Cristina Cruciano, Armando Genco, Thomas Possmayer, Luca Sortino, Gianluca Valentini, Cristian Manzoni, Stefan A. Maier, Maxim V. Gorkunov, Giulio Cerullo, Alexander A. Antonov, Andreas Tittl
Abstract: Anisotropic van der Waals (vdW) materials exhibit direction-dependent optical and electronic properties, making them valuable for tailoring directional light-matter interactions. Rhenium disulfide (ReS$_2$) stands out for its strong in-plane anisotropy and its thickness-independent direct-bandgap excitons, which can hybridize with light to form exciton-polaritons. In parallel, metasurfaces, engineered arrays of nanoscale subwavelength resonators, can support ultra-sharp photonic modes in the form of quasi-bound states in the continuum (qBICs). Topological transformations of photonic modes can give rise to flatbands, i.e., dispersionless states with quenched kinetic energy and vanishing group velocity. Intrinsic material anisotropy offers an unexplored route to robust far-field flatband formation and control. Here, we demonstrate how structuring an intrinsically anisotropic excitonic material into a resonant metasurface fundamentally transforms its photonic topological features and light-matter coupling behavior, allowing us to drive and topologically control extended far-field flatband formation. To this end, we fabricate C$_4$-symmetric metasurfaces directly from bulk ReS$_2$. The intrinsic anisotropy lifts the initial double degeneracy of the qBIC mode and yields two distinctly polarized resonances. It also reshapes the topological landscape: the integer topological charge of the qBIC mode splits into momentum-separated half-integer singularities, thereby flattening the far-field photonic dispersion. The resulting topologically-controlled photonic flatbands are then tuned in resonance with the linearly polarized excitonic transitions of ReS$_2$, resulting in two distinct, directionally hybridized exciton-polariton flatband regimes. These findings establish anisotropic vdW metasurfaces as a new platform for topologically engineered flatbands and flatband-driven light-matter coupling.

Title: Ionization/dissociation-driven first order phase transitions: on a new class of first order phase transitions
Authors: Genri Norman, Ilnur Saitov
Abstract: In this work, we compare various models for describing the phase transition of the fluid hydrogen into a conducting state, including both chemical models of plasma and first-principle simulations within the framework of the density functional theory (DFT). The comparison of the results indicates the plasma nature of the phase transition in warm dense hydrogen. We propose a concept of a new class of first-order phase transitions: ionization or dissociation-driven phase transitions, with which the plasma phase transition in fluid hydrogen can be associated.

Title: Learning by training: emergent return-point memory from cyclically tuning disordered sphere packings
Authors: Mengjie Zu, Carl P. Goodrich
Abstract: Many living and artificial systems improve their fitness or performance by adapting to changing environments or diverse training data. However, it remains unclear how such environmental variation influences adaptation, what is learned in the process, and whether memory of past conditions is retained. In this work, we investigate these questions using athermal disordered systems that are subject to cyclic inverse design, enabling them to attain target elastic properties spanning a chosen range. We demonstrate that such systems evolve toward a marginally absorbing manifold (MAM), which encodes memory of the training range that closely resembles return-point memory observed in cyclically driven systems. We further propose a general mechanism for the formation of MAMs and the corresponding memory that is based on gradient discontinuities in the trained quantities. Our model provides a simple and broadly applicable physical framework for understanding how adaptive systems learn under environmental change and how they retain memory of past experiences.

Title: CbLDM: A Diffusion Model for recovering nanostructure from pair distribution function
Authors: Jiarui Cao, Zhiyang Zhang, Heming Wang, Jun Xu, Ling Lan, Ran Gu
Abstract: Nowadays, the nanostructure inverse problem is an attractive problem that helps researchers to understand the relationship between the properties and the structure of nanomaterials. This article focuses on the problem of using PDF to recover the nanostructure, which this article views as a conditional generation problem. This article propose a deep learning model CbLDM, Condition-based Latent Diffusion Model. Based on the original latent diffusion model, the sampling steps of the diffusion model are reduced and the sample generation efficiency is improved by using the conditional prior to estimate conditional posterior distribution, which is the approximated distribution of p(z|x). In addition, this article uses the Laplacian matrix instead of the distance matrix to recover the nanostructure, which can reduce the reconstruction error. Finally, this article compares CbLDM with existing models which were used to solve the nanostructure inverse problem, and find that CbLDM demonstrates significantly higher prediction accuracy than these models, which reflects the ability of CbLDM to solve the nanostructure inverse problem and the potential to cope with other continuous conditional generation tasks.

Title: Bosonic Bogoliubov transformations as Lorentz boosts in $(c,{\overline c})=(1,1)$ conformal field theories with marginal $J{\overline J }$ deformations
Authors: Federico L. Bottesi, Guillermo R. Zemba
Abstract: We consider conformal field theories with central charges $(c,{\overline c})=(1,1)$ that are invariant under the exchange of the holomorphic and antiholomorphic sectors, in both bosonic and fermionic realizations that are meaningful for condensed matter systems. The effect of marginal current-current $(J,{\overline J})$ perturbations is to induce a deformation of the Hilbert space given by a Lorentz boost in the 2D space of currents, which is identified with a Bogoliubov transformation. The rapidity of the boost is determined by the coupling constant of the marginal perturbation. When the perturbation is diagonal in the original currents of the theory, there is a linear relation between the two, and non-linear otherwise. In the fermionic cases, both free and with Calogero-Sutherland interactions, the marginal perturbation corresponds to backward scattering processes.

Title: Graph Contrastive Learning versus Untrained Baselines: The Role of Dataset Size
Authors: Smayan Khanna, Doruk Efe Gökmen, Risi Kondor, Vincenzo Vitelli
Abstract: Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has emerged as a leading paradigm for self- supervised learning on graphs, with strong performance reported on standardized datasets and growing applications ranging from genomics to drug discovery. We ask a basic question: does GCL actually outperform untrained baselines? We find that GCL's advantage depends strongly on dataset size and task difficulty. On standard datasets, untrained Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), simple multilayer perceptrons, and even handcrafted statistics can rival or exceed GCL. On the large molecular dataset ogbg-molhiv, we observe a crossover: GCL lags at small scales but pulls ahead beyond a few thousand graphs, though this gain eventually plateaus. On synthetic datasets, GCL accuracy approximately scales with the logarithm of the number of graphs and its performance gap (compared with untrained GNNs) varies with respect to task complexity. Moving forward, it is crucial to identify the role of dataset size in benchmarks and applications, as well as to design GCL algorithms that avoid performance plateaus.

Title: Superstrong Dynamics and Chiral Emission of a Giant Atom in a Structured Bath
Authors: Vincent Jouanny, Léo Peyruchat, Marco Scigliuzzo, Alberto Mercurio, Enrico Di Benedetto, Daniele De Bernardis, Davide Sbroggiò, Simone Frasca, Vincenzo Savona, Francesco Ciccarello, Pasquale Scarlino
Abstract: Quantum emitters coupled to waveguides with nonlinear dispersion show rich quantum dynamics with the promise of implementing non-trivial non-Markovian quantum models. Recent advances in engineered photonic environments now allow the realization of discrete-site waveguides with tailored dispersion, yet most implementations of waveguide QED remain limited to a local qubit-waveguide coupling. Here, we study a transmon qubit non-locally coupled to a high-impedance coupled cavity array (CCA), thus implementing a \emph{giant atom} in a structured photonic environment. The non-local coupling produces interference with the CCA eigenmodes, selectively enhancing interaction with long-wavelength (low-effective $k$), symmetric modes about the array center, while suppressing coupling to antisymmetric and short-wavelength modes. For a subset of symmetric, low-effective $k$ modes, we reach the superstrong coupling regime. In this regime, measurements of the atomic participation ratio reveal strongly hybridized eigenmodes on a par with a strongly reduced qubit participation at the frequency of maximum hybridization with the qubit, in agreement with theory. Time-domain measurements of the qubit dynamics show clear deviations from the single-mode Jaynes--Cummings model, marked by the emergence of mode--mode interactions. By breaking inversion symmetry, the qubit seeds dressed eigenmodes confined to either the right or left of the qubit, which we exploit to implement and characterize a chiral photon-emission protocol. These results demonstrate precise control over multimode light--matter interaction in a structured photonic environment.

Title: The Zeno-like effect in a spin-chain quantum battery
Authors: Maulana M. Fajar, Beta N. Pratiwi, Subur Pramono, Gagus K. Sunnardianto, Ahmad R. T. Nugraha
Abstract: Quantum batteries, which can be seen as energy- or state-storage devices exploiting coherence and other quantum effects, are sensitive to environmental noise. Here we show that, when suitably engineered, environmental noise can induce a "Zeno-like" stabilization of the charging process in a spin-chain quantum battery. To explore this interplay, we study a system size N=6, which provides large storage capacity with moderate computational cost, and more importantly, allows the stored energy to become almost fully extractable since the ergotropy nearly coincides with the total capacity. We analyze three local noise channels: bit flip, phase flip, and bit phase flip. We vary the strength of each channel to emulate frequent environmental monitoring, reminiscent of the quantum Zeno effect, and track its influence on the charging dynamics and stored energy. The phase-flip channel slows charging under strong noise but stabilizes stored energy and ergotropy. The bit-flip channel enables faster charging but saturates at low capacities, while the bit phase flip channel combines both features. In the discharging stage, different noise channels lead to distinct release dynamics, showing that noise can paradoxically enhance and stabilize quantum battery operation.

Title: Optical Trapping of SrOH Molecules for Dark Matter and T-violation Searches
Authors: Hiromitsu Sawaoka, Abdullah Nasir, Annika Lunstad, Mingda Li, Jack Mango, Zack D. Lasner, John M. Doyle
Abstract: We report an optical dipole trap of strontium monohydroxide (SrOH) with 1400(300) trapped molecules. Through optical pumping, we access vibrational states that are proposed for improved probes of the electron's electric dipole moment (eEDM) and ultralight dark matter (UDM). For each of these states, the lifetime of trapped molecules is measured, and found to be consistent with spontaneous radiative decay and black-body excitation limits, making this platform viable for these eEDM and UDM searches.

Title: Phase-Sensitive Measurements on a Fermi-Hubbard Quantum Processor
Authors: Alberto R. Cavallar, Luis Escalera-Moreno, Titus Franz, Timon Hilker, J. Ignacio Cirac, Philipp M. Preiss, Benjamin F. Schiffer
Abstract: Fermionic quantum processors are a promising platform for quantum simulation of correlated fermionic matter. In this work, we study a hardware-efficient protocol for measuring complex expectation values of the time-evolution operator, commonly referred to as Loschmidt echoes, with fermions in an optical superlattice. We analyze the algorithm for the Fermi-Hubbard model at half-filling as well as at finite doping. The method relies on global quench dynamics and short imaginary time evolution, the latter being realized by architecture-tailored pulse sequences starting from a product state of plaquettes. Our numerical results show that complex Loschmidt echoes can be efficiently obtained for large many-body states over a broad spectral range. This allows one to measure spectral properties of the Fermi-Hubbard model, such as the local density of states, and paves the way for the study of finite-temperature properties in current fermionic quantum simulators.

Title: Grid congestion stymies climate benefit from U.S. vehicle electrification
Authors: Chao Duan, Adilson E. Motter
Abstract: Averting catastrophic global warming requires decisive action to decarbonize key sectors. Vehicle electrification, alongside renewable energy integration, is a long-term strategy toward zero carbon emissions. However, transitioning to fully renewable electricity may take decades -- during which electric vehicles may still rely on carbon-intensive electricity. We analyze the critical role of the transmission network in enabling or constraining emissions reduction from U.S. vehicle electrification. Our models reveal that the available transmission capacity severely limits potential CO2 emissions reduction. With adequate transmission, full electrification could nearly eliminate vehicle operational CO2 emissions once renewable generation reaches the existing nonrenewable capacity. In contrast, the current grid would support only a fraction of that benefit. Achieving the full emissions reduction potential of vehicle electrification during this transition will require a moderate but targeted increase in transmission capacity. Our findings underscore the pressing need to enhance transmission infrastructure to unlock the climate benefits of large-scale electrification and renewable integration.

Title: Sensing electric fields through Rydberg atom networks
Authors: Philip Kitson, Wayne J. Chetcuti, Gerhard Birkl, Luigi Amico, Juan Polo
Abstract: We present the operating principle of a quantum sensor for electric fields based on networks of Rydberg atoms. The sensing mechanism exploits the dependence of the Rydberg blockade on the electric field, particularly in the vicinity of the Förster resonance - the electric field can be measured through the variation in the size of the blockade radius across the network of Rydberg atoms. Specifically, we track the dynamics of Rydberg excitations in systems of various spatial structures, subjected to different electric field configurations, to monitor the connection between the field and blockade. We also use the density-density correlator to analyse spatially varying (inhomogeneous) electric fields and relate these correlators to the applied fields.

Title: Heterogeneity drives plasmid maintenance in large microbial communities
Authors: Johannes Nautaa, Kaitlin A. Schaal, Ying-Jie Wang, James P.J. Hall, Shai Pilosof, Manlio De Domenico
Abstract: Microbiomes are complex systems comprised of many interacting species. Species can survive harsh or changing conditions by rapid adaptation, a process accelerated by the exchange of genetic material between different species through horizontal gene transfer. Conjugative plasmids are ubiquitous mobile genetic elements that mediate such exchanges both within and between species. Therefore, predicting whether a plasmid can invade and be maintained by a microbial community is critical, for example when assessing the risks of antimicrobial resistance gene spread in commensal or environmental microbiomes. However, existing theory developed to assist such predictions has generally focused on the balance among plasmid costs, benefits, and infection rates, overlooking other relevant factors such as the inherent dynamics and diversity of microbiomes. Here, we hypothesize that plasmid persistence in the absence of positive selection can arise purely from the heterogeneity present in large and diverse microbial communities. We introduce a generic model that integrates population-level dynamics with plasmid conjugation. Using this model, we show that we can predict plasmid maintenance, and that the probability for a plasmid to be maintained depends on traits of the plasmid, most importantly the conjugation rate, and the species abundance distribution of the community. Then, using both empirical abundance data and extensive numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the inherent randomness of ecological interactions and conjugation rates enables plasmid persistence -- even in the absence of positive selection. Our findings thus suggest that natural microbial communities are likely to maintain plasmids indefinitely, offering a new perspective on the spread, maintenance, and ubiquity of plasmids.

Title: Reflection positivity and a refined index for 2d invertible phases
Authors: Nikita Sopenko
Abstract: We analyze the validity of reflection positivity in the classification of invertible phases of quantum spin systems. We provide a mathematical model in which every 2d invertible state admits a reflection-positive representative. We prove that reflection positivity provides a canonical lift from the set of invertible phases to the set of invertible phases protected by a $\mathbb{Z}/N$-rotational symmetry. Using this, we define a refined version of the index recently introduced by the author. This refined version conjecturally provides a microscopic characterization of an invariant that coincides with the chiral central charge $c_-$ when conformal field theory effectively describes the boundary modes.

Title: Optimal information injection and transfer mechanisms for active matter reservoir computing
Authors: Mario U. Gaimann, Miriam Klopotek
Abstract: Reservoir computing (RC) is a state-of-the-art machine learning method that makes use of the power of dynamical systems (the reservoir) for real-time inference. When using biological complex systems as reservoir substrates, it serves as a testbed for basic questions about bio-inspired computation -- of how self-organization generates proper spatiotemporal patterning. Here, we use a simulation of an active matter system, driven by a chaotically moving input signal, as a reservoir. So far, it has been unclear whether such complex systems possess the capacity to process information efficiently and independently of the method by which it was introduced. We find that when switching from a repulsive to an attractive driving force, the system completely changes the way it computes, while the predictive performance landscapes remain nearly identical. The nonlinearity of the driver's injection force improves computation by decoupling the single-agent dynamics from that of the driver. Triggered are the (re-)growth, deformation, and active motion of smooth structural boundaries (interfaces), and the emergence of coherent gradients in speed -- features found in many soft materials and biological systems. The nonlinear driving force activates emergent regulatory mechanisms, which manifest enhanced morphological and dynamic diversity -- arguably improving fading memory, nonlinearity, expressivity, and thus, performance. We further perform RC in a broad variety of non-equilibrium active matter phases that arise when tuning internal (repulsive) forces for information transfer. Overall, we find that active matter agents forming liquid droplets are particularly well suited for RC. The consistently convex shape of the predictive performance landscapes, together with the observed phenomenological richness, conveys robustness and adaptivity.

Title: Wave-number lock-in in buckled elastic structures: an analogue to parametric instabilities
Authors: Helen E. Read, Giada Risso, Adel Djellouli, Katia Bertoldi, Arnaud Lazarus
Abstract: Parametric instabilities are a known feature of periodically driven dynamic systems; at particular frequencies and amplitudes of the driving modulation, the system's quasi-periodic response undergoes a frequency lock-in, leading to a periodically unstable response. Here, we demonstrate an analogous phenomenon in a purely static context. We show that the buckling patterns of an elastic beam resting on a modulated Winkler foundation display the same kind of frequency lock-in observed in dynamic systems. Through simulations and experiments, we reveal that compressed elastic strips with modulated height alternate between predictable quasi-periodic and periodic buckling modes. Our findings uncover previously unexplored analogies between structural and dynamic instabilities, highlighting how even simple elastic structures can give rise to rich and intriguing behaviors.

Abstract: The Kramers-Wannier duality introduces a well-known non-invertible symmetry in the critical transverse-field Ising model.

Title: Quantum Tomography of Suspended Carbon Nanotubes
Authors: Jialiang Chang, Nicholas Pietrzak, Cristian Staii
Abstract: We present an all-mechanical protocol for coherent control and full quantum-state reconstruction of the fundamental flexural mode of a suspended carbon nanotube (CNT). Calibrated impulses from a nearby atomic force microscope (AFM) tip serve a dual role: they implement mechanical pi/2 rotations for Ramsey interferometry and realize phase-space displacements for Wigner function tomography via displaced-parity sampling. The same actuator thus unifies control and tomography while avoiding optical heating and eliminating on-chip microwave drive lines at the resonator. We derive explicit control pulse sequences and a master-equation description that map measured signals onto the energy-relaxation and phase-coherence times, as well as onto parity-based quantum signatures, including negative regions of the Wigner function. The approach is compatible with multiple readout modalities: direct AFM deflection, dispersive coupling to a Cooper-pair box, and dispersive microwave cavity probing. Together, these techniques provide complete access to populations, coherence, and parity within a single device architecture. This minimal scheme provides a practical route to all-mechanical quantum control and state-resolved characterization of decoherence in mesoscopic mechanical systems.

Title: Inference of epidemic networks: the effect of different data types
Authors: Oscar Fajardo-Fontiveros, Carl J. E. Suster, Eduardo G. Altmann
Abstract: We investigate how the properties of epidemic networks change depending on the availability of different types of data on a disease outbreak. This is achieved by introducing mathematical and computational methods that estimate the probability of transmission trees by combining generative models that jointly determine the number of infected hosts, the probability of infection between them depending on location and genetic information, and their time of infection and sampling. We introduce a suitable Markov Chain Monte Carlo method that we show to sample trees according to their probability. Statistics performed over the sampled trees lead to probabilistic estimations of network properties and other quantities of interest, such as the number of unobserved hosts and the depth of the infection tree. We confirm the validity of our approach by comparing the numerical results with analytically solvable examples. Finally, we apply our methodology to data from COVID-19 in Australia. We find that network properties that are important for the management of the outbreak depend sensitively on the type of data used in the inference.

Title: Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis with Projective Representation
Authors: Soma Onoda, Osamu Fukushima, Ryusuke Hamazaki, Okuto Morikawa
Abstract: The Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH) provides a sufficient condition for thermalization of isolated quantum systems. While the standard ETH is formulated in the absence of degeneracy, physical systems often possess symmetries that induce degenerate energy eigenstates. In this paper, we investigate ETH in the presence of nontrivial projective representations of Abelian symmetries, which arise naturally from 't Hooft anomalies. We argue that such projective structures can lead to degenerate excited states, and how the ETH can be formulated under such degeneracies. In the presence of projective charges supplied by symmetry operators, our projective-representation ETH indicates that the stationary values of the operators are described by the generalized Gibbs ensemble instead of the standard Gibbs ensemble. Our findings elucidate the role of symmetry and degeneracy in quantum thermalization and pave the way for further exploration of the ETH in anomalous symmetry settings.

Title: Quantum Pontus-Mpemba Effects in Real and Imaginary-time Dynamics
Authors: Hui Yu, Jiangping Hu, Shi-Xin Zhang
Abstract: The quantum Pontus-Mpemba effect (QPME) is a counterintuitive phenomenon wherein a quantum system relaxes more rapidly through a two-step evolution protocol than through direct evolution under a symmetric Hamiltonian alone. In this protocol, the system first evolves under a symmetry-breaking Hamiltonian and then switches to a symmetric one. We demonstrate that QPME occurs under both real-time and imaginary-time dynamics with respect to $U(1)$-symmetry. Using tilted ferromagnetic initial states, we demonstrate that a transient asymmetric evolution significantly accelerates thermalization or convergence to the ground state for both real-time and imaginary-time evolutions, respectively. The effect is pronounced for small tilt angles, while larger tilts or antiferromagnetic initial states suppress it. Numerical evidence across different system sizes confirms the robustness of QPME, demonstrating its stability in the thermodynamic limit. This finding not only deepens our fundamental understanding of non-equilibrium quantum phenomena but also opens new possibilities for accelerating quantum simulation and computation.

Title: Analysing contrarian behaviour using nonlinear biased $q$-voter model
Authors: Amit Pradhan, Pratik Mullick, Parongama Sen
Abstract: We investigate the role of contrarians in a recently proposed weighted-influence variant of the $q$-voter model. In this framework, non-unanimous influence groups affect the focal agent through weighted contributions governed by a bias parameter $p$. We extend this setting by introducing a fraction $\alpha$ ($\alpha> 0$) of contrarians, defined as agents who systematically oppose the prevailing influence irrespective of whether the group is unanimous or divided. Analytical mean-field calculations and Monte Carlo simulations reveal that the final states of the system are governed by simple phase boundaries: regions of positive and negative majority separated by the lines $p=1/2$ and $\alpha=1/2$, with equally-mixed states confined to these boundaries. While low contrarian densities are insufficient to overturn the bias, higher values of $\alpha$ systematically drive the system closer to a balanced coexistence of opinions, though exact parity is prevented by the presence of bias $p$. We further analyze the temporal relaxation of opinions and extract the characteristic timescales of convergence. Our findings highlight how contrarians, acting as structured non-conformists, can suppress consensus and maintain opinion diversity, while internal biases ultimately hinder a perfectly even split.

Title: Enhanced Raman scattering by fast GaN phonon-polaritons
Authors: Mayssoune Mina, Toni Alhaddad, Olivier Pagès
Abstract: Phonon-polaritons propagating in crystal volume offer the possibility of transferring information throughout matter (via phonons) at high (photon-like) velocity and tunable frequency/wavelength in the far-infrared. However, from the phonon-polariton Raman cross section, the phonon and photon advantages seem mutually exclusive. Either the phonon-polaritons are fast (photon-like) but hardly supported by the lattice (not phonon-like), or they are well supported by the lattice (testified by a high Raman efficiency) but slow (not photon-like). An optimal phonon-photon coupling is currently searched for in hexagonal-GaN by near-forward Raman scattering across parallel crystal faces with in-plane singular c-axis. Two accessible phonons, i.e., the ordinary A1 and E1 ones, plus two refractive indices, i.e., the ordinary and extraordinary ones, generate various phonon-polariton candidates. Notably, in perfect forward Raman scattering and in crossed polarizations of the incident (along c) and scattered lights, which, altogether, maximizes the transferred wavevector to the crystal at minimum scattering angle, a fast phonon-polariton, stemming from the bottleneck of the E1 dispersion on entry to the deep photon-like regime, is activated. It is well supported by the lattice since its Raman signal is strong and sharp, enhanced by multi-reflection of the laser beam between crystal faces at near-normal incidence. This fast Raman-enhanced phonon-polariton is interesting for infrared-photonics in that it cumulates the advantages of a photon (speed) and of a phonon (Raman intensity). Besides, it commutates from a phonon-polariton to a phonon by deviating from normal incidence or by permuting the incident and scattered polarizations, with potential applications as a vibrational/optical switch.

Title: Inference in Spreading Processes with Neural-Network Priors
Authors: Davide Ghio, Fabrizio Boncoraglio, Lenka Zdeborová
Abstract: Stochastic processes on graphs are a powerful tool for modelling complex dynamical systems such as epidemics. A recent line of work focused on the inference problem where one aims to estimate the state of every node at every time, starting from partial observation of a subset of nodes at a subset of times. In these works, the initial state of the process was assumed to be random i.i.d. over nodes. Such an assumption may not be realistic in practice, where one may have access to a set of covariate variables for every node that influence the initial state of the system. In this work, we will assume that the initial state of a node is an unknown function of such covariate variables. Given that functions can be represented by neural networks, we will study a model where the initial state is given by a simple neural network -- notably the single-layer perceptron acting on the known node-wise covariate variables. Within a Bayesian framework, we study how such neural-network prior information enhances the recovery of initial states and spreading trajectories. We derive a hybrid belief propagation and approximate message passing (BP-AMP) algorithm that handles both the spreading dynamics and the information included in the node covariates, and we assess its performance against the estimators that either use only the spreading information or use only the information from the covariate variables. We show that in some regimes, the model can exhibit first-order phase transitions when using a Rademacher distribution for the neural-network weights. These transitions create a statistical-to-computational gap where even the BP-AMP algorithm, despite the theoretical possibility of perfect recovery, fails to achieve it.

Title: Theory for the spectral splitting exponent of exceptional points
Authors: Shu-Xuan Wang, Zhongbo Yan
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs), singularities in non-Hermitian systems where eigenvalues and eigenstates coalesce, exhibit a dramatically enhanced response to perturbations compared to Hermitian degeneracies. This makes them exceptional candidates for sensing applications. The spectral splitting of an $N$th-order EP scales with perturbation strength $\epsilon$ over a wide range, from $\epsilon$ to $\epsilon^{1/N}$. Although the exact scaling exponent can be determined in principle by solving the characteristic equation, this approach becomes analytically intractable for large $N$ and often fails to yield useful physical insight. In this work, we develop a theory to directly predict the scaling exponent from the matrix positions of the perturbation. By using the Jordan block structure of the unperturbed Hamiltonian, we show that the splitting exponent can be analytically determined when the matrix positions of the perturbation satisfy some specific conditions. Our analytical framework provides a useful design principle for engineering perturbations to achieve a desired spectral response, facilitating the development of EP-based sensors.

Title: Optimizing digital quantum simulation of open quantum lattice models
Authors: Xie-Hang Yu, Hongchao Li, J. Ignacio Cirac, Rahul Trivedi
Abstract: Many-body systems arising in condensed matter physics and quantum optics inevitably couple to the environment and need to be modelled as open quantum systems. While near-optimal algorithms have been developed for simulating many-body quantum dynamics, algorithms for their open system counterparts remain less well investigated. We address the problem of simulating geometrically local many-body open quantum systems interacting with a stationary Gaussian environment. Under a smoothness assumption on the system-environment interaction, we develop near-optimal algorithms that, for a model with $N$ spins and evolution time $t$, attain a simulation error $\delta$ in the system-state with $\mathcal{O}(Nt(Nt/\delta)^{1 + o(1)})$ gates, $\mathcal{O}(t(Nt/\delta)^{1 + o(1)})$ parallelized circuit depth and $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(N(Nt/\delta)^{1 + o(1)})$ ancillas. We additionally show that, if only simulating local observables is of interest, then the circuit depth of the digital algorithm can be chosen to be independent of the system size $N$. This provides theoretical evidence for the utility of these algorithms for simulating physically relevant models, where typically local observables are of interest, on pre-fault tolerant devices. Finally, for the limiting case of Markovian dynamics with commuting jump operators, we propose two algorithms based on sampling a Wiener process and on a locally dilated Hamiltonian construction, respectively. These algorithms reduce the asymptotic gate complexity on $N$ compared to currently available algorithms in terms of the required number of geometrically local gates.

Title: Approaching transform-limited linewidths in telecom-wavelength transitions of ungated quantum dots
Authors: Andrew N. Wakileh, Dan Dalacu, Philip J. Poole, Boris Lamontagne, Simona Moisa, Robin L. Williams, Nir Rotenberg
Abstract: Highly coherent quantum emitters operating in the telecommunication C-band (1530 - 1565nm), where ultra-low-loss fibers and photonic circuits are available, are crucial to the development of scalable quantum technologies. In this work, we report on a modified Stranski-Krastanov growth scheme using chemical beam epitaxy to enable the generation of high-quality InAs/InP quantum dots, characterized by near-transform-limited linewidths ($\Gamma_{\mathrm{TL}}$). We demonstrate the growth of highly-symmetric quantum dots with aspect ratios >0.8 and densities ranging from 2 to 22$\,\mu$m$^{-2}$. Optical characterization of these sources reveal fine-structure splittings down to $25\pm4\,\mu$eV and a single-photon purity of $g^{(2)}(0) = 0.012\pm\mathrm{0.007}$, confirming the quality of these dots. Further, using an etalon to measure the linewidth, in combination with rigorous modelling, we find an upper-bound to the mean, low-power linewidths of only $12.1\pm 6.7\,\Gamma_\mathrm{TL}$ and, in the best case, $2.8\pm 1.8\,\Gamma_\mathrm{TL}$. These results represent a significant step in the development of telecom-wavelength quantum light sources which are essential for complex quantum networks and devices.

Title: A recursive formula for the $n^\text{th}$ survival function and the $n^\text{th}$ first passage time distribution for jump and diffusion processes. Applications to the pricing of $n^\text{th}$-to-default CDS
Authors: Alessio Lapolla
Abstract: We derive some rather general, but complicated, formulae to compute the survival function and the first passage time distribution of the $n^\text{th}$ coordinate of a many-body stochastic process in the presence of a killing barrier. First we will study the case of two coordinates and then we will generalize the results to three or more coordinates. Even if the results are difficult to implement, we will provide examples of their use applying them to a physical system, the single file diffusion, and to the financial problem of pricing a $n^\text{th}$-to-default credit default swap ($n^\text{th}$-CDS)

Title: Logarithmic lightcones in the multiparticle Anderson model with sparse interactions
Authors: Daniele Toniolo, Sougato Bose
Abstract: We prove that the dynamics of the one-dimensional $ XY $ model with random magnetic field perturbed by a sparse set of $ ZZ $ terms with a large coupling constant $ \Delta $ gives rise to Lieb-Robinson (L-R) bounds with a logarithmic lightcone and amplitude proportional to $ \Delta^{-1} $. These spin systems are equivalent to a set of spinless lattice fermions subjected to a random on site potential and sparse density-density interactions. In the absence of the random magnetic field we also obtain a suppression of the L-R bounds as $ \Delta^{-1} $. These results follow from the application of a general theorem about the L-R bound of a generic local time-dependent one-dimensional spin system with local time-dependent perturbations. Adopting the interaction picture of the dynamics, the large and sparse $ ZZ $ perturbations of the $ XY $ model, with or without disorder, are mapped into high-frequency periodic perturbations. All our results are non-perturbative.

Title: Thermodynamics, Dynamics, and Kinetics of Nanostructured Fluid-Solid Interfaces
Authors: Carlos E. Colosqui
Abstract: This article covers thermodynamic, dynamic, and kinetic models that are suitable for the analysis of wetting, adsorption, and related interfacial phenomena in colloidal and multiphase systems. Particular emphasis is made on describing crucial physical assumptions and the validity range of the described theoretical approaches and predictive models. The classical sharp interface treatment of thermodynamic systems where a perfectly smooth surface is assumed to separate homogeneous phases can present significant limitations when analyzing systems that are subject to thermal motion and present multiple metastable states caused by interfacial heterogeneities of nanoscale dimensions. Mesoscopic approaches such as stochastic Langevin dynamics can extend the application of sharp interface models to a wide variety of systems exhibiting metastability as they undergo thermal motion. For such metastable systems, dynamic and kinetic equations can describe the evolution of observable (macroscopic) variables as the system approaches thermodynamic equilibrium. Sufficiently close to equilibrium, Kramers theory of thermally activated escape from metastable states can be effectively employed to describe diverse wetting and interfacial processes via kinetic equations. Future directions for further advancement and application of thermodynamic, dynamic, and kinetic models are briefly discussed in the context of current technological developments involving nanoparticles, nanofluidics, and nanostructured surfaces.

Title: Diffusion in a rough potential: Dual-scale structure and regime crossovers
Authors: Carlos E. Colosqui
Abstract: Diffusion in a `rough' potential parameterized by a reaction coordinate $q$ is relevant to a wide spectrum of problems ranging from protein folding and charge transport in complex media to colloidal stabilization and self-assembly. This work studies the case of a potential having coarse-scale structure with characteristic energy barrier $\Delta U$ and period $\ell$, and fine-scale `roughness' of magnitude $\Delta U'\lesssim \Delta U$ and small period $\ell'\ll \ell$. Numerical solution of the Smoluchowski equation and analytical predictions from Kramers theory document distinct regimes at different distances $|\Delta q|=|q-q_E|$ from stable equilibrium at $q=q_E$. The physical diffusivity $D$ prescribed by dissipative effects can be observed farther than a distance $|\Delta q'| \propto (\Delta U'/\ell' + \Delta U/\ell)$. Rescaling the physical diffusivity to account for the fine-scale `roughness' is strictly valid when $|\Delta q| < \Delta q_I \propto (\Delta U'/\ell' - \Delta U/\ell)$. Farther than a critical distance $\Delta q_{II}\propto \Delta U/\ell$ the diffusion process is free of coarse-scale metastable states, which facilitates determining the effective diffusivity $D'$ from the reaction coordinate trajectory. Closer to equilibrium the coarse-scale structure induces two diffusive regimes: nearly logarithmic evolution for $\Delta q_{II} > |\Delta q| > \Delta q_{III}$ and exponential decay over time for $|\Delta q| < \Delta q_{III}\propto 1/\ell$. The effective diffusivity derived in this work is sensitive to the coarse- and fine-scale energy barriers and periods, and for $\ell'/\ell \to 0$ and $\Delta U'/k_B T \gg 1$ agrees closely with mean first-passage time estimates currently employed, which depend solely on the fine-scale energy barrier.

Title: Evidence for a Superfluid-to-solid Transition of Bilayer Excitons
Authors: Yihang Zeng, Dihao Sun, Naiyuan J. Zhang, Ron Q. Nguyen, Qianhui Shi, A. Okounkova, K. Watanabe, T. Taniguchi, J. Hone, C.R. Dean, J.I.A. Li
Abstract: One of the most spectacular properties associated with Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) is superfluidity in which the system exhibits zero viscosity and flows without dissipation. The superfluid phase has been observed in wide ranging Bosonic systems spanning naturally occurring quantum fluids, such as liquid helium, to engineered platforms such as bilayer excitons and cold atom systems. Theoretical works have proposed that interactions could drive the BEC ground state into another exotic phase that simultaneously exhibits properties of both a crystalline solid and a superfluid - termed a supersolid. Identifying a material system, however, that hosts the predicted BEC solid phase, driven purely by interactions and without imposing an external lattice potential, has remained elusive. Here we report observation of a superfluid to insulator transition in the layer-imbalanced regime of bilayer magneto-excitons. Mapping the transport behavior of the bilayer condensate as a function of density and temperature, suggests that the insulating phase is an ordered state of dilute excitons, stabilized by dipole interactions. The insulator melts into a recovered superfluid upon increasing the temperature, which could indicate that the low temperature solid is also a quantum coherent phase.

Title: Towards an ab initio derivation of generalised hydrodynamics from a gas of interacting wave packets
Authors: Benjamin Doyon, Friedrich Hübner
Abstract: We present steps towards an ab initio derivation of generalised hydrodynamics in quantum integrable models, starting from the Bethe wave functions, and explained on the example of the repulsive Lieb-Liniger model. This includes an identification of the generalised hydrodynamics quasi-particles as wave packets in the quantum model. These wave packets evolve according to a classical particle model and collect two-particle scattering shifts similar to solitons in integrable PDEs. We then discuss potential routes to obtain the generalised hydrodynamics equation for average conserved densities in long-wavelength states from this description. As part of this, we provide an explicit formula for the action of the spectral phase-space density operator on Bethe wave functions, and show that it generates local conserved densities.

Title: Experimental investigation of Lord Kelvins isentropic cooling and heating expression in tensile bars for two engineering alloys
Authors: S. J. Burns, C. E. Pratt, J. Carrock, J-P Gagnon, A. B. Sefkow
Abstract: Solids when rapidly and elastically stressed change temperature, the effect proposed by Lord Kelvin is adiabatic thermo-elastic cooling or heating depending on the sign of the stress. A fast sensitive IR camera has measured temperature both decreasing and increasing. Temperature measurements made from the reversible, elastic part of the stress-strain curve during fast uniaxial tensile loading have been investigated. The isentropic temperature cooling from the loading curve is recovered by heating after the specimen fractures when the load is released. These measurements establish for the first time isentropic thermal recovery in two engineering alloys. The materials tested are an AISI 4340 steel and an aluminum 2024 alloy. Measurements of the isentropic thermo-elastic stress cooling are -0.61 K/GPa for steel and -1.7 K/GPa for aluminum alloy. The isentropic thermo-elastic stress heating is -1.16 K/GPa for steel and -1.6 K/GPa for aluminum alloy. The isentropic, elastic part of the temperature is fully recoverable even after extensive plastic deformation upon fracture.

Title: Macroscopic Ferromagnetic Dynamics
Authors: Chen Sun, Wayne M. Saslow
Abstract: In metals with finite magnetization $\vec{M}$, experiment shows that transverse polarized dc spin currents $\vec{J}_{i}$ both decay and precess on crossing a finite sample thickness. The present work uses Onsager's irreversible thermodynamics, with $\vec{M}$ and $\vec{J}_{i}$ as fundamental variables, to develop a theory with aspects of the Landau-Lifshitz theory solely for the $\vec{M}$ of (charged) electronic ferromagnets, and of the Leggett theory for the $\vec{M}$ and $\vec{J}_{i}$ of (uncharged) nuclear paramagnets. As for the ferromagnet of Landau-Lifshitz, $\partial_{t}\vec{M}$ includes a characteristic decay time $\tau_{M}$. As for the nuclear paramagnet, $\partial_{t}\vec{J}_{i}$ includes a characteristic decay time $\tau_{J}$, is driven by the gradient of a (vector) spin pressure, and precesses about a mean-field proportional to $\vec{M}$. The spin pressure has a coefficient $G$ proportional to a velocity squared, and $D_{0}\equiv \frac{1}{2}G\tau_{J}$ serves as an effective diffusion coefficient. These equations apply when spin currents are generated. Using the derived dynamical equations for the magnetization and for the spin current, we obtain the steady state (dc limit) solution whose transverse wavevector squared is complex, with real part from diffusion and imaginary part from precession. The ac case is also considered.

Abstract: Existing quantum Hall interferometers measure twice the braiding phase, $e^{i2\theta}$, of Abelian anyons, i.e. the phase accrued when one quasi-particle encircles another clockwise. We propose a modified Fabry-Pérot or Mach-Zehnder interferometer that can measure $e^{i\theta}$.

Title: Vortex nucleations in spinor Bose condensates under localized synthetic magnetic fields
Authors: L.-R. Liu, S.-C. Wu, T.-W. Liu, H.-Y. Hsu, T.-K. Shen, S.-K. Yip, Y. Kawaguchi, Y.-J. Lin
Abstract: Gauge fields are ubiquitous in modern quantum physics. In superfluids, quantized vortices can be induced by gauge fields. Here we demonstrate the first experimental observation of vortex nucleations in light-dressed spinor Bose-Einstein condensates under radially-localized synthetic magnetic fields. The light-induced spin-orbital-angular-momentum coupling creates azimuthal gauge potentials $\vec{A}$ for the lowest-energy spinor branch dressed eigenstate. The observation of the atomic wave function in the lowest-energy dressed eigenstate reveals that vortices nucleate from the cloud center of a vortex-free state with canonical momentum $\vec{p} = 0$. This is because a large circulating azimuthal velocity field $\propto \vec{p}-\vec{A}$ at the condensate center results in a dynamically unstable localized excitation that initiates vortex nucleations. Furthermore, the long-time dynamics to reach the ground state stops in a metastable state when $|\vec{A}|$ is not sufficiently large. Our observation has reasonable agreement with the time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii simulations.

Title: Topological protection breakdown: a route to frustrated ferroelectricity
Authors: Ludovica Falsi, Pablo Villegas, Tommaso Gili, Aharon J. Agranat, Eugenio DelRe
Abstract: Phases manifesting topological patterns in functional systems, like ferroelectric and ferromagnetic vortex superlattices, can manifest intricate and apparently ungovernable behavior, typical of frustrated non-ergodic states with high-dimensional energy landscapes. This is also the case for potassium-tantalate-niobate (KTN) crystals. These transparent ferroelectrics manifest remarkable but little-understood metastable domain patterns at optical (micrometer and above) scales near the cubic-to-tetragonal structural phase transition. Here, we formulate the Topological Breakdown Model based on the competition between intrinsic scales of domain-domain collinear and non-collinear interactions associated with polarization-charge screening. The model is able to explain observed KTN mesoscopic domain patterns and phase diagram as a function of temperature and external electric field. Findings include a precise set of sharp and broad percolative transitions that are experimentally verified, validating the model. Our study identifies the central role played by competing topologically protected states, identifying a fundamental link between topological protection and frustration that supports a hitherto unexplored functional non-ergodic arena.

Title: Helical $f$-Wave Superconductivity in Cubic Rashba Superconductors
Authors: Qi-Sheng Xu, Zi-Ming Wang, Chui-Zhen Chen, Lun-Hui Hu, Rui Wang, Dong-Hui Xu
Abstract: The Rashba effect--a momentum-dependent spin splitting from broken inversion symmetry--is a crucial component for engineering topological superconductors (TSCs). However, time-reversal invariant TSCs based on conventional linear Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) are fundamentally restricted to a helical $p$-wave state, hosting only a single Majorana Kramers pair. In this Letter, we demonstrate that the unique triple-winding spin texture of cubic RSOC offers a direct pathway to surpass this limitation. We propose a bilayer model where the synergy of cubic RSOC and an intrinsic odd-parity pairing instability yields a rare 2D helical $f$-wave TSC. This state is characterized by a large mirror Chern number (MCN) ${\cal N}_{\text{M}}=3$ and hosts three Kramers pairs of Majorana edge modes. Furthermore, the interplay of linear and cubic RSOCs can yield a hybrid helical $p+f$-wave TSC with an even larger MCN of ${\cal N}_{\text{M}}=4$. Our work establishes higher-order spin-orbit coupling as a powerful design principle for realizing TSCs with multiple Majorana Kramers channels, holding immediate relevance for tunable platforms like oxide heterostructures.

Title: Dispersion of first sound in a weakly interacting ultracold Fermi liquid
Authors: Thomas Repplinger, Songtao Huang, Yunpeng Ji, Nir Navon, Hadrien Kurkjian
Abstract: At low temperature, a normal gas of unpaired spin-1/2 fermions is one of the cleanest realizations of a Fermi liquid. It is described by Landau's theory, where no phenomenological parameters are needed as the quasiparticle interaction function can be computed perturbatively in powers of the scattering length $a$, the sole parameter of the short-range interparticle interactions. Obtaining an accurate solution of the transport equation nevertheless requires a careful treatment of the collision kernel, {as the uncontrolled error made by the relaxation time approximations increases when the temperature $T$ drops below the Fermi temperature}. Here, we study sound waves in the hydrodynamic regime up to second order in the Chapman-Enskog's expansion. We find that the frequency $\omega_q$ of the sound wave is shifted above its linear departure as $\omega_q=c_1 q(1+\alpha q^2\tau^2)$ where $c_1$ and $q$ are the speed and wavenumber of the sound wave and the typical collision time $\tau$ scales as $1/a^2T^2$. Besides the shear viscosity, the coefficient $\alpha$ is described by a single second-order collision time which we compute exactly from an analytical solution of the transport equation, resulting in a positive dispersion $\alpha>0$. Our results suggest that ultracold atomic Fermi gases are an ideal experimental system for quantitative tests of second-order hydrodynamics.

Title: Local mobility variations along recrystallization boundaries
Authors: Jin Zhang, Yubin Zhang
Abstract: Understanding recrystallization boundary migration mechanisms is crucial for materials design. However, the lack of comprehensive mobility data for high-angle grain boundaries in typical polycrystalline samples has impeded gaining insights into the factors that govern boundary migration. Here, we propose an Iterative Mobility Matching (IMM) methodology to determine local mobility values and their spatial variations along recrystallization boundaries in partially recrystallized samples. This method optimizes mobility inputs in a phase field model by matching simulated microstructures with time-series recrystallization experiments. We first validate this method using synthetic data before applying it to real experimental data. For the first time, we reveal a three-order-magnitude variation in local mobility along individual recrystallization boundaries. The results show that local mobility depends strongly on boundary misorientation, and its variation significantly influences boundary dynamics, shedding light on the interplay of factors that impact the observed boundary migration behavior. The IMM methodology offers a new framework for interpreting experimental recrystallization behavior and can be broadly applied to other materials using in situ experiments.

Title: Supercurrent Time Division Multiplexing with Solid-State Integrated Hybrid Superconducting Electronics
Authors: Alessandro Paghi, Laura Borgongino, Simone Tortorella, Giorgio De Simoni, Elia Strambini, Lucia Sorba, Francesco Giazotto
Abstract: Time-division multiplexing of cryogenic signals is a promising approach to reduce space requirements, shorten cooldown times, and increase the number of quantum devices measured per cooldown. We demonstrate time-division multiplexing of non-dissipative supercurrents using voltage-controlled hybrid superconducting demultiplexers. These chips integrate superconducting Josephson Field Effect Transistors including Al superconducting electrodes, proximitized semiconducting InAs channels, and hafnium oxide gate insulators. Each transistor fully suppresses the switching current and increases the resistance 20 times under a gate voltage of -4.5 V. A demultiplexer with one input and eight outputs showed a non-dissipative input range of +-2 uA, operating up to 100 MHz in signal frequency and 100 kHz in switching frequency at 50 mK. It achieved near-zero insertion loss in the superconducting state and an ON/OFF ratio of 17.5 dB. By optimizing the signal layout, the operation was extended up to 4 GHz using a demultiplexer with two outputs.

Title: Post-measurement Quantum Monte Carlo
Authors: Kriti Baweja, David J. Luitz, Samuel J. Garratt
Abstract: We show how the effects of large numbers of measurements on many-body quantum ground and thermal states can be studied using Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC). Density matrices generated by measurement in this setting feature products of many local nonunitary operators, and by expanding these density matrices as sums over operator strings we arrive at a generalized stochastic series expansion (SSE). Our 'post-measurement SSE' is based on importance sampling of operator strings contributing to a measured thermal density matrix. We demonstrate our algorithm by probing the effects of measurements on the spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the square lattice. Thermal states of this system have SU(2) symmetry, and at first we preserve this symmetry by measuring SU(2) symmetric observables. We identify classes of post-measurement states for which correlations can be calculated efficiently, as well as states for which SU(2) symmetric measurements generate a QMC sign problem when working in any site-local basis. For the first class, we show how deterministic loop updates can be leveraged. Using our algorithm we demonstrate the creation of long-range Bell pairs and symmetry-protected topological order, as well as the measurement-induced enhancement of antiferromagnetic correlations. We then study the effects of measuring the system in a basis where the standard (unmeasured) SSE is sign-free: For measurement schemes with this property, we can calculate correlations in all post-measurement states without a sign problem. The method developed in this work opens the door to scalable experimental probes of measurement-induced collective phenomena, which require numerical estimates for the effects of measurements.

Title: Strong photon coupling to high-frequency antiferromagnetic magnons via topological surface states
Authors: Henrik T. Kaarbø, Henning G. Hugdal, Sol H. Jacobsen
Abstract: We show strong coupling between antiferromagnetic magnons and microwave cavity photons at both high and externally controllable magnon frequencies. Using the fully quantum mechanical path-integral method, we study an antiferromagnetic insulator (AFM) interfaced with a topological insulator (TI), taking Bi$_2$Se$_3$--MnSe as a representative example. We show that the mutual coupling of the spin-polarized surface states of the TI to both the squeezed magnons and the circularly polarized cavity photons results in a Chern-Simons term that activates the stronger electric, rather than magnetic, dipole coupling. Moreover, a squeezing-mediated enhancement of the coupling is achieved due to the unequal interfacial exchange coupling to the AFM sublattices, resulting in a coupling strength up to several orders stronger than for direct magnon-photon coupling. While direct cavity-AFM coupling has so far been limited in its applicability due to weak or low frequency coupling, this result may advance the utilization of high-frequency cavity magnonics and enable its incorporation into quantum information technology.

Title: From Flocking to Condensation: Collective Dynamics in Binary Chiral Active Matter
Authors: Divya Kushwaha, Shradha Mishra
Abstract: Many microswimmers are inherently chiral, and this chirality can introduce fascinating behaviors in a collection of microswimmers. The dynamics become even more intriguing when two types of microswimmers with distinct chirality are mixed. Our study examines a mixture of self-propelled particles with opposite chirality, investigating how the system's characteristics evolve as the magnitude of chirality is varied. In weakly chiral systems, the particles exhibit similar behavior, leading to a globally flocking phase where both types of particles are well-mixed. However, in an intermediate range of chirality, the condensates of different particles are formed as a result of a competition between chirality and self-propulsion. This competition results in interesting phases within the system. We explore the characteristics of these distinct phases in detail, focusing on the roles of self-propulsion speed and chirality.

Title: A Principled Basis for Nonequilibrium Network Flows
Authors: Ying-Jen Yang, Ken A. Dill
Abstract: The great power of EQuilibrium (EQ) statistical physics comes from its principled foundations: its First Law (conservation), Second Law (variational tendency principle), and its Legendre Transforms from observables $(U, V, N)$ to their driving forces $(T, p, \mu)$. Here, we generalize this structure to Non-EQuilibria (NEQ) in \textit{Caliber Force Theory} (CFT), replacing state entropies with path entropies; and $(U, V, N)$ with dynamic observables (node probabilities, edge traffics, and cycle fluxes). CFT derives dynamical forces and a complete set of conjugate relations: (i) It yields generalized Maxwell-Onsager relations, applicable far from equilibrium; (ii) It constructs dynamical models from mixed force-observable constraints; and (iii) It reveals new relationships -- including an ``equal-traffic'' rule for optimizing molecular motors, and a ``third Kirchhoff's law'' of stochastic transport -- and can resolve some dynamical paradoxes.

Title: Phase diagram and universal scaling regimes of two-dimensional exciton-polariton Bose-Einstein condensates
Authors: Félix Helluin, Daniela Pinto-dias, Quentin Fontaine, Sylvain Ravets, Jacqueline Bloch, Anna Minguzzi, Léonie Canet
Abstract: Many systems, classical or quantum, closed or open, exhibit universal statistical properties. Exciton-polariton condensates, being intrinsically driven-dissipative, offer a promising platform for observing non-equilibrium universal features. By conducting extensive numerical simulations of an incoherently pumped and interacting condensate coupled to an exciton reservoir we show that the effective nonlinearity of the condensate phase dynamics can be finely adjusted across a broad range, by varying the exciton-polariton interaction strength, allowing one to probe three main universal regimes with parameters accessible in current experiments: the weakly nonlinear Edwards-Wilkinson (EW) regime, where the phase fluctuations dominate, but the phase profile does not become rough, the strongly non-linear Kardar-Parisi-Zhang regime, where the condensate phase fluctuations grow in a superdiffusive manner leading to roughening of the phase, and a vortex-dominated phase emerging at stronger interactions, where both density and phase dynamics play significant roles. Our results provide a unified picture of the phase diagram of 2d exciton-polariton condensates under incoherent pumping, and shed light on recent experimental and numerical observations.

Abstract: We discuss the relation between p-adic numbers and kernels in view of a recent large deviation theory for mean-field spin glasses. As an application we show several fundamental properties of numerical bases in kernel language. In particular, we show that the Derrida's Generalized Random Energy Model can be interpreted as a (random) numerical base. We also show an application to the Primon gas and the Riemann Zeta Function.

Title: Non-relativistic linear Edelstein effect in helical EuIn2As2
Authors: Nayra A. Álvarez Pari, Rodrigo Jaeschke-Ubiergo, Atasi Chakraborty, Libor Šmejkal, Jairo Sinova
Abstract: Motivated by the ongoing interest in understanding the actual magnetic ground state of the promising axion insulator candidate EuIn2As2, we present here a spin symmetry analysis and ab-initio calculations, aiming to identify specific exchange-dominated physics that could offer insights into the current debate. We investigate two non-collinear coplanar magnetic orders reported in this compound: the helical and broken helical phases. Our symmetry analysis shows that magnetic-exchange alone results in the formation of an out-of-plane odd-wave order in momentum space with a single un-polarized nodal plane in both phases. Additionally, we identified an in-plane g-wave order that emerges exclusively in the broken helical phase, providing a distinguishing feature for this phase. Furthermore, we report a non-relativistic Edelstein effect with a distinct out-of-plane polarized spin density that dominates over spin-orbit coupling effects. Our ab-initio calculations reveal a significant contrast in the magnitude of this effect between both phases, which could serve as a means to identify the magnetic transition and distinguish them from other magnetic ground states proposed for this compound.

Title: Cluster dynamics in macroscopic photoactive particles
Authors: Sára Lévay, Axel Katona, Hartmut Löwen, Raúl Cruz Hidalgo, Iker Zuriguel
Abstract: We present an experimental study on the collective behavior of macroscopic self-propelled particles that are externally excited by light. This property allows testing the system response to the excitation intensity in a very versatile manner. We discover that for low excitation intensities, clustering at the boundaries is always present, even when this is prevented by implementing flower-shaped confining walls. For high excitation intensities, however, clusters are dissolved more or less easily depending on their size. Then, a thorough analysis of the cluster dynamics allows us to depict a phase diagram depending on the number of agents in the arena and the excitation intensity. To explain this, we introduce a simple kinetic model where cluster evolution is governed by a balance between adsorption and desorption processes. Interestingly, this simple model is able to reproduce the phase space observed experimentally.

Title: Impact of Josephson junction array modes on fluxonium readout
Authors: Shraddha Singh, Gil Refael, Aashish Clerk, Emma Rosenfeld
Abstract: Dispersive readout of superconducting qubits is often limited by readout-drive-induced transitions between qubit levels. While there is a growing understanding of such effects in transmon qubits, the case of highly nonlinear fluxonium qubits is more complex. We theoretically analyze measurement-induced state transitions (MIST) during the dispersive readout of a fluxonium qubit. We focus on a new mechanism: a simultaneous transition/excitation involving the qubit and an internal mode of the Josephson junction array in the fluxonium circuit. Using an adiabatic Floquet approach, we show that these new kinds of MIST processes can be relevant when using realistic circuit parameters and relatively low readout drive powers. They also contribute to excess qubit dephasing even after a measurement is complete. In addition to outlining basic mechanisms, we also investigate the dependence of such transitions on the circuit parameters. We find that with a judicious choice of frequency allocations or coupling strengths, these parasitic processes can most likely be avoided.

Title: Stabilization of active tissue deformation by a dynamic signaling gradient
Authors: Muhamet Ibrahimi, Matthias Merkel
Abstract: A key process during animal morphogenesis is oriented tissue deformation, which is often driven by internally generated active stresses. Yet, such active oriented materials are prone to well-known instabilities, raising the question of how oriented tissue deformation can be robust during morphogenesis. Here we study under which conditions active oriented deformation can be stabilized by the concentration pattern of a signaling molecule, which is secreted by a localized source region, diffuses across the tissue, and degrades. Consistent with earlier results, we find that oriented tissue deformation is always unstable in the gradient-contractile case, i.e. when active stresses act to contract the tissue along the direction of the signaling gradient, and we now show that this is true even in the limit of large diffusion. However, active deformation can be stabilized in the gradient-extensile case, i.e. when active stresses act to extend the tissue along the direction of the signaling gradient. Specifically, we show that gradient-extensile systems can be stable when the tissue is already elongated in the direction of the gradient. We moreover point out the existence of a formerly unknown, additional instability of the tissue shape change. This instability results from the interplay of active tissue shear and signal diffusion, and it indicates that some additional feedback mechanism may be required to control the target tissue shape. Taken together, our theoretical results provide quantitative criteria for robust active tissue deformation, and explain the lack of gradient-contractile systems in the biological literature, suggesting that the active matter instability acts as an evolutionary selection criterion.

Title: Observation of anisotropic dispersive dark exciton dynamics in CrSBr
Authors: J. Sears, B. Zager, W. He, C. A. Occhialini, Y. Shen, M. Lajer, J. W. Villanova, T. Berlijn, F. Yakhou-Harris, N. B. Brookes, D. G. Chica, X. Roy, E. Baldini, J. Pelliciari, V. Bisogni, S. Johnston, M. Mitrano, M. P. M. Dean
Abstract: Many-body excitons in CrSBr are attracting intense interest in view of their highly anisotropic magneto-optical coupling and their potential for novel optical interfaces within spintronic and magnonic devices. Characterizing the orbital character and propagation of these electronic excitations is crucial for understanding and controlling their behavior; however, this information is challenging to access. Ultra-high resolution resonant inelastic x-ray scattering is a momentum-resolved technique that can address these crucial questions. We present measurements collected at the Cr $L_3$-edge which show a rich spectrum of excitations with a variety of spin-orbital characters. While most of these excitations appear to be localized, the dispersion of the lowest energy dark exciton indicates that it is able to propagate along both the $a$ and $b$ directions within the planes of the crystal. This two-dimensional character is surprising as it contrasts with electrical conductivity and the behavior of the bright exciton, both of which are strongly one-dimensional. The discovery of this propagating dark exciton highlights an unusual coexistence of one- and two-dimensional electronic behaviors in CrSBr.

Abstract: Spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is one of the crucial factors that affect the chiral symmetry of matter by causing the spatial symmetry breaking of the system. We find that Raman-induced SOC can induce a chiral supersolid phase with a helical antiskyrmion lattice in balanced Rydberg-dressed two-component Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) in a harmonic trap by modulating the Raman coupling strength. This is in stark contrast to the mirror symmetric supersolid phase containing skyrmion-antiskyrmion lattice pair for the case of Rashba SOC. Two ground-state phase diagrams are presented as a function of the Rydberg interaction strength and the SOC strength, as well as that of the Rydberg interaction strength and the Raman coupling strength, respectively. It is shown that the interplay among Raman-induced SOC, Rydberg interactions, and nonlinear contact interactions favors rich ground-state structures, including half-quantum vortex phase, stripe supersolid phase, toroidal stripe phase with a central Anderson-Toulouse coreless vortex, checkerboard supersolid phase, mirror symmetric supersolid phase, chiral supersolid phase and standing-wave supersolid phase. In addition, the effects of rotation and in-plane quadrupole magnetic field on the ground state of the system are analyzed. In these two cases, the chiral supersolid phase is broken and the ground state tends to form a miscible phase. Furthermore, we demonstrate that when the initial state is a chiral supersolid phase the rotating harmonic trapped system sustains dissipative continuous time crystal by studying the rotational dynamic behaviors of the system.

Title: Variations of saturation vapor pressure and evaporation rate of liquids with their vaporization enthalpy
Authors: Xuefeng Xu, Chengzhi Yu, Liran Ma
Abstract: The phase transition enthalpy of condensed materials can be altered by factors such as electric fields, and such variations in turn affect physical and chemical behaviors including phase equilibrium. However, due to the neglect of non-expansion work, the Clapeyron equation does not account for the effect of changes in phase transition enthalpy on equilibrium. In this paper, by analyzing the electric-field-induced changes in phase transition enthalpy and incorporating the non-expansion work performed on the system, we extended both the Clapeyron and Clausius-Clapeyron equations to explicitly include variations in phase transition enthalpy. Building upon these extensions, analytical expressions for the vapor pressure of liquids and for the total evaporation rate of sessile liquid droplets as functions of the change in vaporization enthalpy have been derived, showing that an approximately 1% decrease in vaporization enthalpy of a liquid can cause an increase of about 20% in its vapor pressure and an almost twofold increase in its evaporation rate. The theoretical predictions by the present equations were compared and found to be in good agreement with the experimental observations.

Title: Observation of Orbital Hall Effect in Si

Abstract: Controlling/storing information carriers, such as electron charge and spin, is key for modern information society, and significant efforts have been paid made to establish novel technologies at the nanoscale. The rise of Si-based semiconductor technology and magnetism-based technology has been motivated by the aforementioned demands. However, both technologies have been individually developed, with little effort in fusing them. Hence, establishing a technology to bridge semiconductor and magnetism-based technologies that would allow realization of a novel information device is strongly awaited. In line with this research strategy, the creation of a magnetic device using semiconductors would enable fundamental innovation. Here, we show that a mother material for modern electronics, Si, gives rise to a room-temperature orbital Hall effect (OHE), enabling the creation of novel energy-efficient magnetic memory via efficient torque generation. The orbital torque efficiency {\xi}JDL of Si largely exceeds that of the archetypal metallic materials used in the OHE. Our achievement overturns the conventional understanding that nonmagnetic semiconductors cannot play a pivotal role in magnetic devices and paves a new avenue for creating novel information devices through the fusion of semiconductor and magnetism-based technologies.

Title: Prospects for market-specific design of Perovskite-Silicon tandem solar cells
Authors: Karthik Raitani, Pradeep R. Nair
Abstract: The quest for optimal perovskite for tandem cell configurations is challenging as it involves several factors ranging from device level performance under field conditions to degradation rates and cost. Here, we first highlight the limitations of traditional detailed balance or Shockley-Queisser (SQ) analysis towards the design of Perovskite/Silicon tandem solar cells. Through well-calibrated numerical simulations, we evaluate geographic location-specific annual energy yield (EY) and quantify the influence of temperature-dependent material and transport parameters. Our results indicate that the EY scales in a near-identical manner with the top cell band gap(EgT) for various geographic locations. In comparison to SQ analysis, our simulations predict a twofold relaxation in the target degradation rates at which perovskites over a broad range of band gaps could yield a comparable levelized cost of Energy (LCOE). These insights are of broad interest for the development of perovskite materials, and test protocols to evaluate the stability of Perovskite-Silicon tandem solar cells.

Title: Large Tunable Thermoelectric Effects in Superconducting Spin Valves with Commercially Available Materials
Authors: Pablo Tuero, Johanne Bratland Tjernshaugen, Carlos Sanchez, César Gonzalez-Ruano, Yuan Lu, Jacob Linder, Farkhad G. Aliev
Abstract: Recent studies have revealed magnetically controllable thermoelectric effects in superconductor/ferromagnet (S/F) structures. A tunable cryogenic thermoelectric generator needs not only a high conversion factor between electricity and heat, but also a large change in the thermoelectric output when switching the magnetic state of the device. However, the reported modifications in thermoelectric power are either minimal, involve superconductors with relatively low critical temperatures (below 1 K), or do not utilize commercially available spintronic materials. Here, we experimentally measure and numerically model thermoelectric effects in fully epitaxial F/S/F junctions based on commercially available, easily grown materials, as well as their dependence on the magnetic configuration of the F electrodes. We observe sizeable Seebeck coefficients for the parallel alignment of the ferromagnetic electrodes, reaching values of about $100$~$\mu$V/K. Importantly, we find a decrease of the thermoelectric signal of more than an order of magnitude when switching from a parallel to an antiparallel configuration, constituting a large thermoelectric spin-valve effect. Theoretical modeling based on a self-consistent non-equilibrium Keldysh-Usadel Green's function theory, combined with micromagnetic simulations, qualitatively reproduce the experimental findings. The thermoelectric effect is optimized when there is a large spin-dependent electron-hole asymmetry in the superconductor combined with spin-dependent transmission through the interfaces. These findings pave the way for the development of efficient and versatile cryogenic thermoelectric heat engines.

Title: Effects of altermagnetic order, strain and doping in RuO$_2$
Authors: Darshana Wickramaratne, Marc Currie, Shelby S. Fields, Cory D. Cress, Steven P. Bennett
Abstract: RuO$_2$, one of the most widely studied transition metal oxides, was recently predicted to host a novel form of collinear magnetic order referred to as altermagnetism. In this study we combine experiment (reflectance, transmittance, ellipsometry and Raman measurements) and first-principles calculations to elucidate the potential role of altermagnetic order, strain and doping on the optical and vibrational properties of RuO$_2$ grown on TiO$_2$ (001), (101) and (110) substrates. Our combined experimental and theoretical results point toward a nonmagnetic ground state as the most consistent description of the optical and vibrational properties of bulk RuO$_2$. RuO$_2$ strained to TiO$_2$ (001) remains nonmagnetic in our calculations. Straining to TiO$_2$ (110) stabilizes ferromagnetic and altermagnetic states that are nearly degenerate and both lower in energy than the nonmagnetic state. The relative energetic ordering of these states is highly sensitive to the level of strain and the choice of exchange-correlation approximation.

Title: Non-Abelian phases from the condensation of Abelian anyons
Authors: Misha Yutushui, Maria Hermanns, David F. Mross
Abstract: The observed fractional quantum Hall (FQH) plateaus follow a recurring hierarchical structure that allows an understanding of complex states based on simpler ones. Condensing the elementary quasiparticles of an Abelian FQH state results in a new Abelian phase at a different filling factor, and this process can be iterated \textit{ad infinitum}. We show that condensing clusters of the same quasiparticles into an Abelian state can instead realize non-Abelian FQH states. In particular, condensing quasiparticle pairs in the $\nu=\frac{2}{3}$ Laughlin state yields the anti-Pfaffian phase at half-filling. We moreover show that the successive condensation of Laughlin quasiparticles produces quantum Hall states whose fillings coincide with the most prominent plateaus in the first excited Landau level of GaAs. More generally, such condensation can realize any non-Abelian FQH state that admits a parton representation. This surprising result is supported by an exact analysis of explicit wavefunctions, field theory arguments, conformal-field theory constructions of trial states, and numerical simulations.

Title: Quantum geometry and local moment swapover in correlated graphene heterostructures
Authors: Niklas Witt, Siheon Ryee, Lennart Klebl, Jennifer Cano, Giorgio Sangiovanni, Tim O. Wehling
Abstract: Graphene-based multilayer systems serve as versatile platforms for exploring the interplay between electron correlation and topology, thanks to distinctive low-energy bands marked by significant quantum metric and Berry curvature from graphene's Dirac bands. Here, we investigate Mott physics and local spin moments in Dirac bands hybridized with a flat band of localized orbitals in functionalized graphene. Via hybridization control, a topological transition is realized between two symmetry-distinct site-selective Mott states featuring local moments in different Wyckoff positions, with a geometrically enforced metallic state emerging in between. We find that this geometrically controlled local moment ``swapover'' and associated metal-insulator physics may be realized through proximity coupling of epitaxial graphene on SiC(0001) with group IV intercalants, where the Mott state faces geometrical obstruction in the large-hybridization limit. Our work shows that chemically functionalized graphene provides a correlated electron platform, very similar to the topological heavy fermions in graphene moiré systems but at significantly enhanced characteristic energy scales.

Title: Spin-lattice relaxation of NV centers in nanodiamonds adsorbed on conducting and non-conducting surfaces
Authors: Izidor Benedičič, Yuri Tanuma, Žiga Gosar, Bastien Anézo, Mariusz Mrózek, Adam Wojciechowski, Denis Arčon
Abstract: The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in nanodiamonds can be utilized as low-cost, highly versatile quantum sensors for studying surface properties in condensed matter physics through the application of relaxometry protocols. For such applications, a detailed knowledge of the intrinsic relaxation processes of NV centers in nanodiamonds is necessary. Here, we study the spin-lattice relaxation rates of NV ensembles in nanodiamonds with average diameters of 40 nm and 3 $\mu$m between room temperature and $\sim$ 6 K. The NV relaxation curves fit to a stretched-exponential form with a stretching exponent $\alpha \approx 0.7$, implying the large distribution of relaxation times of individual centers within nanodiamonds. We determine the Orbach-like scattering on phonons as the leading relaxation mechanism. Finally, we discuss the viability of nanodiamonds as surface sensors when deposited on a metallic substrate and emphasize the need for well-controlled surface preparation techniques.

Title: Thermodynamic inference in molecular motors: a Martingale approach
Authors: Adrián Nadal-Rosa, Gonzalo Manzano
Abstract: Molecular motors are in charge of almost every process in the life cycle of cells, such as protein synthesis, DNA replication, and cell locomotion, hence being of crucial importance for understanding the cellular dynamics. However, given their size scales on the order of nanometers, direct measurements are rather challenging, and the information that can be extracted from them is limited. In this work, we propose strategies based on martingale theory in stochastic thermodynamics to infer thermodynamic properties of molecular motors using a limited amount of available information. In particular, we use two recent theoretical results valid for systems arbitrary far of equilibrium: the integral fluctuation theorem (IFT) at stopping times, and a family of bounds to the maximal excursions of entropy production. The potential of these strategies is illustrated with a simple model for the F1-ATPase rotary molecular motor, where our approach is able to estimate several quantities determining the thermodynamics of the motor, such as the rotational work of the motor performed against an externally applied force, or the effective environmental temperature.

Title: Collective mode spectroscopy in time-reversal symmetry breaking superconductors
Authors: Silvia Neri, Walter Metzner, Dirk Manske
Abstract: Time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB) superconductors show a rich collective mode spectrum. In general, collective excitations in superconductors can provide crucial information on the symmetry of the broken phase, in particular, serving as a fingerprint for determining the groundstate gap symmetry. In this work, we consider several even parity two-dimensional TRSB superconductors characterized by an order parameter of the form $\Delta = \Delta_1 + i\Delta_2$. We provide a classification scheme of the collective excitations in the above systems as a function of the ratio between the components $\Delta_1/\Delta_2$. In order to excite the modes in the systems we have adopted two different probes: a quench of the condensate symmetry and a finite momentum transfer induced by an external electric field. Both methods allow us to excite and characterize the different modes in the spectra. To further interpret the results of the numerical calculations we provide a Ginzburg-Landau analysis and we construct a dynamical theory, deriving the linearized equations of motion in the pseudospin formalism. Our results could help distinguish between different order parameters symmetries of a TRSB superconducting condensate and estimate the magnitude of its different components.

Title: A geometric one-fluid model of superfluid helium-4
Authors: Nadine Suzan Cetin, Michal Pavelka, Emil Varga
Abstract: A standard description of superfluid helium-4 is based on the concept of two components (superfluid and normal), which leads to the so called two-fluid models. However, as there are no two kinds of atoms in helium-4, the two components can not be separated. Superfluid helium-4 is not a mixture of two components, being rather a single fluid with two motions. Here, we present a geometric one-fluid model of superfluid helium-4, which is based on the Hamiltonian formulation of fluid mechanics. The model is derived from the kinetic theory of excitations (treated as an ideal Bose gas under the temperature $1.3K$) and average particle motions. It can be simplified to the Hall-Vinen-Bekharevich-Khalatnikov (HVBK) two-fluid model, where it removes one fitting parameter from the HVBK model, but it also gives extra terms beyond the HVBK model. Actually, we show that the two-fluid models are problematic in case of higher counter-flow velocities, where the usual splitting of total momentum to the superfluid and normal component becomes impossible. Finally, we show how vortex line density may be added to the state variables. The one-fluid model can be seen as a generalization of the two-fluid models that is geometrically consistent, fully compressible, with non-zero superfluid vorticity, and compatible with classical experiments.

Title: Collective Dynamics in Active Polar Polymer Assemblies
Authors: Hossein Vahid, Jens-Uwe Sommer, Abhinav Sharma
Abstract: Tangentially driven active polymers (TDAPs), model systems for motor-driven filaments, have been extensively studied in uniform activity fields. Here, we show that an activity gradient breaks fore-aft symmetry, generating net body forces that steer dimers, asters, and larger assemblies toward high-activity regions. Including temporal stochasticity softens the chains, allowing them to bend and wind around other filaments. Once several contacts are established, steric interlocking arrests relative motion and stabilizes the assembly into a hierarchically entangled cluster. These clusters persist for times far exceeding single-chain relaxation and do not appear under deterministic, temporally constant activity. Remarkably, such activity-induced gelation occurs even at polymer concentrations substantially lower than those typically required for passive chains. Our results reveal a new mechanism for activity-induced aggregation, providing new strategies for designing autonomous and reconfigurable microfluidic systems.

Title: Exact Results in Stochastic Processes with Division, Death, and Diffusion: Spatial Correlations, Marginal Entropy Production, and Macroscopic Currents
Authors: Samuel Cameron, Elsen Tjhung
Abstract: We consider a generic class of stochastic particle-based models whose state at an instant in time is described by a set of continuous degrees of freedom (e.g. positions), and the length of this set changes stochastically in time due to birth-death processes. Using a master equation formalism, we write down the dynamics of the corresponding (infinite) set of probability distributions: this takes the form of coupled Fokker-Planck equations with model-dependent source and sink terms. We derive the general expression of entropy production rate for this class of models in terms of path irreversibility. To demonstrate the practical use of this framework, we analyze a biologically motivated model incorporating division, death, and diffusion, where spatial correlations arise through the division process. By systematically integrating out excess degrees of freedom, we obtain the marginal probability distribution, enabling exact calculations of key statistical properties such as average density and correlation functions. We validate our analytical results through numerical Brownian dynamics simulations, finding excellent agreement between theory and simulation. Our method thus provides a powerful tool for tackling previously unsolved problems in stochastic birth-death dynamics.

Title: Boundary criticality for the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa models
Authors: Huan Jiang, Yang Ge, Shao-Kai Jian
Abstract: We study the boundary criticality for the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa (GNY) models. Employing interacting Dirac fermions on a honeycomb lattice with armchair boundaries, we use determinate quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) simulation to uncover rich boundary criticalities at the quantum phase transition to a charge-density-wave (CDW) insulator, including the ordinary, special, and extraordinary transitions. The Dirac fermions satisfy a Dirichlet boundary condition, while the boson field, representing the CDW order, obeys Dirichlet and Neumann conditions at the ordinary and special transitions, respectively, thereby enriching the critical GNY model. We develop a perturbative $4-\epsilon$ renormalization group approach to compute the boundary critical exponents. Our framework generalizes to other GNY universality class variants and provides theoretical predictions for experiments.

Title: Heterostructure Effects on the Magnetocrystalline Anisotropy Energy of MnN
Authors: Robert A. Lawrence, Matt I.J. Probert
Abstract: Thin film effects on the Magnetocrystalline Anisotropy Energy (MAE) of MnN were studied using density functional theory (DFT). Initially, strain effects on bulk MnN were considered as a proxy for lattice-matching induced strain and a linear relationship between the c/a ratio and the MAE was found. This relationship was explained in terms of underlying point group symmetry. Strain and charge-transfer effects were then considered for an ultra-thin film. It was found that a Ta seed-layer suppresses the net spin moment on the Mn ions, leading to a reduction of the MAE.

Title: A method to derive material-specific spin-bath model descriptions of materials displaying prevalent spin physics
Authors: Benedikt M. Schoenauer, Nicklas Enenkel, Florian G. Eich, Vladimir V. Rybkin, Michael Marthaler, Sebastian Zanker, Peter Schmitteckert
Abstract: Magnetism and spin physics are true quantum mechanical effects and their description usually requires multi reference methods and is often hidden in the standard description of molecules in quantum chemistry. In this work we present a twofold approach to the description of spin physics in molecules and solids. First, we present a method that identifies the single-particle basis in which a given subset of the orbitals is equivalent to spin degrees of freedom for models and materials which feature significant spin physics at low energies. We introduce a metric for the spin-like character of a basis orbital, of which the optimization yields the basis containing the optimum spin-like basis orbitals. Second, we demonstrate an extended Schrieffer-Wolff transformation method to derive the effective Hamiltonian acting on the subspace of the Hilbert space in which the charge degree of freedom of electron densities in the spin-like orbitals is integrated out. The method then yields an effective Hamiltonian describing spins coupled to a fermionic environment. This extended Schrieffer-Wolff transformation is applicable to a wide range of Hamiltonians and has been utilized in this work for model Hamiltonians as well as the Hamiltonian describing the active orbital space of molecular chromium bromide. This is achieved by reformulating the highly non-linear Schrieffer-Wolff equations into a linear set of equations corresponding to an operator basis.

Title: Topological signatures of collective dynamics and turbulent-like energy cascades in apolar active granular
Authors: Zihan Zheng, Cunyuan Jiang, Yangrui Chen, Matteo Baggioli, Jie Zhang
Abstract: Active matter refers to a broad class of non-equilibrium systems where energy is continuously injected at the level of individual ``particles". These systems exhibit emergent collective behaviors that have no direct thermal-equilibrium counterpart. Their scale ranges from micrometer-sized swarms of bacteria to meter-scale human crowds. In recent years, the role of topology and self-propelled topological defects in active systems has garnered significant attention, particularly in polar and nematic active matter. Building on these ideas, we investigate emergent collective dynamics in apolar active granular fluids. Using isotropic granular vibrators as a model experimental system of apolar active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particles in a dry environment, we uncover a distinctive three-stage time evolution arising from the intricate interplay between activity and inelastic interactions. By analyzing the statistics, spatial correlations, and dynamics of vortex-like topological defects in the displacement vector field, we demonstrate their ability to describe this intrinsic collective motion. Furthermore, associated to these topological defects, we reveal the onset of a turbulent-like inverse energy cascade, where kinetic energy transfers across different length scales over time. As the system evolves, the power scaling of the energy transfer increases with the duration of observation. Our findings show that topological concepts can be extended to the nonequilibrium dynamics of apolar active matter, revealing a direct link between microscopic topological processes and emergent large-scale behaviors in active granular fluids that lack both a well-defined direction of motion and an intrinsic axis of orientation at the particle scale.

Title: Towards data analysis with diagrammatics
Authors: Tobias Kühn
Abstract: Systems with many interacting stochastic constituents are fully characterized by their free energy. Computing this quantity is therefore the objective of various approaches, notably perturbative expansions, which are applied in problems ranging from high-dimensional statistics to complex systems. However, a lot of these techniques are complicated to apply in practice because they lack a sufficient organization of the terms of the perturbative series. In this manuscript, we tackle this problem by using Feynman diagrams, extending a framework introduced earlier to the case of free energies at fixed variances. This diagrammatics do not require the theory to expand around to be Gaussian, which allows its application to the free energy of a spin system studied to derive message-passing algorithms by Maillard et al. 2019. We complete their perturbative derivation of the free energy in the thermodynamic limit. Furthermore, we derive resummations to estimate the entropies of poorly sampled systems requiring only limited statistics and we revisit earlier approaches to compute the free energy of the Ising model, revealing new insights due to the extension of our framework to the free energy at fixed variances. We expect our approach to be particularly useful for problems of high-dimensional statistics, like matrix factorization, and the study of complex networks.

Title: A mesoscopic model for the rheology of dilute and semidilute solutions of wormlike micelles
Authors: Avishek Kumar, Rico F. Tabor, P.Sunthar, J. Ravi Prakash
Abstract: The concept of a `persistent worm' is introduced, representing the smallest possible length of a wormlike micelle, and modelled by a bead-spring chain with sticky beads at the ends. Persistent worms are allowed to combine with each other at their sticky ends to form wormlike micelles with a distribution of lengths, and the semiflexibility of a wormlike micelle is captured with a bending potential between springs, both within and across persistent worms that stick to each other. Multi-particle Brownian dynamics simulations of such polydisperse and `polyflexible' wormlike micelles, with hydrodynamic interactions included and coupled with reversible scission/fusion of persistent worms, are used to investigate the static and dynamic properties of wormlike micellar solutions in the dilute and unentangled semidilute concentration regimes. The influence of the sticker energy and persistent worm concentration are examined and simulations are shown to validate theoretical mean-field predictions of the universal scaling with concentration of the chain length distribution of linear wormlike micelles, independent of the sticker energy. The presence of wormlike micelles that form rings is shown not to affect the static properties of linear wormlike micelles and mean-field predictions of ring length distributions are validated. Linear viscoelastic storage and loss moduli are computed and the unique features in the intermediate frequency regime compared to those of homopolymer solutions are highlighted. The inclusion of hydrodynamic interactions (HI) enables the distinction between Rouse and Zimm dynamics in wormlike micelle solutions to be elucidated. While the neglect of HI is justified in the case of entangled wormlike micelle solutions, here the concentration at which the onset of the screening of hydrodynamic interactions occurs is clearly identified.

Title: Demonstration of highly scaled AlScN ferroelectric diode memory with storage density > 100 Mbit/mm$^2$

Abstract: Wurtzite nitride ferroelectric materials have emerged as promising candidates for next-generation memory applications due to their exceptional polarization properties and compatibility with conventional semiconductor processing techniques. Here, we demonstrate the first successful areal scaling of Aluminum Scandium Nitride (AlScN) ferroelectric diode (FeDiode) memory down to 40 nm device diameters while maintaining ON/OFF > 60. Using a 20 nm thick Al0.64Sc0.36N ferroelectric layer, we evaluate both metal-insulator-ferroelectric-metal (MIFM) and metal-ferroelectric-metal (MFM) architectures for scaled resistive memory devices. Our scaled devices exhibit an enhanced breakdown-to-coercive field ratio exceeding 2.6 due to increased breakdown field. The MIFM devices demonstrate stable 3-bit non-volatile multistate behavior with clearly distinguishable resistance states and retention exceeding 4*10^4 seconds at 85 C. By achieving more than a million-fold areal scaling with enhanced performance metrics, this work establishes AlScN-based FeDiode memory as a highly promising platform for non-volatile storage with potential for direct integration into CMOS technology.

Title: Fractonic Fractional Quantum Hall Effect
Authors: Justin Schirmann, Peru d'Ornellas, Adolfo G. Grushin
Abstract: In non-interacting systems, disorder can drive a trivial phase into a topological one. However little is known how to construct a fractional quantum Hall ground-state, a paradigmatic topologically ordered state, that exists both in crystalline and disordered lattices and is qualitatively different to known topological phases. Here, we propose a general method for building such a phase. This is done by coupling quantum wires placed aperiodically in real-space, where the spatial positioning allows us to tune the inter-wire couplings. We call the emergent phase the Fractonic Fractional Quantum Hall Effect as it displays a rich interplay of fractional quantum Hall physics with fractonic constraints, formed by coupling differently-fractionalised wires into a globally gapped phase. The ground state has an exponential degeneracy in system size, a signature of the emergence of fractons. It displays a rich phenomenology of excitations, which can either behave like anyons confined to move in one dimension (lineons), multiples of which can then hop between two wires (s-lineons) or be free to travel across the system (C-anyons), depending on the multiplicity. Both the ground state degeneracy and mutual statistics are directly determined by the real-space positions of the wires, which can be disordered. Our method provides an analytically solvable pathway to non-crystalline fractional quantum Hall effects and fractonic theories in two-dimensions, examples of which were lacking.

Title: Friedel oscillations in a two-dimensional electron gas and monolayer graphene with a non-Coulomb impurity potential
Authors: Levente Máthé, Ioan Grosu
Abstract: We study Friedel oscillations in a two-dimensional non-interacting electron gas and in a monolayer graphene in the presence of a single impurity. The potential generated by the impurity is modeled using a non-Coulomb interaction ($\sim r^{-\eta}$). The charge carrier density deviation as a function of distance from the impurity is calculated within the linear response theory. Our results show that, in both a two-dimensional non-interacting electron gas and graphene, the phase of charge carrier density oscillations remains unaffected by the parameter $\eta$, which characterizes the non-Coulomb nature of the interaction, at large distances from the impurity. The parameter $\eta$ influences only the amplitude of the oscillations in this regime. The results for an impurity modeled by Coulomb-like potential ($\eta = 1$) are recovered in both cases.

Title: Partons from stabilizer codes
Authors: Rafael A. Macedo, Carlo C. Bellinati, Weslei B. Fontana, Eric C. Andrade, Rodrigo G. Pereira
Abstract: The Gutzwiller projection of fermionic wave functions is a well-established method for generating variational wave functions describing exotic states of matter, such as quantum spin liquids. We investigate the conditions under which a projected wave function constructed from fermionic partons can be rigorously shown to possess topological order. We demonstrate that these conditions can be precisely determined in the case of projected Majorana stabilizer codes. We then use matrix product states to study states that interpolate between two distinct Majorana fermion codes, one yielding a $\mathbb Z_2$ spin liquid and the other a trivial polarized state upon projection. While the free-fermion states are adiabatically connected, we find that the projected states undergo a phase transition detected by the topological entanglement entropy. Our work underscores the profound impact of the Gutzwiller projection and cautions against inferring properties of quantum spin liquids solely from their unprojected counterparts.

Title: Generic (fractional) quantum anomalous Hall crystals from interaction-driven band folding
Authors: Hongyu Lu, Han-Qing Wu, Bin-Bin Chen, Wang Yao, Zi Yang Meng
Abstract: Among the extensive studies of fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) states, there recently appears a growing interest in the topological states with coexisting charge density wave (CDW) orders. Such states are referred to as Hall crystals. However, compared to those with integer Hall conductivities, the FQAH crystal (FQAHC) is still elusive even at the level of microscopic model. In this work, we numerically study a topological flat-band model on triangular lattice with spinless fermions. At fractional filling of the Chern band, the nearest-neighbor interaction leads to a commensurate and topologically trivial CDW state. Interestingly, the folded mini-band above the CDW gap is non-trivial, and we focus on the doping of it without any projection. A series of (F)QAHC states at (fractional) integer fillings of this mini-band are discovered and some FQAHC state might even exist in less "ideal" conditions. The ground-state degeneracies of such (F)QAHC states are enlarged by the CDW degeneracy and the Hall conductivities -- determined by the fillings of the mini-band -- are different from the fillings of the original Chern band. We also study the thermodynamics of an FQAHC state and find a compressible CDW phase at intermediate temperatures, which might serve as a precursor of lower temperature FQAHC phase. Moreover, we numerically demonstrate that such a generic scheme of doping CDW-folded topological mini-band could be applied to bosonic systems, broadening the platforms of Hall-crystal physics and motivating its exploration in quantum moire and cold-atom systems.

Title: Low-energy effective Hamiltonian and end states of an inverted HgTe nanowire
Authors: Rui Li
Abstract: The band inversion transition in a cylindrical HgTe nanowire is inducible via varying the nanowire radius. Here we derive the low-energy effective Hamiltonian describing the band structure of the HgTe nanowire close to the fundamental band gap. Because both the $E_{1}$ and $H_{1}$ subbands have quadratic dependence on $k_{z}$ when the gap closes, we need to consider at least three subbands, i.e., the $E_{1}$, $H_{1}$, and $H_{2}$ subbands, in building the effective Hamiltonian. The resulting effective Hamiltonian is block diagonal and each block is a $3\times3$ matrix. End states are found in the inverted regime when we solve the effective Hamiltonian with open boundary condition.

Title: Oxyfluoride glasses obtained through incorporation of CaF$_2$ into photovoltaic cover glass melts

Abstract: The glass industry has limited options to mitigate its environmental footprint, and the demand for cover glass to produce photovoltaic panels is increasing. Currently, the majority of this special type of glass is not being recycled, and in this work, we propose to reuse it as raw material to obtain oxyfluoride glasses. The incorporation of CaF$_2$ and the increasing Na$_2$CO$_3$ content resulted in a melting temperature of about 1200$^o$C, significantly lower than in soda-lime glasses, which adds up to the environmental benefits of reusing end-of-life cover glass. The obtained samples show high transparency and thermal stability, allowing the cover glass to make up to 80\% of its weight. XRF analysis was employed to determine the elemental composition of the samples, while XRD and Raman indicated that by adding CaF$_2$, the glass network was depolymerized. In situ XRD as a function of temperature showed the formation of a few crystalline phases in these oxyfluoride samples, evidencing that it can be explored as a matrix to obtain different glass-ceramics. The combination of the glass properties indicates that this method and the resulting material can contribute to reducing the environmental impact of the glass industry, by creating new glass or glass-ceramic materials that can be obtained at a reduced temperature compared to the soda-lime glass, while cover glass being the primary raw material could reduce the need to extract minerals from nature.

Title: Current Conservation in the Self-Consistent Josephson Junction
Authors: Simon Krekels, Vukan Levajac, Kristof Moors, George Simion, Bart Sorée
Abstract: Conventional treatments of Josephson junctions (JJs) are typically not current-conserving. In the mean-field BCS theory, current conservation is only guaranteed if the superconducting order parameter is treated self-consistently. We show that this requirement has significant consequences for the current-phase relation (CPR) in certain regimes, where the current density in the superconducting leads is non-negligible. To this end, we introduce a numerical method for the self-consistent treatment of the BdG equations with current conservation for quasi-1D superconductor-normal (metal)-superconductor (SNS) JJs. Our model incorporates a phase gradient of the order parameter in the leads, which is set to match the Josephson current through the weak link. We compare our method to standard, non-current-conserving approaches by calculating the CPR for SNS JJs while varying lengths and gate voltages controlling the normal metal. We show that current conservation has significant implications for the Josephson harmonics and can weaken or even reverse forward skewness of the CPR.

Lindenberg, Long-Qing Chen, John W. Freeland, Jirka Hlinka, Venkatraman Gopalan, Haidan Wen
Abstract: Unraveling collective modes arising from coupled degrees of freedom is crucial for understanding complex interactions in solids and developing new functionalities. Unique collective behaviors emerge when two degrees of freedom, ordered on distinct length scales, interact. Polar skyrmions, three-dimensional electric polarization textures in ferroelectric superlattices, disrupt the lattice continuity at the nanometer scale with nontrivial topology, leading to previously unexplored collective modes. Here, using terahertz-field excitation and femtosecond x-ray diffraction, we discovered subterahertz collective modes, dubbed 'skyrons', which appear as swirling patterns of atomic displacements functioning as atomic-scale gearsets. Momentum-resolved time-domain measurements of diffuse scattering revealed an avoided crossing in the dispersion relation of skyrons. We further demonstrated that the amplitude and dispersion of skyrons can be controlled by sample temperature and electric-field bias. Atomistic simulations and dynamical phase-field modeling provided microscopic insights into the three-dimensional crystallographic and polarization dynamics. The discovery of skyrons and their coupling with terahertz fields opens avenues for ultrafast control of topological polar structures.

Title: Thermodynamics of the $S=1/2$ maple-leaf Heisenberg antiferromagnet
Authors: Taras Hutak
Abstract: The Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the maple-leaf lattice has recently gathered a great deal of attention. Competition between three nonequivalent bond interactions results in various ground-state quantum phases, the exact dimer-product singlet ground state being among them. The thermodynamic properties of this model are much less understood. We used high-temperature expansion up to the $18$th order to study the thermodynamics of the $S=1/2$ Heisenberg model on the uniform maple-leaf lattice with the ground state exhibiting a six-sublattice $120^{\circ}$ long-range magnetic order. Padé approximants allow us to get reliable results up to the temperatures of about $T\approx 0.4$. To study thermodynamics for arbitrary temperatures, we made the interpolation using the entropy method. Based on the analysis of close Padé approximants, we find ground-state energy $e_{0}=-0.53064\ldots -0.53023$ in good agreement with numerical results. The specific heat $c(T)$ has a typical maximum at rather low temperatures $T\approx0.379$ and the uniform susceptibility $\chi(T)$ at $T\approx0.49$. We also estimate the value of $\chi(T)$ at zero temperature $\chi_{0}\approx0.05\ldots0.06$. The ground-state order manifests itself in the divergence of the so-called generalized Wilson ratio.

Title: Role of Friction on the Formation of Confined Granular Structures
Authors: Vinícius Pereira da S. Oliveira, Danilo S. Borges, Erick M. Franklin, Jorge Peixinho
Abstract: Unstable systems of fluidized grains in a very-narrow vertical tube can auto-defluidize after some time, the settling particles forming either a glass- or crystal-like structure. We carried out experiments using different polymer spheres, of known friction and roughness, fluidized in water. A diagram was obtained for the \RefereeA{shell-settled} particles when the coefficient of friction is of the order of 0.1, and their structure is characterized through an analysis of the nearest neighbors' angles. We show that the level of velocity fluctuations is higher for the high friction material, and that, once defluidized, the decrease in the coefficient of sliding friction leads to more organized (crystal-like) structures, while those with higher friction coefficients are amorphous (glass-like structures). Our results bring new insights for understanding the formation of glass- and crystal-like structures based on the material surface properties.

Title: Coupling an elastic string to an active bath: the emergence of inverse damping
Authors: Aaron Beyen, Christian Maes, Ji-Hui Pei
Abstract: We consider a slow elastic string with Klein-Gordon dynamics coupled to a bath of run-and-tumble particles. We derive and solve the induced Langevin-Klein-Gordon string dynamics with explicit expressions for the streaming term, friction coefficient, and noise variance. These parameters are computed exactly in a weak coupling expansion. The induced friction is a sum of two terms: one entropic, proportional to the noise variance as in the Einstein relation for a thermal equilibrium bath, and a frenetic contribution that can take both signs. The frenetic part wins for higher bath persistence, making the total friction negative, and hence creating a wave instability akin to inverse Landau damping. However, this acceleration decreases and eventually disappears when the propulsion speed of the active particles becomes much higher. Detailed simulations confirm the initial growth driven by this anti-damping.

Title: Critical and Nonpercolating Phases in Bond Percolation on the Song-Havlin-Makse Network
Authors: Kazuki Wataya, Takehisa Hasegawa
Abstract: We investigate bond percolation on the Song-Havlin-Makse (SHM) network, a scale-free tree with a tunable degree exponent and dimensionality. Using a generating function approach, we analytically derive the average size and the fractal exponent of the root cluster for deterministic cases. Our analysis reveals that bond percolation on the SHM network remains in a nonpercolating phase for all $p < 1$ when the network is fractal (i.e., finite-dimensional), whereas it exhibits a critical phase, where the cluster size distribution follows a power-law with a $p$-dependent exponent, throughout the entire range of $p$ when the network is small-world (i.e., infinite-dimensional), regardless of the specific dimensionality or degree exponent. The analytical results are in excellent agreement with Monte Carlo simulations.

Title: Localized surface plasmons in a Weyl semimetal nanosphere
Authors: Francesco M. D. Pellegrino, Francesco Buccheri, G. G. N. Angilella
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the localized surface plasmon modes of a sub-wavelength spherical nanoparticle composed of a Weyl semimetal, taking into account the axion modification of electrodynamics. We derive analytical solutions for dipole and quadrupole normal modes by employing the quasistatic approximation. The axion term leads to modified Fröhlich conditions, resulting in multiple non-degenerate plasmonic resonances with distinct polarization dependencies. In contrast to isotropic conventional metals, the magnetoelectric properties of Weyl semimetals enable an incident electromagnetic field, with the electric field transverse to the surface of the sphere, to excite a localized surface plasmon.

Title: Relaxation pathways and emergence of domains in square artificial spin ice
Authors: Matteo Menniti, Naëmi Leo, Pedro Villalba-González, Matteo Pancaldi, and Paolo Vavassori
Abstract: Multi-domain states of square artificial spin ice show a range of different morphologies ranging from simple stripe-like domains to more organically shaped coral domains. To model the relevant dynamics leading to the emergence of such diverse domain structures, simplified descriptions of the switching behavior of individual nanomagnets are necessary. In this work, we employ kinetic Monte Carlo simulations of the demagnetization of square artificial spin ice toward its ground state, and compare how the choice of transition barriers affect the emergence of mesoscale domains. We find that the commonly used mean-field barrier model (informed by equilibrium energetics only) results in propagation of ground-state string avalanches. In contrast, taking into account chiral barrier splitting enabled by state-dependent local torques supports the emergence of complex-shaped coral domains and their successful relaxation towards the ground state in later relaxation stages. Our results highlight that intrinsic contributions to switching barriers, in addition to the effect of extrinsic defects often attributed to nanofabrication irregularities, can subtly shift favored transition pathways and result in different emergent mesoscale features. Future kinetic Monte Carlo models that describe the evolution of artificial spin systems should thus account for these effects.

Title: Missing link between the 2D Quantum Hall problem and 1D quasicrystals
Authors: Anuradha Jagannathan
Abstract: This paper discusses a connection between two important classes of materials, namely quasicrystals and topological insulators as exemplified by the Quantum Hall problem. It has been remarked that the quasicrystal ``inherits" topological properties from the 2D Quantum Hall model. We show this explicitly by introducing the Fibonacci-Hall model as a link between a 1D quasicrystal and the magnetic problems. We show here how Chern numbers for bands in periodic approximants of quasicrystals can be computed, along with gap labels. The Chern numbers are thus seen as a consequence of a flux parameter $\phi^S$ induced by the geometry of winding in 2D space of the quasicrystal. We show the existence of lines of Lifshitz transitions in the phase space of the model. These are marked by change of Chern number and disappearance of edge states. The proposed extrapolation method can be generalized to higher dimensional 2D and 3D quasicrystals, where higher order Chern numbers could be computed, and related to experimentally measurable transport quantities.

Title: Floquet Möbius topological insulators
Authors: Longwen Zhou, Fan Zhang, Jiaxin Pan
Abstract: Möbius topological insulators have dispersive edge bands with Möbius twists in momentum space, which are protected by the combination of chiral and $Z_2$-projective translational symmetries. In this work, we reveal a unique type of Möbius topological insulator, whose edge bands could twist around the quasienergy $\pi$ of a periodically driven system and are thus of Floquet origin. By applying time-periodic quenches to an experimentally realized Möbius insulator model, we obtain interconnected Möbius edge bands around zero and $\pi$ quasienergies, which can coexist with a gapped or gapless bulk. These Möbius bands are topologically characterized by a pair of generalized winding numbers, which are integer-quantized due to an emergent chiral symmetry at a high-symmetry point in momentum space. Numerical investigations of the quasienergy and entanglement spectra provide consistent evidence for the presence of such Möbius topological phases. A protocol based on the adiabatic switching of edge-band populations is further introduced to dynamically characterize the topology of Floquet Möbius edge bands. Our findings thus extend the scope of Möbius topological phases to nonequilibrium settings and unveil a unique class of Möbius-twisted topological edge states without static counterparts.

Title: Three-Majorana Cotunneling Interferometer for Non-Abelian Braiding and Topological Quantum Gate Implementation
Authors: Zhen Chen, Yijia Wu, X. C. Xie
Abstract: We propose a novel scheme for performing Majorana zero mode (MZM) braiding utilizing cotunneling processes in a three-MZM system incorporating reference arms. This approach relies on the interference between cotunneling paths through the MZMs and reference arms, establishing an effective, tunable coupling between the MZMs. The strength and sign of this coupling can be manipulated via the reference arms and applied magnetic flux. Notably, the introduction of a half quantum flux reverses the coupling sign, enabling an echo-like protocol to eliminate dynamic phases during braiding. Our setup, requiring only three MZMs, represents a minimal platform for demonstrating non-Abelian braiding statistics. We demonstrate that this system facilitates the implementation of Clifford gates via braiding and, significantly, permits the realization of non-Clifford gates, such as the $T$ gate, by geometric phase, thereby offering a potential pathway towards universal topological quantum computation.

Title: Tensor network method for real-space topology in quasicrystal Chern mosaics
Authors: Tiago V. C. Antão, Yitao Sun, Adolfo O. Fumega, Jose L. Lado
Abstract: Computing topological invariants in two-dimensional quasicrystals and super-moire matter is a remarkable open challenge, due to the absence of translational symmetry and the colossal number of sites inherent to these systems. Here, we establish a method to compute local topological invariants of exceptionally large systems using tensor networks, enabling the computation of invariants for Hamiltonians with hundreds of millions of sites, several orders of magnitude above the capabilities of conventional methodologies. Our approach leverages a tensor-network representation of the density matrix using a Chebyshev tensor network algorithm, enabling large-scale calculations of topological markers in quasicrystalline and moire systems. We demonstrate our methodology with two-dimensional quasicrystals featuring $C_8$ and $C_{10}$ rotational symmetries and mosaics of Chern phases. Our work establishes a powerful method to compute topological phases in exceptionally large-scale topological systems, providing the required tool to rationalize generic supe-moire and quasicrystalline topological matter.

Title: Strain-Induced Half-Metallicity and Giant Wiedemann-Franz Violation in Monolayer NiI$_2$
Authors: J. W. González, L. Rosales
Abstract: Reversible control of spin-dependent thermoelectricity via mechanical strain provides a platform for next-generation energy harvesting and thermal logic circuits. Using first-principles and Boltzmann transport calculations, we demonstrate that monolayer NiI$_2$ undergoes a strain-driven semiconductor-to-half-metal transition, enabled by the selective closure of its spin-down band gap while preserving a robust ferromagnetic ground state. Remarkably, this transition is accompanied by a giant, non-monotonic violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law, with the Lorenz number enhanced up to $7.17\,L_0$. This anomaly arises from a strain-sensitive hybridization between Ni-$d$ and I-$p$ orbitals, leading to spin-polarized transport channels and decoupling of heat and charge currents. These properties make NiI$_2$ a promising candidate for mechanically gated spin-caloritronic devices and thermal logic elements, where reversible control of heat and spin flow is essential. Our findings position NiI$_2$ as a model system for exploring non-Fermi-liquid transport and for realizing strain-tunable, energy-efficient functionalities in low-dimensional platforms.

Title: Temperature-Noise Interplay in a Coupled Model of Opinion Dynamics
Authors: Anna Chmiel, Julian Sienkiewicz
Abstract: We consider a coupled system mimicking opinion formation under the influence of a group of $q$ neighbors ($q$-lobby) that consists of an Ising part governed by temperature-like parameter $T$ and a voter dynamics parameterized by noise probability $p$ (independence of choice). Using rigorous analytical calculations backed by extensive Monte Carlo simulations, we examine the interplay between these two quantities. Based on the theory of phase transitions, we derive the relation between $T$ and $p$ at the critical line dividing the ordered and disordered phases, which takes a very simple and generic form $T(p-a)=b$ in the high temperature limit. For specific lobby sizes, we show where the temperature and noise are balanced, and we hint that for large $q$, the temperature-like dynamics prevails.

Title: Light-induced localized vortices in multicomponent Bose-Einstein condensates
Authors: Y. Braver, D. Burba, S. S. Nair, G. Žlabys, E. Anisimovas, Th. Busch, G. Juzeliūnas
Abstract: We study continuous interaction of a trapped two-component Bose-Einstein condensate with light fields in a $\Lambda$-type configuration. Using light beams with orbital angular momentum, we theoretically show how to create a stable, pinned vortex configuration, where the rotating component is confined to the region surrounded by the second, non-rotating component. The atoms constituting this vortex can be localized in volumes much smaller than the volume occupied by the second component. We also show that the vortex position can be changed dynamically by moving the laser beams, provided the beams' movement speed remains below the speed of sound. This allows us to use the localized vortex to stir the second component, and to determine the superfluid flow's critical velocity.

Title: Precise quantum-geometric electronic properties from first principles
Authors: José Luís Martins, Carlos Loia Reis, Ivo Souza
Abstract: The calculation of quantum-geometric properties of Bloch electrons -- Berry curvature, quantum metric, orbital magnetic moment and effective mass -- was implemented in a pseudopotential plane-wave code. The starting point was the first derivative of the periodic part of the wavefunction psi_k with respect to the wavevector k. This was evaluated with perturbation theory by solving a Sternheimer equation. Comparison of effective masses obtained from perturbation theory for silicon and gallium arsenide with carefully-converged numerical second derivatives of band energies confirms the high precision of the method. Calculations of quantum-geometric quantities for gapped graphene were performed by adding a bespoke symmetry-breaking potential to first-principles graphene. As the two bands near the opened gap are reasonably isolated, the results could be compared with those obtained from an analytical two-band model, allowing to assess the strengths and limitations of such widely-used models. The final application was trigonal tellurium, where quantum-geometric quantities flip sign with chirality.

Abstract: In this paper, the tunneling mechanism of cavitation in liquid helium for 3He and 4He is considered on the basis of the Schrödinger-like equation. It is assumed that the pairwise interactions of helium atoms are determined by the Lennard-Jones potential. The kinetics of nucleation and the mechanism that limits the growth of cavitation bubbles in liquid helium are considered, taking into account their growth in a negative pressure field.

Title: Thermal SU(2) lattice gauge theory of the cuprate pseudogap: reconciling Fermi arcs and hole pockets
Authors: Harshit Pandey, Maine Christos, Pietro M. Bonetti, Ravi Shanker, Sayantan Sharma, Subir Sachdev
Abstract: The cuprate pseudogap phase displays Fermi arc spectral weight in photoemission, while recent magnetotransport observations present clear evidence for the existence of hole pockets. We reconcile these observations by a Monte Carlo study of a SU(2) lattice gauge theory of the background spin liquid of a fractionalized Fermi liquid of hole pockets. At the higher temperatures of the pseudogap, the inevitable finite-doping sign problem can be evaded by including only thermal fluctuations of the SU(2) gauge field and a charge $e$ Higgs boson, while the fermionic critical Dirac spinons and electrons are treated exactly. Our study also describes the onset of $d$-wave superconductivity by expulsion of vortices with flux $h/(2e)$, each with charge-order halos.

Title: Photogalvanic effect in hydrodynamic flows of nonreciprocal electron liquids
Authors: E. Kirkinis, L. Bonds, A. Levchenko, A. V. Andreev
Abstract: We study nonlinear hydrodynamic electron transport driven by an AC electric field. In noncentrosymmetric conductors with broken time-reversal (TR) symmetry the nonlinear flow of such liquids is nonreciprocal, giving rise to a DC current $I^{DC}$ that is quadratic in the amplitude of the AC electric field. This is the hydrodynamic analogue of the linear photogalvanic effect (PGE), which arises in bulk noncentrosymmetric materials with broken TR symmetry. The magnitude of $I^{DC}$ depends on both the properties of the electron fluid and the geometry of the flow, and may be characterized by two dimensionless parameters: the nonreciprocity number $\mathcal{N}$, and the frequency-dependent vibrational number $\mathcal{R}$. Due to nonlocality of hydrodynamic transport, at low frequencies of the AC drive, $I^{DC}$ is super-extensive. The AC component of the electric current is likewise strongly affected by nonreciprocity: the hysteretic current-voltage dependence becomes skewed, which can be interpreted in terms of nonreciprocity of the memory retention time.

Title: Quantum transport calculations: An effective medium theory based on the projector augmented wave method with the plane-wave basis
Authors: Yi-Cheng Lin, Ken-Ming Lin, Yu-Chang Chen
Abstract: We present an effective medium theory based on density functional theory that is implemented in VASP using the PAW method with a plane wave basis set. The transmission coefficient is derived through three complementary approaches: the current density relation J=nqv, the field operator method, and the nonquilibrium Green's function formalism. We compare transmission coefficients calculated using EMT-PW with results from NEGF-DFT, based on the NanoDCAL package utilizing a linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) basis set, for both periodic and nonperiodic boundary conditions. The minor discrepancies observed are attributed to differences in basis sets, pseudopotentials, and the treatment of lead regions. Notably, the EMT-PW framework avoids the common issue of overcompleteness encountered in non-equilibrium transport theories and allows for the decomposition of the total transmission coefficient into contributions from individual eigenstates. Furthermore, when combined with an effective gate model, EMT-PW is shown to be a powerful tool for analyzing current characteristics in nanodevices under applied gate voltages. By leveraging one-electron wavefunctions in eigenstates, this method provides a robust foundation for exploring the quantum statistics of electrons and current quantum correlations within the second quantization framework.

Title: Exotic collective dynamics in molten Carbon
Authors: Taras Bryk, Giancarlo Ruocco, Jean-François Wax, Noël Jakse
Abstract: Collective longitudinal and transverse propagating modes in molten Carbon at $T=5500$~K and pressure range $10$-$40$ GPa are reported from {\it ab initio} based as well as machine learned molecular dynamics. A striking exotic feature in collective dynamics is the two-peak shape of the current spectral functions of the single-component liquid, which makes evidence of a second branch of longitudinal propagating modes in the wave number range $k>1$Å$^{-1}$. It is shown that time correlation functions reflecting the out-of-phase motion of particles and their cages of nearest neighbors results in the same frequencies of the exotic low-frequency branch of vibrations. A theoretical framework of generalized collective modes is applied to recover the time dependence of density-density, imaginary part of susceptibility and longitudinal current-current correlations.

Title: Thermodynamic theory of square skyrmion lattice in tetragonal frustrated antiferromagnets
Authors: Oleg I. Utesov, Danila P. Budylev
Abstract: High-temperature part of the phase diagram of tetragonal frustrated antiferromagnets is discussed within the framework of the mean-field approach. Based on recent experimental findings, we generalize previous theoretical studies by considering a model that includes frustrated Heisenberg exchange, biquadratic exchange, magnetodipolar interaction, anisotropic exchange, and single-ion anisotropy. It is analytically demonstrated that a subtle interplay among these interactions results in a variety of phase diagrams in the temperature-magnetic field plane. We argue that one of the proposed diagrams reproduces all crucial features of the phase diagram experimentally observed for~\gdru~compound. Besides magnetodipolar interaction and additional easy-axis contribution, it requires moderate biquadratic exchange. We show that despite the remarkable square skyrmion lattice being stable even if only magnetodipolar interaction/compass anisotropy or biquadratic exchange is included, their ``symbiosis'' allows for greatly enhancing its stability region. It is also demonstrated that higher-order harmonics play an important role in the stabilization of the square skyrmion lattice. The developed analytical approach can be useful for the refinement of the microscopic model parameters when comparing its predictions with experimental findings.

Title: Temperature Dependent Mechanical and Structural Properties of Uniaxially Strained Planar Graphene
Authors: Sané Erasmus, Charalampos Skokos, George Kalosakas
Abstract: Using molecular dynamics simulations in a planar graphene sheet, we investigate the temperature dependence of its mechanical behavior under uniaxial tensile stress applied either along the armchair or the zigzag direction. Stress-strain curves are calculated for different temperatures and the corresponding dependence of various elastic parameters, like the Young modulus, the third-order elastic modulus, the tensile strength and failure strain, is presented. Fracture stress and strain, as well as the Young modulus, decrease almost linearly with temperature. The distributions of bond lengths and bond angles at different strains and temperatures are also discussed and approximate analytical expressions are presented. The latter describe accurately the numerically obtained distributions.

Title: Thermal Hall transport in Kitaev spin liquids
Authors: Tsuyoshi Okubo, Joji Nasu, Takahiro Misawa, Yukitoshi Motome
Abstract: We investigate the thermal Hall conductivity in the Kitaev model with additional interactions under a magnetic field, employing a finite-temperature tensor network method benchmarked by a thermal pure quantum state technique. We find that the thermal Hall conductivity divided by temperature, $\kappa_{xy}/T$, significantly overshoots the value of the half-integer quantization and exhibits a pronounced hump while decreasing temperature. Moreover, we show that the field-direction dependence of $\kappa_{xy}/T$ is consistent with the sign of the Chern number associated with the Majorana fermions across a wide range of magnetic fields. We also demonstrate that the additional off-diagonal interactions, known as the $\Gamma$ and $\Gamma^{\prime}$ terms, considerably affect $\kappa_{xy}/T$. In particular, we show that positive $\Gamma$ and negative $\Gamma^{\prime}$ lead to a remarkable enhancement in the intermediate temperature region. From the comparison with the classical counterpart, we reveal that the effects of the $\Gamma$ term go beyond the classical picture, indicating significant quantum fluctuation effects, while those of the $\Gamma^\prime$ term are well captured at the classical level. These comprehensive analyses indicate that the enhanced thermal Hall response is consistently explained by dominant contributions from topological Majorana fermions, even within the polarized regime beyond the critical field. Our approach not only establishes a robust theoretical framework for understanding the thermal Hall transport in Kitaev materials such as $\alpha$-RuCl$_{3}$, but also offers a promising pathway to bridge the gap between theories and experiments across a wide range of strongly correlated materials.

Title: The birefringent spin-laser as a system of coupled harmonic oscillators
Authors: Velimir Labinac, Jiayu David Cao, Gaofeng Xu, Igor Žutić
Abstract: Adding spin-polarized carriers to semiconductor lasers strongly changes their properties and, through the transfer of angular momentum, leads to the emission of circularly polarized light. In such spin-lasers, the polarization of the emitted light can be modulated an order of magnitude faster than its intensity in the best conventional lasers. This ultrafast operation in spin-lasers relies on large linear birefringence, usually viewed as detrimental in spin and conventional lasers, which couples the two linearly polarized emission modes. We show that the dynamical properties of birefringent spin-lasers under intensity and polarization modulation are accurately described as coupled harmonic oscillators. Our model agrees with the intensity-equation description which, unlike the common complex field components describing the role of birefringence in laser dynamics, uses simpler real quantities and allows analytical solutions. We further predict unexplored operation regimes and elucidate the difference between the weak and strong coupling in spin-lasers.

Title: Classical-to-Quantum Crossover in 2D TMD Field-Effect Transistors: A First-Principles Study via Sub-10 nm Channel Scaling Beyond the Boltzmann Tyranny
Authors: Yu-Chang Chen, Ken-Ming Lin
Abstract: Scaling field-effect transistors (FETs) into the sub-10 nm regime fundamentally alters electronic transport mechanisms, challenging the conventional design rules that have underpinned semiconductor technology for decades. The impact of competing classical and quantum transport on sub-10-nm 2D FET scaling remains poorly understood. In this work, we investigate the transport properties of 2D TMD nanojunctions with channel lengths from 12 down to 3 nm, using first-principles calculations that integrate the nonequilibrium Green function formalism implemented in density functional theory (NEGF-DFT) and an effective gate model. Our simulations reveal a pronounced crossover from semiclassical thermionic emission to quantum tunnelling, governed by two characteristic temperatures:(1) $T_{c}$, denotes the temperature at which the OFF current reaches its minimum, marking the optimal condition for turning off the transistor; (2) $T_{t}$, above which the subthreshold swing saturates at the Boltzmann tyranny scaled by the gate-control efficiency factor. Longer channels enter the classical regime at much lower temperatures, where thermionic emission dominates, and perfect contact with S.S. approaches the Boltzmann Tyranny scaled by the gate controlling efficiency. The shortest 3 nm junction exhibits pronounced quantum tunneling up to 500 K and achieves a subthreshold swing superior to the physical limit of transistors, known as the Boltzmann Tyranny, enabled by the steep energy dependence of the transmission coefficient. This study provides a theoretical prediction of the transition from classical to quantum transport in sub-10 nm 2D TMD transistors, identifying critical temperatures that define the boundary between these regimes and offering key design insights for harnessing quantum and classical hybrid transistor technology.

Title: Microscopic Theory of Light-Induced Coherent Phonons Mediated by Quantum Geometry
Authors: Jiaming Hu, Zhichao Guo, Wenbin Li, Hua Wang, Kai Chang
Abstract: Light-induced coherent phonons provide a powerful platform for ultrafast control of material properties. However, the microscopic theory and quantum geometric nature of this phenomenon remain underexplored. Here, we develop a fully quantum-mechanical framework based on Feynman diagrams to systematically describe the generation of coherent phonons by light. We identify a dominant second-order, double-resonant process in noncentrosymmetric semiconductors that efficiently couples light to both electronic and phononic excitations. Crucially, we uncover the quantum geometric origin, encoded in the electron-phonon coupling (EPC) shift vector and the EPC quantum geometric tensor. Applying our theory to ferroelectric BaTiO$_3$ and SnSe, we demonstrate the potential for light-induced modulation of ferroelectric polarization driven by coherent phonons. This work provides fundamental insights for designing efficient optical control strategies for both coherent phonons and ferroelectric polarization.

Title: EAC-Net: Predicting real-space charge density via equivariant atomic contributions
Authors: Xuejian Qin Taoyuze Lv, Zhicheng Zhong
Abstract: Charge density is central to density functional theory (DFT), as it fully defines the ground-state properties of a material system. Obtaining it with high accuracy is a computational bottleneck. Existing machine learning models are constrained by trade-offs among accuracy, efficiency, and generalization. Here, we introduce the Equivariant Atomic Contribution Network (EAC-Net), which couples atoms and grids to integrate the strengths of grid-based and basis-function frameworks. EAC-Net achieves high accuracy (typically below 1% error), enhanced efficiency, and strong generalization across complex systems. Building on this framework, we develop EAC-mp, a universal charge density model covering the periodic table. The model demonstrates robust zero-shot performance across diverse systems, and generalizes beyond the training distribution, supporting downstream applications such as band structure calculations. By linking local chemical environments to charge densities, EAC-Net provides a scalable framework for accelerating electronic structure prediction and enabling high-throughput materials discovery.

Title: An effective potential for generative modelling with active matter
Authors: Adrian Baule
Abstract: Score-based diffusion models generate samples from a complex underlying data distribution by time-reversal of a diffusion process and represent the state-of-the-art in many generative AI applications. Here, I show how a generative diffusion model can be implemented based on an underlying active particle process with finite correlation time. Time reversal is achieved by imposing an effective time-dependent potential on the position coordinate, which can be readily implemented in simulations and experiments to generate new synthetic data samples driven by active fluctuations. The effective potential is valid to first order in the persistence time and leads to a force field that is fully determined by the standard score function and its derivatives up to 2nd order. Numerical experiments for artificial data distributions confirm the validity of the effective potential, which opens up new avenues to exploit fluctuations in active and living systems for generative AI purposes.

Title: Ergodicity detection algorithms: Scaling of ergodicity in random symbolic dynamics
Authors: M. Süzen
Abstract: The mathematical definitions of distinct concepts that are needed in building an ergodicity detection algorithm are introduced in a framework. This algorithmic framework is expressed in a discrete setting in an accessible manner for broader quantitative practitioners without loss of generality. At the same time, the common misconceptions of the requirement of visiting all available states in the time-averaged quantities for physical systems and non-existence of an ergodic process are resolved by introducing the distinction between Gibbs-Boltzmann and von Neumann-Birkhoff ergodic regimes. For this purpose, we introduce a new concept which is called sufficiency of sparse visit. We use finite symbolic random sequences as a pedagogical tool in establishing the different approaches for the detection of ergodic regimes of dynamical systems with vector patterns. The simple example system conveys the different attitudes in ergodicity regimes and offers guidance for building computational tools for its algorithmic detection.

Title: Uncovering the Fourier Structure of Wavefunctions in Semiconductors
Authors: Yunfan Liang, Damien West, Shengbai Zhang
Abstract: Symmetry is at the heart of material properties. Symmetry of the Bravais lattice defines the degeneracy of planewaves, upon which atomic symmetry determines interaction potentials which may lift such degeneracies. This results in wavefunctions which are single planewaves throughout the Brillouin zone (BZ), except in the vicinity of lifted degeneracies. This great simplification allows for determination of optical properties from a handful of planewaves and a single transition. Further, it reveals that nonlinear optical response arises from higher order degeneracy along lines/points in the BZ.

Authors: Aldo Artímez Peña, Nikita Medvedev
Abstract: Cadmium telluride (CdTe), lead sulfide (PbS), and indium tin oxide (ITO) play crucial roles in various electronic applications where laser treatment enables precise modification of their distinctive electronic characteristics. This study utilizes the XTANT-3 hybrid/multiscale model to investigate the microscopic response of these materials to ultrafast X-ray irradiation. The model simultaneously traces intertwined processes of non-equilibrium dynamics of both electrons and atoms, nonadiabatic coupling, nonthermal melting, and bond breaking due to electronic excitation. Among the materials studied, CdTe exhibits the highest radiation resistance, similar to CdS. At the respective threshold doses, the melting is primarily thermal, driven by electron-phonon coupling, which is accompanied by the band gap closure. Additionally, all materials exhibit nonthermal melting at higher doses. When accounting for energy dissipation pathways and material recrystallization processes, damage thresholds increase substantially. In CdTe and PbS, below 1.5 eV/atom, the band gap returns to its original value upon recrystallization. As the dose increases, the resulting cooled material becomes increasingly amorphous, progressively reducing the band gap until a stable configuration is reached. Notably, in a narrow window of deposited doses, ITO exhibits transient superionic behavior, with the liquid oxygen but solid In and Sn sublattices. At 0.6 eV/atom in CdTe and 0.4 eV/atom in PbS and ITO, material ablation from the surface occurs. These findings indicate that femtosecond laser technology offers promising opportunities for precise band gap engineering in various photovoltaic semiconductor devices.

Title: Strain-induced Ettingshausen effect in spin-orbit coupled noncentrosymmetric metals
Authors: Gautham Varma K, Azaz Ahmad, Gargee Sharma
Abstract: Elastic deformations couple with electronic degrees of freedom in materials to generate gauge fields that lead to interesting transport properties. Recently, it has been well studied that strain-induced chiral magnetic fields in Weyl semimetals lead to interesting magnetotransport induced by the chiral anomaly (CA). Recent studies have revealed that CA is not necessarily only a Weyl-node property, but is rather a Fermi surface property, and is also present in a more general class of materials, for example, in spin orbit-coupled noncentrosymmetric metals (SOC-NCMs). The interplay of strain, CA, and charge and thermomagnetic transport in SOC-NCMs, however, remains unexplored. Here we resolve this gap. Using a tight-binding model for SOC-NCMs, we first demonstrate that strain in SOC-NCMs induces anisotropy in the spin-orbit coupling and generates an axial electric field. Then, using the quasi-classical Boltzmann transport formalism with momentum-dependent intraband and interband scattering processes, we show that strain in the presence of external magnetic field can generate temperature gradients via the Nernst-Ettingshausen effect, whose direction and behavior depends the on interplay of multiple factors: the angle between the applied strain and magnetic field, the presence of the chiral anomaly, the Lorentz force, and the strength of interband scattering. We further reveal that time-reversal symmetry breaking in the presence of an external magnetic field generates the Berry-curvature-driven anomalous Ettingshausen effect, which is qualitatively distinct from the conventional Lorentz-force-driven counterpart. In light of recent and forthcoming theoretical and experimental advances in the field of SOC-NCMs, we find our study to be particularly timely and relevant.

Title: Realization and characterization of an all-bands-flat electrical lattice
Authors: Noah Lape, Simon Diubenkov, L.Q. English, P.G. Kevrekidis, Alexei Andreanov, Yeongjun Kim, Sergej Flach
Abstract: We construct an electrical all-bands-flat (ABF) lattice and experimentally generate compact localized states (CLSs) therein. The lattice is a diamond (rhombic) chain and implemented as a network of capacitors and inductors, as well as voltage inverters (using operational amplifiers) in order to introduce a \(\pi\)-phase flux within each diamond. The network's normal modes split into three flat bands, and the corresponding CLSs can be excited in isolation via a two-node driving at the flat band frequencies. We also examine the role of the lattice edges and their interaction with the CLSs. Finally, we compare the experimental results to tight-binding predictions and obtain very good agreement. This analysis paves the way for further experimental implementations of ABF systems in electric networks, especially with an eye towards exploring their interplay with nonlinearity.

Title: Topological potentials guiding protein self-assembly
Authors: Ivan Spirandelli, Arnur Nigmetov, Dmitriy Morozov, Myfanwy E. Evans
Abstract: The simulated self-assembly of molecular building blocks into functional complexes is a key area of study in computational biology and materials science. Self-assembly simulations of proteins using physically-motivated potentials for non-polar interactions, can identify the biologically correct assembly as the energy-minimizing state. Short-range potentials, however, produce rugged energy landscapes, which lead to simulations becoming trapped in non-functional local minimizers. Successful self-assembly simulations depend on the physical realism of the driving potentials as well as their ability to efficiently explore the configuration space. We introduce a long-range topological potential, quantified via weighted total persistence, and combine it with the morphometric approach to solvation-free energy. This combination improves the assembly success rate in simulations of the tobacco mosaic virus dimer and other protein complexes by up to sixteen-fold compared with the morphometric model alone. It further enables successful simulation in systems that don't otherwise assemble during the examined timescales. Compared to previous topology-based work, which has been primarily descriptive, our approach uses topological measures as an active energetic bias that is independent of electrostatics or chemical specificity and depends only on atomic coordinates. Therefore, the method can, in principle, be applied to arbitrary systems where such coordinates are optimized. Integrating topological descriptions into an energy function offers a general strategy for overcoming kinetic barriers in molecular simulations, with potential applications in drug design, materials development, and the study of complex self-assembly processes.

Title: Constrained Random Phase Approximation: the spectral method
Authors: Merzuk Kaltak, Alexander Hampel, Martin Schlipf, Indukuru Ramesh Reddy, Bongjae Kim, Georg Kresse
Abstract: We present a new constrained Random Phase Approximation (cRPA) method, termed spectral cRPA (s-cRPA), and compare it to established cRPA approaches for Scandium and Copper by varying the 3d shell filling. The s-cRPA consistently yields larger Hubbard $U$ interaction values. Applied to the realistic system CaFeO$_3$, s-cRPA produces interaction parameters significantly closer to those required within DFT+$U$ to induce the experimentally observed insulating state, overcoming the metallic behavior predicted by standard density functionals. We also address the issue of negative interaction values found in the projector cRPA method for filled d-shells, demonstrating that s-cRPA offers superior numerical stability through electron conversion. Overall, s-cRPA is more robust and effectively overcomes the known underestimation of $U$ in standard cRPA, making it a promising tool for the community. Additionally, we have enhanced our implementation with features for computing multi-center interactions to analyze spatial decay and developed a low-scaling variant with a compressed Matsubara grid to efficiently obtain full frequency-dependent interactions.

Title: Quantifying time in Monte Carlo simulations: application to relaxation processes and AC susceptibilities of magnetic nanoparticles assemblies
Authors: A. Morjane, J.-G. Malherbe, J.-J. Alonso, F. Vernay, V. Russier
Abstract: The study of the response of magnetic nanoparticles (MNP) assemblies to an external alternating magnetic field is of great interest for applications such as hyperthermia. The key quantity here is the complex susceptibility and its behavior in terms of temperature and frequency. From a theoretical point of view it can be obtained by Monte Carlo (MC) simulation with the time quantified Monte Carlo (TQMC) method if a physical time is associated with the MC step. Here we revisit this method by showing that the time unit can be derived from the MC stochastic process of the isolated particle. We first obtain a MC unit of time from the relaxation of the system at fixed temperature. Then this unit of time is used to compute complex susceptibilities. We show that it is now possible to match the TQMC results with actual experimental results regarding frequency dependent in phase susceptibilities and quantify the unit of time in seconds. Finally we show that the time unit obtained for the isolated particle remains valid when considering interacting particles such as the Heisenberg coupling or dipole dipole interactions.

Title: Incompressible quantum liquid on the four-dimensional sphere
Authors: Junwen Zhao, Xue Meng, Wei Zhu, Congjun Wu
Abstract: The study of quantum Hall effect (QHE) is a foundation of topological physics, inspiring extensive explorations of its high-dimensional generalizations. Notably, the four dimensional (4D) QHE has been experimentally realized in synthetic quantum systems, including cold atoms, photonic lattices, and metamaterials. However, the many-body effect in the 4D QHE system remains poorly understood. In this study, we explore this problem by formulating the microscopic wavefunctions inspired by Laughlin's seminal work. Employing a generalized pseudo-potential framework, we derive an exact microscopic Hamiltonian consisting of two-body projectors that annihilate the microscopic wavefunctions. Diagonalizations on a small size system show that the quasi-hole states remain zero energy while the quasi-particle states exhibit a finite gap, in consistency with an incompressible state. Furthermore, the pairing distribution is calculated to substantiate the liquid-like nature of the wavefunction. Our work provides a preliminary understanding to the fractional topological states in high dimension.

Title: Measuring high field gradients of cobalt nanomagnets in a spin-mechanical setup
Authors: Felix Hahne, Teresa Klara Pfau, Liza Žaper, Lucio Stefan, Thibault Capelle, Andrea Ranfagni, Martino Poggio, Albert Schliesser
Abstract: Hybrid systems composed of a single nitrogen-vacancy center spin magnetically coupled to a macroscopic mechanical resonator constitute promising platforms for the realization of quantum information protocols and for quantum sensing applications. The magnetic structure that mediates the interaction must ensure high field gradients while preserving the spin and mechanical properties. We present a spin-mechanical setup built around a cobalt nanomagnet grown with focused electron beam-induced deposition. The magnetic structure is fully characterized, and a maximum gradient of $170\,\mathrm{kT/m}$ is directly measured at a spin-oscillator distance of a few hundred nanometers. Spin coherence was preserved at the value of $20\,\mathrm{ \mu s}$ up to a gradient of $25\,\mathrm{kT/m}$. The effect of the mechanical motion onto the spin dynamics was observed, thus signifying the presence of spin-mechanics coupling. Given the noninvasive nature of the nanomagnet deposition process, we foresee the adoption of such structures in hybrid platforms with high-quality factor resonators, in the "magnet on oscillator" configuration.

Title: Correlated decoherence and thermometry with mobile impurities in a 1D Fermi gas
Authors: Sindre Brattegard, Thomás Fogarty, Thomas Busch, Mark T. Mitchison
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the correlated decoherence dynamics of two mobile impurities trapped within a gas of ultracold fermionic atoms. We use a mean-field approximation to self-consistently describe the effect of impurity-gas collisions on impurity motion, while decoherence of the impurities' internal state is computed exactly within a functional determinant approach. At equilibrium, we find that the impurities undergo bath-induced localisation as the impurity-gas interaction strength is increased. We then study the non-equilibrium dynamics induced by a sudden change of the impurities' internal state, which can be experimentally probed by Ramsey interferometry. Our theoretical approach allows us to investigate the effect of impurity motion on decoherence dynamics, finding strong deviations from the universal behaviour associated with Anderson's orthogonality catastrophe when the mass imbalance between impurity and gas atoms is small. Finally, we show that mobile impurities can be used as thermometers of their environment and that bath-mediated correlations can be beneficial for thermometric performance at low temperatures, even in the presence of non-trivial impurity motion. Our results showcase the interesting open quantum dynamics of mobile impurities dephasing in a common environment, and could help provide more precise temperature estimates of ultracold fermionic mixtures.

Title: Critical quantum liquids and the cuprate high temperature superconductors
Authors: Pietro M. Bonetti, Maine Christos, Alexander Nikolaenko, Aavishkar A. Patel, Subir Sachdev
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework for the cuprate superconductors, rooted in a fractionalized Fermi liquid (FL*) description of the intermediate-temperature pseudogap phase at low doping. The FL* theory predicted hole pockets each of fractional area $p/8$ at hole doping $p$, in contrast to the area $p/4$ in a spin density wave state or its thermal fluctuation. A recent magnetotransport observation of the Yamaji angle is in good agreement with area $p/8$. We review a theory for the FL* phase of a single-band model using a pair of ancilla qubits on each site. Its mean field theory yields hole pockets of area $p/8$, and matches the gapped photoemission spectrum in the anti-nodal region of the Brillouin zone. Fluctuations are described by the SU(2) gauge theory of a background spin liquid with critical Dirac spinons. A Monte Carlo study of the thermal SU(2) gauge theory transforms the hole pockets into Fermi arcs. One route to confinement upon lowering temperature yields a $d$-wave superconductor via a Kosterlitz-Thouless transition of $h/(2e)$ vortices, with nodal Bogoliubov quasiparticles featuring anisotropic velocities and vortices surrounded by charge order halos. An alternative route produces a charge-ordered metallic state that exhibits quantum oscillations in agreement with experimental data. Increasing doping from the FL* phase drives a transition to a conventional Fermi liquid at large doping, passing through an intermediate strange metal regime. We formulate a theory of this metal using a critical quantum `charge' liquid of mobile electrons in the presence of disorder, developed via an extension of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model. At low temperatures, and across optimal and over doping, we address the regimes of extended non-Fermi liquid behavior by Griffiths effects near quantum phase transitions in disordered metals.

Title: Fluctuation theorem and optimal control of an active tracking particle with information processing
Authors: Tai Han, Fanlong Meng
Abstract: Living systems often function with regulatory interactions, but the question of how activity, stochasticity and regulations work together for achieving different goals still remains puzzling. We propose the model of an active tracking particle with information processing, based on which the entropy production, information flow, and generalised fluctuation theorem are derived. Moreover, the system performance, in terms of the first passage steps and the total energy consumption, are analysed in the variable space of (measurement error, control field), leading to discussions on the optimal control of the system. Not only elucidating the basic concepts involved in a stochastic active system with information processing, this prototypical model could also inspire more elaborated modelings of natural smart organisms and industrial designs of controllable active systems with desired physical performances in the future.

Title: Approximate calculation of multidimensional first passage times
Authors: James F. Lutsko
Abstract: The general, multidimensional barrier crossing problem for diffusive processes under the action of conservative forces is studied with the goal of developing tractable approximations. Particular attention is given to the effect of different statistical interpretations of the stochastic differential equation and to the relation between the approximations and the known, exact solutions to the one-dimensional problem. Beginning with a reasonable, but heuristic, simplifying assumption, a one-dimensional solution to the problem is developed. This is then simplified by introducing further approximations resulting in a sequence of increasingly simple expressions culminating in the classic result of Langer(Ann. Phys. 54, 258 (1969)) and others. The various approximations are tested on two dimensional problems by comparison to simulation results and it is found that the one-dimensional approximations capture most of the non-Arrhenius dependence on the energy barrier which is lost in the Langer approximation while still converging to the latter in the large-barrier limit.

Title: Quantum Chaos and Universal Trotterisation Behaviours in Digital Quantum Simulations
Authors: Cahit Kargi, Angsar Manatuly, Lukas M. Sieberer, Juan Pablo Dehollain, Fabio Henriques, Tobias Olsacher, Philipp Hauke, Markus Heyl, Peter Zoller, Nathan K. Langford
Abstract: Digital quantum simulation (DQS) is one of the most promising paths for achieving first useful real-world applications for quantum processors. Yet even assuming rapid progress in device engineering and development of fault-tolerant quantum processors, algorithmic resource optimisation will long remain crucial to exploit their full power. Currently, Trotterisation provides state-of-the-art resource scaling. And recent theoretical studies of Trotterised Ising models suggest that even better performance than expected may be possible up to a distinct breakdown threshold in empirical performance. Here, we study multiple paradigmatic DQS models with experimentally realisable Trotterisations, and evidence the universality of a range of Trotterisation performance behaviours, including not only the threshold, but also new features in the pre-threshold regime that is most important for practical applications. In each model, we observe a distinct Trotterisation threshold shared across widely varying performance signatures; we further show that an onset of quantum chaotic dynamics causes the performance breakdown and is directly induced by digitisation errors. In the important pre-threshold regime, we are able to identify new distinct regimes displaying qualitatively different quasiperiodic performance behaviours, and show analytic behaviour for properly defined operational Trotter errors. Our results rely crucially on diverse new analytical tools, and provide a previously missing unified picture of Trotterisation behaviour across local observables, the global quantum state, and the full Trotterised unitary. This work provides new insights and tools for addressing important questions about the algorithm performance and underlying theoretical principles of sufficiently complex Trotterisation-based DQS, that will help in extracting maximum simulation power from future quantum processors.

Title: Observable criterion for collective entanglement in Boson-lattice system
Authors: Mehmet Emre Tasgin, Hyunchul Nha
Abstract: An optical lattice with cold trapped atoms represents a quantum system of fundamental importance as it enables the study of quantum many-body system in a controllable way. It is thus necessary to develop theoretical and experimental tools to explore quantum correlation in such systems to advance our understanding of many-body physics. While previous works have identified some profound aspects of quantum entanglement using e.g. entanglement entropy, there exists a critical demand to have an experimentally accessible tool to investigate many-body quantum entanglement in a broad context. We present an entanglement criterion characterizing collective entanglement in Boson lattice systems and enabling experimental observation readily. On applying our approach to the extended Bose-Hubbard model, we show that our criterion witnesses phase transitions such as Mott insulator--superfluid and Mott insulator--charge density wave transitions. Remarkably, it also makes it possible to detect multipartite entanglement among boson lattice sites in a rigorous sense. Our criterion can be experimentally tested via Raman scattering or time-of-flight methods, which are within the reach of current technology.

Title: Von Neumann Algebras in Double-Scaled SYK
Authors: Jiuci Xu
Abstract: It has been argued that a finite effective temperature emerges and characterizes the thermal property of double-scaled SYK model in the infinite temperature limit. Meanwhile, in the static patch of de Sitter, the maximally entangled state satisfies a KMS condition at infinite temperature, suggesting the Type II$_1$ nature of the observable algebra gravitationally dressed to the observer. In this work, we analyze the double-scaled algebra generated by chord operators in the double-scaled SYK model and demonstrate that it exhibits features reflecting both perspectives. Specifically, we prove that the algebra is a Type II$_1$ factor, and that the empty state with no chord satisfies the tracial property, in agreement with expectations from earlier work. We further show that this state is cyclic and separating for the double-scaled algebra, based on which we explore its modular structure. We then explore various physical limits of the theory, drawing connections to JT gravity, the Hilbert space of baby universes, and Brownian double-scaled SYK. We also present analytic solutions to the energy spectrum in both the zero- and one-particle sectors of the left/right chord Hamiltonian.

Title: Quantum Thermodynamics of Open Quantum Systems: Nature of Thermal Fluctuations
Authors: Neha Pathania, Devvrat Tiwari, Subhashish Banerjee
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamic behavior of open quantum systems through the Hamiltonian of Mean Force, focusing on two models: a two-qubit system interacting with a thermal bath and a Jaynes-Cummings Model without the rotating wave approximation. By analyzing both weak and strong coupling regimes, we uncover the impact of environmental interactions on quantum thermodynamic quantities, including specific heat capacity, internal energy, and entropy. Further, the ergotropy and entropy production are computed. We also explore the energy-temperature uncertainty relation, which sets an upper bound on the signal-to-noise ratio.

Title: Krylov complexity of purification
Authors: Rathindra Nath Das, Takato Mori
Abstract: In quantum systems, purification can map mixed states into pure states and a non-unitary evolution into a unitary one by enlarging the Hilbert space. We establish a connection between the complexities of mixed quantum states and their purification, proposing new inequalities among these complexities. By examining single qubits, two-qubit Werner states, 8-dimensional Gaussian random unitary ensemble, and infinite-dimensional systems, we demonstrate how these relationships manifest across a broad class of systems. We find that the spread complexity of purification of a vacuum state evolving into a thermal state equals the average number of Rindler particles. This complexity is also shown to adhere to the Lloyd-like bound, indicating a further relation to the quantum speed limit. Finally, using mutual Krylov complexity, we observe subadditivity of the Krylov complexities, which contrasts with known results from holographic volume complexity. We put forward Krylov mutual complexity as a diagnosis of a potential gravity dual of Krylov complexities.

Title: Quantum dynamics of atoms in number-theory-inspired potentials

Abstract: In this paper we study transitions of atoms between energy levels of several number-theory-inspired atom potentials, under the effect of time-dependent perturbations. First, we simulate in detail the case of a trap whose one-particle spectrum is given by prime numbers. We investigate one-body Rabi oscillations and the excitation lineshape for two resonantly coupled energy levels. We also show that techniques from quantum control are effective in reducing the transition time, compared to the case of a periodic perturbation. Next, we investigate cascades of such transitions. To this end, we pose the following question: can one construct a quantum system where the existence of a continuous resonant cascade is predicted on the validity of a particular statement in number theory? We find that a one-body trap with a log-natural spectrum, parametrically driven with a perturbation of a log-natural frequency, provides such a quantum system. Here, powers of a given natural number will form a ladder of equidistant energy levels; absence of gaps in this ladder is an indication of the validity of the number theory statement in question. Ideas for two more resonance cascade experiments are presented as well: they are designed to illustrate the validity of the Diophantus-Brahmagupta-Fibonacci identity (the set of sums of two squares of integers is closed under multiplication) and the validity of the Goldbach conjecture (every even number is a sum of two primes).

Title: In-situ electro-optic sampling of microwave signals under cryogenic conditions and for superconducting applications
Authors: Shekhar Priyadarshi, Rinis Ferizaj, Oliver Kieler, Alexander Fernandez Scarioni, Judith Felgner, Abdulrahman Widaa, Johannes Kohlmann, Thomas Fordell, Jaani Nissilä, Antti Kemppinen, Mark Bieler
Abstract: We demonstrate a cryogenic electro-optic sampling (EOS) setup that allows for the measurement of microwave signals at arbitrary positions on a cryogenic chip-scale device. We use a Josephson Arbitrary Waveform Synthesizer (JAWS) to generate quantum-accurate voltage signals and measure them with the EOS setup, allowing for the calibration of its response, yielding traceability of the microwave measurements to a quantum standard. We use the EOS setup to determine the time-domain response of ultrafast cryogenic photodiodes and the electrical reflection coefficient, i.e., the S11 scattering parameter, in a superconducting transmission line. Finally, we introduce an optical femtosecond pulse source which can be used to study the fidelity of superconducting transmission lines and terminations, as well as reflections from elements like Josephson junction arrays imbedded in them.

Title: Quantum master equation from the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis
Authors: Peter O'Donovan, Philipp Strasberg, Kavan Modi, John Goold, Mark T. Mitchison
Abstract: We use the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis to derive a quantum master equation for a system weakly coupled to a chaotic finite-sized bath prepared in a pure state. We show that the emergence of Markovianity is controlled by the spectral function of the ETH and that local detailed balance emerges in the Markovian regime for a broad class of pure bath states. We numerically verify this result by comparing the master equation to dynamics computed using exact diagonalization of a chaotic Hamiltonian. We also compare the master equation to exact dynamics for an integrable bath and find that at finite size they strongly disagree. Our work puts forward eigenstate thermalization as a foundation for open quantum systems theory, thus extending it beyond ensemble bath preparations to chaotic many-body environments in generic pure states.

Title: Versatile Control of Nonlinear Topological States in Non-Hermitian Systems
Authors: Zhao-Fan Cai, Yu-Chun Wang, Yu-Ran Zhang, Tao Liu, Franco Nori
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) and nonlinearity can both delocalize topological modes (TMs) from the interface. However, the NHSE requires precise parameter tuning, while nonlinearity in Hermitian systems results in partial delocalization with limited mode capacity. To overcome these limitations, we propose a non-Hermitian nonlinear topological interface model that integrates Hermitian and non-Hermitian lattices with nonreciprocal hopping and nonlinearity. This system enables the complete delocalization of TMs across the entire lattice without fine-tuning, while allowing precise control over the wavefunction profile and spatial distribution through the intrinsic configuration and intensity of the nonlinearity. Using the spectral localizer, we demonstrate the topological protection and robustness of these extended non-Hermitian TMs against disorder. Furthermore, we show that under external pumping, localized excitations evolve into predefined profiles and generate long-range patterns, an effect unattainable in Hermitian systems. These findings reveal how the interplay of nonlinearity and NHSE shapes topological states, paving the way for compact topological devices.

Title: Simultaneous replica-symmetry breaking for vector spin glasses
Authors: Hong-Bin Chen, Jean-Christophe Mourrat
Abstract: We consider mean-field vector spin glasses with possibly non-convex interactions. Up to a small perturbation of the parameters defining the model, the asymptotic behavior of the Gibbs measure is described in terms of a critical point of an explicit functional. In this paper, we study some properties of these critical points. Under modest assumptions ensuring that different types of spins interact, we show that the replica-symmetry-breaking structures of the different types of spins are in one-to-one correspondence with one another. For instance, if some type of spins displays one level of replica-symmetry breaking, then so do all the other types of spins. This extends the recent results of [Electronic Journal of Probability, 27:1-75, 2022] and [Comm. Math. Phys., 394(3):1101-1152, 2022] that were obtained in the case of multi-species spherical spin glasses with convex interactions.

Title: Subsystem Thermalization Hypothesis in Quantum Spin Chains with Conserved Charges
Authors: Feng-Li Lin, Jhh-Jing Hong, Ching-Yu Huang
Abstract: We consider the thermalization hypothesis of pure states in quantum Ising chain with $Z_2$ symmetry, XXZ chain with $U(1)$ symmetry, and XXX chain with $SU(2)$ symmetries. Two kinds of pure states are considered: the energy eigenstates and the typical states evolved unitarily from the random product states for a long enough period. We further group the typical states by their expectation values of the conserved charges and consider the fine-grained thermalization hypothesis. We compare the locally (subsystem) reduced states of typical states/eigenstates with the ones of the corresponding thermal ensemble states. Besides the usual thermal ensembles such as the (micro-)canonical ensemble without conserved charges and the generalized Gibbs ensemble (GGE) with all conserved charges included, we also consider the so-called partial-GGEs (p-GGEs), which include only part of the conserved charges in the thermal ensemble. Moreover, in the framework of p-GGE, the Hamiltonian and other conserved charges are on an equal footing. The introduction of p-GGEs extends quantum thermalization to a more general scope. The validity of the subsystem thermalization hypothesis can be quantified by the smallness of the relative entropy of the reduced states obtained from the GGE/p-GGE and the typical states/eigenstates. We examine the validity of the thermalization hypothesis by numerically studying the relative entropy demographics. We show that the thermalization hypothesis holds generically for the small enough subsystems for various p-GGEs. Thus, our framework extends the universality of quantum thermalization.

Title: Reproducibility of fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo across diverse community codes: The case of water-methane dimer

Abstract: Fixed-node diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (FN-DMC) is a widely-trusted many-body method for solving the Schrödinger equation, known for its reliable predictions of material and molecular properties. Furthermore, its excellent scalability with system complexity and near-perfect utilization of computational power makes FN-DMC ideally positioned to leverage new advances in computing to address increasingly complex scientific problems. Even though the method is widely used as a computational gold standard, reproducibility across the numerous FN-DMC code implementations has yet to be demonstrated. This difficulty stems from the diverse array of DMC algorithms and trial wave functions, compounded by the method's inherent stochastic nature. This study represents a community-wide effort to assess the reproducibility of the method, affirming that: Yes, FN-DMC is reproducible (when handled with care). Using the water-methane dimer as the canonical test case, we compare results from eleven different FN-DMC codes and show that the approximations to treat the non-locality of pseudopotentials are the primary source of the discrepancies between them. In particular, we demonstrate that, for the same choice of determinantal component in the trial wave function, reliable and reproducible predictions can be achieved by employing the T-move (TM), the determinant locality approximation (DLA), or the determinant T-move (DTM) schemes, while the older locality approximation (LA) leads to considerable variability in results. These findings demonstrate that, with appropriate choices of algorithmic details, fixed-node DMC is reproducible across diverse community codes-highlighting the maturity and robustness of the method as a tool for open and reliable computational science.

Title: Anti-scarring from eigenstate stacking in a chaotic spinor condensate
Authors: Zhongling Lu, Anton M. Graf, Eric J. Heller, Joonas Keski-Rahkonen, Ceren B. Dag
Abstract: We reveal a feature of quantum scarring in systems with many particles: Quantum scars, living densely near an unstable periodic orbit, must be compensated by corresponding anti-scarred states suppressed there to establish the uniformity of the whole. The uniformity of the underlying phase space is linked to early-time dynamics -- a regime beyond the predictions of random matrix theory and encapsulated in the eigenstate stacking theorem. By extending the domain of the stacking theorem, we apply our theory to a chaotic spinor Bose-Einstein condensate, whose quantum scar dynamics have recently been observed in the laboratory. Our work uncovers how scarring of some eigenstates affects the rest of the chaotic and thermal spectrum in quantum systems with many particles.

Title: Nonstabilizerness in the unitary and monitored quantum dynamics of XXZ-staggered and SYK models
Authors: Angelo Russomanno, Gianluca Passarelli, Davide Rossini, Procolo Lucignano
Abstract: We consider the quantum-state-diffusion dynamics of the XXZ-staggered spin chain, also focusing on its noninteracting XX-staggered limit, and of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model. We describe the process through quantum trajectories and evaluate the nonstabilizerness (also known as ``magic'') along the trajectories, quantified through the stabilizer Rényi entropy (SRE). In the absence of measurements, we find that the SYK model is the only one in which the time-averaged SRE saturates the random state bound and has a scaling with the system size that is well described by the theoretical prediction for quantum chaotic systems. In the presence of measurements, we numerically find that the steady-state SRE versus the coupling strength to the environment is well fitted by a generalized Lorentzian function. The scaling of the fitting parameters with the system size suggests that the steady-state} SRE linearly increases with the system size in all the considered cases, and displays no measurement-induced quantum transition, as confirmed by the curves of the steady-state SRE versus the system size.

Title: Revisiting the $ϕ^6$ Theory in Three Dimensions at Large $N$
Authors: Sandra Kvedaraitė, Tom Steudtner, Max Uetrecht
Abstract: We investigate the $O(N)$--symmetric $\phi^6$ theory in three spacetime dimensions using dimensional regularisation and minimal subtraction. The predictions of other methods are scrutinised in a large-$N$ expansion. We show how the tricritical line of fixed point emerges in a strict $N\to\infty$ limit but argue that it is not a physical manifestation. For the first time in this explicit manner, we compute the effective potential at next-to-leading order in the $1/N$-expansion and discuss its stability. The Bardeen-Moshe-Bander phenomenon is also analysed at next-to-leading order, and we demonstrate that it disappears without breaking the scale invariance spontaneously. Our findings indicate that the UV fixed point found by Pisarski persists at large $N$.

Abstract: Phase reconstruction is important in transmission electron microscopy for structural studies. We describe electron Fourier ptychography and its application to phase reconstruction of both radiation-resistant and beam-sensitive materials. We demonstrate that the phase of the exit wave can be reconstructed to high resolution using a modified iterative phase retrieval algorithm using data collected in an alternative optical geometry. This method achieves a spatial resolution of 0.63 nm at a fluence of $4.5 \times 10^2 \, e^-/\text{nm}^2$, as validated on Cry11Aa protein crystals under cryogenic conditions. Notably, this method requires no additional hardware modifications, is straightforward to implement, and can be seamlessly integrated with existing data collection software, providing a broadly accessible alternative approach to structural studies.

Title: Exciton-Polariton Dynamics in Multilayered Materials
Authors: Saeed Rahmanian Koshkaki, Arshath Manjalingal, Logan Blackham, Arkajit Mandal
Abstract: Coupling excitons with quantized radiation has been shown to enable coherent ballistic transport at room temperature inside optical cavities. Previous theoretical works employ a simple description of the material, depicting it as a one-dimensional single layer placed in the middle of an optical cavity, thereby ignoring the spatial variation of the radiation field. In contrast, in most experiments, the optical cavity is filled with organic molecules or multiple layers of two-dimensional materials. Here, we develop an efficient mixed-quantum-classical approach, introducing a bright layer description, to simulate the exciton-polariton quantum dynamics in three dimensions. Our simulations reveal that, for the same Rabi splitting, a multilayered material extends the quantum coherence lifetime and enhances transport compared to a single-layer material. We find that this enhanced coherence can be traced to a synchronization of phonon fluctuations over multiple layers, wherein the collective light-matter coupling in a multilayered material effectively suppresses the phonon-induced dynamical disorder.

Title: Beyond the Boltzmann equation for weakly coupled quantum fields
Authors: Xu-Yao Hu, Vladimir Rosenhaus
Abstract: We study the kinetic theory of a weakly interacting quantum field. Assuming a state that is close to homogeneous and stationary, we derive a closed kinetic equation for the rate of change of the occupation numbers, perturbatively in the coupling. For a dilute gas, this reproduces the quantum Boltzmann equation, which only accounts for two-to-two scattering processes. Our expression goes beyond this, with terms accounting for multi-particle scattering processes, which are higher order in the density.

Title: Noise equals control
Authors: Eric De Giuli
Abstract: Stochastic systems have a control-theoretic interpretation in which noise plays the role of control. In the weak-noise limit, relevant at low temperatures or in large populations, this leads to a precise mathematical mapping: the most probable trajectory between two states minimizes an action functional and corresponds to an optimal control strategy. In Langevin dynamics, the noise term itself serves as the control. For general Markov jump processes, such as chemical reaction networks or electronic circuits, we use the Doi-Peliti formalism to identify the `response' (or `momentum') field $\pi$ as the control variable. This resolves a long-standing interpretational problem in the field-theoretic description of stochastic systems: although $\pi$ evolves backward in time, it has a clear physical role as the control that steers the system along rare trajectories. This implies that Nature is constantly sampling control strategies. We illustrate the mapping on multistable chemical reaction networks, systems with unstable fixed points, and specifically on stochastic resonance and Brownian ratchets. The noise-control mapping justifies agential descriptions of these phenomena, and builds intuition for otherwise puzzling phenomena of stochastic systems: why probabilities are generically non-smooth functions of state out of thermal equilibrium; why biological mechanisms can work better in the presence of noise; and how agential behavior emerges naturally without recourse to mysticism.

Title: Single-atom imaging of ${}^{173}$Yb in optical tweezers loaded by a five-beam magneto-optical trap
Authors: Omar Abdel Karim, Alessandro Muzi Falconi, Riccardo Panza, Wenliang Liu, Francesco Scazza
Abstract: We report on the trapping and imaging of individual ytterbium atoms in arrays of optical tweezers, loaded from a magneto-optical trap (MOT) formed by only five beams in an orthogonal configuration. In our five-beam MOT, operating on the narrow ${}^1$S${}_0 \rightarrow {}^3$P${}_1$ intercombination transition, gravity balances the radiation pressure of a single upward-directed beam. This approach enables efficient trapping and cooling of the most common ytterbium isotopes (${}^{171}$Yb, ${}^{173}$Yb and ${}^{174}$Yb) to $\lesssim 20\,\mu$K at densities $\sim 10^{11}$ atoms/cm$^3$ within less than one second. This configuration allows for significantly reducing the complexity of the optical setup, potentially benefiting any ytterbium-atom based quantum science platform leveraging single-atom microscopy, from quantum processors to novel optical clocks. We then demonstrate the first single-atom-resolved imaging of the fermionic, large-spin isotope ${}^{173}$Yb ($I=5/2$), employing a two-color imaging scheme that does not rely on magic-wavelength trapping. We achieve a high single-atom detection fidelity of $99.96(1)\%$ and a large survival probability of $98.5(2)\%$, despite large differential light shifts affecting all nuclear spin sublevels of the excited ${}^3$P${}_1$ state involved in the cooling transition. The demonstrated capabilities will play a key role in future quantum simulations and computing applications with ${}^{173}$Yb arrays.

Title: Symmetry Sectors in Chord Space and Relational Holography in the DSSYK
Authors: Sergio E. Aguilar-Gutierrez
Abstract: In holography, gauging symmetries of the boundary theory leads to important modifications in the bulk. In this work, we study constraints to gauge symmetry sectors in the chord Hilbert space of the double-scaled SYK (DSSYK) with matter, and we connect them to different proposals of its bulk dual. These sectors include chord parity symmetry, corresponding to End-Of-The-World (ETW) branes and Euclidean wormholes in sine dilaton gravity; and relative time-translations in a doubled DSSYK model (resulting from a single DSSYK with an infinitely heavy matter chord) used in de Sitter holography. We define and evaluate partition functions and thermal correlation functions of the ETW brane and Euclidean wormhole systems in the boundary theory. We deduce the holographic dictionary by matching geodesic lengths in the bulk with the spread complexity of the parity-gauged DSSYK. The Euclidean wormholes of fixed size are perturbatively stable, and their baby universe Hilbert space is non-trivial only when matter is added. We conclude studying the constraints in the path integral of the doubled DSSYK. We derive the gauge invariant operator algebra of one of the DSSYKs dressed to the other one and discuss its holographic interpretation.

Title: Linear Resistivity from Spatially Random Interactions and the Uniqueness of Yukawa Coupling
Authors: Sang-Jin Sin, Yi-Li Wang
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that a spatially random Yukawa-type interaction between a Fermi surface and critical bosons can produce linear-in-temperature resistivity, the defining signature of strange metals. In this article, we systematically classify all scalar couplings of the form $(\psi^{\dagger}\psi)^n\phi^m$ in arbitrary dimensions to identify possible candidates for strange-metal behaviour within this disordered framework. We find that only the Yukawa-type interaction in $(2+1)$ dimensions yields linear resistivity. Combined with previous results showing that spatially random QED-type couplings also produce such linearity, we conclude that spatially random Yukawa and QED-type interaction with external vector exhaust the class of random couplings capable of producing linear resistivity.

Title: Statistical regimes of electromagnetic wave propagation in randomly time-varying media
Authors: Seulong Kim, Kihong Kim
Abstract: Wave propagation in time-varying media enables unique control of energy transport by breaking energy conservation through temporal modulation. Among the resulting phenomena, temporal disorder-random fluctuations in material parameters-can suppress propagation and induce localization, analogous to Anderson localization. However, the statistical nature of this process remains incompletely understood. We present a comprehensive analytical and numerical study of electromagnetic wave propagation in spatially uniform media with randomly time-varying permittivity. Using the invariant imbedding method, we derive exact moment equations and identify three distinct statistical regimes for initially unidirectional input: gamma-distributed energy at early times, negative exponential statistics at intermediate times, and a quasi-log-normal distribution at long times, distinct from the true log-normal. In contrast, symmetric bidirectional input yields genuine log-normal statistics across all time scales. These findings are validated using two complementary disorder models--delta-correlated Gaussian noise and piecewise-constant fluctuations--demonstrating that the observed statistics are robust and governed by input symmetry. Momentum conservation constrains the long-time behavior, linking the statistical outcome to the initial conditions. Our results establish a unified framework for understanding statistical wave dynamics in time-modulated systems and offer guiding principles for the design of dynamically tunable photonic and electromagnetic devices.

Title: Topological edge states and disorder robustness in one-dimensional off-diagonal mosaic lattices
Authors: Ba Phi Nguyen, Kihong Kim
Abstract: We investigate topological edge states in one-dimensional off-diagonal mosaic lattices, where nearest-neighbor hopping amplitudes are modulated periodically with period $\kappa>1$. Analytically, we demonstrate that discrete edge states emerge at energy levels $E=\epsilon+2t\cos(\pi i/\kappa)$ ($i=1,\cdots,\kappa-1$), extending the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model to multi-band systems. Numerical simulations show that these edge states are robustly localized and display characteristic nodal structures, with their existence being strongly dictated by the specific edge arrangement of long and short bonds. We further examine their stability under off-diagonal disorder, where the hopping amplitudes $\beta$ fluctuate randomly at intervals of $\kappa$. Using the inverse participation ratio as a localization measure, we show that these topological edge states remain robust over a broad range of disorder strengths. In contrast, additional $\beta$-dependent edge states that appear for $\kappa \ge 4$ are fragile and vanish even under relatively weak disorder. These findings highlight a rich interplay between topology, periodic modulation, and disorder, offering insights for engineering multi-gap topological phases and their realization in synthetic quantum and photonic systems.

Title: Relaxing Direct Ptychography Sampling Requirements via Parallax Imaging Insights
Authors: Georgios Varnavides, Julie Marie Bekkevold, Stephanie M Ribet, Mary C Scott, Lewys Jones, Colin Ophus
Abstract: Direct ptychography enables the retrieval of information encoded in the phase of an electron wave passing through a thin sample by deconvolving the interference effects of a converged probe with known aberrations. Under the weak phase object approximation, this permits the optimal transfer of information using non-iterative techniques. However, the achievable resolution of the technique is traditionally limited by the probe step size -- setting stringent Nyquist sampling requirements. At the same time, parallax imaging has emerged as a dose-efficient phase-retrieval technique which relaxes sampling requirements and enables scan-upsampling. Here, we formulate parallax imaging as a quadratic approximation to part of the direct ptychography kernel and use this insight to enable upsampling in direct ptychography. We validate our analytical results numerically using simulated and experimental reconstructions.

Title: Beyond Contrast Transfer: Spectral SNR as a Dose-Aware Metric for STEM Phase Retrieval
Authors: Georgios Varnavides, Julie Marie Bekkevold, Stephanie M Ribet, Mary C Scott, Lewys Jones, Colin Ophus
Abstract: The contrast transfer function (CTF) is widely used to evaluate phase retrieval methods in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), including center-of-mass imaging, parallax imaging, direct ptychography, and iterative ptychography. However, the CTF reflects only the maximum usable signal, neglecting the effects of finite electron fluence and the Poisson-limited nature of detection. As a result, it can significantly overestimate practical performance, especially in low-dose regimes. Here, we employ the spectral signal-to-noise ratio (SSNR), as a dose-aware statistical framework to evaluate the recoverable signal as a function of spatial frequency. Using numerical reconstructions of white-noise objects, we show that center-of-mass, parallax, and direct ptychography exhibit dose-independent SSNRs, with close-form analytic expressions. In contrast, iterative ptychography exhibits a surprising dose dependence: at low fluence, its SSNR converges to that of direct ptychography; at high fluence, it saturates at a value consistent with the maximum detective quantum efficiency predicted by recent quantum Fisher information bounds. The results highlight the limitations of CTF-based evaluation and motivate SSNR as a more accurate, dose-aware metric for assessing STEM phase retrieval methods.

Title: Integrable multispecies totally asymmetric stochastic interacting particle systems with homogeneous rates
Authors: Eunghyun Lee, Temirlan Raimbekov
Abstract: We study one dimensional stochastic particle systems with exclusion interaction that each site can be occupied by at most one particle, and homogeneous jumping rates. Alimohammadi and Ahmadi previously classified 28 Yang-Baxter integrable two-particle interaction rules for the two species models with homogeneous rates. In this work, we show that 7 of these 28 cases can be naturally extended to integrable models with an arbitrary number of species $N \geq 2$. Moreover, we discover new integrable models with one or two parameters that generalize these 7 cases. For 8 of the remaining 21 cases, we propose an alternative extension scheme that yields integrable $N$ species models.

Title: Entanglement and particle production from cosmological perturbations: a quantum optical simulation approach
Authors: Pramod Kamal Kharel, Mausam Ghimire, Ashish Khanal, Samyam Pudasaini, Nabaraj Khatri, Sayujya Bhandari, Divash Rai, Kiran Adhikari, Rajeev Singh
Abstract: In this work, we develop a computational framework based on the Gaussian formalism and symplectic circuit representation to explore cosmological perturbations during inflation. These tools offer an efficient means to study entanglement generation and particle production, particularly when analytical methods become insufficient and numerical simulations are essential. By evolving an initial Bunch-Davies vacuum through a two-mode squeezer, we simulate the behavior of the von Neumann entropy and logarithmic negativity across a wide range of cosmological backgrounds, each characterized by a distinct equation of state. The von Neumann entropy obtained via QuGIT simulations is compared with analytic Rényi entropy bounds, thereby validating the accuracy of our circuit implementation of the cosmological squeezing Hamiltonian in both accelerating and decelerating scenarios. We further investigate the role of thermal noise and demonstrate how the von Neumann entropy and logarithmic negativity are affected by its presence.

Title: On the Determination of Collisional Stopping Power via Kaluza-Klein Theory
Authors: Seyda Elife Gönül, Huriye Gürsel
Abstract: In this work, the tools of general relativity are used to analytically derive collisional stopping power and a linkage between higher-dimensional field theory and transport phenomena is proposed. We start from a Kaluza-Klein inspired, five-dimensional diffeomorphism-invariant action, and upon compactification, obtain a four-dimensional effective theory in which the matter fields are treated to be brane-localized. The medium response to the projected electron is encoded in symmetric tensor fields coupled covariantly to both electromagnetic and fermionic parts via Lagrangian-derived interactions. When $R_c \sim \Lambda_{\text{EM}}^{-1}$, $\Lambda_{\text{EM}} \gg m_e$ and $g_4^2 = \frac{3\pi^2 m_e v}{4\gamma^3 R_c^2 e^2 \Lambda_{\text{EM}}}$ are satisfied, the leading term of Bethe-Møller formula is shown to be recovered in the large $R$ limit. The construction presented here may serve as an alternative approach that uses compactification geometry and medium excitations to determine observable couplings and stopping power. The model intrinsically supports phenomena linked to anisotropy and nonlinear response, as well as gravitational or extra-dimensional effects in laboratory-scale systems via the study of stopping power and particle range. The construction is gauge invariant, behaves consistently under limiting conditions, and can be matched to experimental stopping data through a single effective normalization constant.

Title: Atomic thermometry in optical lattice clocks
Authors: Irene Goti, Tommaso Petrucciani, Stefano Condio, Filippo Levi, Davide Calonico, Marco Pizzocaro
Abstract: Accurate measurement of atomic temperature is fundamental for a wide range of applications, from quantum sensing to precision metrology. In optical lattice clocks, precise characterization of atomic temperature is required to minimize systematic uncertainties at the $10^{-18}$ level. In this work, we investigate atomic temperature measurements in the ytterbium optical lattice clock developed at INRIM, IT-Yb1, employing sideband and Doppler spectroscopy across a wide range of trapping conditions. By implementing clock-line-mediated Sisyphus cooling [Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 053401 (2024)], we reduce the atomic temperature and enable operation at shallower lattice depths down to $D = 50E_{R}$. We compare temperature estimates obtained from the harmonic oscillator model with those derived using a Born-Oppenheimer-based approach [Phys. Rev. A 101, 053416 (2020)], which is expected to provide a more accurate description of atomic motion in both longitudinal and radial directions, especially for hotter atoms whose motion deviates from the harmonic regime. Discrepancies up to a factor of two in extracted temperatures are observed depending on the chosen model. We assess the impact of these modeling differences on the evaluation of lattice shifts and find relative frequency deviations up to $8\times10^{-17}$. Even though extended Sisyphus cooling reduces these inconsistencies to the $1\times10^{-18}$ level, residual biases may still limit the accuracy of optical lattice clocks.

Title: AEGISS -- Atomic orbital and Entropy-based Guided Inference for Space Selection -- A novel semi-automated active space selection workflow for quantum chemistry and quantum computing applications
Authors: Fabio Tarocco, Pi A. B. Haase, Fabijan Pavošević, Vijay Krishna, Leonardo Guidoni, Stefan Knecht, Martina Stella
Abstract: The selection of a balanced active space is a critical step in multi-reference quantum chemistry calculations, particularly for systems with strong electron correlation. Likewise, active space selection is a key to unlock the potential of contemporary quantum computing in quantum chemistry. Albeit recent progress, there remains a lack of a unified, robust, and fully automated framework for active space selection that performs reliably across a wide range of molecular systems. In this work, we present a novel approach inspired by both the AVAS (Atomic Valence Active Space) and AutoCAS methods. Our method unifies orbital entropy analysis with atomic orbital projections to guide the construction of chemically and physically meaningful active spaces. This integrated scheme enables a more consistent and flexible selection of active orbitals while retaining automation and scalability. We validate our approach on a set of molecular systems relevant to photodynamic therapy, in particular a set of Ru(II)-complexes, selected to span increasing levels of electron correlation and structural complexity. These molecules serve as challenging test cases due to the presence of strong static correlation and the need for highly accurate electronic structure descriptions. Our results demonstrate that the method can reliably identify compact, chemically intuitive active spaces that capture the essential physics, making it suitable for both classical and quantum computational frameworks. Furthermore, we have developed this approach in a package that is intuitive to use for users and can be interfaced with both standard quantum chemistry and quantum computing applications, making it accessible to a broad research community.

Title: Coupling of radial multiple SLE with Gaussian free field, and the hydrodynamic limit
Authors: Makoto Katori, Shinji Koshida, Chizuru Soukejima, Raian Suzuki
Abstract: Schramm--Loewner evolution (SLE) has been one of the central topics in the probabilistic study of two-dimensional critical systems. It is a random curve in two dimensions to which a cluster interface in a critical lattice system is supposed, or has been proved, to converge. The most archetypical setting for SLE is called chordal, where a random curve evolves in a simply-connected domain from a boundary point to another, whereas in its variant called radial, a random curve evolves from a boundary point to a distinguished interior point. Multiple SLE is a variant to another direction; it deals with multiple random curves, and it is a natural direction as there are certainly multiple cluster interfaces found in critical lattice systems. In this paper, we study multiple SLE in the radial setting, namely, radial multiple SLE. We report two main results. One is regarding coupling between radial multiple SLE and Gaussian free field (GFF). Coupling between SLE and GFF has been extensively studied in the chordal setting, and serves as a foundation for many recent developments. We show that coupling between radial multiple SLE and GFF occurs if and only if the radial multiple SLE is driven by the circular Dyson Brownian motions. The circular Dyson Brownian motions are a typical example of stochastic log-gases. This fact motivates us to study the hydrodynamic limit of the corresponding radial multiple SLE, which refers to the dynamical law of large numbers, when the number of curves tends to infinity. In our other main result, we provide explicit description of the hydrodynamic limit.

Title: Analytical phase boundary of a quantum driven-dissipative Kerr oscillator from classical stochastic instantons
Authors: Théo Sépulcre
Abstract: The framework of Keldysh path integral concisely describes quantum systems driven away from thermal equilibrium, such as the two-photon driven Kerr oscillator. Within the thermodynamic limit of diverging photon occupation, we map it to a Martin-Siggia-Rose-Janssen-de Dominicis path integral, and obtain a purely classical, stochastic equivalent where photon self-interaction plays the role of temperature. This perspective sheds light on the difficulties encountered in the search for an effective thermodynamic potential to describe the bistability of the model. It allows us to estimate the bistable tunneling rates using a real-time instanton technique leading to an analytical expression of the phase boundary, the first to our knowledge. It opens the way to powerful semi-analytical techniques to be applied to various quantum optics models displaying bistability.

Title: Double excitations in molecules
Authors: Namana Venkatareddy, Victor Ghosh, H. R. Krishnamurthy, Manish Jain
Abstract: Double excitations in organic molecules have garnered significant interest as a result of their importance in singlet fission and photophysics. These excitations play a crucial role in understanding the photoexcitation processes in polyenes. To describe photoexcited states with both single and double excitation character, we use a first-principles many-body theory that combines the GW / Bethe-Salpeter equation and the configuration interaction (CI) methods. Specifically, we develop and employ two CI-based methods: screened configuration interaction singles and doubles (scrCISD) and screened configuration interaction singles with perturbative doubles (scrCIS(D)), applied to an effective many-body Hamiltonian that incorporates screening. We apply these methods to Thiel's set of molecules, which exhibit excited states predominantly characterized by single excitations with a partial double excitation character. Our results indicate that the scrCISD method systematically underestimates the excitation energies compared to the best theoretical estimates, while the scrCIS(D) method shows good agreement with these estimates. Furthermore, we used the scrCISD method to calculate the binding energies of the dominantly doubly excited correlated triplet pair states, $\mathrm{TT^1}$, in pentacene dimers, finding that the $\mathrm{TT^1}$ binding energies agree well with empirical calculations.

Title: FDTRImageEnhancer: Combining Physics-Informed Deconvolution and Microstructure-Aware Deep Learning to Enhance Thermal Images
Authors: Alesanmi Richmond Rerelope Odufisan
Abstract: We present FDTRImageEnhancer, an open-source computational framework that improves thermal conductivity mapping from Frequency Domain ThermoReflectance (FDTR) phase data by integrating a physics-based Gaussian convolution abstraction with microstructure-aware deep learning. The Gaussian kernel models the spatial averaging effects of pump and probe beams, while k-means clustering of high-resolution structural images reduces the parameter space for inverse modeling. A physics-informed neural network jointly minimizes phase-data error and deviation from analytically recovered conductivity maps, enabling the detection of grain boundary thermal conductivity drops visually obscured in conventional FDTR inversions. Demonstrated on finite element-generated synthetic data, the framework recovers bulk values within less than 0.5% error and qualitatively resolves grain boundary effects despite limited image resolution. Full Python code and datasets are provided for reproducibility, with the methodology readily adaptable to other inverse thermal transport problems.

Abstract: X-ray free-electron lasers can nowadays deliver pairs of ultrabright, ultrashort light pulses with controllable delays at different photon energies. When combined with diffraction experiments, the interaction of these pulses with a sample at different times can produce two snapshots of an evolving system, enabling spatial and temporal resolution of ultrafast dynamics in nanomatter at and beyond the terahertz time scale. However, light detectors are orders of magnitude slower. The diffraction signals from the two pulses overlap in the recorded data and cannot be separated using currently available analysis methods. Here, we address this challenge by introducing Dichography, a diffraction imaging technique that restores the two unique views of the sample from superimposed scattering signals. We apply Dichography to experimental diffraction patterns of isolated xenon-doped superfluid helium nanodroplets, imaged using time-delayed, two-color X-ray pulses at intensities near the detection limit. The reconstructed images provide evidence of the survival of the xenon structures up to 750 fs after the interaction with the first shot. The capabilities of Dichography are further explored by applying the method to data from a second experiment, in which we retrieve the images of two distinct silver nanoparticles intercepted by the same light pulse. Dichography enables a new class of experiments for spatially and temporally resolving ultrafast phenomena, making a significant step toward the original promise of X-ray free-electron lasers to capture ultrafast movies of nanomatter.
