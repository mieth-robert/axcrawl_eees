Title: Anomalies of global symmetries on the lattice
Authors: Yi-Ting Tu, David M. Long, Dominic V. Else
Abstract: 't Hooft anomalies of global symmetries play a fundamental role in quantum many-body systems and quantum field theory (QFT). In this paper, we make a systematic analysis of lattice anomalies - the analog of 't Hooft anomalies in lattice systems - for which we give a precise definition. Crucially, a lattice anomaly is not a feature of a specific Hamiltonian, but rather is a topological invariant of the symmetry action. The controlled setting of lattice systems allows for a systematic and rigorous treatment of lattice anomalies, shorn of the technical challenges of QFT. We find that lattice anomalies reproduce the expected properties of QFT anomalies in many ways, but also have crucial differences. In particular, lattice anomalies and QFT anomalies are not, contrary to a common expectation, in one-to-one correspondence, and there can be non-trivial anomalies on the lattice that are infrared (IR) trivial: they admit symmetric trivial gapped ground states, and map to trivial QFT anomalies at low energies. Nevertheless, we show that lattice anomalies (including IR-trivial ones) have a number of interesting consequences in their own right, including connections to commuting projector models, phases of many-body localized (MBL) systems, and quantum cellular automata (QCA). We make substantial progress on the classification of lattice anomalies and develop several theoretical tools to characterize their consequences on symmetric Hamiltonians. Our work places symmetries of quantum many-body lattice systems into a unified theoretical framework and may also suggest new perspectives on symmetries in QFT.

Title: Magnetically ordered yet topologically robust phases emerging in concurrent Kitaev spin liquids
Authors: Muhammad Akram, Aayush Vijayvargia, Hae-Young Kee, Onur Erten
Abstract: Spin-orbital generalizations of Kitaev model, such as Yao-Lee model, have attracted recent attention due to their enhanced stability of spin liquid phases against perturbations. Motivated by microscopic calculations for the realization of Yao-Lee model showing additional interactions, we study the phase diagram of the Yao-Lee model with added Kitaev and Heisenberg terms. While the plaquette operator is conserved even in the presence of added perturbations, the model becomes no longer exactly solvable. Using perturbation and Majorana mean-field theory, we find magnetic order can arise in the spin sector while the orbital sector remains a liquid for dominant Kitaev interactions, whereas both sectors form liquid phases when Yao-Lee interactions dominate. Additional Heisenberg exchange can enhance or suppress the magnetic order, revealing a rich coexistence of magnetic and topological phases.

Title: Multiscale geometrical and topological learning in the analysis of soft matter collective dynamics
Authors: Tetiana Orlova, Amaranta Membrillo Solis, Hayley R. O. Sohn, Tristan Madeleine, Giampaolo D'Alessandro, Ivan I. Smalyukh, Malgosia Kaczmarek, Jacek Brodzki
Abstract: Understanding the behavior and evolution of a dynamical many-body system by analyzing patterns in their experimentally captured images is a promising method relevant for a variety of living and non-living self-assembled systems. The arrays of moving liquid crystal skyrmions studied here are a representative example of hierarchically organized materials that exhibit complex spatiotemporal dynamics driven by multiscale processes. Joint geometric and topological data analysis (TDA) offers a powerful framework for investigating such systems by capturing the underlying structure of the data at multiple scales. In the TDA approach, we introduce the $\Psi$-function, a robust numerical topological descriptor related to both the spatiotemporal changes in the size and shape of individual topological solitons and the emergence of regions with their different spatial organization. The geometric method based on the analysis of vector fields generated from images of skyrmion ensembles offers insights into the nonlinear physical mechanisms of the system's response to external stimuli and provides a basis for comparison with theoretical predictions. The methodology presented here is very general and can provide a characterization of system behavior both at the level of individual pattern-forming agents and as a whole, allowing one to relate the results of image data analysis to processes occurring in a physical, chemical, or biological system in the real world.

Title: Anomaly-free symmetries with obstructions to gauging and onsiteability
Authors: Wilbur Shirley, Carolyn Zhang, Wenjie Ji, Michael Levin
Abstract: We present counterexamples to the lore that symmetries that cannot be gauged or made on-site are necessarily anomalous. Specifically, we construct unitary, internal symmetries of two-dimensional lattice models that cannot be consistently coupled to background or dynamical gauge fields or disentangled to a tensor product of on-site operators. These symmetries are nevertheless anomaly-free in the sense that they admit symmetric, gapped Hamiltonians with unique, invertible ground states. We show that symmetries of this kind are characterized by an index $[\omega]\in H^2(G,\mathbb{Q}_+)$, where $\mathbb{Q}_+$ is the multiplicative group of rational numbers labeling one-dimensional quantum cellular automata.

Title: Topological indicators for systems with open boundaries: Application to the Kitaev wire
Authors: B. Hetényi, A. Lászlóffy, K. Penc, B. Újfalussy
Abstract: To clarify the relationship between edge electronic states in open-boundary crystalline systems and their corresponding bulk electronic structure, Alase et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 117, 076804 (2016)] have recently generalized Bloch's theorem to lattice models with broken translational symmetry. Their formalism provides a bulk-boundary correspondence indicator, D, sensitive directly to the localization of edge states. We extend this formalism in two significant ways. First, we explicitly classify the edge-state basis provided by the theory according to their underlying protecting symmetries. Second, acknowledging that the true topological invariant is the Zak phase, inherently defined only for periodic boundary conditions, we introduce an analogous quantity $\gamma_Z$, suitable for open-boundary systems. We illustrate these developments on the example of the Kitaev wire model. We demonstrate that both indicators, $D$ and our open-boundary analog, $\gamma_Z$, effectively capture topological localization: while D diverges within the topological phase, $\gamma_Z = \pi$ . We further examine eigenvalues ($z$) of the lattice shift operator, showing that variations in these eigenvalues as a function of chemical potential provide additional signatures of topological phase transitions. Additionally, we study a periodic Kitaev wire containing a bond impurity, revealing that while the topological phase remains characterized by $\gamma_Z = \pi$, significant state localization near the impurity emerges only at critical values of the chemical potential.

Title: Out-of-equilibrium spinodal-like scaling behaviors across the magnetic first-order transitions of 2D and 3D Ising systems
Authors: Andrea Pelissetto, Ettore Vicari
Abstract: We study the out-of-equilibrium scaling behavior of two-dimensional and three-dimensional Ising systems, when they are slowly driven across their {\em magnetic} first-order transitions at low temperature $T<T_c$, where $T_c$ is the temperature of their continuous transition. We consider Kibble-Zurek (KZ) protocols in which a spatially homogenous magnetic field $h$ varies as $h(t)=t/t_s$ with a time scale $t_s$. The KZ dynamics starts from negatively-magnetized configurations equilibrated at $h_i<0$ and stops at a positive value of $h$ where the configurations acquire a positive average magnetization. We consider the Metropolis and the heat-bath dynamics, which are two specific examples of a purely relaxational dynamics. We focus on two different dynamic regimes. We consider the out-equilibrium finite-size scaling (OFSS) limit in which the system size $L$ and the time scale $t_s$ diverge simultaneously, keeping an appropriate combination fixed. Then, we analyze the KZ dynamics in the thermodynamic limit (TL), obtained by taking first the $L\to\infty$ limit at fixed $t$ and $t_s$, and then considering the scaling behavior in the large-$t_s$ limit. Our numerical results provide evidence of OFSS, as predicted by general scaling arguments. The results in the TL show the emergence of spinodal-like behaviors: The passage from the negatively-magnetized phase to the positively-magnetized one occurs at positive values $h_*>0$ of the magnetic field, which decrease as $h_* \sim 1/(\ln t_s)^\kappa$, with $\kappa = 2$ and $\kappa=1$ in two and three dimensions, respectively, for $t_s\to\infty$. We identify $\sigma \equiv t (\ln t)^\kappa/t_s$ as the relevant scaling variable associated with the KZ dynamics in the TL.

Title: Heterogeneous Ensemble Enables a Universal Uncertainty Metric for Atomistic Foundation Models
Authors: Kai Liu, Zixiong Wei, Wei Gao, Poulumi Dey, Marcel H.F. Sluiter, Fei Shuang
Abstract: Universal machine learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs) are reshaping atomistic simulation as foundation models, delivering near \textit{ab initio} accuracy at a fraction of the cost. Yet the lack of reliable, general uncertainty quantification limits their safe, wide-scale use. Here we introduce a unified, scalable uncertainty metric \(U\) based on a heterogeneous model ensemble with reuse of pretrained uMLIPs. Across chemically and structurally diverse datasets, \(U\) shows a strong correlation with the true prediction errors and provides a robust ranking of configuration-level risk. Leveraging this metric, we propose an uncertainty-aware model distillation framework to produce system-specific potentials: for W, an accuracy comparable to full-DFT training is achieved using only \(4\%\) of the DFT labels; for MoNbTaW, no additional DFT calculations are required. Notably, by filtering numerical label noise, the distilled models can, in some cases, surpass the accuracy of the DFT reference labels. The uncertainty-aware approach offers a practical monitor of uMLIP reliability in deployment, and guides data selection and fine-tuning strategies, thereby advancing the construction and safe use of foundation models and enabling cost-efficient development of accurate, system-specific potentials.

Title: REBCO delamination by transverse electromagnetic stress due to screening current in magnetic field
Authors: Jun Lu, Jeremy Levitan, Yu Suetomi, Iain Dixon, Jan Jaroszynski
Abstract: REBCO coated conductor has great potential to be used in ultra-high field magnets. Commercial REBCO tapes are strong in the longitudinal direction but prone to delamination by tensile stress in the thickness direction. For high field magnet applications, it is crucial to characterize delamination strength of REBCO conductor and better manage the transverse electromagnetic stress. In this work, the electromagnetic stress in high magnetic fields by screen current is used to study the delamination behavior of commercial REBCO tapes. Screening currents are induced in REBCO by either ramping field or rotating sample in magnetic fields up to 35 T. The experimental results are presented. The prospect of using this method for quality assurance in large magnet projects is discussed.

Title: Large-scale characterization of Single-Hole Transistors in 22-nm FDSOI CMOS Technology
Authors: Thomas H. Swift, Alberto Gomez-Saiz, Virginia N. Ciriano-Tejel, David F. Wise, Grayson M. Noah, John J. L. Morton, M. Fernando Gonzalez-Zalba, Mark A. I. Johnson
Abstract: State-of-the-art quantum processors have recently grown to reach 100s of physical qubits. As the number of qubits continues to grow, new challenges associated with scaling arise, such as device variability reduction and integration with cryogenic electronics for I/O management. Spin qubits in silicon quantum dots provide a platform where these problems may be mitigated, having demonstrated high control and readout fidelities and compatibility with large-scale manufacturing techniques of the semiconductor industry. Here, we demonstrate the monolithic integration of 384 p-type quantum dots, each embedded in a silicon transistor, with on-chip digital and analog electronics, all operating at deep cryogenic temperatures. The chip is fabricated using 22-nm fully-depleted silicon-on-insulator (FDSOI) CMOS technology. We extract key quantum dot parameters by fast readout and automated machine learning routines to determine the link between device dimensions and quantum dot yield, variability, and charge noise figures. Overall, our results demonstrate a path to monolithic integration of quantum and classical electronics at scale.

Title: Configurational Entropy and Adam-Gibbs Relation for Quantum Liquids
Authors: Yang Zhou, Ali Eltareb, Gustavo E. Lopez, Nicolas Giovambattista
Abstract: As a liquid approaches the glass state, its dynamics slows down rapidly, by a few orders of magnitude in a very small temperature range. In the case of light elements and small molecules containing hydrogen (e.g., water), such a process can be affected by nuclear quantum effects (due to quantum fluctuations/atoms delocalization). In this work, we apply the potential energy landscape (PEL) formalism and path-integral computer simulations to study the low-temperature behavior of a Lennard-Jones binary mixture (LJBM) that obeys quantum mechanics. We show that, as for the case of classical liquids, (i) a configurational entropy $S_{IS}$ can be defined, and (ii) the Adam-Gibbs equation, which relates the diffusion coefficient of a liquid and its $S_{IS}$, holds for the studied quantum LJBM. Overall, our work shows that one theoretical approach, the PEL formalism, can be used to describe low-temperature liquids close to their glass transition, independently of whether the system obeys classical or quantum mechanics.

Title: Charge-Transfer Complex $κ$-(BEST)$_2$Cu$_2$(CN)$_3$ Analogous to Organic Spin Liquid Candidate
Authors: Takuya Kobayashi, Kent Andrew Sakurai, Shinji Michimura, Hiromi Taniguchi
Abstract: We report the structural, electrical, and magnetic properties of the organic conductor $\kappa$-(BEST)$_2$Cu$_2$(CN)$_3$ (BEST: bis(ethylenediseleno)tetrathiafulvalene; abbreviated as $\kappa$-BEST-CN), which is isostructural with the quantum spin liquid candidate $\kappa$-(ET)$_2$Cu$_2$(CN)$_3$ (ET: bis(ethylenedithio)tetrathiafulvalene; abbreviated as $\kappa$-ET-CN). Resistivity measurements demonstrate that $\kappa$-BEST-CN exhibits semiconducting behavior, governed by the same conducting mechanism as $\kappa$-ET-CN. Under a pressure of ~0.1 GPa, $\kappa$-BEST-CN undergoes a superconducting transition with an onset temperature of ~4 K. From the comparison of the critical pressures of superconductivity between $\kappa$-ET-CN and $\kappa$-BEST-CN, $\kappa$-BEST-CN can be regarded as a chemically pressurized analogue of $\kappa$-ET-CN. Therefore, $\kappa$-BEST-CN, in which only the effective pressure changes without altering the anion structure, is considered a valuable reference material for elucidating the enigmatic properties observed in $\kappa$-ET-CN. Furthermore, the spin susceptibility of $\kappa$-BEST-CN is slightly larger than that of $\kappa$-ET-CN and shows weaker temperature dependence, which cannot be explained by the localized spin model. This behavior clarifies the anomalous magnetic properties of a system with frustration near the Mott transition, serving to stimulate future theoretical research.

Title: Investigating the effects of local environment on nitrogen vacancies in high entropy metal nitrides
Authors: Charith R. DeSilva (1), Matthew D. Witman (2), Dallas R. Trinkle (1) ((1) Materials Science and Engineering Department, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, (2) Sandia National Laboratories, Livermore, CA)
Abstract: High entropy metal nitrides are an important material class in a variety of applications, and the role of nitrogen vacancies is of great importance for understanding their stability and mechanical properties. We study six different high entropy nitrides with eight different metal species to build a predictive model of the nitrogen vacancy formation energy. We construct sets of supercells that maximize the number of unique nitrogen environments for a given chemistry, and then use density-functional theory to calculate the energy density for all nitrogen sites, and the vacancy formation energies for the highest, lowest, and a median subset based on the energy densities. The energy density of nitrogen sites correlates with the vacancy formation energies, for binary, ternary and high entropy nitrides. A linear regression model predicts the vacancy formation energies using only the nearest-neighbor composition; across our eight metals, we find the largest vacancy formation energies next to Hf, then Zr, Ti, V, Cr, Ta, Nb, and the lowest near Mo. Additionally, we see that binary nitride data shows qualitatively similar vacancy formation energy trends for high entropy nitrides; however, the binary data alone is insufficient to predict the complex nitride behavior. Our model is both predictive and easily interpretable, and correlates with experimental data.

Title: Excitation and tunneling spectra of a fractional quantum Hall system in the thin cylinder limit
Authors: Jyesta M. Adhidewata, Joel E. Moore
Abstract: The excitations of fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) states have been largely inaccessible to experimental probes until recently. New electron scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) results from Hu this http URL. (2023) show promise in detecting and identifying these excited states via the local density of states (LDOS) spectrum. On a torus, there exists a mapping to a 1D lattice Hamiltonian with center-of-mass or dipole moment conservation. In this work, we apply perturbation theory starting from the thin cylinder limit ($L_x \rightarrow \infty, L_y <l_B$ for torus dimensions $L_x$ and $L_y$) to obtain an analytical approach to the low-lying neutral and charged excitations of the $\nu =1/3$ FQHE state. Notably, in the thin cylinder we can systematically enumerate all the low-lying excitations by the patterns of 'dipoles' formed by the electron occupation pattern on the 1D lattice. We find that the thin-cylinder limit predicts a significant dispersion of the low-lying neutral excitations but sharpness of the LDOS spectra, which measure charged excitations. We also discuss connections between our work and several different approaches to the FQHE STM spectra, including those using the composite fermion theory. Numerical exact diagonalization beyond the thin-cylinder limit suggests that the energies of charged excitations remain largely confined to a narrow range of energies, which in experiments might appear as a single peak.

Title: High-resolution Measurements of Thermal Conductivity Matrix and Search for Thermal Hall Effect in La$_2$CuO$_4$
Authors: Jiayi Hu, Haozhi Xu, Juntao Yao, Genda Gu, Qiang Li, N. P. Ong
Abstract: We investigated the longitudinal thermal conductivity $\kappa_{xx}$ and thermal hall conductivity $\kappa_{xy}$ in La$_2$CuO$_4$ at temperatures $T$ between 2 and 20 K in magnetic fields $H$ up to 10 T. Within the temperature and field intervals studied, we do not resolve any thermal Hall signal with a conservative upper bound of $|\kappa_{xy}/T| <1\times10^{-4}$ ${\rm Wm^{-1}K^{-2}}$. The longitudinal thermal conductivity $\kappa_{xx}/T$ agrees well with previous studies, in both magnitude and $T$ dependence. In both channels, we performed measurements using the field-sweep protocol. To achieve high resolution, we carefully took into account relaxation effects after each step-increase in $H$. At low $T$, we find a linear decrease in $\kappa/T$ vs. $H$, as well as weak hysteresis near the meta-magnetic transition of the spin degrees.

Title: Field-free Superconducting Diode Effect and Topological Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov Superconductivity in Altermagnetic Shiba Chains
Authors: Dibyendu Samanta, Sudeep Kumar Ghosh
Abstract: The superconducting diode effect (SDE), characterized by a directional asymmetry in the critical supercurrents, typically requires external magnetic fields to break time-reversal symmetry -- posing challenges for scalability and device integration. Here, we demonstrate a field-free realization of the SDE in a helical Shiba chain proximitized by a d-wave altermagnet. Using a self-consistent Bogoliubov-de Gennes approach, we uncover a topological Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) superconducting state that hosts tunable Majorana zero modes at the chain ends. This state is stabilized by the interplay between the exchange coupling of magnetic adatoms and the induced altermagnetic spin splitting. Crucially, the same FFLO phase supports strong nonreciprocal supercurrents, achieving diode efficiencies exceeding 45% without applied magnetic fields. The d-wave altermagnet plays a dual role: it intrinsically breaks time-reversal symmetry, enabling topological superconductivity, and introduces inversion symmetry breaking via momentum-dependent spin-splitting, driving the field-free SDE in a junction-free setting. The supercurrent-controlled finite Cooper pair momentum of the FFLO state modulates both the topological gap and the diode response. Our results establish the Shiba chain-altermagnet heterostructure as a promising platform for realizing topological superconducting devices with efficient, intrinsic superconducting diode functionality -- offering a scalable pathway towards dissipationless quantum technologies.

Title: Magneto-cubic and magneto-linear dependence observed in an in-plane anomalous Hall magnet
Authors: Ayano Nakamura, Shinichi Nishihaya, Mitsuru Akaki, Motoi Kimata, Kenta Sudo, Yuki Deguchi, Hsiang Lee, Tadashi Yoneda, Masaki Kondo, Hiroaki Ishizuka, Masashi Tokunaga, Masaki Uchida
Abstract: The Hall effect, particularly that arising from in-plane magnetic field, has recently emerged as a sensitive probe of quantum geometric properties in solids. Especially in trigonal systems, in-plane anomalous Hall effect (AHE) can be explicitly induced by nontrivial off-diagonal coupling between the magnetic field and the Hall vector on the principal plane. Here we elucidate multipolar dependence of the off-diagonal coupling in the in-plane AHE, by systematically measuring on the (001) principal plane of trigonal antiferromagnet EuCd2Sb2 thin films for each magnetic phase. Around zero field, magneto-cubic dependence of anomalous Hall resistivity is clearly observed not only in the paramagnetic phase but also even in the antiferromagnetic phase. An off-diagonal component of the octupolar tensor also exhibits unconventional decay above the magnetic ordering temperature, roughly depending on the inverse temperature to the third power. In the forced ferromagnetic phase, on the other hand, magneto-linear dependence dominantly appears and notably persists up to very high fields. Our findings clarify key aspects of the off-diagonal coupling in the in-plane AHE, paving the way for its future investigations and potential applications beyond conventional expectations about the Hall effect.

Title: Lifting spin degeneracy in rhombohedral trilayer graphene for high magnetoresistance applications
Authors: Lishu Zhang, Jun Zhou, Jie Yang, Sumit Ghosh, Yi-Ming Zhao, Yuan Ping Feng, Lei Shen
Abstract: Many exotic properties in rhombohedral (or ABC-stacked) multilayer graphene have recently been reported experimentally. In this Letter, we first reveal the underlying mechanism of spin degeneracy lifting in rhombohedral trilayer graphene. Then, we propose a design concept for all-rhombohedral graphene-based magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) by utilizing pristine, back-gated, and top-gated ABC-stacked trilayer graphene, which exhibit semimetallic (conducting), semiconducting (insulating), and half-metallic (ferromagnetic) behavior, respectively. This enables the realization of an "all-in-one" magnetic tunnel junction based entirely on trilayer graphene. This design enables voltage-controlled spintronics (lower power than conventional MTJs) with perfect interfacial matching and sub-nm thickness uniformity across 4-inch wafers. Using first-principles calculations and the non-equilibrium Greens function, we comprehensively study electronic structures and transport properties of these all-graphene MTJs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that their characteristics can be tuned via a perpendicular electric field and electron doping. Our findings offer a new concept for the development of fully graphene-based spintronic devices utilizing the three distinct electronic phases of rhombohedral trilayer graphene.

Title: Gateways to Orbital and Spin Hall Effects in Rh-Doped Altermagnetic RuO$_2$
Authors: Lishu Zhang
Abstract: Ruthenium dioxide (RuO$_2$) has recently emerged as a prototypical material for exploring the fundamental properties of altermagnets. In this work, we investigate the impact of Rhodium (Rh) doping on the electronic and transport characteristics of altermagnetic RuO$_2$ using first-principles calculations. We show that Rh substitution at Ru sites modifies the spin-splitting of electronic bands across momentum space and reshapes the spin-resolved Fermi surface topology. These changes are found to significantly influence both the spin Hall and orbital Hall effects. In particular, we demonstrate that the orbital Berry curvature is strongly modulated by the doping concentration, opening new avenues for tuning orbital transport responses in multi-orbital systems without relying on strong spin-orbit coupling. Our results suggest that Rh-doped RuO$_2$ provides a versatile platform for engineering spin and orbital Hall effects in altermagnetic materials, and contributes to the growing efforts in designing next-generation orbitronic and spintronic devices.

Title: Avalanche activity noises in sandpile models
Authors: Rahul Chhimpa, Avinash Chand Yadav
Abstract: We consider the Bak-Tang-Wiesenfeld (BTW) and the Manna sandpile models of self-organized criticality. In the models, previous studies revealed a signature of long-range temporal correlations in the avalanche activity. We examine the power spectra of the noises with different system sizes and find that the power spectrum for a finite-size system exhibits three distinct frequency regimes: (i) a frequency-independent behavior below a lower cutoff frequency, (ii) a hump-type behavior in the intermediate-frequency regime, and (iii) a power-law scaling $1/f^{\alpha}$ in the high-frequency regime. The power scales with the system size in all regimes, but with different exponents. Also, the lower cutoff and peak frequencies decay in a power-law manner with the system size. We apply finite-size scaling and obtain data collapse for the power spectra, corroborating the estimation of the scaling exponents. Our studies reveal subtle scaling features for the temporal correlation within the avalanches.

Title: Non-interacting fractional topological Stark insulator
Authors: Yi-Hong Chen, Si-Yuan Chen, Xin-Chi Zhou, Xiong-Jun Liu
Abstract: Fractional topological phases, such as the fractional quantum Hall state, usually rely on strong interactions to generate ground state degeneracy with gap protection and fractionalized topological response. Here, we propose a fractional topological phase without interaction in $(1+1)$-dimension, which is driven by the Stark localization on top of topological flat bands, different from the conventional mechanism of the strongly correlated fractional topological phases. A linear potential gradient applied to the flat bands drives the Stark localization, under which the Stark localized states may hybridize and leads to a new gap in the real space, dubbed the real space energy gap (RSEG). Unlike the integer topological band insulator obtained in the weak linear potential regime without closing the original bulk gap, the fractional topological Stark insulating phase is resulted from the RSEG when the linear potential gradient exceeds a critical value. We develop a theoretical formalism to characterize the fractional topological Stark insulator, and further show that the many-body state under topological pumping returns to the initial state only after multiple $2\pi$ periods of evolution, giving the fractional charge pumping, similar to that in fractional quantum Hall state. Finally, we propose how to realize the fractional topological Stark insulator in real experiment.

Title: Revisiting THz absorption in GO and rGO liquid crystalline films
Authors: A. Vasilev, M. Zhezhu, H. Parsamyan, G. Baghdasaryan, M. Sargsyan, D.A. Ghazaryan, H. Gharagulyan
Abstract: With a swift progress in modern high-throughput communication systems, security, sensing and medicine utilizing THz range technologies, the demand for easy-to-fabricate, lightweight and high-performance absorbing materials has increased drastically. Notably, traditional approaches of eliminating unwanted radiation based on metasurfaces often face fabrication challenges limiting their practicality. In this study, we propose a straightforward approach for fabricating graphene oxide (GO) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) liquid crystalline (LC) films via the vacuum filtration method and investigate their THz absorption characteristics. Here, the presence of LC phase in our electrochemically exfoliated GO and rGO LC films was confirmed by ellipsometric characterization. THz time-domain spectroscopy (TDS) measurements reveal that these films possess a low reflectance and transmittance confirming their strong absorptive properties within 0.4 - 1.6 THz frequency range for 2 micrometer thick GO and rGO LC films. Particularly, the GOLC film shows 37 % average absorption at a thickness of 2.12 micrometer, which is 221 times smaller than the central wavelength. Similarly, the rGOLC film reaches 50 % absorption with a 1.68 micrometer thickness, 279 times smaller than the central wavelength. These findings provide valuable insights for development of GO- and rGO-based LC THz absorbers with highly tunable properties due to the ordering of GO flakes. Specifically, the LC phase of GO contributes to the formation of more uniform films with enhanced absorption due to the compact stacking and denser packing, compared to conventional GO films with randomly oriented GO flakes.

Title: Infrared Spectral Signature of Water as a Probe to Demystify Urea Aggregation and Force Field Accuracy
Authors: Pankaj Adhikary, Rajib Biswas
Abstract: Urea is widely used as a protein denaturant. However, the potential of urea to form self-assembled structures at higher concentrations and the influence of its self-interactions on water structure and dynamics remains elusive. This open question demands tracking of molecular-level rearrangements. In this work, we explore the influence of urea on local structure of water and dynamics and relate it to urea self-association. We correlate vibrational spectral response and orientational dynamics of water with concentration-dependent self-association of urea by looking at the interface surface area, hydrogen bond strength, and population of relevant donor-acceptor pairs. We compare the response of four urea force fields (KBFF, OPLS-S, OPLS-AA-D, GAFF-D3) with simple point charge extented water. The KBFF model reproduces experimental IR spectra. Both variants of the Duffy model (OPLS-S, OPLS-AA-D) show blue shifts with reasonable broadening and intense concentration-dependent responses, while GAFF-D3 shows random peak shifts with prominent broadening. Regarding urea self-aggregation, KBFF is mildly repulsive, Duffy models are attractive, and GAFF-D3 is neutral with high variability. Only KBFF and GAFF-D3 capture the expected deceleration in water-orientational dynamics. We conclude urea does not self-aggregate significantly in water, even at higher concentrations. KBFF emerges as the most reliable classical non-polarizable model of urea for capturing both structural and dynamic properties of water.

Title: Dynamics of a Mobile Ion in a Bose-Einstein Condensate
Authors: Piotr Wysocki, Marek Tylutki, Krzysztof Jachymski
Abstract: Characterization of the dynamics of an impurity immersed in a quantum medium is vital for fundamental understanding of matter as well as applications in modern day quantum technologies. The case of strong and long-ranged interactions is of particular importance here, as it opens the possibility to leverage quantum correlations in controlling the system properties. Here, we consider a charged impurity moving in a bosonic gas and study its properties out of equilibrium. We extract the stationary momentum of the ion at long times, which is nonzero due to the superfluid nature of the medium, and the effective mass which stems from dressing the impurity with the host atoms. The nonlinear evolution leads not only to emission of density waves, but also momentum transfer back to the ion, resulting in the possibility of oscillatory dynamics.

Title: Electronic localization and optical activity of strain-engineered transition-metal dichalcogenide nanobubbles
Authors: Stefan Velja, Alexander Steinhoff, Jannis Krumland, Christopher Gies, Caterina Cocchi
Abstract: Strain-engineered transition-metal dichalcogenide nanobubbles are promising platforms for quantum emission, as revealed by recent experimental observations. In this work, we present an ab initio investigation of MoS$_2$, WS$_2$, MoSe$_2$, and WSe$_2$ nanobubbles, linking their structural and electronic properties to predictions of their optical activity. Inflating forces yield tunable geometries with non-uniform, apex-concentrated strain, which is sensitive to material rigidity. Strain modifies band gaps and universally induces non-dispersive valence states, exhibiting composition-dependent wave-function character, as revealed by an in-depth analysis of band structures and orbital contributions. Crucially, transitions from these apex-localized valence states are predominantly dark. This characteristic is attributed to their localization at the $\Gamma$-point, inhibiting transitions to the lowest unoccupied states that reside at the K-valley. While revealing that the herein considered sub-10-nm nanobubbles fall short as single-photon emitters, our findings provide essential understanding of the structure-property relations in emerging quantum materials, providing robust design rules to optimize their characteristics for novel quantum applications.

Title: Theoretical investigations of the origin of persistent luminescence in spinel oxides MgGa2O4 and MgAl2O4
Authors: Xiuli Yang, Ran Zhou, Hongliang Shi, Yifeng Duan, Mao-Hua Du
Abstract: MgGa2O4 and MgAl2O4 have attracted significant interest due to their unique intrinsic persistent luminescence, offering promising potential for various applications. In this paper, from the perspective of defect physics, we systemically investigate the origin of persistent luminescence phenomena in pristine MgGa2O4 and MgAl2O4, employing accurate hybrid functional calculations. Our results show that vacancies and antisite defects involving the two cations are the dominant point defects in both materials. Our calculated optical excitation and emission peaks associated with the MgGa defect agree well with the experimentally observed blue luminescence peak at about 2.9 eV in MgGa2O4. In MgAl2O4, the intradefect optical transition within the VO-MgAl donor-acceptor defect complex is identified as a likely origin for the observed 2.7 eV emission peak. Furthermore, the calculated radiative recombination coefficients of MgGa and VO-MgAl are significantly higher than their nonradiative counterparts, supporting their roles as efficient luminescent centers. Our results regarding the optical processes of oxygen vacancy VO in MgGa2O4 and MgAl2O4 are also in good agreement with experimental results. Based on the calculated defect thermodynamic transition levels, the intrinsic persistent luminescence in MgGa2O4 and MgAl2O4 may be attributed to electron traps, GaMg and VO, in the former and a hole trap, MgAl, in the latter. Donor-acceptor defect complexes (VO+VMg and VO+VGa) are also found to serve as effective carrier trapping centers in MgGa2O4. The calculated trap depths are also consistent with thermoluminescence spectroscopy measurements.

Title: Metastability of 2D-material-on-metal-islands structures
Authors: V.A. Ievleva, V.A. Prudkoglyad, L.A. Morgun, A.Yu. Kuntsevich
Abstract: The integration of 2D materials with artificially textured substrates offers exceptional opportunities for engineering novel functional devices. A straightforward technological route towards such devices is a mechanical dry or wet transfer of 2D layer or heterostructure onto prepared patterned elements with subsequent van der Waals bonding. Using hBN/graphene heterostructures transferred onto metallic island arrays as a model system, we reveal that thermal cycling between room and cryogenic temperatures leads to irreversible changes in electronic properties. This breakdown of reproducibility stems from the temperature-dependent redistribution of interfacial water or organic residues, which disrupts van der Waals bonding via a hydrophobic collapse mechanism. Our findings establish constraints for low-temperature applications of transferred 2D devices while providing insights into interfacial stability in van der Waals heterostructures.

Title: What exactly is 'active matter'?
Authors: Michael te Vrugt, Benno Liebchen, Michael E. Cates
Abstract: As the study of active matter has developed into one of the most rapidly growing subfields of condensed matter physics, more and more kinds of physical systems have been included in this framework. While the word 'active' is often thought of as referring to self-propelled particles, it is also applied to a large variety of other systems such as non-polar active nematics or certain particles with non-reciprocal interactions. Developing novel forms of active matter, as attempted, e.g., in the framework of quantum active matter, requires a clear idea of what active matter is. Here, we critically discuss how the understanding of active matter has changed over time, what precisely a definition of 'active matter' can look like, and to what extent it is (still) possible to define active matter in a way that covers all systems that are commonly understood as active matter while distinguishing them from other driven systems. Moreover, we discuss the definition of an 'active field theory', where 'active' is used as an attribute of a theoretical model rather than of a physical system. We show that the usage of the term 'active' requires agreement on a coarse-grained viewpoint. We discuss the meaning of 'active' both in general terms and via the specific examples of chemically driven particles, ultrasound-driven particles, active nematics, particles with non-reciprocal interactions, intracellular phase separation, and quantum active matter.

Title: Dual effect of cholesterol on interfacial water dynamics in lipid membranes: Interplay between membrane packing and hydration
Authors: Kokoro Shikata, Kento Kasahara, Nozomi Morishita Watanabe, Hiroshi Umakoshi, Kang Kim, Nobuyuki Matubayasi
Abstract: Water contained within biological membranes plays a critical role in maintaining the separation between intracellular and extracellular environments and facilitating biochemical processes. Variations in membrane composition and temperature lead to phase state changes in lipid membranes, which in turn influence the structure and dynamics of the associated interfacial water. In this study, molecular dynamics simulations were performed on binary membranes composed of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) or palmitoyl sphingomyelin (PSM) mixed with cholesterol (Chol). To elucidate the effects of Chol on interfacial water, we examined the orientation and hydrogen-bonding behavior of water molecules spanning from the membrane interior to the interface. As the Chol concentration increased, a transient slow down in water dynamics was observed in the gel phase at 303 K. Conversely, at higher Chol concentrations, water dynamics were accelerated relative to pure lipid membranes across all temperatures studied. Specifically, at a Chol concentration of 50%, the hydrogen bond lifetime in DPPC membranes decreased to approximately 0.5-0.7 times that of pure lipid membranes. This nonmonotonic behavior is attributed to the combined effects of membrane packing induced by Chol and a reduced density of lipid molecules in the hydrophilic region, offering key insights for modulating the dynamical properties of interfacial water.

Title: Quantum Interference and Rashba Spin-Orbit Coupling in a Chain of Planar Quantum Rings: Effects on Magnetic and Transport Properties
Authors: Armen Harutyunyan
Abstract: Magneto-transport properties of a two-dimensional electron gas in a chain of planar quantum rings are investigated under the Rashba spin-orbit interaction and a transverse homogeneous magnetic field. A modulation potential function models the ring-chain periodicity along one direction and the confinement in the perpendicular one. The electron energy minibands collapse into discrete levels with high degeneracy at specific magnetic field values. The Rashba effect significantly influences the system's properties. Calculations reveal a transition from diamagnetic to paramagnetic behavior in the spin-difference orbital magnetization at high Rashba coupling strengths. This is consistent with the reversal of the spin-difference persistent current observed at the same Rashba values. Total and spin-difference magnetizations exhibit oscillations linked to miniband nodes. The longitudinal magnetoconductance component shows oscillations resembling Shubnikov-De Haas behavior, while the transverse component displays a ladder-like profile reminiscent of the quantum Hall effect. However, both phenomena are more closely associated with the periodic collapse of minibands, leading to strong density-of-states oscillations, rather than with the mechanisms behind the quantum Hall effect. This highlights the rich physics of quantum topological phases in nanostructures with non-trivial geometry. At high Rashba coupling, this behavior degrades. Spin magnetization shows pronounced oscillations, indicating complex interplay between the Zeeman and Rashba effects on spin polarization. These results offer insights into experimentally relevant electronic and spin characteristics attainable in modulated semiconductor structures, contributing to the development of advanced 2D-based materials for magneto-transport and spintronics applications.

Title: De Haas - van Alphen study of the Dirac nodal-line semimetal candidate TaPtTe$_5$
Authors: Maximilian Daschner, F. Malte Grosche
Abstract: We report a quantum oscillation study in the Dirac nodal-line semimetal candidate TaPtTe$_5$. The Fermi surface is probed via magnetic torque measurements with the magnetic field applied in the crystallographic a-b and b-c planes. The experimentally determined de Haas - van Alphen frequencies are consistent with results from band structure calculations. This study serves as an extension to the scarce quantum oscillation data on TaPtTe$_5$ currently present in the literature.

Title: Ultralow Lattice Thermal Conductivity Induced by Quasi-Chain Configuration in Rb2Se3
Authors: Tiantian Jia, Yongsen Tang, Yongsheng Zhang
Abstract: Alkali metal-based compounds have garnered significant attention due to their exceptionally low lattice thermal conductivity, which is crucial for applications in thermoelectric energy conversion and thermal barrier coatings. However, the fundamental mechanisms underlying such ultralow lattice thermal conductivity remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigate the intrinsic origins of the ultralow lattice thermal conductivity in the alkali metal-based ionic compound Rb2Se3, which exhibits a simple orthorhombic structure. By employing first-principles density functional theory (DFT) and solving the phonon Boltzmann transport equation (BTE), we reveal that Rb2Se3 achieves lattice thermal conductivity values below 0.2 W/mK along all crystallographic directions at 300 K. Our analysis uncovers a unique quasi-chain configuration within the crystal structure, characterized by strongly covalent Se-Se-Se trimers that act as localized rigid units, while Rb atoms occupy weakly bonded interstitial sites. This configuration induces pronounced anisotropy, weak bonding, and strong anharmonicity, leading to significant rattling-like behavior of all atoms and a dominance of low-frequency phonon modes. The interplay between the rigid Se trimers and the soft Rb matrix results in extreme phonon anharmonicity, as evidenced by large Gruneisen parameters and high atomic displacement parameters (ADPs). These findings provide a comprehensive understanding of the low lattice thermal conductivity in Rb2Se3 and establish a universal framework for designing low lattice thermal conductivity materials through the combination of rigid covalent clusters and soft ionic sublattices.

Title: Field driven Metal-Insulator transition in rhombohedral Bismuth and Arsenic crystals
Authors: N.K. Karn, Mukul S.Laad, V.P.S. Awana
Abstract: The metal to insulator (MIT) transition is accompanied with huge changes in physical responses by the control and tuning of experimental parameters like doping, pressure, chemical composition, and magnetic field. Here, we study the magnetic field driven MIT for two pnictides in their elemental form, namely Arsenic and Bismuth. At low temperatures, Bismuth shows an unusual behaviour of a re-entrant IMT at high fields in addition to a higher temperature MIT at smaller fields. However, Arsenic shows the commonly observed single MIT. The Shubnikov de Haas (SdH) oscillations are observed for both As and Bi below 10 K, elucidating their two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) behaviour at low temperatures. Giant magneto-resistance of the order of 10^5 percent (MR percent) is observed for both crystals at 2 K and 14 Tesla transverse magnetic field. Based on a microscopic model, the microscopic processes underpinning the unusual features of a field-driven MIT and re-entrant IMT, along with the relevance of both excitonic and Bose metal correlations near these incipient instabilities, are qualitatively described in the framework of field-driven excitonic condensate and Das-Doniach preformed pair scenarios in one single picture.

Title: Dielectric Properties of Single Crystal Calcium Tungstate
Authors: Elrina Hartman, Michael E Tobar, Ben T McAllister, Jeremy F Bourhill, Andreas Erb, Maxim Goryachev
Abstract: This investigation employed microwave whispering gallery mode (WGM) analysis to characterize the dielectric properties of a cylindrical, single-crystal sample of calcium tungstate (CaWO$_4$). Through investigation of quasi-transverse\hyp{}magnetic and quasi-transverse\hyp{}electric mode families, we can assess loss mechanisms and relative permittivity from room temperature down to cryogenic conditions. We report the biaxial permittivity values of $\epsilon_{||} = 9.029 \pm 0.09$ and $\epsilon_{\perp} = 10.761 \pm 0.11$ at $295$ K, and $\epsilon_{||} = 8.797 \pm 0.088$ and $\epsilon_{\perp} = 10.442 \pm 0.104$ at $4$ K. Components are denoted with respect to the c\hyp{}axis of the crystal unit cell. The parallel component agrees well with the published literature at MHz frequencies; however, the perpendicular component is $4.8$\% lower. The WGM technique offers greater precision, with accuracy limited primarily by the uncertainty in the crystal's dimensions. WGMs also serve as sensitive probes of lattice dynamics, enabling monitoring of temperature-dependent loss mechanisms. At room temperature, the measured loss tangents were $\tan\delta_{||}^{295,\mathrm{K}} = (4.1 \pm 1.4) \times 10^{-5}$ and $\tan\delta_{\perp}^{295,\mathrm{K}} = (3.64 \pm 0.92) \times 10^{-5}$. Upon cooling to 4 K, the loss tangents improved by approximately two orders of magnitude, reaching $\tan\delta_{||}^{4,\mathrm{K}} = (1.56 \pm 0.52) \times 10^{-7}$ and $\tan\delta_{\perp}^{4,\mathrm{K}} = (2.05 \pm 0.79) \times 10^{-7}$. These cryogenic values are higher than those reported in prior studies, likely due to a magnetic loss channel associated with an unidentified paramagnetic spin ensemble. These findings have implications for the use of CaWO$_4$ in applications such as spin-based quantum systems and cryogenic bolometry, highlighting the potential of WGMs for novel sensing applications.

Title: White LED-based photocatalytic treatment using recoverable cobalt ferrite nanoparticles
Authors: Naresh Prajapati, Manoj Kumar, Vidit Pandey, Sandeep Munjal, Himanshu Pandey
Abstract: Contamination of freshwater sources has been alarming due to the widespread use of toxic chemicals in various industries. Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) such as photocatalysis are widely explored to tackle such problems. In photocatalysis, highly oxidative species such as hydroxyl radicals (*OH) are produced with the help of some semiconductor photocatalysts and light. A photocatalyst decomposes these toxic organic compounds in the presence of light. Spinel ferrite (MFe2O4, M = Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, etc.) materials are an important candidate as a photocatalyst due to their semiconducting behaviour and narrow optical bandgap. In this work, we have synthesized cobalt ferrite (CoFe2O4) nanoparticles using the sol-gel method and subsequently annealed at 500°C. The nanoparticles are characterized using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, Raman, and Infrared spectroscopy for structural analysis. The band gap of the material is evaluated using UV-visible spectroscopy. The photocatalytic activity of the material is investigated using methyl orange and methylene blue aqueous solutions as a model dye and a low-power white LED as a light source. The material could decompose 95 % of the dye after 150 minutes of irradiation. Adding hydrogen peroxide further improves the decomposition rate, with over 90 % decomposition achieved within 90 minutes.

Title: Electrochemically-driven formation of Intermetallic Cu3ZnLi2 alters Li-transport in nanostructured bimetallic battery anode

Abstract: The role of Li-based batteries in the electrification of society cannot be understated, however their operational lifetime is often limited by the formation of dendrites, i.e. the localised deposition of Li that can cause shorts between the two electrodes leading to the failure of the battery. Nanocrystalline bimetallic current collectors can be used for anode-free Li-metal batteries, with improved Li plating and limited or suppressed formation of dendrites. Here, we demonstrate that the microstructure of an alpha-Brass current collector, Cu 63% Zn 37%, used in an anode-free Li-metal battery evolves during cycling. It initially had a nanocrystalline deformation layer approximately 80 nm in thickness after polishing. After 100 cycles, the initial deformed brass layer was partially converted to a ternary Laves phase Cu3ZnLi2 within a nanocrystalline brass matrix that grew to 200 - 250 nm in thickness. Upon Li stripping, the phase partially decomposes electrochemically, but what remains can sequester Li thus forming "dead Li" thereby contributing to capacity loss. We propose a mechanism for the microstructural evolution including dynamic recrystallization and phase formation. Since this ternary Laves phase emerges during electrochemical cycling alone, binary alloy current collectors must be assessed for metastable ternary phase formation under different cycling conditions to either stabilize and exploit such phases or electrochemically fully strip them.

Title: Multiferroicity and 180$^\circ$ domain switching in LaFeO$_3$ via Antisite Defects
Authors: Souren Majani, Ulrich Aschauer
Abstract: Materials with coexisting and coupled ferroelectric and magnetic orders are rare. Here we show, using density functional theory calculations, that inducing Fe$_\mathrm{La}$ antisites into non-ferroelectric and antiferromagnetic LaFeO$_3$ renders the material at the same time ferroelectric and ferrimagnetic. Even more excitingly, we observe a direct coupling between the ferroelectric and ferrimagnetic polarization, the latter being switchable by the former. While on average the magnetic moments of antisites would cancel, we envision that preparing defective LaFeO$_3$ under simultaneous electric and magnetic fields will lead to a net magnetic moment due to magnetic domain reconfiguration. Moreover, ferroelectric switching under a static magnetic field can lead to 180$^\circ$ switching of the antiferromagnetic order in LaFeO$_3$.

Title: Detecting the Largest Correlations using the Correlation Density Matrix: a Quantum Monte Carlo Approach
Authors: Aditya Chincholi, Sylvain Capponi, Fabien Alet
Abstract: We present a quantum Monte Carlo-based approach to detect and compute the most dominant correlations for many-body systems without prior knowledge. It is based on the measurement and analysis of the correlation density matrix between two (small) subsystems embedded in the full (large) sample. In order to benchmark this procedure, we investigate zero-temperature quantum phase transitions in one- and two-dimensional quantum Ising model as well as the two-dimensional bilayer Heisenberg antiferromagnet. The method paves the way for a systematic identification of unknown or exotic order parameters in unexplored phases on large systems accessible to quantum Monte Carlo methods.

Title: Orbital-selective charge transfer drives two-step negative thermal expansion structural transitions in PbTa2Se4
Authors: Peng Li, Xiaohui Yang, Wenhua Song, Zhefeng Lou, Tongrui Li, Zhengtai Liu, Zhu'an Xu, Zhuoyu Chen, Xiao Lin, Yang Liu
Abstract: The negative thermal expansion (NTE) effect has been found generally combined with structural phase transitions. However, the charge and orbital freedoms of the NTE has not been well studied. This study employs angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and first-principles calculations to elucidate the charge and orbital kinetics of the anomalous two-step negative thermal expansion structural phase transitions in PbTa2Se4. As the temperature decreases, each transition undergoes a similar block-layer sliding, although the charge transfer behaviors differ significantly. During the first transition, charge is mainly transferred from the Pb 6pz orbital to an M-shaped band below the Fermi level, barely altering the Fermi surface. In contrast, the second transition involves modifications to both the Fermi surface and charge-transfer orbitals, with charge selectively transferred from Pb 6px/py orbitals to Ta 5dz2 orbitals and a decrease of the Fermi pockets formed by Pb 6px/py orbitals. Furthermore, a small pressure can easily tune the base structure phase among the three phases and the corresponding superconductivity. Therefore, our findings reveal that the orbital-selective charge transfer drives the unusual structure transition in PbTa2Se4, offering new insights into the NTE mechanisms and providing a unique window to study the pressure-tuned superconductivity in this metal-intercalated transition chalcogenides.

Title: Interaction-Driven Altermagnetic Magnon Chiral Splitting
Authors: Zhejunyu Jin, Zhaozhuo Zeng, Jie Liu, Tianci Gong, Ying Su, Kai Chang, Peng Yan
Abstract: Nonrelativistic magnon chiral splitting in altermagnets has garnered significant recent attention. In this work, we demonstrate that nonlinear three-wave mixing -- where magnons split or coalesce -- extends this phenomenon into unprecedented relativistic regimes. Employing a bilayer antiferromagnet with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, we identify three distinct classes of chiral splitting, each dictated by specific symmetries, such as $C_4T$, $\sigma_v T$, or their combination. This reveals a novel bosonic mechanism for symmetry-protected chiral splitting, capitalizing on the unique ability of magnons to violate particle-number conservation, a feature absent in low-energy fermionic systems. Our findings pave the way for engineering altermagnetic splitting, with potential applications in advanced magnonic devices and deeper insights into magnon dynamics in complex magnetic systems.

Title: Ultralow thermal conductivity via weak interactions in PbSe/PbTe monolayer heterostructure for thermoelectric design
Authors: Ruihao Tan, Kaiwang Zhang, Yue-Wen Fang
Abstract: In this study, we systematically investigate the thermal and electronic transport properties of two-dimensional PbSe/PbTe monolayer heterostructure by combining first-principles calculations, Boltzmann transport theory, and machine learning methods. The heterostructure exhibits a unique honeycomb-like corrugated and asymmetric configuration, which significantly enhances phonon scattering. Moreover, the relatively weak interatomic interactions in PbSe/PbTe lead to the formation of anti-bonding states, resulting in strong anharmonicity and ultimately yielding ultralow lattice thermal conductivity (${\kappa_{\rm L}}$). In the four-phonon scattering model, the ${\kappa_{\rm L}}$~values along the $x$ and $y$ directions are as low as 0.37 and 0.31 W/mK, respectively. Contrary to the conventional view that long mean free path acoustic phonons dominate heat transport, we find that optical phonons contribute approximately 59\% of the lattice thermal conductivity in this heterostructure. These optical phonons exhibit large Grüneisen parameters, strong anharmonic scattering, and relatively high group velocities, thereby playing a crucial role in the low ${\kappa_{\rm L}}$ regime. Further analysis of thermoelectric performance shows that at a high temperature of 800 K, the heterostructure achieves an exceptional dimensionless figure of merit ($ZT$) of 5.3 along the $y$ direction, indicating outstanding thermoelectric conversion efficiency. These findings not only provide theoretical insights into the transport mechanisms of PbSe/PbTe monolayer heterostructure but also offer a practical design strategy for developing high-performance two-dimensional layered thermoelectric materials.

Title: Unified machine-learning framework for property prediction and time-evolution simulation of strained alloy microstructure
Authors: Andrea Fantasia, Daniele Lanzoni, Niccolò Di Eugenio, Angelo Monteleone, Roberto Bergamaschini, Francesco Montalenti
Abstract: We introduce a unified machine-learning framework designed to conveniently tackle the temporal evolution of alloy microstructures under the influence of an elastic field. This approach allows for the simultaneous extraction of elastic parameters from a short trajectory and for the prediction of further microstructure evolution under their influence. This is demonstrated by focusing on spinodal decomposition in the presence of a lattice mismatch eta, and by carrying out an extensive comparison between the ground-truth evolution supplied by phase field simulations and the predictions of suitable convolutional recurrent neural network architectures. The two tasks may then be performed subsequently into a cascade framework. Under a wide spectrum of misfit conditions, the here-presented cascade model accurately predicts eta and the full corresponding microstructure evolution, also when approaching critical conditions for spinodal decomposition. Scalability to larger computational domain sizes and mild extrapolation errors in time (for time sequences five times longer than the sampled ones during training) are demonstrated. The proposed framework is general and can be applied beyond the specific, prototypical system considered here as an example. Intriguingly, experimental videos could be used to infer unknown external parameters, prior to simulating further temporal evolution.

Title: Learning Kinetic Monte Carlo stochastic dynamics with Deep Generative Adversarial Networks
Authors: Daniele Lanzoni, Olivier Pierre-Louis, Roberto Bergamaschini, Francesco Montalenti
Abstract: We show that Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) may be fruitfully exploited to learn stochastic dynamics, surrogating traditional models while capturing thermal fluctuations. Specifically, we showcase the application to a two-dimensional, many-particle system, focusing on surface-step fluctuations and on the related time-dependent roughness. After the construction of a dataset based on Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, a conditional GAN is trained to propagate stochastically the state of the system in time, allowing the generation of new sequences with a reduced computational cost. Modifications with respect to standard GANs, which facilitate convergence and increase accuracy, are discussed. The trained network is demonstrated to quantitatively reproduce equilibrium and kinetic properties, including scaling laws, with deviations of a few percent from the exact value. Extrapolation limits and future perspectives are critically discussed.

Title: Field Theory of Borromean Super-counterfluids
Authors: Anatoly Kuklov, Leo Radzihovsky, Boris Svistunov
Abstract: We introduce a class of dynamical field theories for $N$-component "Borromean" ($N\geq 3$) super-counterfluid order, naturally formulated in terms of inter-species bosonic fields $\psi_{\alpha\beta}$. Their condensation breaks the normal-state [U(1)]$^N$ symmetry down to its diagonal U(1) subgroup, thereby encoding the arrest of the net superflow. This approach broadens our understanding of dynamical properties of super-counterfluids, at low energies capturing its universal properties, phase transition, counterflow vortices, and many of its other properties. Such super-counterfluid strikingly exhibits $N$ distinct flavors of energetically stable elementary vortex solutions, despite $\mathbb{Z}^{N-1}$ homotopy group of its $N\! -\! 1$ independent Goldstone modes, with $N\! -\! 1$ topologically distinct elementary vortex types, obeying modular arithmetic. The model leads to Borromean hydrodynamics as a low-energy theory, reveals counteflow AC Josephson effect, and generically predicts a first-order character of the phase transitions into Borromean super-counterfluid state in dimensions greater than two.

Title: Static and Dynamical Characterization of Ground State Phases Induced by Frustration and Magnetic Field in the Spin-1 Orthogonal Dimer Chain
Authors: Ernest Ong, Dhiman Bhowmick, Sharoz Schezwen, Pinaki Sengupta
Abstract: The spin-$1$ orthogonal dimer chain is investigated using the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm. A transformation to a basis that uses the local eigenstates of the orthogonal dimers, while retaining the local spin states for the parallel spins, allows for more effective implementation of the symmetries, as well as mitigating the entanglement bias of DMRG. A rich ground state phase diagram is obtained in the parameter space spanned by the ratio of inter- to intra-dimer interaction (which measures the degree of frustration) and an external magnetic field. Some ground state phases exhibit effective Haldane chain character, whereas others exhibit fragmentation of the ground state wavefunction, or clustering. The phases are characterized by their static properties, including (local) spin quantum number, entanglement entropy, and the spin-spin correlation function. Detailed characterization of a carefully selected set of representative states is presented. The static properties are complemented by exploring the low-energy dynamics through the calculation of the dynamic structure factor. The results provide crucial insight into the emergence of complex ground state phases from the interplay between strong interactions, geometric frustration, and external magnetic field for interacting S=1 Heisenberg spins.

Title: Investigating CO Adsorption on Cu(111) and Rh(111) Surfaces Using Machine Learning Exchange-Correlation Functionals
Authors: Xinyuan Liang, Renxi Liu, Mohan Chen
Abstract: The "CO adsorption puzzle", a persistent failure of utilizing generalized gradient approximations (GGA) in density functional theory to replicate CO's experimental preference for top-site adsorption on transition-metal surfaces, remains a critical barrier in surface chemistry. While hybrid functionals such as HSE06 partially resolve this discrepancy, their prohibitive computational cost limits broader applications. We tackle this issue by adopting the Deep Kohn-Sham (DeePKS) method to train machine-learned exchange-correlation functionals. Principal component analysis reveals that the input descriptors for electronic structures separate distinctly across different chemical environments, enabling the DeePKS models to generalize to multi-element systems. We train system-specific DeePKS models for transition-metal surfaces Cu(111) and Rh(111). These models successfully recover experimental site preferences, yielding adsorption energy differences of about 10 meV compared to HSE06. Furthermore, a single model for the two surfaces is trained, and the model achieves comparable accuracy in predicting not only adsorption energies and site preference but also potential energy surfaces and relaxed surface adsorption structures. The above work demonstrates a promising path towards universal models, enabling catalyst exploration with hybrid functional accuracy at substantially reduced cost.

Title: Strong correlation behavior and Strong coupling superconductivity in (Ti1/4Hf1/4Nb1/4Ta1/4)1-xNix with the rich magnetic element Ni
Authors: Zijun Huang, Tong Li, Longfu Li, Rui Chen, Zaichen Xiang, Shuangyue Wang, Jingjun Qin, Yucheng Li, Lingyong Zeng, Dinghua Bao, Huixia Luo
Abstract: Searching for new superconductors, especially unconventional superconductors, has been studied extensively for decades but remains one of the major outstanding challenges in condensed matter physics. Medium/high-entropy alloys (MEAs-HEAs) are new fertile soils of unconventional superconductors and generate widespread interest and questions on the existence of superconductivity in highly disordered materials. Here, we report on the effect of Ni-doped on the crystal structure and superconductivity properties of strongly coupled TiHfNbTa MEA. XRD results indicate that the maximum solid solution of (Ti1/4Hf1/4Nb1/4Ta1/4)1-xNix is about 7.7%. Resistivity, magnetic susceptibility, and specific heat measurements demonstrated that (Ti1/4Hf1/4Nb1/4Ta1/4)1-xNix HEAs are all bulk type-II superconductors and follow the trend of the increase of Tc with the increase of Ni-doped contents. The specific heat jump of all (Ti1/4Hf1/4Nb1/4Ta1/4)1-xNix are much larger than the BCS value of 1.43, suggesting all these HEAs are strongly coupled superconductors. Additionally, large Kadawaki-Woods ratio values suggest that there is a strong electron correlation effect in this system. The (Ti1/4Hf1/4Nb1/4Ta1/4)1-xNix HEA system is a new ideal material platform for the study of strong correlation behavior and strongly coupled superconductivity, which provides an insight into the physics of high-temperature superconductors or other unconventional superconductors.

Title: Heating Dynamics of Correlated Fermions under Dephasing
Authors: Antonio Picano, Matthieu Vanhoecke, Marco Schirò
Abstract: We study the dissipative dynamics of correlated fermions evolving in presence of a local dephasing bath. To this extent we consider the infinite coordination limit of the corresponding Lindblad master equation, provided by Dynamical Mean-Field Theory for open quantum systems. We solve the resulting quantum impurity problem, describing an Anderson impurity coupled to a local dephasing, using weak-coupling perturbation theory in interaction and dephasing. We show that the dissipative dynamics describes heating towards infinite temperature, with a relaxation rate that depends strongly on interaction. The resulting steady-state spectral functions are however non-trivial and show an interplay between coherent quasiparticle peak and local dephasing. We then discuss how thermalization towards infinite temperature emerges within DMFT, by solving the impurity problem throughout its self-consistency. We show that thermalization under open quantum system dynamics is qualitatively different from the closed system case. In particular, the thermalization front found in the unitary is strongly modified, a signature of the irreversibility of the open system dynamics.

Title: Axially confined binary quantum droplets: ground states and central vortices
Authors: Srivatsa B. Prasad, Thomas P. Billam, Nick G. Parker
Abstract: Ultracold miscible mixtures of bosonic gases have been observed to form quantum droplet states stabilized by beyond-mean-field quantum fluctuations. Here we study the properties of the droplets when subjected to harmonic trapping in one dimension, using a combination of numerical, variational and analytical approaches. We map out the phase diagram between bound droplets and the unbound gas state and the form of the ground states. We additionally consider how the droplet solutions are modified by the presence of a central vortex and use these results to estimate the critical rotation frequency for vortices to be energetically favored. Our work helps to understand the physics of self-bound droplets and vortex droplets in flattened geometries.

Title: Orthorhombic nitride perovskite CeTaN3-δ with switchable and robust ferroelectric polarization

Abstract: Perovskite-type ternary nitrides with predicted exciting ferroelectricity and many other outstanding properties hold great promise to be an emerging class of advanced ferroelectrics for manufacturing diverse technologically important devices. However, such nitride ferroelectrics have not yet been experimentally identified, mainly due to the challenging sample synthesis by traditional methods at ambient pressure. Here we report the successful high-pressure synthesis of a high-quality ferroelectric nitride perovskite of CeTaN3-{\delta} with nitrogen deficiency, adopting an orthorhombic Pmn21 polar structure. This material is electrically insulating and exhibits switchable and robust electric polarization for producing ferroelectricity. Furthermore, a number of other extraordinary properties are also revealed in this nitride such as excellent mechanical properties and chemical inertness, which would make it practically useful for many device-relevant applications and fundamentally important for the study of condensed-matter physics.

Title: Direct signatures of $d$-level hybridization and dimerization in magnetic adatom chains on a superconductor
Authors: Lisa M. Rütten, Eva Liebhaber, Gael Reecht, Kai Rossnagel, Katharina J. Franke
Abstract: Magnetic adatom chains on superconductors provide a platform to explore correlated spin states and emergent quantum phases. Using low-temperature scanning tunneling spectroscopy, we study the distance-dependent interaction between Fe atoms on 2H-NbSe$_2$. While single atoms exhibit four Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states and partially occupied $d$ levels consistent with a $S=2$ spin state, the spin is quenched when two Fe atoms reside in nearest neighbor lattice sites, where the $d$ levels of the atoms hybridize. The non-magnetic dimer configuration is stable in that dimerization persists in chains with weak interactions among the dimers. Thus, the spin-state quenching has important implications also for Fe chains. While even-numbered chains are stable and non-magnetic, odd-numbered chains host a single magnetic atom at one of the chain's ends, with its position being switchable by voltage pulses. Our findings emphasize the role of interatomic coupling in shaping quantum ground states and suggest that engineering alternating hopping amplitudes analogous to the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model may offer a pathway to realizing topological systems.

Title: Saturating interaction in coherently coupled two-component Bose-Einstein condensates
Authors: R Eid (LCF), S Tiengo (LCF), M Lévy (LCF), T Bourdel (LCF)
Abstract: Rabi-coupled spinor Bose-Einstein condensates, with competing intra-and interspecies interactions, enable independent control of two-and three-body interactions. We show that coupling can also drive the system into a strongly nonlinear regime of saturating interaction. More precisely, the equation of state interpolates between low-and high-density regimes described by two different two-body scattering lengths. Interestingly, the transition can be determined by the strength of the coupling. We experimentally demonstrate this saturation phenomenon by measurements of the interaction energy of a Bose-Einstein condensate as a function of the detuning and of the strength of the Rabi coupling in spin mixtures of potassium 39.

Abstract: Mercury chalcogenides are a class of materials that exhibit diverse structural phases under pressure, leading to a range of exotic physical properties, including topological phases and chiral phonons. In particular, the phase diagram of mercury sulfide (HgS) remains difficult to characterize, with significant uncertainty surrounding the transition pressure between phases. Based on recent experimental results, we employ Density Functional Theory and Superconducting Density Functional Theory to investigate the pressure-induced structural phase transition in HgS and its interplay with the emergence of superconductivity as the crystal transitions from the cinnabar phase (space group P3$_1$21) to the rock salt phase (space group Fm$\bar{3}$m). Remarkably, the rocksalt phase hosts a multigap superconducting state driven by distinct Fermi surface sheets, with two dominant gaps; the unusually high critical temperature of $\sim$11 K emerges naturally within this multiband scenario, highlighting the role of interband coupling beyond isotropic models. These results place HgS among the few systems where multiband superconducting gap structures emerge under pressure.

Title: Superconducting Diode Effect in Weak Localization Regime
Authors: Naratip Nunchot, Youichi Yanase
Abstract: We study a dirty two-dimensional superconductor with Rashba spin-orbit coupling and in-plane Zeeman fields described by the nonlinear sigma model that includes short-range electron-electron interactions from the Coulomb and Cooper channels. The renormalized Ginzburg-Landau theory, which includes the weak localization effects at the one-loop level, is constructed by using the Keldysh functional formalism. It is shown that the tricritical point appears in the phase diagram. The superconducting diode quality factor increases divergently as the system approaches the tricritical point. Near the superconducting phase transition lines, the absolute value of the diode quality factor decreases due to the cooperation of localization and interactions. The normal conductivity of the resistive state, in which the superconducting state is destroyed by the critical current, is calculated, and localization behaviors are demonstrated.

Title: Reducing Data Requirements for Sequence-Property Prediction in Copolymer Compatibilizers via Deep Neural Network Tuning
Authors: Md Mushfiqul Islam, Nishat N. Labiba, Lawrence O. Hall, David S. Simmons
Abstract: Synthetic sequence-controlled polymers promise to transform polymer science by combining the chemical versatility of synthetic polymers with the precise sequence-mediated functionality of biological proteins. However, design of these materials has proven extraordinarily challenging, because they lack the massive datasets of closely related evolved molecules that accelerate design of proteins. Here we report on a new Artifical Intelligence strategy to dramatically reduce the amount of data necessary to accelerate these materials' design. We focus on data connecting the repeat-unit-sequence of a \emph{compatibilizer} molecule to its ability to reduce the interfacial tension between distinct polymer domains. The optimal sequence of these molecules, which are essential for applications such as mixed-waste polymer recycling, depends strongly on variables such as concentration and chemical details of the polymer. With current methods, this would demand an entirely distinct dataset to enable design at each condition. Here we show that a deep neural network trained on low-fidelity data for sequence/interfacial tension relations at one set of conditions can be rapidly tuned to make higher-fidelity predictions at a distinct set of conditions, requiring far less data that would ordinarily be needed. This priming-and-tuning approach should allow a single low-fidelity parent dataset to dramatically accelerate prediction and design in an entire constellation of related systems. In the long run, it may also provide an approach to bootstrapping quantitative atomistic design with AI insights from fast, coarse simulations.

Title: Laser-Synthesized Amorphous PdSe$_{\mathrm{2-x}}$ Nanoparticles: A Defect-Rich Platform for High-Efficiency SERS, Photocatalysis, and Photothermal Conversion

Popov, Alexander Chernov, Alexey D. Bolshakov, Sergey Novikov, Andrey A. Vyshnevyy, Aleksey Arsenin, Andrei V. Kabashin, Gleb I. Tselikov, Valentyn Volkov
Abstract: The control of material properties at the atomic scale remains a central challenge in materials science. Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) offer remarkable electronic and optical properties, but their functionality is largely dictated by their stable crystalline phases. Here we demonstrate a single-step, ligand-free strategy using femtosecond laser ablation in liquid to transform crystalline, stoichiometric palladium diselenide (PdSe$_{\mathrm{2}}$) into highly stable, amorphous, and non-stoichiometric nanoparticles (PdSe$_{\mathrm{2-x}}$, with x$\approx$1). This laser-driven amorphization creates a high density of selenium vacancies and coordinatively unsaturated sites, which unlock a range of emergent functions absent in the crystalline precursor, including plasmon-free surface-enhanced Raman scattering with an enhancement factor exceeding 10$^\mathrm{6}$, a 50-fold increase in photocatalytic activity, and near-infrared photothermal conversion efficiency reaching 83$\%$. Our findings establish laser-induced amorphization as a powerful top-down approach for defect-engineered TMDCs and advances their practical usage in optics, catalysis, and nanomedicine.

Title: Free-fermion approach to the partition function zeros : Special boundary conditions and product form of solution
Authors: De-Zhang Li, Xin Wang
Abstract: Partition function zeros are powerful tools in understanding critical behavior. In this paper we present new results of the Fisher zeros of two-dimensional Ising models, in the framework of free-fermion eight-vertex model. First we succeed in finding special boundary conditions for the free-fermion model, under which the partition function of a finite lattice can be expressed in a double product form. Using appropriate mappings, these boundary conditions are transformed into the corresponding versions of the square, triangular and honeycomb lattice Ising models. Each Ising model is studied in the cases of a zero field and of an imaginary field $i(\pi/2)k_BT$. For the square lattice model we rediscover the famous Brascamp-Kunz (B-K) boundary conditions. For the triangular and honeycomb lattice models we obtain the B-K type boundary conditions, and the Fisher zeros are conveniently solved from the product form of partition function. The advantage of B-K type boundary conditions is that the Fisher zeros of any finite lattice exactly lie on certain loci, and the accumulation points of zeros can be easily determined in the thermodynamic limit. Our finding and method would be very helpful in studying the partition function zeros of vertex and Ising models.

Title: Condensate-mediated dimerization of impurities in atomic BECs
Authors: Hoshu Hiyane, Thomás Fogarty, Jose Carlos Pelayo, Thomas Busch
Abstract: We show that strongly correlated impurities confined in an optical lattice can form localized, molecule-like dimer states in the presence of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). By systematically studying the effect of the lattice potential on this mixture, we reveal the two roles of the condensate in assisting the formation of dimerized impurities: mediating the attractive interaction among impurities and rescaling the lattice potential of impurities. At strong coupling between the impurities and the condensate, the two mechanisms cooperate to induce a structural transition, resulting in the rearrangement of dimers. We also show that the nonequilibrium dynamics of these states can be interpreted as a dimerized soliton train.

Title: Consistent quantum treatments of non-convex kinetic energies
Authors: C. Koliofoti, M. A. Javed, R.-P. Riwar
Abstract: The task of finding a consistent relationship between a quantum Hamiltonian and a classical Lagrangian is of utmost importance for basic, but ubiquitous techniques like canonical quantization and path integrals. Nonconvex kinetic energies (which appear, e.g., in Wilczek and Shapere's classical time crystal, or nonlinear capacitors) pose a fundamental problem: the Legendre transformation is ill-defined, and the more general Legendre-Fenchel transformation removes nonconvexity essentially by definition. Arguing that such anomalous theories follow from suitable low-energy approximations of well-defined, harmonic theories, we show that seemingly inconsistent Hamiltonian and Lagrangian descriptions can both be valid, depending on the coupling strength to a dissipative environment. Essentially there occurs a dissipative phase transition from a non-convex Hamiltonian to a convex Lagrangian regime, involving exceptional points in imaginary time. This resolves apparent inconsistencies and provide computationally efficient methods to treat anomalous, nonconvex kinetic energies.

Title: Proximity screening greatly enhances electronic quality of graphene

Gorbachev, Na Xin, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Lee Hague, Vladimir I. Fal'ko, Irina V. Grigorieva, Leonid A. Ponomarenko, Alexey I. Berdyugin, Andre K. Geim
Abstract: The electronic quality of two-dimensional systems is crucial when exploring quantum transport phenomena. In semiconductor heterostructures, decades of optimization have yielded record-quality two-dimensional gases with transport and quantum mobilities reaching close to 10$^8$ and 10$^6$ cm$^2$/Vs, respectively. Although the quality of graphene devices has also been improving, it remains comparatively lower. Here we report a transformative improvement in the electronic quality of graphene by employing graphite gates placed in its immediate proximity, at 1 nm separation. The resulting screening reduces charge inhomogeneity by two orders of magnitude, bringing it down to a few 10$^7$ cm$^-2$ and limiting potential fluctuations to less than 1 meV. Quantum mobilities reach 10$^7$ cm$^2$/Vs, surpassing those in the highest-quality semiconductor heterostructures by an order of magnitude, and the transport mobilities match their record. This quality enables Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations in fields as low as 1 mT and quantum Hall plateaus below 5 mT. Although proximity screening predictably suppresses electron-electron interactions, fractional quantum Hall states remain observable with their energy gaps reduced only by a factor of 3-5 compared to unscreened devices, demonstrating that many-body phenomena at spatial scales shorter than 10 nm remain robust. Our results offer a reliable route to improving electronic quality in graphene and other two-dimensional systems, which should facilitate the exploration of new physics previously obscured by disorder.

Title: Magnetization switching by current in an elemental ferromagnetic single layer
Authors: Yanyan Yang, Weiwei Lin
Abstract: Current-induced magnetization switching, a fundamental phenomenon related to spin-transport of electrons, enables non-voltaic and fast information write, facilitating applications in low-power memory and logic devices. However, magnetization switching by spin-orbit torques is usually attributed to current flowing in the nonmagnetic metal layer of multilayers or in magnetic alloys with heavy elements. Here, we report perpendicular magnetization switching induced by current flowing in an elemental ferromagnet nickel single layer. This prototype structure demonstrates that current-induced magnetization switching is a general phenomenon of magnet. The results suggest that the current induces an effective transverse magnetic field with an out-of-plane component leading to the magnetization switching, different to the conventional spin-orbit torques. Our work opens the new insight and reveals the intrinsic mechanism of current-induced torques.

Title: Effect of applied pressure on the non-relativistic spin-splitting (NRSS) of FeSb2 altermagnet: A first-principles study
Authors: Shalika R. Bhandari, R. Tamang, Keshav Shrestha, Samy Brahimi, Samir Lounis, D. P. Rai
Abstract: We have investigated the pressure-dependent electronic structure, phonon stability, and anomalous Hall response of the recently discovered altermagnet FeSb2 from density functional theory (DFT) and Wannier function analysis. From density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) calculations, we have found that FeSb2 remains dynamically stable up to 10 GPa, evidenced by positive phonon frequencies. Our spin-polarised band structure shows that the node of band crossing between spin-up and spin-down bands around the Fermi energy exactly lies at the Gamma and A-symmetry points. The Fermi crossing is mostly exhibited by band-24, band-25 and band-26. The non-relativistic spin-splitting (NRSS) along M'-Gamma-M and A-Z-A' symmetry is attributed to the broken time-reversal (PT ) symmetry. There are significant changes in the band profile under applied pressure, as one can see the shifting of the node of band-24 and band-26 towards the lower energy side. The NRSS exhibited by band-24 along M'-Gamma-M symmetry is notably small. Although the strength of NRSS of band-26 along A-Z-A' symmetry is significant but reduces under applied pressure. The anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) values are prominent in -1 to 1 eV range. A sharp peaked and positive AHC values at ambient pressure, becomes spectrally broadened and negative at 10 GPa due to pressure-induced band crossings and redistribution of Berry curvature near the Fermi level. We have observed that the values of spin hall conductivity (SHC) are around 2-2.5 times lower as compared to AHC and prominent in between -1.0 eV to 1.0 eV. Our results establish FeSb2 as a tunable altermagnetic candidate where pressure can modulate both topological transport and dynamic stability, offering opportunities for strain-engineered Hall responses in compensated magnetic systems.

Title: A Hierarchy of Topological and Superconducting States in Rhombohedral Hexalayer Graphene
Authors: Ron Q. Nguyen, Hai-Tian Wu, Erin Morissette, Naiyuan J. Zhang, Peiyu Qin, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Aaron W. Hui, Dima E. Feldman, J. I. A. Li
Abstract: Superconductivity and the quantum Hall effect are conventionally viewed as mutually exclusive: the former is suppressed by magnetic fields, while the latter relies on them. Here, we report the surprising coexistence of these two phenomena in rhombohedral hexalayer graphene. In this system, a superconducting phase is not destroyed -- but instead stabilized -- by an out-of-plane magnetic field. Strikingly, this superconducting state coexists and competes with a sequence of quantum Hall states that appear at both integer and half-integer Landau level fillings. Both the superconducting and quantum Hall states exhibit sharply defined thermal transitions or crossovers, with nearly identical onset temperatures -- pointing to a shared underlying mechanism. Taken together, our observations uncover an unprecedented interplay between superconducting and topological phases, challenging conventional paradigms and opening a new frontier in condensed matter physics.

Title: Spin-resolved ballistic transport in three-terminal Zigzag Graphene Nanoribbon Device
Authors: Niharika Tamuli, Saumen Acharjee
Abstract: We investigate the spin-polarized ballistic transport in a three-terminal Zigzag graphene nanoribbon (ZGNR) device using a tight binding model, non-equilibrium Green function formalism within the Landauer-Büttiker framework. We study the transmission spectrum, density of states, I-V characteristics, spin-resolved conductance and spin current by varying ribbon geometries and an out-of-plane Zeeman field. In absence of magnetization, transport is dominated by subband quantization and resonant edge states, with pronounced dependence on ribbon width and length while the introduction of a Zeeman field offers spin-selective transport and inducing half-metallic behavior, particularly in narrower ribbons, highlighting the interplay between quantum confinement, edge-localized states and spin-dependent interactions. Moreover, we found Fabry-Pérot-like interference in conductance spectrum and bias-driven mode activation with strong spin filtering effects. The spin current is found to be tunable via magnetic field and gate voltage. Also, it remains stable under thermal fluctuations, demonstrating suitability for room-temperature operation. Finally, the energy and width dependence of the Fano factor reveals distinct quantum interference features and spin-polarized transport signatures. These findings indicate the potential of the three-terminal ZGNR based device for scalable and gate-controllable spintronic applications.

Title: Multiscale complexity of two-dimensional Ising systems with short-range, ferromagnetic interactions
Authors: Ibrahim Al-Azki, Valentina Baccetti
Abstract: Complex systems exhibit macroscopic behaviors that emerge from the coordinated interactions of their individual components. Understanding the microscopic origins of these emergent properties remains challenging, particularly in systems beyond canonical examples, due to the absence of a generalized framework for identifying the governing degrees of freedom. The multiscale complexity formalism aims to address this challenge by employing information-theoretic indices of structure to identify the scales at which collective behaviors emerge. In this paper, we evaluate the complexity profile index as a tool for identifying such scales by applying it to two-dimensional ferromagnetic Ising systems. We demonstrate that these systems exhibit multiscale behavior in the critical region, and the emergence of macroscopic magnetization in the ordered phase corresponds to a non-monotonic behavior of the complexity profile at large scales. Additionally, we show that the pairwise complexity exhibits a maximum in the disordered phase that remains bounded in the thermodynamic limit.

Title: Fundamental Limits of Dissociative Electrochemical Ammonia Synthesis via Electrodeposited Metals
Authors: Victor Azumah, Venkatasubramanian Viswanathan
Abstract: Electrochemical ammonia synthesis via lithium-mediated nitrogen dissociation has demonstrated exceptional Faradaic efficiency at ambient conditions, but its viability is limited by a high energy cost of ~9.12 eV per NH3 via lithium electrodeposition. Here, we establish the thermodynamic limits for dissociative nitrogen reduction using elemental metals by decomposing the process into three steps: metal deposition, nitridation, and protonation. We derive energetic constraints that any viable mediator must satisfy and show that highly reducing metals impose significant energetic penalties. To reduce this cost, we explore solvent tuning and bimetallic alloy strategies that shift deposition potentials without compromising nitridation spontaneity. Our results offer design principles for lowering the energy input of dissociative nitrogen reduction while maintaining its selectivity advantage over associative routes.

Title: Evaluating Isoreticular Series of CALF-20 for Biogas Upgrading using a Pressure/Vacuum Swing Adsorption (PVSA) Process
Authors: Changdon Shin, Sunghyun Yoon, Yongchul G. Chung
Abstract: Cyclic swing adsorption processes, such as pressure vacuum swing adsorption (PVSA), have emerged as a promising technology for upgrading biogas by separating carbon dioxide (CO2) from methane (CH4). The rational design of adsorbent materials with tailored properties is important for deployment of high-performance PVSA technology. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), particularly the CALF-20 isoreticular series, have attracted interest due to their high CO2 selectivity, thermal and water stability. In this study, we report a multiscale assessment of CALF-20 and its isoreticular five derivatives by integrating molecular simulations and PVSA cycle optimization. Structural parameters such as pore volume, pore size, and isosteric adsorption enthalpy were first calculated, followed by atomistic grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations. Process-level performances of the six materials were evaluated and optimized using the Thompson Sampling Efficient Multi-objective Optimization (TSEMO) algorithm. From the process-level optimization, we found that FumCALF-20 is the only material that can reach CH4 purity > 0.90 while maintaining high recovery. Other materials either lacked sufficient CO2 capacity or showed inefficient CH4 desorption at low pressures. This study underscores the value of process-level optimization in MOF evaluation and screening for energy-efficient biogas upgrading.

Title: Polyurethane-Inspired CO2 Chemisorbent: Ab Initio Reaction Profiles
Authors: Vitaly V. Chaban
Abstract: Polyurethane (PU) and its numerous fine-tuned derivatives are widely employed as CO2 scavengers thanks to (1) physisorption and (2) functionalization of the PU backbone with other CO2 sorbents. In the present work, it has been unraveled why PU cannot exhibit CO2 chemisorption, despite possessing the nitrogen docking sites and exhibiting strong electrostatic sorbent-sorbate interactions. Furthermore, a few types of spatial separation of the active sorption sites have been proposed to unleash the chemisorption functionality of PU. By comparing various structural modifications of PU by using the in-silico methodology, we have identified that CO2 chemisorption by PU takes place in the case of implementing methyl and ethyl fragments between the oxygen and nitrogen atoms of PU. Herewith, the introduction of the ethyl moiety even makes CO2 chemisorption energetically favorable relative to physisorption. The reported specific progress on materials design represents an obvious practical value for chemical engineers developing inexpensive CO2 scavengers.

Title: Molecular Mechanisms of Polymer Crosslinking via Thermal Activation
Authors: Javed Akhtar, Jogeswar Chhatria, Sooraj Kunnikuruvan, Satyesh K. Yadav, Tarak K. Patra
Abstract: Developing efficient and universal polymer crosslinking strategies is pivotal for advanced material design, especially for challenging matrixes like polyethylene, polypropylene, and polystyrene. Traditional crosslinkers such as divinylbenzene (DVB) often requires high-temperature radical initiators and are limited by poor compatibility with saturated hydrocarbon matrices. In contrast, bis-diazirine (BD) crosslinkers offer a promising alternative by harnessing thermally or photochemically generated carbene intermediates for highly selective C-H bond insertions. Here, we employ density functional theory (DFT)-based electronic structure calculations to elucidate the molecular mechanisms and energetics of BD-mediated crosslinking across PE, PP, and PS. We demonstrate that BD enables efficient covalent linkage through low free energy barriers , facilitating crosslinking at moderate temperatures without catalysts and with minimal sensitivity to polymer chain length. Moreover, BD exhibits selective reactivity towards the tertiary and secondary C-H bonds in PP and PS, respectively. Comparative analysis shows that BD dramatically outperforms DVB, especially in saturated polymers, enabling reaction times that are orders of magnitude faster. Our findings provide atomistic insights into BD crosslinker reactivity and establish a mechanistic foundation for next-generation, universal C-H activation-based crosslinking technologies.

Title: Robust qubit interactions mediated by photonic topological edge states
Authors: Boris Gurevich, Weihua Xie, Mohsen Yarmohammadi, Michael H. Kolodrubetz
Abstract: We investigate the coupling of two spatially separated qubits via topologically protected edge states in a two-dimensional Hofstadter lattice. In this hybrid platform, the qubits are coupled to distinct edge sites of the lattice, enabling long-range interactions mediated by topological edge modes. We solve the full system Hamiltonian and analyze the resulting eigenstate structure to uncover the conditions under which coherent qubit interactions emerge. Our analysis reveals that the effective coupling is highly sensitive to the qubit placement, energy detuning, and the topological character of the edge spectrum. We obtain an analytical solution that goes beyond the perturbative regime, capturing the full interplay between the qubits and edge modes. These results provide a foundation for exploring information transport and many-body effects in engineered quantum systems where interactions are mediated by topological edge modes.

Title: Benchmarking a Tunable Quantum Neural Network on Trapped-Ion and Superconducting Hardware
Authors: Djamil Lakhdar-Hamina, Xingxin Liu, Richard Barney, Sarah H. Miller, Alaina M. Green, Norbert M. Linke, Victor Galitski
Abstract: We implement a quantum generalization of a neural network on trapped-ion and IBM superconducting quantum computers to classify MNIST images, a common benchmark in computer vision. The network feedforward involves qubit rotations whose angles depend on the results of measurements in the previous layer. The network is trained via simulation, but inference is performed experimentally on quantum hardware. The classical-to-quantum correspondence is controlled by an interpolation parameter, $a$, which is zero in the classical limit. Increasing $a$ introduces quantum uncertainty into the measurements, which is shown to improve network performance at moderate values of the interpolation parameter. We then focus on particular images that fail to be classified by a classical neural network but are detected correctly in the quantum network. For such borderline cases, we observe strong deviations from the simulated behavior. We attribute this to physical noise, which causes the output to fluctuate between nearby minima of the classification energy landscape. Such strong sensitivity to physical noise is absent for clear images. We further benchmark physical noise by inserting additional single-qubit and two-qubit gate pairs into the neural network circuits. Our work provides a springboard toward more complex quantum neural networks on current devices: while the approach is rooted in standard classical machine learning, scaling up such networks may prove classically non-simulable and could offer a route to near-term quantum advantage.

Title: Zone-sectored organic crystals with spatially resolved exciton dynamics
Authors: Moha Naeimi, Tim Völzer, Regina Lange, Kevin Oldenburg, Stefan Lochbrunner, Ingo Barke, Sylvia Speller
Abstract: Among the organic semiconductors, rubrene stands out in terms of hole mobility, luminescence yield and exciton migration distance. A novel type of rubrene microcrystal is prepared in the orthorhombic phase, exhibiting zone-sectored tabular domains with distinct photoluminescence (PL) characteristics. These sectors exhibit distinct PL spectra and time-evolution, arising from differences in the in-plane orientation of the orthorhombic unit cell relative to the crystal surface. A combination of polarised optical microscopy, fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM), and atomic force microscopy (AFM) is used to characterise the samples in terms of crystal orientation, fluorescence lifetime, and photoluminescence spectra. Spatially resolved PL spectroscopy reveals that the redshifted 650 nm emission band has polarisation along the transition dipole moment and is associated with high photon absorption due to the alignment of excitation polarisation and transition dipole moment and selectively localized within specific sectors of the crystal. The detected photon originates from direct emission of a geminate coherent triplet pair, or from its fusion. This band exhibits pure mono-exponential dynamics with 3.7 ns lifetime. The triplet fusion behaviour in the succeeding time regimes can be treated in the framework of power law scaling and random walk. The emission kinetics are modelled using rate equations describing geminate and non-geminate exciton fusion processes, enabling a quantitative interpretation of the spatially resolved PL kinetics. These findings introduce a material-based strategy, opening novel routes for photonic applications and light harvesting.

Title: Orthogonalization speed-up from quantum coherence after a sudden quench
Authors: Beatrice Donelli, Gabriele De Chiara, Francesco Scazza, Stefano Gherardini
Abstract: We introduce a nonequilibrium phenomenon reminiscent of Anderson's orthogonality catastrophe (OC) that arises in the transient dynamics following an interaction quench between a quantum system and a localized defect. Even if the system comprises only a single particle, the overlap between the asymptotic and initial superposition states vanishes with a power law scaling with the number of energy eigenstates entering the initial state and with an exponent that depends on the interaction strength. The presence of quantum coherence in the initial state is reflected onto the discrete counterpart of an infinite discontinuity in the system spectral function, a hallmark of Anderson's OC, as well as in the quasiprobability distribution of work due to the quench transformation. The positivity loss of the work distribution is directly linked with a reduction of the minimal time imposed by quantum mechanics for the state to orthogonalize. We propose an experimental test of coherence-enhanced orthogonalization dynamics based on Ramsey interferometry of a trapped cold-atom system.

Title: On the fate of travelling waves at the boundary of quantum droplets
Authors: Angel Paredes, Jose Guerra-Carmenate, Humberto Michinel
Abstract: We analyze quantum droplets formed in a two-dimensional symmetric mixture of Bose-Einstein condensed atoms. For sufficiently large atom numbers, these droplets exhibit a flat-top density profile with sharp boundaries governed by surface tension. Within the bulk of the droplet, traveling matter waves - localized density dips - can propagate at constant velocity while maintaining their shape. Using numerical simulations and qualitative analysis, we investigate the rich phenomenology that arises when such excitations reach the boundary of a finite droplet. We show that they can emit a small outgoing droplet, excite internal modes of the host soliton, or, in the case of vortex-antivortex pairs, split into individual vortices propagating backward near the edge. Furthermore, we demonstrate that traveling waves can be dynamically generated near the boundary through the collision of distinct droplets, and we discuss their trajectories and interactions.

Title: The invariant rate of energy extraction by polymers in turbulence
Authors: Alessandro Chiarini, Rahul K. Singh, Marco E. Rosti
Abstract: Polymeric turbulence, flows of fluids with dilute polymer additives at high Reynolds numbers, exhibits striking deviations from the Kolmogorovean behaviour of Newtonian turbulence. Recent experiments as well as simulations have uncovered a robust self-similar energy spectrum scaling as $k^{-2.3}$, in sharp contrast to the $k^{-5/3}$ scaling of Newtonian flows. The origin of this novel scaling, however, has remained unresolved. In this work, we uncover the underlying physical mechanism responsible for this emergent behaviour. Using fundamental governing equations aided by scaling arguments, we show that the fluid energy cascade is depleted by the polymers at a constant rate across a wide range of scales. This constant depletion rate acts as a second invariant, alongside the total energy flux, thereby setting the scaling properties of the spectrum. Our results reveal that polymeric turbulence is governed by two simultaneous invariants, unlike the single-invariant structure of Newtonian turbulence, and suggest new strategies for turbulence control through suitably engineered and targeted polymer design.

Title: Weak decaying collective-excitation approximation for Yukawa one-component plasmas
Authors: Ilnaz I. Fairushin, Anatolii V. Mokshin
Abstract: In this paper, the theoretical model of weak decaying collective excitations characteristic of many-particle systems with long-range interaction potentials is developed using the example of one-component strongly coupled Yukawa plasmas. The proposed model is based on the self-consistent relaxation theory of collective dynamics and covers spatial scales from extended hydrodynamics to scales related to the mean interparticle distance. The theoretical model reproduces the dynamic structure factor spectra and the corresponding dispersion characteristics in agreement with molecular dynamics simulation data without using any fitting parameters. In the limit of small wave numbers, the correspondence of the proposed theoretical model with the damped harmonic oscillator model is established. The simple analytical expression for the sound attenuation coefficient of strongly coupled Yukawa plasmas is obtained.

Title: Excited State Absorption Drives Low-Energy Optical Limiting in Oligothiophenes
Authors: Mustapha Driouech, Michele Guerrini, Caterina Cocchi
Abstract: Optical limiting (OL), a crucial mechanism for protecting human eyes and sensitive sensors from intense radiation, relies on understanding the optical nonlinearities acting on the systems. Assessing and disentangling the effects at play is crucial to predict and control the nonlinear optical response in real materials. In this ab initio study based on real-time time-dependent density-functional theory, we investigate non-perturbatively the absorption spectra of a set of thiophene oligomers, the building blocks of technologically relevant organic semiconductors, excited by broadband radiation of increasing intensity. Under strong electric fields, the absorption cross section grows significantly below the onset of linear excitations, exhibiting saturation typical of OL. By exciting the oligothiophenes with a train of pulses targeting the first and second excited states of each moiety and analyzing the resulting population dynamics, we reveal excited-state absorption (ESA) in the near-infrared to visible region. Our results indicate ESA as the driving mechanism for OL in oligothiophene molecules, thereby providing important insight to design novel compounds with optimized nonlinear optical characteristics.

Title: On buoyancy in disperse two-phase flow and its impact on well-posedness of two-fluid models
Authors: Rui Zhu, Yulan Chen, Katharina Tholen, Zhiguo He, Thomas Pähtz
Abstract: Maxey \& Riley's (\textit{Phys. Fluids}, vol.~26, 1983, 883) analytical solution for the flow around a small sphere at low particle Reynolds number tells us that the fluid-particle interaction force decomposes into a contribution from the local flow disturbance caused by the particle's boundary -- consisting of the drag, Faxen, virtual-mass, and history forces -- and another contribution from the stress of the background flow, termed generalized-buoyancy force. There is also a consensus that, for general disperse two-phase flow, the interfacial force density, resulting from averaging the fluid's and particles' equations of motion, decomposes in a likewise manner. However, there has been a long-standing controversy about the physical closure separating the generalized-buoyancy from the interfacial force density, especially whether or not pseudo-stresses, such as the Reynolds stress, should be attributed to the background flow. Furthermore, most existing propositions for this closure involve small-particle approximations. Here, we show that all existing buoyancy closures are mathematically inconsistent with at least one of three simple thought experiments designed to determine the roles of pseudo-stresses and small-particle approximations. We then derive the unique closure consistent with these thought experiments. It fully incorporates all pseudo-stresses, requires no approximation, and is supported by particle-resolved numerical simulations. Remarkably, it exhibits a low-pass filter property, attenuating buoyancy at short wavelengths, that prevents it from causing Hadamard instabilities, constituting a first-principle-based solution to the long-standing ill-posedness problem of two-fluid models. When employing the derived closure, even the simplest two-fluid model, the dissipation-free one-pressure model, is hyperbolic.

Abstract: Tree tensor networks (TTNs) are widely used in low-rank approximation and quantum many-body simulation. In this work, we present a formal analysis of the differential geometry underlying TTNs. Building on this foundation, we develop efficient first- and second-order optimization algorithms that exploit the intrinsic quotient structure of TTNs. Additionally, we devise a backpropagation algorithm for training TTNs in a kernel learning setting. We validate our methods through numerical experiments on a representative machine learning task.

Title: evoxels: A differentiable physics framework for voxel-based microstructure simulations
Authors: Simon Daubner, Alexander E. Cohen, Benjamin Dörich, Samuel J. Cooper
Abstract: Materials science inherently spans disciplines: experimentalists use advanced microscopy to uncover micro- and nanoscale structure, while theorists and computational scientists develop models that link processing, structure, and properties. Bridging these domains is essential for inverse material design where you start from desired performance and work backwards to optimal microstructures and manufacturing routes. Integrating high-resolution imaging with predictive simulations and data-driven optimization accelerates discovery and deepens understanding of process-structure-property relationships. The differentiable physics framework evoxels is based on a fully Pythonic, unified voxel-based approach that integrates segmented 3D microscopy data, physical simulations, inverse modeling, and machine learning.

Title: Following the Committor Flow: A Data-Driven Discovery of Transition Pathways
Authors: Cheng Giuseppe Chen, Chenyu Tang, Alberto Megías, Radu A. Talmazan, Sergio Contreras Arredondo, Benoît Roux, Christophe Chipot
Abstract: The discovery of transition pathways to unravel distinct reaction mechanisms and, in general, rare events that occur in molecular systems is still a challenge. Recent advances have focused on analyzing the transition path ensemble using the committor probability, widely regarded as the most informative one-dimensional reaction coordinate. Consistency between transition pathways and the committor function is essential for accurate mechanistic insight. In this work, we propose an iterative framework to infer the committor and, subsequently, to identify the most relevant transition pathways. Starting from an initial guess for the transition path, we generate biased sampling from which we train a neural network to approximate the committor probability. From this learned committor, we extract dominant transition channels as discretized strings lying on isocommittor surfaces. These pathways are then used to enhance sampling and iteratively refine both the committor and the transition paths until convergence. The resulting committor enables accurate estimation of the reaction rate constant. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on benchmark systems, including a two-dimensional model potential, peptide conformational transitions, and a Diels--Alder reaction.

Title: Higher-Order Kuramoto Oscillator Network for Dense Associative Memory
Authors: Jona Nagerl, Natalia G. Berloff
Abstract: Networks of phase oscillators can serve as dense associative memories if they incorporate higher-order coupling beyond the classical Kuramoto model's pairwise interactions. Here we introduce a generalized Kuramoto model with combined second-harmonic (pairwise) and fourth-harmonic (quartic) coupling, inspired by dense Hopfield memory theory. Using mean-field theory and its dynamical approximation, we obtain a phase diagram for dense associative memory model that exhibits a tricritical point at which the continuous onset of memory retrieval is supplanted by a discontinuous, hysteretic transition. In the quartic-dominated regime, the system supports bistable phase-locked states corresponding to stored memory patterns, with a sizable energy barrier between memory and incoherent states. We analytically determine this bistable region and show that the escape time from a memory state (due to noise) grows exponentially with network size, indicating robust storage. Extending the theory to finite memory load, we show that higher-order couplings achieve superlinear scaling of memory capacity with system size, far exceeding the limit of pairwise-only oscillators. Large-scale simulations of the oscillator network confirm our theoretical predictions, demonstrating rapid pattern retrieval and robust storage of many phase patterns. These results bridge the Kuramoto synchronization with modern Hopfield memories, pointing toward experimental realization of high-capacity, analog associative memory in oscillator systems.

Title: Random Lozenge Waterfall: Dimensional Collapse of Gibbs Measures
Authors: Alisa Knizel, Leonid Petrov
Abstract: We investigate the asymptotic behavior of the q-Racah probability measure on lozenge tilings of a hexagon whose side lengths scale linearly with a large parameter $L$, while the parameters $q\in(0,1)$ and $\kappa\in \mathbf{i}\mathbb{R}$ remain fixed. This regime differs fundamentally from the traditional case $q\sim e^{-c/L}\to1$, in which random tilings are locally governed by two-dimensional translation-invariant ergodic Gibbs measures. In the fixed-q regime we uncover a new macroscopic phase, the waterfall (previously only observed experimentally), where the two-dimensional Gibbs structure collapses into a one-dimensional random stepped interface that we call a barcode. We prove a law of large numbers and exponential concentration, showing that the random tilings converge to a deterministic waterfall profile. We further conjecture an explicit correlation kernel of the one-dimensional barcode process arising in the limit. Remarkably, the limit is invariant under shifts by $2\mathbb{Z}$ but not by $\mathbb{Z}$, exhibiting an emergent period-two structure absent from the original weights. Our conjectures are supported by extensive numerical evidence and perfect sampling simulations. The kernel is built from a family of functions orthogonal in both spaces $\ell^{2}(\mathbb{Z})$ and $\ell^{2}(\mathbb{Z}+\frac12)$, that may be of independent interest. Our proofs adapt the spectral projection method of Borodin-Gorin-Rains (https://arxiv.org/abs/0905.0679) to the regime with fixed~q. The resulting asymptotic analysis is substantially more involved, and leads to non-self-adjoint operators. We overcome these challenges in the exponential concentration result by a separate argument based on sharp bounds for the ratios of probabilities under the q-Racah orthogonal polynomial ensemble.

Title: Manipulating non-abelian anyons of Kitaev quantum spin liquids with local magnetic fields
Authors: Haoran Wang, Alessandro Principi
Abstract: Non-abelian anyonic excitations of quantum spin liquids have potential for application to topological quantum computation, but designing logical operations requires developing protocols to faithfully create, move, and read-out such quasiparticles. In this paper, we present a protocol that manipulates the $Z_2$ fluxes (``visons''), and their bound Majorana zero mode, of the Kitaev model. This is achieved by adiabatically switching-off and -on interaction terms in the Hamiltonian, and applying a local magnetic field. We test our protocol by exchanging two Majorana zero modes, analysing the errors it produces. We find that the error rate of our protocol can be suppressed exponentially by increasing the adiabatic turn-on time and the size of the system. However, realistic implementations must consider the trade off between different error sources.

Title: Ordered phases and superconductivity in two-dimensional electron systems subject to pair spin-orbit interaction
Authors: Feng Liu, Alessandro Principi
Abstract: Pair spin-orbit interaction can emerge in strongly-interacting systems characterized by a large spin-orbit coupling. Here we study the role of this interaction in stabilizing ordered and unconventional superconducting phases. We find that, if the system avoids superconductivity, the order realized is a combination of charge-density and spin-vorticity waves. The latter is reminiscent of a loop-current state, albeit in the spin, rather in the charge, channel. If the system becomes superconducting, the order parameter assumes the form of a paired density wave, i.e. pairing occurs at finite momentum. Intriguingly, one of the possible pairings acquires a form analogous to Amperean superconductivity. However, the order parameter here is always a blend of paired density wave and Amperean pairing, rather than being purely one or the other.

Title: Pressure-enhanced $f$-electron orbital weighting in UTe2 mapped by quantum interferometry
Authors: T. I. Weinberger, Z. Wu, A. J. Hickey, D. E. Graf, G. Li, P. Wang, R. Zhou, A. Cabala, J. Pu, V. Sechovsky, M. Valiska, G. G. Lonzarich, F. M. Grosche, A. G. Eaton
Abstract: The phase landscape of UTe$_2$ features a remarkable diversity of superconducting phases under applied pressure and magnetic field. Recent quantum oscillation studies at ambient pressure have revealed the quasi-2D Fermi surface of this material. However, the pressure-dependence of the Fermi surface remains an open question. Here we track the evolution of the UTe$_2$ Fermi surface as a function of pressure up to 19.5 kbar by measuring quantum interference oscillations. We find that in sufficient magnetic field to suppress both superconductivity at low pressures and incommensurate antiferromagnetism at higher pressures, the quasi-2D Fermi surface found at ambient pressure smoothly connects to that at 19.5 kbar, with no signs of a reconstruction over this pressure interval. We observe a smooth increase in oscillatory frequency with increasing pressure, indicating that the warping of the cylindrical Fermi sheets continuously increases with pressure. By computing a tight-binding model, we show that this enhanced warping indicates increased $f$-orbital contribution at the Fermi level - up to and beyond the critical pressure at which superconductivity is truncated. These findings highlight the value of high-pressure quantum interference measurements as a new probe of the electronic structure in heavy fermion materials.

Title: Sub-ballistic operator growth in spin chains with heavy-tailed random fields
Authors: Christopher L. Baldwin
Abstract: We rigorously prove that in nearly arbitrary quantum spin chains with power-law-distributed random fields, namely such that the probability of a field exceeding $h$ scales as $h^{-\alpha}$, it is impossible for any operator evolving in the Heisenberg picture to spread with dynamical exponent less than $1/\alpha$. In particular, ballistic growth is impossible for $\alpha < 1$, diffusive growth is impossible for $\alpha < 1/2$, and any finite dynamical exponent becomes impossible for sufficiently small $\alpha$. This result thus establishes a wide family of models in which the disorder provably prevents conventional transport. We express the result as a tightening of Lieb-Robinson bounds due to random fields -- the proof modifies the standard derivation such that strong fields appear as effective weak interactions, and then makes use of analogous recent results for random-bond spin chains.

Title: Collaborative filtering based on nonnegative/binary matrix factorization
Authors: Yukino Terui, Yuka Inoue, Yohei Hamakawa, Kosuke Tatsumura, Kazue Kudo
Abstract: Collaborative filtering generates recommendations by exploiting user-item similarities based on rating data, which often contains numerous unrated items. To predict scores for unrated items, matrix factorization techniques such as nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) are often employed. Nonnegative/binary matrix factorization (NBMF), which is an extension of NMF, approximates a nonnegative matrix as the product of nonnegative and binary matrices. While previous studies have applied NBMF primarily to dense data such as images, this paper proposes a modified NBMF algorithm tailored for collaborative filtering with sparse data. In the modified method, unrated entries in the rating matrix are masked, enhancing prediction accuracy. Furthermore, utilizing a low-latency Ising machine in NBMF is advantageous in terms of the computation time, making the proposed method beneficial.

Title: Computational complexity of three-dimensional Ising spin glass: Lessons from D-Wave annealer
Authors: Hao Zhang, Alex Kamenev
Abstract: Finding an exact ground state of a three-dimensional (3D) Ising spin glass is proven to be an NP-hard problem (i.e., at least as hard as any problem in the nondeterministic polynomial-time (NP) class). Given validity of the exponential time hypothesis, its computational complexity was proven to be no less than $2^{N^{2/3}}$, where $N$ is the total number of spins. Here, we report results of extensive experimentation with D-Wave 3D annealer with $N\le 5627$. We found exact ground states (in a probabilistic sense) for typical realizations of 3D spin glasses with the efficiency, which scales as $2^{N/ \beta}$ with $\beta\approx 10^3$. Based on statistical analysis of low-energy states, we argue that with an improvement of annealing protocols and device noise reduction, $\beta$ can be increased even further. This suggests that, for $N<\beta^3$, annealing devices provide most efficient way to find an exact ground state.

Title: Disentangling real space fluctuations: the diagnostics of metal-insulator transitions beyond single-particle spectral functions
Authors: Michael Meixner, Marcel Krämer, Nils Wentzell, Pietro M. Bonetti, Sabine Andergassen, Alessandro Toschi, Thomas Schäfer
Abstract: The destruction of metallicity due to the mutual Coulomb interaction of quasiparticles gives rise to fascinating phenomena of solid state physics such as the Mott metal-insulator transition and the pseudogap. A key observable characterizing their occurrences is the single-particle spectral function, determined by the fermionic self-energy. In this paper we investigate in detail how real space fluctuations are responsible for a self-energy that drives the Mott-Hubbard metal-insulator transition. To this aim we first introduce a real space fluctuation diagnostics approach to the Hedin equation, which connects the fermion-boson coupling vertex $\lambda$ to the self-energy $\Sigma$. Second, by using cellular dynamical mean-field theory calculations for $\lambda$ we identify the leading physical processes responsible for the destruction of metallicity across the transition.

Title: Revealing Spin and Spatial Symmetry Decoupling: New Insights into Magnetic Systems with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya Interaction
Authors: Yuxuan Mu, Di Wang, Xiangang Wan
Abstract: It is widely accepted that spin-orbit coupling (SOC) generally locks spin and spatial degrees of freedom, as a result, the spin, despite being an axial vector, is fixed and cannot rotate independently, and the magnetic system should be described by magnetic space groups (MSGs). While as a new type of group, spin space groups (SSGs) have been introduced to approximately describe the symmetry of magnetic systems with negligible SOC, and received significant attention recently. In this work, we prove that in two cases of coplanar spin configurations, there are spin-only operations that strictly hold even with considerable Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), and the symmetry of their spin models could be described by the spin-coplanar SSG. In addition, we also find that for spin-collinear cases, regardless the strength of DMI, the magnon systems within the framework of linear spin wave theory (LSWT) also preserve the decoupled spin and spatial rotations, but the symmetry does not belong to the conventional definitions of collinear spin groups. We discuss the potential realization of these novel symmetries in rod, layer, and three-dimensional (3D) space groups. Our work extends the applicability of SSGs to magnetic materials with heavy elements, and reveals that the coexistence of DMI and SSG symmetries provides new opportunity for exploring novel magnon transport phenomena, and potential material realization had also been discussed.

Title: Dispersion of neutral collective modes in partonic fractional quantum Hall states and its applications to paired states of composite fermions
Authors: Koyena Bose, Ajit C. Balram
Abstract: The Moore-Read Pfaffian (Pf) state exhibits two distinct neutral excitation modes, the bosonic magnetoroton mode, and the neutral fermion mode. These two modes have been conjectured to be supersymmetric (SUSY) partners in the long-wavelength limit. Previous studies on these neutral excitations of the Pf state have shown evidence in favor of SUSY in the vicinity of the second Landau level (SLL) Coulomb interaction. Inspired by that, using the framework of parton theory, we test the SUSY conjecture for a state that lies in the same universality class as the particle-hole conjugate of the Pf, namely the anti-Pf (aPf) state, by constructing explicit wave functions for its magnetoroton and neutral fermion excitations and evaluating them for very large system sizes. As with the previous studies on the Pf state, we find that the long-wavelength gaps of the neutral modes of the parton state belonging to the same topological class as the aPf are close to each other for the SLL Coulomb interaction. Furthermore, using the parton wave functions, we compute the dispersion of various neutral collective excitations, including the magnetoroton, neutral fermion, and parton-excitons, for several notable non-Abelian and Abelian states. Finally, we propose a parton-exciton ansatz for the gapped neutral excitation of the composite fermion Fermi liquid at quarter filling and compute its dispersion for the Coulomb interaction in the lowest Landau level.

Title: Chirality-induced orbital Edelstein effect in an analytically solvable model
Authors: Börge Göbel, Lennart Schimpf, Ingrid Mertig
Abstract: Chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS), a phenomenon wherein chiral structures selectively determine the spin polarization of electron currents flowing through the material, has garnered significant attention due to its potential applications in areas such as spintronics, enantioseparation, and catalysis. The underlying physical effect is the Edelstein effect that converts charge to angular momentum. Besides a spin contribution there exists a contribution based on the orbital angular momentum but the precise mechanism for its generation remains yet to be understood. Here, we introduce the minimal model for explaining the phenomenon based on the orbital Edelstein effect. We consider non-local inter-site contributions to the current-induced orbital angular momentum and reveal the underlying mechanism by analytically calculating the Edelstein susceptibilities in a tight-binding and Boltzmann approach. While the orbital angular momentum is directly generated by the chirality of the crystal, the spin contribution of each spin-split band pair relies on spin-orbit coupling. Using tellurium as an example, we show that the orbital contribution surpasses the spin contribution by orders of magnitude.

Title: Fine-tuning foundation models of materials interatomic potentials with frozen transfer learning
Authors: Mariia Radova, Wojciech G. Stark, Connor S. Allen, Reinhard J. Maurer, Albert P. Bartók
Abstract: Machine-learned interatomic potentials are revolutionising atomistic materials simulations by providing accurate and scalable predictions within the scope covered by the training data. However, generation of an accurate and robust training data set remains a challenge, often requiring thousands of first-principles calculations to achieve high accuracy. Foundation models have started to emerge with the ambition to create universally applicable potentials across a wide range of materials. While foundation models can be robust and transferable, they do not yet achieve the accuracy required to predict reaction barriers, phase transitions, and material stability. This work demonstrates that foundation model potentials can reach chemical accuracy when fine-tuned using transfer learning with partially frozen weights and biases. For two challenging datasets on reactive chemistry at surfaces and stability and elastic properties of tertiary alloys, we show that frozen transfer learning with 10-20% of the data (hundreds of datapoints) achieves similar accuracies to models trained from scratch (on thousands of datapoints). Moreover, we show that an equally accurate, but significantly more efficient surrogate model can be built using the transfer learned potential as the ground truth. In combination, we present a simulation workflow for machine learning potentials that improves data efficiency and computational efficiency.

Title: From Champagne to Confined Polymer:Natural and Artificial Bubble Nucleation
Authors: Carlos Arauz-Moreno, Keyvan Piroird, Elise Lorenceau
Abstract: In this study, we present an experimental work on bubble nucleation and growth using a model system comprised of viscoelastic polyvinyl butyral confined in a Hele-Shaw cell geometry that is decompressed at elevated temperatures. The appearance and growth of bubbles are connected to the temperature-induced shift in chemical equilibrium experienced simultaneously by two gases present in the bulk. The latter becomes simultaneously oversaturated with water vapor and slightly undersaturated in air. Our bubbles grow with various shapes and sizes depending on the initial morphology of the nucleus or the presence of neighboring bubbles. For large nuclei, bubbles grow anisotropically because of contact line pinning. The likelihood of nucleation is related to the amount of water dissolved in the bulk and the imposed temperature. Counter-intuitively, the number of nuclei whence a bubble can grow is inversely correlated with said temperature. In an analogy with champagne, we show that nucleation can either be natural, at trapped fibers or dust particles, or artificial, at crenels we purposefully made in the glass surface. Our results indicate that the growth rate of bubbles can be impacted by the nucleation mechanism.

Title: Coherent cellular dynamical mean-field theory: a real-space quantum embedding approach to disorder in strongly correlated electron systems
Authors: Patrick Tscheppe, Marcel Klett, Henri Menke, Sabine Andergassen, Niklas Enderlein, Philipp Hansmann, Thomas Schäfer
Abstract: We formulate a quantum embedding algorithm in real-space for the simultaneous theoretical treatment of nonlocal electronic correlations and disorder, the coherent cellular dynamical mean-field theory (C-CDMFT). This algorithm combines the molecular coherent potential approximation with the cellular dynamical mean-field theory. After a pedagogical review of quantum embedding theories for disordered and interacting electron systems, and a detailed discussion of its work flow, we present first results from C-CDMFT for the half-filled two-dimensional Anderson-Hubbard model on a square lattice: (i) the analysis of its Mott metal-insulator transition as a function of disorder strength, and (ii) the impact of different types of disorder on its magnetic phase diagram. For the latter, by means of a ``disorder diagnostics'', we are able to precisely identify the contributions of different disorder configurations to the system's magnetic response.

Title: Fractional Brownian motion with mean-density interaction: a myopic self-avoiding fractional stochastic process
Authors: Jonathan House, Rashad Bakhshizada, Skirmantas Janušonis, Ralf Metzler, Thomas Vojta
Abstract: Fractional Brownian motion is a Gaussian stochastic process with long-range correlations in time; it has been shown to be a useful model of anomalous diffusion. Here, we investigate the effects of mutual interactions in an ensemble of particles undergoing fractional Brownian motion. Specifically, we introduce a mean-density interaction in which each particle in the ensemble is coupled to the gradient of the total, time-integrated density produced by the entire ensemble. We report the results of extensive computer simulations for the mean-squared displacements and the probability densities of particles undergoing one-dimensional fractional Brownian motion with such a mean-density interaction. We find two qualitatively different regimes, depending on the anomalous diffusion exponent $\alpha$ characterizing the fractional Gaussian noise. The motion is governed by the interactions for $\alpha < 4/3$ whereas it is dominated by the fractional Gaussian noise for $\alpha > 4/3$. We develop a scaling theory explaining our findings. We also discuss generalizations to higher space dimensions and nonlinear interactions, the relation of our process to the ``true'' or myopic self-avoiding walk, as well as applications to the growth of strongly stochastic axons (e.g., serotonergic fibers) in vertebrate brains.

Title: Quasiparticle gap renormalization driven by internal and external screening in a WS$_2$ device

Abstract: The electronic band gap of a two-dimensional semiconductor within a device architecture is sensitive to variations in screening properties of adjacent materials in the device and to gate-controlled doping. Here, we employ micro-focused angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy to separate band gap renormalization effects stemming from environmental screening and electron-doping during \textit{in situ} gating of a single-layer WS$_{2}$ device. The WS$_{2}$ is supported on hBN and contains a section that is exposed to vacuum and another section that is encapsulated by a graphene contact. We directly observe the doping-induced semiconductor-metal transition and band gap renormalization in the two sections of WS$_2$. Surprisingly, a larger band gap renormalization is observed in the vacuum-exposed section than in the graphene-encapsulated - and thus ostensibly better screened - section of the WS$_2$. Using $GW$ calculations, we determine that intrinsic screening due to stronger doping in vacuum exposed WS$_2$ exceeds the external environmental screening in graphene-encapsulated WS$_2$.

Title: Matrix approach to generalized ensemble theory
Authors: Shaohua Guan
Abstract: Despite significant advances in stochastic thermodynamics, a universal and rigorous ensemble framework for nonequilibrium steady states remains lacking. Here, we provide a concise framework for generalized ensemble theory through a matrix-based approach. By introducing an observation matrix, we show that any discrete probability distribution can be formulated as a generalized Boltzmann distribution, with observables and their conjugate variables serving as basis vectors and coordinates in a vector space. Within this framework, we identify the minimal sufficient statistics required to infer the Boltzmann distribution. The nonequilibrium thermodynamic relations and fluctuation-dissipation relations naturally emerge from this framework. Our findings provide a new approach to developing generalized ensemble theory for nonequilibrium steady-state systems.

Title: Hydrogen Storage Potential of Chromium-Functionalized Graphene: A First-Principles Investigation
Authors: Pratyasha Tripathy, Hetvi Jadav, Himanshu Pandey
Abstract: Sorbent materials, such as graphene-based systems coated with Cr, are being investigated as potential hydrogen storage materials. Graphene, a 2D material with a high surface-to-volume ratio, has been employed. A comparison is conducted between graphene systems with single vacancy defects and those without defects, using Cr adsorption. To verify the effectiveness of hydrogen storage, ab initio calculations are carried out both with and without Van der Waals interactions. The system's binding energy is calculated to assess efficiency. According to the Department of Energy in the United States, the ideal range for binding energy for reversible hydrogen storage is between 0.2 and 0.6 eV. To anticipate the stability of the efficient materials at room temperature, this work exploits the molecular dynamics computations to depict their thermal stability spectrum.

Title: Ultrafast Spontaneous Exciton Dissociation via Phonon Emission in BiVO$_4$
Authors: Stephen E. Gant, Antonios M. Alvertis, Christopher J. N. Coveney, Jonah B. Haber, Marina R. Filip, Jeffrey B. Neaton
Abstract: Monoclinic bismuth vanadate (m-BiVO$_4$) is a promising indirect band gap semiconductor for photoelectrochemical water splitting, yet the characteristics of its low-lying photoexcitations, or excitons, remain poorly understood. Here, we use an ab initio Bethe-Salpeter equation approach that incorporates phonon screening to compute the nature and lifetimes of the low-lying excitons of m-BiVO$_4$. Our calculations indicate that at 0 K, the lowest-lying exciton energy exceeds the indirect band gap, enabling spontaneous dissociation into free carriers via phonon emission within picoseconds. At 300 K, both phonon emission and absorption effects reduce this timescale to only a few femtoseconds. Phonon screening also greatly reduces the binding energy of the lowest-lying exciton, leading to an optical absorption spectrum that better reproduces experimental measurements. Overall, our findings establish the general conditions under which phonon emission-driven exciton dissociation can occur in indirect gap semiconductors, and they emphasize the critical role phonon screening can play in predictive calculations of photophysical properties of complex materials.

Title: Single-Particle Dispersion and Density of States of the Half-Filled 2D Hubbard Model
Authors: Gabe Schumm, Shiwei Zhang, Anders W. Sandvik
Abstract: Implementing an improved method for analytic continuation and working with imaginary-time correlation functions computed using quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we resolve the single-particle dispersion relation and the density of states (DOS) of the two-dimensional Hubbard model at half-filling. At intermediate interactions of $U/t = 4,6$, we find quadratic dispersion around the gap minimum at wave-vectors $\mathbf{k} = (\pm \pi/2, \pm \pi/2)$ (the $\Sigma$ points). We find saddle points at $\mathbf{k} = (\pm \pi,0),(0,\pm \pi)$ (the X points) where the dispersion is approximately quartic, leading to a sharp DOS maximum above the almost flat ledge arising from the states close to $\Sigma$. The fraction of quasiparticle states within the ledge is $n_{\rm ledge} \approx 0.15$. Upon doping away from half-filling, within the rigid-band approximation, these results support Fermi pockets around the $\Sigma$ points, with states around the X points becoming filled only at doping fractions $x \ge n_{\rm ledge}$. The high density of states away from the $\Sigma$ gap edge may be an important clue for a finite minimum doping level for superconductivity and other instabilities of doped Mott insulators.

Title: Positive Terahertz Photoconductivity in CdHgTe Under Hydrostatic Pressure

Abstract: Positive terahertz photoconductivity is observed at room temperature in CdHgTe thin films with different Cd contents. We show that electron gas heating caused by Drude-like absorption results in positive photoconductivity because of the interband activation mechanism specific for undoped narrow-gap semiconductors and semimetals. Applying intense terahertz radiation, we observed that the photoconductivity saturates at high intensities, which was found to be caused by absorption bleaching. Both the magnitude of the photoconductivity and the saturation intensity are shown to exhibit an exponential dependence on the hydrostatic pressure. We show that this is a consequence of the fact that both phenomena are controlled by the ratio of energy and momentum relaxation times.

Title: Bulk nanocrystalline Al-Mg-Y alloys with amorphous grain boundary complexions display high strength and compressive plasticity
Authors: Tianjiao Lei, Esther Hessong, Brandon Fields, Raphael Pierre Thiraux, Daniel S. Gianola, Timothy J. Rupert
Abstract: Although nanocrystalline alloys regularly exhibit high strengths, their use in structural applications often face challenges due to sample size limitations, unstable microstructures, and the limited ability to plastically deform. The incorporation of amorphous grain boundary complexions has been proposed to address these issues, by simultaneously stabilizing nanocrystalline grain structures for scale-up processing and improving alloy toughness. In the present study, the mechanical behavior of bulk nanocrystalline Al-Mg-Y is examined with macroscale compression testing, probing a length scale that is relevant to real-world structural applications. Bulk samples were fabricated via a simple powder metallurgy approach, with different pressing temperatures and times employed for consolidation in order to investigate microstructural and property evolution. All of the specimens contained primary face-centered cubic Al and secondary Al4C3 and Al3Y phases, with the Al3Y particles exhibiting two populations of small equiaxed and larger elongated particles. Appreciable plasticity was measured along with high ultimate stresses over 800 MPa due to the presence of amorphous grain boundary complexions. Microstructural characterization of fracture surfaces revealed that the area fraction of dimpled regions increased with longer hot-pressing time. Most importantly, the elongated Al3Y particles formed regular cellular patterns with increasing hot-pressing time, delaying shear localization and significantly enhancing plasticity. The hierarchy present in the microstructure of the Al-Mg-Y alloy, from amorphous grain boundary complexions to secondary phases, gives rise to excellent bulk mechanical properties, which are attractive for structural applications.

Title: Stokes drag on a sphere in a three-dimensional anisotropic porous medium
Authors: Andrej Vilfan, Bogdan Cichocki, Jeffrey C. Everts
Abstract: We study the hydrodynamic drag force exerted on a sphere in a static anisotropic porous medium. This problem is analysed using the Brinkman-Debye-Bueche equations with an axisymmetric shielding (or permeability) tensor. Using the exact Green's functions for this model fluid within a single-layer boundary element formulation, we numerically compute the friction tensor for a translating sphere subjected to stick boundary conditions. Furthermore, we derive approximate analytical expressions for small anisotropy using the Lorentz reciprocal theorem. By benchmarking this result against the numerical solutions, we find that a linear approximation is valid in a broad parameter regime. Our results are important for studying self-diffusion in general anisotropic porous media, but can also be applied to small tracers in nematic fluids composed of disk- or rod-like crowders.

Title: Coulomb Interaction-Stabilized Isolated Narrow Bands with Chern Numbers $\mathcal{C} > 1$ in Twisted Rhombohedral Trilayer-Bilayer Graphene
Authors: Vo Tien Phong, Cyprian Lewandowski
Abstract: Recently, fractional quantum anomalous Hall effects have been discovered in two-dimensional moiré materials when a topologically nontrivial band with Chern number $\mathcal{C}=1$ is partially doped. Remarkably, superlattice Bloch bands can carry higher Chern numbers that defy the Landau-level paradigm and may even host exotic fractionalized states with non-Abelian quasiparticles. Inspired by this exciting possibility, we propose twisted \textit{rhombohedral} trilayer-bilayer graphene at $\theta \sim 1.2^\circ$ as a field-tunable quantum anomalous Chern insulator that features spectrally-isolated, kinetically-quenched, and topologically-nontrivial bands with $\mathcal{C} = 2,3$ favorable for fractional phases once fractionally doped, as characterized by their quantum geometry. Based on extensive self-consistent mean-field calculations, we show that these phases are stabilized by Coulomb interactions and are robust against variations in dielectric environment, tight-binding hopping parameters, and lattice relaxation.

Title: Microwave resonator for measuring time-reversal symmetry breaking at cryogenic temperatures
Authors: T. Chouinard, D. M. Broun
Abstract: We present a microwave-frequency method for measuring polar Kerr effect and spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB) in unconventional superconductors. While this experiment is motivated by work performed in the near infrared using zero-loop-area Sagnac interferometers, the microwave implementation is quite different, and is based on the doubly degenerate modes of a TE$_{111}$ cavity resonator, which act as polarization states analogous to those of light. The resonator system has $in$-$situ$ actuators that allow quadrupolar distortions of the resonator shape to be controllably tuned, as these compete with the much smaller perturbations that arise from TRSB. The most reliable way to the detect the TRSB signal is by interrogating the two-mode resonator system with circularly polarized microwaves, in which case the presence of TRSB shows up unambiguously as a difference between the forward and reverse transmission response of the resonator - i.e., as a breaking of reciprocity. We illustrate and characterize a coupler system that generates and detects circularly polarized microwaves, and then show how these are integrated with the TE$_{111}$ resonator, resulting in a dilution refrigerator implementation with a base temperature of 20 mK. We show test data on yttrium-iron-garnet (YIG) ferrite and the van der Waals ferromagnet CrGeTe$_3$ as an illustration of how the system operates, then present data showing system performance under realistic conditions at millikelvin temperatures.

Title: It's about time: a thermodynamic information criterion (TIC)
Authors: Brendan Lucas, Google Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview 05-06
Abstract: Useful chemical processes often involve a desired steady state probability distribution, equilibrium or not, from which product is extracted. Given many different ways to attain the same steady state, which candidate "loses" the least in terms of time and energy? A scalar thermodynamic information criterion (TIC), inspired by AIC, assigns lower values to chemical processes with less estimated "loss" to generate the same desired steady state. As an element of thermodynamic machine learning, TIC naturally extends statistical objective optimization into the realm of chemical physics.

Title: Testing the spin-bath view of self-attention: A Hamiltonian analysis of GPT-2 Transformer
Authors: Satadeep Bhattacharjee, Seung-Cheol Lee
Abstract: The recently proposed physics-based framework by Huo and Johnson~\cite{huo2024capturing} models the attention mechanism of Large Language Models (LLMs) as an interacting two-body spin system, offering a first-principles explanation for phenomena like repetition and bias. Building on this hypothesis, we extract the complete Query-Key weight matrices from a production-grade GPT-2 model and derive the corresponding effective Hamiltonian for every attention head. From these Hamiltonians, we obtain analytic phase boundaries and logit gap criteria that predict which token should dominate the next-token distribution for a given context. A systematic evaluation on 144 heads across 20 factual-recall prompts reveals a strong negative correlation between the theoretical logit gaps and the model's empirical token rankings ($r\approx-0.70$, $p<10^{-3}$).Targeted ablations further show that suppressing the heads most aligned with the spin-bath predictions induces the anticipated shifts in output probabilities, confirming a causal link rather than a coincidental association. Taken together, our findings provide the first strong empirical evidence for the spin-bath analogy in a production-grade model. In this work, we utilize the context-field lens, which provides physics-grounded interpretability and motivates the development of novel generative models bridging theoretical condensed matter physics and artificial intelligence.

Title: Streamline controlled rectification of supercurrent in thin-film asymmetric weak links
Authors: Filippo Antola, Sebastiano Battisti, Alessandro Braggio, Francesco Giazotto, Giorgio De Simoni
Abstract: In this study, we examined the supercurrent diode effect (SDE) in mesoscopic superconducting weak links formed by asymmetric Dayem bridges. These planar metallic constrictions, which naturally exhibit Josephsonlike behavior, offer a fundamental platform for investigating nonreciprocal transport phenomena in a regime where the bridge width aligns with the superconducting coherence length. The foundational concept is inspired by the Tesla valve, a classical fluidic device that achieves flow rectification through interference and turbulence between fluid streams enabled by geometric asymmetry. Analogously, we demonstrate that spatial asymmetry within superconducting structures can result in rectification due to the polarity-dependent interaction between transport and screening currents. By implementing controlled geometric defects at the junction between the constriction and superconducting leads, we induce current crowding and disrupt spatial inversion symmetry, thus facilitating directional switching behavior. Experimental results indicate a linear-in-field rectification regime at low magnetic fields, driven by the interaction between transport and screening currents, which is succeeded by complex vortex dynamics within the superconducting banks at elevated fields. Time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau simulations replicate significant features of the experimental observations and substantiate the influence of both screening currents and rearrangements of Abrikosov vortices. A comparative study across various geometries highlights the crucial role of defect shape and spatial confinement in determining the rectification efficiency, revealing a minimum threshold in bridge width below which crowding-induced SDE is significantly reduced. Our findings advocate for mesoscopic Dayem bridges as a flexible platform for designing and controlling superconducting diode functionalities.

Title: A minimal model with stochastically broken reciprocity
Authors: Z. C. Tu
Abstract: We introduce a minimal model consisting of a two-body system with stochastically broken reciprocity (i.e., random violation of Newton's third law) and then investigate its statistical behaviors, including fluctuations of velocity and position, time evolution of probability distribution functions, energy gain, and entropy production. The effective temperature of this two-body system immersed in a thermal bath is also derived. Furthermore, we heuristically present an extremely minimal model where the relative motion adheres to the same rules as in classical mechanics, while the effect of stochastically broken reciprocity only manifests in the fluctuating motion of the center of mass.

Title: Tunable spin-wave nonreciprocity in ferrimagnetic domain-wall channels
Authors: Tingting Liu, Shuhong Li, Yunlong Liu, Shuchao Qin, Yang Liu, Wenjun Wang, Minghui Qin
Abstract: The nonreciprocal propagation of spin waves (SWs) offers opportunities for developing novel functional magnonic logic devices, where controllability is crucial for magnetic signal processing. Domain walls act as natural waveguides due to their magnetic configuration, offering a platform for the in-depth investigation of nonreciprocal SW propagation and its manipulation. In this work, we theoretically and numerically investigate the tunable spin-wave nonreciprocity in ferrimagnetic domain-wall channels under the influence of an external field. It is revealed that the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction exerts dual control over both nonreciprocal spin-wave propagation and spin-splitting phenomena. Moreover, SW nonreciprocity is magnetically tunable, with its sign reversibly switched by inverting the applied field direction, while preserving the host spin configuration. The orientation of the magnetic field can selectively stabilize or destabilize the domain wall structure, offering precise control over spin-wave nonreciprocity. Ultimately, we demonstrate a controllable SW transmission scheme via external magnetic field modulation, providing critical insights for the design of future magnonic devices.

Title: Macroscopic fluctuation theory and the absorption of Brownian particles by partially reactive targets
Authors: Paul C Bressloff
Abstract: We use macroscopic fluctuation theory (MFT) to analyse current fluctuations in a non-interacting Brownian gas with one or more partially absorbing targets within a bounded domain $\Omega \subset \R^d$. We proceed by coarse-graining a generalised Dean-Kawasaki equation with Robin boundary conditions at the target surfaces. The exterior surface $\partial \Omega$ is maintained at a constant density $\owp$. We first derive MFT equations for the optimal noise-induced path for a single target under a saddle-point approximation of the associated path integral action. We then obtain the Gaussian distribution characterising small current fluctuations by linearising the MFT equations about the corresponding deterministic or noise-averaged system and solving the resulting stationary equations. The Robin boundary conditions are handled using the spectrum of a Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator defined on the target surface. We illustrate the theory by considering the finite interval and a circular annulus. In both cases we determine how the variance of the current depends on the rate of absorption $\kappa$. Finally, we extend our analysis to multiple partially absorbing targets. First, we obtain the general result that, in the case of partially absorbing targets ($0<\kappa<\infty$), the covariance matrix for current fluctuations supports cross correlations even in the absence of particle interactions. (These cross-correlations vanish in the totally absorbing limit $\kappa\rightarrow \infty$.) We then explicitly calculate the covariance matrix for circular targets in a 2D domain by assuming that the targets are much smaller than the characteristic size $L$ of the domain $\Omega$ and applying methods from singular perturbation theory.

Title: Low-energy atomic scattering: s-wave relation between the interaction potential and the phase shift
Authors: Francesco Lorenzi, Luca Salasnich
Abstract: We investigate the on-shell approximation in the context of s-wave scattering for ultracold two-body collisions. Our analysis systematically covers spatial dimensions D=1,2,3 , with the aim of identifying the regimes in which the approximation remains valid when applied to commonly used model interaction potentials. Specifically, we focus on the square well and delta shell potentials, both of which admit analytical solutions for the s-wave scattering problem in all dimensions considered. By employing the exact analytical expressions for the s-wave scattering phase shift, we perform a direct comparison between the exact on-shell matrix element of the interaction potential and their corresponding approximations across a range of collision momenta. Particular attention is given to the low-energy regime. Our findings indicate that, although the on-shell approximation generally improves with increasing momentum, its accuracy also improves for weaker potentials. Remarkably, in the limit of weak interactions, we demonstrate that the on-shell approximation becomes exact at leading order. In this regime, the approximation offers a controlled means of deriving the low-momentum expansion of the potential and may serve as a useful tool in constructing effective interactions for quantum field theories.

Title: Characterizing local Majorana properties using Andreev states
Authors: Miguel Alvarado, Alfredo Levy Yetati, Ramón Aguado, Rubén Seoane Souto
Abstract: We propose using Andreev bound states (ABS) as spectroscopic probes to characterize Majorana zero modes (MZMs) in quantum-dot based minimal Kitaev chains. Specifically, we show that tunneling conductance measurements with a superconducting probe hosting an ABS reveal four subgap peaks whose voltage positions and relative heights enable extraction of the MZM energy splitting and Bogoliubov-de Gennes coherence factors. This provides direct access to zero-splitting regimes and to the local Majorana polarization - a measure of the Majorana character. The method is compatible with existing experimental architectures and remains robust in extended chains.

Title: Measuring coherence factors of states in superconductors through local current
Authors: Rodrigo A. Dourado, Jeroen Danon, Martin Leijnse, Rubén Seoane Souto
Abstract: The coherence factors of quasiparticles in a superconductor determine their properties, including transport and susceptibility to electric fields. In this work, we propose a way to infer the local coherence factors using local transport to normal leads. Our method is based on measuring the local current through a lead as the coupling to a second one is varied: the shape of the current is determined by the ratio between the local coherence factors, becoming independent of the coupling to the second lead in the presence of local electron-hole symmetry, {\it i.e.} coherence factors $|u|=|v|$. We apply our method to minimal Kitaev chains: arrays of quantum dots coupled via narrow superconducting segments. These chains feature Majorana-like quasiparticles (zero-energy states with $|u|=|v|$) at discrete points in parameter space. We demonstrate that the local current allows us to estimate the local Majorana polarization (MP) -- a measurement of the local Majorana properties of the state. We derive an analytical expression for the MP in terms of local currents and benchmark it against numerical calculations for 2- and 3-sites chains that include a finite Zeeman field and electron-electron interactions. These results provide a way to quantitatively assess the quality of Majorana states in short Kitaev chains.

Title: Observable Statistical Mechanics
Authors: Lodovico Scarpa, Abdulla Alhajri, Vlatko Vedral, Fabio Anza
Abstract: Predicting the stationary behavior of observables in isolated many-body quantum systems is a central challenge in quantum statistical mechanics. While one can often use the Gibbs ensemble, which is simple to compute, there are many scenarios where this is not possible and one must instead use another ensemble, such as the diagonal, microcanonical or generalized Gibbs ensembles. However, these all require detailed information about the energy or other conserved quantities to be constructed. Here we propose a general and computationally easy approach to determine the stationary probability distribution of observables with few outcomes. Interpreting coarse measurements at equilibrium as noisy communication channels, we provide general analytical arguments in favor of the applicability of a maximum entropy principle for this class of observables. We show that the resulting theory accurately predicts stationary probability distributions without detailed microscopic information like the energy eigenstates. Extensive numerical experiments on 7 non-weakly interacting spin-1/2 Hamiltonians demonstrate the broad applicability and robustness of this framework in both quantum integrable and chaotic models.

Title: Semantic segmentation of SEM images of lower bainitic and tempered martensitic steels
Authors: Xiaohan Bie, Manoj Arthanari, Evelin Barbosa de Melo, Baihua Ren, Juancheng Li, Stephen Yue, Salim Brahimi, Jun Song
Abstract: This study employs deep learning techniques to segment scanning electron microscope images, enabling a quantitative analysis of carbide precipitates in lower bainite and tempered martensite steels with comparable strength. Following segmentation, carbides are investigated, and their volume percentage, size distribution, and orientations are probed within the image dataset. Our findings reveal that lower bainite and tempered martensite exhibit comparable volume percentages of carbides, albeit with a more uniform distribution of carbides in tempered martensite. Carbides in lower bainite demonstrate a tendency for better alignment than those in tempered martensite, aligning with the observations of other researchers. However, both microstructures display a scattered carbide orientation, devoid of any discernible pattern. Comparative analysis of aspect ratios and sizes of carbides in lower bainite and tempered martensite unveils striking similarities. The deep learning model achieves an impressive pixelwise accuracy of 98.0% in classifying carbide/iron matrix at the individual pixel level. The semantic segmentation derived from deep learning extends its applicability to the analysis of secondary phases in various materials, offering a time-efficient, versatile AI-powered workflow for quantitative microstructure analysis.

Title: A tweezer array with 6100 highly coherent atomic qubits
Authors: Hannah J. Manetsch, Gyohei Nomura, Elie Bataille, Kon H. Leung, Xudong Lv, Manuel Endres
Abstract: Optical tweezer arrays have transformed atomic and molecular physics, now forming the backbone for a range of leading experiments in quantum computing, simulation, and metrology. Typical experiments trap tens to hundreds of atomic qubits, and recently systems with around one thousand atoms were realized without defining qubits or demonstrating coherent control. However, scaling to thousands of atomic qubits with long coherence times, low-loss, and high-fidelity imaging is an outstanding challenge and critical for progress in quantum science, particularly towards quantum error correction. Here, we experimentally realize an array of optical tweezers trapping over 6,100 neutral atoms in around 12,000 sites, simultaneously surpassing state-of-the-art performance for several metrics that underpin the success of the platform. Specifically, while scaling to such a large number of atoms, we demonstrate a coherence time of 12.6(1) seconds, a record for hyperfine qubits in an optical tweezer array. We show room-temperature trapping lifetimes of 23 minutes, enabling record-high imaging survival of 99.98952(1)% with an imaging fidelity of over 99.99%. We present a plan for zone-based quantum computing and demonstrate necessary coherence-preserving qubit transport and pick-up/drop-off operations on large spatial scales, characterized through interleaved randomized benchmarking. Our results, along with recent developments, indicate that universal quantum computing and quantum error correction with thousands to tens of thousands of physical qubits could be a near-term prospect.

Title: Anderson localization of light by impurities in a solid transparent matrix
Authors: S.E. Skipetrov, I.M. Sokolov
Abstract: A solid transparent medium with randomly positioned, immobile impurity atoms is a promising candidate for observation of Anderson localization of light in three dimensions. It can have low losses and allows for mitigation of the detrimental effect of longitudinal optical fields by an external magnetic field, but it has its own issues: thermal oscillations of atoms around their equilibrium positions and inhomogeneous broadening of atomic spectral lines due to random local electric fields. Our calculations suggest that these complications should not impede observation of Anderson localization of light in such materials provided that sufficiently high number densities of impurities can be reached. The thermal oscillations hardly affect light propagation whereas the inhomogeneous broadening can be compensated for by increasing the number density of impurities.

Title: Separable ellipsoids around multipartite states
Authors: Robin Y. Wen, Gilles Parez, Liuke Lyu, William Witczak-Krempa, Achim Kempf
Abstract: We show that, in finite dimensions, around any $m$-partite product state $\rho_{\rm prod}=\rho_1\otimes...\otimes\rho_m$, there exists an ellipsoid of separable states centered around $\rho_{\rm prod}$. This separable ellipsoid contains the separable ball proposed in previous works, and the volume of the ellipsoid is typically exponentially larger than that of the ball, due to the hierarchy of eigenvalues in typical states. We further generalize this ellipsoidal criterion to a trace formula that yields separable region around all separable states, and further study biseparability. Our criteria not only help numerical procedures to rigorously detect separability, but they also lead to a nested hierarchy of SLOCC-stable subsets that cover the separable set. We apply the procedure for separability detection to 3-qubit X states, genuinely entangled 4-qubit states mixed with noise, and the 1d transverse field Ising model at finite temperature to illustrate the power of our procedure for understanding entanglement in physical systems.

Title: Chiral phase transition: effective field theory and holography
Authors: Yanyan Bu, Zexin Yang
Abstract: We consider the chiral phase transition relevant for QCD matter at finite temperature but with vanishing baryon density. Presumably, the chiral phase transition is of second order for two-flavor QCD in the chiral limit. Near the transition temperature, we apply the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism and construct a low-energy effective field theory for the system, in which fluctuations and dissipations are systematically captured. The dynamical variables involve the chiral charge densities and order parameter (chiral condensate). Via the holographic Schwinger-Keldysh technique, the effective action is further confirmed within a modified AdS/QCD model. With higher-order terms suitably neglected, the stochastic equations derived from the effective field theory resemble those of model F in the Hohenberg-Halperin classification. Within the effective field theory, we briefly discuss the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry and Goldstone modes.

Title: A Radio-Frequency Emitter Design for the Low-Frequency Regime in Atomic Experiments
Authors: Yudong Wei, Zhongshu Hu, Yajing Guo, Zhentian Qian, Shengjie Jin, Xuzong Chen, Xiong-jun Liu
Abstract: Radio-frequency (RF) control is a key technique in cold atom experiments. We present a compact and efficient RF circuit based on a capacitive transformer network, where a low-frequency coil operating up to 30MHz serves as both an intrinsic inductor and a power-sharing element. The design enables high current delivery and flexible impedance matching across a wide frequency range. We integrate both broadband and narrowband RF networks into a unified configuration that overcomes the geometric constraints imposed by the metallic chamber. In evaporative cooling, the broadband network allows a reduction of the applied RF input power from 14.7dBW to -3.5dBW, owing to its non-zero coil current even at ultra-low frequencies. This feature enables the Bose-Fermi mixture to be cooled below 10{\mu}K. In a Landau-Zener protocol, the coil driven by the narrowband network transfers 80% of rubidium atoms from |F = 2,mF = 2> to |2,-2> in 1 millisecond, achieving a Rabi frequency of approximately 9 kHz at an input power of 0.1dBW.

Title: Convergence of Body-Orders in Linear Atomic Cluster Expansions
Authors: Apolinario Miguel Tan, Franco Pellegrini, Stefano de Gironcoli
Abstract: We study the convergence of a linear atomic cluster expansion (ACE) potential with respect to its basis functions, in terms of the effective two-body interactions of elemental Carbon and Silicon systems. We build ACE potentials with descriptor sets truncated at body-orders $K=2$ to $K=5$ trained on a diverse Carbon dataset and on Silicon dimers to pentamers. The potentials trained on diverse structures with standard ACE bases are not able to recover the correct dimer curves much less produce stable curves or solutions. While employing ACE bases removed of self-interactions still does not generalize to the DFT-expected results, properly tailored datasets and basis sets are able to show signs of convergence and stability in the curves and expansions, suggesting a method to build potentials with interpretable bases with respect to the cluster expansion.

Title: Unification of Stochastic and Quantum Thermodynamics in Scalar Field Theory via a Model with Brownian Thermostat
Authors: T. Koide, F. Nicacio
Abstract: We present a systematic procedure to derive a quantum master equation for thermal relaxation in real scalar field theory, expanding on the method proposed in [Koide and Nicacio, Phys. Lett. A494, 129277 (2024)]. We begin by introducing a generalized model for a classical scalar field interacting with a Brownian thermostat, consistent with stochastic thermodynamics. Applying canonical quantization to this model, we derive the corresponding quantum master equation, that is applicable to any form of the scalar field Hamiltonian. While its evolution is generally non-CPTP (Completely Positive and Trace-Preserving), it can be adjusted to describe a CPTP evolution, such as those found in the GKSL (Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad) equation by appropriately tuning the parameters of the model. In this framework, we define heat, work, and entropy in a way that satisfies the first and second laws of quantum thermodynamics. This suggests that the quantum-classical correspondence extends beyond closed systems governed by unitary time evolution to open systems as well. We further investigate the relation between the second law in quantum thermodynamics and relative entropy, providing insights into the study of quantum fluctuations through information-theoretical techniques in quantum field theory.

Title: Jordanian deformation of the non-compact and $\mathfrak{sl}_2 $-invariant $XXX_{-1/2}$ spin-chain
Authors: Riccardo Borsato, Miguel García Fernández
Abstract: Using a Drinfeld twist of Jordanian type, we construct a deformation of the non-compact and $\mathfrak{sl}_2$-invariant $XXX_{-1/2}$ spin-chain. Before the deformation, the seed model can be understood as a sector of the $\mathfrak{psu}(2,2|4)$-invariant spin-chain encoding the spectral problem of $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills at one loop in the planar limit. The deformation gives rise to interesting features because, while being integrable, the Hamiltonian is non-hermitian and non-diagonalisable, so that it only admits a Jordan decomposition. Moreover, the eigenvalues of the deformed Hamiltonian coincide with those of the original undeformed spin-chain. We use explicit examples as well as the techniques of the coordinate and of the algebraic Bethe ansatz to discuss the construction of the (generalised) eigenvectors of the deformed model. We also show that the deformed spin-chain is equivalent to an undeformed one with twisted boundary conditions, and that it may be derived from a scaling limit of the non-compact $U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$-invariant $XXZ_{-1/2} $ spin-chain.

Title: The QUEST Database of Highly-Accurate Excitation Energies
Authors: Pierre-François Loos, Martial Boggio-Pasqua, Aymeric Blondel, Filippo Lipparini, Denis Jacquemin
Abstract: We report theoretical best estimates of vertical transition energies (VTEs) for a large number of excited states and molecules: the \textsc{quest} database. This database includes 1489 \emph{aug}-cc-pVTZ VTEs (731 singlets, 233 doublets, 461 triplets, and 64 quartets) for both valence and Rydberg transitions occurring in molecules containing from 1 to 16 non-hydrogen atoms. \textsc{Quest} also includes a significant list of VTEs for states characterized by a partial or genuine double-excitation character, known to be particularly challenging for many computational methods. The vast majority of the reported values are deemed chemically-accurate, that is, are within $\pm0.05$ eV of the FCI/\emph{aug}-cc-pVTZ estimate. This allows for a balanced assessment of the performance of popular excited-state methodologies. We report the results of such benchmarks for various single- and multi-reference wavefunction approaches, and provide extensive supporting information allowing testing of other models. All corresponding data associated with the \textsc{quest} database, along with analysis tools, can be found in the associated \textsc{GitHub} repository at the following URL: this https URL.
