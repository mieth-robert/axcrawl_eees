Title: Spatially resolved collective modes in d-wave superconductors
Authors: Kazi Ranjibul Islam, Samuel Awelewa, Andrey V. Chubukov, Maxim Dzero
Abstract: We analyze the dispersion of collective modes in a superconductor with $d-$wave symmetry of the order parameter in the presence of long-range Coulomb interaction. We use diagrammatic technique and quasiclassical theory in Keldysh-Nambu formalism to compute longitudinal and transverse pair susceptibilities and extract from them the dispersion of the longitudinal and transverse collective mode. We show that at T=0, the dispersion of the transverse (plasma) mode is the same as in an s-wave superconductor, but at a finite temperature it is softer and has a much larger decay rate due to the partial screening of the Coulomb potential by nodal quasiparticles. We show that the dispersion of the longitudinal mode depends on the direction of momentum with respect to the positions of the nodes of the d-wave gap, while the decay rate of this mode does not depend on momentum. We discuss experimental implications of our results.

Title: Highly efficient superconducting diode effect in unconventional $p$-wave magnets
Authors: Igor de M. Froldi, Hermann Freire
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of superconducting phases, both with zero and finite Cooper-pair center of mass momenta, in recently proposed unconventional $p$-wave magnets. As a consequence, we find that, while these magnetic phases are in principle compatible with a conventional pairing state at zero field, a Fulde-Ferrell phase can generally be promoted as the leading instability under the application of a finite magnetic field. Interestingly, by calculating the efficiency of the superconducting diode effect of this finite momentum pairing state via a Ginzburg-Landau theory, we uncover that a high efficiency can be obtained in these systems for experimentally relevant spin splittings. Therefore, our prediction reveals that the experimental discovery of these new materials represents a promising platform for the construction of energy-efficient logic circuits that can potentially be used, e.g., in the fields of classical and quantum computing.

Title: Emergent Nonperturbative Universal Floquet Localization
Authors: Soumadip Pakrashi, Atanu Rajak, Sambuddha Sanyal
Abstract: We show that a robust, nonperturbative localization plateau emerges in periodically driven quasiperiodic lattices, independent of the static localization properties and drive protocol. Using exact Floquet dynamics, Floquet perturbation theory, and optimal-order van Vleck analysis, we identify a fine-tuned amplitude-to-frequency ratio where all Floquet states become localized despite dense resonances. The van Vleck expansion achieves superasymptotic accuracy up to an optimal orde; it ultimately breaks down due to resonant hybridization at a weak quasiperiodic potential, revealing that the observed localization is nonperturbative.

Title: Entropic Approach to Critical Materials Assessment
Authors: Alan J. Hurd
Abstract: Most methodologies for materials criticality assessment score supply risk and societal importance. Market-based criteria offer quantitative measures for assessment. Here we develop a statistical approach based on a geologic entropy function in which flexible constraints, such as economic, national security related, or regulatory, can be applied. As an example, the formulation describes the relation between elemental price and crustal abundance for selected elements, both important to supply risk. The method may be applicable to parameters resulting from collective decisions exhibiting a highly peaked probability distribution.

Title: Trapping $\tfrac{h}{2e}$ Flux in Metals
Authors: Zohar Komargodski, Fedor K. Popov
Abstract: We report on a new flux quantization phenomenon in metals. We study the response of normal metals to the presence of localized magnetic flux. We find that, due to backreaction effects, the metal traps 0 flux or $\tfrac{h}{2e}$ flux (half flux). We exhibit this effect both for metals pierced by magnetic solenoids and metals wrapping a magnetic solenoid. In the latter case we demonstrate the trapping of magnetic flux analytically. Furthermore, we find that as the solenoid is adiabatically turned off, a logarithmically enhanced localized equilibrium current persists, reflecting perfect defect-diamagnetism of the Fermi gas.

Title: Barrier-crossing and energy relaxation dynamics of non-Markovian inertial systems connected via analytical Green-Fokker-Planck approach
Authors: Roland R. Netz
Abstract: From numerical simulations it is known that the barrier-crossing time of a non-Markovian one-dimensional reaction coordinate with a single exponentially decaying memory function exhibits a memory-turnover: for intermediate values of the memory decay time the barrier-crossing time is reduced compared to the Markovian limit and for long memory times increases quadratically with the memory time when keeping the total integrated friction and the mass constant. The intermediate memory acceleration regime is accurately predicted by Grote-Hynes theory, for the asymptotic long-memory slow-down behavior no systematic analytically tractable theory is available. Starting from the Green function for a general inertial (i.e. finite-mass) non-Markovian Gaussian reaction coordinate in a harmonic well, we derive by an exact mapping a generalized Fokker-Planck equation with a time-dependent effective diffusion constant. To first order in a systematic cumulant expansion we derive an analytical Arrhenius expression for the barrier-crossing time with the pre-exponential factor given by the energy relaxation time, which can be used to robustly predict barrier-crossing times from simulation or experimental trajectory data of general non-Markovian inertial systems without the need to extract memory functions. For a single exponential memory kernel we give a closed-form expression for the barrier-crossing time, which reproduces the Kramers turnover between the high-friction and high-mass limits as well as the memory turnover from the intermediate memory acceleration to the asymptotic long-memory slow-down regime. We also show that non-Markovian systems are singular in the zero-mass limit, which suggests that the long-memory barrier-crossing slow-down reflects the interplay between mass and memory effects. Thus, physically sound models for non-Markovian systems have to include a finite mass.

Title: Coalescence of Printed Yield Stress Filaments in Direct Ink Writing
Authors: Hugo L. França, Daniël Tieman, James D. Shemilt, Cassio Oishi, Maziyar Jalaal
Abstract: In direct ink writing (DIW), neighbouring filaments of yield-stress inks are deposited side-by-side and are expected to merge into smooth, mechanically robust structures. Unlike Newtonian filaments, coalescence can arrest in finite time, leaving a permanent, non-flat ridge set by the competition between capillarity and rheology. Here we study the coalescence of two printed yield-stress filaments, combining scaling theory for the arrested state, direct numerical simulations, and DIW experiments on Carbopol gels imaged by optical coherence tomography. In the viscoplastic limit, we predict and observe an approximately linear decrease of the final bridge height with plastocapillary number and a critical yield stress above which coalescence does not initiate. Simulations further show that elasticity becomes important at high plastocapillary number, enabling larger final bridge heights via a crossover from a rigid Herschel--Bulkley solid to a deformable Kelvin--Voigt response. Our findings provide a framework for predicting deposition profiles and, ultimately, for mitigating residual topography in DIW.

Title: Multiple Andreev Reflection Effects in Asymmetric STM Josephson Junctions
Authors: Wan-Ting Liao, S. K. Dutta, R. E. Butera, C. J. Lobb, F. C. Wellstood, M. Dreyer
Abstract: We have examined the electrical behavior of Josephson junctions formed by a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) with a Nb sample and a Nb tip, with normal-state resistances Rn varying between 1 kOhm and 10 MOhm. Current-voltage characteristics were obtained as a function of Rn by varying the distance between the tip and sample at temperatures of 50 mK and 1.5 K. Rn decreases as the tip-sample separation is reduced, and the junction evolves from a phase-diffusion regime to an underdamped small junction regime, and then to a point contact regime. The subgap structure exhibits pronounced multiple Andreev reflection (MAR) features whose amplitudes and onset energies depend sensitively on junction transparency and gap asymmetry. To interpret these spectra, we generalize the Averin-Bardas MAR theory to superconductors with unequal gap magnitudes, providing a quantitative model appropriate for asymmetric STM junctions. The resulting fits yield the superconducting gaps of the electrodes, barrier transparency, and number of conduction channels as a function of Rn. Combining this analysis with Josephson junction dynamics, we further account for the observed switching and retrapping currents and the finite resistance of the supercurrent branch. Our results demonstrate that incorporating intrinsic electrode asymmetry is essential for reliably extracting transport parameters in STM-based superconducting weak links.

Title: It Takes Two to Make a Thing Go Right: Boosting Current in Coupled Motors
Authors: Geyao Gu, Drew Alvarez, John Strahan, Alex Albaugh, Emanuele Penocchio, Todd R. Gingrich
Abstract: Catalysis-driven synthetic molecular motors operate in a loose mechanochemical coupling regime, one in which a decomposition of a fuel molecule does not reliably produce a forward step. In that regime, stochastic backward steps can significantly degrade the motor's current, prompting us to ask whether mechanically coupling multiple such motors can boost their averaged current. By simulating rotaxane-based motors with two classes of models--particle-based nonequilibrium molecular dynamics and jump-diffusion models--we show that current boosts are physically achievable. Our observed boosts, which amplify current by single-digit factors, emerge when coupling between motors can increase the activity, speeding up the rate of both forward and backward steps. In doing so, the bias for preferring forward steps actually degrades, but the lost bias can be largely recovered by raising the fuel concentration, demonstrating a general design strategy: amplify activity through coupling and restore bias through stronger driving.

Title: Collapse of a single polymer chain: Effects of chain stiffness and attraction range
Authors: Yanyan Zhu, Haim Diamant, David Andelman
Abstract: Chain-like macromolecules in solution, whether biological or synthetic, transform from an extended conformation to a compact one when temperature or other system parameters change. This collapse transition is relevant in various phenomena, including DNA condensation, protein folding, and the behavior of polymers in solution. We investigate the interplay of chain stiffness and range of attraction between monomers in the collapse of a single polymer chain. We use Monte Carlo simulations based on the pruned-enriched Rosenbluth method. Two distinct behaviors are found depending on chain stiffness (represented by the persistence length lp) and attraction range rc. When lp is larger than rc, the chain collapses sharply with decreasing temperature, whereas if lp is smaller than rc, it contracts gradually. Notably, in the regime of small lp and large rc, this rounding into a gradual compaction persists upon increasing the chain length and may remain in place in the limit of infinite chain length. Furthermore, for small rc, the transition temperature (theta-temperature) increases with lp, whereas for large rc the theta-temperature decreases with lp. Thus, stiffness promotes collapse for small rc but suppresses it for large rc. Our findings are in agreement with recent experiments on the contraction of single-stranded RNA as compared to double-stranded DNA, and provide valuable insights for understanding polymer collapse and the essential polymer parameters affecting it.

Title: Ultra-Stable Weyl Topology Driven by Magnetic Textures in the Shandite Compound Co3Sn2S(2-x)Sex
Authors: Dang Khoa Le, Eklavya Thareja, Bektur Konushbaev, Gina Pantano, Tom Saunderson, Manh-Huong Phan, Yuriy Mokrousov, Jacob Gayles
Abstract: We employ state-of-the-art first-principles calculations to investigate the shandite compounds Co3Sn2S2, Co3Sn2SeS, and Co3Sn2Se2, which host Weyl fermions and complex magnetic textures. Their magnetic structures are governed primarily by exchange interactions and magnetocrystalline anisotropy, whereas the symmetry-allowed alternating-layer Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) is found to be negligible. We identify a previously unrecognized spin-chiral interaction (SCI) arising from the kagome lattice topology, which plays a decisive role in stabilizing the experimentally observed magnetic textures. The extracted magnetic parameters reproduce experimental trends, with the SCI emerging as a novel and dominant contribution. The calculated SCI strengths are 0.78 meV, 0.86 meV, and 0.87 meV for Co3Sn2S2, Co3Sn2SeS, and Co3Sn2Se2, respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrate that short-wavelength magnetic textures drive phase transitions of the Weyl nodes, resulting in band flattening and the opening of an emergent gap. This newly identified SCI, together with the associated electronically driven phase transitions, provides a promising route for manipulating transport properties in spintronic devices.

Title: Composite Bogoliubov Fermi liquid in a half-filled Chern band
Authors: Zhengyan Darius Shi, Pavel A. Nosov
Abstract: The composite Fermi liquid (CFL) in the half-filled Landau level is a cornerstone of the quantum Hall phase diagram. Recent experiments and numerics indicate that an anomalous composite Fermi liquid (ACFL) can also arise at half filling of a Chern band without any external magnetic field, opening new possibilities for paired states of composite fermions beyond the fully gapped Pfaffian phase. We argue that in inversion-asymmetric Chern bands with lattice rotational symmetry reduced to $C_3$, as realized in experimental platforms where signatures of the ACFL have been observed, composite fermions can form a superconductor with neutral gapless Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces. We term the resulting electronic state {\it the composite Bogoliubov Fermi liquid (CBFL)}. This phase has a number of remarkable properties that make it distinct from both the ACFL and the fully gapped Pfaffian. For instance, it is incompressible, has quantized Hall conductance, shows no quantum oscillations as a function of magnetic field or doping, and has topological ground state degeneracy on a torus despite the presence of gapless quasiparticles. At the same time, the neutral Bogoliubov Fermi surface yields metallic $T$-linear specific heat, non-quantized thermal conductance, Landau damping of density fluctuations, and a non-analytic $|\mathbf{q}|^3$ contribution to the equal-time structure factor $S(\mathbf{q})$. We also briefly discuss vortex physics and possible fractionalized daughter states induced by doping or external magnetic fields. Our results pave the way for a broader understanding of gapless topological phases arising from paired composite fermions in Chern bands that go beyond the conventional Landau level paradigm.

Title: Ultra-low magnetization and hysteresis loss in APC Nb3Sn superconductors
Authors: X Xu, F Wan, X Peng, M Sumption
Abstract: For the accelerator magnets of the next hadron collider, reducing superconductor persistent-current magnetization is not only important for achieving the desired field quality, but also crucial for its sustainability because the magnetization loss is the major heat load to the magnet cold mass. For conventional Nb3Sn conductors this requires reduction of effective subelement size (Deff). For the restacked-rod-process (RRP) conductors a physical subelement size (Dsub) as small as 35 um (corresponding to a Deff close to 45 um) can be reached, but at a significant price in Jc. Another way to reduce the magnetization is by introducing artificial pinning centers (APC) using the internal oxidation approach. APC conductors outperform conventional Nb3Sn wires in two aspects: 1) higher Jc at high fields, and 2) much lower Jc and magnetization at low fields (e.g., below 5 T). In this work we explored the fabricability of APC wires with small Dsub. A 180-stack APC wire was produced and drawn to 0.7- and 0.5-mm diameters with good quality, with Dsubs of 34 and 24 um (Deffs of 36 and 25 um), respectively. For the 34-um-Dsub wire, its non-Cu Jc is higher than that of an RRP wire used for the High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) project above 13 T (e.g., 36% higher at 4.2 K, 18 T), while its non-Cu magnetization at 1 T, {\Delta}M(1 T), is only 29% of the RRP wire. Its non-Cu hysteresis loss for a cycle between 1 and 14 T, Qh(1-14 T), is 37% of the RRP wire. For the 24-um-Dsub wire, its non-Cu Jc surpasses the HL-LHC RRP wire above 17.5 T, while its {\Delta}M(1 T) and Qh(1-14 T) are only 17% and 23% of the RRP wire, respectively. Its non-Cu Qh(+/-3 T) even meets the specification of the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) project.

Title: Stochastic systems with Bose-Hubbard interactions: Effects of bias on particles on a random comb
Authors: Swastik Majumder, Mustansir Barma
Abstract: We study stochastic transport of interacting particles on a disordered network described by the random comb geometry. The model is defined on a one-dimensional backbone from which branches of random lengths emanate, providing a minimal model of percolation networks beyond the critical percolation probability. The dynamics obeys local detailed balance with respect to a Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian containing both an external bias and on-site repulsion. This choice yields an analytically tractable steady state through a mapping to the zero-range-process. We compute the backbone current, branch density profiles, and macroscopic drift velocity, and analyze how bias and interactions compete to shape transport. The backbone current increases monotonically with density, while the drift velocity displays a non-monotonic dependence on the external field, remaining finite for any nonzero bias, in contrast to the vanishing drift velocity of noninteracting particles beyond a threshold bias. Density profiles along branches exhibit stepwise plateaus governed by the ratio of interaction to bias energy. These results highlight how repulsive interactions suppress trapping and restore transport in disordered geometries, bridging earlier studies of field induced drift in random networks with the physics of disordered Bose-Hubbard systems.

Title: Topological textures and emergent altermagnetic signatures in ultrathin BiFeO3

Schlom, Yimo Han, Sergei Prokhorenko, Ramamoorthy Ramesh, Paul Stevenson, Angela Wittmann, Lucas Caretta
Abstract: Magnetoelectric multiferroics, materials with intrinsically coupled electric polarization and magnetic order, promise ultralow-power switching, nonvolatile memory, and energy-efficient signal transduction. Yet practical deployment demands ultrathin films down to the atomic limit, where both orders typically degrade. Maintaining both order parameters at the thinnest scales in complex oxides remains a tremendous challenge, as uncompensated bound charge drives nanoscale depolarization in most ferroelectrics, while off-stoichiometry, reduced anisotropy, and charge transfer can produce magnetic dead layers in ultrathin oxides at substrate interfaces. Here, we realize a multiferroic phase of BiFeO3 that not only sustains both order parameters at room temperature with no dead layer but also exhibits signatures of emergent altermagnetism in the four-unit-cell, ultrathin limit. First-principles calculations, spin symmetry analysis, atomic-resolution imaging, and angle-resolved magnetic imaging reveal that short-circuit electrostatic boundary conditions, together with epitaxial strain, drive a continuous second-order, thickness-driven phase transition that enables the formation of multiferroic topological textures. Moreover, the imposed boundary conditions stabilize a d-wave altermagnetic time-reversal symmetry breaking, with corresponding signatures observed in magnetic circular dichroism. Collectively, these results establish a pathway to stabilize unconventional multiferroicity at device-relevant thicknesses, reframing scaling limits for oxide electronics.

Title: Performance of AI agents based on reasoning language models on ALD process optimization tasks
Authors: Angel Yanguas-Gil
Abstract: In this work we explore the performance and behavior of reasoning large language models to autonomously optimize atomic layer deposition (ALD) processes. In the ALD process optimization task, an agent built on top of a reasoning LLM has to find optimal dose times for an ALD precursor and a coreactant without any prior knowledge on the process, including whether it is actually self-limited. The agent is meant to interact iteratively with an ALD reactor in a fully unsupervised way. We evaluate this agent using a simple model of an ALD tool that incorporates ALD processes with different self-limited surface reaction pathways as well as a non self-limited component. Our results show that agents based on reasoning models like OpenAI's o3 and GPT5 consistently succeeded at completing this optimization task. However, we observed significant run-to-run variability due to the non deterministic nature of the model's response. In order to understand the logic followed by the reasoning model, the agent uses a two step process in which the model first generates an open response detailing the reasoning process. This response is then transformed into a structured output. An analysis of these reasoning traces showed that the logic of the model was sound and that its reasoning was based on the notions of self-limited process and saturation expected in the case of ALD. However, the agent can sometimes be misled by its own prior choices when exploring the optimization space.

Title: Weyl magnetoplasma waves in magnetic Weyl semimetals
Authors: Yuanzhao Wang, Oleg V. Kotov, Dmitry K. Efimkin
Abstract: Weyl degeneracies in spectra of magnetoplasma waves enable nonreciprocal energy flow and topologically protected modes, yet conventional materials require impractical magnetic fields to operate. Developing an effective Hamiltonian framework for magnetic Weyl semimetals, we show that these systems overcome the limit, hosting Weyl magnetoplasma physics at zero field due to their giant intrinsic anomalous Hall response. The resulting topology supports nonreciprocal modes localized at magnetic domain walls, including a pair of topological "Fermi-arc-like modes and additional bound states. These effects are fully developed across a broad THz window, and we propose feasible experimental routes for their detection.

Title: Electronic structure theory of H$_{3}$S: Plane-wave-like valence states, density-of-states peak and its guaranteed proximity to the Fermi level
Authors: Ryosuke Akashi
Abstract: Superconductivity in sulfur superhydride H$_{3}$S under extreme pressures has been explained theoretically, but it requires a peaked concentration of the electronic density of states (DOS), which has been found in first-principles calculations. The mechanism of this peak formation, though vital for its high transition temperature, has however remained obscure. We address this problem through detailed analysis of the first-principles electronic wave functions. The valence wave functions are shown to be significantly plane-wave-like. From the Fourier-mode analysis of the self-consistent potential and atomic pseudopotentials, we extract the nearly uniform models that accurately reproduce the first-principles band structure with very few parameters. The DOS peak is shown to be the consequence of the hybridization of specific plane waves. Adjacency of Jones' large zone to the plane-wave spherical Fermi surface is posited to be the root cause of the multiple plane-wave hybridization, the DOS peak formation and its proximity to the Fermi level. The present theory resolves the minimal modeling problem of electronic states in H$_{3}$S, as well as establishes a mechanism that may help to boost the transition temperatures in pressure induced superconductors.

Title: Rotational Memory Function of SPC/E water
Authors: Dilipkumar N. Asthagiri, Dmitry V. Matyushov
Abstract: Memory effects are essential for dynamics of condensed materials and are responsible for non-exponential relaxation of correlation functions of dynamic variables through the memory function. Memory functions of dipole rotations for polar liquids have never been calculated. We present here calculations of memory functions for single-dipole rotations and for the overall dipole moment of the sample for SPC/E water. The memory functions for single-particle and collective dipole dynamics turn out to be nearly identical. This result validates theories of dielectric spectroscopy in terms of single-particle time correlation functions and the connection between the collective and single-particle relaxation times through the Kirkwood factor. The dielectric function in this formalism contains no new dynamic information that does not exist in the single-dipole correlation function. A short memory time, $\lesssim 1$ fs, justifies the use of rotational diffusion model to describe dynamics of a single molecular dipole moment in bulk water.

Title: Hybrid superinductance with Al/InAs
Authors: Junseok Oh, Ido Levy, Tyler Cowan, Jacob Issokson, Archana Kamal, Javad Shabani, Andrew P. Higginbotham
Abstract: We report microwave spectroscopy of Josephson junctions chains made from an epitaxial Al/InAs heterostructure. The chains exhibit superinductance, with characteristic wave impedance exceeding $R_{Q} = \hbar/(2e)^{2}$. The planar nature of the junctions results in a large plasma frequency, with no measurable deviations from ideal dispersion up to $12~\mathrm{GHz}$. Internal quality factors decrease sharply with frequency, which we describe with a simple loss model. The possibility of a loss mechanism intrinsic to the superconductor-semiconductor junction is considered.

Title: Anomalous transport in quasiperiodic lattices: emergent exceptional points at band edges and log-periodic oscillations
Authors: Jinyuan Shang, Haiping Hu
Abstract: Quasiperiodic systems host exotic transport regimes that are distinct from those found in periodic or disordered lattices. In this work, we study quantum transport in the Aubry-André-Harper lattice in a two-terminal setup coupled to zero-temperature reservoirs, where the conductance is evaluated via the nonequilibrium Green's function method. In the extended phase, we uncover a universal subdiffusive transport when the bath chemical potential aligns with the band edges. Specifically, the typical conductance displays a scaling of $\mathcal{G}_{\text{typ}}\sim L^{-2}$ with system size $L$. We attribute this behavior to the emergence of an exceptional point (Jordan normal form) in the transfer matrix in the thermodynamic limit. In the localized phase, the conductance shows exponential decay governed by the Lyapunov exponent. Intriguingly, in the critical phase, we identify pronounced log-periodic oscillations of the conductance as a function of system size, arising from the discrete scale invariance inherent to the singular-continuous spectrum. We further extend our analysis to the generalized Aubry-André-Harper model and provide numerical evidence suggesting that the exact mobility edge resides within a finite spectral gap. This results in a counter-intuitive exponential suppression of conductance precisely at the mobility edge. Our work highlights the distinct transport behaviors in quasiperiodic systems and elucidates how they are rigorously dictated by the underlying local spectral structure.

Title: Electroluminescence in dopant-free GaAs/AlGaAs single heterojunctions: 2D free excitons, H-band, and the tidal effect
Authors: N. Sherlekar, S. R. Harrigan, L. Tian, B. Cunard, Y. Qi, B. Khromets, M. C. Tam, H. S. Kim, Z. R. Wasilewski, J. Baugh, M. E. Reimer, F. Sfigakis
Abstract: Bright electroluminescence (EL) from dopant-free ambipolar lateral p-n junctions in GaAs/AlGaAs single heterointerface (SH) heterostructures is used to probe neutral free excitons arising from two-dimensional electron and hole gases (2DEGs and 2DHGs). The EL spectra reveal both the heavy-hole neutral free exciton (X$^0$) and the high-energy free exciton of the H band (HE). A combination of transition energies, lifetimes, spatial emission profiles, and temperature dependences points to a predominantly two-dimensional character for these excitons at the SH. For X$^0$, the EL peak energies (1515.5-1515.7 meV) lie slightly above the corresponding bulk GaAs photoluminescence (PL) line at 1515.3 meV, while time-resolved measurements yield markedly shorter lifetimes for EL than for PL (337 ps vs. 1610 ps), consistent with recombination in a confined interfacial layer. The HE exciton exhibits a Stark blueshift under forward bias below threshold, and its energies and lifetimes (down to 575 ps) are tuned by the topgate voltage; above threshold, HE emission is quenched in favor of X$^0$. Finally, the tidal effect $-$ a form of pulsed EL generated by swapping the topgate voltage polarity in ambipolar field-effect transistors $-$ produces an X$^0$ line at the same energy as in the lateral p-n junction and reproduces the characteristic nonmonotonic frequency dependence of the brightness previously observed in quantum-well heterostructures, again indicating a 2D-like origin. Taken together, these results show electrically generated and controllable 2D-like excitons (HE and X$^0$), thereby bridging 2D exciton physics and 2DEG/2DHG platforms in dopant-free GaAs/AlGaAs SH devices.

Title: Density of States of Ru3 and Pt3 Clusters Supported on Sputter-Deposited TiO2
Authors: Liam Howard-Fabretto, Timothy J. Gorey, Guangjing Li, Siriluck Tesana, Gregory F. Metha, Scott L. Anderson, Gunther G. Andersson
Abstract: In this work, 3-atom clusters, Ru3 and Pt3, were deposited onto radio frequency RF-sputter deposited TiO2, treated with Ar+ ion sputtering. Ru3 was deposited by both solution submersion and chemical vapor deposition of Ru3(CO)12, while Pt3 was deposited under ultra-high vacuum using a laser vaporisation cluster source. The valence electronic density of states (DOS) of the deposited clusters were analysed after heat treatment using ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and metastable impact electron spectroscopy (MIES), where UPS measures the top several layers while MIES measures only the top atomic layer. XPS was used to determine the cluster surface coverages. The DOS were found to be very similar between Ru3 deposited by solution submersion and chemical vapor deposition. MIES results for Ru3 had contributions from titania O 2p sites due to encapsulation by a reduced titania overlayer. For Pt3 clusters the UPS and MIES results provided evidence that Pt was present on the topmost layer, and encapsulation did not occur. The proposed reason for the encapsulation of Ru3 but not of Pt3 is the higher surface energy of Ru over Pt. It is concluded that Pt clusters deposited onto TiO2 can modify the outermost layer by adding discrete energy levels on the surface, whereas the Ru clusters being encapsulated just below the surface generate a broad distribution of energy states close to the Fermi level. The outcome of this work is that Pt3-cluster-modified surfaces could be used as catalysts for reactions where the Pt3 energy levels are suitable for the respective reaction. The implication of the DOS found for photocatalytic water splitting are discussed.

Title: Comparison of SCAN+U and r2SCAN+U for Charge Density Wave Instability and Lattice Dynamics in CuTe
Authors: Seungha Ju, Sooran Kim
Abstract: Identifying an appropriate exchange-correlation functional and computational conditions is essential for explaining the fundamental physics of materials and predicting their properties. Here, we investigate the performance of the meta-GGA functionals SCAN and r2SCAN, with and without a Hubbard U, for describing the charge density wave (CDW) in the quasi-one-dimensional material CuTe. By examining the Te-Te bond modulation, phonon dispersions, and electronic structures, we identify clear differences in how the two functionals capture the structural and dynamical properties of the CDW formation. r2SCAN+U reproduces the experimentally observed Te-chain distortions in the CDW phase and the phonon soft mode at qCDW=(0.4, 0.0, 0.5) in the non-CDW phase, whereas SCAN exhibits unphysical phonon behavior. The atomic displacements of the soft mode agree well with the experimental Te modulation. Despite their similar electronic structures and optimized lattice constants, our results demonstrate that r2SCAN is a more suitable choice than SCAN for describing CDW formation and lattice dynamics in CuTe.

Title: Microwave Kerr/Faraday Resonance in Two-dimensional Chiral Superconductors
Authors: Taiki Matsushita, Jun'ichi Ieda, Yasufumi Araki, Takahiro Morimoto, Ilya Vekhter, Youichi Yanase
Abstract: We investigate the polar Kerr and Faraday effects in two-dimensional multiband chiral superconductors. We show that the clapping modes--the relative phase and amplitude oscillations between two chiral components of the superconducting order parameter--lie well within the quasiparticle excitation gap in multiband systems and dominate these magneto-optical responses in the microwave regime. The Kerr and Faraday rotation angles exhibit the resonant enhancement with sign reversals in the microwave regime as a function of the light frequency, reaching peak values on the order of 100 nrad--10 $\mu$rad in thin films of candidate chiral superconductors. These resonances are accessible in superconducting atomic layer materials and provide a generic probe of chiral superconductivity in two-dimensional systems.

Title: Electric field effects in one-dimensional spin-1/2 $K_1J_1Γ_1Γ_1^\prime K_2J_2$ model with ferromagnetic Kitaev coupling
Authors: Wang Yang, Helin Wang, Chao Xu
Abstract: We perform a systematic study on the effects of electric fields in the Luttinger liquid phase of the one-dimensional spin-$1/2$ $K_1J_1\Gamma_1\Gamma_1^\prime K_2J_2$ model in the region of ferromagnetic nearest-neighboring Kitaev coupling. We find that while electric fields along $(1,1,1)$-direction maintain the Luttinger liquid behavior, fields along other directions drive the system to a dimerized state. An estimation is made on how effective a $(1,1,1)$-field is for tuning the Luttinger parameter in real materials. Our work is useful for understanding the effects of electric fields in one-dimensional generalized Kitaev spin models, and provides a starting point for exploring the electric-field-related physics in two dimensions based on a quasi-one-dimensional approach.

Title: A Neuroevolution Potential for Gallium Oxide: Accurate and Efficient Modeling of Polymorphism and Swift Heavy-Ion Irradiation
Authors: Yaohui Gu, Binbo Li, Lingyang Jiang, Yuhui Hu, Wenqiang Liu, Lijun Xu, Pengfei Zhai, Jie Liu, Jinglai Duan
Abstract: Gallium oxide (Ga2O3) is a wide-bandgap semiconductor with promising applications in high-power and high-frequency electronics. However, its complex polymorphic nature poses substantial challenges for fundamental studies, particularly in understanding phase-transformation behaviors under nonequilibrium conditions. Here, we develop a robust, accurate, and computationally efficient machine-learning interatomic potential (MLIP) for Ga2O3 based on the neuroevolution potential (NEP) framework combined with an energy-dependent weighting strategy. The resulting NEP potential demonstrates clear advantages over the state-of-the-art tabGAP potential with respect to both accuracy and computational efficiency. Furthermore, we introduce a physically process-oriented sampling strategy to systematically augment the training dataset, thereby enhancing the MLIP performance for targeted physical phenomena. As a representative application, a dedicated NEP potential is constructed for swift heavy-ion (SHI) irradiation simulations of \b{eta}-Ga2O3. The simulated results are in quantitative agreement with experimental observations and provide a consistent physical explanation for the reported experimental discrepancies regarding phase transformations in the ion track of \b{eta}-Ga2O3.

Title: Effect of Number of Bilayers on the Anomalous Hall Effect in [Si/Fe]N Multilayers
Authors: Sudhansu Sekhar Das, M. Senthil Kumar
Abstract: The influence of varying the number of bilayers (N) on the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in sputtered Si/Fe multilayers has been investigated. Both the AHE and magnetisation data reveal the in-plane magnetic anisotropy in the samples. Large enhancement of about 24 times in the saturation anomalous Hall resistance (R_Ahs) and anomalous Hall sensitivity (S) has been observed upon decreasing N from 20 to 1. When compared with the bulk Fe, the values of R_Ahs and anomalous Hall coefficient, Rs obtained for N= 1 were enhanced by about 5 and 3 orders of magnitude, respectively. The Rs follows the longitudinal electrical resistivity Rho as Rs proportional to Rho^2.1, suggesting side jump as the dominant mechanism of the AHE. The S as high as 22 Ohm/T over a wide operational field range of -8 to +8 kOe has been obtained for N = 1.

Title: Classification and design of two-dimensional altermagnets
Authors: Sike Zeng, Dong Liu, Hongjie Peng, Chang-Chun He, Xiao-Bao Yang, Yu-Jun Zhao
Abstract: Altermagnets -- newly identified collinear antiferromagnets -- carry zero net moment with non-relativistic, spin-polarized bands, distilling the best of ferromagnets and antiferromagnets into a single spintronic platform. Shrunking to the two-dimensional limit, they inherit the tunability of two-dimensional crystals while adding symmetry-protected spin splitting, a combination now driving intense experimental interest. Here, we review the symmetry classification of two-dimensional altermagnets based on spin-group theory and survey the growing list of candidate materials, emphasizing those with large spin splitting for experimental realization. We then examine strategies for engineering two-dimensional altermagnetism. This Review aims to consolidate theoretically proposed candidate materials and realization strategies for two-dimensional altermagnets, providing insights for future experimental efforts in this emerging field.

Title: Comprehensive Molecular-level Understanding of MgO Hydration through Computational Chemistry
Authors: Taichi Inagaki, Miho Hatanaka
Abstract: The hydration of magnesium oxide (MgO) to magnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH)$_2$) is a fundamental solid-surface chemical reaction with significant implications for materials science. Yet its molecular-level mechanism from water adsorption to Mg(OH)$_2$ nucleation and growth remains elusive due to its complex and multi-step nature. Here, we elucidate the molecular process of MgO hydration based on structures of the MgO/water interface obtained by a combined computational chemistry approach of potential-scaling molecular dynamics simulations and first-principles calculations without any a priori assumptions about reaction pathways. The result shows that the Mg$^{2+}$ dissolution follows the dissociative water adsorption. We find that this initial dissolution can proceed exothermically even from the defect-free surface with an average activation barrier of $\sim$12 kcal/mol. This exothermicity depends crucially on the stabilization of the resulting surface vacancy, achieved by proton adsorption onto neighboring surface oxygen atoms. Further Mg$^{2+}$ dissolution then occurs in correlation with proton penetration into the solid. Moreover, we find that the Mg(OH)$_2$ nucleation and growth proceeds according to the dissolution-precipitation mechanism, rather than a solid-state reaction mechanism involving a direct topotactic transformation. In this process, Mg$^{2+}$ ions migrate away from the surface and form amorphous Mg-OH chains as precursors for Mg(OH)$_2$ nucleation. We also demonstrate that sufficient water facilitates the formation of more ordered crystalline nuclei. This computational study provides a comprehensive molecular-level understanding of MgO hydration, representing a foundational step toward elucidating the mechanisms of this class of complex and multi-step solid-surface chemical reactions.

Title: Growth and hydrostatic-pressure study of a type-II superconductor Bi$_2$Ta$_3$S$_6$ single crystal
Authors: Li Chenglin, Yang Yaling, Yang Zhilong, Deng Junze, Zhang Ruihan, Chen Weiwei, Pan Yue, Wang Yulong, Wang Xuhui, Wang Bosen, Wang Zhijun, Wang Gang
Abstract: We report the growth and physical properties of single-crystalline Bi$_2$Ta$_3$S$_6$ crystallizing in $P6_3/mcm$ space group, which comprises alternating Ta-S layers and Bi layers with each Bi atom connected with adjacent S atoms. Temperature-dependent electrical resistivity measurements reveal a superconducting transition at 0.84 K, with upper critical field 231 Oe under an out-of-plane magnetic field. The magnetization measurements confirm its nature as a type-II superconductor, with anisotropic Ginzburg-Landau parameter $\kappa_{ab}$ = 7.67 and $\kappa_c$ = 4.50. Hall measurements indicate the dominant carriers as hole. Hydrostatic pressure is applied, under which both the superconducting transition temperature and upper critical field increase sharply under low pressure before undergoing slight suppression under higher pressure. Density functional theory calculations reveal non-trivial topological surface states on (100) surface in Bi$_2$Ta$_3$S$_6$, which may offer a new avenue for exploring potential topological superconductivity in layered transition metal dichalcogenides.

Title: Physically Unclonable Functions Based on Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes: A Scalable and Inexpensive Method toward Unique Identifiers
Authors: Enrique Burzurí, Daniel Granados, Emilio M. Pérez
Abstract: A physically un-clonable function (PUF) is a physical system that cannot be reproduced or predicted and therefore is a good basis to build security and anti-counterfeiting applications. The unclonability of PUFs typically stems from the randmoness induced in a system during sophisticated fabrication methods. It is precisely this built-in complexity the bottleneck hindering scalability and increasing costs. Here, we produce in a simple manner PUFs based on arrays of carbon nanotubes junctions simultaneously assembled by dielectrophoresis. We demonstrate that the intrinsic inhomogeneity of carbon nanotubes at the nanoscale, combined with the unpredictability introduced by liquid phase-based fabrication methods results in unique electronic profiles of easily scalable devices. This approach could be extrapolated to generate PUFs based on other nanoscale materials

Title: Random matrix theory universality of current operators in spin-$S$ Heisenberg chains
Authors: Mariel Kempa, Markus Kraft, Robin Steinigeweg, Jochen Gemmer, Jiaozi Wang
Abstract: Quantum chaotic systems exhibit certain universal statistical properties that closely resemble predictions from random matrix theory (RMT). With respect to observables, it has recently been conjectured that, when truncated to a sufficiently narrow energy window, their statistical properties can be described by an unitarily invariant ensemble, and testable criteria have been introduced, which are based on the scaling behavior of free cumulants. In this paper, we investigate the conjecture numerically in translationally invariant Heisenberg spin chains with spin quantum number $S =\frac{1}{2},1,\frac{3}{2}$. Combining a quantum-typicality-based numerical method with the exploitation of the system's symmetries, we study the spin current operator and find clear evidence of consistency with the proposed criteria in chaotic cases. Our findings further support the conjecture of the existence of RMT universality as manifest in the observable properties in quantum chaotic systems.

Title: Integral Variable Range Hopping for Modeling Electrical Transport in Disordered Systems
Authors: Chenxin Qin, Chenyan Wang, Mouyang Cheng, Ji Chen
Abstract: The variable range hopping (VRH) model has been widely applied to describe electrical transport in disordered systems, providing theoretical formulas to fit temperature-dependent electric conductivity. These models rely on oversimplified assumptions that restrict their applicability and result in problematic fitting behaviors, yet their overusing situation is becoming increasingly serious. In this work we formulate an integral variable range hopping (IVRH) model, which replaces the empirical temperature power-law dependence in standard VRH theories with a physics-inspired integral formulation. The model builds upon the standard hopping probability $\omega(R)$ w.r.t. hopping distance $R$ and incorporates the density of accessible electronic states through an effective volume function $V(R)$, which reflects the influence of system geometry. The IVRH formulation inherently reproduces both the Mott behavior at low temperatures and the Arrhenius behavior at high temperatures, respectively, and enables a smooth transition between the two regimes. We apply the IVRH model to two-dimensional, three-dimensional, and multi-layered systems. Monte Carlo simulations validate the model's predictions and yield consistent values for the fitting parameters, with substantially reduced variances compared to fitting using the standard VRH model. Furthermore, the improved robustness of IVRH also extends to the transport measurements in monolayer MoS$_2$ system and monolayer WS$_2$ system, enabling more physically meaningful this http URL model offers a more stable and physically sound framework for interpreting hopping transport in low-dimensional amorphous materials, providing deeper insights into the universal geometric scaling factors that govern charge transport in disordered systems.

Title: Quantum Monte Carlo study of systems interacting via long-range interactions mediated by a cavity
Authors: Marta Domínguez-Navarro, Abel Rojo-Francàs, Bruno Juliá-Díaz, Grigori E. Astrakharchik
Abstract: We study one-dimensional quantum gases in continuous space with cavity-mediated infinite-range interactions using variational and diffusion Monte Carlo methods. Starting from the exact two-body solution, we construct a non-translationally invariant Jastrow wavefunction that accurately captures the spatial structure induced by the cavity field and provides an efficient many-body ansatz for both bosonic and fermionic systems. We analize properties of three characteristic quantum systems, subject to long-range interactions: (i) ideal Bose gas (ii) interacting Bose gas (iii) ideal Fermi gas. In the absence of short-range interactions, we identify a crossover from a stable, weakly modulated phase realized for repulsive interactions to a delocalized bound state for attractive interactions, marked by clustering, loss of superfluidity, and the absence of a thermodynamic limit. Introducing short-range repulsion, either through contact interactions or fermionic statistics, leads to the formation of a mesoscopic gas-like regime that disappears in the thermodynamic limit. A qualitative phase diagram is proposed to illustrate the combined effects of short- and long-range interactions, highlighting the emergence of distinct regimes with characteristic structural properties.

Title: Computer Generation of Disordered Networks with Targeted Structural Properties
Authors: Florin Hemmann, Vincent Glauser, Ullrich Steiner, Matthias Saba
Abstract: Disordered spatial networks are model systems that describe structures and interactions across multiple length scales. Scattering and interference of waves in these networks can give rise to structural phase transitions, localization, diffusion, and band gaps. The study of these complex phenomena requires efficient numerical methods to computer-generate disordered networks with targeted structural properties. In the established Wooten-Weaire-Winer algorithm, a series of bond switch moves introduces disorder into an initial network. Conventional strain energies that govern this evolution are limited to 3D networks with coordination numbers of no more than four. We extend the algorithm to arbitrary coordination number statistics by introducing bond repulsion in the Keating strain energy. We tune the degree and type of disorder introduced into initially crystalline networks by varying the bond-bending force constant in the strain energy and the temperature profile. The effects of these variables are analyzed using a list of order metrics that capture both direct and reciprocal space. A feedforward neural network is trained to predict the structural characteristics from the algorithm inputs, enabling targeted network generation. As a case study, we statistically reproduce four disordered biophotonic networks exhibiting structural color. This work presents a versatile method for generating disordered networks with tailored structural properties. It will enable new insights into structure-property relations, such as photonic band gaps in disordered networks.

Title: Enhanced multi-parameter metrology in dissipative Rydberg atom time crystals
Authors: Bang Liu, Jun-Rong Chen, Yu Ma, Qi-Feng Wang, Tian-Yu Han, Hao Tian, Yu-Hua Qian, Guang-Can Guo, Li-Hua Zhang, Bin-Bin Wei, Abolfazl Bayat, Dong-Sheng Ding, Bao-Sen Shi
Abstract: The pursuit of unprecedented sensitivity in quantum enhanced metrology has spurred interest in non-equilibrium quantum phases of matter and their symmetry breaking. In particular, criticality-enhanced metrology through time-translation symmetry breaking in many-body systems, a distinct paradigm compared to spatial symmetry breaking, is a field still in its infancy. Here, we have investigated the enhanced sensing at the boundary of a continuous time-crystal (CTC) phase in a driven Rydberg atomic gas. By mapping the full phase diagram, we identify the parameter-dependent phase boundary where the time-translation symmetry is broken. This allows us to use a single setup for measuring multiple parameters, in particular frequency and amplitude of a microwave field. By increasing the microwave field amplitude, we first observe a phase transition from a thermal phase to a CTC phase, followed by a second transition into a distinct CTC state, characterized by a different oscillation frequency. Furthermore, we reveal the precise relationship between the CTC phase boundary and the scanning rate, displaying enhanced precision beyond the Standard Quantum Limit. This work not only provides a promising paradigm rooted in the critical properties of time crystals, but also advances a method for multi-parameter sensing in non-equilibrium quantum phases.

Title: Capillary Slinky: Equilibrium and Dynamics of Droplets in a Soft Spring
Authors: Bidisha Bhatt, Andreas Carlson
Abstract: Springs can be found in many applications and biological systems, and when these are soft, they easily deform. At small scales, capillarity can induce a force leading to spring deformations when the elastocapillary number is small. We demonstrate through experiments the non-trivial equilibrium shape liquid droplets adopt in these soft springs, which form an annulus, Eruciform, and spherical shapes. When these droplets are set in motion, they display different flow regimes with significant dissipation generated by the internal rotational flow. The static and dynamics of droplets in such a capillary slinky is also used to demonstrate how surface tension can actuate springs by stretching/compression, while providing a way for active flow control in soft springs.

Title: Topology-Directed Silicide Formation: An Explanation for the Growth of C49-TiSi$_2$ on the Si(100) Surface
Authors: Lukas Hückmann, Jonathon Cottom, Jörg Meyer, Emilia Olsson
Abstract: Designing metal-semiconductor junctions is essential for optimizing the performance of modern nanoelectronic devices. A widely used material is TiSi$_2$, which combines low electronic resistivity with good endurance. However, its multitude of polymorphs continues to pose a challenge for device fabrication. In particular, the naturally occurring formation of the metastable C49-TiSi$_2$ modification remains poorly understood and is problematic due to its unfavorable electronic properties. Based on extensive DFT calculations, we present a comprehensive model of Ti adsorption on Si(100) that highlights the pivotal role of surface topology for the initial stages of the interfacial TiSi$_2$ formation process. We show that the interplay between Si surface dimers, the symmetry of the Si(100) surface, and the incorporation of Ti adsorbates below the surface drives an adsorption pattern that yields a nucleation template for the C49-TiSi$_2$ phase. Our atomistic model rationalizes experimental observations like the Stranski-Krastanov growth mode, the preferential formation of C49-TiSi$_2$ despite it being less favorable than the competing C54 phase, and why disruption of the surface structure restores thermodynamically driven growth of the latter. Ultimately, this novel perspective on the unique growth of TiSi$_2$ will help to pave the way for next-generation electronic devices.

Title: Advanced Manufacturing with Renewable and Bio-based Materials: AI/ML workflows and Process Optimization
Authors: Rigoberto Advincula, Jihua Chen
Abstract: Advanced manufacturing with new bio-derived materials can be achieved faster and more economically with first-principle-based artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML)-derived models and process optimization. Not only is this motivated by increased industry profitability, but it can also be optimized to reduce waste generation, energy consumption, and gas emissions through additive manufacturing (AM) and AI/ML-directed self-driving laboratory (SDL) process optimization. From this perspective, the benefits of using 3D printing technology to manufacture durable, sustainable materials will enable high-value reuse and promote a better circular economy. Using AI/ML workflows at different levels, it is possible to optimize the synthesis and adaptation of new bio-derived materials with self-correcting 3D printing methods, and in-situ characterization. Working with training data and hypotheses derived from Large Language Models (LLMs) and algorithms, including ML-optimized simulation, it is possible to demonstrate more field convergence. The combination of SDL and AI/ML Workflows can be the norm for improved use of biobased and renewable materials towards advanced manufacturing. This should result in faster and better structure, composition, processing, and properties (SCPP) correlation. More agentic AI tasks, as well as supervised or unsupervised learning, can be incorporated to improve optimization protocols continuously. Deep Learning (DL), Reinforcement Learning (RL), and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) with Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) can be applied to more generative AI directions in both AM and SDL, with bio-based materials.

Title: Basal-plane anisotropy of field-induced multipolar order in tetragonal CeRh$_2$As$_2$
Authors: Konstantin Semeniuk, Burkhard Schmidt, Christophe Marcenat, Meike Pfeiffer, Albin Demuer, Lipsa Behera, Thierry Klein, Seunghyun Khim, Elena Hassinger
Abstract: Unconventional superconductivity in Ce-based Kondo-lattice materials emerges almost exclusively in the vicinity of weak dipolar magnetic orders, while higher multipolar orders are only known to occur in a few Pr-based unconventional superconductors and possibly URu$_2$Si$_2$. The multiphase superconductor CeRh$_2$As$_2$ appears to be a notable exception from this trend. Showing clear signatures of magnetism, this tetragonal system is suspected to host a concomitant quadrupolar order, which could be causing the strong enhancement of the ordering temperature when a magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the fourfold ($c$) axis of the lattice. In this work, we show that the field-temperature phase diagram of CeRh$_2$As$_2$ has a remarkable basal-plane anisotropy. This finding supports the scenario of coupled magnetic and multipolar ordering, which may have implications for the pairing mechanism of the superconductivity, and guides the development of the next iteration of theoretical models.

Title: Cloud parameter estimation for interacting BEC after time-of-flight
Authors: Rasmus Malthe Fiil Andersen, Stine Frederiksen, Laurits Stockholm, Ilja Zebergs, Mick Kristensen, Carrie Weidner, Jan Joachim Arlt
Abstract: Experiments on Bose-Einstein condensates at finite temperature typically extract the system parameters, such as temperature, atom number, and condensed fraction from time-of-flight images taken after a free expansion time. This paper systematically examines the effect of repulsive interactions between the condensed and thermal atoms in partially condensed clouds on the expansion profile of the thermal cloud. An analytical expression for the expansion can be obtained only if the interactions between the Bose-Einstein condensate and thermal atoms are neglected, resulting in a Bose-enhanced distribution for the thermal component. Here, the deformation of the cloud due to interactions and the effects on estimated parameters are investigated by simulating the expansion using a ballistic approximation. By fitting the simulated expansion profiles with a Bose-enhanced distribution, the errors of using such a fit are estimated, and the results are explained phenomenologically. The simulation was also used as a fitting function for experimental data, showing better agreement of the extracted condensed fraction with the semi-ideal model than results from a Bose-enhanced fit.

Title: The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of finite-rank normal perturbations of large rotationally invariant non-Hermitian matrices
Authors: Pierre Bousseyroux, Marc Potters
Abstract: We study finite-rank normal deformations of rotationally invariant non-Hermitian random matrices. Extending the classical Baik-Ben Arous-Péché (BBP) framework, we characterize the emergence and fluctuations of outlier eigenvalues in models of the form $\mathbf{A} + \mathbf{T}$, where $\mathbf{A}$ is a large rotationally invariant non-Hermitian random matrix and $\mathbf{T}$ is a finite-rank normal perturbation. We also describe the corresponding eigenvector behavior. Our results provide a unified framework encompassing both Hermitian and non-Hermitian settings, thereby generalizing several known cases.

Title: Spinodal decomposition in filled polymer blends exhibiting upper critical solution temperature behavior
Authors: A.I. Chervanyov
Abstract: By extending the Sanchez-Lacombe lattice-fluid model for mixtures to the case of polymer blends containing solid fillers, we calculate the excess thermodynamic quantities arising from the presence of fillers. These results are then used to derive the spinodal stability condition of a filled polymer blend. In the low-compressibility limit, this condition reduces to a remarkably simple analytical expression that is derived self-consistently within the present framework. Comparison between the exact and approximate spinodal curves shows excellent agreement, with deviations in the spinodal temperature of less than 4 K, thereby validating the proposed approximation. The obtained analytical approximation enables a straightforward evaluation of the spinodal temperature without the extensive numerical calculations required to determine the exact spinodal condition. Both the exact and approximate spinodal conditions yield good quantitative agreement with experimental data for filled and unfilled blends.

Title: The transformation mechanisms among cuboctahedra, Ino's decahedra and icosahedra structures of magic-size gold nanoclusters
Authors: Ehsan Rahmatizad Khajehpasha, Mohammad Ismaeil Safa, Nasrin Eyvazi, Marco Krummenacher, Stefan Goedecker
Abstract: Gold nanoclusters possess multiple competing structural motifs with small energy differences, enabling structural coexistence and interconversion. Using a high-accuracy machine learned potential trained on some 20'000 density functional theory reference data points, we investigate transformation pathways connecting both high-symmetry and amorphous cuboctahedra, Ino's decahedra and icosahedra for Au55, Au147, Au309 and Au561 nanoclusters. Our saddle point searches reveal that high-symmetry transformations from cuboctahedra and Ino's decahedra to icosahedra proceed through a single barrier and represent soft-mode-driven jitterbug-type and slip-dislocation motions. In addition, we identify lower-barrier asymmetric transformation pathways that drive the system into disordered, Jahn-Teller-stabilized amorphous icosahedra. Minima Hopping sampling further uncovers, in this context, many such low-symmetry minima. Some of the newly identified global minima for Au309 and Au561 have energies that are up to 2.8 eV lower than the previously reported global minima. Hence, both the shapes and the transformation pathways studied in previous investigations are not the physically relevant ones. In contrast to the previously studied pathways, our transformation pathways give reasonable transformation times that are in rough agreement with experiments.

Title: Quantum Theory and Unusual Dielectric Functions of Graphene
Authors: V. M. Mostepanenko, G. L. Klimchitskaya
Abstract: We address the spatially nonlocal dielectric functions of graphene at any frequency derived starting fromthe first principles of thermal quantum field theory using the formalism of the polarization tensor. After a brief review of this formalism, the longitudinal and transverse dielectric functions are considered at any relationship between the frequency and the wave vector. The analytic properties of their real and imaginary parts are investigated at low and high frequencies. Emphasis is given to the double pole at zero frequency which arises in the transverse dielectric function. The role of this unusual property for solving the problem of disagreement between experiment and theory in the Casimir effect is discussed. We guess that a more complete dielectric response of ordinary metals should also be spatially nonlocal and its transverse part may possess the double pole in the region of evanescent waves.

Title: Effects of Integrated Heatsinking on Superconductivity in Tantalum Nitride Nanowires at the 300 Millimeter Scale
Authors: Ekta Bhatia, Tharanga R. Nanayakkara, Chenyu Zhou, Tuan Vo, Wenli Collison, Jakub Nalaskowski, Stephen Olson, Soumen Kar, Hunter Frost, John Mucci, Brian Martinick, Ilyssa Wells, Thomas Murray, Corbet Johnson, Charles T Black, Mingzhao Liu, Satyavolu S Papa Rao
Abstract: We report the superconducting properties of tantalum nitride (TaN) nanowires and TaN/copper (TaN/Cu) bilayer nanowires fabricated on 300 mm silicon wafers using CMOS-compatible processes. We evaluate how an integrated Cu heatsink modifies the superconducting response of TaN nanowires by improving thermal dissipation without significantly compromising key superconducting parameters. Through analysis of hysteresis in current-voltage curves, we demonstrate that Cu integration improves heat dissipation, supporting expectations of faster reset times in superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs), consistent with enhanced heat transfer away from the hot spot. Using the Skocpol-Beasley-Tinkham (SBT) hotspot model, we quantify the Cu-enabled improvement in heat transfer as an approximately 100x increase in the SBT slope parameter beta and effective interfacial heat-transfer efficiency compared to TaN nanowires. The near-unity ratio of critical to retrapping current in TaN/Cu bilayer nanowires provides another evidence of efficient heat removal enabled by the integrated Cu layer. Our results show a zero-temperature Ginzburg-Landau coherence length of 7 nm and a critical temperature of 4.1 K for 39 nm thick TaN nanowires. The nanowires show <5% variation in critical dimensions, room-temperature resistance, residual resistance ratio, critical temperature, and critical current across the 300 mm wafer for all measured linewidths, demonstrating excellent process uniformity and scalability. These results indicate the trade-offs between superconducting performance and heat-sinking efficiency in TaN/Cu bilayer nanowires. They also underscore the viability of wafer-scale fabrication for fast, large-area SNSPD arrays for applications in photonic quantum computing, cosmology, and neuromorphic computing devices.

Title: Magnetic field-induced phases in a model S=1 Haldane chain system
Authors: I. Jakovac, M. S. Grbić, M. Dupont, N. Laflorencie, S. Capponi, Y. Hosokoshi, S. Krämer, Y. Skourski, S. Luther M. Takigawa, M. Horvatić
Abstract: An $S=1$ Haldane chain is a one-dimensional (1D) quantum magnet where strong fluctuations result in quantum disordered singlet ground state with a gapped excitation spectrum. The gap magnitude is primarily set by the dominant intrachain interaction ($J_\text{1D}$). An applied magnetic field closes the gap at $B_\text{c1}$ and drives the system into a gapless Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) regime, followed by, at lower temperatures, a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) ground state, persisting up to $B_\text{c2} \propto 4 J_\text{1D}/g\mu_B$. Almost all previously studied experimental realizations of such systems were based on transition-metal complexes which typically suffer from intrinsic anisotropies or large $J_\text{1D}$ values, limiting the access to the full theoretical phase diagram. We report a comprehensive study of TLL and BEC phases in the organic Haldane chain system 3,5-bis(N-tert-butylaminoxyl)-3'-nitrobiphenyl (BoNO). The absence of anisotropy and a moderate $J_\text{1D}$ enable exploration of the complete $B-T$ phase diagram. Through $^1$H nuclear magnetic resonance, combined with theoretical analysis, we characterize the TLL properties, map the BEC phase boundary $T_c (B)$, determine the associated critical exponent $\nu \approx 0.66$ at $B_\text{c2}$, and demonstrate universal quasiparticle scaling in the quantum-critical regime. These results provide full experimental validation of theoretical predictions for field-induced phases in an $S=1$ Haldane chain, made over two decades ago.

Title: Plasmon dynamics in graphene

Abstract: Plasmons are collective oscillations of mobile electrons. Using terahertz spacetime metrology, we probe plasmon dynamics of mono- and bi-layer graphene. In both systems, the experimentally measured Drude weight systematically exceeds the prediction based on non-interacting electronic system. This enhancement is most pronounced at ultra-low carrier densities. We attribute the observed deviation to pseudospin dynamics of the Dirac fermions in multi-layer graphene, which leads to a breakdown of Galilean invariance. Our results establish that pseudospin structure of the single-particle electronic wave function can directly govern collective excitations, with implications that extend beyond graphene to a broad class of quantum materials.

Title: Growth and Morphology of InN Nanowires on Si<111> and Si<100> at Back-End-Of-Line Compatible Temperatures
Authors: Andrea Orlando-cunnac, Arthur Arnaud, Martien Den Hertog, Ettore Coccato, Vincent Calvo, Jonathan Steckel, Eva Monroy
Abstract: InN nanowires were grown on Si<111> and Si<100> substrates by plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy using a thin AlN buffer layer at temperatures compatible with the thermal budget limitation imposed by Back-End-Of-Line processing. Reflection high-energy electron diffraction reveals different nucleation behaviors on the two substrate orientations, with higher structural disorder in the case of Si<100>. However, vertically aligned nanowires with hexagonal cross section and N polarity are obtained on both substrates. A statistical analysis of nanowire morphology as a function of growth temperature indicates similar trends in diameter, density, and length on Si<111> and Si<100>, which are explained by adatom kinetics during growth. Nanowires on Si<100> exhibit improved uniformity and reduced tapering, attributed to the different nanowire nucleation due to microstructural properties of the AlN buffer layer. The results demonstrate the feasibility of growing high-quality InN nanowires on Si<100>, supporting their potential for monolithic integration of nanowire-based photodetectors on silicon.

Abstract: While current technology has enabled their widespread use, further improvements are needed for stationary, portable, and mobile applications, for example by the development of novel cathode materials. Digitalization of battery development, combining both experimental and modelling efforts is extremely valuable in this development. This is addressed in the present paper, where the authors present a comprehensive dataset for a graphite/LNMO 1 Ah pouch cell, including material, design, and electrochemical data. The dataset, validated through the BattMo modelling framework, supports physical modelling and aims to benefit the battery modelling community by offering a comprehensive resource for future studies. Both the dataset and the accompanying software for numerical validation is openly available and processed in such a way that it can serve as blueprint for reporting of comparable research data.

Title: Incipient modulated phase in Sr$_{1-x}$Ca$_{x}$TiO$_3$
Authors: Benoît Fauqué, Daniel A. Chaney, Philippe Bourges, Stéphane Raymond, Arno Hiess, Paul Steffens, Benoît Baptiste, Luigi Paolasini, Alexeï Bosak, Kamran Behnia, Yasuhide Tomioka
Abstract: Nanometer-scale modulations can spontaneously emerge in complex materials when multiple degrees of freedom interact. Here we demonstrate that ferroelectric Sr$_{1-x}$Ca$_x$TiO$_3$ lies in close proximity to an incipient structurally modulated phase. Using inelastic neutron and X-ray scattering, we show that upon cooling, dipolar fluctuations strongly couple to and soften the $c_{44}$ transverse acoustic mode. We identify the wavevector at which this softening is maximal, thereby defining the characteristic length scale of the modulation. Calcium substitution enhances both the amplitude and the wavevector of the softening by strengthening the ferroelectric and antiferrodistortive instabilities. Our results demonstrate that nonlinear flexoelectric phonon coupling tends to stabilize a modulated state that cooperates with, rather than competes against, the other lattice instabilities in SrTiO$_3$.

Title: Emergence of unconventional magnetic order in strain-engineered RuO2/TiO2 superlattices
Authors: Seung Gyo Jeong, Seungjun Lee, Jin Young Oh, Bonnie Y.X. Lin, Anand Santhosh, James M. LeBeau, Alexander J. Grutter, Woo Seok Choi, Tony Low, Valeria Lauter, Bharat Jalan
Abstract: The spin ordering in RuO2 remains a highly debated topic, owing to its elusive nature, with reports ranging from a nonmagnetic ground state to signatures of unconventional magnetic order. Here we provide the first unambiguous, and direct evidence of unconventional magnetism in epitaxial, fully strained RuO2/TiO2 superlattices on TiO2 (110) substrate grown by hybrid molecular beam epitaxy. Polarized neutron reflectometry reveals a finite magnetic moment localized within the compressively strained RuO2 layers, consistent with predictions obtained from first-principles calculations. Complementary density functional theory and X-ray photoemission spectroscopy show that epitaxial strain drives the Ru 4d states toward the Fermi level, triggering a Stoner-type instability that stabilizes non-compensated magnetic order. These unique results reveal that RuO2 exhibits unconventional magnetic states under epitaxial strain, which are not accessible in bulk and establish strain engineering as a powerful route to uncover and control magnetic phases in RuO2 and related oxides.

Title: Correlated states in charge-transfer heterostructures based on rhombohedral multilayer graphene

Abstract: Charge transfer is a common phenomenon in van der Waals heterostructures with proper work function mismatch, which enables electrostatic gating to control band alignment and interlayer charge distributions. This provides a tunable platform for studying coupled bilayer correlated electronic systems. Here, we theoretically investigate heterostructures of rhombohedral multilayer graphene (RMG) and an insulating substrate with gate-tunable band alignment. We first develop a self-consistent electrostatic theory for layer charge densities incorporating charge transfer, which reproduces the experimentally observed broadened and bent charge neutrality region. When the substrate's band edge has a much larger effective mass than RMG, its carriers can form a Wigner crystal at low densities. This creates a quantum superlattice that induces topological flat bands in the RMG layer, which may lead to Chern insulators driven by intralayer Coulomb interactions. Conversely, with comparable effective masses, we find an interlayer excitonic insulator state at charge neutrality stabilized by interlayer Coulomb coupling. Our work establishes these charge-transfer heterostructures as a rich platform for topological and excitonic correlated states, opening an avenue for ``charge-transferonics''.

Title: Topologically switchable transport in a bundled cable of wires
Authors: Nirnoy Basak, Ritajit Kundu, Basudeb Mondal, Adhip Agarwala
Abstract: Advances in the next generation of mesoscopic electronics require an understanding of topological phases in inhomogeneous media and the principles that govern them. Motivated by the nature of motifs available in printable conducting inks, we introduce and study quantum transport in a minimal model that describes a bundle of one-dimensional metallic wires that are randomly interconnected by semiconducting chains. Each of these interconnects is represented by a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain, which can reside in either a trivial or a topological phase. Using a tight-binding approach, we show that such a system can transit from an insulating phase to a robust metallic phase as the interconnects undergo a transition from a trivial to a topological phase. In the latter, despite the random interconnectedness, the metal evades Anderson localization and exhibits a ballistic conductance that scales linearly with the number of wires. We show that this behavior originates from hopping renormalization in the wire network. The zero-energy modes of the topological interconnects act as effective random dimers, giving rise to an energy-dependent localization length that diverges as $\sim 1/E^2$. Our work establishes that random networks provide a yet-unexplored platform to host intriguing phases of topological quantum matter.

Title: Flat-band Ferromagnetism of SU$(N)$ Hubbard Model on the Kagome Lattices
Authors: Hao Jin, Wenxing Nie
Abstract: The kagome lattice, a well known example of the geometrically frustrated system, hosts a dispersionless flat band that offers a unique platform for studying correlation-driven quantum phenomena. At appropriate particle concentrations, the existence of a flat band allows a representation of percolation with nontrivial weights. In this work, we investigate the paramagnetic-ferromagnetic transition in the repulsive SU($N$) Hubbard model on the kagome lattice within this percolation framework. In this representation, the model can be rigorously mapped to a classical $N$-state site-percolation problem on a triangular lattice, with the SU($N$) symmetry reflected in the nontrivial weights. By large-scale Monte Carlo simulations for SU($3$), SU($4$), and SU($10$) symmetries, we demonstrate that the critical particle concentration for ferromagnetism exceeds the standard percolation threshold and increases with $N$, indicating a strengthening of the effective entropic repulsion.

Title: Superfluid Density, Penetration Depth, Condensate Density
Authors: Warren E. Pickett
Abstract: Fascination with the concept of superconducting (SC) {\it superfluid density} $\rho_s$ has persisted since the beginning of superconductivity theory, with numerical values of an actual density rarely provided. Over time $\rho_s$, addressed mostly in cuprate and following high temperature superconductors, has become synonymous with the normalized (unitless) inverse square of the magnetic penetration depth $\lambda_L$ (the London expression, with superfluid density denoted $n_s$), with interest primarily on its temperature $T$ dependence that is expected to reflect the T-dependence of the SC gap amplitude and gap symmetry. In conventional superconductors, generalized expressions from the London penetration depth via Ginzburg-Landau theory, then to BCS theory provide updated pictures of the supercurrent density-vector potential relationship. The BCS value $\lambda_{band}$ is distinct from any particle density, instead involving particle availability at the Fermi surface and Fermi velocity as the determining factors, thus providing a basis for a more fundamental theory and understanding of what is being probed in penetration depth studies. The number density of superconducting electrons ${\cal N}_s(T$=0) -- the scalar SC {\it condensate density} -- is provided, first from a phenomenological estimate but then supported by BCS theory. A straightforward relation connecting ${\cal N}_s(0)$ to the density of dynamically transporting carriers in the normal state at $T_c$ is obtained. Numerical values of relevant material parameters including $\lambda_{band}$ and ${\cal N}_s$ are provided for a few conventional SCs.

Title: Beyond Hubbard: the role of correlated hopping interaction in superconductors and quantum dot devices
Authors: Karol I. Wysokiński, Marcin M. Wysokiński
Abstract: We investigate the role of strong Coulomb interactions beyond the standard Hubbard model in two distinct physical contexts. First, we analyze the superconducting phase transition occurring near the Mott metal-insulator transition. Second, we study transport properties of artificial nano-scale structures containing quantum dots coupled to external electrodes. In both cases, we focus on the impact of the correlated (assisted) hopping (CH) interaction. For superconductors, CH acts as a driving mechanism for the phase transition and modifies the spectral properties of the system. We present the evolution of the spectral function as the system approaches the Mott-type transition under varying model parameters. In quantum-dot-based devices, CH influences the tunneling amplitude between the dot and metallic leads. We demonstrate that the characteristic changes in the conductance of a normal metal-quantum dot-normal metal structure provide a clear signature of the presence and sign of CH interaction.

Title: Molecularly Thin Polyaramid Nanomechanical Resonators
Authors: Hagen Gress, Cody L. Ritt, Inal Shomakhov, Kaan Altmisdort, Michelle Quien, Zitang Wei, John R. Lawall, Narasimha Boddeti, Michael S. Strano, J. Scott Bunch, Kamil L. Ekinci
Abstract: Two-dimensional polyaramids exhibit strong hydrogen bonding to create molecularly thin nanosheets analogous to graphene. Here, we report the first nanomechanical resonators made out of a two-dimensional polyaramid, 2DPA-1, with thicknesses as small as 8 nm. To fabricate these molecular-scale resonators, we transferred nanofilms of 2DPA-1 onto chips with previously etched arrays of circular microwells. We then characterized the thermal resonances of these resonators under different conditions. When there is no residual gas inside the 2DPA-1-covered microwells, the eigenfrequencies are well-described by a tensioned plate theory, providing the Young's modulus and tension of the 2DPA-1 nanofilms. With gas present, the nanofilms bulge up and mechanical resonances are modified due to the adhesion, bulging and slack present in the system. The fabrication and mechanical characterization of these first 2DPA-1 nanomechanical resonators represent a convincing path toward molecular-scale polymeric NEMS with high mechanical strength, low density, and synthetic processability.

Title: Emergent electric field induced by dissipative sliding dynamics of domain walls in a Weyl magnet

Abstract: The dynamic motion of topological defects in magnets induces an emergent electric field, as exemplified by the continuous flow of skyrmion vortices. However, the electrodynamics underlying this emergent field remains poorly understood. In this context, magnetic domain walls - one dimensional topological defects with two collective modes, sliding and spin tilt - offer a promising platform for exploration. Here, we demonstrate that the dissipative motion of domain walls under oscillatory current excitation generates an emergent electric field. We image domain patterns and quantify domain wall length under applied magnetic fields in mesoscopic devices based on the magnetic Weyl semimetal NdAlSi. These devices exhibit exceptionally strong domain wall scattering and a pronounced emergent electric field, observed in the imaginary component of the complex impedance. Spin dynamics simulations reveal that domain wall sliding dominates over spin tilting, where the phase delay of the domain wall motion with respect to the driving force impacts the emergent electric field. Our findings establish domain-wall dynamics as a platform for studying emergent electromagnetic fields and motivate further investigations on the coupled motion of magnetic solitons and conduction electrons.

Title: Synchronization with Annealed Disorder and Higher-Harmonic Interactions in Arbitrary Dimensions: When Two Dimensions Are Special
Authors: Rupak Majumder, Shamik Gupta
Abstract: The impact of disorder on collective phenomena depends crucially on whether it is quenched or annealed. In synchronization problems, quenched disorder in higher dimensional Kuramoto models is known to produce unconventional dimensional effects, including a striking odd even dichotomy: synchronization transitions are continuous in even dimensions and discontinuous in odd dimensions. By contrast, the impact of annealed disorder has received comparatively little attention. Here we study a D dimensional Kuramoto model with both fundamental and higher-harmonic interactions under annealed disorder, and develop an arbitrary dimensional center-manifold framework to analyze the nonlinear dynamics near the onset of collective behavior. We show that annealed disorder fundamentally alters the role of dimensionality. With fundamental coupling alone, it completely removes the odd even dichotomy, yielding continuous synchronization transitions with universal mean-field scaling in all dimensions. Higher-harmonic interactions preserve this universality while rendering the synchronization transition tunable between continuous and discontinuous. At the same time, they give rise to a novel, correlation-driven transition between a symmetry-protected incoherent phase and a symmetry broken state lacking global synchronization, which is therefore invisible to the conventional Kuramoto order parameter. This transition is continuous in two dimensions but discontinuous in higher dimensions, revealing an emergent and previously-unrecognized special role of two dimensions.

Title: Resolution of Topology and Geometry from Momentum-Resolved Spectroscopies
Authors: Shaofeng Huang, Chen Fang
Abstract: Extracting the complete quantum geometric and topological character of Bloch wavefunctions from experiments remains a challenge in condensed matter physics. Here, we resolve this by introducing the "wavefunction form factor" (WFF) matrix, a quantity directly constructible from intensities in momentum- and energy-resolved spectroscopies like ARPES and INS. We demonstrate that band topology is encoded in "spectral nodes" -- momentum-space points where the WFF determinant vanishes, providing a direct readout of topological invariants via a topological selection rule. Furthermore, when the number of independent probes exceeds the number of the target bands, our framework yields an effective band projector. This enables the determination of Wilson loop spectra and the extraction of an effective quantum geometric tensor, providing a model-independent measurement of the non-Abelian Berry curvature and quantum metric as resolved by the experimental probes.

Title: Finite-momentum Cooper plasmons in superconducting terahertz microcavities

Abstract: The phase mode of a superconductor's order parameter encodes fundamental information about pairing and dissipation, but is typically inaccessible at low frequencies due to the Anderson-Higgs mechanism. Superconducting samples thinner than the London penetration depth, however, support a gapless phase mode whose dispersion can be reshaped by a proximal screening layer. Here, we theoretically and experimentally show that this screened phase mode in a superconducting thin film integrated into on-chip terahertz circuitry naturally forms a superconducting microcavity that hosts resonant finite-momentum standing waves of supercurrent density, which we term Cooper plasmons. We measure two Cooper plasmons in a superconducting NbN microcavity and demonstrate that their resonance frequencies and linewidths independently report the density of participating carriers and plasmon's dissipation at finite momenta. Our results reveal an emergent collective mode of an integrated superconductor-circuit system and establish design principles for engineering or suppressing Cooper plasmons in superconducting terahertz devices and circuits.

Title: Emergence and transition of incompressible phases in decorated Landau levels
Authors: Bo Peng, Yuzhu Wang, Bo Yang
Abstract: We show a single Landau level (LL) dressed with periodic electrostatic potentials can realize a plethora of interacting topological phases where the Hall conductivity generally does not equal to the LL filling factor. Their physics can be captured by a minimal model of a delta potential lattice within a single LL, realizing exact zero energy Chern bands (denoted as decorated Landau levels or dLL) gapped from dispersive bands with rich geometric properties. With $p/q$ magnetic fluxes per unit cell, there are $q$ dispersive bands and $p-q$ zero energy bands forming the dLL. When the one-body potential strength dominates the electron-electron interaction, band mixing is suppressed and the dispersion bands consist of ``localized states" with vanishing total Chern number. Nevertheless these dispersive bands can have highly nontrivial Berry curvature distribution, and even non-zero Chern numbers when $q>1$. Interestingly even in the limit of large short range interaction, band mixing between dLL and dispersion bands can be strongly suppressed at low filling factor, leading to robust topological phases within the dLL stabilized by the one-body potential. The dLL and the associated dispersive bands can serve as minimal theoretical models for correlated physics in lattice or moire systems; they are also highly tunable experimental platforms for realizing rich phase diagrams of exotic 2D quantum fluids.

Title: Machine-learning enabled characterization of individual ring resonators in integrated photonic lattices
Authors: Elizabeth Louis Pereira, Amin Hashemi, Faluke Aikebaier, Hongwei Li, Jose L. Lado, Andrea Blanco-Redondo
Abstract: Accurately determining the underlying physical parameters of individual elements in integrated photonics is increasingly difficult as device architectures become more complex. Inferring these parameters directly from spectral measurements of the system as a whole provides a practical alternative to traditional calibration, allowing characterization of photonic systems without relying on detailed device-specific models. Here, we introduce a supervised machine-learning strategy to learn the onsite losses and resonant frequency shifts of each individual ring in an array of coupled ring resonators from measured spectral power distributions of the whole array. The neural network infers these parameters with high accuracy across multiple experimental configurations. Our methodology provides a scalable and non-invasive method for extracting intrinsic parameters in coupled photonic platforms, paving the way for future development of automated calibration and control methods.

Title: Viewpoint: On the Emergence of van der Waals Magnets: A Personal Reflection
Authors: Je-Geun Park
Abstract: The observation of magnetism in atomically thin van der Waals (vdW) antiferromagnets (FePS$_3$, NiPS$_3$, and MnPS$_3$) in 2016 marked an important moment in the development of two-dimensional (2D) physics. In this personal reflection, I describe how a simple question, posed in the early 2010s, motivated experimental efforts that culminated in the demonstration of antiferromagnetic order in monolayer FePS$_3$. Alongside subsequent reports of vdW ferromagnets in 2017, these developments helped establish intrinsic magnetism as a viable degree of freedom in atomically thin materials. I close with personal lessons drawn from this period and a perspective on the opportunities that now shape the field's second decade and beyond.

Title: Probing the Chaos to Integrability Transition in Double-Scaled SYK
Authors: Sergio E. Aguilar-Gutierrez, Rathindra Nath Das, Johanna Erdmenger, Zhuo-Yu Xian
Abstract: We investigate how a thermodynamical first-order phase transition affects the dynamical chaotic behaviour of a given model. To this effect, we analyze the model of Berkooz, Brukner, Jia and Mamroud that interpolates between the double-scaled SYK model and an integrable chord Hamiltonian. This model displays a first-order phase transition given by a kink in the free energy. We map out the dynamical behaviour, as characterized by chord number, Krylov complexity, and operator size, of the model across the phase diagram. We observe a jump in the chord numbers at the transition point, in agreement with the first-order transition. We further determine how scrambling measures, i.e.~the growth of the Lanczos coefficients and the time dependence of the operator size, change across the phase diagram. Deep inside the two phases, these measures indeed display integrable and chaotic behaviour, respectively. Across the transition however, we observe no qualitative change in these measures. This means that the thermodynamical transition does not imply a sharp transition in the growth exponent characterizing the dynamical chaotic behaviour. We also discuss a possible holographic interpretation of the model.

Title: Fragmented Topological Excitations in Generalized Hypergraph Product Codes
Authors: Meng-Yuan Li, Yue Wu
Abstract: Product code construction is a powerful tool for constructing quantum stabilizer codes, which serve as a promising paradigm for realizing fault-tolerant quantum computation. Furthermore, the natural mapping between stabilizer codes and the ground states of exactly solvable spin models also motivates the exploration of many-body orders in the stabilizer codes. In this work, we investigate the fracton topological orders in a family of codes obtained by a recently proposed general construction. More specifically, this code family can be regarded as a class of generalized hypergraph product (HGP) codes. We term the corresponding exactly solvable spin models \textit{orthoplex models}, based on the geometry of the stabilizers. In the 3D orthoplex model, we identify a series of intriguing properties within this model family, including non-monotonic ground state degeneracy (GSD) as a function of system size and non-Abelian lattice defects. Most remarkably, in 4D we discover \textit{fragmented topological excitations}: while such excitations manifest as discrete, isolated points in real space, their projections onto lower-dimensional subsystems form connected objects such as loops, revealing the intrinsic topological nature of these excitations. Therefore, fragmented excitations constitute an intriguing intermediate class between point-like and spatially extended topological excitations. In addition, these rich features establish the generalized HGP codes as a versatile and analytically tractable platform for studying the physics of fracton orders.

Title: A note on invariants of mixed-state topological order in 2D
Authors: Yoshiko Ogata
Abstract: The classification of mixed-state topological order requires indices that behave monotonically under finite-depth quantum channels. In two dimensions, a braided $C^*$-tensor category, which corresponds to strong symmetry, arises from a state satisfying approximate Haag duality. In this note, we show that the $S$-matrix and topological twists of the braided $C^*$-tensor category are quantities that are monotone under finite-depth quantum channels.

Title: Interfacing Superconductor and Semiconductor Digital Electronics
Authors: Yerzhan Mustafa, Selçuk Köse
Abstract: Interface circuits are the key components that enable the hybrid integration of superconductor and semiconductor digital electronics. The design requirements of superconductor-semiconductor interface circuits vary depending on the application, such as high-performance classical computing, superconducting quantum computing, and digital signal processing. In this survey, various interface circuits are categorized based on the working principle and structure. The superconducting output drivers are explored, which are capable of converting and amplifying, e.g., single flux quantum (SFQ) voltage pulses, to voltage levels that semiconductor circuits can process. Several trade-offs between circuit- and system-level design parameters are examined. Accordingly, parameters such as the data rate, output voltage, power dissipation, layout area, thermal/heat load of cryogenic cables, and bit-error rate are considered.

Title: Reentrant topological phases and entanglement scalings in moiré-modulated extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Model
Authors: Guo-Qing Zhang, L. F. Quezada, Shi-Hai Dong
Abstract: Recent studies of moiré physics have unveiled a wealth of opportunities for significantly advancing the field of quantum phase transitions. However, properties of reentrant phase transitions driven by moiré strength are poorly understood. Here, we investigate the reentrant sequence of phase transitions and the invariant of universality class in moiré-modulated extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. For the simplified case with intercell hopping $w=0$, we analytically derive renormalization relations of Hamiltonian parameters to explain the reentrant phenomenon. For the general case, numerical phase boundaries are calculated in the thermodynamic limit. The bulk boundary correspondence between zero-energy edge modes and entanglement spectrum is revealed from the degeneracy of both quantities. We also address the correspondence between the central charge obtained from entanglement entropy and the change in winding number during the phase transition. Our results shed light on the understanding of universal characteristics and bulk-boundary correspondence for moiré induced reentrant phase transitions in 1D condensed-matter systems.

Title: Macroscopic dynamics of quadratic integrate-and-fire neurons subject to correlated noise
Authors: Hui Wang, Chunming Zheng
Abstract: The presence of correlated noise, arising from a mixture of independent fluctuations and a common noisy input shared across the neural population, is a ubiquitous feature of neural circuits, yet its impact on collective network dynamics remains poorly understood. We analyze a network of quadratic integrate-and-fire neurons driven by Gaussian noise with a tunable degree of correlation. Using the cumulant expansion method, we derive a reduced set of effective mean-field equations that accurately describe the evolution of the population's mean firing rate and membrane potential. Our analysis reveals a counterintuitive phenomenon: increasing the noise correlation strength suppresses the mean network activity, an effect we term correlated-noise-inhibited spiking. Furthermore, within a specific parameter regime, the network exhibits metastability, manifesting itself as spontaneous, noise-driven transitions between distinct high- and low-activity states. These results provide a theoretical framework for reducing the dynamics of complex stochastic networks and demonstrate how correlated noise can fundamentally regulate macroscopic neural activity, with implications for understanding state transitions in biological systems.

Title: Collective behavior based on agent-environment interactions
Authors: Gaston Briozzo, Gustavo J. Sibona, Fernando Peruani
Abstract: We present a model of active particles interacting through a dynamic, heterogeneous environment, leading to emergent collective behaviors without direct agent-to-agent communication. Expanding the resource-dependent framework introduced in Briozzo et al., 2025, arXiv:2512.08762, agents perform a persistent random walk combined with chemotaxis, directing toward nutrient-rich patches, whose resources are generated by logistic regrowth. We identify distinct phases of collective organization, ranging from disordered gas-like states to polar traveling waves and nematic independent clusters, depending on the interplay between chemotactic sensitivity and angular noise. The system exhibits spontaneous symmetry breaking and density waves driven purely by the coupling between population dynamics (birth-death processes) and environmental feedback. Our results bridge active matter physics and movement ecology, demonstrating that complex spatiotemporal patterns can arise without direct interaction between agents, but solely from the maximization of resource intake in a reactive environment.

Title: A Generalizable Framework for Building Executable Domain-Specific LLMs under Data Scarcity: Demonstration on Semiconductor TCAD Simulation
Authors: Di Wang, Zhenhua Wu, Yu Liu, Kai Chang, Shaohua Wu
Abstract: Scientific and engineering verticals often suffer from data scarcity and strict executability requirements: models must generate not only fluent text, but also syntactically valid, tool-compilable scripts. We present a schema-first alignment framework for building compact, executable domain-specific LLMs in low-resource settings. The framework integrates three core components: (i) large-scale synthetic QA data generation from expert documentation to instill foundational domain knowledge; (ii) a code-centric IR->DPO workflow that converts verified tool decks into interpretable intermediate representations (IR), performs equivalence-preserving diversification, and constructs preference pairs to directly optimize instruction compliance and code executability; and (iii) a controlled evaluation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), showing that while RAG benefits general LLMs, it can marginally degrade the performance of already domain-aligned models. We demonstrate the framework by instantiating TcadGPT for semiconductor Technology Computer-Aided Design (TCAD). Using 1.5M synthetic QA pairs and an IR-driven DPO dataset, TcadGPT attains 85.6% semantic accuracy and an 80.0% syntax pass rate on SDE executability tests, substantially outperforming state-of-the-art general LLMs such as GPT-4o. To probe portability beyond TCAD, we apply the same recipe to the open-source FEM solver Elmer, observing consistent improvements in script-level success rates over general-purpose baselines. All datasets, benchmarks, and code (including P1, P2, and IR->DPO) are released for reproducibility. Together, these results suggest that the proposed framework provides a robust and reproducible path toward executable LLMs in specialized, data-scarce professional domains.

Title: Coherence Limits in Interference-Based cos(2$φ$) Qubits
Authors: S. Messelot, A. Leblanc, J.-S. Tettekpoe, F. Lefloch, Q. Ficheux, J. Renard, É. Dumur
Abstract: We investigate the coherence properties of parity-protected $\cos(2\varphi)$ qubits based on interferences between two Josephson elements in a superconducting loop. We show that qubit implementations of a $\cos(2\varphi)$ potential using a single loop, such as those employing semiconducting junctions, rhombus circuits, flowermon and KITE structures, can be described by the same Hamiltonian as two multi-harmonic Josephson junctions in a SQUID geometry. We find that, despite the parity protection arising from the suppression of single Cooper pair tunneling, there exists a fundamental trade-off between charge and flux noise dephasing channels. Using numerical simulations, we examine how relaxation and dephasing rates depend on external flux and circuit parameters, and we identify the best compromise for maximum coherence. With currently existing circuit parameters, the qubit lifetime $T_1$ can exceed milliseconds while the dephasing time $T_\varphi$ remains limited to only a few microseconds due to either flux or charge noise. Our findings establish practical limits on the coherence of this class of qubits and raise questions about the long-term potential of this approach.

Title: Quantitative approach for the Dicke-Ising chain with an effective self-consistent matter Hamiltonian
Authors: J. Leibig, M. Hörmann, A. Langheld, A. Schellenberger, K.P. Schmidt
Abstract: In the thermodynamic limit, the Dicke-Ising chain maps exactly onto an effective self-consistent matter Hamiltonian with the photon field acting solely as a self-consistent effective field. As a consequence, no quantum correlations between photons and spins are needed to understand the quantum phase diagram. This enables us to determine the quantum phase diagram in the thermodynamic limit using numerical linked-cluster expansions combined with density matrix renormalization group calculations (NLCE+DMRG) to solve the resulting self-consistent matter Hamiltonian. This includes magnetically ordered phases with significantly improved accuracy compared to previous estimates. For ferromagnetic Ising couplings, we refine the location of the multicritical point governing the change in the order of the superradiant phase transition, reaching a relative accuracy of $10^{-4}$. For antiferromagnetic Ising couplings, we confirm the existence of the narrow antiferromagnetic superradiant phase in the thermodynamic limit. The effective matter Hamiltonian framework identifies the antiferromagnetic superradiant phase as the many-body ground state of an antiferromagnetic transverse-field Ising model with longitudinal field. This phase emerges through continuous Dicke-type polariton condensation from the antiferromagnetic normal phase, followed by a first-order transition to the paramagnetic superradiant phase. Thus, NLCE+DMRG provides a precise determination of the Dicke-Ising phase diagram in one dimension by solving the self-consistent effective matter Hamiltonian.

Title: Optimal control of a dissipative micromaser quantum battery in the ultrastrong coupling regime
Authors: Maristella Crotti, Luca Razzoli, Luigi Giannelli, Giuseppe A. Falci, Giuliano Benenti
Abstract: We investigate the open system dynamics of a micromaser quantum battery operating in the ultrastrong coupling (USC) regime under environmental dissipation. The battery consists of a single-mode electromagnetic cavity sequentially interacting, via the Rabi Hamiltonian, with a stream of qubits acting as chargers. Dissipative effects arise from the weak coupling of the qubit-cavity system to a thermal bath. Non-negligible in the USC regime, the counter-rotating terms substantially improve the charging speed, but also lead, in the absence of dissipation, to unbounded energy growth and highly mixed cavity states. Dissipation during each qubit-cavity interaction mitigates these detrimental effects, yielding steady-state of finite energy and ergotropy. Optimal control on qubit preparation and interaction times enhances battery's performance in: (i) Maximizing the stored ergotropy trhough an optimized charging protocol; (ii) Stabilizing the stored ergotropy against dissipative losses through an optimized measurement-based passive-feedback strategy. Overall, our numerical results demonstrate that the interplay of ultrastrong light-matter coupling, controlled dissipation, and optimized control strategies enables micromaser quantum batteries to achieve both enhanced charging performance and long-term stability under realistic conditions.

Title: Quantum bianisotropy in light-matter interaction
Authors: E. O. Kamenetskii
Abstract: Quantum bianisotropy and chirality are fundamental concepts in light matter interaction that describe how materials with broken symmetries respond to electromagnetic fields at the level of macroscopic quantum electrodynamics. In quantum bianisotropy, magnetoelectric (ME) energy plays a critical role in mediating and enhancing light matter interactions. This concept is essential for bridging the gap between classical electromagnetics (where bianisotropy often involves field nonlocality) and quantum mechanics in metamaterials. The precise manipulation of a quantum emitter's properties at a subwavelength scale is due to near fields, which effectively function as a tunable environment. We show that the ME near field, interpreted as a structure combining the effect of bianisotropy (chirality) with a quantum atmosphere, is a nonMaxwellian field with spacetime symmetry breaking. Quantum ME fields arise from the dynamic modulation and topological coupling of magnetization and electric polarization within ME meta atoms, specific subwavelength structural elements with magnetic and dielectric subsystems in magnetic insulators.

Title: Molecular electrostatic potentials from machine learning models for dipole and quadrupole predictions
Authors: Kadri Muuga, Lisanne Knijff, Chao Zhang
Abstract: The molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) is a key quantity for describing and predicting intermolecular and ion-molecule interactions. Here, we assess the ability of machine-learning (ML) models to infer the MEP, based on the equivariant graph-convolutional neural network architecture PiNet2 and trained on dipole and quadrupole moments. For the established QM9 dataset, we find that including the quadrupole contribution in the ML models substantially improves their ability to recover the MEP compared to dipole-only models. This trend is confirmed on the SPICE dataset, which spans a much broader region of organic chemical space. Together, this study underscores the central role of the quadrupole moment as a fitting target for ML models aiming at rapid access to the MEP.

Title: A comparison of simulation tools for Muon-Induced X-ray Emission (MIXE) in thin films: a study case with lithium batteries
Authors: Maxime Lamotte, Michael W. Heiss, Thomas Prokscha, Alex Amato
Abstract: We present a comparative study of three Monte Carlo simulation frameworks -SRIM, GEANT4, and PHITS- for modeling the transport, stopping, and atomic cascade of negative muons in micrometer-scale, multilayer systems relevant to Muon-Induced X-ray Emission (MIXE) experiments at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI). Using a lithium-ion battery as a benchmark target, simulated implantation profiles are compared with experimental data from the GIANT spectrometer. All three codes reproduce the overall muon depth distributions with good consistency, even across sharp density contrasts. SRIM provides reliable implantation estimates for compact geometries, whereas PHITS reproduces GEANT4 results with comparable accuracy and additionally generates muonic X-ray spectra. These spectra, however, exhibit a systematic energy offset in the K-line transitions of medium- and high-Z elements relative to theoretical and experimental values. Despite this bias, PHITS accurately captures relative intensities and spectral shapes, enabling element-specific line identification. The results demonstrate that SRIM and PHITS constitute practical tools for rapid estimation of muon implantation and stopping profiles, and that PHITS holds strong potential for predictive MIXE spectroscopy once its transition-energy bias is corrected.

Title: Localization Landscape in Non-Hermitian and Floquet quantum systems
Authors: David Guéry-Odelin, François Impens
Abstract: We propose a generalization of the Filoche--Mayboroda localization landscape that extends the theory well beyond the static, elliptic and Hermitian settings while preserving its geometric interpretability. Using the positive operator $H^\dagger H$, we obtain a landscape that predicts localization across non-Hermitian, Floquet, and topological systems without computing eigenstates. Singular-value collapse reveals spectral instabilities and skin effects, the Sambe formulation captures coherent destruction of tunneling, and topological zero modes emerge directly from the landscape. Applications to Hatano--Nelson chains, driven two-level systems, and driven Aubry--André--Harper models confirm quantitative accuracy, establishing a unified predictor for localization in equilibrium and driven quantum matter.

Title: Nonlinear quantum Kibble-Zurek ramps in open systems at finite temperature
Authors: Johannes N. Kriel, Emma C. King, Michael Kastner
Abstract: We analyze quantum systems under a broad class of protocols in which the temperature and a Hamiltonian control parameter are ramped simultaneously and, in general, in a nonlinear fashion toward a quantum critical point. Using an open-system version of a Kitaev quantum wire as an example, we show that, unlike finite-temperature protocols at fixed temperature, these protocols allow us to probe, in an out-of-equilibrium situation and at finite temperature, the universality class (characterized by the critical exponents $\nu$ and $z$) of an equilibrium quantum phase transition at zero temperature. Key to this is the identification of ramps in which both coherent and incoherent parts of the open-system dynamics affect the excitation density in a non-negligible way. We also identify the specific ramps for which subleading corrections to the asymptotic scaling laws are suppressed, which serves as a guide to dynamically probing quantum critical exponents in experimentally realistic finite-temperature situations.

Title: High-Dimensional Analysis of Gradient Flow for Extensive-Width Quadratic Neural Networks
Authors: Simon Martin (DI-ENS, LPENS, SIERRA), Giulio Biroli (LPENS), Francis Bach (DI-ENS, SIERRA)
Abstract: We study the high-dimensional training dynamics of a shallow neural network with quadratic activation in a teacher-student setup. We focus on the extensive-width regime, where the teacher and student network widths scale proportionally with the input dimension, and the sample size grows quadratically. This scaling aims to describe overparameterized neural networks in which feature learning still plays a central role. In the high-dimensional limit, we derive a dynamical characterization of the gradient flow, in the spirit of dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT). Under l2-regularization, we analyze these equations at long times and characterize the performance and spectral properties of the resulting estimator. This result provides a quantitative understanding of the effect of overparameterization on learning and generalization, and reveals a double descent phenomenon in the presence of label noise, where generalization improves beyond interpolation. In the small regularization limit, we obtain an exact expression for the perfect recovery threshold as a function of the network widths, providing a precise characterization of how overparameterization influences recovery.

Title: Quantum solver for single-impurity Anderson models with particle-hole symmetry
Authors: Mariia Karabin, Tanvir Sohail, Dmytro Bykov, Eduardo Antonio Coello Pérez, Swarnava Ghosh, Murali Gopalakrishnan Meena, Seongmin Kim, Amir Shehata, In-Saeng Suh, Hanna Terletska, Markus Eisenbach
Abstract: Quantum embedding methods, such as dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT), provide a powerful framework for investigating strongly correlated materials. A central computational bottleneck in DMFT is in solving the Anderson impurity model (AIM), whose exact solution is classically intractable for large bath sizes. In this work, we develop and benchmark a quantum-classical hybrid solver tailored for DMFT applications, using the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) to prepare the ground state of the AIM with shallow quantum circuits. The solver uses a unified ansatz framework to prepare the particle and hole excitations of the ground-state from parameter-shifted circuits, enabling the reconstruction of the impurity Green's function through a continued-fraction expansion. We evaluate the performance of this approach across a few bath sizes and interaction strengths under noisy, shot-limited conditions. We compare three optimization routines (COBYLA, Adam, and L-BFGS-B) in terms of convergence and fidelity, assess the benefits of estimating a quantum-computed moment (QCM) correction to the variational energies, and benchmark the approach by comparing the reconstructed density of states (DOS) against that obtained using a classical pipeline. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of Green's function reconstruction on near-term devices and establish practical benchmarks for quantum impurity solvers embedded within self-consistent DMFT loops.

Title: Parametric RDT approach to computational gap of symmetric binary perceptron
Authors: Mihailo Stojnic
Abstract: We study potential presence of statistical-computational gaps (SCG) in symmetric binary perceptrons (SBP) via a parametric utilization of \emph{fully lifted random duality theory} (fl-RDT) [96]. A structural change from decreasingly to arbitrarily ordered $c$-sequence (a key fl-RDT parametric component) is observed on the second lifting level and associated with \emph{satisfiability} ($\alpha_c$) -- \emph{algorithmic} ($\alpha_a$) constraints density threshold change thereby suggesting a potential existence of a nonzero computational gap $SCG=\alpha_c-\alpha_a$. The second level estimate is shown to match the theoretical $\alpha_c$ whereas the $r\rightarrow \infty$ level one is proposed to correspond to $\alpha_a$. For example, for the canonical SBP ($\kappa=1$ margin) we obtain $\alpha_c\approx 1.8159$ on the second and $\alpha_a\approx 1.6021$ (with converging tendency towards $\sim 1.59$ range) on the seventh level. Our propositions remarkably well concur with recent literature: (i) in [20] local entropy replica approach predicts $\alpha_{LE}\approx 1.58$ as the onset of clustering defragmentation (presumed driving force behind locally improving algorithms failures); (ii) in $\alpha\rightarrow 0$ regime we obtain on the third lifting level $\kappa\approx 1.2385\sqrt{\frac{\alpha_a}{-\log\left ( \alpha_a \right ) }}$ which qualitatively matches overlap gap property (OGP) based predictions of [43] and identically matches local entropy based predictions of [24]; (iii) $c$-sequence ordering change phenomenology mirrors the one observed in asymmetric binary perceptron (ABP) in [98] and the negative Hopfield model in [100]; and (iv) as in [98,100], we here design a CLuP based algorithm whose practical performance closely matches proposed theoretical predictions.

Title: Optimal universal bounds for waves with varied coherence based on supremum and infimum coherence spectra
Authors: Shiyu Li, Cheng Guo
Abstract: We establish a majorization-based theory for bounding observables of waves with varied coherence. For any measurement, exact bounds are attained by the maximal and minimal elements in the set of input coherence spectra. The set's supremum and infimum, which may lie outside the set, provide optimal universal bounds: any alternative spectrum yielding universal bounds produces weaker constraints. We present an algorithm to compute the supremum and infimum, and prove that they lie either at singular boundary points or strictly outside the set of coherence spectra.

Title: On the origin of neural scaling laws: from random graphs to natural language
Authors: Maissam Barkeshli, Alberto Alfarano, Andrey Gromov
Abstract: Scaling laws have played a major role in the modern AI revolution, providing practitioners predictive power over how the model performance will improve with increasing data, compute, and number of model parameters. This has spurred an intense interest in the origin of neural scaling laws, with a common suggestion being that they arise from power law structure already present in the data. In this paper we study scaling laws for transformers trained to predict random walks (bigrams) on graphs with tunable complexity. We demonstrate that this simplified setting already gives rise to neural scaling laws even in the absence of power law structure in the data correlations. We further consider dialing down the complexity of natural language systematically, by training on sequences sampled from increasingly simplified generative language models, from 4,2,1-layer transformer language models down to language bigrams, revealing a monotonic evolution of the scaling exponents. Our results also include scaling laws obtained from training on random walks on random graphs drawn from Erdös-Renyi and scale-free Barabási-Albert ensembles. Finally, we revisit conventional scaling laws for language modeling, demonstrating that several essential results can be reproduced using 2 layer transformers with context length of 50, provide a critical analysis of various fits used in prior literature, demonstrate an alternative method for obtaining compute optimal curves as compared with current practice in published literature, and provide preliminary evidence that maximal update parameterization may be more parameter efficient than standard parameterization.

Title: Quantum geometry of the rotating shallow water model
Authors: Sriram Ganeshan, Alan T. Dorsey
Abstract: The rotating shallow water equations (RSWE) are a mainstay of atmospheric and oceanic modeling, and their wave dynamics has close analogues in settings ranging from two-dimensional electron gases to active-matter fluids. While recent work has emphasized the topological character of RSWE wave bands, here we develop a complementary quantum-geometric description by computing the full quantum geometric tensor (QGT) for the linearized RSWE on an $f$-plane. The QGT unifies two pieces of band geometry: its real part defines a metric that quantifies how rapidly wave polarization changes with parameters, while its imaginary part is the Berry curvature that controls geometric phases and topological invariants. We obtain compact, symmetry-guided expressions for all three bands, highlighting the transverse structure of the metric and the monopole-like Berry curvature that yields Chern numbers for the Poincaré bands. Finally, we describe a feasible route to probing this geometry in rotating-tank experiments via weak, time-periodic parametric driving.

Title: Madelung hydrodynamics of spin-orbit coupling: action principles, currents, and correlations
Authors: Cesare Tronci
Abstract: We exploit the variational and Hamiltonian structures of quantum hydrodynamics with spin to unfold the correlation and torque mechanisms accompanying spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in electronic motion. Using Hamilton's action principle for the Pauli equation, we isolate SOC-induced quantum forces that act on the orbital Madelung--Bohm trajectories and complement the usual force terms known to appear in quantum hydrodynamics with spin. While the latter spin-hydrodynamic forces relate to the quantum geometric tensor (QGT), SOC-induced orbital forces originate from a particular current operator that contributes prominently to the spin current and whose contribution was overlooked in the past. The distinction between different force terms reveals two fundamentally different mechanisms generating quantum spin-orbit correlations. Leveraging the Hamiltonian structure of the hydrodynamic system, we also elucidate spin transport features such as the current shift in the spin Hall effect and the correlation-induced quantum torques. Finally, we illustrate the framework via the Madelung--Rashba equations for planar SOC configurations and propose a particle-based scheme for numerical implementation.

Title: Scalable Spin Squeezing in Power-Law Interacting XXZ Models with Disorder
Authors: Samuel E. Begg, Bishal K. Ghosh, Chong Zu, Chuanwei Zhang, Michael Kolodrubetz
Abstract: While spin squeezing has been traditionally considered in all-to-all interacting models, recent works have shown that spin squeezing can occur in systems with power-law interactions, leading to direct testing in Rydberg atoms, trapped ions, ultracold atoms and nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. For the latter, Wu. et al. Nature 646 (2025) demonstrated that spin squeezing is heavily affected by positional disorder, reducing any capacity for a practical squeezing advantage, which requires scalability with the system size. In this Letter we explore the robustness of spin-squeezing in two-dimensional lattices with a fraction of unoccupied lattice sites. Using semi-classical modeling, we demonstrate the existence of scalable squeezing in power-law interacting XXZ models up to a disorder threshold, above which squeezing is not scalable. We produce a phase diagram for scalable squeezing, and explain its absence in the aforementioned NV experiment. Our work illustrates the maximum disorder allowed for realizing scalable spin squeezing in a host of quantum simulators, highlights a regime with substantial tolerance to disorder, and identifies controlled defect creation as a promising route for scalable squeezing in solid-state systems.

Title: Theoretical Design of Effective Multilayer Optical Coatings Using Oxyhydride Thin Films
Authors: E. Strugovshchikov, A. Pishtshev, S. Karazhanov
Abstract: Rare-earth metal oxyhydride compositions are currently attracting increasing attention to develop materials with unusual optical responses. Herein, using computer simulations of the electronic and optical properties, the optical responses of two stable yttrium oxyhydride compounds, Y4H10O and YHO, are studied for the visible light range. The emphasis is on modeling macroscopic optical characteristics, which are numerically derived within a conventional scheme using refractive indices, and absorption, transmittance, and reflection spectra. The main goal is twofold: first, to simulate spectral behavior of different single-phase and two-phase oxyhydride compositions and second, to conduct a comparative analysis that could explain the features of the transmission spectra measured for different samples. Based on the obtained results, models of new optical coatings are proposed in which yttrium oxyhydrides play the key role. In the context of nonlinear optics, the frequency profile of the second-order susceptibility for the noncentrosymmetric cubic structure of Y4H10O is evaluated and it is shown that this system could exhibit large optical nonlinearity.

Title: Localization with non-Hermitian off-diagonal disorder
Authors: Aitijhya Saha, Debraj Rakshit
Abstract: In this work, we discuss a non-Hermitian system described via a one-dimensional single-particle tight-binding model, where the non-Hermiticity is governed by random nearest-neighbour tunnellings, such that the left-to-right and right-to-left hopping strengths are unequal. A physical situation of completely real eigenspectrum arises owing to the Hamiltonian's tridiagonal matrix structure under a simple sign conservation of the product of the conjugate nearest-neighbour tunnelling terms. The off-diagonal disorder leads the non-Hermitian system to a delocalization-localization crossover in finite systems. The emergent nature of the crossover is recognized through a finite-size spectral analysis. The system enters into a localized phase for infinitesimal disorder strength in the thermodynamic limit. We perform a careful scaling analysis of localization length, inverse participation ratio (IPR), and energy splitting and report the corresponding scaling exponents. Noticeably, in contrast to the diagonal disorder, the density of states (DOS) has a singularity at E=0 in the presence of the off-diagonal disorder and the corresponding wavefunction remains delocalized for any given disorder strength.

Title: Curvature effect induces topological phase transitions in two dimensional topological superconductor
Authors: Huan-Wen Lai, Meng-Chien Wang, Ching-Ray Chang, Seng-Ghee Tan
Abstract: Recently, topological superconductors have emerged as a pivotal frontier in condensed matter physics, owing to the exotic properties of Majorana quasiparticles residing on edges, surfaces, and vortex cores. In this work, we investigate a two-dimensional s+p wave noncentrosymmetric superconductor (NCS) with Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) on a cylindrical manifold. By employing a thin-layer quantization approach, we derive the effective Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) Hamiltonian to elucidate the interplay between surface curvature and topological phase transitions. Our analytical and numerical results demonstrate that the curvature-induced geometric potential (da Costa potential) and the spatial reconfiguration of spin-momentum locking effectively modulate the superconducting gap. From a band theory perspective, we confirm that curvature serves as a critical tuning parameter, capable of driving topological phase transitions by inducing band inversion.

Title: Predicting the suitability of photocatalysts for water splitting using Koopmans spectral functionals: The case of TiO$_2$ polymorphs
Authors: Marija Stojkovic, Edward Linscott, Nicola Marzari
Abstract: Photocatalytic water splitting has attracted considerable attention for renewable energy production. Since the first reported photocatalytic water splitting by titanium dioxide, this material remains one of the most promising photocatalysts, due to its suitable band gap and band-edge positions. However, predicting both of these properties is a challenging task for existing computational methods. Here we show how Koopmans spectral functionals can accurately predict the band structure and level alignment of rutile, anatase, and brookite TiO$_2$ using a computationally efficient workflow that only requires (a) a DFT calculation of the photocatalyst/vacuum interface and (b) a Koopmans spectral functional calculation of the bulk photocatalyst. The success of this approach for TiO$_2$ suggests that this strategy could be deployed for assessing the suitability of novel photocatalyst candidates.

Title: Topological constraints on self-organisation in locally interacting systems
Authors: Francesco Sacco, Dalton A R Sakthivadivel, Michael Levin
Abstract: All intelligence is collective intelligence, in the sense that it is made of parts which must align with respect to system-level goals. Understanding the dynamics which facilitate or limit navigation of problem spaces by aligned parts thus impacts many fields ranging across life sciences and engineering. To that end, consider a system on the vertices of a planar graph, with pairwise interactions prescribed by the edges of the graph. Such systems can sometimes exhibit long-range order, distinguishing one phase of macroscopic behaviour from another. In networks of interacting systems we may view spontaneous ordering as a form of self-organisation, modelling neural and basal forms of cognition. Here, we discuss necessary conditions on the topology of the graph for an ordered phase to exist, with an eye towards finding constraints on the ability of a system with local interactions to maintain an ordered target state. By studying the scaling of free energy under the formation of domain walls in three model systems -- the Potts model, autoregressive models, and hierarchical networks -- we show how the combinatorics of interactions on a graph prevent or allow spontaneous ordering. As an application we are able to analyse why multiscale systems like those prevalent in biology are capable of organising into complex patterns, whereas rudimentary language models are challenged by long sequences of outputs.

Title: Time-domain extreme ultraviolet diffuse scattering spectroscopy of nanoscale surface phonons

Abstract: We report the observation of dynamic fringe patterns in the diffuse scattering of extreme ultraviolet light from surfaces, following femtosecond optical excitation. At each point on the detector, the diffuse scattering intensity exhibits oscillations at well-defined frequencies that correspond to surface phonons with wave vectors determined by the scattering geometry, indicating that the optical excitation generates coherent surface phonons propagating in all directions and spanning a wavelength range from 60 to 300 nm. This phenomenon is observed on a variety of samples, including single-layer and multilayer metal films, as well as bulk semiconductors. The measured surface phonon dispersions show good agreement with theoretical calculations. By comparing signal amplitudes from samples with different surface morphologies, we find that the excitation mechanism is linked to the natural surface roughness of the samples. However, the signal is still detectable on extremely smooth surfaces with sub-nanometer roughness. Our findings demonstrate a simple and effective method for optically exciting coherent surface phonons with nanoscale wavelengths on a wide range of solid samples and establish a foundation for surface phonon spectroscopy in a wave vector range well beyond the limit of conventional surface Brillouin scattering.

Title: Duality viewpoint of noninvertible symmetry protected topological phases
Authors: Weiguang Cao, Masahito Yamazaki, Linhao Li
Abstract: Recent advancements in generalized symmetries have drawn significant attention to gapped phases of matter exhibiting novel symmetries, such as noninvertible symmetries. By leveraging the duality transformations, the classification and construction of gapped phases with noninvertible symmetry can be mapped to those involving conventional group symmetries. We demonstrate this approach by classifying symmetry-protected-topological phases with a broad class of noninvertible symmetries in arbitrary spacetime dimensions. Our results reveal new classifications that extend beyond those based on group symmetries. Additionally, we construct lattice models in $(1+1)D$ and $(2+1)D$ that realize these new phases and explore their anomalous interfaces.

Title: Odd-parity altermagnetism through sublattice currents: From Haldane-Hubbard model to general bipartite lattices
Authors: Yu-Ping Lin, Marc Vila
Abstract: We propose the sublattice currents as a feasible route to odd-parity altermagnetism (ALM), where nonrelativistic collinear spin splitting occurs in the bands as an odd function of momentum. In contrast to previously classified ALMs, the sublattice currents break the time-reversal symmetry in the nonmagnetic crystal structure and allow for such odd-parity spin splitting. A representative example is the Haldane-Hubbard model at half filling. Although the compensated collinear magnetic ground state was previously recognized as antiferromagnetism, we show that sublattice currents induce spin splitting in the bands and therefore turn it into an odd-parity ALM. Interestingly, its topological version serves as an example of ALM Chern insulator. We further generalize the Haldane-Hubbard model to common two- and three-dimensional bipartite lattices. With spin splitting from sublattice currents, the compensated collinear magnetic ground states at half filling are generally odd-parity ALM.

Title: Monitored Fluctuating Hydrodynamics
Authors: Sarang Gopalakrishnan, Ewan McCulloch, Romain Vasseur
Abstract: We introduce a hydrodynamic framework for describing monitored classical stochastic processes. We study the conditional ensembles for these monitored processes -- i.e., we compute spacetime correlation functions conditioned on a fixed, typical measurement record. In the presence of global symmetries we show that these conditional ensembles can undergo measurement-induced "sharpening" phase transitions as a function of the monitoring rate; moreover, even weak monitoring can give rise to novel critical phases, derived entirely from a classical perspective. We give a simple hydrodynamic derivation of the known "charge-fuzzy phase" for weakly monitored diffusive many-body quantum systems. We show that although the unmonitored symmetric and asymmetric exclusion processes are in different universality classes of transport, the fluctuations in their conditional ensembles flow to the same fixed point with emergent relativistic invariance under monitoring. On the other hand, weakly monitored systems with non-Abelian symmetries enter a novel strongly coupled fixed point with non-trivial dynamical exponent, which we characterize. Our formalism naturally accounts for monitoring general observables, such as currents or density gradients, and allows for a direct calculation of information-theoretic diagnostics of sharpening transitions, including the Shannon entropy of the measurement record.

Title: Interfacial Behavior from the Atomic Blueprint: Machine Learning-Guided Design of Spatially Functionalized a-SiO2 Surfaces
Authors: Evgenii Strugovshchikov, Viktor Mandrolko, Dominika Lesnicki, Mariachiara Pastore, Laurent Chaput, Mykola Isaiev
Abstract: a-Quartz surfaces functionalized with hydroxyl and methyl groups provide a versatile platform for controlling interfacial properties critical to applications such as catalysis, protective coatings, and energy conversion. The arrangement of these functional groups strongly influences interfacial interactions at solid-liquid interfaces, highlighting their relevance to colloid and interface science. However, conventional models often treat surface functionalization as spatially homogeneous, overlooking the atomic-scale organization of surface groups. We hypothesize that this spatial distribution, beyond overall composition, plays a decisive role in governing surface stability and interfacial behavior. To test this hypothesis, we employ a multi-scale simulation workflow combining density functional theory, ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD), and machine-learned force fields (MLFFs). This approach allows us to explore a range of spatial patterns of OH/CH3 functionalization on the a-quartz (0001) surface. We evaluate the impact of spatial arrangements on mixing energy, hydrogen bonding networks, and vibrational properties with high accuracy and robustness. Our results reveal that spatial patterning strongly influences surface stability and interfacial structure. A thermodynamically favored unpaired configuration emerges near 67 % CH3 substitution, where isolated OH groups form secondary hydrogen bonds through reorientation toward subsurface oxygen atoms. This rearrangement induces a characteristic blue shift in OH stretching frequencies, indicating weaker H-bonding. These effects are absent in clustered arrangements. By establishing a clear link between functional group patterning and interfacial behavior, our work uncovers the underlying mechanisms to guide and accelerate the rational design of silica-based materials and coatings, directly relevant to colloid and interface science.

Title: Dissipation meets conformal interface in open quantum systems: How the relaxation rate is suppressed
Authors: Ruhanshi Barad, Qicheng Tang, Xueda Wen
Abstract: Conformal interfaces play an important role in quantum critical systems. In closed systems, the transmission properties of conformal interfaces are typically characterized by two quantities: One is the effective central charge $c_{\text{eff}}$, which measures the amount of quantum entanglement through the interface, and the other is the transmission coefficient $c_{\text{LR}}$, which measures the energy transmission through the interface. In the present work, to characterize the transmission property of conformal interfaces in open quantum systems, we propose a third quantity $c_{\text{relax}}$, which is defined through the ratio of Liouvillian gaps with and without an interface. Physically, $c_{\text{relax}}$ measures the suppression of the relaxation rate towards a steady state when the system is subject to a local dissipation. We perform both analytical perturbation calculations and exact numerical calculations based on a free fermion chain at the critical point. It is found that $c_{\text{relax}}$ decreases monotonically with the strength of the interface. In particular, $0\le c_{\text{relax}}\le c_{\text{LR}}\le c_{\text{eff}}$, where the equalities hold if and only if the interface is totally reflective or totally transmissive. Our result for $c_{\text{relax}}$ is universal in the sense that $c_{\text{relax}}$ is independent of (i) the dissipation strength in the weak dissipation regime and (ii) the location where the local dissipation is introduced. Comparing to the previously known $c_{\text{LR}}$ and $c_{\text{eff}}$ in a closed system, our $c_{\text{relax}}$ shows a distinct behavior as a function of the interface strength, suggesting its novelty to characterize conformal interfaces in open systems and offering insights into critical systems under dissipation.

Title: Discovering quasiorder parameters in the Potts model: A bridge between machine learning and critical phenomena
Authors: Yi-Lun Du, Nan Su, Konrad Tywoniuk
Abstract: Machine-learning (ML) models trained on Ising spin configurations have demonstrated surprising effectiveness in classifying phases of Potts models, even when processing severely reduced representations that retain only two spin states. To unravel this remarkable capability, we identify a family of alternative order parameters for the $q=3$ and $q=4$ Potts models on a square lattice, constructed from the occupancies of secondary and minimal spin states rather than the conventional dominant-state order parameter. Through systematic finite-size scaling analyses, we demonstrate that these quantities, along with a magnetization-like quantity derived from a reduced spin representation, accurately capture critical behavior, yielding critical temperatures and exponents consistent with established theoretical predictions and numerical benchmarks. Furthermore, we rigorously establish the fundamental relationships between these alternative (quasi)order parameters, demonstrating how they collectively encode criticality through different aspects of spin configurations. Our results clarify, within this specific setting, how reduced spin representations can retain the essential thermodynamic information needed for identifying critical behavior. Taken together, this work establishes a concrete bridge between Ising-trained ML models and critical phenomena in Potts systems by showing that Potts criticality can be encoded in more compact, non-traditional forms, thereby opening avenues for discovering analogous order parameters in broader spin systems.

Title: Chirality Amplification and Chiral Segregation in Liquid Crystals
Authors: Matthew J. Deutsch, Robin L. B. Selinger, Paul van der Schoot
Abstract: Liquid crystal mesophases of achiral molecules are normally achiral, yet in a few materials they spontaneously segregate and form right- and left-handed chiral domains. One mechanism that drives chiral segregation is molecular shape fluctuations between axial chiral conformations, where molecular interactions favor matching chirality and promote helical twist. Cooperative chiral ordering may also play a role in chirality amplification, as when a tiny fraction of chiral dopant drives a nematic phase to become cholesteric. We present a model of cooperative chiral ordering in liquid crystals using Maier-Saupe theory, and predict a phase diagram with a segregated cholesteric phase with alternating domains of left- and right-handed chiral twist, with opposite enantiomeric excess, in addition to racemic nematic and isotropic phases. Our model also demonstrates how chiral molecular fluctuations influence the helical twisting power of dopants in the nematic phase, which may be observed even in materials where the segregated cholesteric phase is preempted by a transition to another phase. We compare these results with Monte Carlo simulation studies of the switchable chiral Lebwohl-Lasher model, where each spin switches between right- and left-handed chiral states. Simulation results validate the predicted phase diagram, demonstrate chiral amplification in the racemic nematic phase, and reveal complex coarsening dynamics in the segregated cholesteric phase. These results suggest that molecular fluctuations between degenerate chiral configurations may be a common mechanism to produce cooperative chiral order in achiral liquid crystals.

Title: Quantization and quantum oscillations of the sublattice charge order in Dirac insulators
Authors: Arindam Tarafdar, Tigran A. Sedrakyan
Abstract: We report the quantization, quantum oscillations, and singular behavior of sublattice symmetry-breaking sublattice charge order (SCO) in two-dimensional Dirac insulators at charge neutrality under perpendicular magnetic fields $B$. SCO is induced by staggered sublattice potentials, such as those originating from substrates, strains, hydrogenation, and chemical doping. In small non-quantizing magnetic fields that result in less than a flux quantum threading the system, and small sublattice symmetry breaking potentials, SCO exhibits perturbative singular magnetic field dependence, $\sim |B|$, originating from hopping between neighboring sites of the same sublattice. At intermediate magnetic fields, when the cyclotron gap between the zeroth Landau level and the first Landau level, $\omega_c$, is smaller than the sublattice potential, $\omega_c\lesssim \Delta$, SCO shows $\textit{universally}$ quantized plateaus owing to discrete Landau-level degeneracy. As the magnetic flux increases by one flux quantum, one electron (per spin) is transferred from the sublattice with a higher chemical potential to the sublattice with a lower chemical potential. One electron transfer between sublattices per flux quantum results from the sublattice polarization of the zeroth Landau level in gapped Dirac materials, realizing the topological Thouless pump effect. At stronger magnetic fields, $\omega_c\gtrsim \ \Delta$, corresponding to integer quantum Hall regimes, SCO displays singularities based on the physics of quantum magneto-oscillations. Our findings suggest new ways to experimentally detect the presence of the energy gap in Dirac materials, irrespective of the gap size.

Abstract: Zero- and two-dimensional crystal defects form in open statistical ensembles, such as the grand canonical, that are usually inaccessible with conventional simulation techniques. This longstanding challenge is overcome with a new Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method that samples energy-biased gradual transformations. The method enables free energy calculations for nonideal point defects and the direct prediction of finite-temperature interface structures.

Title: Superconducting Ring Resonators: Modelling, Simulation, and Experimental Characterisation
Authors: Zhenyuan Sun, Stafford Withington, Christopher Thomas, Songyuan Zhao
Abstract: We present a theoretical and experimental study of superconducting ring resonators as an initial step toward their implementation in superconducting electronics and quantum technologies, with promising applications including superconducting parametric amplifiers with pump-signal isolation, flux-controlled quantum circuits, ultra-sensitive measurements in quantum sensing, and THz instrumentations. These devices have the potentially valuable property of supporting two orthogonal electromagnetic modes that couple to a common Cooper pair, quasiparticle, and phonon system. We present here a comprehensive theoretical and experimental analysis of the superconducting ring resonator system. We have developed superconducting ring resonator models that describe the key features of microwave behaviour to first order, providing insights into how transmission line inhomogeneities give rise to frequency splitting and mode rotation. Furthermore, we constructed signal flow graphs for a four-port ring resonator to numerically validate the behaviour predicted by our theoretical analysis. Superconducting ring resonators were fabricated in both coplanar waveguide and microstrip geometries using Al and Nb thin films. Microwave characterisation of these devices demonstrates close agreement with theoretical predictions. Our study reveals that frequency splitting and mode rotation are prevalent in ring systems with coupled degenerate modes, and these phenomena become distinctly resolved in high quality factor superconducting ring resonators.

Title: Spacetime symmetry-enriched SymTFT: from LSM anomalies to modulated symmetries and beyond
Authors: Salvatore D. Pace, Ömer M. Aksoy, Ho Tat Lam
Abstract: We extend the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) framework beyond internal symmetries by including geometric data that encode spacetime symmetries. Concretely, we enrich the SymTFT of an internal symmetry by spacetime symmetries and study the resulting symmetry-enriched topological (SET) order, which captures the interplay between the spacetime and internal symmetries. We illustrate the framework by focusing on symmetries in ${1+1}$D. To this end, we first analyze how gapped boundaries of ${2+1}$D SETs affect the enriching symmetry, and apply this within the SymTFT framework to gauging and detecting anomalies of the ${1+1}$D symmetry, as well as to classifying ${1+1}$D symmetry-enriched phases. We then consider quantum spin chains and explicitly construct the SymTFTs for three prototypical spacetime symmetries: lattice translations, spatial reflections, and time reversal. For lattice translations, the interplay with internal symmetries is encoded in the SymTFT by translations permuting anyons, which causes the continuum description of the SymTFT to be a foliated field theory. Using this, we elucidate the relation between Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) anomalies and modulated symmetries and classify modulated symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. For reflection and time-reversal symmetries, the interplay can additionally be encoded by symmetry fractionalization data in the SymTFT, and we identify mixed anomalies and study gauging for such examples.

Title: Time-reversal invariant vortex in topological superconductors and gravitational $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topology
Authors: Kazuki Yamamoto, Naoto Kan, Hidenori Fukaya
Abstract: We study a time-reversal invariant vortex, namely a spin vortex, in helical superconductors by focusing on its emergent gravitational structure. The topology of the time-reversal invariant vortex is classified by a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant: helical Majorana zero modes appear at the vortex core when the winding number is odd, while no such zero modes exist when it is even. We provide a formal mapping to the theory of gravity to describe this $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological structure. Identifying a superconducting order parameter as a vielbein in the theory of gravity, we explicitly convert the Bogoliubov-de-Genne Hamiltonian into the Dirac Hamiltonian coupled to a nontrivial gravitational field. Then we find that a gravitational curvature is induced at the vortex core, with its total flux quantized in integer multiples of $\pi$, reflecting the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topology. Although the curvature vanishes everywhere except at the vortex core, the energy spectrum remains sensitive to the total curvature flux, owing to the gravitational Aharonov-Bohm effect. We further demonstrate that our gravitational framework can be applied to the topological phase transition driven by the vortex-linking precess in three-dimensional helical superconductors such as the He-B phase.

Title: Stochastic systems with Bose-Hubbard interactions: Effects of bias on particles on a 1D lattice
Authors: Swastik Majumder, Mustansir Barma
Abstract: Driven non-equilibrium lattice models have wide-ranging applications in contexts such as mass transport, traffic flow, and transport in biological systems. In this work, we investigate the steady-state properties of a one-dimensional lattice system that allows multiple particle occupancy on each site. The particles undergo stochastic nearest-neighbor jumps influenced by both a directional bias and on-site repulsive interactions of the Bose-Hubbard type. With periodic boundary conditions, we observe a non-monotonic dependence of inter-site correlation functions on the interaction strength. At large interaction strengths, the state consists of quiescent stacks of stationary particles along with an emergent asymmetric simple exclusion process(ASEP), and the particle current exhibits a periodic dependence on density. In contrast, with open boundary conditions, the system displays step-like density profiles reminiscent of those in tilted Bose-Hubbard systems, and a regime with a macroscopic number of empty sites followed by a steep parameter-dependent increase in density. Our results highlight how the interplay between drive, interaction, and boundary conditions leads to distinctive signatures on the current and density profiles in the steady state in different regimes.

While monolayer two-dimensional semiconductors (2DS) offer ultimate thickness scaling, good performance has largely been achieved only in micrometer-wide channels. Here, we demonstrate both $\it{n}$- and $\it{p}$-type nanoribbon transistors based on monolayer 2DS, fabricated using a multi-patterning process, reaching channel widths and lengths down to 25-30 nm. 'Anchored' contacts improve device yield, while nanoscale imaging, including tip-enhanced photoluminescence, reveals minimal edge degradation. The devices reach on-state currents up to 560, 420, and 130 $\mu$A $\mu$m$^{-1}$ at 1 V drain-to-source voltage for $\it{n}$-type MoS$_{2}$, WS$_{2}$, and $\it{p}$-type WSe$_{2}$, respectively, integrated with thin high-$\kappa$ dielectrics. These results surpass prior reports for single-gated nanoribbons, the WS$_{2}$ by over 100 times, even in normally-off (enhancement-mode) transistors. Taken together, these findings suggest that top down patterned 2DS nanoribbons are promising building blocks for future nanosheet transistors.

Title: Nonadiabatic H-Atom Scattering Channels on Ge(111) Elucidated by the Hierarchical Equations of Motion
Authors: Xiaohan Dan, Zhuoran Long, Tianyin Qiu, Jan Paul Menzel, Qiang Shi, Victor S. Batista
Abstract: Atomic and molecular scattering at semiconductor interfaces plays a central role in surface chemistry and catalysis, yet predictive simulations remain challenging due to strong nonadiabatic effects causing the breakdown of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. Here, we present fully quantum simulations of H-atom scattering from the Ge(111)c(2x8) rest site using the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) with matrix product states (MPS). The system is modeled by mapping a density functional theory (DFT) potential energy surface onto a Newns-Anderson Hamiltonian. Our simulations reproduce the experimentally observed bimodal kinetic energy distributions, capturing both elastic and energy-loss channels. By systematically examining atom-surface coupling, incident energy, and isotope substitution, we identify the strong-coupling regime required to recover the experimental energy-loss profile. This regime suppresses the elastic peak, implying additional site-specific scattering channels in the observed elastic peak. Deuterium substitution further produces a subtle shift in the energy-loss peak, consistent with experiment. These results establish HEOM as a rigorous framework for quantum surface scattering, capable of capturing nonadiabatic dynamics beyond electronic friction and perturbative approaches.

Title: Non-Hermitian topological superconductivity with symmetry-enriched spectral and eigenstate features
Authors: Chuo-Kai Chang, Kazuma Saito, Nobuyuki Okuma, Hsien-Chung Kao, Chen-Hsuan Hsu
Abstract: We investigate a one-dimensional superconducting lattice that realizes all internal symmetries permitted in non-Hermitian systems, characterized by nonreciprocal hopping, onsite dissipation, and $s$-wave singlet pairing in a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-type structure. The combined presence of pseudo-Hermiticity and sublattice symmetry imposes constraints on the energy spectra. We identify parameter regimes featuring real spectra, purely imaginary spectra, complex flat bands, and Majorana zero modes, the latter emerging when a uniform transverse magnetic field suppresses the non-Hermitian skin effect. We show that a uniform onsite dissipation is essential for stabilizing the zero modes, whereas a purely staggered dissipation destroys the topological superconductivity. Through Hermitianization, we construct a spectral winding number as a topological invariant and demonstrate its correspondence with the gap closing conditions and appearance of the Majorana zero modes, allowing us to establish topological phase diagrams. Moreover, we reveal nontrivial correlations between the particle-hole and spin components of left and right eigenstates, enforced by chiral symmetry, pseudo-Hermiticity, and their combination. Our results highlight how non-Hermiticity, sublattice structure, and superconductivity together enrich symmetry properties and give rise to novel topological phenomena.

Title: The role of stacking and strain in mean-field magnetic moments of multilayer graphene
Authors: András Balogh, Zoltán Tajkov, Péter Nemes-Incze, János Koltai
Abstract: Rhombohedral or ABC stacked multilayer graphene hosts a correlated magnetic ground state at charge neutrality, making it one of the simplest systems to investigate strong electronic correlations. We investigate this ground state in multilayer graphene structures using the Hubbard model in a distance dependent Slater-Koster tight binding framework. We show that by using a universal Hubbard-$U$ term, we can accurately capture the spin polarization predicted by hybrid density functional theory calculations for both hexagonal (ABA) and rhombohedral (ABC) stackings. Using this $U$ value, we calculate the magnetic moments of 3-8 layers of ABC and ABA graphene multilayers. We demonstrate that the structure and magnitude of these magnetic moments are robust when heterostructures are built from varying numbers of ABC and ABA multilayers. By applying different types of mechanical distortions, we study the behaviour of the magnetism in graphene systems under uniaxial strain and pressure. Our results establish a computationally efficient framework to investigate correlation-driven magnetism across arbitrary stacking configurations of graphite polytypes.

Title: Non-uniqueness of the steady state for run-and-tumble particles with a double-well interaction potential
Authors: Léo Touzo, Pierre Le Doussal
Abstract: We study $N$ run-and-tumble particles (RTPs) in one dimension interacting via a double-well potential $W(r)=-k_0 \, r^2/2+g \, r^4/4$, which is repulsive at short interparticle distance $r$ and attractive at large distance. At large time, the system forms a bound state where the density of particles has a finite support. We focus on the determination of the total density of particles in the stationary state $\rho_s(x)$, in the limit $N\to+\infty$. We obtain an explicit expression for $\rho_s(x)$ as a function of the ''renormalized" interaction parameter $k=k_0-3m_2$ where $m_2$ is the second moment of $\rho_s(x)$. Interestingly, this stationary solution exhibits a transition between a connected and a disconnected support for a certain value of $k$, which has no equivalent in the case of Brownian particles. Analyzing in detail the expression of the stationary density in the two cases, we find a variety of regimes characterized by different behaviors near the edges of the support and around $x=0$. Furthermore, we find that the mapping $k_0\to k$ becomes multi-valued below a certain value of the tumbling rate $\gamma$ of the RTPs for some range of values of $k_0$ near the transition, implying the existence of two stable solutions. Finally, we show that in the case of a disconnected support, it is possible to observe steady states where the density $\rho_s(x)$ is not symmetric. All our analytical predictions are in good agreement with numerical simulations already for systems of $N = 100$ particles. The non-uniqueness of the stationary state is a particular feature of this model in the presence of active (RTP) noise, which contrasts with the uniqueness of the Gibbs equilibrium for Brownian particles. We argue that these results are also relevant for a class of more realistic interactions with both an attractive and a repulsive part, but which decay at infinity.

Title: Acoustic transparency and absorption in dense granular suspensions
Authors: Arnaud Tourin, Yamil Abraham, Marie Palla, Arthur Le Ber, Romain Pierrat, Nicolas Benech, Carlos Negreira, Xiaoping Jia
Abstract: We demonstrate the existence of a frequency band exhibiting acoustic transparency in 2D and 3D dense granular suspensions, enabling the transmission of a low-frequency ballistic wave excited by a high-frequency broadband ultrasound pulse. This phenomenon is attributed to spatial correlations in the structural disorder of the medium. To support this interpretation, we use an existing model that incorporates such correlations via the structure factor. Its predictions are shown to agree well with those of the Generalized Coherent Potential Approximation (GCPA) model, which is known to apply at high volume fractions, including the close packing limit, but does not explicitly account for disorder correlation. Within the transparency band, attenuation is found to be dominated by absorption rather than scattering. Measurements of the frequency dependence of the absorption coefficient reveal significant deviations from conventional models, challenging the current understanding of acoustic absorption in dense granular media.

Title: Niobium's intrinsic coherence length and penetration depth revisited using low-energy muon spin spectroscopy and secondary-ion mass spectrometry
Authors: Ryan M. L. McFadden, Jonathan W. Angle, Eric M. Lechner, Michael J. Kelley, Charles E. Reece, Matthew A. Coble, Thomas Prokscha, Zaher Salman, Andreas Suter, Tobias Junginger
Abstract: We report direct, simultaneous measurements of the London penetration depth ($\lambda_L$) and Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) coherence length ($\xi_0$) in oxygen-doped niobium, with impurity concentrations spanning the "clean" to "dirty" limits. Two depth-resolved techniques - low-energy muon spin spectroscopy (LE-$\mu$SR) and secondary-ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) - were used to quantify the element's Meissner screening profiles, analyzed within a framework that accounts for nonlocal electrodynamics. The analysis indicates intrinsic length scales of $\lambda_L = 29.1(10)$ nm and $\xi_0 = 39.9(25)$ nm, corresponding to a Ginzburg-Landau (GL) parameter of $\kappa = 0.70(5)$. The obtained $\lambda_L$ and $\kappa$ values, accurately quantified at the nanoscale, are smaller than values commonly used in applications and modeling, and indicate that clean niobium lies at the boundary between type-I and type-II superconductivity, supporting the contemporary view that its intrinsic state may be type-I.

Title: Nonrelativistic Functional Properties in Collinear Antiferromagnets Based on Multipole Representation Theory
Authors: Yuuki Ogawa, Satoru Hayami
Abstract: In recent years, the concept of multipoles has been widely used to describe and classify various magnetic and electric responses in solids, providing a systematic way to identify symmetry-allowed or -forbidden physical responses. Conventionally, multipole classifications rely on the magnetic point group of a system, which inherently incorporates the effects of relativistic spin-orbit coupling because the spin orientation is supposed to follow the point-group transformation of the lattice. However, this approach becomes insufficient in situations where relativistic spin-orbit coupling is negligibly weak or where the spin and orbital (lattice) degrees of freedom are decoupled, thereby requiring a more comprehensive symmetry description. In this work, we introduce a multipole description on the basis of the spin-point-group symmetries, enabling a systematic exploration of nonrelativistic phenomena that persist even without spin-orbit coupling in a collinear antiferromagnet. As an application, we theoretically demonstrate spin-current generation driven by elastic waves in a specific collinear antiferromagnet, fully independent of spin-orbit coupling.

Title: Influence of Exchange-Correlation Functionals and Neural Network Architectures on Li$^+$-Ion Conductivity in Solid-State Electrolyte from Molecular Dynamics Simulations with Machine-Learning Force Fields
Authors: Zicun Li, Huanjing Gong, Ruijuan Xiao, Xinguo Ren
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of machine learning techniques for materials simulations, machine-learned force fields (MLFFs) have become a powerful tool that complements first-principles calculations by enabling high-accuracy molecular dynamics simulations over extended timescales. Typically, MLFFs are trained on data generated from density functional theory (DFT) using a specific exchange-correlation (XC) functional, with the goal of reproducing DFT-level properties. However, the uncertainties in MLFF-based simulations--arising from variations in both MLFF model architectures and the choice of XC functionals--remain insufficiently understood. In this work, we construct MLFF models of different architectures trained on DFT data from both semilocal and hybrid functionals to describe Li$^+$ diffusion in the solid-state electrolyte Li$_6$PS$_5$Cl. We systematically investigate how different XC functionals influence the Li$^+$ diffusion coefficient. To reduce statistical uncertainty, the mean squared displacements are averaged over 300 independent molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories of 70 ps each, yielding statistical variations below $1\%$. This enables a clear assessment of the respective influences of the functional and the MLFF model. Due to its tendency to underestimate band gaps and migration barriers, the semilocal functional predicts consistently higher Li$^+$ diffusion coefficients, compared to the hybrid functional. Furthermore, comparisons among various neural network methods reveal that the differences in predicted diffusion coefficients arising from different network architectures are of the same order of magnitude as those caused by different functionals, indicating that the choice of the network model itself substantially influences the MLFF predictions. This observation calls from an urgent need for standardized protocols to minimize model-dependent biases in MLFF-based MD.

Title: Parity order as a fundamental driver of bosonic topology
Authors: Ashirbad Padhan, Harsh Nigam
Abstract: Symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases in interacting bosonic systems have been widely explored, yet most realizations rely on fine-tuned interactions or enlarged symmetries. Here we show that a qualitatively simpler mechanism--parity order coupled to bond dimerization--acts as a fundamental driver of bosonic topology. Using density matrix renormalization group simulations, we identify two distinct topological phases absent in the purely dimerized model: an SPT phase at half filling stabilized by positive parity coupling, and a topological phase at unit filling stabilized by negative coupling that can be adiabatically connected to a trivial phase without breaking any symmetry. Our results establish parity order as a new organizing principle for correlation-driven bosonic topology.

Title: Strong anchoring boundary conditions in nematic liquid crystals: Higher-order corrections to the Oseen-Frank limit and a revised small-domain theory
Authors: Prabakaran Rajamanickam
Abstract: Strong anchoring boundary conditions are conventionally modelled by imposing Dirichlet conditions on the order parameter in Landau-de Gennes theory, neglecting the finite surface energy of realistic anchoring. This work revisits the strong anchoring limit for nematic liquid crystals in confined two-dimensional domains. By explicitly retaining a Rapini-Papoular surface energy and adopting a scaling where the extrapolation length $l_{ex}$ is comparable to the coherence length $\xi$, we analyse both the small-domain ($\ep = h/\xi\to 0$; $h$ is the domain size) and Oseen-Frank $(\ep \to \infty$) asymptotic regimes. In the small-domain limit, the leading-order equilibrium solution is given by the average of the boundary data, which can vanish in symmetrically frustrated geometries, leading to isotropic melting. In the large-domain limit, matched asymptotic expansions reveal that surface anchoring introduces an $O(1/\ep)$ correction to the director field, in contrast to the $O(1/\ep^2)$ correction predicted by Dirichlet conditions. The analysis captures the detailed structure of interior and boundary defects, showing that mixed boundary conditions yield smoother defect cores and more physical predictions than rigid Dirichlet conditions. Importantly, a stability analysis based on the intrinsic-basis decomposition shows that even small deviations of $O(1/\ep^2)$ from perfect scalar order can destabilise some Oseen-Frank solutions, indicating that only a restricted subset of solutions are realised as stable equilibria in the full Landau-de Gennes theory. Numerical solutions for square and circular wells with tangential anchoring illustrate the differences between the two boundary condition treatments, particularly in defect morphology. These results demonstrate that a consistent treatment of anchoring energetics is essential for modelling nematic equilibria in micro- and nano-scale systems.

Title: Orbital Separation of Charge Order and Superconductivity in La$_{2-x}$Sr$_{x}$CuO$_4$
Authors: I. Biało, O. Gerguri, L. Martinelli, J. Küspert, J. Choi, M. Garcia-Fernandez, S. Agrestini, K. J. Zhou, E. Weschke, T. Kurosawa, N. Momono, M. Oda, C. Lin, Q. Wang, J. Chang
Abstract: We report a combined x-ray absorption (XAS) and oxygen $K$-edge resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) study of charge order in underdoped La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ ($x=0.125$) under uniaxial $c$-axis pressure. We find that compressive $c$-axis strain modifies the charge order only within the superconducting state, with a striking polarization dependence: suppression in the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ channel and enhancement in the $d_{z^2}$ channel. X-ray absorption spectra reveal concomitant strain-induced modifications of the oxygen pre-edge and upper Hubbard band, consistent with increased $d_{z^2}$ orbital admixture. Our results suggest that $c$-axis pressure drives an orbital separation between superconductivity, rooted in $d_{x^2-y^2}$ states, and charge order, which gradually shifts to the $d_{z^2}$ channel. This orbital separation reveals a way for superconductivity and charge order to coexist in the cuprates with minimal competition. Furthermore, it suggests that the multi-order phase diagram of La$_{2-x}$Sr$_{x}$CuO$_4$ cannot be realistically described within single band models usually used to describe cuprate physics.

Title: Competing Paramagnetic Phases in the Maple-Leaf Heisenberg Antiferromagnet
Authors: Paul L. Ebert, Yasir Iqbal, Alexander Wietek
Abstract: We establish a remarkably rich ground state phase diagram in the maple-leaf lattice spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet as a function of the three symmetry-inequivalent nearest-neighbor bonds using exact diagonalization and tower-of-states analysis on clusters up to $N=36$ sites. Besides a hexagonal plaquette state, a star-shaped valence bond solid state is discovered in close vicinity to the (canted) $120^\circ$ magnetic phase, strongly reminiscent of a de-confined critical point or Dirac spin liquid scenario on the triangular lattice antiferromagnets. Moreover, an exact dimer product-state is observed next to a collinear Néel-state, similar to the Shastry-Sutherland model. All identified phases compete in a parameter regime close to the isotropic point, providing a promising region for spin liquids to emerge. By analyzing Gutzwiller-projected wave-functions we identify a sliver of parameter regime where a gapped $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ spin liquid Ansatz is in astonishing agreement with the exact $N=36$ ground state. This rich competition of paramagnetic phases demonstrates that the maple-leaf antiferromagnet is a promising platform for exotic states of matter and quantum critical phenomena.

Title: Topological $Z_4$ spin-orbital liquid on the honeycomb lattice
Authors: Masahiko G. Yamada
Abstract: The density matrix renormalisation group (DMRG) is one of the most powerful numerical methods for strongly correlated condensed matter systems. We extend DMRG to the case with the $\mathrm{SU}(N_c)$ symmetry with $N_c > 2$, including two-dimensional systems. As a killer application, we simulate the ground state of the $\mathrm{SU}(4)$ Heisenberg model on the honeycomb lattice, which can potentially be realised in cold atomic systems and solid state systems like $\alpha$-ZrCl$_3$. We keep up to 12800 $\mathrm{SU}(4)$ states equivalent to more than a million $\mathrm{U}(1)$ states. This supermassive DMRG simulation reveals the quantum spin-orbital liquid ground state, which has been conjectured for more than a decade. The methodology developed here can be extended to any classical Lie groups, paving the way to a next-generation DMRG with a full symmetry implementation.

Title: A survey of active learning in materials science: Data-driven paradigm for accelerating the research pipeline
Authors: Jiaxin Chen, Tianjiao Wan, Hui Geng, Liang Xiong, Guohong Wang, Yihan Zhao, Longxiang Deng, Susu Fang, Zheng Luo, Huaimin Wang, Shanshan Wang, Kele Xu
Abstract: The exploration of materials composition, structure, and processing spaces is constrained by high dimensionality and the cost of data acquisition. While machine learning has supported property prediction and design, its effectiveness depends on labeled data, which remains expensive to generate via experiments or high-fidelity simulations. Improving data efficiency is thus a central concern in materials informatics. Active learning (AL) addresses this by coupling model training with adaptive data acquisition. Instead of static datasets, AL iteratively prioritizes candidates based on uncertainty, diversity, or task-specific objectives. By guiding data collection under limited budgets, AL offers a structured approach to decision-making, complementing physical insight with quantitative measures of informativeness. Recently, AL has been applied to computational simulation, structure optimization, and autonomous experimentation. However, the diversity of AL formulations has led to fragmented methodologies and inconsistent assessments. This Review provides a concise overview of AL methods in materials science, focusing on their role in improving data efficiency under realistic constraints. We summarize key methodological principles, representative applications, and persistent challenges, aiming to clarify the scope and limitations of AL as a practical tool within contemporary materials informatics.

Title: Largest connected component in duplication-divergence growing graphs with symmetric coupled divergence
Authors: Dario Borrelli
Abstract: The largest connected component in duplication-divergence growing graphs with symmetric coupled divergence is studied. Finite-size scaling reveals a phase transition occurring at a divergence rate $\delta_c$. The $\delta_c$ found stands near the locus of zero in Euler characteristic for finite-size graphs, known to be indicative of the largest connected component transition. The role of non-interacting vertices in shaping this transition, with their presence ($d=0$) and absence ($d=1$) in duplication is also discussed, suggesting a particular transformation of the time variable considered yielding a singularity locus in the natural logarithm of the absolute value of Euler characteristic in finite-size graphs close to that obtained with $d=1$ but from the model with $d=0$. The findings may suggest implications for bond percolation in these growing graph models.

Title: A Nonlinear Mechanism for Transient Anomalous Diffusion
Authors: Gabriel Barreiro, Vladimir Pérez-Veloz
Abstract: Diffusion is a fundamental physical phenomenon with critical applications in fields such as metallurgy, cell biology, and population dynamics. While standard diffusion is well-understood, anomalous diffusion often requires complex non-local models. This paper investigates a nonlinear diffusion equation where the diffusion coefficient is linearly dependent on concentration. We demonstrate through a perturbative analysis that this physically-grounded model exhibits transient anomalous diffusion. The system displays a clear crossover from an initial subdiffusive regime to standard Fickian behavior at long times. This result establishes an important mechanism for trasient anomalous diffusion that arises purely from local interactions, providing an intuitive alternative to models based on fractional calculus or non-local memory effects.

Title: Geometric dependence of exchange bias in tilted three-dimensional CoFe/IrMn microwires
Authors: Balram Singh, Aman Singh, Stefan Mikulik, Jakub Jurczyk, Volker Neu, Amalio Fernández-Pacheco
Abstract: The exchange bias (EB) effect, arising from interfacial coupling between ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AF) layers, induces a unidirectional magnetic anisotropy and underpins a wide range of spintronic functionalities. Extending the EB effect to three-dimensional (3D) architectures enables investigation of interfacial coupling in non-planar structures, which is a key step toward realizing spintronic functionalities beyond planar systems. Achieving this requires the fabrication of FM/AF bilayers with smooth interfaces and well-defined thicknesses on non-planar scaffolds, together with suitable characterization methods. In this work, we realize exchange-biased 3D FM/AF microwires by combining two-photon lithography with magnetron sputtering. CoFe/IrMn bilayers are deposited on microwire scaffolds with inclination angles of 0 deg, 30 deg, 45 deg relative to the substrate, and their magnetization reversal is probed using dark-field magneto-optical Kerr effect (DF-MOKE) magnetometry. We find that the EB and coercive fields vary in a characteristic way with the inclination angle, consistent with the systematic reduction in film thickness expected from inclined directional deposition. In addition, the EB magnitude is influenced by the combined effects of surface roughness of non-planar geometries and the directional growth of the bilayer, highlighting the importance of 3D scaffold surface quality for integrating magnetic multilayers. These results provide insight into the growth and magnetic behavior of sputter-deposited magnetic multilayers with functional interfaces on 3D geometries.

Title: Revisiting Jahn--Teller Transitions in Correlated Oxides with Monte Carlo Modeling
Authors: Liam A. V. Nagle-Cocco, Andrew L. Goodwin, Clare P. Grey, Siân E. Dutton
Abstract: Jahn--Teller (JT) distortions are a key driver of physical properties in many correlated oxide materials. Cooperative JT distortions, in which long-range orbital order reduces the symmetry of the average structure macroscopically, are common in JT-distorted materials at low temperatures. This long-range order will often melt on heating, \textit{via} a transition to a high-temperature state without long-range orbital order. The nature of this transition has been observed to vary with different materials depending on crystal structure; in LaMnO$_3$ the transition has generally been interpreted as order-disorder, whereas in layered nickelates $A$NiO$_2$ ($A$=Li,Na) there is a displacive transition. Alternatively, recent theoretical work has suggested that previous attributions of order-disorder may in fact be a consequence of phonon anharmonicity, rather than persistence of JT distortions, which would suggest that the displacive transition may be more common than currently believed. In this work, we run Monte Carlo simulations with a simple Hamiltonian which is modified to include terms dependent on the JT amplitude $\rho$, which is allowed to vary within the simulation \textit{via} the Metropolis algorithm. Our simulations yield distributions of JT amplitudes consistent with displacive rather than order-disorder behaviour for both perovskites and layered nickelates, suggesting that displacive-like JT transitions may be more common than previously assumed in both perovskites and layered nickelates. We also find significant differences between the transition observed for perovskites compared with layered nickelates, which we attribute to differing extensivity of configurational entropy on the two lattices, showing the crucial role of lattice geometry in determining behaviour.

Title: Quantum Analog of Vicsek Model for Active Matter
Authors: Hong Yuan (1), L.X. Cui (2), L.T. Chen (3), C.P. Sun (1) ((1) Graduate School of CAEP, Beijing, China, (2) Beijing Computational Science Research Center, Beijing, China, (3) Department of Mathematics and Centre of Complexity Science, Imperial College London, South Kensington, London, United Kingdom)
Abstract: We propose a quantum model consisting of an ensemble of overdamped spin$-1/2$ particles with ferromagnetic couplings, driven by a radially homogeneous magnetic field. The spontaneous magnetization of the spin components breaks the $SO(3)$ (or $SO(2)$) symmetry, inducing an ordered phase of flocking. Our model converges to the Vicsek model in the classical limit and corresponds to the Toner-Tu model in the continuous limit. Our investigation not only elucidates the intrinsic connection between these two models, but also introduces new opportunities for exploring the mechanisms underlying flocking order and correlations at the quantum level, which maybe pave the way for a new field of research -- the quantum active matter.

Title: Long-range optomechanical interactions in SiN membrane arrays
Authors: Xiong Yao, Matthijs H. J. de Jong, Jie Li, Simon Gröblacher
Abstract: Optomechanical systems using a membrane-in-the-middle configuration can exhibit a long-range type of interaction similar to how atoms show collective motion in an optical potential. Photons bounce back and forth inside a high-finesse Fabry-Pérot cavity and mediate the interaction between multiple membranes over a significant distance compared to the wavelength. Recently, it has been demonstrated that off-resonant coupling between light and the inter-membrane cavity can lead to coherent mechanical noise cancellation. On-resonance coupling of light with both the Fabry-Pérot and inter-membrane cavities, predicted to enhance the single photon optomechanical coupling, have to date not been experimentally demonstrated, however. In our experiment, a double-membrane system inside a Fabry-Pérot cavity resonantly enhances the cavity field, resulting in a stronger optomechanical coupling strength from the increased radiation pressure. The resonance condition is first identified by analyzing the slope of the dispersion relation. Then, the optomechanical coupling is determined at various chip positions over one wavelength range. The optimum coupling conditions are obtained and enhancement is demonstrated for double membrane arrays with three different reflectivites, reaching nearly four-fold enhancement for the collective motion of $R=65\%$ double membranes. The cavity losses at the optimum coupling are also characterized and the potential of reaching the single-photon strong coupling regime is discussed.

Abstract: The efficacy of mathematical models heavily depends on the quality of the training data, yet collecting sufficient data is often expensive and challenging. Many modeling applications require inferring parameters only as a means to predict other quantities of interest (QoI). Because models often contain many unidentifiable (sloppy) parameters, QoIs often depend on a relatively small number of parameter combinations. Therefore, we introduce an information-matching criterion based on the Fisher Information Matrix to select the most informative training data from a candidate pool. This method ensures that the selected data contain sufficient information to learn only those parameters that are needed to constrain downstream QoIs. It is formulated as a convex optimization problem, making it scalable to large models and datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach across various modeling problems in diverse scientific fields, including power systems and underwater acoustics. Finally, we use information-matching as a query function within an Active Learning loop for material science applications. In all these applications, we find that a relatively small set of optimal training data can provide the necessary information for achieving precise predictions. These results are encouraging for diverse future applications, particularly active learning in large machine learning models.

Title: Rational RG flow, extension, and Witt class
Authors: Ken Kikuchi
Abstract: Consider a renormalization group flow preserving a pre-modular fusion category $\mathcal S_1$. If it flows to a rational conformal field theory, the surviving symmetry $\mathcal S_1$ flows to a pre-modular fusion category $\mathcal S_2$ with monoidal functor $F:\mathcal S_1\to\mathcal S_2$. By clarifying mathematical (especially category theoretical) meaning of renormalization group domain wall/interface or boundary condition, we find the hidden extended vertex operator (super)algebra gives a unique (up to braided equivalence) completely $(\mathcal S_1\boxtimes\mathcal S_2)'$-anisotropic representative of the Witt equivalence class $[\mathcal S_1\boxtimes\mathcal S_2]$. The mathematical conjecture is supported physically, and passes various tests in concrete examples including non/unitary minimal models, and Wess-Zumino-Witten models. In particular, the conjecture holds beyond diagonal cosets. The picture also establishes the conjectured half-integer condition, which fixes infrared conformal dimensions mod $\frac12$. It further leads to the double braiding relation, namely braiding structures jump at conformal fixed points. As an application, we solve the flow from the $E$-type minimal model $(A_{10},E_6)\to M(4,3)$.

Title: Chemistry in a Cryogenic Buffer Gas Cell
Authors: Qi Sun, Jinyu Dai, Rian Koots, Benjamin C. Riley, Jesús Pérez-Ríos, Debayan Mitra, Tanya Zelevinsky
Abstract: Cryogenic buffer gas sources are ubiquitous for producing cold, collimated molecular beams for quantum science, chemistry, and precision measurements. The molecules are typically produced by laser ablating a metal target in the presence of a donor gas. The radical of interest emerges due to a barrier-free reaction or under thermal or optical excitation. High-barrier reactions, such as between Ca and H$_2$, should be precluded. We study chemical reactions between Ca and three hydrogen isotopologues H$_2$, D$_2$, and HD in a cryogenic cell with helium buffer gas. We observe that H$_2$ can serve as both a reactant and a buffer gas, outperforming D$_2$ and HD. We use a reaction network model to describe the chemical dynamics and find that the enhanced molecular yield can be attributed to rapid vibrational excitations of the reactant gas. Our results demonstrate a robust method for generating bright cold beams of alkaline-earth-metal hydrides for laser cooling and trapping.

Authors: Henri Lyyra, Cliona Shakespeare, Simeoni Ahopelto, Teemu Loippo, Alberto Hijano, Reetu Inkilä, Pyry Runko, Tero T. Heikkilä, Juha T. Muhonen
Abstract: Silicon is the foundation of current information technology, and a promising platform for future quantum information technology as silicon-based qubits exhibit some of the longest coherence times in solid-state. At the same time, silicon is the underlying material for advanced photonics activity, and photonics structures in silicon can be used to define optomechanical cavities where the vibrations of nanoscale mechanical resonators can be probed down to the quantum level with laser light. Here, we propose to bring all these developments together by coupling silicon donor spins into optomechanical structures. We show theoretically and numerically that this allows telecom wavelength optical readout of the spin-qubits and implementing high-fidelity entangling two-qubit gates between donor spins that are spatially separated by tens of micrometers. We present an optimized geometry of the proposed device and discuss with the help of numerical simulations the predicted performance of the proposed quantum bus. We analyze the optomechanical spin readout fidelity and find the optimal donor species for different coupling mechanisms.

Title: Resonant fragility and nonresonant robustness of Floquet eigenstates in kicked spin systems
Authors: Jesús A. Segura-Landa, Meenu Kumari, Daniel J. Nader, Sercan Hüsnügil, Ali SaraerToosi, Sergio Lerma-Hernández
Abstract: In classical systems, the Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM) theorem establishes that resonant tori of integrable Hamiltonians are destroyed by any nonintegrable perturbation, whereas nonresonant tori are only deformed up to a finite value of the perturbation parameter. In this contribution, we identify a quantum analog of this differentiated sensitivity for one-degree-of-freedom spin Hamiltonians subject to periodic instantaneous kicks. After detecting quantum signatures of resonances in the participation ratio and in the quasiprobability phase-space distribution of Floquet eigenstates of the perturbed Hamiltonian, we show that eigenstates of the unperturbed Hamiltonian exhibit greater sensitivity against the perturbation when they satisfy a resonant condition. The sensitivity is quantified through the fidelity between perturbed and unperturbed eigenstates. This differentiated sensitivity becomes increasingly pronounced as the system size grows. Our findings are supported by numerical results and insights from analytical calculations based on unitary perturbation theory. Although our analysis focuses on kicked models, the mechanism could be extended to more general periodic drivings, providing a preliminary step toward a quantum counterpart of the classical breaking of resonant tori.

Title: Magnetic Thomas-Fermi theory for 2D abelian anyons
Authors: Antoine Levitt (LMO), Douglas Lundholm, Nicolas Rougerie (UMPA-ENSL)
Abstract: Two-dimensional abelian anyons are, in the magnetic gauge picture, represented as fermions coupled to magnetic flux tubes. For the ground state of such a system in a trapping potential, we theoretically and numerically investigate a Hartree approximate model, obtained by restricting trial states to Slater determinants and introducing a self-consistent magnetic field, locally proportional to matter density. This leads to a fermionic variant of the Chern-Simons-Schr{ö}dinger system. We find that for dense systems, a semi-classical approximation yields qualitatively good results. Namely, we derive a density functional theory of magnetic Thomas-Fermi type, which correctly captures the trends of our numerical results. In particular, we explore the subtle dependence of the ground state with respect to the fraction of magnetic flux units attached to particles.

Title: Reversible grain boundary complexion transition explains cratonic lithosphere anomalies
Authors: Alexandra C. Austin, Sanae Koizumi, Martin Folwarczny, David P. Dobson, Katharina Marquardt
Abstract: Olivine comprises approximately 70 $\%$ by volume of the Earth's upper mantle, making it likely that it controls the mechanical, electrical and seismic properties of the upper mantle. All rocks are composed of crystals separated by grain boundaries, which affect their overall conductivity, strength and viscosity. Here, we present a study of forsterite (Mg$_{2}$SiO$_{4}$) polycrystals synthesised between 1150 $^{\circ}$C and 1390 $^{\circ}$C to obtain samples with different grain sizes. The grain boundary plane distributions (GBPD) were analysed by SEM and EBSD. A reversible change in the GBPD is observed between 1290 $^{\circ}$C and 1390 $^{\circ}$C. The GBPD shows that the most commonly occurring grain boundary planes are {0kl}-type at 1290 $^{\circ}$C and below, while at 1390 $^{\circ}$C, (010) grain boundary planes dominate the average crystal habitus. The least common planes at all temperatures are (100). This reversible transition in the dominant grain boundary plane type is evidence for a temperature-dependent complexion transition occurring between 1290 $^{\circ}$C and 1390 $^{\circ}$C. It is well established that different grain boundary crystallographies are related to different grain boundary properties. We relate the observed grain boundary complexion transition to differences in grain boundary properties observed in previous studies and suggest their influence on bulk rock properties.

Title: On the generic increase of entropy in isolated systems
Authors: Zhiqiang Huang, Qing-yu Cai
Abstract: This study establishes a universal mechanism for entropy production in isolated quantum systems governed by interactions that induce random-phase fluctuations. By developing a resolvent-based framework, we demonstrate that steady-state entropy generically arises from many-body interactions, independent of specific coupling details, provided the coherent accumulation of systematic biases does not overwhelm the random-phase fluctuations. Analytical arguments reveal that entropy generation is driven by two universal pathways: interaction-induced energy broadening and temporal coarse-graining over exponentially small energy gaps. To quantitatively capture the probability distribution, we introduce a hierarchical ansatz approach. A Lorentzian ansatz models the bulk region, leading to self-consistent equations for the broadening and shift parameters, and yields a logarithmic entropy scaling with interaction strength. For the tail behavior, a Gaussian ansatz is formulated, and the corresponding self-consistent condition is derived and validated. By further combining these profiles into an enhanced Lorentzian-Gaussian hybrid ansatz, we achieve a unified and refined description of the full distribution. Numerical simulations of nonintegrable Ising spin chains confirm the predicted logarithmic entropy scaling and validate the self-consistent equations. Our framework effectively bridges the concepts of observational entropy and von Neumann entropy dynamics, providing predictive tools for thermodynamic behavior in quantum many-body systems. These results resolve longstanding debates about interaction-dependent entropy scaling and offer pathways for entropy control in quantum technologies.

Title: Exploiting emergent symmetries in disorder-averaged quantum dynamics
Authors: Mirco Erpelding, Adrian Braemer, Martin Gärttner
Abstract: Symmetries are a key tool in understanding quantum systems, and, among many other things, can be exploited to increase the efficiency of numerical simulations of quantum dynamics. Disordered systems usually feature reduced symmetries and additionally require averaging over many realizations, making their numerical study computationally demanding. However, when studying quantities linear in the time-evolved state, i.e. expectation values of observables, one can apply the averaging procedure to the time evolution operator, resulting in an effective dynamical map, which restores symmetry at the level of superoperators. In this work, we develop schemes for efficiently constructing symmetric sectors of the disorder-averaged dynamical map using short-time and weak-disorder expansions. To benchmark the method, we apply it to an Ising model with random all-to-all interactions in the presence of a transverse field. After disorder averaging, this system becomes effectively permutation-invariant, and thus the size of the symmetric subspace scales polynomially in the number of spins allowing for the simulation of large systems.

Title: Quantum circuit complexity and unsupervised machine learning of topological order
Authors: Yanming Che, Clemens Gneiting, Xiaoguang Wang, Franco Nori
Abstract: Inspired by the close relationship between Kolmogorov complexity and unsupervised machine learning, we explore quantum circuit complexity, an important concept in quantum computation and quantum information science, as a pivot to understand and to build interpretable and efficient unsupervised machine learning for topological order in quantum many-body systems. We argue that Nielsen's quantum circuit complexity represents an intrinsic topological distance between topological quantum many-body phases of matter, and as such plays a central role in interpretable manifold learning of topological order. To span a bridge from conceptual power to practical applicability, we present two theorems that connect Nielsen's quantum circuit complexity for the quantum path planning between two arbitrary quantum many-body states with quantum Fisher complexity (Bures distance) and entanglement generation, respectively. Leveraging these connections, fidelity-based and entanglement-based similarity measures or kernels, which are more practical for implementation, are formulated. Using the two proposed distance measures, unsupervised manifold learning of quantum phases of the bond-alternating XXZ spin chain, the ground state of Kitaev's toric code and random product states, is conducted, demonstrating their superior performance. Moreover, we find that the entanglement-based approach, which captures the long-range structure of quantum entanglement of topological orders, is more robust to local Haar random noises. Relations with classical shadow tomography and shadow kernel learning are also discussed, where the latter can be naturally understood from our approach. Our results establish connections between key concepts and tools of quantum circuit computation, quantum complexity, quantum metrology, and machine learning of topological quantum order.

Title: Systematic Study of Amorphous ABC Heterostructures at the Atomic Scale as a Second-Order Nonlinear Optical Metamaterial
Authors: Martin Mičulka, Jinsong Liu, Sebastian Beer, Raihan Rafi, Denys Sevriukov, Sergiy Yulin, Vladimir Roddatis, Stephan Gierth, Stefan Nolte, Sven Schröder, Isabelle Staude, Andreas Tünnermann, Adriana Szeghalmi
Abstract: Systematic exploration of amorphous ABC heterostructures revealed that nanoscale morphological modifications markedly improved their artificial bulk second-order susceptibility. These amorphous birefringent heterostructures were fabricated through plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition of three oxides, effectively breaking the centrosymmetry on the nanoscale. We observe a dependence of the optical nonlinearity on the thickness variation of three constituent materials, SiO$_2$, TiO$_2$, and Al$_2$O$_3$, ranging from tens of nanometers to the atomic scale, and these thin films exhibit second-order susceptibility at their interfaces. Our findings reveal that the enhancement of nonlinear optical properties is strongly correlated with a high density of layers and superior interface quality, where the interface second-order nonlinearity transitions to bulk-like second-harmonic generation. An effective bulk second-order susceptibility of $\chi_{zzz} = 2.0 \pm 0.2$~pm/V at the wavelength of 1032~nm is achieved, comparable to typical values for conventional monocrystalline nonlinear materials.

Title: Systems with Quantum Dimensions
Authors: Mikołaj Myszkowski, Mattia Damia Paciarini, Francesco Sannino
Abstract: We propose quantum-mechanical systems in which the number of spatial dimensions is promoted to a dynamical quantum variable, making the effective dimension state-dependent. Interestingly, systems of this form can exhibit enhanced symmetries compared to their fixed-dimensional counterparts. As an explicit example, we analyze a two-state system for which the number of spatial dimensions is represented by a quantum operator. By evaluating the corresponding partition function, we uncover a temperature-dependent effective dimension. Our framework opens a new avenue for constructing physical systems, from gravity to condensed matter, where the very notion of dimensionality becomes quantum.

Title: Spectroscopy of Quantum Phase Slips: Visualizing Complex Real-Time Instantons
Authors: Foster Thompson, Daniel K. J. Boneß, Mark Dykman, Alex Kamenev
Abstract: Parametrically driven oscillators can emerge as a basis for the next generation of qubits. Classically, these systems exhibit two stable oscillatory states with opposite phases. Upon quantization, these states turn into a pair of closely spaced Floquet states, which can serve as the logical basis for a qubit. However, interaction with the environment induces phase-slip events which set a limit on qubit coherence. Such phase slips persist even at zero temperature due to a mechanism known as quantum activation \cite{QuantumActivation}. In contrast to conventional tunneling, the quantum activation is described by a {\em real-time} instanton trajectory in the complexified phase space of the system. In this work, we show that the phase-slip rate is exponentially sensitive to weak AC perturbations. The spectrum of the system's response -- captured by the so-called logarithmic susceptibility (LS) -- enables a direct observation of characteristic features of real-time instantons. Studying this spectrum suggests new means of efficient qubit control.

Title: Hidden long-range correlations in the ion distribution at the graphite / [bmim][NTf$_2$] electrified interface
Authors: Diego Veloza-Diaz, Robinson Cortes-Huerto, Pietro Ballone, Nancy C. Forero-Martinez
Abstract: A capacitor consisting of the [bmim][NTf$_2$] ionic liquid (IL) confined in between planar graphite electrodes has been investigated by molecular dynamics based on an all-atom, unpolarizable force field. Despite a few peculiarities due to the size and complexity of the ions, properties such as the density of ions throughout the capacitor, the screening of the surface charge on the electrodes by the IL and exact sum rules for the radial distribution functions of cations and anions generally comply with the results of time honored theories of the electrostatic double layer. This soothing regularity may conceal hidden correlations still compatible with the static screening rules, propagating far inside the IL the information on the state of charge of the capacitor. Evidence in this respect might have been detected by vibrational spectroscopy (see, for instance, Langmuir 2021, vol. 37, 5193-5201) showing changes in optical properties of the IL far from the charged electrodes. We show that grouping the [bmim]$^+$ and [NTf$_2$]$^-$ ions into instantaneous neutral pairs reveals an intriguing long range ordering of ions normal to the interface, driven by the capacitor state of charge. These correlations manifest themselves through the parallel orientation of the dipole moments of the neutral ion pairs. We speculate that this effect changes the average intensity of fluctuating electric fields deep in the IL, while average, static fields vanish in agreement with well established screening laws. This effect, which could change the spectroscopic properties of the IL, is present in the simulated [bmim][NTf$_2$] / graphite capacitor, but too small to be unambiguously confirmed by the present simulations with a safe margin over the error bar. The conceptual interest in these effects, however, will motivate further studies of the same or similar electrode / ionic liquid interfaces.
