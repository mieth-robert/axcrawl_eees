Title: The Preservation Tradeoff: A Thermodynamic Bound in the Diminishing-Returns Regime
Authors: Amadeus Brandes
Abstract: Thermodynamic systems that preserve information against thermal fluctuations face a tradeoff distinct from transmission (Shannon) or erasure (Landauer). We establish a feasibility condition for this preservation problem within a broad class of systems exhibiting diminishing returns in error suppression. By defining the preservation stiffness S_kappa, a response function analogous to magnetic susceptibility, we derive an optimality condition linking S_kappa to the resource odds. This identity provides a substrate-agnostic diagnostic: deviations reveal thermodynamic inefficiency or operation outside the smooth reliability regime. For systems in the diminishing-returns regime -- a class we argue is typical of physically realistic error-correction -- the optimal maintenance allocation is bounded above by 50%; for the physically significant subclass exhibiting smooth saturation, it is further constrained to a 30-50% band. We derive this regime from two independent physical principles -- Shannon's channel capacity and Landauer's erasure bound -- whose convergence on the same functional form constitutes our central theoretical contribution. We validate this framework against kinetic proofreading data in E. coli and protocol overhead in TCP/IP networks, and specify conditions under which the prediction is falsifiable.

Title: Mechanics of hierarchical twisted and coiled polymer artificial muscles: Decoupling force from kinematic limits
Authors: Ye Xiao, Zhao Luo, Falin Tian, Xinghao Hu, Dabiao Liu, Chun Li
Abstract: Thermally actuated twisted and coiled polymer (TCP) artificial muscles exhibit exceptional specific work capacities but are limited by an inherent competition between load-bearing capacity and actuation stroke. To address this limitation, we investigate a hierarchical helical structure designed to decouple force generation from kinematic limits. We propose a coupled thermo-mechanical model incorporating inter-filamentary contact mechanics and geometric nonlinearities to predict the assembly's equilibrium response. The results indicate that this hierarchical topology significantly amplifies isometric actuation stress compared to monofilament baselines, while maintaining a biological-like contraction stroke of approximately 22%. A critical topological threshold governed by the balance between cooperative load-sharing and geometric confinement is identified. Beyond an optimal bundle complexity, the geometric jamming dominates, as excessive inter-filamentary friction hinders actuation. Furthermore, we elucidate a stiffness-stroke synergy in homochiral configurations, where high helical angles amplify the thermal untwisting torque to overcome increased structural rigidity. Crucially, the volumetric energy density exhibits scale invariance regarding the hierarchical radius, implying that absolute force output can be linearly scaled through geometric upsizing without compromising efficiency. These findings provide a mechanics-based rationale for the structural programming, demonstrating that soft actuator performance limits are dictated by topological order rather than intrinsic material properties.

Title: Temperature dependence of electronic conductivity from ab initio thermal simulation
Authors: Ridwan Hussein, Chinonso Ugwumadu, Kishor Nepal, Roxanne M. Tutchton, Keerti Kappagantula, David Alan Drabold
Abstract: We present a temperature-dependent extension of the approximate electronic conductivity formula of Hindley and Mott that leverages time-averaged fluctuations of the electronic density of states obtained from ab initio molecular dynamics. By thermally averaging the square of the density of states near the Fermi level, we obtain an estimate of the temperature dependence of the conductivity. This approach termed the thermally-averaged Hindley-Mott (TAHM) method was applied to five representative systems: crystalline aluminum (c-Al), aluminum with a grain boundary (AlGB), a four-layer graphene-aluminum composite (Al-Gr), amorphous silicon (a-Si) and amorphous germanium-antimony-telluride (a-GST). The method reproduces the expected Bloch-Gruneisen decrease in conductivity for c-Al and AlGB. Generally, the reduction (increase) in conductivity for metallic (semiconducting) materials are reproduced. It captures microstructure-induced, thermally activated conduction in multilayer Al-Gr, a-Si and a-GST. Overall, the approach provides a computationally efficient link between time-dependent electronic structure and temperature-dependent transport, offering a simple and approximate tool for exploring electronic conductivity trends in complex and disordered materials.

Title: Novel non-thermal Ablation Mechanics in the Laser Ablation of Silicon
Authors: Dominic Klein, Simon Kümmel, Johannes Roth
Abstract: We investigate the non-thermal material dynamics of strongly excited silicon during ultra-fast laser ablation. In contrast to metals, silicon shows strongly excitation-dependent interatomic bonding strengths, which gives rise to a number of unique material dynamics like non-thermal melting, Coulomb explosions and altered carrier heat conduction due to charge carrier confinement. In this study, we report novel non-thermal ablation mechanisms in the ultra-fast single shot laser ablation of silicon and perform large scale massive multi-parallel simulations on experimentally achievable length scales with atomistic resolution. For this, we model the ultra-fast carrier dynamics utilizing the Thermal-Spike-Model coupled to Molecular Dynamics simulations and include the accompanied excitation-dependent nonthermal bonding strength manipulation by application of the excitation-dependent modified Tersoff Potential. Further, we present first results on the systematic construction of the excitation-dependent phase diagram of silicon by thermodynamic integration.

Title: Robust flat bands of the honeycomb wire network
Authors: Chunxiao Liu, Benoît Douçot, Jérôme Cayssol
Abstract: We show that periodic honeycomb networks of ballistic conducting channels generically host exact flat bands spanning the entire Brillouin zone. These flat bands are independent of microscopic vertex scattering, persist for any number of transverse modes, and occur in a universal $1\colon 2$ ratio with dispersive bands. Their existence is enforced by local $D_3$ vertex symmetry and lattice translations. We construct compact localized states obeying a Bohr-Sommerfeld-type quantization condition and demonstrate that flat bands survive in realistic antidot lattices, establishing honeycomb wire networks as a robust flat band platform relevant to gated high-mobility 2D electron gases and molecule-patterned metallic surfaces.

Title: A Nonequilibrium Equation of State for a Turbulent 2D Bose Gas
Authors: Yi Jiang, Nikolai Maslov, Andrey Karailiev, Christoph Eigen, Martin Gazo, Zoran Hadzibabic
Abstract: Nonequilibrium equations of state can provide an effective thermodynamic-like description of far-from-equilibrium systems. We experimentally construct such an equation for a direct energy cascade in a turbulent two-dimensional Bose gas. Our homogeneous gas is continuously driven on a large length scale and, with matching dissipation on a small length scale, exhibits a nonthermal but stationary power-law momentum distribution. Our equation of state links the cascade amplitude with the underlying scale-invariant energy flux, and can, for different drive strengths, gas densities, and interaction strengths, be recast into a universal power-law form using scalings consistent with the Gross-Pitaevskii model.

Abstract: In this work we present a cavity-enhanced InAs/$\mathrm{In_{0.53}Al_{0.23}Ga_{0.24}As}$ quantum dot (QD) single-photon source in the telecom C-band with a record-low biexciton emitter decay time of \SI{67.4(2)}{ps} under resonant two-photon excitation (TPE). We observe strong multiphoton suppression associated with $g^{(2)}_\mathrm{X}(0) = 0.006(1)$ and $g^{(2)}_\mathrm{XX}(0) = 0.007(1)$ for the exciton (X) and biexciton (XX) emission, respectively. Due to a asymmetric Purcell enhancement of the XX-X cascade, the two-photon interference (TPI) visibility of XX photons under $\pi$-pulse excitation of $V_{\rm{TPI}} = 90(3)\%$ reaches the theoretical limit and clearly exceeds the $\sim60\%$ expected for standard XX-X cascades without photonic engineering. Furthermore, adding a second timed laser pulse coinciding with XX emission energy, we demonstrate stimulated TPE in the telecom C-Band. The result is an improved TPI visibility of the X photons of $V_{\rm{TPI}}=0.69(3)$ compared to TPE with $V_{\rm{TPI}}=0.61(4)$, with both being reduced compared to the theoretical values due to present dephasing effects. The advances presented in this work hold important promises for the implementation of advanced schemes of quantum communication using deterministic quantum light sources.

Title: Mobile impurity interacting with a Hubbard chain and the role of Friedel oscillations
Authors: Felipe Isaule, Abel Rojo-Francàs, Duc Tuan Hoang, Thomás Fogarty, Thomas Busch, Bruno Juliá-Díaz
Abstract: This work examines a mobile impurity interacting with a bath of a few spin-$\uparrow$ and spin-$\downarrow$ fermions in a small one-dimensional open lattice system. We study ground-state properties using the exact diagonalization method, where the system is modeled by a three-component Fermi Hubbard Hamiltonian. We find that in addition to the standard phase separation between a strongly repulsive impurity and the bath, a strongly-attractive impurity also phase separates with the fermionic holes. Furthermore, we find that the impurity can show an oscillatory pattern in its density for intermediate bath-impurity interactions, which are induced by Friedel oscillations in the fermionic bath. This rich behavior of the impurity could be probed with fermionic ultracold mixtures in optical lattices.

Title: Engineering altermagnetic symmetry to enable anomalous Hall response in Cr$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$Sb
Authors: Miriam G. Fischer, Lukas Odenbreit, Olena Gomonay, Jairo Sinova, Thibaud Denneulin, Joseph V. Vaz, Rafal E. Dunin-Borkowski, Tommy Kotte, Toni Helm, Mathias Kläui, Martin Jourdan
Abstract: Altermagnets are a promising class of materials for spintronic applications. However, compounds that simultaneously combine the symmetry required to support an anomalous Hall effect with good metallic conductivity and magnetic ordering temperatures well above room temperature remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate that partial substitution of Cr by Mn in epitaxial CrSb(100) thin films provides a viable route to engineer the combined structural and magnetic symmetry necessary to enable an otherwise symmetry-forbidden anomalous Hall effect. By systematically exploring the magnetic phase diagram Cr$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$Sb thin films, we identify a pronounced anomalous Hall effect in Cr$_{0.75}$Mn$_{0.25}$Sb. Guided by Landau theory, we model the field-driven reorientation of the Néel vector and the resulting anomalous Hall response, achieving good qualitative agreement with the experimental observations.

Title: Elastoplastic Modelling of Cyclic Shear Deformation of Amorphous Solids
Authors: Pushkar Khandare, Srikanth Sastry
Abstract: We develop an energy-landscape based elasto-plastic model to understand the behaviour of amorphous solids under uniform and cyclic shear. Amorphous solids are modeled as being composed of mesoscopic sub-volumes, each of which may occupy states - termed mesostates -- drawn from a specified distribution. The energies of the mesostates under stress free conditions determine their stability range with respect to applied strain, and their plastic strain, at which they are stress free, forms an important additional property. Under applied global strain, mesostates that reach their stability limits transition to other permissible mesostates. Barring such transitions, which encompass plastic deformations that the solid may undergo, mesostates are treated as exhibiting linear elastic behavior, and the interactions between mesoscopic blocks are treated using the finite element method. The model reproduces known phenomena under uniform and cyclic shear, such as the brittle-to-ductile crossover with annealing and the Bauschinger effect for uniform shear, qualitative features of the yielding diagram under cyclic shear including the change in yielding behaviour with the degree of annealing, across a `threshold level', and dynamic phenomena such as the divergence of failure times on approach to the yield point and the non-monotonic evolution of the local yield rate. In addition to these results, we discuss the dependence of the observed behaviour on model choices, and open questions highlighted by our work.

Title: Enhanced Elevated-Temperature Strength in Refractory Complex Concentrated Alloys via Temperature-Induced Transition from Screw-to-Edge Dislocation Control
Authors: Tamanna Zakia, Ayeman Nahin, Dunji Yu, Jacob Pustelnik, Juntan Li, Mason Kincheloe, Lia Amalia, Yan Chen, Peter K. Liaw, Haixuan Xu, Mingwei Zhang
Abstract: Refractory complex concentrated alloys (RCCAs) show promise for high-temperature applications but often lose strength due to screw-dislocation-controlled plasticity. We demonstrate a temperature-driven transition from screw- to edge-dislocation-controlled deformation in a single-phase NbTaTiV RCCA. Tensile tests from 298-1573 K reveal a pronounced intermediate-temperature strength plateau and yield strengths surpassing other ductile RCCAs and the Ni-based superalloy CMSX-4 above 1273 K. In-situ neutron diffraction, TEM, and molecular dynamics identify a crossover near ~900 K, where edge dislocation glide stabilized by V-induced lattice distortion dominates, enabling enhanced strength retention and a clear design strategy for ultrahigh-temperature applications.

Title: Magnon-Mediated Superconductivity in the Infinite-$U$ Triangular Lattice
Authors: Hantian Zhu, Yixin Zhang, Shang-Shun Zhang, Yang Zhang, Cristian D. Batista
Abstract: We demonstrate that the infinite-$U$ triangular-lattice Hubbard model supports a superconducting state built from tightly bound Cooper pairs composed of two holes and one magnon ($2h1m$). Building on the seminal prediction of repulsively bound $2h1m$ states, we show that next-nearest-neighbor hopping $t_{2}$ coherently mixes symmetry-related configurations, stabilizing an $s$-wave bound state with substantial binding energy and a light effective mass. Large-scale DMRG calculations at finite doping identify a magnetization plateau corresponding to a gas of such bound states and quasi--long--range superconducting order with power-law $2h1m$ pair correlations. Our results establish a magnon-mediated superconducting mechanism driven by kinetic frustration, with immediate detectable signatures for moiré Hubbard materials and ultracold-atom simulators.

Title: Thin-Film Stabilization and Magnetism in η-Carbide Type Iron Nitrides
Authors: Baptiste Julien, Abrar Rauf, Rebecca W. Smaha, Liam A. V. Nagle-Cocco, Wenhao Sun, Andriy Zakutayev, Sage R. Bauers
Abstract: Transition-metal nitrides in {\eta}-carbide type structures exhibit unusual bonding motifs and proximity to magnetic instabilities. Yet they remain unexplored in thin-film form due to the difficulty of stabilizing nitrogen-poor ternaries among competing phases. Here, we report the thin-film synthesis and phase-stability mapping of the {\eta}-nitride systems Fe-W-N and Fe-Mo-N. Amorphous Fe-M-N (M = W, Mo) combinatorial libraries deposited by reactive co-sputtering crystallize upon rapid thermal annealing, enabling systematic identification of synthesis windows as a function of composition and annealing temperature. Using laboratory powder X-ray diffraction and synchrotron grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering, we establish that Fe3Mo3N-based {\eta}-carbide phases form over a substantially broader compositional and thermal range than W-based compositions, where {\eta}-structures are stabilized only when the films are Fe-rich. These trends are rationalized using mixed chemical-potential vs. composition phase diagrams that capture the narrow nitrogen chemical-potential stability of {\eta}-nitrides. Magnetic measurements reveal that ferromagnetism is induced in Fe-rich Fe3.54Mo2.46N with a small exchange-bias-like response that is absent in Fe3W3N-based compositions, highlighting the sensitivity of magnetic behavior to modest deviations from stoichiometry. This work establishes practical thin-film synthesis routes for {\eta}-nitride materials and demonstrates how composition can be tuned to access emergent magnetic phenomena in these complex nitrides.

Title: Pseudogap, Fermi liquid, Van Hove singularity and maxima of the compressibility and of the Knight shift as a function of doping in the two-dimensional Hubbard model
Authors: Y.M. Vilk, A.-M.S. Tremblay
Abstract: Qualitative changes in thermodynamic and single-particle properties characterize the transition between the pseudogapped electronic liquid and the Fermi liquid. Recent cold-atom experiments on a simulator of the Hubbard model with nearest-neighbor hoppings \cite{kendrick2025pseudogap} showed that the isothermal compressibility $\kappa(\delta)$ has a maximum as a function of doping $\delta$. Here we use the two-particle self-consistent plus (TPSC+) approach to explain these experiments and connect the maximum in $\kappa(\delta)$ to the transformation of the single-particle spectrum from the pseudogapped to the metallic regime. This elucidates the nature of the pseudogap (PG). Specifically, the maximum in $\kappa(\delta)$ practically coincides with the doping at which the precursor of the lower $(\pi,\pi)$ spin density wave (SDW) band at the antinodal point crosses the zero-frequency $\omega=0$. The Knight shift, $\chi_{sp}(0,0)(\delta)$, as a function of doping, should also have a maximum. The maxima in both quantities should exist, at sufficiently low temperatures ($T$), in both the intermediate $U \approx U_{Mott}$ and weak $U < U_{Mott}$ interaction limits. In both limits, the mechanism is critical thermal SDW fluctuations. At the antinodal pseudogap, the correlation length at $\delta_{max}(T)$ can be small, controlled not by static but by dynamic critical thermal fluctuations. We also find that the SDW fluctuations are incommensurate at $\delta=\delta_{max}$. We predict that, at low $T$, the multiple peaks in the spin susceptibility in the incommensurate case lead to more than two SDW precursor peaks in the spectral function and density of states. By allowing access to parameter regimes relevant to cuprates-including further-neighbor hopping ($t', t''$) and low temperatures, our work provides a high-impact tool for further studies by the broader community.

Title: Observation of robust spin-phonon coupling and indication of hidden structural transition in the spin-driven ferroelectrics Mn4B_2O_9 (B= Nb, Ta)
Authors: Rajesh Jana, Alka Garg, Rekha Rao, Thomas Meier
Abstract: We report detailed Raman spectroscopic and magnetic susceptibility studies on the spin-driven ferroelectric compounds Mn4Nb2O9 (MNO) and Mn4Ta2O9 (MTO). Both systems exhibit strong spin-phonon coupling below the short-range magnetic ordering temperature (T(sro)=223 K), followed by further renormalization of several Raman modes at the long-range magnetic ordering temperatures (TN = 120 K for MNO and 110 K for MTO). Pronounced anomalies in Raman mode frequencies and linewidths, along with the emergence of octahedral modes between Tsro and TN, indicate a possible low-symmetry structural transition, more evident in MNO and closely linked to magnetic ordering in MTO. Distinct low-temperature evolutions of Raman mode shift, linewidth, and integrated intensity in MNO and MTO highlight the role of the nonmagnetic B-site cation in tuning spin-lattice coupling, driven by differences in spin-orbit coupling and orbital hybridization between Nb5+ (4d) and Ta5+ (5d). By combining Raman spectroscopy with nuclear magnetic resonance, and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, we further show that Mn-based systems possess a more distorted local structure than their Co analogues, while their electronic structures differ despite comparable band gaps. These results provide a comprehensive understanding of spin-lattice coupling in Mn- and Co-based A4B2O9 magnetoelectric systems.

Title: Superconductivity of 30.4 K and its Reemergence under Pressure in Fe1.11Se Synthesized via Ion-exchange and De-intercalation Reaction
Authors: Mingzhang Yang, Yuxin Ma, Qi Li, Ke Ma, Jiali Lu, Zhaolong Liu, Ruijin Sun, Tianping Ying, Mengdi Wang, Xin Chen, Changchun Zhao, Jian-gang Guo, Shifeng Jin, Xiaolong Chen
Abstract: Binary stoichiometry FeSe (s-FeSe) is a well-known parent of high-temperature unconventional superconductors owing to its charge-neutral layer, highly tunable structure and electronic properties, and rich interplays among multiple electronic phases. Yet the s-FeSe synthesized via high-temperature equilibrium reactions bears the notorious interstitial Fe,where merely 3% of them is sufficient to kill the superconductivity. Here, we successfully synthesized a new non-stoichiometric Fe1.11Se single crystal with a superconducting onset temperature (Tconset) of 30.4 K through a hydrothermal ion-exchange and de-intercalation route. 11% interstitial Fe ions exceed the equilibrium phase diagram limit. Intriguingly, under physical pressure, the Tconset of exhibits a "V"-shaped evolution with a minimum at 2-2.6 GPa, and then upturning into a second superconducting region, reminiscent of the behaviors in FeSe intercalates. Furthermore, a pressure-induced possible magnetic order, previously only observed in pressurized s-FeSe, shows up. These results offer fresh insights into the role of interstitial Fe in governing superconducting and transport properties under non-equilibrium synthesis and tuning strategies.

Title: Disorder-induced symmetry breaking in moiré bands of marginally twisted bilayer MoS$_2$
Authors: Pablo Reséndiz-Vázquez, Christophe de Beule, Thi-Hai-Yen Vu, Kaijian Xing, Daniel McEwen, Daniel Bennett, Liangtao Peng, Héctor González-Herrero, Shaffique Adam, Mark T. Edmonds, Michael S. Fuhrer
Abstract: Twisted transition-metal dichalcogenides host highly tunable moiré potentials, flat bands, and correlated electronic phases, yet the role of disorder in shaping these emergent properties remains largely unresolved. Using scanning tunneling spectroscopy, we investigate the impact of electrostatic disorder on the electronic structure of marginally twisted ($\theta \approx 0.95^\circ$) bilayer MoS$_2$. Differences of 15 meV in the onset energies of the valence and conduction bands between MX- and XM-stacked regions are observed and are unexpected based on symmetry considerations. We further observe spatially correlated disorder in the band onset energy that is consistent with a background random charge density of a few $10^{11}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$. Continuum model calculations for twisted MoS$_2$ reveal dramatic changes in the low-energy moiré bands in response to an electric displacement field, in quantitative agreement with experiment. Moreover, the calculated local density of states including disorder broadening reproduces the experimental observations only when structural relaxation is taken into account. These results highlight the critical role of electrostatic disorder in determining the electronic structure of moiré materials at the nanoscale.

Title: Structural Distortions and Ferroelectricity in Antiperovskite Oxides with Tetrel Elements
Authors: He Zhu, Turan Birol
Abstract: Antiperovskites share the same structure as perovskites, but allow completely different chemistries and nominal charge states of anions to be stabilized. This gives rise to many interesting phenomena, including septet superconductivity and topological crystalline insulating phases in these systems. Despite this, the work on the crystal structural trends in these compounds are more limited compared to perovskites. In this study, we consider the family of antiperovskite oxides with tetrel elements (Si, Ge, Sn, Pb) and alkaline earth metals (Ca, Sr, Ba), and perform a detailed study of their crystal structures using first principles density functional theory. We show how tolerance factor arguments can be constructed to predict their structure in a way parallel to the perovskites, and furthermore, how heterostructuring (or cation-order) can be used to induce ferroelectricity in these systems which may provide an experimental knob to modify electronic structure. We conclude by a discussion of the electronic structure of antiperovskites, and show that they display interesting trends not observed in regular perovskites, including significant antibonding interactions between face-center ions, which might need to be taken into account building effective electronic models of these compounds.

Title: Ornstein-Uhlenbeck information particle: A new candidate of active agent
Authors: Xin Song, Xiji Shao, Yanwen Zhu, Cheng Yang, Linli He, Shigeyuki Komura, Zhanglin Hou
Abstract: An information particle can acquire active-like motion through transforming the information entropy into effective self-propulsion velocity/force using the attached information engine. We consider an underdamped Brownian particle additionally driven by either a constant self-propulsion force or an information engine using Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) bath feedback control, such particles are called self-propelled particle (SPP) or OU information particle (OUIP). Compared to the widely-investigated SPP, the OUIP shows a significant different dynamical pattern, including two types of moving mode: a slow-speed diffusion mode and a high-speed traveling mode. The specific evolution of OUIP can be adjusted flexibly between such two modes through the inertial effect, thus acquiring a rich and non-trivial motion behavior. By tuning the strength of fluctuation of the OU bath, a wide range of net velocity can be achieved for OUIP. We highlight that OUIP could be an exceptional candidate for active agent.

Title: Epitaxial growth and magneto-transport properties of kagome metal FeGe thin films
Authors: Xiaoyue Song, Yanshen Chen, Yongcheng Deng, Tongao Sun, Fei Wang, Guodong Wei, Xionghua Liu, Kaiyou Wang
Abstract: Antiferromagnetic kagome metal FeGe has attracted tremendous attention in condensed matter physics due to the charge density wave (CDW) being well below its magnetic transition temperature. Up to now, numerous works on kagome FeGe have been based on single crystal bulk, but its thin film form has still not been reported. Here, we achieved epitaxial growth of FeGe thin films on Al2O3 substrates using molecular beam epitaxy. Structural characterization with x-ray diffraction, atomic force microscopy, and high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy reveals single phase with flat surface of kagome FeGe thin films. Moreover, a Néel temperature of 397 K and a rapid variation of Hall coefficient and magnetoresistance around 100 K, which might be related to the CDW, were revealed via transport measurements. The high quality kagome FeGe thin films are expected to provide a versatile platform to study the mechanism of CDW and explore the application of FeGe in antiferromagnetic spintronics.

Title: Biorthogonal scattering and generalized unitarity in non-Hermitian systems
Authors: Jung-Wan Ryu, Henning Schomerus, Hee Chul Park
Abstract: We investigate the two-port scattering process in non-Hermitian dimer models via quantum measurements using external leads. We focus on two exemplary dimer models that preserve parity-time symmetry via spatial gain-loss balance and exhibit non-reciprocity due to directional hopping. The scattering matrix is constructed using the biorthogonality of the left and right scattering states of the Hamiltonian, allowing us to calculate the reflection and transmission probabilities. Our analysis compares the reflection and transmission coefficients derived from the left, right, and combined scattering states, revealing that, unlike in Hermitian systems, the non-Hermitian scattering process does not adhere to unitarity when considering only the right scattering states. Furthermore, non-Hermitian scattering can enhance the reflection and transmission probabilities, with distinct physical contributions arising independently from complex eigenvalues and the non-orthogonality of eigenstates. Our results clarify how biorthogonality restores generalized unitarity and identify distinct physical origins of enhanced transport in PT-symmetric and non-reciprocal dimers, providing new insights into quantum transport in non-Hermitian systems.

Title: Fermionic Approach to Elementary Excitations and Magnetization Plateaus in an S=1/2 XX Hybrid Trimer-Dimer Chain
Authors: K. S. Chikara, A. K. Bera, A. Kumar, S. M. Yusuf
Abstract: We study the elementary excitations and magnetization of a one-dimensional spin-1/2 XX chain comprising trimer-dimer units (the J1-J1-J2-J3-J2 topology) under a transverse magnetic field h. Using Green's function theory and the Jordan-Wigner transformation, we map the system onto spinless fermions and focus on antiferromagnetic (AFM) interactions. At zero temperature, distinct 1/5 and 3/5 magnetization plateaus emerge, determined by the global periodicity Q=5, with the number of plateaus matching the number of excitation gaps above the Fermi level of the spinless fermions. The magnetic phase diagram in the (h-Js) plane features a Luttinger liquid (LL) state, a gapless AFM state, two magnetization plateau states, and a fully polarized gapped magnetic state. The widths of the LL and gapless AFM phases are found to be proportional to the bandwidths gamma = |E(k=0)-E(k=pi)| of the corresponding elementary excitations, whereas the widths of the magnetization plateau states are governed by the excitation gaps. Our study opens new directions for exploring interacting trimer-dimer spin chains in quantum magnetism using experimental techniques such as neutron scattering, as well as theoretical and numerical approaches including quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) and density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) methods. Furthermore, we extend the Oshikawa-Yamanaka-Affleck (OYA) condition to generalized cluster chains, demonstrating that the allowed magnetization plateaus are governed by the global periodicity of the chain (e.g., Q=5 for a trimer-dimer chain), rather than by the local periodicity of individual units (Q=3 for a trimer or Q=2 for a dimer).

Title: Superconductivity in Isolated Single Copper Oxygen Plane
Authors: Youngdo Kim, Byeongjun Gil, Sehoon Kim, Yeonjae Lee, Donghan Kim, Jaeung Lee, Jinyoung Kim, Younsik Kim, Miyoung Kim, Changyoung Kim
Abstract: One of the central questions in cuprate superconductivity is if superconductivity can exist in an isolated single CuO$_2$ plane without any interlayer coupling. There have been numerous experimental efforts to answer this question, but it still has not been clearly resolved. Here we present a heterostructure system with an isolated half-unit-cell La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ which has a single CuO$_2$ plane. Using in-situ angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we measured the electronic and gap structures of a single CuO$_2$ plane. We observed a \textit{d}-wave-like gap which closes somewhat above the bulk T$_c$. Moreover, almost identical gap properties are seen for both single CuO$_2$ plane and bulk. These observations lead us to the conclusion that the d-wave superconductivity of cuprates also exists in a single CuO$_2$ plane. Our results demonstrate that cuprate superconductivity is essentially a two-dimensional phenomenon and provide a platform to study cuprate superconductivity in a purely two-dimensional system.

Title: Thermal Einstein-de Haas Effect Induced by Chiral Phonons in Carbon Nanotubes
Authors: Raimu Akimoto, Hiroyasu Matsuura, Takahiro Yamamoto
Abstract: We investigate the effects of chirality on phonon thermal transport in semiconducting chiral single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) using lattice dynamics combined with Boltzmann transport theory. We find that transverse acoustic and optical phonon modes, which are degenerate in nonchiral zigzag and armchair SWCNTs, are split in chiral SWCNTs, giving rise to finite phonon angular momentum associated with circular motion of individual atoms. This angular momentum is most efficiently generated in small-diameter nanotubes with intermediate chiral angles. Consequently, chiral SWCNTs are predicted to undergo thermally induced rigid-body rotation with an experimentally observable angular velocity via the thermal Einstein-de Haas effect.

Title: Wavefront-Dislocation Evolution via Quadratic Band Touching Annihilation
Authors: Rasoul Ghadimi, Jaehyeon Ahn, Sangmo Cheon
Abstract: Wavefront dislocations (WDs) -- phase singularities observed in quasiparticle interference (QPI) experiments -- have been widely interpreted as the definitive real-space signatures of Berry phases in graphene-family systems. Here, we disentangle the roles of topological charge and pseudospin texture in WD experiments. By investigating various way of the annihilation of quadratic band touchings (QBTs) in bilayer graphene and magneto-spin-orbit graphene systems, we demonstrate that WD evolution is governed exclusively by changes in the underlying pseudospin winding, while remaining insensitive to the topological charge (i.e., vorticity) of the band touching itself. Our results imply that WD measures wavefunction pseudospin texture rather than a diagnostic of topological charge and provide solid-state platforms in which WD evolution can be engineered and observed.

Title: Interfacial dynamics induced by impacts across rigid and soft substrates
Authors: Ishin Kikuchi, Hiroya Watanabe, Yuto Yokoyama, Hiroaki Kusuno, Yoshiyuki Tagawa
Abstract: We investigate impact-induced gas-liquid interfacial dynamics through experiments in which a liquid-filled container impacts substrates with elastic moduli from $O(10^{-1})$ MPa to $O(10^{5})$ MPa. Upon impact, the concave gas-liquid interface inside the container deforms and emits a focused jet. When the jet velocity is normalized by the container impact velocity, all data collapse onto a single curve when plotted against the Cauchy number, $Ca = \rho_{\rm e} V_{\rm i}^2 / E$, which represents the ratio of the inertial force of the container-liquid system to the elastic restoring force of the substrate. The dimensionless jet velocity remains nearly constant for $Ca< 10^{-4}$, but decreases significantly for $Ca > 10^{-4}$. Based on this observation, we define the boundary between the rigid-impact and soft-impact regimes using the Cauchy number, providing a quantitative criterion for what constitutes ``softness'' in impact-driven interfacial flows. To explain the reduction in jet velocity observed in the soft-impact regime, we introduce a framework in which only the impulse transferred within the effective time window for jet formation contributes to interface acceleration. This concept, referred to as the partial impulse, captures the situation where the impact interval (the duration of contact between the container and the substrate) exceeds the focusing interval (the time required for jet formation). By modelling the contact force using an elastic foundation model and solving the resulting momentum equation over the finite impulse window, we quantitatively reproduce the experimental results. This partial impulse framework unifies the dynamics of impact-driven jetting across both rigid and soft substrate regimes, extending the applicability of classical impulse-based models.

Title: Relativity of Observation: Operational Intensive Variables in Nonequilibrium Thermodynamics
Authors: Akihisa Ichiki
Abstract: We formulate nonequilibrium thermodynamics in which intensive variables acquire operational meaning through measurement protocols consistent with local reciprocity. Using physical equilibrium as a reference, conjugate observables are constructed by continuously adjusting devices along the local tangent space of the statistical manifold. In this relativity of observation, Onsager reciprocity holds locally, allowing inference-based Lagrange multipliers to be directly measured. This provides a systematic method to extend operational definitions of intensive variables to nonequilibrium states, highlighting their context-dependent nature and offering a concrete experimental strategy.

Title: Inferring Microscopic Explanatory Structures from Observational Constraints via Large Deviations
Authors: Akihisa Ichiki
Abstract: We study how macroscopic observational constraints restrict admissible microscopic explanatory structures when no intrinsic order or dynamics is assumed a priori. Starting from an unordered collection of measurement outcomes, we formulate inference as a constrained large deviation problem, selecting probability assignments that minimize relative entropy with respect to a reference measure determined solely by the measurement setup. We show that among all microscopic structures compatible with a given macroscopic constraint, those rendering the observation statistically most typical are selected. As an explicit illustration, we demonstrate how ordered microscopic structures can emerge purely from inference under constraint, even when the reference measure is fully permutation symmetric. Order is thus not assumed but inferred, serving here only as an illustrative example of a broader class of relational explanatory hypotheses constrained by observation.

Title: Tensor network dynamical message passing for epidemic models
Authors: Cheng Ye, Zi-Song Shen, Pan Zhang
Abstract: While epidemiological modeling is pivotal for informing public health strategies, a fundamental trade-off limits its predictive fidelity: exact stochastic simulations are often computationally intractable for large-scale systems, whereas efficient analytical approximations typically fail to account for essential short-range correlations and network loops. Here, we resolve this trade-off by introducing Tensor Network Dynamical Message Passing (TNDMP), a framework grounded in a rigorous property we term \textit{Susceptible-Induced Factorization}. This theoretical insight reveals that a susceptible node acts as a dynamical decoupler, factorizing the global evolution operator into localized components. Leveraging this, TNDMP provides a dual-mode algorithmic suite: an exact algorithm that computes local observables with minimal redundancy on tractable topologies and a scalable and tunable approximation for complex real-world networks. We demonstrate that widely adopted heuristics, such as Dynamical Message Passing (DMP) and Pair Approximation (PA), are mathematically recoverable as low-order limits of our framework. Numerical validation in synthetic and real-world networks confirms that TNDMP significantly outperforms existing methods to predict epidemic thresholds and steady states, offering a rigorous bridge between the efficiency of message passing and the accuracy of tensor network formalisms.

Title: Microscopic Origin of the Ultralow Lattice Thermal Conductivity in Vacancy-Ordered Halide Double Perovskites Cs$_2BX_6$ ($B$ = Zr, Pd, Sn, Te, Hf, and Pt; $X$= Cl, Br, and I)
Authors: Lingzhi Cao, Yateng Wang, Zhonghao Xia, Jiangang He
Abstract: Vacancy-ordered halide double perovskites Cs$_2BX_6$ have recently attracted significant attention due to their intrinsically ultralow lattice thermal conductivity ($\kappa_{\mathrm{L}}$), which is highly desirable for thermal insulation and thermoelectric applications. In this work, we systematically investigate the anharmonic lattice dynamics and thermal transport properties of Cs$_2BX_6$ ($B$ = Zr, Pd, Sn, Te, Hf, and Pt; $X$ = Cl, Br, and I) using state-of-the-art first-principles calculations, based on a unified theory of thermal transport for crystals and glasses. All studied compounds are found to exhibit ultralow $\kappa_{\mathrm{L}}$ below 1.0~W\,m$^{-1}$\,K$^{-1}$ at room temperature and large derivation from the conventional $T^{-1}$ temperature dependence. Our analysis combining with machine-learning approach show that low sound velocities (1100 -- 1600~m\,s$^{-1}$), which originates from the intrinsically weak chemical bonding, play a crucial role in suppressing heat transport of the most compounds, instead of the strong scattering of rattling phonon modes expected from the large void in the structure. Furthermore, the influence of $B$ and $X$-site elements on phonon dispersion, anharmonicity, and scattering phase space is clarified. Our results provide microscopic insights into the origin of ultralow $\kappa_{\mathrm{L}}$ in Cs$_2BX_6$ and offer guiding principles for the rational design of halide-based materials with tailored thermal transport properties.

Title: Classical Resolution of the Gibbs Paradox from the Equal Probability Principle: An Informational Perspective
Authors: Zheng Zhang
Abstract: The Gibbs paradox is a conventional paradox in classical statistical mechanics, typically resolved by invoking quantum indistinguishability through the 1/N! correction. In this letter, we present a resolution within classical ensemble theory, which relies solely on the equal probability principle and does not invoke the 1/N! correction. Our resolution can be naturally interpretated from a purely informational perspective, where the Gibbs entropy is explicitly regarded as the Shannon entropy, quantifying ignorance rather than disorder. From this informational perspective, we also clarify the connection between information and extractable work in the gas mixing processes. Our work opens a new avenue to reconsider the role of information in statistical mechanics.

Title: Emulation of the dynamics of bound electron exposed to strong oscillatory laser field with Bose-Einstein Condensates
Authors: Ziheng Ma, Jia Li, Rui Jin, Yajiang Hao
Abstract: This paper employs a Bose-Einstein condensates to simulate the dynamical response of bound electrons in a strongly oscillating pulsed laser field. We investigate the excitation dynamics of Bose-Einstein condensates with repulsive interaction confined in a potential well with finite depth and width driven by a strong oscillatory pulse field. By numerically solving the Gross-Pitaevskii equation with Crank-Nicolson method and split operator method, we obtain the time-dependent wavefunction and therefore the evolution of density distribution in real space and that in momentum space, and the occupation distribution in energy space. It is shown that cold atoms with weak interaction oscillate as a whole body in a finite space when the amplitude of pulse drive is not strong enough. During the evolution atoms occupy the bound states with larger probability. Increasing the driving strength or atomic interactions promotes the excitation of atoms into continuum states and their diffusion out of the potential well, leading to complex structures or even interference-like patterns in the momentum distribution. The number of cycles in the pulse envelope plays a crucial role in the dynamical behavior: High-frequency driving can suppress diffusion and maintain localization. Furthermore, repulsive atomic interactions can enhance high-harmonic generation yields by several orders of magnitude. This study offers a new perspective for quantum simulations of ultrafast dynamics in strong fields and reveals the regulatory role of interactions in condensates on non-equilibrium dynamical processes.

Title: Optically tunable nonlinear mechanical damping in an optomechanical resonator
Authors: Hideki Arahari, Motoki Asano, Hiroshi Yamaguchi, Hajime Okamoto
Abstract: We theoretically propose and experimentally demonstrate optically tunable nonlinear mechanical damping in a cavity optomechanical system utilizing a partly resolved sideband regime. Optomechanical coupling provides a delayed nonlinear backaction to the mechanical modes, resulting in nonlinear mechanical damping. This optically induced nonlinear damping is observed in the frequency and time domains, and we show using both theory and experiment that it can be tuned via laser detuning. We also observe optically mediated cross-nonlinear damping between two mechanical modes: the amplitude of one mode modulates the damping of the other. The presented results show a fully tunable scheme of nonlinear mechanical damping that will be applicable to various non-trivial systems, governed by nonlinear, nonequilibrium, and non-Hermitian phenomena.

Title: Fooling the Landauer bound with a demon biased thermal bath
Authors: Salambô Dago, Ludovic Bellon
Abstract: The Landauer principle establishes a fundamental lower bound on the energetic cost of the erasure of a one-bit memory in thermal equilibrium. Here, we experimentally demonstrate how this bound can be effectively circumvented by introducing a hysteresis in the feedback-generated virtual potential of a micro-resonator acting as the information bit. By tuning the hysteresis, we engineer a non-equilibrium steady state with an adjustable effective temperature, enabling erasure processes that consume over 20 percents below the Landauer bound. Our results reveal that the hysteresis acts as an embedded Maxwell demon, exploiting temporal and spatial information to reduce the system's entropy and the thermodynamic transformation cost. This approach provides a versatile platform for exploring the interplay between feedback, information, and energy in stochastic systems.

Title: Sixth order modification of the Cahn-Hilliard equation
Authors: P. O. Mchedlov-Petrosyan, L. N. Davydov, O. A. Osmaev
Abstract: We consider the sixth-order convective-viscous Cahn-Hilliard equation, different from the standard fourth-order Cahn-Hilliard equation due to the modified expression for the thermodynamic potential. In such modified thermodynamic potential the coefficient at the square gradient term is order-parameter-dependent. It also contains the square of the Laplacian. This results in a sixth-order differential equation and additional nonlinear terms in the equation. We obtained several exact static- and traveling wave solutions and studied the dependence of solutions on the parameters of the system.

Title: Spin splitting, Kondo correlation and singlet-doublet quantum phase transition in a superconductor-coupled InSb nanosheet quantum dot
Authors: Xingjun Wu, Ji-Yin Wang, Haitian Su, Han Gao, Shili Yan, Dong Pan, Jianhua Zhao, Po Zhang, H. Q. Xu
Abstract: We realize a superconductor-coupled quantum dot (QD) in an InSb nanosheet, a 2D platform promising for studies of topological superconductivity. The device consists of a superconductor-QD-superconductor junction, where a bottom bilayer gate defines the QD and allows tuning of its coupling to the superconducting leads. The QD exhibits large $g$-factors and strong spin-orbit coupling. Transport measurements reveal Coulomb diamond-shaped differential conductance features with even-odd alternating sizes and pronounced conductance lines associated with the superconducting gap, confirming a few-electron, superconductor-coupled regime. At an odd electron occupation, Kondo signatures emerge, including a zero-bias peak that splits with magnetic field and is logarithmically suppressed at elevated temperatures. We further observe a doublet-singlet quantum phase transition, manifested by a clear change of Andreev bound states from crossing to anticrossing as the coupling strength increases. These results underscore the rich physics of InSb nanosheet QDs and their promise for topological quantum devices.

Title: Self-assembly of flexible patchy nanoparticles in solution
Authors: Guoqing Meng, Liyuan Chen, Sihang Guo, Junxing Pan, Yingying Wang, Jinjun Zhang
Abstract: The self-assembly of polymer grafted nanoparticles is more and more used in the field of functional materials. However, there is still a lack of analysis on the dynamic transformation paths of different self-assembly morphologies, which makes it impossible to achieve further precise regulation and targeted design in experiments and industrial production. In this work the effects of patchy property, grafted chain length, ratio and grafting density on the self-assembly behavior and structure of polymer grafted flexible patchy nanoparticles are investigated by dissipative particle dynamics simulation method through the construction of coarse-grained model of polymer grafted ternary nanoparticles. The influence and regulation mechanisms of these factors on the self-assembly structure transformation of flexible patchy nanoparticles are systematically studied, and a variety of structures such as dendritic structure, columnar structure, and bilayer membrane are obtained. The self-assembly structure of flexible patchy nanoparticles obtained in this work (such as bilayer membrane structure) provides a potential application basis for designing drug carriers. By precisely regulating the specific structural characteristics of the system, it is possible to achieve efficient loading of drugs and targeted delivery functions, thus significantly improving the bioavailability and effect of drugs.

Title: 3D Spin-orbital liquids
Authors: Anna Sandberg, Lukas Rødland, Maria Hermanns
Abstract: Spin-orbital liquids provide an exactly solvable route to three-dimensional Z2 quantum spin liquids beyond the original Kitaev setting. Built from higher-dimensional Clifford-algebra representations, spin-orbital Hamiltonians can be realized on both three- and four-coordinated lattices, giving rise to phases with 3 and 2 itinerant Majorana flavors. We demonstrate that these models host a rich set of gapless Majorana metals, characterized, in particular, by topological Fermi surfaces, nodal lines, and Weyl semimetal phases. We analyze the stability of these structures under physically motivated perturbations and identify generic splitting patterns and topological transitions driven by symmetry breaking and flavor mixing. This yields a unified organizing framework for three-dimensional Majorana metals in fractionalized spin liquids.

Title: Resonant absorption and linear photovoltaic effect in ferroelectric moiré heterostructures
Authors: V. V. Enaldiev, Z. Z. Alisultanov
Abstract: Twisted bilayers, featuring interfacial ferroelectricity in the form of array of polar domains, combined with incommensurate two-dimensional layers in a single van der Waals heterostructures allows for generation of purely electrostatic moiré superlattice potentials in the latter. We study electronic and optoelectronic properties of such heterostructures composed of graphene stacked with the twisted ferroelectric bilayers and show that doping of graphene substantially affects mini-band structures because of screening of free carriers. We demonstrate that formation of van Hove singularities in density of states modifies linear and second-order responses of the structures leading to resonant absorption and linear photovoltaic effect, respectively. The latter is generated solely by a shift photocurrent, arising only with account of virtual optical transitions, whereas an injection photocurrent is forbidden by symmetry.

Title: Second law of thermodynamics in closed quantum many-body systems
Authors: Yuuya Chiba, Yasushi Yoneta, Ryusuke Hamazaki, Akira Shimizu
Abstract: The second law of thermodynamics for adiabatic operations -- constraints on state transitions in closed systems under external control -- is one of the fundamental principles of thermodynamics. On the other hand, it is recently established that even pure quantum states can represent thermal equilibrium. However, pure quantum states do not satisfy the second law in that they are not passive, i.e., work can be extracted from them if arbitrary unitary operations are allowed. It therefore remains unresolved how quantum mechanics can be reconciled with thermodynamics. Here, based on our key quantum-mechanical notions of thermal equilibrium and adiabatic operations, we address the emergence of the second law for adiabatic operations in the thermodynamics limit. We first introduce infinite-observable macroscopic thermal equilibrium (iMATE); a quantum state, including pure states, is in iMATE if the expectation values of all additive observables agree with their equilibrium values. We also introduce a macroscopic operation as unitary evolution generated by a time-dependent additive Hamiltonian, which is regarded as corresponding to adiabatic operations. Employing these concepts, we show that no extensive work can be extracted from any quantum state in iMATE through any macroscopic operations. Furthermore, we introduce a quantum-mechanical form of entropy density such that it agrees with thermodynamic entropy density for any quantum state in iMATE. We then prove that for any initial state in iMATE, this entropy density cannot be decreased by any macroscopic operations, followed by a time-independent relaxation process. Our theory thus proves two different forms of the second law, by adopting macroscopically reasonable classes of observables, equilibrium states, and operations. We also discuss the time scales of macroscopic operations in these results.

Title: Probing valley quantum oscillations via the spin Seebeck effect in transition metal dichalcogenide/ferromagnet hybrids
Authors: Xin Hu, Yuya Ominato, Mamoru Matsuo
Abstract: We theoretically investigate spin-valley-locked tunneling transport in a transition-metal dichalcogenide/ferromagnetic-insulator heterostructure under a perpendicular magnetic field, driven by the spin Seebeck effect. We demonstrate that spin-valley coupling together with the magnetic-field-induced valley-asymmetric Landau-level structure enables the generation of a valley-polarized spin current from valley-selective spin excitation. We compare the spin current and the valley-polarized spin current in the conduction and valence bands and clarify their distinct microscopic origins. We predict pronounced quantum oscillations of the valley-polarized spin current, providing a clear experimental signature of quantized valley states.

Title: Quasi-one-dimensional spin excitations in the iron pnictide NaFe$_{0.53}$Cu$_{0.47}$As
Authors: Yifan Wang, David W. Tam, Weiyi Wang, R. A. Ewings, J. Ross Stewart, Masaaki Matsuda, Chongde Cao, Changle Liu, Rong Yu, Pengcheng Dai, Yu Song
Abstract: Spectroscopic measurements in model one-dimensional (1D) correlated systems offer insights for understanding their two-dimensional counterparts, which include the cuprate and iron pnictide/chalcogenide superconductors. A major challenge is the identification of such correlated systems with dominantly 1D physics. In this work, inelastic neutron scattering measurements on NaFe$_{0.53}$Cu$_{0.47}$As single crystal directly reveal quasi-1D spin excitations, resulting from atomic order that lead to magnetic Fe and nonmagnetic Cu chains. The dominant exchange interaction is antiferromagnetic along the chain ($SJ_{\rm \parallel}\approx90.1(3)$~meV), whereas the inter-chain couplings are much weaker ($SJ_{\rm \perp}\approx-2.4(1)$~meV and $SJ_{\rm c}\approx0.15(5)$~meV). The quasi-1D spin excitations in NaFe$_{0.53}$Cu$_{0.47}$As stem from both the Néel and stripe vectors, with Néel excitations sensitive to Fe impurities on the Cu site. The spin excitations in quasi-1D NaFe$_{0.53}$Cu$_{0.47}$As and quasi-2D FeSe exhibit a striking resemblance, suggesting a common origin for their coexistent stripe and Néel excitations. Our findings demonstrate magnetic dilution in NaFeAs leads to dimension reduction of its magnetic degree of freedom, presenting a strategy for discovering low-dimensional quantum materials.

Title: Chirality Driven Ratchet Currents in Two-Dimensional Tellurene with an Asymmetric Grating
Authors: M. D. Moldavskaya, L. E. Golub, Chang Niu, Peide D. Ye, S. D. Ganichev
Abstract: The emergence of the terahertz (THz) ratchet effect is a rapidly expanding field of research that utilizes broken spatial symmetry in low-dimensional materials to rectify alternating current (AC) induced by THz fields into direct current (DC). This mechanism is highly promising for next-generation, room-temperature terahertz applications, particularly in high-speed, sensitive detection and imaging. In this work, we explore a ratchet effect generated in two dimensional tellurene, a novel promising semiconductor material consisting of helical atomic chains, creating a structure with inherent chirality. As a key result, the DC circular ratchet current flowing in the chiral axis direction $c$ is determined by the helicity of the radiation and can be reversed by switching the helicity from right to left handed. The circular ratchet effect excited by THz laser radiation is demonstrated for room temperature. The effect is demonstrated at various gate voltages when the Fermi level lies in vicinity of the Weyl point in the conduction band, in the band gap, and in the valence band with almost parabolic energy dispersion. The results are described by the developed microscopic theory based on the Boltzmann kinetic equation approach.

Title: Physical properties of RhGe and CoGe single crystals synthesized under high pressure
Authors: Shangjie Tian, Xiangjiang Dong, Bowen Zhang, Zhijun Tu, Runze Yu, Hechang Lei, Shouguo Wang
Abstract: Chiral topological semimetals hosting multifold fermions and exotic surface states represent a frontier in topological materials research. Among them, noncentrosymmetric cubic B20 compounds-notably transition-metal silicides and germanides-offer a unique platform for realizing symmetry-protected topological phases and unconventional optoelectronic responses. Here, we report the physical properties of RhGe and CoGe single crystals with B20 structure in detail. Transport measurements reveal metallic behavior with characteristic Fermi-liquid scaling at low temperatures, while magnetization results confirm paramagnetism in both compounds. In addition, both of materials exhibit low carrier concentrations with small electronic specific heat coefficient, indicating their semimetal feature with weak electronic correlations. Such high-quality CoGe and RhGe single crystals provide a material platform to explore the evolution of multifold fermions and the instability of helicoid-arc surface states with spin-orbit coupling and surface environment in B20 material systems.

Title: In-depth study of spectroscopic properties of new $Pr^{3+}$-ion doped low-phonon sesquisulfide $Lu_2S_3$ material for mid-IR laser sources
Authors: Martin Fibrich, Jan Sulc, Lubomír Havlak, Vítezslav Jarý, Robert Kral, Vojtech Vanecek, David Vyhlidal, Helena Jelinkova, Martin Nikl
Abstract: $Lu_2S_3$ material from the family of sesquisulfide hosts appears to be a promising low-phonon material for use as a laser gain medium allowing for a laser emission over a broad spectral range from ultraviolet to far mid-infrared wavelengths. In this paper, a praseodymium-ion doped $Lu_2S_3$ single crystal grown by micro-pulling down technique is investigated with focus on its spectroscopic properties. The Raman, excitation, and luminescence spectra are presented. By selective excitation of the main energy levels of $Pr^{3+}$-ions, 26 luminescence transitions of the $Pr:Lu_2S_3$ crystal spanning the 0.49 to 5.5 $\mu$m wavelength range have been identified. The correct assignment of the observed luminescence spectra to the respective $Pr^{3+}$ energy-level transitions was confirmed by the calculation of the optimized squared reduced-matrix elements for the tensor operators U(k) and L + gS.

Title: Bridgman method grown $Cs_2Li_3I_5$: an inter-alkali metal scintillator with high lithium content
Authors: Katerina Krehlikova, Vojtech Vanecek, Robert Kral, Romana Kucerkova, Petra Zemenova, Jan Rohlıcek, Petr Prusa, Katerina Rubesova
Abstract: In this study, we report on the growth of ternary caesium lithium iodide ($Cs_2Li_3I_5$, CLI) bulk crystals, both undoped and doped with thallium (Tl) and indium (In), using the miniaturised vertical Bridgman method (mVB). X-ray Powder Diffraction (XRPD) confirmed the presence of the ternary CLI phase in all three crystals, with CLI : In appearing homogeneous structure-wise throughout the entire ingot. Measurements of radioluminescence (RL), photoluminescence emission (PL), photoluminescence excitation (PLE) spectra, and photoluminescence decay kinetics (PL decay) demonstrated that the primary luminescence centers originate from the matrix itself. When doped with thallium, the efficiency of the luminescence was significantly increased. Furthermore, CLI : Tl and CLI : In crystals exhibited emission spectra similar to those of their doped caesium iodide counterparts, CsI : Tl and CsI : In, respectively. The main component of the PL decay was 523 ns, 557 ns, and 554 ns for the undoped, Tl+-doped, and In+-doped crystals, respectively. It is worthy of note that only CLI : Tl exhibited a single exponential decay. Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) measurements revealed two endothermic peaks corresponding to the eutectic and liquidus temperature for CLI and CLI : In, indicating that this ternary compound has a congruent melting behaviour. Finally, the melting point of CLI was estimated to be approximately 220 °C.

Title: Investigation of the Electronic Structure and Spin-State Crossover in LaCoO3 Using Photoemission Spectroscopy
Authors: Sayari Ghatak, Abhishek Das, Andrei Gloskovskii, Dinesh Topwal
Abstract: Photoemission spectroscopy is a powerful technique for studying electronic structure and spin-state transitions, as it reveals changes in the orbital configuration accompanying a spin-state crossover. In this report, we combine excitation-energy-, temperature-, and geometry-dependent photoemission measurements to probe the electronic structure of LaCoO3 across its thermally driven spin-state transition. By systematically comparing valence-band spectra across a wide photon-energy window - from surface-sensitive soft x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (SXPS) to bulk-sensitive hard x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (HAXPES) - we identify the Co 3d-derived feature (A) along with the O 2p-dominated features (B and C), and explain their relative evolution in terms of photon-energy-dependent photo-ionization cross-section ratios. The thermally induced spin-state crossover is demonstrated using temperature-dependent SXPS valence-band spectra, which show a progressive suppression of the feature A with heating. Geometry-dependent HAXPES measurements further clarify how the signature of the spin-state transition in LaCoO3 is intricately linked to the orbital-selective response of the t2g and eg states. Additionally, angular-dependent photo-ionization cross-section analysis provides a consistent description of the polarization dependence observed in HAXPES. Finally, configuration-interaction analysis of the Co 2p core-level spectra reveals that LaCoO3 evolves from a predominantly low-spin ground state at low temperature to a mixed low-spin/high-spin configuration at elevated temperatures, with the high-spin fraction reaching about 30 percent at 400 K. The temperature evolution of the core-level line shape thus establishes Co 2p photoemission as a sensitive quantitative probe of spin-state transitions in LaCoO3.

Abstract: In recent years, hybrid organic-inorganic metal halides have been at the forefront of materials research. Typically, the functional (e.g., optoelectronic) properties of hybrid halides are derived from the inorganic structural part, whereas the organic structural units can add extra advantages in terms of stability, rigidity, and processability. Here, we report the design, synthesis, and characterization of two new hybrid materials in which the outstanding photophysical properties originate from the organic structural part. The new compounds, (C15H16N)2CdCl4 and ((Br)C15H15N)2CdCl4, have 2D layered Ruddlesden-Poppertype perovskite structures. These hybrids are blue-white light emitters just like their corresponding pure organic salts, but with much improved emission efficiencies. Optical spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) studies confirm that photoemission comes from the trans-stilbene organic cations. The photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) values of these new materials are among the highest known, 50.83 % and 26.60 % for (C15H16N)2CdCl4 and ((Br)C15H15N)2CdCl4, respectively. This is up to a 5-fold increase as compared to the light emission efficiency of the precursor salt C15H16NCl (PLQY of 10.33 %). Alongside their outstanding optical properties, their environmental and thermal stability allow their consideration for potential practical applications such as radiation detection. This work shows that hybrid metal halides can be compositionally and structurally engineered to have highly efficient photoemission originating from the organic components for fast scintillation applications.

Title: Damage accumulation induced metal-insulator transition through ion implantation of ScN thin films
Authors: Charlotte Poterie, Marc Marteau, Per Eklund, Thierry Cabioch, Jean-Francois Barbot, Arnaud le Febvrier
Abstract: Ion implantation is a powerful approach for tuning the electrical properties of materials through controlled doping and defect engineering, with applications in thermoelectrics and microelectronics. Scandium nitride (ScN) is particularly sensitive to irradiation-induced disorder, with transport properties spanning several orders of magnitude and multiple conduction mechanisms involved. In this study, we investigate the evolution of electrical transport in epitaxial ScN thin films undergoing accumulated irradiation damage at an initial defect state. A phenomenological damage-accumulation model was successfully combined with temperature dependent resistivity and Hall effect measurements to elucidate the impact of defect buildup on electrical transport and to provide physically grounded, quantitative insight into the nature and accumulation of irradiation-induced defects. It reveals two distinct defects-generation regimes of electrically active defects. At low doses, direct-impact damage produces stable and isolated acceptor-type complex defects, (VSc-X) with VSc a scandium vacancy and X denoting residual impurities, leading to a gradual increase in resistivity. At higher doses, defect accumulation dominates through a multi-hit process, giving rise to point-defect buildup and carrier localization, resulting in hopping-dominated transport. This localized regime is thermally unstable and recovers upon low-temperature annealing. We further demonstrate that the residual defect landscape strongly influences both the critical dose for the metal-insulator transition and the localization strength: films grown on Al2O3 exhibit an earlier transition and weaker localization than those grown on MgO. These results highlight ion implantation as an effective route for engineering disorder-induced localization in ScN, with the initial film quality playing a decisive role.

Title: Current precision in interacting hybrid Normal-Superconducting systems
Authors: Nahual Sobrino, Fabio Taddei, Rosario Fazio, Michele Governale
Abstract: We study Andreev-mediated transport and current fluctuations in interacting normal-superconducting quantum-dot systems. Using a generalized master equation based on real-time diagrammatics and full counting statistics, we compute the steady-state current, zero-frequency noise, and rate of entropy production in the large superconducting-gap limit. We show how Coulomb interactions modify Andreev-mediated transport by renormalizing resonant conditions and suppressing superconducting coherence, leading to a pronounced reduction of current precision even when average currents are only weakly affected. These effects are particularly evident at high temperatures, where conventional Coulomb-blockade features are thermally smeared while fluctuation properties remain highly sensitive. By analyzing thermodynamic uncertainty relations, we demonstrate that violations of the quantum bound present in the noninteracting regime are progressively reduced and eventually suppressed as interactions increase, whereas the recently proposed hybrid bound remains satisfied. Our results clarify how Coulomb interactions, and nonequilibrium fluctuations jointly determine transport properties in hybrid superconducting devices, and establish current precision as a robust benchmark for interacting Andreev transport beyond the noninteracting limit.

Title: Optomagnonic logic based on optical nonthermal magnetization switching in near-compensated iron-garnets
Authors: N. I. Gribova, D. O. Ignatyeva, N. A. Gusev, A. K. Zvezdin, V. I. Belotelov
Abstract: We propose a set of optomagnonic logic elements based on the effect of optical magnetization switching via the non-thermal inverse Faraday effect induced by femtosecond laser pulses in nearly compensated iron-garnet film with uniaxial anisotropy. Two equilibrium states in such a film are separated by a potential barrier that might be overpassed if the femtosecond pulse fluence exceeds a threshold value, so that magnetization is reversed after the pulse action. The switching threshold depends strongly on the value of applied in-plane external magnetic field, and is different for the two initial magnetization states and two opposite optical pulse helicites. This makes it possible to perform optomagnonic non-thermal deterministic writing of a magnetic bit. Such switching mechanism can be used for realizing reconfigurable optomagnonic logic elements without thermal assistance. Logical operations are implemented by encoding inputs in the amplitude and helicity of the optical pulses, while outputs are written as the magnetization state. The study demonstrates a pathway towards heating-free optomagnonic logic and memory devices.

Title: From Symmetry to Stability: Structural and Electronic Transformation in Cs$_2$KInI$_6$
Authors: Mohammad Bakhsh, Victor Trinquet, Rogério Almeida Gouvêa, Gian-Marco Rignanese, Samuel Poncé
Abstract: Cs$_2$KInI$_6$ is a promising lead-free halide double perovskite with a calculated direct band gap of 1.24 eV, ideal for solar cell applications. Our first-principles calculations reveal that its cubic phase (Fm$\bar{3}$m) is dynamically unstable. Using an accelerated machine learning approach, we identify 42 dynamically stable structures and further validate these findings using first principles calculations on 11 of these. The most stable phase has Cmc$2_1$ symmetry with 20 atoms/unit cell. It lies 41.9 meV/atom below the cubic reference but lacks octahedral cation coordination. The most stable perovskite-like structure has P$\bar{3}$ symmetry with 10 atoms/unit cell and low octahedral connectivity. Structure-property trade-offs are highlighted, with calculated distortions generally widening the band gap, shifting it from direct to indirect, and flattening the band edges. This work showcases the synergy of genetic algorithms, machine-learned potentials, and first-principles validation for discovering stable, complex materials.

Title: Charge-$4e$ superconductor with parafermionic vortices: A path to universal topological quantum computation
Authors: Zhengyan Darius Shi, Zhaoyu Han, Srinivas Raghu, Ashvin Vishwanath
Abstract: Topological superconductors (TSCs) provide a promising route to fault-tolerant quantum information processing. However, the canonical Majorana platform based on $2e$ TSCs remains computationally constrained. In this work, we find a $4e$ TSC that overcomes these constraints by combining a charge-$4e$ condensate with an Abelian chiral $\mathbb{Z}_3$ topological order in an intertwined fashion. Remarkably, this $4e$ TSC can be obtained by proliferating vortex-antivortex pairs in a stack of two $2e$ $p+ip$ TSCs, or by melting a $\nu=2/3$ quantum Hall state. Specific to this TSC, the $hc/(4e)$ fluxes act as charge-conjugation defects in the topological order, whose braiding with anyons transmutes anyons into their antiparticles. This symmetry enrichment leads to $\mathbb{Z}_3$ parafermion zero modes trapped in the elementary vortex cores, which naturally encode qutrits. Braiding the parafermion defects alone generates the full many-qutrit Clifford group. We further show that a simple single-probe interferometric measurement enables topologically protected magic-state preparation, promoting Clifford operations to a universal gate set. Importantly, the non-Abelian excitations in the $4e$ TSC are confined to externally controlled defects, making them uniquely identifiable and amenable to controlled creation and motion with superconducting-circuit technology. Our results establish hierarchical electron aggregation as a complementary principle for engineering topological quantum matter with enhanced computational power.

Authors: Mathias Boström, Drew F. Parsons
Abstract: This manuscript presents an historical perspective prepared by Barry Ninham and Colin Pask in 1969 on the connection between quantum electrodynamics theory and nucleon interactions. A new theory of strong interactions based on electromagnetic considerations is proposed. Energy and force range magnitudes are correctly given. A new theory of the pion emerges and the pion mass and lifetime are calculated. No strong interaction coupling constant is required.

Title: Deep networks learn to parse uniform-depth context-free languages from local statistics
Authors: Jack T. Parley, Francesco Cagnetta, Matthieu Wyart
Abstract: Understanding how the structure of language can be learned from sentences alone is a central question in both cognitive science and machine learning. Studies of the internal representations of Large Language Models (LLMs) support their ability to parse text when predicting the next word, while representing semantic notions independently of surface form. Yet, which data statistics make these feats possible, and how much data is required, remain largely unknown. Probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFGs) provide a tractable testbed for studying these questions. However, prior work has focused either on the post-hoc characterization of the parsing-like algorithms used by trained networks; or on the learnability of PCFGs with fixed syntax, where parsing is unnecessary. Here, we (i) introduce a tunable class of PCFGs in which both the degree of ambiguity and the correlation structure across scales can be controlled; (ii) provide a learning mechanism -- an inference algorithm inspired by the structure of deep convolutional networks -- that links learnability and sample complexity to specific language statistics; and (iii) validate our predictions empirically across deep convolutional and transformer-based architectures. Overall, we propose a unifying framework where correlations at different scales lift local ambiguities, enabling the emergence of hierarchical representations of the data.

Title: Quantum-controlled synthetic materials
Authors: Andrei Vrajitoarea, Gabrielle Roberts, Kaden R. A. Hazzard, Jonathan Simon, David I. Schuster
Abstract: Analog quantum simulators and digital quantum computers are two distinct paradigms driving near-term applications in modern quantum science, from probing many-body phenomena to identifying computational advantage over classical systems. A transformative opportunity on the horizon is merging the high-fidelity many-body evolution in analog simulators with the robust control and measurement of digital machines. Such a hybrid platform would unlock new capabilities in state preparation, characterization and dynamical control. Here, we embed digital quantum control in the analog evolution of a synthetic quantum material by entangling the lattice potential landscape of a Bose-Hubbard circuit with an ancilla qubit. This Hamiltonian-level control induces dynamics under a superposition of different lattice configurations and guides the many-body system to novel strongly-correlated states where different phases of matter coexist -- ordering photons into superpositions of solid and fluid eigenstates. Leveraging hybrid control modalities, we adiabatically introduce disorder to localize the photons into an entangled cat state and enhance its coherence using a many-body echo technique. This work illustrates the potential for entangling quantum computers with quantum matter -- synthetic and solid-state -- for advantage in sensing and materials characterization.

Title: U(1) lattice gauge theory and string roughening on a triangular Rydberg array
Authors: Lisa Bombieri, Torsten V. Zache, Hannes Pichler, Daniel González-Cuadra
Abstract: Lattice gauge theories (LGTs) describe fundamental interactions in particle physics. A central phenomenon in these theories is confinement, which binds quarks and antiquarks into hadrons through the formation of string-like flux tubes of gauge fields. Simulating confinement dynamics is a challenging task, but recent advances in quantum simulation are enabling the exploration of LGTs in regimes beyond the reach of classical computation. For analog devices, a major difficulty is the realization of strong plaquette interactions, which generate string fluctuations that can drive a roughening transition. Understanding string roughening -- where strong transversal functions lead to an effective restoration of translational symmetry at long distances -- is of central importance in the study of confinement. In this work, we show that string roughening emerges naturally in an analog Rydberg quantum simulator. We first map a triangular Rydberg array onto a (2+1)D U(1) LGT where plaquette terms appear as first-order processes. We study flux strings connecting static charges and demonstrate that, near a deconfined quantum critical point, the string exhibits logarithmic growth of its transverse width as the separation between charges increases, along with the universal Lüscher correction to the confining potential -- both signatures of string roughening. Finally, we investigate the real-time dynamics of an initially rigid string, observing large fluctuations after quenching into the roughening regime, as well as string breaking via particle-pair creation. Our results indicate that rough strings can be realized in experimentally accessible quantum simulators, opening the door to detailed studies of how strong fluctuations influence string-breaking dynamics.

Title: Holographic Charged Transport with Higher Derivatives
Authors: Alex Buchel, Sera Cremonini, Mohammad Moezzi, George Tringas
Abstract: We compute the first-order hydrodynamic transport coefficients (shear viscosity $\eta$, bulk viscosity $\zeta$, and charge conductivity $\sigma$) for a broad class of strongly coupled, four-dimensional charged relativistic gauge theory plasma with holographic gravitational duals containing higher-derivative corrections. The landscape of our holographic models captures non-conformal gauge theories with an arbitrary number of relevant coupling constants and a general scalar potential in the gravitational dual, allowing for a systematic exploration of charged transport along generic holographic RG flows. The leading-order higher-derivative corrections probe gauge theories with non-equal central charges $c\ne a$ at the ultraviolet fixed point, and enable the engineering of diverse temperature and charge density profiles for the viscosities and the conductivity. Our results establish the membrane paradigm in higher-derivative holographic models: all the transport coefficients are extracted from the black brane horizon values of the gravitational scalars, and various functions defining the gravitational holographic dual.

Title: Krylov Distribution
Authors: Mohsen Alishahiha, Mohammad Javad Vasli
Abstract: We introduce the Krylov distribution $\mathcal{D}(\xi)$, a static Krylov-space diagnostic that characterizes how inverse-energy response is organized in Hilbert space. The central object is the resolvent-dressed state $(H-\xi)^{-1}|\psi_0\rangle$, whose decomposition in the Krylov basis generated from a reference state defines a normalized distribution over Krylov levels. Unlike conventional spectral functions, which resolve response solely along the energy axis, the Krylov distribution captures how the resolvent explores the dynamically accessible subspace as the spectral parameter $\xi$ is varied. Using asymptotic analysis, exact results in solvable models, and numerical studies of an interacting spin chain, we identify three universal regimes: saturation outside the spectral support, extensive growth within continuous spectra, and sublinear or logarithmic scaling near spectral edges and quantum critical points. We further show that fidelity susceptibility and the quantum geometric tensor admit natural decompositions in terms of Krylov-resolved resolvent amplitudes.

Title: Characterizing Quantum Error Correction Performance of Radiation-induced Errors
Authors: Paul G. Baity, Anuj K. Nayak, Lav R. Varshney, Nicholas Jeon, Byung-Jun Yoon, Peter J. Love, Adolfy Hoisie
Abstract: Radiation impacts are a current challenge with computing on superconducting-based quantum devices because they can lead to widespread correlated errors across the device. Such errors can be problematic for quantum error correction (QEC) codes, which are generally designed to correct independent errors. To address this, we have developed a computational model to simulate the effects of radiation impacts on QEC performance. This is achieved by building from recently developed models of quasiparticle density, mapping radiation-induced qubit error rates onto a quantum error channel and simulation of a simple surface code. We also provide a performance metric to quantify the resilience of a QEC code to radiation impacts. Additionally, we sweep various parameters of chip design to test mitigation strategies for improved QEC performance. Our model approach is holistic, allowing for modular performance testing of error mitigation strategies and chip and code designs.

Title: A Unified Wake Topology Map for He II Counterflow Past a Cylinder
Authors: Yingxuan Hu, Wenling Huang, Shihao Yang, Limin Qiu, Wei Guo, Shiran Bao
Abstract: Thermal counterflow of superfluid $^4$He past a cylinder produces quasi-steady eddies not only downstream but also anomalously upstream. However, the mechanism and organizing principles behind the observed multistable wake topologies (0-, 2-, 4-, and 6-vortex states) have remained unclear. We show that the full spectrum of reported normal-fluid wake states is captured numerically with a two-fluid model coupled to Vinen's vortex-line-density equation. Our simulations further reveal that the superfluid component can also develop anomalous upstream eddies, a feature not previously reported. We trace these behaviors to a self-organized zone of enhanced mutual-friction dissipation near the cylinder shoulders that reshapes the effective obstacle, drives upstream eddies in both components, and suppresses intrinsic wake oscillations in the normal fluid. Guided by this mechanism, we perform systematic parameter scans and construct a unified phase diagram in terms of the normal-fluid Reynolds number $Re_n$ and a dimensionless interaction number $N$, separating inertia- and mutual-friction-controlled transitions and delineating the parameter windows for the discrete wake topologies. These results turn a striking phenomenology into a predictive map and establish mutual-friction feedback as a robust route to unusual wake structures in quantum fluids.

Title: Direct laser writing of high aspect ratio nanochannels for nanofluidics
Authors: Stoffel D. Janssens, Meissha Ayu Ardini, David Vázquez-Cortés, Cathal Cassidy, Eliot Fried
Abstract: Nanochannels with high width-to-height aspect ratios are desirable for many applications, particularly those requiring optical access, but remain challenging to fabricate. In this work, the direct laser writing of such channels between diamond films and glass substrates is introduced. As previously reported, laser light can transform a portion of diamond film into a nanostrip. The strip induces delamination of the surrounding film, causing the formation of two nanochannels with triangular cross-sections. Here, it is demonstrated that nanochannels with rectangular cross-sections and width-to-height aspect ratios exceeding fifty can form between pairs of nanostrips. With atomic force microscopy, the maximum strip spacing that produces these nanochannels is investigated, and it is demonstrated that the reflectance of the channels can be measured by microspectrophotometry. The microstructure of the nanochannels, including nanostrips, and processes that occur during laser writing are inferred from transmission electron microscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy. By fabricating a nanofluidic device and using microspectrophotometry, it is found that the nanochannels fill with water through capillary action, are resistant to clogging, and are mechanically stable against water filling. A versatile platform for producing high-aspect-ratio nanochannels that are optically accessible and fluidically functional is presented, thereby expanding opportunities for advanced applications.

Title: High-Dimensional Limit of Stochastic Gradient Flow via Dynamical Mean-Field Theory
Authors: Sota Nishiyama, Masaaki Imaizumi
Abstract: Modern machine learning models are typically trained via multi-pass stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with small batch sizes, and understanding their dynamics in high dimensions is of great interest. However, an analytical framework for describing the high-dimensional asymptotic behavior of multi-pass SGD with small batch sizes for nonlinear models is currently missing. In this study, we address this gap by analyzing the high-dimensional dynamics of a stochastic differential equation called a \emph{stochastic gradient flow} (SGF), which approximates multi-pass SGD in this regime. In the limit where the number of data samples $n$ and the dimension $d$ grow proportionally, we derive a closed system of low-dimensional and continuous-time equations and prove that it characterizes the asymptotic distribution of the SGF parameters. Our theory is based on the dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) and is applicable to a wide range of models encompassing generalized linear models and two-layer neural networks. We further show that the resulting DMFT equations recover several existing high-dimensional descriptions of SGD dynamics as special cases, thereby providing a unifying perspective on prior frameworks such as online SGD and high-dimensional linear regression. Our proof builds on the existing DMFT technique for gradient flow and extends it to handle the stochasticity in SGF using tools from stochastic calculus.

Title: Shallow Trap States Control Electrical Performance of Amorphous Oxide Semiconductor Thin-Film Transistors
Authors: Måns J. Mattsson, Jinhan Lee, Christopher E. Malmberg, Jared Parker, Kyle T. Vogt, Hyemi Kim, Minji Hong, Pilsang Yun, Daewon Ha, Taeyoon Lee, Paul H.-Y. Cheong, John F. Wager, Matt W. Graham
Abstract: The performance of n-type amorphous oxide semiconductor thin-film transistors (TFTs) is largely controlled by the density of states (DoS) near the conduction band mobility edge. Here, the full subgap DoS of amorphous InGaZnO (a-IGZO) TFTs, used in display panels and dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) development, is measured by ultrabroadband photoconduction (UP-DoS) microscopy to within 0.1 eV of the mobility edge. The measured subgap DoS for 25 TFT processing conditions accurately predicts each transfer curve, showing how shallow defect states are electron traps that rigidly tune subthreshold swing, threshold voltage and drift mobility. For a set of TFTs, the subthreshold transfer characteristics can be independently simulated from the experimental shallow defect DoS, with no adjustable parameters. The full transfer curve is simulated by introducing a single parameter: the conduction band tail energy. Additionally, the simulation reveals that the shallow trap density controlling subthreshold behavior can be directly extracted from transfer curves. Finally, a systematic In-enrichment study, combined with DFT+U DoS simulations, enables identification of vacancy cation coordination environments for all experimentally observed subgap peaks. The dominant trap controlling conventional a-IGZO TFT performance is centered at ~0.32 eV below the conduction band mobility edge and is assigned to a Ga-Ga-In oxygen vacancy defect.

Title: Mean-Field Theory for Heider Balance under Heterogeneous Social Temperatures
Authors: Zhen Li, Yuki Izumida
Abstract: Heider balance theory provides a fundamental framework for understanding the formation of friendly and hostile relations in social networks. Existing stochastic formulations typically assume a uniform social temperature, implying that all interpersonal relations fluctuate with the same intensity. However, studies show that social interactions are highly heterogeneous, with broad variability in stability, volatility, and susceptibility to change. In this work, we introduce a generalized Heider balance model on a complete graph in which each link is assigned its own social temperature. Within a mean-field formulation, we derive a distribution-dependent self-consistency condition for the collective opinion state and identify the criteria governing the transition between polarized and non-polarized configurations. This framework reveals how the entire distribution of interaction heterogeneity shapes the macroscopic behavior of the system. We show that the functional form of the inverse-temperature distribution, in particular whether it is light-tailed or heavy-tailed, leads to qualitatively distinct phase diagrams. We also establish universal bounds for the critical transition, where the homogeneous-temperature limit provides a universal lower bound for the critical mean of an inverse-temperature distribution governing the transition. Numerical simulations confirm the theoretical predictions and highlight the nontrivial effects introduced by heterogeneity. Our results provide a unified route to understanding structural balance in realistic social systems and lay the groundwork for extensions incorporating fluctuations beyond mean field, external fields, and network topologies beyond the complete graph.

Title: Local Certification of Many-Body Steady States
Authors: Miguel Frías Pérez, Antonio Acín
Abstract: We present a relaxation-based method to bound expectation values on the steady state of dissipative many-body quantum systems described by master equations of the Lindblad form. Instead of targeting to represent the entire state, we promote the reduced density matrices to our variables and enforce the constraints that are imposed on them by consistency with a global steady state. The resulting constraints have the form of a semidefinite program, which allows us to efficiently bound the values a given expectation value can take in the steady state. Our results show fast convergence of the bounds with the size of the reduced density matrices, giving very competitive predictions for the steady state of several one- and two-dimensional models for an arbitrary number of particles.

Title: Habitat heterogeneity and dispersal network structure as drivers of metacommunity dynamics
Authors: Davide Bernardi, Alice Doimo, Giorgio Nicoletti, Prajwal Padmanabha, Andrea Rinaldo, Samir Suweis, Sandro Azaele, Amos Maritan
Abstract: Spatial structure and species interactions jointly shape the dynamics and biodiversity of ecological systems, yet most theoretical models either neglect spatial heterogeneity or sacrifice analytical tractability. Here, we provide a unified microscopic, mechanistic framework for deriving effective metapopulation and metacommunity models from individual-based ecological dynamics on arbitrary dispersal networks. The resulting coarse-grained description features an effective dispersal kernel that encodes both microscopic dynamical parameters and network topology. Based on this framework, we demonstrate exact analytical results for species persistence in both homogeneous and heterogeneous landscapes, including a generalization of the classical concept of metapopulation capacity to non-uniform local extinction rates. Incorporating stochasticity arising from finite carrying capacities, we obtain a reduced one-dimensional description that reveals universal finite-size scaling laws for extinction times and fluctuations. Extending the approach to multiple competing species, we prove that in homogeneous environments monodominance can be avoided only in a fine-tuned, marginally stable coexistence state, and that the classic metapopulation capacity gives only a necessary but not sufficient condition for persistence. We demonstrate that heterogeneous habitats can support stable coexistence, but only above a critical level of heterogeneity. Finally, we outline how additional ecological processes can be systematically incorporated within the same formalism. Together, these results provide analytical benchmarks and a general route for constructing spatially explicit ecological theories based on an interpretable underlying mechanistic foundation.

Title: Diffusiophoresis of a non-polar fluid droplet laden with soluble ionic surfactants
Authors: Subrata Majhi, Somnath Bhattacharyya
Abstract: We investigate the diffusiophoresis of a non-polarizable droplet laden with soluble ionic surfactant, for which the surface charge arises from adsorption of surfactant at the fluid-fluid interface. Unlike previous studies that assume either a fixed surface charge or instantaneous equilibrium between the interface and the adjacent electrolyte, we formulate the interfacial transport based on the mass-balance framework incorporating Langmuir adsorption-desorption kinetics and finite surface diffusivity. The coupled electrokinetic problem is solved using a perturbation approach. Analytical expressions for the droplet mobility and interfacial velocity are derived for insoluble surfactants. We demonstrate that assuming uniform, immobile surface charge leads to unphysical predictions, including negative chemiphoresis and singular mobility, whereas allowing the surface charge to evolve through interfacial surfactant redistribution yields continuous and physically consistent droplet diffusiophoresis. Interfacial kinetic exchange is found to play a central role. Increasing the desorption rate enhances surfactant redistribution and Marangoni stress, weakens the negative mobility, reverses the direction of motion through competition between electrophoretic and chemiphoretic contributions, and subsequently leads to a strong enhancement of positive mobility before eventual saturation in the transport-limited regime. The dependence of mobility on viscosity ratio and electrolyte composition of different salts further reveals how mixed electrolytes provides a robust means of tuning droplet motion. This study highlights the critical role of finite-rate surfactant dynamics and interfacial transport in determining the diffusiophoresis of fluid particles, with implications for manipulating droplets in microfluidic and varying-salinity environments.

Title: Rare Event Analysis of Large Language Models
Authors: Jake McAllister Dorman, Edward Gillman, Dominic C. Rose, Jamie F. Mair, Juan P. Garrahan
Abstract: Being probabilistic models, during inference large language models (LLMs) display rare events: behaviour that is far from typical but highly significant. By definition all rare events are hard to see, but the enormous scale of LLM usage means that events completely unobserved during development are likely to become prominent in deployment. Here we present an end-to-end framework for the systematic analysis of rare events in LLMs. We provide a practical implementation spanning theory, efficient generation strategies, probability estimation and error analysis, which we illustrate with concrete examples. We outline extensions and applications to other models and contexts, highlighting the generality of the concepts and techniques presented here.

Title: Nonlinear quadrupole topological insulators
Authors: Rujiang Li, Wencai Wang, Yongtao Jia, Ying Liu, Pengfei Li, Boris A. Malomed
Abstract: Higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs) represent a family of topological phases that go beyond the conventional bulkboundary correspondence. d-dimensional n-th order HOTIs maintain (d - n)-dimensional gapless boundary states (in particular, zero-dimensional corner states in the case of d = n = 2). HOTIs of the Wannier type cam be extended into the nonlinear regime. Another prominent class of HOTIs, in the form of multipole insulators, was investigated only in the linear regime, due to the challenge of simultaneously achieving both negative hopping and strong nonlinearity. Here we propose the concept of nonlinear quadrupole topological insulators (NLQTIs) and report their experimental realization in an electric circuit lattice. Quench-initiated dynamics gives rise to nonlinear topological corner states and topologically trivial corner solitons, in weakly and strongly nonlinear regimes, respectively. Furthermore, we reveal the formation of two distinct types of bulk solitons, one existing in the middle finite gap under the action of weak nonlinearity, and another one found in the semi-infinite gap under strong nonlinearity. This work realizes another member of the nonlinear HOTI family, suggesting directions for exploring novel solitons across a broad range of topological insulators.

Title: Symmetry and localisation in causally constrained quantum operator dynamics
Authors: Marcell D. Kovács, Christopher J. Turner, Lluís Masanes
Abstract: This paper explores the connection between causality and many-body dynamics by studying the algebraic structure of tri-partite unitaries ('walls') which permanently arrest local operator spreading in their time-periodic evolution. We show that the resulting causally independent subsystems arise from the invariance of an embedded sub-algebra in the system (ie. a generalised symmetry) that leads to the splitting of operator space into commuting sub-algebras. The commutant structure of the invariant algebra is then used to construct local conserved quantities. Using representation theory of finite matrix algebras, the general form of wall gates is derived as unitary automorphisms. Taking causal independence as a minimal model for non-ergodic dynamics, we study its effect on probes of many-body quantum chaos. We prove an entanglement area-law due to local constraints and we study its stability against projective measurements. In a random ensemble exhibiting causal independence, we compare spectral correlations with the universal (chaotic) ensemble using the spectral form factor. Our results offer a rigorous understanding of locally constrained quantum dynamics from a quantum information perspective.

Title: Non-reciprocal Binary-fluid Turbulence
Authors: Biswajit Maji, Nadia Bihari Padhan, Rahul Pandit
Abstract: Although effective non-reciprocal interactions have been investigated in a variety of fields, their consequences have not been explored in hydrodynamical turbulence. We initiate such an exploration by introducing non-reciprocal binary-fluid tubulence and uncover its properties by developing a two-dimensional (2D) Non-Reciprocal Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes (NRCHNS) model. We show that, as we increase the strength of the non-reciprocal terms, this model displays a hitherto unanticipated type of turbulence, with an inverse cascade of energy and an energy spectrum $E(k)\sim k^{-5/3}$, reminiscent of the well-known inverse cascade in forced, 2D fluid turbulence, but distinct from it, in so far as it develops a non-reciprocal flux $\mathbf J$. We demonstrate how NRCHNS turbulence suppresses $J(t) = |\mathbf J|$, as the Reynolds number increases. We compare and contrast 2D NRCHNS turbulence with its fluid-turbulence counterpart by examining spectra, fluxes, spectral balances, flow topologies, and signatures of multifractality.

Title: Structural chirality measurements and computation of handedness in periodic solids
Authors: Fernando Gómez-Ortiz, Mauro Fava, Emma E. McCabe, Aldo H. Romero, Eric Bousquet
Abstract: We compare the various chirality measures most widely used in the literature to quantify chiral symmetry in extended solids, i.e., the continuous chirality measure, the Hausdorff distance, and the angular momentum. By studying these functions in an algebraically tractable case, we can evaluate their strengths and weaknesses when applied to more complex crystals. Going beyond those classical calculations, we propose a new method to quantify the handedness of a crystal based on a pseudoscalar function, i.e., the helicity. This quantity, borrowed from hydrodynamics, can be computed from the eigenvector carrying the system from the high-symmetry non-chiral phase to the low-symmetry chiral phase. Different model systems like K$_3$NiO$_2$, CsCuCl$_3$ and MgTi$_2$O$_4$ are used as test cases where we show the superior interest of using helicity to quantify chirality together with the handedness distinction.

Title: Tailoring Bound State Geometry in High-Dimensional Non-Hermitian Systems
Authors: Ao Yang, Zixi Fang, Kai Zhang, Chen Fang
Abstract: It is generally believed that the non-Hermitian effect (NHSE), due to its non-reciprocal nature, creates barriers for the appearance of impurity bound states. In this paper, we find that in two and higher dimensions, the presence of geometry-dependent skin effect eliminates this barrier such that even an infinitesimal impurity potential can confine bound states in this type of non-Hermitian systems. By examining bound states around Bloch saddle points, we find that non-Hermiticity can disrupt the isotropy of bound states, resulting in concave dumbbell-shaped bound states. Our work reveals a geometry transition of bound state between concavity and convexity in high-dimensional non-Hermitian systems, offering theoretical insights for the experimental manipulation of bound states.

Title: Tissue-Intrinsic Shape Mechanics in Growing Pre-Migratory Tumor Spheroids
Authors: Urban Železnik, Matej Krajnc, Tanmoy Sarkar
Abstract: One of the hallmarks of pre-migratory tumors is the progressive loss of compact morphology. To investigate how tumors may intrinsically regulate their shape during growth, we employ a three-dimensional (3D) vertex model of multicellular aggregates that incorporates key structural features of tumor spheroids, including its surface, a proliferative rim, and a necrotic core. Focusing exclusively on tumor-intrinsic mechanical interactions, we examine how their collective effects guide morphological evolution en route to metastasis. We show that spheroids acquire lobulated morphologies through an interplay between differential tensions at the spheroid surface and the living-necrotic interface (LNI), together with differential growth within the proliferative rim. In addition, spheroid shapes can be substantially modulated by tissue rheological properties emerging from active, cell-scale forces. Our cell- and tissue-scale simulations of tumor morphologies are enabled by a computational framework that overcomes a major limitation of 3D vertex models - the lack of cell-division - by introducing a graph-based polyhedral-division algorithm within the Graph Vertex Model (GVM).

Title: Universal Negative Energetic Elasticity in Polymer Chains: Crossovers among Random, Self-Avoiding, and Neighbor-Avoiding Walks
Authors: Nobu C. Shirai, Naoyuki Sakumichi
Abstract: Negative energetic elasticity in gels challenges the conventional understanding of gel elasticity; despite extensive research, a concise explanation remains elusive. In this study, we use the weakly self-avoiding walk (the Domb-Joyce model; DJ model) and interacting self-avoiding walk (ISAW) to investigate the emergence of negative energetic elasticity in polymer chains. Using exact enumeration, we show that both the DJ model and ISAW exhibit negative energetic elasticity, which is caused by effective soft-repulsive interactions between polymer segments. Moreover, we find that a universal scaling law for the internal energy of both models, with a common exponent of $7/4$, holds consistently across both random-walk-self-avoiding-walk and self-avoiding-walk-neighbor-avoiding-walk crossovers. These findings suggest that negative energetic elasticity is a fundamental and universal property of polymer networks and chains.

Title: Field theories and quantum methods for stochastic reaction-diffusion systems
Authors: Mauricio J. del Razo, Tommaso Lamma, Wout Merbis
Abstract: Complex systems are composed of many particles or agents that move and interact with one another. The underlying mathematical framework to model many of these systems must incorporate the spatial transport of particles and their interactions, as well as changes to their copy numbers, all of which can be formulated in terms of stochastic reaction-diffusion processes. The probabilistic representation of these processes is complex because of combinatorial aspects arising due to nonlinear interactions and varying particle numbers. This review presents the main field theory representations of stochastic reaction-diffusion systems, which handle these issues `under-the-hood'. First, we focus on bringing techniques familiar to theoretical physicists -- such as second quantization, Fock space, and path integrals -- back into the classical domain of reaction-diffusion systems. We demonstrate how various field theory representations can all be unified under a single basis-independent representation. We then extend existing quantum-based methods and notation to work directly on the level of the unifying representation, and we illustrate how they can be used to consistently obtain previous known results, such as numerical discretizations and relations between model parameters at multiple scales. Throughout the work, we contextualize how these representations mirror well-known models of chemical physics depending on their spatial resolution, as well as the corresponding macroscopic limits. The framework presented here may find applications in a diverse set of scientific fields, including physical chemistry, theoretical ecology, epidemiology, game theory and socio-economical models of complex systems. The presentation is done in a self-contained educational and unifying manner such that it can be followed by researchers across several fields.

Title: Tachyonic and parametric instabilities in an extended bosonic Josephson junction
Authors: Laura Batini, Sebastian Erne, Jörg Schmiedmayer, Jürgen Berges
Abstract: We study the dynamics and decay of quantum phase coherence for Bose-Einstein condensates in tunnel-coupled quantum wires. The two elongated Bose-Einstein condensates exhibit a wide variety of dynamic phenomena where quantum fluctuations can lead to a rapid loss of phase coherence. We investigate the phenomenon of self-trapping in the relative population imbalance of the two condensates, particularly $\pi$-trapped oscillations that occur when also the relative phase is trapped. Though this state appears stable in mean-field descriptions, the $\pi$-trapped state becomes dynamically unstable due to quantum fluctuations. Nonequilibrium instabilities result in the generation of pairs excited from the condensate to higher momentum modes. We identify tachyonic instabilities, which are associated with imaginary parts of the dispersion relation, and parametric resonance instabilities that are triggered by oscillations of the relative phase and populations. At early times, we compute the instability chart of the characteristic modes through a linearized analysis and identify the underlying physical process. At later times, the primary instabilities trigger secondary instabilities due to the build-up of non-linearities. We perform numerical simulations in the Truncated Wigner approximation in order to observe the dynamics also in this non-linear regime. Furthermore, we discuss realistic parameters for experimental realizations of the $\pi$-trapped state in ultracold atom setups.

Title: Dynamical correlations and nonequilibrium sum rules in photodoped Hubbard ladders
Authors: E. Merhej, J. P. Hague, R. M. Konik, A. J. A. James
Abstract: Using matrix product state techniques we study the nonequilibrium dynamical response of the half-filled Hubbard ladder when subject to an optical pump. Optical pumping offers a way of producing and manipulating new strongly correlated phenomena by suppressing existing magnetic correlations. The ladder allows the effects of pump directionality to be investigated, and compared to a single chain it has strong spin-charge coupling and a fully gapped excitation spectrum, promising different nonequilibrium physics. We compute time-dependent correlations, including the nonequilibrium dynamical structure factors for spin and charge. By deriving a combined spin-charge sum rule that applies both in and out-of-equilibrium, we show that spectral weight is pumped directly from the antiferromagnetic spin response into a low energy $\omega\sim 0$ charge response below the Mott gap. The transfer of weight is pump direction dependent: pumping directed along the legs disrupts magnetic correlations more than pumping in the rung direction, even if the post pump energy density is similar. The charge correlation length is dramatically enhanced by the pump, whilst the spin correlations are most strongly suppressed at nearest and next-nearest neighbour spacings. After the pump the system is in a nonthermal correlated metallic state, with gapless charge excitations and approximately equal spin and charge correlation lengths, emphasising the importance of treating these degrees of freedom on an equal footing in nonequilibrium systems.

Title: Universal finite-size scaling in high-dimensional critical phenomena
Authors: Yucheng Liu, Jiwoon Park, Gordon Slade
Abstract: We present a new unified theory of critical finite-size scaling for lattice statistical mechanical models with periodic boundary conditions above the upper critical dimension. Our theory is based on recent mathematically rigorous results for linear and branched polymers, multi-component spin systems, and percolation. Both short-range and long-range interactions are included. The universal finite-size scaling is inherited from the scaling of the system unwrapped to the infinite lattice. We also present conjectures for universal scaling profiles for the susceptibility and two-point function plateau in a critical window. For free boundary conditions, the universal scaling has been proven to apply at a pseudocritical point for hierarchical spins, and we conjecture that this holds generally.

Title: Boundary curvature-dependent dynamical trapping of undulating worms
Authors: Sohum Kapadia, Arshad Kudrolli
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of {\it Lumbriculus variegatus} in polygonal chambers and show that the worms align with the boundaries as they move forward and get dynamically trapped at concave corners over prolonged periods of time before escaping. We develop a kinematic model to calculate and describe the evolution of the worm's mean body orientation angle relative to the boundary. Performing simulations with a minimal active elastic dumbbell model, we then show that both the boundary aligning and corner trapping behavior of the worm are captured by steric interactions with the boundaries. The dimensionless ratio of the strength of forward motion and diffusion caused by the worm's undulatory and peristaltic strokes is shown to determine the boundary alignment dynamics and trapping time scales of the worm. The simulations show that that the body angle with the boundary while entering the concave corner is important to the trapping time distributions with shallow angles leading to faster escapes. Our study demonstrates that directed motion and limited angular diffusion can give rise to aggregation which can mimic shelter seeking behavior in slender undulating limbless worms even when thigmotaxis or contact seeking behavior is absent.

Title: Learning Metal Microstructural Heterogeneity through Spatial Mapping of Diffraction Latent Space Features
Authors: Mathieu Calvat, Chris Bean, Dhruv Anjaria, Hyoungryul Park, Haoren Wang, Kenneth Vecchio, J.C. Stinville
Abstract: To leverage advancements in machine learning for metallic materials design and property prediction, it is crucial to develop a data-reduced representation of metal microstructures that surpasses the limitations of current physics-based discrete microstructure descriptors. This need is particularly relevant for metallic materials processed through additive manufacturing, which exhibit complex hierarchical microstructures that cannot be adequately described using the conventional metrics typically applied to wrought materials. Furthermore, capturing the spatial heterogeneity of microstructures at the different scales is necessary within such framework to accurately predict their properties. To address these challenges, we propose the physical spatial mapping of metal diffraction latent space features. This approach integrates (i) point diffraction data encoding via variational autoencoders or contrastive learning and (ii) the physical mapping of the encoded values. Together these steps offer a method offers a novel means to comprehensively describe metal microstructures. We demonstrate this approach on a wrought and additively manufactured alloy, showing that it effectively encodes microstructural information and enables direct identification of microstructural heterogeneity not directly possible by physics-based models. This data-reduced microstructure representation opens the application of machine learning models in accelerating metallic material design and accurately predicting their properties.

Title: Topological Symmetry Breaking in Antagonistic Dynamics
Authors: Giulio Iannelli, Pablo Villegas, Tommaso Gili, Andrea Gabrielli
Abstract: A dynamic concordia discors, a finely tuned equilibrium between opposing forces, is hypothesized to drive historical transformations. Similarly, a precise interplay of excitation and inhibition, often approximated by an 80:20 ratio, underlies the normal functionality of neural systems. In artificial neural networks, reinforcement learning enables the fine-tuning of internal signed connections, optimizing adaptive responses to complex stimuli and ensuring robust performance. Engineered systems with antagonistic interactions remain comparatively unexplored, particularly because their emergent phases are closely linked to frustration mechanisms in the underlying network. In this context, spin-glass theory has shown how apparently uncontrollable non-ergodic and chaotic behavior can arise from the complex interplay of competing interactions and frustration among units, leading to multiple metastable states that prevent the system from exploring all accessible configurations over time. Here, we show how topology constrains dynamics in systems with antagonistic interactions. We use the signed Laplacian operator to demonstrate how fundamental topological defects in lattices and networks percolate, shaping the geometrical structure and the complex energy landscape of the system. This reveals novel and highly robust multistable phases and establishes deep connections with spin glasses when thermal noise is considered, providing a natural topological and algebraic description of emergent multistability and non-ergodicity in frustrated systems.

Title: Angle-Dependent Magnetoresistance Induced by Interface-Generated Spin Current in RuO$_2$/Permalloy Heterostructures
Authors: Akashdeep Akashdeep, Ewiese Mohammad Ababneh, Christin Schmitt, Edgar Galíndez-Ruales, Felix Fuhrmann, Timo Kuschel, Mathias Kläui, Vivek Pravin Amin, Gerhard Jakob
Abstract: Altermagnets, a recently discovered class of magnetic materials exhibiting ferromagnetic-like spin-split bands and antiferromagnetic-like compensated magnetic order, have attracted significant interest for next-generation spintronic applications. Ruthenium dioxide (RuO2) has emerged as a promising altermagnetic candidate due to its compensated antiparallel magnetic order and strong spin-split electronic bands. However, recent experimental and theoretical reports also suggest that RuO2 may be non-magnetic in its ground state, underscoring the need for deeper investigations into its magnetic character. Specifically, the (100)-oriented RuO2 films are expected to generate spin currents with transverse spin polarization parallel to the Néel vector. Here, we investigate magnetotransport in epitaxial RuO2/Permalloy (Py) heterostructures to examine spin Hall magnetoresistance and interfacial effects generated in such systems. Our measurements reveal a pronounced negative angular-dependent magnetoresistance for variation of magnetic field direction perpendicular to the charge current direction. Detailed temperature-, magnetic field-, and crystallographic orientation-dependent measurements indicate that interface-generated spin current (IGSC) at the RuO2/Py interface predominantly governs the observed magnetoresistance. This shows that strong interface effects dominate over possible altermagnetic contributions from RuO2. Our results show that the role of interface-generated spin currents is crucial and should not be overlooked in studies of altermagnetic systems. A critical step in this direction is disentangling interfacial from altermagnetic contributions. The insight into interfacial contributions from altermagnetic influences is essential for the advancement of RuO2 based spintronic memory and sensing applications.

Title: Clogging-flowing transition of granular media in a two-dimensional vertical pipe
Authors: Y. Zhou, M. Li, Y. Guan, Y. Wang, Y. Liu, Z. Zou
Abstract: We experimentally and numerically investigate the clogging behavior of granular materials in a two-dimensional vertical pipe. The nonmonotonicity of clogging probability found in a cylindrical vertical pipe [López et al., Phys. Rev. E 102, 010902 (2020)] is also observed in the two-dimensional case. We numerically demonstrate that the clogging probability strongly correlates with the friction coefficient $\mu$ in addition to the pipe-to-particle diameter ratio $D/d$. We thus construct a clogging-flowing $D/d$-$\mu$ phase diagram within the $2<D/d<3$ range. Finally, by analyzing the geometrical arrangements of particles and using a simple analysis of forces and torques, we are able to predict the clogging-flowing transition in the $D/d$-$\mu$ phase diagram and explain the mechanism of the observed counterintuitive nonmonotonicity in more detail. We demonstrate that for pipe clogging, friction-mediated force and torque equilibrium are essential for arch formation.

Title: Dirac fermions on a surface with localized strain
Authors: Samuel B. B. Almeida, J. E. G. Silva, C. A. S. Almeida
Abstract: We study the influence of a localized Gaussian deformation on massless Dirac fermions confined to a two-dimensional curved surface. Both in-plane and out-of-plane displacements are considered within the framework of elasticity theory. These deformations couple to the Dirac spinors via the spin connection and the vielbeins, leading to a position-dependent Fermi velocity and an effective geometric potential. We show that the spin connection contributes an attractive potential centered on the deformation and explore how this influences the fermionic density of states. Analytical and numerical solutions reveal the emergence of bound states near the deformation and demonstrate how the Lamé coefficients affect curvature and state localization. Upon introducing an external magnetic field, the effective potential becomes confining at large distances, producing localized Landau levels that concentrate near the deformation. A geometric Aharonov-Bohm phase is identified through the spinor holonomy. These results contribute to the understanding of strain-induced electronic effects in Dirac materials, such as graphene.

Title: Towards dislocation-driven quantum interconnects
Authors: Cunzhi Zhang, Victor Wen-zhe Yu, Yu Jin, Jonah Nagura, Sevim Polat Genlik, Maryam Ghazisaeidi, Giulia Galli
Abstract: A central problem in the deployment of quantum technologies is the realization of robust architectures for quantum interconnects. We propose to engineer interconnects in semiconductors and insulators by patterning spin qubits at dislocations, thus forming quasi one-dimensional lines of entangled point defects. To gain insight into the feasibility and control of dislocation-driven interconnects, we investigate the optical cycle and coherence properties of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond, in proximity of dislocations, using a combination of advanced first-principles calculations. We show that one can engineer spin defects with properties similar to those of their bulk counterparts, including charge stability and a favorable optical cycle, and that NV centers close to dislocations have much improved coherence properties. Finally, we predict optically detected magnetic resonance spectra that may facilitate the experimental identification of specific defect configurations. Our results provide a theoretical foundation for the engineering of one-dimensional arrays of spin defects in the solid state.

Title: Flat-band projected versus fully atomistic twisted bilayer graphene
Authors: Miguel Sánchez Sánchez, Tobias Stauber
Abstract: We benchmark the recently proposed projection method [Phys. Rev. B 111, 205133 (2025)] for magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) across various symmetry-breaking phases at charge neutrality. The flat-band projected solutions agree well with the full tight-binding, with band structures and total energies differing by only a few meV. The projection to the flat bands is justified, owing to the increased gap to the remote bands in the normal state. Moreover, we employ a novel set of order parameters that allow us to visualize the wave functions locally in real space and quantify the breaking of various symmetries in the correlated phases. These order parameters are suitable for characterizing MATBG and generic honeycomb systems.

Title: A Nonlocal Orientation Field Phase-Field Model for Misorientation- and Inclination- Dependent Grain Boundaries
Authors: Xiao Han, Axel van de Walle
Abstract: We propose to incorporate grain boundary (GB) anisotropy in phase-field modeling by extending the standard partial differential equations formulation to include a nonlocal functional of an orientation field. Regardless of the number of grains in the simulation, the model uses a single orientation field and incorporates grain misorientation and inclination information obtained from sampling the orientation field at optimized locations in the vicinity of the grain boundary. The formalism enables simple and precise tuning of GB energy anisotropy while reducing an extensive fitting procedure. The functional includes an explicit GB anisotropy function to control the GB energy as a function of both misorientation and inclination. The model is validated by reproducing the linear grain growth rate, Wulff shapes with varying misorientations and anisotropic coefficients, and analytical equilibrium dihedral angles at triple junctions. Polycrystalline simulations demonstrate grain growth, coalescence, triple junction behavior, and the influence of anisotropy on grain morphology.

Title: Effects of symmetry on coupled rotary molecular motors
Authors: Sara Iranbakhsh, David A. Sivak
Abstract: As engineering advances toward the nanoscale, understanding design principles for molecular motors becomes increasingly valuable. Many molecular motors consist of coupled components transducing one free-energy source into another. Here, we study the performance of coupled rotary molecular motors with different rotational symmetries under constant and scaling driving forces. Under constant driving and strong coupling, symmetry match between the motors decreases the output power. In contrast, under a scaling driving force, the output power is not sensitive to symmetries. However, driving the upstream motor too strongly reduces the downstream motor's output power, leading to a perhaps counterintuitive phenomenon we term disruption, in which the two motors become disconnected. Across both driving schemes, output power peaks at intermediate coupling, confirming the value of flexible coupling. Beyond providing insights into biological motors, these findings could inform the future design of synthetic nanomotors and structure-based drugs.

Title: Design Rules and Discovery of Face-Sharing Hexagonal Perovskites
Authors: M. J. Swamynadhan, Gwan Yeong Jung, Pravan Omprakash, Rohan Mishra
Abstract: Hexagonal perovskites with face-sharing octahedral connectivity are an underexplored class of materials. We propose quantitative design principles for stabilizing face-sharing ABX3 hexagonal perovskites based on a comparative analysis of oxides and sulfides. By mapping structural preferences across a phase-space defined by an electronegativity-corrected tolerance factor and the Shannon radius of the A-site cations, we identify distinct thresholds that separate hexagonal phases from competing cubic polymorphs having corner-sharing octahedral connectivity. Our analysis reveals that sulfides differ significantly from oxides due to the increased covalency of the transition metal-sulfur bonds, which enables broader compositional flexibility. Applying these principles, we predict a set of thermodynamically formable ABO3 and ABS3 compounds that are likely to adopt face-sharing octahedral connectivity. These findings establish a predictive framework for designing hexagonal perovskites, highlighting sulfides as promising candidates for obtaining quasi-one-dimensional materials having transition-metal cations for novel ferroic phenomena.

Title: Gating upconversion electroluminescence in a single molecule via adsorption-induced interaction of unpaired spin
Authors: Vibhuti N. Rai, Christof Holzer, Carsten Rockstuhl, Wulf Wulfhekel, Lukas Gerhard
Abstract: Molecules with unpaired spins (radicals) offer promising alternatives to closed-shell molecules as they are less limited regarding the spin statistics in their electroluminescence. Here, we combine scanning tunneling microscopy induced luminescence and density functional theory to study single vanadyl phthalocyanine molecules, which are stable neutral radicals. Two distinct adsorption geometries of the molecule on NaCl/Au(111) lead to a difference in the interaction of the unpaired electron with the substrate, which in turn allows us to investigate its effects on the light emission process. Remarkably, we observe that up-conversion electroluminescence is gated by the adsorption geometry of the molecule, an effect we attribute to a reordering of excited states and enhanced excited state transition probabilities. The profound influence of the unpaired electron via state reordering opens new possibilities for tuning not only molecular electroluminescence but also many other spin dependent phenomena.

Title: Enhancement of the WS$_2$ A$_{1\text{g}}$ Raman Mode in MoS$_2$/WS$_2$ Heterostructures
Authors: Annika Bergmann-Iwe, Tomasz Woźniak, Mustafa Hemaid, Oisín Garrity, Patryk Kusch, Rico Schwartz, Ziyang Gan, Antony George, Ludger Wirtz, Stephanie Reich, Andrey Turchanin, Tobias Korn
Abstract: When combined into van der Waals heterostructures, transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers enable the exploration of novel physics beyond their unique individual properties. However, for interesting phenomena such as interlayer charge transfer and interlayer excitons to occur, precise control of the interface and ensuring high-quality interlayer contact is crucial. Here, we investigate bilayer heterostructures fabricated by combining chemical-vapor-deposition-grown MoS$_2$ and exfoliated WS$_2$ monolayers, allowing us to form several heterostructures with various twist angles within one preparation step. In case of sufficiently good interfacial contact, evaluated by photoluminescence quenching, we observe a twist-angle-dependent enhancement of the WS$_2$ A$_{1g}$ Raman mode. In contrast, other WS$_2$ and MoS$_2$ Raman modes (in particular, the MoS$_2$ A$_{1g}$ mode) do not show a clear enhancement under the same experimental conditions. We present a systematic study of this mode-selective effect using nonresonant Raman measurements that are complemented with ab-initio calculations of Raman spectra. We find that the selective enhancement of the WS$_2$ A$_{1g}$ mode exhibits a strong dependence on interlayer distance. We show that this selectivity is related to the A$_{1g}$ eigenvectors in the heterolayer: the eigenvectors are predominantly localized on one of the two layers; yet, the intensity of the MoS$_2$ mode is attenuated because the WS$_2$ layer is vibrating (albeit with much lower amplitude) out of phase, while the WS$_2$ mode is amplified because the atoms on the MoS$_2$ layer are vibrating in phase. To separate this eigenmode effect from resonant Raman enhancement, our study is extended with near-resonant Raman measurements.

Title: exaPD: A highly parallelizable workflow for multi-element phase diagram (PD) construction
Authors: Feng Zhang, Zhuo Ye, Maxim Moraru, Ying Wai Li, Weiyi Xia, Yongxin Yao, Cai-Zhuang Wang
Abstract: Phase diagrams (PDs) illustrate the relative stability of competing phases under varying conditions, serving as critical tools for synthesizing complex materials. Reliable phase diagrams rely on precise free energy calculations, which are computationally intensive. We introduce exaPD, a user-friendly workflow that enables simultaneous sampling of multiple phases across a fine mesh of temperature and composition for free energy calculations. The package employs standard molecular dynamics (MD) and Monte Carlo (MC) sampling techniques, as implemented in the LAMMPS package. Various interatomic potentials are supported, including the neural network potentials with near {\it ab initio} accuracy. A global controller, built with Parsl, manages the MD/MC jobs to achieve massive parallelization with near ideal scalability. The resulting free energies of both liquid and solid phases, including solid solutions, are integrated into CALPHAD modeling using the PYCALPHAD package for constructing the phase diagram.

Title: Structural Chirality and Natural Optical Activity across the $α$-to-$β$ Phase Transition in SiO$_2$ and AlPO$_4$ from first-principles
Authors: F. Gómez-Ortiz, A. Zabalo, A. M. Glazer, E. E. McCabe, A. H. Romero, E. Bousquet
Abstract: Natural optical activity (NOA), the ability of a material to rotate the plane of polarized light, has traditionally been associated with structural chirality. However, this relationship has often been oversimplified, leading to conceptual misunderstandings, particularly when attempts are made to directly correlate structural handedness with optical rotatory power. In reality, the relationship between chirality and NOA is more nuanced: optical activity can arise in both chiral and achiral crystal structures, and the sign of the rotation cannot necessarily be inferred from the handedness of the space group. % In this work, we conduct a first-principles investigation of natural optical activity in SiO$_2$ and AlPO$_4$ crystals, focusing on their enantiomorphic structural phase transition from high-symmetry hexagonal ($P6_422$ or $P6_222$) to low-symmetry trigonal ($P3_121$ or $P3_221$) space groups. This transition, driven by the condensation of a zone-center $\Gamma_3$ phonon mode, reverses the screw axis type given by the space group symbol while leaving the sign of the optical activity unchanged. By following the evolution of the structure and the optical response along the transition pathway, we clarify the microscopic origin of this behavior. We demonstrate that the sense of optical rotation is determined not by the nominal helicity of the screw axis given in the space group symbol, but by the atomic-scale helicity of the most polarizable atoms of the structure.

Title: Renormalization of Interacting Random Graph Models
Authors: Alessio Catanzaro, Diego Garlaschelli, Subodh P. Patil
Abstract: Random graphs offer a useful mathematical representation of a variety of real world complex networks. Exponential random graphs, for example, are particularly suited towards generating random graphs constrained to have specified statistical moments. In this investigation, we elaborate on a generalization of the former where link probabilities are conditioned on the appearance of other links, corresponding to the introduction of interactions in an effective generalized statistical mechanical formalism. When restricted to the simplest non-trivial case of pairwise interactions, one can derive a closed form renormalization group transformation for maximum coordination number two on the corresponding line graph. Higher coordination numbers do not admit exact closed form renormalization group transformations, a feature that paraphrases the usual absence of exact transformations in two or more dimensional lattice systems. We introduce disorder and study the induced renormalization group flow on its probability assignments, highlighting its formal equivalence to time reversed anisotropic drift-diffusion on the statistical manifold associated with the effective Hamiltonian. We discuss the implications of our findings, stressing the long wavelength irrelevance of certain classes of pair-wise conditioning on random graphs, and conclude with possible applications. These include modeling the scaling behavior of preferential effects on social networks, opinion dynamics, and reinforcement effects on neural networks, as well as how our findings offer a systematic framework to deal with data limitations in inference and reconstruction problems.

Title: Non-uniqueness of the steady state for run-and-tumble particles with a double-well interaction potential
Authors: Léo Touzo, Pierre Le Doussal
Abstract: We study $N$ run-and-tumble particles (RTPs) in one dimension interacting via a double-well potential $W(r)=-k_0 \, r^2/2+g \, r^4/4$, which is repulsive at short interparticle distance $r$ and attractive at large distance. At large time, the system forms a bound state where the density of particles has a finite support. We focus on the determination of the total density of particles in the stationary state $\rho_s(x)$, in the limit $N\to+\infty$. We obtain an explicit expression for $\rho_s(x)$ as a function of the ''renormalized" interaction parameter $k=k_0-3m_2$ where $m_2$ is the second moment of $\rho_s(x)$. Interestingly, this stationary solution exhibits a transition between a connected and a disconnected support for a certain value of $k$, which has no equivalent in the case of Brownian particles. Analyzing in detail the expression of the stationary density in the two cases, we find a variety of regimes characterized by different behaviors near the edges of the support and around $x=0$. Furthermore, we find that the mapping $k_0\to k$ becomes multi-valued below a certain value of the tumbling rate $\gamma$ of the RTPs for some range of values of $k_0$ near the transition, implying the existence of two stable solutions. Finally, we show that in the case of a disconnected support, it is possible to observe steady states where the density $\rho_s(x)$ is not symmetric. All our analytical predictions are in good agreement with numerical simulations already for systems of $N = 100$ particles. The non-uniqueness of the stationary state is a particular feature of this model in the presence of active (RTP) noise, which contrasts with the uniqueness of the Gibbs equilibrium for Brownian particles. We argue that these results are also relevant for a class of more realistic interactions with both an attractive and a repulsive part, but which decay at infinity.

Title: Surface-Localized Magnetic Order in RuO2 Thin Films Revealed by Low-Energy Muon Probes

Abstract: Ruthenium dioxide (RuO2) has recently emerged as a candidate altermagnet, yet its intrinsic magnetic ground state, particularly in thin films, remains debated. This study aims to clarify the nature and spatial extent of the magnetic order in RuO2 thin films grown under different conditions. Thin films of RuO2 with thicknesses of 30 nm and 33 nm are fabricated by pulsed laser deposition and sputtering onto TiO2(110) and Al2O3(1-102) substrates, respectively. Low-energy muon spin rotation/relaxation (LE-muSR) with depth-resolved sensitivity measurements is performed in transverse magnetic fields (TF) from 4 K to 290 K. The muSR data collected with a muon implantation energy of 1 keV reveal that magnetic signals originate from the near-surface region of the film (<10 nm), and the affected volume fraction is at most about 8.5%. The localized magnetic response is consistent across different substrates, growth techniques, and parameter sets, suggesting a common origin related to surface defects and dimensionality effects. The combined use of TF-muSR and the study of depth-dependent implantation with low-energy muons provides direct evidence for surface-confined, inhomogeneous static magnetic order in RuO2 thin films, helping reconcile discrepancies. These findings underscore the importance of considering reduced-dimensional contributions and motivate further investigation into the role of defects, strain, and stoichiometry on the magnetic properties of RuO2, especially at the surface.

Title: A Room-Temperature Ferrotoroidic Material Exhibiting Magnetic Semiconductor Properties with Superhigh Hole Mobility
Authors: Jianyuan Qi, Shijie Xiong, Beining Ma, Xinghai Shen
Abstract: The design and fabrication of room-temperature ferrotoroidic materials and magnetic semiconductors are recognized worldwide as a great challenge, and of both theoretical and practical importance in the field of condensed matter physics and information storage. Reported herein are ferrotoroidic crystal powder and film formed by supramolecular self-assembly based on uranyl and cyclodextrin, with the Curie temperature above room temperature. Experimental measurements and calculations demonstrate spontaneous vortex-like alignment of magnetic moments and furthermore a macroscopic long-range arrangement in the crystal, which breaks simultaneously space-inversion and time-reversal symmetries, exhibiting strong superexchange, spin-orbit coupling as well as anomalous Hall effect (AHE). The electrical measurements show the film with a superhigh carrier mobility of 3200 cm2*V-1*s-1 and a Hall resistivity as high as 0.32 mV*A-1*cm at room temperature. This work is expected to pave greatly the applied research on new-generation magnetoresistive random access memory (MRAM), especially as flexible material.

Title: Coarse-graining nonequilibrium diffusions with Markov chains
Authors: Ramón Nartallo-Kaluarachchi, Renaud Lambiotte, Alain Goriely
Abstract: We investigate nonequilibrium steady-state dynamics in both continuous- and discrete-state stochastic processes. Our analysis focuses on planar diffusion dynamics and their coarse-grained approximations by discrete-state Markov chains. Using finite-volume approximations, we derive an approximate master equation directly from the underlying diffusion and show that this discretisation preserves key features of the nonequilibrium steady-state. In particular, we show that the entropy production rate of the approximation converges as the number of discrete states goes to the limit. These results are illustrated with analytically solvable diffusions and numerical experiments on nonlinear processes, demonstrating how this approach can be used to explore the dependence of entropy production rate on model parameters. Finally, we address the problem of inferring discrete-state Markov models from continuous stochastic trajectories. We show that discrete-state models significantly underestimate the true entropy production rate. However, we also show that they can provide tests to determine if a stationary planar diffusion is out of equilibrium. This property is illustrated with both simulated data and empirical trajectories from schooling fish.

Title: Diffusion through complex confining environments: fluctuating triply periodic minimal surfaces
Authors: Jakob Mihatsch, Andreas M. Menzel
Abstract: The transport of individual entities through interconnected structures is a process of practical relevance both in biology and technology. Examples are given by diffusive dynamics of molecules in porous structures. In soft environments, this transport can be strongly influenced by fluctuations of the porous structure itself. Here, we focus on triply periodic membrane structures found both in cell organelles and in synthetic amphiphilic systems. We theoretically study the effect of a complex three-dimensional fluctuating environment on the diffusive motion of a test object, using a phase field approach. The rigid spherical test object is energetically forced to not penetrate the membrane. Generally, the pores of the membrane structure can be smaller than the diffusing object. Yet, fluctuations of the membrane can intermittently widen its pores, still allowing for the motion of the larger particles through them. Thus, the object stays trapped for a while inside one cavity formed by the membrane, before an appropriate fluctuation event widens a membrane pore in the right moment so that the object can jump into the next cavity. The process is reflected by a pronounced plateau in the time evolution of the mean squared displacement. We think that the described scenario should be directly observable, for instance, in protein diffusion through biological environments.

Title: Topological marker in three dimensions based on kernel polynomial method
Authors: Ranadeep Roy, Wei Chen
Abstract: The atomic-scale influence of disorder on the topological order can be quantified by a universal topological marker, although the practical calculation of the marker becomes numerically very costly in higher dimensions. We propose that for any symmetry class in higher dimensions, the topological marker can be calculated in a very efficient way by adopting the kernel polynomial method. Using class AII in three dimensions as an example, which is relevant to realistic topological insulators like Bi2Se3 and Bi2Te3, this method reveals the criteria for the invariance of topological order in the presence of disorder, as well as the possibility of a smooth cross over between two topological phases caused by disorder. In addition, the significantly enlarged system size in the numerical calculation implies that this method is capable of capturing the quantum criticality much closer to topological phase transitions, as demonstrated by a nonlocal topological marker.

Title: Spurious Strange Correlators in Symmetry-Protected Topological Phases
Authors: Wei-Liang Gao, Jie-Yu Zhang, Zheng-Xin Liu, Peng Ye
Abstract: Strange correlator is a powerful tool widely used in detecting symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. However, the result of strange correlator crucially relies on the adoption of the reference state. In this work, we report that an ill-chosen reference state can induce spurious long-range strange correlators in trivial SPT phases, leading to false positives in SPT diagnosis. Focusing on 1D gapped bosonic/spin systems described by matrix product states (MPS), we trace the origin of these spurious signals in trivial SPT phases to the magnitude-degeneracy of the transfer matrix. We systematically classify three distinct mechanisms responsible for such degeneracy, each substantiated by concrete examples: (1) the presence of high-dimensional irreducible representations (abbreviated as \emph{irrep}) in the eigenspace corresponding to the entanglment spectrum (entanglement space); (2) a phase mismatch in symmetry representations between the target and reference states; and (3) long-range order arising from symmetry breaking. Our findings clarify the importance of the choice of proper reference states, providing a guideline to avoid pitfalls and correctly identify SPT order using strange correlators.

Title: Confinement-induced Ultrafast Conductivity in 2D Perovskites resolved by correlative Terahertz-NIR Spectroscopy
Authors: Lion Krüger, Fabian Brütting, Michael Baumann, Moritz B. Heindl, Maximilian Spies, Anna Köhler, Alexander JC Kühne, Georg Herink
Abstract: Quantum wells made of two-dimensional organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites (2D-PKs) offer a high degree of flexibility in tailoring optoelectronic properties through carrier confinement and functional interlayers. Compared to their 3D counterparts, 2D-PKs exhibit tunable photoluminescence, excitonic binding at room temperature and enhanced structural stability. However, the dynamics of photo-induced charge carriers and their transport properties are highly intertwined due to the interplay of diverse excitation species, charge carrier cooling, transport, and radiative and non-radiative recombination. In this study, we employ optical-pump terahertz-probe spectroscopy (OPTP) to analyze the local conductivity dynamics of 2D and 3D methylammonium lead iodide (MAPI) perovskites at timescales down to picoseconds. Remarkably, we observe an intensity-dependent, 2D-specific buildup of an ultrafast, few-picosecond decay in local conductivity. By combining OPTP with transient absorption (TA) and picosecond time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL), we demonstrate the disentanglement of photoconductivity and carrier population. This allows us to attribute the 2D-specific ultrafast THz response to delayed hot-carrier cooling and subsequent exciton formation, which effectively reduces the free-carrier conductivity. This intensity-dependent, ultrafast THz response is a signature of the recently identified hot-carrier bottleneck in 3D MAPI, and this effect manifests itself in a unique form in the 2D material. These results encourage further investigations on the impact of functional organic interlayers and provide insights into designing tunable carrier responses for ultrafast devices via adapted heterostructures and confinement.

Title: Corrosion-resistant and conductive Ti-Nb-O coatings tailored for ultra-low Pt-loaded BPPs and PTLs in PEM electrolyzers
Authors: David Kolenatý, Jiří Čapek, Stanislav Haviar, Jiří Rezek, Radomír Čerstvý, Akash Kumar, Kalyani Shaji, Mariia Zhadko, Petr Zeman
Abstract: We develop highly corrosion-resistant and conductive Ti-Nb-O coatings for metallic components -- bipolar plates (BPPs) and porous transport layers (PTLs) -- in PEM water electrolyzers. Using reactive high-power impulse magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS), we deposit compact 200 nm bilayer coatings onto SS316L substrates, systematically tailoring their composition. By precisely controlling oxygen partial pressure and Nb/Ti ratio, we adjust stoichiometry and structure, directly affecting electrical resistivity and corrosion resistance. We examine interfacial contact resistance (ICR) and electrochemical parameters before and after accelerated corrosion testing. Optimized coatings exhibit resistivity on the order of 10^-4 Ohmcm and extremely low corrosion current densities (J_corr = 0.01-0.08 uA/cm^2), well below the U.S. DOE 2026 target. Most importantly, these coatings enable the ICR target after accelerated corrosion testing with a Pt overlayer as thin as 5 nm, reducing Pt loading by up to two orders of magnitude compared to conventional approaches.

Title: Impurity Self-Trapping in Lattice Bose systems
Authors: Chao Zhang
Abstract: We map out the global phase diagram of a single mobile impurity in the two-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model, spanning the bath evolution from a compressible superfluid (SF) to an incompressible Mott insulator (MI) and the full range of impurity-bath coupling. Using sign-problem-free worm-algorithm quantum Monte Carlo, we identify two distinct self-trapping mechanisms that organize the entire diagram. In the compressible SF, increasing impurity-bath coupling $|U_{\mathrm{ib}}|$ drives an interaction-driven self-trapping crossover signaled by a collapse of the \emph{impurity} winding number: a light, extended polaron evolves continuously into a heavy polaron and ultimately into a self-trapped state -- a repulsive \emph{saturated bubble} or an attractive \emph{bound cluster} -- even while the bath remains globally superfluid, demonstrating self-trapping without any bath phase transition. By contrast, at fixed $U_{\mathrm{ib}}$ and upon tuning the bath across the SF-MI transition, self-trapping becomes compressibility controlled: the vanishing bath compressibility quenches polaronic dressing and collapses the impurity-centered density response, yielding a nearly free defect near criticality and, deep in the MI, a self-trapped vacancy- or particle-type defect bound to the impurity. In the incompressible regime, this proceeds via \emph{quantized defect formation}, manifested by discrete changes in the total bath occupation. Together, our results provide a unified microscopic picture of impurity self-trapping in correlated lattice bosons, governed by winding collapse in the SF and by compressibility loss and defect quantization across the SF-MI boundary.

Title: Mobile impurity coupled to correlated lattice bosons
Authors: Chao Zhang
Abstract: We investigate how the coherence and spatial dressing of a single impurity evolve in the two-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model when the impurity couples attractively to the bath. Using large-scale, sign-problem-free worm-algorithm quantum Monte Carlo, we measure the impurity winding, bath superfluid response and compressibility, and impurity-bath density correlations. In a compressible superfluid bath ($U_{\mathrm{b}}/t=13.3$), strengthening attraction drives an interaction-controlled \emph{winding-collapse self-trapping crossover}: a mobile light polaron evolves continuously into a heavy polaron and ultimately into a bound cluster with vanishing winding, while the bath remains globally superfluid. In incompressible Mott-insulating baths, by contrast, extended density rearrangements are suppressed and the dressing cloud collapses; we compare the resulting short-range deformation patterns for both attractive and repulsive couplings. Across the SF-MI transition at fixed moderate attraction ($U_{\mathrm{ib}}/t=-8.0$), the impurity crosses over from a mobile polaron with an extended deformation cloud to a nearly free defect with minimal dressing in the Mott background; for this coupling it does not lock into a fully self-trapped defect even deep in the insulator. Together with our companion Letter [Impurity Self-Trapping in Lattice Bose systems] on repulsive couplings, these results provide a unified microscopic picture of impurity self-trapping in correlated lattice bosons, connecting interaction-driven winding collapse in the superfluid to compressibility-controlled undressing across the SF-MI transition.

Abstract: Physical neural networks typically train linear synaptic weights while treating device nonlinearities as fixed. We show the opposite - by training the synaptic nonlinearity itself, as in Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) architectures, we yield markedly higher task performance per physical resource and improved performance-parameter scaling than conventional linear weight-based networks, demonstrating ability of KAN topologies to exploit reconfigurable nonlinear physical dynamics. We experimentally realise physical KANs in silicon-on-insulator devices we term 'Synaptic Nonlinear Elements' (SYNEs), operating at room temperature, microampere currents, 2 MHz speeds and ~750 fJ per nonlinear operation, with no observed degradation over 10^13 measurements and months-long timescales. We demonstrate nonlinear function regression, classification, and prediction of Li-Ion battery dynamics from noisy real-world multi-sensor data. Physical KANs outperform equivalently-parameterised software multilayer perceptron networks across all tasks, with up to two orders of magnitude fewer parameters, and two orders of magnitude fewer devices than linear weight based physical networks. These results establish learned physical nonlinearity as a hardware-native computational primitive for compact and efficient learning systems, and SYNE devices as effective substrates for heterogenous nonlinear computing.

Title: Towards Agentic Intelligence for Materials Science

Abstract: The convergence of artificial intelligence and materials science presents a transformative opportunity, but achieving true acceleration in discovery requires moving beyond task-isolated, fine-tuned models toward agentic systems that plan, act, and learn across the full discovery loop. This survey advances a unique pipeline-centric view that spans from corpus curation and pretraining, through domain adaptation and instruction tuning, to goal-conditioned agents interfacing with simulation and experimental platforms. Unlike prior reviews, we treat the entire process as an end-to-end system to be optimized for tangible discovery outcomes rather than proxy benchmarks. This perspective allows us to trace how upstream design choices-such as data curation and training objectives-can be aligned with downstream experimental success through effective credit assignment. To bridge communities and establish a shared frame of reference, we first present an integrated lens that aligns terminology, evaluation, and workflow stages across AI and materials science. We then analyze the field through two focused lenses: From the AI perspective, the survey details LLM strengths in pattern recognition, predictive analytics, and natural language processing for literature mining, materials characterization, and property prediction; from the materials science perspective, it highlights applications in materials design, process optimization, and the acceleration of computational workflows via integration with external tools (e.g., DFT, robotic labs). Finally, we contrast passive, reactive approaches with agentic design, cataloging current contributions while motivating systems that pursue long-horizon goals with autonomy, memory, and tool use. This survey charts a practical roadmap towards autonomous, safety-aware LLM agents aimed at discovering novel and useful materials.

Title: Ultrastable 2D glasses and packings explained by local centrosymmetry
Authors: A. Zaccone
Abstract: Using the most recent numerical data by Bolton-Lum \emph{et al.} [Phys. Rev. Lett. 136, 058201 (2026)], we demonstrate that ideal ultrastable glasses in the athermal limit (or ultrastable ideal 2D disk packings) possess a remarkably high degree of local centrosymmetry. In particular, we find that the inversion-symmetry order parameter for local force transmission introduced in Milkus and Zaccone, [Phys. Rev. 93, 094204 (2016)], is as high as $F_{IS}= 0.84522$, to be compared with $F_{IS}=1$ for perfect centrosymmetric crystals free of defects, and with $F_{IS} \sim 0.3-0.5$ for standard random packings. This observation provides a clear, natural explanation for the ultra-high shear modulus of ideal packings and ideal glasses, because the high centrosymmetry prevents non-affine relaxations which decrease the shear modulus. The same mechanism explains the absence of boson peak-like soft vibrational modes. These results also confirm what was found previous work, i.e. that the bond-orientational order parameter is a very poor correlator for the vibrational and mechanical

Title: Observation of Orbit-Orbit Torques: Highly Efficient Torques on Orbital Moments Induced by Orbital Currents
Authors: Hongyu Chen, Han Yan, Xiaorong Zhou, Xiaoning Wang, Ziang Meng, Li Liu, Guojian Zhao, Zhiyuan Duan, Sixu Jiang, Jingyu Li, Xiaoyang Tan, Peixin Qin, Zhiqi Liu
Abstract: We study the current-induced torques in bilayers composed of a light 3d metal, chromium, and a rare-earth ferromagnet with finite orbital moments, terbium, utilizing second-harmonic Hall-response measurements. The dampinglike torque efficiency of chromium is found to be positive and reaches ~3.66 in this system, in sharp contrast to the negative and subtle dampinglike torque efficiency in general Cr/ferromagnet heterostructures with quenched orbital moment. We suggest that the orbital currents generated by the orbital Hall effect in Cr can be injected into Tb with negligible loss at the interface and then efficiently interact with the orbital moments. We term such an exotic effect as the orbit-orbit torque (OOT). Our work implies that orbital currents could be harnessed to manipulate the orbital magnetization of materials, which would advance the development of orbitronics.

Title: Population dynamics simulations of large deviations for three subclasses of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class
Authors: Yuta Yanagibashi, Kazumasa A. Takeuchi
Abstract: Recent theoretical studies have gradually deepened our understanding of the one-dimensional (1D) Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class even in the large deviation regime, but numerical methods for studying KPZ large deviations remain limited. Here we implement a method based on the population dynamics algorithm for studying large deviations of time-integrated local currents in the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP), which is a pragmatic model in the 1D KPZ class. Carrying out simulations for the three representative initial conditions, namely step, flat, and stationary ones, we not only confirm theoretical predictions available for the step case, but also characterize large deviations for the flat and stationary cases which have not been investigated before. We reveal in particular an unexpected robustness of the deeply negative large deviation regime with respect to different initial conditions. We attribute this robustness to the spontaneous formation of a wedge shape in interface profile. Our population dynamics approach may serve as a versatile method for studying large deviations in the KPZ class numerically and, potentially, even experimentally.

Title: Compact self-matched gyrators using edge magnetoplasmons
Authors: Aldo Tarascio, Yiqi Zhao, Rafael S. Eggli, Taras Patlatiuk, Christian Reichl, Werner Wegscheider, Stefano Bosco, Dominik M. Zumbühl
Abstract: Non-reciprocal microwave components are indispensable in quantum information processing and cryogenic measurement. Conventional implementations, however, are bulky and incompatible with on-chip scalable integration. Recent efforts to develop compact on-chip alternatives often rely on active modulation or complex circuit architectures, which introduce additional losses and degrade performance. We demonstrate the realization of compact, self-impedance-matched gyrators based on edge magnetoplasmons in a two-dimensional electron gas. Gyrators can be used as building blocks for other non-reciprocal elements such as isolators and circulators. Our devices achieve gyration from 0.2 to 2 GHz, tunable by moderate out-of plane magnetic fields below 400 mT, and sub-mm footprint, two orders of magnitude smaller than conventional ferrite-based components. Using an electrode geometry predicted to minimize reflections, we achieve insertion losses as low as 2 to 4 dB. The self-matched design framework we utilize is broadly applicable, and can be implemented in a wide variety of non-reciprocal device architectures.

Title: Probing Anharmonic and Heterogeneous Carrier Dynamics Across Sublattice Melting in a Minimal Model Superionic Conductor
Authors: Sucharita Niyogi, Takenobu Nakamura, Genki Kobayashi, Yasunobu Ando, Takeshi Kawasaki
Abstract: Despite decades of research, the microscopic origin of sublattice melting and fast ion transport in superionic conductors remains elusive. Here, we introduce a chemically neutral minimal binary model consisting of a rigid host lattice stabilized by short-range steric repulsion and a soft carrier sublattice interacting via long-range Wigner-type forces. This contrast naturally produces distinct melting temperatures and an intermediate sublattice-melting phase in which carriers become fluidlike while the host remains crystalline. Molecular-dynamics simulations identify three dynamical regimes-crystalline, sublattice-melt, and fully molten-marked by sharp changes in diffusivity, structural correlations, and dynamic heterogeneity. Near sublattice melting, carrier motion is strongly anharmonic and spatially heterogeneous, beyond mean-field hopping descriptions. By tuning the density, we demonstrate that sublattice melting can be continuously controlled, establishing a direct link between lattice softness, anharmonicity, and collective ion transport. This work provides a unified microscopic foundation for designing mechanically robust, high-performance superionic conductors operable near ambient conditions.

Title: Extracting Many-Body Quantum Resources within One-Body Reduced Density Matrix Functional Theory
Authors: Carlos L. Benavides-Riveros, Tomasz Wasak, Alessio Recati
Abstract: Quantum Fisher information (QFI) is a central concept in quantum sciences used to quantify the ultimate precision limit of parameter estimation, detect quantum phase transitions, witness genuine multipartite entanglement, or probe nonlocality. Despite this widespread range of applications, computing the QFI value of quantum many-body systems is, in general, a very demanding task. Here we combine ideas from functional theories and quantum information to develop a novel functional framework for the QFI of fermionic and bosonic ground states. By relying upon the constrained-search approach, we demonstrate that the QFI matricial values can universally be determined by the one-body reduced density matrix (1-RDM), avoiding thus the use of exponentially large wave functions. Furthermore, we show that QFI functionals can be determined from the universal 1-RDM functional by calculating its derivatives with respect to the coupling strengths, becoming thus the generating functional of the QFI. We showcase our approach with the Bose-Hubbard model and present exact analytical and numerical QFI functionals. Our results provide the first connection between the one-body reduced density matrix functional theory and the quantum Fisher information.

Title: Exactly-solvable self-trapping lattice walks. II. Lattices of arbitrary height
Authors: Jay Pantone, Alexander R. Klotz, Everett Sullivan
Abstract: A growing self-avoiding walk (GSAW) is a walk on a graph that is directed, does not visit the same vertex twice, and has a trapped endpoint. We show that the generating function enumerating GSAWs on a half-infinite strip of finite height is rational, and we give a procedure to construct a combinatorial finite state machine that allows one to compute this generating function. We then modify this procedure to compute generating functions for GSAWs under two probabilistic models. We perform Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the expected length and displacement for GSAWs on the quarter plane, half plane, full plane, and half-infinite strips of bounded height for which we cannot compute the generating function. Finally, we prove that the generating functions for Greek key tours (GSAWs on a finite grid that visit every vertex) on a half-infinite strip of fixed height are also rational, allowing us to resolve several conjectures.

Title: Quantized Hall drift in a frequency-encoded photonic Chern insulator
Authors: Alexandre Chénier, Bosco d'Aligny, Félix Pellerin, Paul-Édouard Blanchard, Tomoki Ozawa, Iacopo Carusotto, Philippe St-Jean
Abstract: The quantization of transport and its resilience to backscattering are key features for leveraging topological matter in applications that demand stringent noise mitigation, such as metrology and quantum information processing. Due to the bosonic nature of light, engineering such robust, ``one-way'' channels in synthetic photonic systems imposes the implementation of topological models with broken time-reversal symmetry; this is challenging since photons possess neither an electric charge nor a magnetic moment. Here, we propose and demonstrate a novel approach to realizing photonic Chern insulators - topological insulators with broken time-reversal symmetry - by encoding a Haldane-like model in the synthetic frequency dimension of an optical fiber loop platform. The bands' topology is assessed by reconstructing the Bloch states geometry across the Brillouin zone. We further highlight its consequences by measuring a driven-dissipative analogue of the quantized transverse Hall conductivity. Our results open new avenues for harnessing topologically protected light propagation in frequency-multiplexed photonic systems, with applications ranging from precision metrology to photonic quantum processors.

Title: HSG-12M: A Large-Scale Benchmark of Spatial Multigraphs from the Energy Spectra of Non-Hermitian Crystals
Authors: Xianquan Yan, Hakan Akgün, Kenji Kawaguchi, N. Duane Loh, Ching Hua Lee
Abstract: AI is transforming scientific research by revealing new ways to understand complex physical systems, but its impact remains constrained by the lack of large, high-quality domain-specific datasets. A rich, largely untapped resource lies in non-Hermitian quantum physics, where the energy spectra of crystals form intricate geometries on the complex plane -- termed as Hamiltonian spectral graphs. Despite their significance as fingerprints for electronic behavior, their systematic study has been intractable due to the reliance on manual extraction. To unlock this potential, we introduce Poly2Graph: a high-performance, open-source pipeline that automates the mapping of 1-D crystal Hamiltonians to spectral graphs. Using this tool, we present HSG-12M: a dataset containing 11.6 million static and 5.1 million dynamic Hamiltonian spectral graphs across 1401 characteristic-polynomial classes, distilled from 177 TB of spectral potential data. Crucially, HSG-12M is the first large-scale dataset of spatial multigraphs -- graphs embedded in a metric space where multiple geometrically distinct trajectories between two nodes are retained as separate edges. This simultaneously addresses a critical gap, as existing graph benchmarks overwhelmingly assume simple, non-spatial edges, discarding vital geometric information. Benchmarks with popular GNNs expose new challenges in learning spatial multi-edges at scale. Beyond its practical utility, we show that spectral graphs serve as universal topological fingerprints of polynomials, vectors, and matrices, forging a new algebra-to-graph link. HSG-12M lays the groundwork for data-driven scientific discovery in condensed matter physics, new opportunities in geometry-aware graph learning and beyond.

Title: Wireless Sensing of Temperature, Strain and Crack Growth in 3D-Printed Metal Structures via Magneto-Responsive Inclusions
Authors: Connor G. McMahan, Chia-Ming Chang, Raymond Nguyen, Souren Soukiazian, David A. Smith, Tobias Schaedler, David Shahan
Abstract: This study demonstrates the first realization of wireless strain, temperature and crack growth sensing within 3D-printed metallic structures using standard electromagnetic inspection hardware. This establishes a path toward need-based maintenance for parts operating in harsh environments driven by accurate, real-time damage assessments instead of relying on regularly scheduled maintenance teardowns. To this end, we encapsulate and embed magnetoelastic and thermomagnetic materials during additive manufacturing. Mechanical and thermal stimuli affect the magnetic permeability of the embedded materials, which modulates the flux through a coil placed on or near the part's surface. We demonstrate strain sensing accurate to +/-27x10-6 and temperature sensing accurate to +/-0.75 oC. We highlight these sensors' capabilities by detecting the onset of plasticity and fatigue-driven crack growth thousands of cycles before critical failure.

Title: Hyperfine-resolved optical spectroscopy of ultracold $^{87}$Rb$^{133}$Cs molecules: the $\mathrm{b}\,^3Π_0$ metastable state
Authors: Arpita Das, Albert Li Tao, Luke M. Fernley, Fritz von Gierke, Philip D. Gregory, Simon L. Cornish, Jeremy M. Hutson, Romain Vexiau, Olivier Dulieu
Abstract: Using an ultracold gas of $^{87}$Rb$^{133}$Cs molecules, we perform hyperfine-resolved spectroscopy of transitions from the vibronic ground state to the lowest rovibrational states of the electronic state $\mathrm{b}\,^3\Pi_0$, as a function of magnetic field. These transitions are spin forbidden, resulting in narrow linewidths, and feature near-diagonal Franck-Condon factors. We develop a model of the hyperfine and Zeeman structure that includes coupling between the $0^+$ and $0^-$ components of $\mathrm{b}\,^3\Pi_0$. We fit the spectra to obtain rotational and hyperfine coupling constants. We measure transition dipole moments associated with specific transitions by directly observing Rabi oscillations as a function of a resonant laser pulse duration. Using resonant $\pi$ pulses, we prepare molecules in the electronically excited state and directly measure the spontaneous emission rate.

Title: Generation of mechanical cat-like states via optomagnomechanics
Authors: Hao-Tian Li, Hong-Bin Wang, Zi-Xu Lu, Jie Li
Abstract: We propose an optomagnomechanical approach for preparing a cat-like superposition state of mechanical motion. Our protocol consists of two steps and is based on the magnomechanical system where the magnetostrictively induced displacement further couples to an optical cavity mode via radiation pressure. We first prepare a squeezed mechanical state by driving the magnomechanical system with two microwave pulses. We then switch off the microwave drives and send a weak red-detuned optical pulse to the optical cavity to weakly activate the optomechanical anti-Stokes scattering. We show that $k$ phonons can be subtracted from the prepared squeezed thermal state, conditioned on the detection of $k$ anti-Stokes photons from the cavity output field, which prepares the mechanical motion in a cat-like state. The work provides a new avenue for preparing mechanical superposition states by combining opto- and magnomechanics and may find applications in the study of macroscopic quantum states and the test of collapse theories.

Title: Multipartite entanglement characterizing topological phase transitions in holographic nodal line semimetals
Authors: Xiantong Chen, Xuanting Ji, Ya-Wen Sun
Abstract: Topological states of matter are characterized by nonlocal structures that are naturally encoded in the quantum entanglement of many-body wavefunctions. Topological semimetals are short-range entangled states at weak coupling and their entanglement structure at strong coupling remains largely unexplored. In this work, we investigate the multipartite entanglement structure of strongly coupled holographic nodal line semimetals. Building on previous studies of entanglement entropy and the holographic c-function, we focus on multipartite entanglement measures, including the conditional mutual information, multi-entropy, and the Markov gap which is based on the entanglement wedge cross section. Our results demonstrate that while these multipartite measures vanish in the long-distance limit $l \to \infty$, which confirms that the holographic nodal line semimetal remains a short-range entangled state, their large $l$ scaling behavior remains highly sensitive to the underlying topology. The large $l$ power-law decay and scaling exponents serve as robust, non-local order parameters that exhibit sharp changes at the quantum critical point. This work establishes multi-partite entanglement as a powerful probe of quantum topological phase transitions in strongly coupled topological systems.

Title: Quantum-Inspired Algorithm for Classical Spin Hamiltonians Based on Matrix Product Operators
Authors: Ryo Watanabe, Joseph Tindall, Shohei Miyakoshi, Hiroshi Ueda
Abstract: We propose a tensor-network (TN) approach for solving classical optimization problems that is inspired by spectral filtering and sampling on quantum states. We first shift and scale an Ising Hamiltonian of the cost function so that all eigenvalues become non-negative and the ground states correspond to the the largest eigenvalues, which are then amplified by power iteration. We represent the transformed Hamiltonian as a matrix product operator (MPO) and form an immense power of this object via truncated MPO-MPO contractions, embedding the resulting operator into a matrix product state for sampling in the computational basis. In contrast to the density-matrix renormalization group, our approach provides a straightforward route to systematic improvement by increasing the bond dimension and is better at avoiding local minima. We also study the performance of this power method in the context of a higher-order Ising Hamiltonian on a heavy-hexagonal lattice, making a comparison with simulated annealing. These results highlight the potential of quantum-inspired algorithms for solving optimization problems and provide a baseline for assessing and developing quantum algorithms.
