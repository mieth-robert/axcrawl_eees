The differential cross sections of scattering on nanotubes of different spatial orientation with respect to the incident particles were obtained. The eikonal approximation of quantum electrodynamics and the continuous potential approximation were used.

Title: Quantum Monte Carlo in Classical Phase Space with the Wigner-Kirkwood Commutation Function. Results for the Saturation Liquid Density of $^4$He
Authors: Phil Attard
Abstract: A Metropolis Monte Carlo algorithm is given for the case of a complex phase space weight, which applies generally in quantum statistical mechanics. Computer simulations using Lennard-Jones $^4$He near the $\lambda$-transition, including an expansion to third order of the Wigner-Kirkwood commutation function, give a saturation liquid density in agreement with measured values.

Title: Characterizing second-order topological insulators via entanglement topological invariant in two-dimensional systems
Authors: Yu-Long Zhang, Cheng-Ming Miao, Qing-Feng Sun, Jian-Jun Liu, Ying-Tao Zhang
Abstract: Higher-order topological insulators have attracted significant interest in recent years. However, identifying a universal topological invariant capable of characterizing higher-order topology remains challenging. Here, we propose a entanglement topological invariant designed to characterize secondorder topological systems. This entanglement topological invariant captures the entanglement of topological corner states under open boundary conditions by employing a bipartite entanglement entropy method. In several representative models, the entanglement topological invariant assumes a nonzero value exclusively in the presence of second-order topology, with its magnitude exactly matching the number of topologically protected corner states. Consequently, the proposed entanglement topological invariant not only provides a clear criterion for detecting higher-order topology, but also offers a quantitative measure for the related corner states. Our study establishes a universal and precise method for characterizing higher-order topological phases, opening avenues for their fundamental understanding and future investigations.

Title: Statistical Field Theory of Interacting Nambu Dynamics
Authors: Tamiaki Yoneya
Abstract: We develop a statistical field theory for classical Nambu dynamics by employing partially the method of quantum field theory. One of unsolved problems in Nambu dynamics has been to extend it to interacting systems without violating a generalized canonical structure associated with the presence of multiple Hamiltonians, which together govern the dynamics of time evolution with an equal footing. In the present paper, we propose to include interactions from the standpoint of classical statistical dynamics by formulating it as a field theory on Nambu's generalized phase space in an operator formalism. We first construct a general framework for such a field theory and its probabilistic interpretation. Then, on the basis of this new framework, we give a simple model of self-interaction in a many-body Nambu system treated as a closed dynamical system satisfying the H-theorem. It is shown that a generalized micro-canonical ensemble and a generalized canonical ensemble characterized by many temperatures are reached dynamically as equilibrium states, starting with certain classes of initial non-equilibrium states via continuous Markov processes. Compared with the usual classical statistical mechanics on the basis of standard Hamiltonian dynamics, some important new features associated with Nambu dynamics will emerge, with respect to the symmetries underlying dynamics of the non-equilibrium as well as the equilibrium states and also to some conceptual properties, such as a formulation of a generalized KMS-like condition characterizing the generalized canonical equilibrium states and a `relative' nature of the temperatures.

Title: Planckian Bounds via Spectral Moments of Optical Conductivity
Authors: Debanjan Chowdhury
Abstract: The observation of Planckian scattering, often inferred from Drude fits in strongly correlated metals, raises the question of how to extract an intrinsic timescale from measurable quantities in a model-independent way. We address this by focusing on a ratio (${\cal{B}}$) of spectral moments of the dissipative part of the optical conductivity and prove a rigorous upper bound on ${\cal{B}}$ in terms of the Planckian rate. The bound emerges from the analytic structure of thermally weighted response functions of the current operator. Crucially, the bounded quantity is directly accessible via optical spectroscopy and computable from imaginary-time correlators in quantum Monte Carlo simulations, without any need for analytic continuation. We evaluate ${\cal{B}}$ for simplified examples of both Drude and non-Drude forms of the optical conductivity with a single scattering rate in various asymptotic regimes, and find that ${\cal{B}}$ lies far below the saturation value. These findings demonstrate that Planckian bounds can arise from fundamental constraints on equilibrium dynamics, pointing toward a possibly universal structure governing transport in correlated quantum matter.

Title: Measuring the Hall Viscosity of the Laughlin State on Noisy Quantum Computers
Authors: Ammar Kirmani, Andrew A. Allocca, Jian-Xin Zhu, Armin Rahmani, Sriram Ganeshan, Pouyan Ghaemi
Abstract: Hall viscosity is a quantized nondissipative stress response of a fractional quantum Hall (FQH) fluid to adiabatic geometric deformations. Despite strong theoretical interest, its experimental observation in the FQH state has remained elusive, making it a promising target for realization on current NISQ devices. In this work, we employ a quasi-one-dimensional model of an FQH state coupled to a background metric to probe the geometric response under a metric quench. We design and implement a quantum-circuit protocol that realizes a Hilbert-space-truncated version of the model and extracts the Hall viscosity from the geometric response encoded in the wavefunction dynamics of the device. While the truncation prevents us from accessing the fully quantized value of Hall viscosity, the hardware data nevertheless show excellent agreement with analytical and numerical predictions within this restricted regime.

Title: Fluctuation-induced giant magnetoresistance in charge-neutral graphene
Authors: A. Levchenko, E. Kirkinis, A. V. Andreev
Abstract: The Johnson-Nyquist noise associated with the intrinsic conductivity of the electron liquid, induces fluctuations of the electron density in charge-neutral graphene devices. In the presence of external electric and magnetic fields, the fluctuations of charge density and electric current induce a fluctuating hydrodynamic flow. We show that the resulting advection of charge produces a fluctuation contribution to the macroscopic conductivity of the system, $\sigma_{\mathrm{fl}}$, and develop a quantitative theory of $\sigma_{\mathrm{fl}}$. At zero magnetic field, $\sigma_{\mathrm{fl}}$ diverges logarithmically with the system size and becomes rapidly suppressed at relatively small fields. This results in giant magnetoresistance of the system.

Title: Low-temperature dissipative conductivity of superconductors with paramagnetic impurities
Authors: Shiang-Bin Chiu, Anton Andreev, Alexander Burin, Boris Z. Spivak
Abstract: In s-wave superconductors with a small concentration of magnetic impurities, the only electronic excitations that remain available at low temperatures are the excitations of the system of localized spins. We discuss a new mechanism of interaction between electromagnetic waves and the localized spins in disordered superconductors. A supercurrent induces randomly distributed spin density of the itinerant electrons, which couples to the impurity spins by exchange interaction. Acceleration of the Cooper pair condensate by the external AC electric field of frequency $\omega$ creates a strong, time-dependent exchange field acting on the localized spins, which is inversely proportional to $\omega$. As a result, the low-frequency dissipative part of the conductivity saturates to a nonzero value. We use the fluctuation-dissipation theorem to evaluate the spectrum of equilibrium current fluctuations associated with the fluctuation in the spin subsystem. We also predict that in the presence of a DC magnetic field parallel to the superconducting film, the system of spins exhibits a large positive magnetoconductance.

Title: Mechanism for Nodal Topological Superconductivity on PtBi$_2$ Surface
Authors: Kristian Mæland, Giorgio Sangiovanni, Björn Trauzettel
Abstract: Experiments show that the Weyl semimetal PtBi$_2$ hosts unconventional superconductivity in its topological surface states. Hence, the material is a candidate for intrinsic topological superconductivity. Measurements indicate nodal gaps in the center of the Fermi arcs. We derive that anisotropic electron-phonon coupling on Weyl semimetal surfaces, combined with statically screened Coulomb repulsion, is a microscopic mechanism for this nodal pairing. The dominant solution of the linearized gap equation shows nodal gaps when the surface state bandwidth is comparable to the maximum phonon energy, as is the case in PtBi$_2$. We further predict that if the screening of Coulomb interaction on the surface is enhanced by Coulomb engineering, the superconducting gap becomes nodeless, and the critical temperature increases.

Title: Universal relaxation speedup in open quantum systems through transient conditional and unconditional resetting
Authors: Parvinder Solanki, Igor Lesanovsky, Gabriele Perfetto
Abstract: Speeding up the relaxation dynamics of many-body quantum systems is important in a variety of contexts, including quantum computation and state preparation. We demonstrate that such acceleration can be universally achieved via transient stochastic resetting. This means that during an initial time interval of finite duration, the dynamics is interrupted by resets that take the system to a designated state at randomly selected times. We illustrate this idea for few-body open systems and also for a challenging many-body case, where a first-order phase transition leads to a divergence of relaxation time. In all scenarios, a significant and sometimes even exponential acceleration in reaching the stationary state is observed, similar to the so-called Mpemba effect. The universal nature of this speedup lies in the fact that the design of the resetting protocol only requires knowledge of a few macroscopic properties of the target state, such as the order parameter of the phase transition, while it does not necessitate any fine-tuned manipulation of the initial state.

Title: Switchable half-quantum flux states in a ring of the kagome superconductor CsV$_3$Sb$_5$
Authors: Shuo Wang, Ilaria Maccari, Xilin Feng, Ze-Nan Wu, Jia-Peng Peng, Kam Tuen Law, Y. X. Zhao, Andras Szabo, Andreas Schnyder, Ning Kang, Xiao-Song Wu, Jingchao Liu, Xuewen Fu, Mark H. Fischer, Manfred Sigrist, Dapeng Yu, Ben-Chuan Lin
Abstract: Magnetic flux quantization in units of $\Phi_0 = h/2e$ is a defining feature of superconductivity, rooted in the charge-2e nature of Cooper pairs. In a ring geometry, the flux quantization leads to oscillations in the critical temperature with magnetic flux, known as the Little-Parks effect. While the maximal critical temperature is conventionally at zero flux, departures from this rule, for instance shifts by a half-quantum flux $\Phi_0/2$, clearly signal unconventional superconducting states and require sign-changing order parameters. Historically, such $\pi$-phase shifts in Little-Parks oscillations have been found in tricrystals or engineered ring structures that intentionally incorporate a $\pi$-phase shift. Here we report the discovery of switchable half-quantum flux states in rings made from single crystals of the kagome superconductor CsV$_3$Sb$_5$. We observe Little-Parks oscillations with a $\pi$-phase shift at zero bias current, which can be reversibly tuned to conventional Little-Parks oscillations upon applying a bias current. Between the $\pi$-phase and 0-phase regimes, $h/4e$ periodic oscillations appear. Our observations suggest unconventional pairing, potentially in the form of a multicomponent order parameter in the kagome superconductor CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, and reveal an electrically tunable landscape of competing superconducting condensates and fractional flux states.

Title: Spin-phonon interactions revisited: Far-infrared emission, Raman scattering, and high-resolution x-ray diffraction at the Néel temperature in LaFeO3
Authors: Néstor E. Massa, Javier Gainza, Aurélien Canizares, Leire del Campo, José Antonio Alonso
Abstract: We report on the structural evolution, spin phonon interactions, and magnetoelastic effects in bulk LaFeO3 perovskite across its antiferromagnetic transition. We found that while the lattice constants exhibit slight deviations at the Neel temperature(TN), due to spin phonon interactions, individual interatomic bonds display distinct behavior. The octahedral B site basal plane, involving oxygen ion pairs that mediate superexchange interactions, displays bond contraction (or elongation) assimilable to the observed in x ray diffraction for negative thermal expansion. These bond deviations reach a singular point near TN, where a sharp change in bond length is observed. A similar abrupt change is also detected in the nearest neighbor La O2 basal plane distances, which we interpret as arising from ion size differences within the 3d 2p hybridized states associated with the superexchange mechanism. High-resolution SXRD measurements of the c-axis Fe3+ O1 and La3+ O1 apex distances reveal a distinct inflection at the Neel temperature. This behavior supports the role of lattice distortions and crystal field modifications in the emergence of non collinear weak ferromagnetism in RFeO3 (R = rare earth) perovskites. Furthermore, our SXRD patterns show an increase in diffraction line intensities peaking at TN, suggesting a straightforward indicator for spin-phonon interactions that also resolves into lattice metastability deduced by nonlinear thermal expansion in the paramagnetic phase. Preliminary results across the full RFeO3 (R = rare earth) series indicate a shared structural framework among all members, potentially offering insights into previously inconclusive structural interpretations in oxides with common octahedral sublattices.

Title: The magnetic structure of polar $G$-type charge and orbital ordered Hg-quadruple manganite perovskites
Authors: Ben R. M. Tragheim, Fabio Orlandi, En-Pei Liu, Wei-Tin Chen, Mark S. Senn
Abstract: The magnetic structure of the novel Hg$_{0.7}$Na$_{0.3}$Mn$_3$Mn$_4$O$_{12}$, a quadruple manganite perovskite that exhibits a unique $G$-type charge and orbital ordered state distinct to other $A^{2+}$Mn$_3$Mn$_4$O$_{12}$ equivalents ($A$ $=$ Ca, Sr, Cd, Pb), has been solved using powder neutron diffraction and symmetry-motivated analysis. A $G$-type-like antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering of Mn on the $A'$ sites and a `up--up--down--down' AFM moment configuration of Mn spins on the $B$ sites is found to occur. The mechanism for the onset and stabilization of $B$ site `up--up--down--down' AFM order is explored in terms of coupling between structural and magnetic distortions. The results presented here provide evidence of the exotic charge, orbital, electronic and magnetic orderings that quadruple manganite perovskites demonstrate, and further highlighting the distinct chemistry that Hg$^{2+}$ plays in stabilizing novel states compared to other divalent $A$-site cation equivalents.

Title: Direct Epitaxial Growth and Deterministic Device Integration of high-quality Telecom O-Band InGaAs Quantum Dots on Silicon Substrate
Authors: Imad Limame, Peter Ludewig, Aris Koulas-Simos, Chirag C. Palekar, Jan Donges, Ching-Wen Shih, Kartik Gaur, Sarthak Tripathi, Sven Rodt, Wolfgang Stolz, Kerstin Volz, Stephan Reitzenstein
Abstract: Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are key building blocks for photonic quantum technologies, enabling practical sources of non-classical light. A central challenge for scalable integration is the direct epitaxial growth of high-quality emitters on industry-compatible silicon platforms. Furthermore, for long-distance fiber-based quantum communication, emission in the telecom O- or C-band is essential. Here, we demonstrate the direct growth of high-quality InGaAs/GaAs QDs emitting in the telecom O-band using a strain-reducing layer approach on silicon. Deterministic integration of individual QDs into circular Bragg grating resonators is achieved via in-situ electron-beam lithography. The resulting devices exhibit strong out-coupling enhancement, with photon extraction efficiencies up to $(40 \pm 2)\%$, in excellent agreement with numerical simulations. These results highlight the high material quality of both the epitaxial platform and the photonic nanostructure, as well as the precise lateral positioning of the emitter within 20~nm of the resonator center. At cryogenic temperature (4~K) and low excitation power ($0.027\times P_\text{sat}$), the devices show excellent single-photon purity, exceeding 99\%. Operation at elevated temperatures of 40~K and 77~K, compatible with compact Stirling cryo-coolers and liquid-nitrogen cooling, reveals robust performance, with single-photon purity maintained at $(88.4 \pm 0.6)\%$ at 77~K. These results demonstrate a practical and scalable route toward silicon-based quantum light sources and provide a promising path for cost-effective fabrication and seamless integration of quantum photonics with classical electronics, representing an important step toward large-scale, chip-based quantum information systems.

Title: Gutzwiller approximation for paramagnetic ionic Hubbard model: Analytic expression for band - Mott insulator transition
Authors: Marcin M. Wysokiński
Abstract: The ionic Hubbard model is a paradigmatic setup for studying the competition between band and Mott insulating behavior. Within the variationally exact in infinite dimensions Gutzwiller approximation, we derive a compact analytic expression for the phase boundary between Mott and band insulator. While the method reproduces the expected band-Mott insulator phenomenology, it does not capture the correlated metallic state at finite staggered potential found for example in dynamical mean-field theory. This absence highlights that the metallic phase originates from incoherent Hubbard-band physics rather than Fermi-liquid behavior well captured by Gutzwiller approximation. Our formulation establishes a concise variational framework to ionic Hubbard model, with natural extensions to nonequilibrium setups and spin-exchange dynamics.

By integrating cavity-enhanced or surface-modified vacuum quantum fluctuations with low-dimensional materials, a new paradigm-vacuumronics-emerges, enabling unprecedented control over both material properties and photonic responses at the micro- and nanoscale. This synergy opens novel pathways for engineering quantum light-matter interactions, advancing applications in quantum photonics, nanoscale optoelectronics, and quantum material design.

Title: Two-dimensional helical superconductivity and gapless superconducting edge modes in the 1T$^\prime$-WS$_2$/2H-WS$_2$ heterophase bilayer
Authors: Xuance Jiang, Jennifer Cano, Yuan Ping, Yafis Barlas, Deyu Lu
Abstract: We propose a material platform comprised of transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) heterostructures to realize the two-dimensional (2D) helical superconductivity with an intrinsic gap. By van der Waals stacking a 2D superconductor (1T$^\prime$-WS$_2$ with inversion symmetry) on top of a 2D topological insulator (2H-WS$_2$ with mirror symmetry), the resulting TMDC bilayer exhibits Rashba superconductivity. Under an external in-plane magnetic field, the system can host finite-momentum Cooper pairing, evidenced by the divergence in the particle-particle susceptibility of a $k\cdot p$ Hamiltonian fitted to the \textit{ab initio} theory band structure. The resulting 2D helical superconducting phase can induce superconductivity in the edge states with its spatially varying order parameter. By varying the strength of the in-plane magnetic field, we demonstrate that the helical edge state can undergo a phase transition to a one-dimensional gapless phase with narrow Fermi segments corresponding to zero-energy Bogoliubov quasi-particles. The controllable one-dimensional gapless phase serves as a clear experimental fingerprint of 2D helical superconductivity. The proposed 2D TMDC heterostructure is promising for intrinsic nonreciprocal superconducting transport and the development of Majorana-based quantum devices.

Title: Large Anomalous Hall Effect in Topologically Trivial Double-$Q$ Magnets
Authors: Satoru Ohgata, Satoru Hayami
Abstract: Multi-$Q$ magnets consist of superposed spin density waves with distinct magnetic modulation vectors, enabling a wide range of magnetic orders depending on their combination. Among them, topologically nontrivial spin textures, such as a magnetic skyrmion, has been extensively studied owing to the emergence of topological Hall effects induced by real-space scalar spin chirality. Contrary to this expectation, we theoretically investigate another route to enhancing the Hall response under a topologically \textit{trivial} double-$Q$ spin textures. Despite the cancellation of the scalar spin chirality, the double-$Q$ magnetism exhibits a pronounced Hall response with a nonmonotonic dependence on the uniform magnetization, which is in stark contrast to a ferromagnetic state and a single-$Q$ spiral state. Analyzing the multi-orbital Kondo lattice model, we show that orbital hybridization induced by the double-$Q$ superstructure enhances the Berry curvature in $\mathbf{k}$-space, leading to a large anomalous Hall effect. This mechanism accounts for the observed giant anomalous Hall effect in GdRu$_2$Si$_2$ and GdRu$_2$Ge$_2$, thereby highlighting topologically trivial double-$Q$ spin textures as promising spintronic materials.

Title: Switching of topological phase transition from semiconductor to ideal Weyl states in Cu$_2$SnSe$_3$ family of materials
Authors: Huan Li
Abstract: The exploration of topological phase transition (TPT) mechanisms constitutes a central theme in quantum materials research. Conventionally, transitions between Weyl semimetals (WSMs) and other topological states rely on the breaking of time-reversal symmetry (TRS) or precise manipulation of lattice symmetry, thus constraints the available control strategies and restrict the scope of viable material systems. In this work, we propose a novel mechanism for TPT that operates without TRS breaking or lattice symmetry modification: a class of semiconductors can be directly transformed into an ideal WSM via bandgap closure. This transition is driven by chemical doping, which simultaneously modulates the band gap and enhances spin-orbit coupling (SOC), leading to band inversion between the valence and conduction bands and thereby triggering the TPT. Using first-principles calculations, we demonstrate the feasibility of this mechanism in the Cu$_2$SnSe$_3$ family of materials, where two pairs of Weyl points emerge with energies extremely close to the Fermi level. The bulk Fermi surface becomes nearly point-like, while the surface Fermi surface consists exclusively of Fermi arcs. This symmetry-independent mechanism bypasses the constraints of conventional symmetry-based engineering, and also offers an ideal platform for probing the anomalous transport properties of WSMs.

Title: Bose one-component plasma in 2D: a Monte Carlo study
Authors: Massimo Boninsegni
Abstract: The low-temperature properties of a 2D Bose fluid of charged particles interacting through a 1/r potential, moving in the presence of a uniform neutralizing background, is studied by Quantum Monte Carlo simulations. We make use of the Modified Periodic Coulomb potential formalism to account for the long-range character of the interaction, and explore a range of density corresponding to average interparticle separation $1 \le r_s\le 80$. We report numerical results based on simulations of system comprising up to 2304 particles. We find a superfluid ground state for $r_s$ as large as 68, i.e., slightly above the most recent numerical estimate of the Wigner crystallization threshold, which we estimate at $r_W \approx 70$. Furthermore, no thermally re-entrant crystalline phase nor any evidence of metastable bubbles is observed near the transition, in contrast with a previous theoretical study in which quantum statistics was neglected. The computed superfluid transition temperature depends remarkably weakly on density.

Title: Evaluating covalency using RIXS spectral weights: Silver fluorides vs. cuprates
Authors: Ilya Degtev, Daniel Jezierski, Adrián Gómez Pueyo, Luciana Di Gaspare, Monica De Seta, Paolo Barone, Giacomo Ghiringhelli, Pieter Glatzel, Zoran Mazej, Wojciech Grochala, Marco Moretti Sala, José Lorenzana
Abstract: We investigate the electronic structure of AgF2, AgFBF4, AgF and Ag2O using X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) at the Ag L3 edge. XAS results were compared with density functional theory computations of the spectra, allowing an identification of main features and an assessment of the theoretical approximations. Our RIXS measurements reveal that AgF2 exhibits charge transfer excitations and dd excitations, analogous to those observed in La2CuO4. We propose to use the ratio of dd to CT spectral weight as a measure of the covalence of the compounds and provide explicit equations for the weights as a function of the scattering geometry for crystals and powders. The measurements at the metal site L3 edge and previous measurements at the ligand K edge reveal a striking similarity between the fluorides and cuprates materials, with fluorides somewhat more covalent than cuprates. These findings support the hypothesis that silver fluorides are an excellent platform to mimic the physics of cuprates, providing a promising avenue for exploring high-Tc superconductivity and exotic magnetism in quasi-two-dimensional (AgF2) and quasi-one-dimensional (AgFBF4) materials.

Title: Deterministic Electrical Control of Single Magnetic Bubbles in Nanostructured Cells
Authors: Jialiang Jiang, Yaodong Wu, Lingyao Kong, Yongsen Zhang, Sheng Qiu, Huanhuan Zhang, Yihao Wang, Junbo Li, Yimin Xiong, Shouguo Wang, Mingliang Tian, Haifeng Du, Jin Tang
Abstract: Localized particle-like spin textures have been found to exhibit emergent electromagnetic properties, which hold promise for the development of intriguing spintronic devices. Among these textures, magnetic bubbles represent localized spin configurations that could serve as data bits. However, the precise methods for their electrical manipulation remain uncertain. Here, we demonstrate the deterministic electrical manipulations and detections of single magnetic bubbles in kagome-latticed Fe3Sn2 magnetic nanostructured cells. The current-induced dynamics of magnetic bubbles were explored using nanosecond pulsed currents. We show single pulsed currents with low and high densities can be applied for the creation and deletion of a single bubble, respectively. The mutual writing-deleting operations on single bubbles are attributed to the thermal heating and non-thermal spin-transfer torque effects in combination with micromagnetic simulations. We also realized the in-situ detection of a single bubble using the anisotropic magnetoresistance effect through a standard four-probe method. Our results could propel the development of bubble-based spintronic devices.

Title: Stable skyrmion bundles at room temperature and zero magnetic field in a chiral magnet
Authors: Yongsen Zhang, Jin Tang, Yaodong Wu, Meng Shi, Xitong Xu, Shouguo Wang, Mingliang Tian, Haifeng Du
Abstract: Topological spin textures are characterized by topological magnetic charges, Q, which govern their electromagnetic properties. Recent studies have achieved skyrmion bundles with arbitrary integer values of Q, opening possibilities for exploring topological spintronics based on Q. However, the realization of stable skyrmion bundles in chiral magnets at room temperature and zero magnetic field - the prerequisite for realistic device applications - has remained elusive. Here, through the combination of pulsed currents and reversed magnetic fields, we experimentally achieve skyrmion bundles with different integer Q values - reaching a maximum of 24 at above room temperature and zero magnetic field - in the chiral magnet Co8Zn10Mn2. We demonstrate the field-driven annihilation of high-Q bundles and present a phase diagram as a function of temperature and field. Our experimental findings are consistently corroborated by micromagnetic simulations, which reveal the nature of the skyrmion bundle as that of skyrmion tubes encircled by a fractional Hopfion.

Title: Defects Engineering of ZrTe5 for Stabilizing Ideal Topological States
Authors: Chia-Hsiu Hsu, Zezhi Wang, Sen Shao, Yoshinori Okada, Feng-Chuan Chuang, Dong Xing, Ilya Belopolski, Cheng-Long Zhang, Guoqing Chang
Abstract: ZrTe5 is a highly tunable, high-mobility topological material that hosts a rich variety of quantum phenomena, making it a promising platform for next-generation quantum technologies. Despite intensive research efforts, experimental studies have reported inconsistent and sometimes conflicting results for its electronic and topological states, largely due to variations in sample quality. Here, through systematic frst-principles investigations of all intrinsic point defects, we identify a practical route to achieving stable and ideal topological characteristics in ZrTe5. We show that the competition between two dominant charged defects, donor-like Zr interstitials and acceptor-like Te vacancies, governs the Fermi-level position. Furthermore, variations in defect density determine the topological phases of the samples. We theoretically propose and experimentally confrm that increasing the Te/Zr ratio during crystal growth effectively suppresses intrinsic defects and stabilizes ZrTe5 in a nearly ideal weak topological insulator state. These fndings provide clear guidance for defect control and sample optimization, paving the way toward robust and reproducible realization of topological quantum states in ZrTe5 for future quantum applications.

Title: Investigating the origin of topological-Hall-like resistivity in Zn-doped Mn2Sb ferrimagnet
Authors: BoCheng Yu, JiaLiang Jiang, Jing Meng, XiaoYan Zhu, Jie Ma, HaiFeng Du, QingFeng Zhan, Jin Tang, Yang Xu, Tian Shang
Abstract: Skyrmions and other chiral spin textures have been extensively studied as potential building blocks for novel spintronic devices. Hall-resistivity anomalies that deviate from magnetization scaling, known as the topological Hall effect, have been widely employed as evidence for the presence of chiral spin textures in magnetic materials. However, recent studies on magnetic thin films have revealed a drawback of this approach, as the presumed topological Hall contribution may in fact originate from trivial mechanisms. Here, we investigate the magnetic and transport properties of a Zn-doped Mn2Sb ferrimagnet, whose related compounds have previously been suggested to exhibit a topological Hall effect arising from chiral spin textures. Hall-resistivity anomalies are also observed in our sample, yet they show little correlation with the magnetic or metamagnetic transitions and are therefore clearly distinct from those in magnetic compounds hosting chiral spin textures. Most importantly, additional Lorentz transmission electron microscopy measurements rule out the existence of chiral spin textures in this ferrimagnet. Therefore, instead of a nontrivial origin, we attribute the Hall-resistivity anomalies to the combined effect of multiple anomalous Hall channels resulting from sample inhomogeneity. Our work shows that the difficulties of identifying chiral spin textures through transport measurements also apply to bulk systems, prompting some existing results to be revisited.

Title: Anomalous Hall effect and rich magnetic phase diagram of Mn$_{100-x}$Rh$_{x}$ epitaxial films
Authors: Cong Wang, Zheng Li, Jing Meng, Hui Zhang, Haoyu Lin, Jiyuan Li, Kun Zheng, Yang Xu, Tian Shang, Qingfeng Zhan
Abstract: A series of Mn$_{100-x}$Rh$_x$ ($20 \le x \le 50$) thin films were epitaxially grown on the MgO substrate using magnetron sputtering technique, and were systematically investigated by magnetization, longitudinal electrical resistivity, and transverse Hall resistivity. After optimizing the growth conditions, phase-pure Mn$_{100-x}$Rh$_x$ films with a cubic CsCl-type structure were obtained, and their magnetic phase diagram was built. The manipulation of Rh content leads to a rich magnetic phase diagram, where three different regimes can be identified: for $x < 40$, Mn$_{100-x}$Rh$_x$ films undergo a ferromagnetic (FM) transition below $T_\mathrm{C} \approx$ 330-350 K; for $40 \le x \le 45$, in addition to the FM transition at $T_\mathrm{C} \approx$ 200 K, Mn$_{100-x}$Rh$_x$ films undergo a FM-to-antiferromagnetic (AFM) transition at $T_\mathrm{N} \approx$ 120 K; finally for $x > 45$, only one AFM transition at $T_\mathrm{N} \approx$ 150 K can be tracked. All the Mn$_{100-x}$Rh$_x$ films exhibit distinct anomalous Hall effect in their magnetically ordered state, which is most likely due to the intrinsic Berry-curvature mechanism. In addition, all the anomalous Hall transport properties, including the resistivity, conductivity, and angle exhibit a strong correlation with the magnetic properties of Mn$_{100-x}$Rh$_x$ films, which become most evident for $x$ = 35. Our systematic investigations suggest a strong correlation between magnetic properties and electronic band topology in Mn$_{100-x}$Rh$_x$ films, highlighting their great potential for AFM spintronics.

Title: Geometric Control of Pairing: Universal Scaling of Superconductivity at KTaO3 Interfaces
Authors: Xueshan Cao, Meng Zhang, Yishuai Wang, Ming Qin, Yi Zhou, Yanwu Xie
Abstract: The superconducting transition temperature Tc at KTaO3-based oxide interfaces exhibits a dramatic dependence on crystallographic orientation, yet a unifying principle has remained elusive. Here, we discover a universal linear scaling between Tc and a single geometric parameter - the angle {\theta} between the (hkl) plane and the (100) plane - across ten different orientations of LaAlO3/KTaO3 interfaces. With the exception of (100), all orientations exhibit two dimensional superconductivity, with transition temperatures Tc ranging from ~ 0.12 K to 1.9 K. This linear {\theta}-Tc scaling is robust against variations in growth temperature, device geometry, and transport configuration. By establishing geometric orientation as a direct control knob for pairing strength, our results impose a critical benchmark for microscopic theories of superconductivity in KTaO3-based systems.

Title: Development of a Ferromagnetic Resonance Measurement System Using NanoVNA
Authors: Reo Fukunaga, Ryunosuke Takahashi, Tetsuro Ueno, Hiroki Shoji, Yoshihiko Togawa, Hiroki Wadati
Abstract: Ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) is a fundamental technique for probing magnetization dynamics in spintronic and magnetic materials. However, conventional FMR measurements rely on broadband vector network analyzers (VNAs), whose high cost limits accessibility for small laboratories and educational environments. To overcome this barrier, we have developed a compact and low-cost FMR measurement platform - the NanoVNA-FMR system-based on a commercially available NanoVNA. The setup integrates an electromagnet and a coplanar waveguide (CPW) and is fully automated using Python scripts. This enables synchronized magnetic-field sweeping, S-parameter acquisition, and real-time visualization. The system successfully captures clear FMR spectra that exhibit systematic shifts in resonance frequency with increasing magnetic field. The results are in excellent agreement with those obtained using a conventional VNA-based FMR system, confirming the quantitative reliability of the NanoVNA approach. Additionally, a 3D-printed sample holder further reduces overall system cost. These results demonstrate that the NanoVNA-FMR system provides a practical, accurate, and accessible alternative for quantitative magnetic characterization and educational applications.

Title: Infusing Experimental Reality into Complex Many-Body Hamiltonians: The Observable-Constrained Variational Framework (OCVF)

Abstract: Deep learning potentials for complex many-body systems often face challenges of insufficient accuracy and a lack of physical realism. This paper proposes an "Observable-Constrained Variational Framework" (OCVF), a general top-down correction paradigm designed to infuse physical realism into theoretical "skeleton" models (H_o) by imposing constraints from macroscopic experimental observables (\mathfrak{O}_{\text{exp},s}). We theoretically derive OCVF as a numerically tractable extension of the "Constrained-Ensemble Variational Method" (CEVM), wherein a neural network (\Delta H_\theta) learns the correction functional required to match the experimental data. We apply OCVF to BaTiO3 (BTO) to validate the framework: a neural network potential trained on DFT data serves as H_o, and experimental PDF data at various temperatures are used as constraints (\mathfrak{O}{\text{exp},s}). The final model, H_o + \Delta H_\theta, successfully predicts the complete phase transition sequence accurately (s', s \neq s'). Compared to the prior model, the accuracy of the Cubic-Tetragonal (C-T) phase transition temperature is improved by 95.8\% , and the Orthorhombic-Rhombohedral (O-R) T_c accuracy is improved by 36.1\%. Furthermore, the lattice structure accuracy in the Rhombohedral (R) phase is improved by 55.6\%, validating the efficacy of the OCVF framework in calibrating theoretical models via observational constraints.

Title: Fresnel Magnetic Imaging of Ultrasmall Skyrmion Lattices
Authors: Yongsen Zhang, Wei Liu, Meng Shi, Yaodong Wu, Jialiang Jiang, Sheng Qiu, Huanhuan Zhang, Hui Han, Mingliang Tian, Haifeng Du, Shouguo Wang, Jin Tang
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions with ultrasmall nanometric dimensions hold significant promise for next-generation high-density spintronic devices. Direct real-space imaging of these topological spin textures is critical for elucidating their emergent properties at the nanoscale. Here, we present Lorentz transmission electron microscopy studies of nanometric skyrmion lattices in B20-structured Mn0.5Fe0.5Ge crystals using Fresnel mode. According to conventional chiral discrimination methods relying on static bright-dark contrast, we demonstrate an abnormal periodic chiral-reversal phenomenon retrieved through the transport of intensity equation analysis of defocus-dependent Fresnel images. Through systematic off-axis electron holography experiments and numerical simulations, we attribute these chiral misinterpretations to the sinusoidal modulation mechanism of the contrast transfer functionthat correlates with both defocus values and skyrmion dimensions. Our findings establish quantitative limitations of conventional Fresnel contrast analysis for ultrasmall skyrmions while revealing fundamental insights into defocus-mediated phase-to-intensity conversion processes in nanoscale magnetic imaging.

Title: Spin Orientation Driven Polarization in Collinear Magnets
Authors: Yixun Zhang, Longju Yu, Yizhou Tong, Ying Sun, Xu Li, Hong Jian Zhao, Yanming Ma
Abstract: In a collinear magnet, the predominant magnetic moments are collectively aligned along a specific spatial orientation, and this alignment may yield intriguing phenomena such as spin orientation driven polarization. It is well known that spin orientation driven polarization is a relativistic effect that widely occurs in various type-II multiferroics. However, a universal theory that describes such a phenomenon and directs the corresponding materials discovery is lacking. Here, we revisit the magnetic structures of collinear magnets and explore the spin-orientation-dependent phenomena therein. Based on symmetry principles, we analyze the spin point groups (SPGs) that are associated with collinear magnets in the non-relativistic regime, demonstrate how relativistic spin-orbit interaction reduces each SPG to various magnetic point groups that are associated with different magnetic alignments, and classify the SPGs with respect to spin orientation driven polarization. We employ our theory to elucidate the mechanisms of spin orientation driven polarization in a variety of type-II multiferroics. Combined with first-principles simulations, we further show that polarization may be driven in nonpolar collinear antiferromagnets (e.g., CuFeS$_2$) by reorienting their magnetic alignments. Our theory provides guidelines for designing and discovering materials with spin orientation driven polarization, which will benefit the development of spintronics based on type-II multiferroics and related materials.

Title: Cascade of topological phase transitions and revival of topological zero modes in imperfect double helical liquids
Authors: Anna Ohorodnyk, Chen-Hsuan Hsu
Abstract: Two parallel helical edge channels hosting interacting electrons, when proximitized by local and nonlocal pairings, can host time-reversal-invariant pairs of topological zero modes at the system corners. Here we show that realistic imperfections substantially enrich the physics of such proximitized double helical liquids. Specifically, we analyze this platform and its fractional counterparts in the presence of pairing and interaction asymmetries between the two channels, as well as random spin-flip terms arising from either magnetic disorder or coexisting charge disorder and external magnetic fields. Using renormalization-group analysis, we determine how Coulomb interactions, pairings, and magnetic disorder collectively influence the transport behavior and topological properties of the double helical liquid. As the system transitions from class DIII to class BDI, an additional topological phase supporting a single Majorana zero mode per corner emerges. We further show how additional pairing or Coulomb asymmetry influences the stability of various topological phases and uncovers a revival of Majorana zero modes and cascades of transitions through topological phases characterized by a $\mathbb {Z}$ invariant, which are accessible through controlling the electrical screening effect. In contrast to conventional understanding, disorder is not merely detrimental, as it in general allows for a tuning knob that qualitatively reshapes the topological superconductivity in imperfect helical liquids.

Title: Spin-orbit torques in bulk collinear antiferromagnets:complete classifications and the induced spin dynamics
Authors: Yizhuo Song, Jianting Dong, Jiahao Shentu, Jia Zhang
Abstract: Electric field induced spin-orbit torques are the crucial mechanism for electric regulations of antiferromagnetic order. However, the spin-orbit torques in antiferromagnets and the induced spin dynamics remain largely unexplored. In this work, the full classifications of SOTs in bulk collinear AFMs have been achieved based on magnetic point group. Dependent on the symmetries connecting the opposite spin sublattices, the SOTs are classified into six distinct types. Among them, the SOTs and the induced Neel vector dynamics in three representative AFMs have been investigated, where the spin sublattices are connected by fractional translation, spatial inversion, and neither by translation nor inversion symmetry respectively. The SOTs on spin sublattices have been calculated by first-principles calculations based on Kubo linear response theory, and then the induced spin dynamics are simulated by LLG equations. In typical PT symmetric AFM and the inversion symmetry breaking altermagnet, the simulations indicate that the deterministic switching of Neel vectors can be driven by field like torques. What's more, the fully electric writing of multiple antiferromagnetic domains into single domain state with preset Neel vector direction and 180 deterministic switching may also be realized. Our work may shed light on the current control of antiferromagnetic orders in collinear AFMs. Especially, for inversion symmetry breaking altermagnet, the electric writing and reading of Neel vector are highly desirable for antiferromagnetic memory applications.

Title: Structure Prediction of Ionic Epitaxial Interfaces with Ogre Demonstrated for Colloidal Heterostructures of Lead Halide Perovskites
Authors: Stefano Toso, Derek Dardzinski, Liberato Manna, Noa Marom
Abstract: Colloidal epitaxial heterostructures are nanoparticles composed of two different materials connected at an interface, which can exhibit properties different from those of their individual components. Combining dissimilar materials offers opportunities to create several functional heterostructures. Yet, assessing structural compatibility (the main prerequisite for epitaxial growth) is challenging when pairing complex materials with different lattice parameters/crystal structures. This complicates both the selection of target heterostructures for synthesis and the assignment of interface models when new heterostructures are obtained. Here, we demonstrate Ogre as a powerful tool to accelerate the design and characterization of colloidal heterostructures. To this end we implemented developments tailored for the efficient prediction of epitaxial interfaces between ionic/polar materials, which encompass most colloidal semiconductors. These include pre-screening candidate models based on charge balance at the interface and using a classical potential for fast energy evaluations, with parameters automatically extracted from the input bulk structures. These developments are validated for CsPbBr3/Pb4S3Br2 heterostructures, where Ogre produces interface models in agreement with density functional theory and experiments. Furthermore, we use Ogre to rationalize the templating effect of CsPbCl3 on the growth of lead sulfochlorides, where perovskite seeds induce the formation of Pb4S3Cl2 rather than Pb3S2Cl2 due to better epitaxial compatibility. Combining Ogre simulations with experimental data enables us to unravel the structure and composition of the hitherto unsolved CsPbBr3/BixPbySz interface and assign a structure to many other reported metal halide/oxide based interfaces. The Ogre package is available on GitHub or via the OgreInterface desktop application, available for Windows, Linux and Mac.

Title: Surface acoustic wave-driven valley current generation in intervalley coherent states
Authors: Hiroto Tanaka, Youichi Yanase
Abstract: Recent experiments have reported valley-gauge-symmetry-broken phases, identified as intervalley coherent (IVC) states. Exploration of anomalous responses, particularly those analogous to superconductivity, has become an urgent theoretical issue. In this study, we show that the IVC order gives rise to anomalous valley-current generation driven by surface acoustic waves (SAWs). The anomalous valley current exhibits a characteristic power-law dependence for low-frequency SAWs. Furthermore, we demonstrate by numerical analysis that the IVC order significantly enhances valley-current generation in rhombohedral graphene. These results open a pathway toward exploring exotic phenomena emerging from valley-gauge-symmetry breaking, in close analogy with gauge-symmetry breaking in superconductors.

Title: Excitation energies and UV-Vis absorption spectra from INDO/s+ML
Authors: Ezekiel Oyeniyi, Omololu Akin-Ojo
Abstract: The semi-empirical INDO/s method is popular for studies of excitation energies and absorption of molecules due to its low computational requirement, making it possible to make predictions for large systems. However, its accuracy is generally low, particularly, when compared with the typical accuracy of other methods such as time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT). Here, we present machine learning (ML) models that correct the INDO/s results with negligible increases in the amount of computing resources needed. While INDO/s excitations energies have an average error of about 1.1 eV relative to TDDFT energies, the added ML corrections reduce the error to 0.2 eV. Furthermore, this combination of INDO/s and ML produces UV-Vis absorption spectra that are in good agreement with the TDDFT predictions.

Title: First-principles study of the phase competition, mechanical and piezoelectric properties of pseudo-binary (SiC)(AlN) alloy
Authors: Laszlo Wolf, Geoff L. Brennecka, Vladan Stevanović
Abstract: The ongoing search for new piezoelectric materials offering adequate balance between piezoelectric response and other application-relevant properties has lead to the investigation of various alloy systems. In this work we study the alloy of the widely used AlN with SiC for their relative abundance, current use in other electronics applications and expected phase competition between wurtzite and other polymorphs, the kind of which has lead to some of the most interesting results notably between AlN and ScN. Here the pseudo-binary (SiC)(AlN) alloy is studied from first-principles over the entire composition range. Relevant crystalline phases are identified using the First-Principles Random Structure Sampling approach which, in accordance with previous bulk experiments, finds wurtzite, zincblende and rhombohedral phases to be the only statistically relevant phases of the alloy. Further study of these phases is done through Special Quasi-random Structures (SQS) and, in the case of the wurtzite phase, predictions of the stiffness, piezoelectric and dielectric tensors. Analysis of these tensors is done through the scope of a Bulk AcousticWave (BAW) filter application, where trends and trade-offs between the c-axis acoustic velocity and piezoelectric response enable identification of relevant compositions.

Title: Electric-Field-Controlled Altermagnetic Transition for Neuromorphic Computing
Authors: Zhiyuan Duan, Peixin Qin, Chengyan Zhong, Shaoxuan Zhang, Li Liu, Guojian Zhao, Xiaoning Wang, Hongyu Chen, Ziang Meng, Jingyu Li, Sixu Jiang, Xiaoyang Tan, Qiong Wu, Yu Liu, Zhiqi Liu
Abstract: Altermagnets represent a novel magnetic phase with transformative potential for ultrafast spintronics, yet efficient control of their magnetic states remains challenging. We demonstrate an ultra-low-power electric-field control of altermagnetism in MnTe through strain-mediated coupling in MnTe/PMN-PT heterostructures with negligible Joule heating. Application of +6 kV/cm electric fields induces piezoelectric strain in PMN-PT, modulating the Néel temperature from 310 to 328 K. As a result, around the magnetic phase transition, the altermagnetic spin splitting of MnTe is reversibly switched "on" and "off" by the electric fields. Meanwhile, the piezoelectric strain generates lattice distortions and magnetic structure changes in MnTe, enabling up to 9.7% resistance modulation around the magnetic phase transition temperature. Leveraging this effect, we implement programmable resistance states in a Hopfield neuromorphic network, achieving 100% pattern recognition accuracy at <=40% noise levels. This approach establishes the electric-field control as a low-power strategy for altermagnetic manipulation while demonstrating the viability of altermagnetic materials for energy-efficient neuromorphic computing beyond conventional charge-based architectures.

Title: Engineering Multifunctional Response in Monolayer Fe3O4 via Zr Adsorption: From Half-Metallicity to Enhanced Piezoelectricity
Authors: Sikander Azam, Qaiser Rafiq, Rajwali Khan, Hamdy Khamees Thabet
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) magnetic oxides are increasingly studied for their multifunctional potential in fields like spintronics, optoelectronics, and energy conversion. In this research, we conduct a detailed first-principles study of pure monolayer Fe3O4 and its modification through Zr adsorption at two sites: on top of an Fe atom and at the bridge between Fe atoms. Using spin-polarized density functional theory with the GGA plus U method, we examine how adsorption affects structure, electronic, magnetic, optical, elastic, and piezoelectric properties. The original monolayer shows half-metallicity, strong spin polarization, and a moderate in-plane piezoelectric effect. Zr adsorption causes local lattice distortions and orbital hybridization, resulting in intermediate electronic states, a reduced bandgap, and increased optical absorption in both spin channels. Notably, Zr at the bridge site greatly enhances dielectric response, optical conductivity, and piezoelectric coefficients, tripling e11 compared to the pristine layer. Elastic constants indicate mechanical softening after functionalization, and energy loss spectra display shifts in plasmon resonance. These findings suggest Zr adsorption offers a controllable, non-destructive way to tune spin, charge, and lattice interactions in Fe4O4 monolayers, connecting magnetic, optical, and piezoelectric functionalities within a single 2D material platform.

Title: The Feynman paradox in a spherical axion insulator
Authors: Anastasiia Chyzhykova, Jeroen van den Brink, Flavio S. Nogueira
Abstract: We show that a small charged probe near a spherical topological insulator causes the latter to rotate around a symmetry axis defined by the center of the sphere and the position of the charge outside the latter. The rotation occurs when the distance from the charge to the center of the sphere is changed. This phenomenon occurs due to induced static fields and is a consequence of the axion electrodynamics underlying the electromagnetic response of a topological insulator. Assuming a regime where the charged probe can be regarded as a point charge $q=Ne$, where $N$ is a positive integer and $e$ is the elementary electric charge, we obtain that the rotation frequency is given by $\omega=(N\alpha)^2\Upsilon(\epsilon,d/a)/I$, where $I$ is the moment of inertia, $\alpha$ is the fine-structure constant, and the function $\Upsilon$ depends on the dielectric constant $\epsilon$ and the relative distance $d/a$ of the charge from the center of the sphere of radius $a$. Since the point charge also induces Hall currents on the surface, we compute also their associated angular momentum. This allows us to derive an exact expression for the electronic velocity on the surface as a function of $a/d$.

Title: Atomistic understanding of two-dimensional monatomic phase-change material for non-volatile optical applications
Authors: Hanyi Zhang, Xueqi Xing, Jiang-Jing Wang, Chao Nie, Yuxin Du, Junying Zhang, Xueyang Shen, Wen Zhou, Matthias Wuttig, Riccardo Mazzarello, Wei Zhang
Abstract: Elemental antimony (Sb) is a promising material for phase-change memory, neuromorphic computing and nanophotonic applications, because its compositional simplicity can prevent phase segregation upon extensive programming. Scaling down the film thickness is a necessary step to prolong the lifetime of amorphous Sb, but the optical properties of Sb are also significantly altered as the thickness is reduced to a few nanometers, adding complexity to device optimization. In this work, we aim to provide atomistic understanding of the thickness-dependent optical responses in Sb thin films. As thickness decreases, both the extinction coefficient and optical contrast reduce in the near-infrared spectrum, consistent with previous optical measurements. Such thickness dependence gives rise to a bottom thickness limit of 2 nm in photonic applications, as predicted by coarse-grained device simulations. Further bonding analysis reveals a fundamentally different behavior for amorphous and crystalline Sb upon downscaling, resulting in the reduction of optical contrast. Thin film experiments are also carried out to validate our predictions. The thickness-dependent optical trend is fully demonstrated by our ellipsometric spectroscopy experiments, and the bottom thickness limit of 2 nm is confirmed by structural characterization experiments. Finally, we show that the greatly improved amorphous-phase stability of the 2 nm Sb thin film enables robust and reversible optical switching in a silicon-based waveguide device.

Title: Interfacial effect on the optoelectronic and piezoelectric properties of Ge-Sn terminated Halide Perovskite heterostructure from first-principles study
Authors: L. Celestine, R. Zosiamliana, H. Laltlanmawii, B. Chettri, Lalhum Hima, Lalhriat Zuala, S. Gurung, A. Laref, D. P. Rai
Abstract: Since the very early stages of research on sustainable technologies, green energy conversion has always been a prime focus. With the discoveries of countless functional materials in recent years, significant progress has been made to meet the global energy demand for sustainable development. Among them, halide perovskites have emerged as one of the most promising and reliable materials. In this work, we have investigated the lead-free halide perovskites, vis CsGeCl3 and RbSnBr3, within a framework of density functional theory (DFT) to explore their potential applicability in harvesting clean and renewable energy. This study gives a comprehensive analysis of the bulk, sur- face (001), and Ge-Sn-terminated interfaces within GGA and mGGA functionals. Interestingly, the inherent asymmetric arrangements of the systems exhibit remarkable optoelectronic and piezoelectric properties. The piezoelectric performance of each surface cut has been validated through the electromechanical coupling calculation.

Title: Yamaji effect and quantum oscillation in Yang-Rice-Zhang model of underdoped cuprates
Authors: Yicheng Zhong, Fu-Chun Zhang, Kun Jiang
Abstract: Recent experiments have revealed signatures of small Fermi pockets in the pseudogap phase of cuprate superconductors, most notably the Yamaji effect observed in $\mathrm{HgBa}_2\mathrm{CuO}_{4+\delta}$. The Yang-Rice-Zhang (YRZ) model provides a successful phenomenological description of the pseudogap state and naturally predicts such small pockets. In this work, we use a microscopic framework to calculate angle-dependent magnetoresistance and quantum oscillation within the YRZ model. Our calculations simultaneously reproduce the experimentally observed Yamaji oscillations and the Shubnikov-de Haas oscillation corresponding to a pocket area of about $p/8$, with $p$ the hole density. By further testing the effect of Green's-function zeros, we confirm that isolated zeros leave the oscillation period unchanged, whereas an extended zero segment suppresses and modifies the oscillation. Our findings demonstrate that the YRZ model captures essential features of the pseudogap regime and provides a general quantum approach that can be applied to more complex electronic structures.

Title: Nanoscale magnetometry of a synthetic three-dimensional spin texture
Authors: Ricardo Javier Peña Román, Sandip Maity, Fabian Samad, Dinesh Pinto, Simon Josephy, Andrea Morales, Attila Kákay, Klaus Kern, Olav Hellwig, Aparajita Singha
Abstract: Multilayered synthetic antiferromagnets (SAFs) are artificial three-dimensional (3D) architectures engineered to create novel, complex, and stable spin textures. Non-invasive and quantitative nanoscale magnetic imaging of the two-dimensional stray field profile at the sample surface is essential for understanding the fundamental properties of the spin-structure and being able to tailor them to achieve new functionalities. However, the deterministic detection of spin textures and their quantitative characterization on the nanoscale remain challenging. Here, we use nitrogen-vacancy scanning probe microscopy (NV-SPM) under ambient conditions to perform the first quantitative vector-field magnetometry measurements in the multilayered SAF [(Co/Pt)$_5$/Co/Ru]$_3$/(Co/Pt)$_6$. We investigate nanoscale static and dynamic properties of antiferromagnetic domains with boundaries hosting ``one-dimensional'' ferromagnetic stripes with ~ 100 nm of width and periodic modulation of the magnetization. By employing NV-SPM measurements in different imaging modes and involving NV-probes with various crystallographic orientations, we demonstrated distinct fingerprints emerging from GHz-range spin noise and constant stray fields on the order of several mT. This provides quantitative insights into the structure of domains and domain walls, as well as, into magnetic noise associated with thermal spin-waves. Our work opens up new opportunities for quantitative vector-field magnetometry of modern magnetic materials with tailored 3D spin textures and stray field profiles, and potentially novel spin-wave dispersions--in a quantitative and non-invasive manner, with exceptional magnetic sensitivity and nanometer scale spatial resolution.

Title: Relaxation in Polymer Networks under Uniaxial Extension and Biaxial Compression
Authors: Volker Kraus, Wolfgang Hamm, Miklos Zrinyi
Abstract: Predicting the time and temperature dependent behavior of polymer networks under complex loading is essential for the design of advanced elastomeric materials. Many practical applications involve combinations of deformation modes, such as uniaxial extension and biaxial compression, yet a unified description of their mechanical response remains challenging. In this study, we apply a consistent theoretical framework to describe both uniaxial and biaxial deformation modes, using the same constitutive formalism based on van der Waals network theory. The time dependence of the material response in both cases is governed by a substance specific relaxation spectrum, introduced through irreversible thermodynamics as a linear coupling to the quasi static reference state of the permanent network. The temperature dependence of the relaxation times is well described by the Williams Landel Ferry (WLF) equation in the high temperature or low strain rate regime, demonstrating that the same physical mechanisms underlie time dependent behavior across different loading geometries. Experimental results are presented for cross linked poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and polyvinyl acetate (PVAc), validating the theoretical model across both materials and deformation modes.

Title: Discreteness-induced spatial chaos versus fluctuation-induced spatial order in stochastic Turing pattern formation
Authors: Yusuke Yanagisawa, Shin-ichi Sasa
Abstract: We investigate Turing pattern formation in a stochastic reaction-diffusion model defined on $N$ lattice sites, where each lattice site is associated with a reaction vessel of volume $\Omega$. We focus on a regime where spatial discreteness plays a crucial role, namely when the characteristic length of patterns is comparable to the lattice spacing. In this setting, we compare two different limiting procedures and show that they lead to qualitatively different outcomes. If we first take the deterministic limit $\Omega \to \infty$ and then the long-time limit $t \to \infty$, the stationary solutions of the corresponding spatially discrete deterministic equations become spatially chaotic in the limit $N\to\infty$. In contrast, if we first take the limit $t \to \infty$ and then take an appropriate limit of $\Omega \to \infty$ and $N\to\infty$, the resulting patterns are spatially periodic.

Title: Thermally-controlled interlayer exchange and field-induced anisotropy in synthetic antiferromagnets
Authors: O. Kozlov, V. Kalita, S. Reshetniak, A. Kravets, D. Polishchuk, V. Korenivski
Abstract: Interlayer exchange in synthetic antiferromagnets incorporating thin paramagnetic spacers can be controlled thermally. The spacer provides an additional ferromagnetic contribution that renormalizes the otherwise temperature-independent interlayer coupling. As a result, the system shows antiferromagnetic alignment at high temperatures and ferromagnetic alignment at low temperatures. This behavior is observed in Fe(2 nm)/Cr(0.4 nm)/Fe$_{17.5}$Cr$_{82.5}$(0.9 nm)/Cr(0.4 nm)/Fe(2 nm) multilayers with the inner spacer Fe$_{17.5}$Cr$_{82.5}$ paramagnetic at and above room temperature, and is shown to be due to the spacer being significantly magnetically polarized on lowering the temperature toward its Curie point. Although the Fe layers lack intrinsic magnetocrystalline anisotropy, the magnetization reversal demonstrates a field-induced uniaxial anisotropy of antiferromagnetic character. The resulting reversal process resembles that of a metamagnet with a spin-flip transition.

Authors: Rahul Deb, Debajyoti Bhattacharjee, Syed Arshad Hussain
Abstract: Resistive switching (RS) devices, based on soft materials such as organic, biomolecules as well as natural plant extracts etc., has emerged as a promising alternative to the conventional memory technologies. They offer simple device structures, low power requirements, rapid switching and compatibility with high-density device integration. Over the last two decades, these classes of materials have been explored for both non-volatile memory and artificial synapse functions. This chapter provides a brief overview of RS fundamentals, their major classifications, key applications, and recent trends in the use of organic and bio-derived materials.

Title: Electronic structure, orbital-dependent renormalizations, and magnetic correlations in double-layer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under doping tuning
Authors: I. V. Leonov
Abstract: Using the DFT+dynamical mean-field theory approach we study the effects of electronic correlations and doping on the normal state electronic structure of the double-layer nickelate superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure. In agreement with experiments, we obtain significant orbital-dependent quasiparticle renormalizations of the Ni $x^2-y^2$ and $3z^2-r^2$ bands, accompanied by incoherence (bad metal behavior) of the $3z^2-r^2$ states, caused by the proximity of the Ni $3d$ states to orbital-dependent localization. Our results demonstrate a sensitive, non-monotonic dependence of $m^*/m$ on doping, with a remarkable, by about 20\%, increase for the Ni $x^2-y^2$ orbitals upon electron doping $x \sim 0.2$ (per Ni ion), implying a significant enhancement of orbital-dependent correlations with oxygen deficiency in LNO. We observe a reconstruction of the low-energy electronic structure of LNO upon doping above $x\sim -0.3$ and 0.2. It is associated with the Lifshitz transition, with a crossover to a self-doping regime characterized by partial occupation of the La $5d$ bands (upon an electron doping $x>0.2$). Our analysis of the static magnetic susceptibility $\chi({\bf q})$ obtained within DFT+DMFT suggests the possible formation of the spin and charge (or bond) density wave stripes, implying strong spin and charge correlations in LNO. We show that this behavor is associated with suppression of the Néel $G$-type antiferromagnetic ordering of the Ni$^{2+}$ ions upon hole doping. Interestingly, upon a moderate electron doping of the Ni$^{2.5+}$ ions (e.g., with oxygen deficiency), we find a significant enhancement of the strength of in-plane spin and charge fluctuations. We note a close resembles of our results to those for the bilayer Hubbard model, which shows the boosting of superconductivity as one of the two electron bands approaches the Lifshitz transition (e.g., upon doping).

Title: A molecular dynamics study of surface-directed spinodal decomposition on a chemically patterned amorphous substrate
Authors: Syed Shuja Hasan Zaidi, Hema Teherpuria, Santosh Mogurampelly, Prabhat K. Jaiswal
Abstract: We employ a molecular dynamics (MD) study to explore pattern selection in binary fluid mixtures ($AB$) undergoing surface-directed spinodal decomposition on a chemically patterned amorphous substrate. We chose a checkerboard pattern with chemically distinct square patches of a side $M$, with neighboring patches preferring different particle types. We report the efficient transposition of the substrate's pattern as a \emph{registry} to the fluid cross sections in its vicinity when the pattern's periodicity $\lambda/\sigma \simeq 2M$ ($\sigma$ being the fluid particle size) is larger than the mixture's spinodal length scale $\lambda_c/\sigma \simeq 2\pi/\xi_B$ ($\xi_B$ being the bulk correlation length). Our correlation analysis between the surface field and the surface-\emph{registries} in the substrate's normal direction shows that the associated decay length, $L_{\perp}(t)$, increases with decreasing pattern periodicity ($\lambda$). $L_{\perp}(t)$ also exhibits diffusive growth with time $\sim t^{1/3}$, similar to wetting-layer growth for chemically homogeneous walls. Our MD results also show the emergence of composition waves parallel to the substrate, whose wavelength exhibits dynamical scaling with a power-law growth in time $L_{||}(z,t)\sim t^{\alpha}$. $L_{||}(z,t)$ shows dynamical crossovers from a transient \emph{surface-registry} regime to universal \emph{phase-separation} regimes for cross-sections with \emph{registries}. We also give an account of the scaling of \emph{registry's} formation and melting times with patch sizes.

Title: Friction modifies the quasistatic mechanical response of a confined, poroelastic medium
Authors: Térence Desclaux, Callum Cuttle, Chris W. MacMinn, Olivier Liot
Abstract: The mechanical response of elastic porous media confined within rigid geometries is central to a wide range of industrial, geological, and biomedical systems. However, current models for these problems typically overlook the role of wall friction, and particularly its interaction with confinement. Here, we develop a theoretical framework to describe the interplay between the mechanics of the medium and Coulomb friction at the confining walls for slow, quasistatic deformations in response to two canonical uniaxial forcings: piston-driven loading and fluid-driven loading, followed by unloading. We find that, during compression, the stress field evolves according to a quasistatic advection-diffusion equation, extending classical poroelasticity results. The magnitude of friction is controlled by a single dimensionless number proportional to the friction coefficient and the aspect ratio of the confining geometry. During decompression, a portion of the solid matrix remains stuck due to friction, leading to hysteresis and to the propagation of a slip front. In piston-driven loading, the frictional stress is directly coupled to the solid effective stress, leading to exponential damping of the loading and striking changes to the displacement field. However, this coupling limits the energy dissipated by friction. In fluid-driven loading, the pressure gradient locally adds energy, decoupling the frictional stress from the effective stress. The displacement remains qualitatively unchanged but is quantitatively reduced due to large energy dissipation. In both cases, friction can have a substantial impact on the apparent mechanical properties of the medium.

Title: Janus Percolation in Anisotropic Limited-Degree Networks
Authors: Jacopo A. Garofalo, Nuno A.M. Araújo, Lucilla de Arcangelis, Alessandro Sarracino, Eugenio Lippiello
Abstract: Many real-world infrastructures, from sensor and road networks to power grids, are spatially embedded and anisotropic, with constraints on the maximum number of links each node can establish. Such systems can be represented as anisotropic limited-degree networks, in which each node forms at most q outgoing links preferentially oriented along a fixed direction. By increasing the node density sigma at fixed q, we uncover a reentrant percolation transition: a giant strongly connected component emerges, but unexpectedly disintegrates again at high densities. This counterintuitive behavior implies that adding nodes, normally expected to enhance robustness, can instead reduce mutual accessibility and weaken global connectivity. The critical behavior displays two coexisting "faces": random-percolation scaling along the preferred direction and directed-percolation scaling transversely, therefore we name this phenomenon Janus percolation, in analogy with the dual-faced Roman god. These findings demonstrate that anisotropy and degree limitation can jointly induce a novel reentrant connectivity with mixed universality that bridges the universality classes of random and directed percolation, providing fresh insight into how structural constraints shape connectivity and resilience in spatial networks.

Title: Binding of holes and competing spin-charge order in simple and extended Hubbard model on cylindrical lattice: An exact diagonalization study
Authors: Md Fahad Equbal, M. A. H. Ahsan
Abstract: We investigate the binding of holes and the emergence of competing spin-charge order in the simple and extended Hubbard model using exact diagonalization on the 3x4 cylindrical lattice. For the simple Hubbard model (V=0), we find weakly bound hole pairing mediated by magnetic correlations at intermediate repulsive U, without any evidence of phase separation. Introducing nearest-neighbor interaction V reveals a rich phase diagram: attractive V drives multi-hole clustering and phase separation with localized magnetic quenching, while repulsive V stabilizes charge-density-wave (CDW) order that coexists with bound hole pairs within a modulated magnetic background. At strong coupling (U=10), the competition sharpens, with attractive V overcoming on-site repulsion to form magnetically quenched clusters and repulsive V producing robust CDW order that constrains pairing. Real-space analysis of spin and charge correlations provides microscopic evidence of distinct binding mechanisms -- phase separation versus correlation-mediated pairing -- depending on the sign and strength of intersite interaction V . Our results establish a comprehensive picture of how nonlocal Coulomb interactions reshape the landscape of hole-binding and collective order in correlated electron systems.

Title: Multiloop calculations with parametric integration in critical dynamics: the four-loop analytic study of model A of $ϕ^4$ theory
Authors: Loran Ts. Adzhemyan, Diana A. Davletbaeva, Daniil A. Evdokimov, Mikhail V. Kompaniets
Abstract: We perform an analytical four loop calculation of exponent $z$ in model A of critical dynamics in $d=4-2\varepsilon$ dimensions. This is the first time such a large order of perturbation theory has been calculated analytically for models of critical dynamics. To do this, we apply the modern method of parametrical integration with hyperlogaritms. We discuss in detail peculiarities of application of this method to critical dynamics, e.g. the problem of linear-irreducible diagrams already present in four loop (contrary to statics where the first linear-irreducible diagram appears in six loop).

Title: An intermediately-homogenized peridynamics approach to failure of microstructually disordered materials
Authors: Shucheta Shegufta, Michael Zaiser
Abstract: Peridynamics provides a versatile tool for fracture modelling in materials where fracture pathways cannot be predicted beforehand, but must be envisaged as an emergent features of the deformation process. One class of materials where this is surely the case are materials with strong microstructural disorder such as random composites, random porous materials or disordered metamaterials. For this class of materials we propose an intermediately-homogenized peridynamic modelling approach where the disordered microstructure is not resolved in full spatial detail but described in terms of random order parameter fields which retain essential information about the local heterogeneity and spatial correlations of material properties.

Title: Epitaxial Sr(Sn, Ge)$_{x}$Ti$_{1-x}$O$_{3}$ buffer layers for continuous strain engineering on SrTiO$_{3}$ substrates
Authors: Ruben Hamming-Green, Ewout van der Veer, Beatriz Noheda
Abstract: Epitaxial strain plays a key role in determining the structure and functionality of thin films, with the choice of substrate being traditionally used to control the magnitude of the applied strain. However, even in the large family of perovskite materials, this allows for only a limited, discrete set of strain states to be achieved. Here we report on an approach to controlling epitaxial strain for the growth of perovskite materials by involving a single SrTiO$_{3}$ substrate (the most available perovskite in single crystal form) and a buffer layer that consists of the solid solution Sr(Sn, Ge)$_{x}$Ti$_{1-x}$O$_{3}$, of which the lattice parameter can be tuned in a continuous fashion, from 3.880 Å up to 4.007 Å, while maintaining coherent epitaxial growth on SrTiO$_{3}$ with high quality interfaces. Using a BaTiO$_{3}$ overlayer as a model system, we show that changes to the buffer layer composition, i.e. increase of in-plane lattice parameter, change the strain state of BaTiO$_{3}$ from fully relaxed, through highly compressively strained, to an exotic state showing 'inverted' epitaxy in which the buffer layer is relaxed from the substrate but lattice matched to the overlayer.

Title: Edge states of a Bi$_2$Se$_3$ nanosheet in a perpendicular magnetic field
Authors: Stan P. J. Koenis, Lucas Maisel Licerán, Henk T. C. Stoof
Abstract: Conventional wisdom dictates that the conducting edge states of two-dimensional topological insulators of the Bi$_2$Se$_3$ family are protected by time-reversal symmetry. However, theoretical bulk calculations and a recent experiment show that the edge states persist in the presence of large external magnetic fields. To address this apparent contradiction, we have developed an analytical description for the edge-state wave function of a semi-infinite sample in a perpendicular magnetic field. Our description relies on the usual bulk Landau levels, together with additional states arising due to the presence of the hard wall, which are unnormalizable in the infinite system. The analytical wave functions agree extremely well with numerical calculations and can be used to directly analyze the behavior of the edge states in a magnetic field.

Title: Thermal and Size Effects in Ferroelastic Domains by Machine Learning
Authors: Luka Geddis Zellmann, Sumner B. Harris, John R. R. Scott, Yi-Chieh Yang, Joerg Jinschek, Rama Vasudevan, Miryam Arredondo
Abstract: Ferroelastic domain walls (DWs) underpin key functionalities in complex oxides. In free-standing ferroic thin films, where elastic interactions are highly thickness dependent, understanding DW behaviour across length scales and external stimuli is crucial. A thickness-dependent monopolar-to-dipolar crossover in elastic DW behaviour has been reported; however, how temperature influences this regime remains unexplored. Here, LaAlO3 thin films spanning the dipolar ($<200$ nm) and crossover (200-300 nm) regimes are investigated using in situ heating scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and a machine-learning-driven image analysis approach. By tracking DW curvature and density from above $T_C$ (approximately $550,^\circ$C) to room temperature (RT), a distinct interplay between temperature and thickness is identified. In the dipolar regime, DWs are mobile and curved near $T_C$ and gradually freeze upon cooling, consistent with the well-known temperature freezing regime. In contrast, within the crossover regime, DWs are nearly static, with minimal reconfiguration through cooling and curvature an order of magnitude lower at RT. These results map the evolution of DWs across the thermally driven super-elastic to freezing regimes, revealing how thickness and temperature govern DW morphology and dynamics, and providing insight relevant for domain engineering in free-standing oxide thin films.

Title: Stability of the symmetry-protected topological phase and Ising transitions in a disordered U(1) quantum link model on a ladder
Authors: Mykhailo V. Rakov, Luca Tagliacozzo, Maciej Lewenstein, Jakub Zakrzewski, Titas Chanda
Abstract: We revisit the U(1) quantum link model in a ladder geometry, finding, by finite-size scaling, that the critical exponent $\nu=1$ and the central charge $c=1/2$ are consistent with the Ising universality class for all phase transitions observed. A blind application of the Harris criterion would suggest that this criticality is lost in the presence of the disorder. It turns out not to be the case. For the disorder affecting ladder's rung hoppings only, we have found that the transitions survive disappearing only for quite strong disorder. The disorder in the ladder's legs destroys the nonzero mass phase criticality, while the symmetry-protected topological phase for zero mass survives a small disorder. The observed robustness against disorder is explained qualitatively using field-theoretic arguments.

Title: Ferroelectric metal-organic frameworks as wide band gap materials
Authors: Monirul Shaikh, Sathiyamoorthy Buvaneswaran, Asif Latief Bhat, Trilochan Sahoo, Saurabh Ghosh
Abstract: Wide band gap materials are particularly relevant at high temperatures. The band gap shrinkage at higher temperatures prevents device applications with narrow band gap semiconductors. Considering $\alpha$-phase strontium cyanurate as a prototype structure, we identify a group of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) that exhibit ultra-wide band gaps ranging from 5.5 to 5.7 eV. Recently, a strontium cyanurate compound was found to undergo a phase transition from a high-symmetry $\beta$-phase to a low-symmetry ferroelectric $\alpha$-phase when the temperature was reduced. In the present study, utilizing group theory techniques, we unravel that a zone-center $\Gamma_2^-$ phonon mode modifies our structures from high-symmetry $\beta$-phase to a low-symmetry $\alpha$-phase for A$_3$(O$_3$C$_3$N$_3$)$_2$ MOFs with A = Mg, Ca, Sr, and Ba. We implement first-principles calculations to investigate structural, ferroelectric, and optical properties of these compounds in $\alpha$-phase. The switching barriers between bistable polar states are also estimated. Further, to realize their feasibility, we examine the dynamical and thermal stabilities for all of these MOFs.

Title: Magnetic anisotropy and dipolar interactions in the frustrated triangular-lattice magnet NaGdS_2

Abstract: In this comprehensive study, we present results of bulk measurements (magnetization, specific heat, ac susceptibility, thermal expansion, and magnetostriction) combined with local methods such as nuclear magnetic resonance (^23Na NMR) and electron spin resonance (ESR) and simulations (McPhase) on polycrystalline and single-crystalline NaGdS_2 samples. The rare-earth delafossite NaGdS_2 is a triangular-lattice magnet with S = 7/2 spin-only Gd^3+ moments with suppressed single-ion anisotropy. In our study, we estimate that NaGdS_2 has a weak antiferromagnetic exchange (J_H/k_B is about 52mK) and signs of long-range magnetic order are absent down to lowest temperature. However, indications of short range magnetic order are found below 180 mK in the ac susceptibility and thermal expansion. Our results indicate an interplay of Heisenberg-type and dipolar exchange. Due to the large moment of the Gd^3+ ions, one expects a strong impact of the dipolar coupling in NaGdS_2, in contrast to the related NaYbS_2. ESR and ^23Na NMR measurements, indeed, indicate the formation of short-range ferromagnetic correlations. NaGdS_2 appears to be a rare system, in which magnetic order is suppressed by a competition between Heisenberg and dipolar interactions.

Title: Phase structure of the one-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory with second nearest-neighbor interactions
Authors: Yeimer Zambrano, Aleksey Alekseev, Konrad J. Kapcia, Krzysztof Cichy, Agnieszka Cichy
Abstract: We investigate the ground-state phase diagram of a one-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory (LGT) model with hard-core bosons at half-filling, extending previous studies by including second nearest-neighbor (2NN) interactions. Using matrix product state techniques within the density matrix renormalization group, we compute charge gap, static structure factor, and pair-pair correlation functions for various interaction strengths and field parameters. We analyze two representative neatest-neighbor interaction strengths ($V_1$) that correspond to the Luttinger liquid (LL) and Mott insulator (MI) phases in the absence of the 2NN interactions. We introduce the 2NN coupling $V_2$ and investigate its impact on the system. Our results reveal very rich behavior. As the 2NN repulsion increases, in the case of small $V_1$, we observe a direct transition from the LL phase to a charge-ordered insulator (COI) phase, whereas for large $V_1$, we observe a transition from the MI phase (previously found with only $V_1$ included), going through an intermediate LL region, and finally reaching the COI regime. Additionally, the inclusion of 2NN interactions enhances charge order and suppresses pair coherence, evidenced by sharp peaks in the structure factor and rapid decay in pair-pair correlators. Our work extends the well-studied phase structure of 1D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT models and demonstrates the interplay between gauge fields, confinement, and extended interactions.

Title: Composition/structure directed search for new chalcogenide compounds

Abstract: This work presents a simple scheme for finding new crystalline compounds by adapting structure types from neighbor atoms compounds. The approach is demonstrated for the selenide and sulfide families of binary compounds. It predicts ten new compounds that are not currently included in the inorganic crystal structure database (ICSD). The compounds primarily originated from a small search domain that includes near neighbors. Comparison with extended searches that include structures from binary systems of more remote atoms in the periodic table demonstrate the relative efficiency of near neighbor screening. This points at the possibility of using similar directed searches as a heuristic rule for efficiently finding new stable compounds in additional compound families.

Title: Performance and reliability potential of Bi$_2$O$_2$Se/Bi$_2$SeO$_5$ transistors

Abstract: While 2D materials have enormous potential for future device technologies, many challenges must be overcome before they can be deployed at an industrial scale. One of these challenges is identifying the right semiconductor/insulator combination that ensures high performance, stability, and reliability. In contrast to conventional 2D interfaces, which suffer from van der Waals gaps or covalent bonding issues, zippered structures such as the high-mobility 2D semiconductor Bi$_2$O$_2$Se and its native high-$\kappa$ oxide Bi$_2$SeO$_5$ offer high-quality interfaces, good scalability, and excellent device performance. While most prior work has focused mainly on basic device behavior, here we also thoroughly assess the stability and reliability of this material system using a multiscale approach that integrates electrical characterization, density functional theory, and TCAD simulations, linking atomistic states to device-scale reliability. By analyzing four transistor design generations (top-gated, fin, and two gate-all-around FETs), we provide realistic predictions for how this system performs at the ultimate scaling limit. We identify oxygen-related defects in the oxide as the main contributors to hysteresis and recoverable threshold shifts, and we propose mitigation strategies through encapsulation or oxygen-rich annealing. Benchmarking the extracted material parameters against IRDS 2037 requirements, we demonstrate that Bi$_2$O$_2$Se/Bi$_2$SeO$_5$ transistors can achieve high drain and low gate currents at ultra-scaled conditions. These findings position this material system as a technologically credible and manufacturing-relevant pathway for future nanoelectronics.

Title: Computational Approach to Investigate Structure-Property Relationship of a series of Carbazole Containing Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescent Molecules
Authors: Md. Asif, Nazia Chawdhury
Abstract: Donor-acceptor type compounds are an important category of organic materials that show properties suitable for light emission applications. To achieve a full understanding of the mechanism of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) process, we studied the structure-property relationship for a series of carbazole based TADF emitters, 2CzPN, 4CzPN, 4CzIPN, 4CzBN and 5CzBN. We applied density functional theory to investigate kinetic and electronic properties. We find that the energetic position of triplet excited state of these emitters depends on their molecular structure. Our findings emphasize that to enable reverse intersystem crossing and eventually TADF, strong spin orbit coupling and minimal energy difference between singlet and triplet states $\Delta E_{ST}$ must be obtained simultaneously. We also find that the reverse intersystem crossing rates $k_{RISC}$ values are higher where $\Delta E_{ST}$ values are closer to reorganization energy. Furthermore, a small change in the absorption peak of optical absorption spectra with and without spin orbit coupling (SOC) is observed for each emitter. This result is extremely beneficial for the design of new TADF molecules, and we believe that our work contributes to the progress of future development of high-performance organic molecular light-emitting devices.

Title: Large Language Models for Superconductor Discovery
Authors: Suman Itani, Yibo Zhang, Ranjit Itani, Jiadong Zang
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for automated data extraction and property prediction across materials science, yet their use in superconductivity research remains limited. Here we construct a large experimental database of 78,203 records, covering 19,058 unique compositions, extracted from scientific literature using an LLM-driven workflow. Each entry includes chemical composition, critical temperature, measurement pressure, structural descriptors, and critical fields. We fine-tune several open-source LLMs for three tasks: (i) classifying superconductors vs. non-superconductors, (ii) predicting the superconducting transition temperature directly from composition or structure-informed inputs, and (iii) inverse design of candidate compositions conditioned on target Tc. The fine-tuned LLMs achieve performance comparable to traditional feature-based models and in some cases exceed them, while substantially outperforming their base versions and capturing meaningful chemical and structural trends. The inverse-design model generates chemically plausible compositions, including 28% novel candidates not seen in training. Finally, applying the trained predictors to the GNoME database identifies unreported materials with predicted Tc > 10 K. Although unverified, these candidates illustrate how integrating an LLM-driven workflow can enable scalable hypothesis generation for superconductivity discovery.

Title: Brightening of dark trions in monolayer WS$_2$ via localization of surface plasmons
Authors: Sreyan Raha, Tara Shankar Bhattacharya, Indrani Bose, Achintya Singha
Abstract: Optically inactive dark trions in two-dimensional semiconductors are poised to play a stellar role in future quantum technologies due to their long lifetimes, about two orders of magnitude greater than those of their bright counterparts. In monolayer (ML) tungsten disulphide (WS$_2$), accessing these states via optical activation remains challenging, specially at elevated temperatures. Here, we demonstrate the brightening of dark trions from ML WS$_2$ in the temperature range, 83 K-115 K, via localized surface plasmon modes in a disordered gold substrate. The resulting photoluminescence (PL) spectrum reveals a distinct spectral doublet with the twin peaks separated by ~ 45 meV. We propose that the peaks represent semi-dark and bright trion states, the origin of which lies in intervalley electron-electron scatterings. We also report on the experimental evidence of a negative degree of circular polarization in ML WS$_2$ at the energy of the semi-dark trion state.

Title: Topological Engineering of a Frustrated Antiferromagnetic Triradical in Aza-Triangulene Architectures
Authors: Francisco Romero-Lara, Manuel Vilas-Varela, Ricardo Ortiz, Manish Kumar, Alessio Vegliante, Lucía Gómez-Rodrigo, Jan Patrick Calupitan, Diego Soler, Nikas Friedrich, Dongfei Wang, Jon Ortuzar, Stefano Trivini, Fabian Schulz, Thomas Frederiksen, Pavel Jelínek, Diego Peña, Jose Ignacio Pascual
Abstract: Open-shell nanographenes provide a versatile platform to host unconventional magnetic states within their {\pi}-conjugated networks. Particularly appealing are graphene architectures that incorporate spatially separated radicals and tunable interactions, offering a scalable route toward spin-based quantum architectures. Triangulenes are ideal for this purpose, as their radical count scales with size, although strong hybridization prevents individual spin control. Here, we realize a radical reconfiguration strategy that transforms a single-radical aza-triangulene into a frustrated antiferromagnetic triradical by covalently extending it with armchair anthene moieties of increasing length. Scanning tunnelling spectroscopy reveals edge-localized Kondo resonances and a doublet-to-quartet spin excitation, evidencing the emergence of correlated spins. Multi-reference electronic-structure calculations trace the progressive increase in polyradical character with anthene length, driven by the clustering of frontier states within a narrow energy window. Consequently, the initial single-radical doublet reorganizes into a frustrated triradical with weakly coupled edge spins, a molecular analog of a three-qubit quantum register.

Title: Disorder mediated fully compensated ferrimagnetic spin-gapless semiconducting behaviour in Cr3Al Heusler alloy
Authors: Reshna Elsa Philip, Pooja Vyas, Nikhil Joseph Joy, Sandip Kumar Kuila, Sonia Beniwal, Akshata Magar, Dinesh Kumar Shukla, Partha Pratim Jana, Amit Kumar, Aftab Alam, Jayakumar Balakrishnan, Soham Manni
Abstract: Spin-gapless semiconductors (SGSs) that simultaneously host fully compensated ferrimagnetism are highly sought for energy-efficient and stray-field-free spintronic technologies, yet their realization in chemically disordered systems has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate that the binary Heusler alloy Cr3Al despite adopting a fully A2-disordered structure exhibits a rare coexistence of SGS transport and a fully compensated ferrimagnetic (FCF) ground state. Single-crystalline and polycrystalline Cr3Al samples were synthesized, and comprehensive structural analyses using single crystal XRD, synchrotron powder XRD, and neutron powder diffraction reveal complete Cr/Al site mixing. Remarkably, this chemical disorder does not disrupt magnetic order; instead, magnetization, X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD), and temperature-dependent neutron diffraction establish a robust compensated ferrimagnetic state with a vanishingly small ordered moment of 0.1(1) muB/f.u and a high Curie temperature of 773(2) K. Electrical and thermal transport measurements uncover clear SGS characteristics, including weak temperature-dependent conductivity, very low Seebeck coefficients, and electron-hole compensated transport. Hall measurements show unusual temperature-dependent carrier concentrations consistent with disorder-modified electronic states. First-principles calculations on an A2-disordered SQS structure reproduce the experimentally observed negligibly small magnetization (0.0072 muB/f.u) and reveal a vanishing spin-up band gap unambiguously supporting SGS behavior driven by chemical disorder. Our results identify Cr3Al as the first experimentally verified A2-disordered Heusler alloy exhibiting both fully compensated ferrimagnetism and spin-gapless semiconducting transport, positioning it as a robust and disorder-tolerant platform for next-generation, high-temperature spintronic devices.

Title: Hybrid quantum-classical matrix-product state and Lanczos methods for electron-phonon systems with strong electronic correlations: Application to disordered systems coupled to Einstein phonons
Authors: Heiko Georg Menzler, Suman Mondal, Fabian Heidrich-Meisner
Abstract: We present two quantum-classical hybrid methods for simulating the time-dependence of electron-phonon systems that treat electronic correlations numerically exactly and optical-phonon degrees of freedom classically. These are a time-dependent Lanczos and a matrix-product state method, each combined with the multi-trajectory Ehrenfest approach. Due to the approximations, reliable results are expected for the adiabatic regime of small phonon frequencies. We discuss the convergence properties of both methods for a system of interacting spinless fermions in one dimension and provide a benchmark for the Holstein chain. As a first application, we study the decay of charge density wave order in a system of interacting spinless fermions coupled to Einstein oscillators and in the presence of quenched disorder. We investigate the dependence of the relaxation dynamics on the electron-phonon coupling strength and provide numerical evidence that the coupling of strongly disordered systems to classical oscillators leads to delocalization, thus destabilizing the (finite-size) many-body localization in this system.

Title: Electronic crystals and quasicrystals in semiconductor quantum wells: an AI-powered discovery
Authors: Filippo Gaggioli, Pierre-Antoine Graham, Liang Fu
Abstract: The homogeneous electron gas is a cornerstone of quantum condensed matter physics, providing the foundation for developing density functional theory and understanding electronic phases in semiconductors. However, theoretical understanding of strongly-correlated electrons in realistic semiconductor systems remains limited. In this work, we develop a neural network based variational approach to study quantum wells in three dimensional geometry for a variety of electron densities and well thicknesses. Starting from first principles, our unbiased AI-powered method reveals metallic and crystalline phases with both monolayer and bilayer charge distributions. In the emergent bilayer, we discover a new quantum phase of matter: the electronic quasicrystal.

Title: Shaping chaos in bilayer graphene cavities
Authors: Jucheng Lin, Yicheng Zhuang, Anton M. Graf, Joonas Keski-Rahkonen, Eric J. Heller
Abstract: Bilayer graphene (BLG) cavities, where electrons are confined in finite graphene flakes, provide a suitable platform to study quantum chaotic phenomena in condensed matter systems due to the trigonal warping of the Fermi surface. Here, we investigate the effect of the misalignment between the BLG lattice and the cavity geometry, introduced by rotating the boundary relative to the lattice, which can drive the system towards chaos. Based on a tight-binding model, eigenenergy level statistics reveals that rotation leads to level repulsion following Wigner-Dyson statistics, while corresponding eigenstate analysis indicates a transition from near-integrability to spatially uncorrelated random waves. Analysis of the semiclassical ray-dynamics with the trigonal-warped dispersion unveils an ergodic phase space structure, providing a quantum-classical correspondence of the onset of chaos. These findings establish an avenue to quantum chaotic phenomena in BLG cavities with potential applications in quantum device engineering.

Title: Structural, physical, and Judd-Ofelt analysis of germanium magnesium-telluroborate glass containing different amounts of Tm2O3
Authors: A. A. El-Maaref, Kh. S. Shaaban, E. A. Abdel Wahab
Abstract: Germanium magnesium-telluroborate glasses with the composition 78B2O3-10GeO2-5TeO2-7-x MgO-xTm2O3, x = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, and 1.5 mol% were fabricated by using the melt quenching process. With the increase of Tm2O3 concentration, the density values increase from 3.574 to 4.153 this http URL-1, while the molar volume values decrease from 21.145 to 19.445 cm3/mol. Fourier transform infrared analysis supports the existence and conversion of BO3 and BO4. The conversion of BO3 to BO4 would lead to greater bridging oxygens BOs, influencing and reinforcing the glass network. The optical features were studied. The optical band gap decreased by increasing Tm2O3 content in the glass formula, while the index of refraction increased. The parameters take the values between 3.16 eV and 2.31 eV. Other optical and physical constants were determined like optical conductivity, electronegativity, metallization, reflection loss, steepness parameters, and transmission coefficient. Judd-Ofelt theory is used to estimate the optical intensities and line strengths of the present glasses. Radiative lifetimes and branching ratios are evaluated of different manifolds belonging to Tm3+ doped present glasses. The results showed the possibility of potential applications for these materials in the fields of laser development, Light-emitting diodes (LEDs), optical amplification and optoelectronic devices.

Title: Pair-density-wave in quarter-metals from a repulsive fermionic interaction in graphene heterostructures: A renormalization group study
Authors: Sk Asrap Murshed, Bitan Roy
Abstract: Electronic bands in chirally stacked $n$ layer carbon-based honeycomb heterostructures, encompassing rhombohedral ($n \geq 3$), Bernal bilayer ($n=2$), and monolayer ($n=1$) graphene, possess four-fold valley and spin degeneracy. Such systems with $n \geq 2$, when subject to external perpendicular electric displacement fields, feature a fully degenerate metal at high doping, a spin non-degenerate but valley degenerate half-metal at moderate doping, and a non-degenerate quarter-metal at low doping. Due to the fully polarized nature of the quasiparticles in the quarter-metal, realized around one particular valley otherwise chosen spontaneously, it can sustain a single local superconducting ground state, representing a pair-density-wave that is chiral and odd parity in nature. From a leading order renormalization group analysis, here we show that repulsive density-density interaction among such polarized fermionic excitations can foster the pair-density-wave phase at low temperatures. Possible connections with experimentally observed superconducting states in the close vicinity of the quarter-metal in some members of such graphene heterostructures family are discussed.

Title: Haagerup Symmetry in $(E_8)_1$?
Authors: Jan Albert, Yamato Honda, Justin Kaidi, Yunqin Zheng
Abstract: We suggest that the chiral $(\mathfrak{e}_8)_1$ theory -- in many senses the simplest VOA -- may have Haagerup symmetry $\mathcal{H}_i$ for $i=1,2,3$. Likewise, we suggest that the non-chiral $(E_8)_1$ WZW model may have $\mathcal{H}_i \times \mathcal{H}_i^\textrm{op}$ symmetry, and that gauging the diagonal symmetry gives a $c=8$ theory with $\mathcal{Z}(\mathcal{H}_3)$ symmetry, which is the theory predicted in \cite{Evans:2010yr}. Along the way, we show that $(E_8)_1$ also has a $\mathrm{Fib} \times \mathrm{Fib}^\text{op}$ symmetry, and that gauging the diagonal symmetry gives the $(G_2)_1 \times (F_4)_1$ WZW model, explaining the well-known conformal embedding $(G_2)_1 \times (F_4)_1 \subset (E_8)_1$. Finally, we suggest a relation to theories with $\mathcal{H}_3$ symmetry at $c=2,6$, complimenting the discussion with new modular bootstrap results.

Title: Deep Thermalization and Measurements of Quantum Resources
Authors: Naga Dileep Varikuti, Soumik Bandyopadhyay, Philipp Hauke
Abstract: Quantum resource theories (QRTs) provide a unified framework for characterizing useful quantum phenomena subject to physical constraints, but are notoriously hard to assess in experimental systems. In this letter, we introduce a unified protocol for quantifying the resource-generating power (RGP) of arbitrary quantum evolutions applicable to multiple QRTs. It is based on deep thermalization (DT), which has recently gained attention for its role in the emergence of quantum state designs from partial projective measurements. Central to our approach is the use of projected ensembles, recently employed to probe DT, together with new twirling identities that allow us to directly infer the RGP of the underlying dynamics. These identities further reveal how resources build up and thermalize in generic quantum circuits. Finally, we show that quantum resources themselves undergo deep thermalization at the subsystem level, offering a complementary and another experimentally accessible route to infer the RGP. Our work connects deep thermalization to resource quantification, offering a new perspective on the essential role of various resources in generating state designs.

Title: Detailed balance in large language model-driven agents
Authors: Zhuo-Yang Song, Qing-Hong Cao, Ming-xing Luo, Hua Xing Zhu
Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-driven agents are emerging as a powerful new paradigm for solving complex problems. Despite the empirical success of these practices, a theoretical framework to understand and unify their macroscopic dynamics remains lacking. This Letter proposes a method based on the least action principle to estimate the underlying generative directionality of LLMs embedded within agents. By experimentally measuring the transition probabilities between LLM-generated states, we statistically discover a detailed balance in LLM-generated transitions, indicating that LLM generation may not be achieved by generally learning rule sets and strategies, but rather by implicitly learning a class of underlying potential functions that may transcend different LLM architectures and prompt templates. To our knowledge, this is the first discovery of a macroscopic physical law in LLM generative dynamics that does not depend on specific model details. This work is an attempt to establish a macroscopic dynamics theory of complex AI systems, aiming to elevate the study of AI agents from a collection of engineering practices to a science built on effective measurements that are predictable and quantifiable.

Title: Generation of Perfectly Achromatic Optical Vortices Using a Compensated Tandem Twisted Nematic Cell
Authors: Dmytro O. Plutenko, Mikhail V. Vasnetsov
Abstract: The generation of white optical vortices is currently constrained by intrinsic trade-offs between spectral bandwidth, conversion efficiency, and temporal pulse integrity in conventional diffractive and geometric-phase approaches. In this work, we theoretically investigate a compensated tandem crossed twisted nematic (TN) liquid crystal architecture that overcomes these fundamental limitations. By developing a rigorous Jones matrix model and defining specific figures of merit for chromatic fidelity, we analyze the impact of manufacturing imperfections and non-adiabatic waveguiding (deviations from the Mauguin regime) on the device performance. We propose and evaluate three distinct compensation strategies, ranging from optimized passive designs for specific manufacturing tolerances to a robust active compensation scheme utilizing a tunable retarder. Our analysis demonstrates that the active approach effectively nullifies parasitic amplitude modulation, enabling the generation of perfectly achromatic vortices with high phase purity across an arbitrary bandwidth. This establishes the compensated tandem TN cell as a superior and versatile platform for high-fidelity white-light singular optics.

Title: The von Neumann algebraic quantum group $\mathrm{SU}_q(1,1)\rtimes \mathbb{Z}_2$ and the DSSYK model
Authors: Koen Schouten, Mikhail Isachenkov
Abstract: The double-scaling limit of the SYK (DSSYK) model is known to possess an underlying $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{su}(1,1))$ quantum group symmetry. In this paper, we provide, for the first time, a von Neumann algebraic quantum group-theoretical description of the degrees of freedom and the dynamics of the DSSYK model. In particular, we construct the operator-algebraic quantum Gauss decomposition for the von Neumann algebraic quantum group $\mathrm{SU}_q(1,1)\rtimes \mathbb{Z}_2$, i.e. the $q$-deformation of the normaliser of $\mathrm{SU}(1,1)$ in $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$, and derive the Casimir action on its quantum homogeneous spaces. We then show that the dynamics on quantum AdS$_{2,q}$ space reduces to that of the DSSYK model. Furthermore, we argue that the extension of the global symmetry group to its normaliser is not only necessary for a consistent definition of the locally compact quantum group, but that, moreover, the reduction to the DSSYK model works exclusively at the level of the normaliser. The von Neumann algebraic description is shown to give a natural restriction on the allowed quantised coordinates, elegantly ensuring length positivity and non-negative integer chord numbers. Lastly, we make remarks on the correlation function related to the strange series representation, which is argued to interpolate between the AdS and dS regions of our $q$-homogeneous space.

Title: Hydrodynamics of Multi-Species Driven Diffusive Systems with Open Boundaries: A Two-Tasep Study
Authors: Ali Zahra
Abstract: In this short note, we review a recently developed method for analysing multi-component driven diffusive systems with open boundaries. The approach generalises the extremal-current principle known for single-component models and is based on solving the Riemann problem for the corresponding hydrodynamic equations. As a case study, we focus on a two-species exclusion process on a lattice (Two-TASEP), where two types of particles move in opposite directions with two arbitrary rates and exchange positions upon encounter with a third rate. Despite its simplicity, this toy model effectively captures the key features of multi-species driven diffusive systems, including phase separation phenomena. This allows us to illustrate the critical role played by the underlying Riemann invariants in determining the system's macroscopic behavior.

Title: Engineer coherent oscillatory modes in Markovian open quantum systems
Authors: Chun Hei Leung, Pak-Tik Fong, Tianyi Yan, Weibin Li
Abstract: We develop a novel framework to engineer persistent oscillatory modes in Markovian open quantum systems governed by a time-independent Lindblad master equation. We show that oscillatory modes can be created when the Hamiltonian and jump operator can be expressed in the same block-diagonal form. A key feature of the framework is that the dissipator of the Lindblad master equation are generally non-zero. We identify the weak and strong conditions, where the onset of the oscillatory modes is dependent and independent of the parameters of the system, respectively. Our method extends beyond the typical decoherence-free subspace approach, in which the dissipator is zero. We demonstrate the applicability of this framework using various models, showing how carefully tailored system-environment interactions can produce sustained coherent oscillations.

Title: Momentum-space non-Hermitian skin effect in an exciton-polariton system

Abstract: Localization of a macroscopic number of eigenstates on a real-space boundary, known as the non-Hermitian skin effect, is one of the striking topological features emerging from non-Hermiticity. Realizing this effect typically requires periodic (lattice) systems with asymmetry of intersite coupling, which is not readily available in many physical platforms. Instead, it is meticulously engineered, e.g., in photonics, which results in complex structures requiring precise fabrication steps. Here, we propose a simpler mechanism: introducing an asymmetric, purely imaginary potential in a topologically trivial system induces momentum-space localization akin to the skin effect. We experimentally demonstrate this localization using exciton polaritons, hybrid light-matter quasi-particles in a simple engineered `round box' trap, pumped by a laser pump offset from the trap center. The effect disappears if the pump is concentric with the trap. The localization persists and becomes stronger at higher densities of polaritons, when a non-equilibrium Bose-Einstein condensate is formed and the system becomes nonlinear. Our approach offers a new route to realizing skin effects in continuous, non-periodic systems and exploring the interplay of non-Hermiticity, topology, and nonlinearity in macroscopic quantum states.

Title: Tunable discrete quasi-time crystal from a single drive
Authors: Xu Feng, Shuo Liu, Shu Chen, Shi-Xin Zhang
Abstract: The search for exotic temporal orders in quantum matter, such as discrete quasi-time crystals (DQTCs), has become an important theme in nonequilibrium physics. However, realizing these phases has so far required complex protocols, such as drives with multiple incommensurate frequencies. Here, we present a significantly simpler mechanism: the emergence of DQTCs in a dissipative collective spin system subjected to only a single periodic drive. Remarkably, the characteristic frequencies of this novel phase are not fixed but can be continuously tuned by varying the strength of the drive. Even more strikingly, this tunability is punctuated by Arnold tongues, within which the response main frequency locks to rational fractions of the drive. Our model further provides a unified framework that also encompasses stationary, discrete time crystals and chaotic phases. This discovery simplifies the requirements for generating complex temporal orders and opens a viable route towards the experimental control and manipulation of quasi-time crystalline matter.

Title: Optomagnonic generation of entangled travelling fields with different polarizations
Authors: Zi-Xu Lu, Huai-Bing Zhu, Xuan Zuo, Jie Li
Abstract: The optomagnonic coupling between magnons and optical photons is an essential component for building remote quantum networks based on magnonics. Here we show that such a coupling, manifested as the magnon-induced Brillouin light scattering, can be exploited to entangle two propagating optical fields. The protocol employs two pairs of the whispering gallery modes coupled to the same magnon mode in a YIG sphere. In each pair a strong pump field is applied to activate either Stokes or anti-Stokes scattering. Due to the magnon mode involving in the two scattering processes and as a mediation, Stokes and anti-Stokes photons of different polarizations get entangled. The entanglement can be extracted by filtering the travelling output fields centered at the Stokes and anti-Stokes sidebands. Optimal conditions are identified under which strong output entanglement can be achieved.

Title: Generation of mechanical cat-like states via optomagnomechanics
Authors: Hao-Tian Li, Hong-Bin Wang, Zi-Xu Lu, Jie Li
Abstract: We propose an optomagnomechanical approach for preparing a cat-like superposition state of mechanical motion. Our protocol consists of two steps and is based on the magnomechanical system where the magnetostrictively induced displacement further couples to an optical cavity mode via radiation pressure. We first prepare a squeezed mechanical state by driving the magnomechanical system with a two-tone microwave field. We then switch off the microwave drives and send a weak red-detuned optical pulse to the optical cavity to weakly activate the optomechanical anti-Stokes scattering. We show that $k$ phonons can be subtracted from the prepared squeezed state, conditioned on the detection of $k$ anti-Stokes photons from the cavity output field, which prepares the mechanical motion in a cat-like state. The work provides a new avenue for preparing mechanical superposition states by combining opto- and magnomechanics and may find applications in the study of macroscopic quantum states and the test of collapse theories.

Title: The $k$-flip Ising game
Authors: Kovalenko Aleksandr, Andrey Leonidov
Abstract: A partially parallel dynamical noisy binary choice (Ising) game in discrete time of $N$ players on complete graphs with $k$ players having a possibility of changing their strategies at each time moment called $k$-flip Ising game is considered. Analytical calculation of the transition matrix of game as well as the first two moments of the distribution of $\varphi=N^+/N$, where $N^+$ is a number of players adhering to one of the two strategies, is presented. First two moments of the first hitting time distribution for sample trajectories corresponding to transition from a metastable and unstable states to a stable one are considered. A nontrivial dependence of these moments on $k$ for the decay of a metastable state is discussed. A presence of the minima at certain $k^*$ is attributed to a competition between $k$-dependent diffusion and restoring forces.

Title: Fitting magnetization data using continued fraction of straight lines
Authors: Vijay Prakash S
Abstract: Magnetization of a ferromagnetic substance in response to an externally applied magnetic field increases with the strength of the field. This is because at the microscopic level, magnetic moments in certain regions or domains of the substance increasingly align with the applied field, while the amount of misaligned domains decreases. The alignment of such magnetic domains with an applied magnetic field forms the physical basis for the nonlinearity of magnetization. In this paper, the nonlinear function is approximated as a combination of continued fraction of straight lines. The resulting fit is used to interpret the nonlinear behavior in both growing and shrinking magnetic domains. The continued fraction of straight lines used here is an algebraic expression which can be used to estimate parameters using nonlinear regression.

Title: Diagonal boundary conditions in critical loop models
Authors: Max Downing, Jesper Lykke Jacobsen, Rongvoram Nivesvivat, Sylvain Ribault, Hubert Saleur
Abstract: In critical loop models, we define diagonal boundaries as boundaries that couple to diagonal fields only. Using analytic bootstrap methods, we show that diagonal boundaries are characterised by one complex parameter, analogous to the boundary cosmological constant in Liouville theory. We determine disc 1-point functions, and write an explicit formula for disc 2-point functions as infinite combinations of conformal blocks. For a discrete subset of values of the boundary parameter, the boundary spectrum becomes discrete, and made of degenerate representations. In such cases, we check our results by numerically bootstrapping disc 2-point functions. We sketch the interpretation of diagonal and non-diagonal boundaries in lattice loop models. In particular, a loop can neither end on a diagonal boundary, nor change weight when it touches it. In bulk-to-boundary OPEs, numbers of legs can be conserved, or increase by even numbers.

Title: Chaos, Entanglement and Measurement: Field-Theoretic Perspectives on Quantum Information Dynamics
Authors: Anastasiia Tiutiakina
Abstract: This work develops tools to understand how quantum information spreads, scrambles, and is reshaped by measurements in many-body systems. First, I study scrambling and pseudorandomness in the Brownian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, quantifying pseudorandomness using unitary k-designs and frame potentials. Using Keldysh path integrals with replicas and disorder averaging, I obtain analytic control of the approach to randomness, identify collective modes that delay convergence to Haar-like behavior, and estimate design times as functions of model parameters, clarifying links between scrambling, complexity growth, and random-circuit phenomenology. Second, I construct a field theory for weakly measured SYK clusters. Starting from a system-ancilla description and a continuum monitoring limit, and using fermionic coherent states with replicas and disorder averaging, I derive a nonlinear sigma model that captures measurement back-action and the competition between interaction-induced scrambling and information extraction, predicting characteristic crossover scales and response signatures that distinguish weak monitoring from fully unitary evolution. Third, I develop a strong-disorder renormalization group for measurement-only SYK clusters, based on the SO(2n) replica algebra and Dasgupta-Ma decimation rules. The flow shows features reminiscent of infinite-randomness behavior, but an order-of-limits subtlety renders the leading recursions non-robust, so the analytic evidence for an infinite-randomness fixed point is inconclusive, even though the average second Renyi entropy displays logarithmic scaling. Together, these results provide a unified language to diagnose when many-body dynamics generate operational randomness and how measurements redirect that flow.

Title: Event-sparse stack denoising for 4D-STEM applications
Authors: Gregory Nordahl, Rebekka Klemmt, Espen Drath Bøjesen
Abstract: We introduce a denoising method for four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) that relies on processing local, scan position-independent electron event-sparse data stacks, called event-sparse stack denoising. This method adds an extra time dimension during data collection by recording multiple electron event-sparse diffraction patterns. The resulting datasets are effectively five-dimensional, referred to as locally time-resolved STEM (LTR-STEM). Diffraction data stacks at each scan position are processed using one of two sparsity denoising pipelines: 1) the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm followed by multi-step persistence thresholding, or 2) sparse principal component analysis (sparse PCA), followed by single-step thresholding. Both methods perform well for diffraction data denoising, as shown by simulated peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) curves, denoised experimental data for virtual imaging, and application-specific denoising for defect detection. PSNR analysis indicates that sparsity-denoised 4D-STEM data reaches the same PSNR as raw data at approximately 16% of the exposure time, demonstrating comparable image quality with a lower dose. In defect detection, a 4.1x increase in sensitivity to relative radial disk shift is observed in the denoised data. Moreover, the LTR-STEM technique may be used to inspect material degradation by tracking changes in diffraction disk intensity, allowing for critical dose estimation and exposure-selective imaging.

Title: Efficient simulation of low-entanglement bosonic Gaussian states in polynomial time
Authors: Tong Liu, Hui-Ke Jin, Tao Xiang, Hong-Hao Tu
Abstract: Bosonic Gaussian states appear ubiquitously in quantum optics and condensed matter physics but remain difficult to simulate classically due to the hafnian bottleneck. We present an efficient algorithm that converts pure bosonic Gaussian states into matrix product states (MPSs), with a computational cost governed solely by the entanglement and not by the number of bosonic modes. Our method combines a Gaussian singular value decomposition with a projected-creation-operator mapping that constructs local MPS tensors without computing hafnians. Benchmarking on covariance matrices from the Jiuzhang 2.0 and Jiuzhang 4.0 Gaussian boson sampling experiments demonstrates substantial speedups over previous tensor-network approaches in the low-entanglement regime relevant to lossy devices. The method provides a scalable classical simulation framework for bosonic Gaussian states with limited entanglement and extends the applicability of MPS-based methods to a broad range of bosonic systems.

Title: The Physics of Sustainability: Material and Power Constraints for the Long Term
Authors: José Halloy, Petros Chatzimpiros, François Graner, Thomas Gregor
Abstract: Much of today's sustainability discourse emphasizes efficiency, clean technologies, and smart systems, but largely underestimates fundamental physical constraints relating to energy-matter interactions. These constraints stem from the fact that Earth is a materially closed yet energetically open system, driven by the sustained but low power-density flux of solar radiation. This Perspective reframes sustainability within these axiomatic limits, integrating relevant timescales and orders of magnitude. We argue that fossil-fueled industrial metabolism is inherently incompatible with long-term viability, while post-fossil systems are surface-, materials-, and power-intensive. Long-term sustainability must therefore be defined not only by how much energy or material is used, but also by how it is used: favoring organic, carbon-based chemistry with limited reliance on purified metals, operating at low power density, and maintaining low throughput rates. Achieving this requires radical technological shifts toward life-compatible systems and biogeochemical circular processes, and, likely as a consequence, a paradigm change toward degrowth to a steady-state. These two shifts are mutually reinforcing and together provide the necessary foundation for any viable future.

Title: $Φ^4\_2$ theory limit of a many-body bosonic free energy
Authors: Lucas Jougla, Nicolas Rougerie (UMPA-ENSL)
Abstract: We consider the quantum Gibbs state of an interacting Bose gas on the 2D torus. We set temperature, chemical potential and coupling constant in a regime where classical field theory gives leading order asymptotics. In the same limit, the repulsive interaction potential is set to be short-range: it converges to a Dirac delta function with a rate depending polynomially on the other scaling parameters. We prove that the free-energy of the interacting Bose gas (counted relatively to the non-interacting one) converges to the free energy of the $\Phi^4\_2$ non-linear Schr{ö}dinger-Gibbs measure, thereby revisiting recent results and streamlining proofs thereof. We combine the variational method of Lewin-Nam-Rougerie to connect, with controled error, the quantum free energy to a classical Hartree-Gibbs one with smeared non-linearity. The convergence of the latter to the $\Phi^4\_2$ free energy then follows from arguments of Fr{ö}hlich-Knowles-Schlein-Sohinger. This derivation parallels recent results of Nam-Zhu-Zhu.

Title: Understanding Surface-Induced Decoherence of NV Centers in Diamond
Authors: Jonah Nagura, Mykyta Onizhuk, Giulia Galli
Abstract: Nitrogen vacancy centers (NV) in proximity to diamond surfaces are promising nanoscale quantum sensors. However, their coherence properties are negatively affected by magnetic and electric surface noise, whose origin and detailed impact have remained elusive. Using atomistic models of diamond surfaces derived with density functional theory, together with decoherence time calculations with cluster correlation expansion methods, we quantify the effects of surface crystallographic orientation and functionalization, and of the density of unpaired electrons on the NV Hahn-echo time $T_2$. We determine a crossover depth at which $T_2$ ceases to be limited by surface nuclear spins and recovers the bulk-limited value. We find that for static surface-electron baths, the ratio between the NV depth and the separation between surface electron spins determines a transition from fast-fluctuating to quasi-static noise, leading to a dependence of $T_2$ on orientation for specific surfaces. We also find that the modulation of $T_2$ by spin-phonon relaxations leads to motional-narrowing at sub-microsecond relaxation times. Importantly, our calculations show that it is only when accounting for surface-spin in-sequence hopping that measured $T_2$ values as a function of depth can be reproduced, thus highlighting the importance of hopping-mediated models to describe the surface spin noise affecting NV sensors. Overall, our work provides clear guidelines for engineering diamond surfaces to achieve enhanced NV coherence for quantum sensing and information processing applications.

Title: The dynamics of thermalisation in the Galerkin-truncated, three-dimensional Euler equation
Authors: Rajarshi, Mohammad Saif Khan, Prateek Anand, Samriddhi Sankar Ray
Abstract: The inviscid, partial differential equations of hydrodynamics when projected via a Galerkin-truncation on a finite-dimensional subspace spanning wavenumbers $-{\bf K}_{\rm G} \le {\bf k} \le {\bf K}_{\rm G}$, and hence retaining a finite number of modes $N_{\rm G}$, lead to absolute equilibrium states. We review how the Galerkin-truncated, three-dimensional, incompressible Euler equation thermalises and its connection to questions in turbulence. We also discuss an emergent pseudo-dissipation range in the energy spectrum and the time-scales associated with thermalisation.

Title: Analyticity and positivity of Green's functions without Lorentz
Authors: Paolo Creminelli, Alessandro Longo, Borna Salehian, Ahmadullah Zahed
Abstract: We study the properties imposed by microcausality and positivity on the retarded two-point Green's function in a theory with spontaneous breaking of Lorentz invariance. We assume invariance under time and spatial translations, so that the Green's function $G$ depends on $\omega$ and $\vec k$. We discuss that in Fourier space microcausality is equivalent to the analyticity of $G$ when $\Im (\omega,\vec k)$ lies in the forward light-cone, supplemented by bounds on the growth of $G$ as one approaches the boundaries of this domain. Microcausality also implies that the imaginary part of $G$ (its spectral density) cannot have compact support for real $(\omega,\vec k)$. Using analyticity, we write multi-variable dispersion relations and show that the spectral density must satisfy a family of integral constraints. Analogous constraints can be applied to the fluctuations of the system, via the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. A stable physical system, which can only absorb energy from external sources, satisfies $\omega \cdot \Im G(\omega,\vec k) \ge 0$ for real $(\omega,\vec k)$. We show that this positivity property can be extended to the complex domain: $\Im [\omega\, G(\omega,\vec k)] >0$ in the domain of analyticity guaranteed by microcausality. Functions with this property belong to the Herglotz-Nevanlinna class. This allows to prove the analyticity of the permittivities $\epsilon(\omega,k)$ and $\mu^{-1}(\omega,k)$ that appear in Maxwell equations in a medium. We verify the above properties in several examples where Lorentz invariance is broken by a background field, e.g. non-zero chemical potential, or non-zero temperature. We study subtracted dispersion relations when the assumption $G \to 0$ at infinity must be relaxed.

Title: Partitioned Expansions for Approximate Tensor Network Contractions
Authors: Glen Evenbly, Johnnie Gray, Garnet Kin-Lic Chan
Abstract: We propose a method for approximating the contraction of a tensor network by partitioning the network into a sum of computationally cheaper networks. This method, which we call a partitioned network expansion (PNE), builds upon recent work that systematically improves belief propagation (BP) approximations using loop corrections. However, in contrast to previous approaches, our expansion does not require a known BP fixed point to be implemented and can still yield accurate results even in cases where BP fails entirely. The flexibility of our approach is demonstrated through applications to a variety of example networks, including finite 2D and 3D networks, infinite networks, networks with open indices, and networks with degenerate BP fixed points. Benchmark numerical results for networks composed of Ising, AKLT, and random tensors typically show an improvement in accuracy over BP by several orders of magnitude (when BP solutions are obtainable) and also demonstrate improved performance over traditional network approximations based on singular value decomposition (SVD) for certain tasks.

Title: Topological aspects of periodically driven non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model
Authors: Vivek M. Vyas, Dibyendu Roy
Abstract: A non-Hermitian generalization of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model driven by a periodic external potential is investigated, and its topological features are explored. We find that the bi-orthonormal geometric phase acts as a topological index, well capturing the presence/absence of the zero modes. The model is observed to display trivial and non-trivial insulator phases and a topologically non-trivial M${ö}$bius metallic phase. The driving field amplitude is shown to be a control parameter causing topological phase transitions in this model. While the system displays zero modes in the metallic phase apart from the non-trivial insulator phase, the metallic zero modes are not robust, as the ones found in the insulating phase. We further find that zero modes' energy converges slowly to zero as a function of the number of dimers in the M${ö}$bius metallic phase compared to the non-trivial insulating phase.

Abstract: Permanent magnets draw their properties from a complex interplay of chemical composition and phase, each with their associated intrinsic magnetic properties. Gaining an understanding of these interactions is the key to deciphering the origins of a permanent magnets' magnetic performance and facilitate the engineering of much improved-performing magnets. Here, we use advanced multiscale microscopy and microanalysis on a bulk Sm2(Co,Fe,Cu,Zr)17 pinning-type high-performance magnet with outstanding thermal and chemical stability. Comparison of the microstructure in regions of different composition, we demonstrate that the pinning of magnetic domains, imaged by nanoscale magnetic induction mapping, is controlled by the composition and atomic arrangement of copper. This is confirmed by micromagnetic simulations. Contrary to the belief that grain boundaries are "weak links" in magnetic materials, we demonstrate grain boundaries undergo magnetization reversal at relatively low fields (0.1-0.3 T), but this remains confined to these regions and does not significantly impact the magnet's coercivity. Our results showcase that it is the optimal microstructure within the grain itself that is crucial for achieving the desired magnetic properties.

Title: Correcting Delocalization Error in Materials with Localized Orbitals and Linear-Response Screening
Authors: Jacob Z. Williams, Weitao Yang
Abstract: Delocalization error prevents density functional theory (DFT) from reaching its full potential, causing problems like systematically underestimated band gaps and misaligned energy levels at interfaces. We introduce lrLOSC to correct delocalization error in materials over a wide range of band gaps. We predict eleven materials' fundamental gaps to within 0.22 eV, while offering a nonzero total energy correction; molecular properties are improved with a parallel implementation of the same theory [J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 16, 2492 (2025)]. lrLOSC is an essential step toward modeling molecules, materials, and their interfaces within the same DFT framework.

Title: Dynamical signature of vortex mass in Fermi superfluids
Authors: Andrea Richaud, Matteo Caldara, Massimo Capone, Pietro Massignan, Gabriel Wlazłowski
Abstract: Quantum vortices are commonly described as funnel-like objects around which the superfluid swirls, and their motion is typically modeled in terms of massless particles. Here we show that in Fermi superfluids the normal component confined in the vortex core provides the vortex with a finite inertial mass. This inertia imparts an unambiguous signature to the dynamic behavior of vortices, specifically manifesting as small-amplitude transverse oscillations which remarkably follow the prediction of a simple point-like model supplemented by an effective mass. We demonstrate this phenomenon through large-scale time-dependent simulations of Fermi superfluids across a wide range of interaction parameters, at both zero and finite temperatures, and for various initial conditions. Our findings pave the way for the exploration of inertial effects in superfluid vortex dynamics.

Title: Convection can enhance the capacitive charging of porous electrodes
Authors: Aaron D. Ratschow, Alexander J. Wagner, Mathijs Janssen, Steffen Hardt
Abstract: Charge transport in porous electrodes is foundational for modern energy storage technologies like supercapacitors, fuel cells, and batteries. Supercapacitors in particular rely solely on storing energy in charged pores. Here, we simulate the charging of a single electrolyte-filled pore using the modified Poisson-Nernst-Planck and Navier-Stokes equations. We find that electroconvection can substantially speed up the charging dynamics. We uncover the fundamental mechanism of electroconvection during pore charging through an analytical model that predicts the induced flow field and the electric current arising due to convection. Our findings suggest that convection is especially important in the limit of slender pores with thin electric double layers, and becomes significant beyond a certain threshold voltage that is an inherent electrolyte property.

Title: Accelerating Discovery of Extreme Lattice Thermal Conductivity by Crystal Attention Graph Neural Network (CATGNN) Using Chemical Bonding Intuitive Descriptors
Authors: Mohammed Al-Fahdi, Riccardo Rurali, Jianjun Hu, Christopher Wolverton, Ming Hu
Abstract: Designing materials with targeted lattice thermal conductivity (LTC) demands electronic-level insight into chemical bonding. We introduce two bonding descriptors, namely normalized negative integrated crystal orbital Hamilton populations (-ICOHP) and normalized integrated crystal orbital bond index (ICOBI), that strongly correlate with LTC and rattling (mean-squared displacement), surpassing empirical rules and the unnormalized -ICOHP across >4,500 inorganic crystals by first-principles. We train a Crystal Attention Graph Neural Network (CATGNN) to predict these descriptors and screen ~200,000 database structures for extreme LTCs. From 367 (533) candidates with low (high) normalized -ICOHP and normalized ICOBI, first-principles validation identifies 106 dynamically stable compounds with LTC <5 W/mK (68% <2 W/mK) and 13 stable compounds with LTC >100 W/mK. The descriptors' low cost and clear physical meaning provide a rapid, reliable route to high-throughput discovery and inverse design of crystalline materials with ultralow or ultrahigh LTC for applications in thermal insulation, thermoelectrics, and electronics cooling.

Title: Second Harmonic Hall Response in Insulators: Inter-band Quantum Geometry and Breakdown of Kleinman's Conjecture
Authors: Wen-Yu He, K. T. Law
Abstract: The nonlinear Hall effect has recently garnered significant attention as a powerful probe of Fermi surface quantum geometry in metals. While current studies mainly focus on the nonlinear Hall response driven by quasi-static electric fields of low frequencies, the extension of the response to higher frequencies is another promising frontier, which introduces quantum geometry into inter-band transitions. Here, we demonstrate that a specific nonlinear Hall response, namely the second harmonic Hall (SHH) response, can arise from inter-band transitions. We establish the quantum geometric origin of the SHH response and show that inter-band quantum geometry dominates the SHH response when driven near inter-band resonance. Crucially, we find that the inter-band SHH response in insulators exhibits strong frequecy dispersion, manifesting the breakdown of Kleinman's conjecture in nonlinear optics. This connects the SHH response to the breakdown of Kleinman's conjecture and reveals that frequency dispersive insulators generally allow the SHH response. Furthermore, we predict a giant SHH susceptibility in gated strained bilayer graphene and propose that one can apply the polarization resolved second harmonic microscopy to detect the SHH response there.

Title: Theory of rare-earth Kramers magnets on a Shastry-Sutherland lattice: dimer phases in presence of strong spin-orbit coupling
Authors: Changle Liu, Guijing Duan, Rong Yu
Abstract: Shastry-Sutherland magnet is a typical frustrated spin system hosting rich phases. While the Heisenberg limit has been extensively studied, the role of spin-orbit coupling is not well explored. Motivated by newly discovered rare-earth Shastry-Sutherland magnets, we construct a generic effective-spin model that describes the interactions between Kramers doublet local moments on a Shastry-Sutherland lattice. Due to the strong spin-orbit coupling, the model takes the form of extended XYZ interactions on both intra- and inter-dimer bonds. We show that, in addition to the conventional "singlet" dimer phase, strong spin-orbit coupling can stabilize peculiar "triplet" dimer phases. These "triplet" dimer phases, though fully gapped, respond immediately to magnetic fields and evolve smoothly into the fully polarized phase. We present that the recently discovered Shastry-Sutherland magnet Yb$_2$Be$_2$GeO$_7$ belongs to the "triplet" dimer phase, and discuss the implication of our results to a broad class of quantum magnets in general.

Title: Interplay of orbital-selective Mott criticality and flat-band physics in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_6$
Authors: Frank Lechermann, Steffen Bötzel, Ilya M. Eremin
Abstract: Superconductivity in nickelates apparently takes place in two different Ni oxidation regimes, namely either for infinite-layer-type compounds close to Ni$^{+}$, or for Ruddlesden-Popper materials close to Ni$^{2+}$. The reduced La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_6$ bilayer with a nominal Ni$^{1.5+}$ oxidation state may therefore serve as a normal-state mediator between the two known families of $3d^8$-like and $3d^9$-like superconducting nickelates. Using first-principles many-body theory, we explain its experimental 50\,meV charge gap as originating from a new type of correlated (quasi-)insulator. Flat-band electrons of Ni-$d_{z^2}$ character become localized from scattering with orbital-selective Mott-localized Ni-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ electrons, by trading in residual hopping energy for a gain in local exchange energy in a ferromagnetic Kondo-lattice scenario. Most importantly, the flat-band electrons offer another route to unconventional superconductivity in nickelates at ambient pressure.

Title: Eigenstructure Analysis of Bloch Wave and Multislice Formulations for Dynamical Scattering in Transmission Electron Microscopy
Authors: Arya Bangun, Oleh Melnyk, Benjamin März
Abstract: We investigate the eigenstructure of matrix formulations used for modeling scattering processes within materials in transmission electron microscopy. Dynamical scattering is crucial for describing the interaction between an electron wave and the material under investigation. Unlike the Bloch wave formulation, which defines the transmission function via the scattering matrix, the traditional multislice method is lacking a pure transmission function due to the entanglement of electron waves with the propagation function. To address this, we reformulate the multislice method into a matrix framework, which we refer to as the transmission matrix. This allows a direct comparison to the scattering matrix derived from Bloch waves in terms of their eigenstructures. Through theory, we demonstrate their equivalence with eigenvectors related by a two-dimensional Fourier matrix, given that the eigenvalue angles differ by modulo $2\pi n$ (integer $n$). We numerically verify our findings as well as demonstrate the application of the eigenstructure for the estimation of the mean inner potential.

Title: Coherent microwave comb generation via the Josephson effect
Authors: Angelo Greco, Xavier Ballu, Francesco Giazotto, Alessandro Crippa
Abstract: Frequency combs represent exceptionally precise measurement tools due to the coherence of their spectral lines. While optical frequency comb sources constitute a well-established technology, superconducting circuits provide a relatively unexplored on-chip platform for low-dissipation comb emitters able to span from gigahertz to terahertz frequencies. We demonstrate coherent microwave frequency comb generation by leveraging the ac Josephson effect in a superconducting quantum interference device. A time-dependent magnetic drive periodically generates voltage pulses, which in the frequency domain correspond to a comb with dozens of spectral modes. The micrometer-scale footprint and minimal dissipation inherent to superconducting systems foster the integration of our comb generator with advanced cryogenic electronics. Transferring optical techniques to the solid-state domain may enable new applications in quantum technologies.

Title: Chiral Heisenberg Gross-Neveu-Yukawa criticality: Honeycomb vs. SLAC fermions
Authors: Thomas C. Lang, Andreas M. Läuchli
Abstract: We perform large scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the Hubbard model at half filling with a single Dirac cone close to the critical point, which separates a Dirac semi-metal from an antiferromagnetically ordered phase where SU(2) spin rotational symmetry is spontaneously broken. We discuss the implementation of a single Dirac cone in the SLAC formulation for eight Dirac components and the influence of dynamically induced long-range super-exchange interactions. The finite size behavior of dimensionless ratios and the finite size scaling properties of the Hubbard model with a single Dirac cone are shown to be superior compared to the honeycomb lattice. We extract the critical exponent believed to belong to the chiral Heisenberg Gross-Neveu-Yukawa universality class: The critical exponent ${\nu = 1.02(3)}$ coincides for the two lattice types once honeycomb lattices of linear dimension ${L\ge 15}$ are considered. In contrast to the SLAC formulation, where the anomalous dimensions are estimated to be ${\eta_{\phi}=0.73(1)}$ and ${\eta_{\psi}=0.09(1)}$, they remain less stable on honeycomb lattices, but tend towards the estimates from the SLAC formulation.

Title: Quantitative imaging of nonlinear spin-wave propagation using diamond quantum sensors
Authors: Kensuke Ogawa, Moeta Tsukamoto, Yusuke Mori, Daigo Takafuji, Junichi Shiogai, Kohei Ueda, Jobu Matsuno, Jun-ichiro Ohe, Kento Sasaki, Kensuke Kobayashi
Abstract: Spin waves propagating in magnetic materials exhibit nonlinear behavior at large amplitudes due to the competition between excitation and relaxation, providing an attractive platform for exploring nonlinear wave dynamics. In particular, spin waves with a non-zero wavenumber that carry momentum undergo nonlinear relaxation and experience wavenumber modulation in the nonlinear regime. This nonlinearity has been observed experimentally, for example in S. R. Lake et al., Phys. Rev. Appl. 17, 034010 (2022), but a quantitative comparison with theory has not yet been carried out. Here, We image nonlinear spin-wave propagation in two yttrium iron garnet thin films with distinct spin-wave decay rates using a wide-field quantum diamond microscope. We obtain quantitative distributions of spin-wave amplitude and phase as a function of the excitation microwave strength. As a result, we observe a threshold in the spin-wave amplitude beyond which nonlinear effects become evident and confirm that this threshold is consistent with theoretical predictions based on four-magnon scattering for both samples. Moreover, as the amplitude of the spin waves increases, we observe modulation of the wavenumber across the field of view. We attribute this modulation primarily to a reduction in the saturation magnetization caused by incoherent spin waves generated by multi-magnon scattering. Our quantitative measurements provide a pathway for visualizing nonlinear spin-wave dynamics and are crucial for deepening our understanding of the underlying mechanisms.

Title: Entropy Production in Non-Gaussian Active Matter: A Unified Fluctuation Theorem and Deep Learning Framework
Authors: Yuanfei Huang, Chengyu Liu, Bing Miao, Xiang Zhou
Abstract: We present a general framework for deriving entropy production rates (EPRs) in active matter systems driven by non-Gaussian active fluctuations. Employing the probability-flow equivalence technique, we rigorously obtain an entropy production (EP) decomposition formula. We demonstrate that the EP, $\Delta s_\mathrm{tot}$, satisfies a detailed fluctuation theorem, $\rho_{\mathcal{R}}(\Sigma)/\rho_{\mathcal{R}}(-\Sigma)=e^{\Sigma}$, which holds for the distribution $\rho_{\mathcal{R}}(\Sigma)$ defined as the probability of observing a value $\Sigma$ of the quantity $\mathcal{R}\equiv \Delta s_\mathrm{tot}-B_\mathrm{act}$, where $B_\mathrm{act}$ is a path-dependent random variable associated with active fluctuations. Moreover, an integral fluctuation theorem, $\langle e^{- \mathcal{R} } \rangle = 1$, and the generalized second law of thermodynamics, $\langle \Delta s_\mathrm{tot} \rangle \ge \langle B_\mathrm{act} \rangle$, follow directly. Our results hold under steady-state conditions and can be straightforwardly extended to arbitrary initial states. In the limiting case where active fluctuations vanish, these theorems reduce to the established results of stochastic thermodynamics. Building on this theoretical foundation, we introduce a deep-learning-based methodology for efficiently computing the EP, utilizing the Lévy score we propose. To illustrate the validity of our approach, we apply it to two representative systems: a Brownian particle in a periodic active bath and an active polymer composed of an active Brownian cross-linker interacting with passive Brownian beads. Our work provides a unified framework for analyzing EP in active matter and offers practical computational tools for investigating complex nonequilibrium behavior.

Title: Numerical renormalization of glassy dynamics
Authors: Johannes Lang, Subir Sachdev, Sebastian Diehl
Abstract: The quench dynamics of glassy systems are challenging. Due to aging, the system never reaches a stationary state but instead evolves on emergent scales that grow with its age. This slow evolution complicates field-theoretic descriptions, as the weak long-term memory and the absence of a stationary state hinder simplifications of the memory, always leading to the worst-case scaling of computational effort with the cubic power of the simulated time. Here, we present an algorithm based on two-dimensional interpolations of Green's functions, which resolves this issue and achieves sublinear scaling of computational cost. We apply it to the quench dynamics of the spherical mixed $p$-spin model to establish the existence of a phase transition between glasses with strong and weak ergodicity breaking at a finite temperature of the initial state. By reaching times three orders of magnitude larger than previously attainable, we determine the critical exponents of this transition. Interestingly, these are continuously varying and, therefore, non-universal. While we introduce and validate the method in the context of a glassy system, it is equally applicable to any model with overdamped excitations.

Title: Bridging the Gap Between Avalanche Relaxation and Yielding Rheology
Authors: Leonardo Relmucao-Leiva, Carlos Villarroel, Gustavo Düring
Abstract: The yielding transition in amorphous materials, whether driven passively (simple shear) or actively, remains a fundamental open question in soft matter physics. While avalanche statistics at the critical point have been extensively studied, the emergence of the dynamic regime at yielding and the steady-state flow properties remain poorly understood. In particular, the significant variability observed in flow curves across different systems lacks a clear explanation. We determine, for the first time, the relationship between avalanche duration and size across the yielding transition, revealing how it evolves from quasistatic to dynamic flow regimes. This precise measurement is made using the Controlled Relaxation Time Model (CRTM), a new simulation framework that treats the relaxation time as a tunable parameter. CRTM reproduces known results in both limits and enables a direct analysis of the change of regime between them. Applying the model to different microscopic dynamics, we find that the existing scaling relation connecting critical exponents under flow holds for passive systems. However, active systems exhibit significant deviations, suggesting a missing ingredient in the current understanding of yielding.

Title: Dynamics of Anyon Clusters in Fractional Quantum Hall Fluids
Authors: Qianhui Xu, Guangyue Ji, Yuzhu Wang, Ha Quang Trung, Bo Yang
Abstract: In fractional quantum Hall fluids, the quasiparticle excitations are anyons with fractional charges and statistics. Effective interactions among the anyons can be induced by either model or realistic electron-electron (e-e) interactions. Without losing the generality, we investigate such phenomena for the Laughlin 1/3 and Moore-Read (MR) non-Abelian phases. Anyons display rich internal dynamics in both cases that will lead to interesting experimental consequences. In particular, bound states of two Laughlin anyons are preferred under short-range e-e interactions, leading to 2e/3 -- instead of e/3 -- effective charge carriers at low temperatures, which have been seen in several experiments. MR phases host two topologically distinct fusion channels: 1 and psi. The different effective interactions of e/4 anyons in the two sectors suggest the vanishing of the degeneracy of fusion channels when the e-e interaction is no longer its model Hamiltonian, in which case different bound states could also appear. This indicates the possibility of energetically manipulating the two types of anyons by tuning the bare e-e interactions. We point out that the results of recently developed high-resolution STM measurements will be affected by the effective anyon interactions, where anyons are clustered together after the tunneling of electrons. The low-lying parts of the local density of states affected by various anyon clusters are simulated for both Abelian and non-Abelian systems with (screened) Coulomb interactions.

Title: Efficient absolute interface energy calculations for heterostructures: Synergy between localized basis sets and surface passivation techniques
Authors: Sreejith Pallikkara Chandrasekharan, Sofia Apergi, Charles Cornet, Laurent Pedesseau
Abstract: Heterostructures combining diverse physico-chemical properties are increasingly in demand for a wide range of applications in modern science and technology. However, despite their importance in materials science, accurately determining absolute interface energies remains a major challenge. Here, we present a computationally efficient framework for determining interface energies by incorporating a surface passivation technique, demonstrated using pseudo H passivation with a localized basis set method and an explicit chemical potential. This framework is applied to calculate absolute interface energies and analyze the electronic properties of quasi lattice matched and lattice mismatched III and V on Si interfaces, with results compared to conventional reconstructed surface calculations. By combining localized basis sets with surface passivation techniques, this framework allows for accurate estimation of absolute interface energies in heterogeneous material systems. This approach effectively addresses issues associated with surface reconstructions while significantly reducing computational costs within the framework of density functional theory, and moreover offers considerable potential for calculating interface energies across diverse material systems.

Title: Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality in optically induced lattices of exciton-polariton condensates
Authors: D. Novokreschenov, V. Neplokh, M. Misko, N. Starkova, T. Cookson, A. Kudlis, A. Nalitov, I. A. Shelykh, A. V. Kavokin, P. Lagoudakis
Abstract: We investigate space-time coherence in one-dimensional lattices of exciton-polariton condensates formed by fully reconfigurable non-resonant optical pumping. Starting from an open-dissipative Gross-Pitaevskii equation with deterministic reservoir kinetics and stochastic condensate noise, we derive a discrete complex-field model that incorporates coherent tunnelling, reservoir-mediated dissipative coupling and gain-saturation non-linearity. Adiabatic elimination of fast density fluctuations reveals a wedge-shaped region in the complex hopping plane where the coarse-grained phase dynamics reduces to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation. By computing high-resolution phase diagrams of the temporal and spatial scaling exponents we pinpoint the boundaries separating the KPZ domain from the Edwards-Wilkinson (EW) regime. Large-scale graphics processing unit (GPU) simulations of chains containing up to $N=2000$ condensates confirm these predictions: inside the wedge the exponents converge to $\beta_{N}=\textbf{0.329}(3)\!\approx\!1/3$ and $\chi_{N}=\textbf{0.504}(4)\!\approx\!1/2$, whereas outside it the dynamics moves away from KPZ and ultimately flows toward the EW fixed point, although finite system size and finite observation time may yield intermediate effective exponents. These results pave the way to the implementation of ultrafast KPZ-simulators based on one-dimensional arrays of exciton-polariton condensates.

Title: Hydrodynamic theory of wetting by active particles
Authors: Noah Grodzinski, Michael E. Cates, Robert L. Jack
Abstract: The accumulation of self-propelled particles on repulsive barriers is a widely observed feature in active matter. Despite being implicated in a broad range of biological processes, from biofilm formation to cytoskeletal movement, wetting of surfaces by active particles remains poorly understood. In this work, we study this active wetting by considering a model comprising an active lattice gas, interacting with a permeable barrier under periodic boundary conditions, for which an exact hydrodynamic description is possible. We consider a hydrodynamic scaling limit that eliminates dynamical noise while retaining microscopic interpretability, enabling a precise characterisation of steady-states and their transitions. We demonstrate that the accumulation of active particles has remarkable similarities to equilibrium wetting, and that active wetting transitions display all the salient characteristics of the equilibrium critical wetting transition -- despite fundamental differences in underlying microscopic dynamics. However, our framework also enables the investigation of subtle but important nonequilibrium effects in active wetting, including a spontaneous ratchet effect which leads to a global steady-state current, departure of bulk densities from their binodal values, and a novel dynamical transition pathway. Our results provide an intrinsically nonequilibrium framework in which to study active wetting, precisely demonstrating the connection to passive wetting while clarifying the nonequilibrium consequences of activity.

Title: Susceptibility for extremely low external fluctuations and critical behaviour of Greenberg-Hastings neuronal model
Authors: Joaquin Almeira, Daniel A. Martin, Dante R. Chialvo, Sergio A. Cannas
Abstract: We consider the scaling behaviour of the fluctuation susceptibility associated with the average activation in the Greenberg-Hastings neural network model and its relation to microscopic spontaneous activation. We found that, as the spontaneous activation probability tends to zero, a clear finite size scaling behaviour in the susceptibility emerges, characterized by critical exponents which follow already known scaling laws. This shows that the spontaneous activation probability plays the role of an external field conjugated to the order parameter of the dynamical activation transition. The roles of different kinds of activation mechanisms around the different dynamical phase transitions exhibited by the model are characterized numerically and using a mean field approximation.

Title: Jammed disks of two sizes in a channel: segregation driven by steric forces
Authors: Dan Liu, Michael Karbach, Gerhard Müller
Abstract: Disks of two sizes are confined to a long and narrow channel. The axis and the plane of the channel are horizontal. The channel is closed off by pistons that freeze jammed microstates out of loose disk configurations, agitated randomly at calibrated intensity and subject to moderate pressure. Disk sizes and channel width are such that under jamming no disks remain loose and all disks touch one wall. The protocol permits disks to move past each other prior to jamming, which facilitates randomness in the sequence of large and small disks. We present exact results for the characterization of jammed macrostates including volume and entropy for given fractions of small and large disks as functions of energy parameters which depend on the jamming protocol. Our analysis divides the disk sequence of jammed microstates into overlapping tiles out of which we construct 17 species of statistically interacting quasiparticles. Jammed macrostates then depend on the fractions of small and large disks and on a dimensionless control parameter inferred from measures for expansion work against the pistons and intensity of random agitations. Two models are introduced for comparison of key technical aspects: one model emphasizes symmetry and the other mechanical stability. We distinguish regimes for the energy parameters that either enhance or suppress mixing of disk sizes in jammed macrostates. The latter case, if realizable, is a manifestation of grain segregation driven by steric forces alone, without directional bias.

Title: Addressing the Infinite Variance Problem in Fermionic Monte Carlo Simulations: Retrospective Error Remediation and the Exact Bridge Link Method
Authors: Zhou-Quan Wan, Shiwei Zhang
Abstract: We revisit the infinite variance problem in fermionic Monte Carlo simulations, which is widely encountered in areas ranging from condensed matter to nuclear and high-energy physics. The different algorithms, which we broadly refer to as determinantal quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC), are applied in many situations and differ in details, but they share a foundation in field theory, and often involve fermion determinants whose symmetry properties make the algorithm sign-problem-free. We show that the infinite variance problem arises as the observables computed in DQMC tend to form heavy-tailed distributions. To remedy this issue retrospectively, we introduce a tail-aware error estimation method to correct the otherwise unreliable estimates of confidence intervals. Furthermore, we demonstrate how to perform DQMC calculations that eliminate the infinite variance problem for a broad class of observables. Our approach is an exact bridge link method, which involves a simple and efficient modification to the standard DQMC algorithm. The method introduces no systematic bias and is straightforward to implement with minimal computational overhead. Our results establish a practical and robust solution to the infinite variance problem, with broad implications for improving the reliability of a variety of fundamental fermion simulations.

Title: Chirality and polarization of inertial antiferromagnetic resonances driven by spin-orbit torques
Authors: Peng-Bin He, Ri-Xing Wang, Zai-Dong Li, Mikhail Cherkasskii
Abstract: It is widely accepted that the handedness of a resonant mode is an intrinsic property. We show that, by tailoring the polarization and handedness of alternating spin-orbit torques used as the driving force, the polarization state and handedness of inertial resonant modes in an antiferromagnet (AFM) can be actively controlled. In contrast with ferromagnets, whose resonant-mode polarization is essentially fixed, AFM inertial modes can continuously evolve from elliptic through circular to linear polarization as the driving polarization is varied. We further identify an inertia-dependent critical degree of driving polarization at which the mode becomes linearly polarized while its handedness reverses.

Title: Altermagnetism and Weak Magnetism in the Insulating Distorted Perovskite Antiferromagnet NaOsO$_3$
Authors: Hong-Suk Choi, M.-C. Jung, K.-H. Ahn, W. E. Pickett, K.-W. Lee
Abstract: The GdFeO$_3$-type perovskite antiferromagnet NaOsO$_3$, calculated here to be altermagnetic for all three typical collinear antiferromagnetic orders, was suggested early on to be a Slater-type insulator, due in large part to its continuous metal-insulator transition and its small energy gap. Below the Néel temperature, the gap opens along with ``weak magnetism'', accompanied by a sharp change in the magnetic susceptibility and resistivity. Without explicit correlation in the band structure calculation, and neglecting spin-orbit coupling (SOC), already a gap opens. Inclusion of a modest on-site Coulomb repulsion ($U\sim$1 eV) is sufficient to eliminate a SOC-induced small band overlap, opening a gap similar to the experimentally observed gap of around 100 meV. Combined evidence supports the viewpoint that NaOsO$_3$ lies in an unusual crossover region between Slater and Mott insulator. The unreported altermagnetism in NaOsO$_3$ is demonstrated and its consequences are considered. The origin of the very weak magnetism has been investigated using a combination of {\it ab initio} calculations and symmetry analysis of the magnetic space group, confirming the origin lying in the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya SOC buttressed by altermagnetic order. After determining the easy axis, our calculation leads to an Os spin canting angle of about 3$^{\circ}$, accounting for the observed weak magnetism and sharp change in the susceptibility. The altermagnetism spin-split bands (up to $\sim$100 meV) are accompanied by a chiral-split magnon spectrum in both acoustic and optical modes in the THz range, and lead to significant anomalous Hall conductivity upon hole doping.

Title: Magnon topology driven by altermagnetism
Authors: Subhankar Khatua, Volodymyr P. Kravchuk, Kostiantyn V. Yershov, Jeroen van den Brink
Abstract: Altermagnets present a class of fully compensated collinear magnetic order, where the two sublattices are not related merely by time-reversal combined with lattice translation or inversion, but require an additional lattice rotation. This distinctive symmetry leads to a characteristic splitting of the magnon bands; however the splitting is only partial -- residual degeneracies persist along certain lines in the Brillouin zone as a consequence of the underlying altermagnetic rotation. We consider a two-dimensional $d$-wave altermagnetic spin model on the checkerboard lattice and introduce additional interactions such as an external magnetic field and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, that lift these degeneracies. The resulting magnon bands become fully gapped and acquire non-trivial topology, characterized by nonzero Chern numbers. We demonstrate the crucial role of altermagnetism for the generation of the Berry curvature. As a direct consequence of the topological magnons, we find finite thermal Hall conductivity $\kappa_{xy}$, which exhibits a characteristic low-temperature scaling, $\kappa_{xy}\propto T^4$. Moreover, $\kappa_{xy}$ changes sign under reversal of the magnetic field, exhibiting a sharp jump across zero field at low temperatures. We also demonstrate topologically protected chiral edge modes in a finite strip geometry.

Title: Correlation effects in one-dimensional metallic quantum wires under various confinements
Authors: Vidit Gangwar, Vinod Ashokan, Ankush Girdhar, Klaus Morawetz, N. D. Drummond, K. N. Pathak
Abstract: Dynamical response theory is used to investigate various transverse confinements on electron correlations in the ground state of a ferromagnetic one-dimensional quantum wire for different wire widths $b$ and density parameters $r_{\rm s}$. Using the first-order random phase approximation (FRPA), which provides the ground state structure beyond the random phase approximation, we compute the structure factor, pair-correlation function, correlation energy, and ground-state energy. The correlation energy depends on the choice of confinement model and hence effective electron-electron interaction. For the ultrathin wire ($b\rightarrow 0$) in the high-density limit, the correlation energy for transverse confinement models $V_1(q)$ (harmonic), $V_2(q)$ (cylindrical), and $V_5(q)$ (harmonic-delta) approaches $\epsilon_{\rm c}(r_{\rm s})= - \pi^2/360 \sim -0.02741$ a.u., which agrees with the exact results in this limit [J. Chem. Phys. 138, 064108 (2013); Phys. Rev. B 101, 075130 (2020)]. For at least these three confinement potentials, the one-dimensional Coulomb potential can be regularized at interparticle distance $x=0$ to yield the same correlation energy. In contrast, $V_3(q)$ (infinite square well), $V_4(q)$ (infinite square-infinite triangular well), and $V_6(q)$ (infinite square-delta well), do not approach the same high-density limit; instead, the correlation energy tends to $\epsilon_{\rm c} \sim -0.03002$ a.u. The ground-state properties obtained from the FRPA are compared with quantum Monte Carlo results. The peak height in the static structure factor at $k=2k_{\rm F}$ depends significantly on the confinement model. These peaks are fitted with a function based on our finite wire-width theory demonstrating good agreement with FRPA.

Title: A catastrophic approach to designing interacting hysterons
Authors: Gentian Muhaxheri, Victoria Antonetti, Christian D. Santangelo
Abstract: We present a framework for analyzing collections of interacting hysterons through the lens of catastrophe theory. By modeling hysteron dynamics as a gradient system, we show how to construct hysteron transition graphs by characterizing the fold bifurcations of the dynamical system. Transition graphs represent the sequence of hysterons switching states, providing critical insights into the collective behavior of driven disordered media. Extending this analysis to higher codimension bifurcations, such as cusp bifurcations and crossings of fold curves, allows us to map out how the topology of transition graphs changes with variations in system parameters. This approach can suggest strategies for designing metamaterials capable of encoding targeted memory and computational functionalities, but it also highlights the rapid increase of design complexity with system size, further underscoring the computational challenges of controlling large hysteretic systems.

Title: Superconductivity in imbalanced bilayer Hubbard model: enhanced $d$-wave and weakened $s^\pm$-wave pairing
Authors: Ziying Jia, Xun Liu, Mi Jiang
Abstract: We investigate the bilayer model with two layers of imbalanced densities coupled by the interlayer hybridization. Using the large-scale dynamical cluster quantum Monte Carlo simulation, we discovered that increased hybridization induces a transition in the superconducting pairing from $d$-wave to $s^{\pm}$-wave and the superconducting $T_c$ of $d$-wave pairing exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on the density imbalance. Remarkably, the optimal superconductivity(SC) occurs at a moderate imbalance. Our results support the possibility of $T_c$ enhancement in composite picture where the underdoped layer provides the pairing strength while the overdoped layer promotes the phase coherence. In addition, the SC can be possibly hosted by a single layer, which is reminiscent of our recent exploration on the trilayer Hubbard model. Our present study thus provides new insight that the SC can be enhanced via the layer differentiation.

Title: Symmetries in zero and finite center-of-mass momenta excitons
Authors: Robin Bajaj, Namana Venkatareddy, H. R. Krishnamurthy, Manish Jain
Abstract: We present a symmetry-based framework for the analysis of excitonic states, incorporating both time-reversal and space-group symmetries. We demonstrate the use of time-reversal and space-group symmetries to obtain exciton eigenstates at symmetry-related center-of-mass momenta in the entire Brillouin zone from eigenstates calculated for center-of-mass momenta in the irreducible Brillouin zone. Furthermore, by explicitly calculating the irreducible representations of the little groups, we classify excitons according to their symmetry properties across the Brillouin zone. Using projection operators, we construct symmetry-adapted linear combinations of electron-hole product states, which block diagonalize the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) Hamiltonian at both zero and finite exciton center-of-mass momenta. This enables a transparent organization of excitonic states and provides direct access to their degeneracies, selection rules, and symmetry-protected features. As a demonstration, we apply this formalism to monolayer MoS$_2$, where the classification of excitonic irreducible representations and the block structure of the BSE Hamiltonian show excellent agreement with compatibility relations derived from group theory. Beyond this material-specific example, the framework offers a general and conceptually rigorous approach to the symmetry classification of excitons, enabling significant reductions in computational cost for optical spectra, exciton-phonon interactions, and excitonic band structure calculations across a wide range of materials.

Title: From hidden order to skyrmions: Quantum Hall states in an extended Hofstadter-Fermi-Hubbard model
Authors: Fabian J. Pauw, Ulrich Schollwöck, Nathan Goldman, Sebastian Paeckel, Felix A. Palm
Abstract: The interplay between topology and strong interactions gives rise to a variety of exotic quantum phases, including fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states and their lattice analogs - fractional Chern insulators (FCIs). Such topologically ordered states host fractionalized excitations and, for spinful systems, are often accompanied by ferromagnetism and skyrmions. Here, we study a Hofstadter-Hubbard model of spinful fermions on a square lattice, extended by nearest-neighbor interactions. Using large-scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations, we demonstrate the emergence of a spin-polarized $\frac{1}{3}$-Laughlin-like FCI phase, characterized by a quantized many-body Chern number, a finite charge gap, and hidden off-diagonal long-range order. We further investigate the quantum Hall ferromagnet at $\nu=1$ and its skyrmionic excitations upon doping. In particular, we find that nearest-neighbor repulsion is sufficient to stabilize both particle- and hole-skyrmions in the ground state around $\nu=1$, whereas we do not find such textures around $\nu=\frac{1}{3}$. The diagnostic toolbox presented in this work, based on local densities, correlation functions, and spin-resolved observables, is directly applicable in quantum gas microscopy experiments. Our results open new pathways for experimental exploration of FCIs with spin textures in both ultracold atom and electronic systems.

Title: Topological transitions controlled by the interaction range
Authors: Vlad Simonyan, Maxim A. Gorlach
Abstract: We study a one-dimensional topological model featuring a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger type pattern of nearest-neighbor couplings in combination with the longer-range interactions exponentially decaying with the distance. We demonstrate that even relatively weak long-range couplings can trigger the topological transition if their range is large enough. This provides an additional facet in the control of topological phases.

Title: Magnetic Moment Fragmentation in an All-in-All-out Pyrochlore $\mathrm{Nd_2Sn_2O_7}$
Authors: Yi Luo, Matthew Powell, Joseph A. M. Paddison, Brenden R. Ortiz, J. Ross Stewart, Joseph W. Kolis, Adam A. Aczel
Abstract: We report single crystal neutron spectroscopy and bulk characterization on hydrothermally grown $\mathrm{Nd_2Sn_2O_7}$, revealing magnetic moment fragmentation embedded within the all-in-all-out ordered state. The spectra show a nearly flat band with pinch-point-like momentum dependence, accompanied by dispersive branches that generate half-moon features across multiple Brillouin zones. These defining signatures are captured quantitatively by a minimal dipolar-octupolar spin Hamiltonian, demonstrating excellent agreement between experiment and theory. The higher flat-mode energy helps account for the absence of dynamical interference in prior $\mathrm{\mu SR}$ studies, while the lack of any photon-like excitation imposes strict constraints on the proposed Coulombic antiferromagnet scenario. Our results extend moment fragmentation to $\mathrm{Nd_2Sn_2O_7}$ and identify it as a clean, tractable platform for quantitative exploration of emergent gauge field physics and multipolar spin-wave dynamics in frustrated magnets.

Title: Superconductivity suppression and bilayer decoupling in Pr substituted YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-δ}$

Abstract: The mechanism behind superconductivity suppression induced by Pr substitutions in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ (YBCO) has been a mystery since its discovery: in spite of being isovalent to Y$^{3+}$ with a small magnetic moment, it is the only rare-earth element that has a dramatic impact on YBCO's superconducting properties. Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and DFT+$U$ calculations, we uncover how Pr substitution modifies the low-energy electronic structure of YBCO. Contrary to the prevailing Fehrenbacher-Rice (FR) and Liechtenstein-Mazin (LM) models, the low energy electronic structure contains no signature of any $f$-electron hybridization or new states. Yet, strong electron doping is observed primarily on the antibonding Fermi surface. Meanwhile, we reveal major electronic structure modifications to Cu-derived states with increasing Pr substitution: a pronounced CuO$_2$ bilayer decoupling and an enhanced CuO chain hopping, implying indirect electron-release pathways beyond simple 4$f$ state ionization. Our results challenge the long-standing FR/LM mechanism and establish Pr substituted YBCO as a potential platform for exploring correlation-driven phenomena in coupled 1D-2D systems.

Title: Time crystalline solitons and their stochastic dynamics in a driven-dissipative ϕ^4 model
Authors: Xingdong Luo, Zhizhen Chen
Abstract: Periodically driven systems provide unique opportunities to investigate the dynamics of topological excitations far from equilibrium. In this paper, we report a time-crystalline soliton (TCS) state in a driven-dissipative $\phi^4$ model. This state exhibits spontaneous breaking of discrete time-translational symmetry while simultaneously displaying spatial soliton behavior. During time evolution, the soliton pattern periodically oscillates between kink and anti-kink configurations. We further study TCS dynamics under noise, demonstrating that soliton random walk can induce a dynamical transition between two distinct $Z_2$ symmetry-breaking time-crystalline phases in time domain. Finally, we examine the annihilation of two spatially separated TCSs under noise. Importantly, in contrast to the confined behavior of time-crystalline monopoles reported in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 056502 (2023)], the dynamics of time-crystalline solitons is deconfined despite the nonequilibrium nature of our model: the statistically averaged annihilation time scales as a power law with the solitons' initial separation.

Title: Impacting spheres: from liquid drops to elastic beads
Authors: Saumili Jana, John Kolinski, Detlef Lohse, Vatsal Sanjay
Abstract: A liquid drop impacting a non-wetting rigid substrate laterally spreads, then retracts, and finally jumps off again. An elastic solid, by contrast, undergoes a slight deformation, contacts briefly, and bounces. The impact force on the substrate - crucial for engineering and natural processes - is classically described by Wagner's (liquids) and Hertz's (solids) theories. This work bridges these limits by considering a generic viscoelastic medium. Using direct numerical simulations, we study a viscoelastic sphere impacting a rigid, non-contacting surface and quantify how the elasticity number ($El$, dimensionless elastic modulus) and the Weissenberg number ($Wi$, dimensionless relaxation time) dictate the impact force. We recover the Newtonian liquid response as either $El \to 0$ or $Wi \to 0$, and obtain elastic-solid behavior in the limit $Wi \to \infty$ and $El \ne 0$. In this elastic-memory limit, three regimes emerge - capillary-dominated, Wagner scaling, and Hertz scaling - with a smooth transition from the Wagner to the Hertz regime. Sweeping $Wi$ from 0 to $\infty$ reveals a continuous shift from materials with no memory to materials with permanent memory of deformation, providing an alternate, controlled route from liquid drops to elastic beads. The study unifies liquid and solid impact processes and offers a general framework for the liquid-to-elastic transition relevant across systems and applications.

Abstract: Laser-generated surface acoustic waves (SAW) facilitate an efficient information processing in modern spintronics and magnonics. The ability to tune SAW parameters is crucial to achieve an acoustic control over magnonic properties. Such tunability can be achieved in phase-changing magnetic materials accommodating both spin waves and SAWs. A promising material is FeRh alloy, a metallic antiferromagnet at room temperature undergoing a phase transition into ferromagnetic state accompanied by a crystal lattice expansion at 370 K. This transition can also be induced by femtosecond laser pulses. In this paper we use the phase transition in 60 nm Fe49Rh51 film to optically generate pulses of Gigahertz quasi-Rayleigh SAWs. We detect them via photoelastic effect and show that the lattice transformation during phase transition is a dominant strain-generation mechanism for above-threshold excitation. The weight of this contribution rises as the sample is heated closer to AFM-FM transition temperature and 'switches off' when heated above it allowing to control the SAW amplitude. A model based on thermodynamical parameters of Fe49Rh51 shows that the lattice transformation occurring within 95 ps effectively contributes to SAW generation happening at a comparable timescale, while non-equilibrium fast kinetics of the phase transition does not.

Title: Spatial and Temporal Cluster Tomography of Active Matter
Authors: Leone V. Luzzatto, Mathias Casiulis, Stefano Martiniani, István A. Kovács
Abstract: Critical phase transitions have proven to be a powerful concept to capture the phenomenology of many systems, including deeply non-equilibrium ones like living systems. The study of these phase transitions has overwhelmingly relied on two-point correlation functions. In this Letter, we show that cluster tomography -- the study of one-dimensional cross-sections of the clusters that emerge near a phase transition -- is an alternative higher-order tool that efficiently locates and characterizes phase transitions in active systems. First, using motility-induced phase separation as a paradigmatic example, we show how complex geometric features of clusters, captured by spatial cluster tomography, can be used to measure critical exponents in active systems without explicitly introducing system-specific order parameters. Second, we introduce temporal cluster tomography, an analogous cluster-based measurement that characterizes the dynamical behavior of active systems. We show that cluster dynamics can be captured by a generalization of burstiness analysis in complex temporal networks. Both spatial and temporal cluster tomography are easy to implement yet powerful approaches to study non-equilibrium systems, making them useful additions to the standard toolbox of statistical physics.

Title: On the First Quantum Correction to the Second Virial Coefficient of a Generalized Lennard-Jones Fluid
Authors: Daniel Parejo, Andrés Santos
Abstract: We derive an explicit analytic expression for the first quantum correction to the second virial coefficient of a $d$-dimensional fluid whose particles interact via the generalized Lennard-Jones $(2n,n)$ potential. By introducing an appropriate change of variable, the correction term is reduced to a single integral that can be evaluated in closed form in terms of parabolic cylinder or generalized Hermite functions. The resulting expression compactly incorporates both dimensionality and stiffness, providing direct access to the low- and high-temperature asymptotic regimes. In the special case of the standard Lennard-Jones fluid ($d=3$, $n=6$), the formula obtained is considerably more compact than previously reported representations based on hypergeometric functions. The knowledge of this correction allows us to determine the first quantum contribution to the Boyle temperature, whose dependence on dimensionality and stiffness is explicitly analyzed, and enables quantitative assessment of quantum effects in noble gases such as helium, neon, and argon. Moreover, the same methodology can be systematically extended to obtain higher-order quantum corrections.

Title: Composition-Dependent Properties of $\mathrm{Ce_{x}La_{0.95-x}Tb_{0.05}F_{3}}$ Nanopowders Tailored for X-Ray Photodynamic Therapy and Cathodoluminescence Imaging
Authors: Xenie Lytvynenko, Marie Urbanová, Ondřej Lalinský, Vilém Vojta, Jan Bárta, Lenka Prouzová Procházková, Václav Čuba
Abstract: This study investigates the synthesis and luminescence behavior of $\mathrm{Ce_{x}La_{0.95-x}Tb_{0.05}F_{3}}$ nanoparticles with varying $\mathrm{Ce^{3+}}$ content. The materials were prepared via a wet chemical route and thermally annealed to improve crystallinity and reduce defects. Phase composition and structural parameters were examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD), while elemental composition was determined by X-ray fluorescence (XRF). Cathodoluminescence (CL) intensity mapping was used to evaluate emission uniformity and monitor the degradation of luminescence under electron beam exposure. Photoluminescence (PL) and radioluminescence (RL) spectroscopy confirmed energy transfer from $\mathrm{Ce^{3+}}$ to $\mathrm{Tb^{3+}}$ ions. Luminescence intensities were found to depend strongly on both Ce content and thermal treatment. The results contribute to the understanding of defect-related quenching mechanisms and are relevant for the design of rare-earth-based luminescent nanomaterials for biomedical applications.

Title: Deformation and organization of droplet-encapsulated soft beads
Authors: Shunsuke Saita, Finn Bastian Molzahn, Clara Delahousse, Julien Husson, Charles N. Baroud
Abstract: Many biological, culinary, and engineering processes lead to the co-encapsulation of several soft particles within a liquid interface. In these situations the particles are bound together by the capillary forces that deform them and influence their biological or rheological properties. Here we introduce an experimental approach to encapsulate a controlled number of soft beads within aqueous droplets in oil. These droplet-encapsulated gels are manipulated in a deformable microfluidic device to merge them and modify the liquid fraction. In the dry limit the contact surface between the hydrogels is found to be determined by the elastocapillary number $E_c$, with the contact radius scaling as $E_c^{1/3}$, indicating that the deformation increases for soft or small particles. When multiple beads are co-encapsulated within a single droplet they can be arranged into linear or three-dimensional aggregates that remain at a local energy minimum.

Title: Robust coherent phonon mode localized at GaP/Si(001) heterointerface
Authors: Kunie Ishioka, Gerson Mette, Steven Youngkin, Andreas Beyer, Wolfgang Stolz, Kerstin Volz, Christopher J. Stanton, Ulrich Höfer
Abstract: Lattice-matched GaP layers can be grown on Si(001) substrate via a two-step growth procedure, consisting of low-temperature nucleation followed by high-temperature overgrowth. Previous time-resolved spectroscopic studies on a thin GaP nucleation layer discovered a discrete electronic state and a phonon mode at 2 THz, both localized at the heterointerface and enhanced resonantly at pump photon energy of 1.4 eV. Here we investigate the influence of the high-temperature overgrowth on the interface electronic state and the 2-THz phonon mode. We find that the 1.4-eV resonances in the electronic transition and in the phonon amplitude vanish after the overgrowth, although the 2-THz phonon mode is still detected. Furthermore, the optical polarization-dependence of the phonon amplitude after the overgrowth is qualitatively different from that before the overgrowth. Our observations imply that the 2-THz phonon mode itself is robust against the high-temperature overgrowth. The phonon amplitude is defined by the coupling with the interface electronic transition, however, the latter of which is more sensitively affected by the overgrowth. We propose that the drastic changes in the electronic transition is triggered by the formation of pyramidal nano-facets at the GaP/Si interface.

Title: Universal Critical Scaling and Phase Diagram of the Non-Hermitian Skin Effect under Disorder
Authors: Ali Tozar
Abstract: Standard scaling theory dictates that disorder leads to immediate localization in one-dimensional Hermitian systems. We demonstrate that non-Hermitian topology fundamentally alters this paradigm, protecting transport up to a substantial critical disorder strength. By employing a numerically stable log-space transfer matrix approach up to thermodynamic scales (N=1000), we identify a sharp phase transition from the topological skin phase to the Anderson localized phase. Finite-size scaling analysis reveals that this transition belongs to a unique universality class with critical exponents \nu\approx1.50 and \beta\approx0.65. Furthermore, we map the global phase diagram, confirming that the critical disorder scales as W_c\propto\sqrt\gamma, consistent with localization suppression by an imaginary vector potential. Our results establish the rigorous limits of non-Hermitian topological protection in imperfect media.

Title: Robust Universality of Non-Hermitian Anderson Transitions: From Dyson Singularity to Model-Independent Scaling
Authors: Ali Tozar
Abstract: We investigate the universality of Anderson localization transitions in one-dimensional non-Hermitian systems exhibiting the skin effect. By developing a numerically stable Log-Space Non-Hermitian Scaling (LNS) method, we overcome the severe floating-point overflow issues associated with the exponential growth of transmittance (T ~ exp(2 gamma L)), enabling precision finite-size scaling analysis up to system sizes of L = 1200. We probe the critical behavior across three distinct disorder landscapes: uniform diagonal, binary diagonal, and off-diagonal (random hopping) disorder. While the uniform model exhibits a standard mobility edge, the off-diagonal model reveals a Dyson-like singularity at the band center (E = 0), where the system resists localization even at strong disorder due to sublattice symmetry protection. However, upon symmetry breaking (E != 0), we demonstrate that all considered models, regardless of the disorder distribution (continuous vs. discrete) or Hamiltonian structure (site vs. bond randomness), belong to the same robust universality class. The critical exponents are determined as nu = 1.50 +/- 0.00 and beta ~ 0.65 through unambiguous data collapse, establishing a model-independent description of non-Hermitian localization transitions.

Title: First Passage Resetting Gas
Authors: Marco Biroli, Satya N. Majumdar, Gregory Schehr
Abstract: We study a one-dimensional gas of $N$ Brownian particles that diffuse independently but are simultaneously reset whenever any of them reaches a fixed threshold located at $L > 0$. For any $N > 2$, the system reaches a non-equilibrium stationary state (NESS) at long-times with strong long-range correlations. These correlations emerge purely from the dynamics, and not from built-in interactions. Despite being strongly correlated, the NESS has a solvable structure that allows for an exact computation of several physical observables, both global and local. These include the average density profile, the distribution of the position of the $k$-th ordered particles, the distribution of the gap between two consecutive particles and the full counting statistics, i.e., the distribution of the number of particles in a finite interval around the origin.

Title: Higgs physics in superconductors
Authors: Hao Chu, Haotian Zhang, Zhili Zhang
Abstract: As pointed out by Nambu&Goldstone, continuous symmetry breaking gives rise to gapless bosonic excitation. In superconductors, continuous local U(1) gauge symmetry is broken. The gapless excitation thus created is the collective phase mode of a superconductor. In 1962, Anderson pointed out that Coulomb interaction lifts this gapless mode to the superconducting plasma frequency. Therefore, in a superconducting fluid there are no bosonic excitations below the Cooper pair binding energy. Anderson mechanism also implies that the massless photon becomes massive in a superconductor. It provides a microscopic theory for dissipationless charge transport (with Landau criterion for superfluidity) and the Meissner effect in a superconductor. Jumping to particle physics, to explain why the gauge bosons for electroweak interaction are massive, Higgs, Englert, Kibble et al. proposed the existence of the Higgs field. This matter field couples to the massless W, Z bosons and generates mass via the Higgs mechanism. Due to their conceptual similarities, these two mechanisms are referred to as the Anderson-Higgs mechanism. In 2013, the detection of the Higgs boson provided the final proof for the Higgs hypothesis decades after its conception. The amplitude mode of a superconductor, which corresponds to the Higgs boson in the above analogy, is referred to as the Higgs mode. Its spectroscopic detection has also remained elusive for decades. In recent years, the development of ultrafast techniques enabled an effective approach for studying the mode. Here, we introduce the Higgs mode from a perspective of why superconductors superconduct and review the recent development in Higgs spectroscopy, particularly in the field of nonlinear terahertz spectroscopy. We discuss the novel insights that may be learnt from these studies for future high-Tc superconductivity and correlated materials research in general.

Title: Exciton spin structure in lead halide perovskite semiconductors explored via the spin dynamics in magnetic field
Authors: Vladimir L. Zhiliakov, Nataliia E. Kopteva, Irina A. Yugova, Dmitri R. Yakovlev, Ilya A. Akimov, Manfred Bayer
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the spin structure and spin dynamics of excitons in bulk lead halide perovskite semiconductors with cubic, tetragonal, and orthorhombic crystal symmetry. The exciton spin structure and its modification by an external magnetic field are modeled for different regimes defined by the relative magnitude of the electron-hole exchange interaction (splitting between dark and bright states) and the Zeeman spin splitting. The effects of crystal symmetry and magnetic field orientation with respect to the crystal axes are considered for lead halide perovskite crystals with band gaps in the range 1.4 - 3.5 eV, having different ratios of electron and hole g-factors. For cubic symmetry, in a longitudinal magnetic field, our theory predicts quantum beats between the bright exciton states under linearly polarized excitation and detection, while the dark exciton remains optically inactive. In a transverse magnetic field, all exciton spin states become optically active and can be excited by circularly polarized light. Reduction of the crystal symmetry leads to a zero-field offset of the exciton Larmor precession frequencies, modifying the Zeeman splitting energy dependence on magnetic field. This theoretical framework allows for the extraction of the strength of the exchange interaction and the crystal symmetry. Experimentally, we measure the exciton spin coherence via time-resolved photoluminescence at a temperature of 1.6 K in longitudinal and transverse magnetic fields in orthorhombic MAPbI3 crystals. Polarization beats at the frequency of the bright exciton are observed in both configurations. Comparison with theory indicates that the excitons are in the strong exchange interaction regime, and the reduction of symmetry does not lead to a significant splitting of the exciton spin levels.

Title: Interaction-Induced Breakdown of Anderson Localization: Thermodynamic Segregation disguised as the Skin Effect
Authors: Ali Tozar
Abstract: We investigate the interplay between strong disorder and repulsive interactions in the one-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model under open boundary conditions. While uncorrelated disorder is widely accepted to localize all single-particle eigenstates, a phenomenon typically reinforced by interactions in the Many-Body Localization (MBL) regime, we report a counter-intuitive breakdown of this paradigm. We demonstrate that strong repulsive interactions can overcome disorder-induced localization, driving the system into a macroscopically segregated phase where spin species accumulate at opposite boundaries. Although this boundary accumulation phenomenologically mimics the Non-Hermitian Skin Effect (NHSE) observed in non-reciprocal systems, our comprehensive analysis reveals a fundamentally different origin. By performing a rigorous control experiment in the Hermitian limit, we prove that the segregation persists without non-reciprocity, identifying many-body energy minimization as the primary driver. This "interaction-induced segregation" manifests as a sharp thermodynamic crossover, characterized by a divergent energy susceptibility, challenging the conventional understanding of disorder-interaction competition in open quantum systems.

Title: Dynamic hysteresis and transitions controlled by asymmetry in potential barrier shaping
Authors: Samudro Ghosh, Moupriya Das
Abstract: Our study unveils the precise role of the underlying potential in regulating the fundamental processes of dynamic hysteresis, which manifests in numerous natural and designed systems. We identify that it is possible to induce symmetry breaking in dynamic hysteresis, and consequently to observe dynamic transitions under moderate conditions, which is absent for the symmetric case, if appropriate asymmetry is implemented in the design of the underlying potential. This kind of asymmetry appears through the disparate widths of the two wells of the intrinsic bistable potential governing the dynamics and the barrier separating them. It is characteristically distinct from the potential in which the two minima are energetically dissimilar. Our understanding suggests that only the intrinsic asymmetry of the former type can substantially influence the elemental dynamics of the processes to generate significant effects on the outcomes. Our study presents a novel approach to quantitatively regulate the outputs, to increase or decrease the extent of dynamic hysteresis, based on the requirements, by effectively controlling the proper asymmetry of the intrinsic potential.

Title: Towards probing velocity distributions in dense granular matter: Utilizing Fiber Bragg Gratings
Authors: Marlo Kunzner, Luis Henriques, Fahad Puthalath, Leonardo Facchini, Mohammadhossein Shahsavari, Léa Gommeringer, Martin Angelmahr, Peidong Yu, Matthias Sperl, Till Böhmer, Jan Philipp Gabriel
Abstract: Granular gases are commonly characterized through their velocity distribution, which provides access to the granular temperature. In experiments, velocity distributions are typically obtained by particle tracking, which however becomes limited at moderate and high particle densities. As a way forward, we propose a new technique for measuring particle velocities in situ by using a Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) sensor, which remains applicable at significantly higher particle this http URL FBG sensor detects strain pulses induced by particle-fiber collisions, from which the velocity of the impacting particle can be derived. Applying this method to an ensemble of granular particles allows to extract its velocity distributions as we present for a granular system excited by a vibrational shaker. We validate the extracted velocity distribution against conventional particle-tracking measurements, confirming the reliability of the FBG-based technique.

Title: A dynamical order parameter for the transition to nonergodic dynamics in the discrete nonlinear Schrödinger equation
Authors: Andrew Kalish, Pedro Fittipaldi de Castro, Wladimir A. Benalcazar
Abstract: The discrete nonlinear Schrödinger equation (DNLSE) exhibits a transition from ergodic, delocalized dynamics to a weakly nonergodic regime characterized by breather formation; yet, a precise characterization of this transition has remained elusive. By sampling many microcanonically equivalent initial conditions, we identify the asymptotic ensemble variance of the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy as a dynamical order parameter that vanishes in the ergodic phase and becomes finite once ergodicity is broken. The relaxation time governing the ensemble convergence of the KS entropy displays an essential singularity at the transition, yielding a sharp boundary between the two dynamical regimes. This framework provides a trajectory-independent method for detecting ergodicity breaking that is broadly applicable to nonlinear lattice systems with conserved quantities.

Title: Many interacting particles in solution. II. Screening-ranged expansion of electrostatic forces
Authors: Sergii V. Siryk, Walter Rocchia
Abstract: We present a fully analytical integration of the Maxwell stress tensor and derive exact relations for interparticle forces in systems of multiple dielectric spheres immersed in a polarizable ionic solvent, within the framework of the linearized Poisson--Boltzmann theory. Building upon the screening-ranged (in ascending orders of Debye screening) expansions of the potentials developed and rigorously analyzed in the accompanying works arXiv:2512.08407, arXiv:2512.08684, arXiv:2512.09421, we construct exact screening-ranged many-body expansions for electrostatic forces in explicit analytical form. These results establish a rigorous foundation for evaluating screened electrostatic interactions in complex particle systems and provide direct analytical connections to, and systematic improvements upon, various earlier approximate or limited-case formulations available in the literature, both at zero and finite ionic strength.

Title: Many interacting particles in solution. III. Spectral analysis of the associated Neumann--Poincaré-type operators
Authors: Sergii V. Siryk, Walter Rocchia
Abstract: The interaction of particles in an electrolytic medium can be calculated by solving the Poisson equation inside the solutes and the linearized Poisson--Boltzmann equation in the solvent, with suitable boundary conditions at the interfaces. Analytical approaches often expand the potentials in spherical harmonics, relating interior and exterior coefficients and eliminating some coefficients in favor of others, but a rigorous spectral analysis of the corresponding formulations is still lacking. Here, we introduce pertinent composite many-body Neumann--Poincaré-type operators and prove that they are compact with spectral radii strictly less than one. These results provide the foundation for systematic screening-ranged expansions, in powers of the Debye screening parameters, of electrostatic potentials, interaction energies, and forces, and establish the analytical framework for the accompanying works arXiv:2512.09421, arXiv:2512.08407, arXiv:2512.08682.

Title: Exact Screening-Ranged Expansions for Many-Body Electrostatics
Authors: Sergii V. Siryk, Walter Rocchia
Abstract: We present an exact many-body framework for electrostatic interactions among $N$ arbitrarily charged spheres in an electrolyte, modeled by the linearized Poisson--Boltzmann equation. Building on a spectral analysis of nonstandard Neumann--Poincaré-type operators introduced in a companion mathematical work arXiv:2512.08684, we construct convergent screening-ranged series for the potential, interaction energy, and forces, where each term is associated with a well-defined Debye--Hückel screening order and can be obtained evaluating an analytical expression rather than numerically solving an infinitely dimensional linear system. This formulation unifies and extends classical and recent approaches, providing a rigorous basis for electrostatic interactions among heterogeneously charged particles (including Janus colloids) and yielding many-body generalizations of analytical explicit-form results previously available only for two-body systems. The framework captures and clarifies complex effects such as asymmetric dielectric screening, opposite-charge repulsion, and like-charge attraction, which remain largely analytically elusive in existing treatments. Beyond its fundamental significance, the method leads to numerically efficient schemes, offering a versatile tool for modeling colloids and soft/biological matter in electrolytic solution.

Title: Domain Wall Control of Topological Qubits in the Kitaev SSH Chain
Authors: Griffith Rufo, Sabrina Rufo, Heron Caldas, Rosiane de Freitas
Abstract: Zero energy states in one dimensional SSH Kitaev hybrid systems have emerged as promising candidates for topological qubits. In our work, we show that introducing a domain wall into a chain with anisotropic superconducting correlations provides a powerful way to control both the number and the nature of these boundary modes. The defect acts as a digital knob: its presence or absence flips the parity of zero modes and thus decides whether an isolated Majorana exists at the chain ends. This on/off mechanism is significantly more robust and simpler than fine-tuning global parameters such as chemical potential or hopping amplitudes. Moreover, anisotropy provides an additional lever to calibrate the effect of the defect, opening a pathway to architectures where topological qubits can be locally addressed by domain walls. This proposal reframes defects not as imperfections, but as useful resources for quantum information and computation.

Title: Linear and Nonlinear Optical Properties of SiO$_2$/TiO$_2$ Heterostructures Grown by Plasma Enhanced Atomic Layer Deposition
Authors: Jinsong Liu, Martin Mičulka, Raihan Rafi, Sebastian Beer, Denys Sevriukov, Stefan Nolte, Sven Schröder, Andreas Tünnermann, Isabelle Staude, Adriana Szeghalmi
Abstract: Second harmonic (SH) radiation can only be generated in non-centrosymmetric bulk crystals under the electric-dipole approximation. Nonlinear thin films made from bulk crystals are technologically challenging because of complex and high temperature fabrication processes. In this work, heterostructures made of amorphous materials SiO$_2$ and TiO$_2$ were prepared by a CMOS-compatible technique named plasma enhanced atomic layer deposition (PEALD) with deposition temperature at 100 °C. By using the uniaxial dispersion model, we characterized the form-birefringence properties, which can enable the phase matching condition in waveguides or other nonlinear optical applications. By applying a fringe-based technique, we determined the largest diagonal component of the effective second-order bulk susceptibility $\chi_{zzz}^{(2)}$ = 1.30$\pm$0.13 pm/V at a wavelength of 1032 nm. Noteworthy, we observed strong SH signals from two-component nanolaminates, which are several orders of magnitude larger than from single layers. The SH signals from our samples only require the broken inversion symmetry at the interface. Here optical properties of nanocomposites can be precisely tuned by the promising PEALD technology.

Title: Programmable Assembly of Ground State Fermionic Tweezer Arrays
Authors: Naman Jain, Jin Zhang, Marcus Culemann, Philipp M. Preiss
Abstract: We demonstrate deterministic preparation of arbitrary two-component product states of fermionic $^6$Li atoms in an 8$\times$8 optical tweezer array, achieving motional ground-state fidelities above $98.5\,\%$. Leveraging the large differential magnetic moments for spin-resolution, with parallelized site- and number-resolved control, our approach addresses key challenges for low-entropy quantum state engineering. Combined with high-fidelity spin-, site-, and density-resolved readout within a single $20\,\mathrm{\mu s}$ exposure, and $3\,\mathrm{s}$ experimental cycles, these advances establish a fast, scalable, and programmable architecture for fermionic quantum simulation.

Title: A Generation Framework with Strict Constraints for Crystal Materials Design
Authors: Chao Huang, Jiahui Chen, Chen Chen, Chen Chen, Chunyan Chen, Renjie Su, Shiyu Du
Abstract: The design of crystal materials plays a critical role in areas such as new energy development, biomedical engineering, and semiconductors. Recent advances in data-driven methods have enabled the generation of diverse crystal structures. However, most existing approaches still rely on random sampling without strict constraints, requiring multiple post-processing steps to identify stable candidates with the desired physical and chemical properties. In this work, we present a new constrained generation framework that takes multiple constraints as input and enables the generation of crystal structures with specific chemical and properties. In this framework, intermediate constraints, such as symmetry information and composition ratio, are generated by a constraint generator based on large language models (LLMs), which considers the target properties. These constraints are then used by a subsequent crystal structure generator to ensure that the structure generation process is under control. Our method generates crystal structures with a probability of meeting the target properties that is more than twice that of existing approaches. Furthermore, nearly 100% of the generated crystals strictly adhere to predefined chemical composition, eliminating the risks of supply chain during production.

Title: State-space kinetic Ising model reveals task-dependent entropy flow in sparsely active nonequilibrium neuronal dynamics
Authors: Ken Ishihara, Hideaki Shimazaki
Abstract: Neuronal ensemble activity, including coordinated and oscillatory patterns, exhibits hallmarks of nonequilibrium systems with time-asymmetric trajectories to maintain their organization. However, assessing time asymmetry from neuronal spiking activity remains challenging. The kinetic Ising model provides a framework for studying the causal, nonequilibrium dynamics in spiking recurrent neural networks. Recent theoretical advances in this model have enabled time-asymmetry estimation from large-scale steady-state data. Yet, neuronal activity often exhibits time-varying firing rates and coupling strengths, violating the steady-state assumption. To overcome this limitation, we developed a state-space kinetic Ising model that accounts for nonstationary and nonequilibrium properties of neural systems. This approach incorporates a mean-field method for estimating time-varying entropy flow, a key measure for maintaining the system's organization through dissipation. Applying this method to mouse visual cortex data revealed greater variability in causal couplings during task engagement despite reduced neuronal activity with increased sparsity. Moreover, higher-performing mice exhibited increased coupling-related entropy flow per spike during task engagement, suggesting more efficient computation in the higher-performing mice. These findings underscore the model's utility in uncovering intricate asymmetric causal dynamics in neuronal ensembles and linking them to behavior through the thermodynamic underpinnings of neural computation.

Title: Nonstabilizerness dynamics in many-body localized systems
Authors: Pedro R. Nicácio Falcão, Piotr Sierant, Jakub Zakrzewski, Emanuele Tirrito
Abstract: Nonstabilizerness, also known as ``magic'', quantifies the deviation of quantum states from stabilizer states, capturing the complexity necessary for quantum computational advantage. In this study, we investigate the dynamics of nonstabilizerness in disordered many-body localized (MBL) systems using the stabilizer Rényi entropy (SRE). Leveraging a phenomenological description based on the $\ell$-bit model, we analytically and numerically demonstrate that interactions profoundly influence nonstabilizerness spreading, inducing a power-law growth of SRE that markedly contrasts with the rapid saturation observed in ergodic systems. We validate our theoretical predictions through numerical simulations of the disordered transverse-field Ising model, showing excellent agreement across various disorder strengths, system sizes, and initial states. Additionally, we uncover a universal relationship between SRE and entanglement entropy, revealing their common scaling in the MBL regime independent of disorder strength and system size. Our results offer critical insights into the interplay of disorder, interactions, and complexity in quantum many-body systems.

Title: Application-specific machine-learned interatomic potentials: exploring the trade-off between DFT convergence, MLIP expressivity, and computational cost
Authors: Ilgar Baghishov, Jan Janssen, Graeme Henkelman, Danny Perez
Abstract: Machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are revolutionizing computational materials science and chemistry by offering an efficient alternative to {\em ab initio} molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. However, fitting high-quality MLIPs remains a challenging, time-consuming, and computationally intensive task where numerous trade-offs have to be considered, e.g., How much and what kind of atomic configurations should be included in the training set? Which level of {\em ab initio} convergence should be used to generate the training set? Which loss function should be used for fitting the MLIP? Which machine learning architecture should be used to train the MLIP? The answers to these questions significantly impact both the computational cost of MLIP training and the accuracy and computational cost of subsequent MLIP MD simulations. In this study, we use a configurationally diverse beryllium dataset and quadratic spectral neighbor analysis potential. We demonstrate that joint optimization of energy versus force weights, training set selection strategies, and convergence settings of the {\em ab initio} reference simulations, as well as model complexity can lead to a significant reduction in the overall computational cost associated with training and evaluating MLIPs. This opens the door to computationally efficient generation of high-quality MLIPs for a range of applications which demand different accuracy versus training and evaluation cost trade-offs.

Title: Geometric Regularity in Deterministic Sampling Dynamics of Diffusion-based Generative Models
Authors: Defang Chen, Zhenyu Zhou, Can Wang, Siwei Lyu
Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models employ stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and their equivalent probability flow ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to establish a smooth transformation between complex high-dimensional data distributions and tractable prior distributions. In this paper, we reveal a striking geometric regularity in the deterministic sampling dynamics of diffusion generative models: each simulated sampling trajectory along the gradient field lies within an extremely low-dimensional subspace, and all trajectories exhibit an almost identical boomerang shape, regardless of the model architecture, applied conditions, or generated content. We characterize several intriguing properties of these trajectories, particularly under closed-form solutions based on kernel-estimated data modeling. We also demonstrate a practical application of the discovered trajectory regularity by proposing a dynamic programming-based scheme to better align the sampling time schedule with the underlying trajectory structure. This simple strategy requires minimal modification to existing deterministic numerical solvers, incurs negligible computational overhead, and achieves superior image generation performance, especially in regions with only 5 - 10 function evaluations.

Authors: Samad Hajinazar, Eva Zurek
Abstract: Version 14 of XtalOpt, an evolutionary multi-objective global optimization algorithm for crystal structure prediction, is now available for download from its official website this https URL, and the Computer Physics Communications Library. The new version of the code is designed to perform a ground state search for crystal structures with variable compositions by integrating a suite of ab initio methods alongside classical and machine-learning potentials for structural relaxation. The multi-objective search framework has been enhanced through the introduction of Pareto optimization, enabling efficient discovery of functional materials. Herein, we describe the newly implemented methodologies, provide detailed instructions for their use, and present an overview of additional improvements included in the latest version of the code.

Title: Proof of a perfect platonic representation hypothesis
Authors: Liu Ziyin, Isaac Chuang
Abstract: In this note, we elaborate on and explain in detail the proof given by Ziyin et al. (2025) of the ``perfect" Platonic Representation Hypothesis (PRH) for the embedded deep linear network model (EDLN). We show that if trained with the stochastic gradient descent (SGD), two EDLNs with different widths and depths and trained on different data will become Perfectly Platonic, meaning that every possible pair of layers will learn the same representation up to a rotation. Because most of the global minima of the loss function are not Platonic, that SGD only finds the perfectly Platonic solution is rather extraordinary. The proof also suggests at least six ways the PRH can be broken. We also show that in the EDLN model, the emergence of the Platonic representations is due to the same reason as the emergence of progressive sharpening. This implies that these two seemingly unrelated phenomena in deep learning can, surprisingly, have a common cause. Overall, the theory and proof highlight the importance of understanding emergent "entropic forces" due to the irreversibility of SGD training and their role in representation learning. The goal of this note is to be instructive while avoiding jargon and lengthy technical details.

Title: Size-Dependent Skin Effect Transitions in Weakly Coupled Non-Reciprocal Chains
Authors: Yixuan Li, Linhu Li, Zhihao Xu
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems exhibit unique boundary phenomena absent in their Hermitian counterparts, most notably the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE). In this work, we explore a lattice model consisting of two coupled non-reciprocal chains, focusing on the interplay between system size, inter-chain coupling, and spectral topology. Using both analytical and numerical approaches, we systematically examine the evolution of the complex energy spectra and spectral winding numbers under periodic and open boundary conditions. Our results uncover a variety of size-dependent localization transitions, including the emergence and instability of concurrent bipolar skin effects in the $W=0$ region, and their crossover to unipolar and conventional bipolar NHSE as the system size increases. Notably, we demonstrate that these size-dependent behaviors persist even beyond the weak-coupling regime, highlighting their universality in non-Hermitian systems with complex spectral structures. This study provides insights into the mechanisms governing skin effects and offers practical guidelines for engineering non-Hermitian topological phases in synthetic lattices.

Title: Epidemic threshold and localization of the SIS model on directed complex networks
Authors: Vinícius B. Müller, Fernando L. Metz
Abstract: We study the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model on directed complex networks within the quenched mean-field approximation. Combining results from random matrix theory with an analytic approach to the distribution of fixed-point infection probabilities, we derive the phase diagram and show that the model exhibits a nonequilibrium phase transition between the absorbing and endemic phases for $c \geq \lambda^{-1}$, where $c$ is the mean degree and $\lambda$ the average infection rate. Interestingly, the critical line is independent of the degree distribution but is highly sensitive to the form of the infection-rate distribution. We further show that the inverse participation ratio of infection probabilities diverges near the epidemic threshold, indicating that the disease may become localized on a small fraction of nodes. These results provide a systematic characterization of how network heterogeneities shape epidemic spreading on directed contact networks within the quenched mean-field approximation.

Authors: Ekaterina S. Lebedeva, Maxim Mazanov, Alexey V. Kavokin, Maxim A. Gorlach
Abstract: Certain topological systems with time-varying Hamiltonian enable quantized and disorder-robust transport of excitations. Here, we introduce the modification of the celebrated Thouless pump when the on-site energies remain fixed, while the nearest and next-nearest neighbor couplings vary in time. We demonstrate quantized transport of excitations and propose an experimental implementation using an array of evanescently coupled optical waveguides.

Title: Effective Dynamics for Weakly Interacting Bosons in an Iterated High-Density Thermodynamic Limit
Authors: Daniele Ferretti, Kalle Koskinen
Abstract: We study the time evolution of weakly interacting Bose gases on a three-dimensional torus of arbitrary volume. The coupling constant is supposed to be inversely proportional to the density, which is considered to be large and independent of the particle number. We take into account a class of initial states exhibiting quasi-complete Bose-Einstein condensation. For each fixed time in a finite interval, we prove the convergence of the one-particle reduced density matrix towards the projection onto the normalised order parameter describing the condensate - evolving according to the Hartree equation - in the iterated limit where the volume (and therefore the particle number), and subsequently the density go to infinity. The rate of convergence depends only on the density and on the decay of both the expected number of particles and the energy of the initial quasi-vacuum state.

This framework extends fluctuational electrodynamics beyond equilibrium by incorporating nonstationary correlations and memory effects induced by temporal modulation. Closed-form expressions for the heat currents in modulated many-body systems are obtained, together with a generalized Landauer-like formulation of the pairwise exchanges, where the transmission coefficient accounts for all inelastic frequency-conversion channels. Near-resonant modulation redistributes and amplifies thermal fluctuations across Floquet sidebands, acting as a parametric amplifier of thermal radiation and enabling active, frequency-selective control of nanoscale heat transfer.

Abstract: Tunable Josephson harmonics open new avenues for qubit design. We demonstrate a superconducting circuit element consisting of a tunnel junction in series with a SQUID loop, yielding a Josephson potential whose harmonic content is strongly tunable by magnetic flux. Through spectroscopy of the first four qubit transitions, together with an effective single-mode model renormalized by the internal mode, we resolve a second harmonic with an amplitude up to $\sim10\%$ of the fundamental. We identify a flux sweet spot where the dispersive shift vanishes, achieved by balancing the dispersive couplings to the internal and qubit modes. This highly tunable element provides a route toward protected qubits and customizable nonlinear microwave devices.

Title: Functional Percolation: A Perspective on Criticality of Form and Function
Authors: Galen J. Wilkerson
Abstract: Understanding the physical constraints and minimal conditions that enable information processing in extended systems remains a central challenge across disciplines, from neuroscience and artificial intelligence to social and physical networks. Here we study how network connectivity both limits and enables information processing by analyzing random networks across the structural percolation transition. Using cascade-mediated dynamics as a minimal and universal mechanism for propagating state-dependent responses, we examine structural, functional, and information-theoretic observables as functions of mean degree in Erdos-Renyi networks. We find that the emergence of a giant connected component coincides with a sharp transition in realizable information processing: complex input-output response functions become accessible, functional diversity increases rapidly, output entropy rises, and directed information flow quantified by transfer entropy extends beyond local neighborhoods. These coincident transitions define a regime of functional percolation, referring to a sharp expansion of the space of realizable input-output functions at the structural percolation transition. Near criticality, networks exhibit a Pareto-optimal tradeoff between functional complexity and diversity, suggesting that percolation criticality provides a universal organizing principle for information processing in systems with local interactions and propagating influences.

Title: Meta-learning three-factor plasticity rules for structured credit assignment with sparse feedback
Authors: Dimitra Maoutsa
Abstract: Biological neural networks learn complex behaviors from sparse, delayed feedback using local synaptic plasticity, yet the mechanisms enabling structured credit assignment remain elusive. In contrast, artificial recurrent networks solving similar tasks typically rely on biologically implausible global learning rules or hand-crafted local updates. The space of local plasticity rules capable of supporting learning from delayed reinforcement remains largely unexplored. Here, we present a meta-learning framework that discovers local learning rules for structured credit assignment in recurrent networks trained with sparse feedback. Our approach interleaves local neo-Hebbian-like updates during task execution with an outer loop that optimizes plasticity parameters via \textbf{tangent-propagation through learning}. The resulting three-factor learning rules enable long-timescale credit assignment using only local information and delayed rewards, offering new insights into biologically grounded mechanisms for learning in recurrent circuits.
