Title: A mechanism for ice growth on the surface of a spherical water droplet
Authors: Yang Li, Prachi Parashar, Iver Brevik, Clas Persson, I. Malyi, Mathias Boström
Abstract: The formation and growth of ice particles, particularly on the surfaces of spherical water droplets, bear profound implications for localized weather systems and global climate. Herein, we develop a theoretical framework for ice nucleation on minuscule water droplets, establishing that $10\sim5000\rm\ nm$ droplets can considerably increase in volume, making a substantial contribution to ice formation within mist, fog, or even cloud systems. We reveal that the Casimir-Lifshitz (van der Waals) interaction within these systems is robust enough to stimulate both water and ice growth on the surfaces of ice-cold spherical water droplets. The significant impacts and possible detectable phenomena from the curvature are demonstrated.

Title: Compositionally Grading Alloy Stacking Fault Energy using Autonomous Path Planning and Additive Manufacturing with Elemental Powders
Authors: James Hanagan, Nicole Person, Daniel Salas, Marshall Allen, Wenle Xu, Daniel Lewis, Brady Butler, James D. Paramore, George Pharr, Ibrahim Karaman, Raymundo Arroyave
Abstract: Compositionally graded alloys (CGAs) are often proposed for use in structural components where the combination of two or more alloys within a single part can yield substantial enhancement in performance and functionality. For these applications, numerous design methodologies have been developed, one of the most sophisticated being the application of path planning algorithms originally designed for robotics to solve CGA design problems. In addition to the traditional application to structural components, this work proposes and demonstrates the application of this CGA design framework to rapid alloy design, synthesis, and characterization. A composition gradient in the CoCrFeNi alloy space was planned between the maximum and minimum stacking fault energy (SFE) as predicted by a previously developed model in a face-centered cubic (FCC) high entropy alloy (HEA) space. The path was designed to be monotonic in SFE and avoid regions that did not meet FCC phase fraction and solidification range constraints predicted by CALculation of PHAse Diagrams (CALPHAD). Compositions from the path were selected to produce a linear gradient in SFE, and the CGA was built using laser directed energy deposition (L-DED). The resulting gradient was characterized for microstructure and mechanical properties, including hardness, elastic modulus, and strain rate sensitivity. Despite being predicted to contain a single FCC phase throughout the gradient, part of the CGA underwent a martensitic transformation, thereby demonstrating a limitation of using equilibrium CALPHAD calculations for phase stability predictions. More broadly, this demonstrates the ability of the methods employed to bring attention to blind spots in alloy models.

Title: Accelerated Fatigue Strength Prediction via Additive Manufactured Functionally Graded Materials and High-Throughput Plasticity Quantification
Authors: C. Bean, M. Calvat, Y. Nie, R.L Black, N. Velisavljevic, D. Anjaria, M.A. Charpagne, J. C. Stinville
Abstract: Recent improvements in additive manufacturing and high-throughput material synthesis have enabled the discovery of novel metallic materials for extreme environments. However, high-fidelity testing of advanced mechanical properties such as fatigue strength, has often been the most time-consuming and resource-intensive step of material discovery, thereby slowing down the adoption of novel materials. This work presents a new method for rapid characterization of the fatigue properties of many compositions while only testing a single specimen. The approach utilizes high-resolution digital image correlation along with a computer vision model to extract the relationship between localized plastic deformation events and associated mechanical properties. The approach is initially validated on an additive manufactured 316L dataset, then applied to a functionally graded additive manufactured specimen with a composition gradient across the gauge length. This allows for the characterization of multiple compositions, orders of magnitude faster than traditional methods.

Title: Cartesian Nodal Lines and Magnetic Kramers Weyl Nodes in Spin-Split Antiferromagnets
Authors: Zheng-Yang Zhuang, Di Zhu, Zhigang Wu, Zhongbo Yan
Abstract: When band degeneracy occurs in a spin-split band structure, it gives rise to divergent Berry curvature and distinctive topological boundary states, resulting in a variety of fascinating effects. We show that three-dimensional spin-split antiferromagnets, characterized by symmetry-constrained momentum-dependent spin splitting and zero net magnetization, can host two unique forms of symmetry-protected band degeneracy: Cartesian nodal lines in the absence of spin-orbit coupling, and magnetic Kramers Weyl nodes when spin-orbit coupling is present. Remarkably, these band degeneracies not only produce unique patterns of Berry-curvature distributions but also give rise to topological boundary states with unconventional spin textures. Furthermore, we find that these band degeneracies can lead to strong or even quantized anomalous Hall effects and quantized circular photogalvanic effects under appropriate conditions. Our study suggests that spin-split antiferromagnets provide a fertile ground for exploring unconventional topological phases.

Title: Triangular lattice models of the Kalmeyer-Laughlin spin liquid from coupled wires
Authors: Tingyu Gao, Niklas Tausendpfund, Erik L. Weerda, Matteo Rizzi, David F. Mross
Abstract: Chiral spin liquids (CSLs) are exotic phases of interacting spins in two dimensions, characterized by long-range entanglement and fractional excitations. We construct a local Hamiltonian on the triangular lattice that stabilizes the Kalmeyer-Laughlin CSL without requiring fine-tuning. Our approach employs coupled-wire constructions and introduces a lattice duality to construct a solvable chiral sliding Luttinger liquid, which is driven towards the CSL phase by generic perturbations. By combining symmetry analysis and bosonization, we make sharp predictions for the ground states on quasi-one-dimensional cylinders and tori, which exhibit a four-fold periodicity in the circumference. Extensive tensor network simulations demonstrating ground state degeneracies, fractional quasi-particles, non-vanishing long-range order parameters, and entanglement signatures confirm the emergence of the CSL in the lattice Hamiltonian.

Title: Intelligent Soft Matter: Towards Embodied Intelligence

Abstract: Intelligent soft matter stands at the intersection of materials science, physics, and cognitive science, promising to change how we design and interact with materials. This transformative field seeks to create materials that possess life-like capabilities, such as perception, learning, memory, and adaptive behavior. Unlike traditional materials, which typically perform static or predefined functions, intelligent soft matter dynamically interacts with its environment. It integrates multiple sensory inputs, retains experiences, and makes decisions to optimize its responses. Inspired by biological systems, these materials intend to leverage the inherent properties of soft matter: flexibility, self-evolving, and responsiveness to perform functions that mimic cognitive processes. By synthesizing current research trends and projecting their evolution, we present a forward-looking perspective on how intelligent soft matter could be constructed, with the aim of inspiring innovations in fields such as biomedical devices, adaptive robotics, and beyond. We highlight new pathways for integrating design of sensing, memory and action with internal low-power operations and discuss challenges for practical implementation of materials with "intelligent behavior". These approaches outline a path towards to more robust, versatile and scalable materials that can potentially act, compute, and "think" by their inherent intrinsic material behaviour beyond traditional smart technologies relying on external control.

Title: Entropy of spatial network with applications to non-extensive statistical mechanics
Authors: O.K. Kazemi, S.M. Taheri
Abstract: A new method is proposed for analyzing complexity and studying the information in random geometric networks using Tsallis entropy tool. Tsallis entropy of the ensemble of random geometric networks is calculated based on the components of the random connection model on the point process which is obtained by connecting the points with a probability that depends on their relative positions (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.indag.2022.05.002, 2022). According to information theory and conditional discussion, the bounds for Shannon and Tsallis entropies of the ensemble of this random graph are presented. Using this function and Lagrange's formula, the connection function that provides the maximum Tsallis entropy based on general constraints is obtained. Then, a simulation-based example is presented to clarify the application of the proposed method in the study of ad hoc wireless networks. By observing the obtained results, it can be stated that the wireless networks that adhere to the model studied here are almost maximally complex. Also, Tsallis conditional entropy maximizing function is compared with other connection functions using numerical calculations and the optimal value for the maximization of conditional entropies is obtained.

Title: Asynchronous mass inversion enriched quantum anomalous Hall states in multilayer graphene
Authors: Xilin Feng, Zi-Ting Sun, K.T.Law
Abstract: Recently, multilayer graphene systems have attracted significant attention due to the discovery of a variety of intriguing phases, particularly quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) states. In rhombohedral pentalayer graphene, both $C = -5$ and $C = -3$ QAH states have been observed. While the $C = -5$ QAH state is well understood, the origin of the $C = -3$ QAH state remains unclear. In this letter, we propose that the $C = -3$ QAH state in rhombohedral pentalayer graphene (RPG) arises from an asynchronous mass inversion mechanism, driven by the interplay between trigonal warping and staggered layer order under an applied displacement field. Trigonal warping splits the low-energy bands into a central touching point and three "leg" Dirac cones. In the presence of staggered layer order, this splitting enables mass inversions driven by the displacement field to occur asynchronously at the central touching point and the "leg" Dirac cones, potentially leading to the formation of the $C = -3$ QAH state. Furthermore, this mechanism can also be applied to Bernal multilayer graphene systems, predicting the existence of additional QAH states beyond $C = \pm N, \pm 2N$ for $N$-layer graphene.

Title: Cove-edged Chiral Graphene Nanoribbons with Chirality-Dependent Bandgap and Carrier Mobility
Authors: K. Liu, W. Zheng, S. Osella, Z. Qiu, S. Böckmann, W. Niu, L. Meingast, H. Komber, S. Obermann, R. Gillen, M. Bonn, M. R. Hansen, J. Maultzsch, H. I. Wang, J. Ma, X. Feng
Abstract: Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) have garnered significant interest due to their highly customizable physicochemical properties and potential utility in nanoelectronics. Besides controlling widths and edge structures, the inclusion of chirality in GNRs brings another dimension for fine-tuning their optoelectronic properties, but related studies remain elusive owing to the absence of feasible synthetic strategies. Here, we demonstrate a novel class of cove-edged chiral GNRs (CcGNRs) with a tunable chiral vector (n,m). Notably, the bandgap and effective mass of (n,2)- CcGNR show a distinct positive correlation with the increasing value of n, as indicated by theory. Within this GNR family, two representative members, namely, (4,2)- CcGNR and (6,2)-CcGNR, are successfully synthesized. Both CcGNRs exhibit prominently curved geometries arising from the incorporated [4]helicene motifs along their peripheries, as also evidenced by the single-crystal structures of the two respective model compounds (1 and 2). The chemical identities and optoelectronic properties of (4,2)- and (6,2)-CcGNRs are comprehensively investigated via a combination of IR, Raman, solid-state NMR, UV-vis, and THz spectroscopies as well as theoretical calculations. In line with theoretical expectation, the obtained (6,2)-CcGNR possesses a low optical bandgap of 1.37 eV along with charge carrier mobility of 8 cm2/Vs, whereas (4,2)-CcGNR exhibits a narrower bandgap of 1.26 eV with increased mobility of 14 cm2/Vs. This work opens up a new avenue to precisely engineer the bandgap and carrier mobility of GNRs by manipulating their chiral vector.

Title: Evidence of Replica Symmetry Breaking under the Nishimori conditions in epidemic inference on graphs
Authors: Alfredo Braunstein, Louise Budzynski, Matteo Mariani, Federico Ricci-Tersenghi
Abstract: In Bayesian inference, computing the posterior distribution from the data is typically a non-trivial problem, which usually requires approximations such as mean-field approaches or numerical methods, like the Monte Carlo Markov Chain. Being a high-dimensional distribution over a set of correlated variables, the posterior distribution can undergo the notorious replica symmetry breaking transition. When it happens, several mean-field methods and virtually every Monte Carlo scheme can not provide a reasonable approximation to the posterior and its marginals. Replica symmetry is believed to be guaranteed whenever the data is generated with known prior and likelihood distributions, namely under the so-called Nishimori conditions. In this paper, we break this belief, by providing a counter-example showing that, under the Nishimori conditions, replica symmetry breaking arises. Introducing a simple, geometrical model that can be thought of as a patient zero retrieval problem in a highly infectious regime of the epidemic Susceptible-Infectious model, we show that under the Nishimori conditions, there is evidence of replica symmetry breaking. We achieve this result by computing the instability of the replica symmetric cavity method toward the one step replica symmetry broken phase. The origin of this phenomenon -- replica symmetry breaking under the Nishimori conditions -- is likely due to the correlated disorder appearing in the epidemic models.

Title: Probing Structural Dynamics in Photocatalytic Water Splitting: X-ray vs. Neutron Scattering
Authors: Zhihao Shen
Abstract: Photocatalytic water splitting represents a pivotal pathway for converting solar energy into chemical energy, with the core challenge lying in the design and optimization of photocatalysts [1] . TiO2, as a quintessential photocatalytic material, undergoes significant alterations in its electronic and crystalline structures under intense light irradiation, which may directly impacts its photocatalytic efficiency [2] . To gain a profound understanding of these transformations, in situ characterization techniques such as X-ray scattering and neutron scattering have emerged as crucial tools. This paper, from a combined perspective of theoretical computation and experimental characterization, explores the differential capabilities of X-ray scattering and neutron scattering in characterizing the pair distribution function (PDF) of materials during photocatalytic water splitting. Furthermore, through simulation calculations, it aims to unveil the changes in the electronic and crystalline structures under intense light irradiation. This initial draft of the paper is subject to subsequent revisions.

Title: Violation of Pauli Limit at KTaO3(110) Interfaces
Authors: Samuel J. Poage, Xueshi Gao, Merve Baksi, Salva Salmani-Rezaie, David A. Muller, Divine P. Kumah, Chun Ning Lau, Jose Lorenzana, Maria N. Gastiasoro, Kaveh Ahadi
Abstract: The superconducting order parameter at the KTaO3 interfaces and its dependence on interface orientation remains a subject of debate. The superconductivity at these interfaces exhibits strong resilience against in-plane magnetic field and violates Pauli limit. The interface orientation dependence of critical field and violation of Pauli limit, however, have not been investigated. To address this problem, we grew epitaxial LaMnO3/KTaO3 heterostructures using molecular beam epitaxy. We show that superconductivity is extremely robust against the in-plane magnetic field. Our results indicate that the interface orientation, despite impacting the critical temperature, does not affect the ratio of critical field to the Pauli limiting field. These results offer opportunities to engineer superconductors which are resilient against magnetic field.

Title: An unusual first order phase transition in a 2D superconductor
Authors: Noah J. Jabusch, Emmanouil K. Kokkinis, Andrey V. Chubukov
Abstract: We consider a superconductor under external perturbation, which forces Cooper pairs to develop with a finite total momentum $q$. The condensation energy of such a state decreases with $q$ and vanishes at a critical $q_c$. We analyze how superconducting order evolves at $ q \approx q_c$. In 3D, the result is well-known: the pairing susceptibility diverges at $q = q_c +0$, and the gap amplitude $\Delta (q)$ gradually increases as $q$ decreases below $q_c$ and reaches its largest value $\Delta_0$ at $q=0$. In 2D, we find different behavior. Namely, for a parabolic dispersion, the pairing susceptibility also diverges at $q = q_c +0$, but at $q = q_c -0$, the gap amplitude jumps to the maximal $\Delta_0$ and remains equal to it for all $q <q_c$. For a non-parabolic dispersion $\varepsilon_{k}= c k^{2\alpha}$, we find that for $\alpha>1$ the transition becomes second-order, but the gap evolution is rather sharp, whereas for $\alpha<1$ it becomes first-order, but $\Delta (q)$ is non-monotonic. This is similar, but not identical, to the behavior of magnetization near a Stoner transition in 2D.

Title: Uniaxial Pressure Effects, Phase Diagram, and Tricritical Point in the Centrosymmetric Skyrmion Lattice Magnet GdRu$_2$Si$_2$
Authors: L. Gries, T. Kleinbeck, D. A. Mayoh, G. D. A. Wood, G. Balakrishnan, R. Klingeler
Abstract: The magnetic phase diagram, magnetoelastic coupling, and uniaxial pressure effects of centrosymmetric magnetic skyrmion-hosting GdRu$_2$Si$_2$ are investigated by means of high-resolution capacitance dilatometry in fields up to 15\,T supported by specific heat and magnetisation studies. In addition to the previously reported phases in the $H$-$T$ phase diagram, we observe a third antiferromagnetic phase in zero magnetic field. We present the magnetic phase diagram and find two unreported phases, one of which features a comparably giant uniaxial pressure dependence. Our dilatometric measurements show magnetoelastic effects associated with the various magnetic ordering phenomena. We determine the uniaxial pressure dependencies of the various phases, in particular of the skyrmion lattice phase which is enhanced at higher fields and temperatures and also widens at a rate of 0.07~T/GPa when uniaxial pressure is applied along the $c$ axis. The relevance of fluctuations is further highlighted by the presence of tricritical point indicated by our thermodynamic data at the phase boundary separating two double-\textit{Q} magnetic configurations between which the skyrmion pocket phase evolves upon further cooling.

Title: Enhancing Electrical Properties of Selectively Grown In-Plane InAs Nanowires using InGaAs Buffer and Capping Layers
Authors: Pradip Adhikari, Anjali Rathore, Dayrl P Briggs, Srijanto R Bernadeta, Joon Sue Lee
Abstract: In-plane semiconductor nanowires with complex branched geometries, prepared via selective area growth (SAG), offer a versatile platform for advanced electronics, optoelectronics, and quantum devices. However, defects and disorder at the interfaces and top surfaces of the nanowires can significantly degrade their electrical properties. One effective method to mitigate these issues is the incorporation of buffer and capping layers. In this work, we achieved a wider growth selectivity window of InGaAs in the presence of atomic hydrogen (H) and employed it as buffer and capping layers for SAG InAs nanowires to enhance their electrical properties. Hall measurements on InAs nanowires, with and without InGaAs buffer and/or capping layers, revealed that incorporating closely lattice-matched InGaAs buffer and capping layers to InAs nanowires nearly tripled the electron mobility and doubled the phase coherence length compared to nanowires without these layers. These findings demonstrate that the use of InGaAs buffer and capping layers is a crucial strategy for significantly enhancing the quality of InAs nanowires, unlocking their full potential for high performance electronics and quantum devices.

Title: Transparent Graphene-Superconductor Interfaces: Quantum Hall and Zero Field Regimes
Authors: Alexey Bondarev, Gu Zhang, Harold U. Baranger
Abstract: We study clean, edge-contacted graphene/superconductor interfaces in both the quantum Hall (QH) and zero field regimes. We find that Andreev reflection is substantially stronger than at an interface with a semiconductor two-dimensional electron gas: the large velocity at graphene's conical Dirac points makes the requirement of current continuity to a metal much less restrictive. In both our tight-binding and continuum models, we find a wide range of parameters for which Andreev reflection is strong. For a transparent interface, we demonstrate the following for graphene in the lowest Landau level QH state: (i) Excellent electron-hole hybridization occurs: the electron and hole components in graphene are simply related by an exchange of sublattice. The spatial profile for the electron component is predominantly gaussian on one sublattice and peaked at the interface, and so very different from the QH edge state of a terminated lattice. (ii) The degree of hybridization is independent of the graphene filling: no fine-tuning is needed. (iii) The spectrum is valley degenerate: the dispersion of each chiral Andreev edge mode (CAEM) self-aligns to be antisymmetric about the center of each valley, independent of filling. Achieving a transparent interface requires the absence of any barrier as well as a superconductor that is suitably matched to graphene; we argue that the latter condition is not very stringent. We further consider the effect of reduced transparency and Zeeman splitting on both the wavefunctions of the CAEM and their dispersion.

Title: The Effect of Water Contamination on the Aging of a Dual-Carbon Lithium-Ion Capacitor Employing LiFSI-Based Electrolyte
Authors: Philipp Schweigart, Johan Hamonnet, Obinna Egwu Eleri, Laura King, Samson Yuxiu Lai, Ann Mari Svensson
Abstract: Fabricating electrochemical energy storage devices demands significant energy for drying cell components to ensure optimal performance. The development of new, water-tolerant materials would represent a tremendous advance in cost savings and sustainability. Although it is generally established that water deteriorates cell performance, there are few systematic studies on the maximum amount of tolerable water contamination, and most of the studies employed the electrolyte salt $\mathrm{LiPF_6}$, which inevitably decomposes upon exposure to humidity. In this work, the potential of using the non-hydrolyzing salt LiFSI is explored with respect to its performance in Li-ion capacitor cells based on activated carbon (AC) and pre-lithiated graphite (Gr). Water is deliberately added in various amounts (950, 2300, and 6000 ppm), and its effect on the electrochemical performance and aging of AC and Gr electrodes is systematically studied. While the addition of 950 ppm water has no evident impact on capacity retention (96% after 2000 cycles), the addition of 2300 ppm water or 6000 ppm water shows a distinct capacity fade, attributed to a significant loss of lithium inventory and increased resistivity due to irreversible reactions of the water with lithiated Gr. Post-mortem analysis reveals that water promotes the oxidative and reductive decomposition of LiFSI on AC and lithiated Gr, respectively. A significant thickening of the SEI on Gr is observed as the water concentration is increased.

Title: Giant Topological Hall Effect Across Wide Temperature in Pt/NiCo2O4 Heterostructure
Authors: Bharat Giri, Ahsan Ullah, Jing Li, Bjorn Josteinsson, Zhewen Xu, Suvechhya Lamichhane, Adam Erickson, Arjun Subedi, Peter A Dowben, Gabriel Puebla Hellmann, Abdelghani Laraoui, Sy-Hwang Liou, Xiaoshan Xu
Abstract: Topological Hall effect (THE), a quantum phenomenon arising from emergent magnetic field generated by topological spin texture, is a key method for detecting non-coplanar spin structures like skyrmions in magnetic materials. Here, we investigate a bilayer structure of Pt and conducting ferrimagnet NiCo2O4 (NCO) of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and demonstrate giant THE across a temperature range 2 - 350 K. The absence of THE in single-layer Pt and NCO, as well as in Pt/Cu/NCO, suggests its interfacial origin. The maximum THE occurring just before the NCO coercive field indicates its connection to magnetic nucleation centers, which are topologically equivalent to skyrmions. The large normalized THE, based on the emergent-field model, points to a high population density of small nucleation centers. This aligns with the unresolvable domain structures during magnetization reversal, even though clear domain structures are detected after zero-field cooling. These results establish heavy metal/NCO as a promising system for exploring topological spin structures.

Title: Fluctuation-driven topological Hall effect in room-temperature itinerant helimagnet Fe3Ga4
Authors: Priya R. Baral, Victor Ukleev, Ivica Živković, Youngro Lee, Fabio Orlandi, Pascal Manuel, Yurii Skourski, Lukas Keller, Anne Stunault, J. Alberto Rodríguez-Velamazán, Robert Cubitt, Arnaud Magrez, Jonathan S. White, Igor I. Mazin, Oksana Zaharko
Abstract: The topological Hall effect (THE) is a hallmark of a non-trivial geometric spin arrangement in a magnetic metal, originating from a finite scalar spin chirality (SSC). The associated Berry phase is often a consequence of non-coplanar magnetic structures identified by multiple k-vectors. For single-k magnetic structures however with zero SSC, the emergence of a finite topological Hall signal presents a conceptual challenge. Here, we report that a fluctuation-driven mechanism involving chiral magnons is responsible for the observed THE in a low-symmetry compound, monoclinic Fe3Ga4. Through neutron scattering experiments, we discovered several nontrivial magnetic phases in this system. In our focus is the helical spiral phase at room temperature, which transforms into a transverse conical state in applied magnetic field, supporting a significant THE signal up to and above room temperature. Our work offers a fresh perspective in the search for novel materials with intertwined topological magnetic and transport properties.

Title: Heating of a semi-infinite Hooke chain
Authors: Sergei D. Liazhkov
Abstract: We consider unsteady ballistic heat transport in a semi-infinite Hooke chain with a free end and an arbitrary heat source. An analytical description of the evolution of the kinetic temperature is proposed in both discrete (exact) and continuum (approximate) formulations. The continualization of the discrete solution for kinetic temperature is performed through a large-time asymptotic estimate of the fundamental solution of the dynamical problem for the instantly perturbed conservative semi-infinite chain at the fronts of the incident and reflected thermal waves. By analyzing the continuum solution, we observe that any instantaneous heat supply (i.e., a heat pulse) results in the anti-localization of the reflected thermal wave. We demonstrate that sudden point heat supply leads to a transition to a non-equilibrium steady state, which, unexpectedly, may exist even in the non-dissipative case. The results of this paper are expected to provide insight into the continuum description of nanoscale heat transport.

Title: Carbon in GaN as a nonradiative recombination center
Authors: Fangzhou Zhao, Hongyi Guan, Mark E. Turiansky, Chris G. Van de Walle
Abstract: Trap-assisted nonradiative recombination has been shown to limit the efficiency of optoelectronic devices. While substitutional carbon ($\mathrm{C_N}$) has been suggested to be a nonradiative recombination center in GaN devices, a complete recombination cycle including the two charge-state transition levels has not been previously described. In this work, we investigate the trap-assisted recombination process due to $\mathrm{C_N}$ in GaN, including multiphonon emission (MPE), radiative recombination, trap-assisted Auger-Meitner (TAAM) recombination, as well as thermal emission of holes. Our study shows the key role of TAAM processes at the high carrier densities relevant for devices. We also reveal the carrier-density regimes where thermal emission and radiative recombination are expected to play an observable role. Our results highlight that carbon concentrations exceeding $\sim$10$^{17}$ cm$^{-3}$ can have a noticeable impact on device efficiency, not just in GaN active layers but also in InGaN and AlGaN. Our comprehensive formalism not only offers detailed results for carbon but provides a general framework for assessing the multiple processes that participate in trap-assisted recombination in semiconductors.

Title: Beyond Homes scaling: disorder, the Planckian bound and a new universality
Authors: D. M. Broun, Vivek Mishra, J. S. Dodge, P. J. Hirschfeld
Abstract: Beginning with high-$T_c$ cuprate materials, it has been observed that many superconductors exhibit so-called "Homes scaling", in which the zero-temperature superfluid density, $\rho_{s0}$, is proportional to the product of the normal-state dc conductivity and the superconducting transition temperature, $\sigma_\mathrm{dc} T_c$. For conventional, s-wave superconductors, such scaling has been shown to be a natural consequence of elastic-scattering disorder, not only in the extreme dirty limit but across a broad range of scattering parameters. Here we show that when an analogous calculation is carried out for elastic scattering in d-wave superconductors, a stark contrast emerges, with $\rho_{s0} \propto \left(\sigma_\mathrm{dc} T_c \right)^2$ in the dirty limit, in apparent violation of Homes scaling. Within a simple approximate Migdal--Eliashberg treatment of inelastic scattering, we show how Homes scaling is recovered. The normal-state behavior of near optimally doped cuprates is dominated by inelastic scattering, but significant deviations from Homes scaling occur for disorder-dominated cuprate systems, such as underdoped YBCO and overdoped LSCO, and in very clean materials with little inelastic scattering, such as Sr$_2$RuO$_4$. We present a revised analysis where both axes of the original Homes scaling plot are normalized by the Drude plasma weight, $\omega_{p,D}^2$, and show that new universal scaling emerges, in which the superfluid fractions of dirty s-wave and dirty d-wave superconductors coalesce to a single point at which normal-state scattering is occurring at the Planckian bound. The combined result is a new tool for classifying superconductors in terms of order parameter symmetry, as well as scattering strength and character. Although our model starts from a Fermi-liquid assumption it describes underdoped cuprates surprisingly well.

Title: Origin of the tiny energy gap and Dirac points in monoclinic trilayer nickelate La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$
Authors: Hu Zhang
Abstract: Superconductivity was recently found in trilayer nickelate La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ under high pressure with a phase transition from the monoclinic P2$_1$/a structure to the tetragonal I4/mmm structure. Previous experimental works have confirmed the existence of a tiny energy gap formed with Ni 3d$_{z^2}$ orbitals in monoclinic La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$. Here we investigate the physical origin of this gap by analyzing symmetry properties of energy bands based on the group theory. The tiny gap comes from energy bands with opposite parity at the Brillouin zone center. In addition, we also find previously unknown Dirac points in some momentum directions around the Fermi level. An effective Hamiltonian is constructed to describe low energy physics of the tiny energy gap and Dirac points. Due to the low crystal symmetry of monoclinic La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$, its energy bands display strong anisotropic properties.

Title: Enhancement of temperature of quantum anomalous Hall effect in two-dimensional germanene/magnetic semiconductor heterostructures
Authors: Qing-Han Yang, Jia-Wen Li, Xin-Wei Yi, Xiang Li, Jing-Yang You, Gang Su, Bo Gu
Abstract: Quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) is significant for future low-power electronics devices, where a main challenge is realizing QAHE at high temperatures. In this work, based on experimentally reported two-dimensional (2D) germanene and magnetic semiconductors Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ and Cr$_2$Si$_2$Te$_6$, and the first principle calculations, germanene/magnetic semiconductor heterostructures are investigated. Topologically nontrivial edge states and quantized anomalous Hall conductance are demonstrated. It is shown that the QAHE temperature can be enhanced to approximately 62 K in germanene/monolayer (ML) Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ with 2.1\% tensile strain, 64 K in germanene/bilayer (BL) Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ with 1.4\% tensile strain, and 50 K in germanene/ML Cr$_2$Si$_2$Te$_6$ with 1.3\% tensile strain. With increasing tensile strain of these heterostructures, the band gap decreases and the Curie temperature rises, and the highest temperature of QAHE is obtained. Since these 2D materials were discovered in recent experiments, our results provide promising materials for achieving high-temperature QAHE.

Title: Theoretical description of atomtronic Josephson junctions in an optical lattice
Authors: Manjari Gupta, H. R. Krishnamurthy, J. K. Freericks
Abstract: Experimental realizations of ``atomtronic" Josephson junctions have recently been created in annular traps in relative rotation with respect to potential barriers that generate the weak links. If these devices are additionally subjected to an optical lattice potential, then they can incorporate strong-coupling Mott physics within the design, which can modify the behavior and can allow for interesting new configurations of barriers and of superfluid flow patterns. We examine theoretically the behavior of a Bose superfluid in an optical lattice in the presence of an annular trap and a barrier across the annular region which acts as a Josephson junction. As the superfluid is rotated, circulating super-currents appear. Beyond a threshold superfluid velocity, phase slips develop, which generate vortices. We use a finite temperature strong-coupling expansion about the mean-field solution of the Bose Hubbard model to calculate various properties of such devices. In addition, we discuss some of the rich behavior that can result when there are Mott regions within the system.

Title: Asymptotic Freedom of Two Heavy Impurities in a Bose-Einstein Condensate
Authors: Dong-Chen Zheng, Lin Wen, Renyuan Liao
Abstract: We consider two heavy impurities immersed in a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), and calculate the self-energy using the Wilsonian renormalization. The polaron energy, quasiparticle residue and damping rate are extracted from the self-energy. We demonstrate that various effective potentials emerge from the polaron energy under corresponding conditions. In the limit of large separation between the impurities, the polaron spectrum converges to the results for a single impurity, exhibiting an attractive-repulsive crossover across the Feshbach resonance. The boundary of this crossover is identified through the analysis of the damping rate. We highlight that our analysis reveals a repulsive-dominant polaron exists as long as the impurities are sufficiently close, even when the impurity-boson interactions are attractive. Additionally, we observe that the two impurities become asymptotically free in the repulsive polaron regime. These results are verifiable and offer a fresh perspective on the interaction dynamics between two polarons.

Title: Tunable superconducting diode effect in higher-harmonic InSb nanosheet interferometers
Authors: Xingjun Wu, Ji-Yin Wang, Haitian Su, Shili Yan, Dong Pan, Jianhua Zhao, Po Zhang, H. Q. Xu
Abstract: Superconducting diodes, characterized by the nonreciprocal supercurrent flow, have gained significant attention for their potential in dissipationless electronics. This study presents a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) composed of two Al-InSb nanosheet Josephson junctions. Utilizing prepatterned local backgates, we achieve a gate- and flux-tunable superconducting diode with controllable efficiency in both amplitude and sign. Numerical simulations attribute the diode effect to higher harmonics in the current-phase relation. Crucially, fractional Shapiro step experiments provide direct insights into the evolution of these higher harmonics with flux tuning, showcasing significant enhancements in the second-harmonic signatures of the SQUID near half-integer flux quanta. Furthermore, we investigate the microwave-assisted diode response and experimentally show that the polarity of the diode effect can be switched by the microwave power. These results demonstrate the potential of InSb nanosheet-based hybrid devices as highly tunable elements for use in dissipationless electronics.

Title: Anomalous Chern-Simons orbital magnetoelectric coupling of three-dimensional Chern insulators: gauge-discontinuity formalism and adiabatic pumping
Authors: Yang Xue, Jianpeng Liu
Abstract: Chern-Simons orbital magnetoelectric (OME) coupling is usually the hallmark of nontrivial band topology in three-dimensional (3D) crystalline insulators. However, if a 3D insulator exhibits nonzero Chern number within any two-dimensional plane of the Brillouin zone, then traditionally the Chern-Simons coupling becomes ill defined for such 3D Chern insulators due to topological obstructions. In this work, by employing a ``gauge-discontinuity" formalism, we resolve this long-standing issue and rigorously derive a quantized layer-resolved OME response in 3D Chern insulators. We demonstrate that the difference of the layer-resolved OME coupling between adjacent layers is universally quantized in unit of $-C e^2/h$, where $C$ is the Chern number. This quantization arises from an anomalous contribution to the Chern-Simons OME coupling, which is closely associated with the Berry curvature of the occupied bands and the hybrid Wannier centers along the direction of the Chern vector $(0,0, C)$. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the anomalous Chern-Simons coupling can be transported by an exact integer quantum from one unit cell to its neighboring cell through an adiabatic cyclic pumping process, accompanied by a quantized displacement of Wannier center along the direction of the Chern vector. Our work provides a rigorous theoretical framework for understanding magnetoelectric response in 3D Chern insulators and opens avenues for designing topological quantum phenomena in layered systems.

Title: Accurate Simulation of the Hubbard Model with Finite Fermionic Projected Entangled Pair States
Authors: Wen-Yuan Liu, Huanchen Zhai, Ruojing Peng, Zheng-Cheng Gu, Garnet Kin-Lic Chan
Abstract: We demonstrate the use of finite-size fermionic projected entangled pair states, in conjunction with variational Monte Carlo, to perform accurate simulations of the ground-state of the 2D Hubbard model. Using bond dimensions of up to $D=28$, we show that we can surpass state-of-the-art DMRG energies that use up to $m=32000$ SU(2) multiplets on 8-leg ladders. We further apply our methodology to $10\times 16$, $12\times 16$ and $16 \times 16$ lattices at $1/8$ hole doping and observe the dimensional crossover between stripe orientations. Our work shows the power of finite-size fermionic tensor networks to resolve the physics of the 2D Hubbard model and related problems.

Title: Bright hybrid excitons in molecularly tunable bilayer crystals
Authors: Tomojit Chowdhury, Aurélie Champagne, Patrick Knüppel, Zehra Naqvi, Ariana Ray, Mengyu Gao, David A. Muller, Nathan Guisinger, Kin Fai Mak, Jeffrey B. Neaton, Jiwoong Park
Abstract: Bilayer crystals, built by stacking crystalline monolayers, generate interlayer potentials that govern excitonic phenomena but are constrained by fixed covalent lattices and orientations. Replacing one layer with an atomically thin molecular crystal overcomes this limitation, as diverse functional groups enable tunable molecular lattices and interlayer potentials, tailoring a wide range of excitonic properties. Here, we report hybrid excitons in four-atom-thick hybrid bilayer crystals (HBCs), directly synthesized with single-crystalline perylene diimide (PDI) molecular crystal atop WS2 monolayers. These excitons arise from a hybridized bilayer band structure, revealed by lattice-scale first-principles calculations, inheriting properties from both monolayers. They exhibit bright photoluminescence with near-unity polarization above and below the WS2 bandgap, along with spectral signatures of exciton delocalization, supported by theory, while their energies and intensities are tuned by modifying the HBC composition by synthesis. Our work introduces a molecule-based 2D quantum materials platform for bottom-up design and control of optoelectronic properties.

Title: Desmearing two-dimensional small-angle neutron scattering data by central moment expansions
Authors: Guan-Rong Huang, Chi-Huan Tung, Weijian Hua, Yifei Jin, Lionel Porcar, Yuya Shinohara, Christoph U. Wildgruber, Changwoo Doc, Wei-Ren Chen
Abstract: Resolution smearing is a critical challenge in the quantitative analysis of two-dimensional small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) data, particularly in studies of soft matter flow and deformation using SANS. We present the central moment expansion technique to address smearing in anisotropic scattering spectra, offering a model-free desmearing methodology. By accounting for directional variations in resolution smearing and enhancing computational efficiency, this approach reconstructs desmeared intensity distributions from smeared experimental data. Computational benchmarks using interacting hard-sphere fluids and Gaussian chain models validate the accuracy of the method, while simulated noise analyses confirm its robustness under experimental conditions. Furthermore, experimental validation using the rheo-SANS data of shear-induced micellar structures demonstrates the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The desmearing technique provides a powerful tool for advancing the quantitative analysis of anisotropic scattering patterns, enabling precise insights into the interplay between material microstructure and macroscopic flow behavior.

Title: Ferromagnetic resonance and spin Hall magnetoresistance of Tm3Fe5O12 films
Authors: Yufeng Wang, Peng Zhou, Shuai Liu, Yajun Qi, Tianjin Zhang
Abstract: Ferromagnetic insulating garnet films with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) are of great importance for the applications in spintronics. Tm3Fe5O12 (TmIG) with magnetoelastic anisotropy has been proven to exhibit PMA more easily than Y3Fe5O12. Here, magnetic parameters of TmIG films with various thicknesses are investigated by ferromagnetic resonance. The relationship between effective magnetic magnetization, surface perpendicular anisotropy field, magnetic anisotropy constants and film thickness is established. The parameters of spin Hall angle, spin diffusion length, and real part of the spin mixing conductance are obtained from the measurements of angular dependent magnetoresistance of TmIG/Pt heterostructures.

Title: Emergent extended states in an unbounded quasiperiodic lattice
Authors: Jia-Ming Zhang, Shan-Zhong Li, Shi-Liang Zhu, Zhi Li
Abstract: Previous studies have established that quasiperiodic lattice models with unbounded potentials can exhibit localized and multifractal states, yet preclude the existence of extended states. In this work, we introduce a quasiperiodic system that incorporates both unbounded potentials and unbounded hopping amplitudes, where extended states emerge as a direct consequence of the unbounded hopping terms overcoming the localization constraints imposed by the unbounded potential, thereby facilitating enhanced particle transport. By using Avila's global theory, we derive analytical expressions for the phase boundaries, with exact results aligning closely with numerical this http URL, we uncover a hidden self-duality in the proposed model by establishing a mapping to the Aubry-André model, revealing a profound structural connection between these systems.

Title: Diffusion Transients in Motility-Induced Phase Separation
Authors: Shubhadip Nayak, Poulami Bag, Pulak K. Ghosh, Yuxin Zhou, Qingqing Yin, Fabio Marchesoni, Franco Nori
Abstract: We numerically investigate normal diffusion in a two-dimensional athermal suspension of active particles undergoing motility-induced phase separation. The particles are modeled as achiral Janus disks with fixed self-propulsion speed and weakly fluctuating orientation. When plotted versus the overall suspension packing fraction, the relevant diffusion constant traces a hysteresis loop with sharp jumps in correspondence with the binodal and spinodal of the gaseous phase. No hysteresis loop is observed between the spinodal and binodal of the dense phase, as they appear to overlap. Moreover, even under steady-state phase separation, the particle displacement distributions exhibit non-Gaussian normal diffusion with transient fat (thin) tails in the presence (absence) of phase separation.

Title: Self-ion irradiation effects on nanoindentation-induced plasticity of crystalline iron: A joint experimental and computational study
Authors: K. Mulewska, F. Rovaris, F. J. Dominguez-Gutierrez, W. Y. Huo, D. Kalita, I. Jozwik, S. Papanikolaou, M. J. Alava, L. Kurpaska, J. Jagielski
Abstract: In this paper, experimental work is supported by multi-scale numerical modeling to investigate nanomechanical response of pristine and ion irradiated with Fe2+ ions with energy 5 MeV high purity iron specimens by nanoindentation and Electron Backscatter Diffraction. The appearance of a sudden displacement burst that is observed during the loading process in the load-displacement curves is connected with increased shear stress in a small subsurface volume due to dislocation slip activation and mobilization of pre-existing dislocations by irradiation. The molecular dynamics (MD) and 3D-discrete dislocation dynamics (3D-DDD) simulations are applied to model geometrically necessary dislocations (GNDs) nucleation mechanisms at early stages of nanoindentation test; providing an insight to the mechanical response of the material and its plastic instability and are in a qualitative agreement with GNDs density mapping images. Finally, we noted that dislocations and defects nucleated are responsible the material hardness increase, as observed in recorded load-displacement curves and pop-ins analysis.

Title: Giant Uncompensated Magnon Spin Currents in X-type Magnets
Authors: Zi-An Wang, Bo Li, Shui-Sen Zhang, Wen-Jian Lu, Mingliang Tian, Yu-Ping Sun, Evgeny Y. Tsymbal, Kaiyou Wang, Haifeng Du, Ding-Fu Shao
Abstract: Magnon spin currents in insulating magnets are useful for low-power spintronics. However, in magnets stacked by antiferromagnetic (AFM) exchange coupling, which have recently aroused significant interest for potential applications in spintronics, these currents are largely counteracted by opposite magnetic sublattices, thus suppressing their net effect. Contrary to this common observation, here, we show that magnets with X-type AFM stacking, where opposite magnetic sublattices form orthogonal intersecting chains, support giant magnon spin currents with minimal compensation. Our model Hamiltonian calculations predict magnetic chain locking of magnon spin currents in these X-type magnets, significantly reducing their compensation ratio. In addition, the one-dimensional nature of the chain-like magnetic sublattices enhances magnon spin conductivities surpassing those of two-dimensional ferromagnets and canonical altermagnets. Notably, uncompensated X-type magnets, such as odd-layer antiferromagnets and ferrimagnets, can exhibit magnon spin currents polarized opposite to those expected by their net magnetization. These unprecedented properties of X-type magnets, combined with their inherent advantages resulting from AFM coupling, offer a promising new path for low-power high-performance spintronics.

Title: Unravelling the influence of shell thickness in organic functionalized Cu2O nanoparticles on C2+ products distribution in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction
Authors: Jiajun Hu, Silvio Osella, Josep Albero, Hermenegildo García
Abstract: Cu-based electrocatalysts exhibits enormous potential for electrochemical CO2 conversion to added-value products. However, high selectivity, specially towards C2+ products, remains a critical challenge for its implementation in commercial applications. Herein, we report the preparation of a series of electrocatalysts based on octadecyl amine (ODA) coated Cu2O nanoparticles. HRTEM images show ODA coatings with thickness from 1.2 to 4 nm. DFT calculations predict that at low surface coverage, ODA tends to lay on the Cu2O surface, leaving hydrophilic regions. Oppositely, at high surface coverage, the ODA molecules are densely packed, being detrimental for both mass and charge transfer. These changes in ODA molecular arrangement explain differences in product selectivity. In situ Raman spectroscopy has revealed that the optimum ODA thickness contributes to the stabilization of key intermediates in the formation of C2+ products, especially ethanol. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and pulse voltammetry measurements confirm that the thicker ODA shells increase charge transfer resistance, while the lowest ODA content promotes faster intermediate desorption rates. At the optimum thickness, the intermediates desorption rates are the slowest, in agreement with the maximum concentration of intermediates observed by in situ Raman spectroscopy, thereby resulting in a Faradaic efficiency to ethanol and ethylene over 73 %.

Title: Mixed Fe-Mo carbide prepared by a sonochemical synthesis as highly efficient nitrate reduction electrocatalyst
Authors: Jiajun Hu, Silvio Osella, Eduardo Arizono dos Reis, Anelisse Brunca da Silva, Caue Ribeiro, Lucia Helena Mascaro, Josep Albero, Hermenegildo Garcia
Abstract: Ammonia, a versatile compound that can be used as a fertilizer, chemical or fuel, has since long been produced through the energy-intensive Haber-Bosch process. Recently, the electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) using electricity generated from renewable sources has attracted widespread attention. However, the complex reaction pathway of NO3RR leads to the formation of many undesirable by-products. Herein we successfully prepared a mixed (FeMo)2C catalyst with good electrocatalytic NO3RR, having a NH3 yield of 14.66 mg h-1 cm-2 and an FE of 94.35 % at low potential -0.3 V vs RHE. DFT calculations show that the presence of Fe in Mo2C lattice changes the reaction mechanism, decreasing the potential barrier to be overcome from 1.36 to 0.89 eV. In addition, mixed Fe-Mo carbide facilitates the adsorption of intermediates and promotes NH3 desorption, facilitating NO3- reduction to NH3. In addition, (FeMo)2C was used as cathode for Zn-NO3 battery to generate electricity, producing ammonia at the same time, with a power density of 3.8 mWcm-2 and an NH3 FE of 88 %. This work describes a new synthesis method for mixed metal carbides and provides a promising strategy for NH3 production.

Title: Two-dimensional higher-order Weyl semimetals
Authors: Lizhou Liu, Qing-Feng Sun, Ying-Tao Zhang
Abstract: We propose a theoretical scheme to realize two-dimensional higher-order Weyl semimetals using a trilayer topological insulator film coupled with a d-wave altermagnet. Our results show that the trilayer topological insulator exhibits two-dimensional Weyl semimetal characteristics with helical edge states. Notably, the Weyl points are located at four high-symmetry points in the Brillouin zone, and the topology of symmetric subspaces governs the formation of these Weyl points and edge states. Upon introducing a d-wave altermagnet oriented along the z-direction, gaps open in the helical edge states while preserving two Weyl points, leading to the realization of two-dimensional higher-order Weyl semimetals hosting topological corner states. The nonzero winding number in the subspace along the high-symmetry line serves as a topological invariant characterizing these corner states, and the other subspace Hamiltonian confirms the existence of the Weyl points. Finally, a topological phase diagram provides a complete topological description of the system.

Title: Photogalvanic Shift Currents in BiFeO3 --LaFeO3 Superlattices
Authors: Francesco Delodovici (SPMS), Charles Paillard
Abstract: Designing materials with controlled photovoltaic response may lead to improved solar cells or photosensors. In this regard, ferroelectric superlattices have emerged as a rich platform to engineer functional properties. In addition, ferroelectrics are naturally endowed with a bulk photovoltaic response stemming from non-thermalized photoexcited carriers, which can overcome the fundamental limits of current solar cells. Yet, their photovoltaic output has been limited by poor optical absorption and poor charge collection or photo-excited carrier mean free path. We use Density Functional Theory and Wannierization to compute the so-called Bulk Photovoltaic shift current and the optical properties of BiFeO3/LaFeO3 superlattices. We show that, by stacking these two materials, not only the optical absorption is improved at larger wavelengths (due to LaFeO3 smaller bandgap), but the photovolgavanic shift current is also enhanced compared to that of pure BiFeO3 , by suppressing the destructive interferences occurring between different wavelengths.

Title: Quantum spin Hall effect in bilayer honeycomb lattices with C-type antiferromagnetic order
Authors: Lizhou Liu, Cheng-Ming Miao, Qing-Feng Sun, Ying-Tao Zhang
Abstract: We propose a scheme to realize time-reversal symmetry-broken quantum spin Hall insulators using bilayer honeycomb lattices, combining intrinsic spin-orbit coupling, C-type antiferromagnetic ordering, and staggered potentials. The C-type antiferromagnetic order emerges from the interplay between intralayer antiferromagnetism and interlayer ferromagnetism. The system's topological properties are characterized by the spin Chern number. We present the topological phase diagram of the bilayer honeycomb lattice, providing a detailed insight into the stability and tunability of the quantum spin Hall effect in this system. The presence of helical edge states is confirmed by the measurement of quantized longitudinal resistance values of 3/2(h/e2) and 1/2(h/e2) in a sixterminal Hall-bar device. Remarkably, this quantum spin Hall insulator phase is protected by interlayer parity-time (PT) symmetry, despite the breaking of time-reversal symmetry.

Title: Anatomy of Spin Wave Polarization in Ferromagnets
Authors: Yutian Wang, Ruoban Ma, Jiang Xiao
Abstract: Spin waves in ferromagnetic materials are predominantly characterized by right-handed circular polarization due to symmetry breaking induced by net magnetization. However, magnetic interactions, including the external magnetic field, Heisenberg exchange, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, and dipole-dipole interaction, can modify this behavior, leading to elliptical polarization. This study provides a systematic analysis of these interactions and their influence on spin wave polarization, establishing principles to predict traits such as polarization degree and orientation based on equilibrium magnetization textures. The framework is applied to diverse magnetic configurations, including spin spirals, domain walls, and Skyrmions, offering a comprehensive yet simple approach to understanding polarization dynamics in ferromagnetic systems.

Title: Controlling deposition and characterising dynamics of thin liquid films with high temporal and spatial resolution
Authors: G Le Lay (Upcité, Inp-Cnrs, Insis - Cnrs), A Daerr (Upcité, Inp-Cnrs, Insis - Cnrs)
Abstract: The high inertia of classical fluid coating processes severely limits the possibility of controlling the deposited film thickness through the entrainment velocity. We describe and characterize a new experimental device where the inertia is dramatically reduced, allowing for millimeter-scale patterning with micrometer-accurate thickness. Measuring precise film profiles over large spatial extents with high temporal resolution poses a challenge, which we overcome using a custom interferometric set-up coupled with state-of-the-art signal processing. The sensitivity of our method allows us to resolve film thinning rates in the nanometer-per-second range, and to quantify the relative contribution of surface-tension and gravity driven flows. We apply this method by showing that the thickness of the deposited film obeys the classical Landau-Levich scaling even when the meniscus faces important acceleration.

Title: Finite-rate quench in disordered Chern and $Z_2$ topological insulators
Authors: Shengnan Du, Zhao Liu
Abstract: We study quantum quench of finite rate across topological quantum transitions in two-dimensional Chern and $Z_2$ topological insulators. We choose the representative Haldane model and the Kane-Mele model to investigate the behavior of excitation density generated by the quench and the impact of disorder. For the Haldane model, as long as the spectral gap is not closed by disorder, we find the excitation density at the end of the quench obeys the power-law scaling with the quench rate, consistent with the prediction of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. However, anti-Kibble-Zurek behavior is observed in disordered Kane-Mele model, which we attribute to the existence of a disorder-induced gapless region. Moreover, we demonstrate that particle's onsite occupation can be used as a local measurable quantity to probe the breakdown of adiabatic evolution, which exhibits similar dependence on the quench rate as the excitation density for both the Haldane and Kane-Mele models. This similarity still holds in the bulk of the system even when we consider realistic open boundary conditions, facilitating the experimental characterization of the dynamic features in these models.

Title: DFT+DMFT study on pressure-induced valence instability of CeCoSi
Authors: Shuai-Kang Zhang, Yuanji Xu, Guojun Li, Junshuai Wang, Zhongpo Zhou, Yipeng An
Abstract: Rare-earth compounds RCoSi exhibit unique properties, with distinct structural behaviors depending on whether R is a light, middle or heavy rare-earth element. Among them, CeCoSi undergoes a structural phase transition under high pressure, with the phase transition pressure increasing as temperature rises. Some experimental studies suggest that the transition is closely related to the behavior of Ce-4f electrons. In this work, we systematically studied the evolution of the electronic structure of CeCoSi with temperature and pressure. First, we used the DFT+DMFT to calculate the energy-volume curve of CeCoSi, which was in good agreement with the experimental results and far superior to the DFT method. Next, we studied the electronic structure of CeCoSi under different pressures and temperatures using DFT+DMFT. Our results show that CeCoSi is a Kondo metal with hybridization of Ce-4f and Co-3d. As pressure increases, the renormalization factor Z of Ce-4f5/2 increases, the occupancy number of Ce-4f electrons decreases, and CeCoSi transitions to a mixed-valence state at ~5.5 GPa in 100 K. The pressure of the quantum phase transition PQ is slightly higher than the experimentally observed structural phase transition pressure PS, and the PQ increases with increasing temperature, which is consistent with the behavior of PS in experiment. In addition, the hybridization strength of Ce-4f in the mixed-valence state is significantly greater than in the Kondo metal state. Our results suggest that the valence instability of Ce-4f is the cause of the structural phase transition. As pressure increases, Ce-4f electrons delocalize and CeCoSi transitions to mixed-valence state. This valence instability may cause redistribution of electron density, thus inducing a structural phase transition. Our work reveals the cause of the structural phase transition of CeCoSi under high pressure.

Abstract: Altermagnets exhibit characteristics akin to antiferromagnets, with spin-split anisotropic bands in momentum space. RuO$_2$ has been considered as a prototype altermagnet; however, recent reports have questioned altermagnetic ground state in this material. In this study, we provide direct experimental evidence of altermagnetic characteristics in RuO$_2$ films by demonstrating spin-dependent tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) in RuO$_2$-based magnetic tunnel junctions. Our results show the spin-splitted anisotropic band structure of RuO$_2$, with the observed TMR determined by the direction of the Néel vector of RuO$_2$. These results reflect the altermagnetic nature of RuO$_2$ and highlight its potential for spintronic applications, leveraging the combined strengths of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic systems.

Title: AV$_3$Sb$_5$ kagome superconductors: a review with transport measurements
Authors: Zhuokai Xu, Tian Le, Xiao Lin
Abstract: Kagome systems have garnered considerable attention due to the unique features of the sublattice structure and band topology. The recently discovered kagome metals AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (where A = K, Rb, Cs) host a rich array of symmetry-breaking phases, including exotic charge density waves (CDW), electronic nematicity, pair density waves (PDW) and superconductivity. Despite extensive experimental and theoretical investigations into the diverse phases, several key issues remain contentious, such as a solid clarification of the time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRS-breaking) in the CDW order and its implications for the nature of superconducting (SC) pairing symmetry. This review aims to shed light on the transport properties of these intertwined phases, emphasizing the pivotal role that transport measurements play in uncovering the non-trivial quantum states of matter.

Abstract: The high optoelectronic quality of halide perovskites lends them to be utilized in optoelectronic devices and recently in emerging quantum emission applications. Advancements in perovskite nanomaterials have led to the discovery of processes in which luminescence decay times are sub-100 picoseconds, stimulating the exploration of even faster radiative rates for advanced quantum applications, which have only been prominently realised in III-V materials grown through costly epitaxial growth methods. Here, we discovered ultrafast quantum transients of time scales ~2 picoseconds at low temperature in bulk formamidinium lead iodide films grown through scalable solution or vapour approaches. Using a multimodal strategy, combining ultrafast spectroscopy, optical and electron microscopy, we show that these transients originate from quantum tunnelling in nanodomain superlattices. The outcome of the transient decays, photoluminescence, mirrors the photoabsorption of the states, with an ultra-narrow linewidth at low temperature as low as <2 nm (~4 meV). Localized correlation of the emission and structure reveals that the nanodomain superlattices are formed by alternating ordered layers of corner sharing and face sharing octahedra. This discovery opens new applications leveraging intrinsic quantum properties and demonstrates powerful multimodal approaches for quantum investigations.

Title: Evidence for spin-fluctuation-mediated superconductivity in electron-doped cuprates
Authors: C. M. Duffy, S. J. Tu, Q. H. Chen, J. S. Zhang, A. Cuoghi, R. D. H. Hinlopen, T. Sarkar, R. L. Greene, K. Jin, N. E. Hussey
Abstract: In conventional, phonon-mediated superconductors, the transition temperature $T_c$ and normal-state scattering rate $1/\tau$ - deduced from the linear-in-temperature resistivity $\rho(T)$ - are linked through the electron-phonon coupling strength $\lambda_{\rm ph}$. In cuprate high-$T_c$ superconductors, no equivalent $\lambda$ has yet been identified, despite the fact that at high doping, $\alpha$ - the low-$T$ $T$-linear coefficient of $\rho(T)$ - also scales with $T_c$. Here, we use dc resistivity and high-field magnetoresistance to extract $\tau^{-1}$ in electron-doped La$_{2-x}$Ce$_x$CuO$_4$ (LCCO) as a function of $x$ from optimal doping to beyond the superconducting dome. A highly anisotropic inelastic component to $\tau^{-1}$ is revealed whose magnitude diminishes markedly across the doping series. Using known Fermi surface parameters and subsequent modelling of the Hall coefficient, we demonstrate that the form of $\tau^{-1}$ in LCCO is consistent with scattering off commensurate antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations of variable strength $\lambda_{\rm sf}$. The clear correlation between $\alpha$, $\lambda_{\rm sf}$ and $T_c$ then identifies low-energy spin-fluctuations as the primary pairing glue in electron-doped cuprates. The contrasting magnetotransport behaviour in hole-doped cuprates suggests that the higher $T_c$ in the latter cannot be attributed solely to an increase in $\lambda_{\rm sf}$. Indeed, the success in modelling LCCO serves to reinforces the notion that resolving the origin of high-temperature superconductivity in hole-doped cuprates may require more than a simple extension of BCS theory.

Title: Bound states of quasiparticles with quartic dispersion in an external potential: WKB approach
Authors: E.V. Gorbar, V.P. Gusynin
Abstract: The Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin semiclassical method is formulated for quasiparticles with quartic-in-momentum dispersion which presents the simplest case of a soft energy-momentum dispersion. It is shown that matching wave functions in the classically forbidden and allowed regions requires the consideration of higher-order Airy-type functions. The asymptotics of these functions are found by using the method of steepest descents and contain additional exponentially suppressed contributions known as hyperasymptotics. These hyperasymptotics are crucially important for the correct matching of wave functions in vicinity of turning points for higher-order differential equations. A quantization condition for bound state energies is obtained, which generalizes the standard Bohr-Sommerfeld condition for particles with quadratic energy-momentum dispersion and contains nonperturbative in $\hbar$ correction. The quantization condition is used to find bound state energies in the case of quadratic and quartic potentials.

Title: Time-delayed Newton's law of cooling with a finite-rate thermal quench. Impact on the Mpemba and Kovacs effects
Authors: Andrés Santos
Abstract: The Mpemba and Kovacs effects are two notable memory phenomena observed in nonequilibrium relaxation processes. In a recent study [Phys.~Rev.~E \textbf{109}, 044149 (2024)], these effects were analyzed within the framework of the time-delayed Newton's law of cooling under the assumption of instantaneous temperature quenches. Here, the analysis is extended to incorporate finite-rate quenches, characterized by a nonzero quench duration $\sigma$. The results indicate that a genuine Mpemba effect is absent under finite-rate quenches if both samples experience the same thermal environment during the quenching process. However, if $\sigma$ remains sufficiently small, the deviations in the thermal environment stay within an acceptable range, allowing the Mpemba effect to persist with a slightly enhanced magnitude. In contrast, the Kovacs effect is significantly amplified, with the transient hump in the temperature evolution becoming more pronounced as both the waiting time and $\sigma$ increase. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating finite-time effects in nonequilibrium thermal relaxation models and offer a more realistic perspective for experimental studies.

Title: Promising High Temperature Thermoelectric Performance of Alkali Metal-based Zintl phases X$_2$AgY (X = Na, K; Y = Sb, Bi): Insights from First-Principles Studies
Authors: Mohd Zeeshan, Indranil Mal, B K Mani
Abstract: In the quest for novel thermoelectric materials to harvest waste environmental heat, we investigate alkali metal-based Zintl phases X$_2$AgY (X = Na, K, and Y = Sb, Bi) utilizing first-principles methods. We obtain significantly low lattice thermal conductivity values ranging 0.9-0.5 W m$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$ at 300~K, challenging established thermoelectric materials such as SnSe, PbTe, Bi$_2$Te$_3$ as well as other Zintl phases. We trace such astonishingly low values to lattice anharmonicity, large phonon scattering phase space, low phonon velocities, and lifetimes. In K-based materials, the low phonon velocities are further linked to flattened phonon modes arising from the gap in the optical spectrum. Furthermore, the existence of bonding heterogeneity could hamper heat conduction in these materials. In addition, an avoided crossing in the phonon dispersions suggesting rattling behavior, observed in all materials except Na$_2$AgSb, suppresses the dispersion of acoustic modes, further reducing the phonon velocities. When combined with electrical transport calculations, the materials exhibit high figure of merit values at 700~K, i.e., $ZT\sim2.1$ for Na$_2$AgSb, $1.7$ for Na$_2$AgBi, $0.9$ for K$_2$AgSb, and $1.0$ for K$_2$AgBi. Our predicted $ZT$ values are competitive with state-of-the-art thermoelectric materials such as Mg$_3$Sb$_2$, ZrCoBi, PbTe, SnSe, and as well as with contemporary Zintl phases. Our findings underscore the potential of light alkali metal atoms combined with Ag-Bi/Sb type frameworks to achieve superior thermoelectric performance, paving the way for material design for specific operating conditions.

Title: Interfacial superconductivity in the type-III heterostructure SnSe$_2$/PtTe$_2$
Authors: Jun Fan, Xiao-Le Qiu, Zhong-Yi Lu, Kai Liu, Ben-Chao Gong
Abstract: Interfacial superconductivity (IS) has been a topic of intense interest in the condensed matter physics, due to its unique properties and exotic photoelectrical performance. However, there are few reports about IS systems consisting of two insulators. Here, motivated by the emergence of an insulator-metal transition in the type-III heterostructure and the superconductivity in the some "special" two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors via the electron doping, we predict that 2D heterostructure SnSe$_2$/PtTe$_2$ is a model system for realizing the IS by using first-principles calculations. Our results show that due to the slight but crucial interlayer charge transfer, SnSe$_2$/PtTe$_2$ turns to be a type-III heterostructure with metallic properties and shows a superconducting transition with the critical temperature ($T_\text{c}$) of 3.73 K. Similar to the enhance electron-phonon coupling (EPC) in the electron doped SnSe$_2$ monolayer, the IS in the heterostructure SnSe$_2$/PtTe$_2$ mainly originates from the metallized SnSe$_2$ layer. Furthermore, we find that the superconductivity is sensitive to the tensile lattice strain, forming a dome-shaped superconducting phase diagram. Remarkably, at the 7\% tensile strain, the superconducting $T_\text{c}$ can increase more than twofold (8.80 K), resulting from the softened acoustic phonon at the M point and the enhanced EPC strength. Our study provides a concrete example for realizing IS in the type-III heterosturcture, which waits for future experimental verification.

Title: Silicon oxide nanoparticles grown on graphite by codeposition of the atomic constituents
Authors: Steffen Friis Holleufer, Alfred Hopkinson, Duncan S. Sutherland, Zheshen Li, Jeppe V. Lauritsen, Liv Hornekær, Andrew Cassidy
Abstract: Nanoscale silicate dust particles are the most abundant refractory component observed in the interstellar medium and thought to play a key role in catalysing the formation of complex organic molecules in the star forming regions of space. We present a method to synthesise a laboratory analogue of nanoscale silicate dust particles on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) substrates by co-deposition of the atomic constituents. The resulting nanoparticulate films are sufficiently thin and conducting to allow for surface science investigations, and are characterised here, in situ under UHV, using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, near-edge X-ray absorption atomic fine spectroscopy and scanning tunnelling microscopy, and, ex situ, using scanning electron microscopy. We compare SiO$_{x}$ film growth with and without the use of atomic O beams during synthesis and conclude that exposure of the sample to atomic O leads to homogeneous films of interconnected nanoparticle networks. The networks covers the graphite substrate and demonstrate superior thermal stability, up to 1073 K, when compared to oxides produced without exposure to atomic O. In addition, control over the flux of atomic O during growth allows for control of the average oxidation state of the film produced. Photoelectron spectroscopy measurements demonstrate that fully oxidised films have an SiO$_{2}$ stoichiometry very close to bulk SiO$_{2}$ and scanning tunnelling microscopy images show the basic cluster building unit to have a radius of approximately 2.5 nm. The synthesis of SiO$_{x}$ films with adjustable stoichiometry and suitable for surface science experiments that require conducting substrates will be of great interest to the astrochemistry community, and will allow for nanoscale-investigation of the chemical processes thought to be catalysed at the surface of dust grains in space.

Title: Neural Density Functional Theory in Higher Dimensions with Convolutional Layers
Authors: Felix Glitsch, Jens Weimar, Martin Oettel
Abstract: Based on recent advancements in using machine learning for classical density functional theory for systems with one-dimensional, planar inhomogeneities, we propose a machine learning model for application in two dimensions (2D) akin to density functionals in weighted density forms, as e. g. in fundamental measure theory (FMT). We implement the model with fast convolutional layers only and apply it to a system of hard disks in fully 2D inhomogeneous situations. The model is trained on a combination of smooth and steplike external potentials in the fluid phase. Pair correlation functions from test particle geometry show very satisfactory agreement with simulations although these types of external potentials have not been included in the training. The method should be fully applicable to 3D problems, where the bottleneck at the moment appears to be in obtaining smooth enough 3D histograms as training data from simulations.

Title: Unveiling the Interfacial Reconstruction Mechanism Enabling Stable Growth of the Delafossite PdCoO2 on Al2O3 and LaAlO3
Authors: Anna Scheid, Tobias Heil, Y. Eren Suyolcu, Qi song, Niklas Enderlein, Arnaud P. Nono Tchiomo, Prosper Ngabonzigza, Philipp Hansmann, Darrell G. Schlom, Peter A. van Aken
Abstract: Delafossites, comprised of noble metal (A+) and strongly correlated sublayers (BO2-), form natural superlattices with highly anisotropic properties. These properties hold significant promise for various applications, but their exploitation hinges on the successful growth of high-quality thin films on suitable substrates. Unfortunately, the unique lattice geometry of delafossites presents a significant challenge to thin-film fabrication. Different delafossites grow differently, even when deposited on the same substrate, ranging from successful epitaxy to complete growth suppression. These variations often lack a clear correlation to obvious causes like lattice mismatch. Unidentified stabilization mechanisms appear to enable growth in certain cases, allowing these materials to form stable thin films or act as buffer layers for subsequent delafossite growth. This study employs advanced scanning transmission electron microscopy techniques to investigate the nucleation mechanism underlying the stable growth of PdCoO2 films on Al2O3 and LaAlO3 substrates, grown via molecular-beam epitaxy. Our findings reveal the presence of a secondary phase within the substrate surface that stabilizes the films. This mechanism deviates from the conventional understanding of strain relief mechanisms at oxide heterostructure interfaces and differs significantly from those observed for Cu-based delafossites.

Title: Impact of friction and grain shape on the morphology of sheared granular media
Authors: Huzaif Rahim, Sudeshna Roy, Thorsten Pöschel
Abstract: The interplay between dilatancy and particle alignment in sheared granular materials composed of non-spherical particles leads to morphological inhomogeneity. Dilatancy, driven by interparticle friction, causes the packing to expand, while particle alignment tends to densify it. We examine the influence of friction, particle aspect ratio, and initial packing conditions on the steady-state particle alignment and packing density. Unlike spherical particles, non-spherical particles with higher AR exhibit either dilatancy or compaction under shear, leading to spontaneous heaping or depression formation. We analyzed the evolution of packing density to identify whether dilatancy or compression prevails within the shear band.

Title: Restriction of macroscopic structural superlubricity due to structure relaxation by the example of twisted graphene bilayer
Authors: Alexander S. Minkin, Irina V. Lebedeva, Andrey M. Popov, Sergey A. Vyrko, Nikolai A. Poklonski, Yurii E. Lozovik
Abstract: The effect of structure relaxation on the potential energy surface (PES) of interlayer interaction of twisted graphene bilayer is studied for a set of commensurate moiré systems using the registry-dependent empirical potential of Kolmogorov and Crespi. It is found that the influence of structure relaxation on the amplitude of PES corrugations (determining static friction) depends on the unit cell size (or related twist angle) of the moiré system. For moiré systems with the smallest unit cells, the amplitudes of PES corrugations calculated with and without account of structure relaxation are approximately the same. However, for large unit cell sizes, the structure relaxation can lead to an increase of PES corrugations by orders of magnitude. This means that structure relaxation can provide the main contribution into the static friction of a superlubric system under certain conditions (such as the contact size and twist angle). Moreover, the change of the PES type because of structure relaxation from a trigonal lattice of maxima to a trigonal lattice of minima is observed for the systems with the moiré patterns (5,1) and (5,3). Based on the results obtained, possible crossovers between static friction modes taking place upon changing the twist angle in a macroscopic superlubric system consisting of identical layers are discussed. Additionally it is shown that the PES for relaxed structures can still be approximated by the first Fourier harmonics compatible with symmetries of twisted layers analogously to the PES for rigid layers.

Title: On determining the energy dispersion of spin excitations with scanning tunneling spectroscopy
Authors: J. C. G. Henriques, Chenxiao Zhao, G. Catarina, Pascal Ruffieux, Roman Fasel, J. Fernández-Rossier
Abstract: Conventional methods to measure the dispersion relations of collective spin excitations involve probing bulk samples with particles such as neutrons, photons or electrons, which carry a well-defined momentum. Open-ended finite-size spin chains, on the contrary, do not have a well-defined momentum due to the lack of translation symmetry, and their spin excitations are measured with an eminently local probe, using inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy (IETS) with a scanning tunneling microscope (STM). Here we discuss under what conditions STM-IETS spectra can be Fourier-transformed to yield dispersion relations in these systems. We relate the success of this approach to the degree to which spin excitations form standing waves. We show that STM-IETS can reveal the energy dispersion of magnons in ferromagnets and triplons in valence bond crystals, but not that of spinons, the spin excitations in Heisenberg spin-1/2 chains. We compare our theoretical predictions with state-of-the-art measurements on nanographene chains that realize the relevant spin Hamiltonians.

Title: The link between Microstructural Heterogeneity, Diffusivity, and Hydrogen Embrittlement
Authors: Daniel J Long, Edmund Tarleton, Alan CF Cocks, Felix Hofmann
Abstract: Green hydrogen is likely to play a major role in decarbonising the aviation industry. It is crucial to understand the effects of microstructure on hydrogen redistribution, which may be implicated in the embrittlement of candidate fuel system metals. We have developed a stochastic multiscale finite element modelling framework that integrates micromechanical and hydrogen transport models, such that the dominant microstructural effects can be efficiently accounted for at millimetre length scales. Our results show that microstructure has a significant effect on hydrogen localisation in elastically anisotropic materials, which exhibit an interesting interplay between microstructure and millimetre-scale hydrogen redistribution at various loading rates. Considering 316L stainless steel and nickel, a direct comparison of model predictions against experimental hydrogen embrittlement data reveals that the reported sensitivity to loading rate is strongly linked with rate-dependent grain scale diffusion. These findings highlight the need to incorporate microstructural characteristics in the design of hydrogen resistant materials.

Title: Transmission Probability in Double Quantum Well with Triple Barrier
Authors: Krishna Rana Magar, Upendra Rijal, Sanju Shrestha
Abstract: Quantum well of AlGaAs/GaAs is very important to study transport properties of electrons due to its wider application in electronic devices. Hence, the double well of AlGaAs/GaAs with triple barrier is taken to study transmission probability. Transmission probability is found to decrease with the increase in the height and width of the barrier. Transmission probability with energy of electron shows two peaks while taking all three barrier of the same height. Whereas a single and higher value of peak is found when the height of the central barrier is slightly reduced.

Title: Interplay of carrier density and mobility in Al-Rich (Al,Ga)N-Channel HEMTs: Impact on high-power device performance potential
Authors: Badal Mondal, Pietro Pampili, Jayjit Mukherjee, David Moran, Peter James Parbrook, Stefan Schulz
Abstract: Despite considerable advancements, high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) based on gallium nitride (GaN) channels remain largely limited to power applications below 650 V. For higher power demands, the ultra-wide bandgap semiconductor alloy aluminium gallium nitride, (Al,Ga)N, has emerged as a key contender for next-generation HEMTs. In this theoretical study, we show that Al-rich Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$N-channel HEMTs (with $x \geq 0.5$) outperform the GaN-channel counterparts at and above room temperature, across all Al compositions, $x$. This contrasts with recent theory reports which suggest that only Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$N HEMTs with high Al content ($x \geq 0.85$) offer comparable performance to GaN-channel devices. Unlike previous assumptions of a constant two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) density across the entire composition range $x$, we show that the 2DEG density is highly sensitive to both the Al content and thickness of the individual layers in a HEMT structure. We demonstrate that the superior performance of Al-rich (Al,Ga)N-channel HEMTs is driven by a competing effect between 2DEG density and electron mobility. This work challenges the assumptions of prior studies, which can result in a significant under or overestimation of the potential of high Al content HEMTs. The insights gained from our work provide a comprehensive understanding of the trade-offs between device and material parameters, thus help to guide the design of future Al-rich ($x = 0.5-1.0$) Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$N-channel HEMTs for high-power applications.

Title: Inherited Berry curvature of phonons in Dirac materials with time-reversal symmetry
Authors: Sayandip Ghosh, Selçuk Parlak, Ion Garate
Abstract: The Berry curvature of phonons is an active subject of research in condensed matter physics. Here, we present a model in which phonons acquire a Berry curvature through their coupling to electrons in crystals with time-reversal symmetry. We illustrate this effect for BaMnSb$_2$, a quasi two-dimensional Dirac insulator, whose low-energy massive Dirac fermions generate a phonon Berry curvature that is proportional to the electronic valley Chern number.

Title: Quantum Coherent Transport of 1D ballistic states in second order topological insulator Bi$_4$Br$_4$
Authors: J. Lefeuvre, M. Kobayashi, G. Patriarche, N. Findling, D. Troadec, M. Ferrier, S. Guéron, H. Bouchiat, T. Sasagawa, R. Deblock
Abstract: We investigate quantum transport in micrometer-sized single crystals of Bi$_4$Br$_4$, a material predicted to be a second-order topological insulator. 1D topological states with long phase coherence times are revealed via the modulation of quantum interferences with magnetic field and gate voltage. In particular, we demonstrate the existence of Aharanov-Bohm interference between 1D ballistic states several micrometers long, that we identify as phase-coherent hinge modes on neighbouring step edges at the crystal surface. These Aharanov-Bohm interferences are made possible by a disordered phase-coherent contact region, the existence of which is confirmed by STEM/EDX imaging of FIB lamellae. Their coherent nature modulates the transmission of the 1D edge states, leading to weak antilocalization and universal conductance fluctuations with surprisingly large characteristic fields and a strongly anisotropic behavior. These complementary experimental results provide a comprehensive, coherent description of quantum transport in Bi$_4$Br$_4$, and establishes the material as belonging to the class of second-order topological insulators with topologically protected 1D ballistic states.

Title: Interfacial superconductivity and a Se-vacancy ordered insulating phase in the FeSe/PbOx heterostructures
Authors: Yunkai Guo, Xuanyu Long, Jingming Yan, Zheng Liu, Qi-Kun Xue, Wei Li
Abstract: The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in FeSe/SrTiO3 has sparked significant interests in exploring new superconducting systems with engineered interfaces. Here, using molecular beam epitaxy growth, we successfully fabricate FeSe/PbOx heterostructures and discover superconductivities in three different monolayer FeSe-related interfaces. We observe superconducting gaps of 13~14 meV in the monolayer FeSe films grown on two different phases of PbOx. Moreover, we discover a new insulating Fe10Se9 phase with an ordered $\sqrt{5}\times\sqrt{5}$ Se-vacancy structure. Our first-principles calculation suggests that this new insulating phase originates from electronic correlation. Intriguingly, an additional monolayer FeSe film grown on the insulating Fe10Se9 also exhibits superconductivity with the gap size of 5 meV. Our results suggest that the work function differences between the monolayer FeSe and the substrates, which can induce band bending and charge transfer, are crucial for the interfacial superconductivity.

Title: State- and momentum-dependent nonlinear Stark effect of interlayer excitons in bilayer WSe$_2$
Authors: Cem Sevik, Engin Torun, Milorad V. Milosevic, Fulvio Paleari
Abstract: Interlayer excitons in van der Waals heterostructures offer rich collective phases, prospective optoelectronic applications, and versatile tunability, where control by electronic means is particularly relevant and practical. Here, in the case of bilayer WSe$_2$, we reveal how layer localization of excitons governs their response to an external electric field. Using Many-Body Perturbation Theory, we calculate the exciton dispersion for different stacking symmetries under applied electric field and/or strain, in order to map the landscape of competing low-energy excitons in four distinct finite-momentum valleys. While intralayer excitons are not affected by the electric field, some interlayer ones exhibit a nonlinear Stark shift that becomes linear after a critical threshold. The degree of nonlinearity is a direct measure of the layer hybridization of the electronic subcomponents of the exciton. Our findings explain the peculiar Stark-shift regimes observed in recent experiments, the nature of (anti)symmetric spectral shifts around zero field, and the sensitivity of dipolar excitons to external perturbations, all highly relevant to their further applications in excitonic condensates, optoelectronics devices and quantum emitters.

Title: Elastically Buckled Film-Substrate System as a Two-dimensional Crystal
Authors: Wenqing Zhu
Abstract: Compressive mechanical stress exceeding a critical value leads to the formation of periodic surface buckling patterns in film-substrate systems. A comprehensive understanding of this buckling phenomenon is desired in applications where the surface topologies are modulated to achieve multifunctionalities. Here we reformulate the finite-deformation elastic theory of a film-substrate system by treating the compliant substrate as a nonlinear elastic solid. The resulting elastic free energy functional of the deflection field is shown to be equivalent to a minimal density functional of phase-field crystal theory plus a Gaussian curvature-related term. The proposed elastic model constructs a phase diagram based on free energy minimization, quantitatively agreeing with the buckling transitions observed in former experiments. The emerging hexagonal buckling system is shown to be equivalent to a two-dimensional crystal with proper scalings. We further conducted simulations of repeated buckling under cyclic stress to demonstrate a dynamically modulated structural adhesive, which resembles the physical process of repeated crystallization and melting near a critical temperature.

Title: Symmetries at the Anderson transition of correlated two-dimensional electrons
Authors: Mathieu Lizée, Mohammadmehdi Torzadeh, François Debontridder, Marie Hervé, Christophe Brun, Tristan Cren
Abstract: The interplay between Anderson localization and Coulomb repulsion reveals deep connections to superconductivity and many-body localization in quantum systems. In this study, we investigate a tin monolayer on silicon, a material known for its Mott and antiferromagnetic behavior, as it undergoes a metal-insulator transition near a band edge. By analyzing spatial correlations of the local density of states (LDOS) with scanning tunneling spectroscopy, we precisely identify the mobility edge and determine its critical exponent as nu = 0.75 +/- 0.1. Our findings show that both LDOS distribution functions and multifractal spectra obey two exact symmetry relations based on the Weyl group symmetry of nonlinear sigma-models. These symmetries hold across the entire transition, from extended to strongly localized states, in agreement with theoretical predictions. Additionally, we observe a power-law scaling of LDOS fluctuations close to the band edge (power -1.7), deep in the localized regime. Using tight-binding models, we demonstrate that breaking time-reversal symmetry significantly improves the agreement between our experimental data and theory compared to the standard Anderson model. Overall, our results provide a unifying framework for understanding localization at the band gap edge of a strongly correlated 2D material and show how localization patterns reflect the symmetry class of disordered electronic systems.

Title: AI-Driven Discovery of High Performance Polymer Electrodes for Next-Generation Batteries
Authors: Subhash V.S. Ganti, Lukas Woelfel, Christopher Kuenneth
Abstract: The use of transition group metals in electric batteries requires extensive usage of critical elements like lithium, cobalt and nickel, which poses significant environmental challenges. Replacing these metals with redox-active organic materials offers a promising alternative, thereby reducing the carbon footprint of batteries by one order of magnitude. However, this approach faces critical obstacles, including the limited availability of suitable redox-active organic materials and issues such as lower electronic conductivity, voltage, specific capacity, and long-term stability. To overcome the limitations for lower voltage and specific capacity, a machine learning (ML) driven battery informatics framework is developed and implemented. This framework utilizes an extensive battery dataset and advanced ML techniques to accelerate and enhance the identification, optimization, and design of redox-active organic materials. In this contribution, a data-fusion ML coupled meta learning model capable of predicting the battery properties, voltage and specific capacity, for various organic negative electrodes and charge carriers (positive electrode materials) combinations is presented. The ML models accelerate experimentation, facilitate the inverse design of battery materials, and identify suitable candidates from three extensive material libraries to advance sustainable energy-storage technologies.

Title: Quorum sensing and absorbing phase transitions in colloidal active matter
Authors: Thibault Lefranc, Alberto Dinelli, Carla Fernandez Rico, Roel P. A. Dullens, Julien Tailleur, Denis Bartolo
Abstract: Unlike biological active matter that constantly adapt to their environment, the motors of synthetic active particles are typically agnostic to their surroundings and merely operate at constant force. Here, we design colloidal active rods capable of modulating their inner activity in response to crowding, thereby enforcing a primitive form of quorum sensing interactions. Through experiments, simulations and theory we elucidate the impact of these interactions on the phase behavior of isotropic active matter. We demonstrate that, when conditioned to density, motility regulation can either lead to an absorbing phase transition, where all particles freeze their dynamics, or to atypical phase separation, where flat interfaces supporting a net pressure drop are in mechanical equilibrium. Fully active and fully arrested particles can then form heterogeneous patterns ruled by the competition between quorum sensing and mechanical interactions. Beyond the specifics of motile colloids, we expect our findings to apply broadly to adaptive active matter assembled from living or synthetic units.

Title: Local and Non-local Entanglement Witnesses of Fermi Liquid
Authors: Yiming Wang, Yuan Fang, Fang Xie, Qimiao Si
Abstract: There is a growing interest both in utilizing entanglement means to characterize many-body systems and in uncovering their entanglement depth. Motivated by recent findings that the spin quantum Fisher information witnesses amplified multipartite entanglement of strange metals and characterizes their loss of quasiparticles, we study the quantum Fisher information in various cases of Fermi liquid. We show that local operators generically do not witness any multipartite entanglement in a Fermi liquid, but non-local many-body operators do. Our results point to novel experimental means to detect the entanglement depth of metallic fermionic systems and, in general, open a new avenue to the emerging exploration of entanglement in quantum materials.

Title: Extended $s$-wave pairing from an emergent Feshbach resonanc in bilayer nickelate superconductors
Authors: Pietro Borchia, Hannah Lange, Fabian Grusdt
Abstract: Since the discovery of unconventional superconductivity in cuprates, unraveling the pairing mechanism of charge carriers in doped antiferromagnets has been a long-standing challenge. Motivated by the discovery of high-T$_c$ superconductivity in nickelate bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ (LNO), we study a minimal mixed dimensional (MixD) $t-J$ model supplemented with a repulsive Coulomb interaction $V$. When hole-doped, previous numerical simulations revealed that the system exhibits strong binding energies, with a phenomenology resembling a BCS-to-BEC crossover accompanied by a Feshbach resonance between two distinct types of charge carriers. Here, we perform a mean-field analysis that enables a direct observation of the BCS-to-BEC crossover as well as microscopic insights into the crossover region and the pairing symmetry for two-dimensional bilayers. We benchmark our mean-field description by comparing it to density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations in quasi-one dimensional settings and find remarkably good agreement. For the two-dimensional system relevant to LNO our mean-field calculations predict a BCS pairing gap with an extended $s$-wave symmetry, directly resulting from the pairing mechanism's Feshbach-origin. Our analysis hence gives insights into pairing in unconventional superconductors and, further, can be tested in currently available ultracold atom experiments.

Title: Generative Topology Optimization: Exploring Diverse Solutions in Structural Design
Authors: Andreas Radler, Eric Volkmann, Johannes Brandstetter, Arturs Berzins
Abstract: Topology optimization (TO) is a family of computational methods that derive near-optimal geometries from formal problem descriptions. Despite their success, established TO methods are limited to generating single solutions, restricting the exploration of alternative designs. To address this limitation, we introduce Generative Topology Optimization (GenTO) - a data-free method that trains a neural network to generate structurally compliant shapes and explores diverse solutions through an explicit diversity constraint. The network is trained with a solver-in-the-loop, optimizing the material distribution in each iteration. The trained model produces diverse shapes that closely adhere to the design requirements. We validate GenTO on 2D and 3D TO problems. Our results demonstrate that GenTO produces more diverse solutions than any prior method while maintaining near-optimality and being an order of magnitude faster due to inherent parallelism. These findings open new avenues for engineering and design, offering enhanced flexibility and innovation in structural optimization.

Title: Conditional Mutual Information and Information-Theoretic Phases of Decohered Gibbs States
Authors: Yifan Zhang, Sarang Gopalakrishnan
Abstract: Classical and quantum Markov networks -- including Gibbs states of commuting local Hamiltonians -- are characterized by the vanishing of conditional mutual information (CMI) between spatially separated subsystems. Adding local dissipation to a Markov network turns it into a \emph{hidden Markov network}, in which CMI is not guaranteed to vanish even at long distances. The onset of long-range CMI corresponds to an information-theoretic mixed-state phase transition, with far-ranging implications for teleportation, decoding, and state compressions. Little is known, however, about the conditions under which dissipation can generate long-range CMI. In this work we provide the first rigorous results in this direction. We establish that CMI in high-temperature Gibbs states subject to local dissipation decays exponentially, (i) for classical Hamiltonians subject to arbitrary local transition matrices, and (ii) for commuting local Hamiltonians subject to unital channels that obey certain mild restrictions. Conversely, we show that low-temperature hidden Markov networks can sustain long-range CMI. Our results establish the existence of finite-temperature information-theoretic phase transitions even in models that have no finite-temperature thermodynamic phase transitions. We also show several applications in quantum information and many-body physics.

Title: Unveiling a Hidden Percolation Transition in Monitored Clifford Circuits: Inroads from ZX-Calculus
Authors: Einat Buznach, Debanjan Chowdhury, Jonathan Ruhman
Abstract: We revisit the measurement-induced phase transition (MPT) in Clifford circuits, which are both classically simulable and exhibit critical behavior widely believed to be distinct from classical percolation theory, using ZX-calculus. We analyze the MPT in a dynamical model composed of CNOT, SWAP, identity gates, and Bell-pair measurements, respectively, arranged randomly in a brickwork pattern. Our circuits exhibit a transition that is seemingly distinct from classical percolation based on standard arguments, that is in line with the prevailing understanding in the field. In contrast, by employing ZX-calculus based simplification techniques, we unveil a hidden percolation transition within the circuit structure. Over a range of parameters tied to the probabilities for applying different gates, we demonstrate that the classical percolation transition in the ZX-simplified network coincides with the MPT observed through mutual information. Our findings suggest that the MPT in Clifford circuits is, in fact, controlled by a classical percolation transition in disguise.

Title: Entanglement and private information in many-body thermal states
Authors: Samuel J. Garratt, Max McGinley
Abstract: Using concepts from quantum cryptography, we show how entanglement in many-body mixed states is reflected in standard correlation functions. Focusing on systems in thermal equilibrium with an environment, we ask whether the entanglement in the system can be used as a resource for distilling private keys -- random classical bits that are shared by spatially separated observers but hidden from an eavesdropper having access to the environment. Since private keys cannot be generated using separable states, we can infer the presence of entanglement from the success of such protocols. We derive a simple relation between the information accessible to the eavesdropper and the linear response of the system. This relation allows us to determine which spatial correlations can be used to detect entanglement across wide varieties of physical systems, and provides a new experimental probe of entanglement. We also show that strong symmetries of a density matrix imply the existence of correlations that are always hidden from the environment. This result implies that, although grand canonical ensembles are separable above a finite temperature, canonical ensembles are generically entangled at all finite temperatures.

Title: Breaking the bonds of generative artificial intelligence by minimizing the maximum entropy
Authors: Mattia Miotto, Lorenzo Monacelli
Abstract: The emergence of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), comprising large language models, text-to-image generators, and AI algorithms for medical drug and material design, had a transformative impact on society. However, despite an initial exponential growth surpassing Moore's law, progress is now plateauing, suggesting we are approaching the limits of current technology. Indeed, these models are notoriously data-hungry, prone to overfitting, and challenging to direct during the generative process, hampering their effective professional employment. To cope with these limitations, we propose a paradigm shift in GenAI by introducing an ab initio method based on the minimal maximum entropy principle. Our approach does not fit the data. Instead, it compresses information in the training set by finding a latent representation parameterized by arbitrary nonlinear functions, such as neural networks. The result is a general physics-driven model, which is data-efficient, resistant to overfitting, and flexible, permitting to control and influence the generative process. Benchmarking shows that our method outperforms variational autoencoders (VAEs) with similar neural architectures, particularly on undersampled datasets. We demonstrate the methods effectiveness in generating images, even with limited training data, and its unprecedented capability to customize the generation process a posteriori without the need of any fine-tuning or retraining.

Title: Elucidating balling mechanism in laser melting of tantalum using in-situ X-ray imaging
Authors: Zane Taylor, Tharun Reddy, Maureen Fitzpatrick, Kwan Kim, Wei Li, Chu Lun Alex Leung, Peter D. Lee, Kaila M. Bertsch, Leora Dresselhaus-Marais
Abstract: In the laser welding and additive manufacturing (AM) communities, the balling defect is primarily attributed to the action of fluid instabilities with a few authors suggesting other mechanisms. Without commenting on the validity of the fluid instability driven \textit{mechanism} of balling in AM, this work intends to present the most realistic analytical discussion of the balling defect driven purely by fluid instabilities. Synchrotron-based X-ray radiography of thin samples indicate that fluid instability growth rates and solidification can be comparable in magnitude and thus compete. Neglecting the action of fluid flows and heat transport, this work presents an analytical formalism which accounts for fluid instabilities and solidification competition, giving a continuous transition from balling to non-balling which is lacking in current literature. We adapt a Rivulet instability model from the fluid physics community to account for the stabilizing effects of the substrate which the Plateau-Rayleigh instability model does not account for, and estimate the instability growth rate. Our model predicts instability growth at higher wavelengths and shallower melt pool depths relative to width, as well as strong sensitivity to the solidification front curvature. Deviations between model predictions and our experimental results demonstrate the importance of fluid flows and heat transport in the balling process. Our experiments further demonstrate at least one mechanism by which the melt pool length and balling wavelength are not equivalent, as commonly claimed.

Title: Relaxation Critical Dynamics in Measurement-induced Phase Transitions
Authors: Wantao Wang, Shuo Liu, Jiaqiang Li, Shi-Xin Zhang, Shuai Yin
Abstract: Measurement-induced phase transition (MIPT) describes the nonanalytical change of the entanglement entropy resulting from the interplay between measurement and unitary evolution. In this paper, we investigate the relaxation critical dynamics near the MIPT for different initial states in a one-dimensional quantum circuit. Specifically, when the initial state is in the volume-law phase with vanishing measurement probability, we find that the half-chain entanglement entropy $S$ decays as $S\propto t^{-1}$ with the coefficients proportional to the size of the system in the short-time stage; In contrast, when the initial state is the product state, $S$ increases with time as $S\propto \ln{t}$, consistent with previous studies. Despite these contrasting behaviors, we develop a unified scaling form to describe these scaling behaviors for different initial states where the off-critical-point effects can also be incorporated. This framework offers significant advantages for experimental MIPT detection. Our novel scheme, leveraging relaxation dynamical scaling, drastically reduces post-selection overhead, and can eliminate it completely with trackable classical simulation.

Title: Enhancing Machine Learning Potentials through Transfer Learning across Chemical Elements
Authors: Sebastien Röcken, Julija Zavadlav
Abstract: Machine Learning Potentials (MLPs) can enable simulations of ab initio accuracy at orders of magnitude lower computational cost. However, their effectiveness hinges on the availability of considerable datasets to ensure robust generalization across chemical space and thermodynamic conditions. The generation of such datasets can be labor-intensive, highlighting the need for innovative methods to train MLPs in data-scarce scenarios. Here, we introduce transfer learning of potential energy surfaces between chemically similar elements. Specifically, we leverage the trained MLP for silicon to initialize and expedite the training of an MLP for germanium. Utilizing classical force field and ab initio datasets, we demonstrate that transfer learning surpasses traditional training from scratch in force prediction, leading to more stable simulations and improved temperature transferability. These advantages become even more pronounced as the training dataset size decreases. The out-of-target property analysis shows that transfer learning leads to beneficial but sometimes adversarial effects. Our findings demonstrate that transfer learning across chemical elements is a promising technique for developing accurate and numerically stable MLPs, particularly in a data-scarce regime.

Title: On dimensions of (2+1)D abelian bosonic topological systems on unoriented manifolds
Authors: Ippo Orii
Abstract: We give a framework to describe abelian bosonic topological systems with parity symmetry on a torus in terms of the representation of $GL(2,\bZ)$. However, this information alone does not guarantee that we can assign Hilbert spaces to unoriented surfaces in a way compatible with the gluing axiom of topological quantum field theory. Here, we show that we can assign Hilbert spaces with integer dimensions to unoriented surfaces in the case of abelian bosonic topological systems with time-reversal symmetry.

Abstract: Physical characteristics of Cu$_2$Te are poorly investigated due to limited Te sources available and unclear atomic positions of crystal structure. Herein, hexagonal Cu$_2$Te microdisks are successfully prepared via chemical vapor deposition procedure using GaTe as Te source. The epitaxial growth mechanism of the Cu$_2$Te hexagonal structures with the orthorhombic phase are rationalized by proposed layer-over-layer growth model. The photoluminescence (PL) spectrum of Cu$_2$Te microdisks shows a new red emission band in addition to usual infrared light emission due to Cu deficiency. Single Cu$_2$Te microdisk operates as an optical microcavity supporting whispering gallery modes for red lasing around 627.5 nm. This Cu$_2$Te microdisk microcavity exhibits a high quality factor of 1568 and a low lasing threshold of 125 kW cm$^{-2}$ at room temperature. Meanwhile, Cu$_2$Te microdisks have been exhibited as an ideal platform for surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) eliminating drawbacks of noble metal substrates with detection limitation to nanomolar level and an enhancement factor of $\sim$1.95$\times$10$^5$. Hexagonal Cu$_2$Te microdisks turn out to be an efficient microcavity for red lasing and low-cost nonmetallic SERS substrates, opening potential applications in photonics and biological detection of aromatic molecules.

Title: Models of liquid samples confinement for nanoscale NMR
Authors: Santiago Oviedo Casado, Daniel Cohen, Javier Cerrillo
Abstract: Diffusion is a prominent source of noise affecting nuclear magnetic resonance at the nanometer scale (nano-NMR), preventing high resolution studies of unpolarized liquid samples. Actively managing diffusion noise through, for example, sample confinement, is likely to unveil alternative noise sources which so far have been disregarded, as they occur in longer time-scales and are, consequently, masked by diffusion. These secondary noise sources could diminish the advantages provided by sample confinement but, on the other hand, they can provide with valuable information about the behavior of the sample and its interactions. In this article, we study for the first time and in detail two noise models for confined nano-NMR, namely, surface interactions and porosity, and discuss their implications for typical nano-NMR experiments.

Title: Probing the ideal limit of interfacial thermal conductance in two-dimensional van der Waals heterostructures
Authors: Ting Liang, Ke Xu, Penghua Ying, Wenwu Jiang, Meng Han, Xin Wu, Wengen Ouyang, Yimin Yao, Xiaoliang Zeng, Zhenqiang Ye, Zheyong Fan, Jianbin Xu
Abstract: Probing the ideal limit of interfacial thermal conductance (ITC) in two-dimensional (2D) heterointerfaces is of paramount importance for assessing heat dissipation in 2D-based nanoelectronics. Using graphene/hexagonal boron nitride (Gr/$h$-BN), a structurally isomorphous heterostructure with minimal mass contrast, as a prototype, we develop an accurate yet highly efficient machine-learned potential (MLP) model, which drives nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations on a realistically large system with over 300,000 atoms, enabling us to report the ideal limit range of ITC for 2D heterostructures at room temperature. We further unveil an intriguing stacking-sequence-dependent ITC hierarchy in the Gr/$h$-BN heterostructure, which can be connected to moiré patterns and is likely universal in van der Waals layered materials. The underlying atomic-level mechanisms can be succinctly summarized as energy-favorable stacking sequences facilitating out-of-plane phonon energy transmission. This work demonstrates that MLP-driven MD simulations can serve as a new paradigm for probing and understanding thermal transport mechanisms in 2D heterostructures and other layered materials.

Title: Emergence of ecological structure and species rarity from fluctuating metabolic strategies
Authors: Davide Zanchetta, Deepak Gupta, Sofia Moschin, Samir Suweis, Amos Maritan, Sandro Azaele
Abstract: Ecosystems often demonstrate the coexistence of numerous species competing for limited resources, with pronounced rarity and abundance patterns. A potential driver of such coexistence is environmental fluctuations that favor different species over time. However, how to include and treat such temporal variability in existing consumer-resource models is still an open problem. In this study, we examine the role of correlated temporal fluctuations in metabolic strategies within a stochastic consumer-resource framework, reflecting change of species behavior in response to the environment. In some conditions, we are able to solve analytically the species abundance distributions, through path integral formalism. Our results reveal that stochastic dynamic metabolic strategies induce community structures that align more closely with empirical ecological observations and contribute to the violation of the Competitive Exclusion Principle (CEP). The degree of CEP violation is maximized under intermediate competition strength, leading to an intermediate competition hypothesis. Furthermore, when non-neutral effects are present, maximal biodiversity is achieved for intermediate values of the amplitude of fluctuations. This work not only challenges traditional ecological paradigms, but also establishes a robust theoretical framework for exploring how temporal dynamics and stochasticity drive biodiversity and community.

Title: Combined Light Excitation and Scanning Gate Microscopy on Heterostructure Nanowire Photovoltaic Devices
Authors: Yen-Po Liu, Jonatan Fast, Yang Chen, Ren Zhe, Adam Burke, Rainer Timm, Heiner Linke, Anders Mikkelsen
Abstract: Nanoscale optoelectronic components achieve functionality via spatial variation in electronic structure induced by composition, defects, and dopants. To dynamically change the local band alignment and influence defect states, a scanning gate electrode is highly useful. However, this technique is rarely combined with photoexcitation by a controlled external light source. We explore a setup that combines several types of light excitation with high resolution scanning gate and atomic force microscopy (SGM/AFM). We apply the technique to InAs nanowires with an atomic scale defined InP segment, that have attracted considerable attention for studies of hot carrier devices. Using AFM we image the topography of the nanowire device. SGM measurements without light excitation show how current profiles can be influenced by local gating near the InP segment. Modelling of the tip and nanowire can well predict the results based on the axial band structure variation and an asymmetric tip. SGM studies including light excitation are then performed using both a white light LED and laser diodes at 515 and 780nm. Both negative and positive photoconductance can be observed and the combined effect of light excitation and local gating is observed. SGM can then be used to discriminate between effects related to the wire axial compositional structure and surface states. The setup explored in the current work has significant advantages to study optoelectronics at realistic conditions and with rapid turnover.

Title: Holographic central charge for double scaled SYK
Authors: Paramesh Mahapatra, Hemant Rathi, Dibakar Roychowdhury
Abstract: In this paper, we calculate the holographic central charge ($c_{sDG}$) associated with sine dilaton gravity in the semiclassical limit. Following the standard holographic folklore, this should correspond to the central charge associated with a $q$ Schwarzian quantum mechanical model in the double scaling limit. In the low energy limit, the gravity description flows into the ordinary JT gravity which is a conjectured dual of ordinary Schwarzian quantum mechanics at strong coupling. We compute the associated central charge ($c_{JT}$), which reveals $c_{sDG}>c_{JT}$. We identify this as an artifact of the UV completion of JT gravity in terms of sine dilaton gravity.

Title: Diagnosing chaos with projected ensembles of process tensors
Authors: Peter O'Donovan, Neil Dowling, Kavan Modi, Mark T. Mitchison
Abstract: The process tensor provides a general representation of a quantum system evolving under repeated interventions and is fundamental for numerical simulations of local many-body dynamics. In this work, we introduce the projected process ensemble, an ensemble of pure output states of a process tensor in a given basis of local interventions, and use it to define increasingly more fine-grained probes of quantum chaos. The first moment of this ensemble encapsulates numerous previously studied chaos quantifiers, including the Alicki-Fannes quantum dynamical entropy, butterfly flutter fidelity, and spatiotemporal entanglement. We discover characteristic entanglement structures within the ensemble's higher moments that can sharply distinguish chaotic from integrable dynamics, overcoming deficiencies of the quantum dynamical and spatiotemporal entropies. These conclusions are supported by extensive numerical simulations of many-body dynamics for a range of spin-chain models, including non-interacting, interacting-integrable, chaotic, and many-body localized regimes. Our work elucidates the fingerprints of chaos on spatiotemporal correlations in quantum stochastic processes, and provides a unified framework for analyzing the complexity of unitary and monitored many-body dynamics.

Title: Spatially Encoded Polaritonic Ultra-Strong Coupling in Gradient Metasurfaces with Epsilon-Near-Zero Modes
Authors: Enrico Bau, Andreas Aigner, Jonas Biechteler, Connor Heimig, Thorsten Goelz, Stefan A. Maier, Andreas Tittl
Abstract: Ultra-strong coupling (USC) is a light-matter interaction regime characterized by coupling strengths that substantially exceed the threshold for strong coupling. It gives rise to novel physical phenomena, such as efficient single-photon coupling and quantum gates, with applications in quantum sensing, nonlinear optics, and low-threshold lasing. Although early demonstrations in plasmonic systems have been realized, achieving USC in dielectric nanophotonic platforms, which offer lower losses and high Q-factors, remains challenging due to typically low mode overlap between the photonic field and the material resonance. Here, we demonstrate ultra-strong coupling to an epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) mode in an ultra-thin SiO$_2$ layer. Our approach leverages a dielectric dual-gradient metasurface supporting quasi-bound-states-in-the-continuum (qBIC) consisting of two tapered bars in each unit cell that generate strong out-of-plane electric fields which overlap exceptionally well with those of the ENZ mode. Using dual gradients to encode both the spectral and coupling parameter space, we track the anticrossing behaviour of this coupled system with high experimental precision, revealing a mode splitting equivalent to 19% of the ENZ mode energy; a four-to-five-fold increase compared to previous approaches. Furthermore, varying the position of the SiO$_2$ layer allows for deliberate control of the mode overlap and the coupling between the qBIC and either the ENZ mode or the transverse optical (TO) phonon can be selectively tuned. This allows us to experimentally create an USC three-resonator system, opening new possibilities for compact and scalable polaritonic devices for sensing and nonlinear optics.

Title: Planted vertex cover problem on regular random graphs and nonmonotonic temperature-dependence in the supercooled region
Authors: Xin-Yi Fan, Hai-Jun Zhou
Abstract: We introduce a planted vertex cover problem on regular random graphs and study it by the cavity method of statistical mechanics. Different from conventional Ising models, the equilibrium ferromagnetic phase transition of this binary-spin two-body interaction system is discontinuous, as the paramagnetic phase is separated from the ferromagnetic phase by an extensive free energy barrier. The free energy landscape can be distinguished into three different types depending on the two degree parameters of the planted graph. The critical inverse temperatures at which the paramagnetic phase becomes locally unstable towards the ferromagnetic phase ($\beta_{\textrm{pf}}$) and towards spin glass phases ($\beta_{\textrm{pg}}$) satisfy $\beta_{\textrm{pf}} > \beta_{\textrm{pg}}$, $\beta_{\textrm{pf}} < \beta_{\textrm{pg}}$ and $\beta_{\textrm{pf}} = \beta_{\textrm{pg}}$, respectively, in these three landscapes. A locally stable anti-ferromagnetic phase emerges in the free energy landscape if $\beta_{\textrm{pf}} < \beta_{\textrm{pg}}$. When exploring the free energy landscape by stochastic local search dynamics, we find that in agreement with our theoretical prediction, the first-passage time from the paramagnetic phase to the ferromagnetic phase is nonmonotonic with the inverse temperature. The potential relevance of the planted vertex cover model to supercooled glass-forming liquids is briefly discussed.

Title: High-dimensional manifold of solutions in neural networks: insights from statistical physics
Authors: Enrico M. Malatesta
Abstract: In these pedagogic notes I review the statistical mechanics approach to neural networks, focusing on the paradigmatic example of the perceptron architecture with binary an continuous weights, in the classification setting. I will review the Gardner's approach based on replica method and the derivation of the SAT/UNSAT transition in the storage setting. Then, I discuss some recent works that unveiled how the zero training error configurations are geometrically arranged, and how this arrangement changes as the size of the training set increases. I also illustrate how different regions of solution space can be explored analytically and how the landscape in the vicinity of a solution can be characterized. I give evidence how, in binary weight models, algorithmic hardness is a consequence of the disappearance of a clustered region of solutions that extends to very large distances. Finally, I demonstrate how the study of linear mode connectivity between solutions can give insights into the average shape of the solution manifold.

Title: Residual entropy from temperature incremental Monte Carlo method
Authors: Zenan Dai, Xiao Yan Xu
Abstract: Residual entropy, which reflects the degrees of freedom in a system at absolute zero temperature, is crucial for understanding quantum and classical ground states. Despite its key role in explaining low-temperature phenomena and ground state degeneracy, accurately measuring residual entropy remains a difficult task owing to computational limitations. In this Letter, we introduce the temperature incremental Monte Carlo (TIMC) method, our approach to overcoming these challenges. The TIMC method incrementally calculates the partition function ratio of neighboring temperatures within Monte Carlo simulations, enabling precise entropy calculations and revealing other temperature-dependent properties in a single computational sweep of temperatures. We have rogorously tested TIMC on several complex systems, including the frustrated antiferromagnetic Ising model on both C60 and 2D triangular lattices, the Newman-Moore glassy model, and a 2D quantum transverse field Ising model. Notably, our method overcomes the difficulties encountered in partition function measurements when mapping $d$-dimensional quantum models to $d+1$-dimensional classical counterparts. These challenges arise from singular interactions that emerge in the small $\Delta_\tau$ limit during the quantum-to-classical mapping procedure. The TIMC method enables precise entropy calculations across the entire temperature range, as demonstrated in our studies of frustrated spin models, glassy phases, and phases exhibiting spontaneous symmetry breaking. This method's capability to calculate residual entropy could provide insights when applied to systems lacking analytical solutions.

Title: Multifunctional composite magnet realizing record-high transverse thermoelectric generation
Authors: Fuyuki Ando, Takamasa Hirai, Abdulkareem Alasli, Hossein Sepehri-Amin, Yutaka Iwasaki, Hosei Nagano, Ken-ichi Uchida
Abstract: Permanent magnets are used in various products and essential for human society. If omnipresent permanent magnets could directly convert heat into electricity, they would lead to innovative energy harvesting and thermal management technologies. However, achieving such "multifunctionality" has been difficult due to poor thermoelectric performance of conventional magnets. In this work, we develop a multifunctional composite magnet (MCM) that enables giant transverse thermoelectric conversion while possessing permanent magnet features. MCM comprising alternately and obliquely stacked SmCo$_{5}$/Bi$_{0.2}$Sb$_{1.8}$Te$_{3}$ multilayers exhibits an excellent transverse thermoelectric performance at room temperature by optimizing its anisotropic structure. Owing to the extremely low interfacial electrical and thermal resistivities, the experimentally determined figure of merit $z_{\rm xy}T$ reaches 0.20 close to the analytically calculated ideal value. The MCM-based thermopile module generates 204 mW in maximum at a temperature difference of 152 K, whose power density normalized by heat transfer area and temperature gradient is not only record-high among transverse thermoelectric modules but also comparable to that of commercial thermoelectric modules utilizing the Seebeck effect. The multifunctionality of our MCM provides unprecedented opportunities for energy harvesting and thermal management everywhere permanent magnets are currently used.

Title: Learning Neural Free-Energy Functionals with Pair-Correlation Matching
Authors: Jacobus Dijkman, Marjolein Dijkstra, René van Roij, Max Welling, Jan-Willem van de Meent, Bernd Ensing
Abstract: The intrinsic Helmholtz free-energy functional, the centerpiece of classical density functional theory, is at best only known approximately for 3D systems. Here we introduce a method for learning a neuralnetwork approximation of this functional by exclusively training on a dataset of radial distribution functions, circumventing the need to sample costly heterogeneous density profiles in a wide variety of external potentials. For a supercritical Lennard-Jones system with planar symmetry, we demonstrate that the learned neural free-energy functional accurately predicts inhomogeneous density profiles under various complex external potentials obtained from simulations.

Title: Altermagnetism and superconductivity in a multiorbital t-J model
Authors: Anjishnu Bose, Samuel Vadnais, Arun Paramekanti
Abstract: Motivated by exploring doped multi-orbital antiferromagnets (AFMs) and altermagnets (ALMs) we explore minimal $t$-$J$ models on the square-octagon lattice which favor such collinear magnetic orders in the regime where spin exchange dominates. While the AFM order breaks translational and time-reversal symmetries, the ALM state (equivalently, a `$d$-wave ferromagnet') features multipolar order which separately breaks time-reversal and crystal rotation symmetries but preserves their product leading to spin-split bands with zero net magnetization. We study the mean field phase diagram of these models as we vary doping and interactions, discovering regimes of weak and strong ALM order, superconductivity including uniform $s$-wave and $d$-wave pairing states, incipient $d$-wave pair density wave order, and phases with coexisting singlet-triplet pairing and AFM/ALM orders which appear unstable to phase separation and could host stripe order with longer-range interactions. We study the mean field phase diagram of these multiorbital models as we vary doping and interactions, discovering two types of ALM order: (i) itinerant weak-coupling ALM metals driven by quasi-1D van Hove singularities, as well as (ii) strong ALM order at half-filling. We also find regimes of superconductivity including uniform $s$-wave and $d$-wave pairing states, incipient $d_{xy}$-wave pair density wave order, and uniform phases with coexisting singlet-triplet pairing and ALM order. Our inhomogeneous mean field theory approach reveals that the coexistence phases are unstable to phase separation, but longer-range interactions could lead to stripe order. Our results may be relevant to doping or pressure studies of multiorbital ALM materials.

Title: Thermodynamic Phase Transitions of Nematic Order in Magnetic Helices

Abstract: A nematic phase lacks translation order but possesses orientational order. Nematic phases have been discovered in a variety of systems, including liquid crystals, correlated materials, and superconductors. Here, we report on a magnetic nematic phase, where the basis components are comprised of magnetic helices. We directly probed the order parameters associated with the magnetic helices using resonant soft X-ray scattering and find two distinct nematic phases with complex spatio-temporal signatures. Using X-ray correlation spectroscopy, we find that near the phase boundary between the two nematic phases, fluctuations coexist on multiple disparate timescales. Our micromagnetic simulations and density functional theory calculations show that the fluctuations occur concomitantly with a reorientation of the magnetic helices, indicating spontaneous symmetry breaking and the emergence of new degrees of freedom. Our results provide a framework for characterizing exotic phases that can be extended to a broad class of physical systems.

Title: Cattaneo--type subdiffusion equation
Authors: Tadeusz Kosztołowicz, Aldona Dutkiewicz, Katarzyna D. Lewandowska
Abstract: The ordinary subdiffusion equation, with fractional time derivatives of at most first order, describes a process in which the propagation velocity of diffusing molecules is unlimited. To avoid this non-physical property the Cattaneo diffusion equation has been proposed. Compared to the ordinary subdiffusion equation, the Cattaneo equation contains an additional time derivative of order greater than one and less than or equal to two. The fractional order of the additional derivative depends on the subdiffusion exponent. We study a Cattaneo-type subdiffusion equation (CTSE) that differs from the ordinary subdiffusion equation by an additional integro--differential operator (AO) which may be independent of subdiffusion parameters. The AO describes processes affecting ordinary subdiffusion. The equation is derived combining the modified diffusive flux equation with the continuity equation. It can also be obtained within the continuous time random walk model with the waiting time distribution for the molecule to jump controlled by the kernel of AO. We discuss whether the ordinary subdiffusion equation and CTSE provide qualitative differences in the description of subdiffusion. For example, we consider two types of CTSE: the CTSE with AO which is the Caputo fractional time derivative of the order independent of the subdiffusion exponent and with the AO with a kernel that is a slowly varying function. In the first case the effect generated by AO disappears relatively quickly over time. In the second one the effect may be visible for a long time.

Title: Robust non-Abelian even-denominator fractional Chern insulator in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$
Authors: Feng Chen, Wei-Wei Luo, Wei Zhu, D. N. Sheng
Abstract: A recent experiment observes a series of quantum spin Hall effects in transition metal dichalcogenide moiré MoTe$_2$ [K. Kang, et. al, Nature 628, 522-526 (2024)]. Among them, the vanishing Hall signal at the filling factor $\nu=3$ implies a possible realization of a time-reversal pair of the even-denominator fractional Chern insulators (FCIs). Inspired by this discovery, we investigate whether a robust incompressible quantum Hall liquid can be stabilized in the half-filled Chern band of twisted MoTe$_2$ bilayers. We use the continuum model with parameters relevant to twisted MoTe$_2$ bilayers and obtain three consecutive nearly flat Chern bands with the same Chern number. Crucially, when the second moiré miniband is half-filled,signatures of non-Abelian frctional quantum Hall state are found via exact diagonalization calculations, including the stable six-fold ground state degeneracy that grows more robust with the lattice size and is consistent with an even-denominator FCI state. We further perform flux insertion simulations to reveal a 1/2 quantized many-body Chern number as direct evidence of topological order. Furthermore, the ground state density structure factors show no sharp peak, indicating no charge density wave order. These evidences signal the potential of realizing the non-Abelian state at zero magnetic field in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ at the fractional hole filling 3/2.

Title: Heavy Fermions as an Efficient Representation of Atomistic Strain and Relaxation in Twisted Bilayer Graphene
Authors: Jonah Herzog-Arbeitman, Jiabin Yu, Dumitru Călugăru, Haoyu Hu, Nicolas Regnault, Oskar Vafek, Jian Kang, B. Andrei Bernevig
Abstract: Although the strongly interacting flat bands in twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) have been approached using the minimal Bistritzer-MacDonald (BM) Hamiltonian, there is mounting evidence that strain and lattice relaxation are essential in correctly determining the order of the correlated insulator groundstates. These effects can be incorporated in an enhanced continuum model by introducing additional terms computed from the relaxation profile. To develop an analytical and physical understanding of these effects, we include strain and relaxation in the topological heavy fermion (HF) model of TBG. We find that strain and relaxation are very well captured in first order perturbation theory by projection onto the fully symmetric HF Hilbert space, and remarkably do not alter the interacting terms in the periodic Anderson model. Their effects are fully incorporated in the single-particle HF Hamiltonian, and can be reproduced in a minimal model with only 4 symmetry-breaking terms. Our results demonstrate that the heavy fermion framework of TBG is an efficient and robust representation of the perturbations encountered in experiment.

Title: Origin of the density wave instability in trilayer nickelate La$_{4}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{10}$ revealed by optical and ultrafast spectroscopy
Authors: Shuxiang Xu, Cui-Qun Chen, Mengwu Huo, Deyuan Hu, Hao Wang, Qiong Wu, Rongsheng Li, Dong Wu, Meng Wang, Dao-Xin Yao, Tao Dong, Nanlin Wang
Abstract: In the intricate phase diagram of unconventional superconductors characterized by intertwined electronic orders and superconductivity, a key step in understanding the superconducting mechanism is to investigate the parent compounds from which superconductivity emerges through doping or pressure. In this study, we employed optical spectroscopy and ultrafast reflectivity measurements to examine the density wave instability in the trilayer nickelate La$_{4}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{10}$, which displays pressure-induced superconductivity up to 30 K. Our optical spectroscopy measurements reveal that La$_{4}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{10}$ behaves as a metal with a high plasma frequency. Upon cooling, we observed a distinct formation of a density wave energy gap in both optical conductivity and pump-probe measurements. The gap feature is more pronounced compared to the bilayer nickelate La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$. Through a comparison of the experimentally determined plasma frequency with first-principles calculations, we classify La$_{4}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{10}$ as a moderately electron-correlated material, resembling the parent compound of iron-based superconductors but exhibiting weaker correlation than the bilayer nickelate La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$. The enhanced gap feature and weaker electronic correlation in La$_{4}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{10}$ may explain its lower superconductivity transition temperature under high pressure. These findings significantly advance our comprehension of the density wave and superconductivity mechanisms in the trilayer nickelate La$_{4}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{10}$.

Title: Freezing, melting and the onset of glassiness in binary mixtures
Authors: Daniele Coslovich, Leonardo Galliano, Lorenzo Costigliola
Abstract: We clarify the relationship between freezing, melting, and the onset of glassy dynamics in a prototypical glass-forming mixture model. Our starting point is a precise operational definition of the onset of glassiness, as expressed by the emergence of inflections in time-dependent correlation functions. By scanning the temperature-composition phase diagram of the mixture, we find a disconnect between the onset of glassiness and freezing. Surprisingly, however, the onset temperature closely tracks the melting line, along which the excess entropy is approximately constant. At fixed composition, all characteristic temperatures display nonetheless similar pressure dependencies, which are very well predicted by the isomorph theory. While our results rule out a general connection between thermodynamic metastability and glassiness, they call for a reassessment of the role of crystalline precursors in glass-forming liquids.

Title: Emergent spinon-holon Feshbach resonance in a doped Majumdar-Ghosh model
Authors: Simon M. Linsel, Ulrich Schollwöck, Annabelle Bohrdt, Fabian Grusdt
Abstract: Experimental and numerical spectroscopy have revealed rich physics in antiferromagnets, in particular in frustrated and doped systems. The Majumdar-Ghosh (MG) model has an analytically known spin-disordered ground state of dimerized singlets as a result of magnetic frustration. Here we study the single-hole angle-resolved photoemission spectrum (ARPES) of a doped MG model, where we introduce a spin-hole interaction that is experimentally accessible with ultracold molecules. We report a bound spinon-holon ground state and clear signatures of a spinon-holon molecule state and polarons in the ARPES spectrum at different magnetizations. Moreover, we find signatures of an emergent Feshbach resonance with tunable interactions associated with the unbinding of the spinon and the holon. Our results provide new insights into the physics of dopants in frustrated $t$-$J$ models and establish the latter as a new platform for studies of emergent few-body phenomena.

Title: Effective Affinity for Generic Currents in Markov Processes
Authors: Adarsh Raghu, Izaak Neri
Abstract: In nonequilibrium systems with uncoupled currents, the thermodynamic affinity determines the direction of currents, quantifies dissipation, and constrains current fluctuations. However, these properties of the thermodynamic affinity do not hold in complex systems with multiple coupled currents. For this reason, there has been an ongoing search in nonequilibrium thermodynamics for an affinity-like quantity, known as the effective affinity, which applies to a single current in a system with multiple coupled currents. Here, we introduce an effective affinity that applies to generic currents in time-homogeneous Markov processes. We show that the effective affinity is a single number encapsulating several dissipative and fluctuation properties of fluctuating currents: the effective affinity determines the direction of flow of the current; the effective affinity multiplied by the current is a lower bound for the rate of dissipation; for systems with uncoupled currents the effective affinity equals the standard thermodynamic affinity; and the effective affinity constrains negative fluctuations of currents, namely, it is the exponential decay constant of the distribution of current infima. We derive the above properties with large deviation theory and martingale theory, and one particular interesting finding is a class of martingales associated with generic currents. Furthermore, we make a study of the relation between effective affinities and stalling forces in a biomechanical model of motor proteins, and we find that both quantities are approximately equal when this particular model is thermodynamically consistent. This brings interesting perspectives on the use of stalling forces for the estimation of dissipation.

Title: Universal scaling of Green's functions in disordered non-Hermitian systems
Authors: Yin-Quan Huang, Yu-Min Hu, Wen-Tan Xue, Zhong Wang
Abstract: The competition between non-Hermitian skin effect and Anderson localization leads to various intriguing phenomena concerning spectrums and wavefunctions. Here, we study the linear response of disordered non-Hermitian systems, which is precisely described by the Green's function. We show that the average maximum value of matrix elements of Green's functions, which quantifies the maximal response against an external perturbation, exhibits different phases characterized by different scaling behaviors with respect to the system size. Whereas the exponential-growth phase is also seen in the translation-invariant systems, the algebraic-growth phase is unique to disordered non-Hermitian systems. We explain the numerical findings using the large deviation theory, which provides analytical insights into the algebraic scaling factors of non-Hermitian disordered Green's functions. Furthermore, we show that these scaling behaviors can be observed in the steady states of disordered open quantum systems, offering a quantum-mechanical avenue for their experimental detection. Our work highlights an unexpected interplay between non-Hermitian skin effect and Anderson localization.

Title: Electron-phonon coupling and mobility modeling in organic semiconductors: method and application to tetracene polymorphs
Authors: Patrizio Graziosi, Raffaele Guido Della Valle, Tommaso Salzillo, Simone d'Agostino, Martina Zangari, Elisabetta Cane', Matteo Masino, Elisabetta Venuti
Abstract: We have developed a first-principles method to calculate the electron-phonon coupling for specific modes and q-points in the Brillouin Zone for crystalline organic semiconductors. Using the obtained coupling strengths, we propose an approach to compute the temperature-dependent mobilities of electrons and holes. This methodology is applied to both bulk and thin-film polymorphs of tetracene. To validate our treatment of the electronic structures and vibrational properties, we calculate the Raman spectra in the lattice-phonon region and compare them with experimental data. We then compare the computed mobilities with available data for single crystals, finding good agreement within the experimental range, especially when accounting for possible charged impurities. Finally, we discuss the observed differences between the polymorphs.

Title: Topological Defects in Semiconducting Carbon Nanotubes as Triplet Exciton Traps and Single-Photon Emitters
Authors: Timur Biktagirov, Uwe Gerstmann, Wolf Gero Schmidt
Abstract: We investigate the role of topological defects in exciton behavior in (6,5) semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes using density functional theory. Our study identifies the helical Stone-Wales defect as a prominent trap for triplet excitons, characterized by a large zero-field splitting consistent with experimental data and a small singlet-triplet gap. The weak electron-phonon coupling, as evidenced by a Huang-Rhys factor of 0.74, renders it a promising single-photon emitter, with the zero-phonon line predicted at 1.6 $\mu$m, within the telecom range. These insights into defect-engineered electronic structure and exciton dynamics offer promising opportunities for improving the performance of carbon nanotube-based quantum light sources and optoelectronic devices.

Title: Rheological regimes in agitated granular media under shear
Authors: Olfa D'Angelo, Matthias Sperl, W. Till Kranz
Abstract: Agitated granular media have a rich rheology: they exhibit Newtonian behavior at low shear rate and density, develop a yield stress at high density, and cross over to Bagnoldian shear thickening when sheared rapidly -- making them challenging to encompass in one theoretical framework. We measure the rheology of air-fluidized glass particles, spanning five orders of magnitude in shear rate. By comparing fluidization-induced to Brownian agitation, we show that all rheological regimes can be delineated by two dimensionless numbers -- the Peclet number, $\Pe$, and the ratio of shear-to-fluidization power, $\Pi$ -- and propose a constitutive relation that captures all flow behaviors, qualitatively and quantitatively, in one unified framework.

Title: Theoretical study of the crystal structure of the bilayer nickel oxychloride Sr$_3$Ni$_2$O$_5$Cl$_2$ and analysis of possible unconventional superconductivity
Authors: Masayuki Ochi, Hirofumi Sakakibara, Hidetomo Usui, Kazuhiko Kuroki
Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity under high pressure with $T_c$ exceeding 80 K in a bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has led to a strong desire to realize similar high $T_c$ phenomena at ambient pressure. As one possible path toward realizing superconductivity at ambient pressure, we here propose to consider Sr$_3$Ni$_2$O$_5$Cl$_2$ as a possible candidate. In this study, we theoretically investigate the electronic structure of Sr$_3$Ni$_2$O$_5$Cl$_2$ and its structural stability. Our phonon calculation shows that this compound with the $I4/mmm$ tetragonal structure is dynamically stable even at ambient pressure. The characteristic crystal field in this compound lowers the Ni-$d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbital energy, by which the Ni-$d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbital becomes rather closer to the half-filling in Sr$_3$Ni$_2$O$_5$Cl$_2$ than La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. As a result, we find that superconductivity is enhanced even though a relatively strong orbital hybridization between the $t_{2g}$ and $e_g$ orbitals is somewhat detrimental for superconductivity. We also check the formation enthalpy, which shows that the high-pressure synthesis can be a good way to actually produce Sr$_3$Ni$_2$O$_5$Cl$_2$. We find that Sr$_3$Ni$_2$O$_5$Cl$_2$ is a promising new candidate of bilayer-nickelate superconductors, which can possess even higher $T_c$ than pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, at ambient pressure.

Title: Multi-orbital two-particle self-consistent approach -- strengths and limitations
Authors: Jonas B. Profe, Jiawei Yan, Karim Zantout, Philipp Werner, Roser Valentí
Abstract: Extending many-body numerical techniques which are powerful in the context of simple model calculations to the realm of realistic material simulations can be a challenging task. Realistic systems often involve multiple active orbitals, which increases the complexity and numerical cost because of the large local Hilbert space and the large number of interaction terms or sign-changing off-diagonal Green's functions. The two-particle self-consistent approach (TPSC) is one such many-body numerical technique, for which multi-orbital extensions have proven to be involved due to the substantially more complex structure of the local interaction tensor. In this paper we extend earlier multi-orbital generalizations of TPSC by setting up two different variants of a fully self-consistent theory for TPSC in multi-orbital systems. We first investigate the strengths and limitations of the approach analytically and then benchmark both variants against dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) and D-TRILEX results. We find that the exact behavior of the system can be faithfully reproduced in the weak-coupling regime, while at stronger couplings the performance of the two TPSC variants strongly depends on details of the system.

Title: Megahertz cycling of ultrafast structural dynamics enabled by nanosecond thermal dissipation
Authors: Till Domröse, Leonardo da Camara Silva, Claus Ropers
Abstract: Light-matter interactions are of fundamental scientific and technological interest. Ultrafast electron microscopy and diffraction with combined femtosecond-nanometer resolution elucidate the laser-induced dynamics in structurally heterogeneous systems. These measurements, however, remain challenging due to the brightness limitation of pulsed electron sources, leading to an experimental trade-off between resolution and contrast. Larger signals can most directly be obtained by higher repetition rates, which, however, are typically limited to a few kHz by the thermal relaxation of thin material films. Here, we combine nanometric electron-beam probing with sample support structures tailored to facilitate rapid specimen cooling. Optical cycling of a charge-density wave transformation enables quantifying the mean temperature increase induced by pulsed laser illumination. Varying the excitation fluence and repetition rate, we gauge the impact of excitation confinement and efficient dissipation on the heat diffusion in different sample designs. In particular, a thermally optimized support can dissipate average laser intensities of up to 200 $\mu W/\mu m^2$ within a few nanoseconds, allowing for reversible driving and probing of the CDW transition at a repetition rate of 2 MHz. Sample designs tailored to ultrafast measurement schemes will thus extend the capabilities of electron diffraction and microscopy, enabling high-resolution investigations of structural dynamics.

Title: Variational formulation of dynamical electronic response functions in presence of nonlocal exchange interactions
Authors: Giovanni Caldarelli, Alberto Guandalini, Francesco Macheda, Francesco Mauri
Abstract: We consider the dynamical electronic response function in theoretical frameworks that include nonlocal exchange interactions, such as the Bethe-Salpeter equation with the frequency independent approximation of the screened interaction, Hartree-Fock, and range-separated Hybrid DFT approaches. Within these pictures, we demonstrate that any time-dependent electronic linear response function allows for a formulation which is variational in the electronic density matrix. To achieve our goal, we consider the usual form of a response function, written in terms of a screened and a bare electronic vertices (`bare-screen'), and perform an exact rewriting in terms of purely screened electronic vertices (`screen-screen'). Within the `screen-screen' formulation, the response function can be written as a stationary point of a functional of the exact density matrix. Further, we show that the imaginary part of any electronic response can be written in the form of a generalized Fermi Golden Rule, by introducing an exact complementary rewriting in terms of vertices related by complex conjugation (`screen*-screen'). The screen-screen formulation can be further extended partitioning the electronic interaction in separate contributions, expressing the response in terms of partially screened electronic vertices (`partial screen-partial screen'), preserving the stationary properties. We numerically validate the effectiveness of our formalism by calculating the optical conductivity of graphene, which exhibits strong excitonic effects. To do so, we solve the Bethe-Salpeter Equation on a tight-binding model, including exchange effects in the response of graphene. Our findings show the advantages of the variationality of the screen-screen formulation over the others both in convergence properties and robustness with density-matrix approximations.

Title: Hierarchy of degenerate stationary states in a boundary-driven dipole-conserving spin chain
Authors: Apoorv Srivastava, Shovan Dutta
Abstract: Kinetically constrained spin chains serve as a prototype for structured ergodicity breaking in isolated quantum systems. We show that such a system exhibits a hierarchy of degenerate steady states when driven by incoherent pump and loss at the boundary. By tuning the relative pump and loss and how local the constraints are, one can stabilize mixed steady states, noiseless subsystems, and various decoherence-free subspaces, all of which preserve large amounts of information. We also find that a dipole-conserving bulk suppresses current in steady state. These exact results based on the flow in Hilbert space hold regardless of the specific Hamiltonian or drive mechanism. Our findings show that a competition of kinetic constraints and local drives can induce different forms of ergodicity breaking in open systems, which should be accessible in quantum simulators.

Title: Latent Haldane Models
Authors: Anouar Moustaj, Lumen Eek, Malte Rontgen, Cristiane Morais Smith
Abstract: Latent symmetries, which materialize after performing isospectral reductions, have recently been shown to be instrumental in revealing novel topological phases in one-dimensional systems, among many other applications. In this work, we explore how to construct a family of seemingly complicated two-dimensional models that result in energy-dependent Haldane models upon performing an isospectral reduction. In these models, we find energy-dependent latent Semenoff masses without introducing a staggered on-site potential. In addition, energy-dependent latent Haldane masses also emerge in decorated lattices with nearest-neighbor complex hoppings. Using the Haldane model's properties, we then predict the location of the topological gaps in the aforementioned family of models and construct phase diagrams to determine where the topological phases lie in parameter space. This idea yielded, for instance, useful insights in the case of a modified version of $\alpha$-graphyne and hexagonal plaquettes with additional decorations, where the gap-closing energies can be calculated using the ISR to predict topological phase transitions.

Title: Single-boson exchange formulation of the Schwinger-Dyson equation and its application to the functional renormalization group
Authors: Miriam Patricolo, Marcel Gievers, Kilian Fraboulet, Aiman Al-Eryani, Sarah Heinzelmann, Pietro M. Bonetti, Alessandro Toschi, Demetrio Vilardi, Sabine Andergassen
Abstract: We extend the recently introduced single-boson exchange formulation to the computation of the self-energy from the Schwinger--Dyson equation (SDE). In particular, we derive its expression both in diagrammatic and in physical channels. The simple form of the single-boson exchange SDE, involving only the bosonic propagator and the fermion-boson vertex, but not the rest function, allows for an efficient numerical implementation. We furthermore discuss its implications in a truncated unity solver, where a restricted number of form factors introduces an information loss in the projection of the momentum dependence that in general affects the equivalence between the different channel representations. In the application to the functional renormalization group, we find that the convergence in the number of form factors depends on the channel representation of the SDE. For the two-dimensional Hubbard model at weak coupling, the pseudogap opening driven by antiferromagnetic fluctuations is captured already by a single ($s$-wave) form factor in the magnetic channel representation, differently to the density and superconducting channels.

Title: Possibility of BCS-BEC crossover in $κ$-type organic superconductors
Authors: Hiroshi Watanabe, Hiroaki Ikeda
Abstract: The realization of BCS-BEC crossover in superconductors, which smoothly connects Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory with Bose-Einstein Condensation (BEC) in fermion systems, is an intriguing recent topic in strongly correlated electron systems. The organic superconductor $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_4$Hg$_{2.89}$Br$_8$ ($\kappa$-HgBr) under pressure is one of the leading candidates, owing to its unique metallic spin-liquid nature and tunable electron correlation. We theoretically investigate the extended Hubbard model for $\kappa$-HgBr and discuss the possibility of the BCS-BEC crossover by systematically calculating superconducting correlation function, coherence length, superfluid weight, and chemical potential. Our findings show that the BCS-BEC crossover can be observed when competing phases, such as Mott insulators and charge and/or spin orders, are suppressed by appropriate hole doping. $\kappa$-HgBr is just the case because both the Mott insulating phase and magnetic orders are absent due to its nonstoichiometric Hg composition and geometrical frustration. We further propose that other $\kappa$-type organic superconductors could serve as potential candidates of the BCS-BEC crossover if their band fillings and degree of geometrical frustration are systematically tuned.

Title: Categorical Symmetries in Spin Models with Atom Arrays
Authors: Alison Warman, Fan Yang, Apoorv Tiwari, Hannes Pichler, Sakura Schafer-Nameki
Abstract: Categorical symmetries have recently been shown to generalize the classification of phases of matter, significantly broadening the traditional Landau paradigm. To test these predictions, we propose a simple spin chain model that encompasses all gapped phases and second-order phase transitions governed by the categorical symmetry $\mathsf{Rep}(D_8)$. This model not only captures the essential features of non-invertible phases but is also straightforward enough to enable practical realization. Specifically, we outline an implementation using neutral atoms trapped in optical tweezer arrays. Employing a dual-species setup and Rydberg blockade, we propose a digital simulation approach that can efficiently implement the many-body evolution in several nontrivial quantum phases.

Title: Linear-time classical approximate optimization of cubic-lattice classical spin glasses
Authors: Adil A. Gangat
Abstract: Computing low-energy configurations (i.e., approximate optimization) of classical spin glasses is of relevance to both condensed matter and combinatorial optimization. Recent theoretical work opens the possibility to make its time complexity with quantum annealing generically polynomial, and D-Wave experiments can now achieve approximate optimization of cubic-lattice classical Ising spin glasses with $\sim$$10^4$ spins. It is therefore timely to ask which short-range classical spin glasses are good candidates for demonstrating quantum advantage in the time complexity of heuristic approximate optimization. One intuition is to consider models with very rugged energy landscapes in configuration space. However, here we provide evidence that short-range classical spin glasses may be approximately optimized in linear time and space with a very simple deterministic tensor-network heuristic regardless of ruggedness. On the cubic lattice with up to 50$\times$50$\times$50 spins, we obtain energy errors of $\lesssim$3% for the $\pm J$ model used in recent D-Wave experiments, and $\lesssim$5% for much more rugged planted-solution instances. For cubic-lattice-Ising reductions of unweighted Max-Cut on random 3-regular graphs with up to 300 vertices, we find energy errors of $<$1% and approximation ratios of about 72-88%. These results inform the search for quantum advantage and suggest an efficient classical method for generating warm starts for other spin-glass optimization algorithms. Our algorithm is amenable to massive parallelization and may also allow for low-power, accelerated implementations with photonic matrix-multiplication hardware.

Title: Nonclassical dynamics of Néel vector and magnetization accompanied by THz and high-harmonic radiation from ultrafast-light-driven NiO antiferromagnet insulator
Authors: Federico Garcia-Gaitan, Adrian E. Feiguin, Branislav K. Nikolic
Abstract: Ultrafast-light-driven strongly correlated antiferromagnetic insulators, such as prototypical NiO with large energy gap 4 eV, have recently attracted experimental attention using either above-gap [K. Gillmeister et al., Nat. Commun. 11, 4095 (2020)] or subgap [H. Qiu et al., Nat. Phys. 17, 388 (2021)] energy photons that are of fundamental interest in far-from-equilibrium quantum matter or spintronic applications, respectively. In the latter context, emission of THz radiation is also observed from NiO/Pt bilayers, where heavy metal (HM) Pt introduces strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC). However, microscopic mechanisms of such emission remain obscure because spintronic THz emitters have been amply studied using FM/HM (FM-ferromagnetic metal of conventional type) bilayers, where ultrafast demagnetization takes place and is directly related to THz emission. Conversely, in NiO total magnetization is zero prior to the fs laser pulse (fsLP) application. Here we employ the two-orbital Hubbard-Hund-Heisenberg model and study, via numerically exact nonequilibrium quantum many-body methods, the dynamics of its Neel vector and nonequilibrium magnetization. Additionally, we compute electromagnetic radiation by both time-dependent magnetization and local charge currents arising in either plain NiO or NiO with proximity SOC introduced by HM layer. Our analysis reveals nonclassical dynamics of Neel vector and nonequilibrium magnetization, changing only in length while not rotating, where the former is substantially reduced only in the case above-gap fsLP. In the plain NiO case, THz radiation of interest to applications is insignificant, but adding SOC enhances both current and magnetic dipole contributions to it. Above THz range, we find integer high-harmonic generation, as well as unusual noninteger harmonics for above-gap fsLP pump.

Title: Altermagnetizing the FeSe-like two-dimensional materials and approaching to giant tunneling magnetoresistance with Janus Cr4BN(B2) MBene electrode
Authors: Weiwei Sun, Mingzhuang Wang, Baisheng Sa, Shaui Dong, Carmine Autieri
Abstract: Altermagnetism is an emerging series of unconventional magnetic materials characterized by time-reversal symmetry breaking and spin-split bands in the momentum space with zero net magnetization. Metallic altermagnets offer unique advantages for exploring applications in spintronics as conductive metals allows for serving as electrode in magnetic tunneling junction (MTJ) and/or manipulation of spincurrent through external field. Through density functional theory calculations, the 2D altermagnet Cr4B3N was predicted to be stable, resulting from a N atom substitution in the FeSe-like CrB bilayer. Both intra- and inter-layered magnetic exchanges between Cr atoms are in antiferromagnetic with the first three neighbours. Leveraging the anisotropic spin-splittings with momentum dependency revealed in band structure, we designed three edge dependent Cr4B3N/square/Cr4B3N in-plane MTJs with the 7 Åvaccume the barrie. We found that the Cr-B vertical edge-assembled electrodes based MTJs exhibited giant tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) ratios of 91001% , by aligning the conduction channels of the electrodes in parallel and anti-parallel states in the momentum space. Our work deepens and generalizes understanding toward altermagnetic 2D metallic electrode with a newly established metal boride (MBene), and broadens applications of the nanoscale spintronics.

Title: Thermodynamic entropic uncertainty relation
Authors: Yoshihiko Hasegawa, Tomohiro Nishiyama
Abstract: Thermodynamic uncertainty relations reveal a fundamental trade-off between the precision of a trajectory observable and entropy production, where the uncertainty in the observable is quantified by its variance. In the context of information theory, uncertainty is often evaluated in terms of Shannon entropy, but it remains unclear whether there is a quantitative relation between Shannon entropy of the observable and entropy production in stochastic thermodynamics. In this Letter, we show that an uncertainty relation can be formulated with observable Shannon entropy and entropy production. We introduce symmetry entropy, an entropy measure that quantifies the symmetry of the observable distribution, and demonstrate that a greater asymmetry in the observable distribution demands higher entropy production. Specifically, we establish that the combined total of the entropy production and the symmetry entropy cannot be less than $\ln 2$. As a corollary, we also prove that the sum of the entropy production and the Shannon entropy of the observable is no less than $\ln 2$. This Letter elucidates the role of Shannon entropy of observables within stochastic thermodynamics, thereby establishing a foundation for deriving uncertainty relations.

Title: Kekulé Spiral Order from Strained Topological Heavy Fermions
Authors: Jonah Herzog-Arbeitman, Dumitru Călugăru, Haoyu Hu, Jiabin Yu, Nicolas Regnault, Jian Kang, B. Andrei Bernevig, Oskar Vafek
Abstract: The topological heavy fermion (THF) model of twisted bilayer graphene is a framework for treating its strongly interacting topological flat bands. In this work, we employ the THF model with heterostrain and particle-hole symmetry breaking corrections to study its symmetry-broken ground states. We find that the heterostrain correction motivates a specific parent-state wavefunction which dictates the presence or absence of an incommensurate Kekulé spiral (IKS) at each integer filling by invoking Dirac node braiding and annihilation as a mechanism to achieve low energy gapped states. We then show that one-shot Hartree-Fock faithfully replicates the numerical results of fully self-consistent states and motivates an analytical approximation for the IKS wavevector. We can also account for the particle-hole asymmetry in the correlated insulator gaps. In particular, the THF model predicts stronger correlated states on the electron side rather than hole side in agreement with magic angle experiments, despite the electron side being more dispersive in the single-particle band structure. This work demonstrates that we can analytically explain even the more subtle symmetry breaking order properties observed in experiments where heterostrain, relaxation, and interactions together determine the ground state.

Title: Multifunctional Altermagnet with Large Out-of-Plane Piezoelectric Response in Janus V$_{2}$AsBrO Monolayer
Authors: Qiuyue Ma, Busheng Wang, Guochun Yang, Yong Liu
Abstract: Altermagnetism has emerged as a third fundamental category of collinear magnetism, characterized by spin-splitting in symmetry-compensated collinear antiferromagnets, opening new frontiers in spintronics and condensed matter physics. Here, based on first-principles calculations, we propose a novel altermagnetic semiconductor, the asymmetric Janus V$_2$AsBrO monolayer, which exhibits a magnetic easy axis favoring the out-of-plane direction and a Néel temperature ($T_N$) exceeding room temperature. The system exhibits a strain-tunable piezovalley effect, generating valley polarization under uniaxial strain. Notably, hole doping under uniaxial strain generates a net magnetization ($M$) through a piezomagnetic mechanism. Additionally, the broken inversion symmetry endows the monolayer with a substantial out-of-plane piezoelectric coefficient $d_{31}$ (2.19 pm/V), presenting broad prospects for the development and design of novel piezoelectric devices. Our findings provide a promising candidate material for the advancement of 2D multifunctional devices in nanoelectronics, spintronics, valleytronics, and piezoelectrics.

Title: Correlative and in situ microscopy investigation of phase transformation, crystal growth and degradation of antimony sulfide thin films
Authors: Mingjian Wu, Maïssa K. S. Barr, Vanessa M. Koch, Martin Dierner, Tobias Dierke, Penghan Lu, Johannes Will, Rafal Dunin-Borkowski, Janina Maultzsch, Julien Bachmann, Erdmann Spiecker
Abstract: Antimony sulfide (Sb$_2$S$_3$), a compound of earth-abundant elements with highly anisotropic, quasi-layered crystal structure, triggered growing interest as a solar absorber in photovoltaics and as a phase change material in memory devices, yet challenges remain in achieving high-quality thin films with controlled nucleation and growth for optimal performance. Here, we investigate the phase transformation, crystal structure and properties, growth and degradation of atomic layer deposited Sb$_2$S$_3$ thin films using in situ TEM and correlative ex situ analysis. The as-deposited amorphous films crystallized at 243°C, forming grains with an [100] out-of-plane texture and developed into tens to hundreds of micrometer, leaves-shaped grains. Introducing an ultra-thin ZnS interfacial layer increased nucleation density, and resulted in a few micrometer-sized, more uniform grains while retaining the overall [100] texture. In situ observations and subsequent crystal orientation analysis with cutting-edge 4D-STEM and EBSD revealed that the grains grew faster along the [010] ribbon direction and that the bare films underwent early-stage degradation, forming holes in amorphous regions during annealing. The ZnS interlayer mitigated degradation, stabilizing the films and improving their uniformity. These findings offer valuable insights for optimizing Sb$_2$S$_3$ thin films for applications both as solar cell materials and phase change materials.

Title: Superconducting and spin-density wave phases probed by scanning tunneling spectroscopy in the organic conductor $\mathrm{(TMTSF)_{2}ClO_{4}}$
Authors: Mohammadmehdi Torkzadeh, Pascale Senzier, Claude Bourbonnais, Abdelouahab Sedeki, Cécile Méziere, Marie Hervé, Francois Debontridder, Pascal David, Tristan Cren, Claire Marrache-Kikuchi, Denis Jerome, Christophe Brun
Abstract: By scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) we have probed the local quasi-particle density of states (DOS) of the Bechgaard salt organic superconductor $\mathrm{(TMTSF)_{2}ClO_{4}}$ in slowly cooled single crystals cleaved under ultrahigh vacuum conditions. In well STM imaged crystallographic surface planes, the local DOS has been probed for different surface areas at temperatures above and below the critical temperature of superconducting or insulating spin-density wave states. While a rather homogeneous superconducting state is expected in the bulk from previous studies, depending on the degree of disorder introduced by cleavage in the anion lattice, an inhomogeneous granular state is predominantly observed at the surface. A pronounced linear V-shape profile of the local DOS is observed from intermediate to the lowest energy scale in the less disordered superconducting surface areas. This supports the existence of an unconventional d-wave like order parameter with nodes at low energy, which is preceded by more energetic fluctuations attributed to quantum criticality of the material. At higher energy disorder combined to correlations deplete further the DOS. By contrast a non-linear U-shape characterizes the local low energy DOS profile for the more disordered and insulating surface areas of the spin-density wave state. The experimental results are compared quantitatively with those predicted by the renormalization group theory of the quasi-one dimensional electron gas model and its description of the superconducting and spin-density wave states that are interlinked by quantum criticality in the Bechgaard salts.

Title: Bell correlations between momentum-entangled pairs of $^4\text{He}^*$ atoms
Authors: Y. S. Athreya, S. Kannan, X. T. Yan, R. J. Lewis-Swan, K. V. Kheruntsyan, A. G. Truscott, S. S. Hodgman
Abstract: Nonlocal entanglement between pair-correlated particles is a highly counter-intuitive aspect of quantum mechanics, where measurement on one particle can instantly affect the other, regardless of distance. While the rigorous Bell's inequality framework has enabled the demonstration of such entanglement in photons and atomic internal states, no experiment has yet involved motional states of massive particles. Here we report the experimental observation of Bell correlations in motional states of momentum-entangled ultracold helium atoms. Momentum-entangled pairs are generated via $s$-wave collisions. Using a Rarity-Tapster interferometer and a Bell-test framework, we observe atom-atom correlations required for violation of a Bell inequality. This result shows the potential of ultracold atoms for fundamental tests of quantum mechanics and opens new avenues to studying gravitational effects in quantum states.

Title: Dielectric-Dependent Range-Separated Hybrid Functional Calculations for Metal Oxides
Authors: Jiawei Zhan, Marco Govoni, Giulia Galli
Abstract: Recently, we introduced the screened-exchange range-separated hybrid (SE-RSH) functional to account for spatially dependent dielectric screening in complex materials. The SE-RSH functional has shown good performance in predicting the electronic properties of a large variety of semiconductors and insulators, and of heterogeneous systems composed of building blocks with large dielectric mismatch. Here, we assess the performance of SE-RSH for oxide materials, including antiferromagnetic transition-metal oxides. Through a comparison with other dielectric-dependent hybrid functionals, we demonstrate that SE-RSH yields improved predictions of dielectric constants and band gaps, bringing them into a closer agreement with experimental values. The functional also provides accurate values of magnetic moments of several oxides.

Title: Reconfigurable topological lasing through Thouless pumping in bilayer photonic crystal
Authors: D.-H.-Minh Nguyen, Dung Xuan Nguyen, Hai-Chau Nguyen, Thibaud Louvet, Emmanuel Drouard, Xavier Letartre, Dario Bercioux, Hai Son Nguyen
Abstract: We propose a programmable photonic platform that integrates Thouless pumping and reconfigurable lasing in sliding bilayer photonic crystals. By engineering two periodic potentials -- a slowly moving photonic grating atop a stationary one -- we demonstrate how their interplay yields distinct topological phases characterized by either robust light transport (Thouless pumping) or localized spatial oscillation (trapping). A heterojunction between crystals in these two regimes supports an interface mode stemming from the topological phase transition across the boundary. This interface mode can be actively tuned via microelectromechanical systems or switched through the integration of phase-change materials. We further establish the feasibility of lasing action at this interface mode, offering a pathway toward topologically robust and reconfigurable lasers. Our findings provide a framework for exploring topological phase transitions and unify the fields of topological photonics and programmable photonic devices, opening avenues for multidimensionally tunable light sources.

Title: Acceleration as a circular motion along an imaginary circle: Kubo-Martin-Schwinger condition for accelerating field theories in imaginary-time formalism
Authors: Victor E. Ambruş, Maxim N. Chernodub
Abstract: We discuss the imaginary-time formalism for field theories in thermal equilibrium in uniformly accelerating frames. We show that under a Wick rotation of Minkowski spacetime, the Rindler event horizon shrinks to a point in a two-dimensional subspace tangential to the acceleration direction and the imaginary time. We demonstrate that the accelerated version of the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) condition implies an identification of all spacetime points related by integer-multiple rotations in the tangential subspace about this Euclidean Rindler event-horizon point, with the rotational quanta defined by the thermal acceleration, $\alpha = a/T$. In the Wick-rotated Rindler hyperbolic coordinates, the KMS relations reduce to standard (anti-)periodic boundary conditions in terms of the imaginary proper time (rapidity) coordinate. Our findings pave the way to study, using first-principle lattice simulations, the Hawking-Unruh radiation in geometries with event horizons, phase transitions in accelerating Early Universe and early stages of quark-gluon plasma created in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.

Title: Asymmetric Relaxations Through the Lens of Information Geometry
Authors: Alessandro Bravetti, Miguel Ángel García Ariza, Pablo Padilla
Abstract: We frame Newton's Law of Cooling as a gradient flow within the context of information geometry. This connects it to a thermodynamic uncertainty relation and the Horse-Carrot Theorem, and reveals novel instances of asymmetric relaxations in endoreversible processes. We present a general criterion for predicting asymmetries using the Amari-Chentsov tensor, applicable to classical and quantum thermodynamics. Examples include faster cooling of quantum ideal gases and relaxations that resemble the Mpemba effect in classical ideal gases.

Title: Functional Renormalization Group Analysis of $O(3)$ Nonlinear Sigma Model and Non-Abelian Bosonization Duality
Authors: Junichi Haruna, Keito Shimizu, Masatoshi Yamada
Abstract: It is known that the $U(2)$ Wess-Zumino-Witten model is dual to the free fermion theory in two dimensions via non-Abelian bosonization. While it is decomposed into the $SU(2)$ Wess-Zumino-Witten model and a free compact boson, the former is believed to be equivalent to the $O(3)$ nonlinear sigma model with the theta term at $\theta=\pi$. In this work, we reexamine this duality through the lens of non-perturbative renormalization group (RG) flow. We analyze the RG flow structure of the $O(3)$ nonlinear sigma model with the theta term in two dimensions using the functional renormalization group. Our results reveal a nontrivial fixed point with a nonzero value of the topological coupling. The scaling dimensions (critical exponents) at this fixed point suggest the realization of a duality between the $O(3)$ nonlinear sigma model with the theta term and the free fermion theory, indicating that these models belong to the same universality class.

Title: Sampling from the Continuous Random Energy Model in Total Variation Distance
Authors: Holden Lee, Qiang Wu
Abstract: The continuous random energy model (CREM) is a toy model of spin glasses on $\{0,1\}^N$ that, in the limit, exhibits an infinitely hierarchical correlation structure. We give two polynomial-time algorithms to approximately sample from the Gibbs distribution of the CREM in the high-temperature regime $\beta<\beta_{\min}:=\min\{\beta_c,\beta_G\}$, based on a Markov chain and a sequential sampler. The running time depends algebraically on the desired TV distance and failure probability and exponentially in $(1/g)^{O(1)}$, where $g$ is the gap to a certain inverse temperature threshold $\beta_{\min}$; this contrasts with previous results which only attain $o(N)$ accuracy in KL divergence. If the covariance function $A$ of the CREM is concave, the algorithms work up to the critical threshold $\beta_c$, which is the static phase transition point; while for $A$ non-concave, if $\beta_G<\beta_c$, the algorithms work up to the known algorithmic threshold $\beta_G$ proposed in Addario-Berry and Maillard (2020) for non-trivial sampling guarantees. Our result depends on quantitative bounds for the fluctuation of the partition function and a new contiguity result of the ``tilted" CREM obtained from sampling, which is of independent interest. We also show that the spectral gap is exponentially small with high probability, suggesting that the algebraic dependence is unavoidable with a Markov chain approach.

Title: Abstraction requires breadth: a renormalisation group approach
Authors: Carlo Orientale Caputo, Elias Seiffert, Matteo Marsili
Abstract: Abstraction is the process of extracting the essential features from raw data while ignoring irrelevant details. This is similar to the process of focusing on large-scale properties, systematically removing irrelevant small-scale details, implemented in the renormalisation group of statistical physics. This analogy is suggestive because the fixed points of the renormalisation group offer an ideal candidate of a truly abstract -- i.e. data independent -- representation. It has been observed that abstraction emerges with depth in neural networks. Deep layers of neural network capture abstract characteristics of data, such as "cat-ness" or "dog-ness" in images, by combining the lower level features encoded in shallow layers (e.g. edges). Yet we argue that depth alone is not enough to develop truly abstract representations. We advocate that the level of abstraction crucially depends on how broad the training set is. We address the issue within a renormalisation group approach where a representation is expanded to encompass a broader set of data. We take the unique fixed point of this transformation -- the Hierarchical Feature Model -- as a candidate for an abstract representation. This theoretical picture is tested in numerical experiments based on Deep Belief Networks trained on data of different breadth. These show that representations in deep layers of neural networks approach the Hierarchical Feature Model as the data gets broader, in agreement with theoretical predictions.

Title: A Novel Constrained Sampling Method for Efficient Exploration in Materials and Chemical Mixture Design
Authors: Christina Schenk, Maciej Haranczyk
Abstract: Efficient exploration of multicomponent material composition spaces is often limited by time and financial constraints, particularly when mixture and synthesis constraints exist. Traditional methods like Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) struggle with constrained problems especially in high dimensions, while emerging approaches like Bayesian optimization (BO) face challenges in early-stage exploration. This article introduces ConstrAined Sequential laTin hypeRcube sampling methOd (CASTRO), an open-source tool designed to address these challenges. CASTRO is optimized for uniform sampling in constrained small- to moderate-dimensional spaces, with scalability to higher dimensions through future adaptations. CASTRO uses a divide-and-conquer strategy to decompose problems into parallel subproblems, improving efficiency and scalability. It effectively handles equality-mixture constraints, ensuring comprehensive design space coverage and leveraging LHS and LHS with multidimensional uniformity (LHSMDU). It also integrates prior experimental knowledge, making it well-suited for efficient exploration within limited budgets. Validation through two material design case studies, a four-dimensional problem with near-uniform distributions and a nine-dimensional problem with additional synthesis constraints, demonstrates CASTRO's effectiveness in exploring constrained design spaces for materials science, pharmaceuticals and chemicals. The software and case studies are available on GitHub.

Title: Two-Level System Nanomechanics in the Blue-Detuned Regime
Authors: Guillaume Bertel, Clement Dutreix, Fabio Pistolesi
Abstract: We study a mechanical oscillator coupled to a two-level system driven by a blue-detuned coherent source in the resolved sideband regime. For weak mechanical damping, we find dynamical instabilities leading to limit cycles. They are signaled by strong fluctuations in the number of emitted photons, with a large Fano factor. The phonon-number fluctuations exhibit a strikingly similar behavior. When the coupling strength becomes comparable to the mechanical frequency, non-classical mechanical states appear. We demonstrate that these properties can be detected by measuring the photon-emission spectrum, which enables the reconstruction of the Wigner function. We then discuss the relation with cavity optomechanical systems. Candidates for observing these effects include superconducting qubits, NV centers, and single molecules coupled to oscillators.

Abstract: The inherent complexity of human beings manifests in a remarkable diversity of responses to intricate environments, enabling us to approach problems from varied perspectives. However, in the study of cooperation, existing research within the reinforcement learning framework often assumes that individuals have access to identical information when making decisions, which contrasts with the reality that individuals frequently perceive information differently. In this study, we employ the Q-learning algorithm to explore the impact of information perception on the evolution of cooperation in a two-person Prisoner's Dilemma game. We demonstrate that the evolutionary processes differ significantly across three distinct information perception scenarios, highlighting the critical role of information structure in the emergence of cooperation. Notably, the asymmetric information scenario reveals a complex dynamical process, including the emergence, breakdown, and reconstruction of cooperation, mirroring psychological shifts observed in human behavior. Our findings underscore the importance of information structure in fostering cooperation, offering new insights into the establishment of stable cooperative relationships among humans.

Title: NEAR: A Training-Free Pre-Estimator of Machine Learning Model Performance
Authors: Raphael T. Husistein, Markus Reiher, Marco Eckhoff
Abstract: Artificial neural networks have been shown to be state-of-the-art machine learning models in a wide variety of applications, including natural language processing and image recognition. However, building a performant neural network is a laborious task and requires substantial computing power. Neural Architecture Search (NAS) addresses this issue by an automatic selection of the optimal network from a set of potential candidates. While many NAS methods still require training of (some) neural networks, zero-cost proxies promise to identify the optimal network without training. In this work, we propose the zero-cost proxy \textit{Network Expressivity by Activation Rank} (NEAR). It is based on the effective rank of the pre- and post-activation matrix, i.e., the values of a neural network layer before and after applying its activation function. We demonstrate the cutting-edge correlation between this network score and the model accuracy on NAS-Bench-101 and NATS-Bench-SSS/TSS. In addition, we present a simple approach to estimate the optimal layer sizes in multi-layer perceptrons. Furthermore, we show that this score can be utilized to select hyperparameters such as the activation function and the neural network weight initialization scheme.

Title: Ocneanu Algebra of Seams: Critical Unitary $E_6$ RSOS Lattice Model
Authors: Paul A. Pearce, Jorgen Rasmussen
Abstract: We consider the $A$ series and exceptional $E_6$ Restricted Solid-On-Solid lattice models as prototypical examples of the critical Yang-Baxter integrable two-dimensional $A$-$D$-$E$ lattice models. We focus on type I theories which are characterized by the existence of an extended chiral symmetry in the continuum scaling limit. Starting with the commuting family of column transfer matrices on the torus, we build matrix representations of the Ocneanu graph fusion algebra as integrable seams for arbitrary finite-size lattices with the structure constants specified by Petkova and Zuber. This commutative seam algebra contains the Verlinde, fused adjacency and graph fusion algebras as subalgebras. Our matrix representation of the Ocneanu algebra encapsulates the quantum symmetry of the commuting family of transfer matrices. In the continuum scaling limit, the integrable seams realize the topological defects of the associated conformal field theory and the known toric matrices encode the twisted conformal partition functions.

Title: Quantum geometric tensor determines the i.i.d. conversion rate in the resource theory of asymmetry for any compact Lie group
Authors: Koji Yamaguchi, Yosuke Mitsuhashi, Tomohiro Shitara, Hiroyasu Tajima
Abstract: Symmetry is one of the most significant foundational principles underlying nature. The resource theory of asymmetry (RTA) is a resource-theoretic framework for investigating asymmetry as a resource to break constraints imposed by symmetries. It has recently undergone significant developments, resulting in applications in a variety of research areas since symmetry and its breaking are ubiquitous in physics. Nevertheless, the resource conversion theory at the core of RTA remains incomplete. In the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) setup, where identical copies of a state are converted to identical copies of another state, conversion theory among pure states has been completed only for $U(1)$ group and finite groups. Here, we establish an i.i.d. conversion theory among any pure states in RTA for any continuous symmetry described by a compact Lie group, which includes the cases where multiple conserved quantities are involved. We show that the quantum geometric tensor is an asymmetry monotone for pure states that determines the optimal approximate asymptotic conversion rate. Our formulation achieves a unified understanding of conversion rates in prior studies for different symmetries. As a corollary of the formula, we also affirmatively prove the Marvian-Spekkens conjecture on reversible asymptotic convertibility in RTA, which has remained unproven for a decade.

Title: On Intersecting Conformal Defects
Authors: Tom Shachar
Abstract: We study the physics of 2 and 3 mutually intersecting conformal defects forming wedges and corners in general dimension. For 2 defects we derive the beta function of the edge interactions for infinite and semi-infinite wedges and study them in the tricritical model in $d=3-\epsilon$ as an example. We discuss the dependency of the edge anomalous dimension on the intersection angle, connecting to an old issue known in the literature. Additionally, we study trihedral corners formed by 3 planes and compute the corner anomalous dimension, which can be considered as a higher-dimensional analog of the cusp anomalous dimension. We also study 3-line corners related to the three-body potential of point-like impurities.

Title: Fortuity in SYK Models
Authors: Chi-Ming Chang, Yiming Chen, Bik Soon Sia, Zhenbin Yang
Abstract: We study the fortuity phenomenon in supersymmetric Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) models. For generic choices of couplings, all the BPS states in the $\mathcal{N}=2$ SUSY SYK model are fortuitous. The SYK models reveal an intimate connection between fortuity and the Schwarzian description of supersymmetric black holes, reflected in a sharp feature of $R$-charge concentration - microscopically, all the fortuitous states are concentrated in particular charge sectors. We propose that both $R$-charge concentration and the random matrix behavior near the BPS states are key properties of a generic $q$-local supercharge and formulate these as a supercharge chaos conjecture. We expect supercharge chaos to hold universally for supercharges in holographic CFTs near their fortuitous states, potentially providing a microscopic interpretation for the charge constraints of supersymmetric black holes. We also construct SYK models that contain both fortuitous states and monotonous states and contrast their properties, providing further evidence that monotonous states are less chaotic than fortuitous states.

Title: Ultrafast electrical control of dipolariton-based optical circuits with a few femto-joul per bit power consumption
Authors: Dror Liran, Ronen Rapaport, Kirk Baldwin, Loren Pfeiffer, Hui Deng
Abstract: The next generation of photonic circuits will require programmable, ultrafast, and energy-efficient components on a scalable platform for quantum and neuromorphic computing. Here, we present ultrafast electrical control of highly nonlinear light-matter hybrid quasi-particles, called waveguide exciton-dipolaritons, with extremely low power consumption. Our device performs as an optical transistor with a GHz-rate electrical modulation at a record-low total energy consumption $\sim$3 fJ/bit and a compact active area of down to 25 $\mu$m$^2$. This work establishes waveguide-dipolariton platforms for scalable, electrically reconfigurable, ultra-low power photonic circuits for both classical and quantum computing and communication.
