Title: Towards an automated workflow in materials science for combining multi-modal simulative and experimental information using data mining and large language models
Authors: Balduin Katzer, Steffen Klinder, Katrin Schulz
Abstract: To retrieve and compare scientific data of simulations and experiments in materials science, data needs to be easily accessible and machine readable to qualify and quantify various materials science phenomena. The recent progress in open science leverages the accessibility to data. However, a majority of information is encoded within scientific documents limiting the capability of finding suitable literature as well as material properties. This manuscript showcases an automated workflow, which unravels the encoded information from scientific literature to a machine readable data structure of texts, figures, tables, equations and meta-data, using natural language processing and language as well as vision transformer models to generate a machine-readable database. The machine-readable database can be enriched with local data, as e.g. unpublished or private material data, leading to knowledge synthesis. The study shows that such an automated workflow accelerates information retrieval, proximate context detection and material property extraction from multi-modal input data exemplarily shown for the research field of microstructural analyses of face-centered cubic single crystals. Ultimately, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based Large Language Model (LLM) enables a fast and efficient question answering chat bot.

Title: Incommensurate gapless ferromagnetism connecting competing symmetry-enriched deconfined quantum phase transitions
Authors: Anthony Rey, Ömer M. Aksoy, Daniel P. Arovas, Claudio Chamon, Christopher Mudry
Abstract: Interpolating between distinct symmetry-enriched critical points is believed to require going through either a multicritical point or an intervening gapped phase. We present a scenario, in which a gapless extended phase serves as a "hub" connecting multiple symmetry-enriched deconfined quantum critical points. As a concrete example, we construct a lattice model with $\mathbb{Z}^{\,}_{2}\times \mathbb{Z}^{\,}_{2}\times \mathbb{Z}^{\,}_{2}$ symmetry for quantum spin-1/2 degrees of freedom that realizes four distinct gapful phases supporting antiferromagnetic long-range order and one extended incommensurate gapless ferromagnetic phase. The quantum phase transition between any two of the four gapped and antiferromagnetic phases goes through either a (deconfined) quantum critical point, a quantum tricritical point, or the incommensurate gapless ferromagnetic phase. In this phase diagram, it is possible to interpolate between four deconfined quantum critical points by passing through the extended gapless ferromagnetic phase. We identify the phases in the model and the nature of the transitions between them through a combination of analytical arguments and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) studies.

Title: Boundary Operator Product Expansion Coefficients of the Three-dimensional Ising Universality Class
Authors: Dorian Przetakiewicz, Stefan Wessel, Francesco Parisen Toldin
Abstract: Recent advances in field theory and critical phenomena have focused on the characterization of boundary or defects in a conformally-invariant system. In this Letter we study the critical behavior of the three-dimensional Ising universality class in the presence of a surface, realizing the ordinary, the special, and the normal universality classes. By using high-precision Monte Carlo simulations of an improved model, where leading scaling corrections are suppressed, and a finite-size scaling analysis, we determine unbiased, accurate estimates of universal boundary operator product expansion coefficients. Furthermore, we improve the value of the scaling dimension of the surface field at the special transition by the estimate $\hat{\Delta}_\sigma = 0.3531(3)$.

Title: Expanding the reach of diffusing wave spectroscopy and tracer bead microrheology
Authors: Manuel Helfer, Chi Zhang, Frank Scheffold
Abstract: Diffusing Wave Spectroscopy (DWS) is an extension of standard dynamic light scattering (DLS), applied to soft materials that are turbid or opaque. The propagation of light is modeled using light diffusion, characterized by a light diffusion coefficient that depends on the transport mean free path l* of the medium. DWS is highly sensitive to small particle displacements or other local fluctuations in the scattering properties and can probe subnanometer displacements. Analyzing the motion of beads in a viscoelastic matrix, known as one-bead microrheology, is one of the most common applications of DWS. Despite significant advancements since its invention in 1987, including two-cell and multi-speckle DWS, challenges such as merging single and multi-speckle data and limited accuracy for short correlation times persist. Here, we address these issues by improving the two-cell Echo DWS scheme. We propose a calibration-free method to blend and merge Echo and two-cell DWS data and demonstrate the use of regularized inversion algorithms to enhance data quality at very short times. Building on this, we introduce stable corrections for bead and fluid inertia, significantly improving the quality of microrheology data at high frequencies.

Title: Time-periodic driving of a bath-coupled open quantum gas of light
Authors: Andris Erglis, Alexander Sazhin, Frank Vewinger, Martin Weitz, Stefan Yoshi Buhmann, Julian Schmitt
Abstract: We study the frequency-resolved density response of a photon Bose-Einstein condensate coupled to a bath of dye molecules by time-periodic driving. By monitoring the photon number dynamics for different drive frequencies, we obtain the spectral response of the condensate in a phase-sensitive way. We find that as the photon number increases, the response of the coupled condensate-bath system transitions from overdamped to resonant behavior, indicating a transition from closed to open system dynamics. Our spectroscopy method paves the way for studies of collective excitations in complex driven-dissipative systems.

Title: Field Dislocation Mechanics, Conservation of Burgers vector, and the augmented Peierls model of dislocation dynamics
Authors: Amit Acharya
Abstract: Dissipative models for the quasi-static and dynamic response due to slip in an elastic body containing a single slip plane of vanishing thickness are developed. Discrete dislocations with continuously distributed cores can glide on this plane, and the models are developed as special cases of a fully three-dimensional theory of plasticity induced by dislocation motion. The reduced models are compared and contrasted with the augmented Peierls model of dislocation dynamics. A primary distinguishing feature of the reduced models is the a-priori accounting of space-time conservation of Burgers vector during dislocation evolution. A physical shortcoming of the developed models as well as the Peierls model with regard to a dependence on the choice of a distinguished, coherent reference configuration is discussed, and a testable model without such dependence is also proposed.

Title: Magnetic Field-Controlled Mixed Modulation in Magnetoelectric Sensors
Authors: Elizaveta Spetzler, Benjamin Spetzler, Dennis Seidler, Johan Arbustini, Lars Thormählen, Robert Rieger, Andreas Bahr, Dirk Meyners, Jeffrey McCord
Abstract: Magnetoelectric (ME) magnetic field sensors commonly rely on one of the two modulation principles: the nonlinear dependence of magnetostrictive strain on the applied field or the stress-induced change in magnetization susceptibility. While both effects coexist in any ME device, different readout schemes can be chosen to utilize one or the other effect for magnetic field sensing. This work demonstrates that both principles can be simultaneously implemented in a single electrically modulated ME sensor with inductive readout (a converse ME sensor). This mixed modulation approach significantly enhances low-frequency sensitivity while not affecting the sensitivity at higher frequencies. This leads to a nontrivial dependency of the sensor sensitivity on the frequency of the magnetic field to be measured and can effectively decrease the sensor bandwidth by up to an order of magnitude. We show that the contribution of the modulation from the nonlinearity of the magnetostrictive strain to the sensor sensitivity can be changed by applying a magnetic bias field, offering an additional dimension to the design of ME sensors, especially for potential applications in the unshielded environment.

Title: Dissipative anomalies of stresses in soft amorphous solids: footprints of density singularities
Authors: Anier Hernandez-Garcia
Abstract: In soft amorphous solids, localized irreversible (plastic) stress dissipation occurs as a response to external forcings. A crucial question is whether we can identify structural properties linked to a region's propensity to undergo a plastic stress drop when thermal effects are negligible. To address this question, I follow a theoretical framework provided by Onsager's ideal turbulence theory, representing a non-perturbative application of the renormalization group scale-invariance principle. First, I analyze the zero temperature limit for the fine-grained balance equation for the stress tensor corresponding to instanton realizations. I show that irreversible stress drops can occur if the density gradients diverge. I then derive a balance relation for the coarse-grained instantaneous stress tensor with arbitrary regularization scale $\ell$. From the latter, I obtain an expression for the local inter-scale stress flux in terms of moments of the density increments. By assuming that the density field is Besov regular, I determine the scaling of the stress flux with $\ell$. From this scaling, I show that distributional solutions of the noiseless Dean (NDE) equation can sustain stress dissipation due to a non-equilibrium inter-scale stress flux if the scaling exponents of the density structure functions are below a critical threshold. The athermal limit of fine-grained and coarse-grained descriptions must describe the same phenomenology, \textit{i.e.} the existence of stress dissipation must be independent of any regularization of the dynamics. Using this principle, I analyze the limit $\ell\rightarrow 0$ and argue that flow realizations of athermal disordered systems correspond to ultraviolet fixed-point solutions of the coarse-grained NDE equations with sufficiently low Besov regularity.

Title: Spin-to-charge conversion at KTaO3(111) interfaces
Authors: Athby H. Al-Tawhid, Rui Sun, Andrew H. Comstock, Divine P. Kumah, Dali Sun, Kaveh Ahadi
Abstract: Rashba spin-orbit coupling locks the spin with momentum of charge carriers at the broken inversion interfaces, which could generate a large spin galvanic response. Here, we demonstrate spin-to-charge conversion (inverse Rashba-Edelstein effect) in KTaO3(111) two-dimensional electron systems. We explain the results in the context of electronic structure, orbital character, and spin texture at the KTaO3(111) interfaces. We also show that the angle dependence of the spin-to-charge conversion on in-plane magnetic field exhibits a nontrivial behavior which matches the symmetry of the Fermi states. Results point to opportunities to use spin-to-charge conversion as a tool to investigate the electronic structure and spin texture.

Title: Chiral ground states in a nematic liquid crystal confined to a cylinder with homeotropic anchoring
Authors: Lucas Myers, Jorge Viñals
Abstract: The singular potential method in the Q tensor order parameter representation is used to determine the ground state configuration of an elastically anisotropic nematic liquid crystal when confined to a cylindrical geometry with homeotropic anchoring. Ground states of broken chiral symmetry are found for sufficiently small values of the twist elastic constant relative to bend and splay constants. For small cylinder radius, twisted configurations, which feature two disclinations lines that wind around the long axis of the cylinder, are generally found to minimize the free energy of the nematic. For larger radii, ground state configurations are (non singular) escaped configuration. Twisted and untwisted escaped configurations are almost degenerate in energy in this region. This near degeneracy is broken when splay-bend contrast is allowed.

Title: Soft phonon and the central peak at the cubic-to-tetragonal phase transition in SrTiO$_3$
Authors: Avishek Maity, Klaus Habicht, Michael Merz, Ayman H. Said, Christo Guguschev, Danny Kojda, Britta Ryll, Jan-Ekkehard Hoffmann, Andrea Dittmar, Thomas Keller, Frank Weber
Abstract: The continuous displacive phase transition in SrTiO$_3$ near $T_c \approx 105$ K features a central elastic peak in neutron scattering investigations at temperatures above $T_c$, i.e., before the corresponding soft phonon mode is overdamped upon cooling. The origin of this central peak is still not understood. Here, we report an inelastic x-ray scattering investigation of the cubic-to-tetragonal phase transition in SrTiO$_3$. We compare quantitatively measurements of the soft phonon mode on two differently grown samples and discuss the findings regarding results from thermodynamic probes such as specific heat and thermal conductivity. Furthermore, we use inelastic x-ray scattering to perform elastic scans with both high momentum- and milli-electronvolt energy-resolution and, thus, be able to separate elastic intensities of the central peak from low-energy quasielastic phonon scattering. Our results indicate that the evolution of the soft mode is similar in both samples though the intensities of the central peak differ by a factor of four. Measurements revealing anisotropic correlation lengths on cooling towards $T_c$, indicate that local properties of the crystals to which collective lattice excitations are insensitive are likely at the origin of the central elastic line in SrTiO$_3$.

Title: Constructing a variational ground state of matter fermions coupled to a vison pair in Kitaev's honeycomb model
Authors: T. Grace, A. Principi
Abstract: We develop a new method to construct simple and explicit variational approximations for the ground state of Kitaev's honeycomb model with a non-trivial Z2 flux configuration consisting of a pair of visons on neighbouring plaquettes. The method consists of retaining only the largest singular values of the generator of the transformation between the vison-pair and flux-free ground states. We compare physical quantities calculated using the approximate state to those obtained by extrapolating results of exact diagonalisation of finite lattices, finding them to be in very good agreement. We discuss ways to extend the method to more complicated flux configurations.

Title: Stable Neel-Twisted Skyrmion Bags in a van der Waals Magnet Fe3-xGaTe2 at Room Temperature
Authors: Jialiang Jiang, Yaodong Wu, Lingyao Kong, Yongsen Zhang, Sheng Qiu, Huanhuan Zhang, Yajiao Ke, Shouguo Wang, Mingliang Tian, Jin Tang
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmion bags with diverse topological charges Q, offer prospects for future spintronic devices based on freedom of Q. While their emergence in van der Waals magnets holds the potential in developing Q-based 2D topological spintronics. However, previous room-temperature skyrmion bags necessitate special anisotropy engineering through disorder Fe intercalation, and the stable phase diagram for skyrmion bags across room temperature regions is lacking. Here, we demonstrate the observation and electrical manipulation of room temperature skyrmion bags in Fe3-xGaTe2 without specially designed Fe intercalation. Combining the pulsed currents with the assistance of magnetic fields, skyrmion bags with various topological charges are generated and annihilated. Especially double nested skyrmion bags are also discovered at room temperature. The stable temperature-field diagram of skyrmion bags has been established. We also demonstrate the electrical-controlled topological phase transformations of skyrmion bags. Our results will provide novel insights for the design of 2D skyrmion-based high-performance devices.

Title: Analytical solution for the relaxed atomic configuration of twisted bilayer graphene including heterostrain
Authors: Jian Kang, Oskar Vafek
Abstract: Continuum atomic relaxation models for twisted bilayer graphene involve minimization of the sum of intralayer elastic energy and interlayer adhesion energy. The elastic energy favors a rigid twist i.e. no distortion in the twisted honeycomb lattices, while the adhesion energy favors Bernal stacking and breaking the relaxation into triangular AB and BA stacked domains. We compare the results of two relaxation models with the published Bragg interferometry data, finding good agreement with one of the models. We then provide a method for finding a highly accurate approximation to the solution of this model which holds above the twist angle of $\approx0.7^\circ$ and thus covers the first magic angle. We find closed form expressions in the absence, as well as in the presence, of external heterostrain. These expressions are not written as a Taylor series in the ratio of adhesion and elastic energy, because, as we show, the radius of convergence of such a series is too small to access the first magic angle.

Title: Quantum critical electro-optic and piezo-electric nonlinearities
Authors: Christopher P. Anderson, Giovanni Scuri, Aaron Chan, Sungjun Eun, Alexander D. White, Geun Ho Ahn, Christine Jilly, Amir Safavi-Naeini, Kasper Van Gasse, Lu Li, Jelena Vučković
Abstract: Electro-optics, the tuning of optical properties of materials with electric fields, is key to a multitude of quantum and classical photonics applications. However, a major obstacle preventing many emerging use cases is inefficient modulation in cryogenic environments, as traditional tuning mechanisms degrade at low temperatures. Guided by the connection between phase transitions and nonlinearity, we identify the quantum paraelectric perovskite SrTiO$_3$ (STO) as the strongest cryogenic electro-optic photonic material. As a result of the unique quantum paraelectric phase of STO, we demonstrate a dynamically tunable linear Pockels coefficient ($r_{33}$) exceeding 500 pm/V at $T=5$ K, and study its full temperature and bias dependence. We also measure an enhanced piezo-electric coefficient ($d_{33}$) above 90 pC/N. Both of these coefficients exceed all previously reported values for cryogenic materials, including lithium niobate ($r_{33}\approx24$ pm/V) and barium titanate ($r_{42}\approx170$ pm/V). Furthermore, by tuning STO towards \textit{quantum criticality} with oxygen isotope substitution we more than double the optical and piezo-electric nonlinearities, demonstrating a linear Pockels coefficient above 1100 pm/V. Our results probe the link between quantum phase transitions, dielectric susceptibility, and optical nonlinearities, unlocking opportunities in cryogenic optical and mechanical systems, and provide a framework for discovering new nonlinear materials.

Title: Quantum Emitters in Flux Grown hBN
Authors: Evan Williams, Angus Gale, Jake Horder, Dominic Scognamiglio, Milos Toth, Igor Aharonovich
Abstract: Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is an emerging material for use in quantum technologies, hosting bright and stable single photon emitters (SPEs). The B-center is one promising SPE in hBN, due to the near-deterministic creation methods and regular emission wavelength. However, incorporation of B-centers in high-quality crystals remains challenging, typically relying on additional post-growth methods to increase creation efficiency. Here, we have demonstrated controlled carbon doping of hBN during growth, using a metal flux based method to increase the efficiency of B-center creation. Importantly, single B-centers with $g^{(2)}(0) < 0.5$ were able to be generated in the as-grown hBN when carbon additions during growth exceeded 2.5 wt.% C. Resonant excitation measurements revealed linewidths of 3.5 GHz with only moderate spectral diffusion present, demonstrating the applicability of the as-grown hBN as a host for high quality B-centers.

Title: Decoding lithium's subtle phase stability with a machine learning force field
Authors: Yiheng Shen, Wei Xie
Abstract: Understanding the phase stability of elemental lithium (Li) is crucial for optimizing its performance in lithium-metal battery anodes, yet this seemingly simple metal exhibits complex polymorphism that requires proper accounting for quantum and anharmonic effects to capture the subtleties in its flat energy landscape. Here we address this challenge by developing an accurate graph neural network-based machine learning force field and performing efficient self-consistent phonon calculations for bcc-, fcc-, and 9R-Li under near-ambient conditions, incorporating quantum, phonon renormalization and thermal expansion effects. Our results reveal the important role of anharmonicity in determining Li's thermodynamic properties. The free energy differences between these phases, particularly fcc- and 9R-Li are found to be only a few meV/atom, explaining the experimental challenges in obtaining phase-pure samples and suggesting a propensity for stacking faults and related defect formation. fcc-Li is confirmed as the ground state at zero temperature and pressure, and the predicted bcc-fcc phase boundary qualitatively matches experimental phase transition lines, despite overestimation of the transition temperature and pressure slope. These findings provide crucial insights into Li's complex polymorphism and establish an effective computational approach for large-scale atomistic simulations of Li in more realistic settings for practical energy storage applications.

Title: Single monolayer ferromagnetic perovskite SrRuO3 with high conductivity and strong ferromagnetism
Authors: Yuki K. Wakabayashi, Masaki Kobayashi, Yoshiharu Krockenberger, Takahito Takeda, Kohei Yamagami, Hideki Yamamoto, Yoshitaka Taniyasu
Abstract: Achieving robust ferromagnetism and high conductivity in atomically thin oxide materials is critical for advancing spintronic technologies. Here, we report the growth of a highly conductive and ferromagnetic single monolayer SrRuO3 having a high Curie temperature of 154 K on DyScO3 110 substrates. The SrTiO3 capping layer effectively suppresses surface reactions, which typically hinder ferromagnetism in atomically thin films. X ray absorption spectroscopy and X ray magnetic circular dichroism measurements revealed strong orbital hybridization between Ru 4d and O 2p orbitals in the SRO monolayer, which contributes to enhancement of the conductivity and ferromagnetic ordering of both the Ru 4d and O 2p orbitals. The resistivity of the single monolayer SrRuO3 on the better lattice matched DyScO3 substrate is approximately one-third of that of previously reported single monolayer SrRuO3 grown on an SrTiO3 substrate. This study highlights the potential of monolayer SrRuO3 as a platform for two dimensional magnetic oxide systems, offering new opportunities for the eploration of spintronic devices and quantum transport phenomena.

Title: Self-assembly of anisotropic particles on curved surfaces
Authors: Gautam Bordia, Thomas P. Russell, Ahmad K. Omar
Abstract: The surface curvature of membranes, interfaces, and substrates plays a crucial role in shaping the self-assembly of particles adsorbed on these surfaces. However, little is known about the interplay between particle anisotropy and surface curvature and how they couple to alter the free energy landscape of particle assemblies. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate the effect of prescribed curvatures on a quasi-2D assembly of anisotropic patchy particles. By varying curvature and surface coverage, we uncover a rich geometric phase diagram, with curvature inducing ordered structures entirely absent on planar surfaces. Large spatial domains of ordered structures can contain hidden microdomains of orientational textures imprinted by the surface on the assembly. The dynamical landscape is also reshaped by surface curvature, with a glass state emerging at modest densities and high curvature. Our findings show that the coupling between surface curvature and particle geometry opens a new space of morphologies and structures that can be exploited for material design.

Title: Turing patterns on polymerized membranes: a coarse-grained lattice modelling with internal degree of freedom for polymer direction
Authors: F.Kato, H.Koibuchi, E.Bretin, C.Carvalho, R.Denis, S.Masnou, M. Nakayama, S.Tasaki, T.Uchimoto
Abstract: We numerically study Turing patterns (TPs) on two-dimensional surfaces with a square boundary in ${\bf R}^3$ using a surface model for polymerized membranes. The variables used to describe the membranes correspond to two distinct degrees of freedom: an internal degree of freedom for the polymer directions in addition to the positional degree of freedom. This generalised surface model enables us to identify a non-trivial interference between the TP system and the membranes. To this end, we employ a hybrid numerical technique, utilising Monte Carlo updates for membrane configurations and discrete time iterations for the FitzHugh-Nagumo type Turing equation. The simulation results clearly show that anisotropies in the mechanical deformation properties, particularly the easy axes associated with the stretching and bending of the membranes, determine the direction of the TPs to be perpendicular or parallel to the easy axes. Additionally, by calculating the dependence of the maximum entropy on the internal degree of freedom, we can obtain information on the relaxation with respect to the polymer structure. This crucial information serves to remind us that non-equilibrium configurations can be captured within the canonical Monte Carlo simulations.

Title: Gate tunable Dirac mass and Berry phase in Trilayer graphene
Authors: Harsimran Kaur Mann, Simrandeep Kaur, Safil Mullick, Priya Tiwari, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Aveek Bid
Abstract: In-situ control over band mass inversion is crucial for developing materials with topologically protected edge modes. In this Letter, we report the direct observation of displacement field $D$ control of band mass and Berry phase in Bernal stacked trilayer graphene (TLG) in the region where trigonal warping distorts the quadratic band into off-center Dirac points, referred to as `Dirac Gullies.' Using Shubnikov-de-Haas (SdH) oscillations, we map the Fermi surface contours of the Dirac gullies and the $D$-dependent band structure. With increasing $D$-field, the Berry phase undergoes multiple transitions from $\Phi_B=2\pi$ $\rightarrow$ $\pi$ $\rightarrow$ $2\pi$ as $D$ is varied. Concurrently, measurement of the effective mass reveals a series of transitions between massless and massive bands, signaling the closure and reopening (accompanied by a possible band inversion) of the band gap at a critical value of $D$. Interestingly, the expected Dirac-like behavior of the Dirac gullies ($\Phi_B=\pi$) persists only over a narrow range of $D$. Our study directly confirms recent predictions of $ D$-field-induced band inversion in the low-energy regions of TLG. It is a significant step towards achieving control over pure valley transport in multilayer graphene.

Title: Mass enhancement and metal-nonmetal transition driven by d-f hybridization in perovskites La1-xPrxCuO3
Authors: H. Takahashi, M. Ito, J. Fujioka, M. Ochi, S. Sakai, R. Arita, H. Sagayama, Y. Yamasaki, S. Ishiwata
Abstract: We report the large electron-mass enhancement and the metal to nonmetal transition upon the Pr doping in perovskite-type La1-xPrxCuO3. With increasing the Pr content x around 0.6, the LaCuO3-type three-dimensional structure with trivalent Cu ions changes to the quasi-one-dimensional structure with nearly divalent Cu ions, which accompanies significant changes in the electronic properties. Based on the resistivity, optical conductivity, specific heat measurements and the first-principles calculations, we discuss the formation of a nearly localized nonmetallic state stabilized by the hybridization between Cu 3d, O 2p, and Pr 4f orbitals in the quasi-one-dimensional lattice. The present perovskite-type cuprates offer a unique opportunity to explore novel quantum phases of correlated electrons in low-dimensional lattice, where the spin/charge/orbital degrees of freedom of A- and B-site ions are entangled.

Title: RFSoC-based radio-frequency reflectometry in gate-defined bilayer graphene quantum devices
Authors: Motoya Shinozaki, Tomoya Johmen, Aruto Hosaka, Takumi Seo, Shunsuke Yashima, Akitomi Shirachi, Kosuke Noro, Shoichi Sato, Takashi Kumasaka, Tsuyoshi Yoshida, Tomohiro Otsuka
Abstract: Quantum computers require both scalability and high performance for practical applications. While semiconductor quantum dots are promising candidates for quantum bits, the complexity of measurement setups poses an important challenge for scaling up these devices. Here, radio-frequency system-on-chip (RFSoC) technology is exepcted for a promising approach that combines scalability with flexibility. In this paper, we demonstrate RF reflectometry in gate-defined bilayer graphene quantum devices using RFSoC-based measurement architecture. By controlling the confinement strength through gate voltages, we achieve both Fabry-Pérot interferometer and quantum dot operations in a single device. Although impedance matching conditions currently limit the measurement sensitivity, we identify pathways for optimization through tunnel barrier engineering and resonator design. These results represent a step toward integrating high-bandwidth measurements with scalable quantum devices.

Title: Looking at bare transport coefficients in fluctuating hydrodynamics
Authors: Hiroyoshi Nakano, Yuki Minami, Keiji Saito
Abstract: Hydrodynamics at the macroscopic scale, composed of a vast ensemble of microscopic particles, is described by the Navier-Stokes equation. However, at the mesoscopic scale, bridging the microscopic and macroscopic domains, fluctuations become significant, necessitating the framework of fluctuating hydrodynamics for accurate descriptions. A central feature of this framework is the appearance of noises and transport coefficients, referred to as bare transport coefficients. These coefficients, generally different from the macroscopic transport coefficients of the deterministic Navier-Stokes equation, are challenging to measure directly because macroscopic measurements typically yield the latter coefficients. This paper addresses the questions of how bare transport coefficients manifest in measurable physical quantities and how practical methodologies can be developed for their determination. As a prototype example, we examine the shear viscosity of two-dimensional dense fluids. The numerical simulations of the fluctuating hydrodynamic equations reveal that near solid walls, where hydrodynamic fluctuations are significantly suppressed, the bare shear viscosity governs the fluid dynamics. The theoretical calculations, based on perturbation expansion of the fluctuating hydrodynamic equations, confirm this suppression of hydrodynamic fluctuations at walls and yield analytical expressions for the observed shear viscosity. Based on this finding, we develop a methodology to accurately determine the bare shear viscosity using a controlled shear flow. Furthermore, we provide detailed numerical investigations of the role of an ultraviolet cutoff length in fluctuating hydrodynamics. These establish that the lower bound of the ultraviolet cutoff length is on the order of atomic diameter and highlight that bare viscosity is determined solely by microscopic details below this scale.

Title: Anisotropic Exchange Spin Model to Investigate the Curie Temperature Dispersion of Finite-Size L10-FePt Magnetic Nanoparticles
Authors: Kohei Ochiai, Tomoyuki Tsuyama, Sumera Shimizu, Lei Zhang, Jin Watanabe, Fumito Kudo, Jian-Gang Zhu, Yoshishige Okuno
Abstract: We developed an anisotropic spin model that accounts for magnetic anisotropy and evaluated the Curie temperature (Tc) dispersion due to finite size effects in L10-FePt nanoparticles. In heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR) media, a next-generation magnetic recording technology, high-density recording is achieved by locally heating L10-FePt nanoparticles near their Tc and rapidly cooling them. However, variations in Tc caused by differences in particle size and shape can compromise recording stability and areal density capacity, making the control of Tc dispersion critical. In this study, we constructed atomistic LLG models to explicitly incorporate the spin exchange anisotropy of L10-FePt, based on parameters determined by first-principles calculations. Using this model, we evaluated the impact of particle size on Tc dispersion. As a result, (1) the Tc dispersion critical to the performance of HAMR can be reproduced, whereas it was previously underestimated by isotropic models and (2) approximately 70% of the experimentally observed Tc dispersion can be attributed to particle size effects. This research highlights the role of exchange anisotropy in amplifying finite-size effects and underscores the importance of size control in HAMR media.

Title: Ultra-Stable Ferrimagnetic Second-Order Topological Insulator in 2D Metal-Organic Framework
Authors: Meijun Wang, Yong-An Zhong, Lei Jin, Ying Liu, Xuefang Dai, Guodong Liu, Xiaoming Zhang
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) magnetic second-order topological insulators (SOTIs) exhibit distinct topological phases characterized by spin-polarized zero-dimensional (0D) corner states, which have garnered significant interest. However, 2D ferrimagnetic (FiM) SOTIs, particularly those that simultaneously exhibit ultra-stable corner states, are still lacking. Here, based on first-principles calculations and theoretical analysis, we reveal such SOTI state in a 2D metal-organic framework (MOF) material, Cr(pyz)2 (pyz = pyrazine). This material exhibits FiM ground state with an easy axis aligned along [001] direction. It hosts a nontrivial real Chern number in the spin-up channel, enabled by PT symmetry, with 0D corner states observable in disk. In contrast, the spin-down channel exhibits a trivial gapped bulk state. Notably, the topological corner states in monolayer Cr(pyz)2 show high robustness, even if the symmetries are broken by introducing defects, the corner states persist. We also considered other external perturbations, including uniaxial/biaxial strain, ligand rotation, and electric fields, the corner states still remain stable. Even more, the energy positions of the corner states are also nearly unchanged. This work is the first to identify ultra-stable FiM SOTI state in the MOF system, and provide an ideal platform for future experimental investigations and applications in spintronic devices.

Title: Self-assembly of Dipolar Crystals from Magnetic Colloids
Authors: Anuj Kumar Singh, Sanjay Puri, Varsha Banerjee
Abstract: We study the self-assembly of magnetic colloids using the Stockmayer (SM) model characterized by short-range Lennard-Jones interactions and long-range dipole-dipole interactions. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we design cooling protocols that yield perfectly assembled single-domain magnetic crystals. We identify cooling rates at which the system transforms from an amorphous glass to a crystal, where magnetic ordering promotes crystalline order. Remarkably, we observe that the latter develops via a spontaneous transition rather than through the traditional nucleation and growth mechanism. For a weakly dipolar fluid ($\mu=1$), this self-assembly results in a face-centered cubic (FCC) colloidal crystal with dipole moments chained along the (111) direction. For fluids with higher dipole moment ($\mu = 2.5$), the crystal structure shifts towards a body-centered orthorhombic (BCO) arrangement due to the compression of chains from strong dipolar attractions. These results provide valuable insights into the mechanisms driving crystallization in magnetic fluids, opening new avenues for understanding the formation of magnetically responsive colloidal magnetic crystals with promising applications.

Title: Fermionic free energies from \textit{ab initio} path integral Monte Carlo simulations of fictitious identical particles
Authors: Tobias Dornheim, Zhandos Moldabekov, Sebastian Schwalbe, Panagiotis Tolias, Jan Vorberger
Abstract: We combine the recent $\eta-$ensemble path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) approach to the free energy [T.~Dornheim \textit{et al.}, \textit{Phys.~Rev.~B} \textbf{111}, L041114 (2025)] with a recent fictitious partition function technique based on inserting a continuous variable that interpolates between the bosonic and fermionic limits [Xiong and Xiong, \textit{J.~Chem.~Phys.}~\textbf{157}, 094112 (2022)] to deal with the fermion sign problem. As a practical example, we apply our set-up to the warm dense uniform electron gas over a broad range of densities and temperatures. We obtain accurate results for the exchange--correlation free energy down to half the Fermi temperature, and find excellent agreement with the state-of-the-art parametrization by Groth \textit{et al.}~[\textit{Phys.~Rev.~Lett.}~\textbf{119}, 135001 (2017)]. Our work opens up new avenues for the future study of a host of interacting Fermi-systems, including warm dense matter, ultracold atoms, and electrons in quantum dots.

Title: Sol-gel transition in heteroassociative RNA-protein solutions: A quantitative comparison of coarse-grained simulations and the Semenov-Rubinstein theory
Authors: Xinxiang Chen, Jude Ann Vishnu, Pol Besenius, Julian König, Friederike Schmid
Abstract: Protein RNA-binding domains selectively interact with specific RNA sites, a key interaction that determines the emergent cooperative behaviors in RNA-protein mixtures. Through molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate the impact of the specific binding interactions on the phase transitions of an examplary RNA-protein system and compare it with predictions of the Semenov-Rubinstein theory of associative polymers. Our findings reveal a sol-gel (percolation) transition without phase separation, characterized by double reentrant behavior as the RNA or protein concentration increases. We highlight the crucial role of bridge formations in driving these transitions, particularly when binding sites are saturated. The theory quantitatively predicts the binding numbers at equilibrium in the semidilute regime, but it significantly overestimates the size of the concentration range where percolation is observed. This can partly be traced back to the fact that the mean-field assumption in the theory is not valid in the dilute regime, and that the theory neglects the existence of cycles in the connectivity graph of the percolating cluster at the sol-gel transition. Our study enriches the understanding of RNA-protein phase behaviors, providing valuable insights for the interpretation of experimental observations.

Title: Collective behaviors of self-propelled particles with tunable alignment angles
Authors: Zichen Qin, Nariya Uchida
Abstract: We present a novel aligning active matter model by extending the nematic alignment rule in self-propelled rods to tunable alignment angles, as represented by collision of cone-shaped particles. Non-vanishing alignment angles introduce frustration in the many-body interactions, and we investigate its effect on the collective behavior of the system. Through numerical simulations of an agent-based microscopic model, we found that the system exhibits distinct phenomenology compared to the original self-propelled rods. In particular, anti-parallel bands are observed in an intermediate parameter range. The linear stability analysis of the continuum description derived from the Boltzmann approach demonstrates qualitative consistency with the microscopic model, while frustration due to many-body interactions in the latter destabilizes homogeneous nematic order over a wide range of the alignment angle.

Title: Two-dimensional fully-compensated Ferrimagnetism
Authors: Yichen Liu, San-Dong Guo, Yongpan Li, Cheng-Cheng Liu
Abstract: Antiferromagnetic spintronics has long been a subject of intense research interest, and the recent introduction of altermagnetism has further ignited enthusiasm in the field. However, fully-compensated ferrimagnetism, which exhibits band spin splitting but zero net magnetization, has yet to receive enough attention. Since the experimental preparation of two-dimensional (2D) magnetic van der Waals (vdW) materials in 2017, 2D magnetic materials, thanks to their super tunability, have quickly become an important playground for spintronics. Here, we extend the concept of fully-compensated ferrimagnetism (fFIM) to two dimensions and propose 2D \textit{filling-enforced} fFIM, demonstrate its stability and ease of manipulation, and present three feasible realization schemes with respective exemplary candidate materials. A simple model for 2D fully-compensated ferrimagnets (fFIMs) is developed. Further investigation of 2D fFIMs' physical properties reveals that they not only exhibit significant magneto-optical response but also show fully spin-polarized currents and the anomalous Hall effect in the half-metallic states, displaying characteristics previously almost exclusive to ferromagnetic materials, greatly broadening the research and application prospects of spintronic materials.

Title: Electron-phonon interactions and tensor analysis in topological insulator bismuth telluride using angle resolved polarized Raman spectroscopy
Authors: Aditya Singh, Anna Elsukova, Divya Rawat, Saswata Talukdar, Surajit Saha, Arnaud le Febvrier, Per O. Å. Persson, Per Eklund, Ajay Soni
Abstract: We report on the angle-resolved polarized Raman spectroscopy and estimation of the Raman tensor elements using both classical and quantum treatments to analyse the polarized Raman spectra of single crystal Bismuth Telluride. The observed polar patterns and systematic variations in the relative intensities of four characteristic Raman active modes indicate a higher differential polarizability along the c-axis, accompanied by anisotropic photon-phonon interactions. This interplay of electron-photon-phonon interactions is crucial for understanding the lattice dynamics of Bismuth Telluride, which underpin its thermoelectric performance and topological properties.

Title: (111) Facet-engineered SnO2 as Electron Transport Layer for Efficient and Stable Triple-Cation Perovskite Solar Cells
Authors: Keshav Kumar Sharma, Rohit, Sochannao Machinao, Ramesh Karuppannan
Abstract: We report the (111) facet-engineered cubic phase SnO2 (C-SnO2) as a novel electron transport layer (ETL) for triple-cation mixed-halide Cs0.05(FA0.83MA0.17)0.95Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3 perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The C-SnO2 layer was prepared via a normal sol-gel process followed by the spin-coating technique. The (111) facet C-SnO2 layer provides a larger surface contact area with an adjacent perovskite layer, enhancing charge transfer dynamics at the interface. In addition, the well-matched overlapping band structures improve the charge extraction efficiency between the two layers. Using (111) facet C-SnO2 as ETLs, we obtain PSCs with a higher power conversion efficiency of 20.34% (0.09 cm2) than those employing tetragonal phase SnO2 ETL. The PSCs with C-SnO2 ETL retain over 81% of their initial efficiency even after 480 h. This work concludes with a brief discussion on recombination and charge transport mechanisms, providing ways to optimize C-SnO2 ETL to improve the PSCs' performance and stability.

Title: Nanoindentation responses of Fe-Cr alloys from room temperature to 600 °C

Abstract: In this work, the evolution of nanomechanical properties was studied systematically as a function of temperature, chemical, and microstructural complexity of different Fe-based alloys. Experiments were performed at different temperatures (room temperature, 200 C, 400 C, 600 C) using the nanoindentation technique on low activation Fe9Cr-1WVTa (Eurofer97), model Fe-9Cr-NiSiP, Fe-9Cr alloys, and pure iron samples, followed by microstructural observations. The results show varying softening and hardening effects depending on the experimental temperature, demonstrating Portevin-Le-Chatelier effect, i.e., dynamic strain aging phenomenon in model alloys. Sources of the dynamic strain aging instabilities were traced back to the interaction between dislocations and alloying elements such as interstitial carbon and substitutional chromium. The materials undergo dynamic recovery and recrystallization below the regions of high-temperature indentation depending on the pre-indentation dislocation density and the alloy composition. Our findings help in the understanding of the structure and mechanical property relationship in complex Eurofer97 alloy at high-temperatures for potential nuclear applications as structural materials.

Title: Vertex correction for the linear and nonlinear optical responses in superconductors: multiband effect and topological superconductivity
Authors: Hiroto Tanaka, Youichi Yanase
Abstract: Intensive research has revealed intriguing optical responses in topological materials. This paper focuses on the optical responses in $s$-wave superconductors with a Rashba spin-orbit coupling and a magnetic field, one of the platforms of topological superconductivity. On the one hand, to satisfy some conservation laws in superconducting responses, it is essential to take into account collective excitation modes. On the other hand, the optical response is a promising phenomenon for detecting hidden collective modes in superconductors. In this paper, we investigate the effect of collective excitation modes on the linear and second-order optical responses based on the self-consistent response approximation, which is formulated using the Kadanoff-Baym method. Our main results reveal that the Higgs mode enhances the optical responses when the Fermi level is close to the Dirac point. The enhancement is due to the multiband effects characterized by interband pairing. We also demonstrate the sign reversal of the photocurrent conductivity around the topological transition with increasing the Zeeman field. This finding supports the prediction in our previous work without considering collective excitation modes [H. Tanaka, et al., Phys. Rev. B 110, 014520 (2024)]. The sign reversal phenomenon is attributed to the magnetic injection current modified by the Higgs mode, and is proposed for a bulk probe of topological superconductors. We also discuss the interplay of quantum geometry and collective modes.

Title: Developing an unfolding-incorporated coarse-grained polymer model for fibrinogen to study the mechanical behaviour
Authors: Vivek Sharma, Poulomi Sadhukhan
Abstract: Fibrinogen is a protein found in blood that forms Fibrin polymer network to build a clot during wound healing process when there is a cut in the blood vessel. The fibrin fiber is highly stretchable and shows a complex mechanical properties. The fibrin monomer, Fibrinogen, has a very complex structure which is responsible for its unusual elastic behaviour. In this work, we focus on mechanism of unfolding of D-domain of Fibrinogen, and study its effect in the mechanical behaviour. We develop a coarse-grained (CG) bead-spring model for Fibrinogen which captures the unfolding of folded D-domains along with other necessary structural properties which affect the mechanical behaviour. The results from our unfolding-incorporated coarse-grained polymer (UCGP) model matches with the experimental results. This model has capacity to serve as the minimal unit to build a large-scale hierarchical structure of fibrin fiber and network to possibly unfold the mystery of fibrin's unusual elastic behaviour. This model can also be used for other polymers having folded domains or sacrificial bonds.

Title: Superconducting phenomena in systems with unconventional magnets
Authors: Yuri Fukaya, Bo Lu, Keiji Yada, Yukio Tanaka, Jorge Cayao
Abstract: In this work we review the recent advances on superconducting phenomena in junctions formed by superconductors and unconventional magnets. Conventional magnets, such as ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, are characterized by broken time-reversal symmetry but only ferromagnets produce a finite net magnetization due to parallel spin alignment and spin-split bands in momentum. Very recently, a new type of magnets have been reported and here we refer to them as \emph{unconventional magnets} because they exhibit special properties of both ferromagnets and antiferromagnets: they exhibit zero net magnetization (like antiferromagnets) and a nonrelativistic spin splitting of energy bands (like ferromagnets), both leading to anisotropic spin-polarized Fermi surfaces. An interesting property of unconventional magnets is that their magnetic order can be even or odd with respect to momentum, where \emph{$d$-wave altermagnets} and \emph{$p$-wave magnets} are the most representative examples. In this regard, $d$-wave altermagnetism and $p$-wave magnets are seen as counterparts in magnetism of the unconventional $d$-wave and $p$-wave superconducting states, respectively. While the impact of conventional magnetism on superconductivity has been largely studied, the combination of unconventional magnets and superconductivity has only lately attracted considerably attention. This work provides a comprehensive review of the recent progress on the interplay between superconductivity and unconventional magnets. In particular, we focus on the fundamental emerging superconducting phenomena and also discuss the potential implications towards quantum applications.

Title: Evidence for magnetic crystallization waves at the surface of $^3$He crystal
Authors: Igor Todoshchenko, Alexander Savin, Pertti J. Hakonen
Abstract: Ultralow temperature crystals of the helium isotopes $^3$He and $^4$He are intriguing quantum systems. Deciphering the complex features of these unusual materials has been made possible in large part by Alexander Andreev's groundbreaking research. In 1978, Andreev and Alexander Parshin predicted the existence of melting/freezing waves at the surface of a solid $^4$He crystal, which was subsequently promptly detected. Successively, for the fermionic $^3$He superfluid/solid interface, even more intricate crystallization waves were anticipated, although they have not been observed experimentally so far. In this work, we provide preliminary results on $^3$He crystals at the temperature $T = 0.41$\;mK, supporting the existence of spin supercurrents in the melting/freezing waves on the crystal surface below the antiferromagnetic ordering temperature $T_N= 0.93$\;mK, as predicted by Andreev. The spin currents that accompany such a melting-freezing wave make it a unique object, in which the inertial mass is distinctly different from the gravitational mass.

Title: A New Type of MPd5 Kagome Superconductors
Authors: Dan Li, Zhengxuan Wang, Panshi Jing, Mehrdad Shiri, Kun Wang, Chunlan Ma, Shijing Gong, Chuanxi Zhao, Tianxing Wang, Xiao Dong, Lin Zhuang, Wuming Liu, Yipeng An
Abstract: Kagome materials, which are composed of hexagons tiled with a shared triangle, have inspired enormous interest due to their unique structures and rich physical properties, but exploring superconducting material systems with new kagome structures is still an important research direction. Here, we predict a new type of kagome superconductors, MPd5 (M is a group IIA metal element), and identify that they exhibit coexistence of superconductivity and non-trivial topological properties. We uncover their phonon-mediated superconductivity by the density functional theory for superconductors (SCDFT), predicting the superconducting transition temperatures (Tc) of 2.64, 2.03, and 1.50 K for CaPd5, SrPd5, and BaPd5, respectively, which can be effectively tuned by external pressure and electron doping. The present results also demonstrate that MPd5 have various topological properties such as, CaPd5 shows topological non-trivial intersection near the Fermi level (EF). Our results indicate that the MPd5 materials can be an emerging material platform with rich exotic physics in their kagome structures, and render themselves excellent candidates for superconducting and advanced functional materials that could be utilized in topological quantum computing and information technology.

Title: Sign Changes in Heat, Spin, and Orbital Magnon Transport Coefficients in Kitaev Ferromagnets
Authors: Yannick Höpfner, Ingrid Mertig, Robin R. Neumann
Abstract: Both Kitaev and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions (DMI) are known to promote intrinsic contributions to the magnon Hall effects such as the thermal Hall and the spin Nernst effects in collinear magnets. Previously, it was reported that a sign change in those transversal transport coefficients only appears in the presence of Kitaev interaction, but not for DMI, which qualitatively distinguishes both kinds of spin-anisotropic interactions in ferromagnets. Herein, we systematically study how the magnon-mediated heat, spin, and orbital transport in longitudinal and transverse geometries evolves with a continuously varying Kitaev-to-DMI ratio, but a fixed magnon band structure. We show that several transport coefficients feature temperature-driven sign changes in the presence of Kitaev interaction, which are absent for DMI. In particular, we find a sign change in longitudinal orbital transport, the magnon orbital Seebeck effect, which is absent in the transverse geometry, the magnon orbital Nernst effect. This sets the orbital transport apart from the heat and spin transport, where we only find sign changes promoted by the Kitaev interaction in transverse, but not in the longitudinal geometry.

Title: Correlations of density and current fluctuations in single-file motion of hard spheres and in driven lattice gas with nearest-neighbor interaction
Authors: Sören Schweers, Gunter M. Schütz, Philipp Maass
Abstract: We analyze correlations between density fluctuations and between current fluctuations in a one-dimensional driven lattice gas with repulsive nearest-neighbor interaction and in single-file Brownian motion of hard spheres dragged across a cosine potential with constant force. By extensive kinetic Monte Carlo and Brownian dynamics simulations we show that density and current correlation functions in nonequilibrium steady states follow the scaling behavior of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class. In a coordinate frame comoving with the collective particle velocity, the current correlation function decays as $\sim -t^{-4/3}$ with time $t$. Density fluctuations spread superdiffusively as $\sim t^{2/3}$ at long times and their spatio-temporal behavior is well described by the KPZ scaling function. In the absence of the cosine potential, the correlation functions in the system of dragged hard spheres show scaling behavior according to the Edwards-Wilkinson universality class. In the coordinate frame comoving with the mean particle velocity, they behave as in equilibrium, with current correlations decaying as $\sim -t^{-3/2}$ and density fluctuations spreading diffusively as $\sim t^{1/2}$.

Title: String Formation and Arrested Ordering Kinetics in Nematics Induced by Polar Particles
Authors: Pawan Kumar Mishra, Partha Sarathi Mondal, Pratikshya Jena, Shradha Mishra
Abstract: Our study explores the mixture of polar particles in apolar environment. We employ a coarse-grained approach to model the mixture, where polar particles are in minority. The interaction between polar and apolar components is incorporated via a coupling term in the free energy. Coupling generates local interaction in the system which results in the formation of string like structures connecting a pair of half integer topological defects. The increase in the coupling strength or the density of polar particles results in the: Sharper strings with larger probability of connecting the topological defects of same charge and the enhanced dynamics of topological defects. However, the ordering kinetics of the system shows the delayed coarsening for larger coupling or polar density. Our results can be used to develop controlled kinetics as well as to detect the impurities in liquid crystals.

Title: Cavity QED Control of Quantum Hall Stripes
Authors: Lorenzo Graziotto, Josefine Enkner, Sambuddha Chattopadhyay, Jonathan B. Curtis, Ethan Koskas, Christian Reichl, Werner Wegscheider, Giacomo Scalari, Eugene Demler, Jérôme Faist
Abstract: Controlling quantum phases of materials with vacuum field fluctuations in engineered cavities is a novel route towards the optical control of emergent phenomena. We demonstrate, using magnetotransport measurements of a high-mobility two-dimensional electron gas, striking cavity-induced anisotropies in the electronic transport, including the suppression of the longitudinal resistance well below the resistivity at zero magnetic field. Our cavity-induced effects occur at ultra-low temperatures (< 200 mK) when the magnetic field lies between quantized Hall plateaus. We interpret our results as arising from the stabilization of thermally-disordered quantum Hall stripes. Our work presents a clear demonstration of the cavity QED control of a correlated electronic phase.

Title: Thermally-induced microstructural evolution in nanoparticle-based CuO, WO$_3$ and CuO-WO$_3$ thin films for hydrogen gas sensing
Authors: Kalyani Shaji, Stanislav Haviar, Petr Zeman, Michal Procházka, Radomír Čerstvý, Nirmal Kumar, Jiří Čapek
Abstract: This study systematically investigates the microstructural evolution of nanoparticle-based CuO, WO$_3$, and composite 'CuO-WO$_3$' thin films induced by their post-deposition annealing. The films were reactively deposited using a magnetron-based gas aggregation technique, with the composite films consisting of alternating monolayers of CuO and WO$_3$ nanoparticles. After deposition, the films were annealed in synthetic air at temperatures ranging from 200 to 400$^\circ$C and characterized using scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Annealing of the CuO films led to the most pronounced changes associated with a gradual enhancement of crystallinity accompanied by significant particle growth with increasing annealing temperature, while the WO$_3$ and CuO-WO$_3$ films were more thermally stable to crystallization and particle growth. Notably, at 400$^\circ$C, the CuO--WO$_3$ films crystallized into a novel $\gamma$-CuWO$_4$ phase. The annealed films were further evaluated for their gas-sensing performance upon H$_2$ exposure and the obtained results were analyzed in relation to film properties and the microstructural evolution induced by annealing.

Title: Lattice dynamics and spin-phonon coupling in the kagome spin ice HoAgGe
Authors: Shangfei Wu, Lingxiao Zhao, Wei Song, Mingshu Tan, Feng Jin, Tianping Ying, Jia-Xin Yin, Qingming Zhang
Abstract: We employ polarization-resolved Raman spectroscopy and first-principles phonon calculations to study the lattice dynamics and spin-phonon coupling in the kagome spin ice compound HoAgGe. Upon cooling, HoAgGe shows transitions from a nonmagnetic state at 300 K to a partially magnetic-ordered phase below T2 = 11.6 K, eventually reaching a fully-magnetic ordered phase below T1 = 7 K. We detect eight of ten Raman-active phonon modes at room temperature, with frequencies consistent with first-principles phonon calculations. We find that the low-energy phonon modes harden upon cooling, soften slightly below T2, and finally harden again below T1, suggesting finite spin-phonon coupling in HoAgGe. Furthermore, one high-energy mode at 185 cm-1 with E' symmetry exhibits a Fano lineshape due to electron-phonon coupling. Our Raman results establish finite spin-phonon coupling and electron-phonon coupling in the magnetic phase of HoAgGe, providing a foundation for future studies of the novel field-induced phases at low temperatures in HoAgGe.

Title: Interaction of dopants with the I$_3$-type basal stacking fault in hexagonal-diamond Si
Authors: Marc Túnica, Perpetua Wanjiru Muchiri, Alberto Zobelli, Anna Marzegalli, Emilio Scalise, Michele Amato
Abstract: Recently synthesized hexagonal-diamond silicon, germanium, and silicon-germanium nanowires exhibit remarkable optical and electronic properties when compared to cubic-diamond polytypes. Because of the metastability of the hexagonal-diamond phase, I$_3$-type basal stacking faults are frequently observed in these materials. In the present study, we employ density functional theory calculations to investigate the interaction of extrinsic dopants (group III, IV, and V elements) with the I$_3$-type basal stacking fault in hexagonal-diamond silicon. Contrary to the behavior observed in cubic-diamond silicon with intrinsic stacking faults, we demonstrate that neutral and negatively charged $p$-type impurities exhibit a marked tendency to occupy lattice sites far from the I$_3$-type basal stacking fault. The interaction of acceptors with the planar defect reduces their energetic stability. However, this effect is much less pronounced for neutral or positively charged $n$-type dopants and isovalent impurities. The thermodynamic energy barrier to segregation for these dopants is small and may even become negative, indicating a tendency to segregate into the fault. Through a detailed analysis of structural modifications, ionization effects, and impurity-level charge density distribution, we show that the origin of this behavior can be attributed to variations in the impurity's steric effects and its wave function character. Finally, all these results are validated by considering the extreme case of an abrupt hexagonal/cubic silicon interface, where acceptor segregation from the cubic to the hexagonal region is demonstrated, confirming the behavior observed for $p$-type dopants near to the I$_3$-type defect.

Title: Quantifying hydrogen bonding using electrically tunable nanoconfined water

Abstract: Hydrogen bonding plays a crucial role in biology and technology, yet it remains poorly understood and quantified despite its fundamental importance. Traditional models, which describe hydrogen bonds as electrostatic interactions between electropositive hydrogen and electronegative acceptors, fail to quantitatively capture bond strength, directionality, or cooperativity, and cannot predict the properties of complex hydrogen-bonded materials. Here, we introduce a novel approach that conceptualizes the effect of hydrogen bonds as elastic dipoles in an electric field, which captures a wide range of hydrogen bonding phenomena in various water systems. Using gypsum, a hydrogen bond heterostructure with two-dimensional structural crystalline water, we calibrate the hydrogen bond strength through an externally applied electric field. We show that our approach quantifies the strength of hydrogen bonds directly from spectroscopic measurements and reproduces a wide range of key properties of confined water reported in the literature. Using only the stretching vibration frequency of confined water, we can predict hydrogen bond strength, local electric field, O-H bond length, and dipole moment. Our work also introduces hydrogen bond heterostructures - a new class of electrically and chemically tunable materials that offer stronger, more directional bonding compared to van der Waals heterostructures, with potential applications in areas such as catalysis, separation, and energy storage.

Title: Fine-tuning foundation models of materials interatomic potentials with frozen transfer learning
Authors: Mariia Radova, Wojciech G. Stark, Connor S. Allen, Reinhard J. Maurer, Albert P. Bartók
Abstract: Machine-learned interatomic potentials are revolutionising atomistic materials simulations by providing accurate and scalable predictions within the scope covered by the training data. However, generation of an accurate and robust training data set remains a challenge, often requiring thousands of first-principles calculations to achieve high accuracy. Foundation models have started to emerge with the ambition to create universally applicable potentials across a wide range of materials. While foundation models can be robust and transferable, they do not yet achieve the accuracy required to predict reaction barriers, phase transitions, and material stability. This work demonstrates that foundation model potentials can reach chemical accuracy when fine-tuned using transfer learning with partially frozen weights and biases. For two challenging datasets on reactive chemistry at surfaces and stability and elastic properties of tertiary alloys, we show that frozen transfer learning with 10-20% of the data (hundreds of datapoints) achieves similar accuracies to models trained from scratch (on thousands of datapoints). Moreover, we show that an equally accurate, but significantly more efficient surrogate model can be built using the transfer learned potential as the ground truth. In combination, we present a simulation workflow for machine learning potentials that improves data efficiency and computational efficiency.

Title: Structural and superconducting parameters of highly compressed sulfur
Authors: Evgeny F. Talantsev, Evgeniya G. Valova-Zaharevskaya
Abstract: Sulfur was the first nonmetal element which was transformed to a superconductor by applying megabar pressure. Recent pioneering experimental developments in measuring the superconducting energy gap $\Delta(T)$ in compressed sulfur using tunneling spectroscopy (Du $\textit{et al}$., $\textit{Phys. Rev. Lett.}$ $\textbf{133}$, 036002 (2024)) initiated an interest in better understanding real atomic structure and superconducting properties of this element at high pressure. Here, we analyzed available experimental data on highly compressed sulfur, and, from the $\Delta(T)$ data reported by Du $\textit{et al}$. (2024), we extracted the specific heat jump at the transition temperature of ${\Delta}C_{el}/{\gamma}T_{c} = 1.8$. We also developed a model to extract the Debye temperatures ${\Theta}_D$ for sulfur and $H_{3}S$ in two-phases sample from the temperature-dependent resistance $R(T)$. for better understanding of material structure, here we proposed to use a size-strain map for highly compressed samples, and we revealed this size-strain map for laser-heated sulfur in a diamond anvil cell with a mixture of sulfur and $H{_3}S$. Finally, we found that superconducting sulfur exhibits a moderate level of nonadiabaticity $0.04 \leq {\Theta}_{D}/T_{F} \leq 0.15$ (where $T_{F}$ is the Fermi temperature), which is similar to $MgB_2$, pnictides, cuprates, $La_{4}H_{23}$, $ThH_{9}$, $H_{3}S$, $LaBeH_{8}$, and $LaH_{10}$.

Title: Local signatures of altermagnetism
Authors: Jannik Gondolf, Andreas Kreisel, Mercè Roig, Yue Yu, Daniel F. Agterberg, Brian M. Andersen
Abstract: Altermagnets constitute a class of collinear compensated Néel ordered magnets that break time-reversal symmetry and feature spin-split band structures. Based on versatile microscopic models able to capture the altermagnetic sublattice degrees of freedom, we study characteristic local signatures of altermagnetism near disorder sites. We give a complete list of two-dimensional models that exhibit altermagnetism classified by their corresponding layer groups. Specifically, we calculate the local density of states in the vicinity of pointlike nonmagnetic impurities and expose its spatial dependence for two minimal models showcasing $d$-wave and $g$-wave altermagnetism. The momentum structure of the nodes ($d$-wave, $g$-wave, etc.) is directly imprinted on the total local density of states, thus measurable by scanning tunneling conductance experiments. This signature is present both in the spin-resolved as well as the spin-summed local density of states. We find a weaker response in the nonmagnetic state from the anisotropic crystal environment and uncover the importance of the sublattice degree of freedom to model altermagnets. We also study coexistence phases of altermagnetism and superconductivity and provide predictions for the local impurity response of in-gap bound states. The response of impurity bound states strongly enhances the distinct altermagnetic signature.

Title: Controlling curvature of self-assembling surfaces via patchy particle design
Authors: Andraž Gnidovec, Simon Čopar
Abstract: Curved structures in soft matter and biological systems commonly emerge as a result of self-assembly processes where building blocks aggregate in a controlled manner, giving rise to specific system structure and properties. Learning how to precisely tune the curved geometry of these assemblies can in turn elucidate new ways of controlling their functionality. We discuss how one can target self-assembly into surfaces with specified Gaussian curvature in a one-component system of model patchy particles. Given the vast design space of potential patch distributions, we address the problem using an inverse design approach based on automatic differentiation and develop an optimization scheme which solves the exploding gradients problem that arises when we differentiate through long molecular dynamics trajectories. We discuss the model requirements for successful optimization, determine the significant hyperparameter choices influencing algorithm performance and, finally, we demonstrate that we can consistently design patch patterns for assembly into clusters with different target curvature radii.

Title: Formation mechanism, stability and role of zinc and sulfur vacancies on the electronic properties and optical response of ZnS
Authors: P.R.A de Oliveira, L.Lima, G.Felix, P.Venezuela, F.Stavale
Abstract: Combining experimental and theoretical tools, we report that Zn vacanciesplay an important role in the electronic and optical responses of ZnS sphalerite. The defective surface of ZnS (001) single crystal prepared in ultra-highvacuum conditions, has been shown to exhibit a semiconducting character instead of the insulating properties of the pristine structure, as revealed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Interestingly, this effect is attributed to the formation of zinc vacancies in the ZnS system, which also alter the optical response of the material, as supported by photoluminescence (PL) measurements comparing pristine and S-rich (Zn-poor) ZnS. To address these findings from a theoretical point of view, first principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) were performed. The optical properties of cation-defective ZnS were evaluated using random-phase approximation and hybrid functional DFT calculations. These calculations revealed absorption peaks in the visible range in the defective ZnS rather than solely in the ultra-violet range obtained for defect-free ZnS. The combination of this finding with joint density of states (JDOS) analysis explains the emergence of new luminescence peaks observed in the PL spectra of cation-defective ZnS. These findings highlight the role of Zn vacancies in tuning ZnS optical properties, making it a potential candidate for optoelectronic applications such as LEDs and photodetectors.

Title: Universal Semantic Embeddings of Chemical Elements for Enhanced Materials Inference and Discovery
Authors: Yunze Jia, Yuehui Xian, Yangyang Xu, Pengfei Dang, Xiangdong Ding, Jun Sun, Yumei Zhou, Dezhen Xue
Abstract: We present a framework for generating universal semantic embeddings of chemical elements to advance materials inference and discovery. This framework leverages ElementBERT, a domain-specific BERT-based natural language processing model trained on 1.29 million abstracts of alloy-related scientific papers, to capture latent knowledge and contextual relationships specific to alloys. These semantic embeddings serve as robust elemental descriptors, consistently outperforming traditional empirical descriptors with significant improvements across multiple downstream tasks. These include predicting mechanical and transformation properties, classifying phase structures, and optimizing materials properties via Bayesian optimization. Applications to titanium alloys, high-entropy alloys, and shape memory alloys demonstrate up to 23% gains in prediction accuracy. Our results show that ElementBERT surpasses general-purpose BERT variants by encoding specialized alloy knowledge. By bridging contextual insights from scientific literature with quantitative inference, our framework accelerates the discovery and optimization of advanced materials, with potential applications extending beyond alloys to other material classes.

Recently, TO with $S_3$ gauge symmetry was identified as a sweet spot -- simple enough to emerge from finite-depth adaptive circuits yet powerful enough to support a universal topological gate-set. In these notes, we review how anyon braiding and measurement in $S_3$ TO are primitives for topological quantum computation and we explicitly demonstrate universality. These topological operations are made concrete in the $S_3$ quantum double lattice model, aided by the introduction of a generalized ribbon operator. This provides a roadmap for near-term quantum platforms.

Title: The Modified Airy Function Approximation Applied to the Double-Well Potential
Authors: N. Wine, J. Achtymichuk, F. Marsiglio
Abstract: The single harmonic oscillator and double-well potentials are important systems in quantum mechanics. The single harmonic oscillator is {\it the} paradigm in physics, and is taught in nearly all beginner undergraduate classes, while the double-well potential illustrates the two important principles of quantum tunnelling and linear superposition. While exact analytical solutions of the Schrodinger equation exist for both of these potentials, they are also employed to benchmark the use of approximate techniques which may be the only recourse for more complicated potentials. In this paper, we review the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation for both these potentials. While this approximation is known for its accurate energies, we will instead emphasize how poor the WKB wave functions are. The inaccuracy of the WKB wave functions will then motivate us to adopt the lesser-known Modified Airy Function (MAF) approximation, which alleviates the deficiencies of the WKB wave functions. We will review the MAF solution to the simple harmonic oscillator potential, and then apply the MAF to the double-well potential. We find accurate eigenvalues and, more importantly, very accurate wave functions. We conclude with the suggestion that an introduction to the MAF should be included in undergraduate courses to complement the WKB.

Title: Antifragility and response to damage in the synchronization of oscillators on networks
Authors: M. A. Polo-González, A. P. Riascos, L. K. Eraso-Hernandez
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a mathematical framework to assess the impact of damage, defined as the reduction of weight in a specific link, on identical oscillator systems governed by the Kuramoto model and coupled through weighted networks. We analyze how weight modifications in a single link affect the system when its global function is to achieve the synchronization of coupled oscillators starting from random initial phases. We introduce different measures that allow the identification of cases where damage enhances synchronization (antifragile response), deteriorates it (fragile response), or has no significant impact. Using numerical solutions of the Kuramoto model, we investigate the effects of damage on network links where antifragility emerges. Our analysis includes lollipop graphs of varying sizes and a comprehensive evaluation and all the edges of 109 non-isomorphic graphs with six nodes. The approach is general and can be applied to study antifragility in other oscillator systems with different coupling mechanisms, offering a pathway for the quantitative exploration of antifragility in diverse complex systems.

Title: Boundary-Driven Complex Brillouin Zone in Non-Hermitian Electric Circuits
Authors: Yung Kim, Sonu Verma, Minwook Kyung, Kyungmin Lee, Wenwen Liu, Shuang Zhang, Bumki Min, Moon Jip Park
Abstract: Complex-valued physical quantities, often non-conserved, represent key phenomena in non-Hermitian systems such as dissipation and localization. Recent advancements in non-Hermitian physics have revealed boundary-condition-sensitive band structures, characterized by a continuous manifold of complex-valued momentum known as the generalized Brillouin zone (GBZ). However, the ability to actively manipulate the GBZ and its associated topological properties has remained largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate a controllable manipulation of the GBZ by adjusting the boundary Hamiltonian and leveraging the boundary sensitivity in a circuit lattice. Our observations reveal that the GBZ forms multiple separated manifolds containing both decaying and growing wave functions, in contrast to the previously observed non-Hermitian skin effect under open boundary condition (OBC). By continuously deforming the GBZ, we observe the topological phase transitions of innate topological structure of GBZ that are enriched by complex properties of non-Hermitian physical variables. Notably, such topological phase transition is governed by boundary conditions rather than bulk properties, underscoring the extreme boundary sensitivity unique to non-Hermitian systems.

Title: Quantum Emitters in Rhombohedral Boron Nitride
Authors: Angus Gale, Mehran Kianinia, Jake Horder, Connor Tweedie, Mridul Singhal, Dominic Scognamiglio, Jiajie Qi, Kaihui Li, Carla Verdi, Igor Aharonovich, Milos Toth
Abstract: Rhombohedral boron nitride (rBN) is an emerging wide-bandgap van der Waals (vdW) material that combines strong second-order nonlinear optical properties with the structural flexibility of layered 2D systems. Here we show that rBN hosts optically-addressable spin defects and single-photon emitters (SPEs). Both are fabricated deterministically, using site-specific techniques, and are compared to their analogues in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). Emission spectra in hBN and rBN are compared, and computational models of defects in hBN and rBN are used to elucidate the debated atomic structure of the B-center SPE in BN. Our results establish rBN as a monolithic vdW platform that uniquely combines second-order nonlinear optical properties, optically addressable spin defects, and high-quality SPEs, opening new possibilities for integrated quantum and nonlinear photonics.

Title: Emergence of coupled Korteweg-de Vries equations in $m$ fields
Authors: Sharath Jose, Manas Kulkarni, Vishal Vasan
Abstract: The Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation is of fundamental importance in a wide range of subjects with generalization to multi-component systems relevant for multi-species fluids and cold atomic mixtures. We present a general framework in which a family of multi-component KdV (mKdV) equations naturally arises from a broader mathematical structure under reasonable assumptions on the nature of the nonlinear couplings. In particular, we derive a universal form for such a system of $m$ KdV equations that is parameterized by $m$ non-zero real numbers and two symmetric functions of those $m$ numbers. Secondly, we show that physically relevant setups such as $N\geq m+1$ multi-component nonlinear Schrödinger equations (MNLS), under scaling and perturbative treatment, reduce to such a mKdV equation for a specific choice of the symmetric functions. The reduction from MNLS to mKdV requires one to be in a suitable parameter regime where the associated sound speeds are repeated. Hence, we connect the assumptions made in the derivation of mKdV system to physically interpretable assumptions for the MNLS equation. Lastly, our approach provides a systematic foundation for facilitating a natural emergence of multi-component partial differential equations starting from a general mathematical structure.

Title: Learning Chern Numbers of Topological Insulators with Gauge Equivariant Neural Networks
Authors: Longde Huang, Oleksandr Balabanov, Hampus Linander, Mats Granath, Daniel Persson, Jan E. Gerken
Abstract: Equivariant network architectures are a well-established tool for predicting invariant or equivariant quantities. However, almost all learning problems considered in this context feature a global symmetry, i.e. each point of the underlying space is transformed with the same group element, as opposed to a local ``gauge'' symmetry, where each point is transformed with a different group element, exponentially enlarging the size of the symmetry group. Gauge equivariant networks have so far mainly been applied to problems in quantum chromodynamics. Here, we introduce a novel application domain for gauge-equivariant networks in the theory of topological condensed matter physics. We use gauge equivariant networks to predict topological invariants (Chern numbers) of multiband topological insulators. The gauge symmetry of the network guarantees that the predicted quantity is a topological invariant. We introduce a novel gauge equivariant normalization layer to stabilize the training and prove a universal approximation theorem for our setup. We train on samples with trivial Chern number only but show that our models generalize to samples with non-trivial Chern number. We provide various ablations of our setup. Our code is available at this https URL.

Title: State-space kinetic Ising model reveals task-dependent entropy flow in sparsely active nonequilibrium neuronal dynamics
Authors: Ken Ishihara, Hideaki Shimazaki
Abstract: Neuronal ensemble activity, including coordinated and oscillatory patterns, exhibits hallmarks of nonequilibrium systems with time-asymmetric trajectories to maintain their organization. However, assessing time asymmetry from neuronal spiking activity remains challenging. The kinetic Ising model provides a framework for studying the causal, nonequilibrium dynamics in spiking recurrent neural networks. Recent theoretical advances in this model have enabled time-asymmetry estimation from large-scale steady-state data. Yet, neuronal activity often exhibits time-varying firing rates and coupling strengths, violating steady-state assumption. To overcome these limitations, we developed a state-space kinetic Ising model that accounts for non-stationary and nonequilibrium properties of neural systems. This approach incorporates a mean-field method for estimating time-varying entropy flow, a key measure for maintaining the system's organization by dissipation. Applying this method to mouse visual cortex data revealed greater variability in causal couplings during task engagement despite the reduced neuronal activity with increased sparsity. Moreover, higher-performing mice exhibited increased entropy flow in higher-firing neurons during task engagement, suggesting that stronger directed activity emerged in a fewer neurons within sparsely active populations. These findings underscore the model's utility in uncovering intricate asymmetric causal dynamics in neuronal ensembles and linking them to behavior through the thermodynamic underpinnings of neural computation.

Title: A toolbox of spin-adapted generalized Pauli constraints
Authors: Julia Liebert, Yannick Lemke, Murat Altunbulak, Tomasz Maciazek, Christian Ochsenfeld, Christian Schilling
Abstract: We establish a toolbox for studying and applying spin-adapted generalized Pauli constraints (GPCs) in few-electron quantum systems. By exploiting the spin symmetry of realistic $N$-electron wave functions, the underlying one-body pure $N$-representability problem simplifies, allowing us to calculate the GPCs for larger system sizes than previously accessible. We then uncover and rigorously prove a superselection rule that highlights the significance of GPCs: whenever a spin-adapted GPC is (approximately) saturated - referred to as (quasi)pinning - the corresponding $N$-electron wave function assumes a simplified structure. Specifically, in a configuration interaction expansion based on natural orbitals only very specific spin configuration state functions may contribute. To assess the nontriviality of (quasi)pinning, we introduce a geometric measure that contrasts it with the (quasi)pinning induced by simple (spin-adapted) Pauli constraints. Applications to few-electron systems suggest that previously observed quasipinning largely stems from spin symmetries.

Title: MoMa: A Modular Deep Learning Framework for Material Property Prediction
Authors: Botian Wang, Yawen Ouyang, Yaohui Li, Yiqun Wang, Haorui Cui, Jianbing Zhang, Xiaonan Wang, Wei-Ying Ma, Hao Zhou
Abstract: Deep learning methods for material property prediction have been widely explored to advance materials discovery. However, the prevailing pre-train then fine-tune paradigm often fails to address the inherent diversity and disparity of material tasks. To overcome these challenges, we introduce MoMa, a Modular framework for Materials that first trains specialized modules across a wide range of tasks and then adaptively composes synergistic modules tailored to each downstream scenario. Evaluation across 17 datasets demonstrates the superiority of MoMa, with a substantial 14% average improvement over the strongest baseline. Few-shot and continual learning experiments further highlight MoMa's potential for real-world applications. Pioneering a new paradigm of modular material learning, MoMa will be open-sourced to foster broader community collaboration.

Title: Accurate and efficient machine learning interatomic potentials for finite temperature modeling of molecular crystals
Authors: Flaviano Della Pia, Benjamin X. Shi, Venkat Kapil, Andrea Zen, Dario Alfè, Angelos Michaelides
Abstract: As with many parts of the natural sciences, machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are revolutionizing the modeling of molecular crystals. However, challenges remain for the accurate and efficient calculation of sublimation enthalpies - a key thermodynamic quantity measuring the stability of a molecular crystal. Specifically, two key stumbling blocks are: (i) the need for thousands of ab initio quality reference structures to generate training data; and (ii) the sometimes unreliable nature of density functional theory, the main technique for generating such data. Exploiting recent developments in foundational models for chemistry and materials science alongside accurate quantum diffusion Monte Carlo benchmarks, offers a promising path forward. Herein, we demonstrate the generation of MLIPs capable of describing molecular crystals at finite temperature and pressure with sub-chemical accuracy, using as few as $\sim 200$ data structures; an order of magnitude improvement over the current state-of-the-art. We apply this framework to compute the sublimation enthalpies of the X23 dataset, accounting for anharmonicity and nuclear quantum effects, achieving sub-chemical accuracy with respect to experiment. Importantly, we show that our framework can be generalized to crystals of pharmaceutical relevance, including paracetamol and aspirin. Nuclear quantum effects are also accurately captured as shown for the case of squaric acid. By enabling accurate modeling at ambient conditions, this work paves the way for deeper insights into pharmaceutical and biological systems.

Title: Spin-$s$ $Q$-systems: Twist and Open Boundaries
Authors: Yi-Jun He, Jue Hou, Yi-Chao Liu, Zi-Xi Tan
Abstract: In integrable spin chains, the spectral problem can be solved by the method of Bethe ansatz, which transforms the problem of diagonalization of the Hamiltonian into the problem of solving a set of algebraic equations named Bethe equations. In this work, we systematically investigate the spin-$s$ XXX chain with twisted and open boundary conditions using the rational $Q$-system, which is a powerful tool to solve Bethe equations. We establish basic frameworks of the rational $Q$-system and confirm its completeness numerically in both cases. For twisted boundaries, we investigate the polynomiality conditions of the rational $Q$-system and derive physical conditions for singular solutions of Bethe equations. For open boundaries, we uncover novel phenomena such as hidden symmetries and magnetic strings under specific boundary parameters. Hidden symmetries lead to the appearance of extra degeneracies in the Hilbert space, while the magnetic string is a novel type of exact string configuration, whose length depends on the boundary magnetic fields. These findings, supported by both analytical and numerical evidences, offer new insights into the interplay between symmetries and boundary conditions.

Title: Interaction of functional brain networks is formed by k-clique percolation in the human structural connectome
Authors: V. Tiselko, O. Dogonasheva, A. Myshkin, O. Valba
Abstract: The human structural connectome has a complex internal community organization, characterized by a high degree of overlap and related to functional and cognitive phenomena. We explored connectivity properties in connectome networks and showed that $k$-clique percolation of an anomalously high order is characteristic of the human structural connectome. The resulting structural organization maintains a high local density of connectivity distributed throughout the connectome while preserving the overall sparsity of the network. To analyze these findings, we proposed a novel model for the emergence of high-order clique percolation during network formation with a phase transition dynamic under constraints on connection length. Investigating the structural basis of functional brain subnetworks, we identified a direct relationship between their interaction and the formation of clique clusters within their structural connections. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that the percolating clique cluster serves as a distributed boundary between interacting functional subnetworks, showing the complex, complementary nature of their structural connections. We also examined the difference between individual-specific and common structural connections and found that the latter plays a sustaining role in the connectivity of structural communities. At the same time, the superiority of individual connections, in contrast to common ones, creates variability in the interaction of functional brain subnetworks.

Title: Compositional phase stability in medium-entropy and high-entropy Cantor-Wu alloys from an ab initio all-electron, Landau-type theory and atomistic modelling
Authors: Christopher D. Woodgate, Julie B. Staunton
Abstract: We describe implementation and analysis of a first-principles theory, derived in an earlier work, for the leading terms in an expansion of a Gibbs free energy of a multi-component alloy in terms of order parameters that characterize potential, compositional phases. The theory includes effects of rearranging charge and other electronics from changing atomic occupancies on lattice sites. As well as the rigorous description of atomic short-range order in the homogeneously disordered phase, pairwise interaction parameters suited for atomistic modelling in a multicomponent setting can be calculated. From our study of an indicative series of the Cantor-Wu alloys, NiCo, NiCoCr, NiCoFeCr, and NiCoFeMnCr, we find that the interactions are not approximated well either as pseudobinary or restricted to nearest neighbour range. Our computed order-disorder transition temperatures are low, consistent with experimental observations, and the nature of the ordering is dominated by correlations between Ni, Co, and Cr, while Fe and Mn interact weakly. Further atomistic modelling suggests that there is no true single-phase low-temperature ground state for these multicomponent systems. Instead the single-phase solid solution is kept stable to low temperatures by the large configurational entropy and the Fe, Mn dilution effects. The computationally cost-effectiveness of our method makes it a good candidate for further exploration of the space of multicomponent alloys.

Title: Critical Behavior and Duality in Dimensionally Reduced Planar Chern-Simons Superconductors
Authors: Yi-Hui Xing, Lin Zhuang, E. C. Marino, Wu-Ming Liu
Abstract: Tha quantum electrodynamics of particles constrained to move on a plane is not a fully dimensionally reduced theory because the gauge fields through which they interact live in higher dimensions. By constraining the gauge field to the surface of the bulk, we obtain a fully reduced planar Abelian Chern-Simons Higgs model that can describe the vortex dynamics and second-order superconducting-normal phase transitions in planar Chern-Simons superconductors. Dual analyses performed before and after dimensional reduction yield the same Lagrangian for describing the vortex dynamics, indicating the self-consistency of our reduced theory. Compared to ordinary (2+1)-dimensional electrodynamics, we obtain anomalous fermion statistical vortices, consistent with results considering boundary effects. An additional electric charge constraint and different Chern-Simons parameter constraints are also found, which may help define a self-dual conformal field theory. Our renormalization group analysis shows that the quantized critical exponent depends on the Chern-Simons parameter. Quench disorder can bring more stable fixed points with different dynamical critical exponents. If we dimensionally reduce to a curved surface, our theory can also be extended to curved spacetimes, where geometric flow will be introduced and compete with vortex flow.

Title: Universal term of Entanglement Entropy in the $π$-flux Hubbard model
Authors: Yuan Da Liao
Abstract: Researchers in physical science aim to uncover universal features in strongly interacting many-body systems, often hidden in complicated observables like entanglement entropy (EE). The non-local nature of EE makes it challenging to compute numerically, necessitating the development of an unbiased and convenient algorithm. In this paper, we use quantum Monte Carlo to reveal that the coefficient of variation in direct EE calculations increases exponentially with system size, leading to inaccuracies. To address this issue, we develop a power incremental algorithm and a technique for straightforwardly calculating the universal term of EE, successfully evaluating the EE of a 2D Hubbard model. Our numerical results demonstrate the consistency of the universal coefficient of EE from sharp corners at the Gross-Neveu quantum critical point and for free Dirac fermions. Our method can also be applied to other unstable observables, such as partition functions, entanglement spectra, and negativity, thereby fostering computational and theoretical progress.

Title: Low temperature phase of AuSn$_{4}$ induced by the van der Waals interactions
Authors: Shivam Yadav, Sajid Sekh, Andrzej Ptok
Abstract: AuSn$_{4}$ is the example of an compound that exhibits topological properties. Recent XRD measurements reveal an ambiguous nature of the crystal structure, as it can be realized with either Aea2 or Ccca symmetry. Motivated by this, we analyze the dynamical stability of the compound. We discuss the role of van der Waals (vdW) corrections within the ab initio calculation. Interestingly, our main result indicates that AuSn$_{4}$ can be unstable with both Aea2 and Ccca symmetries, due to the soft modes in the phonon spectra. From the soft mode analyses we find dynamically stable Pc structure. This structure has always smaller energy than Aea2 or Ccca crystal and it stays independent of the vdW correction. We also show that the comparison of theoretical electronic properties with the experimental ARPES measurements. Our findings may be valuable in the future investigations of AuSn$_{4}$-like compounds.

Title: Relaxation to persistent currents in a Hubbard trimer coupled to fermionic baths
Authors: Nikodem Szpak, Gernot Schaller, Ralf Schützhold, Jürgen König
Abstract: We consider a ring of fermionic quantum sites, modeled by the Fermi--Hubbard Hamiltonian, in which electrons can move and interact strongly via the Coulomb repulsion. The system is coupled to fermionic cold baths which by the exchange of particles and energy induce relaxation in the system. We eliminate the environment and describe the system effectively by Lindblad master equations in various versions valid for different coupling parameter regimes. The early relaxation phase proceeds in a universal way, irrespective of the relative couplings and approximations. The system settles down to its low--energy sector and is consecutively well approximated by the Heisenberg model. We compare different Lindblad approaches which, in the late relaxation, push the system towards different final states with opposite, extreme spin orders, from ferromagenetic to antiferromagnetic. Due to spin frustration in the trimer (a three site ring), degenerate ground states are formed by spin waves (magnons). The system described by the global coherent version of the Lindblad operators relaxes towards the final states carrying directed persistent spin currents. We numerically confirm these predictions.

Title: tda-segmentor: A tool to extract and analyze local structure and porosity features in porous materials
Authors: Aditya Vasudevan, Jorge Zorrilla Prieto, Sergei Zorkaltsev, Maciej Haranczyk
Abstract: Local geometrical features of a porous material such as the shape and size of a pore or the curvature of a solid ligament often affect the macroscopic properties of the material, and their characterization is necessary to fully understand the structure-property this http URL this contribution, we present an approach to automatically segment large porous structures into such local features. Our work takes inspiration from techniques available in Topological Data Analysis(TDA).In particular, using Morse theory, we generate Morse-Smale Complexes(MSC) of our structures that segment the structure, and/or its porosity into individual features that can then be compared. We develop a tool that is built on the topology toolkit (TTK) library, an open source platform for the topological analysis of scalar data, with which we can perform segmentation of these structures. Our tool takes a volumetric grid representation as an input, which can be generated from atomistic or mesh structure models and any function defined on such grid, e.g. the distance to the surface or the interaction energy with a probe. We demonstrate the applicability of the tool by two examples related with analysis of porosity in zeolite materials as well as analysis of ligaments in a porous metal structure. Specifically, by segmenting the pores in the structure we demonstrate some applications to zeolites such as assessing pore-similarity between structures or evaluating the accessible volume to a target molecule such as methane that can be adsorbed to its surface. Moreover, once the MSC's are generated, we can construct graph representations of the void space, replacing the entire pore structure by a simply connected graph. Similarly, the same tool is used to segment and generate graphs representing the solid structure and we show how they can be used to correlate structure and mechanical properties of the material.

Title: Order-by-disorder without quantum zero-point fluctuations in the pyrochlore Heisenberg ferromagnet with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions
Authors: Alexander Hickey, Daniel Lozano-Gómez, Michel J. P. Gingras
Abstract: Order-by-disorder, whereby fluctuations lift an accidental classical ground state degeneracy to stabilize a subset of ordered states, is a recurrent and prominent theme in the field of frustrated magnetism where magnetic moments are subject to competing interactions. Thus far, such a phenomenon has been discussed in systems where the quantum ground state is not a classical product state. In such a case, both thermal and quantum fluctuations act to lift the accidental classical degeneracy, begging the question of whether one mechanism of order-by-disorder is possible without the other. In this paper, we present results exposing an uncharted route to order-by-disorder, one without quantum zero-point fluctuations, in the ferromagnetic pyrochlore Heisenberg system with the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction as the leading perturbation. We prove that any colinear ferromagnetic state is an exact eigenstate while thermal fluctuations give rise to a preference in the magnetization direction. Using linear spin wave theory, we find that the anisotropy appears at lowest order as a sub-leading term in the low-temperature expansion of the free energy, proportional to $T^{7/2}$. Our results thus show that the phenomenon of thermal order-by-disorder can occur even in the absence of quantum zero-point fluctuations driving quantum order-by-disorder, this being so in particular when the accidentally degenerate ground state of the classical model turns out to be an exact eigenstate of the quantum version of the model. In addition, we find that when the DM interaction is large, the fully polarized ferromagnetic ground state becomes unstable for a spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ system within the framework of non-linear spin wave theory, a result that is presumably closely related to the recent report of a quantum spin liquid in this spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ model reported in [this https URL].

Title: Revealing Symmetry-Broken Superconducting Configurations by Density Functional Theory
Authors: Zi-Kui Liu, Shun-Li Shang
Abstract: A coherent theory for the superconductivity of both conventional and unconventional superconductors is currently lacking. Here we show that superconductivity arises from the formation of a symmetry-broken superconducting configuration (SCC) due to atomic perturbation of the normal conducting configuration (NCC). This perturbation creates straight one-dimensional tunnels (SODTs) for charge density of electrons and/or holes as revealed by the calculations based on density functional theory (DFT). The SODTs act as resistance-free superhighways and are correlated to the Cooper pairs in the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory. The formation of SODTs implies that the electron-phonon interaction in the BCS theory can be represented by the difference in charge densities between SCC and NCC predicted by DFT. The present work highlights that in conventional superconductors, SODTs are embedded within the bulk materials and are easily destroyed by phonon vibrations, resulting in a low critical superconducting temperature (T_C). Conversely, in unconventional superconductors such as YBa2Cu3O7 (YBCO7), SODTs are protected by a layered pontoon structure with very weak bonding to the bulk materials, maintaining SODTs' stability at higher temperatures and leading to a much higher T_C. The present approach is validated for 13 conventional superconductors of 18 pure elements examined in this work, including the presently predicted superconductivity in Cu, Ag, Au, Sb, and Bi at 0 K and 0 GPa, and one unconventional superconductor of YBCO7. Our discovery indicates that DFT can be a practical tool for predicting superconductors, enabling a systematic search for new superconducting materials in the future.

Title: Dual topological insulator with mirror symmetry protected helical edge states
Authors: Warlley H. Campos, Poliana H. Penteado, Julian Zanon, Paulo E. Faria Junior, Denis R. Candido, J. Carlos Egues
Abstract: Dual topological insulators (DTIs) are simultaneously protected by time-reversal and crystal symmetries, representing advantageous alternatives to conventional topological insulators. By combining ab initio calculations and the $\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{p}$ approach, here, we investigate the electronic band structure of a Na$_2$CdSn triatomic layer and derive a low-energy $4\times 4$ effective model consistent with all the symmetries of this material class. We obtain the effective Hamiltonian using the Löwdin perturbation theory, the folding-down technique, and the theory of invariants and determine its parameters by fitting our analytical dispersion relations to those of ab initio calculations. We then calculate the bulk topological invariants of the system and show that the Na$_2$CdSn triatomic layer is a giant-gap (hundreds of millielectronvolts) quasi-two-dimensional DTI characterized by both spin and mirror Chern numbers $-2$. In agreement with the bulk-boundary correspondence theorem, we find that a finite-width strip of Na$_2$CdSn possesses two pairs of counterpropagating helical edge states per interface. We obtain analytical expressions for the edge state energy dispersions and wave functions, which are shown to agree with our numerical calculations. Our work opens an avenue for further studies of Na$_2$CdSn as a potential DTI candidate with room-temperature applications in areas of technological interest, such as nanoelectronics and spintronics.

The experimental data are described in terms of the Anderson-Brinkman-Morel model of p-wave electron pairing.

Title: Parafermions in Moiré Minibands
Authors: Hui Liu, Raul Perea-Causin, Emil J. Bergholtz
Abstract: Moiré materials provide a remarkably tunable platform for topological and strongly correlated quantum phases of matter. Very recently, the first zero field Abelian fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) have been experimentally demonstrated and it has been theoretically predicted that non-Abelian states with Majorana fermion excitations may be realized in the nearly dispersionless minibands of these systems. Here we provide telltale evidence in terms of low-energy quantum numbers, spectral flow and entanglement spectra for the even more exotic possibility of moiré-based non-Abelian FCIs exhibiting Fibonacci parafermion excitations.

Title: Inferring traits of hyperuniformity from local structures via persistent homology
Authors: Abel H. G. Milor, Marco Salvalaglio
Abstract: Hyperuniformity refers to the suppression of density fluctuations at large scales. Typical for ordered systems, this property also emerges in several disordered physical and biological systems, where it is particularly relevant to understand mechanisms of pattern formation and to exploit peculiar attributes, e.g., interaction with light and transport phenomena. While hyperuniformity is a global property, ideally defined for infinitely extended systems, several disordered correlated systems have finite size. It has been shown in [Phys. Rev. Research 6, 023107 (2024)] that global hyperuniform characteristics systematically correlate with distributions of topological properties representative of local arrangements. In this work, building on this information, we explore and assess the inverse relationship between hyperuniformity and local structures in point patterns as described by persistent homology. Standard machine learning algorithms trained on persistence diagrams are shown to detect hyperuniformity of periodic point patterns with high accuracy. Therefore, we demonstrate that the information on patterns' local structures allows for characterizing whether finite size arrangements are analogous to those realized in hyperuniform patterns. Then, addressing more quantitative aspects, we show that parameters defining hyperuniformity globally can be reconstructed by comparing persistence diagrams of targeted patterns with reference ones. We also explore the generation of patterns entailing given topological properties. The results of this study pave the way for advanced analysis of hyperuniform patterns including local information, and introduce basic concepts for their inverse design.

Title: CNN-Based Vortex Detection in Atomic 2D Bose Gases in the Presence of a Phononic Background
Authors: Magnus Sesodia, Shinichi Sunami, En Chang, Erik Rydow, Christopher J. Foot, Abel Beregi
Abstract: Quantum vortices play a crucial role in both equilibrium and dynamical phenomena in two-dimensional (2D) superfluid systems. Experimental detection of these excitations in 2D ultracold atomic gases typically involves examining density depletions in absorption images, however the presence of a significant phononic background renders the problem challenging, beyond the capability of simple algorithms or the human eye. Here, we utilize a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect vortices in the presence of strong long- and intermediate-length scale density modulations in finite-temperature 2D Bose gases. We train the model on datasets obtained from ab initio Monte Carlo simulations using the classical-field method for density and phase fluctuations, and Gross-Pitaevskii simulation of realistic expansion dynamics. We use the model to analyze experimental images and benchmark its performance by comparing the results to the matter-wave interferometric detection of vortices, confirming the observed scaling of vortex density across the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) critical point. The combination of a relevant simulation pipeline with machine-learning methods is a key development towards the comprehensive understanding of complex vortex-phonon dynamics in out-of-equilibrium 2D quantum systems.

Title: Majorana-metal transition in a disordered superconductor: percolation in a landscape of topological domain walls
Authors: V. A. Zakharov, I. C. Fulga, G. Lemut, J. Tworzydlo, C. W. J. Beenakker
Abstract: Most superconductors are thermal insulators. A disordered chiral $\textit{p}$-wave superconductor, however, can make a transition to a thermal metal phase. Because heat is then transported by Majorana fermions, this phase is referred to as a Majorana metal. Here we present numerical evidence that the mechanism for the phase transition with increasing electrostatic disorder is the percolation of boundaries separating domains of different Chern number. We construct the network of domain walls using the spectral localizer as a ``topological landscape function'', and obtain the thermal metal--insulator phase diagram from the percolation transition.

Authors: Tanaporn Na Narong, Zoe N. Zachko, Steven B. Torrisi, Simon J. L. Billinge
Abstract: We used interpretable machine learning to combine information from multiple heterogeneous spectra: X-ray absorption near-edge spectra (XANES) and atomic pair distribution functions (PDFs) to extract local structural and chemical environments of transition metal cations in oxides. Random forest models were trained on simulated XANES, PDF, and both combined to extract oxidation state, coordination number, and mean nearest-neighbor bond length. XANES-only models generally outperformed PDF-only models, even for structural tasks, although using the metal's differential PDFs (dPDFs) instead of total PDFs narrowed this gap. When combined with PDFs, information from XANES often dominates the prediction. Our results demonstrate that XANES contain rich structural information and highlight the utility of species-specificity. This interpretable, multimodal approach is quick to implement with suitable databases and offers valuable insights into the relative strengths of different modalities, guiding researchers in experiment design and identifying when combining complementary techniques adds meaningful information to a scientific investigation.

Title: Anomalous shot noise in a bad metal beta-tantalum
Authors: M. Szurek, H. Cheng, Z. Pang, Y. Zhang, J. Bacsa, S. Urazhdin
Abstract: We investigate the electronic shot noise produced by nanowires of $\beta$-Ta, an archetypal ``bad" metal with resistivity near the Ioffe-Regel localization limit. The Fano factor characterizing the shot noise exhibits a strong dependence on temperature and is suppressed compared to the expectations for quasiparticle diffusion, but hopping transport is ruled out by the analysis of scaling with the nanowire length. These anomalous behaviors closely resemble those of strange metal nanowires, suggesting that $\beta$-Ta may host a correlated electron liquid. This material provides an accessible platform for exploring exotic electronic states of matter.

Title: Magnetic response of topological insulator layer with metamaterial substrate induced by an electric point source
Authors: Qiang Sun, Eitan Dvorquez, Felipe Pinto, Mohan C. Mathpal, Jerónimo R. Maze, Brant C. Gibson, Andrew D. Greentree
Abstract: Topological insulators (TIs) are materials with unique surface conductive properties that distinguish them from normal insulators and have attracted significant interest due to their potential applications in electronics and spintronics. However, their weak magnetic field response in traditional setups has limited their practical applications. Here, we show that integrating TIs with active metamaterial substrates can significantly enhance the induced magnetic field by more than $10^4$ times. Our results demonstrate that selecting specific permittivity and permeability values for the active metamaterial substrate optimizes the magnetic field at the interface between the TI layer and the metamaterial, extending it into free space. This represents a substantial improvement over previous methods, where the magnetic field decayed rapidly. The findings reveal that the TI-metamaterial approach enhances the magnetic field response, unveiling new aspects of TI electromagnetic behavior and suggesting novel pathways for developing materials with tailored electromagnetic properties. The integration of metamaterials with TIs offers promising opportunities for advancements in materials science and various technological applications. Overall, our study provides a practical and effective approach to exploring the unique magnetic field responses of TIs, potentially benefiting other complex material systems.

Title: Fundamentals and applications of Van der Waals magnets in magnon spintronics
Authors: Samuel Mañas-Valero, Toeno van der Sar, Rembert A. Duine, Bart van Wees
Abstract: Spintronics is concerned with replacing charge current with current of spin, the electron's intrinsic angular momentum. In magnetic insulators, spin currents are carried by magnons, the quanta of spin-wave excitations on top of the magnetically ordered state. Magnon spin currents are especially promising for information technology due to their low intrinsic damping, non-reciprocal transport, micrometer wavelengths at microwave frequencies, and strong interactions that enable signal transduction. In this perspective, we give our view on the progress and challenges towards realizing magnon spintronics based on atomically thin Van der Waals magnets, a recently discovered class of magnetic materials of which the tunability and versatility has attracted a great deal of ongoing research.

Title: Magneto-optical evidence of tilting effect in coupled Weyl bands
Authors: Seongphill Moon, Yuxuan Jiang, Jennifer Neu, Theo Siegrist, Mykhaylo Ozerov, Zhigang Jiang, Dmitry Smirnov
Abstract: Theories have revealed the universality of the band tilting effect in topological Weyl semimetals (WSMs) and its implications for the material's physical properties. However, the experimental identification of tilted Weyl bands remains much less explored. Here, by combining magneto-infrared optical studies with a four-band coupled Weyl point model, we report spectroscopic evidence of the tilting effect in the well-established WSM niobium phosphide. Specifically, we observe Landau level transitions with rich features that are well reproduced within a model of coupled tilted Weyl points. Our analysis indicates that the tilting effect relaxes the selection rules and gives rise to transitions that would otherwise be forbidden in the non-tilt case. Additionally, we observe unconventional interband transitions with flat and negative magnetic field dispersions, highlighting the importance of coupling between Weyl points. Our results not only emphasize the significance of the tilting effect in the optical responses of WSMs but also demonstrate magneto-optics as an effective tool for probing the tilting effect in electronic band structures.

Title: Magnetorotons in Moiré Fractional Chern Insulators
Authors: Xiaoyang Shen, Chonghao Wang, Xiaodong Hu, Ruiping Guo, Hong Yao, Chong Wang, Wenhui Duan, Yong Xu
Abstract: The discovery of fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) unlocks exciting opportunities to explore emergent physical excitations arising from topological and geometric effects in novel phases of quantum matter. Here we investigate the intraband neutral excitations, namely magnetorotons, in moiré FCIs within twisted $\rm{MoTe}_2$ by applying the Girvin, MacDonald, and Platzman (GMP) ansatz together with the method of dynamical geometric response. We reveal the universal existence of the finite-momentum magnetorotons in moiré FCIs and predict their characteristic scales. Furthermore, we explore the geometric nature of magnetorotons in the long-wavelength limit, identifying their gapped chiral nature with angular momentum-2, which originates from the momentum-space incompressibility of FCIs. Utilizing the excellent tunability of moiré systems, we extend our analysis to other incompressible phases and uncover the dynamical properties of geometric excitations influenced by quantum phase transitions. Finally, we provide experimental proposals for detecting and advancing the study of intraband neutral excitations in moiré FCIs.

Title: Infinite variety of thermodynamic speed limits with general activities
Authors: Ryuna Nagayama, Kohei Yoshimura, Sosuke Ito
Abstract: Activity, which represents the kinetic property of dynamics, plays a central role in obtaining thermodynamic speed limits (TSLs). In this paper, we discuss a unified framework that provides the existing TSLs based on different activities such as dynamical activity and dynamical state mobility. This unification is based on generalized means that include standard means such as the arithmetic, logarithmic, and geometric means, the first two of which respectively correspond to the dynamical activity and the dynamical state mobility. We also derive an infinite variety of TSLs for Markov jump processes and deterministic chemical reaction networks using different activities. The lower bound on the entropy production given by each TSL provides the minimum dissipation achievable by a conservative force. We numerically and analytically discuss the tightness of the lower bounds on the EPR in the various TSLs.

Title: Revisiting Impurity Induced In-gap Bound States In Unconventional Superconductors
Authors: Junkang Huang, Z. D. Wang, Tao Zhou
Abstract: This study revisits the effects of single impurity scattering in unconventional superconductors, with a specific emphasis on intralayer $d$-wave pairing and interlayer $s$-wave pairing. We reveal that in the context of a square lattice near half-filling doping, there exists an intrinsic connection between the $d$-wave pairing symmetry and the appearance of mid-gap states. This relationship is determined by the $C_4$ rotational symmetry of both the $d$-wave gap amplitude and the square lattice itself. Furthermore, we identify an intrinsic link between the in-gap states and the sign change of the order parameter. In systems with interlayer pairing, strong resonant peaks are observed, despite the absence of sign-reversal characteristics in the pairing order parameter. By utilizing the $T$-matrix approach, we elucidate the mechanisms underlying these impurity-induced states. Our theoretical framework is pertinent to the analysis of newly discovered nickel-based high-temperature superconductors, providing a powerful tool for distinguishing their pairing properties. The results of this study shed light on the complex interplay between pairing symmetries and impurity effects in unconventional superconductors, paving the way for future investigations into the unique properties of these emerging materials.

Title: Non-Abelian interlayer coherent fractional quantum Hall states
Authors: Xiang-Jian Hou, Lei Wang, Ying-Hai Wu
Abstract: We study non-Abelian fractional quantum Hall state in double layer systems at total filling factor $1/2$. Recent progresses in two-dimensional van der Waals materials made it possible to explore the regime with very small interlayer distance. Numerical calculations suggests interlayer phase coherence can develop between the layers such that the electrons may redistribute between them without changing the Hall response. It corresponds to spontaneous breaking of the U(1) symmetry associated with the particle number difference in the layers. This state manifests itself as superfluid in counterflow measurement and has characteristic Hall response when current is passed through one layer and voltages in both layers are measured. As the interlayer distance increases, a phase transition to the Halperin 331 state occurs. We also discuss similar physics for bosonic systems with specially designed interactions.

Title: Quantum effects in surface diffusion: application to diffusion of nitrogen adatoms over GaN(0001) surface
Authors: Paweł Strak, Cyprian Sobczak, Stanislaw Krukowski
Abstract: It is shown that quantum effects play determining role in nitrogen adatom diffusion due to several different factors. This could be related to the change of the energy of the quantum states and also due to the redistribution of electrons between the quantum states, both full and resonant, via quantum statistics partially governed by the Fermi energy level. These effects were studied in the case of nitrogen diffusion over clean and gallium covered Ga-terminated GaN(0001) surface. For the fractional coverage the density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that at the saddle point configuration the redistribution of electrons between different quantum states may affect the surface diffusion barrier significantly. The other quantum influence occurs via the change of the minimal energy configuration. Under fractional Ga coverage of GaN(0001) surface the nitrogen diffusion energy barrier proceeds from the resonant states governed energy minimal H3 site across the saddle point in the bridge configuration. At this path the barrier is affected the electron redistribution between surface quantum states both in the initial and the saddle point. In the case of the full GaN coverage the diffusion path is from on-top N adatom configuration via H3 site that corresponds to maximal energy. Therefore the diffusion barrier is Ebar= 1.18 eV for clean and Ebar= 0.92 eV for (1/6) ML to finally Ebar= 1.23 eV for full Ga coverage. Thus the overall barrier is reduced to Ebar= 0.92 eV due to quantum statistics effects. The identified stable N on-top configuration for the full coverage is essential for atomic mechanism of GaN growth in Ga-rich regime.

Title: Turbulence: A Nonequilibrium Field Theory
Authors: Mahendra Verma
Abstract: Tools of quantum and statistical field theories have been successfully ported to turbulence. Here, we review the key results of turbulence field theory. \textit{Equilibrium field theory} describes thermalized spectrally-truncated Euler equation, where the equipartitioned Fourier modes generate zero energy flux. In contrast, \textit{nonequilibrium field theory} is employed for modelling of hydrodynamic turbulence (HDT), which has small viscosity. In HDT, viscosity renormalization yields wavenumber-dependent viscosity and energy spectrum. Field theory calculations also yields nonzero energy flux for HDT. These field theory computations have been generalized to other systems, e.g., passive scalar and magnetohydrodynamics. In this review, I cover these aspects, along with a brief coverage of weak turbulence and intermittency.

Title: Monitored interacting Dirac fermions
Authors: Thomas Martin Müller, Michael Buchhold, Sebastian Diehl
Abstract: We analytically study interacting Dirac fermions, described by the Thirring model, under weak local particle number measurements with monitoring rate $\gamma$. This system maps to a bosonic replica field theory, analyzed via the renormalization group. For a nonzero attractive interaction, a phase transition occurs at a critical measurement strength $\gamma_c$. When $\gamma>\gamma_c$, the system enters a localized phase characterized by exponentially decaying density-density correlations beyond a finite correlation length; for $\gamma<\gamma_c$, the correlations decay algebraically. The transition is of BKT-type, reflected by a characteristic scaling of the correlation length. In the non-interacting limit, $\gamma_c\to0$ shifts to zero, reducing the algebraic phase to a single point in parameter space. This identifies weak measurements in the free case as an implicit double fine-tuning to the critical endpoint of the BKT phase transition. Along the non-interacting line, we compute the entanglement entropy from density-density correlation functions and find no entanglement transition at nonzero measurement strength in the thermodynamic limit.

Title: Elasto-Hall conductivity and the anomalous Hall effect in altermagnets
Authors: Keigo Takahashi, Charles R. W. Steward, Masao Ogata, Rafael M. Fernandes, Jörg Schmalian
Abstract: Altermagnets break time-reversal symmetry, preserve the crystal translation invariance, and have a spin density with $d$-wave, $g$-wave, etc. momentum dependencies which do not contribute to the magnetization. When an $s$-wave spin-density contribution cannot be excluded by symmetry a small magnetization and an anomalous Hall effect (AHE) emerge. However, for so-called "pure" altermagnets, where the $s$-wave component is symmetry forbidden even in the presence of SOC, both the zero-field magnetization and the AHE vanish. We show that altermagnets generally exhibit a non-zero elasto-Hall-conductivity, by which application of strain leads to a non-zero AHE. For pure altermagnets it is the only contribution to the AHE. This elasto-Hall-conductivity is caused by strain coupling to the Berry curvature quadrupole that characterizes altermagnets and allows for the determination of the altermagnetic order using transport measurements that are linear in the electrical field. We further show that the emergence of a non-zero magnetization in the presence of strain arises from a different response function: piezomagnetism. While this magnetization gives rise to an additional contribution to the elasto-Hall conductivity, the corresponding Berry curvature is qualitatively different from the distorted Berry curvature quadrupole originating from the altermagnetic order parameter. This insight also helps to disentangle AHE and weak ferromagnetism for systems with symmetry-allowed $s$-wave contribution. Quantitatively, the elasto-Hall conductivity is particularly pronounced for systems with a Dirac spectrum in the altermagnetic state. The same mechanism gives rise to anomalous elasto-thermal Hall, Nernst, and Ettinghausen effects.

Title: Dual view of the Z$_2$-Gauged XY Model in 3D
Authors: Piers Coleman, Anatoly Kuklov, Alexei Tsvelik
Abstract: The $Z_2$ gauged neutral XY model is of long-standing interest both in the context of nematic order, and the study of fractionalization and superconductivity. This paper presents heuristic arguments that no deconfinement of the XY field occurs in this model and presents results of a large-scale Monte Carlo simulations on a cubic lattice which are consistent with this conclusion. The correlation radius determining the confinement is found to be growing rapidly as a function of the parameters in the phase featuring the nematic order. Thus, mesoscopic properties of the system can mimic deconfinement with high accuracy in some part of the phase diagram.

Title: Spin-chirality driven second-harmonic generation in two-dimensional magnet CrSBr
Authors: Dezhao Wu, Yong Xu, Meng Ye, Wenhui Duan
Abstract: The interplay between magnetism and light can create abundant optical phenomena. Here, we demonstrated the emergence of an unconventional magnetization-induced second-harmonic generation (MSHG) stemming from vector spin chirality, denoted as chiral SHG. Taking bilayer antiferromagnetic (AFM) CrSBr as a prototype, we theoretically showed that, via spin canting, the chiral SHG can be continuously tuned from zero to a value one order of magnitude larger than its intrinsic MSHG. Remarkbly, chiral SHG was found to be proportional to the spin chirality and spin canting-induced electric polarization, while the intrinsic MSHG was proportional to the Néel vector, demonstrating their different physical mechanisms. Additionally, we revealed a unique interference effect between these two types of MSHG under the reversal of spin canting direction, generating giant modulation of SHG signals. Our work not only uncovers a novel SHG with superb tunability but also advances the applications of AFM optical devices and magnetoelectric detection.

Title: Nonadiabatic quantum geometry and optical conductivity
Authors: Raffaele Resta
Abstract: The ground-state quantum geometry is at the root of several static and adiabatic properties, while genuinely dynamic properties are routinely addressed via Kubo formulae, whose essential entries are the excited states. It is shown here that the ground-state metric-curvature tensor evolves in time by means of a causal unitary operator, which by construction elucidates the geometrical effect of the excited states in compact form. In the condensed-matter case the generalized tensor encompasses the whole conductivity tensor at arbitrary frequencies in both insulators and metals, with the exception of the Drude term in the metallic case; the latter is shown to be eminently nongeometrical.

Title: Optimal Local Measurements in Single-Parameter Quantum Metrology
Authors: Jia-Xuan Liu, Jing Yang, Hai-Long Shi, Sixia Yu
Abstract: Quantum measurement plays a crucial role in quantum metrology. Due to the limitations of experimental capabilities, collectively measuring multiple copies of probing systems can present significant challenges. Therefore, the concept of locality in quantum measurements must be considered. In this work, we investigate the possibility of achieving the Quantum Cramér-Rao Bound (QCRB) through local measurements (LM). We first demonstrate that if there exists a LM to saturate the QCRB for qubit systems, then we can construct another rank-1 local projective measurement to saturate the QCRB. In this sense, rank-1 local projective measurements are sufficient to analyze the problem of saturating the QCRB. For pure qubits, we propose two necessary and sufficient methods to determine whether and how a given parameter estimation model can achieve QCRB through LM. The first method, dubbed iterative matrix partition method (IMP) and based on unitary transformations that render the diagonal entries of a tracless matrix vanish, elucidates the underlying mathematical structure of LM as well as the local measurements with classical communications (LMCC), generalizing the result by [Zhou et al Quantum Sci. Technol. 5, 025005 (2020)], which only holds for the later case. We clarify that the saturation of QCRB through LM for the GHZ-encoded states is actually due to the self-similar structure in this approach. The second method, dubbed hierarchy of orthogonality conditions (HOC) and based on the parametrization of rank-1 measurements for qubit systems, allows us to construct several examples of saturating QCRB, including the three-qubit W states and $N$-qubit W states ($N \geq 3$). Our findings offer insights into achieving optimal performance in quantum metrology when measurement resources are limited.

Title: Clustering theorem in 1D long-range interacting systems at arbitrary temperatures
Authors: Yusuke Kimura, Tomotaka Kuwahara
Abstract: This paper delves into a fundamental aspect of quantum statistical mechanics -- the absence of thermal phase transitions in one-dimensional (1D) systems. Originating from Ising's analysis of the 1D spin chain, this concept has been pivotal in understanding 1D quantum phases, especially those with finite-range interactions as extended by Araki. In this work, we focus on quantum long-range interactions and successfully derive a clustering theorem applicable to a wide range of interaction decays at arbitrary temperatures. This theorem applies to any interaction forms that decay faster than $r^{-2}$ and does not rely on translation invariance or infinite system size assumptions. Also, we rigorously established that the temperature dependence of the correlation length is given by $e^{{\rm const.} \beta}$, which is the same as the classical cases. Our findings indicate the absence of phase transitions in 1D systems with super-polynomially decaying interactions, thereby expanding upon previous theoretical research. To overcome significant technical challenges originating from the divergence of the imaginary-time Lieb-Robinson bound, we utilize the quantum belief propagation to refine the cluster expansion method. This approach allowed us to address divergence issues effectively and contributed to a deeper understanding of low-temperature behaviors in 1D quantum systems.

Title: Primordial Black Holes from Effective Field Theory of Stochastic Single Field Inflation at NNNLO
Authors: Sayantan Choudhury, Ahaskar Karde, Pankaj Padiyar, M. Sami
Abstract: We present a study of the Effective Field Theory (EFT) generalization of stochastic inflation in a model-independent single-field framework and its impact on primordial black hole (PBH) formation. We show how the Langevin equations for the "soft" modes in quasi de Sitter background is described by the Infra-Red (IR) contributions of scalar perturbations, and the subsequent Fokker-Planck equation driving the probability distribution for the stochastic duration ${\cal N}$, significantly modify in the present EFT picture. An explicit perturbative analysis of the distribution function by implementing the stochastic-$\delta N$ formalism is performed up to the next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (NNNLO) for both the classical-drift and quantum-diffusion dominated regimes. In the drift-dominated limit, we perturbatively analyse the local non-Gaussianity parameters $(f_{\rm NL}, g_{\rm NL}, \tau_{\rm NL})$ with the EFT-induced modifications. In the diffusion-dominated limit, we numerically compute the probability distribution featuring exponential tails at each order of perturbative treatment.

Title: Mobility and Threshold Voltage Extraction in Transistors with Gate-Voltage-Dependent Contact Resistance
Authors: Robert K. A. Bennett, Lauren Hoang, Connor Cremers, Andrew J. Mannix, Eric Pop
Abstract: The mobility of emerging (e.g., two-dimensional, oxide, organic) semiconductors is commonly estimated from transistor current-voltage measurements. However, such devices often experience contact gating, i.e., electric fields from the gate modulate the contact resistance during measurements, which can lead conventional extraction techniques to estimate mobility incorrectly even by a factor >2. This error can be minimized by measuring transistors at high gate-source bias, |$V_\mathrm{gs}$|, but this regime is often inaccessible in emerging devices that suffer from high contact resistance or early gate dielectric breakdown. Here, we propose a method of extracting mobility in transistors with gate-dependent contact resistance that does not require operation at high |$V_\mathrm{gs}$|, enabling accurate mobility extraction even in emerging transistors with strong contact gating. Our approach relies on updating the transfer length method (TLM) and can achieve <10% error even in regimes where conventional techniques overestimate mobility by >2$\times$.

Title: Violation of the Leggett-Garg inequality for dynamics of a Bose-Einstein condensate in a double-well potential
Authors: Tsubasa Sakamoto, Ryosuke Yoshii, Shunji Tsuchiya
Abstract: The Leggett-Garg inequality (LGI) serves as a criterion to determine the adherence of macroscopic system dynamics to macrorealism, as introduced by Leggett and Garg. A violation of this inequality implies either the absence of a realistic description of the system or the impossibility of noninvasive measurement. In this Letter, we investigate the violation of the LGI for the system of bosons in a double-well potential. Specifically, we explore the violation of the LGI in the dynamics of bosons in a double-well potential in the Bose-Einstein-condensation (BEC) regime, where the system can be considered as two weakly coupled Bose condensates, and in the single-particle regime to establish the conditions under which the violation of the LGI occurs. Our analysis reveals that the LGI is violated due to Josephson oscillations, while it remains unviolated in the strong coupling regime, attributed to the self-trapping phenomena. Notably, we observe that the violation of the LGI becomes increasingly significant as the particle number increases. These findings provide valuable insights into the macrorealistic behavior of Bose condensates and highlight the effect of measurements on the dynamics of a macroscopic system.

Title: Perfect Wave Transfer in Continuous Quantum Systems
Authors: Per Moosavi, Matthias Christandl, Gian Michele Graf, Spyros Sotiriadis
Abstract: The transfer of information from one part of a quantum system to another is fundamental to the understanding and design of quantum information processing devices. In the realm of discrete systems, such as spin chains, inhomogeneous networks have been engineered that allow for the perfect transfer of qubits from one end to the other. Here, by contrast, we investigate perfect transfer of information in continuous systems, phrased in terms of wave propagation. A remarkable difference is found between systems that possess conformal invariance and those that do not. Systems in the first class enjoy perfect wave transfer (PWT), explicitly shown for one-particle excitations and expected in general. In the second class, those that exhibit PWT are characterized as solutions to an inverse spectral problem. As a concrete example, we demonstrate how to formulate and solve this problem for a prototypical class of bosonic theories, showing the importance of conformal invariance for these theories to enjoy PWT. Using bosonization, our continuum results extend to theories with interactions, broadening the scope of perfect information transfer to more general quantum systems.

Title: Gravitational Waves and Black Hole perturbations in Acoustic Analogues
Authors: Chiara Coviello, Maria Luisa Chiofalo, Dario Grasso, Stefano Liberati, Massimo Mannarelli, Silvia Trabucco
Abstract: Phonons in Bose-Einstein condensates propagate as massless scalar particles on top of an emergent acoustic metric. This hydrodynamics/gravity analogy can be exploited to realize acoustic black holes, featuring an event horizon that traps phonons. We show that by an appropriate external potential, gravitational wave-like perturbations of the acoustic metric can be produced. Such perturbations can be used to excite an acoustic black hole, which should then relax by phonon emission.

Title: A unified framework of unitarily residual measures for quantifying dissipation
Authors: Tomohiro Nishiyama, Yoshihiko Hasegawa
Abstract: Open quantum systems are governed by both unitary and non-unitary dynamics, with dissipation arising from the latter. Traditional quantum divergence measures, such as quantum relative entropy, fail to account for the non-unitary oriented dissipation as the divergence is positive even between unitarily connected states. We introduce a framework for quantifying the dissipation by isolating the non-unitary components of quantum dynamics. We define equivalence relations among hermitian operators through unitary transformations and characterize the resulting quotient set. By establishing an isomorphism between this quotient set and a set of real vectors with ordered components, we induce divergence measures that are invariant under unitary evolution, which we refer to as the unitarily residual measures. These unitarily residual measures inherit properties such as monotonicity and convexity and, in certain cases, correspond to classical information divergences between sorted eigenvalue distributions. Our results provide a powerful tool for quantifying dissipation in open quantum systems, advancing the understanding of quantum thermodynamics.

Title: Stability analysis through folds: An end-loaded elastic with a lever arm
Authors: Siva Prasad Chakri Dhanakoti
Abstract: Many physical systems can be modelled as parameter-dependent variational problems. The associated equilibria may or may not exist realistically and can only be determined after examining their stability. Hence, it is crucial to determine the stability and track their transitions. Generally, the stability characteristics of the equilibria change near folds in the parameter space. The direction of stability changes is embedded in a specific projection of the solutions, known as distinguished bifurcation diagrams. In this article, we identify such projections for variational problems characterized by fixed-free ends -- a class of problems frequently encountered in mechanics. Using these diagrams, we study an Elastica subject to an end load applied through a rigid lever arm. Several instances of snap-back instability are reported, along with their dependence on system parameters through numerical examples. These findings have potential applications in the design of soft robot arms and other actuator designs.

Title: Derivation and thermodynamically consistent coupling of a Debye-Hückel type energy to a steric electrolyte model and application to the apparent molar volume and phase boundaries
Authors: Wolfgang Dreyer, Rüdiger Müller
Abstract: We derive a Debye-Hückel-like model of the electric ion-ion interaction for non-constant dielectric susceptibility, which does not depend on any kind of charging process due to its foundation in the general framework of non-equilibrium electro-thermodynamics. The derivation, however, leads to a novel thermodynamic consistency condition for the temperature dependence of the susceptibility. Due to its contributions to the total pressure, the consistent coupling of this new contribution to the free energy requires subtle modifications in the derivation of the simple mixture model for electrolytes. The coupled model is then applied to the apparent molar volume for various related monovalent salts over a wider range of salt concentrations and temperatures, and classical tests of the electrolyte theory at phase boundaries are investigated.

Title: Adiabatic Gauge Potential as a Tool for Detecting Chaos in Classical Systems
Authors: Nachiket Karve, Nathan Rose, David Campbell
Abstract: The interplay between chaos and thermalization in weakly non-integrable systems is a rich and complex subject. Interest in this area is further motivated by a desire to develop a unified picture of chaos for both quantum and classical systems. In this work, we study the adiabatic gauge potential (AGP), an object typically studied in quantum mechanics that describes deformations of a quantum state under adiabatic variation of the Hamiltonian, in classical Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou (FPUT) and Toda models. We show how the time variance of the AGP over a trajectory probes the long-time correlations of a generic observable and can be used to distinguish among nearly integrable, weakly chaotic, and strongly chaotic regimes. We draw connections between the evolution of the AGP and diffusion and derive a fluctuation-dissipation relation that connects its variance to long-time correlations of the observable. Within this framework, we demonstrate that strongly and weakly chaotic regimes correspond to normal and anomalous diffusion, respectively. The latter gives rise to a marked increase in the variance as the time interval is increased, and this behavior serves as the basis for our probe of the onset times of chaos. Numerical results are presented for FPUT and Toda systems that highlight integrable, weakly chaotic, and strongly chaotic regimes. We conclude by commenting on the wide applicability of our method to a broader class of systems.
