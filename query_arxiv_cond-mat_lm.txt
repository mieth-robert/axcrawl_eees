Title: Unstable periodic orbits galore and quantum hyperscarring in highly frustrated magnets
Authors: Andrea Pizzi, Claudio Castelnovo, Johannes Knolle
Abstract: Highly frustrated magnets, with their macroscopically-degenerate classical ground states and massively-entangled quantum spin liquid phases, have been pivotal to the development of modern condensed matter concepts such as emergent symmetries, topological order, and fractionalisation. The effects of frustration and massive degeneracies at high energy, where the many-body dynamics becomes chaotic, have hitherto been far less explored. Here, we identify a high-energy dynamical analog of highly-frustrated magnetism, in the form of an extensive manifold of classical ''interaction-suppressing'' configurations giving rise to unstable periodic orbits. These are in general neither protected by symmetry nor integrability, and emerge from a set of dynamical local constraints that effectively nullify the interactions while allowing extensively many local degrees of freedom. The proliferation of unstable periodic orbits corresponds in the quantum case to ''hyperscarring'', that is, quantum scarring on exponentially many unstable periodic orbits. On the product states associated to the latter, the amplitudes of the mid-spectrum thermal eigenstates exhibit a power-law distribution, in stark contrast to the expected exponential Porter-Thomas distribution that holds for generic product states. Our results reveal a new constrained dynamical regime where many-body quantum chaos coexists with structured manifolds of coherent dynamics, and establishes a mechanism for hitherto elusive extensive scarring.

Title: Spin-resolved quasiparticle interference patterns on altermagnets via non-spin-resolved scanning tunneling microscopy
Authors: Eric Petermann, Kristian Mæland, Björn Trauzettel
Abstract: We investigate quasiparticle interference on an altermagnetic Lieb-like lattice and show how a non-spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy measurement can yield effectively spin-resolved information. Within a four-site tight-binding model, which can be tuned between an antiferromagnetic and a Lieb-type altermagnetic state, we introduce on-site impurities at distinct sublattice sites and compute the real space local density of states (LDOS) via a Green's function approach. A Fourier transformation of the impurity-induced LDOS yields the characteristic $d$-wave spin-split Fermi surface contours of the altermagnetic phase. Notably, by choosing which sublattice the impurity is placed upon, we show that the scattering amplitudes effectively encode spin-dependent contrasts: Impurities on one of the magnetic sublattices highlights predominantly spin-up contributions along one crystallographic direction, while impurities on the other one favor the complementary spin-down channel and orientation.

Title: Quantum-impurity sensing of altermagnetic order
Authors: V.A.S.V. Bittencourt, H. Hosseinabadi, J. Sinova, L. Šmejkal, J. Marino
Abstract: Quantum sensing with individual spin defects has emerged as a versatile platform to probe microscopic properties of condensed matter systems. Here we demonstrate that quantum relaxometry with nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond can reveal the anisotropic spin dynamics of altermagnetic insulators together with their characteristic spin polarised bands. We show that the distance and orientation dependent relaxation rate of a nearby quantum impurity encodes signatures of momentum space anisotropy in the spin diffusion response, a hallmark of altermagnetic order. This directional sensitivity is unprecedented in the landscape of quantum materials sensing, and it enables the distinction of altermagnets from conventional antiferromagnets via local, noninvasive measurements. Our results could spark new NV-sensing experiments on spin transport and symmetry breaking in altermagnets, and highlight the role of NV orientation to probe anisotropic phenomena in condensed matter systems.

Title: peaks: a Python package for analysis of angle-resolved photoemission and related spectroscopies
Authors: Phil D. C. King, Brendan Edwards, Shu Mo, Tommaso Antonelli, Edgar Abarca Morales, Lewis Hart, Liam Trzaska
Abstract: The electronic band structure, describing the motion and interactions of electrons in materials, dictates the electrical, optical, and thermodynamic properties of solids. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) provides a direct experimental probe of such electronic band structures, and so is widely employed in the study of functional, quantum, and 2D materials. \texttt{peaks} (\textbf{P}ython \textbf{E}lectron spectroscopy \textbf{A}nalysis by \textbf{K}ing group @ \textbf{S}t Andrews) provides a Python package for advanced data analysis of ARPES and related spectroscopic data. It facilitates the fast visualisation and analysis of multi-dimensional datasets, allows for the complex data hierarchy typical to ARPES experiments, and supports lazy data loading and parallel processing, reflecting the ever-increasing data volumes used in ARPES. It is designed to be run in an interactive notebook environment, with extensive inline and pop-out GUI support for data visualisation.

Title: Engineering Phonons in Compositionally Complex Carbide Ceramics
Authors: Linu Malakkal, Jarin C French, Lanh Trinh, Kaustubh K Bawane, Shuxiang Zhou, Zilong Hua, Lingfeng He, Yongfeng Lu, Bai Cui
Abstract: In the pursuit of advanced ceramic materials with exceptional irradiation-resistance and high-temperature tolerance for nuclear applications, compositionally complex carbides (CCCs) have emerged as a highly promising class of candidate materials for extreme environments. In such conditions, critical material properties such as thermal stability, elasticity, thermal conductivity and thermodynamics behavior are predominantly influenced by phonons. In CCCs, pronounced cation disorder can lead to significant phonon scattering due to inherent mass and force constant variations, impacting these critical properties. In this study, we used ab initio calculations to predict the phonon band structures and systematically explore the influence of mass and force constant variance on the phonon spectral function of CCCs with a rock salt structure, ranging from binary to five-metal component carbides. Our findings reveal that the selection and concentration of constituent elements can be strategically utilized to tune the phonon band structure, phonon bandgap and phonon scattering in CCCs, thereby enabling control over phonon-related properties. Additionally, we measured the thermal conductivity of some of these CCCs using the spatial-domain thermoreflectance technique. Interestingly, the measured thermal conductivity of some of these CCCs indicates that five-component ceramics exhibit higher thermal conductivity than certain ternary and binary alloys. This observation contrasts with the expectation that greater cation disorder would result in more scattering and lower thermal conductivity. This intriguing result opens up the possibility of discovering CCCs with better thermal conductivity, presenting new opportunities for their application in extreme environments.

Title: A Comprehensive Study on A$_2$PdH$_2$: From Ambient to High Pressure
Authors: Zahra Alizadeh, Yue-Wen Fang, Ion Errea, M.R. Mohammadizadeh
Abstract: We present a comprehensive first--principles study of the structural stability and superconducting behavior of Li$_2$PdH$_2$ under high pressure. Using random structure searching and phonon calculations, we identify a pressure--induced phase transition from a tetragonal I4/mmm structure, stable up to 5 GPa, to a monoclinic C2/m phase that remains thermodynamically stable up to 50 GPa. Superconductivity is absent in the tetragonal phase, even when anharmonic effects are considered, due to weak electron--phonon coupling and limited hydrogen involvement near the Fermi level. In contrast, the monoclinic phase exhibits a weak but pressure-enhanced superconducting transition, with Tc increasing from 0.6 K at 10 GPa to 4.7 K at 50 GPa, mainly driven by low--frequency Li and Pd-derived phonon modes. We further explore the isostructural A$_2$PdH$_2$ (A = Na, K, Rb, Cs) series to evaluate the impact of alkali-metal substitution on stability and superconductivity. Na, K, and Rb analogs retain dynamic stability at ambient pressure, with weak superconducting critical temperatures of 3.2 K, 2.1 K, and negligible Tc, respectively. Cs$_2$PdH$_2$, however, exhibits phonon instabilities, suggesting a need for external stabilization. These findings highlight the delicate balance between lattice dynamics, electronic structure, and atomic mass in tuning superconductivity in palladium-based hydrides.

Title: Inverse Lieb Materials: Altermagnetism and More
Authors: Po-Hao Chang, Igor I. Mazin, Kirill D. Belashchenko
Abstract: The Lieb lattice, originally proposed for cuprate superconductors, has gained new attention in the emerging field of altermagnetism as a minimal analytical model for the latter. While initially the so-called inverse Lieb lattice (ILL) was deemed only a theoretical model, recently several real materials with this crystallographic motif have been found. The unique geometry of ILL can accommodate complex magnetic orderings arising from competing exchange interactions and geometric frustration, offering great tunability for magnetic properties. In this work, we provide comprehensive insights into magnetic phases in ILL materials and establish guidelines for efficient identification of altermagnetic materials within this family. We begin by constructing phase diagrams using a simple Heisenberg model to elucidate the fundamental mechanisms underlying altermagnetism and other complex magnetic phases observed experimentally. To bridge theory with experiment, we systematically investigate a series of existing ILL compounds using density functional theory (DFT) calculations to determine their magnetic ground states. Our computational results are in good agreement with experimental observations. Importantly, we identify a trend linking magnetic ordering to the $d$-shell filling of transition metal ions, with $d^{2-3}$ and $d^{5}$ configurations showing propensity for altermagnetic behavior. Additionally, we identify a promising metallic compound Sr$_{2}$CrO$_{2}$Cr$_{2}$OAs$_{2}$ as an altermagnet that is highly anisotropic in its $J_2$ exchange couplings with large Néel temperature ($\sim 600$ K). Using exchange coupling parameters extracted from DFT calculations, we compute the magnon spectra for altermagnetic systems. As expected, chiral splittings in the magnon dispersion are directly correlated with anisotropy between crystallographically inequivalent $J_{2}$ exchange interactions.

Title: Data Driven Insights into Composition Property Relationships in FCC High Entropy Alloys
Authors: Nicolas Flores, Daniel Salas Mula, Wenle Xu, Sahu Bibhu, Daniel Lewis, Alexandra Eve Salinas, Samantha Mitra, Raj Mahat, Surya R. Kalidindi, Justin Wilkerson, James Paramore, Ankit Srivastiva, George Pharr, Douglas Allaire, Ibrahim Karaman, Brady Butler, Vahid Attari, Raymundo Arroyave
Abstract: Structural High Entropy Alloys (HEAs) are crucial in advancing technology across various sectors, including aerospace, automotive, and defense industries. However, the scarcity of integrated chemistry, process, structure, and property data presents significant challenges for predictive property modeling. Given the vast design space of these alloys, uncovering the underlying patterns is essential yet difficult, requiring advanced methods capable of learning from limited and heterogeneous datasets. This work presents several sensitivity analyses, highlighting key elemental contributions to mechanical behavior, including insights into the compositional factors associated with brittle and fractured responses observed during nanoindentation testing in the BIRDSHOT center NiCoFeCrVMnCuAl system dataset. Several encoder decoder based chemistry property models, carefully tuned through Bayesian multi objective hyperparameter optimization, are evaluated for mapping alloy composition to six mechanical properties. The models achieve competitive or superior performance to conventional regressors across all properties, particularly for yield strength and the UTS/YS ratio, demonstrating their effectiveness in capturing complex composition property relationships.

Title: Push and Pull: Elastic Interaction Between Pressurized Spherical Cavities in Nonlinear Elastic Media
Authors: Ali Saeedi, Mrityunjay Kothari
Abstract: Elastic interaction of pressurized spherical cavities embedded in a three-dimensional hyperelastic medium is computationally analyzed. Using finite element analysis across several positive and negative pressure scenarios, we calculate the system's potential energy and configurational driving force for neo-Hookean, Mooney-Rivlin, and Arruda-Boyce material models. Our results show that while the interaction is always attractive for negative pressures, a non-monotonic energy landscape emerges for positive pressures above a critical value. In this regime, cavities attract at close range and repel when further apart. The critical separation distance for this transition is shown to be dependent on the material's strain-stiffening parameters. These findings are consolidated into phase diagrams, providing a clear map of interaction behaviors.

Title: Optimization of Ab-Initio Based Tight-Binding Models
Authors: Henrik Dick, Thomas Dahm
Abstract: The electronic structure of solids can routinely be calculated by standard methods like density functional theory. However, in complicated situations like interfaces, grain boundaries or contact geometries one needs to resort to more simplified models of the electronic structure. Tight-binding models are using a reduced set of orbitals and aim to approximate the electronic structure by short range hopping processes. For example, maximally localized Wannier functions are often used for that purpose. However, their accuracy is limited by the need to disentangle the electronic bands. Here, we develop and investigate a different procedure to obtain tight-binding models inspired by machine-learning techniques. The model parameters are optimized in such a way as to reproduce ab-initio band structure data as accurately as possible using an as small as possible number of model parameters. The procedure is shown to result in models with smaller ranges and fewer orbitals than maximally localized Wannier functions but same or even better accuracy. We argue that such a procedure is more useful for automated construction of tight-binding models particularly for large-scale materials calculations.

Title: Casimir Interaction between Polydisperse Colloids Trapped at a Fluid Interface
Authors: Seyed Emad Mousavi, Ehsan Noruzifar
Abstract: We investigate the effect of polydispersity on fluctuation-induced interactions between Janus colloidal particles trapped at a fluid interface. Using the scattering-matrix formalism, we calculate the thermal Casimir energy in both two- and three-body systems, considering three distinct fluctuation scenarios for the colloids: (a) fixed, (b) bobbing, and (c) bobbing and tilting. Our results reveal a pronounced sensitivity to polydispersity that strongly depends on the fluctuating boundary conditions: while fixed colloids show modest deviations, bobbing and especially bobbing+tilting configurations exhibit orders-of-magnitude amplification in the energy deviation due to polydispersity. These effects are further enhanced at large separations. Our findings highlights the interplay between geometry, colloids fluctuations, and fluctuation-induced forces, with implications for colloidal self-assembly and interface engineering.

Title: Robust surface superconductivity and vortex lattice in the Weyl semimetal $γ$-PtBi$_2$
Authors: Jose Antonio Moreno, Pablo García Talavera, Edwin Herrera, Sara López Valle, Zhuoqi Li, Lin-Lin Wang, Sergey Bud'ko, Alexander I. Buzdin, Isabel Guillamón, Paul C. Canfield, Hermann Suderow
Abstract: The layered compound $\gamma$-PtBi$_2$ is a topological semimetal with Fermi arcs at the surface joining bulk Weyl points. Recent work has found a peculiar surface superconducting state with a critical temperature two orders of magnitude larger than the bulk value. However, no superconducting vortices have been identified, raising questions about the robustness of the phase coherence in this new surface superconducting state. Here we measure the superconducting gap and visualize the vortex lattice through very low temperature Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM). We find vortices that are anomalously mobile and show that the extremely weak electrostatic interaction between the vortex charge and the STM tip is sufficient to drag the vortices of the surface superconductor. Our results show that surface superconductivity with $T_c=2.9$ K and $H_{c2}\approx 1.8$ T is extraordinarily robust in $\gamma$-PtBi$_2$. Furthermore, quasiparticle scattering is enhanced at the position in the reciprocal space of the Fermi arcs, suggesting a connection between Weyl points and surface superconductivity.

Title: SERS Raman detection of the CO$_2$ Moisture Swing
Authors: Javier Mendez-Lozoya, Estrella Solis Mata, J. Jesus Velazquez Salazar, Alondra Hernandez Cedillo, Miguel Jose Yacaman, Jennifer L. Wade
Abstract: The development of scalable, energy-efficient carbon dioxide capture technologies is critical for achieving net-zero emissions. Moisture swing sorbents offer a promising alternative to traditional thermal regeneration methods by enabling reversible CO$_2$ binding through humidity-driven ion hydrolysis. In this study, we investigate the anion speciation dynamics in two classes of MS materials, an anion-exchange resin with bicarbonate anion and activated carbon impregnated with potassium bicarbonate salt using both sorption measurements and in situ surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy. Ni coated Ag nanowires were employed as SERS substrates to enhance signal intensity and enable the real-time detection of carbonate , bicarbonate , and hydroxide species under controlled humidity conditions in both air and nitrogen atmospheres. The results reveal humidity-dependent interconversion between anionic species, with significant spectral shifts confirming the reversible hydrolysis reactions that drive the MS mechanism. Under humid conditions, we observed the depletion of bicarbonate signals and a concurrent increase in carbonate species, consistent with moisture-induced desorption of CO$_2$. These findings not only validate the mechanistic models of humidity-driven anion exchange in moisture swing sorbents but also demonstrate the practical potential of SERS as an operando diagnostic tool for monitoring CO$_2$ capture media. The ability to resolve and quantify the reversible transformation of carbonate, bicarbonate, and hydroxide ions under realistic environmental conditions provides valuable insight for the rational design, performance optimization, and quality control of next-generation sorbent materials for direct air capture applications.

Title: Intrinsic Layer-Dependent Surface Energy and Exfoliation Energy of van der Waals Materials
Authors: Lin-Lin Wang, Jiaqiang Yan, Yong Han, Claire C. Wang, Jian-Xiang Qiu, Su-Yang Xu, Adam Kaminski, Michael C. Tringides, Paul C. Canfield
Abstract: Stacking and twisting 2D van der Waals (vdW) layers have become versatile platforms to tune electron correlation. These platforms rely on exfoliating vdW materials down to a single and few vdW layers. We calculate the intrinsic layer-dependent surface and exfoliation energies of typical vdW materials such as, graphite, h-BN, black P, MX$_2$ (M=Mo and W, X=S, Se and Te), MX (M=Ga and In, X=S, Se and Te), Bi$_2$Te$_3$ and MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ using density functional theory. For exchange-correlation functionals with explicit vdW interaction, a single vdW layer always has the smallest surface energy, giving a surface energy reduction when compared to thicker vdW layers. However, the magnitude of this surface energy reduction quickly decreases with increasing number of atomic layers inside the single vdW layer for different vdW materials. Such atomic-layer-dependence in surface energy reduction helps explain the different effectiveness of exfoliation for different vdW materials down to a single vdW layer.

Title: Observation of σ-πcoupling and mode selection in optically trapped artificial polariton molecules
Authors: Krzysztof Sawicki, Valtýr Kári Daníelsson, Dmitriy Dovzhenko, Pavlos G. Lagoudakis, Simone De Liberato, Helgi Sigurðsson
Abstract: Microcavity exciton-polariton condensates under additional transverse confinement constitute a flexible optical platform to study the coupling mechanism between confined nonequilibrium and nonlinear states of matter. Driven far from equilibrium, polariton condensates can display spontaneous synchronization and instabilities depending on excitation and material parameters, showcasing emergent and intricate interference patterns based on mode competition over mutual gain landscapes. Here, we explore this coupling mechanism between polariton condensates populating the first excited ${\it p}$-state manifold of coupled optically trapped condensates and show a rich structure of patterns based on excitation parameters. The optical reconfigurability of the laser excitation patterns enables the creation of an annular-shaped beam to confine polaritons in a tailored trapping potential, whilst the dissipative nature of the optical traps enables effective interaction with neighboring condensates. Our results underpin the potential role of polariton condensates in exploring and simulating $\sigma$ and $\pi$ molecular bonding mechanisms between artificial two-dimensional diatomic orbitals and beyond.

Title: Micromagnetic Design of Bias-Free Reconfigurable Microwave Properties in Hexagonal Shaped Multilayer Nanomagnets
Authors: Krishna Begari
Abstract: Magnetic miniaturized nanostructures hold great promise for current and future microwave technologies due to their magnetization dynamics in the GHz frequency range. This work presents a method for investigating reconfigurable microwave properties using a novel hexagonal nanomagnet structure. Micromagnetic simulations are employed to investigate the magnetic static and dynamic properties of the nanomagnets. A simple field initialization method is used to examine two distinct magnetic remanent states in each sample. A nanosecond-width magnetic pulse field can be applied to tune the unique magnetization dynamics parameters corresponding to the different remanent states. Find that for both single-layer and multilayer nanomagnets, there is a notable frequency shift in the sub-GHz and GHz regions between the two distinct magnetic remanent states.

Title: Engineering Topological Materials
Authors: Amit Goft, Eric Akkermans
Abstract: The tenfold classification provides a powerful framework for organizing topological phases of matter based on symmetry and spatial dimension. However, it does not offer a systematic method for transitioning between classes or engineering materials to realize desired topological properties. In this work, we introduce a general method for designing topological materials by embedding defects or spatial textures, which alter symmetry or dimension. This enables controlled navigation across the tenfold table, allowing one to induce topological phase transitions on demand. We illustrate this approach through several nontrivial examples, demonstrating how local defects can generate phases with different symmetries and topological invariants.

Title: Chern junctions in Moiré-Patterned Graphene/PbI2
Authors: Sun Yan, M. Monteverde, V. Derkach, K. Watanabe, T. Taniguchi, F. Chiodi, H. Bouchiat, A.D. Chepelianskii
Abstract: Expanding the moiré material library continues to unlock novel quantum phases and emergent electronic behaviors. In this work, we introduce PbI2 into the moiré family and investigate the magnetotransport properties of moiré superlattice in a hexagonal boron nitride/graphene/PbI2 heterostructures. In high-field quantum Hall regime, we observe a robust dissipationless transport at charge neutrality point, indicative of incompressible states stabilized at the filling factor vh = 0. Additionally, a fractional conductance plateau at 2/3 e2/h emerges, which we attribute to a Chern junction between domains with distinct Chern numbers originating from moiré-modulated and conventional integer quantum Hall states. The moiré Hofstadter spectrum displays an unconventional flavor sequence, likely influenced by proximity-induced spin-orbit coupling from the PbI2 layer. We also see coherent electronic interference along lines with Chern number vm = -2. These findings position PbI2-based heterostructures as a versatile platform for realizing spin-orbit-enhanced moiré phenomena and engineering coherent edge transport in two-dimensional quantum materials.

Title: Magnetic Anisotropy in Two-dimensional van der Waals Magnetic Materials and Their Heterostructures: Importance, Mechanisms, and Opportunities
Authors: Yusheng Hou, Ruqian Wu
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) magnetism in atomically thin van der Waals (vdW) monolayers and heterostructures has attracted significant attention due to its promising potential for next-generation spintronic and quantum technologies. A key factor in stabilizing long-range magnetic order in these systems is magnetic anisotropy, which plays a crucial role in overcoming the limitations imposed by the Mermin-Wagner theorem. This review provides a comprehensive theoretical and experimental overview of the importance of magnetic anisotropy in enabling intrinsic 2D magnetism and shaping the electronic, magnetic, and topological properties of 2D vdW materials. We begin by summarizing the fundamental mechanisms that determine magnetic anisotropy, emphasizing the contributions from strong ligand spin-orbit coupling of ligand atoms and unquenched orbital magnetic moments. We then examine a range of material engineering approaches, including alloying, doping, electrostatic gating, strain, and pressure, that have been employed to effectively tune magnetic anisotropy in these materials. Finally, we discuss open challenges and promising future directions in this rapidly advancing field. By presenting a broad perspective on the role of magnetic anisotropy in 2D magnetism, this review aims to stimulate ongoing efforts and new ideas toward the realization of robust, room-temperature applications based on 2D vdW magnetic materials and their heterostructures.

Title: Extraordinary surface critical behavior induced by a topological dimer phase in a two-dimensional Heisenberg quantum magnet
Authors: Zhe Wang, Longye Lu, Shang-Qiang Ning, Zenan Liu, Yan-Cheng Wang, Zheng Yan, Wenan Guo
Abstract: Using quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we study the dimerized spin-1/2 Heisenberg model on a square lattice, focusing on the paramagnetic dimer phase and its edge states, and associated surface criticality behavior. The model can also be viewed as two-dimensional antiferromagnetically (AF) coupled usual ladders with AF rungs. We demonstrate that the dimer phase of the model, previously considered topologically trivial, is actually a quasi-one-dimensional (Q1D) Haldane phase belonging to a symmetry-protected topological (SPT) state. This is established by measuring generalized strange correlators introduced in this work and further confirmed by showing that the nontrivial edge state on a zigzag cut in the dimer phase is ferromagnetically ordered, resulting from effective ferromagnetic interactions between degenerate spinons generated on each side of the zigzag cut. Furthermore, we show that the ordered edge state gives rise to an extraordinary surface critical behavior at the (2+1)-dimensional O(3) bulk critical points of the model, which contradicts theoretical predictions based on classical-quantum mapping.

Title: Kinetic energy in random recurrent neural networks
Authors: Li-Ru Zhang, Haiping Huang
Abstract: The relationship between unstable fixed points and chaotic dynamics in high-dimensional neural dynamics remains elusive. In this work, we investigate the kinetic energy distribution of random recurrent neural networks by combining dynamical mean-field theory with extensive numerical simulations. We find that the average kinetic energy shifts continuously from zero to a positive value at a critical value of coupling variance (synaptic gain), with a power-law behavior close to the critical point. The steady-state activity distribution is further calculated by the theory and compared with simulations on finite-size systems. This study provides a first step toward understanding the landscape of kinetic energy, which may reflect the structure of phase space for the non-equilibrium dynamics.

Title: Strongly correlated electronic superconductivity in the noncentrosymmetric Re-Os-based high/medium-entropy alloys
Authors: Rui Chen, Longfu Li, Lingyong Zeng, Kuan Li, Peifeng Yu, Kangwang Wang, Zaichen Xiang, Shuangyue Wang, Jingjun Qin, Wanyi Zhang, Yucheng Li, Tian Shang, Huixia Luo
Abstract: The class of unconventional superconductors, particularly noncentrosymmetric superconductors, has been highly considered as potential materials for understanding the complex properties of quantum materials. Here, five previously unreported Re3.5Os3.5Ta0.5Hf0.5Nb3, Re3Os3Ta0.5Hf0.5Nb3, Re3.5Os3.5Mo0.5Hf0.5Nb3, Re3.5Os3.5Mo0.5W0.5Nb3, and Re3Os3Mo0.5Hf0.5Nb3 Re-Os-based high/medium-entropy alloys (MEAs-HEAs) with valence electron count ranging from 6.45 to 6.81 were synthesized and investigated using x-ray diffraction, transport, magnetization, and specific heat measurements. Our analyses confirm that all five compounds crystallize in a noncentrosymmetric {\alpha}-Mn-type structure and exhibit type-II superconductivity with Tc values from 4.20 K to 5.11 K, respectively. Unexpectedly, despite being immersed in an acidic environment for one month, the structures and superconducting properties of HEAs remain stable. Our findings indicate that the Tc increases with an increasing valence electron count in MEAs-HEAs. Furthermore, these noncentrosymmetric {\alpha}-Mn-type HEA superconductors have large Kadowaki-Woods ratios (KWR), implying the presence of strong electronic correlations.

Title: Alpha-, Beta-, and Gamma-TODD-G: Novel 2D Planar Carbon Allotropes
Authors: Kleuton A. L. Lima, Jose A. S. Laranjeira, Alysson M. A. Silva, Bill. D. Aparicio-Huacarpuma, Fabrício M. Vasconcelos, Julio R. Sambrano, Douglas S. Galvão, Luiz A. Ribeiro Junior
Abstract: We present a comprehensive first-principles investigation of three novel two-dimensional carbon allotropes: alpha-, beta-, and gamma-TODD-Graphene (TODD-G), composed of 3-8-12-16, 3-8-12-16, and 3-4-8-12 interconnected carbon rings with sp/sp2 hybridization, respectively. Structural optimization, phonon spectra, and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations confirm their thermal and dynamical stability. All phases exhibit metallic electronic behavior, with distinct Dirac-like features and tilted Dirac cones that suggest anisotropic charge transport. Mechanical analysis reveals tunable anisotropy: alpha-TODD-G is strongly anisotropic, beta-TODD-G shows moderate anisotropy, and gamma-TODD-G displays an almost isotropic mechanical response. Optical spectra further differentiate the phases, with gamma-TODD-G showing strong absorption in the infrared region, while alpha- and beta-TODD-G mainly absorb in the visible and ultraviolet ranges.

Title: Rotational-Mode-Enhanced Piezoelectricity in a Ferroelectric Double Helix
Authors: Yihao Hu, Shi Liu
Abstract: Recent theoretical work has predicted the existence of a ``dipole spiral" structure in strained freestanding membranes, promising a route to giant electromechanical responses[\href{this https URL}{PRL \textbf{133}, 046802 (2024)}]. However, its microscopic nature, energetic landscape, and electronic consequences remain largely unexplored. Here, using first-principles calculations on PbTiO$_3$ under biaxial tensile strain, we unveil a novel form of polar order: a chiral, non-collinear ferroelectric double helix. We find that the Pb- and Ti-cation sublattices form two distinct, intertwined helices, reminiscent of DNA. This intricate topology is stabilized by a collective helical twisting of the oxygen octahedral framework, which mediates an emergent electric Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya this http URL unique structure, conceptualized as a ``self-Moiré" crystal, manifests two coupled functionalities. First, it possesses a rotational pseudo-zero-energy mode that underpins a giant piezoelectric response ($e_{33}\approx$16 C/m$^2$). Second, the spiral's long-period potential fundamentally reconstructs the electronic band structure, leading to an emergent multi-valley electronic topology at the valence band edge. Our work establishes a powerful, purely physical route to designing complex chiral order and provides a unified platform where structural topology, giant electromechanical coupling, and multi-valley electronics are intrinsically linked.

Title: Aharonov-Bohm interference from coherent spin-polarized edge transport in Fe(Te,Se) superconducting rings
Authors: Mohammad Javadi Balakan, Shiva Heidari, Genda Gu, Qiang Li, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Ji Ung Lee
Abstract: We report the coexistence of Aharonov-Bohm and Little-Parks oscillations in mesoscopic Fe(Te,Se) rings. The magnetoresistance shows two distinct periodicities: an $h/e$ component from ballistic edge interference and an $h/2e$ component from fluxoid quantization of Cooper pairs. Aharonov-Bohm oscillations persist deep into the superconducting phase, exhibit current-field symmetry, and follow a temperature dependence captured by a helical Luttinger liquid model, consistent with edge states in a topological superconductor.

Title: Observation of Super-ballistic Brownian Motion in Liquid
Authors: Jason Boynewicz, Michael C. Thumann, Mark G. Raizen
Abstract: Brownian motion is a foundational problem in physics and is characterized by a mean squared displacement that scales linearly in time in thermal equilibrium, known as diffusion. At short times, the mean squared displacement becomes ballistic, scaling as t^2. This effect was predicted by Einstein in 1907 and recently observed experimentally. We report that this picture is only true on average; by conditioning specific initial velocities, we predict theoretically and confirm by experiment that the mean squared displacement becomes super-ballistic, with a power scaling law of t^(5/2). This new result is due to the colored noise of incompressible fluids, resulting in a non-zero first moment for the thermal force when conditioned on non-zero initial velocities. These results are a first step towards the unraveling of nonequilibrium dynamics of fluids.

Title: Constitutive modeling of viscoelastic solids at large strains based on the theory of evolving natural configurations
Authors: Tarun Singh, Sandipan Paul
Abstract: The theory of evolving natural configurations is an effective technique to model dissipative processes. In this paper, we use this theory to revisit nonlinear constitutive models of viscoelastic solids. Particularly, a Maxwell and a Kelvin-Voigt model and their associated standard solids, viz., a Zener and a Poynting-Thompson solids respectively, have been modeled within a Lagrangian framework. We show that while a strain-space formulation of the evolving natural configurations is useful in modeling Maxwell-type materials, a stress-space formulation that incorporates a rate of dissipation function in terms of the relevant configurational forces is required for modeling the Kelvin-Voigt type materials. Furthermore, we also show that the basic Maxwell and Kelvin-Voigt models can be obtained as limiting cases from the derived standard solid models. Integration algorithms for the proposed models have been developed and numerical solutions for a relevant boundary value problem are obtained. The response of the developed models have been compared and benchmarked with experimental data. Specifically, the response of the novel Poynting-Thompson model is studied in details. This model shows a very good match with the existing experimental data obtained from a uniaxial stretching of polymers over a large extent of strain. The relaxation behavior and rate effects for the developed models have been studied.

Title: Theory of magnon hydrodynamics in collinear antiferromagnets
Authors: Vivianne Olguín-Arias, Alireza Qaiumzadeh, Roberto E. Troncoso
Abstract: We investigate the transport of spin angular momentum and linear momentum carried by magnons in electrically insulating collinear antiferromagnets (AFs). Focusing on both transverse and longitudinal geometries, we model magnons as a viscous fluid and explore the hydrodynamic transport regime that emerges when the magnon-magnon scattering length is shorter than the momentum-relaxation length, such that momentum-conserving processes dominate over momentum-relaxing ones. We develop a theoretical framework to investigate viscous effects in the magnon hydrodynamic regime, which give rise to measurable transport signatures such as nonlocal resistance and spin and thermal conductance. Accounting for both momentum and spin relaxations, we derive hydrodynamic equations governing magnon momentum and spin transport. Notably, interspecies scattering between antiferromagnetic magnons with opposite spin angular momentum induces drag-like effects that strongly modify spin current propagation. We derive expressions for magnon conductivity and introduce an accessibility parameter quantifying intra-band momentum transfer. Our results establish antiferromagnetic insulators as a promising platform for observing magnon-fluid dynamics and exploring collective spin transport phenomena.

Title: Superconducting gap symmetry of 2DEG at (111)-oriented LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interface
Authors: J. Czarnecki, M. Zegrodnik, P. Wójcik
Abstract: We investigate the superconducting properties of the two-dimensional electron gas at the (111) LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interface. Using a multiorbital tight-binding model defined on a hexagonal lattice, we analyze the emergence of superconductivity driven by both interlayer (nearest-neighbor) and intralayer (next-nearest-neighbor) pairing interactions, with a particular focus on the symmetry of the superconducting gap. We demonstrate that, in both pairing scenarios, the superconducting gap transforms according to the $A_1$ irreducible representation of the $C_{6v}$ point group. Within the interlayer pairing scenario, the superconducting phase is characterized by a fully gapped quasiparticle excitation spectrum exhibiting extended $s$-wave symmetry, accompanied by an enhancement of the superconducting gap magnitude in the vicinity of the van Hove singularity. Conversely, the intralayer pairing channel produces a distinctive double-dome structure in the superconducting phase diagram, with the gap symmetry evolving from a fully gapped, extended $s$-wave at low carrier densities to a nodal extended $s$-wave state at higher electron concentrations. The qualitative agreement with experimentally observed nonmonotonic behavior of the critical temperature $T_c(V_g)$ suggests that intralayer next-nearest-neighbor pairing may play a dominant role in the superconductivity of the (111) LAO/STO interface.

Title: Order-Disorder Transition in Delay Vicsek Model
Authors: Robert Horton, Viktor Holubec
Abstract: Interactions in active matter systems inherently involve delays due to information processing and actuation lags. We numerically investigate the impact of such delays on the phase behavior of the Vicsek model for motile active matter at a large but fixed system size. While the delayed Vicsek model retains the same three phases as the standard version -- an ordered state, a liquid-gas coexistence state, and a disordered state -- the presence of delay qualitatively alters the system's dynamics. At the relatively high velocity considered in this study, the critical noise for the transition between the ordered and coexistence states exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on delay, whereas the critical noise required for the transition to the disordered state increases with delay. Consequently, the width of the noise interval in which phase separation occurs broadens with increasing delay. Short delays stabilize the ordered phase, while long delays destabilize it in favor of the coexistence phase, which is consistently stabilized compared to the disordered state. Furthermore, the number of bands observed in the coexistence state at a given noise increases, and the time required for their formation decreases with delay. This acceleration is attributed to the emergence of swirling structures whose typical radius grows with increasing delay. Our results demonstrate that time delay in the Vicsek model acts as an effective control parameter for tuning the system's dynamic phase behavior.

Title: Multiple quantum spin Hall states and topological current divider in Twisted Bilayer WSe$_2$
Authors: Hao He, Zhao Gong, Shuai Li, Jian-Jun Liu, Hui-Ying Mu, Xing-Tao An
Abstract: It has been demonstrated that topological quantum spin Hall (QSH) state exist in twisted bilayers of transition metal dichalcogenides. However, a comprehensive theoretical characterization of the topological edge states remains a topic of interest and an unresolved issue. Here, the topological transport properties of the twisted WSe$_2$ bilayers are investigated. Beyond the conventional single QSH, we identify emergent double and quartuple quantum spin Hall states, hosting two and four pairs of counter-propagating helical edge channels respectively. Furthermore, the charge carriers in these edge states are not localized at edge but rather the high potential point of the moire superlattice boundary, undergoing interlayer transitions and propagating forward continuously. We term these edge states as moire edge states. These edge states can survive in non-magnetic disorder, with the robustness of double QSH states surpassing that of single QSH states. At a twisting angle of 2.45$^\circ$, the transition between the single and double QSH states can be achieved by adjusting the gate on the surface. Based on this, we propose a five-terminal device to as a topological current devider. Our findings provide support for the development of dissipationless spintronics.

Title: Non-Hermitian superconducting diode effect
Authors: Junjie Qi, Ming Lu, Jie Liu, Chui-Zhen Chen, X. C. Xie
Abstract: The study of non-reciprocal phenomena has long captivated interest in both Hermitian and non-Hermitian systems. The superconducting diode effect (SDE) is a non-reciprocal phenomenon characterized by unequal critical charge supercurrents flowing in opposite directions in Hermitian superconducting systems. In this study, we introduce an SDE driven by non-Hermiticity in a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) under an external magnetic flux, which we refer to as the non-Hermitian SDE. Non-Hermiticity is introduced by coupling one of the two Josephson junctions to a gapless electron reservoir, introducing phase decoherence. Remarkably, we find that an emergent non-Hermitian Fermi-Dirac distribution can give rise to SDE in the non-Hermitian SQUID. We analyze the behavior of the SDE under both direct current (dc) and alternating current (ac) biases, highlighting the appearance of direction-dependent critical currents and asymmetric Shapiro steps as hallmarks of the SDE. Our findings not only reveal an experimentally accessible mechanism for non-Hermitian SDE but also open new avenues for investigating non-reciprocal phenomena in non-Hermitian systems.

Title: Symmetry breaking and competing valence bond states in the star lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet
Authors: Pratyay Ghosh, Jan Koziol, Samuel Nyckees, Kai Phillip Schmidt, Frédéric Mila
Abstract: We investigate the ground state phase diagram of the spin-$1/2$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on the star lattice using infinite projected entangled pair states (iPEPS) and high-order series expansions. The model includes two distinct couplings: $J_d$ on the dimer bonds and $J_t$ on the trimer bonds. While it is established that the system hosts a valence bond solid (VBS) phase for $J_d \ge J_t$, the ground state phase diagram for $J_d < J_t$ has remained unsettled. Our iPEPS simulations uncover a first-order phase transition at $J_d/J_t \approx 0.18$, significantly lower than previously reported estimates. Beyond this transition, we identify a close competition between two valence bond crystal (VBC) states: a columnar VBC and a $\sqrt{3} \times \sqrt{3}$ VBC, with the latter consistently exhibiting lower energy across all finite bond dimensions. The high-order series expansion supports this by finding that the $\sqrt{3} \times \sqrt{3}$ VBC state indeed becomes energetically favorable, but only at sixth order in perturbation theory, revealing the subtle nature of the competition between candidate states.

Title: A case for resonant x-ray Bragg diffraction by a collinear antiferromagnet Li2Ni3P4O14
Authors: Stephen W. Lovesey
Abstract: Magnetic axial and polar (Dirac) nickel multipoles contribute to resonant x-ray Bragg amplitudes in a symmetry informed analysis of monoclinic Li2Ni3P4O14 presented for future diffraction experiments. Magnetic long-range order below a temperature 14.5 K can be viewed as a two-dimensional trimerized antiferromagnet with Ni ions in two Wyckoff positions in the centrosymmetric magnetic space group P21/c. It permits the coupling to circular polarization in the primary x-ray beam, unlike the corresponding diffraction by an antiferromagnet characterized by anti-inversion and a linear magnetoelectric effect, e.g., historically significant chromium sesquioxide (Cr2O3) and Cu2(MoO4)(SeO3) (Lovesey & van der Laan, 2024). The space group is inferred from neutron Bragg diffraction patterns, without an allowance for permitted Dirac dipoles (anapoles) and quadrupoles (Chikara et al., 2025).

Title: Electronic mean free path of the cuprate superconductor Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+δ}$ from thermal Hall conductivity
Authors: Emma Campillo, Manel Mezidi, Lu Chen, Ashvini Vallipuram, Jordan Baglo, Munkhtuguldur Altangerel, Gaël Grissonnanche, Genda Gu, Louis Taillefer
Abstract: We use thermal transport to access the electronic mean free path of $d$-wave quasiparticles in one of the most widely studied cuprate superconductors, Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ (Bi2212). We have measured the thermal conductivity $\kappa_{\rm xx}$ and the thermal Hall conductivity $\kappa_{\rm xy}$ of three single crystals across a range of dopings. In the overdoped and optimally-doped samples, a clear enhancement is observed in both $\kappa_{\rm xx}$ and $\kappa_{\rm xy}$ upon cooling below the critical temperature $T_{\rm c}$, due to a suppression of the inelastic electron-electron scattering as electrons condense into pairs. The underdoped sample shows no enhancement in either, pointing to a high degree of disorder in that sample. For the two highest dopings, the magnitude of the enhancement in $\kappa_{\rm xy}$ is controlled by the strength of the elastic impurity scattering. Using a prior model to estimate the mean free path from $\kappa_{\rm xy}$ data, we find that the mean free path in Bi2212 is approximately 7 times shorter than in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$, considered to be one of the least disordered cuprates. We conclude that the thermal Hall technique is a good way to compare the mean free path of $d$-wave quasiparticles in various cuprate materials.

Title: Unraveling Size Dependent Bi- and Tri-exciton Characteristics in CdSe/CdS Core/Shell Quantum Dots via Ensemble Time Gated Heralded Spectroscopy
Authors: Einav Scharf, Rotem Liran, Adar Levi, Omer Alon, Nadav Chefetz, Dan Oron, Uri Banin
Abstract: Multiexcitons (MXs) in quantum dots (QDs) manifest many body interactions under quantum confinement. Beyond this fundamental interest, MXs are of importance in numerous optoelectronic applications including QD lasing, light emitting diodes and photocatalysis. Yet, the strong interactions between MXs leading to rapid non-radiative decay introduce challenges for their characterization. While so far, the measurement techniques rely either on indirect methods or on single particle studies, herein we introduce a new method to study MXs in QD ensembles utilizing spectrally resolved time-gated heralded spectroscopy. With this approach we extract the biexciton binding energies in a series of CdSe/CdS QD ensembles of several core/shell sizes, manifesting a transition between attractive and repulsive exciton-exciton interactions. Additionally, for triexcitons, which involve occupation of two excitons in the 1s energy levels, as well as one exciton in the 1p energy levels, we address the open issues of isolating the spectra of the two triexciton pathways from one another and from high-order MXs, and extract the MX lifetimes. The measurements on ensembles provide high photon counts and low noise levels, and alongside the time-gated heralded approach thus enable the observation of MX characteristics that are difficult to resolve in single particle studies. The approach can be further implemented in the characterization of the energies and lifetimes of MXs in other QD systems to enable rapid characterization and understanding of the MX properties. Such insight bears relevance to optoelectronic applications ranging from lasing to electroluminescent devices to quantum light sources.

Title: Entropy production in non-reciprocal polar active mixtures
Authors: Kim L. Kreienkamp, Sabine H. L. Klapp
Abstract: The out-of-equilibrium character of active systems is often twofold, arising from both the activity itself and from non-reciprocal couplings between constituents. A well-established measure to quantify the system's distance from equilibrium is the informatic entropy production rate. Here, we ask the question whether and how the informatic entropy production rate reflects collective behaviors and transitions in an active mixture with non-reciprocal polar couplings. In such systems, non-reciprocal orientational couplings can induce chiral motion of particles. At the field-theoretical level, transitions to these time-dependent chiral states are marked by so-called exceptional points. Here, we show that at a particle level, the entropy production rate within the chiral states increases with the degree of non-reciprocity, provided it is sufficiently strong. Moreover, even at small degrees of non-reciprocity, the transitions via exceptional points leave clear signatures in the entropy production rate, which exhibits pronounced peaks at coupling strengths corresponding to the field-theoretical exceptional points. Overall, the increase and peaks of the entropy production rate mirror the susceptibility of the polarization order parameter at the particle level. This correspondence is supported by a field-theoretical analysis, which reveals that, in the long-wavelength limit, the entropy production rate scales with the susceptibilities of the polarization fields.

Title: Quantum criticality and emergent orders in the spin-1 bilinear-biquadratic-Kitaev chain
Authors: Zhiling Wei, Zhengzhong Du, Xiaodong Cao, Wen-Long You, Yi Lu
Abstract: Higher-spin quantum magnets with competing interactions offer a rich platform for exploring quantum phases that transcend the paradigms of spin-1/2 systems, owing to their enlarged local Hilbert spaces and the emergence of multipolar correlations. We investigate a one-dimensional spin-1 chain where quadrupolar order is promoted by two distinct mechanisms: conventional bilinear-biquadratic exchange and bond-directional antiferromagnetic Kitaev frustration. Using density matrix renormalization group calculations, we determine the complete ground-state phase diagram and uncover two emergent phases induced by the Kitaev interaction: a Kitaev nematic phase and a Kitaev-dimer phase. The Kitaev nematic phase emerges from a fragile biquadratic dimer state via a continuous quantum phase transition in the Ising universality class. The Kitaev dimer phase spontaneously breaks a screw symmetry to favor either $x$- or $y$-spin bonding, forming a gapped state that coexists with a crystalline order of alternating $\mathbb{Z}_2$ fluxes.

Title: Many-body perturbation theory vs. density functional theory: A systematic benchmark for band gaps of solids
Authors: Max Großmann, Marc Thieme, Malte Grunert, Erich Runge
Abstract: We benchmark many-body perturbation theory against density functional theory (DFT) for the band gaps of solids. We systematically compare four $GW$ variants $-$ $G_{0}W_{0}$ using the Godby-Needs plasmon-pole approximation ($G_{0}W_{0}$-PPA), full-frequency quasiparticle $G_{0}W_{0}$ (QP$G_{0}W_{0}$), full-frequency quasiparticle self-consistent $GW$ (QS$GW$), and QS$GW$ augmented with vertex corrections in $W$ (QS$G\hat{W}$) $-$ against the currently best performing and popular density functionals mBJ and HSE06. Our results show that $G_{0}W_{0}$-PPA calculations offer only a marginal accuracy gain over the best DFT methods, however at a higher cost. Replacing the PPA with a full-frequency integration of the dielectric screening improves the predictions dramatically, almost matching the accuracy of the QS$G\hat{W}$. The QS$GW$ removes starting-point bias, but systematically overestimates experimental gaps by about $15\%$. Adding vertex corrections to the screened Coulomb interaction, i.e., performing a QS$G\hat{W}$ calculation, eliminates the overestimation, producing band gaps that are so accurate that they even reliably flag questionable experimental measurements.

Title: Observe novel tricritical phenomena in self-organized Fermi gas induced by higher order Fermi surface nesting
Authors: Yilun Xu, Feng-Xiao Sun, Qiongyi He
Abstract: Cold atom systems in optical lattices have long been recognized as an ideal platform for bridging condense matter physics and quantum optics. Here, we investigate the 1D fermionic superradiance in an optical lattice, and observe novel tricritical phenomena and multistability in finite-temperature cases. As a starting point, which can be analytically calculated, we compare the 1D and 2D Fermi gases in zero-temperature limit. It turns out that the tricritical point originates from the higher-order Fermi surface nesting (FSN), and the infrared divergence in 1D systems is absent in 2D cases. When extending to finite-temperature cases, our numerical results reveal that both quantum- and classical-type trcritical phenomena can be observed simultaneously. Moreover, there exists an optimal temperature for observing superradiance. This work provides a new approach to understanding the relation between quantum and classical phase transitions.

Title: Third harmonic-mediated amplification in TWPA
Authors: E. Rizvanov, S. Kern, P. Neilinger, M. Grajcar
Abstract: In Josephson Traveling-Wave Parametric Amplifiers, higher-order harmonics of the pump tone and its sidebands are commonly present and typically regarded as parasitic. Consequently, most design efforts have focused on suppressing these harmonics. In spite of that, motivated by transient simulations, we extend the coupled-mode theory and demonstrate that, contrary to conventional belief, the third harmonic can enhance amplifier performance, improving both gain and bandwidth. We show that the recently developed plasma oscillation-based amplifier is particularly well-suited for exploiting this effect. Their dispersion relation enables us to observe the phenomenon in transient numerical simulations using JoSIM and WRspice. These simulations reveal improvement of the amplifier's performance, specifically the doubling of the bandwidth and an increase in the gain.

Title: Enhanced spin-to-charge conversion in La$_{0.67}$Sr$_{0.33}$MnO$_3$/NdNiO$_3$ bilayers at the nickelate metal-insulator phase transition
Authors: Biswajit Sahoo, Sarmistha Das, Akilan K, Alexandre Pofelski, Sebastien Petit-Watelot, Juan-Carlos Rojas-Sánchez, Yimei Zhu, Alex Frano, Eric E Fullerton
Abstract: Phase transition materials such as NdNiO3 (NNO) when coupled with low damping ferromagnets such as La$_{0.67}$Sr$_{0.33}$MnO$_3$ (LSMO) can lead to new multi-functional material systems harnessing the interplay of charge, spin and orbital degrees of freedom. In this study, we probe the evolution of the spin-to-charge conversion in epitaxial all-oxide LSMO (12 nm)/NNO (4, 8, and 16 nm) bilayers. Using spin pumping ferromagnetic resonance we track the spin-charge conversion in the NNO layer through the paramagnetic metal to antiferromagnetic insulator transition and observe a pronounced enhancement of the inverse spin Hall effect signal at the onset of this transition. We attribute this enhancement to the electronic and magnetic disorder in NNO at the first-order phase transition, thereby providing insights into the mechanism of spin transport through the phase transition. The tunability of spin charge conversion in this low damping bilayer system offers a pathway for developing multifunctional, energy-efficient spintronic devices.

Title: Mean first-encounter times of simultaneous random walkers with resetting on networks
Authors: Daniel Rubio-Gómez, Alejandro P. Riascos, José L. Mateos
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of simultaneous random walkers with resetting on networks and derive exact analytical expressions for the mean first-encounter times of Markovian random walkers. Specifically, we consider two cases for the simultaneous dynamics of two random walkers on networks: when only one walker resets to the initial node, and when both walkers return to their initial positions. In both cases, the encounter times are expressed in terms of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the transition matrix of the normal random walk, providing a spectral interpretation of the impact of resetting. We validate our approach through examples on rings, Cayley trees, and random networks generated using the Erdős-Rényi, Watts-Strogatz, and Barabási-Albert algorithms, where resetting significantly reduces encounter times. The proposed framework can be extended to other types of random walk dynamics, transport processes, or multiple-walker scenarios, with potential applications in human mobility, epidemic spreading, and search strategies in complex systems.

Title: A Thermodynamic Model for Thermomigration in Metals
Authors: Daniel J. Long, Edmund Tarleton, Alan C.F. Cocks, Felix Hofmann
Abstract: We investigate the mechanisms involved in the thermomigration of interstitial hydrogen in metals. Using statistical thermodynamics, we develop a comprehensive mechanistic model to capture the controlling effects. Crucially, through validation against published experimental data, our results demonstrate that an electron-wind effect plays a significant role, particularly for materials in which the thermomigration direction matches the heat flux. These findings provide new insights into the factors that affect the localisation of solutes in metals. Moreover, our results indicate that atomistic models may be inadequate for detailed thermomigration studies due to the omission of electronic effects.

Title: Stranski-Krastanov Growth of Disordered ScNx Thin Films on MgO(100): Influence of Defect Densities on Electronic Structure and Transport Properties
Authors: Susmita Chowdhury, Rachana Gupta, Najnin Bano, Yogesh Kumar, Shashi Prakash, Dinesh Kumar Shukla, Vasant G. Sathe, Mukul Gupta
Abstract: We report a nascent real time Stranski-Krastanov growth of reactively sputtered ScNx thin films on MgO(100). The epitaxial growth was limited to 5 nm at a substrate temperature (Ts) of 25 C while the self-sustaining epitaxial nature along the [100] azimuth was retained up to 25 nm in Ts = 250 and 500 C samples due to enhanced adatom mobility. At Ts = 700 C, the film showed half order in-situ RHEED pattern, with forbidden (hkl) planes indicating N deficient hcp Sc-N phase. Presence of defect densities i.e., N vacancies and O interstitials leads to a disorder in ScNx system with weak localization effect and appearance of Raman relaxed first order transverse and longitudinal optical phonon modes and further leads to metal like Seebeck coefficient. Higher grain boundaries at Ts = 25 C and higher N out-diffusion at Ts = 700 C paves way for incorporation of higher oxygen interstitial in these samples.

Title: Hole-doping reduces the coercive field in ferroelectric hafnia
Authors: Pravan Omprakash, Gwan Yeong Jung, Guodong Ren, Rohan Mishra
Abstract: Ferroelectric hafnia holds promise for next-generation memory and logic applications because of its CMOS compatibility. However, the high coercive field required for polarization switching in hafnia remains a critical challenge for efficient device operations. Using first-principles calculations and phenomenological modeling, we predict that hole doping can reduce the coercive field from 8 MV/cm in undoped hafnia to 6 MV/cm in hafnia doped with 0.2 holes per formula unit (f.u.). In the absence of doping, the reversal of polarization of the Pca21 phase is preferred through the non-polar, tetragonal P42/nmc phase. This switching pathway involves the coupling of three hard distortion modes that render undoped hafnia as an improper ferroelectric. The overall energy barrier through this pathway remains unchanged (80 meV/f.u.) upon hole doping. However, the introduction of holes hardens the polar distortion mode that connects the polar Pca21 phase to the non-polar, orthorhombic Pbcm phase, and reduces the energy barrier from 180 meV/f.u. in undoped hafnia to 80 meV/f.u. at 0.2 holes/f.u.. Overall, hole doping makes the latter switching pathway through the Pbcm phase competitive, and renders hafnia as a proper ferroelectric with a lower coercive field.

Title: Direct Measurement of the Effective Electronic Temperature in Organic Semiconductors
Authors: Anton Kompatscher, Martijn Kemerink
Abstract: Organic semiconductors show complex phenomena due to their high energetic disorder. A striking example is the possibility of an increased effective temperature T_eff of the charge carrier distribution relative to the lattice temperature, which results from the slow charge carrier relaxation after excitation, either by high electric field or photon absorption. The increased effective temperature has been linked to conductivity enhancements and performance increases in actual devices, but a direct observation has been lacking. Here, we utilize nanoscopic tree-terminal devices to measure the Seebeck voltage arising in a doped organic polymer semiconductor due to a field-driven enhancement of the effective electronic temperature, providing direct proof of the existence of T_eff. The results agree quantitatively with numerical predictions by a kinetic Monte Carlo model. The findings not only provide fundamental understanding but also indicate an avenue towards low-loss thermoelectric devices.

Title: Stacking-induced type-II quantum spin Hall insulators with high spin Chern number in unconventional magnetism
Authors: Chao-Yang Tan, Panjun Feng, Ze-Feng Gao, Fengjie Ma, Peng-Jie Guo, Zhong-Yi Lu
Abstract: Generally, stacking two monolayer type-I quantum spin Hall insulators gives rise to a trivial insulator. However, whether or not stacking two type-II quantum spin Hall insulators results in a trivial insulator has not yet been explored. In this letter, based on the calculations of lattice model, we demonstrate that stacking two type-II quantum spin Hall insulators does not yield a trivial insulator, but instead forms a quantum spin Hall insulator with high spin Chern number. In this phase, there are two pairs of topological edge states with opposite chirality and polarization coexisting in the boundary. Our calculations further reveal that the quantized spin Hall conductance of the bilayer is twice that of the monolayer. When U(1) symmetry is present, the high spin Chern number phase remains stable; when U(1) symmetry is broken, it persists over a broad parameter range. Furthermore, based on the first-principles electronic structure calculations, we propose that bilayer Nb$_2$SeTeO is a type-II quantum spin Hall insulator with high spin Chern number. Finally, extending this strategy to multilayer stacks naturally leads to quantum spin Hall insulator with larger spin Chern number. Our work not only deepens the distinction between type-I and type-II quantum spin Hall insulators, but also offers a route toward realizing highly quantized spin Hall conductance.

Title: Disorder-induced stress-flow misalignment in soft glassy materials revealed using multi-directional shear
Authors: Frédéric Blanc, Guillaume Ovarlez, Adam Trigui, Kirsten Martens, Romain Mari
Abstract: Controlling the mechanical response of soft glassy materials, such as emulsions, foams, and colloidal suspensions, is key for many industrial processes. While their steady-state flow behavior is reasonably well understood, their response to complex flow histories, as encountered in operations like pumping or mixing, remains poorly known. Using a custom multi-axis shear apparatus that enables arbitrary changes in flow direction, we investigate how shear history influences the mechanical behavior of a model soft glassy system. We uncover a transient shear response orthogonal to the applied shear direction, together with an anisotropic yield surface. These effects point to an underlying anisotropic distribution of internal stresses imprinted by previous deformation. To rationalize this behavior, we use a mesoscopic elasto-plastic model, demonstrating that local mechanical disorder governs the emergence of macroscopic stress-flow misalignment. Our findings offer a new route to experimentally probe the distribution of local yield stresses in soft glassy materials.

Title: On Random Displacements in Critical Rydberg Atom Arrays
Authors: Xingyu Li, Shuyan Zhou, Xue Chen, Chengshu Li, Hanteng Wang
Abstract: Rydberg atom arrays promise high-fidelity quantum simulations of critical phenomena with flexible geometries. Yet experimental realizations inevitably suffer from disorder due to random displacements of atoms, leading to departures from the expected behavior. Here, we study how such positional disorder influences the Ising criticality. Since disorder breaks the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, one might expect the system to flow to an infinite-strength disordered fixed point, erasing all nontrivial critical features in low spatial dimensions. Remarkably, we find instead that disorder in Rydberg systems is subjected to nontrivial local constraints, making the physics markedly different from systems with more conventional spatially short-range correlated or long-range correlated disorder. This leads to new classes of criticalities even at dimensions where conventional disorder would destroy criticality altogether. We then demonstrate as a consequence how a novel pseudo-criticality emerges in mesoscopic Rydberg chains, and show that the renormalization group flow is governed by a locally constrained $\mathbb{Z}_2$-breaking perturbation. Our findings uncover new disorder-driven phenomena and underscore the importance of carefully treating disorder effects in quantum simulators.

Title: Quantum many-body scarring from Kramers-Wannier duality
Authors: Weslei B. Fontana, Fabrizio G. Oliviero, Yi-Ping Huang
Abstract: Kramers-Wannier duality, a hallmark of the Ising model, has recently gained renewed interest through its reinterpretation as a non-invertible symmetry with a state-level action. Using sequential quantum circuits (SQC), we argue that this duality governs the stability of quantum many-body scar (QMBS) states in a nonintegrable model, depending on whether the dual preserves the embedding conditions for scarring. This is supported by striking agreement between first-order perturbation theory and numerics, which capture scar dynamics despite chaotic spectra. Our results suggest that non-invertible dualities provide both a generative mechanism for new QMBS and a diagnostic for their stability.

Title: Global Tensor Network Renormalization for 2D Quantum systems: A new window to probe universal data from thermal transitions
Authors: Atsushi Ueda, Sander De Meyer, Adwait Naravane, Victor Vanthilt, Frank Verstraete
Abstract: We propose a new tensor network renormalization group (TNR) scheme based on global optimization and introduce a new method for constructing the finite-temperature density matrix of two-dimensional quantum systems. Combining these two into a new algorithm called thermal tensor network renormalization (TTNR), we obtain highly accurate conformal field theory (CFT) data at thermal transition points. This provides a new and efficient route for numerically identifying phase transitions, offering an alternative to the conventional analysis via critical exponents.

Title: Universal relations between thermoelectrics and noise in mesoscopic transport across a tunnel junction
Authors: Andrei I. Pavlov, Mikhail N. Kiselev
Abstract: We develop a unified theory of weakly probed differential observables for currents and noise in transport experiments. Our findings uncover a set of universal transport relations between thermoelectric and noise properties of a system probed through a tunnel contact, with the Wiedemann-Franz law being just one example of such universality between charge and heat currents. We apply this theory to various quantum dot systems, including multichannel Kondo, quantum Hall and Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev quantum dots, and demonstrate that each of the microscopic theories is characterized by a set of universal relations connecting conductance and thermoelectrics with noise. Violations of these relations indicate additional energy scales emerging in a system.

Title: Heat and super-diffusive melting fronts in unsaturated porous media
Authors: Eirik G. Flekkøy, Erika Eiser, Alex Hansen
Abstract: When water is present in a medium with pore sizes in a range around 10nm the corresponding freezing point depression will cause long range broadening of a melting front. Describing the freezing-point depression by the Gibbs-Thomson equation and the pore size distribution by a power law, we derive a non-linear diffusion equation for the fraction of melted water. This equation yields super-diffusive spreading of the melting front with a diffusion exponent which is given by the spatial dimension and the exponent describing the pore size distribution. We derive this solution analytically from energy conservation in the limit where all the energy is consumed by the melting and explore the validity of this approximation numerically. Finally, we explore a geological application of the theory to the case of one-dimensional sub-surface melting fronts in granular or soil systems. These fronts, which are produced by heating of the surface, spread at a super-diffusive rate and affect the subsurface to significantly larger depths than would a system without the effects of freezing point depression.

Title: Single-shot optical precessional magnetization switching of Pt/Co/Pt ferromagnetic trilayers
Authors: Rui Xu, Chen Xiao, Xiangyu Zheng, Renyou Xu, Xiaobai Ning, Tianyi Zhu, Dinghao Ma, Kangning Xu, Fei Xu, Youguang Zhang, Boyu Zhang, Jiaqi Wei
Abstract: Ultra-fast magnetization switching triggered by a single femtosecond laser pulse has gained significant attention over the last decade for its potential in low-power consumption, high-speed memory applications. However, this phenomenon has been primarily observed in Gd-based ferrimagnetic materials, which are unsuitable for storage due to their weak perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA). In this work, we demonstrated that applying a single laser pulse and an in-plane magnetic field can facilitate magnetic switching in a Pt/Co/Pt ferromagnetic trilayers stack within a specific laser power window. To further understand this phenomenon, we introduce a Cu layer to accelerates the re-establishment time of the anisotropy field of Pt/Co/Pt trilayers, which leads to bullseye-patterned magnetic switching. We have mapped state diagrams for these phenomena, and through micromagnetic simulations, we have determined that these switchings are influenced by thermal anisotropy torque, which can be modulated through PMA. These findings indicate that single-shot optical precessional magnetization reversal is feasible in a broader range of materials, opening avenues for the development of optical-magnetic memory devices.

Title: Symmetry Resolved Entanglement Entropy in a Non-Abelian Fractional Quantum Hall State
Authors: Mark J. Arildsen, Valentin Crépel, Nicolas Regnault, Benoit Estienne
Abstract: Symmetry-resolved entanglement entropy provides a powerful framework for probing the internal structure of quantum many-body states by decomposing entanglement into contributions from distinct symmetry sectors. In this work, we apply matrix product state techniques to study the bosonic, non-Abelian Moore-Read quantum Hall state, enabling precise numerical evaluation of both the full counting statistics and symmetry-resolved entanglement entropies. Our results reveal an approximate equipartition of entanglement among symmetry sectors, consistent with theoretical expectations and subject to finite-size corrections. The results also show that these expectations for symmetry-resolved entanglement entropy remain valid in the case of a non-Abelian state where the topological sectors cannot be distinguished by the Abelian $\mathrm{U}(1)$ symmetry alone, and where neutral and charged modes possess distinct velocities. We additionally perform a detailed comparison of the entanglement spectrum with predictions from the Li-Haldane conjecture, finding remarkable agreement, and enabling a more precise understanding of the effects of the distinct neutral and charged velocities. This not only provides a stringent test of the conjecture but also highlights its explanatory power in understanding the origin and structure of finite-size effects across different symmetry sectors.

Title: The use of open boundaries in stochastic hydrodynamic models of nucleation
Authors: James F. Lutsko
Abstract: Stochastic hydrodynamics is a central tool in the study of first order phase transitions at a fundamental level. Combined with sophisticated free energy models, e.g. as developed in classical Density Functional Theory, complex processes such as crystallization can be modeled and information such as free energy barriers, nucleation pathways and the unstable eigenvector and eigenvalues determined. The latter are particularly interesting as they play key roles in defining the natural (unbiased) order parameter and the nucleation rate respectively. As is often the case, computational realities restrict the size of system that can be modeled and this makes it difficult to achieve experimental conditions for which the volume is effectively infinite. In this paper, the use of open boundary conditions is discussed. By using an open system, the calculations become much closer to experimental conditions however, the introduction of open boundary conditions raises a number of questions concerning the stochastic model such as whether the fluctuation-dissipation relation is preserved and whether stationary points on the free energy surface remain stationary points of the dynamics.

Title: Ta2Pd3Te8: A potential candidate of 1D van der Waals stacked thermoelectric materials
Authors: Shi Chen, Aijun Hong, Junming Liu
Abstract: Discovering new thermoelectric (TE) materials is an eternal goal in the TE field. Excellent TE materials have ranged from 3D stacked to 2D stacked bulk. However, the 1D stacked receives little attention due to the scarcity in quantity. In this work, it is predicted that 1D van der Waals (vdW) stacked Ta2Pd3Te8 crystal is a compelling candidate for TE applications by combining first-principles calculations with phonon and electron Boltzmann transport equations and molecular dynamics methods. We find that Ta2Pd3Te8 crystal has mechanical, dynamical, and thermal stabilities, and its TE properties are featured by strong anisotropy, high power factor (PF) and low lattice thermal conductivity. The results indicate the ZT values of n-type Ta2Pd3Te8 at 900 K along a, b and c axes reach 0.48, 0.39 and 0.22, respectively. We propose that enlarging the bandgap can weaken the bipolar effect and thus significantly increases ZT to 1.11. The findings in the work not only stimulate more theoretical works on 1D vdW stacked TE materials, but also provide valuable information for experimentally improving TE materials.

Title: Negative differential conductance in triangular molecular assemblies
Authors: Chao Li, Vladislav Pokorný, Prokop Hapala, Martin Žonda, Ping Zhou, Silvio Decurtins, Shi-Xia Liu, Fengqi Song, Rémy Pawlak, Ernst Meyer
Abstract: We report the creation and characterization of a molecular-scale negative differential conductance (NDC) device by assembling a triangular trimer of 4,5,9,10-tetrabromo-1,3,6,8-tetraazapyrene (TBTAP) molecules on a superconducting Pb(111) substrate. Using low-temperature scanning tunneling spectroscopy, we observe robust NDC behavior manifesting as a decrease in current with increasing voltage between 0.7-0.9 V arising from the interplay of Coulomb blockade and strong inter-molecular capacitive coupling within the molecular cluster. Gate-controlled charging and discharging processes are directly visualized via two-dimensional differential conductance mapping, which reveals the emergence of Coulomb rings and spatial regions of NDC. Theoretical modeling using a three-impurity Anderson model and master equation approach quantitatively reproduces the experimental observations and demonstrates that the NDC emerges purely from electron correlations, independent of the underlying superconductivity. By tuning the geometry to a hexamer structure, we further show that cluster topology provides versatile control over electronic properties at the molecular scale. These results establish a functional platform for implementing multifunctional molecular devices and highlight a strategy toward programmable and scalable nanoelectronics.

Title: Nonreciprocal inertial spin-wave dynamics in twisted magnetic nanostrips
Authors: Massimiliano d'Aquino, Riccardo Hertel
Abstract: We develop a theoretical framework for inertial spin-wave dynamics in three-dimensional twisted soft-magnetic nanostrips, where curvature and torsion couple with magnetic inertia to generate terahertz (THz) magnetic oscillations. The resulting spin-wave spectra exhibit pronounced nonreciprocity due to effective symmetry breaking arising from geometric chirality and inertial effects. We show that this behavior is governed by a curvature-induced geometric (Berry) phase, which we analytically capture through compact expressions for dispersion relations and spectral linewidths in both nutational (THz) and precessional (GHz) regimes. Topological variations, including Möbius and helical geometries, impose distinct wavenumber quantization rules, elucidating the role of topology in spin-wave transport. These results position twisted magnetic strips as a viable platform for curvilinear THz magnonics and nonreciprocal spintronic applications.

Title: Unveiling the Lithium-Ion Transport Mechanism in Li2ZrCl6 Solid-State Electrolyte via Deep Learning-Accelerated Molecular Dynamics Simulations
Authors: Hanzeng Guo, Volodymyr Koverga, Selva Chandrasekaran Selvaraj, Anh T. Ngo
Abstract: Lithium zirconium chlorides (LZCs) present a promising class of cost-effective solid electrolyte for next-generation all-solid-state batteries. The unique crystal structure of LZCs plays a crucial role in facilitating lithium-ion mobility, which is central to their electrochemical performance. To understand the underlying mechanism governing ion transport, we employed deep learning-accelerated molecular dynamics simulation on Li2ZrCl6 (trigonal {\alpha}- and monoclinic \b{eta}-LZC), focusing specifically on the zirconium coordination environment. Our results reveal that disordered {\alpha}-LZC exhibits the highest ionic conductivity, while \b{eta}-LZC demonstrates significantly lower conductivity, closely aligning with experimental findings. Detailed analysis shows substantial differences in lithium-ion dynamics: {\alpha}-LZC phases display pronounced collective diffusion driven anisotropic interlayer transport, whereas lithium mobility in \b{eta}-LZC is largely determined by isotropic translations and individual diffusion dominated by intralayer migration. Across all phases, lithium migration proceeds via site-to-site hopping mechanism, where variations in site residence times critically impact the overall ionic conductivity. Local structure organizations analysis confirms that particular zirconium arrangements in LZC phases create varied ion channel energy barriers, influencing dynamic behaviors: In {\alpha}-LZC phases, the interlayer hopping barrier is lower than the intralayer barrier, facilitating faster ion transport. Disordered {\alpha}-LZC, with its loose zirconium arrangement, presents the lowest energy barrier, enhancing conductivity. Conversely, \b{eta}-LZC features a higher overall barrier, with intralayer hopping favored over interlayer, resulting in slower ion migration.

Title: Pressure-induced decomposition of Bi14WO24
Authors: E. Karaca, D. Santamaria-Perez, A. Otero-de-la-Roza, R. Oliva, K.S. Rao, S.N. Achary, C. Popescu, D. Errandonea
Abstract: We present a study of the high-pressure behaviour Bi14WO24, a high oxide ion conductor member of the Bi2O3-WO3 binary system. The tetragonal polymorph of Bi14WO24 was studied under high-pressure conditions using synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction. It was found that in contrast to isostructural Bi14CrO24 and Bi14MoO24 which experience a phase transition around 5 GPa, in our study Bi14WO24 undergoes an irreversible chemical decomposition into Bi2O3 and WO3 at 2.85(5) GPa. The pressure dependence of the unit-cell parameters of Bi14WO24 was also determined, and hence the linear compressibility along different axes and room-temperature pressure-volume equation of state were derived. Bulk modulus of tetragonal Bi14WO24 was found to be 49.8(2.6) GPa, and the linear compressibility of the two crystallographic axes, \k{appa}a and \k{appa}c were 6.94(2) 10-3 GPa-1 and = 3.73(1) 10-3 GPa-1, respectively. The pressure induced decomposition can be attributed to the favourable increasing density of the system to accommodate the pressure induced stress.

Title: Impact of Au Ion Implantation on 2D $Cr_2Ge_2Te_6$ for Spintronics
Authors: Gurupada Ghorai, Kalyan Ghosh, Pratap K. Sahoo
Abstract: Advancements in 2D magnetic materials highlight their potential in semiconductors, magnetism, and spintronics, particularly in tuning magnetic properties for spintronic applications. This study investigates the impact of low-energy (30 KeV) Au ion implantation on 2D layered exfoliated $Cr_2Ge_2Te_6$ flakes prepared on Si/SiO$_2$ substrates using the Scotch tape method. Five different ion doses (5$\times10^{13}$, 1$\times10^{14}$, 5$\times10^{14}$, 1$\times10^{15}$, and 2.5$\times10^{15}$ ions/cm$^2$) were used to modify the morphology, composition, structural, and vibrational properties of the samples. The implantation introduces significant changes in morphology and magnetic behavior, leading to an increase in Curie temperature and an attribution from superexchange to double exchange interactions. The reduced exchange energy gaps and modified magnetic moments attribute to Au ions intercalation in $Cr_2Ge_2Te_6$ underscore the potential of ions implantation to tune the magnetic properties of 2D materials for advanced spintronic applications.

Title: Hyperbolic tiling neighborhoods in O(1) time
Authors: Yanick Thurn, Manuel Schrauth, Johanna Erdmenger
Abstract: Tilings of the hyperbolic plane are of significant interest among many branches of mathematics, physics and computer science. Yet, their construction remains a non-trivial task. Current approaches primarily use tree-based recursive algorithms, which are fundamentally limited: they do not readily yield the neighborhood graph representing cell adjacencies, which is however required for many applications. We introduce a novel approach that allows to build hyperbolic tilings and their associated graph structure simultaneously, using only combinatoric rules without requiring an explicit coordinate representation. This allows to generate arbitrarily large, exact hyperbolic graphs, with an algorithmic complexity that does not depend on the lattice size. We provide an easy-to-use implementation which substantially outperforms existing methods, hence rendering ultra large-scale numerical simulations on these geometric structures accessible for the scientific community.

Title: Universal quantum phase classification on quantum computers from machine learning
Authors: Weicheng Ye, Shuwei Liu, Shiyu Zhou, Yijian Zou
Abstract: The classification of quantum phases of matter remains a fundamental challenge in condensed matter physics. We present a novel framework that combines shadow tomography with modern time-series machine learning models to enable efficient and practical quantum phase classification. Our approach leverages the definition of quantum phases based on connectivity through finite-depth local unitary circuits, generating abundant training data by applying Haar random evolution to representative quantum states for a given phase. In this way, the training data can be efficiently obtained from a quantum simulator. Additionally, we demonstrate that advanced time-series models can be used to process the training data and achieve universal quantum phase classification that does not rely on local order parameters. To validate the universality and versatility of our method, we test the model against one-dimensional quantum spin chains such as the Ising model and the axial next-nearest-neighbor Ising (ANNNI) model, showing excellent agreement with known phase boundaries.

Title: Generalization of anomaly formula for time reversal symmetry in (2+1)D abelian bosonic TQFTs
Authors: Ippo Orii
Abstract: We study time-reversal symmetry in (2+1)-dimensional abelian bosonic topological phases. Z_2 x Z_2 classifies the time-reversal anomalies in such systems symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases in (3+1) dimensions and can be diagnosed via partition functions on manifolds such as RP^4 and CP^2. These partition functions are related by an anomaly formula of the form Z(RP^4) * Z(CP^2) = theta_M, where theta_M is the Dehn twist phase associated with the crosscap state. Meanwhile, the existence of gapped boundaries is constrained by so-called higher central charges, denoted xi_n, which serve as computable invariants encoding obstruction data. Motivated by the known relation Z(CP^2) = xi_1, we propose a generalization of the anomaly formula involving both the higher central charges xi_n and a new time-reversal invariant eta_n. By introducing a distinguished subset M^n of the set A of anyons, we establish the relation eta_n * xi_n = (sum of theta(a)^n over a in M^n) divided by its absolute value. This generalizes the known anomaly formula. We analyze the algebraic structure of the subset M^n, derive consistency relations it satisfies, and clarify its connection to the original anomaly formula.

Title: Optimal Qubit Purification and Unitary Schur Sampling via Random SWAP Tests
Authors: Shrigyan Brahmachari, Austin Hulse, Henry D. Pfister, Iman Marvian
Abstract: The goal of qubit purification is to combine multiple noisy copies of an unknown pure quantum state to obtain one or more copies that are closer to the pure state. We show that a simple protocol based solely on random SWAP tests achieves the same fidelity as the Schur transform, which is optimal. This protocol relies only on elementary two-qubit SWAP tests, which project a pair of qubits onto the singlet or triplet subspaces, to identify and isolate singlet pairs, and then proceeds with the remaining qubits. For a system of $n$ qubits, we show that after approximately $T \approx n \ln n$ random SWAP tests, a sharp transition occurs: the probability of detecting any new singlet decreases exponentially with $T$. Similarly, the fidelity of each remaining qubit approaches the optimal value given by the Schur transform, up to an error that is exponentially small in $T$. More broadly, this protocol achieves what is known as weak Schur sampling and unitary Schur sampling with error $\epsilon$, after only $2n \ln(n \epsilon^{-1})$ SWAP tests. That is, it provides a lossless method for extracting any information invariant under permutations of qubits, making it a powerful subroutine for tasks such as quantum state tomography and metrology.

Title: Information Propagation in Predator-Prey Dynamics of Turbulent Plasma
Authors: Tomohiro Tanogami, Makoto Sasaki, Tatsuya Kobayashi
Abstract: Magnetically confined fusion plasmas exhibit predator-prey-like cyclic oscillations through the self-regulating interaction between drift-wave turbulence and zonal flow. To elucidate the detailed mechanism and causality underlying this phenomenon, we construct a simple stochastic predator-prey model that incorporates intrinsic fluctuations and analyze its statistical properties from an information-theoretic perspective. We first show that the model exhibits persistent fluctuating cyclic oscillations called quasi-cycles due to amplification of intrinsic noise. This result suggests the possibility that the previously observed periodic oscillations in a toroidal plasma are not limit cycles but quasi-cycles, and that such quasi-cycles may be widely observed under various conditions. For this model, we further prove that information of zonal flow is propagated to turbulence. This information-theoretic analysis may provide a theoretical basis for regulating turbulence by controlling zonal flow.

Title: High Purcell enhancement in all-TMDC nanobeam resonator designs with optically active monolayers for nanolasers
Authors: Felix Binkowski, Aris Koulas-Simos, Fridtjof Betz, Matthias Plock, Ivan Sekulic, Phillip Manley, Martin Hammerschmidt, Philipp-Immanuel Schneider, Lin Zschiedrich, Battulga Munkhbat, Stephan Reitzenstein, Sven Burger
Abstract: We propose a nanobeam resonator incorporating an optically active monolayer, designed to achieve a high Purcell enhancement. The resonator is fully composed of transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) materials and intended to operate as a high-beta-factor nanolaser. A theoretical framework that models and optimizes the Purcell enhancement associated with the emission from atomically thin layers is developed. This framework is based on a resonance expansion, enabling spectral resolution of physical quantities governed by high-Q resonances. The numerical optimization of the resonator leads to the presence of a high-Q resonance supporting a strong electric field confinement in the monolayer to maximize the modal gain.

Title: Krylov exponents and power spectra for maximal quantum chaos: an EFT approach
Authors: Saskia Demulder, Maria Knysh, Andrew Rolph
Abstract: We examine the effective field theory (EFT) of maximal chaos through the lens of Krylov complexity and the Universal Operator Growth Hypothesis. We test the relationship between two measures of quantum chaos: out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs) and Krylov complexity. In the EFT, a shift symmetry of the hydrodynamic modes enforces the maximal Lyapunov exponent in OTOCs, $\lambda_L = 2\pi T$, while simultaneously constraining thermal two-point autocorrelators. We solve these constraints on the autocorrelator, and calculate the Lanczos coefficients and Krylov exponents for several examples, finding both $\lambda_K = \lambda_L$ and $\lambda_K = \lambda_L/2$. This demonstrates that, within the EFT, the shift symmetry alone is insufficient to enforce maximal Krylov exponents even when the Lyapunov exponent is maximal. In particular, this result suggests a tension with the conjectured bound $\lambda_L \leq \lambda_K \leq 2\pi T$. Finally, we identify autocorrelator solutions whose power spectra closely resemble the so-called thermal product formula seen in holographic systems.

Title: The Anisotropic Interface Continuum Solvation Model and the Finite-Element Anisotropic Poisson Solver
Authors: Ziwei Chai, Sandra Luber
Abstract: We propose an anisotropic interfacial continuum solvation (AICS) model to simulate the distinct in-plane and out-of-plane dielectric constants of liquids near solid-liquid interfaces and their spatial variations along the surface normal direction. In low-electron-density regions, each dielectric function in the diagonal components of a dielectric tensor varies monotonically with distance from the solid surface along the surface normal; in high-electron-density regions near the surface, each dielectric function adopts the electron-density-based formulation proposed by Andreussi et al. (J. Chem. Phys. 136, 064102 (2012)) The resulting dielectric tensor is continuously differentiable with respect to both electron density and spatial coordinates. We derived analytical expressions for electrostatic contributions to the KS potential and forces, and implemented AICS, including these analytical derivatives, into CP2K. To solve the anisotropic Poisson equations, we developed a parallel finite-element anisotropic Poisson solver (FEAPS) based on the FEniCSx platform and its interface with CP2K. Analytical forces were validated against finite-difference calculations, while electrostatic potentials computed under vacuum and isotropic solvent conditions using AICS and FEAPS were benchmarked against standard vacuum DFT and SCCS results, respectively. In the anisotropic solvent environment characterized by the enhanced in-plane and reduced out-of-plane dielectric functions near the Ag(111) surface, we calculated the resulting work functions and electrostatic potentials, and optimized the adsorption geometry for OH. Compared to the isotropic case, we observed more pronounced work function shifts and spatially modulated electrostatic profiles across different charge states. Our results also showed that OH tilted more towards the plane parallel to the surface under the anisotropic dielectric conditions.

Title: Quench dynamics of entanglement entropy under projective charge measurements: the free fermion case
Authors: Riccardo Travaglino, Colin Rylands, Pasquale Calabrese
Abstract: We consider the effect of projective measurements on the quench dynamics of the bipartite entanglement entropy in one dimensional free fermionic systems. In our protocol, we consider projective measurements of a $U(1)$ conserved charge, the particle number, on some large subsystem, and study the entanglement entropies between the same subsystem and its complement. We compare the dynamics emanating from two classes of initial states, one which is an eigenstate of the charge and another which is not. Moreover, we consider the effects of a single measurement as well as multiple which are periodically performed. Using the quasiparticle picture, we obtain analytic expressions for the behaviour of the entanglement which admit a transparent physical interpretation. In general, we find that measurements introduce two distinct types of corrections to the entanglement, which can be interpreted separately as classical and quantum contributions. The classical contribution is independent of the measurement outcome and scales logarithmically with variance of the charge distribution. In contrast, the quantum contribution depends on the specific measurement outcome and can be significant for individual realizations; however, it becomes negligible when averaged over all possible outcomes. Our expressions reduce to previously known results for symmetry resolved entanglement and full counting statistics in some relevant limits, and are confirmed by an exact calculation performed on the Néel initial state.

Title: Mind the Gap: From Resolving Theoretical Foundations of Chiral(ity)-Induced Spin Selectivity to Pioneering Implementations in Quantum Sensing
Authors: Yan Xi Foo, Aisha Kermiche, Farhan T. Chowdhury, Clarice D. Aiello, Luke D. Smith
Abstract: The chiral(ity)-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect, where electrons passing through a chiral medium acquire significant spin-polarization at ambient temperatures, has been widely observed experimentally, yet its theoretical foundations remain actively debated. Open questions persist regarding whether CISS originates from helical geometry or more general chirality, and whether a unified mechanism can account for phenomena across solid-state and soft-matter systems, mesoscopic films, and single molecules. Clarifying the interrelations between existing models is essential to determine if a universal picture of CISS can be found or whether system-specific models are required, and if so, where their common starting point should lie for a workable classification of CISS manifestations. Despite this theoretical fragmentation, recent studies of CISS effects in electron transfer systems, magnetic field sensitivity and coherence of radical pair reactions, polarized electroluminescence in chiral hybrid perovskites, DNA-based biosensors, and enantioselective detection, highlight its broad conceptual relevance and potential applications in spintronics, molecular sensors, and quantum information processing. In this review, we help bridge the gap between theory, experiment, and implementation, with a particular focus on prospects for quantum sensing and metrology. We outline fundamental frameworks of CISS, clarifying what constitutes the `chiral', the `induced', and the `spin-selectivity' that makes up CISS, before going on to survey key model realizations and their assumptions. We examine some of the emerging quantum sensing applications and assess the model-specific implications, in particular exemplifying these in the context of spin-correlated radical pairs, which offer a promising, tunable, and biomimetic platform for emerging molecular quantum technologies.

Title: Partial projected ensembles and spatiotemporal structure of information scrambling
Authors: Saptarshi Mandal, Pieter W. Claeys, Sthitadhi Roy
Abstract: Thermalisation and information scrambling in out-of-equilibrium quantum many-body systems are deeply intertwined: local subsystems dynamically approach thermal density matrices while their entropies track information spreading. Projected ensembles--ensembles of pure states conditioned on measurement outcomes of complementary subsystems--provide higher-order probes of thermalisation, converging at late times to universal maximum-entropy ensembles. In this work, we introduce the partial projected ensemble (PPE) as a framework to study how the spatiotemporal structure of scrambling is imprinted on projected ensembles. The PPE consists of an ensemble of mixed states induced on a subsystem by measurements on a spatially separated part of its complement, tracing out the remainder, naturally capturing scenarios involving discarded outcomes or noise-induced losses. We show that statistical fluctuations of the PPE faithfully track the causal lightcone of information spreading, revealing how scrambling dynamics are encoded in ensemble structure. In addition, we demonstrate that the probabilities of bit-string probabilities (PoPs) associated with the PPE exhibit distinct dynamical regimes and provide an experimentally accessible probe of scrambling. Both PPE fluctuations and PoPs display exponential sensitivity to the size of the discarded region, reflecting exponential degradation of quantum correlations under erasure. We substantiate these findings using the non-integrable kicked Ising chain, combining numerics in the ergodic regime with exact results at its self-dual point. We extend our analysis to a many-body localised (MBL) regime numerically, along with analytic results for the $\ell$-bit model. The linear and logarithmic lightcones characteristic of ergodic and MBL regimes emerge naturally from PPE dynamics, establishing it as a powerful tool for probing scrambling and deep thermalisation.

Title: Odd-parity effect and scale-dependent viscosity in atomic quantum gases
Authors: Jeff Maki, Ulf Gran, Johannes Hofmann
Abstract: Two-dimensional electron gases are predicted to possess an anomalous ''tomographic'' transport regime that is marked by an odd-even effect in the relaxation times, with odd-parity deformations of the Fermi surface becoming long-lived in comparison to even-parity ones. In this work, we establish that neutral two-component atomic Fermi gases also exhibit this tomographic effect. By diagonalizing the Fermi liquid collision integral, we identify odd-parity modes with anomalously long lifetimes below temperatures $T\leq 0.15T_F$, which is within reach of cold atom experiments. Furthermore, in contrast to electron gases, we find that the odd-even effect in neutral gases is widely tuneable with interactions along the BCS-BEC crossover and is suppressed on the BEC side. We propose as an experimental signature of the odd-even effect the damping rate of quadrupole oscillations, which is anomalously enhanced due to the presence of long-lived odd-parity modes. Our findings suggest that the dynamics of two-dimensional Fermi gases is richer than previously thought and should include additional long-lived modes.

Title: Quantum Enhancement of Thermalization
Authors: Yulong Qiao, Frank Großmann, Peter Schlagheck, Gabriel M. Lando
Abstract: Equilibrium properties of many-body systems with a large number of degrees of freedom are generally expected to be described by statistical mechanics. Such expectations are closely tied to the observation of thermalization, as manifested through equipartition in time-dependent observables, which takes place both in quantum and classical systems but may look very different in comparison. By studying the dynamics of individual lattice site populations in ultracold bosonic gases, we show that the process of relaxation toward equilibrium in a quantum system can be orders of magnitude faster than in its classical counterpart. Classical chaos quantifiers reveal that this is due to a wave packet in a quantum system being able to escape regions of inefficient classical transport by a mechanism akin to tunneling. Since the presented phenomenon takes place in a broad parameter range and persists in weakly disordered systems, we expect that it occurs in a variety of many-body systems and is amenable to direct experimental verification in state-of-the-art quantum simulation platforms.

Title: Recombination of localized quasiparticles in disordered superconductors
Authors: Steven A. H. de Rooij, Remko Fermin, Kevin Kouwenhoven, Tonny Coppens, Vignesh Murugesan, David J. Thoen, Jan Aarts, Jochem J. A. Baselmans, Pieter J. de Visser
Abstract: Disordered superconductors offer new impedance regimes for quantum circuits, enable a pathway to protected qubits, and can improve superconducting detectors due to their high kinetic inductance and sheet resistance. The performance of these devices can be limited, however, by quasiparticles - the fundamental excitations of a superconductor. While experiments have shown that disorder affects the relaxation of quasiparticles drastically, the microscopic mechanisms are still not understood. We address this issue by measuring quasiparticle relaxation in a disordered $\beta$-Ta film, which we pattern as the inductor of a microwave resonator. We observe that quasiparticle recombination is governed by the phonon scattering time, which is faster than conventional recombination in ordered superconductors. We interpret the results as recombination of localized quasiparticles, induced by disorder, which first delocalize via phonon absorption. We analyze quasiparticle relaxation measurements on superconductors with different degrees of disorder and conclude that this phenomenon is inherent to disordered superconductors.

Title: Scaling of diffusion constants in perturbed easy-axis Heisenberg spin chains
Authors: Markus Kraft, Mariel Kempa, Jiaozi Wang, Sourav Nandy, Robin Steinigeweg
Abstract: Understanding the physics of the integrable spin-1/2 XXZ chain has witnessed substantial progress, due to the development and application of sophisticated analytical and numerical techniques. In particular, infinite-temperature magnetization transport has turned out to range from ballistic, over superdiffusive, to diffusive behavior in different parameter regimes of the anisotropy. Since integrability is rather the exception than the rule, a crucial question is the change of transport under integrability-breaking perturbations. This question includes the stability of superdiffusion at the isotropic point and the change of diffusion constants in the easy-axis regime. In our work, we study this change of diffusion constants by a variety of methods and cover both, linear response theory in the closed system and the Lindblad equation in the open system, where we throughout focus on periodic boundary conditions. In the closed system, we compare results from the recursion method to calculations for finite systems and find evidence for a continuous change of diffusion constants over the full range of perturbation strengths. In the open system weakly coupled to baths, we find diffusion constants in quantitative agreement with the ones in the closed system in a range of nonweak perturbations, but disagreement in the limit of weak perturbations. Using a simple model in this limit, we point out the possibility of a diverging diffusion constant in such an open system.

Title: An EFT for anisotropic anti-ferromagnets: gapped Goldstones, pseudo-Goldstones, and phase transitions
Authors: Pier Giuseppe Catinari, Angelo Esposito, Shashin Pavaskar
Abstract: We build and discuss a low energy effective field theory for anisotropic anti-ferromagnets in presence of an external magnetic field. Such an effective theory is simple yet rich, and features a number of phenomena such as the appearance of gapped Goldstones, pseudo-Goldstones and a "spin flop" phase transition, all within the regime of validity of the theory. We also discuss in detail, the quantization procedure of the free theory in the presence of a magnetic field, which is made non-trivial by the presence of a single-time derivative term. This class of materials make a precious test field for exotic phenomena in quantum field theory. Moreover, we explicitly perform the matching of the effective theory to the short distance theory of a specific anti-ferromagnet, namely, nickel oxide. The latter is particularly relevant in light of recent proposals of employing this material towards the hunt for light dark matter. As a byproduct of our study, we also re-evaluate the role played by discrete symmetries in magnetic materials, presenting it in a way that is completely consistent with the proper low energy EFT ideology.

Title: Enhancement of the superconducting transition temperature due to multiband effect in the topological nodal-line semimetal Pb$_{1-x}$Sn$_{x}$TaSe$_{2}$
Authors: K. Kumarasinghe, A. Rahman, M. Tomlinson, D. Le, F. Joshua, L. Zhai, Y. Nakajima
Abstract: We report a systematic study of the normal-state and superconducting properties of single crystal Pb$_{1-x}$Sn$_{x}$TaSe$_{2}$ $(0\leq x \leq 0.23)$. Sn doping enhances the superconducting temperature $T_{c}$ up to 5.1 K while also significantly increasing impurity scattering in the crystals. For $x=0$ and 0.018, the specific heat jump at $T_{c}$ exceeds the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) weak-coupling value of 1.43, indicating the realization of strong-coupling superconductivity in undoped and slightly Sn-doped PbTaSe$_{2}$. Substituting Pb with more Sn lowers the specific heat jump at $T_{c}$ below the BCS value of 1.43, which cannot be explained by a single-gap model. Rather, the observed specific heat data of moderately Sn-doped PbTaSe$_{2}$ ($x= 0.08$ and 0.15) are reproduced by a two-gap model. Our density functional theory calculations suggest that three-dimensional Fermi pockets appear due to a reduction of the spin-orbit gap with Sn doping, and the multiband effect arising from these emergent Fermi pockets enhances the effective electron-phonon coupling strength, leading to the increase in $T_{c}$ of Pb$_{1-x}$Sn$_{x}$TaSe$_{2}$.

Title: Exploiting $\vartheta -$functions for the identification of topological materials
Authors: Emanuele Maggio
Abstract: An exact analytical expression is derived for Bloch states in three dimensions, based on the only assumption that the electronic wavefunction can be expanded in terms of Gaussian type orbitals. The resulting expression features multidimensional $\vartheta -$functions (and their derivatives) on which the action of discrete space group symmetries is evaluated analytically and contrasted against the symmetry transformations proper of modular forms. We integrate group theoretical arguments with continuity requirements of the Bloch states to produce a viable algorithm for the determination of band inversions in materials with a non-trivial topological electronic band structure; the proposed methodology is then applied to two simplified materials models.

Title: Band Structure and Pairing Nature of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ Thin Film at Ambient Pressure
Authors: Zhi-Yan Shao, Yu-Bo Liu, Min Liu, Fan Yang
Abstract: Recently, evidences of superconductivity (SC) with onset $T_c$ above the McMillan limit have been detected in the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ ultrathin film grown on the LaSrAlO$_4$ substrate at ambient pressure. This progress opens a new era in the field of the nickelate superconductors. Here we perform a density-functional-theory (DFT) based calculation for the band structure of this material. The obtained DFT+$U$ band structure has the feature that the bonding $d_{z^2}$ band crosses the Fermi level, forming the hole pocket $\gamma$, consistent with the angle-resolved photoemission spectrum (ARPES). Taking the low-energy Ni-$(3d_{z^2},3d_{x^2-y^2})$ orbitals placed on the tetragonal lattice structure, we construct a 2D bilayer four-band tight-binding model which well captures the main features of the DFT+$U$ band structure. Then considering the multi-orbital Hubbard interaction, we adopt the random-phase approximation (RPA) approach to investigate the pairing nature. The obtained pairing symmetry is $s^{\pm}$ or $d_{xy}$ for the hole-doping level $\delta$ below or above 0.12, induced by the different Fermi surface nesting situations. For the realistic $\delta=0.21$ measured by the ARPES, our RPA calculations obtain the next-nearest-neighbor pairing $d_{xy}$-wave SC dominated by the $d_{z^2}$ orbital, consistent with the experimental observation that the $T_c$ enhances with the shrinking of the in-plane lattice constants. This pairing state is induced by the nesting between the different patches within the $\gamma$ pocket. Our results appeal for experimental verifications.

Title: Bipartite Fluctuations and Charge Fractionalization in Quantum Wires
Authors: Magali Korolev, Karyn Le Hur
Abstract: We introduce a quantum information method for measuring fractional charges in ballistic quantum wires generalizing bipartite fluctuations to the chiral quasiparticles in Luttinger liquids, i.e. adding charge and current fluctuations in a region of the wire. Bipartite fluctuations at equilibrium are characterized through a logarithmic scaling with distance encoding the entangled nature of these fractional charges in one-dimensional (1D) fluids. This approach clarifies the physical meaning of the dephasing factor of electronic interferences in a ballistic ring geometry at zero temperature, as a result of charge fractionalization. We formulate an analogy towards ground-state energetics. We show how bipartite current fluctuations represent a useful tool to locate quantum phase transitions associated to Mott physics. We address a spin chain equivalence and verify the fractional charges through an algorithm such as Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG). Adding a potential difference between the two sides (parties) of the wire, bipartite fluctuations can detect a bound state localized at the interface through the Jackiw-Rebbi model coexisting with fractional charges.

Title: Epitaxial growth and transport properties of a metallic altermagnet CrSb on a GaAs (001) substrate
Authors: Seiji Aota, Masaaki Tanaka
Abstract: A newly identified class of magnetic materials called altermagnets has attracted much attention due to the practical properties of spin-splitting bands akin to ferromagnets and small compensated magnetization akin to antiferromagnets. These features make them promising candidates for applications in spintronics devices. Among candidate materials, CrSb is promising because of its high ordering temperature (~705 K) and large spin-splitting energy; however, it is predicted that tuning the Néel vector requires additional symmetry breaking or a change in the easy magnetization axis. While applying epitaxial strain can modulate the symmetry, the selection of substrates with closely matched lattice constants for heteroepitaxial growth is limited for altermagnets, which generally have low crystal symmetry. Therefore, exploring the heteroepitaxial growth of altermagnet thin films on well-established, dissimilar crystal systems is valuable. (001)-oriented III-V semiconductors, which share group-V elements with the overgrown CrSb, offer an ideal platform because they are expected to have material compatibility with stable interfaces, as well as tunability of the buffer layer's bandgap and lattice constant by varying the atomic composition of their group-III and group-V atoms. In this study, we have achieved the molecular beam epitaxial growth of a CrSb ($\bar{1}10$) thin film on a GaAs (001) substrate by inserting thin FeSb ($\bar{1}10$) / AlAs (001) buffer layers. The in-plane epitaxial relationship is found to be CrSb [110] $\|$ GaAs [110] and CrSb [001] $\|$ GaAs [$\bar{1}10$], and epitaxial strain is also confirmed. We also characterized the magneto-transport properties of the grown CrSb thin film. Although the obtained conductivity tensors are mainly explained by a two-carrier model, not by an anomalous Hall effect, this model reveals the presence of high-mobility electron and hole carriers.

Title: Active Solids: Topological Defect Self-Propulsion Without Flow
Authors: Fridtjof Brauns, Myles O'Leary, Arthur Hernandez, Mark J. Bowick, M. Cristina Marchetti
Abstract: The self-propulsion of +1/2 topological defects is a hallmark of active nematic fluids, where the defects are advected by the flow field they themselves generate. In this paper we propose a minimal model for defect self-propulsion in a nematic active solid: a linear elastic medium with an embedded nematic texture that generates active stress and associated elastic strains. We show that such coupling gives rise to self-propelled +1/2 defects that move relative to the elastic medium by local remodeling of the nematic texture without advection. This mechanism is fundamentally different from the fluid case and can lead to unbinding of defect pairs and stabilization of +1 defects. Our findings might help explain how orientational order, of, for example, muscle fibers, is reconfigured during morphogenesis in solid-like tissues. The proposed mechanism may, for instance, control motility and merging of +1/2 defects, which play a crucial role in setting up the body axis during Hydra regeneration.

Title: Two and three-state quantum heat engines with stochastic resetting
Authors: Ashutosh Kumar, Sourabh Lahiri, Trilochan Bagarti, Subhashish Banerjee
Abstract: Quantum heat engines have undergone extensive studies over the last two decades. Simultaneously, the studies of the applications of stochastic resetting in various fields are on the rise. We explore the effect of stochastic resetting on the dynamics of a two-level and a three-level quantum heat engine. The extracted work is shown to increase with the resetting rate. The effective efficiency that takes into account the work done due to resetting remains constant. However, if the work done due to resetting is ignored, then the system can incorrectly imply a different behaviour, including the false inference that it is not working as an engine at all. The efficient power is observed to increase beyond that obtained in the absence of resetting, and is shown to be higher for a three-level engine.

Title: Rayleigh-Taylor, Kelvin-Helmholtz and immiscible to miscible quenching instabilities in binary Bose-Einstein condensates
Authors: R. Kishor Kumar, S. Sabari, Arnaldo Gammal, Lauro Tomio
Abstract: We investigate three kinds of instabilities in binary immiscible homogeneous Bose-Einstein condensate, considering rubidium isotopes $^{85}$Rb and $^{87}$Rb confined in two-dimensional circular box. Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) and Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability types are studied under strong perturbations. Without external perturbation, instabilities are also probed by immiscible to miscible quenching transition (IMQT), under two different initial configurations. Our numerical simulations show that all such instability dynamics are dominated by large vortex productions and sound-wave (phonon) propagations. For long-term propagation, vortex dynamics become dominant over sound waves in the KH instability, while sound wave excitations predominate in the other cases. For all the dynamical simulations, the emergence of possible scaling laws are investigated for the compressible and incompressible parts of the kinetic energy spectra, in terms of the wave number $k$. The corresponding results are compared with the classical Kolmogorov scalings, $k^{-5/3}$ and $k^{-3}$, for turbulence, which are observed in the kinetic energy spectra at some specific time intervals. Deviating from the classical scaling, a kind of ``Bottleneck effect" is noticed in the IMQT spectra.

Title: Pseudo-giant number fluctuations and nematic order in microswimmer suspensions
Authors: Ismail El Korde, Dóra Bárdfalvy, Jason M. Lewis, Alexander Morozov, Cesare Nardini, Joakim Stenhammar
Abstract: Giant number fluctuations (GNFs), whereby the standard deviation $\Delta N$ in the local number of particles $\langle N \rangle$ grows faster than $\sqrt{\langle N \rangle}$, are a hallmark property of dry active matter systems with orientational order, such as a collection of granular particles on a vibrated plate. This contrasts with momentum-conserving ("wet") active matter systems, such as suspensions of swimming bacteria, where no theoretical prediction of GNFs exist, although numerous experimental observations of such enhanced fluctuations have been reported. In this Letter, we numerically confirm the emergence of super-Gaussian number fluctuations in a 3-dimensional suspension of pusher microswimmers undergoing a transition to collective motion. These fluctuations emerge sharply above the transition, but only for sufficiently large values of the bacterial persistence length $\ell_p = v_s / \lambda$, where $v_s$ is the bacterial swimming speed and $\lambda$ the tumbling rate. Crucially, these "pseudo-GNFs" differ from true GNFs, as they only occur on length scales shorter than the typical size $\xi$ of nematic patches in the collective motion state, which is in turn proportional to the single-swimmer persistence length $\ell_p$. Our results thus suggest that observations of enhanced density fluctuations in biological active matter systems actually represent transient effects that decay away beyond mesoscopic length scales, and raises the question to what extent "true" GNFs with universal properties can exist in the presence of fluid flows.

Title: BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4$)$_2$: Strong Kitaev, After All
Authors: Pavel A. Maksimov, Shengtao Jiang, L. P. Regnault, A. L. Chernyshev
Abstract: The inelastic neutron scattering results and their analysis unequivocally point to a dominant Kitaev interaction in the honeycomb-lattice cobaltate BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4$)$_2$. Our anisotropic-exchange model closely describes $all$ available neutron scattering data in the material's field-polarized phase. The density-matrix renormalization group results for our model are in close accord with the unusual double-zigzag magnetic order and the low in-plane saturation field of BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4$)$_2$.

Title: Single-Particle Dispersion and Density of States of the Half-Filled 2D Hubbard Model
Authors: Gabe Schumm, Shiwei Zhang, Anders W. Sandvik
Abstract: Implementing an improved method for analytic continuation and working with imaginary-time correlation functions computed using quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we resolve the single-particle dispersion relation and the density of states (DOS) of the two-dimensional Hubbard model at half-filling. At intermediate interactions of $U/t = 4,6$, we find quadratic dispersion around the gap minimum at wave-vectors $\mathbf{k} = (\pm \pi/2, \pm \pi/2)$ (the $\Sigma$ points). We find saddle points at $\mathbf{k} = (\pm \pi,0),(0,\pm \pi)$ (the X points) where the dispersion is approximately quartic, leading to a sharp DOS maximum above the almost flat ledge arising from the states close to $\Sigma$. The fraction of quasiparticle states within the ledge is $n_{\rm ledge} \approx 0.15$. Upon doping away from half-filling, within the rigid-band approximation, these results support Fermi pockets around the $\Sigma$ points, with states around the X points becoming filled only at doping fractions $x \ge n_{\rm ledge}$. The high density of states away from the $\Sigma$ gap edge may be an important clue for a finite minimum doping level for superconductivity and other instabilities of doped Mott insulators.

Title: Quantum hydrodynamics of a polariton fluid: pure energy relaxation terms
Authors: D. A. Saltykova, A. V. Yulin, I. A. Shelykh
Abstract: Cavity polaritons, hybrid half-light half-matter excitations in quantum microcavities in the strong-coupling regime demonstrate clear signatures of quantum collective behavior, such as analogues of Bose-Einstein condensate and superfluidity at remarkably high temperatures. The analysis of the formation of these states demands an account of the relaxation processes in the system. Although there are well-established approaches for the description of some of them, such as finite lifetime polariton, an external optical pump, and coupling with an incoherent excitonic reservoir, the treatment of pure energy relaxation in a polariton fluid still remains a puzzle. Here, based on the quantum hydrodynamics approach, we derive the corresponding equations where the energy relaxation term appears naturally. We analyze in detail how it affects the dynamics of polariton droplets and the dispersion of elementary excitations of a uniform polariton condensate. Although we focus on the case of cavity polaritons, our approach can be applied to other cases of bosonic condensates, where the processes of energy relaxation play an important role.

Title: Nonreciprocal Coulomb drag in electron bilayers
Authors: Dmitry Zverevich, Alex Levchenko
Abstract: We propose a mechanism and develop a theory for nonreciprocal Coulomb drag resistance. This effect arises in electron double-layer systems in the presence of an in-plane magnetic field in noncentrosymmetric conductors or in bilayers with spontaneously broken time-reversal symmetry and without Galilean invariance. We demonstrate the significance of this effect by examining the hydrodynamic regime of the electron liquid. The nonreciprocal component of the transresistance is shown to sensitively depend on the intrinsic conductivity, viscosity of the fluid, and the emergent nonreciprocity parameter.

Title: Reentrant localization transition induced by a composite potential
Authors: Xingbo Wei
Abstract: We numerically investigate the localization transition in a one-dimensional system subjected to a composite potential consisting of periodic and quasi-periodic components. For the rational wave vector $\alpha=1/2$, the periodic component reduces to a staggered potential, which has been reported to induce the reentrant localization transition. In addition to $\alpha=1/2$, we find that other rational wave vectors can also lead to the reentrant phenomenon. To investigate the underlying mechanisms of the reentrant localization transition, we vary the parameters of the composite potential and find that the reentrant localization transition is sensitive to the phase factor of the periodic component. By further studying the structure of the periodic component, we confirm that this sensitivity arises from the periodic phase factor modulating the mirror symmetry. Finally, we map out a global phase diagram and reveal that the reentrant localization transition originates from a paradoxical effect: increasing the amplitude of the periodic component enhances localization but simultaneously strengthens the mirror symmetry, which favors the formation of extended states. Our numerical analysis suggests that the interplay between these competing factors drives the reentrant localization transition.

Title: Permeation and thermal desorption model of hydrogen in steel: a sensitivity analysis
Authors: Paolo Emilio Di Nunzio
Abstract: This work presents a fully physical model of the hydrogen diffusion and trapping kinetics in metals, integrating permeation and thermal desorption within a unified framework. Based on the McNabb and Foster approach, it requires only binding energy and number density of trap sites. It correctly reproduces the physics of the system and the results of the analytical solutions of the permeation kinetics. It is also capable of reproducing thermal desorption spectra with considerable accuracy. The sensitivity analysis has elucidated the relationships among the processing conditions and the parameters commonly used to characterize permeation and thermal desorption experiments. An equation empirically derived from the simulation results, expressing the dependence of time lag in desorption on specimen thickness, number density of occupied trap sites, and cathodic concentration, is proposed. In summary, the model represents a valuable tool in supporting the interpretation and rationalization of experiments also from a quantitative viewpoint.

Title: Statistical mechanics of vector Hopfield network near and above saturation
Authors: Flavio Nicoletti, Francesco D'Amico, Matteo Negri
Abstract: We study analytically and numerically a Hopfield fully-connected network with $d$-vector spins. These networks are models of associative memory that generalize the standard Hopfield with Ising spins. We study the equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium properties of the system, considering the system in its retrieval phase $\alpha<\alpha_c$ and beyond. We derive the Replica Symmetric solution for the equilibrium thermodynamics of the system, together with its phase diagram: we find that the retrieval phase of the network shrinks with growing spin dimension, having ultimately a vanishing critical capacity $\alpha_c\propto 1/d$ in the large $d$ limit. As a trade-off, we observe that in the same limit vector Hopfield networks are able to denoise corrupted input patterns in the first step of retrieval dynamics, up to very large capacities $\widetilde{\alpha}\propto d$. We also study the static properties of the system at zero temperature, considering the statistical properties of soft modes of the energy Hessian spectrum. We find that local minima of the energy landscape related to memory states have ungapped spectra with rare soft eigenmodes: these excitations are localized, their measure condensating on the noisiest neurons of the memory state.

Title: Enhancement of superconductivity outside Abrikosov vortex core in a tightly bound Cooper pair superconductor
Authors: Eugene B. Kolomeisky, Mia Kyler, Ishaan U. Patel
Abstract: Abrikosov vortices play a central role in the disruption of superconductivity in type-II superconductors. It is commonly accepted that as one moves away from the vortex's axis of an $s$-wave superconductor, the density of superconductive electrons gradually increases from zero to its bulk value. However, we demonstrate that this behavior is qualitatively altered in the zero-temperature limit provided that the Cooper pairs comprising the superconductive liquid are sufficiently tightly bound. Specifically, outside the vortex core, the density of superconductive electrons reaches a maximum surpassing its bulk value. This phenomenon has electrostatic origins: since normal electrons are absent and there exists a charged ionic background, the spatial variation of the charge density of superconductive electrons violates local neutrality, leading to the generation of an electric field. This electric field shrinks the vortex core and turns the density profile into that with a maximum, ensuring global neutrality. The effect is most pronounced in the limit of strong electrostatic screening, where the field configurations describing the vortex attain a universal form, with the electric field screened over a length scale determined by the London penetration depth.

Title: Scaling Properties of Current Fluctuations in Periodic TASEP
Authors: Anastasiia Trofimova, Lu Xu
Abstract: We study current fluctuations in the Totally Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process (TASEP) on a ring with $N$ sites and $p$ particles. By introducing a deformation parameter $\gamma$, we analyze the tilted operator that governs the statistics of the time-integrated current. Employing the coordinate Bethe ansatz, we derive implicit expressions for the scaled cumulant generating function (SCGF), i.e. the largest eigenvalue, and the spectral gap, both in terms of Bethe roots. Their asymptotic behaviour is characterized by using the geometric structure of Cassini oval. In the thermodynamic limit at fixed particle density, we identify a dynamical phase transition separating fluctuation regimes. For $\gamma>0$, the SCGF exhibits ballistic growth with system size, $\lambda_1 \sim N$. In contrast, for $\gamma<0$, the SCGF converges to $-1$ as $N\to\infty$. This transition is reflected in the spectral gap, which controls the system's relaxation timescale. For $\gamma>0$, the gap closes at polynomial speed, $\Delta \sim N^{-1}$, consistent with rapid relaxation with enhanced current. For $\gamma<0$, the gap vanishes exponentially, $\Delta \sim \exp(-cN)$, signaling metastability with diminished current. Our non-perturbative results provide insights into large deviations and the relaxation dynamics in driven particle systems.

Title: Hydrodynamics without Averaging -- a Hard Rods Study
Authors: Friedrich Hübner
Abstract: On the example of the integrable hard rods model we study the quality of the (generalized) hydrodynamic approximation on a single coarse-grained sample. This is opposed to the traditional approach which averages over an appropriate local equilibrium state. While mathematically more ambiguous, a major advantage of the new approach is that it allows us to disentangle intrinsic diffusion from `diffusion from convection' effects. For the hard rods we find intrinsic diffusion is absent, which agrees with and clarifies recent findings. Interestingly, the results also apply to not locally thermal states, demonstrating that hydrodynamics (in this model) does not require the assumption of local equilibrium.

Title: Absence of nontrivial local conserved quantities in the Hubbard model on the two or higher dimensional hypercubic lattice
Authors: Mahiro Futami
Abstract: By extending the strategy developed by Shiraishi in 2019, we prove that the standard Hubbard model on the $d$-dimensional hypercubic lattice with $d\ge2$ does not admit any nontrivial local conserved quantities. The theorem strongly suggests that the model is non-integrable. To our knowledge, this is the first extension of Shiraishi's proof of the absence of conserved quantities to a fermionic model. Although our proof follows the original strategy of Shiraishi, it is essentially more subtle compared with the proof by Shiraishi and Tasaki of the corresponding theorem for $S=\tfrac12$ quantum spin systems in two or higher dimensions; our proof requires three steps, while that of Shiraishi and Tasaki requires only two steps. It is also necessary to partially determine the conserved quantities of the one-dimensional Hubbard model to accomplish our proof.

Title: Anomalies of global symmetries on the lattice
Authors: Yi-Ting Tu, David M. Long, Dominic V. Else
Abstract: 't Hooft anomalies of global symmetries play a fundamental role in quantum many-body systems and quantum field theory (QFT). In this paper, we make a systematic analysis of lattice anomalies - the analog of 't Hooft anomalies in lattice systems - for which we give a precise definition. Crucially, a lattice anomaly is not a feature of a specific Hamiltonian, but rather is a topological invariant of the symmetry action. The controlled setting of lattice systems allows for a systematic and rigorous treatment of lattice anomalies, shorn of the technical challenges of QFT. We find that lattice anomalies reproduce the expected properties of QFT anomalies in many ways, but also have crucial differences. In particular, lattice anomalies and QFT anomalies are not, contrary to a common expectation, in one-to-one correspondence, and there can be non-trivial anomalies on the lattice that are infrared (IR) trivial: they admit symmetric trivial gapped ground states, and map to trivial QFT anomalies at low energies. Nevertheless, we show that lattice anomalies (including IR-trivial ones) have a number of interesting consequences in their own right, including connections to commuting projector models, phases of many-body localized (MBL) systems, and quantum cellular automata (QCA). We make substantial progress on the classification of lattice anomalies and develop several theoretical tools to characterize their consequences on symmetric Hamiltonians. Our work places symmetries of quantum many-body lattice systems into a unified theoretical framework and may also suggest new perspectives on symmetries in QFT.

Title: Proposal for realizing Heisenberg-type quantum-spin models in Rydberg atom quantum simulators
Authors: Masaya Kunimi, Takafumi Tomita
Abstract: We investigate the magnetic-field dependence of the interaction between two Rydberg atoms, $|nS_{1/2}, m_J\rangle$ and $|(n+1)S_{1/2}, m_J\rangle$. In this setting, the effective spin-1/2 Hamiltonian takes the form of an {\it XXZ} model. We show that the anisotropy parameter of the {\it XXZ} model can be tuned by applying a magnetic field, and in particular, that it changes drastically near the Förster resonance points. Based on this result, we propose experimental realizations of spin-1/2 and spin-1 Heisenberg-type quantum spin models in Rydberg atom quantum simulators, without relying on Floquet engineering. Our results provide guidance for future experiments of Rydberg atom quantum simulators and offer insight into quantum many-body phenomena emerging in the Heisenberg model.

Title: Floquet odd-parity collinear magnets
Authors: Tongshuai Zhu, Di Zhou, Huaiqiang Wang, Jiawei Ruan
Abstract: Altermagnets (AMs), recently discovered unconventional magnets distinct from ferro- and antiferromagnets, have rapidly emerged as a prominent frontier in condensed matter physics. AMs are characterized by alternating collinear magnetic moments with zero net magnetization in real space, and spin splittings with even-parity symmetry in momentum space. However, their counterparts exhibiting odd-parity spin splittings remain largely unexplored. Here, based on symmetry argument, we show that such unconventional odd-parity magnets can be induced from collinear antiferromagnets. Remarkably, using effective model analysis within Floquet-theory framework, we demonstrate that circularly polarized light irradiation of conventional antiferromagnetic lattices induces both $p$- and $f$-wave magnets, realizing novel magnetic states dubbed Floquet odd-parity collinear magnets. Moreover, we also uncover light-induced antiferromagnetic Chern insulating states in the $f$-wave magnets. The proposed Floquet odd-parity magnet is confirmed by first-principles calculations of MnPSe$_{3}$ under circularly polarized light. Our work not only proposes a new class of unconventional magnets, but also opens an avenue for light-induced magnetic phenomena in spintronic applications.

Title: Interaction energies in paranematic colloids
Authors: Dmitry Golovaty, Jamie Taylor, Raghavendra Venkatraman, Arghir Zarnescu
Abstract: We consider a system of colloidal particles embedded in a paranematic -- an isotropic phase of a nematogenic medium above the temperature of the nematic-to-isotropic transition. In this state, the nematic order is induced by the boundary conditions in a narrow band around each particle and it decays exponentially in the bulk. We develop rigorous asymptotics of the linearization of the appropriate variational model that allow us to describe weak far-field interactions between the colloidal particles in two dimensional paranematic suspensions. We demonstrate analytically that decay rates of solutions to the full nonlinear and linear problems are similar and verify numerically that the interactions between the particles in these problems have similar dependence on the distance between the particles. Finally, we perform Monte-Carlo simulations for a system of colloidal particles in a paranematic and describe the statistical properties of this system.

Title: Quantum Sensing with Topological-Paired Bound States
Authors: Tao Zhang, Peng Xu, Jiazhong Hu, Xingze Qiu
Abstract: We present an efficient and robust protocol for quantum-enhanced sensing using a single qubit in the topological waveguide system. Our method relies on the topological-paired bound states, which are localized near the qubit and can be effectively regarded as a two-level system. Through the lens of Bayesian inference theory, we show that the sensitivity can reach the Heisenberg limit across a large field range. Inheriting from the topological robustness of the waveguide, our sensing protocol is robust against local perturbations. Besides, our sensing protocol utilizes a product state as the initial state, which can be easily prepared in experiments. We expect this approach would pave the way toward robust topological quantum sensors based on near-term quantum platforms such as superconducting qubits and Rydberg arrays.

Title: Quantum Groups as Global Symmetries II. Coulomb Gas Construction
Authors: Barak Gabai, Victor Gorbenko, Jiaxin Qiao, Bernardo Zan, Aleksandr Zhabin
Abstract: We study a conformal field theory that arises in the infinite-volume limit of a spin chain with $U_q(sl_2)$ global symmetry. Most operators in the theory are defect-ending operators which allows $U_q(sl_2)$ symmetry transformations to act on them in a consistent way. We use Coulomb gas techniques to construct correlation functions and compute all OPE coefficients of the model, as well as to prove that the properties imposed by the quantum group symmetry are indeed satisfied by the correlation functions. In particular, we treat the non-chiral operators present in the theory. Free boson realization elucidates the origin of the defects attached to the operators. We also comment on the role of quantum group in generalized minimal models.

Title: Stability analysis through folds: An end-loaded elastic with a lever arm
Authors: Siva Prasad Chakri Dhanakoti
Abstract: Many physical systems can be modelled as parameter-dependent variational problems. In numerous cases, multiple equilibria co-exist, requiring the evaluation of their stability, and the monitoring of transitions between them. Generally, the stability characteristics of the equilibria change near folds in the parameter space. The direction of stability changes is embedded in a specific projection of the solutions, known as distinguished bifurcation diagrams. In this article, we identify such projections for variational problems characterized by fixed-free ends -- a class of problems frequently encountered in mechanics. Using these diagrams, we study an Elastica subject to an end load applied through a rigid lever arm. Several instances of snap-back instability are reported, along with their dependence on system parameters through numerical examples. These findings have potential applications in the design of soft robot arms and other actuator designs.

Abstract: As quantum key distribution (QKD) emerges as a robust defense against quantum computer threats, significant advancements have been realized by researchers. A pivotal focus has been the development of protocols that not only simplify hardware implementation like the use of continuous-variable (CV) systems, but also negate the necessity for trusted nodes, as seen with the measurement-device independent (MDI) approach. This paper delves into the integration of these methodologies in the CV-MDI-QKD protocol, offering an in-depth exploration of its evolution, primary characteristics, and the latest advancements in both theory and experiment.

Title: ER=EPR and Strange Metals from Quantum Entanglement: Disorder theory vs quantum gravity
Authors: Sang-Jin Sin, Yi-Li Wang
Abstract: We give an understanding how strange metals arise from the spatially random Yukawa-SYK model based on the wormhole picture and find a parallelism between the disorder theory and quantum gravity. We start from the observation that the Gaussian average over the spatial random coupling gives a wormhole, defined as a mechanism for long range interaction without causal suppression outside the lightcone. We find that the large-$N$ limit equivalence of the quenched and annealed averages provides a field theory version of the ER=EPR. Since the wormhole establishes momentum exchanges over arbitrary distance without causal suppression, it provides a mechanism of the planckian dissipation. It also tells us why SYK-like models describe strongly interacting systems even in the small coupling case. We classify the disorder samples into two classes: I) spatially random coupling with wormholes and no information loss, II) spatially uniform coupling with decoherence.

Title: Asymptotic Exceptional Steady States in Dissipative Dynamics
Authors: Yu-Min Hu, Jan Carl Budich
Abstract: Spectral degeneracies in Liouvillian generators of dissipative dynamics generically occur as exceptional points, where the corresponding non-Hermitian operator becomes non-diagonalizable. Steady states, i.e. zero-modes of Liouvillians, are considered a fundamental exception to this rule since a no-go theorem excludes non-diagonalizable degeneracies there. Here, we demonstrate that the crucial issue of diverging timescales in dissipative state preparation is largely tantamount to an asymptotic approach towards the forbidden scenario of an exceptional steady state in the thermodynamic limit. With case studies ranging from NP-complete satisfiability problems encoded in a quantum master equation to the dissipative preparation of a symmetry protected topological phase, we reveal the close relation between the computational complexity of the problem at hand, and the finite size scaling towards the exceptional steady state, exemplifying both exponential and polynomial scaling. Formally treating the weight $W$ of quantum jumps in the Lindblad master equation as a parameter, we show that exceptional steady states at the physical value $W=1$ may be understood as a critical point hallmarking the onset of dynamical instability.

Title: Self-consistent GW via conservation of spectral moments
Authors: Oliver J. Backhouse, Marcus K. Allen, Charles C. J. Scott, George H. Booth
Abstract: We expand on a recently introduced alternate framework for $GW$ simulation of charged excitations [Scott et. al., J. Chem. Phys., 158, 124102 (2023)], based around the conservation of directly computed spectral moments of the GW self-energy. Featuring a number of desirable formal properties over other implementations, we also detail efficiency improvements and a parallelism strategy, resulting in an implementation with a demonstrable similar scaling to an established Hartree--Fock code, with only an order of magnitude increase in cost. We also detail the applicability of a range of self-consistent $GW$ variants within this framework, including a scheme for full self-consistency of all dynamical variables, whilst avoiding the Matsubara axis or analytic continuation, allowing formal convergence at zero temperature. By investigating a range of self-consistency protocols over the GW100 molecular test set, we find that a little-explored self-consistent variant based around a simpler coupled chemical potential and Fock matrix optimization to be the most accurate self-consistent $GW$ approach. Additionally, we validate recently observed evidence that Tamm--Dancoff based screening approximations within $GW$ lead to higher accuracy than traditional random phase approximation screening over these molecular test cases. Finally, we consider the Chlorophyll A molecule, finding agreement with experiment within the experimental uncertainty, and a description of the full-frequency spectrum of charged excitations.

Title: MOFClassifier: A Machine Learning Approach for Validating Computation-Ready Metal-Organic Frameworks
Authors: Guobin Zhao, Pengyu Zhao, Yongchul G. Chung
Abstract: The computational discovery and design of new crystalline materials, particularly metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), heavily relies on high-quality, computation-ready structural data. However, recent studies have revealed significant error rates within existing MOF databases, posing a critical data problem that hinders efficient high-throughput computational screening. While rule-based algorithms like MOSAEC, MOFChecker, and the Chen and Manz method (Chen-Manz) have been developed to address this, they often suffer from inherent limitations and misclassification of structures. To overcome this challenge, we developed MOFClassifier, a novel machine learning approach built upon a positive-unlabeled crystal graph convolutional neural network (PU-CGCNN) model. MOFClassifier learns intricate patterns from perfect crystal structures to predict a crystal-likeness score (CLscore), effectively classifying MOFs as computation-ready. Our model achieves a ROC value of 0.979 (previous best 0.912) and, importantly, can identify subtle structural and chemical errors that are undetectable by current rule-based methods. By accurately recovering previously misclassified false-negative structures, MOFClassifier reduces the risk of overlooking promising material candidates in large-scale computational screening campaigns. This user-friendly tool is freely available and has been integrated into the prepara-tion workflow for the updated CoRE MOF DB 2025 v1.0, contributing to accelerated computational discovery of MOF materials.

Title: A superinductor in a deep sub-micron integrated circuit
Authors: T. H. Swift, F. Olivieri, G. Aizpurua-Iraola, J. Kirkman, G. M. Noah, M. de Kruijf, F. E. von Horstig, A. Gomez-Saiz, J. J. L. Morton, M. F. Gonzalez-Zalba
Abstract: Superinductors are circuit elements characterised by an intrinsic impedance in excess of the superconducting resistance quantum ($R_\text{Q}\approx6.45~$k$\Omega$), with applications from metrology and sensing to quantum computing. However, they are typically obtained using exotic materials with high density inductance such as Josephson junctions, superconducting nanowires or twisted two-dimensional materials. Here, we present a superinductor realised within a silicon integrated circuit (IC), exploiting the high kinetic inductance ($\sim 1$~nH/$\square$) of TiN thin films native to the manufacturing process (22-nm FDSOI). By interfacing the superinductor to a silicon quantum dot formed within the same IC, we demonstrate a radio-frequency single-electron transistor (rfSET), the most widely used sensor in semiconductor-based quantum computers. The integrated nature of the rfSET reduces its parasitics which, together with the high impedance, yields a sensitivity improvement of more than two orders of magnitude over the state-of-the-art, combined with a 10,000-fold area reduction. Beyond providing the basis for dense arrays of integrated and high-performance qubit sensors, the realization of high-kinetic-inductance superconducting devices integrated within modern silicon ICs opens many opportunities, including kinetic-inductance detector arrays for astronomy and the study of metamaterials and quantum simulators based on 1D and 2D resonator arrays.
