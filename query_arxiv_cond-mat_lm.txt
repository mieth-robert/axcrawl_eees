Title: Photoluminescence Dynamics of CdSe QD/polymer Langmuir-Blodgett Thin Films: Morphology Effects
Authors: Beatriz Martín-García, Pedro M. R. Paulo, Sílvia M. B. Costa, M. Mercedes Velázquez
Abstract: Thin films of colloidal semiconductor CdSe quantum-dots (QDs) and a styrene/maleic anhydride copolymer were prepared by the Langmuir-Blodgett technique and their photoluminescence was characterized by confocal fluorescence lifetime microscopy. In the films, the photoluminescence dynamics are strongly affected by excitation energy migration between close-packed quantum-dots and energy trapping by surface-defective QDs or small clusters of aggregated QDs. Polymer/QD films with more aggregated QD regions exhibit lower PL intensities and faster decays, which we attribute primarily to the increased ability of excitations to find trap sites among more close-packed QD regions. This was confirmed by comparing films from bilayer or co-spreading deposition, and varying the QD-to-polymer composition or the surface pressure at deposition. The more regular films, such as those obtained by bilayer deposition at high-pressure, display more surface emission intensity and decays with less accentuated curvature. Decay analysis was performed with a model that accounts for excitation energy migration and trapping in the films. In the framework of the model, the photoluminescence dynamics are related to film morphology through the density of energy traps. A lower amount of QD clustering in the films reflects on a lower density of energy traps and, thus, on more emissive QD films, as inferred here for bilayer films relatively to co-spreading films.

Title: Theory of reentrant superconductivity in Corbino Josephson junctions
Authors: Omri Lesser, Joon Young Park, Yuval Ronen, Thomas Werkmeister, Philip Kim, Yuval Oreg
Abstract: Josephson junctions made of conventional superconductors display Fraunhofer-like oscillations of the critical current as a function of the threaded magnetic flux. When the superconductors are deposited on the surface of a three-dimensional topological insulator, this pattern is slightly modified due to the presence of chiral Majorana modes. Here we calculate the critical current of a Corbino Josephson junction, where the fluxoid becomes quantized and the superconducting phase has an integer winding. We discover that circular junctions exhibit similar behavior in both topologically trivial and non-trivial scenarios, while non-circular junctions demonstrate a remarkable distinction. Using a simple analytical model, we show that these non-circular junctions exhibit reentrant superconductivity with a period related to their number of corners, and numerically we find that this period is halved in the topological case. The period halving may help establish the existence of topological superconductivity in hybrid topological insulator-superconductor junctions.

Title: Exciton-Anyon Binding in Fractional Chern Insulators: Spectral Fingerprints
Authors: Tianhong Lu, Luiz H. Santos
Abstract: Transition--metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) uniquely combine topological electronic states realized without external magnetic fields with a strong optical response arising from long--lived excitons. Motivated by this confluence, we investigate an interacting fermion--boson system formed by coupling an exciton to a quasihole of a fractional Chern insulator (FCI) at filling fraction $1/3$. We introduce a kagome--lattice fermion--boson model hosting an electronic FCI and a mobile exciton whose dispersion is tunable from a parabolic band to a flatband. Using exact diagonalization, we demonstrate the emergence of exciton--quasihole bound states controlled by the repulsive electron--exciton interaction $V_{\mathrm{FB}}$ and the exciton kinetic energy $t_{\mathrm{B}}$. These states appear as low--lying levels in the fermion--boson spectrum, well separated from the scattering continuum, and arise despite repulsive interactions due to a residual attraction to the local charge depletion associated with a quasihole. Reducing $t_{\mathrm{B}}$ enhances this effect by favoring interaction--dominated binding. Our results provide a model description of moiré TMD heterostructures, including fractional Chern insulating twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ proximitized by excitonic TMD heterobilayers, where we estimate exciton--quasihole binding energy scales of $0.6$--$1.1$~meV, placing these effects within reach of photoluminescence spectroscopy.

Title: A Quantum Many-Body Approach for Orbital Magnetism in Correlated Multiband Electron Systems
Authors: Mengxing Ye
Abstract: Orbital magnetism is a purely quantum phenomenon that reflects intrinsic electronic properties of solids, yet its microscopic description in interacting multiband systems remains incomplete. We develop a general quantum many-body framework for orbital magnetic responses based on the Luttinger-Ward functional. Starting from the Dyson equation, we reformulate the thermodynamic potential in a weak magnetic field and construct a controlled expansion in powers of $B$ applicable to correlated electron systems. A key technical advance is a modified ``Fourier'' representation using noncommutative coordinates, which allows the thermodynamic potential to be expressed in an effective momentum space where the magnetic field acts perturbatively. This formulation makes analytic progress possible within the Moyal algebra. As an application, we derive the spontaneous orbital magnetization and express it entirely in terms of the zero-field Hamiltonian renormalized by the self-energy. For frequency-dependent but Hermitian self-energies, we generalize the orbital magnetic moment and Berry curvature to momentum-frequency space and identify two gauge-invariant contributions built from these quantities. For frequency-independent self-energies the result reduces to the familiar geometric formula for noninteracting systems. This framework provides a unified foundation for computing orbital magnetic responses in correlated multiband materials.

Title: Field-induced states and thermodynamics of the frustrated Heisenberg antiferromagnet on a square lattice
Authors: Andreas Honecker, M. E. Zhitomirsky, Alexander Wietek, Johannes Richter
Abstract: We investigate the ground-state and finite-temperature properties of the $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the square lattice in the presence of an external magnetic field. We focus on the highly frustrated regime around $J_2 \approx J_1/2$. The $h$-$T$ phase diagram is investigated with particular emphasis on the finite-temperature transition into the "up-up-up-down" state that is stabilized by thermal and quantum fluctuations and manifests itself as a plateau at one half of the saturation magnetization in the quantum case. We also discuss the enhanced magnetocaloric effect associated to the ground-state degeneracy that arises at the saturation field for $J_2=J_1/2$. For reference, we first study the classical case by classical Monte Carlo simulations. Then we turn to the extreme quantum limit of spin-1/2 where we perform zero- and finite-temperature Lanczos calculations.

Title: Approaching Kasteleyn transition in frustrated quantum Heisenberg antiferromagnets
Authors: Katarina Karlova, Afonso Rufino, Taras Verkholyak, Nils Caci, Stefan Wessel, Jozef Strecka, Frederic Mila, Andreas Honecker
Abstract: We show that the Kasteleyn transition, the abrupt proliferation of infinite strings of defects in classical dimer and related models, can also be relevant for frustrated 2d quantum magnets. This is explicitly demonstrated in a phase of the spin-1/2 Heisenberg diamond-decorated honeycomb lattice where a family of exact eigenstates built as products of dimer and plaquette singlets can be mapped onto the dimer coverings of the honeycomb lattice. The low-temperature properties of this phase are accurately described by an effective dimer model with anisotropic activities and a small, tunable density of monomers, leading to an arbitrarily sharp crossover version of the Kasteleyn transition. The generalization to other geometries and the possibility to realize this model in organo-metallic compounds are briefly discussed.

Title: Vortex-parity-controlled diode effect in Corbino topological Josephson junctions

Abstract: Nonreciprocal supercurrents in Josephson junctions have recently emerged as a sensitive tool for investigating broken symmetries in superconducting quantum materials. Here, we report an even-odd Josephson diode effect (JDE) in Corbino-geometry junctions fabricated on the pristine surface of a bulk-insulating three-dimensional topological insulator (3DTI). We find that the diode polarity, which indicates the preferred direction of supercurrent flow, robustly alternates its sign depending on the parity (even or odd) of the enclosed vortex number. This behavior is absent in two key control devices: a non-topological graphene Corbino Josephson junction and a 3DTI-based linear Josephson junction. These results indicate that the polarity-tunable JDE is intrinsically linked to the unique combination of the proximitized topological superconductivity in the 3DTI surface and the Corbino device's closed-loop geometry. Our theoretical modeling attributes the observed sign change in diode polarity to the alternating sign of periodic boundary conditions in topological superconductors, supporting the interpretation that the vortex-parity-controlled JDE is a direct manifestation of the underlying Andreev bound state topology associated with the presence of non-Abelian anyons in the vortices.

Title: Optimal control of bit erasure in stochastic random access memory
Authors: Songela W. Chen, David T. Limmer
Abstract: Energy costs of information processing are growing exponentially. Bit erasure is a key problem in this energy-information nexus, and a number of seminal relationships have been deduced regarding the relationship between thermodynamic costs and memory storage. To continue making progress in the modern era, however, requires confronting thermodynamic costs in realistic physical systems which operate away from equilibrium. Here, we explore the thermodynamic costs of bit erasure in a complementary metal oxide semiconductor model of two types of random access memory. We find dynamic random access memory dissipates the least amount of energy when operated in the quasistatic limit, where errors are also minimized. By contrast, static random access memory is most efficiently operated in finite time due to the energy required to maintain the state of the bit. We demonstrate a numerically robust optimization scheme using mean field theory and automatic differentiation, finding optimal protocols compatible with electrical engineering insights. These results provide a framework for operating realistic circuits in thermodynamically advantageous ways.

Title: Deconfined quantum criticality with internal supersymmetry
Authors: Zhi-Qiang Gao, Hui Yang, Yan-Qi Wang
Abstract: Deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP) describes direct, non-fine-tuned quantum phase transition between two ordered phases that break distinct and seemingly unrelated symmetries, providing a route to continuous phase transition beyond the conventional Ginzburg--Landau paradigm. In this work we extend the DQCP paradigm to systems with internal supersymmetry (SUSY), where the on-site Hilbert space furnishes a representation of a Lie superalgebra, and the Hamiltonian is invariant under the corresponding Lie supergroup. Focusing on the minimal supersymmetric generalization of spin $SU(2)$, namely $OSp(1|2)$, we propose a supersymmetric deconfined quantum critical point (sDQCP) between a phase that breaks internal $OSp(1|2)$ and a phase that instead breaks lattice rotation symmetry. We formulate a non-linear sigma model on the supersphere target space that captures the symmetry intertwinement characteristic of the sDQCP, and we further develop a gauge theory description to address its dynamical properties, including a heuristic argument for 3D XY critical behavior. Finally, we show that explicitly breaking $OSp(1|2)$ down to $SU(2)$ continuously connects our sDQCP to the conventional DQCP scenario.

Title: Pressure Tuning of Electronic Correlations and Flat Bands in CsCr$_3$Sb$_5$
Authors: Maria Chatzieleftheriou, Jonas B. Profe, Ying Li, Roser Valentí
Abstract: CsCr$_3$Sb$_5$ is a newly identified strongly correlated kagome superconductor, characterized by non-Fermi-liquid behavior at elevated temperatures and intertwined charge- and spin-density-wave order below $T_{DW}\approx 54$K. Under external pressure, this order is suppressed and a superconducting phase emerges. This phase diagram, which closely resembles that of high-$T_c$ superconductors, together with a kagome flat band near the Fermi level and possible altermagnetic order, has motivated extensive theoretical and experimental investigations. To better understand how pressure influences the ordered states, we present a systematic study of the evolution of the electronic properties under applied pressure. Performing DFT+DMFT (density functional theory combined with dynamical mean field theory) calculations, we uncover a complex interplay between the redistribution of spectral weight in the flat bands and the strength of electronic correlations under pressure. Our results further strengthen the interpretation that pressure effectively weakens electronic correlations through enhanced orbital hybridization. This, in turn, strongly suggests that superconductivity emerges as a direct consequence of the suppression of the system's ordered phase.

Title: Coupled concentration-charge dynamics in asymmetric 1:1 electrolytes, local transient response and fluctuations
Authors: Thê Hoang Ngoc Minh, Sleeba Varghese, Benjamin Rotenberg
Abstract: We investigate the coupled dynamics of concentration and charge in asymmetric 1:1 electrolytes, focusing on the interplay between diffusion asymmetry and external electric fields. Using Brownian dynamics simulations and linearized stochastic density functional theory (SDFT), we analyze the transient response of charge and number currents to inhomogeneous electric fields, as well as the steady-state spatio-temporal fluctuations under uniform fields. Our results reveal that asymmetry in ionic diffusion coefficients introduces a non-trivial coupling between charge and number transport, which modifies the two relaxation modes already present in symmetric electrolytes -- a fast one associated with charge relaxation and a slow one linked to ambipolar diffusion. The dynamics are further modulated by the applied field, which enhances diffusion, alters screening lengths, and induces oscillatory behavior in the relaxation modes. The SDFT framework provides closed-form expressions for the intermediate scattering matrix, capturing the dynamics of density fluctuations and cross-correlations between number and charge. These predictions are validated by simulations, demonstrating excellent agreement across a wide range of wave vectors, both at equilibrium and under a finite electric field. Our findings highlight the critical role of diffusion asymmetry and external fields in tuning the transport properties of electrolytes, with implications for nanofluidic devices, energy harvesting, and iontronic circuits. This work bridges theoretical insights with practical applications, offering a robust framework for understanding and controlling electrolyte dynamics in asymmetric systems.

Title: A comparative study of perturbative and nonequilibrium Green's function approaches for Floquet sidebands in periodically driven quantum systems
Authors: Karun Gadge, Marco Merboldt, Michael Schüler, Jan Philipp Bange, Wiebke Bennecke, Michael A. Sentef, Marcel Reutzel, Stefan Mathias, Salvatore R. Manmana
Abstract: We compare two complementary theoretical approaches to compute and interpret Floquet sidebands in periodically driven quantum materials: a first-order perturbative approach (first-order perturbative Born approximation, PB1) and time-dependent nonequilibrium Green's functions (tdNEGF). Using graphene as a model Dirac system, we disentangle in pump-probe setups Floquet-dressed initial states, Volkov-dressed final states (also known as laser-assisted photoelectric effect, LAPE), and their interference. We quantify how photoemission matrix elements, polarization, incidence angle, and near-surface screening shape the momentum-resolved sideband intensity observed in tr-ARPES. PB1 yields an analytical expression for the momentum-dependent sideband intensity, and for graphene it captures the correct symmetry trends, such as the magnitude of the intensities when considering the interference between the Floquet and Volkov states and photoemission matrix elements. tdNEGF reproduces the full energy-momentum-resolved spectra, including hybridization gaps and spectral-weight redistribution. We find qualitative agreement between PB1 and tdNEGF once matrix elements are included; quantitative differences arise near hybridization regions and at specific angles where higher-order processes and self-energies are essential. Thus, for systems with simple band structures and away from these regions, the two approaches can be used in a complementary way.

Title: Chirality and quasi-long-range order in finite-flux Gutzwiller states for magnetized frustrated magnets
Authors: Wen O. Wang, Urban F. P. Seifert, Oleg A. Starykh, Leon Balents
Abstract: We study Gutzwiller-projected wavefunctions for triangular-lattice U(1) Dirac spin liquids in a Zeeman field, where we allow the U(1) gauge field to develop a gauge flux, resulting in (spin-split) spinon Landau levels. We find that at a given magnetization, the optimal candidate state has a finite flux chosen such that the spinon filling lies in a $|C|=1$ Landau-level gap: it gives the lowest variational energy and the smallest energy variance within our correlation-matrix reconstruction for local Heisenberg-type models. By symmetry, we argue that the finite gauge flux results in a non-zero (staggered) scalar spin chirality, as also numerically observed, and further find that the $|C|=1$ state exhibits dominant quasi-long-ranged $120^\circ$ magnetic correlations. Studying the next-to-optimal wavefunction with a $|C|=2$ Landau-level gap, we observe unusual spin-nematic correlations. Our results may provide guidance for analyzing the magnetic-field response of DSL candidate materials and offer numerical diagnostics that can connect to the underlying theory of spinons coupled to an emergent U(1) gauge field.

Title: Lumped-Element Model of THz HEB Mixer Based on Sputtered MgB2 Thin Film
Authors: Changyun Yoo, Changsub Kim, Daniel P. Cunnane, Boris S. Karasik
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis and experimental study of THz hot-electron bolometer (HEB) mixers made from 40-nm-thick sputtered magnesium diboride (MgB2) thin films on high-resistivity silicon substrates. Using a lumped-element bolometric model, we achieve strong quantitative agreement with measurements of conversion gain, noise temperature, and local-oscillator (LO) coupling to the HEB devices. Our analysis shows that the sensitivity of current HEB devices is primarily limited by on-chip optical losses, with both Johnson and thermal-fluctuation noise contributing significantly to the overall noise temperature. Simulations of an optimized device with near-ideal optical coupling suggest that Johnson noise remains a substantial factor even with improved coupling. Further reduction of the noise temperature may require additional suppression of Johnson noise (via improved intrinsic conversion gain) beyond optimizing optical coupling efficiency. We emphasize the importance of accurate modeling to achieve good numerical agreement with experiments, thereby enabling understanding of the causes of sensitivity loss.

Title: Coarse-graining active tension nets with discrete conformal geometry
Authors: Nikolas H. Claussen, Fridtjof Brauns, Boris I. Shraiman
Abstract: In contrast to inert materials, living cells use molecular motors to generate forces independently of elastic strain. How do local active forces translate into large-scale shape, and what are the mechanical properties of the resulting "living matter"? Here, we address these questions within the active tension network (ATN) model for the mechanics of 2d epithelia. We represent the configuration of active forces geometrically by a tension triangulation dual to the cell tessellation. The Voronoi dual of the tension triangulation is shown to be macroscopically stress-free -- the tensions hence define an emergent reference state for the tissue. Two soft modes, curl-free and conformal deformations, map this reference to the internally stressed, but force-balanced, physical configuration of the tissue. Conformal deformations parametrize pressure gradients, leading to a generalization of von Neumann's law for the pressure in a foam. Via finite-element-like interpolation and a notion of "discrete" conformal maps, we both construct the mechanically balanced cell tessellations exactly on the microscopic level, and pass to the continuum limit. We systematically incorporate cell rearrangement into our theory by representing cell-scale topology in terms of circle packings. The results of this bottom-up coarse-graining study match a top-down continuum analysis presented in a companion paper. Thus, the geometry of force balance bridges between micro- and macro-scales, elucidating how cell-level active forces program shape. The present formalism may be useful in the study of foams, granular matter, and metamaterials, as well as in numerical simulations.

Title: Nanoscopy of Excitons in Atomically Thin In-Plane Heterostructures with Nanointerfaces
Authors: Mahdi Ghafariasl, Tianyi Zhang, Sampath Gamage, Da Zhou, Muhammad Asjad, Sarabpreet Singh, Antonio Gomez-Rodriguez, Diego M. Solis, Venkataraman Swaminathan, Mauricio Terrones, Yohannes Abate
Abstract: Atomically sharp 2D in-plane heterostructures with nanoscale interfaces provide a powerful platform for tailoring optical and electrical properties at the nanoscale, enabling novel device engineering and the exploration of new physical phenomena. However, direct experimental correlation between local dielectric response and excitonic properties across such interfaces has remained elusive. Here, we probed the nanoscale complex dielectric function and the corresponding localized photoluminescence (PL) modulations in heterostructure domains of lateral monolayer MoxW1-xS2 - WxMo1-xS2, synthesized using a liquid-phase precursor-assisted approach. Near-field nano imaging across the visible-near-infrared range enables real space mapping of sharp amplitude and phase changes at the heterointerface, resolving the local complex dielectric function with nano-meter scale spatial resolution. Excitation energy-dependent nano spectroscopy reveals a reversal of dielectric contrast between Mo-rich and W-rich domains at their respective excitonic resonances, consistent with Lorentz-oscillator fits. Complementary hyperspectral nano-PL mapping resolves the evolution of excitonic emission across the lateral heterointerface, with neutral-exciton intensities varying continuously from W-rich to Mo-rich regions. Effective-medium theory modeling of the imaginary part of the effective dielectric function of the heterostructure as a function of photon energy and Mo filling fraction reproduces the observed excitonic trends, linking the PL evolution to a composition-dependent dielectric response. Together, these results provide direct nanoscale correlation between dielectric and excitonic boundaries in laterally stitched monolayer heterostructures and establish a multimodal near-field spectroscopy framework for probing excitonic phenomena at the nanoscale.

Title: Fracture initiation in silicate glasses via a universal shear localization mechanism
Authors: Matthieu Bourguignon, Gustavo Alberto Rosales-Sosa, Yoshinari Kato, Bruno Bresson, Hikaru Ikeda, Shingo Nakane, Gergely Molnár, Hiroki Yamazaki, Etienne Barthel
Abstract: Shear bands lie at the root of fracture initiation in bulk metallic glasses and amorphous polymers. For silicate glasses, in contrast, studies have largely emphasized permanent volumetric strain, commonly referred to as densification. Here we systematically investigate indentation-induced fracture in two distinct families of aluminoborosilicate glasses. The results demonstrate that plastic shear flow plays a decisive role in governing fracture initiation. In addition, molecular dynamics simulations reveal a pronounced composition dependence of softening associated with plastic shear flow, closely mirroring the experimentally observed propensity for strain localization. We conclude that silicate glasses conform to a universal pattern of rupture initiation governed by localization of shear-deformation, aligning with a broad range of amorphous materials, including bulk metallic glasses and glassy polymers.

Title: Magnetic field induced phenomena in Kitaev spin liquids
Authors: Shi Feng, Nandini Trivedi
Abstract: Quantum spin liquids (QSLs) host a variety of fractionalized particles. In Kitaev's paradigmatic honeycomb model a spin-$\tfrac{1}{2}$ fractionalizes into $Z_2$ flux due to emergent $Z_2$ gauge field and matter Majorana fermions. Although these excitations have well-defined dynamics in the integrable limit, their direct experimental identification is notoriously challenging: realistic materials inevitably host additional symmetry-allowed interactions that break integrability and hybridize gauge and matter sectors, while magnetic fields, which are often required to suppress competing order and stabilize a putative QSL regime, further entangle the responses of different fractionalized quasiparticles and may even drive the system into field-induced spin-liquid phases that are not adiabatically connected to the integrable limit. A prominent example is the quantum Majorana metal, in which the distinct dynamics of fractionalized Majorana fermions can become directly visible in scattering. This report highlights recent progress on these related questions: in which field-stabilized QSL regimes and nearby emergent phases, and under what conditions, can the response of a specific fractionalized quasiparticle be isolated and positively understood, thereby clarifying the existence and the experimental scope of putative spin liquids? We review the progress on these questions across Abelian, non-Abelian, and an emergent quantum phases under magnetic field that are not perturbatively connected to the integrable limit. We connect these field-induced dynamical phenomena to concrete experimental observables, relevant for neutron scattering, resonant inelastic X-ray scattering, and pump-probe spectroscopy that are capable of resolving specific types of fractionalized particles, including Majoranas and $Z_2$ fluxes.

Title: A Modulated Electron Lattice (MEL) Criterion for Metallic Superconductivity
Authors: Jaehwahn Kim, Davis A. Rens, Waqas Khalid, Hyunchul Kim
Abstract: A central unresolved question in the theory of superconductivity is why only a small subset of metallic elements exhibit a superconducting state, whereas many others remain strictly normal. Neither the conventional Bardeen Cooper Schrieffer (BCS) framework nor its extensions involving charge density wave (CDW) or pair density wave (PDW) order provide a predictive or material-selective criterion capable of distinguishing superconducting metals from non-superconducting ones. In particular, the persistent absence of superconductivity in simple noble metals with well-defined Fermi surfaces poses a challenge for all traditional approaches. Here we address this problem using the Modulated Electron Lattice (MEL) Ginzburg Landau (GL) framework introduced in our previous work. In this formulation, a coarse-grained MEL charge field $\rho_{\mathrm{MEL}}(\mathbf{r})$ with momentum dependent stiffness $\alpha(q)$ is coupled to the superconducting (SC) order parameter $\psi(\mathbf{r})$. We show that metallic superconductivity emerges only when the system satisfies a specific ``MEL enhancement window,'' characterized by a negative minimum of $\alpha(q)$ at either a finite modulation wave vector $q^{\ast}$ or at $q=0$, together with sufficiently strong coupling between $\rho_{\mathrm{MEL}}$ and $\psi$. This unified criterion naturally partitions metallic elements into three universal classes: (i) MEL-enhanced superconductors with a finite-$q^{\ast}$ charge mode, (ii) conventional BCS superconductors as the homogeneous $q^{\ast}=0$ limit of the MEL framework, and (iii) metals for which $\alpha(q)$ remains positive for all $q$, suppressing all MEL modes and preventing any superconducting instability. By applying this criterion to simple metallic elements, we identify why some metals develop superconductivity while others do not, possibly resolving a selection problem long open within the BCS paradigm.

Title: Diffusive buckling fronts in lattice-based metamaterials
Authors: Jochem G. Meijer, Faadil Shaik, Heinrich M. Jaeger
Abstract: Mechanical metamaterials can be designed to exhibit unique mechanical properties, including tunable auxetic behavior as well as multi-stability, which arise from the geometry and configuration of the constituent building blocks. Lattice-based metamaterials, in particular, provide lightweight platforms where local instabilities can dictate the global response, with applications in energy routing, vibration isolation, and impact mitigation. In underdamped structures, perturbations have been found to propagate as nonlinear waves, e.g., transition waves or solitons. Here we investigate the opposite limit of overdamped, highly dissipative lattice metamaterials. Focusing on three-dimensional structures, we uncover how buckling instabilities, triggered by compression, propagate as fronts that shape the macroscopic behavior. We demonstrate in experiments on 3D-printed simple cubic lattices how global and local buckling modes can be controlled via the lattice geometry. By incorporating viscoelastic dissipation into a 3D-continuum model, we show that strain-driven buckling fronts obey coupled reaction-diffusion equations. The diffusion and reaction coefficients, determined by local geometry, material properties, and strain, select the propagation direction and enable steering of the fronts. This establishes a predictive and experimentally validated framework for the control of cascading mechanical instabilities in lattice-based metamaterials.

Title: Strain-tunable magnetic correlations in spin liquid candidate Nb$_3$Cl$_8$
Authors: Tharindu Fernando, Ting Cao
Abstract: Recent research suggests the possibility of the two-dimensional breathing-Kagome magnet Nb$_3$Cl$_8$ hosting a quantum spin liquid state, warranting further study into its magnetic properties. Using ab initio calculations, we show that monolayer Nb$_3$Cl$_8$ has short-range antiferromagnetic correlations among Nb$_3$ trimers with S = 1/2, and becomes magnetically frustrated due to the underlying effective triangular lattice geometry, and is evidenced by a frustration index of f > 1. The high-temperature susceptibility shows a negative Weiss temperature from Monte Carlo calculations. Considering spin-orbit coupling, we investigate the magnetic anisotropy, including anisotropic exchange, single-ion anisotropy and the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction using the four-state energy mapping formalism. Although the elements have relatively small atomic numbers, the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction is comparable in magnitude to the anisotropic exchange. Additionally, we show that biaxial strain tunes the short-range correlations between antiferromagnetic, paramagnetic and ferromagnetic. These findings strengthen our understanding of Nb$_3$Cl$_8$ and advance its applications in current condensed matter physics and materials science research, including nanoscale mechanical and spintronics applications.

Title: 3D bulk-resolved $g$-wave magnetic order parameter symmetry in the metallic altermagnet CrSb
Authors: Mengmeng Long, Theodore I. Weinberger, Zheyu Wu, Mads F. Hansen, Ran Tao, Mridul Shrestha, Dave Graf, Yurii Skourski, F. Malte Grosche, Alexander G. Eaton
Abstract: Electronic phases of matter, such as magnetism and superconductivity, are defined and distinguished by their order parameters that quantify the spontaneous symmetry breaking underlying each phase. The simplest cases are the uniform magnetisation of ferromagnets and isotropic gap function of conventional superconductors. Unconventional superconductors often have a nodal gap function, where the gap changes sign at nodes on the Fermi surface. This concept of unconventional or nodal order parameter symmetry has recently been extended to numerous magnetic systems, including altermagnets, in which up- and down-spin species are non-degenerate around the Fermi surface. Here we demonstrate that magnetic quantum oscillation measurements can provide a direct, bulk-sensitive, 3D mapping of the order parameter in an unconventional magnet. By rotating a magnetic field through high- and low-symmetry directions of the CrSb Brillouin zone, we show that this material's altermagetic band structure leads to the loss of mirror symmetry for each spin-split Fermi sheet away from highly symmetric nodal orientations. In momentum space, the difference between up and down spins follows the profile of the $\mathcal{Y}_{4}^{-3}=zy(3x^2-y^2)$ spherical harmonic - analogous to a $g$-orbital of the hydrogen atom. While notoriously difficult to resolve in unconventional superconductors, our work demonstrates that the order parameter symmetry of unconventional magnets can be conclusively determined through quantum-oscillatory quasiparticle spectroscopy. Our results empirically establish CrSb as a prototypical $g$-wave metallic altermagnet, which in pristine form possesses low residual resistivities down to $\sim$1 $\mu \Omega$cm, opening numerous avenues for next-generation spintronic device applications

Title: Majorana Fermions in spin up and down electronic complexes in spin-orbit coupled array of semiconductor quantum dots in proximity to $s$-type superconductor and in magnetic field
Authors: Mijanur Islam, Mahan Mohseni, Ibsal Assi, Daniel Miravet, Pawel Hawrylak
Abstract: Semiconductor-s-type superconductor nanowires host spinful fermions and cannot be reduced to a single spinless Kitaev chain hosting single Majorana zero mode. Instead, such systems can be converted into two coupled p-wave Kitaev-like chains associated with different spin sectors. Using the bond Fermion transformation and exact diagonalization, we analyze parity resolved spectra and local spectral functions, demonstrating that zero-energy modes strongly localized at the system boundaries emerge only in one effective chain. Inter-chain coupling lifts parity degeneracy and redistributes the low-energy spectral weight, providing a controlled framework to assess the stability of Majorana-like modes in the finite spinful nanowires.

Title: Theory of Andreev and shot noise spectroscopy for topological superconductors probed by $s$-wave superconducting tips
Authors: Jushin Tei, Ryo Hanai, Satoshi Fujimoto, Takeshi Mizushima
Abstract: Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS) with $s$-wave superconducting tips has been widely applied to probe exotic superconductors, but its potential for investigating topological superconductors remains unclear. In junctions between an $s$-wave superconductor and a topological superconductor, the dominant tunneling process is Andreev reflection, in which Cooper pairs from the $s$-wave superconductor tunnel as particle--hole excitations into the surface state of the topological superconductor. In this work, we theoretically investigate the fundamental properties of Andreev and shot noise spectroscopy on topological superconductors, focusing on the $dI/dV$ characteristics and current noise. We develop a real-time description of an effective tunneling action incorporating Andreev reflection processes in the Keldysh formalism and derive analytical expressions for the Andreev reflection current and the associated current noise. Furthermore, we perform numerical simulations for representative topological superconductors and provide a catalog of $dI/dV$ spectra and the Fano factor. Our results establish guidelines for probing topological superconductivity using STM with $s$-wave superconducting tips, and provide theoretical benchmarks for future STS experiments.

Title: Heterogeneous Transfer of Thin Film BaTiO3 onto Silicon for Device Fabrication
Authors: Temazulu S. Zulu, Larissa B. Little, Aaron M. Day, Chaoshen Zhang, Keith Powell, Kyeong-Yoon Baek, Benazir Fazlioglu-Yalcin, Neil Sinclair, Charles M. Brooks, David R. Barton, Marko Loncar, Julia A. Mundy
Abstract: Thin film BaTiO3 has one of the highest known Pockels coefficients (>1200 pm/V), making it an attractive material for use in electro-optic devices. It is advantageous to integrate BaTiO3 on silicon to enable complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) compatible processing. How- ever, synthesis of high-quality BaTiO3 directly on silicon remains a challenge. Here, we synthesize BaTiO3 using hybrid metal-organic molecular beam epitaxy (hMBE) and demonstrate its transfer onto silicon using thermocompression bonding and chemical lift-off. Hybrid metal-organic MBE en- ables self-regulated synthesis of highly stoichiometric thin films at high growth rates (>100nm/hr). Our transfer method results in millimeter-scale areas of atomically flat, crack-free BaTiO3 making it a potentially scalable method. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of our process to device fabrication through characterization of lithographically-patterned and etch-transferred sub-micron features.

Title: Excitation Energy Transfer in Nanohybrid System of Organic Molecule and Inorganic Transition Metal Dichalcogenides Nanoflake
Authors: Yan Meng, Kainan Chang, Luxia Wang
Abstract: Excitation energy transfer (EET) in an organic/inorganic nanohybrid system, composed of a single \textit{para}-sexiphenyl (6P) molecule physisorbed on a finite-sized MoS$_2$ nanoflake, is investigated theoretically. % The electronic structure of the MoS$_2$ nanoflake is described by using an 11-band tight-binding model, in which edge states are passivated with H atoms to restore a well-defined bandgap. % Within a configuration-interaction scheme, excitonic states are constructed and, for computational efficiency, approximated by uncorrelated electron-hole pairs in the relevant high-energy window. % The EET rates are evaluated via Fermi's golden rule, incorporating Coulomb coupling, thermal broadening, and spectral overlap between the molecular excitation and the MoS$_2$ nanoflake's electron-hole pairs. % Our results reveal that energy transfer from the molecule to the nanoflake is the dominant process, and its efficiency depends strongly on the size of the MoS$_2$ nanoflake, as well as the molecule's vertical distance and lateral position relative to the nanoflake.

Title: Nanodroplet-Confined Electroplating Enables Submicron Printing of Metals and Oxide Ceramics
Authors: Mirco Nydegger, Rebecca A. Gallivan, Arthur Barras, Henning Galinski, Ralph Spolenak
Abstract: The fabrication of functional micro- and nano-electronic devices requires the deposition of high-quality materials of different electronic material classes, such as conductors, semiconductors and insulators. To establish ultra-high-resolution additive manufacturing as a viable addition to existing fabrication methods requires the combinatorial additive deposition of different electronic material classes. However, current techniques do not provide such a capability. Here, we demonstrate that droplet confined electroplating, an ultra-high-resolution AM technique initially developed for metals as electrohydrodynamic redox printing (EHD-RP), allows not only the direct deposition of many metals, but also of metal-oxides. Particularly, we demonstrate that applying fundamental electrochemical principles in combination with on-the-fly switching of the deposited material allows for the direct co-deposition of metals, metal-hydroxides and -oxides. Our results exemplify the feasibility of leveraging simple water-based electrochemical concepts to produce intricate and multi-material structures at the nanoscale.

Title: Above Room Temperature Ferroelectricity in Epitaxially Strained KTaO3
Authors: Tobias Schwaigert, Salva Salmani-Rezaie, Sankalpa Hazra, Utkarsh Saha, Maya Ramesh, Aiden Ross, Betul Pamuk, Long-Qing Chen, David A. Muller, Darrell G. Schlom, Venkatraman Gopalan, Kaveh Ahadi
Abstract: Epitaxial strain is a powerful means to engineer emergent phenomena in thin films and heterostructures. Here, we demonstrate that KTaO3, a cubic perovskite in bulk form, can be epitaxially strained into a highly tunable ferroelectric. KTaO3 films grown commensurate to SrTiO3 (001) substrates experience an in-plane strain of -2.1 % that transforms the cubic structure into a tetragonal polar phase with transition temperature of 475 K, consistent with our thermodynamic calculations. We show that the Curie temperature and the spontaneous electric polarization can be system- atically controlled with epitaxial strain. Scanning transmission electron microscopy reveals cooperative polar displacements of the potassium columns with respect to the neighboring tantalum columns at room temperature. Optical second-harmonic generation results are described by a tetragonal polar point group (4mm), indicating the emergence of a global polar ground state. We observe a ferroelectric hysteresis response, using metal-insulator-metal capacitor test structures. The results demon- strate a robust intrinsic ferroelectric state in epitaxially strained KTaO3 thin films.

Title: Quantitative Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy of back-gated 2D semiconductors
Authors: Zander Scholl, Ezra Frohlich, Natalie Rogers, Paul Nguyen, Baker Hase, Joseph Tatsuro Murphy, Joel Toledo-Urena, David Cobden, Jennifer T. Heath
Abstract: In 2D field effect transistors the gate electrostatically dopes the 2D semiconductor (2DSC) channel, tuning the Fermi level. In principle, Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) can detect the Fermi level, and its dependence on gate bias as well as position, potentially directly yielding band gaps, contact barriers, spatial nonuniformities, and sub-gap densities of states in such devices. However, KPFM relies on an oscillating probe voltage which itself electrostatically dopes the 2DSC, potentially creating a nonlinear response. Here, we show that when a suitably thin hBN back-gate dielectric is used, the KPFM signal agrees well with expectations, as explained by a quasistatic charge-balance model. Corresponding experimental results show excellent consistency with the literature values of the bandgaps of monolayer and trilayer WSe2. With this approach, the widely available technique of KPFM should find improved utility and new uses in the study of 2D devices.

Title: Anomalous Localization and Mobility Edges in Non-Hermitian Quasicrystals with Disordered Imaginary Gauge Fields
Authors: Guolin Nan, Zhijian Li, Feng Mei, Zhihao Xu
Abstract: We study anomalous localization in a one-dimensional non-Hermitian quasicrystal with a spatially disordered imaginary gauge field. The system is a generalized Aubry-André-Harper (AAH) chain with asymmetric nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor hoppings generated by a Bernoulli imaginary gauge field and a quasiperiodic onsite potential. In the standard non-Hermitian AAH limit, the system undergoes a transition from a fully erratic non-Hermitian skin effect (ENHSE) phase to a fully localized phase. We show that the fractal dimension cannot distinguish these phases, whereas the Lyapunov exponent and center-of-mass fluctuations provide sharp diagnostics. This transition is accompanied by a complex-to-real spectral change under periodic boundary conditions and a topological change of the spectral winding number. With next-nearest-neighbor hopping, we uncover an anomalous mobility edge separating Anderson-localized states from ENHSE states, rather than extended states. This mobility edge is captured by an energy-dependent winding number that vanishes in the localized regime. Finally, we propose a dynamical probe based on wave-packet expansion: for typical disorder realizations, the dynamics shows winding-controlled drift and disorder-selected pinning or boundary-wrapping recurrence, while disorder averaging restores Hermitian-like transport. These results offer practical spectral, topological, and dynamical diagnostics of anomalous localization and mobility edges in non-Hermitian quasicrystals.

Title: Hydrogen Activation via Dihydride Formation on a Rh1/Fe3O4(001) Single-Atom Catalyst
Authors: Chunlei Wang, Panukorn Sombut, Lena Puntscher, Nail Barama, Maosheng Hao, Florian Kraushofer, Jiri Pavelec, Matthias Meier, Florian Libisch, Michael Schmid, Ulrike Diebold, Cesare Franchini, Gareth S. Parkinson
Abstract: Hydrogen activation is a key elementary step in catalytic hydrogenation. In heterogeneous catalysis, it usually proceeds through dissociative adsorption on metal nanoparticles followed by surface diffusion or spillover, whereas homogeneous catalysts activate H2 through dihydride or dihydrogen intermediates at a single metal center. Here, we show that isolated Rh adatoms supported on Fe3O4(001) activate hydrogen through formation of a stable dihydride species without atomic H spillover. Temperature-programmed desorption, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and scanning tunneling microscopy collectively reveal strong (approximately 1 eV) hydrogen adsorption exclusively at isolated Rh1 sites, while isotope-exchange experiments further demonstrate that hydrogen remains localized. Density-functional theory based calculations indicate a barrierless conversion from molecular H2 to the dihydride, and random-phase approximation calculations further confirm the relative stability of the dihydride. Together, these results show that single-atom Rh sites cleave and bind H2 through a dihydride pathway analogous to homogeneous complexes, establishing a mechanistic bridge between homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis.

Title: Functionalization of reduced graphite oxide sheets with a zwitterionic surfactant
Authors: Beatriz Martín-García, M. Mercedes Velázquez, Francesco Rossella, Vittorio Bellani, Enrique Diez, Jose Luis García Fierro, Jose Antonio Pérez-Hernández, Juan Hernández-Toro, Sergi Claramunt, Albert Cirera
Abstract: Films of a few layers in thickness of reduced graphite oxide, RGO, sheets functionalized by the zwitterionic surfactant N-dodecyl-N,N-dimethyl-3-ammonio-1-propanesulfonate, DDPS, are obtained by using the Langmuir-Blodgett method. The quality of the RGO sheets is checked by analyzing the degrees of reduction and defect repair by means of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy -AFM, field-emission scanning electron microscopy -SEM, micro-Raman spectroscopy, and electrical conductivity measurements. A modified Hummers method is used to obtain highly oxidized graphite oxide, GO, together with a centrifugation-based method to improve the quality of GO. The GO samples are reduced by hydrazine or vitamin C. Functionalization of RGO with the zwitterionic surfactant improves the degrees of reduction and defect repair of the two reducing agents and significantly increases the electrical conductivity of paperlike films compared with those prepared from unfunctionalized RGO.

Title: Langmuir and Langmuir-Blodgett films of a maleic anhydride derivative: effect of subphase divalent cations
Authors: Beatriz Martín-García, M. Mercedes Velázquez, Jose Antonio Pérez-Hernández, Juan Hernández-Toro
Abstract: We report the study of the equilibrium and dynamic properties of Langmuir monolayers of poly (styrene-co-maleic anhydride) partial 2-buthoxy ethyl ester cumene terminated polymer and the effect of the Mg(NO3)2 addition in the water subphase on the film properties. Results show that the polymer monolayer becomes more expanded when the electrolyte concentration in the subphase increases. Dense polymer films aggregate at the interface. The aggregates are transferred onto Silicon wafers using the Langmuir-Blodgett methodology and the morphology is observed by AFM. The structure of aggregates depends on the subphase composition of the Langmuir film transferred onto the silicon wafer.

Title: Realization of staircase topological Anderson phase transitions
Authors: Marwa Mannai, Yaoyao Shu, Sonia Haddad, Mina Ren, Hong Chen, Yong Sun, Hisham Sati
Abstract: One-dimensional topological Anderson insulators provide a paradigm for disorder-induced topological phases in which the underlying system turns from a trivial to a topological phase. It is widely recognized that the latter vanishes at large disorder amplitude. Here, and contrary to the general belief, we provide evidence for a successive disorder-driven topological transitions in a single-wall nanotube, culminating in a topological Anderson phase that remains unexpectedly robust at strong disorder. This phenomenon is confirmed by analysis of the corresponding topological invariant, which increases stepwise as disorder increases, giving evidence for the emergence of edge states. We experimentally implement these topological Anderson staircase phase transitions in a one-dimensional topolectrical circuit, where the persistence of edge states is revealed by node-voltage measurements. The robustness of the edge states is corroborated by numerical calculations of their localization properties. Our work opens the road to topological disordertronics, where topological phases can be tuned by disorder.

Title: Influence of Charge Density Waves on the Hall coefficient in NiTi
Authors: Adrian Braun, Henrik Dick, Timon Sieweke, Alexander Kunzmann, Klara Lünser, Gabi Schierning, Thomas Dahm
Abstract: We present a mean-field charge density wave theory for NiTi using density functional theory bandstructure as a starting point. We calculate the Hall coefficient as a function of temperature and compare with recent experimental results. We analyze the contributions to the Hall coefficient from different parts of the Fermi surface and find that the Hall coefficient is dominated by certain ``hot spots''. The analysis shows that these hot spots are mostly dominated by Ni d-orbitals. We demonstrate that the Hall coefficient is not well reproduced by Boltzmann transport theory within the constant relaxation time approximation without charge density waves. We consider both uniaxial and biaxial charge density waves and show that biaxial charge density waves can account well for the Hall coefficient, while uniaxial cannot. We also investigate the temperature dependence of the resistivity and the specific heat.

Title: Near-Atomic-Scale Compositional Complexity in a 2D Transition Metal Oxide
Authors: Mathias Krämer, Bar Favelukis, J. Manoj Prabhakar, Aleksander Albrecht, Brian A. Rosen, Noam Eliaz, Maxim Sokol, Baptiste Gault
Abstract: 2D materials hold transformative promise for next-generation nanoelectronics. However, successfully integrating these materials from laboratory-scale discoveries into real-world devices depends on precisely controlling their properties, which are fundamentally determined by their composition. Detailed characterisation using atom probe tomography of 2D Ti0.87O2, a candidate high-$\kappa$ dielectric, reveals deviations from its commonly assumed stoichiometry. Compositional analysis and comparison with the bulk K0.8[Ti1.73Li0.27]O4 precursor evidences an oxygen deficit indicative of oxygen vacancy formation in the 2D material, as well as the retention of low concentrations of alkali metals that were presumed to be removed during synthesis. Such deviations from stoichiometry indicate a reconstruction mechanism that mitigates the effect of the characteristic, negatively charged vacancies on the titanium sublattice, thereby influencing the local electronic structure and, consequently, functional properties. These findings underscore the importance of a detailed compositional analysis in both understanding and optimizing the extraordinary functional properties of 2D materials, opening pathways to tailored functionalities in next-generation nanoelectronics.

Title: Emergence of multiple zero modes bound to vortices in extended topological Josephson junctions
Authors: Adrian Reich, Kiryl Piasotski, Eytan Grosfeld, Alexander Shnirman
Abstract: We study planar Josephson junctions formed on the surface of a three-dimensional topological insulator (Fu-Kane proposal) and examine the experimentally relevant parameter regimes in which the effective velocity of the emergent one-dimensional Majorana modes approaches zero. We show that the frequently employed Fu-Kane effective theory breaks down in this case. As parameters like the chemical potential or the width of the junction are tuned, instances of vanishing effective velocity mark the emergence of additional 'Dirac cones' at zero energy and finite momentum. If the junction is subjected to an external magnetic field, Josephson vortices may then bind a number of zero modes in addition to the topological Majorana mode. The additional zero modes are 'symmetry-protected' and can be lifted by a broken mirror symmetry (which is to be expected in realistic scenarios) as well as by an in-plane magnetization (or Zeeman field). We note that the ensuing presence of additional low-energy Andreev states can significantly contribute to measured quantities like the Josephson current or microwave absorption spectra.

Title: Learning and extrapolating scale-invariant processes
Authors: Anaclara Alvez-Canepa, Cyril Furtlehner, François Landes
Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) has deeply changed some fields recently, like Language and Vision and we may expect it to be relevant also to the analysis of of complex systems. Here we want to tackle the question of how and to which extent can one regress scale-free processes, i.e. processes displaying power law behavior, like earthquakes or avalanches? We are interested in predicting the large ones, i.e. rare events in the training set which therefore require extrapolation capabilities of the model. For this we consider two paradigmatic problems that are statistically self-similar. The first one is a 2-dimensional fractional Gaussian field obeying linear dynamics, self-similar by construction and amenable to exact analysis. The second one is the Abelian sandpile model, exhibiting self-organized criticality. The emerging paradigm of Geometric Deep Learning shows that including known symmetries into the model's architecture is key to success. Here one may hope to extrapolate only by leveraging scale invariance. This is however a peculiar symmetry, as it involves possibly non-trivial coarse-graining operations and anomalous scaling. We perform experiments on various existing architectures like U-net, Riesz network (scale invariant by construction), or our own proposals: a wavelet-decomposition based Graph Neural Network (with discrete scale symmetry), a Fourier embedding layer and a Fourier-Mellin Neural Operator. Based on these experiments and a complete characterization of the linear case, we identify the main issues relative to spectral biases and coarse-grained representations, and discuss how to alleviate them with the relevant inductive biases.

Title: Ionization energy and electron affinity of fullerene C60 in the Hubbard model in the static fluctuation approximation
Authors: Gennadiy Ivanovich Mironov
Abstract: Within the Hubbard model, the ionization energy and electron affinity of the icosahedral C60 fullerene are calculated in the static fluctuation approximation. A graphical representation of the chemical potential equation is first obtained. The correlation function, which describes the transitions of {\pi}-electrons from one fullerene site to the nearest site, and the thermodynamic average, which characterizes the probability of detecting two {\pi}-electrons with oppositely oriented spin projections on a single fullerene site, are then calculated. The theoretically obtained values for the ionization energy of 7.57 eV and the electron affinity of 2.67 eV coincide with the experimentally observed values and demonstrate that, during photoionization or another process leading to either the acquisition or loss of a {\pi}-electron, the fullerene responds to external perturbations as a single system of strongly correlated {\pi}-electrons.

Title: Ionic transport in spontaneously ion-intercalated van der Waals layered structures
Authors: Ata Utku Özkan, Talip Serkan Kasırga, Aykut Erbaş
Abstract: Understanding ionic transport under strong confinement is crucial for the design of next-generation energy, catalytic, and information-processing materials; however, repeated field-driven ion motion often degrades conventional solid electrolytes. Van der Waals layered materials offer an alternative by providing structurally resilient ion-transport channels, yet the microscopic origins of their nonequilibrium transport behavior remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate field-driven ionic conduction in sodium-intercalated layered MnO$_2$ as a model self-intercalated van der Waals solid, using all-atom nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations that explicitly capture ion-water correlations and layer morphology. We demonstrate that ionic conductivity depends nonlinearly on the applied electric field, interlayer spacing, water content, and lattice flexibility. The applied electric field induces spatial segregation of water coupled to distortions of the MnO$_2$ sheets, producing coexisting regions populated by highly hydrated and weakly hydrated ions with suppressed conductivity. Concurrently, ionic transport exhibits a nonmonotonic dependence on the total amount of intercalated water, with boundary domains of weakly hydrated ions displaying relatively higher mobility. In fluctuation-free layers, ion transport transitions from single-particle motion to a collective conduction regime characterized by elongated, same-charge ionic clusters that violate Nernst-Einstein behavior. Together, these findings provide a molecular-level mechanism linking confinement-induced electrostatic correlations and structural response to the emergent nonlinear transport observed experimentally in ion-intercalated MnO$_2$, and suggest general design principles for robust, water-assisted ionic conductors.

Title: Significance of the dispersion force for ferroelectric switching in ZnO and related materials
Authors: Lingyao Zhang, Musen Li, Nisha Metha, Carla Verdi, Wei Ren, Jeffrey R. Reimers
Abstract: Wurtzite-ZnO is a wide-bandgap polar material with a ferroelectric-switching barrier that is too high to utilize, but the barrier can be reduced and switching observed in substituted materials such as Zn0.5Mg0.5O. Here, we seek to understand atomic-scale features that control concerted polarization switching in these and related systems, focusing on the planar hexagonal structures h-ZnO and Zn0.5Mg0.5O that may act as metastable intermediate phases along the switching pathway. Consensus is obtained by considering a range of pure and dispersion-corrected density-functional theory (DFT) computational approaches, as well as ab initio Hartree-Fock (HF), Møller-Plesset perturbation-theory (MP2), and random-phase approximation (RPA) calculations. The perceived stability of h-ZnO is found to be strongly influenced by the dispersion correction, with the consensus being that dispersion interactions are insufficient to stabilize h-ZnO as a metastable phase in infinite crystals. In contrast, h-Zn0.5Mg0.5O is consistently predicted to be at least metastable, with some dispersion-corrected DFT approaches predicting it to be more stable than its wurtzite form; all DFT methods overestimate its stability compared to MP2 and RPA. Dispersion forces are found to be most significant for hypothetical planar hexagonal structures constrained to the lattice vectors of the wurtzite phases. In general, our results demonstrate that an accurate treatment of dispersion forces is essential when describing polarization switching and ferroelectric behavior in wurtzite-structured materials.

Title: Altermagnets versus Antiferromagnets
Authors: V.P.Mineev
Abstract: Altermagnets are metals with a momentum-dependent spin splitting of electron bands due to a specific crystal structure, which is invariant under time reversal only in combination with rotations and reflections. The developed phenomenological approach makes it possible to obtain a spectrum of electron bands in an altermagnet corresponding to an antiferromagnet with the same symmetry. The anomalous Hall effect is an inherent property of substances whose electron band dispersion is characterized by the Berry curvature. Calculations of the Berry curvature were performed for altermagnet analogs of collinear antiferromagnet, weak ferromagnetic antiferromagnet, and ferrimagnetic structures. It was shown that in the specific cases under consideration, the anomalous Hall effect in the absence of an external magnetic field is possible only in the state of a weak ferromagnet.

Title: Role of Defects in the Paramagnetism of Fe-doped Cs\_{2}AgBiBr\_{6} Double Perovskite
Authors: Volodymyr Vasylkovskyi, Olga Trukhina, Patrick Dörflinger, Mykola Slipchenko, Wolf Gero Schmidt, Timur Biktagirov, Anastasiia Kultaeva, Yakov Kopelevich, Vladimir Dyakonov
Abstract: Transition-metal doping enables the introduction of spin functionality into halide double perovskites, while simultaneously modifying optical properties. Here, we combine controlled single- crystal growth, optical characterization, comprehensive electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, and first-principles modeling to identify the microscopic nature of Fe-related centers in Fe-doped Cs\_{2}AgBiBr\_{6}. Single crystals with nominal Fe\^{3+} concentrations up to 15\% in the precursor stage were grown using a controlled-cooling method, yielding reproducible Fe incorporation up to 0.1\% w.r.t. Bi, without secondary phases. Despite this low concentration, Fe doping introduces electronic states that influence optical absorption and photoluminescence. EPR measurements reveal an S = 5/2 Fe\^{3+}-related center whose anisotropy follows the cubic-to-tetragonal phase transition below 120 K. Angular- dependent EPR resolves two configurations of this nearly axial spin center, with principal axes rotated by 90° and aligned with the \it{a/b} plane of the tetragonal lattice. Density-functional calculations attribute these centers to impurity-vacancy complexes, most likely Fe\sub{Bi}-V\sub{Br}, that stabilise in a basal configuration of the low-temperature phase. This approach resolves vacancy-coupled defect orientations, narrowing possible models to Fe\^{3+}-vacancy complexes and establishing them as stable, orientation-sensitive spin probes of structural symmetry in halide double perovskites, while providing a microscopic basis for tuning their magnetic and optical responses.

Abstract: Uncovering the rich and intricate characteristics of three-dimensional (3D) magnetic textures is essential for functional materials such as magnetic multilayers, where the delicate balance of various magnetic interactions leads to complex 3D spin arrangements. Among these textures, skyrmionic cocoons-tubular 3D magnetic structures characterized by a closed magnetization surface wrapping around a core-have emerged as particularly intriguing. Stabilized by competing magnetic interactions, these textures reside within a fraction of the thickness of the magnetic material and exhibit a typical lateral size of approximately 100 nm. Here, we present a vector tomographic reconstruction of the 3D magnetization in aperiodic Pt/Co/Al chiral multilayers, where skyrmionic cocoons have been recently reported. Using soft X-ray Holography with Extended Reference by Autocorrelation Linear Differential Operator (HERALDO), we acquire tomographic projections of the magnetic configuration and reconstruct the full 3D magnetization vector field with a spatial resolution of approximately 30 nm, as determined by Fourier shell correlation (FSC). This resolution allows us to observe critical features of the cocoons, such as their vertical misalignment and their overall chirality. Our findings demonstrate that HERALDO-based vector tomography is a powerful approach for revealing the internal structure and vertical extent of these nanoscale magnetic textures, offering new experimental insights into their intrinsic behavior.

Abstract: Future long-duration space missions will require in-situ, on-demand manufacturing of tools and components. Photopolymer-based processes are attractive for this purpose due to their low energy requirements, volume efficiency, and precise control of curing. However, photopolymerization generates significant heat, which is difficult to regulate in microgravity where natural convection is absent, leading to defects such as surface blistering and deformation. In this work, we combine experimental studies and modeling to address these thermal challenges. We report results from International Space Station (ISS) experiments and a dedicated parabolic flight campaign, which confirm that suppressed convective heat transfer in microgravity exacerbates thermal buildup and defect formation. Building on these observations, we present a predictive thermal model that couples heat transfer, light absorption, and evolving material properties to simulate polymerization and temperature evolution under terrestrial and microgravity conditions. Laboratory validation demonstrates strong agreement between model predictions and measured temperature profiles. Applying the model to the ISS experiments, we show that the model accurately reproduces experimentally observed blistering in TJ-3704A, a commercial acrylate-based polymer resin, while also predicting defect-free outcomes for Norland optical adhesives. The model functions as a design tool for defect-free in-space manufacturing, enabling selection of polymer properties, exposure strategies, and environmental conditions that together inhibit excess thermal buildup, paving the way for scalable, reliable in-situ manufacturing during future missions.

Title: Precisely positioned generation of CsPbBr3 nano-light sources in a Cs4PbBr6 film by electron beam irradiation
Authors: Tomoyasu Fujimaru, Kanta Hirai, Masato Inamata, Hiromu Tanaka, Midori Ikeuchi, Hidehiro Yamashita, Mitsutaka Haruta, Takehiko Tamaoka, Naohiko Kawasaki, Hikaru Saito
Abstract: Integration of high-quality photon emitters at specific locations within nanophotonic structures or optoelectronic devices is a key to innovating on-chip optical control and quantum technologies. Halide perovskite nanoparticles have great potential as single photon emitters with high quantum efficiency. To achieve their full potential, they must be embedded in a host material that ensures chemical stability and passivates surface defects. A previous experiment on a CsPbBr3-Cs4PbBr6 nanocomposite film suggested possibility that electron beam irradiation can be used to control positions of CsPbBr3 nano-light sources in the Cs4PbBr6 host although the effects of electron beam irradiation are not fully understood. Here, we fabricate a Cs4PbBr6-CsBr film, not containing the CsPbBr3 phase, and provide direct evidence that CsPbBr3 nanoparticles can be locally generated in the Cs4PbBr6 host by irradiation with a focused electron beam. We further demonstrate perovskite nano-light source arrays with submicron spacing using this method.

Abstract: The electronic ground states of transition-metal dichalcogenides are strongly shaped by reduced dimensionality, yet the properties of atomically thin layers remain difficult to probe due to their small size and environmental sensitivity. Here we demonstrate that controlled electrochemical intercalation of organic cations provides a robust bulk platform for accessing monolayer-like physics in NbSe$_2$. Intercalation of tetrapropylammonium and tetrabutylammonium expands the interlayer spacing by nearly a factor of two, electronically decoupling the NbSe$_2$ layers while simultaneously introducing well-defined charge doping. Using a combination of Raman spectroscopy, scanning tunneling microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and photoemission, we uncover a pronounced enhancement of the charge-density-wave transition temperature to $\sim 130$ K together with a strong suppression of superconductivity, reproducing the phase diagram observed in exfoliated monolayers. The enhanced charge-density-wave order and reduced $T_c$ arise from the combined effects of dimensionality reduction and electron injection, and are accompanied by distinct dip-hump anomalies in the tunneling spectra suggestive of collective mode excitations. Our results establish molecular intercalation as a powerful and scalable route for engineering competing orders in layered quantum materials.

Title: Energy-Selective Complete Spin Polarization in an Extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Ferromagnetic Chain
Authors: Souvik Roy, Ranjini Bhattacharya
Abstract: We study spin-dependent transport in an extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain with cosine modulated nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor hopping using the nonequilibrium Green's function formalism. Suitable tuning of the hopping parameters yields a complete separation of spin channels and perfect spin polarization over broad energy windows. The inclusion of next-nearest-neighbor hopping enhances both tunability and robustness, while systematic phase-diagram analyses reveal quantized polarization across extended regions of parameter space rather than at isolated fine-tuned points. These characteristics persist for larger system sizes, establishing the extended SSH model as a versatile platform for controllable spin-polarized transport.

Title: Spin-orbit-driven quarter semimetals in rhombohedral graphene
Authors: Jing Ding, Hanxiao Xiang, Naitian Liu, Wenqiang Zhou, Xinjie Fang, Zhangyuan Chen, Le Zhang, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Shuigang Xu
Abstract: Semimetals exhibit intriguing characteristics attributed to the coexistence of both electrons and holes. In rhombohedral multilayer graphene, a strong trigonal warping effect gives rise to a semi-metallic state near the Fermi surface, offering unique opportunities to explore the interplay of semi-metallic properties with strong correlations and topologies. Here, the observation of quarter semimetals in rhombohedral multilayer graphene by introducing spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is reported. The semi-metallic characteristics of rhombohedral graphene manifest as nearly vanished Hall resistance and parabolic longitudinal resistance. The strong correlations arising from the surface flat band lead to spontaneous symmetry breaking. SOC proximitized by WSe2 further lifts the valley degeneracy, resulting in the spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking, as evidenced by the hysteretic anomalous Hall effect. The coexistence of fully polarized electrons and holes allows for the observation of a non-monotonic temperature dependence of the anomalous Hall resistance. Furthermore, the application of moderate magnetic fields induces a phase transition from quarter semimetals to Chern insulators. These findings establish rhombohedral multilayer graphene as an ideal platform for studying strong correlations and topologies in semimetals.

Title: Designing DNA nanostar hydrogels with programmable degradation and antibody release
Authors: Giorgia Palombo, Christine A. Merrick, Jennifer Harnett, Susan Rosser, Davide Michieletto, Yair Augusto Gutiérrez Fosado
Abstract: DNA nanostar (DNAns) hydrogels are promising materials for in vivo applications, including tissue regeneration and drug and antibody delivery. However, a systematic and quantitative understanding of the design principles controlling their degradation is lacking. Here, we investigate hydrogels made of three-armed DNAns with varying flexible joints, arm lengths, and mesh sizes and use restriction enzymes to cut the DNAns structures while monitoring the gel's degradation. We discover that (i) removing flexible joints, (ii) increasing arm length, or (iii) relocating the RE site along a DNA linker markedly accelerates hydrogel degradation. In contrast, non-specific endonucleases, e.g. DNaseI, quicly degrade DNAns hydrogels regardless of design. Importantly, the release of antibodies from DNAns hydrogels can be modulated by the action of different enzymes, confirming that programmable degradation can be leveraged for responsive drug-delivery systems. These findings provide a better understanding of the design principles for DNAns-based scaffolds with tunable degradation, cargo release, and responsive rheology.

Title: Spin Fluctuations in the Rare-Earth Doped Bilayer Nickelates
Authors: Honglin Zhou, Xinman Ye, Gang Wang, Devashibhai Adroja, David Tam, Michael Marek Koza, Zhilun Lu, Jinguang Cheng, Dao-Xin Yao, Huiqian Luo
Abstract: Spin fluctuations have been generally believed as the pairing glue of high-$T_c$ superconductivity. Recent inelastic neutron scattering (INS) studies have revealed a weak flat spin-fluctuation signal around 45 meV in the bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$, suggesting strong interlayer and weak intralayer magnetic couplings ($SJ_{\perp}\approx$ 60 meV, $SJ_{\parallel}\leq$ 3.5 meV) in contrast to cuprate and pnictide superconductors. Here, we report further INS studies on the Pr and Nd doped La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ powder samples at ambient pressure. Besides the crystalline electric field excitations at low energies, we have found that the 45 meV flat mode splits into two modes in doped compounds, along with another weak mode at about 60 meV, where the spin fluctuations in La$_2$NdNi$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ are stronger than La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ and La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$. Based on an effective Heisenberg model by only considering the nearest-neighbor exchange couplings on the stripe-type antiferromagnetic orders, we conclude that the interlayer coupling $SJ_{\perp}$ is enhanced to about 69 meV and 73 meV for Pr and Nd doped samples, respectively. Our results highlight the crucial role of interlayer coupling in the rare-earth doped bilayer nickelates, which towards to promote high $T_c$ via interlayer $s\pm$ pairing.

Abstract: Freestanding perovskite oxide membranes provide a novel platform for elastic strain engineering, enabling the manipulation of phonon transport free from substrate clamping. In this work, we investigate the thermal transport properties of strontium titanate (SrTiO3) and barium titanate (BaTiO3) membranes subjected to self-formed crease induced inhomogeneous strain. By integrating spatially resolved Frequency-Domain Thermoreflectance (FDTR) with micro-Raman spectroscopy, we observe a sharp, localized suppression of thermal conductivity (k) in high-curvature regions. Specifically, k is reduced from 4.43 to 3.62 W/(m K) in SrTiO3 and from 2.27 to 1.81 W/(m K) in BaTiO3 at the crease centers, directly correlating with the local strain distribution. First-principles calculations reveal that, unlike uniform strain, the symmetry breaking induced by strain gradients significantly broadens phonon dispersion and enhances scattering rates. These findings not only elucidate the microscopic mechanisms governing phonon-strain coupling but also demonstrate the potential of inhomogeneous strain fields as a potent tool for designing dynamic solid-state thermal switches and active thermal management devices.

Title: Pristine and Doped MoS2 Monolayers as Potential HCN Gas Sensors: A DFT Study
Authors: Neeraj Thakur, Anjna Bhardwaj, Arun Kumar, Amarjeet Singh
Abstract: Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) have been extensively investigated due to their tunable properties. In this work, density functional theory (DFT) is employed to investigate the adsorption behavior and sensing characteristics of HCN on pristine and doped MoS2 monolayers (X-MoS2, where X = P, N, Si, Al, B, Cl). The structural, electronic, and optical characteristics of all systems are examined to study the sensing properties of various doped MoS2 monolayers. In particular, the Al-MoS2 system demonstrates the strongest adsorption characterized by chemisorption, while the remaining systems show interactions of physisorption type. Recovery time and changes in electronic and optical properties reveal that Si-MoS2 possesses an ultrafast response of the order of microseconds, while Al-MoS2 exhibits a significantly longer recovery time, making it unsuitable for reusable sensors. P-MoS2, Si-MoS2, and Al-MoS2 monolayers show pronounced changes in their properties after HCN adsorption. To explore tunability in adsorption strength and recovery behavior, systems with two and three dopant atoms are further studied for P, Si, and Al doping. The results indicate that double doping enhances adsorption strength, whereas triple symmetric doping weakens it. Based on adsorption energy, recovery time, and electronic response, 2P-MoS2 and 3Al-MoS2 are identified as promising candidates for electrochemical and chemiresistive sensing of HCN. Additionally, the observed optical response in the ultraviolet region highlights their potential in UV-range optical sensor design.

Title: Crystal growth and characterization of a hole-doped iron-based superconductor Ba(Fe$_{0.875}$Ti$_{0.125}$)$_2$As$_2$
Authors: Yi-Li Sun, Ze-Zhong Li, Yang Li, Hong-Lin Zhou, Amit Pokhriyal, Haranath Ghosh, Shi-Liang Li, Hui-Qian Luo
Abstract: We report the crystal growth of a new hole-doped iron-based superconductor Ba(Fe$_{0.875}$Ti$_{0.125}$)$_2$As$_2$ by substituting Ti on the Fe site. The crystals are accidentally obtained in trying to grow Ni doped Ba$_2$Ti$_2$Fe$_2$As$_4$O. After annealing at 500 \textcelsius $ $ in vacuum for one week, superconductivity is observed with zero resistance at $T_{c0} \approx 17.5$ K, and about 20\% diamagnetic volume down to 2 K. While both the small anisotropy of superconductivity and the temperature dependence of normal state resistivity are akin to the electron doped 122-type compounds, the Hall coefficient is positive and similar to the case in hole-doped Ba$_{0.9}$K$_{0.1}$Fe$_2$As$_2$. The density functional theory calculations suggest dominated hole pockets contributed by Fe/Ti 3$d$ orbitals. Therefore, the Ba(Fe$_{1-x}$Ti$_{x}$)$_2$As$_2$ system provides a new platform to study the superconductivity with hole doping on the Fe site of iron-based superconductors.

Title: Energy-efficient time series processing in real-time with fluidic iontronic memristor circuits
Authors: T. M. Kamsma, Y. Gu, C. Spitoni, M. Dijkstra, Y. Xie, R. van Roij
Abstract: Iontronic neuromorphic computing has emerged as a rapidly expanding paradigm. The arrival of angstrom-confined iontronic devices enables ultra-low power consumption with dynamics and memory timescales that intrinsically align well with signals of natural origin, a challenging combination for conventional (solid-state) neuromorphic materials. However, comparisons to earlier conventional substrates and evaluations of concrete application domains remain a challenge for iontronics. Here we propose a pathway toward iontronic circuits that can address established time series benchmark tasks, enabling performance comparisons and highlighting possible application domains for efficient real-time time series processing. We model a Kirchhoff-governed circuit with iontronic memristors as edges, while the dynamic internal voltages serve as output vector for a linear readout function, during which energy consumption is also logged. All these aspects are integrated into the open-source pyontronics package. Without requiring input encoding or virtual timing mechanisms, our simulations demonstrate prediction performance comparable to various earlier solid-state reservoirs, notably with an exceptionally low energy consumption of over 5 orders of magnitude lower. These results suggest a pathway of iontronic technologies for ultra-low-power real-time neuromorphic computation.

Title: Dielectric formalism of the 2D uniform electron gas at finite temperatures
Authors: Fotios Kalkavouras, Tobias Dornheim, Paul Hamann, Panagiotis Tolias
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of the two-dimensional uniform electron gas (2D-UEG or more commonly 2DEG) at finite temperature, spanning a broad range of densities / coupling strengths ($0.01\le{r}_s\le20$) and temperatures / degeneracy parameters ($0.01\le\Theta= k_B T/E_F \le 10$). Within the self-consistent dielectric formalism, we construct two-dimensional versions of the Singwi-Tosi-Land-Sjölander (STLS) and hypernetted-chain (HNC) approximation based schemes. We benchmark the accuracy of the STLS and the HNC schemes against new state-of-the-art path-integral Monte Carlo data. We also report structural and thermodynamic properties across the full $(r_s,\Theta)$ phase diagram domain studied, identify regimes in which these schemes remain quantitatively reliable, and provide an accurate parametrization of the exchange--correlation free energy of the finite-temperature 2DEG.

Title: Ab initio path-integral Monte Carlo results for the one-particle spectral function of the warm dense electron gas
Authors: Paul Hamann, Michael Bonitz, Jan Vorberger, Tobias Dornheim
Abstract: We compute quasi-exact \emph{ab initio} path-integral Monte Carlo results for the Matsubara Green's function of the uniform electron gas (UEG) at finite temperature over a broad range of coupling strengths ($r_s=1,\dots,10)$. This allows us to present approximation-free results for the static self-energy $\Sigma_\infty(p)$ and spectral function $A(p,\omega)$, and to benchmark previous approximate results for the UEG. In addition, our work opens up intriguing avenues to study the single-particle spectrum and density of states of real warm dense matter systems based on truly first principles.

Title: Self-organized flows break morphological symmetry in active/passive systems
Authors: Rainer Backofen, Axel Voigt
Abstract: We consider a phase-separating mixture of active and passive fluids and explore morphological asymmetries of the emerging dominantly bicontinous dynamic emulsion. Two-dimensional numerical simulations reveal that the geometric and topological asymmetries can solely be explained by self-organized flows in the active region. As in inertial turbulence an inverse energy cascade in the active region leads to the formation of condensates. The size of these mesocales vortices is determined by the locally available space in the emulsion. As these condensates accumulate energy they impact the fluctuation of the surrounding interface and thus form a tight coupling between the flow field and the dynamic morphology. While explored for active/passive systems the symmetry-breaking mechanism can be generalized to heterogeneous active systems and proposes a way to control the morphology of various functional soft materials.

Title: Anomalous Quantum Criticality at a Continuous Metal-Insulator Transition
Authors: M. S. Laad, Prosenjit Haldar
Abstract: The Falicov-Kimball model (FKM) is long known to be the simplest model of correlated fermions exhibiting a novel Mott-like quantum critical point (QCP) assocaited with a {\it continuous} MIT in dimensions $D \geq 3$. It is also known to be isomorphic to an {\it annealed} binary-alloy disorder model. Notwithstanding extensive numerical studies for the FKM, analytic insight into the microscopic processes spawning novel Mott-like quantum criticality is scarce. Here, we develop a fully analytic theory for the Mott-like quantum criticality in the FKM on a hierarchical Cayley tree (Bethe lattice) by utilizing a single input from a 2-site cluster-dynamical mean-field theory (CDMFT). We find that density fluctuation modes acquire anomalous dimensions, originating from infra-red power-law singular cluster self-energies. Interestingly, we uncover, at $T=0$, that this {\it sub-diffusive} metal with glassy dynamics separating a weakly ergodic metal from a non-ergodic insulator shrinks to a single point, namely the Mott-like QCP, at least on the Bethe lattice. We detail the consequences of this anomalous quantum criticality for a range of thermal and dynamical responses in a variety of physical systems that can be effectively modelled by the FKM.

Title: Quasisymmetry Enriched Gapless Criticality at Chern Insulator Transitions
Authors: Jiayu Li, Feng-Ren Fan, Wang Yao
Abstract: In continuous topological phase transitions (CTPTs), the low-energy physics is governed by gap-closing subspaces, where approximate "higher" symmetries, termed quasisymmetries, may emerge. Here, we introduce the notion of quasisymmetry enrichment of these transitions. Focusing on paradigmatic normal-to-Chern insulator transitions, we identify quasisymmetries in the gapless subspaces, which subdivide CTPTs of the same universality class according to quasisymmetry charges. Gapless criticalities with nontrivial charges exhibit regulated phenomena, including intrinsic correlations between charge and pseudospin currents and continuous generalized Hall conductivities governed by the generalized Středa formula, both conventionally exclusive to gapped phases. These features arise as quasisymmetry forbids certain matrix elements, rendering the generalized Berry curvature integrable. By establishing quasisymmetry as a fundamental classifying ingredient, our work adds a new dimension for understanding the rich landscape of quantum phase transitions.

Title: A General Theory of Chiral Splitting of Magnons in Two-Dimensional Magnets
Authors: Yu Xie, Dinghui Wang, Chao Li, Xiaofan Shen, Junting Zhang
Abstract: Magnons in antiferromagnets exhibit two chiral modes, providing an intrinsic degree of freedom for magnon-based computing architectures and spintronic devices. Electrical control of chiral splitting is crucial for applications, but remains challenging. Here, we propose the concept of extrinsic chiral splitting, involving alternating and ferrimagnet-like types, which can be induced and controlled by an electric field. A symmetry framework based on 464 collinear spin layer groups is established to classify chiral splitting characteristics and electric field responses in two-dimensional magnets. We further elucidate how the spin layer group determines the type of alternating chiral splitting and the dominant lowest-order magnetic exchange interaction. We demonstrate electric-field control over the magnitude and sign of the chiral splitting, enabling control of the spin Seebeck and Nernst effects related to thermal spin transport. This work provides a general theory for electric field manipulation of magnon chirality, paving the way for low-power magnonic logic devices.

Title: Coupled gas and bubble dynamics at the solidification front
Authors: Bastien Isabella, Cécile Monteux, Sylvain Deville
Abstract: The formation and entrapment of gas bubbles during solidification significantly influence the microstructure and mechanical properties of materials, from metallic alloys to ice. While gas segregation at the solidification front is well-documented, the real-time dynamics of bubble nucleation, growth, and engulfment-and their dependence on solidification velocity-remain poorly understood. In this study, we use in situ cryo-confocal fluorescence microscopy to investigate the coupled gas-bubble dynamics at the solidification front of carbonated water, systematically varying the solidification velocity ($V = 1-20 \mu m/s$) while maintaining a constant thermal gradient ($G = 15 K/mm$). Our experiments reveal that bubble nucleation is governed by a characteristic nucleation time, which emerges from the interplay between gas diffusion ahead of the front, nucleation kinetics, and bubble growth, all competing with the advancing solidification front. These results allow us to estimate the critical gas concentration for bubbles nucleation in carbonated water. These results offer a detailed understanding of the mechanisms controlling bubble nucleation and entrapment during solidification at constant thermal gradient. They contribute to the development of strategies to control bubble formation in industrial processes where the presence of bubbles can either be detrimental or intentionally harnessed.

Title: Theoretical relationship between the macro-texture and micro-structure in dairy processing revealed by the multi-scale simulation of coupled map lattice
Authors: Erika Nozawa
Abstract: The theoretical relationship between the macroscopic textural quality and microscopic structural quality appearing in the phase inversion processes from fresh cream via whipped cream to butter is revealed by the multi-scale simulation of coupled map lattice (CML) based on the mesoscopic elementary processes of the emulsion interfaces. Using the Young-Laplace equation, we derive the microscopic particle quantities of the size and density of air bubbles and butter grains in an emulsion from the macroscopic rheological quantities of the overrun and viscosity of the emulsion. In doing so, we focus on the size determined by the "tug-of-war" between air bubbles and butter grains via their cohesion pressures, and on the density determined by the "costume change" of the emulsion molecular complexes (clad particles, e.g., butter grain-clad air bubbles) to their suitable size. Using the obtained microscopic particle quantities, we now propose a microscopic state diagram, the size-density plane, in addition to the previously proposed macroscopic state diagram, the viscosity-overrun plane. These state diagrams reveal that while the two well-known different phase inversion processes at high and low whipping temperatures appear as the two parallel processes of viscosity dominance and overrun dominance in the viscosity-overrun plane, they appear as the two orthogonal processes of isodensity/size dominance and isosize/density dominance in the size-density plane. This theoretical simulation result is significant for the quality design of butter because it demonstrates that differences in macroscopic textural quality can be easily controlled by differences in microscopic structural quality.

Title: Resolving the band alignment of InAs/InAsSb mid-wave-infrared type-II superlattices
Authors: Michał Rygała, Julian Zanon, Anderas Bader, Tristan Smołka, Fabian Hartmann, Sven Höfling, Michael Flatté, Marcin Motyka
Abstract: In this work, three InAs/InAs$_{0.65}$Sb$_{0.35}$ superlattices with different periods were investigated using photoluminescence and photoreflectance measurements and their band structure was simulated using a 14 bulk-band kp model. The structures were studied by analyzing the evolution of the spectral features in temperature and excitation power to determine the origin of optical transitions. After identifying which of these are related to the superlattice mini-bands, a rich collection of observed higher-order optical transitions was compared with refractive-index calculations. This procedure was used to adjust the parameters of the theoretical model, namely the bowing parameters of the InAsSb valence band offset and bandgap. It was also shown that the spectroscopy of the higher-order states combined with numerical modeling of the refractive index is a powerful tool for improvement of the material parameters, presenting a new approach to material studies of advanced semiconductor heterostructures.

Title: Weak Electron-Phonon Coupling Is Insufficient to Generate Significant CISS in Two-Terminal Transport
Authors: Vipul Upadhyay, Amikam Levy
Abstract: A central open question in chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS) is whether weak electron-phonon coupling in a helical molecular junction can generate a sizable spin polarization in two-terminal transport without invoking additional strong symmetry-breaking ingredients. We address this question by implementing a self-consistent nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) calculation for a helical tight-binding model with spin-orbit coupling and electron-phonon interactions. The electron-phonon self-energies are evaluated self-consistently, and the transport signal is extracted using the standard magnetization-reversal protocol with a spin-polarized analyzer lead. We benchmark a fully self-consistent NEGF within the self-consistent Born approximation (SCBA) treatment for both global and local electron-phonon couplings against commonly used approximations, including diagonal self-energy schemes. We quantify how the resulting transport regime and spin polarization depend on phonon frequency, coupling strength, bias, temperature, and system size. In contrast to large polarizations and anomalous size trends reported under approximate treatments, the fully self-consistent calculation yields negligible spin polarization, additionally the electron-phonon coupling mainly renormalizes the spectrum, and transport remains quasi-ballistic across the explored parameter range.

Title: Exceptionally High Carrier Mobility in Hexagonal Diamond
Authors: Zirui He, Shang-Peng Gao, Meng Chen
Abstract: Hexagonal diamond (h-diamond), or Lonsdaleite, has been reported to be a wide-bandgap semiconductor with high thermal conductivity and hardness. Our $ab initio$ calculations show that h-diamond has exceptionally high carrier mobility. Along $xy$ and $z$ directions, the hole mobilities at 300 K are 5631 and 5552 cm$^2$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$, and the room-temperature electron mobilities are 11462 and 28464 cm$^2$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$, respectively. These values are superior to the mobility of most known semiconductors including cubic diamond (c-diamond). The small effective masses in h-diamond, comparable to those in c-diamond, cannot explain the mobility difference between the two phases. For holes, scattering induced by transverse acoustic phonons is the predominant mechanism near room temperature in c-diamond, whereas considerably suppressed in d-diamond by selection rules. The high electron mobility in h-diamond can be attributed to the wavefunction at the conduction band minimum, which is extended and distributed primarily in the lattice interstitial, leading to weak coupling with scattering potentials. The temperature dependence of h-diamond is investigated as well, which deviates from the power-law relationship due to the significantly increased occupation of optical modes at elevated temperatures. Consequently, our findings reveal h-diamond as a promising high-mobility semiconductor, and elucidate the microscopic origin in terms of the carrier-phonon scattering mechanisms beyond conventional understandings based on simple parameters such as effective mass.

Title: Stimulated cooling in non-equilibrium Bose-Einstein condensate

Abstract: We report on the experimental observation of stimulated cooling in the non-equilibrium Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of weakly interacting exciton-polaritons from approximately room temperature down to 20K. By resolving the condensate in energy-momentum space and performing interferometric measurements, we distinguish the condensate from thermalized particles yet occupying excited states macroscopically. In contrast to the analytical quantum theories of non-equilibrium BEC [Shishkov et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 128, 065301 (2022)], we observe segmentation of the particle density along the excited states into two fractions both following Bose-Einstein distribution, albeit with different effective temperatures and chemical potentials. Our results indicate that the temperature of the weakly interacting Bose gas is universally set by the density-dependent chemical potential, revealing a defining property of non-equilibrium BECs. Finally, we demonstrate that the stimulated nature of the cooling process directly governs the emergence of quantum coherence of the condensate and shapes the dissipative properties of the excited states.

Title: Stiffness induced structures and morphological transitions in semiflexible polymers
Authors: Biman Bagchi
Abstract: Semiflexible polymers in poor solvents exhibit a rich variety of collapsed morphologies, including globules, toroids, and rodlike bundles, arising from the competition between attractive interactions and chain stiffness. Computer simulations and experiments on stiff and conjugated polymers have revealed complex morphological crossovers, yet a unified theoretical description remains incomplete. Here we develop a coarse-grained, field-theoretic free-energy framework for linear polymers with variable stiffness that captures these morphologies and their transitions within a common description. The theory is built on three key ingredients: a density field describing monomer attraction and excluded-volume effects, a nematic order parameter accounting for orientational ordering in dense regions, and the bending rigidity of a worm-like chain. Using simple variational ansatzes for competing morphologies, we derive analytic expressions for their free energies and identify the boundaries separating coil, globule, toroidal, and rodlike conformational regimes as functions of the reduced attraction strength and the effective persistence length. The resulting phase-diagram topology provides a transparent free-energy-based framework for interpreting morphology diagrams observed in simulations and experiments on semiflexible polymers in poor solvents. We find the possibility of the existence of a triple point involving globules, rods and toroids.

Title: The exact dynamical structure factor of one-dimensional hard rods and its universal random matrix behavior
Authors: Oleksandr Gamayun, Miłosz Panfil
Abstract: We obtain an exact analytic expression for the dynamical structure factor of one-dimensional quantum gas of hard rods. Our result is valid for arbitrary many-body state of the system, with finite temperature states and the ground state being important special cases that we analyse in detail. We demonstrate that the expression obeys fundamental relations such like the f-sum rule and the detailed balance. We also reveal the hidden fermionic structure behind the correlator. In the static limit we show that it can be written in terms of universal functions which, at zero temperature, coincide with the level spacing distribution function of the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble. Our work provides a full and exact characterisation of a dynamic correlation function in a strongly correlated interacting quantum many-body system.

Title: Cooperative stabilization of persistent currents in superfluid ring networks
Authors: Marzena Ciszak, Nicola Grani, Diego Hernandez-Rajkov, Giulia Del Pace, Giacomo Roati, Francesco Marino
Abstract: Cooperative effects in oscillator networks are often associated with enhanced stability of phase-locked solutions, which increases with system size. We show that the stabilization of persistent currents in annular atomic superfluids with periodic barriers is a concrete manifestation of this phenomenon. Under the simplifying assumption of continuity of atomic flow across identical barriers, the system reduces to a ring of locally coupled Kuramoto-like oscillators. We analytically derive the stability diagram of phase-locked configurations and quantify their robustness to noise and small random initial imperfections, finding excellent agreement with experimental observations. These results are inherent to the ring topology and independent of the specific physical platform.

Title: Biphasic Meniscus Coating for Scalable and Material Efficient Quantum Dot Films
Authors: Shlok Joseph Paul, Letian Li, Zheng Li, Andrew Kim, Mia Klopfestein, Stephanie S. Lee, Ayaskanta Sahu
Abstract: Colloidal quantum dots (cQDs) have emerged as a cornerstone of next-generation optoelectronics, offering unparalleled spectral tunability and solution-processability. However, the transition from laboratory-scale devices to sustainable industrial manufacturing is fundamentally hindered by spin-coating workflows, which are intrinsically wasteful and restricted to planar geometries. These limitations are particularly acute for high-performance cQDs containing regulated elements such as lead, cadmium, or mercury, where poor material utilization exacerbates both environmental burden and cost. Here we report a biphasic dip-coating strategy that redefines the material efficiency of nanocrystal film fabrication. By utilizing an immiscible underlayer to displace ~88% of the active reservoir volume, we demonstrate a deposition geometry that decouples material consumption from total precursor volume. Infrared PbS photodetectors fabricated via this approach maintain their performance against spin-coated benchmarks while reducing ink consumption by up to 20-fold. Our technoeconomic analysis reveals that this biphasic architecture achieves cost parity at film thicknesses an order of magnitude lower than conventional monophasic dip-coating. Our results establish a low-waste framework for solution-processed materials, providing a viable pathway for the resource-efficient manufacturing of optoelectronic devices.

Title: Competition between clustering and dispersion of cobalt atoms on perovskite surfaces: SrTiO3(001) and KTaO3(001)
Authors: Aji Alexander, Pankaj Kumar Samal, Llorenc Albons, Jesus Redondo, Jan Skvara, Igor Pis, Lukas Fusek, Josef Myslivecek, Viktor Johanek, Dominik Wrana, Martin Setvin
Abstract: Perovskite oxides are attractive for reactions in photo/electrocatalytic schemes, and extrinsic doping is a common strategy for tuning their properties. It is widely known that extrinsic dopants impact the structure and stability of perovskite surfaces, but an atomic-scale view is missing. Here, noncontact atomic force microscopy (ncAFM) and photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS/PES) are used to combine microscopic and spectroscopic evidence of cobalt adsorption, incorporation, and clustering at surfaces of two prototypical perovskites SrTiO3 and KTaO3. A number of different sub-ML coverages and temperatures of annealing were investigated. Several common features are observed: cobalt shows a strong preference for ionic nature (+2 and +3 charge states), and remains dispersed as single atoms to a certain extent in both perovskites. Two competing mechanisms are observed upon annealing: coalescence into clusters with a mixed metallic/ionic character, and incorporation into the surface and subsurface regions. The latter is more pronounced in SrTiO3, where a cobalt-stabilized surface reconstruction is identified, whereas for KTaO3 cobalt likely incorporates in the near-surface region.

Title: Increasing the stability of a superfluid in a rotating necklace potential
Authors: Giulio Nesti, Luca Pezzè
Abstract: Recent experiments have probed the stability of ring superfluids in the presence of Josephson barriers or Gaussian impurities. Here we present a theoretical analysis that extends beyond the regimes explored so far. We study the onset of dynamical instabilities induced by a one-dimensional potential rotating at an effective angular velocity $\omega$, addressing both the tunneling and the hydrodynamic regimes. We show that the critical angular velocity $\omega_c$ increases almost linearly with the number of barriers, with a slope set by their height and width. When the system is quenched into the dynamically unstable regime, it emits multiple solitons, which can switch or even reverse the direction of circulation. The stabilization mechanism is robust against imperfections of the potential and does not require a perfectly periodic array of barriers. In particular, we find that adding a disordered speckle potential to an ordered array of barriers can further increase $\omega_c$: disorder can therefore make a ring superfluid more resilient to dynamical instabilities.

Title: Trimer Dynamics in Floquet-driven arrays of Rydberg Atoms
Authors: Edoardo Tiburzi, Lorenzo Maffi, Luca Dell'Anna, Marco Di Liberto
Abstract: We analyze the WAHUHA Floquet protocol recently applied to arrays of Rydberg atoms and derive beyond-leading-order corrections in the high-frequency expansion of the effective spin theory. We find that an appropriate choice of the pulses times can enforce an approximate symmetry corresponding to the conservation of the total magnetization. The interaction channels emerging from higher-order Floquet terms affect three-body bound states (\emph{trimers}), which gain a significant mobility. We estimate the corresponding enhancement in 1D spin chains and conclude that their dynamics is within experimental reach. Detrimental effects due to the proliferation of particles outside of the trimer magnetization sector are found to occur and spread on time-scales slower than the trimer propagation. Moreover, these can be suppressed in higher dimensional lattices, e.g. in 2D triangular lattices, as the lattice geometry brings these processes off resonance. Our results establish a concrete route to realizing mobile multiparticle bound states in Floquet-engineered Rydberg platforms.

Title: Assessing Orbital Optimization in Variational and Diffusion Monte Carlo
Authors: Cody A. Melton, Jaron T. Krogel
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the fidelity of orbital optimization in variational Monte Carlo to improve diffusion Monte Carlo results on correlated magnetic systems, using CrSBr as a model system. We compare the performance of different optimization methods, showing that stochastic reconfiguration is a robust and reliable optimizer. We show that short range Jastrow factors are important for improving diffusion Monte Carlo, regardless of the quality of orbitals. Large active spaces are required to converge the variational energy, but ulitmately orbital optimization produces worse diffusion Monte Carlo energies when compared to standard orbitals from density functional theory. We show that this increased bias is due to larger locality errors from the use of pseudopotentials, while the fixed-node error is actually improved by using orbital optimization. Additionally, for observables other than energy, orbital optimization produces a systematically smaller mixed-estimator bias. Ultimately, we believe orbital optimization provides a reliable method to improve variational and pure fixed-node energies as well as lower mixed-estimator bias.

Title: Ultrafast switching of antiferromagnetic order by field-derivative torque
Authors: Pratyay Mukherjee, Ritwik Mondal
Abstract: Control of magnetic order in antiferromagnets is a central challenge in the development of next-generation spintronic devices. Here, we propose and analyze magnetization switching driven by the field-derivative torque, a torque that originates from the time-derivative of an applied THz pulse acting on the staggered order parameter. Using atomistic spin simulations, we show that the field-derivative torque couples efficiently to the Néel vector, enabling deterministic switching without net spin accumulation. Further, we show that using the circularly polarised THz pulse, the FDT-induced magnetization switching reduces the required THz magnetic field by two-fold. To this end, we compute the switching and non-switching areas as a function of THz pulse width, THz magnetic field, and damping of the antiferromagnetic material. We find that the switching and non-switching areas are completely deterministic in antiferromagnets. Moreover, the switching area increases by about 55% when the FDT is considered.

Title: Direct Observation of Antimagnons with Inverted Dispersion

Abstract: We report direct spectroscopic evidence of antimagnons, i.e., negative-energy spin waves identified by their signature inverted dispersion with Brillouin light scattering (BLS) spectroscopy. We investigate an ultrathin BiYIG film with a perpendicular magnetized anisotropy that compensates the demagnetizing field. By injecting a spin-orbit torque, the magnetization is driven into auto-oscillation and eventually into a non-equilibrium reversed state above a secondary current threshold ($\sim$1.2$\times$10$^7$~A/cm$^2$). The dispersion is measured by wavevector-resolved BLS and exhibits a sharp change from an upward dispersion to a downward one, in agreement with theoretical predictions and micromagnetic simulations. Around the threshold current, we observe the coexistence of conventional magnons and antimagnons. Our work establishes antimagnons with inverted dispersion and is a first step towards exploring novel phenomena and applications due to magnon-antimagnon coupling, such as magnon amplification and magnon-antimagnon entanglement, which are part of the emerging field of antimagnonics.

Title: Inverse Reconstruction of Moving Contact Loads on an Elastic Half-Space Using Prescribed Surface Displacement
Authors: Satoshi Takada, Yosuke Mori, Shintaro Hokada
Abstract: This study investigates the elastic response of a two-dimensional semi-infinite medium subjected to a moving surface load with a prescribed displacement profile. As a fundamental step, we derive analytical Green's functions for the displacement and stress fields generated by a point load traveling at a constant velocity along the surface, explicitly incorporating elastodynamic effects through Mach number dependence. These moving-load solutions serve as building blocks for constructing more general loading scenarios via linear superposition. Based on Green's functions, an inverse problem is formulated to reconstruct the unknown surface traction responsible for a given surface displacement. The inverse analysis is performed through a Fourier-domain inversion with regularization, which enables a direct and computationally efficient determination of the contact pressure without iterative forward simulations. This framework is applied to a rigid wheel-ground contact problem, where the imposed displacement is dictated by the wheel geometry. The reconstructed surface traction exhibits a smooth, symmetric distribution within the contact region, while the resulting subsurface stress fields are obtained in closed analytical form and involve dilogarithm functions. The principal stress difference reveals characteristic spatial patterns similar to photoelastic fringes, and their asymmetry increases with the Mach number, reflecting the dynamic nature of the moving contact.

Title: Information transport and transport-induced entanglement in open fermion chains
Authors: Andrea Nava, Claudia Artiaco, Yuval Gefen, Igor Gornyi, Mikheil Tsitsishvili, Alex Zazunov, Reinhold Egger
Abstract: Understanding the entanglement dynamics in quantum many-body systems under steady-state transport conditions is an actively pursued challenging topic. Hydrodynamic equations, akin to transport equations for charge or heat, would be of great interest but face severe challenges because of the inherent nonlocality of entanglement and the difficulty of identifying conservation laws. We show that progress is facilitated by using information as key quantity related to - but distinct from - entanglement. Employing the recently developed "information lattice" framework, we characterize spatially and scale-resolved information currents in nonequilibrium open quantum systems. Specifically, using Lindblad master equations, we consider noninteracting fermion chains coupled to dissipative reservoirs. By relating the information lattice to a noise lattice constructed from particle-number fluctuations, we show that information is experimentally accessible via noise easurements. Similarly, local information currents can be obtained by measuring particle currents, onsite occupations, and covariances of particle numbers and/or particle currents. Using the fermionic negativity to quantify bipartite entanglement, we also study transport-induced entanglement and its relation to information currents. For a clean particle-hole symmetric chain, we find that information currents are shielded from entering the information lattice. Impurities or particle-hole asymmetry break this effect, causing information current flow and entanglement between end segments of the chain. Our work opens the door to systematic investigations of information transport and entanglement generation in driven open quantum systems far from equilibrium.

Title: Evolution of Vortex Strings after a Thermal Quench in a Holographic Superfluid
Authors: Chuan-Yin Xia, András Grabarits, Hua-Bi Zeng, Adolfo del Campo
Abstract: The formation of topological defects during continuous phase transitions exhibits nonequilibrium universality. While the Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM) predicts universal scaling of point-like defect numbers under slow driving, the statistical properties of extended defects remain largely unexplored across both slow and fast protocols. We investigate vortex string formation in a three-dimensional holographic superfluid. For slow quenches, the vortex string number follows KZM scaling, while for rapid quenches, it exhibits complementary universal scaling governed by the final temperature. Beyond the vortex string number, the loop-length distribution reveals a richer structure: individual loops follow the first-return statistics of three-dimensional random walks, $P(\ell) \sim \ell^{-5/2}$. While the total vortex length distribution remains Gaussian, its cumulants obey universal scaling laws with varying power-law exponents, and thus differ markedly from those observed in point-defect systems, indicating distinct statistical features of extended topological defects.

Title: Exactly Solvable 1+1d Chiral Lattice Gauge Theories
Authors: Sahand Seifnashri
Abstract: Using the modified Villain lattice Hamiltonian formulation of the 1+1d compact boson theory, we construct exactly solvable abelian chiral lattice gauge theories in two spacetime dimensions. As a concrete example, we derive an explicit quadratic lattice Hamiltonian for the "34-50" chiral gauge theory. We further show that $N$ copies of the modified Villain theory realize the $O(N,N;\mathbb{Z})$ T-duality transformations, which we then use to solve and analyze these lattice gauge theories.

Title: Vanishing correlations in (bi)stochastic controlled circuits
Authors: Pavel Kos, Bruno Bertini, Tomaž Prosen
Abstract: We study the dynamics of circuits composed of stochastic and bistochastic controlled gates. This type of dynamics arises from quantum circuits with random controlled gates, as well as in stochastic circuits and deterministic classical cellular automata. We prove that stochastic and bistochastic controlled gates lead to two-point spatio-temporal correlation functions that vanish everywhere except when the two operators act on the same site. More generally, for multi-point correlations the two rightmost operators must act on the same site. We argue that autocorrelation, while hard to compute, typically decays exponentially towards a value that is exponentially small in the system size. Our results reveal a broad class of quantum systems that exhibit surprisingly simple correlation structures despite their complex microscopic dynamics.

Title: Vacuum Torque Without Anisotropy: Switchable Casimir Torque Between Altermagnets
Authors: Zixuan Dai, Qing-Dong Jiang
Abstract: Casimir torque is conventionally associated with explicit breaking of rotational symmetry, arising from material dielectric anisotropy, geometric asymmetry, or externally applied fields that themselves break rotational invariance. Here we demonstrate a fundamentally different mechanism: an axially symmetric magnetic field can generate a Casimir torque by inducing an axially asymmetric Casimir energy - and can even reverse the torque's sign. Focusing on two-dimensional altermagnets, we show that a magnetic field applied perpendicular to the plane - while preserving in-plane rotational symmetry - activates an orientation-dependent vacuum interaction through the combined crystalline symmetry $\mathrm{C_n T}$ inherent to altermagnetic order. The resulting torque emerges continuously and scales quadratically with the magnetic field strength. We further analyze its temperature and distance dependence, revealing scaling behaviors that are qualitatively different from those found in uniaxial bulk materials. Our results identify time-reversal symmetry breaking as a powerful route for engineering both the sign and strength of Casimir torque and establish altermagnets as an exciting platform for exploring phenomena driven by vacuum quantum fluctuations.

Title: Acoustic phonons in a magnetized vacuum? First-principle lattice results on the mass spectrum of the electroweak model in a strong magnetic field
Authors: M. N. Chernodub, V. A. Goy, A. V. Molochkov
Abstract: We use numerical Monte Carlo simulations to determine the mass spectrum of the bosonic sector of the electroweak model in an external magnetic field of the electroweak-scale strength ($10^{20}\,{\rm T}$) at zero temperature. It is known that as the magnetic field gets stronger, the electroweak vacuum undergoes two consecutive crossover-type transitions, passing from (i) the conventional symmetry-broken homogeneous phase to (ii) an intermediate inhomogeneous vortex phase characterized by a (superconducting) condensate of electrically charged $W$ bosons and then to (iii) a homogeneous phase with a restored electroweak symmetry. We show that the spin component of the $W$ boson aligned with the direction of the magnetic field is the lightest excitation in all three phases. Its mass continuously decreases in the low-field broken phase and becomes very small in the intermediate phase. We argue that this nearly massless excitation corresponds to a Goldstone acoustic phonon mode associated with vibrations of the lattice of electroweak vortices. In the high-field symmetry-restored phase, where the vortices disappear, the lightest $W$ mass rises again. Neither Higgs nor $Z$ boson masses vanish across all studied phases and crossover transitions.

Title: The missing links: Evaluating contact tracing with incomplete data in large metropolitan areas during an epidemic
Authors: Min-Kyung Chae, Woo-Sik Son, Sang Hoon Lee
Abstract: Contact tracing (CT) plays a pivotal role in controlling early epidemic spread, particularly when a novel infectious disease emerges. However, the quantitative impact of missing information -- such as untraced cases or unnotified contacts -- on the effectiveness of CT remains insufficiently understood. Using a stochastic agent-based model with sociodemographics from metropolitan areas in South Korea, we simulate how different forms of information loss affect epidemic spreading dynamics. We construct information-loss scenarios based on two types: infector-omission (IO) and contact-omission (CO), including selective (SCO) and uniform (UCO) scenarios; IO corresponds to the omission of infected individuals (nodes) from the tracing process, leading to the loss of all movement trajectories and downstream transmission links originating from them, whereas CO corresponds to the omission of specific contact events (edges), in which infected individuals are identified but some of their transmission links fail to be detected or notified. The sensitivity of epidemic dynamics to increasing omission rates differs markedly between the two types: IO scenarios exhibit substantially stronger and more abrupt changes in transmission structure and epidemic outcomes, whereas CO scenarios produce more gradual effects. In both scenarios, the magnitude of these effects varies across cities, with a lower-population city (Busan) showing greater tolerance to information loss than the largest city (Seoul), underscoring the importance of regional tailoring in CT strategies. Both IO and CO scenarios also lead to an increase in the transmission network diameter as information loss grows, indicating that a small network diameter reflects effective contact tracing that limits the depth of transmission chains.

Title: Dosimetry for Proton Therapy Using a β-Ga$_2$O$_3$ Metal-Semiconductor-Metal Detector with Low-Noise Amplification
Authors: Hunter D. Ellis, Ajayvarman Mallapillai, Jared Miller, Imteaz Rahaman, Botong Li, Vikren Sarkar, Kai Fu
Abstract: Intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) employs proton radiation rather than conventional X-rays to treat cancerous tumors. This approach offers significant advantages by minimizing the radiation exposure of surrounding healthy tissue, leading to improved patient outcomes and reduced side effects compared to traditional X-ray therapy. To ensure patient safety, each treatment plan must be experimentally validated before clinical implementation. However, current dosimetry devices face limitations in performing angled beam measurements and obtaining multi-depth assessments, both of which are essential for verifying IMPT treatment plans. In this study, the performance of a \beta-Ga$_2$O$_3$-based metal-semiconductor-metal (MSM) detector with a low-noise amplifier is studied and evaluated under various proton radiation doses and energy levels delivered by a MEVION S250i proton accelerator. The detector performance is also compared with that of an ionization chamber. The \beta-Ga$_2$O$_3$ detector exhibits a linear response with proton dose for single-spot irradiations, and its response to varying proton energies closely matches both the ion chamber data and simulated dose distributions. These findings highlight the potential of \beta-Ga$_2$O$_3$-based detectors as robust dosimetry devices for IMPT applications.

Title: Transient Pauli blocking in a InN film as a mechanism for broadband ultrafast optical switching
Authors: Junjun Jia, Minseok Kim, Yuzo Shigesato, Ryotaro Nakazawa, Keisuke Fukutani, Satoshi Kera, Toshiki Makimoto, Takashi Yagi
Abstract: The transient Pauli blocking effect offers a promising route for achieving ultrafast optical switching in semiconductors, enabling a rapid switching from an initially opaque state to a relatively transparent state upon photoexcitation. Herein, we demonstrate broadband ultrafast optical switching in degenerate InN thin films, spanning the visible to near-infrared spectral range, using pump-probe transient transmittance measurements. To elucidate the underlying physical mechanism, we perform probe-energy-resolved analysis for ultrafast dynamics, and develop a theoretical model based on a quasi-equilibrium Fermi-Dirac distribution. The model successfully captures the experimental transients and yields an electron-phonon coupling constant of $1.0\times10^{17}\,\mathrm{W\,m^{-3}\,K^{-1}}$, along with an electronic specific heat coefficient ranging from 1.52 to 2.02 $\mathrm{mJ\,mol^{-1}\,K^{-2}}$, which allow direct prediction of the spectral switching window. Notably, we demonstrate that the Pauli blocking effect can be induced solely by a laser-excitation driven rise in electronic temperature, without requiring significant carrier injection into the conduction band in degenerate semiconductors. These findings offer new insights for designing ultrafast optical modulators, shutters, and photonic devices for next-generation communication and computing technologies.

Title: Light propagation in atomic stratified media: breakdown of the transfer-matrix method at high density
Authors: Igor M. Sokolov, William Guerin
Abstract: The transfer-matrix method is a standard approach to wave propagation in stratified media. With the advent of cold-atom-based quantum and photonic technologies, several experiments and many proposals consider light propagation in one-dimensional optical lattices, using the transfer matrices as the main tool for the simulation. Here, we study the validity of this method by comparing its results to the microscopic coupled-dipole model, which is exact in the linear-optics regime. We show that the transfer-matrix method works very well at low density, even for thin disordered slices, and breaks down at high density because the dipole-dipole interaction induces a collective response from the atoms such that the properties of one layer are influenced by the others. We determine the boundary values of atomic densities for which this method is still applicable for describing experiments. Our findings are relevant for experimental realizations using ultra-cold atoms.

Title: Physicochemical properties of lunar regolith simulant for in situ oxygen production
Authors: Alyssa Ang De Guzman, Anish Mathai Varghese, Saif Alshalloudi, Lance Kosca, Kyriaki Polychronopoulou, Marko Gacesa
Abstract: Permanent lunar settlements will rely on in situ oxygen production from regolith for life support and propulsion. While oxygen is abundant in lunar materials, it is chemically bound within metal oxides whose extractability depends strongly on regolith composition and processing strategy. In this study, we validate and characterize high-fidelity lunar regolith simulants representative of the lunar highlands and south pole using scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area and pore structure analysis, and hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction. The simulants exhibit strong mineralogical and compositional fidelity to returned Apollo and Chang'e samples, with ilmenite confirmed as the most readily reducible oxygen-bearing phase. However, despite low ilmenite abundance, bulk highland simulants display favorable reduction behavior arising from distributed Fe-bearing silicate and glassy phases, as well as surface and microstructural properties that influence gas-solid interactions. Adsorption experiments with gases (H2, CH4, and CO2) and water indicate that mineralogical heterogeneity and pore accessibility influence their uptake in simulants. These results indicate that oxygen extraction behavior in realistic lunar regolith is governed by whole-regolith response rather than ilmenite content alone, supporting the option of whole-regolith processing strategies for oxygen production in lunar in situ resource utilization architectures.

Title: Kerr-enhanced amplification of three-wave mixing and emergent masing regimes
Authors: Ragheed Alhyder, Rishabh Sahu, Johannes M. Fink, Mikhail Lemeshko, Georgios M. Koutentakis
Abstract: Integrated optical microresonators exploiting either second-order ($\chi^{(2)}$) or third-order ($\chi^{(3)}$) nonlinearities have become key platforms for frequency conversion, low-noise microwave photonics, and quantum entanglement generation. Here, we present an analytic theory of Kerr-enhanced three-wave mixing amplification in an electro-optic microresonator with both $\chi^{(2)}$ and $\chi^{(3)}$ nonlinearities. We demonstrate that Kerr dressing hybridizes the optical sidebands, renormalizing the $\chi^{(2)}$ couplings and detunings. As a result the system exhibits gain in regions where analogous bare $\chi^{(2)}$ or $\chi^{(3)}$ amplifiers are subthreshold. Time-domain Langevin simulations confirm this threshold reduction, mapping a practical design window for experiments.

Title: On the testing of grain shape corrections to bedload transport equations with grain-resolved numerical simulations
Authors: Yulan Chen, Orencio Durán, Thomas Pähtz
Abstract: Using grain-resolved LES-DEM simulations, Zhang et al. (J. Geophys. Res. Earth Surf. 130, e2024JF007937, 2025) aimed to validate a grain-shape-corrected bedload transport equation proposed earlier by the same group. It states that grain shape effects are captured through a modified Shields number that depends, among others, on the drag coefficient, $C_{D_\mathrm{settle}}$, determined from the force balance for a grain settling in a fluid at rest. To independently vary $C_{D_\mathrm{settle}}$ in their simulations, the authors changed the boundary conditions on the grains' surfaces: By artificially shifting the locations of the no-slip conditions from the actual grain surface to a virtual surface a distance $l$ into the grain interior, they hoped to well approximate Navier-slip conditions with a slip length $l$. Here, we argue that this approximation is appropriate only if the thickness of the boundary layer that forms around the virtual surface is much larger than $l$, which we demonstrate was not the case for the authors' simulations. In particular, using independent DNS-DEM grain settling simulations for the same hydrodynamic conditions, we directly show that this approximation substantially overestimates the value of $C_{D_\mathrm{settle}}$ of a Navier-slip sphere. This implies that the conditions created with their artificial method do not correspond to physically realistic scenarios and therefore do not support the authors' grain shape correction. To support this conclusion, we demonstrate that their entire numerical data can be alternatively explained by a simple null hypothesis model, without grain shape correction, based on the virtual-grain rather than the actual-grain size.

Title: Resonant Excitation Induced Vibronic Mollow Triplets
Authors: Devashish Pandey, Corne Koks, Martijn Wubs, Nicolas Stenger, Jake Iles-Smith
Abstract: The Mollow triplet is the definitive spectral signature of an optically dressed quantum emitter. We predict that for emitters coupled to localized phonons, this signature is not confined to the zero-phonon line. Under a strong resonant drive, we show that Mollow triplets are strikingly replicated on the associated phonon sidebands -a surprising result, given that phonon sidebands are typically viewed as incoherent, inelastic scattering pathways. These vibronic Mollow triplets are a direct fingerprint of dynamically generated dressed states that hybridize the emitter's electronic, photonic, and vibrational degrees of freedom. We develop a scalable analytical formalism to model this effect in complex, multi-mode molecular systems, such as dibenzoterrylene. Our work provides the precise driving conditions for observing these novel spectral features, establishing a new signature of coherence in vibronically coupled systems.

Title: Two-Qubit Spin-Boson Model in the Strong Coupling Regime: Coherence, Non-Markovianity, and Quantum Thermodynamics
Authors: Hasan Mehdi Rizvi, Devvrat Tiwari, Subhashish Banerjee
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of a two-qubit open quantum system, in particular the two-qubit spin-boson model in the strong coupling regime, coupled to two thermal bosonic baths under non-Markovian and non-equilibrium conditions. Two complementary approaches, the Hierarchical Equations of Motion (HEOM) and Reaction Coordinate Mapping (RCM), are employed to examine various coupling regimes between the qubits and their respective baths. The dynamical features of the model and the impact of the tunneling amplitude on quantum coherence of the system are probed using the $l_1$-norm of coherence. The model is further shown to have non-Markovian evolution. The nontrivial task of calculating entropy production in the strong-coupling regime is performed using auxiliary density operators in HEOM. Motivated by the realization of a quantum thermal device in the strong-coupling regime, the non-equilibrium steady-state behavior of the system is investigated. Furthermore, the relationship between the heat and spin currents and the tunneling amplitude is probed.

Title: Critical and multicritical Lee-Yang fixed points in the local potential approximation
Authors: Dario Benedetti, Fanny Eustachon, Omar Zanusso
Abstract: The multicritical generalizations of the Lee-Yang universality class arise as renormalization-group fixed points of scalar field theories with complex $i\varphi^{2n+1}$ interaction, $n\in\mathbb{N}$, just below their upper critical dimension. It has been recently conjectured that their continuation to two dimensions corresponds to the non-unitary conformal minimal models $\mathcal{M}(2,2n+3)$. Motivated by that, we revisit the functional renormalization group approach to complex $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$-symmetric scalar field theories in the Local Potential Approximation, without or with wavefunction renormalization (LPA and LPA' respectively), aiming to explore the fate of the $i\varphi^{2n+1}$ theories from their upper critical dimension to two dimensions. The $i\varphi^{2n+1}$ fixed points are identified using a perturbative expansion of the functional fixed-point equation near their upper critical dimensions, and they are followed to lower dimensions by numerical integration of the full equation. A peculiar feature of the complex $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$-symmetric potentials is that the fixed points are characterized by real but negative anomalous dimensions $\eta$, and in low dimension $d$, this can lead to a change of sign of the scaling dimensions $\Delta=(d-2+\eta)/2$, thus requiring a novel analysis of the analytical properties of the functional fixed-point equations. We are able to follow the Lee-Yang universality class ($n=1$) down to two dimensions, and numerically determine the scaling dimension of the fundamental field as a function of $d$. On the other hand, within the LPA', multicritical Lee-Yang fixed points with $n>1$ cannot be continued to $d=2$ due to the existence of unexpected non-perturbative fixed points that annihilate with the $i\varphi^{2n+1}$ fixed points.

Title: Entropy of Soft Random Geometric Graphs in General Geometries
Authors: Oliver Baker, Carl P. Dettmann
Abstract: We study the effect of the choice of embedding geometry on the entropy of random geometric graph ensembles with soft connection functions. First we show that when the connection range is small, the entropy is dependent only on the dimension of the geometry and not the shape, but for large connection ranges the boundaries of the domain matter. Next, we formulate the problem of estimating entropy as a problem of estimating the average degree of a graph with the binary entropy function as its connection function. We use this formulation to study the effect of boundaries on the entropy, and to estimate the entropy of soft random geometric graphs in complicated geometries where a closed form pair distance density is not available.

Title: Learning minimal representations of stochastic processes with variational autoencoders
Authors: Gabriel Fernández-Fernández, Carlo Manzo, Maciej Lewenstein, Alexandre Dauphin, Gorka Muñoz-Gil
Abstract: Stochastic processes have found numerous applications in science, as they are broadly used to model a variety of natural phenomena. Due to their intrinsic randomness and uncertainty, they are, however, difficult to characterize. Here, we introduce an unsupervised machine learning approach to determine the minimal set of parameters required to effectively describe the dynamics of a stochastic process. Our method builds upon an extended $\beta$-variational autoencoder architecture. By means of simulated datasets corresponding to paradigmatic diffusion models, we showcase its effectiveness in extracting the minimal relevant parameters that accurately describe these dynamics. Furthermore, the method enables the generation of new trajectories that faithfully replicate the expected stochastic behavior. Overall, our approach enables the autonomous discovery of unknown parameters describing stochastic processes, hence enhancing our comprehension of complex phenomena across various fields.

Title: Linear and Non-Linear Response of Quadratic Lindbladians
Authors: Spenser Talkington, Martin Claassen
Abstract: Quadratic Lindbladians encompass a rich class of dissipative electronic and bosonic quantum systems, which have been predicted to host new and exotic physics. In this study, we develop a Lindblad-Keldysh spectroscopic response formalism for open quantum systems that elucidates their steady-state response properties and dissipative phase transitions via finite-frequency linear and non-linear probes. As illustrative examples, we utilize this formalism to calculate the (1) density and dynamic spin susceptibilities of a boundary driven XY model at and near criticality, (2) linear and non-linear optical responses in Bernal bilayer graphene coupled to dissipative leads, and (3) steady state susceptibilities in a bosonic optical lattice. We find that the XY model spin density wavelength diverges with critical exponent 1/2, and there are gapless dispersive modes in the dynamic spin response that originate from the underlying spin density wave order; additionally the dispersing modes of the weak and ultra-strong dissipation limits exhibit a striking correspondence since the boundary dissipators couple only weakly to the bulk in both cases. In the optical response of the Bernal bilayer, we find that the diamagnetic response can decrease with increasing occupation, as opposed to in closed systems where the response increases monotonically with occupation; we study the effect of second harmonic generation and shift current and find that these responses, forbidden in centrosymmetric closed systems, can manifest in these open systems as a result of dissipation. We compare this formalism to its equilibrium counterpart and draw analogies between these non-interacting open systems and strongly interacting closed systems.

Title: Generalised BBGKY hierarchy for near-integrable dynamics
Authors: Leonardo Biagetti, Maciej Lebek, Milosz Panfil, Jacopo De Nardis
Abstract: We study quantum and classical many-body Hamiltonian systems that combine integrable contact interactions with generic long-range two-body potentials. We show that the dynamics of local observables can be cast into a generalized Bogoliubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon (gBBGKY) hierarchy formulated in terms of the quasiparticle densities of the underlying integrable model and their correlations. Starting from an ansatz for the state at time $t$, which we call the correlated fluid-cell ensemble, we derive this hierarchy and prove that it reproduces exactly the time evolution of one- and multi-point correlation functions in perturbed integrable models, at all times. We validate these predictions against microscopic molecular-dynamics simulations, finding perfect agreement. At late times, the one-particle distribution relaxes via a Boltzmann-type scattering integral encoding the interplay between integrable contact processes and long-range collisions, whereas higher-point correlations remain strongly non-thermal on thermalization time scales, indicative of a form of incomplete or generalised thermalisation. Focusing on long-range dipolar quantum gases, where the relevant matrix elements can be obtained explicitly, we show that our collision integral reduces exactly to the Fermi golden rule result and provide a complete theoretical account of the experimental observations of Tang et al. (Phys.Rev.X 8, 021030 (2018)). More broadly, our framework extends the BBGKY program to regimes with strong local interactions, and applies to a wide class of experimentally relevant systems, from one-dimensional dipolar cold-atom gases to Lennard-Jones molecular fluids.

Title: Turbulence and far-from-equilibrium equation of state of Bogoliubov waves in Bose-Einstein Condensates
Authors: Ying Zhu, Giorgio Krstulovic, Sergey Nazarenko
Abstract: Bogoliubov waves are fundamental excitations of Bose-Einstein Condensates (BECs). They emerge from a perturbed ground state and interact nonlinearly, triggering turbulent cascades. Here, we study turbulent BECs theoretically and numerically using the 3D Gross-Pitaevskii model and its associated wave-kinetic equations. We derive a new Kolmogorov-like stationary spectrum for short Bogoliubov waves and find a complete analytical expression for the spectrum in the long-wave acoustic regime. We then use our predictions to explain the BEC equation of state reported in [Dora et al. Nature 620,521 (2023)], and to suggest new experimental settings.

Title: An Explicit Wavefunction of the Interacting Non-Hermitian Spin-1/2 1D System
Authors: Yue Wang, Xiangyu Zhang, Zhesen Yang, Congjun Wu
Abstract: We present an explicit Bethe-ansatz wavefunction to a 1D spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ interacting fermion system, manifesting a many-body resonance resulting from the interplay between interaction and non-Hermitian spin-orbit coupling. In the dilute limit, the Bethe-ansatz wavefunction is factorized into Slater determinants and a Jastrow factor. An effective thermodynamic distribution is constructed with an effective Hamiltonian including a repulsion resulting from Pauli's exclusion principle and a distinctive zigzag potential arising from the resonance. The competition between these effects leads to a transition from a uniformly distributed configuration to a phase separation. Clustering of particles with identical spins is observed in the latter phase, demonstrating that the many-body resonance effect is enhanced by the repulsive interaction.

Title: Buried Dirac points in quantum spin Hall insulators: Implications for Majorana Kramers pair-based quantum computing
Authors: Joseph J. Cuozzo, Wenlong Yu, Xiaoyan Shi, Aaron J. Muhowski, Samuel D. Hawkins, John F. Klem, Enrico Rossi, Wei Pan
Abstract: For heterostructures formed by a quantum spin Hall insulator (QSHI) placed in proximity to a superconductor (SC), no external magnetic field is necessary to drive the system into a phase supporting topological superconductivity with Majorana zero energy states, making them very attractive for the realization of non-Abelian states and fault-tolerant qubits. Despite considerable work investigating QSHI edge states, there is still an open question about their resilience to large magnetic fields and the implication of such resilience for the formation of a quasi-1D topological superconducting state. In this work, we investigate the transport properties of helical edge states in a QSHI-SC junction formed by a InAs/GaSb (15nm/5nm) double quantum well and a superconducting tantalum (Ta) constriction. We observe a robust conductance plateau up to 2 T, signaling resilient edge state transport. Such resilience is consistent with the Dirac point for the edge states being buried in the bulk valence band. Using a modified Landauer-Buttiker analysis, we find that the conductance is consistent with 98% Andreev reflection probability owing to the high transparency of the InAs/GaSb-Ta interface. We further theoretically show that a buried Dirac point does not affect the robustness of the quasi-1D topological superconducting phase, and favors the hybridization of Majorana Kramer pairs and fermionic modes in the QSHI resulting in extended MKP states, highlighting the subtle role of buried Dirac points in probing MKPs.

Title: Broken intrinsic symmetry induced magnon-magnon coupling in synthetic ferrimagnets
Authors: Mohammad Tomal Hossain, Hang Chen, Subhash Bhatt, Mojtaba Taghipour Kaffash, Mitra M. Subedi, John Q. Xiao, Joseph Sklenar, M. Benjamin Jungfleisch
Abstract: Synthetic antiferromagnets offer rich magnon energy spectra in which optical and acoustic magnon branches can hybridize. Here, we demonstrate a broken intrinsic symmetry induced coupling of acoustic and optical magnons in a synthetic ferrimagnet consisting of two dissimilar antiferromagnetically interacting ferromagnetic metals. Two distinct magnon modes hybridize at degeneracy points, as indicated by an avoided level-crossing. The avoided level-crossing gap depends on the interlayer exchange interaction between the magnetic layers, which can be controlled by adjusting the non-magnetic interlayer thickness. A large avoided level crossing gap of 3.9 GHz is revealed, exceeding the coupling strength that is typically found in other magnonic hybrid systems based on a coupling of magnons with photons or magnons with phonons.

Title: Exactly solvable models for fermionic symmetry-enriched topological phases and fermionic 't Hooft anomaly
Authors: Jing-Ren Zhou, Zheng-Cheng Gu
Abstract: The interplay between symmetry and topological properties plays a very important role in modern physics. In the past decade, the concept of symmetry-enriched topological (SET) phases was proposed and their classifications have been systematically studied for bosonic systems. Very recently, the concept of SET phases has been generalized into fermionic systems and their corresponding classification schemes are also proposed. Nevertheless, how to realize all these fermionic SET (fSET) phases in lattice models remains to be a difficult open problem. In this paper, we first construct exactly solvable models for non-anomalous non-chiral 2+1D fSET phases, namely, the symmetry-enriched fermionic string-net models, which are described by commuting-projector Hamiltonians whose ground states are the fixed-point wavefunctions of each fSET phase. Mathematically, we provide a partial definition to $G$-graded super fusion category, which is the input data of a symmetry-enriched fermionic string-net model. Next, we construct exactly solvable models for non-chiral 2+1D fSET phases with 't Hooft anomaly, especially the $H^3(G,\mathbb{Z}_2)$ fermionic 't Hooft anomaly which is different from the well known bosonic $H^4(G,U(1)_T)$ anomaly. In our construction, this $H^3(G,\mathbb{Z}_2)$ fermionic 't Hooft anomaly is characterized by a violation of fermion-parity conservation in some of the surface ${F}$-moves (a kind of renormalization moves for the ground state wavefunctions of surface SET phases), and also by a new fermionic obstruction $\Theta$ in the surface pentagon equation. We demonstrate this construction in a concrete example that the surface topological order is a $\mathbb{Z}_4$ gauge theory embedded into a fermion system and the total symmetry $G^f=\mathbb{Z}_2^f\times\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_4$.

Title: Strong and weak wave turbulence regimes in Bose-Einstein condensates
Authors: Ying Zhu, Giorgio Krstulovic, Sergey Nazarenko
Abstract: When a turbulent Bose-Einstein condensate is driven out-of-equilibrium at a scale much smaller than the system size, nonlinear wave interactions transfer particles towards large scales in an inverse cascade process. In this work, we study numerically wave turbulence in a three-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate in forced and dissipated inverse cascade settings. We observe that when the forcing rate increases, thereby increasing the particle flux, the turbulence spectrum gradually transitions from the weak-wave Kolmogorov-Zakharov cascade to a critical balance state characterized by a range of scales with balanced linear and nonlinear dynamic timescales. Further forcing increases lead to a coherent condensate component superimposed with Bogoliubov-type acoustic turbulence. The role of vortices in such a strongly forced state is marginal, which makes this new state very different from the strongly turbulent state composed of a tangle of quantized vortex lines. We then use our predictions and numerical data to formulate a new out-of-equilibrium equation of state for the 3D inverse cascade.

Title: Bubble growth in a confined heated polymer: the example of safety glass
Authors: Carlos Arauz-Moreno, Keyvan Piroird, Elise Lorenceau
Abstract: Laminated safety glass (LSG) is a composite assembly of glass and polyvinyl butyral (PVB), a viscoelastic polymer. LSG can be found in building facades, important landmarks around the world, and every major form of transportation. Yet, the assembly suffers from unwanted bubbles which are anathema to one of the most important features of glass: optical transparency. In here, we present an in-depth study of the reasons behind these bubbles, either during high-temperature quality control tests or normal glass operating conditions. We provide a physical model for bubble growth that deals with two gases, thermal effects on gas solubility and diffusivity, and a time-temperature dependent rheology. The model can be extended to n-component bubbles or other materials beyond PVB. By combining experiments and theory, we show that two gases are at play: air trapped in interfacial bubbles in the assembly during lamination and water initially dissolved in the polymer bulk. Both gases work in tandem to induce bubble growth in finished assemblies of LSG provided that (i) the original bubble nucleus has a critical size and (ii) the polymer relaxes (softens) sufficiently enough, especially at elevated temperatures. The latter constraints are relaxed in a condition we termed anomalous air oversaturation that may even trigger a catastrophic, yet beautiful ice flower instability.

Title: Inferring intermediate states by leveraging the many-body Arrhenius law
Authors: Vishwajeet Kumar, Arnab Pal, Ohad Shpielberg
Abstract: Metastable states appear as long-lived intermediate states in various natural transport phenomena which are governed by energy landscapes. As such, these intermediate metastable states dominate the system's dynamics at coarse grained times. Moreover, they can strongly influence the overall pathways through which the energy landscape is explored. Thus, quantifying these metastabilities is crucial for uncovering the key details of the underlying landscape. Here, we introduce a robust method based on a generalized many-body Arrhenius law to identify metastable states in escape problems involving interacting particles with excluded volume. Experimental platforms such as colloidal transport or macromolecular translocation through biological pores can offer promising settings to validate our predictions.

Title: Defect-modified acoustic phonons in a single layer of MoS2

Abstract: The thermal, mechanical, and electronic performance of atomically thin semiconductors is governed by their low-energy phonons, yet the impact of atomic-scale disorder on these modes remains poorly understood. Here, we report the first measurement of acoustic phonon dispersions in a quasi-freestanding monolayer semiconductor (MoS2), using helium-3 spin-echo spectroscopy. We identify a defect-driven regime change at a critical wavevector, $q_c$, marking the breakdown of continuum elastic behavior. At this length scale, the flexural mode transitions from continuum bending to defect-pinned standing waves, while the hybridized Rayleigh wave becomes vibrationally disordered in its dispersion and linewidth. We observe multiple defect-induced Van Hove singularities deep within the Brillouin zone and strongly suppressed acoustic group velocities, providing direct experimental evidence that four-phonon processes drive thermal transport in mono- and few-layer MoS2. These results offer a microscopic explanation for the anomalously low thermal conductivity widely observed in transition-metal dichalcogenides and demonstrate how atomic-scale disorder dictates energy flow in two-dimensional materials.

Title: The influence of packing protocol, size ratio, and pore structure on fractal exponents in dense polydisperse packings
Authors: Artem A. Vladimirov, Alexander Yu. Cherny, Eugen M. Anitas, Vladimir A. Osipov
Abstract: We study fractal properties of systems of densely and randomly packed disks, obeying a power-law distribution of radii, which is generated by using various protocols: Delaunay triangulation (DT) and constant pressure (CP) protocols, and the generalized Apollonian packing. The power-law exponents of the mass-radius relation and structure factor are obtained numerically for various values of the size ratio of the distribution, defined as the largest-to-smallest radius ratio. We show that the size ratio is an important control parameter responsible for the consistency of the fractal properties of the system: the greater the ratio, the less the finite size effects are pronounced and the better the agreement between the exponents. For the DT protocol, all three exponents coincide even at moderate values of the size ratio. For the CP protocol, the exponents are different for both moderate and large size ratios. The suppression of the exponent of the structure factor in the CP packing is explained by the specific behaviour of pores, which contain relatively big cavities. We develop an algorithm for calculating the pore size distribution and show that it is related to the exponent of the structure factor. We argue that the presence of the cavities lowers the configuration entropy and thus reduces the randomness of the CP packing. Thus the cavities reduce both packing fraction and randomness of the CP packings. Nevertheless, there is a tendency for the exponents to converge as the size ratio increases, suggesting that all the exponents become equal in the limit of infinite size ratio.

Title: Target search optimization by threshold resetting
Authors: Arup Biswas, Satya N Majumdar, Arnab Pal
Abstract: We introduce a new class of first passage time optimization driven by threshold resetting, inspired by many natural processes where crossing a critical limit triggers failure, degradation or transition. In here, search agents are collectively reset when a threshold is reached, creating event-driven, system-coupled simultaneous resets that induce long-range interactions. We develop a unified framework to compute search times for these correlated stochastic processes, with ballistic- and diffusive searchers as key examples uncovering diverse optimization behaviors. A cost function, akin to breakdown penalties, reveals that optimal resetting can forestall larger losses. This formalism generalizes to broader stochastic systems with multiple degrees of freedom.

Title: Topological Devil's staircase in a constrained kagome Ising antiferromagnet
Authors: Afonso Rufino, Samuel Nyckees, Jeanne Colbois, Frédéric Mila
Abstract: We show that the constrained Ising model on the kagome lattice with infinite first and third neighbor couplings undergoes an infinite series of thermal first-order transitions at which, as in the Kasteleyn transition, linear defects of infinite length condense. However, their density undergoes abrupt jumps because of the peculiar structure of the low temperature phase, which is only partially ordered and hosts a finite density of zero-energy domain walls. The number of linear defects between consecutive zero-energy domain walls is quantized to integer values, leading to a devil's staircase of topological origin. By contrast to the devil's staircase of the ANNNI and related models, the wave-vector is not fixed to commensurate values inside each phase.

Title: Majorana vortex phases in time-reversal invariant higher-order topological insulators and topologically trivial insulators
Authors: Xun-Jiang Luo, Mingliang Tian
Abstract: Majorana vortex phases have been extensively studied in topological materials with conventional superconducting pairing. Inspired by recent experimental progress in realizing time-reversal invariant higher-order topological insulators (THOTIs) and inducing superconducting proximity effects, we investigate Majorana vortex phases in these systems. We construct THOTIs as two copies of a topological insulator (TI) with time-reversal symmetry-preserving mass terms that anisotropically gap the surface states. We find that these mass terms have a negligible impact on the vortex phase transitions of double TIs when treated as perturbations, and no additional topological phase transitions are induced. Consequently, $\mathbb{Z}_2$-protected Majorana vortex end modes (MVEMs) emerge when the chemical potential lies between the critical chemical potentials $\mu_c^{(1)}$ and $\mu_c^{(2)}$ of the two TI vortex phase transitions. We demonstrate this behavior across multiple THOTI models, including rotational symmetry-protected THOTI, inversion symmetry-protected THOTI, rotational and inversion symmetries-protected THOTI bismuth, and extrinsic THOTI. Remarkably, MVEMs persist even when all surfaces are gapped with the same sign, rendering the system topologically trivial in both first- and second-order classifications. Our findings establish that MVEMs can be realized in time-reversal invariant systems with fully gapped surfaces, encompassing both topologically nontrivial and trivial insulators, thus significantly broadening the solid state material platforms for hosting Majorana vortex phases.

Title: Magnon thermal Hall effect in collinear antiferromagnets
Authors: Vladimir A. Zyuzin
Abstract: In this paper we theoretically discuss thermal Hall effect of magnons in insulating Néel ordered antiferromagnets at zero external magnetic field. We show that for compensated Néel order the non-zero thermal Hall effect will occur in the absence of any symmetry between the two magnetic sublattices, thus making the system ferrimagnetic. We then show that collinear Dzyaloshinskii's weak ferromagnets, in which there is a symmetry connecting the magnetic sublattices, also show magnon thermal Hall effect. The thermal Hall effect of magnons will be non-zero by a virtue of the spin-momentum splitting of the magnon spectrum due to the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction as well as second-nearest exchange interaction different in the two magnetic sublattices, both corresponding to the broken symmetries that lead to the Dzyaloshinskii's invariant. We construct a theoretical model in which an external electric field may change the symmetry of the antiferromagnetic system thus altering the thermal Hall effect of magnons.

Title: Linked skyrmions in shifted magnetic bilayer
Authors: Sumit Ghosh, Hiroshi Katsumoto, Gustav Bihlmayer, Moritz Sallermann, Vladyslav M. Kuchkin, Filipp N. Rybakov, Olle Eriksson, Stefan Blügel, Nikolai S. Kiselev
Abstract: Magnetic solitons have recently attracted significant attention due to their intricate physical properties and potential applications in information processing. The majority of the studies in this field, however, are focused on a particular type of solitons known as skyrmions, characterised by a unit topological charge. Here, we present a shifted magnetic bilayer that can demonstrate magnetic solitons with arbitrary large topological charges. These configurations, which we call linked skyrmions, consist of multiple skyrmions linked together with topological point defects. These topological point defects, termed as anti-aligned points, originate from the mutually orthogonal Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in two different layers. By tuning the interlayer exchange coupling and the external magnetic field, one can also achieve different ground states in this bilayer. Additionally, the system also demonstrates conventional skyrmion-bags and $k\pi$-skyrmions. Finally we propose a suitable material candidate where these magnetic configurations can be realised. Our findings, thus, can provide a way to achieve solitons with large topological charge and realise them in realistic systems.

Abstract: Before assessing the suitability of a semiconductor for specific applications, the first question to ask is whether it possesses a direct or indirect band gap. This distinction is fundamental, as the operation of devices such as light-emitting diodes, solar cells, and photodetectors is closely tied to the band-gap nature. Semiconductors that exhibit a band-gap crossover, from indirect to direct or vice versa, offer enhanced versatility for optoelectronic applications. Prominent examples include transition metal dichalcogenides and the subject of this study, PbI2. The nature of the band gap, and its crossover, can only be directly determined in reciprocal space by tracking the valence-band maximum and conduction-band minimum. Here, we directly visualize the thickness-dependent crossover of PbI2 from an indirect to a direct band gap using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. Our measurements reveal a shift of the valence-band maximum toward the Brillouin-zone center as the film thickness exceeds a monolayer. Supported by density functional theory calculations, our results show that this crossover is driven by interlayer interactions and the hybridization of iodine pz orbitals. These findings demonstrate the tunable electronic structure of PbI2 and its potential for optoelectronic applications.

Title: Kinetic theory of coupled binary-fluid-surfactant systems
Authors: Alexandra J. Hardy, Samuel Cameron, Steven McDonald, Abdallah Daddi-Moussa-Ider, Elsen Tjhung
Abstract: We derive a self-consistent hydrodynamic theory of coupled binary-fluid-surfactant systems from the underlying microscopic physics using Rayleigh's variational principle. At the microscopic level, surfactant molecules are modelled as dumbbells that exert forces and torques on the fluid and interface while undergoing Brownian motion. We obtain the overdamped stochastic dynamics of these particles from a Rayleighian dissipation functional, which we then coarse-grain to derive a set of continuum equations governing the surfactant concentration, orientation, and the fluid density and velocity. This approach introduces a polarization field, representing the average orientation of surfactants, and yields a mesoscopic free energy functional from which all governing equations are consistently derived. The resulting model accurately captures key surfactant phenomena, including surface tension reduction and droplet stabilization, as confirmed by both perturbation theory and numerical simulations.

Title: Orbital Order and Superconductivity in Bilayer Nickelate Compounds
Authors: Giniyat Khaliullin, Jiří Chaloupka
Abstract: We propose a theory for bilayer nickelate materials, where a large tetragonal field - intrinsic or induced by epitaxial strain - lifts the orbital degeneracy and localizes the $3z^2-r^2$ orbital states. These states host local spins $S=1/2$ bound into singlets by strong interlayer coupling, and their dynamics is described by weakly dispersive singlet-triplet excitations ("triplons"). The charge carriers occupy the wide bands of $x^2-y^2$ symmetry, and their Cooper pairing is mediated by the high-energy triplon excitations. As the $x^2-y^2$ band filling increases, i.e., moving further away from the Ni$^{3+}$ valence state, the indirect Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interactions between local spins induce spin-density-wave order via triplon condensation. Implications of the model for compressively strained La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ films and electron doped oxychloride Sr$_3$Ni$_2$O$_5$Cl$_2$ are discussed.

Title: First-principle investigation of the electronic structure and optical properties of graphene/boron nitride lateral heterostructures
Authors: Elisa Serrano Richaud, Sylvain Latil, Lorenzo Sponza
Abstract: We investigate the electronic and optical properties of lateral heterostructures made of alternated armchair ribbons of graphene and hexagonal boron nitride. It is known that the gapwidth of these heterostructures can be classified into three families depending on the width of the graphene part. Here, by employing ab initio methods (standard and time-dependent density functional theory and GW), we demonstrate that such classification still holds for other electronic states close to the gap. We show that they display trends substantially different from those known for the gapwidth and originate family-specific features in the screening properties and optical absorption spectra (peak energy and intensity). In addition, our use of a tight binding model originally introduced for isolated nanoribbons allows us to discuss some crucial heterostructure's properties in view of those of its isolated building blocks, including charge redistribution at the edges, gap hierarchy inversion, and specific optical selection rules. By bridging the electronic structure to optical absorption spectra in a comprehensive set of systems, this study sets the stage for more refined investigations on the absorption properties of graphene/boron nitride lateral heterostructures.

Title: SO(n) Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki states as conformal boundary states of integrable SU(n) spin chains
Authors: Yueshui Zhang, Ying-Hai Wu, Meng Cheng, Hong-Hao Tu
Abstract: We construct a class of conformal boundary states in the $\mathrm{SU}(n)_1$ Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) conformal field theory (CFT) using the symmetry embedding $\mathrm{Spin}(n)_2 \subset \mathrm{SU}(n)_1$. These boundary states are beyond the standard Cardy construction and possess $\mathrm{SO}(n)$ symmetry. The $\mathrm{SU}(n)$ Uimin-Lai-Sutherland (ULS) spin chains, which realize the $\mathrm{SU}(n)_1$ WZW model on the lattice, allow us to identify these boundary states as the ground states of the $\mathrm{SO}(n)$ Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki spin chains. Using the integrability of the $\mathrm{SU}(n)$ ULS model, we analytically compute the corresponding Affleck-Ludwig boundary entropy using exact overlap formulas. Our results unveil intriguing connections between exotic boundary states in CFT and integrable lattice models, thus providing deep insights into the interplay of symmetry, integrability, and boundary critical phenomena.

Title: Ultrafast heat transfer in single palladium nanocrystals seen with an X-ray free-electron laser

Abstract: We report transient highly strained structural states in individual palladium (Pd) nanocrystals, electronically heated using an optical laser, which precede their uniform thermal expansion. Using an X-ray free-electron laser probe, the evolution of individual 111 Bragg peaks is measured as a function of delay time at various laser fluences. Above a laser fluence threshold at a sufficient pump-probe delay, the Bragg peak splits into multiple peaks, indicating heterogeneous strain, before returning to a single peak, corresponding to even heat distribution throughout the lattice expanded crystal. Our findings are supported by a lattice displacement and strain model of a single nanocrystal at different delay times, which agrees with the experimental data. Our observations have implications for understanding femtosecond laser interactions with metals and the potential photo-catalytic performance of Pd.

Title: Homogenization framework for rigid and non-rigid foldable origami metamaterials
Authors: Xuwen Li, Amin Jamalimehr, Mathias Legrand, Damiano Pasini
Abstract: Origami metamaterials typically consist of folded sheets with periodic patterns, conferring them with remarkable mechanical properties. In the context of Continuum Mechanics, the majority of existing predictive methods are mechanism analogs which favor rigid folding and panel bending. While effective in predicting primary deformation modes, existing methods fall short in capturing the full spectrum of deformation of non-rigid foldable origami, such as the emergence of curvature along straight creases, local strain at vertices and warpage in panels. To fully capture the entire deformation spectrum and enhance the accuracy of existing methods, this paper introduces a homogenization framework for origami metamaterials where the faces are modeled as plate elements. Both asymptotic and energy-based homogenization methods are formulated and implemented. As a representative crease pattern, we examine the Miura origami sheet homogenized as an equivalent Kirchhoff-Love plate. The results reveal that certain effective elastic properties are nonlinearly related to both the initial fold angle and the crease stiffness. When benchmarked with results from fully resolved simulations, our framework yields errors up to 12.9\%, while existing models, including the bar-and-hinge model and the rigid-panel model, show up to 161\% error. The differences in errors are associated with the complex modes of crease and panel deformation in non-rigid origami, unexplored by the existing models. This work demonstrates a precise and efficient continuum framework for origami metamaterials as an effective strategy for predicting their elastic properties, understanding their mechanics, and designing their functionalities.

Title: Effective diffusion of Brownian motion in spatially quasi-periodic noise
Authors: Sang Yang, Zhixin Peng
Abstract: The effective diffusion of Brownian particles in periodic potential has been a central topic in nonequilibrium statistical physcis. A classical result is the Lifson formula which provides the effective diffusion constant in periodic potentials. Extending beyong periodicity, our recent work [arXiv:2504.16527] has demonstrated that a modified Lifson expression remains valid for Brownian motion in quasi-periodic potentials. In this work, we extend our previous results by incorporating spatial quasi-periodic noise and examining different stochastic interpretations, $\alpha\in[0,1]$. The proposed framework is simple, computationally efficient, and unifies the treatment of diffusion in both periodic and quasi-periodic systems.

Title: The Key Physics of Ice Premelting
Authors: Luis G. MacDowell
Abstract: A disordered quasi-liquid layer of water is thought to cover the ice surface, but many issues, such as its onset temperature, its thickness, or its actual relation to bulk liquid water have been a matter of unsettled controversy for more than a century. In this perspective article, current computer simulations and experimental results are discussed under the light of a suitable theoretical framework. It is found that using a combination of wetting physics, the theory of intermolecular forces, statistical mechanics and out of equilibrium physics a large number of conflicting results can be reconciled and collected into a consistent description of the ice surface. This helps understand the crucial role of surface properties in a range of important applications, from the enigmatic structure of snow crystals to the slipperiness of ice.

Title: Superconductivity in W3Re2C with chiral structure
Authors: Lei Yang, Jing Jiang, Hui-Hui He, Ying Ma, Kai Liu, Xiao Zhang, Hechang Lei
Abstract: We discover superconductivity in cubic W3Re2C with chiral structure and the superconducting transition temperature Tc is about 6.2 K. Detailed characterizations and analysis indicate that W3Re2C is a bulk type-II BCS superconductor with full isotropic gap. Moreover, first-principles calculations indicate that the electron-phonon coupling primarily arises from interactions between W/Re 5d electronic states and their low-frequency phonons. Furthermore, the breaking of inversion symmetry in W3Re2C facilitates the emergence of Weyl points in the electronic structure. Therefore, W3Re2C can serve as a promising platform for investigating the influences of chiral structure on both superconductivity and band topology.

Title: \textit{Ab initio} studies of influence of periodic-direction electric fields on spin lifetime and spin diffusion length and the validation of an \textit{ab initio} matrix-drift-diffusion model
Authors: Junqing Xu, Can Liu, Weiwei Chen
Abstract: Recently, we developed an \textit{ab initio} approach of spin lifetime (\tau_{s}) and spin diffusion length (l_{s}) in solids [Phys. Rev. Lett. 135, 046705 (2025)], based on a density-matrix master equation with quantum treatment of electron scattering processes. In this work, we extend the method to include the drift term due to an electric field along a periodic direction, implemented using a Wannier-representation-based covariant derivative. We employ this approach to investigate the electric-field effect on \tau_{s} and l_{s} of monolayer WSe_{2}, bulk GaAs, bulk GaN, and graphene-h-BN heterostructure. We find that an electric field reduces \tau_{s} of GaAs, due to the induced D'yakonov-Perel'-type spin relaxation. In GaN and graphene-h-BN, \tau_{s} is significantly affected, partly because the electric field generates an effective magnetic field corresponding to the k-derivative of Rashba spin-orbit (magnetic) field. Our results show that l_{s} can be significantly enhanced or suppressed by a moderate downstream or upstream field respectively. While the standard drift-diffusion model performs well for WSe_{2}, it can introduce large errors of the electric-field-induced changes of l_{s} in GaAs, GaN and graphene-h-BN. Our proposed \textit{ab initio} matrix-drift-diffusion model improves results for GaAs and GaN, but still fails for graphene-h-BN. Thus, to accurately capture the influence of electric fields on l_{s} in realistic materials, it is necessary to go beyond the drift-diffusion model and adopt a microscopic \textit{ab initio} methodology. Moreover, in graphene-h-BN, we find that the field-induced changes of \tau_{s} and l_{s} are not only governed by the drift term in the master equation, but are also significantly affected by the electric-field modification of the equilibrium density matrix away from Fermi-Dirac distribution function.

Title: Physics-Based Factorized Machine Learning for Predicting Ionic Dielectric Tensors
Authors: Atsushi Takigawa, Shin Kiyohara, Yu Kumagai
Abstract: Considerable effort continues to be devoted to the exploration of next-generation high-\k{appa} materials that combine a high dielectric constant with a wide band gap. However, machine learning (ML)-based virtual screening has remained challenging, primarily due to the low accuracy in predicting the ionic contribution to the dielectric tensor, which dominates the dielectric performance of high-\k{appa} materials. We here propose a joint ML model that predicts Born effective charges using an equivariant graph neural network, and phonon properties using a highly accurate pretrained ML potential. The ionic dielectric tensor is then computed analytically from these quantities. This approach significantly improves the accuracy of ionic contribution. Using the proposed model, we successfully identified 38 novel high-\k{appa} oxides from a screening pool of over 8,000 candidates.

Title: Interplay of spin orbit interaction and Andreev reflection in proximized quantum dots
Authors: Bogdan R. Bułka, Tadeusz Domański, Karol I. Wysokiński
Abstract: We investigate a hybrid device consisting of two quantum dots placed between a BCS superconductor and a semiconductor with a strong spin-orbit interaction. Assuming charge tunneling between quantum dots through spin-flip processes, we study the molecular Andreev bound states appearing in the proximized quantum dots. We show that the spin-orbit coupling splits a pair of the Andreev states into four in-gap quasiparticles. For the appropriate set of model parameters, two of these internal quasiparticle states merge, forming the zero-energy state. Under such circumstances, we obtain fully spin-polarized versions of the Majorana quasiparticles, localized on different quantum dots. This happens solely when the spin-orbit interaction is equally strong to the magnitude of crossed Andreev reflections, i.e. in the sweet spot. Otherwise, these processes are competitive, as can be observed in changes of the expectation values of the corresponding order parameters. We analyze signatures of such competition manifested under the nonequilibrium conditions for various configurations of the bias voltage. In particular, for the symmetric bias voltage between the normal electrodes and the Cooper pair splitter bias configuration, we reveal duality in the transport properties. Charge transport through the zero-energy state at the sweet spot is contributed by perfectly entangled electrons with an (almost) ideal transmission. Transport studies would thus enable empirical detection of the molecular quasiparticle states and the efficiency of dissipation processes caused by the external normal electrodes.

Title: Temperley-Lieb integrable models and fusion categories
Authors: Matthew Blakeney, Luke Corcoran, Marius de Leeuw, Balazs Pozsgay, Eric Vernier
Abstract: We show that every fusion category containing a non-invertible, self-dual object $a$ gives rise to an integrable anyonic chain whose Hamiltonian density satisfies the Temperley-Lieb algebra. This spin chain arises by considering the projection onto the identity channel in the fusion process $a\otimes a$. We relate these models to Pasquier's construction of ADE lattice models. We then exploit the underlying Temperley-Lieb structure to discuss the spectrum of these models and argue that these models are gapped when the quantum dimension of $a$ is greater than 2. We show that for fusion categories where the dimension is close to 2, such as the Fib$\times$Fib and Haagerup fusion categories, the finite size effects are large and they can obscure the numerical analysis of the gap.

A procedure for constructing a model with exact, massively degenerate ground states is also introduced.

Title: Impact of Carrier Injector Design on the Threshold of Interband Cascade Lasers
Authors: T. Sato, B. Petrović, R. Weih, F. Hartmann, S. Höfling, S. Birner, C. Jirauschek, T. Grange
Abstract: We theoretically investigate how the injector region design of interband cascade lasers (ICLs) impacts the threshold carrier and current densities. The model combines a polarization-sensitive 8-band $\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{p}$ calculation, electrostatics, and a microscopic calculation of Auger recombination rates. The inelastic carrier-carrier scattering is included to lowest order using quasi-equilibrium Green's functions. It captures the combined effects of charge-carrier redistribution, parasitic absorption, and bias voltage on the Auger recombination rate. We show that heavily doping the electron injector suppresses the dominant multi-hole Auger recombination by reducing the hole population of the recombination quantum wells. This agrees with the experimental observation that the heavy doping reduces threshold currents. Unlike the measurements, however, they do not increase at high doping concentrations in our model, which does not include scattering-mediated light absorption and/or carrier escape. Furthermore, by introducing indium to the conventional GaSb hole injector wells, we explain the rule of thumb from experiments that raising the hole injector levels does not outperform the doping strategy. Our model provides physical insights for optimizing ICL carrier injectors.

Title: Hamiltonian Active Particles in Incompressible Fluid Membranes
Authors: Sneha Krishnan, Rickmoy Samanta
Abstract: Active proteins and membrane-bound motors exert force dipole flows along fluid interfaces and lipid bilayers. We develop a Hamiltonian framework for the interactions of pusher and puller dipoles embedded in an incompressible two-dimensional membrane supported by a shallow viscous subphase. Beginning from the Brinkman-regularized Stokes equations of the membrane--subphase system, we construct the near- and far-field dipolar velocity and associated stream functions. Although generic dipoles reorient under the local membrane vorticity, we show that the far-field dipolar flow is vorticity-free; force-free motors therefore retain fixed orientation and obey a position-based Hamiltonian dynamics in which the positions of N dipoles evolve via an effective Hamiltonian built from the dipolar stream function. In the near field, where the flow possesses finite vorticity, a Hamiltonian formulation is recovered in the quenched-orientation limit. We demonstrate this Hamiltonian structure by simulating ensembles of pusher and puller dipoles and compare the dynamics generated by the near-field and far-field Hamiltonians. For identical dipoles, the far-field Hamiltonian produces rapid clustering from random initial conditions, whereas the near-field Hamiltonian suppresses collapse and yields extended, non-aggregating configurations. Our work thus provides a concrete realization of position-based Hamiltonian descriptions for active particles in incompressible fluid membranes and establishes the important roles of membrane incompressibility and fluid vorticity that leads to the emergence of such Hamiltonian descriptions.

Title: Langevin equation with potential of mean force: The case of anchored bath
Authors: Alex V. Plyukhin
Abstract: The potential of mean force (PMF) is an effective average potential acting on an open system, renormalized due to the interaction with the surrounding thermal bath. The PMF determines the correction to the equilibrium Gibbs distribution, but it is generally unclear how to implement the concept for time-dependent phenomena described by a (generalized) Langevin equation. We study a model where the system is a single particle (so there are no complications related to internal forces) and a non-trivial PMF is due to the presence of on-site (anchor) potentials applied to the bath particles. We found that the PMF does not merely replace the external potential, but also makes the dissipation kernel and statistical properties of noise dependent on the system's position. That dependence is determined by the internal bath and system-bath interactions and is a priori unknown. Therefore, in the general case the Langevin equation with the PMF is not closed and thus inoperable. However, for systems with linear forces the aforementioned dependence on the system's position is canceled. As an example, we consider a model where the bath is formed by the Klein-Gordon chain, i. e. a harmonic chain with on-site harmonic potentials. In that case, the generalized Langevin equation has the standard form with an external potential replaced by a quadratic PMF.

Title: Significant surface-mediated reduction of radiation damage in tungsten revealed by advanced ion channeling analysis
Authors: Xin Jin, Fredric Granberg, Kai Nordlund, Sabina Markelj, Esther Punzón-Quijorna, Flyura Djurabekova
Abstract: Tungsten is a leading candidate material for plasma-facing components in future fusion reactors. Extensive studies have been performed to better understand its behavior under irradiation. Recent experiments of Rutherford backscattering spectrometry in channeling mode indicated a marked reduction in radiation damage in single-crystal tungsten samples irradiated by self-ions when the irradiation temperature was increased from room temperature to 800 K. However, the underlying mechanism for this damage reduction remains unclear. In this work, by combining Rutherford backscattering spectrometry in channeling mode and molecular dynamics simulations, we identify a pronounced surface effect at elevated temperatures, characterized by a significant reduction of dislocation density near the surface. We demonstrate how our unique analysis method can clearly resolve a dislocation-free zone and a transition region with suppressed defect density before reaching the bulk value. The strong surface effect at elevated temperatures is explained by considering the coherent drift motion of dislocation loops towards the surface, highlighting alternative perspectives on mitigating radiation damage by increasing dislocation mobility.

Title: Altermagnetism and its induced higher-order topology on the Lieb lattice
Authors: Xingmin Huo, Xingchuan Zhu, Chang-An Li, Shiping Feng, Song-Bo Zhang, Shengyuan A.Yang, Huaiming Guo
Abstract: Altermagnetism (AM) has brought renewed attention to the Lieb lattice. Here, we broaden the scope of altermagnetic models on the Lieb lattice by using a general scheme based on spin clusters. We design various altermagnetic models with d- and g-wave on the Lieb lattice, and investigate its interplay with spin-orbit coupling. While the altermagnetic unit cell reconstructs the topological edge states in the strip geometry and leads to the emergence of Dirac points, the in-plane magnetic moments of AM can induce gaps at these points. In an open square geometry, corner modes emerge within these gaps, realizing higher-order topological states. We further verify that the induction of higher-order topology is applicable to all altermagnetic configurations constructed here on the Lieb lattice, and is most pronounced for AM by comparing with the other types of magnetism such as ferromagnetism and ferrimagnetism. Our results highlight the exotic properties of AM, and suggest its potential applications in engineering topological quantum states.

Title: "X-ray Coulomb Counting" to understand electrochemical systems
Authors: Chuntian Cao, Hans-Georg Steinrück
Abstract: Electrochemical systems are important for a sustainable and defossilized energy system of the future. While accurate and precise, the corresponding electrochemical measurements, in which many reactions may occur simultaneously, often do not contain enough information to understand the underlying mechanism and processes. This information, however, is crucial towards rational materials and devices as well as process development and for inventing new concepts. We introduce explicitly the concept of "X-ray Coulomb Counting" in which X-ray methods are used to quantify on an absolute scale how much charge is transferred into which reactions during the electrochemical measurements. This allows to interpret the electrochemical measurements in detail and obtain the desired phenomenological and mechanistic understanding. We show a few recent examples from the Li-ion battery literature in which the concept of X-ray Coulomb Counting was employed to obtain foundational understanding.

Title: Magnetic Structures Database from Symmetry-aided High-Throughput Calculations
Authors: Hanjing Zhou, Yuxuan Mu, Dingwen Zhang, Hangbing Chu, Di Wang, Huimei Liu, Xiangang Wan
Abstract: Magnetic structures, which play a central role in determining their physical properties, are known for only very limited compounds. Traditional theoretical approaches to predicting magnetic structures predominantly rely on first-principles calculations. A key challenge of these methods is their requirement for initial magnetic configurations as inputs, which theoretically possess infinite possibilities. In this work, we introduce a strategy based on irreducible representation basis vectors that effectively narrows down the vast space of potential magnetic configurations to a finite set, typically comprising around 20 candidates per material. Despite this significant reduction, the compact input sets generated by our method already encompass the experimental magnetic structures for 253 out of 302 benchmark materials (83.8%) from the MAGNDATA database. These materials have propagation vectors q=0 and unit cells containing up to 40 atoms, all within the Landau framework. Subsequent first-principles calculations correctly identify the magnetic structure in 198 of these cases. We further apply our highly efficient method to 7,520 stoichiometric transition-metal compounds with fewer than 20 atoms per unit cell in the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database, and establish a magnetic structure database containing 2,906 magnetic materials. To demonstrate its utility, we use this database for the systematic exploration of magnetic topological phases and altermagnets, identifying 1,070 and 392 candidate materials, respectively.

Title: Competing Paramagnetic Phases in the Maple-Leaf Heisenberg Antiferromagnet
Authors: Paul L. Ebert, Yasir Iqbal, Alexander Wietek
Abstract: We establish a remarkably rich ground state phase diagram in the maple-leaf lattice spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet as a function of the three symmetry-inequivalent nearest-neighbor bonds using exact diagonalization and tower-of-states analysis on clusters up to $N=36$ sites. Besides a hexagonal plaquette state, a star-shaped valence bond solid state is discovered in close vicinity to the (canted) $120^\circ$ magnetic phase, strongly reminiscent of a de-confined critical point or Dirac spin liquid scenario on the triangular lattice antiferromagnets. Moreover, an exact dimer product-state is observed next to a collinear Néel-state, similar to the Shastry-Sutherland model. All identified phases compete in a parameter regime close to the isotropic point, providing a promising region for spin liquids to emerge. By analyzing Gutzwiller-projected wave-functions we identify a sliver of parameter regime where a gapped $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ spin liquid Ansatz is in astonishing agreement with the exact $N=36$ ground state. This rich competition of paramagnetic phases demonstrates that the maple-leaf antiferromagnet is a promising platform for exotic states of matter and quantum critical phenomena.

Title: Unavoidable Canonical Nonlinearity Induced by Gaussian Measures Discretization
Authors: Koretaka Yuge
Abstract: When we consider canonical averages for classical discrete systems, typically referred to as substitutional alloys, the map phi from many-body interatomic interactions to thermodynamic equilibrium configurations generally exhibits complicated nonlinearity. This canonical nonlinearity is fundamentally rooted in deviations of the discrete configurational density of states (CDOS) from continuous Gaussian families, and has conventionally been characterized by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence on discrete statistical manifold. Thus, the previous works inevitablly missed intrinsic nonlinearities induced by discretization of Gaussian families, which remains invisible within conventional information-geometric descriptions. In the present work, we identify and quantify such unavoidable canonical nonlinearity by employing the 2-Wasserstein distance with a cost function aligned with the Fisher metric for Gaussian families. We derive an explicit expression for the Wasserstein distance in the limit of vanishing discretization scale d to 0: W2 = d*sqrt(Tr(Gamma)^(-1)/12), where Gamma denotes covariance matrix of the CDOS. We further show that this limiting Wasserstein distance admits a clear geometric interpretation on the statistical manifold, equivalent to a KL divergence associated with the expected parallel translations of continuous Gaussian. Our framework thus provides a transport-information-geometric characterization of discretization-induced nonlinearity in classical discrete systems. In addition, we confirm that this W2-KL equivalence admits a natural generalization beyond Gaussian families, provided that the transport cost is aligned with the Fisher metric of an underlying statistical submanifold and the discretization scale links to infinitesimal parameter variations.

Title: Charge Order in the half-filled bond-Holstein Model
Authors: Charles Jordan, George Issa, Ehsan Khatami, Richard Scalettar, Benjamin Cohen-Stead, Steven Johnston
Abstract: We use determinant quantum Monte Carlo to study the half-filled `bond-Holstein' model on a square lattice. We find that the model exhibits a charge-density-wave (CDW) phase transition with a critical temperature $T_\mathrm{cdw}$ considerably higher than that of the canonical `site-Holstein' model. Using a finite-size scaling analysis of the charge structure factor $S_{\rm cdw}$, we obtain $T_\mathrm{cdw}$ to greater than one percent accuracy. At the same time, local observables also show clear signatures consistent with the transition temperatures inferred from our scaling analysis. We attribute the enhanced CDW tendencies to a phonon-mediated nearest-neighbor electron repulsion that is directly proportional to the dimensionless electron-phonon coupling $\lambda$ in the atomic ($t\rightarrow 0$) limit. This behavior contrasts with the site-Holstein case, where the same limit yields only an on-site attraction. We supplement our analysis with results from several unsupervised machine learning methods, which not only confirm our estimates of $T_\mathrm{cdw}$ but also provide insight into the high-temperature crossover between a metallic and bipolaron liquid regime.

Title: Scaling of Two-Dimensional Semiconductor Nanoribbons for High-Performance Electronics
Authors: Hao-Yu Lan, Shao-Heng Yang, Yongjae Cho, Jun Cai, Zheng Sun, Chenyang Li, Lin-Yun Huang, Thomas Beechem, Yi Wan, Lain-Jong Li, Joerg Appenzeller, Zhihong Chen
Abstract: Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) field-effect transistors (FETs), with their atomically thin bodies, are promising candidates for future gate-all-around (GAA) nanoribbon architectures. While state-of-the-art Si GAA nanoribbon transistors feature channel widths in the tens of nanometers, most reported TMD-based FETs remain limited to micrometer-scale dimensions, limiting their relevance for ultra-scaled electronics. In this work, we investigate the channel width scaling in nanoribbon transistors based on monolayer MoS2 grown on 2-inch wafers, achieving widths of approximately 30-40 nm. Remarkably, nanoribbon width scaling enhances the on-current by 30-40%, reaching up to 700 uA/um for the smallest-width devices, while also improving the subthreshold slope (SS) to as low as 70 mV/dec. This enhancement is attributed to a stronger electric field at the nanoribbon edges without significant degradation from edge-related scattering. To further demonstrate the scalability of the nanoribbon device, we evaluate the variability of extremely scaled monolayer MoS2 nanoribbon transistor arrays featuring a contact pitch of 60 nm and an effective oxide thickness (EOT) of approximately 0.9 nm. Beyond MoS2, we extend the nanoribbon structure to WS2 n-type and WSe2 p-type FETs, demonstrating a viable path toward complementary monolayer TMD nanoribbon FETs for future ultra-scaled electronics.

Title: Direct probing the quantum geometric tensor for bosonic collective excitations
Authors: Chi Wu, Takashi Oka, Shuichi Murakami, Tiantian Zhang
Abstract: The quantum geometric tensor (QGT), whose real and imaginary parts define the quantum metric and Berry curvature, encodes the intrinsic geometry of quantum states. While electronic QGT has been directly observed and linked to various phenomena like electron-phonon coupling, its bosonic analogue remains both theoretically and experimentally unexplored. We demonstrate that the dynamical structure factor directly encodes the full QGT throughout the Brillouin zone, establishing it as a sensitive probe of both quantum metric and Berry curvature. Applying this framework, we uncover clear geometric signatures in a twofold quadruple Weyl phonon in BaPtGe and the node-line magnon in Gd. Our results establish a general, direct route to measuring quantum geometry in bosonic systems, a crucial step toward elucidating its impact on condensed matter phenomena.

Title: Resolving Overlapping EBSD Patterns by Experiment -- Simulation Residuals Analysis
Authors: Grzegorz Cios, Aimo Winkelmann, Tomasz Tokarski, Wiktor Bednarczyk, Piotr Bała
Abstract: In the technique of Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD), the accurate detection and identification of different phases existing in a sample is often limited by overlapping Kikuchi diffraction patterns originating from the extended probing volume of the individual EBSD map points measured in the scanning electron microscope (SEM). We present an iterative approach that uses simulated Kikuchi patterns to resolve several overlapping diffraction signals. For each measured EBSD pattern, our method first identifies the best-fit simulated Kikuchi pattern using dynamic template matching. This simulated, ideal reference pattern is then further processed to optimally match the experimental image, uncovering any underlying weaker signals after subtraction. Repeatedly utilizing dynamic template matching and pattern subtraction on residual signals of subsequent steps enables the identification of minor phases that might otherwise be missed from the probing volume of the EBSD map point. This method significantly improves phase detection in complex materials, addressing a key limitation of conventional EBSD analysis that conventionally assigns a single phase to each map point. The present method does not require a known orientation relationship between the phases of the overlapping patterns or close neighbor experimental patterns like previously published approaches.

Title: Krylov complexity of purification
Authors: Rathindra Nath Das, Takato Mori
Abstract: In quantum systems, purification can map mixed states into pure states and a non-unitary evolution into a unitary one by enlarging the Hilbert space. We establish a connection between the complexities of mixed quantum states and their purification, proposing new inequalities among these complexities. By examining single qubits, two-qubit Werner states, eight-dimensional Gaussian random unitary ensembles, and infinite-dimensional systems, we demonstrate how these relationships manifest across a broad class of systems. We find that the spread complexity of purification of a vacuum state evolving into a thermal state equals the average number of Rindler particles. This complexity is also shown to adhere to the Lloyd-like bound, indicating a further relation to the quantum speed limit. Finally, using mutual Krylov complexity, we observe subadditivity of the Krylov complexities, which contrasts with known results from holographic volume complexity. We put forward Krylov mutual complexity as a diagnosis of a potential gravity dual of Krylov complexities.

Title: Quantum vorticity: a not so effective field theory
Authors: Gabriel Cuomo, Fanny Eustachon, Eren Firat, Brian Henning, Riccardo Rattazzi
Abstract: We provide a comprehensive picture for the formulation of the perfect fluid in the modern effective field theory formalism at both the classical and quantum level. Due to the necessity of decomposing the hydrodynamical variables $(\rho, p, u^\mu)$ into other internal degrees of freedom, the procedure is inherently not unique. We discuss and compare the different inequivalent formulations. These theories possess a peculiarity: the presence of an infinite dimensional symmetry implying a vanishing dispersion relation $\omega = 0$ for the transverse modes. This sets the stage for UV-IR mixing in the quantum theory, which we study in the different formulations focussing on the incompressible limit. We observe that the dispersion relation gets modified by quantum effects to become $\omega \propto \mathbf{k}^2$, where the fundamental excitations can be viewed as vortex-anti-vortex pairs. The spectrum exhibits infinitely many types of degenerate quanta. The unusual sensitivity to UV quantum fluctuations renders the implementation of the defining infinite symmetry somewhat subtle. However we present a lattice regularization that preserves a deformed version of such symmetry.

Title: Modelling Lateral Spread in Wire Flat Rolling
Authors: Mozhdeh Erfanian, Carl D. Slater, Edward James Brambley
Abstract: A mathematical model for wire rolling is developed, focusing on predicting the lateral spread. This provides, for the first time, an analytic model of lateral spread without any fitting parameters. The model is derived directly from the governing equations, assuming a rigid, perfectly plastic material and exploiting the thinness of the wire (in thickness and width) relative to the roller size. Results are compared against experiments performed on stainless steel wire using 100mm diameter rolls, demonstrating accurate predictions of lateral spread across a wide range of wire diameters (2.96mm-7.96mm) and reduction ratios (20%-60%), all without the need for fitting parameters. Since the model requires only seconds to compute, the model's valid range is explored for varying roll diameter, wire diameter, and reduction ratio, and their effects on the resulting lateral spread characterized. The model can serve as a robust tool for validating FE results, guiding process design, and laying the foundation for future improved models. Matlab code to evaluate the model is provided in the supplementary material.

Title: Work Statistics and Quantum Trajectories: No-Click Limit and non-Hermitian Hamiltonians
Authors: Manali Malakar, Alessandro Silva
Abstract: We investigate quantum work statistics within the standard two-point measurement (TPM) scheme in continuously monitored quantum systems, including the effects of generalized unitary evolution, possibly controlled by quantum circuit models, and multiple generalized measurements as well as post-selection of no-click trajectories. We derive an explicit expression for the work generating function that naturally incorporates non-Hermitian dynamics arising from quantum jump processes and reveals deviations from the standard Jarzynski equality due to measurement-induced asymmetries. We illustrate our theoretical framework by analyzing a one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model under local spin monitoring. In this model, increased measurement strength projects the system onto the no-click state, leading to a suppression of energy fluctuations and measurement-induced energy saturation, reminiscent of the quantum Zeno effect. Moreover, we find signatures of the measurement-induced transition observed in the no-click limit in the moments of the work distribution.

Title: Improving variational counterdiabatic driving with weighted actions and computer algebra
Authors: Naruo Ohga, Takuya Hatomura
Abstract: Variational counterdiabatic (CD) driving is a disciplined and widely used method to robustly control quantum many-body systems by mimicking adiabatic processes with high fidelity and reduced duration. Central to this technique is a universal structure of the adiabatic gauge potential (AGP) over a parameterized Hamiltonian. Here, we reveal that introducing a new degree of freedom into the theory of the AGP can significantly improve variational CD driving. Specifically, we find that the algebraic characterization of the AGP is not unique, and we exploit this non-uniqueness to develop the weighted variational method for deriving a refined driving protocol. This approach extends the conventional method in two aspects: it assigns customized weights to matrix elements relevant to specific problems, and it effectively incorporates nonlocal information. We also develop an efficient numerical algorithm to compute the refined driving protocol using computer algebra. Our framework is broadly applicable and, in principle, it can replace any previous use of variational CD driving. We demonstrate its practicality by applying it to adiabatic evolution along the ground state of a parameterized Hamiltonian. This proposal outperforms the conventional method in terms of fidelity, as confirmed by extensive numerical simulations on quantum Ising models.

Title: Analytical phase boundary of a quantum driven-dissipative Kerr oscillator from classical stochastic instantons
Authors: Théo Sépulcre
Abstract: The framework of Keldysh path integral concisely describes quantum systems driven away from thermal equilibrium, such as the two-photon driven Kerr oscillator. Within the thermodynamic limit of diverging photon occupation, we map it to a Martin-Siggia-Rose-Janssen-de Dominicis path integral, and obtain a purely classical, stochastic equivalent where photon self-interaction plays the role of temperature. This perspective sheds light on the difficulties encountered in the search for an effective thermodynamic potential to describe the bistability of the model. It allows us to estimate the bistable tunneling rates using a real-time instanton technique leading to an analytical expression of the phase boundary, the first to our knowledge. It opens the way to powerful semi-analytical techniques to be applied to various quantum optics models displaying bistability.

Title: Language-Native Materials Processing Design by Lightly Structured Text Database and Reasoning Large Language Model
Authors: Yuze Liu, Zhaoyuan Zhang, Xiangsheng Zeng, Yihe Zhang, Leping Yu, Liu Yang, Lejia Wang, Xi Yu
Abstract: Materials synthesis procedures are predominantly documented as narrative text in protocols and lab notebooks, rendering them inaccessible to conventional structured data optimization. This language-native nature poses a critical challenge for complex, multistage processes--such as the preparation of boron nitride nanosheet (BNNS)--where outcomes depend on path-dependent choices in exfoliation and functionalization. Here, we recast synthesis planning as a text reasoning task enabled by a lightly structured text database, which preserves the conditional logic and causal contexts essential for expert-like decision-making. Building on a heterogeneous schema that indexes both narrative excerpts and computable entities (e.g., reaction conditions), our system implements a hybrid retrieval engine to combine semantic context with precise parameter filtering. On top of this, the framework operates in two modes, i.e. retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), which grounds recommendations in retrieved evidence modules, and experience-augmented reasoning (EAR), which uses iteratively refined text guides distilled from multi-source narrative data. Instead of suggesting single "optimal" settings, the system produces interpretable guidance aligned with expert reasoning patterns--hypotheses, parameter ranges, and citation-backed standard operating procedures--that support iterative planning and failure diagnosis. We validated this framework on the targeted exfoliation of BNNS, a process highly sensitive to multivariate constraints. The system successfully identified optimal combinations of grinding aids, milling configurations, and separation strategies from a wide range of literature-reported methods, which were experimentally verified to yield high-quality nanosheets, illustrating the potential of language-native reasoning to streamline critical operations in materials processing.

Title: Impact of Nitrogen and Oxygen Interstitials on Niobium SRF Cavity Performance
Authors: Hannah Hu, Young-Kee Kim, Daniel Bafia
Abstract: Superconducting radiofrequency (SRF) cavities are the leading technology for highly efficient particle acceleration, and their performance can be significantly enhanced through the controlled introduction of interstitial impurities into bulk niobium. Nitrogen doping has demonstrated a substantial reduction in surface resistance, which improves the quality factor of the cavities. More recently, oxygen doping has emerged as a promising alternative, demonstrating comparable reductions in surface resistance. In this study, we combine cavity measurements on 1.3 GHz niobium SRF cavities subjected to a range of nitrogen- and oxygen-based treatments with material characterizations performed on cavity cutouts processed under identical conditions. This approach allows us to quantitatively assess the contribution of each impurity to the reduction of surface resistance. We find that nitrogen is ten times more effective than oxygen in reducing surface resistance at 16 MV/m. We also observe an additive effect of O and N impurities in reducing R$_\mathrm{T}$. We discuss these results in the context of field dependent nonequilibrium superconductivity, gap enhancement, and hydrogen trapping mechanisms.

Title: Spatiotemporal stability of synchronized coupled map lattice states
Authors: Domenico Lippolis
Abstract: In the realm of spatiotemporal chaos, unstable periodic orbits play a major role in understanding the dynamics. Their stability changes and bifurcations in general are thus of central interest. Here, coupled map lattice discretizations of nonlinear partial differential equations, exhibiting a variety of behaviors depending on the coupling strength, are considered. In particular, the linear stability analysis of synchronized states is performed by evaluating the Bravais lattice orbit Jacobian in its reciprocal space first Brillouin zone, with space and time treated on equal grounds. The eigenvalues of the orbit Jacobian operator, computed as functions of the coupling strength, tell us about the stability of the periodic orbit under a perturbation of a certain time- and space frequency. Moreover, the stability under aperiodic, that is, incoherent perturbations, is revealed by integrating the sum of the stability exponents over all space-time frequencies.

Title: Analytically Continuing the Randomized Measurement Toolbox
Authors: Akash Vijay, Ayush Raj, Jonah Kudler-Flam, Benoît Vermersch, Andreas Elben, Laimei Nie
Abstract: We develop a framework for extracting non-polynomial analytic functions of density matrices in randomized measurement experiments by a method of analytical continuation. A central advantage of this approach, dubbed stabilized analytic continuation (SAC), is its robustness to statistical noise arising from finite repetitions of a quantum experiment, making it well-suited to realistic quantum hardware. As a demonstration, we use SAC to estimate the von Neumann entanglement entropy of a numerically simulated quenched Néel state from Rényi entropies estimated via the randomized measurement protocol. We then apply the method to experimental Rényi data from a trapped-ion quantum simulator, extracting subsystem von Neumann entropies at different evolution times. Finally, we briefly note that the SAC framework is readily generalizable to obtain other nonlinear diagnostics, such as the logarithmic negativity and Rényi relative entropies.

Title: Asymptotic-freedom and massive glueballs in a qubit-regularized SU(2) gauge theory
Authors: Rui Xian Siew, Shailesh Chandrasekharan, Tanmoy Bhattacharya
Abstract: We argue that a simple qubit-regularized $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ lattice gauge theory (LGT) on a plaquette chain serves as a pseudo-one-dimensional toy model for Yang-Mills (YM) theory in three spatial dimensions. We map the chain Hamiltonian to the Transverse Field Ising Model (TFIM) in a uniform magnetic field and demonstrate that it can be tuned to a continuum limit in which the short-distance physics is governed by the asymptotically free Ising conformal field theory (CFT) describing free Majorana fermions, while the long-distance regime contains massive excitations of the $E_8$ quantum field theory (QFT) that can be interpreted as one-dimensional analogues of glueballs. Furthermore, we find $\sqrt{\sigma}/m_1 = 0.249(1)$ where $\sigma$ is the string tension between two static quarks and $m_1$ is the mass of the lightest glueball.

Title: Collective behavior based on agent-environment interactions
Authors: Gaston Briozzo, Gustavo J. Sibona, Fernando Peruani
Abstract: We present a model of active particles interacting through a dynamic, heterogeneous environment, leading to emergent collective behaviors without direct agent-to-agent communication. Expanding the resource-dependent framework introduced in Briozzo et al., 2025, arXiv:2512.08762, agents perform a persistent random walk combined with chemotaxis, directing toward nutrient-rich patches, whose resources are generated by logistic regrowth. We identify distinct phases of collective organization, ranging from disordered gas-like states to polar traveling waves and nematic independent clusters, depending on the interplay between chemotactic sensitivity and angular noise. The system exhibits spontaneous symmetry breaking and density waves driven purely by the coupling between population dynamics (birth-death processes) and environmental feedback. Our results bridge active matter physics and movement ecology, demonstrating that complex spatiotemporal patterns can arise without direct interaction between agents, but solely from the maximization of resource intake in a reactive environment.

Title: Creation of ultracold heteronuclear p-wave Feshbach molecules
Authors: Fan Jia, Zhichao Guo, Zerong Huang, Dajun Wang
Abstract: We report the creation of optically trapped ultracold heteronuclear p-wave Feshbach molecules in a mixture of 23Na and 87Rb atoms. With loss spectroscopy and binding energy measurements, we systematically characterize the interspecies p-wave Feshbach resonances near 284 G. Leveraging this understanding, we use magneto-association to form p-wave NaRb Feshbach molecules, producing both pure samples and mixtures of molecules in different angular momentum states. Additionally, we investigate the inelastic loss of these molecules, primarily influenced by atom-molecule and molecule-molecule collisions. Our results represent a significant step toward realizing tunable p-wave interactions in heteronuclear ultracold systems and provide a foundation for exploring non-zero angular momentum molecules.
