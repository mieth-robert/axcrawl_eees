Title: Microrheology with rotational Brownian motion
Authors: Yasuya Nakayama
Abstract: Passive rotational microrheology (RMR) for evaluating the dynamic modulus \(G^*\) of a suspending fluid through the rotational Brownian motion of a spherical probe particle is validated using direct numerical simulations (DNS) of Brownian motion in a viscoelastic fluid. Two methods of RMR are compared: an inertialess RMR based on the Generalized Stokes--Einstein relation for rotational diffusion (RGSER) and the full RMR based on the generalized Langevin equation for rotation, which accounts for fluid and particle inertia. Our analysis, performed using DNS of the fluctuating Oldroyd-B fluid, reveals that inertialess RMR accurately estimates \(G^*\) for \(\omega\lambda \alt 1\), but deviates significantly at high frequencies. In contrast, the full RMR improves \(G^*\) estimation accuracy up to the frequency \(\omega \approx \tau_{s}^{-1}=\eta_{s}/\rho_{f}a^{2}\), where fluid inertia becomes relevant. However, in the ballistic regime (\(t \ll \tau_{s}\)), particle inertia dominates, making accurate \(G^*\) evaluation challenging even with the full RMR. This study clarifies the applicability range of RMR. Additionally, rotational Brownian motion is turned out to be insensitive to periodic boundary conditions, which allows direct application to various mesoscale molecular simulations, including coarse-grained molecular dynamics, dissipative particle dynamics, and fluid dynamics simulations. In conclusion, rotational microrheology offers a promising approach for detailed rheological analysis in complex systems and conditions.

Title: Mott transition from the non-analyticity of the one-body reduced density-matrix functional
Authors: Zhengqian Cheng, Chris A. Marianetti
Abstract: One-body reduced density-matrix functional (1RDMF) theory has yielded promising results for small systems such as molecules, but has not addressed quantum phase transitions such as the Mott transition. Here we explicitly execute the constrained search within a variational ansatz to construct a 1RDMF for the multi-orbital Hubbard model with up to seven orbitals in the thermodynamic limit. The variational ansatz is the \mathcal{N}=3 ansatz of the variational discrete action theory (VDAT), which can be exactly evaluated in d=\infty. The resulting 1RDMF exactly encapsulates the \mathcal{N}=3 VDAT results, which accurately captures Mott and Hund physics. We find that non-analytic behavior emerges in our 1RDMF at fixed integer filling, which gives rise to the Mott transition. We explain this behavior by separating the constrained search into multiple stages, illustrating how a nonzero Hund exchange drives the continuous Mott transition to become first-order. Our approach creates a new path forward for constructing an accurate 1RDMF for strongly correlated electron materials.

Title: Matrix Product Operator Constructions for Gauge Theories in the Thermodynamic Limit
Authors: Nicholas Godfrey, Ian P. McCulloch
Abstract: We present a general method for simulating lattice gauge theories in low dimensions using infinite matrix product states (iMPS). A central challenge in Hamiltonian formulations of gauge theories is the unbounded local Hilbert space associated with gauge degrees of freedom. In one spatial dimension, Gauss's law permits these gauge fields to be integrated out, yielding an effective Hamiltonian with long-range interactions among matter fields. We construct efficient matrix product operator (MPO) representations of these Hamiltonians directly in the thermodynamic limit. Our formulation naturally includes background fields and $\theta$-terms, requiring no modifications to the standard iDMRG algorithm. This provides a broadly applicable framework for 1+1D gauge theories and can be extended to quasi-two-dimensional geometries such as infinite cylinders, where tensor-network methods remain tractable. As a benchmark, we apply our construction to the Schwinger model, reproducing expected features including confinement, string breaking, and the critical behavior at finite mass. Because the method alters only the MPO structure, it can be incorporated with little effort into a wide range of iMPS and infinite-boundary-condition algorithms, opening the way to efficient studies of both equilibrium and non-equilibrium gauge dynamics.

Title: The numerical case for identifying paired quantum Hall phases by their daughters
Authors: Misha Yutushui, Arjun Dey, David F. Mross
Abstract: Many candidate non-Abelian quantum Hall states are accompanied by nearby `daughter' states, which are proposed to identify their topological order. Combining exact diagonalization and trial wave functions, we provide numerical evidence that daughter states reliably predict the parent topological phase. In the contexts of bilayer graphene and wide GaAs quantum wells, we show that the same interactions simultaneously stabilize Pfaffian, anti-Pfaffian, and their daughters, while suppressing the Jain states. The competition between Pfaffian and anti-Pfaffian, which is decided by particle-hole symmetry-breaking interactions, can likewise be deduced from their daughters. These findings strongly support the daughter-state-based identification of non-Abelian quantum Hall phases.

Title: Average weighted ratio of consecutive level spacings for infinite-dimensional orthogonal random matrices
Authors: Wouter Buijsman
Abstract: The onset of quantum ergodicity is often quantified by the average ratio of consecutive level spacings. The reference values for ergodic quantum systems have been obtained numerically from the spectra of large but finite-dimensional random matrices. This work introduces a weighted ratio of consecutive level spacings, having the propery that the average can be computed numerically for random matrices of infinite dimension. A Painlevé differential equation is solved numerically in order to determine this average for infinite-dimensional orthogonal random matrices, thereby providing a reference value for ergodic quantum systems obeying time-reversal symmetry. A Wigner surmise-inspired analytical calculation is found to yield a qualitatively accurate picture for the statistics of high-dimensional random matrices from each of the symmetry classes. For Poissonian level statistics, a significantly different average is found, indicating that the average weighted ratio of consecutive level spacings can be used as a probe for quantum ergodicity.

Title: Topologically trivial semiconducting behavior and polaronic effects in antiferromagnetic EuZn$_2$As$_2$ and EuCd$_2$Sb$_2$
Authors: Divyanshi Sar, Mingda Gong, Tetiana Romanova, Luka Khizanishvili, Hannah Park, Dariusz Kaczorowski, Wei-Cheng Lee, Pegor Aynajian
Abstract: The Eu-based EuA$_2$X$_2$ (A = Zn, Cd, In, Sn; X = P, As, Sb) family of compounds has recently attracted significant attention as a promising platform for exploring magnetic topological materials, with several members either predicted or reported to exhibit nontrivial topological properties. We investigate the previously reported topological semimetals, EuZn$_2$As$_2$ and EuCd$_2$Sb$_2$, using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, complemented by various first-principles computational approaches. Through examination of the cleaved surfaces, step-edges, and defect states, we determine the trivial semiconducting behavior in both material systems, with no evidence of topological surface or edge states. These experimental results are consistent with our theoretical analysis revealing the absence of topological band inversion in either system. Our experimental observations also reveal numerous intrinsic defects that trap charge carriers. These defects may facilitate the formation of magnetic polarons, providing a natural explanation for the colossal negative magnetoresistance observed in many of the EuA$_2$X$_2$ material systems.

Title: Non-invertible symmetries out of equilibrium
Authors: Yabo Li, Aditi Mitra
Abstract: Through the study of the Rep($D_8$) non-invertible symmetry, we show how non-invertible symmetries manifest in dynamics. By considering the effect of symmetry preserving disorder, the non-invertible symmetry is shown to give rise to degeneracies in the spectra that can only be completely lifted at orders of perturbation that scale with system size. The eigenstates of disordered Hamiltonians, whose ground state correspond to non-trivial symmetry protected topological (SPT) states, are shown to have either trivial or non-trivial SPT order that are detected as non-zero expectation value of string order-parameters. In contrast, non-trivial SPT order is absent in the eigenstates of trivial SPT Hamiltonians with disorder. The interface between two different SPT phases host edge modes whose dynamics is studied numerically and analytically. The edge mode is shown to oscillate at frequencies related to different effective chain lengths that are weighted by the temperature, becoming an exact zero mode in the limit of zero temperature. A Floquet model with the non-invertible symmetry is constructed whose edge mode is shown to exhibit period-doubled dynamics at low effective-temperatures.

Title: NV-like Defects More Common Than Four-Leaf Clovers: A Perspective on High-Throughput Point Defect Data
Authors: Joel Davidsson
Abstract: Point defects for quantum technologies is an emerging research area, with the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond at the forefront. However, how rare are defects with NV-like properties? In this perspective, I highlight the results of NV-like defects across 17 different materials, revealing that they are more common than finding four-leaf clovers. I also discuss expanding the search criteria to identify other defects relevant to quantum technologies. Utilizing point defect databases will be instrumental in assisting researchers in discovering previously unexplored defects suitable for quantum technologies.

Title: Engineering and exploiting self-driven domain wall motion in ferrimagnets for neuromorphic computing applications
Authors: Jeffrey A. Brock, Aleksandr Kurenkov, Aleš Hrabec, Laura J. Heyderman
Abstract: Magnetic domain wall motion has recently garnered significant interest as a physical mechanism to enable energy-efficient, next-generation brain-inspired computing architectures. However, realizing all behaviors required for neuromorphic computing within standard material systems remains a significant challenge, as these functionalities often rely on competing interactions. Here, we demonstrate how spontaneous domain wall motion in response to locally engineered lateral exchange coupling in transition metal-rare earth ferrimagnets can be leveraged to achieve numerous neuromorphic computing functionalities in devices with minimal complexity. Through experiments and micromagnetic simulations, we show how tuning the feature size, material composition, and chiral interaction strength controls the speed of self-driven domain wall motion. When integrated with spin-orbit torque, this control gives rise to behaviors essential for neuromorphic computing, including leaky integration and passive resetting of artificial neuron potential. These results establish locally engineered ferrimagnets as a tunable, scalable, and straightforward platform for domain wall-based computing architectures.

Title: Lattice anharmonicity effects in fluorite oxide single crystals and anomalous increase in phonon lifetime in ceria at elevated temperature
Authors: Amey Khanolkar, Saqeeb Adnan, Md Minaruzzaman, Linu Malakkal, Darren B. Thomson, David B. Turner, J. Matthew Mann, David H. Hurley, Marat Khafizov
Abstract: We investigate the temperature dependence of the frequency and linewidth of the triply-degenerate T$_{2g}$ zone-centered optical phonon in flux-grown ceria and hydrothermally-synthesized thoria single crystals from room temperature to 1273 K using Raman spectroscopy. Both crystals exhibit an expected increase in the phonon linewidth with temperature due to enhanced phonon-phonon scattering. However, ceria displays an anomalous linewidth reduction in the temperature range of 1023-1123 K. First-principles phonon linewidth calculations considering cubic and quartic phonon interactions within temperature-independent phonon dispersion fail to describe this anomaly. A parameterization of the temperature-dependent second order interatomic force constants based on previously reported phonon dispersion measured at room and high temperatures, predicts a deviation from the monotonic linewidth increase, albeit at temperatures lower than those observed experimentally for ceria. The qualitative agreement in the trend of temperature-dependent linewidth suggests that lattice anharmonicity-induced phonon renormalization plays a role in phonon lifetime. Specifically, a change in the overlap between softened acoustic and optical branches in the dispersion curve reduces the available phonon scattering phase space of the Raman active mode at the zone center, leading to an increased phonon lifetime within a narrow temperature interval. These findings provide new insights into higher-order anharmonic interactions in ceria and thoria, motivating further investigations into the role of anharmonicity-induced phonon renormalization on phonon lifetimes at high temperatures.

Title: Real-space first-principles approach to orbitronic phenomena in metallic multilayers
Authors: Ramon Cardias, Hugo U. R. Strand, Anders Bergman, A. B. Klautau, Tatiana G. Rappoport
Abstract: We develop a real-space first-principles method based on density functional theory to investigate orbitronic phenomena in complex materials. Using the Real-Space Linear Muffin-Tin Orbital method within the Atomic Sphere Approximation (RS-LMTO-ASA) combined with a Chebyshev polynomial expansion of the Green's functions, we compute orbital (spin) Hall transport and orbital (spin) accumulation directly in real space. The approach scales linearly with system size and naturally incorporates disorder, finite-size effects, and interface roughness. We apply the method to transition-metal-based heterostructures and demonstrate the emergence of substantial orbital (spin) accumulation, even in centrosymmetric systems. Our methodology provides a scalable and flexible framework for realistic simulations of orbital transport phenomena in complex heterostructures.

Title: Role of electron-electron interactions in $M$-valley twisted transition metal dichalcogenides
Authors: Christophe De Beule, Liangtao Peng, E. J. Mele, Shaffique Adam
Abstract: We investigate the role of long-range Coulomb interactions in $M$-valley moiré systems using the self-consistent Hartree-Fock approximation. This platform was recently proposed [Nature 643, 376 (2025) and arXiv:2411.18828 (2024)] as a new class of experimentally realizable moiré materials using twisted transition metal dichalcogenides homobilayers with the 1T structure. While these seminal studies considered the noninteracting theory without an interlayer bias due to an electric displacement field, this work shows that both electron-electron interactions at finite doping and an interlayer bias strongly modify the moiré bands. For small twist angles, the density of states as a function of filling and interlayer bias shows qualitatively different behavior for twisting near aligned ($0^\circ$) and antialigned ($60^\circ$) stacking. More interestingly, the Van Hove singularity becomes pinned to the Fermi energy over a finite range of doping, an effect known to enhance both superconductivity and strongly correlated states. For aligned stacking this occurs only at zero electric field, while for antialigned stacking this happens both at zero and finite field. Our work demonstrates that correlated states in $M$-valley 1TtTMDs can be strongly tuned \textit{in situ} both by applying an electric displacement field and by electron doping.

Title: Machine-learning interatomic potentials achieving CCSD(T) accuracy for van-der-Waals-dominated systems via Δ-learning
Authors: Yuji Ikeda, Axel Forslund, Pranav Kumar, Yongliang Ou, Jong Hyun Jung, Andreas Köhn, Blazej Grabowski
Abstract: Machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) enable large-scale atomistic simulations at moderate computational cost while retaining ab initio accuracy. However, most MLIPs are trained on density-functional theory (DFT), which often falls short of chemical accuracy (1 kcal/mol). Conversely, coupled-cluster methods, particularly CCSD(T), which includes single, double, and perturbative triple excitations, are considered the gold standard of computational chemistry but rarely applied to periodic systems due to their huge computational cost. Here we present a $\Delta$-learning workflow to produce interatomic potentials with CCSD(T) accuracy for periodic systems including van der Waals (vdW) interactions. The procedure combines a dispersion-corrected tight-binding baseline with an MLIP trained on the differences of the target CCSD(T) energies from the baseline. This $\Delta$-learning strategy enables training on compact molecular fragments while preserving transferability. The dispersion interactions are captured by including vdW-bound multimers in the training set; together with the vdW-aware tight-binding baseline, the formally local MLIP attains CCSD(T) accuracy for systems governed by long-range vdW forces. The resulting potential yields root-mean-square energy errors below 0.4 meV/atom on both training and test sets and reproduces electronic total atomization energies, bond lengths, harmonic vibrational frequencies, and inter-molecular interaction energies for benchmark molecular systems. We apply the method to a prototypical quasi-two-dimensional covalent organic framework (COF) composed of carbon and hydrogen. The COF structure, inter-layer binding energies, and hydrogen absorption are analyzed at CCSD(T) accuracy. Overall, the developed $\Delta$-learning approach opens a practical route to large-scale atomistic simulations that include vdW interactions with chemical accuracy.

Title: Quadrupole-conserving dynamics in the non-commutative plane
Authors: Isabella Zane, Andrew Lucas
Abstract: Inspired by ``fracton hydrodynamic" universality classes of dynamics with unusual conservation laws, we present a new dynamical universality class that arises out of local area-preserving dynamics in the non-commutative plane. On this symplectic manifold, the area-preserving spatial symmetry group $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})\rtimes \mathbb{R}^2$ is a symmetry group compatible with non-trivial many-body dynamics. The conservation laws associated to this symmetry group correspond to the dipole and quadrupole moments of the particles. We study the unusual dynamics of a crystal lattice subject to such symmetries, and argue that the hydrodynamic description of lattice dynamics breaks down due to relevant nonlinearities. Numerical simulations of classical Hamiltonian dynamical systems with this symmetry are largely consistent with a tree-level effective field theory estimate for the endpoint of this instability.

Title: Modeling of silver transport in cubic SiC: Integrating molecular dynamics, bounds averaging, and uncertainty quantification
Authors: Mohamed AbdulHameed, Khadija Mahbuba, Mahmoud Yaseen, Amr Ibrahim, Daniel Moneghan, Benjamin Beeler
Abstract: Silver released from TRISO fuel particles can migrate through the SiC layer and deposit on reactor components, posing radiation hazards and operational challenges. Despite numerous proposed mechanisms, the precise pathway of silver transport through intact 3C-SiC remains unresolved. We present a physics-informed model for estimating the effective diffusivity of silver in polycrystalline 3C-SiC. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations yield diffusivities for {\Sigma 3} and {\Sigma 9} grain boundaries (GBs), while literature values are used for other GB types and the bulk. These are combined using a bounds-averaging approach accounting for distinct GB transport properties. Bayesian inference of experimental data provides credible intervals for effective Arrhenius parameters and reveals a correlation between activation energy and pre-exponential factor. Although the homogenized model captures GB-mediated transport mechanisms, it overpredicts silver diffusivity relative to experiments. To resolve this, a multiplicative correction based on reversible trapping at nano-pores is introduced. It is derived from first principles and is shown to reproduce observed transport behavior. Sensitivity analysis identified trap desorption energy and {\Sigma 9} GB diffusivity as dominant factors influencing Ag transport. The resulting framework provides a mechanistic description of Ag transport suitable for integration into higher-scale fuel performance models.

Title: Modeling oxygen-void interactions in uranium nitride
Authors: Mohamed AbdulHameed, Anton J. Schneider, Benjamin Beeler, Michael W.D. Cooper
Abstract: Oxygen impurities in uranium nitride (UN) are reported to influence its swelling behavior under irradiation, yet the underlying mechanism remains unknown. In this work, we develop a first-principles model that quantifies the interaction of oxygen with voids and fission gas bubbles in UN, leading to a reduction in surface energy that can promote swelling. The analysis reveals that segregation of substitutional oxygen at surface nitrogen sites is the primary driver of surface energy reduction, $|\Delta \sigma|$, while oxygen in surface hollow sites plays a minor and sometimes counteracting role. $|\Delta \sigma|$ is most pronounced for small cavities ($R_v$ = 1--10 nm) at intermediate temperatures that coincide with the onset of breakaway swelling in UN. Larger voids require higher temperatures for oxygen adsorption to significantly lower their surface energy. The temperature dependence of $|\Delta \sigma|$ exhibits three regimes: negligible reduction at low temperatures due to sluggish oxygen diffusion, a maximum at intermediate temperatures where oxygen incorporation is optimal, and a decline at high temperatures due to enhanced bulk solubility. A parametric analysis reveals that $|\Delta \sigma|$ depends strongly on both oxygen concentration and cavity size, but is largely insensitive to porosity. Our results suggest that oxygen-induced surface energy reduction is essential for reconciling the mechanistic swelling model of UN with experimental observations.

Title: Cavity-mediated multispin interactions and phase transitions in ultracold Fermi gases
Authors: Zhen Zheng, Shi-Liang Zhu, Z. D. Wang
Abstract: The many-body physics of higher-spin systems is expected to host qualitatively new matter phases, but realizing them requires the controllable multispin interactions that can be tuned independently for each spin component. Here we propose a scheme that meets this demand in ultracold Fermi gases. By engineering the atom-cavity coupling, we generate cavity-mediated effective interactions between arbitrary pseudo-spin states. Focusing on the simplest three-spin case, we obtain two independent scattering channels whose strengths and signs can be adjusted separately. The resulting Hamiltonian combines the on-site attraction with the off-site repulsion, and drives a continuous transition from the superfluid to the spin-density-wave phase. The coexistence region is reminiscent of a supersolid, yet the self-organized modulation appears in the spin space of a higher-spin representation, rather than in the density profile. The proposal is reliable to be implemented using the existing techniques of ultracold atoms. Therefore it offers a versatile platform for quantum simulation of higher-spin many-body physics.

Title: Single layer clathrane: A potential superconducting two-dimensional (2D) hydrogenated metal borocarbide
Authors: Xiaoyu Wang, Warren E. Pickett, Matthew N. Julian, Rohit P. Prasankumar, Eva Zurek
Abstract: We propose a new family of two-dimensional (2D) metal-borocarbide clathrane superconductors, derived from three-dimensional (3D) MM$^\prime$B$_6$C$_6$ clathrates. First-principles calculations reveal that hydrogen passivation and surface metal decoration stabilize the M$_2$M$^\prime$B$_8$C$_8$H$_8$ monolayers. These 2D systems exhibit tunable superconductivity governed by hole concentration, structural anisotropy, and electron-phonon coupling. We find that in-plane anisotropy competes with superconductivity, reducing \tc\ despite favorable doping. Biaxial strain mitigates this anisotropy, enhances Fermi surface nesting, and increases \tc\ by an average of 15.5~K. For example, the \tc\ of Sr$_3$B$_8$C$_8$H$_8$ is predicted to increase from 11.3~K to 22.2~K with strain engineering. These findings identify 2D clathranes as promising, strain-tunable superconductors and highlight design principles for optimizing low-dimensional superconducting materials.

Title: Jahn-Teller-like Distortion in a One-dimensional π-Conjugated Polymer
Authors: Ziyi Wang, Boyu Qie, Weichen Tang, Jingwei Jiang, Fujia Liu, Peter H. Jacobse, Jiaming Lu, Xinheng Li, Steven G. Louie, Felix R. Fischer, Michael F. Crommie
Abstract: Structurally distorting low-dimensional {\pi}-conjugated systems can profoundly influence their electronic properties, but controlling such behavior in extended-width systems remains challenging. Here we demonstrate that a one-dimensional conjugated polymer, poly-(difluorenoheptalene-ethynylene) (PDFHE), undergoes a pronounced out-of-plane backbone distortion, equivalent to a spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) of its mirror symmetry. We synthesized PDFHE on noble metal surfaces and characterized its structure and electronic states using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy. Rather than adopting a planar, high-symmetry conformation, PDFHE relaxes into non-planar isomers stabilized by a Jahn-Teller-like mechanism that relieves an electronic instability relative to the gapped planar structure. Density functional theory calculations corroborate these findings, revealing that distortion lowers the total polymer energy and enlarges the bandgap, providing a microscopic explanation for the SSB. Our results show that even in mechanically robust extended {\pi}-systems, subtle electron-lattice coupling can spontaneously drive significant structural rearrangements.

Title: Orbital magnetic moments in FeCr2S4 studied by x-ray magnetic circular dichroism
Authors: V. K. Verma, J. Patra, V. R. Singh, Y. Nonaka, G. Shibata, K. Ishigami, K. Ohgushi, Y. Tokura, T. Koide, A. Fujimori
Abstract: We have investigated the element specific magnetic characteristics of single-crystal FeCr2S4 using x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD). We have found that the Fe L2,3-edge XAS spectra do not exhibit clear multiplet structures, indicating strong hybridization between the Fe 3d and S 3p orbitals, leading to delocalized rather than localized electronic states. The Fe 3d and Cr 3d spin moments are antiferromagnetically coupled, consistent with the Goodenough-Kanamori rule. The orbital magnetic moments of Fe and Cr are determined to be -0.23 and -0.017 {\mu}B/ion, respectively. The large orbital magnetic moment of Fe is due to the d6 configuration under the relatively weak tetrahedra crystal field at the Fe site, and the delocalized Fe electrons maintain the orbital degree of freedom in spite of their itinerant nature. To understand phenomena such as the gigantic Kerr rotation, it is essential to consider not only the orbital degrees of freedom but also the role of spin-orbit coupling, which induces a finite orbital magnetic moment through t2 and e level hybridization under the tetrahedral crystal field. This finite orbital moment serves as a direct indicator of spin-orbit interaction strength and links element-specific orbital magnetism to the large Kerr rotation. On the other hand, the octahedral crystal-field splitting of the Cr 3d level is large enough to result in the quenching of the orbital moment of the Cr ion in FeCr2S4.

Title: Nonperturbative quantum field theory for pseudo-Goldstone modes, slow-Goldstone modes, and their quantum chaos
Authors: Fadi Sun, Jinwu Ye
Abstract: In this work, we develop a novel form of non-perturbative theory to identify a light pseudo-Goldstone mode with a small mass, as well as a new type of Goldstone mode with a tiny slope (termed the slow-Goldstone mode), which may not be obtained via traditional perturbative methods. We demonstrate our formalism in the context of superfluids formed by Rashba spin-orbit coupled spinor bosons in a square lattice weakly interacting with a spin-anisotropic interaction. The experimental detections of these two modes, especially their roles leading to the quantum information scramblings at a finite temperature are discussed. The slow-Goldstone mode is compared with the slow light and the soft mode in the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev models. This non-perturbative formalism can be widely applied to study other emergent particles in various quantum matter.

Title: Dynamic Vacancy Levels in CsPbCl3 Obey Equilibrium Defect Thermodynamics
Authors: Irea Mosquera-Lois, Aron Walsh
Abstract: Halide vacancies are the dominant point defects in perovskites with $V_\mathrm{Cl}$ identified as a detrimental trap for the optoelectronic performance of CsPbCl$_3$, with applications ranging from photodetectors to solar cells. Understanding these defects under operating conditions is key since their electronic levels exhibit large thermal fluctuations that challenge the validity of static 0 K models. However, quantitative modelling of defect processes requires hybrid density functional theory with spin-orbit coupling, which is too expensive for direct molecular dynamic simulations. To address this, we train a multi-task machine learning force field to study $V_\mathrm{Cl}$ in orthorhombic CsPbCl$_3$ at 300 this http URL we observe strong oscillations in the optical transition level arising from the soft potential energy surface, neither the non-radiative capture barriers nor the thermodynamic charge transition levels are affected. Our results reveal that $V_\mathrm{Cl}$ is not responsible for the non-radiative losses previously assumed. Instead, its impact on performance arises from other mechanisms, such as limiting the open-circuit voltage and promoting ionic migration. Our findings demonstrate that, despite strong dynamical effects in halide perovskites, the conventional static formalism of defect theory remains valid for predicting thermodynamic behavior, providing a sound basis for the design of high-performance energy materials.

Title: A framework for finite-strain viscoelasticity based on rheological representations
Authors: Chongran Zhao, Hongyan Yuan, Ju Liu
Abstract: This work presents a new constitutive and computational framework based on strain-like internal variables belonging to Sym(3) and two representative rheological configurations. The generalized Maxwell and generalized Kelvin-Voigt models are considered as prototypes for parallelly and serially connected rheological devices, respectively. For each configuration, distinct kinematic assumptions are introduced. The constitutive theory is derived based on thermomechanical principles, where the free energies capture recoverable elastic responses and dissipation potentials govern irreversible mechanisms. The evolution equations for the internal variables arise from the principle of maximum dissipation. A key insight is the structural distinction in the constitutive laws resulted from the two rheological architectures. In particular, the Kelvin-Voigt model leads to evolution equations with non-equilibrium processes coupled, which pose computational challenges for the constitutive integration. To address this, we exploit the Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury formula and extend it to tensorial equations to design an efficient strategy during constitutive integration. With that strategy, the integration can be performed based on an explicit update formula, and the algorithmic complexity scales linearly with the number of non-equilibrium processes. This framework offers both modeling flexibility and computational feasibility for simulating materials with multiple non-equilibrium processes and complex rheological architectures under finite strain.

Title: Influence of local strain on the optical probing of a Ni$^{2+}$ spin in a charged self-assembled quantum dot
Authors: K. E. Polczynska, S. Karouaz, W. Pacuski, L. Besombes
Abstract: This study explores the optical properties of quantum dots doped with a Ni$^{2+}$ ion that interacts with a charged exciton. Systematic magneto-optical analysis reveals that the strain distribution at the Ni$^{2+}$ site significantly influences its spin structure. In positively charged dots dominated by in-plane biaxial strain, the three spins states of the Ni$^{2+}$ (S$_z$=0, S$_z$=$\pm$1) can be observed and the magneto-optical spectra enables a local strain anisotropy to be determined. However, in most of the dots, lower-symmetry strain mixes all the Ni$^{2+}$ spin states, thereby increasing the number of observed optical transitions. In charged dots, we identify optical transitions that share a common excited state. They form a series of $\Lambda$ levels systems that can be individually addressed optically to determine the energy level structure. Magneto-optical measurements demonstrate that the hole-Ni$^{2+}$ exchange interaction is antiferromagnetic and considerably stronger than the electron-Ni$^{2+}$ interaction. A spin-effective model that incorporates local strain orientation can successfully reproduce key experimental results. Furthermore, we demonstrate that low-symmetry terms in the hole-Ni$^{2+}$ exchange interaction must be considered in order to accurately describe the emission spectra details in a magnetic field.

Title: Electron charge dynamics and charge separation: A response theory approach
Authors: Lionel Lacombe, Lucia Reining, Vitaly Gorelov
Abstract: This study applies response theory to investigate electron charge dynamics, with a particular focus on charge separation. We analytically assess the strengths and limitations of linear and quadratic response theories in describing charge density and current, illustrated by a model that simulates charge transfer systems. While linear response accurately captures optical properties, the quadratic response contains the minimal ingredients required to describe charge dynamics and separation. Notably, it closely matches exact time propagation results in some regime that we identify. We propose and test several approximations to the quadratic response and explore the influence of higher-order terms and the effect of an on-site interaction $U$.

Title: Altermagnetic magnon transport in the \textit{d}-wave altermagnet \ch{LuFeO3}
Authors: Edgar Galindez-Ruales, Wanting Yang, Tobias Dannegger Moumita Kundu, Jonas Köhler, Christin Schmitt Felix Fuhrmann, Akashdeep Akashdeep, Duc Minh Tran Xiaoxuan Ma, Gerhard Jakob, Shixun Cao, Ulrich Nowak, Mathias Kläui
Abstract: Altermagnets exhibit a spin-split band structure despite having zero net magnetization, leading to special magnonic properties such as anisotropic magnon lifetimes and field-free spin transport. Here, we present a direct experimental demonstration of non-local magnon transport in the \textit{d}-wave altermagnet \ch{LuFeO3}, using both spin Seebeck and spin Hall effect-based injection and detection. We observe a non-local spin signal at zero magnetic field when the transport is along an altermagnetic direction, but not for transport along other directions. The observed sign reversal between two distinct altermagnetic directions in the spin Seebeck response demonstrates the altermagnetic nature of the magnon transport. In contrast, when transport is aligned along or perpendicular to the easy axis, both the first-harmonic signal and the sign-reversal effect vanish, consistent with symmetry-imposed suppression. These findings are supported by atomistic spin dynamics simulations, as well as linear spin wave theory calculations, which explain how our altermagnetic system hosts anisotropic spin Seebeck transport. Our results provide direct evidence of direction-dependent magnon splitting in altermagnets and highlight their potential for field-free magnonic spin transport, offering a promising pathway for low-power spintronic applications.

Title: Fabrication, characterization and mechanical loading of Si/SiGe membranes for spin qubit devices
Authors: Lucas Marcogliese, Ouviyan Sabapathy, Rudolf Richter, Jhih-Sian Tu, Dominique Bougeard, Lars R. Schreiber
Abstract: Si/SiGe heterostructures on bulk Si substrates have been shown to host high fidelity electron spin qubits. Building a scalable quantum processor would, however, benefit from further improvement of critical material properties such as the valley splitting landscape. Flexible control of the strain field and the out-of-plane electric field $\mathcal{E}_z$ may be decisive for valley splitting enhancement in the presence of alloy disorder. We envision the Si/SiGe membrane as a versatile scientific platform for investigating intervalley scattering mechanisms which have thus far remained elusive in conventional Si/SiGe heterostructures and have the potential to yield favourable valley splitting distributions. Here, we report the fabrication of locally-etched, suspended SiGe/Si/SiGe membranes from two different heterostructures and apply the process to realize a spin qubit shuttling device on a membrane for future valley mapping experiments. The membranes have a thickness in the micrometer range and can be metallized to form a back-gate contact for extended control over the electric field. To probe their elastic properties, the membranes are stressed by loading with a profilometer stylus at room temperature. We distinguish between linear elastic and buckling modes, each offering new mechanisms through which strain can be coupled to spin qubits.

Title: Correlated phases in rhombohedral N-layer graphene
Authors: Arsen Herasymchuk, Sergei G. Sharapov, Oleg V. Yazyev, Yaroslav Zhumagulov
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of correlated electron phases in rhombohedral $N$-layer graphene due to two-valley Coulomb interactions within a low-energy $k \cdot p$ framework. Analytical expressions for Lindhard susceptibilities in intra- and intervalley channels are derived, and the critical temperatures for phase transitions are estimated using both the random phase approximation (RPA) and the parquet approximation (PA). Within RPA, only Stoner and intervalley coherent (IVC) phases are supported, while the PA reveals a richer phase structure including particle-particle (PP) channel instabilities. We establish a general scaling law for the critical temperature with respect to layer number $N$, highlighting an upper bound as $N \rightarrow \infty$, and demonstrate a non-monotonic decrease of the critical temperature with increasing chemical potential. The PA uncovers the role of interaction symmetry: $SU(4)$-symmetric interactions favor intervalley Stoner order in the density channel, whereas $SU(2) \times SU(2)$-symmetric interactions permit a broader set of phases. A crossover in the dominant instability occurs in the particle-hole channel at a critical layer number, suggesting the emergence of magnetic or IVC phases in thicker systems. We also identify conditions under which pair-density wave (PDW) order could form in the PP channel, though its physical realization may be constrained.

Title: Emergent superconducting stripes in two-orbital superconductors
Authors: Qiong Qin, Yi-feng Yang
Abstract: Motivated by recent experiments in KTaO$_3$/EuO interface, we propose an intrinsic mechanism where superconducting stripes emerge naturally without involving disorder, charge inhomogeneity, or competing orders. Our theory is based on a two-orbital model of superconductivity, where one orbital displays a quasi-one-dimensional dispersion and the other orbital is more localized and contributes pairing interactions along the perpendicular direction. Our auxiliary-field Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the pairing amplitude exhibits spatial modulation such that the superconductivity naturally disaggregates into two-leg or three-leg superconducting stripes separated by non-superconducting blocks. Our work provides a promising scenario of emergent superconducting stripes in homogeneous two-dimensional systems and reveals unexpectedly rich physics in two-orbital superconductors for future materials design.

Title: Measurement of the attractive electrosolvation force between colloidal particles
Authors: Sida Wang, Angela Le, Rowan Walker-Gibbons, Madhavi Krishnan
Abstract: Direct measurement of the pair interaction potential between electrically like-charged particles in solution reveals a strong and long-ranged attractive force. This counterintuitive attraction has been suggested to arise from the orientation of solvent molecules at the interface between the object and the electrolyte. Here we report measurements of pair interaction potentials between charged microspheres with a range of surface chemistries. We demonstrate that the range of the electrosolvation attraction is substantially longer than previously held and that the range of the interaction depends on particle properties. The observations highlight significant departures from current thinking and the need for a model of interparticle interactions that accounts for the molecular nature of the solvent, its interfacial behaviour, and spatial correlations.

Title: Elastic Metastability: Thermally Activated Snap-through Transitions in Nanostructures
Authors: Renjie Zhao, Yiquan Zhang, Chenglin Luo
Abstract: The morphological snap-through transition of a bistable elastic structure typically requires external loading, unless it is miniaturized to the nanoscale, where thermal fluctuations play a significant role. We propose that metastability can emerge in microscopic elastic systems when coupled to a thermal environment, giving rise to thermally activated transitions between metastable configurations. Using atomistic simulations combined with rare event methods, we demonstrate that snap-through events can occur as well-defined thermally activated transitions in a geometrically constrained graphene nanoribbon. Well-tempered metadynamics is employed to determine the transition energetics and pathways. Notably, the temperature dependence of the transition rate constant is accurately described by generalized transition state theory in terms of the Landau free energy. This study introduces a theoretical framework for understanding elastic metastability, extends reaction rate theory to nanomechanical systems, and suggests strategies for designing temperature-responsive nanodevices.

Title: Robust field re-entrant superconductivity in ferromagnetic infinite-layer rare-earth nickelates
Authors: Mingwei Yang, Jiayin Tang, Xianfeng Wu, Heng Wang, Wenjing Xu, Haoliang Huang, Zhicheng Pei, Wenjie Meng, Guangli Kuang, Jinfeng Xu, Sixia Hu, Chuanying Xi, Li Pi, Qingyou Lu, Ziqiang Wang, Qikun Xue, Zhuoyu Chen, Danfeng Li
Abstract: Superconductivity and ferromagnetism are naturally competing, while their interplay can give rise to exotic quantum phases, such as triplet pairing, exemplified by heavy-fermion compounds like UTe$_2$, where magnetic fluctuations stabilise multiple superconducting states. However, such phenomena have remained elusive in high-temperature superconductors. Here we report the discovery of robust field-induced re-entrant superconductivity in heavily Eu-doped infinite-layer nickelate Sm$_{0.95-x}$Ca$_{0.05}$Eu$_x$NiO$_2$. In the heavily over-doped regime, we observe a remarkable superconducting state that emerges under high magnetic fields ($>$ 6 Tesla) after the initial suppression of zero-field superconductivity. Both zero-resistance transport and Meissner diamagnetic effect confirm the superconducting nature of this high-field phase, which persists up to at least 45 Tesla. This re-entrant behaviour is featured by the coexistence of ferromagnetism and superconductivity on distinct sublattices -- magnetic Eu$^{2+}$ ions and the Ni-O planes, respectively. Such an exotic state may arise from the compensation between external and internal exchange fields (Jaccarino-Peter effect) combined with magnetic fluctuation-enhanced pairing near quantum criticality. Our findings establish infinite-layer nickelates as a unique platform for high-temperature ferromagnetic superconductivity, opening new avenues for discovering and manipulating unconventional quantum phases in strongly correlated materials.

Title: Size-structured populations with growth fluctuations: Feynman--Kac formula and decoupling
Authors: Ethan Levien, Yair Heïn, Farshid Jafarpour
Abstract: We study a size--structured population model of proliferating cells in which biomass accumulation and binary division occur at rates modulated by fluctuating internal phenotypes. We quantify how fluctuations in internal variables that influence both growth and division shape the distribution of population phenotypes. We derive conditions under which the distributions of size and internal state decouple. Under this decoupling, population--level expectations are obtained from lineage-level expectations by an exponential tilting given by the Feynman--Kac formula. We further characterize weaker (ensemble-specific) versions of decoupling that hold in the lineage or the population ensemble but not both. Finally, we provide a more general interpretation of the tilted expectations in terms of the mass-weighted phenotype distribution.

Title: Emergent Self-propulsion of Skyrmionic Matter in Synthetic Antiferromagnets
Authors: Clecio C. de Souza Silva, Matheus V. Correia, Juan C. Pina Velasquez
Abstract: Self-propulsion plays a crucial role in biological processes and nanorobotics, enabling small systems to move autonomously in noisy environments. Here, we theoretically demonstrate that a bound skyrmion-skyrmion pair in a synthetic antiferromagnetic bilayer can function as a self-propelled topological object, reaching speeds of up to a hundred million body lengths per second--far exceeding those of any known synthetic or biological self-propelled particles. The propulsion mechanism is triggered by the excitation of back-and-forth relative motion of the skyrmions, which generates nonreciprocal gyrotropic forces, driving the skyrmion pair in a direction perpendicular to their bond. Remarkably, thermal noise induces spontaneous reorientations of the pair and momentary reversals of the propulsion, mimicking behaviors observed in motile bacteria and microalgae.

Title: The heating and cooling of 2D electrons at low temperatures
Authors: A. K. Jain, J. T. Nicholls, S. N. Holmes, G. Jaliel, C. Chen, I. Farrer, D. A. Ritchie
Abstract: We present measurements of the cooling length $\ell_E$ for hot electrons in a GaAs-based high mobility two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG). The thermal measurements are performed on a long 60 $\mu$m-wide channel, which is Joule-heated at one end, along which there are three similar hot-electron thermocouples, spaced 30 $\mu$m apart. The thermocouples measure an exponentially decaying temperature profile with a characteristic length $\ell_E$, which decreases from 23 to 16 $\mu$m as the lattice temperature increases from 1.8 to 5 K. From a simple one-dimensional model of heat diffusion, we measure an inelastic scattering time which decreases from $\tau_i \approx$ 0.36 to 0.18 ns. The measured $\tau_i$ has a magnitude and temperature dependence consistent with acoustic phonon scattering times. We discuss how the sample design can be varied for further thermal investigations. Knowledge of the temperature profile and its gradient will prove useful in measurements of the thermal conductivity and the Nernst effect.

Title: Lattice elasticity of blue phases in cholesteric liquid crystals
Authors: V.A.Chizhikov, A.V.Mamonova, V.E.Dmitrienko
Abstract: New theoretical approaches have been developed for studying and quantitatively describing the elastic properties of cubic blue phases in cholesteric liquid crystals. Within the framework of the Landau-de Gennes theory, using the simplest blue phase with spatial group $O^5$ ($I432$) as an example, calculations of the bulk modulus and two shear moduli were performed depending on the chirality strength and temperature below the crystallization point from isotropic liquid. It is shown that the used approximations of rigid tensors and free helicoids give qualitatively similar results but differ noticeably quantitatively, therefore further experimental studies and numerical modeling of blue phase elasticity are necessary.

Title: Severe plastic deformations, mechanochemistry, and microstructure evolution under high pressure: In Situ Experiments, Four-Scale Theory, New Phenomena, and Rules
Authors: Valery I. Levitas
Abstract: Processes involving severe plastic deformations (SPD) and phase transformations and chemical reactions (PTs/CRs) under high pressures are widespread for obtaining new nanostructured phases and their processing, mechanochemical synthesis, military applications, and nature. SPD strongly reduce the pressure required for PTs/CRs (by one-two orders of magnitude) and PT hysteresis; lead to hidden metastable phases, which cannot be obtained otherwise, and substitute reversible PTs/CRs with irreversible ones. This review is devoted to breakthroughs in understanding multifaceted interactions between high-pressure PTs/CRs, SPD, and microstructure evolution from the viewpoint of advanced mechanics and thermodynamics of materials under stress and plastic strain tensors. A novel concept of plastic strain-induced PTs/CRs under high pressure is explored using four-scale theory and simulations (from atomistic to nano- and scale-free phase-field approaches to macroscale) coupled to in situ experiments in traditional and rotational diamond anvil cells, and their integration. Its development revealed various phenomena and misinterpretations, resolved numerous puzzles, found the first general rules in these fields, and suggested ways for economic defect-induced synthesis of high-pressure phases and nanostructures. Coupled analytical/computational/experimental approaches are developed for complete characterization of occurring processes and finding all heterogeneous scalar and tensorial fields. Applications include high-pressure torsion, surface treatment, high-pressure tribology, PTs/CRs in shear bands leading to severe transformation/reaction-induced plasticity and self-blown-up processes, mechanisms of deep-focus earthquakes, the appearance of microdiamonds in low-pressure-temperature Earth crust, and the mechanochemical origin of life beyond Earth. Unresolved problems and future directions are outlined.

Title: Emergence of non-trivial phases in interacting non-Hermitian quasiperiodic chains with power-law hopping
Authors: Aditi Chakrabarty, Sanchayan Banerjee, Tapan Mishra, Sanjoy Datta
Abstract: In the last few years, several works have identified the concurrence of the spectral, delocalization-localization and topological phase transitions in non-Hermitian quasiperiodic systems in the presence of time-reversal symmetry (TRS), with or without interaction. In this work, we investigate one-dimensional interacting non-Hermitian quasiperiodic lattices with asymmetric power-law hopping and unveil that although the Hamiltonian respects the TRS, the reality of the eigenspectrum does not necessarily indicate a topologically trivial non-Hermitian many-body localization (NHMBL) regime. In fact, we reveal the emergence of a topologically trivial intermediate regime, where the states that are primarily multifractal in nature can also possess a fully real spectrum, thereby restoring the TRS before crossing over to the NHMBL phase. Moreover, in the entire intermediate regime, the interaction completely destroys the multifractal and mobility edges observed in the non-interacting counterpart. Besides, we unveil that due to the long-range nature of the hopping, the entire topologically non-trivial ergodic regime under the periodic boundary condition does not always give rise to boundary localized skin modes under the open boundary condition. Our findings thus advances and deepens the understanding about the emergence of non-trivial phases due to the interplay of interaction and long-range hopping in non-Hermitian quasiperiodic systems.

Title: A practical route to donor binding energies: The DFT-1/2 method for shallow defects
Authors: Joshua Claes, Bart Partoens, Dirk Lamoen, Marcelo Marques, Lara K. Teles
Abstract: Accurately calculating the binding energies of shallow defects requires large supercells to capture the extended nature of their wavefunctions. This makes many beyond-DFT methods, such as hybrid functionals, impractical for direct calculations, often requiring indirect or approximate approaches. However, standard DFT alone fails to provide reliable results due to the well-known band gap underestimation and delocalization errors. In this work, we employ the DFT-1/2 method to address these deficiencies while maintaining computational efficiency allowing us to reach supercells of up to 4096 atoms. We develop a practical procedure for applying DFT-1/2 to shallow defects and demonstrate its effectiveness for group V donors in silicon (P, As, Sb, Bi). By using an extrapolation scheme to infinite supercell size, we obtain accurate binding energies with minimal computational overhead. This approach offers a simple and direct method for calculating donor binding energies.

Title: Intrinsic Linear Response from Zeeman Quantum Geometry in 2D Unconventional Magnets
Authors: Neelanjan Chakraborti, Sudeep Kumar Ghosh, Snehasish Nandy
Abstract: Unconventional magnets with zero net magnetization yet momentum-dependent spin splitting constitute a newly identified class of materials that provide a rich platform for quantum-geometry-driven transport phenomena. Exploiting the interplay between momentum translation and spin rotation, we uncover a distinct linear transport response governed by a generalized quantum geometric tensor, the Zeeman quantum geometric tensor (ZQGT). We show that the ZQGT drives a linear intrinsic gyrotropic magnetic current (IGMC) in the three prototypical two-dimensional unconventional magnets: a time-reversal-broken $d_{x^2 - y^2}$ altermagnet, a time-reversal-symmetric $p$-wave magnet, and a mixed $d$-wave altermagnet. Depending on symmetry, these magnets exhibit longitudinal, transverse, or combined conduction and displacement IGMCs in the presence of spin-orbit coupling. Notably, this response persists even when conventional Berry curvature contributions vanish, offering a unique probe of hidden spin-split band structures of unconventional magnets. In particular, for mixed $d$-wave altermagnets, symmetric Berry curvature and antisymmetric quantum metric respectively generate longitudinal conduction IGMC and transverse displacement IGMC- responses absent in conventional quantum geometry. The predicted signatures, relevant to compounds such as RuO$_2$, CrSb, and MnTe, provide experimentally accessible diagnostics for distinguishing unconventional magnetic phases. These findings position the ZQGT as a powerful framework for probing and controlling transport in next-generation quantum materials.

Title: Near-resonant nuclear spin detection with megahertz mechanical resonators
Authors: Diego A. Visani, Letizia Catalini, Christian L. Degen, Alexander Eichler, Javier del Pino
Abstract: Mechanical resonators operating in the megahertz range have become a versatile platform for fundamental and applied quantum research. Their exceptional properties, such as low mass and high quality factor, make them also appealing for force sensing experiments. In this work, we propose a method for detecting, and ultimately controlling, nuclear spins by coupling them to megahertz resonators via a magnetic field gradient. Dynamical backaction between the sensor and an ensemble of $N$ nuclear spins produces a shift in the sensor's resonance frequency. The mean frequency shift due to the Boltzmann polarization is challenging to measure in nanoscale sample volumes. Here, we show that the fluctuating polarization of the spin ensemble results in a measurable increase of the resonator's frequency variance. On the basis of analytical as well as numerical results, we predict that the variance measurement will allow single nuclear spin detection with existing resonator devices.

Title: Trion polaron problem in bulk and two-dimensional materials
Authors: V. Shahnazaryan, A. Kudlis, K. Varga, I. A. Shelykh, I. V. Tokatly
Abstract: We develop a microscopic theoryof the trion polaron: a bound state of two electrons and one hole, dressed by longitudinal optical (LO) phonons. Starting from the Frohlich Hamiltonian, which describes the interaction of charged particles with LO phonons in three-dimensional (bulk) and two-dimensional (monolayer) polar crystals, we adopt the intermediate coupling variational approximation of Lee, Low, and Pines, and generalize it for the three-body problem. This yields an effective three-particle Hamiltonian with renormalized electron-electron and electron-hole interactions, similar to those obtained for exciton polaron and bipolaron problems. We compute the binding energies for a family of bulk perovskite materials and several atomic monolayer materials characterized by pronounced polar effects, providing quantitative benchmarks for spectroscopic measurements.

Title: Controlling Skyrmion Lattice Orientation with Local Magnetic Field Gradients
Authors: Duc Minh Tran, Edoardo Mangini, Elizabeth M. Jefremovas, Fabian Kammerbauer, Dennis Meier, Robert Frömter, Mathias Kläui
Abstract: Precise control over the formation and arrangement of magnetic skyrmion lattices is essential for understanding their emergent behavior and advancing their integration into spintronic and magnonic devices. We report on a simple and minimally invasive technique to nucleate and manipulate skyrmion lattices in soft magnetic CoFeB using single-pass magnetic force microscopy (MFM). By tuning the scan-line spacing to match the intrinsic stripe domain periodicity, the stray field gradient from the MFM tip induces reversible transitions from stripe domains to isolated skyrmions and locally ordered lattices. The resulting skyrmion positions are extracted to compute the local orientational order parameter $\psi_6$, enabling quantitative evaluation of lattice ordering. A systematic improvement in $\langle |\psi_6| \rangle$ is observed with repeated scanning, indicating a transition from a disordered state to ordered hexagonal lattices. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the lattice orientation can be deterministically rotated by changing the scanning direction, as confirmed by both real-space analysis and fast Fourier transformations. This method enables the controlled creation, reordering, and deletion of metastable skyrmion textures on demand. Our approach establishes a practical and accessible platform for studying two-dimensional phase behavior in topological spin systems, offering direct and reconfigurable control over lattice symmetry, order, and orientation.

Title: Gauge flux generations of weakly magnetized Dirac spin liquid in a kagomé lattice
Authors: Si-Yu Pan, Jiahao Yang, Gang V. Chen
Abstract: Inspired by the recent progress on the Dirac spin liquid and the kagomé lattice antiferromagnets, we revisit the U(1) Dirac spin liquid on the kagomé lattice and consider the response of this quantum state to the weak magnetic field by examining the matter-gauge coupling. Even though the system is in the strong Mott insulating regime, the Zeeman coupling could induce the internal U(1) gauge flux with the assistance of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. In addition to the perturbatively-induced non-uniform flux from the microscopic interactions, the system spontaneously generates the uniform U(1) gauge flux in a non-perturbative fashion to create the spinon Landau levels and thus gains the kinetic energy for the spinon matters. Renormalized mean-field theory is employed to validate these two flux generation mechanisms. The resulting state is argued to be an ordered antiferromagnet with the in-plane magnetic order, and the gapless Goldstone mode behaves like the gapless gauge boson and the spinons appear at higher energies. The dynamic properties of this antiferromagnet, and the implication for other matter-gauge-coupled systems are discussed.

Title: Sideband Spectroscopy in the Strong Driving Regime: Volcano Transparency and Sideband Anomaly
Authors: Luka Antonic, Sergey Hazanov, Sergei Masis, Daniel Podolsky, Eyal Buks
Abstract: We study the response of a spin to two crossed magnetic fields: a strong and fast transverse field, and a weak and slow longitudinal field. We characterize the sideband response at the sum and the difference of driving frequencies over a broad range of parameters. In the strong transverse driving regime, the emission spectrum has a characteristic volcano lineshape with a narrow central transparency region surrounded by asymmetric peaks. Next, we couple the spin to a nonlinear cavity that both drives and measures it. In a sufficiently slow longitudinal field, the emission spectrum exhibits anomalous behavior, where the resonances in both the right and left sidebands lie on the same side of the central resonance. The theoretical results are compared to the experimental measurement of the emission of substitutional nitrogen P1 and nitrogen-vacancy NV$^-$ defects in diamond.

Title: Equipartition and the temperature of maximum density of TIP4/2005 water
Authors: Dilipkumar N. Asthagiri, Thomas L. Beck
Abstract: We simulate TIP4P/2005 water in the temperature range of 257 K to 318 K with time steps of $\delta =$ 0.25, 0.50, and 2.0 fs. Within the computed statistical uncertainties, the density-temperature behavior obtained using 0.25 fs and 0.50 fs are in excellent agreement with each other but differ from those obtained using $\delta t = 2.0$ fs, a choice that leads to a breakdown of equipartition. The temperature of maximum density (TMD) is 277.15 K with $\delta t = $0.25 fs or 0.50 fs, but is shifted to 273.15 K for simulations with $\delta t = 2.0$ fs. This shift is comparable in magnitude to the shift in TMD due to nuclear quantum effects, emphasizing the care required in the parameterization and classical statistical mechanical simulation of a fluid that displays nontrivial nuclear quantum effects under ambient conditions. Enhancing the water-water dispersion interaction, as has been recommended for modeling disordered solvated proteins, degrades the description of the liquid-vapor phase envelope.

Title: Delayed transitions, promoted states and multistability in a pressure-driven nematic under an electric field
Authors: G. McKay, N.J. Mottram
Abstract: We consider the effects of an applied pressure gradient on the classical Freedericksz transition, finding a delayed transition, the promotion of particular director configurations and even pressure-induced multistability. Using the theoretical framework developed by Ericksen and Leslie, we find that the applied pressure gradient adapts the normal pitchfork bifurcation at critical applied voltage, leading to both a delayed bifurcation to higher voltages and a transformation from a supercritical to a subcritical bifurcation so that within a range of voltages there are at least two possible steady states. This range of voltages grows with increasing pressure gradient and eventually includes the zero voltage state so that, for sufficiently strong flow, there are at least two steady states at zero applied voltage. For sufficiently high pressure gradients, we also find that flow-alignment can create a completely new attracting steady state, one that is unstable without flow. We provide a flow-strength-electric field parameter plane that summarises the parameter ranges for which there are multiple steady states and suggest realistic mechanisms to move between these states, as well as an analytical model for the delayed Freedericksz transition effect. The novel steady states found in this work give the possibility of director and flow hysteresis in microfluidic devices.

Title: Core position-dependent gyrotropic and damping contributions to the Thiele equation approach for accurate spin-torque vortex oscillator dynamics
Authors: Colin Ducarme, Simon De Wergifosse, Flavio Abreu Araujo
Abstract: Understanding the nonlinear dynamics of magnetic vortices in spin-torque vortex oscillators (STVOs) is essential for their application in neuromorphic computing. Existing models either rely on the standard Thiele equation approach (TEA), which offer only qualitative predictions, or on micromagnetic simulations (MMS), which are computationally demanding. We present a refined Thiele approach that incorporates the deformation of the vortex profile for the evaluation of the gyrotropic and damping terms. In this manuscript, a more realistic ansatz of the vortex magnetization profile is introduced to extract these effective parameters semi-analytically. A method to extract the gyrotropic and damping terms directly from MMS is also presented. The resulting expressions are benchmarked against state-of-the-art analytical derivations, and reveal a damping anisotropy of the vortex core. This framework captures the essential nonlinearities of STVO dynamics with high fidelity at low computational cost, paving the way for predictive modeling of large-scale neuromorphic circuits based on STVOs.

Title: Electron coherent phonon coupling in Pr$_{0.5}$Ca$_{1.5}$MnO$_4$ measured with ultrafast broadband spectroscopy
Authors: Emmanuel B. Amuah, Khalid M. Siddiqui, Maurizio Monti, Daniel Pérez-Salinas, Hanna Strojecka, Thomas H. Meyland, Allan S. Johnson, Simon E. Wall
Abstract: Photoexcitation of single-layered La$_{0.5}$Mn$_{1.5}$MnO$_4$ has played a key role in understanding orbital ordering and non-thermal states in the manganites. However, while orbital ordering in La$_{0.5}$Sr$_{1.5}$MnO$_4$ breaks the in-plane C$_4$ symmetry, many layered manganites show much more complex phase diagrams in which orbital ordering emerges from an already symmetry-broken high-temperature phase and also exhibit additional low-temperature phases. In this work, we examine the role of these phases in relation to orbital ordering in the single-layered manganite Pr$_{0.5}$Ca$_{1.5}$MnO$_4$ with a combination of optical reflection anisotropy and ultrafast broadband pump-probe spectroscopy. We find that the reflection anisotropy, measured in equilibrium, is strongly sensitive to charge and orbital-ordering transition only. However, the ultrafast response, measuring the non-equilibrium state is sensitive to all phases. In particular, we deduce that coherent phonons modulate unoccupied electronic states that are sensitive to the different phases of the material. This gives rise to a non-linear scaling of the phonon signal with pump fluence at specific probe wavelengths.

Title: Suppression of the valence transition in solution-grown single crystals of Eu$_2$Pt$_6$Al$_{15}$
Authors: Juan Schmidt, Dominic H. Ryan, Oliver Janka, Jutta Kösters, Carsyn L. Mueller, Aashish Sapkota, Rafaela F. S. Penacchio, Tyler J. Slade, Sergey L. Bud'ko, Paul C. Canfield
Abstract: The study of Eu intermetallic compounds has allowed the exploration of valence fluctuations and transitions in 4f electron systems. Recently, a Eu$_2$Pt$_6$Al$_{15}$ phase synthesized by arc-melting followed by a thermal treatment was reported [M. Radzieowski \textit{et al.}, J Am Chem Soc 140(28), 8950-8957 (2018)], which undergoes a transition upon cooling below 45~K that was interpreted as a valence transition from Eu$^{2+}$ to Eu$^{3+}$. In this paper, we present the discovery of another polymorph of Eu$_2$Pt$_6$Al$_{15}$ obtained by high-temperature solution growth, that presents different physical properties than the arc-melted polycrystalline sample. Despite the similarities in crystal structure and chemical composition, the Eu valence transition is almost fully suppressed in the solution-grown crystals, allowing the moments associated with the Eu$^{2+}$ state to order antiferromagnetically at around 14~K. A detailed analysis of the crystal structure using single crystal X-ray diffraction reveals that, although the solution grown crystals are built from the same constituent layers as the arc-melted samples, these layers present a different stacking. The effect of different thermal treatments is also studied. Different anneal procedures did not result in significant changes of the intrinsic properties, and only by arc-melting and quenching the crystals we were able to convert them into the previously reported polymorph.

Title: Physics-Informed ML Exploration of Structure-Transport Relationships in Hard Carbon
Authors: Nikhil Rampal, Stephen E. Weitzner, Fredrick Omenya, Marissa Wood, David M. Reed, Xiaolin Li, Jonathan R. I. Lee, Liwen F. Wan
Abstract: Sodium-ion batteries are a cost-effective and sustainable alternative to lithium-ion systems for large-scale energy storage. Hard carbon (HC) anodes, composed of disordered graphitic and amorphous domains, offer high capacity but exhibit complex, poorly understood ion transport behavior. In particular, the relationship between local microstructure and sodium mobility remains unresolved, hindering rational performance optimization. Here, we introduce a data-driven framework that combines machine-learned interatomic potentials with molecular dynamics simulations to systematically investigate sodium diffusion across a broad range of carbon densities and sodium loadings. By computing per-ion structural descriptors, we identify the microscopic factors that govern ion transport. Unsupervised learning uncovers distinct diffusion modes, including hopping, clustering, and void trapping, while supervised analysis highlights tortuosity and NaNa coordination as primary determinants of mobility. Correlation mapping further connects these transport regimes to processing variables such as bulk density and sodium content. This physics-informed approach establishes quantitative structure-transport relationships that capture the heterogeneity of disordered carbon. Our findings deliver mechanistic insights into sodium-ion dynamics and provide actionable design principles for engineering high-performance HC anodes in next-generation battery systems.

Title: Carrier mobilities and electron-phonon interactions beyond DFT
Authors: Aleksandr Poliukhin, Nicola Colonna, Francesco Libbi, Samuel Poncé, Nicola Marzari
Abstract: Electron-phonon coupling is a key interaction that governs diverse physical processes such as carrier transport, superconductivity, and optical absorption. Calculating such interactions from first-principles with methods beyond density-functional theory remains a challenge. We introduce here a finite-difference framework for computing electron-phonon couplings for any electronic structure method that provides eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and showcase applications for hybrid and Koopmans functionals, and $GW$ many-body perturbation theory. Our approach introduces a novel projectability scheme based on eigenvalue differences and bypasses many of the limitations of the direct finite difference methods. It also leverages symmetries to reduce the number of independent atomic displacements, thereby keeping computational costs manageable. This approach enables seamless integration with established first-principles codes for generating displaced supercells, performing Wannier interpolations, and evaluating transport properties. Applications to silicon and gallium arsenide show that advanced electronic-structure functionals predict different electron-phonon couplings and modify band curvatures, resulting in much more accurate estimates of intrinsic carrier drift mobilities and effective masses. In general, our method provides a robust and accessible framework for exploring electron-phonon interactions in complex materials with state-of-the-art electronic structure methods.

Title: Universal winding properties of chiral active motion
Authors: Ion Santra, Urna Basu, Sanjib Sabhapandit
Abstract: We propose the area swept $A(t)$ and the winding angle $\Omega(t)$ as the key observables to characterize chiral active motion. We find that the distributions of the scaled area and the scaled winding angle are described by universal scaling functions across all well-known models of active particles, parametrized by the chirality $\omega$, along with a self-propulsion speed $v_0$, and the persistence time $\tau$. In particular, we show that, at late times, the average winding angle grows logarithmically with time $\la\Omega \ra\sim(\omega\tau/2)\,\ln t$, while the average area swept has a linear temporal growth $\la A(t)\ra\simeq(\omega\tau D_{\text{eff}})\,t$, where $D_{\text{eff}}=v_0^2 \tau /[2(1+ \omega^2 \tau^2)]$ is the effective diffusion coefficient. Moreover, we find that the distribution of the scaled area $z=[A-\la A\ra]/(2D_{\text{eff}}t)$ is described by the universal scaling function $F_{\text{ch}}(z)=\text{sech}(\pi z)$. From extensive numerical evidence, we conjecture the emergence of a new universal scaling function $G_{\text{ch}}(z)=\mathcal {N}/[e^{\alpha z} + e^{-\beta z}]$ for the distribution of the scaled winding angle $z=\Omega/[\ln t]$, where the parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are model-dependent and $\mathcal{N}$ is the normalization constant. In the absence of chirality, i.e., $\omega=0$, the scaling function becomes $G_{\text{ch}}(z)=(\alpha/\pi)\,\mathrm{sech}(\alpha z)$.

Title: Anyon superfluidity of excitons in quantum Hall bilayers
Authors: Zhaoyu Han, Taige Wang, Zhihuan Dong, Michael P. Zaletel, Ashvin Vishwanath
Abstract: The charged anyons of a fractional quantum Hall fluid are necessarily dispersionless due to the continuous magnetic translation symmetry. Neutral anyons, however, can disperse, resulting in a much richer space of possible ``daughter'' states when doped to finite density. We discuss a natural realization of such physics in quantum Hall bilayers, where a finite density of excitons with fractional statistics is argued to give rise to `anyonic exciton superfluidity,' the charge-neutral analog of anyon superconductivity. In a balanced bilayer of two Laughlin $\nu = 1/3$ states, the minimal interlayer exciton carries anyonic exchange statistics. A finite density of these excitons is argued to yield an exciton superfluid stitched to a specific bulk topological order and edge spectrum. Such superfluidity should be most robust near the direct transition into the Halperin $(112)$ state, and near analogous transitions in the bilayer Jain sequence at total filling $\nu_\text{T} = 2\times \frac{n}{2n+1}$. These topological transitions can be described by Chern-Simons QED$_3$, from which we derive several novel and general properties of anyon superfluidity near such transitions, including an anomalously large superfluid stiffness of $\kappa_\text{s} \propto |\delta\nu|^{1/2}$ at layer imbalance fraction $\delta\nu$. A notable feature of the phase diagrams we construct is the prevalence of spatial symmetry breaking, driven by an underlying composite Fermi surface. Our results can be directly tested with currently available experimental techniques. We compare our theory with existing data and make concrete predictions for future measurements, including higher-pseudospin exciton superfluids when doping higher Jain fractions.

Title: Comparison of derivative-free and gradient-based minimization for multi-objective compositional design of shape memory alloys
Authors: S. Josyula, Y. Noiman, E. J. Payton, T. Giovannelli
Abstract: Designing shape memory alloys (SMAs) that meet performance targets while remaining affordable and sustainable is a complex challenge. In this work, we focus on optimizing SMA compositions to achieve a desired martensitic start temperature (Ms) while minimizing cost. To do this, we use machine learning models as surrogate predictors and apply numerical optimization methods to search for suitable alloy combinations. We trained two types of machine learning models, a tree-based ensemble and a neural network, using a dataset of experimentally characterized alloys and physics-informed features. The tree-based model was used with a derivative-free optimizer (COBYLA), while the neural network, which provides gradient information, was paired with a gradient-based optimizer (TRUST-CONSTR). Our results show that while both models predict Ms with similar accuracy, the optimizer paired with the neural network finds better solutions more consistently. COBYLA often converged to suboptimal results, especially when the starting guess was far from the target. The TRUST-CONSTR method showed more stable behavior and was better at reaching alloy compositions that met both objectives. This study demonstrates a practical approach to exploring new SMA compositions by combining physics-informed data, machine learning models, and optimization algorithms. Although the scale of our dataset is smaller than simulation-based efforts, the use of experimental data improves the reliability of the predictions. The approach can be extended to other materials where design trade-offs must be made with limited data.

Title: Importance of Correlations for Neural Quantum States
Authors: Fabian Döschl, Annabelle Bohrdt
Abstract: Neural quantum states (NQS) have emerged as a powerful variational ansatz for representing quantum many-body wave functions. Their internal mechanisms, however, remain poorly understood. We investigate the role of correlations for NQS-like quantum state representation by employing a correlation-based interpretable neural network architecture and thereafter proving our observations based on Boolean function theory. The correlator neural network demonstrates that, even for simple product states, up to all system-size correlation orders in the chosen computational basis are required to represent a quantum state faithfully. We explain these observations using the Fourier expansion, which reveals the correlator basis as the effective basis of the internal NQS structure, the resulting necessity for high-order correlations, potential linear dependencies in constrained Hilbert spaces, and connections between spin basis-rotations and the correlator basis. Furthermore, we analyze how activation functions, network architectures, and choice of reference basis influence correlation requirements. Our results provide new insights and a better understanding of the internal structure and requirements of NQS, enabling a more systematic use of NQS in future research.

Title: Nonadiabatic force matching for alchemical free-energy estimation
Authors: Jorge L. Rosa-Raíces, David T. Limmer
Abstract: We propose a method to compute free energies from nonadiabatic alchemical transformations using diffusion-denoising generative models. The method, nonadiabatic force matching, hinges on estimating -- rather than minimizing -- the dissipation along an alchemical transition as the functional of a nonadiabatic potential, which plays the role of a diffusion-denoising protocol. Applying the algorithm to compute alchemical free energies of simple atomistic models shows it can significantly cut the simulation cost of a free-energy estimate at no loss of accuracy compared with thermodynamic integration.

Title: Passage times of fast inhomogeneous immigration processes
Authors: Hwai-Ray Tung, Sean D Lawley
Abstract: In many biophysical systems, key events are triggered when the fastest of many random searchers find a target. Most mathematical models of such systems assume that all searchers are initially present in the search domain, which permits the use of classical extreme value theory. In this paper, we explore $k$th passage times of inhomogeneous immigration processes where searchers are added to the domain over time either through time inhomogeneous rates or a Yule (pure birth) process. We rigorously prove convergence in distribution and convergence of moments of the $k$th passage times for both processes as immigration rates grow. In particular, we relate immigration with time inhomogeneous rates to previous work where all searchers are initially present through a coupling argument and demonstrate how immigration through a Yule process can be viewed as a time inhomogeneous immigration process with a random time shift. For Yule immigration, we find that the extreme distributions depart from the classical family of Frechet, Gumbel, and Weibull, and we compare our results to classical theorems on branching Brownian motion. This work offers one of the few examples where extreme value distributions can be obtained exactly for random variables which are neither independent nor identically distributed.

Title: Excitonic Coupling and Photon Antibunching in Venus Yellow Fluorescent Protein Dimers: A Lindblad Master Equation Approach
Authors: Ian T. Abrahams
Abstract: Strong excitonic coupling and photon antibunching have been observed together in Venus yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) dimers -- a cryptic combination under prevailing theoretical models. In 2019, Kim et al. demonstrated Davydov splitting in Venus dimer circular dichroism (CD) spectra, revealing large negative dimer coupling energy, while antibunching was confirmed by antibunching-fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (AB/FCS fingerprinting). To explain this coexistence, Venus dimer population dynamics are modeled here within a Lindblad master equation framework, justified by the separation of characteristic coupling, dephasing, and thermal relaxation rates. Simulations predict rapid decoherence, consistent with antibunching, indicating that coherence in both the excitonic and site bases is too short-lived to affect photon emission statistics. Despite the absence of long-lived coherence, Venus dimers provide a tractable platform for probing evolutionary pressures on fluorescent protein photophysics and quantum dynamics. Cryogenic cooling could extend coherence lifetimes into the regime required for quantum gate operations, suggesting a route toward fluorescent protein-based qubits. More broadly, the results highlight a structural design principle -- a "bioexciton motif" -- that links excitonic coupling, decoherence, and protein architecture, pointing to general rules by which biology both constrains and inspires quantum technologies.

Title: Deterministic time rewinding of waves in time-varying media
Authors: Seulong Kim, Kihong Kim
Abstract: Temporal modulation of material parameters offers unprecedented control over wave dynamics, enabling phenomena beyond the capabilities of static systems. Here we introduce and analyze a robust mechanism for time rewinding, whereby a temporally evolved wave is fully restored to its original state through a carefully engineered sequence of temporal modulations. In electromagnetic systems, time rewinding emerges from impedance-matched or anti-matched hierarchical bilayer structures with matched modulation durations, exploiting total transmission or reflection and reversed phase accumulation. In Dirac systems, it arises via complete interband transition driven by time-dependent vector potentials. Unlike time-reversal holography or quantum time mirrors, which produce wave echoes but only partial waveform recovery, our approach achieves deterministic and complete reconstruction of the entire wave state, including both amplitude and phase. Analytical conditions for robust amplitude and phase restoration are derived and validated through simulations of discrete and continuous modulations, demonstrating resilience to modulation complexity and temporal asymmetry. These findings establish a versatile platform for secure information retrieval, temporal cloaking, programmable metamaterials, and wave-based logic devices.

Title: New Upper Bounds on Exotic Neutron Spin-Electron Spin Interactions via Neutron Spin Rotation Measurements in a Compensated Ferrimagnet
Authors: T. Mulkey, K. N. Lopez, C. D. Hughes, B. Hill, M. Van Meter, H. Wijeratne, J. C. Long, M. Sarsour, W. M. Snow, K. Li, R. Parajuli, S. Samiei, D. V. Baxter, M. Luxnat, Y. Zhang, C. Jiang, E. Stringfellow, J. Torres, R. Hobbs
Abstract: We report a search for exotic spin-spin interactions between neutrons and electrons which could signal new physics beyond the Standard Model using slow neutron polarimetric imaging through a dense medium of polarized electrons. Our dense polarized electron target is a ferrimagnet held at its magnetic compensation temperature, which realizes a polarized electron ensemble with zero net magnetization. We sought the spin rotation of transversely polarized neutrons from a neutron spin-electron spin interaction of the form $V_2=-g_A^eg_A^n\frac{\hbar c}{4\pi}\vec\sigma_e\cdot\vec\sigma_n\frac{e^{-r/\lambda_c}}{r}$, where $g_{A}^{e}$ and $g_{A}^{n}$ are the electron and neutron axial couplings, $\vec{\sigma_e}$ and $\vec{\sigma_n}$ are the electron and neutron spin, and $\lambda_c$ is the interaction range for an exotic axial vector interaction from massive spin-1 boson exchange of mass $\hbar c/\lambda_c$. The resulting average neutron spin rotation angle per unit length, $\frac{d\bar{\phi}_{F5}}{dz}=[0.41\pm6.30\ (stat.)\pm4.4\ (sys.)]\times10^{-3}$ rad/m, is consistent with zero. Our novel approach improves the previous upper limits on the coupling constant product $g_A^eg_A^n$ by several orders of magnitude in the poorly explored $10^{-8}\leq\lambda_c\leq10^{-2}$ range.

Title: The Chapman-Enskog approximation for a relativistic charged gas in the trace-fixed particle frame
Authors: Carlos Gabarrete, Ana Laura García-Perciante, Olivier Sarbach
Abstract: In this article we provide a thorough discussion of the first-order Chapman-Enskog approximation for a relativistic simple charged gas propagating in an arbitrary fixed background spacetime and electromagnetic field. Motivated by a rigorous study of the linearized collision operator, we argue that the most natural thermodynamic frame to describe dissipative relativistic fluids is the trace-fixed particle frame. This frame determines the state variables by requiring compatibility of the first few moments of the one-particle distribution function with those of the Jüttner distribution. The resulting constitutive relations are derived, and it is shown that the corresponding transport coefficients are, in fact, frame-independent if suitably defined. Moreover, we discuss the representation freedom for these relations within the microscopic approach. As shown in previous work, when this freedom is suitably exploited, the resulting fluid theory gives rise to strongly hyperbolic and causal evolution equations for which global equilibria are stable.

Title: Quasiprobability Thermodynamic Uncertainty Relation
Authors: Kohei Yoshimura, Ryusuke Hamazaki
Abstract: We derive a quantum extension of the thermodynamic uncertainty relation where dynamical fluctuations are quantified by the Terletsky-Margenau-Hill quasiprobability, a quantum generalization of the classical joint probability. The obtained inequality plays a complementary role to existing quantum thermodynamic uncertainty relations, focusing on observables' change rather than exchange of charges through jumps and respecting initial coherence. Quasiprobabilities show anomalous behaviors that are forbidden in classical systems, such as negativity; we reveal that such behaviors are necessary to reduce dissipation beyond classical limitations and show that they are stronger requirements than that the state has quantum coherence. To illustrate these statements, we employ a model that can exhibit a dissipationless heat current, which would be prohibited in classical systems; we construct a state that has much coherence but does not lead to a dissipationless current due to the absence of anomalous behaviors in quasiprobabilities.

Title: Stoquasticity is not enough: towards a sharper diagnostic for Quantum Monte Carlo simulability
Authors: Arman Babakhani, Armen Karakashian
Abstract: Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods are powerful tools for simulating quantum many-body systems, yet their applicability is limited by the infamous sign problem. We approach this challenge through the lens of Vanishing Geometric Phases (VGP) \cite{Hen_2021}, introducing it as a `geometric' criterion for diagnosing QMC simulability. We characterize the class of VGP Hamiltonians, and analyze the complexity of recognizing this class, identifying both hard and efficiently identifiable cases. We further highlight the practical advantage of the VGP criterion by exhibiting specific Hamiltonians that are readily identified as sign-problem-free through VGP, yet whose stoquasticity is difficult to ascertain. These examples underscore the efficiency and sharpness of VGP as a diagnostic tool compared to stoquasticity-based heuristics. Beyond classification, we propose a family of VGP-inspired diagnostics that serve as quantitative indicators of sign problem severity. While exact evaluation of these quantities is generically intractable, we demonstrate their mathematical power in performing scaling analysis for the average sign under unitary transformations. Our results provide both a conceptual foundation and practical tools for understanding and mitigating the sign problem.

Title: Numerically "exact" charge transport dynamics in a dissipative electron-phonon model rationalizing the success of the transient localization scenario
Authors: Veljko Janković
Abstract: Optical conductivity in molecular semiconductors is suppressed in the terahertz region, featuring the displaced Drude peak that reflects carriers' transient localization (TL) by slow intermolecular vibrations. Meanwhile, recent computations in minimal models evidence optical-conductivity enhancements below the characteristic vibrational frequency, which cannot be captured by the TL phenomenology. These models assume undamped vibrations, whereas atomistic simulations show that the vibrations most strongly modulating carrier's hopping amplitude are damped. Here, we use the dissipaton equations of motion (DEOM) method to compute finite-temperature real-time current autocorrelation function in a one-dimensional model with Brownian-oscillator spectral density of nonlocal carrier-phonon interaction. We exploit the dissipaton algebra to handle the phonon-assisted current, reduce the method's computational requirements by working in momentum space, and confirm that numerically stable transport dynamics are virtually independent of a specific DEOM closing scheme. With increasing damping, we find that DEOM optical-conductivity profiles become increasingly qualitatively similar to TL predictions. For parameters representative of room-temperature hole transport in single-crystal rubrene, we conclude that the TL phenomenology is established already in the underdamped-oscillator regime. Reasonable variations in the damping constant weakly affect the carrier mobility, which remains within experimental bounds. Overall, our results strongly suggest that optical-conductivity enhancements at very low frequencies are artifacts of undamped vibrations, and rationalize the success of the TL phenomenology in describing experimental data.

Title: Non-Hermitian funneling in anisotropic media
Authors: Yuan Tian, Nankun Gao, Xiujuan Zhang, Ming-Hui Lu, Yan-Feng Chen
Abstract: Non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) has emerged as a distinctive phenomenon enabling non-Bloch wave manipulation. However, it has been limited to discrete lattices requiring fine-tuned onsite gain/loss or asymmetric couplings. Here, moving beyond these discrete models, we realize novel NHSE in uniform media by leveraging anisotropy of non-Hermitian density tensors. Experiments based on an acoustic anisotropic metamaterial demonstrate that enabled by the NHSE, wave energy can be directed toward and collected at specific boundaries, exhibiting broadband and wide-angle characteristics. This intriguing phenomenon is termed non-Hermitian wave funneling, which, remarkably, occurs under uniform non-Hermitian modulations, free of fine-tuning. Furthermore, we identify a second-order NHSE, enabling wave funneling toward corners. Our work establishes a paradigm for exploring NHSE in uniform media, advancing the fundamental understanding of non-Hermitian physics and providing novel mechanisms for non-Bloch wave control in metamaterials or even natural materials without delicate tuning.

Title: Production of ultracold asymmetric tops from Sr atoms and SrOH molecules
Authors: Maciej B. Kosicki, Mateusz Borkowski, Marcin Umiński, Piotr S. Żuchowski
Abstract: We report the comprehensive theoretical investigation of the Sr-SrOH system identifying it as a promising route to production of ultracold asymmetric top molecules. Combining high-level ab initio electronic structure calculations with rigorous quantum scattering simulations, we determine strongly anisotropic, non-reactive interaction potential and an exceptionally dense spectrum of near-threshold resonances. Presented excited states, transition dipole moments, and results of the one-dimensional STIRAP model suggest the possibility of coherently transferring weakly bound complexes to the rovibrational ground state.

Title: From Chiral Topological Dynamics to Chiral Topological Amplification: Real vs Imaginary Parameters in a Hermitian Bosonic Chain
Authors: Kiran Babasaheb Estake, T. R. Vishnu, Dibyendu Roy
Abstract: We propose a Hermitian quadratic bosonic model (QBH) whose dynamical matrix exhibits distinct topological and dynamical phenomena depending on whether the hopping and pairing amplitudes are real or purely imaginary. In the real-parameter regime, the dynamical matrix is unitarily equivalent to four decoupled copies of the sublattice-symmetric non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (nSSH2) model, thereby inheriting its topological phases and energy spectrum-including the Möbius phase, a gapless topological phase with fractional winding number, having no Hermitian counterpart. We show that the dynamics generated by the QBH Hamiltonian naturally reproduce non-Hermitian time evolution, without invoking nonlinear Schrödinger dynamics or ad hoc normalization. It is demonstrated by analytically calculating the Loschmidt amplitude and computing the dynamical topological order parameter under periodic boundary conditions, which displays a distinct chiral response in the Möbius phase. In contrast, when the hopping and pairing terms are taken to be purely imaginary, the dynamical matrix becomes unitarily equivalent to a different version of the sublattice-symmetric non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (nSSH1) model that supports only two topological phases: trivial and non-trivial, and the Möbius phase disappears. The latter system exhibits sublattice-dependent chiral amplification under open boundary conditions. We show that this amplification arises from the non-trivial topology of the dynamical matrix, establishing a clear link between topological phase and amplification behavior in the imaginary-parameter regime.

Title: A Simple and Scalable Kernel Density Approach for Reliable Uncertainty Quantification in Atomistic Machine Learning
Authors: Daniel Willimetz, Lukáš Grajciar
Abstract: Machine learning models are increasingly used to predict material properties and accelerate atomistic simulations, but the reliability of their predictions depends on the representativeness of the training data. We present a scalable, GPU-accelerated uncertainty quantification framework based on $k$-nearest-neighbor kernel density estimation (KDE) in a PCA-reduced descriptor space. This method efficiently detects sparsely sampled regions in large, high-dimensional datasets and provides a transferable, model-agnostic uncertainty metric without requiring retraining costly model ensembles. The framework is validated across diverse case studies varying in: i) chemistry, ii) prediction models (including foundational neural network), iii) descriptors used for KDE estimation, and iv) properties whose uncertainty is sought. In all cases, the KDE-based score reliably flags extrapolative configurations, correlates well with conventional ensemble-based uncertainties, and highlights regions of reduced prediction trustworthiness. The approach offers a practical route for improving the interpretability, robustness, and deployment readiness of ML models in materials science.

Authors: Gabriel Caceres-Aravena, Dieter Bauer
Abstract: We investigate High-Harmonic Generation (HHG) in the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain with electron-phonon coupling modeled via the Holstein interaction. The system dynamics are simulated using the tight-binding approximation, with local phonons approximated as quantum harmonic oscillators. Phononic degrees of freedom significantly expand the Hilbert space dimension. This interaction modifies the eigenenergy spectrum by introducing new states within previously existing gaps, enhancing the harmonic yield through additional allowed transitions.

Title: High-fidelity realisation of CNOT gate in Majorana-based optical platform
Authors: Jia-Kun Li, Kai Sun, Ze-Yan Hao, Jia-He Liang, Jiannis K. Pachos, Lucy Byles, Jin-Shi Xu, Yong-Jian Han, Chuan-Feng Li, Guang-Can Guo
Abstract: We present the experimental realisation of a robust CNOT quantum gate using Majorana zero modes simulated on a photonic platform. Three Kitaev chains supporting Majorana zero modes at their endpoints are used to encode two logical qubits, and both intra-chain and inter-chain braiding operations are performed to implement the CNOT gate. While the topological encoding of quantum information in Majorana fermions does not offer full topological protection in our non-interacting photonic setting, it nevertheless exhibits a natural resilience to the dominant noise and decoherence effects present in the experiment. Consequently, the fidelity of the CNOT gate is significantly enhanced, surpassing 0.992 and addressing a key limitation in the path toward scalable quantum computation. These results represent a major advancement in topological quantum computing with Majorana fermions and underscore the potential of photonic platforms for realising high-fidelity quantum gates.

Title: Fundamental measure theory for predicting many-body correlation functions
Authors: Ilian Pihlajamaa, Teunike A. van de Pol, Liesbeth M. C. Janssen
Abstract: We study many-body correlation functions within various Fundamental Measure Theory (FMT) formulations and compare their predictions to Monte Carlo simulations of hard-sphere fluids. FMT accurately captures key features of three- and four-body structure, particularly at low and intermediate wavevectors. We show that the dominant contributions to the four-point structure factor arise from direct triplet correlations, allowing evaluation of four-point correlations to be greatly simplified. In glass-forming liquids at high volume fractions, FMT correctly reproduces deviations from the convolution approximation, highlighting FMT's ability to capture growing structural multipoint correlations upon supercooling.

Title: Power-Law Interactions Stabilize Time Crystals Realizing Quantum Energy Storage and Sensing
Authors: Ayan Sahoo, Debraj Rakshit
Abstract: We study discrete time-crystalline (DTC) phases in one-dimensional spin-1/2 chains with power-law interactions under periodic Floquet driving. By generalizing Stark localization to power-law interaction profiles, we identify robust period-doubled dynamics across a wide range of interaction exponents, stabilized by the interplay between coherent driving and spatially varying coupling. Within the DTC phase, the energy stored in the system, interpreted as a quantum battery, increases superlinearly with system size, although no scaling advantage persists in normalized power. Beyond energy storage, we demonstrate that the DTC phase supports enhanced quantum sensing. The quantum Fisher information associated with estimating timing deviations in the drive scales superextensively with system size, surpassing the Heisenberg limit. The degree of quantum advantage can be tuned by varying the interaction exponent, though DTC behavior remains robust throughout. Our results position power-law interacting Floquet systems as robust platforms for storing quantum energy and achieving metrological enhancement.

Title: High to low temperature: $O(N)$ model at large $N$
Authors: Justin R. David, Srijan Kumar
Abstract: We study the $O(N)$ vector model for scalars with quartic interaction at large $N$ on $S^1\times S^2$ without the singlet constraint. The non-trivial fixed point of the model is described by a thermal mass satisfying the gap equation at large $N$. We obtain the partition function and the energy density for the model as a series at low temperature in units of the radius of the sphere. We show these results agree with the Borel-Padé extrapolations of the high temperature expansions of the partition function and energy density obtained in our previous work. This agreement validates both the expansions and demonstrates that low temperature expansions obtained here correspond to the same fixed point studied earlier at high temperature. We obtain the ratio of the partition function of the theory at the non-trivial fixed point to that of the Gaussian theory at all values of temperature. This ratio begins at $4/5$ when the temperature is infinity, decreases to a minimum value of $0.760937$, then increases and approaches unity as the temperature is decreased.

Title: Compromise-Free Scaling of Qubit Speed and Coherence

Abstract: Across leading qubit platforms, a common trade-off persists: increasing coherence comes at the cost of operational speed, reflecting the notion that protecting a qubit from its noisy surroundings also limits control over it. This speed-coherence dilemma limits qubit performance across various technologies. Here, we demonstrate a hole spin qubit in a Ge/Si core/shell nanowire that triples its Rabi frequency while simultaneously quadrupling its Hahn-echo coherence time, boosting the Q-factor by over an order of magnitude. This is enabled by the direct Rashba spin-orbit interaction, emerging from heavy-hole-light-hole mixing through strong confinement in two dimensions. Tuning a gate voltage causes this interaction to peak, providing maximum drive speed and a point where the qubit is optimally protected from charge noise, allowing speed and coherence to scale together. Our proof-of-concept shows that careful dot design can overcome a long-standing limitation, offering a new approach towards building high-performance, fault-tolerant qubits.

Title: Generalised BBGKY hierarchy for near-integrable dynamics
Authors: Leonardo Biagetti, Maciej Lebek, Milosz Panfil, Jacopo De Nardis
Abstract: We consider quantum and classical many-body Hamiltonian systems that combine integrable contact interactions with generic two-body long-range potentials. We show that the time evolution of local observables can be formulated as a generalized Bogoliubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon (gBBGKY) hierarchy, built on the quasiparticle densities of the underlying integrable model and their correlations. Starting from an ansatz for the state at time t, which we denote the correlated fluid cell ensemble, we derive this hierarchy and demonstrate that it exactly reproduces the dynamics of one- and multi-point correlation functions in perturbed integrable models at all times. These predictions are validated against microscopic molecular-dynamics simulations with perfect agreement. In the late-time regime, approach to the Gibbs ensemble is mediated by a Boltzmann-style scattering integral featuring a complex interplay of contact integrable and long-range collision processes. In the specific case of dipolar gases-where the relevant matrix elements are known-we verify that our collision integral exactly recovers the Fermi's golden rule result and provide a full theoretical characterization of the experimental observations of [Tang et al. Phys. Rev. X 8, 021030 2018]. Our framework thus demonstrates how the BBGKY approach can be systematically extended to include strong local interactions, making it applicable to a broad class of experimentally relevant systems, from one-dimensional dipolar cold-atom gases to Lennard -Jones interacting molecules.

Title: Bridging classical and quantum interpretation of chemical state analysis by XPS/HAXPES to resolve short-range order in amorphous alumina films
Authors: Simon Gramatte, Xing Wang, Michael Alejandro Hernández Bertrán, Claudia Cancellieri, Giovanni Pizzi, Deborah Prezzi, Iurii Timrov, Olivier Politano, Ivo Utke, Lars P.H. Jeurgens, Vladyslav Turlo
Abstract: Probing the local structure and chemistry of wide-bandgap amorphous oxide thin films remains challenging due to the limitations of lab-based spectroscopy. This work integrates X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), hard X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (HAXPES), molecular dynamics simulations using machine-learning interatomic potentials, density-functional theory (DFT) calculations, and classical electrostatic modeling of final-state core-ionization effects in Al atoms to uncover the structure and chemistry of amorphous alumina polymorphs made with atomic layer deposition (ALD). DFT calculations using the Delta Kohn-Sham method supported the interpretation of final-state effects and validated electrostatic model assumptions. Shifts in the measured Auger parameter were interpreted as extra-atomic relaxation energies, revealing sensitivity to the local coordination environment. Structural disorder and thermal fluctuations were found to govern the distribution of extra-atomic relaxation energies, suggesting that cryo-XPS can isolate and reveal intrinsic structural building blocks of amorphous oxides. Simulated heating and annealing demonstrated that Auger parameter shifts can serve as indicators of phase decomposition in H-supersaturated ALD amorphous alumina. These findings provide a pathway for comprehensive interpretation and predictive modeling of XPS spectra in amorphous wide-bandgap oxides.

Title: Transient selection of competing order in frustrated spin Peierls systems after a quench
Authors: Jing Zhou, Yuan Wan
Abstract: We study theoretically the dynamics of frustrated spin Peierls systems after a quench from the paramagnetic state to the magnetically ordered state. By constructing and numerical simulating a minimal model, we show that it can exhibit a transient non-collinear magnetic order before settling in the equilibrium collinear magnetic order. The transient magnetic order is selected by the phonon fluctuations originated from the initial state. Our results reveal a mechanism for controlling the phases of matter by exploiting incoherent, nonequilibrium fluctuations.

Title: Electronic structure prediction of medium and high entropy alloys across composition space
Authors: Shashank Pathrudkar, Stephanie Taylor, Abhishek Keripale, Abhijeet Sadashiv Gangan, Ponkrshnan Thiagarajan, Shivang Agarwal, Jaime Marian, Susanta Ghosh, Amartya S. Banerjee
Abstract: We propose machine learning (ML) models to predict the electron density -- the fundamental unknown of a material's ground state -- across the composition space of concentrated alloys. From this, other physical properties can be inferred, enabling accelerated exploration. A significant challenge is that the number of sampled compositions and descriptors required to accurately predict fields like the electron density increases rapidly with species. To address this, we employ Bayesian Active Learning (AL), which minimizes training data requirements by leveraging uncertainty quantification capabilities of Bayesian Neural Networks. Compared to strategic tessellation of the composition space, Bayesian-AL reduces the number of training data points by a factor of 2.5 for ternary (SiGeSn) and 1.7 for quaternary (CrFeCoNi) systems. We also introduce easy-to-optimize, body-attached-frame descriptors, which respect physical symmetries and maintain approximately the same descriptor-vector size as alloy elements increase. Our ML models demonstrate high accuracy and generalizability in predicting both electron density and energy across composition space.

Title: Flux-Driven Circular Current in a Non-Hermitian Dimerized Aharonov-Bohm Ring: Impact of Physical Gain and Loss
Authors: Souvik Roy, Santanu K. Maiti
Abstract: In the present theoretical work, we numerically explore magnetic response of a tight-binding dimerized ring subjected to Aharonov-Bohm (AB) flux and environmental interactions. Specifically, we introduce an imaginary site potential on the odd lattice sites to represent physical gain and loss, while the even lattice sites remain unperturbed. We investigate the induced current resulting from the AB flux in both real and imaginary eigenspaces, aiming to enhance this current significantly by adjusting the gain/loss parameter ($d$). Our analysis focuses on how exceptional points in the real and imaginary eigenenergy spaces contribute to notable increases in current at specific $d$ values, and the emergence of purely real current when the imaginary current vanishes. We discuss how the dual behavior of energy spectrum (real and imaginary), converging to and diverging from zero energy, affects the enhancement of the current. Additionally, we study the interplay between the correlations of dimerized hopping integrals and the gain-loss parameter, which affects the current and highlights key features associated with these physical parameters. Furthermore, we consider how system size impacts our findings. Our study may reveal unconventional characteristics in various loop configurations, potentially paving the way for new research directions.

Title: Soliton resuscitations: asymmetric revivals of the breathing mode of an atomic bright soliton in a harmonic trap
Authors: Waranon Sroyngoen, James R. Anglin
Abstract: An atomic bright soliton realised in a quasi-one-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate can be considered as an open quantum system. The soliton's breathing mode, for example, is damped by emission of atoms from the soliton to spatial infinity, which thus acts as a Markovian environment for the soliton. If the soliton is held in a shallow harmonic trap, however, the environment becomes non-Markovian: emitted atoms oscillate in the trap and eventually return to the soliton, interfering with it, producing periodic revivals of the breathing mode (``resuscitations''). The amplitude envelopes of these breathing revivals shows a curious asymmetry, with a gradual increase in breathing amplitude followed by sudden drop in amplitude that becomes more and more pronounced in later revivals. We explain this asymmetrical revival pattern in the non-Markovian revivals by deriving a close analytical approximation to the Bogoliubov-de Gennes frequency spectrum for the weakly trapped soliton.

Title: Photoluminescence efficiency of MBE-grown MoSe$_2$ monolayers featuring sharp excitonic lines and diverse grain structures
Authors: Mateusz Raczyński, Julia Kucharek, Kacper Oreszczuk, Aleksander Rodek, Tomasz Kazimierczuk, Rafał Bożek, Takashi Taniguchi, Kenji Watanabe, Wojciech Pacuski, Piotr Kossacki
Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that using h-BN as a substrate for the growth of transition metal dichalcogenides can significantly reduce excitonic linewidths. However, many other optical parameters still require optimization. In this work, we present a detailed study of the low-temperature photoluminescence efficiency of MBE-grown MoSe$_2$ monolayers on h-BN substrates, comparing them to state-of-the-art exfoliated monolayers encapsulated in h-BN. We demonstrate that a quantitative comparison between samples requires accounting for interference effects and Purcell enhancement or suppression of the emission. By accounting for these effects in both photoluminescence and Raman signals, we show that the overall intrinsic luminescence efficiency is proportional to the sample coverage. Consequently, we find that exciton diffusion and edge effects are negligible in spectroscopy of MBE-grown samples, even for nanometer-sized crystals.

Title: An Analysis of First- and Quasi-Second-Order Optimization Algorithms in Variational Monte Carlo
Authors: Ruojing Peng, Garnet Kin-Lic Chan
Abstract: Many quantum many-body wavefunctions, such as Jastrow-Slater, tensor network, and neural quantum states, are studied with the variational Monte Carlo technique, where stochastic optimization is usually performed to obtain a faithful approximation to the ground-state of a given Hamiltonian. While first-order gradient descent methods are commonly used for such optimizations, quasi-second-order optimization formulations offer the potential of faster convergence under certain theoretical conditions, but with a similar cost per sample to first-order methods. However, the relative performance of first-order and second-order optimizers is influenced in practice by many factors, including the sampling requirements for a faithful optimization step, the influence of wavefunction quality, as well as the wavefunction parametrization and expressivity. Here we analyze these performance characteristics of first-order and quasi-second-order optimization methods for a variety of Hamiltonians, with the additional context of understanding the scaling of these methods (for good performance) as a function of system size. Our findings help clarify the role of first-order and quasi-second-order methods in variational Monte Carlo calculations and the conditions under which they should respectively be used. In particular, we find that unlike in deterministic optimization, where closeness to the variational minimum determines the suitability of second-order methods, in stochastic optimization the main factor is the overall expressivity of the wavefunction: quasi-second-order methods lead to an overall reduction in cost relative to first-order methods when the wavefunction is sufficiently expressive to represent the ground-state, even when starting far away from the ground state. This makes quasi-second-order methods an important technique when used with wavefunctions with arbitrarily improvable accuracy.

Title: Lateral Exchange Bias for Néel-Vector Control in Atomically Thin Antiferromagnets

Abstract: Atomically thin van der Waals (vdW) magnets have emerged as a fascinating platform for the exploration of novel physical phenomena arising from their reduced dimensionality and exceptional material properties. Their single-crystalline nature and ultimate miniaturization position them as leading candidates for next-generation spintronic applications. Antiferromagnetic (AF) vdW magnets are of particular interest, as they combine the advantages of vdW magnets with the functionality of AF spintronics, offering unique opportunities for ultrafast and robust spintronic devices. However, the lack of approaches to locally and deterministically manipulate their order parameter -- the Néel-vector -- remains a key limitation. Here, we introduce a fundamentally new paradigm in nanomagnetism, which we term lateral exchange bias (LEB), to achieve Néel vector control in bilayers of the vdW AF CrSBr. We exploit the single-crystalline registry formed by terraced CrSBr samples, where the bilayer Néel vector is controlled by LEB from neighboring, odd-layered flakes, whose nonzero magnetization we manipulate using magnetic fields. Using this control, we achieve nonvolatile manipulation of magnetic domains and domain walls (DWs) in AF CrSBr bilayers, establishing a powerful toolkit for controlling atomically thin AFs at the nanoscale. Our results challenge conventional views on exchange bias and provide a previously unexplored mechanism for achieving atomic-scale control of AFic order. Our findings pave the way for the development of advanced spintronic architectures and quantum technologies based on vdW magnets.

Title: Applied-field magnetic structure and spectroscopy shifts of the effective spin-$\frac{1}{2}$, $XY$-like magnet Li$_2$CoCl$_4$
Authors: Zachary W. Riedel, Mykhaylo Ozerov, Stuart Calder, Daniel P. Shoemaker
Abstract: Insulators containing chains of magnetic transition metal cations provide platforms for probing spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ dynamics and quantum critical behavior. Li$_2$CoCl$_4$ contains edge-sharing CoCl$_6$ octahedra that form chains along the crystallographic $c$ axis and orders antiferromagnetically at zero field, but questions remain about its applied-field magnetic structure and the Co$^{2+}$ spin state. Here, we show with neutron diffraction on a polycrystalline sample how the anti-aligned chains of cobalt moments begin to transition to a ferromagnetic state above 1.6 T. Further, using magnetic resonance absorption measurements and noninteracting spin models, we reveal the strongly anisotropic nature of the Co$^{2+}$ ion's $XY$-like magnetic behavior ($g_{\parallel}=2.77$ and $g_{\perp}=5.23$) and its $J=\frac{1}{2}$ ground state. We, therefore, supply the magnetic structures and anisotropic description needed to explore the dynamics of the field-driven magnetic phases, laying the foundation for further experimental and theoretical studies.

Title: Enhanced Superconductivity and Mixed-dimensional Behaviour in Infinite-layer Samarium Nickelate Thin Films

Abstract: Rare-earth infinite-layer nickelates represent an emerging class of unconventional superconductors, with materials synthesis largely limited to early lanthanide compounds. Here, we report the synthesis and characterization of phase-pure superconducting samarium-based infinite-layer nickelate thin films, including the first demonstration of Sm$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$NiO$_2$, along with co-doped variants incorporating europium and calcium. These films, grown on LSAT (001) substrates, exhibit coherent lattice structures up to $\sim$ 9 nm thickness with minimal stacking faults. The co-doped compounds achieve a record-small $c$-axis parameter of 3.26 Å and display remarkable superconducting transition temperatures up to 32.5 K. These results establish a clear correlation between decreasing $c$-axis parameter and increasing critical temperature across different rare-earth systems. In addition, angle-dependent magnetoresistance investigations reveal the existence of a hybrid mixture of 2D and 3D superconductivity in this novel system with enhanced coupling between the rare-earth 5d and Ni 3d orbitals, confirmed by resonant inelastic X-ray scattering experiments. As the concentration of Eu increases, the system exhibits a clear tendency towards 3D superconductivity. Furthermore, we observe distinctive negative magnetoresistance in the europium-containing samples. These findings advocate clear materials design principles for higher transition temperatures and exotic physics in infinite-layer nickelate superconductors through structural engineering of the rare-earth site.

Title: Onsager Reciprocal Relations for Charge and Spin Transport in Periodically Driven Systems
Authors: Naoya Arakawa, Kenji Yonemitsu
Abstract: A time-periodic driving field can be used to generate and control transport phenomena. Any transport coefficients in the linear-response regime are restricted by the Onsager reciprocal relations, but these relations in periodically driven systems have been poorly understood. In particular, the Onsager reciprocal relation in spin transport of these systems is lacking despite its vital role. Here we establish the Onsager reciprocal relations for charge and spin transport in periodically driven systems. We consider the time-averaged charge and spin off-diagonal dc conductivities $\sigma_{yx}^{\textrm{C}}$ and $\sigma_{yx}^{\textrm{S}}$ in the nonequilibrium steady state with the pump field of light. First, we argue the Onsager reciprocal relations for these conductivities with the pump field of circularly, linearly, or bicircularly polarized light. We show that $\sigma_{yx}^{\textrm{C}}$ and $\sigma_{yx}^{\textrm{S}}$ satisfy the Onsager reciprocal relations in all the cases considered, but their main terms depend on the polarization of light. Our numerical calculations validate our general arguments. Therefore, the spin current generated in periodically driven systems is detectable by the inverse spin Hall effect. Our numerical calculations also show that $\sigma_{yx}^{\textrm{C}}$ cannot necessarily be regarded as the anomalous Hall conductivity even with broken time-reversal symmetry, whereas $\sigma_{yx}^{\textrm{S}}$ can be regarded as the spin Hall conductivity in all the cases considered. Our results suggest that it is highly required to check the dominant terms of the charge and spin off-diagonal conductivities in discussing the anomalous Hall and spin Hall effects, respectively. This study will become a cornerstone of theoretical and experimental studies of transport phenomena in periodically driven systems.

Title: Testing the parquet equations and the U(1) Ward identity for real-frequency correlation functions from the multipoint numerical renormalization group
Authors: Nepomuk Ritz, Anxiang Ge, Markus Frankenbach, Mathias Pelz, Jan von Delft, Fabian B. Kugler
Abstract: Recently, it has become possible to compute real-frequency four-point correlation functions of quantum impurity models using a multipoint extension of the numerical renormalization group (mpNRG). In this work, we perform several numerical consistency checks of the output of mpNRG by investigating exact relations between two- and four-point functions. This includes the Bethe-Salpeter equations and the Schwinger-Dyson equation from the parquet formalism, which we evaluate in two formally identical but numerically nonequivalent ways. We also study the first-order U(1) Ward identity between the vertex and the self-energy, which we derive for the first time in full generality in the real-frequency Keldysh formalism. We generally find good agreement of all relations, often up to a few percent, both at weak and at strong interaction.

Title: Non-Equilibrium Probing of Topological Supersolids in Spin-Orbit-Coupled Dipolar Condensates
Authors: Biao Dong, Xiao-Fei Zhang, Wei Han, Renyuan Liao, Xue-Ying Yang, Wu-Ming Liu, Yong-Chang Zhang
Abstract: A chiral supersolid is a quantum phase that simultaneously exhibits crystalline order, superfluidity, and topological spin texture, with spontaneously broken translational, U(1) gauge, and chiral symmetries. Here, we demonstrate a chiral supersolid with tunable non-equilibrium dynamics in a spin-orbit coupled dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate. By adjusting dipolar interaction and spin-orbit coupling, we uncover two distinct quantum phase transitions: (i) a first-order transition from a single skyrmion superfluid to a triangular meron supersolid, and (ii) a second-order transition from this superfluid to a square skyrmion supersolid. These phases are characterized by their lattice symmetries, nonclassical rotational inertia, and spin textures. Under parity-time symmetric dissipation, we predict phase-dependent damping of the current oscillations, directly linked to the superfluid fraction. The predicted chiral supersolid phase can be experimentally observed in ultracold magnetic atoms with spin-orbit coupling. Our results establish dipolar quantum gases as a platform for designing topological matter with spintronic functionality.

Title: Hierarchy of pairing in imbalanced three-component one-dimensional Fermi gas
Authors: Buğra Tüzemen, Tomasz Sowiński
Abstract: We study a one-dimensional, three-component Fermi gas with population imbalance using the Bogoliubov-de Gennes mean-field approach. We specifically consider pairing in two channels while deliberately excluding the third by setting its interaction strength to zero. By systematically varying the interaction strength and population imbalance, we identify a rich set of spatially modulated superfluid states, including structures akin to the Larkin-Ovchinnikov phase and phase-separated domains. A clear hierarchy emerges in the pairing behavior, shaped by the competition between the local density of states and the Fermi momentum mismatch. A fidelity-based analysis of the density further distinguishes smooth crossovers from sharp spatial reorganizations. Our results shed light on how pairing symmetry and population imbalance determine the structure of spatially inhomogeneous superfluid phases in multicomponent systems with reduced dimensionality.

Title: Quantum geometry and magnon Hall transport in an altermagnet
Authors: Erlend Syljuåsen, Alireza Qaiumzadeh, Asle Sudbø
Abstract: We compute magnon Hall conductivities in a minimal model of a two-dimensional altermagnet. To do so, we derive an analytic expression for the relevant quantum geometric tensor describing two-band bosonic Bogoliubov Hamiltonians, providing insight into the geometric, topological, and transport properties. The magnon thermal Hall and spin Nernst conductivities are shown to directly depend on the altermagnetic parameter, which may serve as an experimental probe of altermagnetism.

Title: Thermodynamic Cost of Random-Time Protocols
Authors: Izaak Neri
Abstract: Systems that are driven by a randomly timed, external protocol can seemingly violate the second law of thermodynamics. We show that this thermodynamic paradox is resolved if the outcome of the random time is stored in a memory device. Specifically, we show that the average work required to erase the memory is always larger than the average work gained from the protocol. We also discuss experimentally implementable setups that measure random times directly without continuous monitoring. Taken together, this paper discusses the relationship between temporal information and thermodynamics. This framework is relevant for external protocols employing random times, such as, stochastic resetting protocols and cyclically driven heat engines that use randomly timed protocols.

Title: Characterizing Spin-Orbit Torques by Tensorial Spin Hall Magnetoresistance
Authors: Hantao Zhang, Ran Cheng
Abstract: Magnetoresistance (MR) provides a crucial tool for experimentally studying spin torques. While MR is well established in the device geometry of the spin Hall effect (SHE), as exemplified by the magnet/heavy-metal heterostructures, its role and manifestation beyond the SHE paradigm remain elusive. We propose a hitherto unknown form of MR where the underlying charge-to-spin conversion and its inverse process violate the simple geometry of the SHE, calling for tensorial descriptions. This MR can generate a series of unique harmonic responses essential for the experimental characterization of unconventional spin-orbit torques in non-SHE materials. We demonstrate these harmonic signals with semimetal WTe$_2$ in mind but the results are not restricted to specific materials.

Title: Effects of Antisite Defects on Seebeck Coefficient in Fe_2VAl -- Analyses based on Bipolar Random Anderson Model
Authors: Takami Tohyama, Hidetoshi Fukuyama
Abstract: A microscopic mechanism is proposed for a dramatic sign change of the Seebeck coefficient from positive to negative sign by the introduction of antisite defects in Fe$_2$VAl based on bipolar random Anderson model (BPRAM), which incorporates hybridization effects between randomly distributed antisites and host bands, where the valence and conduction bands are treated separately due to their separation in momentum space. Applying a self-consistent T-matrix approximation, we find that antisite defects in Fe$_2$VAl induce new states in the band overlap region, resulting in a scattering rate that is higher for hole carriers in the valence band than that for electron carriers in the conduction band, leading to negative Seebeck coefficient. This mechanism of sign change presents a potential new approach for controlling thermoelectric properties in semimetallic systems without changing carrier concentration.

Title: Chiral-split magnons in the S = 1 Shastry-Sutherland model
Authors: Absur Khan Siam, Se Kwon Kim
Abstract: In ferromagnets, magnons have only one chirality; while in common antiferromagnets, bands with opposite chiralities are degenerate across the Brillouin zone. Recent studies have shown that it is possible to observe non-degenerate bands of opposite chiralities in altermagnetic materials. Here we take the S = 1 Shastry-Sutherland model, which shows the collinear Néel (I) phase, and investigate the magnon band structure showing alternate chirality-splitting and the resulting transport properties. In magnon bands, we find a notable feature of the chirality-split magnon bands, and the split is opposite along two different directions in the Brillouin zone. We also calculate the spin and thermal conductivities using Kubo formalism. Our calculations show robust spin Seebeck and spin Nernst effects due to the alternating chirality split across the Brillouin zone, without any external magnetic field and spin-orbit coupling.

Title: Coupling of magnetic and lattice collective excitations in the 2D van der Waals antiferromagnet FePS$_{3}$
Authors: Kartik Panda, Itzik Kapon, Dumitru Dumcenco, Dirk van der Marel, Alexey Kuzmenko, Nimrod Bachar
Abstract: We combine polarized infrared magneto-transmission and Faraday angle rotation measurements to map the collective excitations of the van der Waals antiferromagnet FePS$_3$. Below the Néel temperature ($T_\mathrm{N} \approx 118$ K), the phonon spectrum becomes strongly anisotropic, while a prominent excitation at 122 cm$^{-1}$ (15 meV) hardens on cooling and splits linearly with magnetic field,identifying its magnetic origin. From absolute transmission and Faraday angle measurements, we reconstruct the circular optical conductivities, revealing a pronounced dichroism of the field-split excitations. The upper branch near 129 cm$^{-1}$ shows an anomalously reduced dichroism, consistent with spin-phonon hybridization with a nearby infrared phonon. Several phonons exhibit sizable Faraday rotation, and Raman-active modes appear in the infrared spectra. Together with a broad mid-infrared band near 900 cm$^{-1}$ emerging only below $T_\mathrm{N}$, these observations point to inversion-symmetry breaking in the magnetic state. A weak Faraday feature near 320 cm$^{-1}$ ($\sim 40$ meV) further supports the presence of a higher-energy magnetic excitation. These findings underscore the intricate interplay between magnetic and lattice degrees of freedom in FePS$_3$ and establish its relevance for exploring spin-lattice interactions in two-dimensional antiferromagnetic materials.

Title: Double Helix of atomic displacements in Ferroelectric PbTiO$_3$
Authors: Yihao Hu, Shi Liu
Abstract: Recent theoretical work has predicted the existence of a "dipole spiral" structure in strained freestanding membranes of PbTiO$_3$, suggesting a potential route to enhanced electromechanical responses [\href{this https URL}{PRL \textbf{133}, 046802 (2024)}]. However, its microscopic nature, energetic landscape, and electronic properties remain largely unexplored from a first-principles perspective. Here, using density function theory on PbTiO$_3$ under biaxial tensile strain, we identify a novel form of polar order: a chiral, non-collinear ferroelectric double helix. We find that the Pb- and Ti-cation sublattices form two distinct, intertwined helices, reminiscent of DNA. This topology is stabilized by a collective helical twisting of the oxygen octahedral framework, which gives rise to an electric Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya-like interaction. The resulting structure, which can be canceptualized as a "self-Moiré" crystal, exhibits two coupled functionalities. First, it possesses a rotational pseudo-zero-energy mode that underpins a giant piezoelectric response ($e_{33}\approx$16 C/m$^2$). Second, the long-period potential reconstructs the electronic band structure, leading to a multi-valley electronic topology at the valence band edge. Our work establishes a physical route to designing complex chiral order that supports both giant electromechanical coupling and multi-valley electronics.

Title: Topological hydrodynamics in spin-triplet superconductors
Authors: Chau Dao, Eric Kleinherbers, Bjørnulf Brekke, Yaroslav Tserkovnyak
Abstract: Due to the structure of the underlying SO(3) $\mathbf d$-vector order parameter, spin triplet superconductors exhibit a bulk-edge correspondence linking the circulation of supercurrent to the bulk magnetic skyrmion density, giving rise to topological hydrodynamics of magnetic skyrmions. To probe the interplay of charge and spin dynamics, we propose a blueprint for a spin-triplet superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID), which functions without a Josephson weak link. The triplet SQUID undergoes nonsingular $4\pi$ phase slips, in which current relaxation is facilitated by spin dynamics that trace out a magnetic skyrmion texture. Inductively coupling the device to a tank circuit and probing the nonlinear supercurrent response via Oersted field measurements could provide an experimental signature of ferromagnetic spin-triplet superconductivity.

Title: Exceptional flat bands in bipartite non-Hermitian quantum crystals
Authors: Juan Pablo Esparza, Vladimir Juricic
Abstract: Flat bands, in which kinetic energy is quenched and quantum states become macroscopically degenerate, host a rich variety of correlated and topological phases, from unconventional superconductors to fractional Chern insulators. In Hermitian lattices, their formation mechanisms are now well understood, but whether such states persist, and acquire new features in non-Hermitian (NH) quantum crystals, relevant to open and driven systems, has remained an open question. Here we show that the Hermitian principle for flat-band formation in bipartite lattices, based on a sublattice degeneracy mismatch, extends directly to the NH regime: whenever one sublattice hosts a momentum-independent eigenvalue with degeneracy exceeding that of its partner on the other sublattice, flat bands arise regardless of gain, loss, or complex couplings. Strikingly, at exceptional points, dispersive bands coalesce to form \emph{exceptional flat bands} that persist beyond these singularities, exhibiting biorthogonal eigenmodes spanning both sublattices, with energies and lifetimes tunable via sublattice asymmetry and non-reciprocal couplings. This general framework unifies Hermitian and NH flat-band constructions, and reveals dispersionless states with no closed-system analogue. The proposed construction is applicable to synthetic platforms, from classical metamaterials, where flat bands can be directly emulated, to quantum-engineered systems such as photonic crystals and ultracold atom arrays, which should host correlated and topological phases emerging from such exceptional flat bands.

Title: Universal Thermodynamics of Dunkl-Deformed Bose Gases: From Power-Law Traps to Physical Bounds
Authors: M. Medani, M. Benarous, A. Hocine, F. Merabtine
Abstract: We study an ideal Bose gas confined by a $D$-dimensional power-law potential within the framework of the Dunkl formalism. By analyzing the combined effects of spatial dimensionality and trap geometry, we derive universal expressions for the thermodynamic quantities, which depend solely on a single parameter. This reduction reveals the existence of universality classes that apply to any power-law potential, regardless of its specific form.

Title: Josephson diode effect in nanowire-based Andreev molecules

Abstract: Superconducting systems exhibit non-reciprocal current transport under certain conditions of symmetry breaking, a phenomenon known as the superconducting diode effect. This effect allows for perfect rectification of supercurrent, and has received considerable research interest. We report the observation of the Josephson diode effect (JDE) in nanowire-based Andreev molecules, where the time-reversal and spatial-inversion symmetries of a Josephson junction (JJ) can be nonlocally broken by coherently coupling to another JJ. The JDE can be controlled using both non-local phase and gate voltages. Notably, the non-local phase can induce a sign reversal of the diode efficiency, a manifestation of regulating the probabilities of double elastic cotunneling and double-crossed Andreev reflection. Additionally, the diode efficiency can be further modulated by local and non-local gate voltages, exhibiting a central-peak feature in the gate-voltage space. Our theoretical calculations of the energy spectrum and the Josephson currents align well with the experimental results. These results demonstrate the non-local regulation of the JDE in Andreev molecules, offering significant implications for the control of multi-JJ devices and the development of advanced superconducting devices.

Title: The Kikuchi Hierarchy and Tensor PCA
Authors: Alexander S. Wein, Ahmed El Alaoui, Cristopher Moore
Abstract: For the tensor PCA (principal component analysis) problem, we propose a new hierarchy of increasingly powerful algorithms with increasing runtime. Our hierarchy is analogous to the sum-of-squares (SOS) hierarchy but is instead inspired by statistical physics and related algorithms such as belief propagation and AMP (approximate message passing). Our level-$\ell$ algorithm can be thought of as a linearized message-passing algorithm that keeps track of $\ell$-wise dependencies among the hidden variables. Specifically, our algorithms are spectral methods based on the Kikuchi Hessian, which generalizes the well-studied Bethe Hessian to the higher-order Kikuchi free energies. It is known that AMP, the flagship algorithm of statistical physics, has substantially worse performance than SOS for tensor PCA. In this work we 'redeem' the statistical physics approach by showing that our hierarchy gives a polynomial-time algorithm matching the performance of SOS. Our hierarchy also yields a continuum of subexponential-time algorithms, and we prove that these achieve the same (conjecturally optimal) tradeoff between runtime and statistical power as SOS. Our proofs are much simpler than prior work, and also apply to the related problem of refuting random $k$-XOR formulas. The results we present here apply to tensor PCA for tensors of all orders, and to $k$-XOR when $k$ is even. Our methods suggest a new avenue for systematically obtaining optimal algorithms for Bayesian inference problems, and our results constitute a step toward unifying the statistical physics and sum-of-squares approaches to algorithm design.

Title: A Robust Large-Period Discrete Time Crystal and its Signature in a Digital Quantum Computer
Authors: Tianqi Chen, Ruizhe Shen, Ching Hua Lee, Bo Yang, Raditya Weda Bomantara
Abstract: Discrete time crystals (DTCs) are novel out-of-equilibrium quantum states of matter which break time translational symmetry. DTCs have been extensively realized in experiments, particularly their subclass that is characterized by period-doubling dynamics due to its natural occurrence in a system of periodically driven two-level, e.g., spin-1/2, particles. The realization of DTCs beyond period-doubling, including their generalizations termed discrete quasicrystals has also been made in recent years, though such experiments typically involve higher spin particles. Constructing and observing DTCs beyond period-doubling in systems of two-level particles are generally still considered an open challenge due to the latter's $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry that natively only leads to period-doubling. In this work, we developed an intuitive interacting system of two-level particles (qubits) that supports the more non-trivial period-quadrupling DTCs ($4T$-DTCs). Remarkably, by utilizing a variational algorithm, we are able to observe clear signatures of such $4T$-DTCs in a quantum processor despite the presence of considerable noise and the small number of available qubits. Our findings extend the landscape of time crystalline behavior by demonstrating a distinct realization of time crystallinity beyond standard period-doubling dynamics with qubits (two-level particles) on a NISQ-era digital quantum computer, as well as the potential of existing noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices for simulating exotic non-equilibrium quantum states of matter.

Title: Exact threshold for approximate ellipsoid fitting of random points
Authors: Afonso S. Bandeira, Antoine Maillard
Abstract: We consider the problem $(\rm P)$ of exactly fitting an ellipsoid (centered at $0$) to $n$ standard Gaussian random vectors in $\mathbb{R}^d$, as $n, d \to \infty$ with $n / d^2 \to \alpha > 0$. This problem is conjectured to undergo a sharp transition: with high probability, $(\rm P)$ has a solution if $\alpha < 1/4$, while $(\rm P)$ has no solutions if $\alpha > 1/4$. So far, only a trivial bound $\alpha > 1/2$ is known to imply the absence of solutions, while the sharpest results on the positive side assume $\alpha \leq \eta$ (for $\eta > 0$ a small constant) to prove that $(\rm P)$ is solvable. In this work we show a universality property for the minimal fitting error achievable by ellipsoids: we show that, to leading order, it coincides with the minimal error in a so-called "Gaussian equivalent" problem, for which the satisfiability transition can be rigorously analyzed. Our main results follow from this finding, and they are twofold. On the positive side, we prove that if $\alpha < 1/4$, there exists an ellipsoid fitting all the points up to a small error, and that the lengths of its principal axes are bounded above and below. On the other hand, for $\alpha > 1/4$, we show that achieving small fitting error is not possible if the length of the ellipsoid's shortest axis does not approach $0$ as $d \to \infty$ (and in particular there does not exist any ellipsoid fit whose shortest axis length is bounded away from $0$ as $d \to \infty$). To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first rigorous result characterizing the expected phase transition in ellipsoid fitting at $\alpha = 1/4$. In a companion non-rigorous work, the second author and D. Kunisky give a general analysis of ellipsoid fitting using the replica method of statistical physics, which inspired the present work.

Title: Thermal and Quantum Phase Transitions of the $ϕ^4$ Model
Authors: István Gábor Márián, Andrea Trombettoni, István Nándori
Abstract: In this paper we discuss and revisit the finite temperature extension of the renormalization group (RG) treatment of $T=0$ field theories, focusing as a case study on the $\phi^4$ model. We first discuss the extension of RG equations of the very same model from $T=0$ to finite $T$ in the usual way by resorting to sums on the Matsubara frequencies and fixing the physical temperature parameter $T$. We show that this approach, although useful for a variety of applications, may lead to the disappearance of the critical points as extracted from the RG flow. Since the identification of fixed points is key in the study of classical and quantum phase transitions, wepropose a modification of the usual finite-temperature RG approach by relating the temperature parameter to the running RG scale, $T \equiv k_T = \tau k$ where $k_T$ is the running cutoff for thermal, and $k$ is for the quantum fluctuations. Once introduced this dimensionless temperature $\tau$, we investigate the consequences on the thermal RG approach for the $\phi^4$ model and construct its phase diagram. Finally, we formulate requirements for the phase diagram of the $\phi^4$ theory based on known properties of the quantum and classical phase diagrams of the Ising model.

Title: Operational work fluctuation theorem for open quantum systems
Authors: Konstantin Beyer, Walter T. Strunz
Abstract: The classical Jarzynski equality establishes an exact relation between the stochastic work performed on a system driven out of thermal equilibrium and the free energy difference in a corresponding quasi-static process. This fluctuation theorem bears experimental relevance, as it enables the determination of the free energy difference through the measurement of externally applied work in a nonequilibrium process. In the quantum case, the Jarzynski equality only holds if the measurement procedure of the stochastic work is drastically changed: it is replaced by a so-called two-point measurement (TPM) scheme that requires the knowledge of the initial and final Hamiltonian and therefore lacks the predictive power for the free energy difference that the classical Jarzynski equation is known for. Here, we propose a quantum fluctuation theorem that is valid for externally measurable quantum work determined during the driving protocol. In contrast to the TPM case, the theorem also applies to open quantum systems and the scenario can be realized without knowing the system Hamiltonian. Our fluctuation theorem comes in the form of an inequality and therefore only yields bounds to the true free energy difference. The inequality is saturated in the quasiclassical case of vanishing energy coherences at the beginning and at the end of the protocol. Thus, there is a clear quantum disadvantage.

Title: Geometric Floquet theory
Authors: Paul M. Schindler, Marin Bukov
Abstract: We derive Floquet theory from quantum geometry. We identify quasienergy folding as a consequence of a broken gauge group of the adiabatic gauge potential $U(1){\mapsto}\mathbb{Z}$. Fixing instead the gauge freedom using the parallel-transport gauge uniquely decomposes Floquet dynamics into a purely geometric and a purely dynamical evolution. The dynamical average-energy operator provides an unambiguous sorting of the quasienergy spectrum, identifying a Floquet ground state and suggesting a way to define the filling of Floquet-Bloch bands. We exemplify the features of geometric Floquet theory using an exactly solvable XY model and a non-integrable kicked Ising chain. We elucidate the geometric origin of inherently nonequilibrium effects, like the $\pi$-quasienergy splitting in discrete time crystals or $\pi$-edge modes in anomalous Floquet topological insulators. The spectrum of the average-energy operator is a susceptible indicator for both heating and spatiotemporal symmetry-breaking transitions. Last, we demonstrate that the periodic lab frame Hamiltonian generates transitionless counterdiabatic driving for Floquet eigenstates. This work directly bridges seemingly unrelated areas of nonequilibrium physics.

Title: Low-density parity-check codes as stable phases of quantum matter
Authors: Chao Yin, Andrew Lucas
Abstract: Phases of matter with robust ground-state degeneracy, such as the quantum toric code, are known to be capable of robust quantum information storage. Here, we address the converse question: given a quantum error correcting code, when does it define a stable gapped quantum phase of matter, whose ground state degeneracy is robust against perturbations in the thermodynamic limit? We prove that a low-density parity-check (LDPC) code defines such a phase, robust against all few-body perturbations, if its code distance grows at least logarithmically in the number of degrees of freedom, and it exhibits "check soundness". Many constant-rate quantum LDPC expander codes have such properties, and define stable phases of matter with a constant zero-temperature entropy density, violating the third law of thermodynamics. Our results also show that quantum toric code phases are robust to spatially nonlocal few-body perturbations. Similarly, phases of matter defined by classical codes are stable against symmetric perturbations. In the classical setting, we present improved locality bounds on the quasiadiabatic evolution operator between two nearby states in the same code phase.

Title: Analysis of discrete modern Hopfield networks in open quantum system
Authors: Takeshi Kimura, Kohtaro Kato
Abstract: The modern Hopfield network, proposed by Krotov and Hopfield, is a mathematical generalization of the Hopfield network, which is a basic model of associative memory that employs higher-order interactions. This study introduces an open quantum model for discrete modern Hopfield networks that generalizes the open quantum Hopfield network. Our model integrates dissipative quantum spin systems, governed by quantum master equations, with classical hopping terms and additional quantum effects through a transverse field. We analytically examined the behavior of the stable fixed points and numerically determined the phase diagram. The results demonstrated qualitatively distinct behaviors from the open quantum Hopfield network, showing that the ferromagnetic and limit cycle phases have additional stable fixed points.

Title: $2$-Rényi CCNR Negativity of Compact Boson for multiple disjoint intervals
Authors: Himanshu Gaur
Abstract: We investigate mixed-state bipartite entanglement between multiple disjoint intervals using the computable cross-norm criterion (CCNR). We consider entanglement between a single interval and the union of remaining disjoint intervals, and compute $2$-Rényi CCNR negativity for $2$d massless compact boson. The expression for $2$-Rényi CCNR negativity is given in terms of cross-ratios and Riemann period matrices of Riemann surfaces involved in the calculation. In general, the Riemann surfaces involved in the calculation of $n$-Rényi CCNR negativity do not possess a $Z_n$ symmetry. We also evaluate the Reflected Rényi entropy related to the $2$-Rényi CCNR negativity. This Reflected Rényi entropy is a universal quantity. We extend these calculations to the $2$d massless Dirac fermions as well. Finally, the analytical results are checked against the numerical evaluations in the tight-binding model and are found to be in good agreement.

Abstract: The statistics of particles and extended excitations, such as loops and membranes, are fundamental to modern condensed matter physics, high-energy physics, and quantum information science, yet a comprehensive lattice-level framework for computing them remains elusive. In this work, we develop a universal microscopic method to determine the generalized statistics of Abelian excitations on lattices of arbitrary dimension, and demonstrate it by deriving the statistics of particles, loops, and membranes in up to three spatial dimensions. Our approach constructs a sequence of local unitary operators whose many-body Berry phase encodes the desired statistical invariant. The required sequence is generated automatically from the Smith normal form of locality constraints and therefore needs no extra physical input. We prove that the resulting invariants are quantized, provide an algorithm that computes them efficiently, and show how they unify familiar braiding and fusion data of particles while also uncovering new self- and mutual-statistics of loop and membrane excitations. We further demonstrate that each statistical invariant corresponds to an 't Hooft anomaly of a generalized symmetry; we show that a non-trivial invariant both (i) obstructs gauging that symmetry and (ii) forbids any short-range-entangled (symmetry-preserving) ground state. This establishes a precise connection between microscopic lattice anomalies and many-body dynamics, providing a generalization of the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem that constrains a wide class of quantum lattice systems.

Title: Observation and mitigation of microwave echoes from dielectric defects in Josephson traveling wave amplifiers
Authors: Matteo Boselli, Joel Grebel, Ambroise Peugeot, Rémy Dassonneville, Benjamin Huard, Audrey Bienfait
Abstract: Amplifying microwave signals with a noise close to the minimum imposed by quantum mechanics is now routinely performed with superconducting quantum devices. In particular, Josephson-based Traveling Wave Parametric Amplifiers (JTWPA) have shown record bandwidth with added noise close to the quantum limit. In this work, we report the appearance of echo signals emitted by JTWPAs driven by trains of high-power pulses exceeding their dynamical range. we explore the case of weak signals generated through high power pulses. By sending a train of such high-power pulses, beyond the 1 dB compression point of such amplifiers, we observe the appearance of echoes, solely due to the JTWPA. These echoes have micro-second coherence and we attribute their origin to microscopic defects in the amplifier dielectric layer. By analyzing the power and the coherence of the echo signal as a function of temperature, we estimate the dielectric loss brought by these defects, and their impact on the JTWPA quantum efficiency. We introduce a mitigation technique (BLAST) to prevent the appearance of these echoes, consisting in an additional high-power tone sent concurrently with each pulse. We demonstrate that it suppresses the spurious defect signals and we recover the typical gain and noise figure within 95% of their low-power values in 300 ns. These results can help to extend the use of JTWPAs in experiments where fast high-power sequences are necessary to generate weak microwave responses from the system under study, and also provide a path towards characterizing in-situ the dielectric losses of these devices.

Title: Anyon Theory and Topological Frustration of High-Efficiency Quantum Low-Density Parity-Check Codes
Authors: Keyang Chen, Yuanting Liu, Yiming Zhang, Zijian Liang, Yu-An Chen, Ke Liu, Hao Song
Abstract: Quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes offer a promising path to low-overhead fault-tolerant quantum computation but lack systematic strategies for exploration. In this Letter, we establish a topological framework for studying the bivariate-bicycle codes, a prominent class of QLDPC codes tailored for real-world quantum hardware. Our framework enables the investigation of these codes through universal properties of topological orders. In addition to efficient characterizations using Gröbner bases, we also introduce a novel algebraic-geometric approach based on the Bernstein--Khovanskii--Kushnirenko theorem. This approach allows us to analytically determine how the topological order varies with the generic choices of bivariate-bicycle codes under toric layouts. Novel phenomena are unveiled, including topological frustration, where ground-state degeneracy on a torus deviates from the total anyon number, and quasi-fractonic mobility, where anyon movement violates energy conservation. We demonstrate their intrinsic link to symmetry-enriched topological orders and derive an efficient method for generating finite-size codes. Furthermore, we extend the connection between anyons and logical operators using Koszul complex theory. Our Letter provides a rigorous theoretical basis for exploring the fault tolerance of QLDPC codes and deepens the interplay among topological order, quantum error correction, and advanced algebraic structures.

Title: Entropy Measures for Transition Matrices in Random Systems
Authors: Zhaohui Chen, Rene Meyer, Zhuo-Yu Xian
Abstract: A transition matrix can be constructed through the partial contraction of two given quantum states. We analyze and compare four different definitions of entropy for transition matrices, including (modified) pseudo entropy, SVD entropy, and ABB entropy. We examine the probabilistic interpretation of each entropy measure and show that only the distillation interpretation of ABB entropy corresponds to the joint success probability of distilling entanglement between the two quantum states used to construct the transition matrix. Combining the transition matrix with preceding measurements and subsequent non-unitary operations, the ABB entropy either decreases or remains unchanged, whereas the pseudo-entropy and SVD entropy may increase or decrease. We further apply these entropy measures to transition matrices constructed from several ensembles: (i) pairs of independent Haar-random states; (ii) bi-orthogonal eigenstates of non-Hermitian random systems; and (iii) bi-orthogonal states in $PT$-symmetric systems near their exceptional points. Across all cases considered, the SVD and ABB entropies of the transition matrix closely mirror the behavior of the subsystem entanglement entropy of a single random state, in contrast to the (modified) pseudo entropy, which can exceed the bound of subsystem size, fail to scale with system size, or even take complex values.

Title: Generalized Symmetries From Fusion Actions
Authors: Chongying Dong, Siu-Hung Ng, Li Ren, Feng Xu
Abstract: Let $A$ be a condensable algebra in a modular tensor category $\mathcal{C}$. We define an action of the fusion category $\mathcal{C}_A$ of $A$-modules in $\mathcal{C}$ on the morphism space Hom$_{\mathcal{C}}(x,A)$ for any $x$ in $\mathcal{C}$, whose characters are generalized Frobenius-Schur indicators. This fusion action can be considered on $A$, and we prove a categorical generalization of Schur-Weyl duality for this action. For any fusion subcategory $\mathcal{B}$ of $\mathcal{C}_A$ containing all the local $A$-modules, we prove the invariant subobject $B=A^\mathcal{B}$ is a condensable subalgebra of $A$. The assignment of $\mathcal{B}$ to $A^\mathcal{B}$ defines a Galois correspondence between this kind of fusion subcategories of $\mathcal{C}_A$ and the condensable subalgebras of $A$. In the context of VOA, we prove for any nice VOAs $U \subset A$, $U=A^{\mathcal{C}_A}$ where $\mathcal{C}=\mathcal{M}_U$ is the $U$-module category. In particular, if $U = A^G$ for some finite automorphism group $G$ of $A,$ the fusion action of $\mathcal{C}_A$ on $A$ is equivalent to the $G$-action on $A.$
