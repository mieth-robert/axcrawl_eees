Title: Quantum theory of fractional topological pumping of lattice solitons
Authors: Julius Bohm, Hugo Gerlitz, Christina Jörg, Michael Fleischhauer
Abstract: One of the hallmarks of topological quantum systems is the robust quantization of particle transport, which is the origin of the integer-valued Quantum Hall conductivity. In the presence of interactions the topological transport can also become fractional. Recent experiments on topological pumps constructed by arrays of photonic waveguides have demonstrated both integer and fractional transport of lattice solitons. Here a background medium mediates interactions between photons via a Kerr nonlinearity and leads to the formation of self-bound composites, called lattice solitons. Upon increasing the interaction strength of these solitons a sequence of transitions was observed from a phase with integer transport in a pump cycle through different phases of fractional transport to a phase with no transport. We here present a full quantum description of topological pumps of solitons. This approach allows us to identify a topological invariant, a many-body Chern number, determined by the band structure of the center-of-mass (COM) momentum of the solitons, which fully governs their transport. Increasing the interaction leads to a successive merging of COM bands which explains the observed sequence of topological phase transitions and also the potential for a breakdown of topological quantization for intermediate interaction strength

Title: Holon metal, charge-density-wave and chiral superconductor from doping fractional Chern insulator and SU(3)$_1$ chiral spin liquid
Authors: Ya-Hui Zhang
Abstract: Recent experiment observed a superconductor proximate to the $\nu_h=-\frac{2}{3}=-1+\frac{1}{3}$ fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) insulator in twisted MoTe$_2$. One critical question is whether the normal state is a Fermi liquid with large Fermi surface, or a strongly correlated metallic state with small carrier density. In this work we develop a theory of possible phases from doping the $\nu=-\frac{2}{3}$ fractional Chern insulator (FCI). We also point out that the problem is dual to doping a SU(3)$_1$ chiral spin liquid(CSL) if we assume that the spin gap is finite. For both problems, a natural phase upon doping is a holon metal with three small Fermi pockets. The pocket is formed by a spinless charge $-e$ holon in the doped CSL case and a charge $-e/3$ fractionalized hole in the doped FCI case. The holon metal is likely unstable to pairing due to gauge field fluctuations, leading to a charge density wave (CDW) metal, but may be stabilized by magnetic field and shows an unusual quantum oscillation period. Two different chiral superconductors are possible, emerging from the CDW metal phase or directly from the holon metal. We note that a superconductor directly from anyon gas seems unlikely if the cheapest anyon is the elementary one with $e/3$ charge.

Title: Symmetry-deformed toric codes and the quantum dimer model
Authors: Jiaxin Qiao, Yoshito Watanabe, Simon Trebst
Abstract: Motivated by the recent introduction of a $U(1)$-symmetric toric code model, we investigate symmetry-based deformations of topological order by systematically deconstructing the Gauss-law-enforcing star terms of the toric code (TC) Hamiltonian. This "term-dropping" protocol introduces global symmetries that go beyond the alternative framework of "ungauging" topological order in symmetry-deformed models and gives rise to models such as the $U(1)$TC or $XY$TC. These models inherit (emergent) subsystem symmetries (from the original 1-form symmetry of the TC) that can give rise to (subextensive) ground-state degeneracies, which can still be organized by the eigenvalues of Wilson loop operators. However, we demonstrate that these models do not support topological or fracton order (as has been conjectured in the literature) due to the loss of (emergent) gauge symmetry. An extreme deformation of the TC is the quantum dimer model (QDM), which we discuss along the family of symmetry-deformed models from the perspective of subsystem symmetries, sublattice modulation, and quantum order-by-disorder mechanisms resulting in rich phase diagrams. For the QDM, this allows us to identify an emergent SO(2) symmetry for what appears to be a gapless ground state (by numerical standards) that is unstable to the formation of a plaquette valence bond solid upon sublattice modulation.

Title: Absence of topological order in the $U(1)$ checkerboard toric code
Authors: M. Vieweg, V. Kott, L. Lenke, A. Schellenberger, K.P. Schmidt
Abstract: We investigate the $U(1)$ checkerboard toric code which corresponds to the $U(1)$-symmetry enriched toric code with two distinct star sublattices. One can therefore tune from the limit of isolated stars to the uniform system. The uniform system has been conjectured to possess non-Abelian topological order based on quantum Monte Carlo simulations suggesting a non-trivial ground-state degeneracy depending on the compactification of the finite clusters. Here we show that these non-trivial properties can be naturally explained in the perturbative limit of isolated stars. Indeed, the compactification dependence of the ground-state degeneracy can be traced back to geometric constraints stemming from the plaquette operators. Further, the ground-state degeneracy is fully lifted in fourth-order degenerate perturbation theory giving rise to a non-topological phase with confined fracton excitations. These fractons are confined for small perturbations so that they cannot exist as single low-energy excitation in the thermodynamic limit but only as topologically trivially composite particles. However, the confinement scale is shown to be surprisingly large so that finite-size gaps are extremely small on finite clusters up to the uniform limit which is calculated explicitly by high-order series expansions. Our findings suggest that these gaps were not distinguished from finite-size effects by the recent quantum Monte Carlo simulation in the uniform limit. All our results therefore point towards the absence of topological order in the $U(1)$ checkerboard toric code along the whole parameter axis.

Title: Measuring the ferromagnetic resonance cone angle via static dipolar fields using diamond spins
Authors: B. A. McCullian, M. Chilcote, H. Yusuf, E. Johnston-Halperin, G. D. Fuchs
Abstract: We demonstrate quantitative measurement of the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) precession cone angle of a micro-scale sample of vanadium tetracyanoethylene (V[TCNE]$_{x\sim 2}$) using diamond spins. V[TCNE]$_{x\sim 2}$ is a low-damping, low-magnetization ferrimagnet with potential for scalable spintronics applications. Our study is motivated by the persistent need for quantitative metrology to accurately characterize magnetic dynamics and relaxation. Recently, diamond spins have emerged as sensitive probes of static and dynamic magnetic signals. Unlike analog sensors that require additional calibration, diamond spins respond to magnetic fields via a frequency shift that can be compared with frequency standards. We use a spin echo-based approach to measure the precession-induced change to the static stray dipolar field of a pair of V[TCNE]$_{x\sim 2}$ discs under FMR excitation. Using these stray dipolar field measurements and micromagnetic simulations, we extract the precession cone angle. Additionally, we quantitatively measure the microwave field amplitude using the same diamond spins, thus forming a quantitative link between drive and response. We find that our V[TCNE]$_{x\sim 2}$ sample can be driven to a cone angle of at least 6$^{\circ}$ with a microwave field amplitude of only 0.53 G. This work highlights the power of diamond spins for local, quantitative magnetic characterization.

Title: How important is the dielectric constant in water modeling? Evaluation of the performance of the TIP4P/$\varepsilon$ force field and its compatibility with the Joung-Cheetham NaCl model
Authors: Łukasz Baran, Cosmin A. Dicu-Gohoreanu, Luis G. MacDowell
Abstract: Efficient large scale computer simulations of complex aqueous solutions require the use of accurate but simple empirical force fields for water. However, the growing complexity of these systems is evidencing the difficulties to describe solution properties without due account of polarization. Conflicting strategies to remedy this problem are parametrizing water force fields to the dielectric constant or charge scaling of the solvated ions. In this work we compare results from TIP4P/$\varepsilon$ and OPC models, which are parametrized with an emphasis in the prediction of the dielectric constant, with results from TIP4P/2005, which is closer in spirit to the charge scaling strategy. The overall performance of the models is rated according to the Vega-Abascal benchmark. Our results show that TIP4P$/\varepsilon$ and TIP4P/2005 perform equally good, with the OPC model lying significantly behind. TIP4P/$\varepsilon$ can predict bulk phase properties (transport properties, thermal expansion coefficients, densities) of both liquid water and ice polymorphs, as well as surface tensions, with an accuracy very similar to TIP4P/2005, while performing very well for dielectric constants over a wide range of pressures and temperatures. On the other hand, TIP4P/2005 provides a better description of phase boundaries, including liquid-vapor and freezing transitions. However, the accurate prediction of dielectric constants allows TIP4P/$\varepsilon$ to describe solution densities for model ions targeted to their crystal and melt properties. This is achieved without the need to rescale charges, modify the Lorentz-Berthelot rule or tune the ion's Lennard-Jones parameters. Our findings hinge on the significance of dielectric constants as a target property and cast some doubt on the need for the appealing concept of charge scaling.

Title: Expressivity of determinantal anzatzes for neural network wave functions
Authors: Ni Zhan, William A. Wheeler, Elif Ertekin, Ryan P. Adams, Lucas K. Wagner
Abstract: Neural network wave functions have shown promise as a way to achieve high accuracy on the many-body quantum problem. These wave functions most commonly use a determinant or sum of determinants to antisymmetrize many-body orbitals which are described by a neural network. In previous literature, the spin has been treated as a non-dynamical variable, with each electron assigned a fixed spin label of up or down. Such a treatment is allowed for spin-independent operators; however, it cannot be applied to spin-dependent problems, such as Hamiltonians containing spin-orbit interactions. We provide an extension of neural networks to fully spinor wave functions, which can be applied to spin-dependent problems. We also show that for spin-independent Hamiltonians, a strict upper bound property is obeyed between a traditional Hartree-Fock like determinant, full spinor wave function, and the so-called full determinant wave function of Pfau et al. The relationship between a spinor wave function and the full determinant arises because the full determinant wave function is the spinor wave function projected onto a fixed spin, after which antisymmetry is implicitly restored in the spin-independent case. For spin-dependent Hamiltonians, the full determinant wave function is not applicable, because it is not antisymmetric. Numerical experiments on the H$_3$ molecule and two-dimensional homogeneous electron gas confirm the bounds.

Title: Transition from Optically Excited to Intrinsic Spin Polarization in WSe$_2$
Authors: Sebastian Hedwig, Gregor Zinke, Jürgen Braun, Benito Arnoldi, Aki Pulkkinen, Ján Minár, Hubert Ebert, Martin Aeschlimann, Benjamin Stadtmüller
Abstract: Layered 2D van der Waals materials, such as transition metal dichalcogenides, are promising for nanoscale spintronic and optoelectronic applications. Harnessing their full potential requires understanding both intrinsic transport and the dynamics of optically excited spin and charge carriers -- particularly the transition between excited spin polarization and the conduction band's intrinsic spin texture. Here, we investigate the spin polarization of the conduction bands of bulk WSe$_2$ using static and time-resolved spin-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, complemented by photocurrent calculations. Electron doping reveals the intrinsic spin polarization, while time-resolved measurements trace the evolution of excited spin carriers. We find that intervalley scattering is spin-conserving, with spin transport initially governed by photoexcited carriers and aligning with the intrinsic conduction band polarization after $\sim$150 fs.

Title: Self-ion implantation and structural relaxation in amorphous silicon
Authors: J.M. Gibson, Robe Elliman, T. Susi, C. Mangler
Abstract: Self-ion implantation amorphization is an established approach to study the structure and properties of amorphous silicon (a-Si). Fluctuation Electron Microscopy (FEM) has consistently observed Medium-Range Order (MRO) in this system that is not consistent with the Continuous Random Network (CRN) model. Using this technique we find that the degree of MRO first increases on thermal annealing and then decreases before finally recrystallizing. We discuss this new result in the light of previous experimental studies and recent theoretical observations on the favorability of the paracrystalline (PC) model over the CRN in a-Si. At ion doses far above the minimum required to amorphize, a high defect density is found in the PC phase, which anneals out at 500oC. The PC structure after 500oC annealing is independent of the initial implantation conditions and appears to represent a metastable and highly-ordered structure. Higher-temperature annealing causes a reduction in the degree of MRO and the structure approaches but does not reach a fully continuous random network before eventually crystallizing above 600oC. The effect of high dose implantation is to increase the defect density in the as-implanted state and the annealing of these defects is likely responsible for the large characteristic heat evolution at low temperature.

Title: Creation of a degenerate Bose-Bose mixture of erbium and lithium atoms
Authors: Jasmine Kalia, Jared Rivera, Rubaiya R Emran, William J Solorio Hernandez, Kiryang Kwon, Richard J Fletcher
Abstract: We report the realization of a degenerate mixture of $^{166}$Er and $^{7}$Li atoms in their lowest spin state. The two species are sequentially laser-cooled and loaded into an optical dipole trap, then transported to a glass cell in which further cooling to degeneracy occurs. Since Er is more weakly trapped, it serves as a coolant for Li, and we observe efficient sympathetic cooling facilitated by a large interspecies elastic scattering cross section. Three-body losses are found to be small at the magnetic fields explored, making this platform promising for the study of interacting mixtures with large mass imbalance.

Title: 1D Transition Metal Oxide Chains as a Challenging Model for Ab Initio Calculations
Authors: Jila Amini, Mojtaba Alaei, Stefano de Gironcoli
Abstract: Providing highly simplified models of strongly correlated electronic systems that challenge {\it ab initio} calculations can serve as a valuable testing ground to improve these methods. In this study, we present a comprehensive study of the structural, magnetic, and electronic properties of one-dimensional transition metal mono-oxide chains (VO, CrO, MnO, FeO, CoO, and NiO) using density functional theory (DFT), DFT+$U$, and coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) calculations. The Hubbard $U$ parameter for DFT+$U$ is determined using the linear response theory. In all systems studied except MnO, the presence of multiple local minima -- primarily due to the electronic degrees of freedom associated with the d-orbitals -- leads to significant challenges for DFT, DFT+U, and Hartree-Fock methods in finding the global minimum in ab initio calculations. Our results indicate that the antiferromagnetic (AFM) state is energetically favored for all chains, except CrO, when using DFT+$U$ and PBE. We analyze the electronic band structures and find that while the PBE approximation often predicts metallic or half-metallic ground states for the ferromagnetic (FM) state, DFT+$U$ approach successfully opens band gaps, correctly predicting insulating behavior in all cases. Furthermore, we compared the energy differences between the AFM and FM states using DFT+$U$ and CCSD for CrO, MnO, FeO, CoO and NiO. Our findings indicate that CCSD predicts larger energy differences in some cases compared to DFT+$U$, suggesting that the Hubbard $U$ parameter obtained through linear response theory may be overestimated when used to calculate energy differences between different magnetic states. For CrO, CCSD predicts an AFM ground state, in contrast to the predictions from DFT+$U$ and PBE methods.

Title: A higher dimensional generalization of the Kitaev spin liquid
Authors: Po-Jui Chen, Piers Coleman
Abstract: We construct an exactly solvable model of a four-dimensional Kitaev spin liquid. The lattice structure is orthorhombic and each unit-cell contains six sublattice degrees of freedom. We demonstrate that the Fermi surface of the model is made up of two-dimensional surfaces. Additionally, we evaluate the energy cost of creating visons using scattering theory. The positive bond-flip energy suggests that the system's ground state is flux-free, similar to the two-dimensional Kitaev honeycomb model. Our model sheds light on the realization of high-dimensional fractionalization. high-dimensional fractionalization.

Title: Low Spontaneous Brillouin Scattering in Anti-Resonant Hollow-Core Fibers in GHz Frequency Range
Authors: Ryan E. Dunagin, Robbie Mears, Dario Bueno-Baques, Vasyl S. Tyberkevych, Yi Li, William J. Wadsworth, Zbigniew Celinski, Valentine Novosad, Dmytro A. Bozhko
Abstract: Brillouin light scattering (BLS) is a powerful experimental tool that can be used to get insights into the fundamental and applied properties of matter, like dispersions of quasiparticles in a solid, as well as their spatio-temporal dynamics. Many applications of light scattering favor the use of optical fibers in place of free-space optics. In this work, we compare the performance of anti-resonant hollow core fibers to that of conventional solid core fused silica fibers for BLS experiments in the GHz frequency range. Conventional fibers are barely suitable for low-noise measurements because of the spontaneous scattering of the photons on various phononic modes present in the core and cladding. In the case of the hollow-core fiber, we identify a range of discrete phononic modes and associate them with the various acoustic modes of the structure surrounding the hollow core using finite-element numerical simulations. The measured relative intensity of the spontaneous BLS signal from these modes is orders of magnitude smaller than that of a solid-core fiber, making anti-resonant hollow-core fibers one of the best solutions for the single-mode light guidance for BLS and potentially other low-noise photonic experiments.

Title: Influence of X-ray Irradiation on the Magnetic and Structural Properties of Gadolinium Silicide Nanoparticles for Self-Regulating Hyperthermia
Authors: Samantha E. Smith, Santiago Bermudez, Pavan Chaitanya, Zoe Boekelheide, Jessika Rojas Marin, Ravi L. Hadimani
Abstract: Magnetic hyperthermia treatment (MHT) utilizes heat generated from magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) under an alternating magnetic field (AMF) for therapeutic applications. Gadolinium silicide (Gd5Si4) has emerged as a promising MHT candidate due to its self-regulating heating properties and potential biocompatibility. However, the impact of high-dose X-ray irradiation on its magnetic behavior remains uncertain. This study examines Gd5Si4 nanoparticles exposed to 36 and 72 kGy X-ray irradiation at a high-dose rate (120 Gy/min). While X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and energy dispersive spectroscopy confirm no structural or compositional changes, transmission electron microscopy reveals localized lattice distortions, along with observable changes in magnetic properties, as evidenced in magnetization vs. temperature and hysteresis measurements. Despite this, magnetocaloric properties and specific loss power (SLP) remain unaffected. Our findings confirm the stability of Gd5Si4 under high-dose X-ray irradiation, supporting its potential for radiotherapy (RT) and magnetocaloric cooling in deep-space applications.

Title: Theory of terahertz pulse transmission through ferroelectric nanomembranes
Authors: Yujie Zhu, Aiden Ross, Xiangwei Guo, Venkatraman Gopalan, Long-Qing Chen, Jia-Mian Hu
Abstract: An analytical model is developed to predict the temporal evolution of the lattice polarization in ferroelectric nanomembranes upon the excitation by a terahertz (THz) electromagnetic pulse of an arbitrary waveform, and the concurrent transmission of the THz pulse in both the linear and the nonlinear regimes. It involves the use of the perturbation method to solve the equation of motion for the lattice polarization in both unclamped and strained ferroelectric nanomembranes within the framework of Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire theory. The model is applicable to perovskite oxides such as BaTiO3 and SrTiO3, wurtzite Al1-xScxN, and trigonal LiNbO3. Our analytical model provides a theoretical basis for determining the thermodynamic and kinetic parameters of ferroelectric materials through THz transmission experiment. The calculation results also suggest an approach to reversing the chirality of a circularly polarized THz pulse by harnessing the resonant polarization-photon coupling in ferroelectrics. This capability of chirality reversal, along with the high tunability from a strain applied along any arbitrarily oriented in-plane axis, provides new opportunities for THz wave modulation without relying on complex metasurface designs.

Title: Huge anisotropic magneto-thermal switching in high-purity polycrystalline compensated metals
Authors: Poonam Rani, Yuto Watanabe, Takuma Shiga, Yuya Sakuraba, Hikaru Takeda, Minoru Yamashita, Ken-ichi Uchida, Aichi Yamashita, Yoshikazu Mizuguchi
Abstract: Magneto-thermal transport is a promising physical property for thermal management applications. Magneto-thermal switching enables active control of heat flows, and a high switching ratio is desirable for improving performance. Here, we report on the observation of a huge magneto-thermal switching (MTS) effect in high-purity (5N) Pb polycrystalline wires, where magnetic fields perpendicular to the heat current direction are applied at low temperatures. At T = 3 K and B = 0.1 T, the measured thermal conductivity (\k{appa}) of the Pb wire is about 2500 W m-1 K-1 but is reduced to ~150 and ~5 W m-1 K-1 at B = 1 and 9 T, respectively. This strong suppression is attributed to magnetoresistance in compensated metals. Although the huge magnetoresistance has been studied in single crystals with field along the selected orbitals, our results demonstrate that a huge MTS can similarly be realized even in flexible polycrystalline wires. This finding highlights the practical potential of magneto-thermal control in low-temperature thermal management, including applications in space environments where temperatures are around 3 K.

Title: Resonant interlayer coupling in NbSe$_2$-graphite epitaxial moir{é} superlattices
Authors: S. Mo, K. Kovalenka, S. Buchberger, B.K. Saika, A. Azhar, A. Rajan, A. Zivanovic, Y.-C. Yao, R.V. Belosludov, M.D. Watson, M.S. Bahramy, P.D.C. King
Abstract: Moir{é} heterostructures, created by stacking two-dimensional (2D) materials together with a finite lattice mismatch or rotational twist, represent a new frontier of designer quantum materials. Typically, however, this requires the painstaking manual assembly of heterostructures formed from exfoliated materials. Here, we observe clear spectroscopic signatures of moir{é} lattice formation in epitaxial heterostructures of monolayer (ML) NbSe$_2$ grown on graphite substrates. Our angle-resolved photoemission measurements and theoretical calculations of the resulting electronic structure reveal moir{é} replicas of the graphite $\pi$ states forming pairs of interlocking Dirac cones. Interestingly, these intersect the NbSe$_2$ Fermi surface at the $\mathbf{k}$-space locations where NbSe$_2$'s charge-density wave (CDW) gap is maximal in the bulk. This provides a natural route to understand the lack of CDW enhancement for ML-NbSe$_2$/graphene as compared to a more than four-fold enhancement for NbSe$_2$ on insulating support substrates, and opens new prospects for using moir{é} engineering for controlling the collective states of 2D materials.

Title: Topological phase control in Mn1-xGexBi2Te4 via spin-orbit coupling and magnetic configuration engineering
Authors: A.M. Shikin, N.L. Zaitsev, A.V. Eryzhenkov, R.V. Makeev, T.P. Estyunina, D.A. Estyunin, A.V. Tarasov
Abstract: Magnetic topological systems based on MnBi2Te4 have recently attracted significant attention due to their rich interplay between magnetism and topological electronic states. In this work, using density functional theory (DFT), we investigate topological phase transitions (TPTs) in Mn1-xGexBi2Te4 compounds with both ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering under variations of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) strength and uniaxial strain along the c axis. We show that the emergence of a Weyl semimetal (WSM) phase requires the crossing of bands with opposite sz spin projections along the {\Gamma}Z direction. Modulation of SOC and strain can annihilate Weyl points via spin-selective hybridization, driving transitions into trivial or topological insulating phases. Furthermore, we demonstrate that local asymmetry in Mn/Ge substitution, particularly at 37.5% Ge concentration (Mn0.625Ge0.375Bi2Te4) can locally disrupt AFM interlayer coupling and induce a WSM state even in globally AFM systems, without external remagnetization. To optimize Weyl point separation and enhance the anomalous Hall effect (AHE), we propose partial substitution of Mn by Fe and Te by Se.

Title: Complete universal scaling of first-order phase transitions in the two-dimensional Ising model
Authors: Yuxiang Zhang, Fan Zhong
Abstract: Phase transitions, as one of the most intriguing phenomena in nature, are divided into first-order phase transitions (FOPTs) and continuous ones in current classification. While the latter shows striking phenomena of scaling and universality, the former has recently also been demonstrated to exhibit scaling and universal behavior within a mesoscopic, coarse-grained Landau-Ginzburg theory. Here we apply this theory to a microscopic model -- the paradigmatic Ising model, which undergoes FOPTs between two ordered phases below its critical temperature -- and unambiguously demonstrate universal scaling behavior in such FOPTs. These results open the door for extending the theory to other microscopic FOPT systems and experimentally testing them to systematically uncover their scaling and universal behavior.

Title: Magnetic interactions as a pivotal determinant in stabilizing a novel AgIIAgIIIF5 polymorph with high spin AgIII
Authors: Daniel Jezierski, Wojciech Grochala
Abstract: Based on theoretical calculations, we introduce a new AgIIAgIIIF5 monoclinic polymorph with a rare high spin AgIII. Our analysis of the experimental xray diffraction data available in the literature reveals that this polymorph was likely prepared in the past in a mixture with the triclinic form of the same compound. Theoretical calculations reproduce very well the lattice parameters of both forms. Calculations suggest that under ambient conditions, the monoclinic form is the more energetically stable phase of Ag2F5. We predict a strong one-dimensional antiferromagnetic superexchange between silver cations of different valences with superexchange constant of minus 207 meV (hybrid functional result). The polymorph with high spin AgIII owes its stability over the one with low spin AgIII, to these magnetic interactions.

Title: Ab-initio Study of Structural, Magnetic, Optoelectronic and Thermo-Physical Properties of HoPdBi Half-Heusler Semimetal
Authors: Tanvir Khan, F. Parvin, S. H. Naqib
Abstract: In this investigation, we have used the density functional theory (DFT) to investigate several aspects of the half-Heusler compound HoPdBi. The following properties have been studied: spin polarized electronic properties, magnetic moment, phonon dispersion with phonon density of states, structural, elastic properties, optical characteristics, and thermo-physical features. The calculated unit cell volume and ground-state lattice characteristics closely match the experimental results. This study is the first to examine the optoelectronic, thermo-physical, and elastic characteristics of HoPdBi. The mechanical stability requirements were met by the calculated elastic constants. The compound's ductility is shown by the estimated Pugh's ratio, Poisson's ratio, and Cauchy pressure. Band structures and electronic energy density of states have been evaluated in order to better understand the magnetic features with spin polarization. Band structure simulations were conducted with and without the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effect in order to look into any topological signature. The electrical band structure of the compound shows semi-metallic properties. The reflectivity, absorption coefficient, refractive index, dielectric function, optical conductivity, and loss function of this semi-metal have all been thoroughly examined. The compound is a good reflector in infrared region and a good absorber of ultraviolet (UV) light. This compound is a suitable candidate for high temperature applications and possesses potential as heat sink because of its high melting point and thermal conductivity. It is also suitable for spintronics applications. The majority of this study's findings are completely novel.

Title: Potassium Decoration on Graphenyldiene Monolayer for Advanced Reversible Hydrogen Storage
Authors: Jose A. S. Laranjeira, Nicolas F. Martins, Kleuton A. L. Lima, Bill. D. Aparicio-Huacarpuma, Luiz A. Ribeiro Junior, Xihao Chen, Douglas S. Galvao, Julio R. Sambrano
Abstract: Potassium-decorated graphenyldiene (K@GPD) is investigated as a promising two-dimensional material for reversible hydrogen storage using first-principles density functional theory calculations. Potassium atoms bind strongly to the GPD monolayer, and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations confirm the thermal stability of the functionalized system at 300 K. Hydrogen adsorption energies range from -0.11 to -0.14 eV per H$_2$, denoting reversible storage. At full coverage (18 H$_2$ molecules), the system reaches a storage capacity of 8.82 wt\%, exceeding the U.S. DOE target. AIMD simulations reveal spontaneous H$_2$ desorption at ambient temperature, demonstrating excellent reversibility.

Title: TPHE-Graphene: A First-Principles Study of a New 2D Carbon Allotrope for Hydrogen Storage
Authors: José A. S. Laranjeira, Nicolas F. Martins, Kleuton A. L. Lima, Luis A. Cabral, Luiz A. Ribeiro, Douglas S. Galvão, Julio R. Sambrano
Abstract: The shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources is essential for reducing global carbon emissions and addressing climate change. Developing advanced materials for efficient hydrogen storage enables sustainable energy solutions in this context. Herein, we propose sodium-decorated TPHE-graphene as a high-performance two-dimensional material for hydrogen storage. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that TPHE-graphene exhibits dynamical, thermal, energetic, and mechanical stability, as confirmed by cohesive energy, phonon dispersion, and molecular dynamics simulations. The monolayer displays metallic behavior and a high Young's modulus of 250.46 N/m. Upon sodium decoration, strong chemisorption occurs with a binding energy of -2.08 eV and minimal tendency for Na atom clustering. Hydrogen adsorption analysis reveals that each Na atom can bind up to five H$_2$ molecules, resulting in a gravimetric storage capacity of 9.52 wt\%. The calculated H$_2$ adsorption energies range from -0.22 eV to -0.18 eV, falling within the ideal range for reversible adsorption under ambient conditions. These findings highlight Na-decorated TPHE-graphene as a structurally robust and efficient hydrogen storage material well-suited for future green energy applications.

Title: Robust Charge-Density Wave Correlations in Optimally-Doped YBa2Cu3Oy
Authors: Rui Zhou, Igor Vinograd, Hadrien Mayffre, Juan Porras, Hun-Ho Kim, Toshinao Loew, Yiran Liu, Matthieu Le Tacon, Bernhard Keimer, Marc-Henri Julien
Abstract: Charge-density wave (CDW) order is a key property of high-Tc cuprates, but its boundaries in the phase diagram and potential connections to other phases remain controversial. We report nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements in the prototypical cuprate YBa2Cu3Oy demonstrating that short-range static CDW order remains robust at optimal doping (p=0.165), exhibiting a strength and temperature dependence in the normal state similar to those observed at p=0.11 in the underdoped regime. For an overdoped sample with p=0.184, we detect no static CDW down to T=Tc, though weak CDW order plausibly emerges below Tc. More broadly, we argue that both quenched disorder and competition with superconductivity influence the apparent boundary of the CDW phase, likely causing an underestimation of its intrinsic extent in doping. These findings challenge the view that the CDW phase boundary lies below p*=0.19, widely regarded as the critical doping where the pseudogap phase ends in YBa2Cu3Oy.

Title: Molecular dynamics simulation of the effects of neutron irradiation on Caesium Lead Bromide
Authors: Zhongming Zhang, Samuel Murphy, Michael Aspinall
Abstract: With the development of fast neutron reactors and nuclear fusion reactors, it is necessary to find new radiation-hardened high-flux core neutron detectors. The use of perovskite Caesium Lead Bromide (CsPbBr$_3$) for neutron radiation detection is a new research direction. However, at high temperatures, the effects of neutron radiation, especially the Primary Knock-out Atom (PKA) and Displacement Per Atom (DPA), and the defect distribution at the molecular level have not been reported. This study investigated the effect on CsPbBr$_3$ produced by 14 MeV neutron irradiation under 100 K to 400 K. Molecular dynamics methods are used to model the distribution of vacancies and interstitial atoms at the molecular level of materials. This study obtained the displacement threshold energies of three atoms in CsPbBr$_3$ and obtained the distribution of vacancies and interstitial atoms within the material over time. Monte Carlo simulations were used to obtain PKA and DPA information in CsPbBr$_3$ under neutron irradiation. This research will help to further study the performance changes of halide perovskites under neutron irradiation to verify the possibility of using them as radiation-hardened neutron detectors.

Abstract: Owing to the fact that, in the particular case of non-relativistic mono-atomic gases, the particle current operator is proportional to the operator of the total momentum, the particle transport in such systems is always ballistic and fully characterized by a Drude weight $\Delta$. The Drude weight can be calculated as a generalized susceptibility from a generalized Gibbs ensemble. For the case of the integrable one dimensional Bose gas with contact interactions this susceptibility can be obtained exactly and explicitly from a generalized Yang-Yang thermodynamic formalism. The result is temperature independent and given by $\Delta = 2 \pi D = 2 k_F$, where $D$ is the density of the gas and $k_F$ its Fermi momentum. Our expression, derived by first principle calculations, confirms a more involved formula obtained heuristically by means of generalized hydrodynamics.

Title: Observation of pseudogap in Cr_{1-x}Y_xN magnetic alloy and its impact on the Seebeck coefficient by ab-initio calculations
Authors: Luis Felipe Leon-Pinzon, Elisabeth Restrepo-Parra, Andres Manuel Garay-Tapia
Abstract: Thermoelectric materials require high electronic conductivity and low thermal conductivity. CrN has been shown to have low phononic thermal conductivity, making it a potential candidate for thermoelectric applications. In addition, similarities have been observed between YN and ScN suggesting that the CrYN alloy may have interesting thermoelectric properties. As CrYN has not been studied in detail at the level of thermoelectric properties, the first study on CrYN alloy of Seebeck coefficient and zT figure of merit is proposed in this study. For this purpose, cubic special quasirandom structures were constructed at values of x = 0.25, 0.5 and 0.75 in the alloy Cr_{1-x}Y_xN starting from different magnetic structures. After analyzing lattice parameters, Cr magnetic moments, octahedron deformation, second neighbors distribution around metals, density of states and band structures, it was concluded that to obtain high values of Seebeck coefficient and zT, it is necessary the presence of a pseudo gap in both spin channels and it is also necessary that the Fermi level is on a steep decreasing slope of number of states, since due to Motts approximation, the value of this slope is proportional to the Seebeck coefficient. Density of states of all the structures shows a metallic behavior. In structures with x=0.5, the presence of small indirect energy gaps is observed. Although no structure retains the initial magnetic configuration, there is a possible influence of this on the electronic structure. Considerable deformations in octahedra can suppress thermoelectric properties.

Title: Effect of crystallinity on the frictional and wear performance of molybdenum disulfide: A molecular dynamics study
Authors: Abhiram B R, Ilia Ponomarev, Tomas Polcar
Abstract: The frictional and wear performance of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is significantly influenced by its intrinsic arrangement of crystals or crystallinity. In this study, we investigate the effect of crystallinty on coefficient of friction (COF) and wear in MoS2 using a suite of reactive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. A range of configurations, from amorphous to crystalline, is modeled to capture the effect of structural order on the tribological behavior. To study friction and wear, we simulate the sliding of a spherical rigid carbon body over the MoS2 surface under varying crystallinity conditions. Our results reveal a pronounced reduction in COF with decreasing crystallinity, with crystalline MoS2 exhibiting superlubricity. This behavior is attributed to the preservation of a flat sliding surface and frictional anisotropy, which enables lateral movement along low-resistance paths. In contrast, amorphous and polycrystalline MoS2 with lower degrees of crystallinity displays a substantially higher COF, driven by increased surface roughness and atomic-scale energy dissipation. Furthermore, we examine the wear mechanisms under high normal loads, demonstrating that crystallinity enhances wear resistance by mitigating material deformation. These findings provide atomic-scale insights into the tribological performance of MoS2, emphasizing the critical role of structural order in achieving ultralow friction. Our work corroborates with previous studies on superlubricity in MoS2 and extends this understanding to rigid-body sliding conditions, offering valuable implications for designing low-friction and wear resistant solid lubricants.

Title: High-Efficiency, High-Fidelity Charge Initialization of Shallow Nitrogen Vacancy Centers in Diamond
Authors: Marjana Mahdia, Artur Lozovoi, Jared Rovny, Zhiyang Yuan, Carlos A. Meriles, Nathalie P. de Leon
Abstract: Nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond exhibit long spin coherence times, optical initialization, and optical spin readout under ambient conditions, making them excellent quantum sensors. However, the conventional scheme for charge state initialization based on off-resonant green excitation results in significant state preparation errors, typically around 30%. One method for improving charge state initialization fidelity is to use multicolor excitation, which has been demonstrated to achieve a near-unity preparation fidelity for bulk NV centers by using a few milliseconds of near-infrared (5 mW) and green (10 {\mu}W) excitation. The translation of such schemes to NV centers near the diamond surface with higher efficiency optical pumping would enable myriad tasks in nanoscale sensing. Here, we demonstrate a protocol for efficient charge initialization of shallow NV centers between 5 nm and 15 nm from the diamond surface. By carefully studying the charge dynamics of shallow NV centers, we identify a region of parameter space that allows for near-unity (95%) charge initialization within 300 {\mu}s of near-infrared (1 mW) and green (10 {\mu}W) excitation. The time to 90% charge initialization can be as fast as 10 {\mu}s for 4 mW of near-infrared and 39 {\mu}W of green illumination. This fast, efficient charge initialization protocol will enable nanoscale sensing applications where state preparation errors currently prohibit scaling, such as measuring higher-order multi-point correlators.

Title: A Foundation Model for Non-Destructive Defect Identification from Vibrational Spectra
Authors: Mouyang Cheng, Chu-Liang Fu, Bowen Yu, Eunbi Rha, Abhijatmedhi Chotrattanapituk, Douglas L Abernathy, Yongqiang Cheng, Mingda Li
Abstract: Defects are ubiquitous in solids and strongly influence materials' mechanical and functional properties. However, non-destructive characterization and quantification of defects, especially when multiple types coexist, remain a long-standing challenge. Here we introduce DefectNet, a foundation machine learning model that predicts the chemical identity and concentration of substitutional point defects with multiple coexisting elements directly from vibrational spectra, specifically phonon density-of-states (PDoS). Trained on over 16,000 simulated spectra from 2,000 semiconductors, DefectNet employs a tailored attention mechanism to identify up to six distinct defect elements at concentrations ranging from 0.2% to 25%. The model generalizes well to unseen crystals across 56 elements and can be fine-tuned on experimental data. Validation using inelastic scattering measurements of SiGe alloys and MgB$_2$ superconductor demonstrates its accuracy and transferability. Our work establishes vibrational spectroscopy as a viable, non-destructive probe for point defect quantification in bulk materials, and highlights the promise of foundation models in data-driven defect engineering.

Title: Cubic BeB$_2$: A metastable $p$-type conductive material from first principles
Authors: Xiao Zhang, Shashi Mishra, Elena R. Margine, Emmanouil Kioupakis
Abstract: Boron forms a wide variety of compounds with alkaline earth elements due to its unique bonding characteristics. Among these, binary compounds of Be and B display particularly rich structural diversity, attributed to the small atomic size of Be. Cubic BeB$_2$ is a particularly interesting phase, where Be donates electrons to stabilize a diamond-like boron network under high pressure. In this work, we employ \textit{ab initio} methods to conduct a detailed investigation of cubic BeB$_2$ and its functional properties. We show that this metastable phase is dynamically stable under ambient conditions, and its lattice match to existing substrate materials suggests possible epitaxial stabilization via thin-film growth routes. Through a comprehensive characterization of its electronic, transport, and superconductivity properties, we demonstrate that cubic BeB$_2$ exhibits high hole concentrations and high hole mobility, making it a potential candidate for efficient $p$-type transport. In addition, cubic BeB$_2$ is found to exhibit low-temperature superconductivity at degenerate doping levels, similar to several other doped covalent semiconductors such as diamond, Si, and SiC.

Title: Anomalous magnetic response in the Au-Al-Gd 1/1 quasicrystal approximant
Authors: Takafumi D. Yamamoto, Tasuku Watanae, Farid Labib, Asuka Ishikawa, Shintaro Suzuki, Ryuji Tamura
Abstract: The magnetic response of the Tsai-type 1/1 Au-Al-Gd approximant crystals (ACs) was quantitatively investigated in terms of the magnetic entropy change ($\Delta S_{M}$) for different magnetic ground states. A comprehensive $\Delta S_{M}$ map over a wide electron concentration range has been established, demonstrating the detailed variation of $\Delta S_{M}$ across the entire magnetic phase diagram in the Tsai-type 1/1 ACs. Near the boundaries of the ferromagnetic (FM) phase, a clear deviation from the mean-field theory (MFT) was observed in both the Curie temperature ($T_{C}$) and magnetic field ($H$) dependences of the maximum magnetic entropy change ($\Delta S_{M}^{max}$). Contrary to general expectations, a high $\Delta S_{M}^{max}$ (7.2 J/K mol-Gd under a 5 T field variation), even comparable to those of candidate materials for low-temperature magnetic refrigeration, was obtained within the antiferromagnetic (AFM) region near the FM / AFM phase boundary. The unexpected enhancement of $\Delta S_{M}^{max}$ toward the AFM region under high magnetic fields indicates an anomalous magnetic response in the present Tsai-type 1/1 AC, which is presumably associated with the breakdown of the MFT. The present finding suggests that tuning the magnetic ground state across the phase boundary is an effective strategy to enhance $\Delta S_{M}$, even in general rare-earth intermetallic compounds.

Title: Hole clustering and mutual interplay in three-band Hubbard model
Authors: Mi Jiang, Yi-feng Yang, Guang-Ming Zhang
Abstract: Recent scanning tunnelling spectroscopy (STS) experiments revealed remarkable role of a supercell consisting $4\times4$ CuO$_2$ unit cells in the emergence of local nematic state and preformed local Cooper pairs and phase coherent cuprate superconductivity. By employing the numerically exact determinant Quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we mimic the effects of experimental Ca vacancy by an external local potential to investigate the charge and spectral properties of the system hosting two doped holes. The model numerically support the role of the $4\times4$ supercell as the building block of hole doped cuprates via the hole density distribution and local spectra around the local potential. Our results might provide a theoretical support on the experimental observations and a platform for investigating local charge order and local Cooper pairs on the $4\times4$ supercell as the plausible route to understanding unconventional cuprate superconductivity.

Title: Fröhlich Condensation of Bosons: Graph texture of curl flux network for nonequilibrium properties
Authors: Feihong Liu, Chase Slowey, Xuanhua Wang, Dangyuan Lei, Zhiyue Lu, Zhedong Zhang
Abstract: Nonequilibrium condensates of bosons subject to energy pump and dissipation are investigated, manifesting the Fröhlich coherence proposed in 1968. A quantum theory is developed to capture such a nonequilibrium nature, yielding a certain graphic structure arising from the detailed-balance breaking. The results show a network of probability curl fluxes that reveals a graph topology. The winding number associated with the flux network is thus identified as a new order parameter for the phase transition towards the Fröhlich condensation (FC), not attainable by the symmetry breaking. Our work demonstrates a global property of the FCs, in conjunction with the coherence of cavity polaritons that may exhibit robust cooperative phases driven far from equilibrium.

Title: New universality classes and BKT transition in the vortex lattice phases of Kagome Ice
Authors: Wei Zhang, Wanzhou Zhang, Jie Zhang, Chengxiang Ding, Youjin Deng
Abstract: Inspired by the experimental realization of direct Kagome spin ice [arXiv:2404.19377], the theoretical six-vertex model on the Kagome lattice is systematically simulated using the directed loop Monte Carlo method. Four distinct vortex lattice phases are identified: (i) Ferromagnetic leg states and vortex lattice order on both triangular and honeycomb faces, with a winding number $ k = 1 $. (ii) Antiferromagnetic leg states and vortex lattice order on both types of faces, with $ k = -2 $ on the honeycomb faces and $ k = 1 $ on the triangular faces. (iii) Paramagnetic leg states and vortex lattice order on the triangular faces with $ k = 1 $. (iv) Paramagnetic leg states and vortex lattice order on the honeycomb faces with $ k = 1 $. As for ferromagnetic to different types of magnetic disorder phase, besides the Ising universality class with $ y_t = 1 $, a new critical exponent $ y_t = 1.317(6) $ has also been found. The transition between the third and fourth types of vortex lattice phases occurs with the new exponent $y_t=1.340(3)$. The third and fourth types of the vortex lattice phase to the vortex disorder phase are found to be of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless type. These findings contribute to the search for and understanding of ice on complex lattices.

Title: A network of parametrically driven silicon nitride mechanical membranes
Authors: Luis Mestre, Suyash Singh, Gabriel Margiani, Letizia Catalini, Alexander Eichler, Vincent Dumont
Abstract: Networks of nonlinear resonators offer a promising platform for analog computing and the emulation of complex systems. However, realizing such networks remains challenging, as it requires resonators with high quality factors, individual frequency tunability, and strong inter-resonator coupling. In this work, we present a system that meets all these criteria. Our system is based on metallized silicon nitride membranes that are coupled via their common substrate and controlled capacitively via electrodes. We demonstrate individual frequency tuning and strong parametric driving of each membrane. Notably, we tune membrane frequencies through avoided crossings and demonstrate tunability of the coupled membrane's parametric response. This platform provides a scalable and controllable setting for exploring collective phenomena, dynamical phase transitions, nonlinear topology, and analog computing.

Title: Dynamical Properties of Dense Associative Memory
Authors: Kazushi Mimura, Jun'ichi Takeuchi, Yuto Sumikawa, Yoshiyuki Kabashima, Anthony C. C. Coolen
Abstract: The dense associative memory is one of the basic modern Hopfield networks and can store large numbers of memory patterns. While the stationary state storage capacity has been investigated so far, its dynamical properties have not been discussed. In this paper, we analyze the dynamics by means of an exact approach based on generating functional analysis. It allows us to investigate convergence properties as well as the size of the attraction basins. We also analyze the stationary state of the updating rule.

Title: Observation of universal topological magnetoelectric switching in multiferroic GdMn2O5
Authors: Haowen Wang, Fan Wang, Ming Yang, Yuting Chang, Mengyi Shi, Liang Li, Jun-Ming Liu, Junfeng Wang, Shuai Dong, Chengliang Lu
Abstract: Topological magnetoelectricity was recently revealed as an emergent topic, which opens a unique route to precisely control magnetoelectric functionality. Here we report the synchronous magnetic-electric-cycle operation of topological magnetoelectric switching in GdMn2O5. Compared with pure magnetic-cycle operation, this topological winding can be accessed in a much broader parameter space, i.e. orientation of magnetic field is not limited to the magic angle and the effect can persist up to the Curie temperature. The fine tuning of free energy landscape is responsible to this topological behavior.

Title: Hybrid scaling mechanism of critical behavior in the overlapping critical regions of classical and quantum Yang-Lee edge singularities
Authors: Yue-Mei Sun, Wen-Jing Yu, Xin-Yu Wang, Liang-Jun Zhai
Abstract: Recently, the study of scaling behavior in Yang-Lee edge singularities (YLES) has attracted sustained attention. However, the scaling mechanism for the overlapping critical region between classical and quantum YLES remains unclear. In this work, we investigate this question, and a hybrid scaling mechanism is introduced to characterize the scaling behavior in the overlapping regions. The hybrid scaling mechanism asserts that in the overlapping region the scaling behavior can be described by the scaling function for both critical regions simultaneously, and it results in a constraint on the scaling functions. The transverse Ising chain in an imaginary longitudinal field, which exhibits $(0+1)$ dimensional (D) and $(1+1)$ D quantum YLES phase transitions at zero temperature, and $(0+0)$ D and $(1+0)$ D classical YLES phase transitions at finite temperature, is employed as a model to test this hybrid scaling mechanism. The scaling functions in the critical regions of $(0+1)$ D and $(1+1)$ D quantum YLES as well as $(0+0)$ D and $(1+0)$ D classical YLES of such model are systematically investigated. Furthermore, the hybrid scaling mechanisms in overlapping critical regions, particularly between classical and quantum YLES, are thoroughly examined. Through this study, we have established a scaling mechanism capable of describing behaviors in the overlapping critical regions between classical and quantum phase transitions, which also facilitates the extraction of quantum phase transition information from classical phase transition systems.

Title: Anomalous current fluctuations and mobility-driven clustering
Authors: Tanmoy Chakraborty, Punyabrata Pradhan
Abstract: We study steady-state current fluctuations in hardcore lattice gases on a ring of $L$ sites, where $N$ particles perform symmetric, {\it extended-ranged} hopping. The hop length is a random variable depending on a length scale $l_0$ (hopping range) and the inter-particle gap. The systems have mass-conserving dynamics with global density $\rho = N/L$ fixed, but violate detailed balance. We consider two analytically tractable cases: (i) $l_0 = 2$ (finite-ranged) and (ii) $l_0 \to \infty$ (infinite-ranged); in the latter, the system undergoes a clustering or condensation transition below a critical density $\rho_c$. In the steady state, we compute, exactly within a closure scheme, the variance $\langle Q^2(T) \rangle_c = \langle Q^2(T) \rangle - \langle Q(T) \rangle^2$ of the cumulative (time-integrated) current $Q(T)$ across a bond $(i,i+1)$ over a time interval $[0, T]$. We show that for $l_0 \to \infty$, the scaled variance of the time-integrated bond current, or equivalently, the mobility diverges at $\rho_c$. That is, near criticality, the mobility $\chi(\rho) = \lim_{L \to \infty} [\lim_{T \to \infty} L \langle Q^2(T, L) \rangle_c / 2T] \sim (\rho - \rho_c)^{-1}$ has a simple-pole singularity, thus providing a dynamical characterization of the condensation transition, previously observed in a related mass aggregation model by Majumdar et al.\ [{\it Phys.\ Rev.\ Lett.\ {\bf 81}, 3691 (1998)}]. At the critical point $\rho = \rho_c$, the variance has a scaling form $\langle Q^2(T, L) \rangle_c = L^{\gamma} {\cal W}(T/L^{z})$ with $\gamma = 4/3$ and the dynamical exponent $z = 2$. Thus, near criticality, the mobility {\it diverges} while the diffusion coefficient remains {\it finite}, {\it unlike} in equilibrium systems with short-ranged hopping, where diffusion coefficient usually {\it vanishes} and mobility remains finite.

Title: Tunable Itinerant Ferromagnetism in the Two-Dimensional FePd$_2$Te$_2$ Hosting 1D Spin Chains
Authors: Alberto M. Ruiz, Andrei Shumilin, Sourav Dey, Diego López-Alcalá, José J.Baldoví
Abstract: One-dimensional (1D) magnetism offers unidirectional spin interactions that allow unique tunable properties and unconventional spin phenomena. However, it often suffers from poor stability, limiting practical applications. In this regard, integrating 1D magnetism into two-dimensional (2D) materials enables a promising route to stabilize these systems while preserving their anisotropic magnetic characteristics. Here, we focus on the 2D ferromagnet FePd$_2$Te$_2$ (T$_C$ = 183K), which hosts 1D spin chains and strong in-plane anisotropy. Our first-principles calculations reveal highly anisotropic magnetic exchange interactions, confirming its 1D ferromagnetic nature. We modulate this behavior by Co and Ni substitution and introduce two new members of this family, CoPd$_2$Te$_2$ -a ferromagnet- and NiPd$_2$Te$_2$. Our results unveil the microscopic mechanisms governing the behaviour of FePd$_2$Te$_2$ and CoPd$_2$Te$_2$. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that the variation of the chain length is key to modulate magnetism. Finally, we determine the magnon dispersion, showcasing a pronounced anisotropy that enables unidirectional magnon propagation.

Title: Direct probe of magnetic field effects on phonons by ultrasound propagation in a quasi-two-dimensional honeycomb magnet Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$
Authors: Xiaochen Hong, Maximilian Schiffer, Beat Valentin Schwarze, Marc Uhlarz, Xianghong Jin, Weiliang Yao, Lukas Janssen, Sergei Zherlitsyn, Bernd Büchner, Yuan Li, Young Sun, Christian Hess
Abstract: We study the phonon behavior of a Co-based honeycomb frustrated magnet Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$ under magnetic field applied perpendicular to the honeycomb plane. The temperature and field dependence of the sound velocity and sound attenuation unveil prominent spin-lattice coupling in this material, promoting ultrasound as a sensitive probe for magnetic properties. An out-of-plane ferrimagnetic order is determined below the Néel temperature $T_N=27$~K. A comprehensive analysis of our data further provides strong evidence for a triple-Q ground state of Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$. Furthermore, the ultrasound data underscore that the field impact on the thermal conductivity as recently reported is of pure phononic origin.

Title: Electrically tunable quantum interference of atomic spins on surfaces
Authors: Hao Wang, Jing Chen, Peng Fan, Yelko del Castillo, Alejandro Ferrón, Lili Jiang, Zilong Wu, Shijie Li, Hong-Jun Gao, Heng Fan, Joaquín Fernández-Rossier, Kai Yang
Abstract: Controlling quantum interference near avoided energy-level crossings is crucial for fast and reliable coherent manipulation in quantum information processing. However, achieving tunable quantum interference in atomically-precise engineered structures remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate electrical control of quantum interference using atomic spins on an insulating film in a scanning tunneling microscope. Using bias voltages applied across the tunnel junction, we modulate the atomically-confined magnetic interaction between the probe tip and surface atoms with a strong electric field, and drive the spin state rapidly through the energy-level anticrossing. This all-electrical manipulation allows us to achieve Landau-Zener-Stückelberg-Majorana (LZSM) interferometry on both single spins and pairs of interacting spins. The LZSM pattern exhibits multiphoton resonances, and its asymmetry suggests that the spin dynamics is influenced by spin-transfer torque of tunneling electrons. Multi-level LZSM spectra measured on coupled spins with tunable interactions show distinct interference patterns depending on their many-body energy landscapes. These results open new avenues for all-electrical quantum manipulation in spin-based quantum processors in the strongly driven regime.

Title: Missing link between the 2D Quantum Hall problem and 1D quasicrystals
Authors: Anuradha Jagannathan
Abstract: This paper discusses a connection between two important classes of materials, namely quasicrystals and topological insulators as exemplified by the Quantum Hall problem. It has been remarked that the quasicrystal ``inherits" topological properties from the 2D Quantum Hall model. We show this explicitly by introducing the Fibonacci-Hall model as a link between a 1D quasicrystal and the magnetic problems. We show here how Chern numbers for bands in periodic approximants of quasicrystals can be computed, along with gap labels. The Chern numbers are thus seen as a consequence of a flux parameter $\phi^S$ induced by the geometry of winding in 2D space of the quasicrystal. We show the existence of lines of Lifshitz transitions in the phase space of the model. These are marked by change of Chern number and disappearance of edge states. The proposed extrapolation method can be generalized to higher dimensional 2D and 3D quasicrystals, where higher order Chern numbers could be computed, and related to experimentally measurable transport quantities.

Title: Analogs of deconfined quantum criticality for non-invertible symmetry breaking in 1d
Authors: Yu-Hsueh Chen, Tarun Grover
Abstract: The spontaneous breaking of non-invertible symmetries can lead to exotic phenomena such as coexistence of order and disorder. Here we explore second-order phase transitions in 1d spin chains between two phases that correspond to distinct patterns of non-invertible symmetry breaking. The critical point shares several features with well-understood examples of deconfined quantum critical points, such as enlarged symmetry and identical exponents for the two order parameters participating in the transition. Interestingly, such deconfined transitions involving non-invertible symmetries allow one to construct a whole family of similar critical points by gauging spin-flip symmetries. By employing gauging and bosonization, we characterize the phase diagram of our model in the vicinity of the critical point. We also explore proximate phases and phase transitions in related models, including a deconfined quantum critical point between invertible order parameters that is enforced by a non-invertible symmetry.

Title: VO$_2$ oscillator circuits optimized for ultrafast, 100 MHz-range operation

Abstract: Oscillating neural networks are promising candidates for a new computational paradigm, where complex optimization problems are solved by physics itself through the synchronization of coupled oscillating circuits. Nanoscale VO$_2$ Mott memristors are particularly promising building blocks for such oscillating neural networks. Until now, however, not only the maximum frequency of VO$_2$ oscillating neural networks, but also the maximum frequency of individual VO$_2$ oscillators has been severely limited, which has restricted their efficient and energy-saving use. In this paper, we show how the oscillating frequency can be increased by more than an order of magnitude into the 100 MHz range by optimizing the sample layout and circuit layout. In addition, the physical limiting factors of the oscillation frequencies are studied by investigating the switching dynamics. To this end, we investigate how much the set and reset times slow down under oscillator conditions compared to the fastest switching achieved with single dedicated pulses. These results pave the way towards the realization of ultra-fast and energy-efficient VO$_2$-based oscillating neural networks.

Title: Direct determination of layer anomalous Hall conductivity using uniaxial Wannier functions
Authors: Yume Morishima, Fumiyuki Ishii, Naoya Yamaguchi
Abstract: We propose a method for computing layer anomalous Hall conductivity (LAHC) in real space by integrating the Fukui-Hatsugai-Suzuki method with hybrid Wannier functions localized along a single axis. To validate the method, we calculated the LAHC of axion-insulating MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ and confirmed the agreement between the sum of LAHC on the surface and the surface AHC previously reported. We further applied the method to antiferromagnetic Mn$_2$Bi$_2$Te$_5$ and examined the dependence on the magnetic structure of LAHC, identifying cases with and without axion insulating behavior. This layer-resolved analysis offers a powerful tool for studying topological transport in complex materials, including heterostructures, and may guide the design of future devices based on the anomalous Hall effect with precise layer control.

Title: Controlled Spherulitic Crystal Growth from Salt Mixtures: A Universal Mechanism for Complex Crystal Self-Assembly
Authors: Tess Heeremans, Simon Lépinay, Romane Le Dizès Castell, Isa Yusuf, Paul Kolpakov, Daniel Bonn, Michael Steiger, Noushine Shahidzadeh
Abstract: Spherulites are complex polycrystalline structures that form through the self-assembly of small aggregated nanocrystals starting from a central point and growing radially outward. Despite their wide prevalence and relevance to fields ranging from geology to medicine, the dynamics of spherulitic crystallization and the conditions required for such growth remain ill-understood. Here, we report on the conditions to induce controlled spherulitic growth of sodium sulfate from evaporating aqueous solutions of sulfate salt mixtures at room temperature. We reveal that introducing divalent metal ions in the solution cause spherulitic growth of sodium sulfate. For the first time, we quantify the supersaturation at the onset of spherulitic growth from salt mixtures and determine the growth kinetics. Our results show that the nonclassical nucleation process induces the growth of sodium sulfate spherulites at high supersaturation in highly viscous solutions. The latter reaches approximately 111 Pa$\cdot$s, triggered by the divalent ions, at the onset of spherulite precipitation leading to a diffusion limited growth. We also show that spherulites, which are metastable structures formed under out-of-equilibrium conditions, can evolve into other shapes when supersaturation decreases as growth continues at different evaporation rates. These findings shed light on the conditions under which spherulites form and offer practical strategies for tuning their morphology.

Title: Superstrate structured Sb$_2$S$_3$ thin-film solar cells by magnetron sputtering of Sb and post-sulfurization
Authors: Evgeniia Gilshtein, Harshvardhan Maheshkant Gupta, Andrea Maria Pierri Enevoldsen, Cristina Besleaga, Aurelian Catalin Galca, Stela Canulescu
Abstract: We report on the fabrication and optimization of semi-transparent antimony sulfide (Sb$_2$S$_3$) thin-film solar cells in a superstrate configuration, using RF magnetron sputtering of metallic antimony followed by post-deposition sulfurization. The influence of absorber and buffer layer thicknesses on device performance was systematically studied in FTO/CdS/Sb$_2$S$_3$/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au architectures. Optimizing the Sb$_2$S$_3$ absorber thickness to 100 nm yielded a champion device with a power conversion efficiency of 2.76\%, short-circuit current density of 14 mA/cm$^2$, and open-circuit voltage of 650 mV. The devices exhibit up to 20\% transmittance in the 380--740 nm wavelength range, indicating their suitability for indoor and building-integrated photovoltaic applications. Structural and compositional analyses confirmed high-purity Sb$_2$S$_3$ (more than 90 at.\%) and improved crystallinity after sulfurization. These results demonstrate the potential of sputtered Sb$_2$S$_3$ as a scalable and tunable absorber for emerging transparent thin-film solar technologies and highlight the critical role of thickness optimization and interface control in device performance.

Title: Hyperspherical Analysis of Dimer-Dimer Scattering in One-Dimensional Systems
Authors: Jia Wang, Hui Hu, Xia-Ji Liu
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of four-body scattering in one-dimensional (1D) quantum systems using the adiabatic hyperspherical representation (AHR). Focusing on dimer-dimer collisions between two species of fermions interacting via the sinh-cosh potential, we implement the slow variable discretization (SVD) method to overcome numerical challenges posed by sharp avoided crossings in the potential curves. Our numerical approach is benchmarked against exact analytical results available in integrable regimes, demonstrating excellent agreement. We further explore non-integrable regimes where no analytical solutions exist, revealing novel features such as resonant enhancement of the scattering length associated with tetramer formation. These results highlight the power and flexibility of the AHR+SVD framework for accurate few-body scattering calculations in low-dimensional quantum systems, and establish a foundation for future investigations of universal few-body physics in ultracold gases.

Title: Time inversion symmetry in the Dirac and Schrödinger-Pauli theories
Authors: R. Winkler, U. Zülicke
Abstract: The Schrödinger-Pauli theory is generally believed to give a faithful representation of the nonrelativistic and weakly relativistic limit of the Dirac theory. However, the Schrödinger-Pauli theory is fundamentally incomplete in its account of broken time inversion symmetry, e.g., in magnetically ordered systems. In the Dirac theory of the electron, magnetic order breaks time inversion symmetry even in the nonrelativistic limit, whereas time inversion symmetry is effectively preserved in the Schrödinger-Pauli theory in the absence of spin-orbit coupling. In the Dirac theory, the Berry curvature $1/(2m^2c^2)$ is thus an intrinsic property of nonrelativistic electrons similar to the well-known spin magnetic moment $e\hbar/(2m)$, while this result is missed by the nonrelativistic or weakly relativistic Schrödinger-Pauli equation. In ferromagnetically ordered systems, the intrinsic Berry curvature yields a contribution to the anomalous Hall conductivity independent of spin-orbit coupling.

Title: Adsorbate phase transitions on nanoclusters from nested sampling
Authors: Thanawitch Chatbipho, Ray Yang, Robert B. Wexler, Livia B. Pártay
Abstract: Nested sampling was employed to investigate adsorption equilibria on the truncated-octahedral Lennard-Jones nanocluster LJ$_{38}$ while systematically varying adsorbate-surface well depth and Lennard-Jones size parameters. Evaluation of the canonical partition function over a wide temperature range identifies two successive phase transitions: (i) condensation of the gas phase onto the cluster surface at higher temperatures, and (ii) lateral rearrangement of the adsorbed layer at lower temperatures. For identical interactions, the condensate first populates both three- and four-fold hollow sites; when adsorbate-adsorbate interactions are weakened, preference shifts to the four-coordinated (100) sites. Size mismatch governs low-temperature behavior: smaller adsorbates aggregate to increase mutual contacts, whereas larger ones distribute more evenly to maximize coordination with the cluster. These findings highlight key trends in facet competition and lattice mismatch, and showcase nested sampling as an automated, unbiased tool for exploring surface configurational space and guiding investigations of more complex, realistic interfaces.

Title: Visualization of Co-3d high- and low-spin states in an Ising spin chain magnet
Authors: Kamini Gautam, Shunsuke Kitou, Yuiga Nakamura, Arvind Kumar Yogi, Dinesh Kumar Shukla, Taka-hisa Arima
Abstract: Properties of trivalent cobalt oxide compounds are largely influenced by the spin state of the six 3d electrons at each Co site. High-spin Co3+ ions, where orbital angular momentum is only partially quenched, often exhibit significant anisotropy, providing playgrounds for Ising spin systems. However, real-space observations of their orbital states have remained limited. Here, we determine the Co-3d spin and orbital states in an Ising spin chain magnet Ca3Co2O6, where high- and low-spin states alternate along the chain. Synchrotron X-ray diffraction and valence electron density (VED) analysis, utilizing the core differential Fourier synthesis (CDFS) method, reveal distinct anisotropic VED distributions around the two Co sites with different symmetries. The VED distribution around the octahedral Co site corresponds to a low-spin state, while the trigonal-prismatic Co site exhibits anisotropic VED that cannot be explained by the crystal electric field (CEF) alone. This anisotropy is better reproduced by a model incorporating CEF, spin-orbit coupling, and on-site 3d-4p orbital hybridization, consistent with a high-spin state exhibiting Ising magnetism. These results provide deeper insight into Co-3d states and highlight the CDFS method's utility in exploring interactions in quantum materials.

Title: A continuum mechanics approach for the deformation of non-Euclidean origami generated by piecewise constant nematic director fields
Authors: Linjuan Wang, Fan Feng
Abstract: We merge classical origami concepts with active actuation by designing origami patterns whose panels undergo prescribed metric changes. These metric changes render the system non-Euclidean, inducing non-zero Gaussian curvature at the vertices after actuation. Such patterns can be realized by programming piecewise constant director fields in liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) sheets. In this work, we address the geometric design of both compatible reference director patterns and their corresponding actuated configurations. On the reference configuration, we systematically construct director patterns that satisfy metric compatibility across interfaces. On the actuated configuration, we develop a continuum mechanics framework to analyze the kinematics of non-Euclidean origami. In particular, we fully characterize the deformation spaces of three-fold and four-fold vertices and establish analytical relationships between their deformations and the director patterns. Building on these kinematic insights, we propose two rational designs of large director patterns: one based on a quadrilateral tiling with alternating positive and negative actuated Gaussian curvature, and another combining three-fold and four-fold vertices governed by a folding angle theorem. Remarkably, both designs achieve compatibility in both the reference and actuated states. We anticipate that our geometric framework will facilitate the design of non-Euclidean/active origami structures and broaden their application in active metamaterials, soft actuators, and robotic systems.

Title: Superconducting properties of ultrapure niobium
Authors: N. E. Alekseevskiy, V. I. Nizhankovskiy, K.-H. Bertel
Abstract: The results of determination of critical magnetic fields, magnetization curves and critical currents of niobium samples of different purity are presented. It is shown that ultrapure niobium near Tc is a superconductor of the first type and becomes a superconductor of the second type with decreasing temperature due to the temperature dependence of the Ginzburg-Landau parameters. The dependence of the hysteresis of the magnetization curves of massive samples on the surface state is investigated. A comparison of the superconducting parameters with the parameters of the electron spectrum of niobium is carried out. The dependence of the critical current of niobium wires on the longitudinal magnetic field agrees with the assumption of a force-free current distribution.

Title: A flexible and interoperable high-performance Lanczos-based solver for generic quantum impurity problems: upgrading EDIpack
Authors: Lorenzo Crippa, Igor Krivenko, Samuele Giuli, Gabriele Bellomia, Alexander Kowalski, Francesco Petocchi, Alberto Scazzola, Markus Wallerberger, Giacomo Mazza, Luca de Medici, Giorgio Sangiovanni, Massimo Capone, Adriano Amaricci
Abstract: EDIpack is a flexible, high-performance numerical library using Lanczos-based exact diagonalization to solve generic quantum impurity problems, such as those introduced in Dynamical Mean-Field Theory to describe extended strongly correlated materials. The library efficiently solves impurity problems allowing for different broken-symmetry solutions, including superconductivity and featuring local spin-orbit coupling and/or electron-phonon coupling. The modular architecture of the software not only provides Fortran APIs but also includes bindings to C/C++, interfaces with Python and Julia or with TRIQS and W2Dynamics research platforms, thus ensuring unprecedented level of inter-operability. The outlook includes further extensions to study quantum materials and cold atoms quantum simulators, as well as quantum information applications.

Title: Floquet Möbius topological insulators
Authors: Longwen Zhou, Fan Zhang, Jiaxin Pan
Abstract: Möbius topological insulators hold twofold-degenerated dispersive edge bands with Möbius twists in momentum space, which are protected by the combination of chiral and ${\mathbb Z}_2$-projective translational symmetries. In this work, we reveal a unique type of Möbius topological insulator, whose edge bands could twist around the quasienergy $\pi$ of a periodically driven system and are thus of Floquet origin. By applying time-periodic quenches to an experimentally realized Möbius insulator model, we obtain interconnected Floquet Möbius edge bands around zero and $\pi$ quasienergies, which can coexist with a gapped or gapless bulk. These Möbius bands are topologically characterized by a pair of generalized winding numbers, whose quantizations are guaranteed by an emergent chiral symmetry at a high-symmetry point in momentum space. Numerical investigations of the quasienergy and entanglement spectra provide consistent evidence for the presence of such Möbius topological phases. A protocol based on the adiabatic switching of edge-band populations is further introduced to dynamically characterize the topology of Floquet Möbius edge bands. Our findings thus extend the scope of Möbius topological phases to nonequilibrium settings and unveil a unique class of Möbius twisted topological edge states without static counterparts.

Title: Sliding Ferroelectrics Induced Hybrid-Order Topological Phase Transitions
Authors: Ning-Jing Yang, Jian-Min Zhang, Xiao-Ping Li, Zeying Zhang, Zhi-Ming Yu, Zhigao Huang, Yugui Yao
Abstract: We propose ferroelectric layer sliding as a new approach to realize and manipulate topological quantum states in two-dimensional (2D) bilayer magnetic van der Waals materials. We show that stacking monolayer ferromagnetic topological states into layer-spin-locked bilayer antiferromagnetic structures, and introducing sliding ferroelectricity leads to asynchronous topological evolution of different layers (spins) owing to existence of polarization potentials, thereby giving rise to rich layer-resolved topological phases. As a specific example, by means of a lattice model, we show that a bilayer magnetic 2D second order topological insulator (SOTI) reveals an unrecognized spin-hybrid-order topological insulator after undergoing ferroelectric sliding. Interestingly, in such phase, the spin-up (top layer) and spin-down (bottom layer) channels exhibit first-order and second-order topological properties, respectively. Moreover, other topological phases such as SOTI, quantum spin Hall insulator, quantum anomalous Hall insulator, and trivial insulator can also emerge through changes in the parameters of the system, and the relevant topological indices are also discussed. In terms of materials, based on first principles calculations, we predict material ScI2 can serve as an ideal platform to realize our proposal. Further, we predict that the anomalous Nernst effect of these several topological phases exhibits distinct differences, and therefore can be used as a signal for experimentally probing.

Title: Colloidal nanoparticles in cholesteric liquid crystals: Bulk properties, biaxiality and untwisting
Authors: Prabakaran Rajamanickam, Fatimah Almutari, Apala Majumdar
Abstract: We study the effects of colloidal nanoparticles (NPs) in cholesteric liquid crystal samples in the dilute limit, in a Landau-de Gennes theoretical framework. The effects of the suspended NPs are captured by a homogenized energy, as outlined in [7]. For spatially homogeneous samples, we explicitly compute the critical points and minimizers of the modified Landau-de Gennes energy and show that the presence of NP eliminates the first-order isotropic-nematic phase transition, stabilises elusive biaxial phases over some temperature ranges, and that the symmetry of the NP boundary conditions or surface treatments dictates the bulk equilibrium phase at high temperatures. We also numerically demonstrate structural transitions from twisted helical director profiles to untwisted director profiles, in cholesteric-filled channel geometries, driven by the collective effects of the NPs and increasing temperature. These transitions are reversible upon lowering the temperature in sufficiently large domains, where thermal hysteresis can also be observed. This behaviour opens interesting avenues for tuning the optical properties of confined, nano-doped cholesteric systems.

Title: Switchable polarization in non-ferroelectric SrTiO$_3$
Authors: Wahib Aggoune, Matthias Scheffler
Abstract: Perovskites with tunable and switchable polarization hold immense promise for unlocking novel functionalities. Using density-functional theory, we reveal that intrinsic defects can induce, enhance, and control polarization in non-ferroelectric perovskites, with SrTiO$_3$ as our model system. At high defect concentrations, these systems exhibit strong spontaneous polarization - comparable to that of conventional ferroelectrics. Crucially, this polarization is switchable, enabled by the inherent symmetry-equivalence of defect sites in SrTiO$_3$. Strikingly, polarization switching not only reverses the polarization direction and modulates its magnitude but also modifies the spatial distribution of localized defect states. This dynamic behavior points to unprecedented responses to external stimuli, opening new avenues for defect-engineered materials design.

Title: Reply to the Comment on "Shell-Shaped Quantum Droplet in a Three-Component Ultracold Bose Gas"
Authors: Yinfeng Ma, Xiaoling Cui
Abstract: In our work (Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 043402 (2025)), we have proposed to realize a shell-shaped BEC with self-bound character in a three-component ($1,2,3$) Bose gas, where $(2,3)$ and $(1,2)$ both form quantum droplets and meanwhile are linked as core-shell structure. It was then commented in 2505.16554 that such structure is unstable against decaying to a ``dimer" configuration with lower energy, and moreover, it is ``most likely" impossible to be realized after releasing from the trap. In contrast to these claims, our reply shows that the core-shell and dimer states are energetically degenerate in the thermodynamic limit, and more importantly, the core-shell structure is robustly stable against external perturbations and can be realized practically following the trap-release scheme.

Title: Enhanced coherence and layer-selective charge order in a trilayer cuprate superconductor

Abstract: Trilayer cuprates hold the record for the highest superconducting critical temperatures ($T_{\text{c}}$), yet the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Using time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (tr-ARPES), we uncover a striking interplay between charge order, superconducting gap magnitude, and quasiparticle coherence in Bi$_2$Sr$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{10+\delta}$ (Bi2223). This constitutes ARPES-based evidence of charge order on the inner CuO$_2$ plane, as confirmed via resonant x-ray scattering (RXS); in addition, the same inner plane hosts a superconducting gap significantly larger than that of the overdoped outer planes, firmly establishing it as underdoped. Unexpectedly, despite its underdoped nature, the inner plane also exhibits an exceptional degree of quasiparticle coherence; suppressing charge-order fluctuations further enhances this, making it comparable to that of the overdoped outer planes at elevated electronic temperatures. These findings, supported by complementary three-layer single-band Hubbard calculations, reveal a unique interlayer mechanism in which both pairing strength and phase coherence are optimized when interfacing planes with distinct hole concentrations, providing new microscopic insight into the record $T_{\text{c}}$ of Bi2223.

Title: Machine Learning-Guided Discovery of Temperature-Induced Solid-Solid Phase Transitions in Inorganic Materials
Authors: Cibrán López, Joshua Ojih, Ming Hu, Josep Lluis Tamarit, Edgardo Saucedo, Claudio Cazorla
Abstract: Predicting solid-solid phase transitions remains a long-standing challenge in materials science. Solid-solid transformations underpin a wide range of functional properties critical to energy conversion, information storage, and thermal management technologies. However, their prediction is computationally intensive due to the need to account for finite-temperature effects. Here, we present an uncertainty-aware machine-learning-guided framework for high-throughput prediction of temperature-induced polymorphic phase transitions in inorganic crystals. By combining density functional theory calculations with graph-based neural networks trained to estimate vibrational free energies, we screened a curated dataset of approximately 50,000 inorganic compounds and identified over 2,000 potential solid-solid transitions within the technologically relevant temperature interval 300-600 K. Among our key findings, we uncover numerous phase transitions exhibiting large entropy changes (> 300 J K$^{-1}$ kg$^{-1}$), many of which occur near room temperature hence offering strong potential for solid-state cooling applications. We also identify $21$ compounds that exhibit substantial relative changes in lattice thermal conductivity (20-70%) across a phase transition, highlighting them as promising thermal switching materials. Validation against experimental observations and first-principles calculations supports the robustness and predictive power of our approach. Overall, this work establishes a scalable route to discover functional phase-change materials under realistic thermal conditions, and lays the foundation for future high-throughput studies leveraging generative models and expanding open-access materials databases.

Title: Tunable direct bandgap and optical response in \ch{Mo_{1-x}W_xS2} monolayer alloys: A first-principles investigation
Authors: Kevin Ndang Amassa, Jean-Pierre Tchapet Njafa, Anne Justine Etindele, Chetty Nithaya, Serge Guy Nana Engo
Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive first-principles investigation of the structural, electronic and optical properties of monolayer \ch{Mo_{1-x}W_xS2} alloys, systematically exploring the full compositional range ($x=0$ to $1$) using density functional theory (DFT). We establish that these alloys are thermodynamically stable and maintain the characteristic 2H crystal structure with minimal structural perturbation upon alloying. A key finding is the preservation of a direct bandgap at the $K$-point across all compositions. This gap exhibits continuous tunability, increasing near-monotonically from \SI{1.696}{\electronvolt} (\ch{MoS2}) to \SI{1.858}{\electronvolt} (\ch{WS2}), a critical feature for tailoring optoelectronic devices. Electronic structure analysis reveals the systematic evolution of the orbital contributions of transition metal $d$ and sulfur $p$ at the edges of the band with composition. Consequently, the optical spectra, evaluated up to \SI{8}{\electronvolt}, show a progressive blueshift in the main features of the interband transition with increasing \ch{W} content, accompanied by predictable changes in key optical constants. Our comprehensive results validate the monolayer \ch{Mo_{1-x} W_xS2} as an electronically versatile platform that offers fine control over electronic and optical properties via alloying, making these tunable direct-gap semiconductors highly promising for next-generation photodetectors, light emitters, and potentially flexible optoelectronic applications exploiting their 2D nature.

Title: Persistence of charge ordering instability to Coulomb engineering in the excitonic insulator candidate TiSe$_2$
Authors: Sebastian Buchberger, Yann in 't Veld, Akhil Rajan, Philip A. E. Murgatroyd, Brendan Edwards, Bruno K. Saika, Naina Kushwaha, Maria H. Visscher, Jan Berges, Dina Carbone, Jacek Osiecki, Craig Polley, Tim Wehling, Phil D. C. King
Abstract: TiSe$_2$ has long been considered one of the best candidate materials to host the elusive excitonic insulator (EI) phase. However, a finite coupling to the lattice can generically be expected, while a lack of "smoking-gun" signatures for the importance of the electron-hole interaction in driving the phase transition has rendered it challenging to distinguish the EI from the conventional charge-density-wave (CDW) phase. Here, we demonstrate a new approach, exploiting the susceptibility of excitons to dielectric screening. We combine mechanical exfoliation with molecular-beam epitaxy to fabricate ultra-clean van der Waals heterostructures of monolayer (ML-)TiSe$_2$/graphite and ML-TiSe$_2$/hBN. We observe how the modified substrate screening environment drives a renormalisation of the quasi-particle band gap of the TiSe$_2$ layer, signifying its susceptibility to Coloumb engineering. The temperature-dependent evolution of its electronic structure, however, remains unaffected, indicating that excitons are not required to drive the CDW transition in TiSe$_2$.

Title: Dependency of quantum time scales on symmetry
Authors: Fei Guo, Dmitrii Usanov, Eduardo B. Guedes, Mauro Fanciulli, Kaishu Kawaguchi, Ryo Mori, Takeshi Kondo, Arnaud Magrez, Michele Puppin, Hugo Dil
Abstract: Although used extensively in everyday life, time is one of the least understood quantities in physics, especially on the level of quantum mechanics. Here we use an experimental method based on spin- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy from spin-degenerate dispersive states to determine the Eisenbud-Wigner-Smith (EWS) time delay of photoemission. This time scale of the quantum transition is measured for materials with different dimensionality and correlation strength. A direct link between the dimensionality, or rather the symmetry of the system, and the attosecond photoionisation time scale is found. The quasi 2-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides 1T-TiSe$_2$ and 1T-TiTe$_2$ show time scales around 150 as, whereas in quasi 1-dimensional CuTe the photoionisation takes more than 200 as. This is in stark contrast with the 26 as found for 3-dimensional pure Cu. These results provide new insights into the role of symmetry in quantum time scales and may provide a route to understanding the role of time in quantum mechanics.

Title: Unconventional Orbital Magnetism in Graphene-based Fractional Chern Insulators

Abstract: Orbital magnetism in graphene originates from correlation-driven spontaneous valley symmetry breaking1-7. It can lead to various anomalous transport phenomena such as integer and fractional quantum anomalous Hall effects8-11. In general, the in-plane magnetic field B|| primarily couples to the spin degrees of freedom in graphene and has long been presumed to have a negligible effect on orbital magnetism due to the ultra-weak spin-orbit coupling12-18. In this work, we report multiple unconventional orbital magnetic phenomena that are highly sensitive to the B|| field in graphene/hBN superlattices hosting both integer and fractional Chern insulators (FCIs). We observed chirality-switching behaviors of the Chern insulator at moiré filling factor {\nu} = 1 under a finite B_par, demonstrating that both the C = +-1 states are permissible ground states at zero perpendicular magnetic field B_per. For the FCI at {\nu} = 2/3, we observed topological phase transitions between two states characterized by Hall resistivity \r{ho}xy = +-3h/2e2 under both B_per and B_par fields. In-plane B|| field can effectively suppress the FCI state at zero B_per field and enhance the FCI state with the opposite chirality, as resolved in Landau fan diagrams. Moreover, we observed rich phase transitions at 1 < {\nu} < 2, accompanied by intervalley coherence and anomalous Hall effects (AHE) that can be triggered by sweeping either B_per or B_par. Our work has unveiled new properties of orbital magnetism, providing a new knob for engineering various AHE in graphene.

Title: Linked skyrmions in shifted magnetic bilayer
Authors: Sumit Ghosh, Hiroshi Katsumoto, Gustav Bihlmayer, Moritz Sallermann, Vladyslav M. Kuchkin, Filipp N. Rybakov, Olle Eriksson, Stefan Blügel, Nikolai S. Kiselev
Abstract: We present a shifted magnetic bilayer that exhibits various magnetic phases and magnetic textures with arbitrarily large topological numbers. The proposed system is characterised by a mutually orthogonal Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) in two different layers which can be induced by suitably placing non-magnetic atom with spin-orbit coupling. At weak interlayer coupling, the ground state resembles a checker-board pattern containing regions with unfavourable magnetic alignment which we call anti-aligned points. At finite interlayer coupling and finite external magnetic field, the bilayer can demonstrate a new class of magnetic solitons where multiple magnetic solitons can be connected by topological point defects which we call linked skyrmion. In addition to that the model also demonstrates conventional skyrmion-bags and $k\pi$-skyrmions. Finally, with rigorous first principle calculations, we propose a suitable material candidate where these magnetic configurations can be observed.

Title: Deep learning of thermodynamic laws from microscopic dynamics
Authors: Hiroto Kuroyanagi, Tatsuro Yuge
Abstract: We numerically show that a deep neural network (DNN) can learn macroscopic thermodynamic laws purely from microscopic data. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we generate the data of snapshot images of gas particles undergoing adiabatic processes. We train a DNN to determine the temporal order of input image pairs. We observe that the trained network induces an order relation between states consistent with adiabatic accessibility, satisfying the axioms of thermodynamics. Furthermore, the internal representation learned by the DNN act as an entropy. These results suggest that machine learning can discover emergent physical laws that are valid at scales far larger than those of the underlying constituents -- opening a pathway to data-driven discovery of macroscopic physics.

Title: Fully characterized linear magnetoelectric response of 2D monolayers from high-throughput first-principles calculations
Authors: John Mangeri, Thomas Olsen
Abstract: We screen 4784 stable monolayers from the Computational 2D Materials Database (C2DB) and identify 57 ferromagnetic (FM) and 67 antiferromagnetic (AFM) that should exhibit linear magnetoelectric (ME) effects. Using density functional theory, we compute contributions from the spin and orbital angular momentum as well as lattice-mediated and clamped-ion analogs to fully characterize the linear ME tensor in the static limit. We observe a general trend that AFM ordering gives rise to a larger ME response compared to FM ordered monolayers. Using a typical van der Waals interlayer distance, we find that AFM $\mathrm{Mn}_2\mathrm{SI}_2$ exhibits the strongest component of linear ME response, providing approximately 580 ps/m. This is two orders of magnitude greater than in prototypical $\mathrm{Cr}_2\mathrm{O}_3$ but comparable to the largest ME response measured in bulk $\mathrm{TbPO}_4$ (280-740 ps/m). We also search for antimagnetoelectricity and find a number of FM and AFM compounds with antiferroic tensor entries. By demonstration of select examples and analysis of our full data set, we argue that inclusion of all contributions (spin, orbital, lattice-mediated and clamped-ion) is of crucial importance for reliable predictions of the total ME response.

Title: Machine-learning-driven modelling of amorphous and polycrystalline BaZrS$_{3}$
Authors: Laura-Bianca Paşca, Yuanbin Liu, Andy S. Anker, Ludmilla Steier, Volker L. Deringer
Abstract: The chalcogenide perovskite material BaZrS$_{3}$ is of growing interest for emerging thin-film photovoltaics. Here we show how machine-learning-driven modelling can be used to describe the material's amorphous precursor as well as polycrystalline structures with complex grain boundaries. Using a bespoke machine-learned interatomic potential (MLIP) model for BaZrS$_{3}$, we study the atomic-scale structure of the amorphous phase, quantify grain-boundary formation energies, and create realistic-scale polycrystalline structural models which can be compared to experimental data. Beyond BaZrS$_{3}$, our work exemplifies the increasingly central role of MLIPs in materials chemistry and marks a step towards realistic device-scale simulations of materials that are gaining momentum in the fields of photovoltaics and photocatalysis.

Title: Electronic structure reorganization in MPS3 via d-shell-selective alkali metal doping

Abstract: Semiconducting two-dimensional (2D) antiferromagnetic (AFM) transition-metal thiophosphates (MPS3) offer promising opportunities for spintronic applications due to their highly tunable electronic properties. While alloying and intercalation have been shown to modulate ground states, the role of d-shell filling in governing these transitions remains insufficiently understood. Here, we investigate electron doping effects in MPS3 using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and density functional theory (DFT+U). Lithium and cesium deposition are employed to induce doping across different MPS3 compounds. We identify two distinct doping mechanisms: in MnPS3, electrons are primarily donated to the P2S6 ligand clusters, with negligible Mn 2p core-level shifts and no major changes in the valence band. In contrast, FePS3, CoPS3, and NiPS3 exhibit clear reductions in transition-metal oxidation states, with a 1.0 eV reduction in spin-orbit splitting for Co upon doping. ARPES on CoPS3 reveals a 400 meV shift of Co-derived bands towards higher binding energies and new dispersive states up to 1 eV above the valence band maximum, indicating metallic behavior. These results establish a direct correlation between d-shell filling and doping response, highlighting alkali metal doping as a tunable route to tailor the electronic and magnetic properties of 2D AFM semiconductors for spintronic applications.

Title: Eta-pairing states in Hubbard models with bond-charge interactions on general graphs
Authors: Ming-Yong Ye
Abstract: We investigate Hubbard models with bond-charge interactions on general graphs. For a Hamiltonian \(H\) of such a model, we provide the condition on its parameters under which the \(\eta\)-pairing method can be employed to construct its exact eigenstates. We arrive at this condition by finding that the requirement for the \(\eta\)-pairing state \((\eta^\dagger)^N |0\rangle\) to be an eigenstate of \(H\) is identical to the requirement for it to be an eigenstate of a Hubbard-type Hamiltonian \(H_m\). When the condition for \((\eta^\dagger)^N |0\rangle\) to be an eigenstate of the Hubbard-type Hamiltonian \(H_m\) is satisfied, we demonstrate that there are additional states, distinct from \((\eta^\dagger)^N |0\rangle\), which are also exact eigenstates of \(H_m\). Our results enhance the understanding of Hubbard models on general graphs, both with and without bond-charge interactions.

Title: Unlocking the hybrid piezo and pyroelectric nanogenerators performance by SiO2 nanowires confinement in poly(vinylidene fluoride)
Authors: Juan Delgado-Alvarez, Hari Krishna Mishra, Francisco J. Aparicio, Xabier Garcia-Casas, Angel Barranco, Juan R. Sanchez-Valencia, Victor Lopez-Flores, Ana Borras
Abstract: We report on the development of a novel flexible piezo/pyro-electric nanogenerator (PPNG) that combines a uniform film of poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) infiltrated over vertically supported SiO2 nanowires (NWs) to enhance both piezoelectric and pyroelectric energy harvesting capabilities. The synthetic procedure involves a low-temperature multi-step approach, including the soft-template formation of SiO2 NWs on a flexible substrate, followed by the infiltration of a PVDF thin film (TF). The plasma-enabled fabrication of SiO2 NWs facilitated vertical alignment and precise control over the surface microstructure, density, and thickness of the confined nanostructures. These strategic structural systems promote the development of the most favourable electroactive \b{eta}- and {\gamma}-phases in the PVDF matrix. Notably, the electrical poling plays a major role in aligning the random dipoles of the PVDF macromolecular chain in a more ordered fashion to nucleate the amplified electroactive phases. As a proof-of-concept, the fabricated PPNG exhibited a significant improvement in the instantaneous piezoelectric output power density (P), ~ 9-fold amplification relative to its bare PVDF TF counterpart. Analogously, the pyroelectric coefficient (p) demonstrated a 4-fold superior performance with referenced PVDF TF based PPNG. Thus, the engineered system of SiO2 NWs@PVDF comprising PPNG offers a promising pathway toward multisource energy harvesting capabilities through efficient energy transduction at mechanical excitation frequencies of 10-12 Hz and across a temperature difference ({\Delta}T) of 9 to 22 K.

Title: Unfolding the kagome lattice to improve understanding of ARPES in CoSn
Authors: Véronique Brouet, Aaditya Vedant, Francois Bertran, Patrick Le Fèvre, Oleg Rubel
Abstract: Metallic kagome lattices are attracting significant attention as they provide a platform to explore the interplay between topology and magnetism. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) plays a key role in unraveling their electronic structure. However, the analysis is often challenging due to the presence of multiple bands near the Fermi level. Indeed, each orbital generates three bands in a kagome lattice due to its three inequivalent sites, which soon becomes complicated if many orbitals are present. To address this complexity, using ARPES matrix elements can be highly beneficial. First, band symmetry can be determined through selection rules based on light polarization. We emphasize that, in kagome lattices, symmetry is not only determined by the orbital character but also by the relative phase between the three sublattices. Additionally, interference between the three sublattices leads to a strong modulation of ARPES intensity across neighboring Brillouin zones. We show how unfolded band calculations capture these modulations, helping with band identification. We apply these ideas to CoSn, whose simple structure retains the key features of a kagome lattice. Taking advantage of these two effects, we isolate the dispersion of each band and discuss novel correlation effects, selectively renormalizing the bands crossing the Fermi level and shifting the others.

Authors: Pablo Cayado, João Rosas, João Murta-Pina, Harold S. Ruiz
Abstract: The successful integration of high-temperature superconductors (HTS) into modern technologies requires consistent, accessible, and comprehensive material data, a need that is currently unmet due to the fragmented and incomplete nature of existing resources. This paper introduces a new collaborative, open-access database specifically designed to address this gap by providing standardized data on HTS materials and crucial auxiliary components for HTS applications. The database encompasses extensive data on structural, cryogenic, electrical, magnetic, and superconducting materials, supporting diverse requirements from HTS modelling to magnet design. Developed through collaborative efforts and organized using an ontology-driven data model, this platform is dynamically adaptable, ensuring that it can grow as new materials and data emerge. Key features include user-driven contributions, peer-reviewed data validation, and advanced filtering capabilities for efficient data retrieval. This innovative database, to the knowledge of the authors, being the largest publicly available for material properties of HTS technologies is positioned as a valuable tool for the HTS community, promoting more efficient research and development processes, accelerating the practical application of HTS, and fostering a collaborative approach to knowledge sharing within the field.

Title: Realization of broken inversion symmetry in the charge density wave phase in EuAl$_4$
Authors: Surya Rohith Kotla (1), Leila Noohinejad (2), Preeti Pokhriyal (2), Martin Tolkiehn (2), Harshit Agarwal (1 and 3), Sitaram Ramakrishnan (4), Sander van Smaalen (1) ((1) Laboratory of Crystallography, Bayerisches Geoinstitut, University of Bayreuth, Germany, (2) Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron DESY, Hamburg, Germany, (3) Institut für Physik, Johannes-Gutenberg-Universität Mainz, Germany, (4) Institut Néel CNRS/UGA UPR2940, Grenoble, France)
Abstract: EuAl$_4$ exhibits a complex phase diagram, including the development of a charge density wave (CDW) below $T_{CDW} = 145$ K. Below $T_{N}=15.4$ K, a series of antiferromagnetically (AFM) ordered phases appear, while non-trivial topological phases, like skyrmion lattices, are stabilized under an applied magnetic field. The symmetries of the variously ordered phases are a major issue concerning the understanding of the stabilization of the ordered phases as well as concerning the interplay between the various types of order. EuAl$_4$ at room temperature has tetragonal symmetry with space group $I4/mmm$. The CDW phase has an incommensurately modulated crystal structure described by the modulation wave vector $\mathbf{q} \approx 0.17\,\mathbf{c}^{*}$. On the basis of various experiments, including elastic and inelastic x-ray scattering, and second-harmonic generation, it has been proposed that the symmetry of the CDW phase of EuAl$_4$ could be centrosymmetric orthorhombic, non-centrosymmetric orthorhombic or non-centrosymmetric tetragonal. Here, we report temperature-dependent, single-crystal x-ray diffraction experiments that show that the CDW is a transverse CDW with phason disorder, and with non-centrosymmetric symmetry according to the orthorhombic superspace group $F222(0\,0\,\sigma)00s$.Essential for this finding is the availability of a sufficient number of second-order ($2\mathbf{q}$) satellite reflections in the x-ray diffraction data set. The broken inversion symmetry implies that skyrmions might form due to Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions, instead of a more exotic mechanism as it is required for centrosymmetric structures.

Abstract: Recent discoveries in kagome materials have unveiled their capacity to harbor exotic quantum states, including intriguing charge density wave (CDW) and superconductivity. Notably, accumulating experimental evidence suggests time-reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking within the CDW, hinting at the long-pursued loop current order (LCO). Despite extensive research efforts, achieving its model realization and understanding the mechanism through unbiased many-body simulations have remained both elusive and this http URL this work, we develop a microscopic model for LCO on the spinless kagome lattice with non-local interactions, utilizing unbiased functional renormalization group calculations to explore ordering tendencies across all two-particle scattering channels. At the van Hove filling, we identify sublattice interference to suppress onsite CDW order, leaving LCO, charge bond and nematic CDW state as the main competitors. Remarkably, a $2\times2$ LCO emerges as the many-body ground state over a significant parameter space with strong second nearest-neighbor repulsion, stemming from the unique interplay between sublattice characters and lattice geometry. The resulting electronic model with LCO bears similarities to the Haldane model and culminates in a quantum anomalous Hall state. We also discuss potential experimental implications for kagome metals.

Title: Anomalous non-thermal fixed point in a quasi-two-dimensional dipolar Bose gas
Authors: Niklas Rasch, Lauriane Chomaz, Thomas Gasenzer
Abstract: The emergence of distinctly sub-diffusive scaling in the vicinity of an anomalous non-thermal fixed point is discussed in a quasi-two-dimensional dipolar Bose gas in the superfluid phase, carrying ensembles of vortices and antivortices with zero net angular momentum. The observed scaling behavior reflects coarsening dynamics driven by the mutual annihilation of vortices and antivortices, with the mean inter-defect distance growing algebraically over time as $\ell_\text{v}(t)\sim t^{\,\beta}$. A sub-diffusive ($\beta<1/2$) exponent $\beta\approx0.2$ is extracted for various parameter regimes, initial conditions, and dipolar configurations from both scaling occupation-number spectra and the evolution of inter-defect distances as well as the corresponding total vortex densities. As vortex-antivortex annihilation progresses, excitations of the background condensate increase. This gives rise to a transition in the scaling behavior at late times, toward a non-thermal fixed point governed by diffusion-type scaling with $\beta\approx1/2$ as expected for the mutual annihilation of well-separated vortex-antivortex dipoles. While the temporal scaling with $\beta$ does not depend significantly on the strength and anisotropy of the dipolar interactions and thus underlines the universality of the anomalous as well as diffusion-type non-thermal fixed points, we find distinctly different vortex patterns resulting in the dipolar case. While in the superfluid with contact interactions only, same-sign vortices tend to cluster and form large-scale eddies, in the dipolar and tilted cases, roton excitations appear to prevent such motion, giving rather rise to a maximisation of distances between vortices of either sign.

Title: Overcoming Data Scarcity in Scanning Tunnelling Microscopy Image Segmentation
Authors: Nikola L. Kolev, Max Trouton, Filippo Federici Canova, Geoff Thornton, David Z. Gao, Neil J. Curson, Taylor J. Z. Stock
Abstract: Scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) is a powerful technique for imaging surfaces with atomic resolution, providing insight into physical and chemical processes at the level of single atoms and molecules. A regular task of STM image analysis is the identification and labelling of features of interest against a uniform background. Performing this manually is a labour-intensive task, requiring significant human effort. To reduce this burden, we propose an automated approach to the segmentation of STM images that uses both few-shot learning and unsupervised learning. Our technique offers greater flexibility compared to previous supervised methods; it removes the requirement for large manually annotated datasets and is thus easier to adapt to an unseen surface while still maintaining a high accuracy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by using it to recognise atomic features on three distinct surfaces: Si(001), Ge(001), and TiO$_2$(110), including adsorbed AsH$_3$ molecules on the silicon and germanium surfaces. Our model exhibits strong generalisation capabilities, and following initial training, can be adapted to unseen surfaces with as few as one additional labelled data point. This work is a significant step towards efficient and material-agnostic, automatic segmentation of STM images.

Title: Strain-Induced Modulation of Spin Splitting and Persistent Spin Textures in Low-Symmetry 2D Hybrid Perovskites: A case study of RP phase
Authors: Shantanu Pathak, Saswata Bhattacharya
Abstract: We report the observation of a persistent spin texture (PST) in pseudo-2D hybrid perovskite, characterized by significant spin splitting strength on the order of \(3 \, \text{eV} \cdot \textÅ\). Using first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations, complemented by a \(\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{p}\) model analysis, we validate the presence of PST and its robustness under various conditions. The material's non-centrosymmetric nature and strong spin-orbit coupling ensure uniform spin orientation in momentum space, enabling long spin lifetimes and promising spintronic applications. Furthermore, we demonstrate the tunability of the spin splitting via the application of external strain and stress, offering a versatile approach to control spin configurations. Our results highlight the potential of this perovskite system for next-generation spintronic devices, where external perturbations can be used to precisely modulate electronic properties.

Title: Unconventional Superconducting Pairing Symmetries in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$: from the Perspective of Topology
Authors: Guan-Hao Feng, Jun Quan, Yusheng Hou
Abstract: The recently discovered superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has attracted significant attention due to its remarkably high $T_{c}$ and unconventional pairing mechanism. High-pressure experiments have demonstrated that the emergence of the superconducting phase is associated with a transition to a higher-symmetry structure. Motivated by this observation, we investigate superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under high pressure from the perspectives of symmetry and topology. Based on a bilayer two-orbital model with Ni-$d_{3z^{2}-r^{2}}$ and $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ orbitals, we systematically examine all symmetry-allowed multi-orbital superconducting pairings at the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) mean-field level, including terms up to next-nearest neighbors. By solving the self-consistent gap equations and analyzing the BdG condensation energies, we find that the $A_{1g}$ pairing channel is the most probable one. The dominant pairing is $s_{\pm}$-wave, originating from the intra-orbital interaction of the bilayer Ni-$d_{3z^{2}-r^{2}}$ orbital, while the subdominant pairing is $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-wave, arising from the inter-orbital interactions between the $d_{3z^{2}-r^{2}}$ and $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ orbitals. Furthermore, we implement the theory of symmetry indicator to reveal the topological characteristics of each pairing channel, demonstrating that the pairing symmetries can be identified by their distinct topological features.

Title: Micelle Forming Linear-Dendritic Block Copolymers: A Theoretical Comparison between Random Hyperbranched and Precise Dendrimer Polymer Architectures
Authors: Marios Giannakou, Oleg V. Borisov, Friederike Schmid
Abstract: Hyperbranched block copolymers offer a simpler and more efficient synthesis route compared to more traditional dendritic systems, while still providing exceptional control over surface functionality and self-assembly. This makes them ideal candidates for engineering nanoparticles with tailored properties for applications such as drug delivery and sensing. Here we use self-consistent field calculations to compare the micelle structures formed by copolymers with a polydisperse hyperbranched (LHBC), monodisperse dendritic (LDBC), and linear solvophilic blocks. Representative LHBC structures were generated by molecular dynamics simulations mimicking the slow-monomer addition protocol. We find that LHBC micelles are more stable, have a lower critical micelle concentration, and are better at accommodating larger drug payloads than LDBC micelles, and these properties further improve with increasing polydispersity. LHBC micelles also offer more terminal ends for functionalization than LDBC micelles for LDBCs with up to four branching generations, with the number of terminal ends being surprisingly independent of the LHBC polydispersity. Our findings highlight the superiority of LHBC micelles in flexibility and performance over LDBC micelles.

Title: Infinite symmetry prevents disorder-induced localization in 2D
Authors: Carlo A. Trugenberger
Abstract: We show that 2D gapped many-body quantum states are constrained by an infinite-dimensional symmetry which renders them transparent to weak disorder. This prevents disorder-induced localization when interactions are strong enough to open a gap. Using purely algebraic methods we derive all possible quantum states near the superconductor-to-insulator (SIT) transition and we compute the meson spectrum of superinsulators.

Title: Superconducting gaps revealed by STM measurements on La2PrNi2O7 thin films at ambient pressure
Authors: Shengtai Fan, Mengjun Ou, Marius Scholten, Qing Li, Zhiyuan Shang, Yi Wang, Jiasen Xu, Huan Yang, Ilya M. Eremin, Hai-Hu Wen
Abstract: The recent discovery of superconductivity in nickelate systems has generated tremendous interests in the field of superconductivity. The superconducting transition temperature above 80 K in La3Ni2O7 under pressure and the coexisting spin excitations certainly categorize the nickelate superconductors as unconventional. The core issue to understand the superconductivity mechanism is about the superconducting gap and its symmetry. By using the substrate of SrLaAlO4(00l), we have successfully synthesized the superconducting thin film of La2PrNi2O7 with Tc(onset) = 41.5 K. Superconducting tunneling spectra are successfully measured on the terraces after we remove the surface layer and expose the superconducting layer by using the tip-excavation technique. The spectrum shows a two-gap structure with Delta1 = 19 meV, Delta2 = 6 meV, and fittings based on the Dynes model indicate that the dominant gap should have an anisotropic s-wave structure, and the pure d-wave model fails to fit the data. Thus, our data put the priority in selecting the s+- among the two arguable pairing models: s+- and d-wave. Assuming the dominant interlayer superconducting gap, we obtain its magnitude to be Delta(perp) = 13 meV, while the intralayer gap Delta(para) is about 6 meV. Our results shed new light in understanding the mystery of superconductivity in bilayer nickelate superconductors.

Title: Comment on "Neutron diffraction evidence of the 3-dimensional structure of Ba2MnTeO6 and misidentification of the triangular layers within the face-centred cubic lattice"
Authors: J. Khatua, T. Arh, Shashi B. Mishra, H. Luetkens, A. Zorko, B. Sana, M. S. Ramachandra Rao, B. R. K. Nanda, P. Khuntia
Abstract: Frustrated magnetism continues to attract significant attention due to its potential to host novel quantum many-body phenomena and associated exotic excitations that transcend existing paradigms. Herein, we present our reply to the comment on our recent thermodynamic and muon spin relaxation studies on a frustrated double perovskite, Ba2MnTeO6 (henceforth BMTO). Previous studies by four independent groups, including our group, suggested a trigonal space group based on single-crystal and polycrystalline samples of BMTO, while the recent comment reports a cubic space group based on polycrystalline samples. We believe that the structure is fairly intricate because of the slight variations between the two space groups, refining the crystal structure of BMTO remains an unresolved problem that needs additional high-resolution XRD and neutron diffraction studies on high-quality single crystals. It is thought, however, that structural assignments will not greatly influence any of the primary findings related to the magnetism and spin dynamics of BMTO. These consist of a magnetic phase transition at around 21 K, the observation of antiferromagnetic magnon excitations exhibiting a gap of 1.4 K beneath the phase transition, the presence of short-range spin correlations well above the antiferromagnetic phase transition, and the persistence of spin dynamics even within the magnetically ordered phase. It is important to note that the magnetization, specific heat, and muon spin relaxation findings that constitute the core of our earlier study are independent; the interpretation of these findings did not rely on any specific space group. Concerning the final allocation of the symmetry of BMTO, a definitive differentiation in certain physical characteristics resulting from the symmetry is still necessary.

Title: Superconducting diode effect in a meso-wedge geometry with Abrikosov vortices
Authors: C. A. Aguirre, J. Barba-Ortega, A. S. de Arruda, J. Faundez
Abstract: In this study, we explore the behavior of a superconducting meso-wedge geometry in 3+1 dimensions (three spatial dimensions plus time) subjected to external transport currents at its boundaries and surfaces, as well as external fields applied along the $\hat{z}$-direction. The transport currents are included as two opposite polarities, $\textbf{J}>0$ and $\textbf{J}<0$. Using the generalized time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau theory and considering the order parameter $\kappa$, we focus on two scenarios: a fixed external magnetic field with variable $\kappa$, and fixed $\kappa$ with variable external magnetic field. As a result, under both scenarios, we analyze the voltage-current characteristics of the superconducting meso-wedge, finding that the critical currents differ between polarities, demonstrating the system's non-reciprocity. We further examine the efficiency of the diode as a function of $\kappa$ and the external magnetic field applied. Furthermore, our observations reveal that the current polarity strongly influences the vortex configuration, the parameter $\kappa$, and the applied magnetic field. In particular, the formation of Abrikosov-type vortices exhibits pronounced inhomogeneity depending on the direction of the transport currents. This underscores that the diode effect in the superconducting meso-wedge is intimately associated with the anisotropic nucleation of Abrikosov vortices. Notably, the emergence of polarity-dependent vortex patterns can serve as a distinctive hallmark of the diode effect in these superconducting systems.

Title: Electronic Temperature-Driven Phase Stability and Structural Evolution of Iron at High Pressure
Authors: S. Azadi, S.M. Vinko
Abstract: We present Gibbs free-energy phase diagrams for compressed iron within a pressure range of 20 to 300 GPa and electronic temperature up to 3 eV obtained using finite-temperature density functional and density functional perturbation theories. Our results for bcc, fcc, and hcp phases predict solid-solid phase transitions in iron driven purely by electronic entropy and temperature. We found a phase transition from hcp to bcc at pressures above 200 GPa, which depends on the electronic temperature. An experimental observation of the stability of the bcc phase above 200 GPa by X-ray Free Electron Laser has recently been reported.

Title: Inductive-Effect-Driven Tunability of Magnetism and Lumines-cence in Triangular Layers ANd(SO4)2 (A = Rb, Cs)
Authors: Xudong Huai, Ebube E. Oyeka, Uchenna Chinaegbomkpa, Michal J. Winiarski, Hugo Sanabria, Thao T. Tran
Abstract: Tuning the energy landscape of manybody electronic states in extended solids through the inductive effect-a concept widely used in organic chemistry-offers a new, effective strategy for materials development. Here, we demonstrate this approach using the ANd(SO4)2 (A = Rb, Cs) model system, which possesses different A-site electronegativity and displays a distorted triangular lattice of Nd3+ (4I9/2 ground term). Magnetization data indicate appreciable antiferromagnetic interactions without long-range ordering down to 1.8 K while highlighting the tunable population of the electronic states. Temperature-dependent and time-resolved photoluminescence measurements reveal that emissions and nonradiative processes can be modified by the inductive effect at the atomic level. Heat capacity data confirm no magnetic ordering and add insight into the role of phonons in emission lifetime. Density functional theory calculations prove enhanced covalency in the Cs compound compared to the Rb counterpart while acknowledging the adjustable magnetic intralayer and inter-layer exchange pathways. These results demonstrate a viable framework for utilizing the inductive effect as an important knob for simultaneously dialing in magnetic, optical, and electronic properties in quantum materials.

Title: Phenomenology of altermagnets
Authors: Maxim Mostovoy
Abstract: Altermagnets have recently emerged as a new class of magnetic materials sharing properties of both antiferromagnets and ferromagnets. Despite very small net magnetization, they show phenomena usually associated with ferromagnetism, such as the Faraday, Kerr and Anomalous Hall effects, resulting from the relativistic spin-orbit coupling, as well as the spin splitting of electron bands and Spin Hall Effect of non-relativistic origin. Spin space groups and magnetic multipoles are used to explain symmetry properties of altermagnets. Here, I show that the conventional phenomenological description in terms of a vector antiferromagnetic order parameter can be applied to all effects observed in altermagnets with collinear and non-collinear spin orders. I also discuss non-relativistic effects in non-altermagnets.

Title: Pressure-induced structural disordering and anomalous pressure-volume behaviour in high-entropy zirconates
Authors: Yogendar Singh, Xinghua Su, Vivek Kumar, H. K. Poswal, K. K. Pandey, Pawan Kumar Kulriya
Abstract: The ambient-temperature high-pressure behaviour of (La0.2Nd0.2Sm0.2Gd0.2Yb0.2)2Zr2O7 zirconate (HEZ) nanopowders with three different average particle sizes (~25nm, ~45 nm and ~ 68nm) were studied using synchrotron X-ray diffraction (SR-XRD) measurements up to ~30 GPa. Smaller particle-size HEZ nanopowder (~25 nm), synthesized at the lower sintering temperature, exhibits pure defect-fluorite (DF) phase, whereas larger particle-size HEZ nanopowders (~45nm and ~68nm), synthesized at the higher sintering temperature, exhibit mixture of DF and pyrochlore phase (PY). The phase fraction of the PY phase increases with sintering temperature and hence with the particle size. All the HEZ nanopowders exhibit stability of initial structures (DF and PY) up to ~ 30 GPa, though phase fraction of PY phase in larger particle-size HEZ nanopowders successively reduces with pressure which is concomitant with significant variation in ox48f fractional coordinate in PY phase. Both the phases in all the studied samples exhibit anomalous pressure-volume (P-V) behaviour between ~7 to 15 GPa. The anomaly decreases with increasing particle size of HEZ nanopowders. The variation of bond lengths and polyhedron volume with pressure suggests that the anomalous P-V behaviour and structural changes at high pressures are primarily due to the distortion of the polyhedrons in DF and PY structures in HEZ nanopowders.

Title: A Quantum-Inspired Conceptual Model of Collective Subjective Evaluation via Bloch Sphere Dynamics and Like-Polarization
Authors: Bumned Soodchomshom
Abstract: We propose a conceptual quantum-inspired model to describe subjective evaluation processes such as taste testing or consumer preference scoring-through the continuous time evolution of cognitive states represented on the Bloch sphere. Unlike conventional quantum cognition models that rely on projective measurements and state collapse, our framework treats evaluation as a weak or generalized measurement, preserving quantum coherence during the act of judgment. The mental state of preference is modeled as a coherent superposition in a two-dimensional Hilbert space, with time evolution governed by a stimulus-dependent Hamiltonian H(t), which reflects the sensory or motivational impact of external input. The observed score (e.g., 0 to 10) corresponds to the squared amplitude projected onto the "like" basis without collapsing the underlying state. For group-level analysis, we introduce a novel metric called "like-polarization", analogous to spin polarization, which quantifies the collective orientation of preferences. This model provides a physically motivated alternative to classical evaluation theories, offering insights into the reversibility, context-dependence, and temporal dynamics of human judgment. It further enables applications in behavioral science, affective computing, and the design of human-centered AI systems.

Title: Proximity-Induced Rashba Spin-Orbit Interaction in BaMnO$_\text{3}|$KTaO$_\text{3}$ Heterostructure for Antiferromagnetic Spintronics
Authors: Vivek Kumar, Nirmal Ganguli
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of Rashba-like spin-orbit interaction in the antiferromagnetic BaMnO$_3|$KTaO$_3$ oxide heterostructure using density functional theory (DFT). The analysis of our charge transfer model based on electrostatic potential reveals a type-I band alignment and establishes the conditions under which the interface becomes conducting. Our calculations uncover pronounced linear Rashba splitting ($\alpha_{(1)}$ = 0.114~eVÅ) in Mn 3$d$ bands near the Fermi level, induced by proximity to Ta 5$d$ orbitals of the KTO substrate. The heterostructure exhibits inversion asymmetry due to polar discontinuities at its $p$-type and $n$-type interfaces. Using three-dimensional band dispersions and projected spin textures along with isoenergetic contours obtained from DFT calculations, we confirm the linear Rashba nature of the spin-orbit coupling. Employing Monte Carlo simulations based on DFT-derived magnetic exchange interactions, we estimate a Néel temperature of approximately $\sim 54 \mathrm{~K}$. Our results demonstrate a viable route to engineering strong spin-orbit coupling in centrosymmetric antiferromagnets for spintronics applications.

Title: Enhancing van-Hove singularities in SrRuO$_3$ films by vacancy engineerings
Authors: Moon Hyoung Lee, Hyungwoo Lee, Jun-Won Rhim
Abstract: Flat bands, characterized by their localized electronic states and van Hove singularities, provide an ideal platform for exploring many-body physics. However, transition metal oxides hosting flat bands are quite rare. In this study, we investigate the origin of the existing nearly flat bands (NFBs) in SrRuO$_3$ thin films and demonstrate how to increase the number of them through structural modifications. Using a tight-binding model that replicates experimental band structures, we analyze the SrRuO$_3$ monolayer, revealing the origin of its NFBs along the $x$ and $y$ directions. These NFBs arise from destructive interference stabilizing strip-type compact localized states. By introducing periodic Ru-site vacancies, additional NFBs are generated, classified as partial or complete, depending on their Brillouin zone coverage. The compact localized states associated with these NFBs are identified, providing insight into their physical origin. For a 4-layer SrRuO$_3$ multilayer film, we uncover many partial NFBs along the $\Gamma$X and XM directions and reveal the distinct origin of their development. Our findings highlight the potential of engineering flat bands in SrRuO$_3$ films, offering new opportunities for exploring correlated electronic phases and expanding the material platform for flat-band physics.

Abstract: Magnetic flux trapping is a significant hurdle limiting reliability and scalability of superconducting electronics, yet tools for imaging flux vortices remain slow or insensitive. We present a cryogenic widefield NV-diamond magnetic microscope capable of rapid, micron-scale imaging of flux trapping in superconducting devices. Using this technique, we measure vortex expulsion fields in Nb thin films and patterned strips, revealing a crossover in expulsion behavior between $10$ and $20~\mu$m strip widths. The observed scaling agrees with theoretical models and suggests the influence of film defects on vortex expulsion dynamics. This instrument enables high-throughput magnetic characterization of superconducting materials and circuits, providing new insight for flux mitigation strategies in scalable superconducting electronics.

Title: Coarse-graining dynamics to maximize irreversibility
Authors: Qiwei Yu, Matthew P. Leighton, Christopher W. Lynn
Abstract: In many far-from-equilibrium biological systems, energy injected by irreversible processes at microscopic scales propagates to larger scales to fulfill important biological functions. But given dissipative dynamics at the microscale, how much irreversibility can persist at the macroscale? Here, we propose a model-free coarse-graining procedure that merges microscopic states to minimize the amount of lost irreversibility. Beginning with dynamical measurements, this procedure produces coarse-grained dynamics that retain as much information as possible about the underlying irreversibility. In synthetic and experimental data spanning molecular motors, biochemical oscillators, and recordings of neural activity, we derive simplified descriptions that capture the essential nonequilibrium processes. These results provide the tools to study the fundamental limits on the emergence of macroscopic irreversibility.

Title: Magnetic correlations in the $SU(3)$ triangular-lattice $t$-$J$ model at finite doping
Authors: Annika Böhler, Fabian Grusdt, Annabelle Bohrdt
Abstract: Quantum simulation platforms have become powerful tools for investigating strongly correlated systems beyond the capabilities of classical computation. Ultracold alkaline-earth atoms and molecules now enable experimental realizations of SU(N)-symmetric Fermi-Hubbard models, yet theoretical understanding of these systems, particularly at finite doping remains limited. Here we investigate the strong-coupling limit of the $SU(3)$ symmetric Fermi-Hubbard model on the triangular lattice with dimensions up to $9\times9$ lattice sites across the full doping range. Using a three-flavor extension of Gutzwiller-projected hidden fermion determinant states (G-HFDS), a neural network based variational ansatz, we analyze two- and three-point spin-spin and spin-spin-hole correlations of the $SU(3)$ Cartan generators. We further study binding energies for large periodic systems, and compare our results to the paradigmatic $SU(2)$ square lattice equivalent, finding strikingly similar magnetic correlations, but enhanced binding energies. Our results provide a foundation for future exploration of doped SU(N) Mott insulators, providing valuable insights for both theoretical developments and quantum simulation experiments.

Title: Statistical Interaction Driven Thermoelectricity and Violation of Wiedemann-Franz Law
Authors: Sampurna Karmakar, Amulya Ratnakar, Sourin Das
Abstract: Quantum transport anomalies in systems obeying Haldane-Wu fractional exclusion statistics, characterized by the statistical interactions parameter $g$ are investigated. We identify particle-hole symmetry breaking of the Haldane-Wu distribution function via its deviations of the maximum entropy ($\mathcal{S}_{g}^{max}$), evaluated at the chemical potential, from the value ${k_B} \ln 2$ (a value that holds only at the free fermion limit, $g=1$). A duality relation, $g\,\mathcal{S}_{g}^{max}=\mathcal{S}_{1/g}^{max}$, quantifying the degree of violation is obtained. This symmetry breaking manifests in transport phenomena as: significant violations of the Wiedemann-Franz law arising for $g>1$ (but remain absent for $g\leq 1$) across a broad temperature range. Moreover, the thermoelectric figure of merit $ZT$ is substantially enhanced for $g>1$ and suppressed for $g<1$, indicating new routes to optimize energy conversion. These results deepen the understanding of the interplay between equilibrium statistics and transport, suggesting avenues for engineering advanced thermoelectric materials.

Title: Multi-mode NOON states generation with ultracold atoms via geodesic counterdiabatic driving
Authors: Dengis Simon, Sandro Wimberger, Peter Schlagheck
Abstract: We present a protocol for the generation of NOON states with ultracold atoms, leveraging the Bose-Hubbard model in the self-trapping regime. By the means of an optimized adiabatic protocol, we achieve a significant reduction in the time required for the preparation of highly entangled NOON states, involving two or more modes. Our method saturates the quantum speed limit, ensuring both efficiency and high fidelity in state preparation. A detailed analysis of the geodesic counterdiabatic driving protocol and its application to the Bose-Hubbard system highlights its ability to expand the energy gap, facilitating faster adiabatic evolution. Through perturbation theory, we derive effective parameters that emulate the counterdiabatic Hamiltonian, enabling experimentally viable implementations with constant physical parameters. This approach is demonstrated to yield exponential time savings compared to standard geodesic driving, making it a powerful tool for creating complex entangled states for applications in quantum metrology and quantum information. Our findings pave the way for scalable and precise quantum state control in ultracold atomic systems.

Title: Characterization of atomization and delivery efficiency of exogenous surfactant in preterm infant lungs using an ex vivo respiratory model
Authors: Ghalia Kaouane, Jean-François Berret, Yannick Cremillieux, Noël Pinaud, Fanny Munsch, Bei Zhang, Michael Fayon, Rémy Gérard, Eric Dumas De La Roque, Sophie Perinel-Ragey, Lara Leclerc, Jérémie Pourchez
Abstract: Administration of pulmonary surfactant is crucial for the treatment of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in preterm infants. The aim of this study is to evaluate the potential of Curosurf atomization via the Endosurf device, a recently developed spray technology, as a promising approach for surfactant delivery in infants with RDS. A comprehensive analysis was performed to evaluate the physicochemical properties of atomized Curosurf, including its surface tension and rheology. The size distribution of Curosurf vesicles was also investigated. An ex vivo respiratory model based on rabbit lungs breathing through an instrumented hypobaric chamber representing the thorax of a preterm infant was developed to provide proof of concept for regional aerosol deposition of atomized Curosurf. The atomization of Curosurf with the innovative Endosurf device did not significantly alter surface tension, but reduced vesicle size and promoted homogeneous distribution of Curosurf in the lungs. Rheological measurements showed the viscoelastic complexity of atomized Curosurf. This preliminary study confirmed the promising potential of Curosurf atomization via the Endosurf device for the distribution of surfactant in the lungs of infants with RDS. These advances could help to improve the treatment of RDS in preterm infants and offer new perspectives for healthcare professionals and affected families.

Title: Tensor Network for Anomaly Detection in the Latent Space of Proton Collision Events at the LHC
Authors: Ema Puljak, Maurizio Pierini, Artur Garcia-Saez
Abstract: The pursuit of discovering new phenomena at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) demands constant innovation in algorithms and technologies. Tensor networks are mathematical models on the intersection of classical and quantum machine learning, which present a promising and efficient alternative for tackling these challenges. In this work, we propose a tensor network-based strategy for anomaly detection at the LHC and demonstrate its superior performance in identifying new phenomena compared to established quantum methods. Our model is a parametrized Matrix Product State with an isometric feature map, processing a latent representation of simulated LHC data generated by an autoencoder. Our results highlight the potential of tensor networks to enhance new-physics discovery.

Title: Dark Matter Haloscope with a Disordered Dielectric Absorber
Authors: Stewart Koppell, Otavio D. A. R. Bittencourt, Dip Joti Paul, Junwu Huang, Masha Baryakhtar, Karl K. Berggren
Abstract: Light dark matter candidates such as axions and dark photons generically couple to electromagnetism, yielding dark-matter-to-photon conversion as a key search strategy. In addition to resonant conversion in cavities and circuits, light dark matter bosons efficiently convert to photons on material interfaces, with a broadband power proportional to the total area of these interfaces. In this work, we make use of interface conversion to develop a new experimental dark matter detector design: the disordered dielectric detector. We show that a volume filled with dielectric powder is an efficient, robust, and broadband target for axion-to-photon or dark-photon-to-photon conversion. We perform semi-analytical and numerical studies in small-volume 2D and 3D disordered systems to compute the conversion power as a function of dark matter mass. We also discuss the power gathered onto a sensitive photodetector in terms of the bulk properties of the disordered material, making it possible to characterize the predicted dark-matter-to-photon conversion rate across a wide range of wavelengths. Finally, we propose DPHaSE: the Dielectric Powder Haloscope SNSPD Experiment which is composed of a disordered dielectric target, a veto system, and a photon collection chamber to maximize the coupling between the powder target and a low noise superconducting nanowire single photon detector (SNSPD). The projected reach, in the 10 meV-eV mass range, is sensitive to QCD axion-photon couplings and exceeds current constraints on dark photon dark matter by up to 5 orders of magnitude.

Title: Fermionic Magic Resources of Quantum Many-Body Systems
Authors: Piotr Sierant, Paolo Stornati, Xhek Turkeshi
Abstract: Understanding the computational complexity of quantum states is a central challenge in quantum many-body physics. In qubit systems, fermionic Gaussian states can be efficiently simulated on classical computers and hence can be employed as a natural baseline for evaluating quantum complexity. In this work, we develop a framework for quantifying fermionic magic resources, also referred to as fermionic non-Gaussianity, which constitutes an essential resource for universal quantum computation. We leverage the algebraic structure of the fermionic commutant to define the fermionic antiflatness (FAF)-an efficiently computable and experimentally accessible measure of non-Gaussianity, with a clear physical interpretation in terms of Majorana fermion correlation functions. Studying systems in equilibrium, we show that FAF detects phase transitions, reveals universal features of critical points, and uncovers special solvable points in many-body systems. Extending the analysis to out-of-equilibrium settings, we demonstrate that fermionic magic resources become more abundant in highly excited eigenstates of many-body systems. We further investigate the growth and saturation of FAF under ergodic many-body dynamics, highlighting the roles of conservation laws and locality in constraining the increase of non-Gaussianity during unitary evolution. This work provides a framework for probing quantum many-body complexity from the perspective of fermionic Gaussian states and opens up new directions for investigating fermionic magic resources in many-body systems. Our results establish fermionic non-Gaussianity, alongside entanglement and non-stabilizerness, as a resource relevant not only to foundational studies but also to experimental platforms aiming to achieve quantum advantage.

Authors: S. Weeden, D. C. Harrison, S. Patel, M. Snyder, E. J. Blackwell, G. Spahn, S. Abdullah, Y. Takeda, B. L. T. Plourde, J. M. Martinis, R. McDermott
Abstract: Decoherence in superconducting qubits is dominated by defects that reside at amorphous interfaces. Interaction with discrete defects results in dropouts that complicate qubit operation and lead to nongaussian tails in the distribution of qubit energy relaxation time $T_1$ that degrade system performance. Spectral diffusion of defects over time leads to fluctuations in $T_1$, posing a challenge for calibration. In this work, we measure the energy relaxation of flux-tunable transmons over a range of operating frequencies. We vary qubit geometry to change the interface participation ratio by more than an order of magnitude. Our results are consistent with loss dominated by discrete interfacial defects. Moreover, we are able to localize the dominant defects to within 500 nm of the qubit junctions, where residues from liftoff are present. These results motivate new approaches to qubit junction fabrication that avoid the residues intrinsic to the liftoff process.

Title: MOFGPT: Generative Design of Metal-Organic Frameworks using Language Models
Authors: Srivathsan Badrinarayanan, Rishikesh Magar, Akshay Antony, Radheesh Sharma Meda, Amir Barati Farimani
Abstract: The discovery of Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) with application-specific properties remains a central challenge in materials chemistry, owing to the immense size and complexity of their structural design space. Conventional computational screening techniques such as molecular simulations and density functional theory (DFT), while accurate, are computationally prohibitive at scale. Machine learning offers an exciting alternative by leveraging data-driven approaches to accelerate materials discovery. The complexity of MOFs, with their extended periodic structures and diverse topologies, creates both opportunities and challenges for generative modeling approaches. To address these challenges, we present a reinforcement learning-enhanced, transformer-based framework for the de novo design of MOFs. Central to our approach is MOFid, a chemically-informed string representation encoding both connectivity and topology, enabling scalable generative modeling. Our pipeline comprises three components: (1) a generative GPT model trained on MOFid sequences, (2) MOFormer, a transformer-based property predictor, and (3) a reinforcement learning (RL) module that optimizes generated candidates via property-guided reward functions. By integrating property feedback into sequence generation, our method drives the model toward synthesizable, topologically valid MOFs with desired functional attributes. This work demonstrates the potential of large language models, when coupled with reinforcement learning, to accelerate inverse design in reticular chemistry and unlock new frontiers in computational MOF discovery.

Title: Symbolic Hamiltonian Compiler for Hybrid Qubit-Boson Processors
Authors: Ethan Decker, Erik Gustafson, Evan McKinney, Alex K. Jones, Lucas Goetz, Ang Li, Alexander Schuckert, Samuel Stein, Gushu Li, Eleanor Crane
Abstract: Quantum simulation of the interactions of fermions and bosons -- the fundamental particles of nature -- is essential for modeling complex quantum systems in material science, chemistry and high-energy physics and has been proposed as a promising application of fermion-boson quantum computers, which overcome the overhead encountered in mapping fermions and bosons to qubits. However, compiling the simulation of specific fermion-boson Hamiltonians into the natively available fermion-boson gate set is challenging. In particular, the large local dimension of bosons renders matrix-based compilation methods, as used for qubits and in existing tools such as Bosonic Qiskit or OpenFermion, challenging. We overcome this issue by introducing a novel symbolic compiler based on matrix-free symbolic manipulation of second quantised Hamiltonians, which automates the decomposition of fermion-boson second quantized problems into qubit-boson instruction set architectures. This integration establishes a comprehensive pipeline for simulating quantum systems on emerging qubit-boson and fermion-boson hardware, paving the way for their large-scale usage.

Title: Beyond Atomic Geometry Representations in Materials Science: A Human-in-the-Loop Multimodal Framework
Authors: Can Polat, Hasan Kurban, Erchin Serpedin, Mustafa Kurban
Abstract: Most materials science datasets are limited to atomic geometries (e.g., XYZ files), restricting their utility for multimodal learning and comprehensive data-centric analysis. These constraints have historically impeded the adoption of advanced machine learning techniques in the field. This work introduces MultiCrystalSpectrumSet (MCS-Set), a curated framework that expands materials datasets by integrating atomic structures with 2D projections and structured textual annotations, including lattice parameters and coordination metrics. MCS-Set enables two key tasks: (1) multimodal property and summary prediction, and (2) constrained crystal generation with partial cluster supervision. Leveraging a human-in-the-loop pipeline, MCS-Set combines domain expertise with standardized descriptors for high-quality annotation. Evaluations using state-of-the-art language and vision-language models reveal substantial modality-specific performance gaps and highlight the importance of annotation quality for generalization. MCS-Set offers a foundation for benchmarking multimodal models, advancing annotation practices, and promoting accessible, versatile materials science datasets. The dataset and implementations are available at this https URL.

Title: Chemotaxis-Driven Instabilities Govern Size, Shape and Migration Efficiency of Multicellular Clusters
Authors: Monika Sanoria, Gema Malet-Engra, Giorgio Scita, Nir Gov, Ajay Gopinathan
Abstract: The collective chemotaxis of multicellular clusters is an important phenomenon in various physiological contexts, ranging from embryonic development to cancer metastasis. Such clusters often display interesting shape dynamics and instabilities, but their physical origin, functional benefits, and role in overall chemotactic migration remain unclear. Here, we combine computational modeling and experimental observations of malignant lymphocyte cluster migration in vitro to understand how these dynamics arise from an interplay of chemotactic response and inter-cellular interactions. Our cell-based computational model incorporates active propulsion of cells, contact inhibition of locomotion, chemoattractant response, as well as alignment, adhesive, and exclusion interactions between cells. We find that clusters remain fluid and maintain cohesive forward migration in low chemoattractant gradients. However, above a threshold gradient, clusters display an instability driven by local cluster-shape dependent velocity differentials that causes them to elongate perpendicular to the gradient and eventually break apart. Comparison with our in vitro data shows the predicted transition to the cluster instability regime with increased gradient, as well as quantitative agreement with key features such as cluster aspect ratio, orientation, and breaking frequency. This instability naturally limits the size of multicellular aggregates, and, in addition, clusters in the instability regime display optimal forward migration speeds, suggesting functional implications in vivo. Our work provides valuable insights into generic instabilities of chemotactic clusters, elucidates physical factors that could contribute to metastatic spreading, and can be extended to other living or synthetic systems of active clusters.

Title: Chaotic dynamics of Bose-Einstein condensates in a tilted optical lattice
Authors: C. Selvaraju, S. Sabari, O.T. Lekeufack, F. Kenmogne, N. Athavan
Abstract: This study investigates the emergence of chaotic dynamics in Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) subjected to both alternating (AC) and constant (DC) components of the interaction strength, modeled through the scattering length. We systematically explore how the interplay of AC and DC nonlinearities affect the dynamical evolution of the condensate under a tilted optical lattice potential. Various types of chaos are identified across different parametric regimes, with numerical simulations revealing a clear distinction between regular and chaotic domains. The width of the regular domains is quantified, and the influence of AC and DC components in promoting stochastic behavior is highlighted. Lyapunov exponents, Poincaré sections, and other chaos indicators then confirm the transition to chaotic dynamics, in agreement with analytical expectations. A qualitative conjecture is proposed for the role of these interactions in BEC stabilization. Our findings offer insights into the dynamic control of BECs, with potential applications in quantum simulation and coherent matter-wave engineering, in line with entanglement and quantum transport, that are crucial for developing robust and reliable quantum technologies.

Title: Foundations of the ionization potential condition for localized electron removal in density functional theory
Authors: Guy Ohad, María Camarasa-Gómez, Jeffrey B. Neaton, Ashwin Ramasubramaniam, Tim Gould, Leeor Kronik
Abstract: Optimal tuning of functional parameters in density functional theory approximations, based on enforcing the ionization potential theorem, has emerged as the method of choice for the non-empirical prediction of the electronic structure of finite systems. This method has recently been extended to the bulk limit, based on an ansatz that generalizes the ionization potential theorem to the removal of an electron from a localized Wannier orbital. This Wannier-localization based optimal tuning method has been shown to be highly successful for a wide range of periodic systems, accurately predicting electronic and optical properties. However, a rigorous theoretical justification for its foundational ansatz has been lacking. Here, we establish an ionization potential condition for the removal of a localized electron, by extending the piecewise linearity and Janak's theorems in density functional theory. We also provide numerical evidence supporting our theory.

Title: Coherent error induced phase transition
Authors: Hanchen Liu, Xiao Chen
Abstract: We investigate the stability of logical information in quantum stabilizer codes subject to coherent unitary errors. Beginning with a logical state, we apply a random unitary error channel and subsequently measure stabilizer checks, resulting in a syndrome-dependent post-measurement state. By examining both this syndrome state and the associated syndrome distribution, we identify a phase transition in the behavior of the logical state. Below a critical error threshold pc, the syndrome state remains in the same logical state, enabling successful recovery of the code's logical information via suitable error-correction protocols. Above pc, however, the syndrome state shifts to a different logical state, signaling the breakdown of efficient error correction. Notably, this process can often induce an effective unitary rotation within the logical space. This transition is accompanied by qualitative changes in both the global and local features of the syndrome distribution. We refer to this phenomenon as a coherent error induced phase transition. To illustrate this transition, we present two classes of quantum error correcting code models the toric code and non-local random stabilizer codes thereby shedding light on the design and performance limits of quantum error correction under coherent errors.

Title: Evidence for supramolecular dynamics of non-hydrogen bonding polar van der Waals liquids
Authors: Shalin Patil, Catalin Gainaru, Roland Böhmer, Shiwang Cheng
Abstract: Non-hydrogen bonding van der Waals liquids with dipole-dipole interactions are typically viewed as non-associative and not considered able to sustain large supramolecular structures. Combining broadband dielectric spectroscopy (BDS) and rheology, we demonstrate the supramolecular formation in a group of non-hydrogen-bonding van der Waals liquids, i.e. 1-bromo-2-ethylhexane, 1-chloro-2-ethylhexane, and 1-bromo-3,7-dimethyloctane. BDS shows an emergence of a Debye-like process slower than their structural relaxation, which follows super-Arrhenius temperature dependence. Meanwhile, rheological measurements reveal a noticeable dynamical separation between the terminal relaxation and the structural rearrangements. Interestingly, the rheological terminal time agrees remarkably well with the dielectric Debye-like relaxation time, pointing to a strong coupling between the terminal flow and the supramolecular dynamics of these van der Waals liquids. These results highlight the role of intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions on the structure and slow dynamics of van der Waals liquids.

Title: A Simple Iterative Approach for Constant Chemical Potential Simulations at Interfaces
Authors: Ademola Soyemi, Khagendra Baral, Tibor Szilvasi
Abstract: Chemical potential of species in solution is essential for understanding various chemical processes at interfaces. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, constrained by fixed compositions, cannot satisfy a constant chemical potential condition as solute species can migrate to the interface and deplete the bulk due to solute-interface interactions. In this study, we introduce a simple and computationally efficient approach named iterative constant chemical potential molecular dynamics (iCuMD) simulation, which helps simulate targeted molar concentrations of species in solution. iCuMD overcomes the limitations of conventional MD by adjusting the number of species in the solution to reach a target concentration (chemical potential). We demonstrate our approach using solid-liquid and liquid-air interfacial systems as case studies. Specifically, we perform classical force field-based MD simulations of NaCl(aq)-air and NaCl(aq)-graphite interfaces and machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP)-based MD simulations of the Na2SO4(aq)-graphene interface. Our results show that the iCuMD approach efficiently achieves the desired bulk ion concentration within two iterations and can also be integrated with MLIP-driven simulations which enable constant potential simulations with DFT-level accuracy. We show that iCuMD offers a robust and simple computational framework for constant chemical potential simulations as its only requirement is to be able to converge interfacial simulations with a measurable bulk region.

Title: Correlation Functions and Chaotic Behavior of the SYK Chain Model in Pure States
Authors: Seyyed M.H. Halataei
Abstract: Recent investigations of Rényi entanglement entropy in the SYK chain of Majorana fermions have indicated that the model exhibits slow thermalization when initialized in certain states. The extent to which the heavy modes -- believed to underlie this behavior -- affect other aspects of the model remains an open question. In this work, I study thermalization and scrambling of information in individual energy eigenstates of the SYK chain using exact diagonalization. I show that two-point correlation functions in finite-energy eigenstates closely match their thermal counterparts and that information scrambling occurs efficiently within these pure states. These results suggest that the slow thermalization observed in entanglement dynamics does not extend to all probes of thermalization and scrambling, even in pure states. I discuss the implications of these findings for thermal states in a potential holographic dual theory.

Title: Dynamic Space Filling
Authors: P. L. Krapivsky
Abstract: Dynamic space filling (DSF) is a stochastic process defined on any connected graph. Each vertex can host an arbitrary number of particles forming a pile, with every arriving particle landing on the top of the pile. Particles in a pile, except for the particle at the bottom, can hop to neighboring vertices. Eligible particles hop independently and stochastically, with the overall hopping rate set to unity for every eligible particle at every vertex. When the number of vertices in a graph is equal to the total number of particles, the evolution stops at the moment when every vertex gets occupied by a single particle. We determine the halting time distribution on complete graphs. Using the mapping of the DSF into a two-species annihilation process, we argue that on $d-$dimensional tori with $N\gg 1$ vertices, the average halting time scales with the number of vertices as $N^{4/d}$ when $d\leq 4$ and as $N$ when $d>4$.

Title: A large magneto-optical trap of cadmium atoms loaded from a cryogenic buffer gas beam
Authors: J. E. Padilla-Castillo, S. Hofsäss, L. Palánki, J. Cai, C. J. H. Rich, R. Thomas, S. Kray, G. Meijer, S. C. Wright, S. Truppe
Abstract: We demonstrate rapid loading of a magneto-optical trap (MOT) of cadmium atoms from a pulsed cryogenic helium buffer gas beam, overcoming strong photoionization losses. Using the $ ^1S_0 \rightarrow{} ^1P_1 $ transition at 229 nm, we capture up to $ 1.1(2) \times 10^7$ $^{112}$Cd atoms in 10 ms, achieving a peak density of $2.5 \times 10^{11}$cm$^{-3}$ and a phase-space density of $ 2 \times 10^{-9} $. The large scattering force in the deep ultraviolet enables Zeeman slowing within 5 cm of the trap, yielding a capture velocity exceeding 200 m/s. We measure the MOT trap frequency and damping constant, and determine the absolute photoionization cross section of the $^1P_1 $ state. Photoionization losses are mitigated via dynamic detuning of the trapping light's frequency, allowing efficient accumulation of multiple atomic pulses. Our results demonstrate the benefits of deep-UV (DUV) transitions and cryogenic beams for loading high-density MOTs, especially for species with significant loss channels in their main cooling cycle. The cadmium MOT provides a robust testbed that benchmarks our DUV laser cooling system and establishes the foundation for trapping and cooling polar AlF molecules, which share many optical and structural properties with Cd.

Title: Quantum-Classical Embedding via Ghost Gutzwiller Approximation for Enhanced Simulations of Correlated Electron Systems
Authors: I-Chi Chen, Aleksei Khindanov, Carlos Salazar, Humberto Munoz Barona, Feng Zhang, Cai-Zhuang Wang, Thomas Iadecola, Nicola Lanatà, Yong-Xin Yao
Abstract: Simulating correlated materials on present-day quantum hardware remains challenging due to limited quantum resources. Quantum embedding methods offer a promising route by reducing computational complexity through the mapping of bulk systems onto effective impurity models, allowing more feasible simulations on pre- and early-fault-tolerant quantum devices. This work develops a quantum-classical embedding framework based on the ghost Gutzwiller approximation to enable quantum-enhanced simulations of ground-state properties and spectral functions of correlated electron systems. Circuit complexity is analyzed using an adaptive variational quantum algorithm on a statevector simulator, applied to the infinite-dimensional Hubbard model with increasing ghost mode numbers from 3 to 5, resulting in circuit depths growing from 16 to 104. Noise effects are examined using a realistic error model, revealing significant impact on the spectral weight of the Hubbard bands. To mitigate these effects, the Iceberg quantum error detection code is employed, achieving up to 40% error reduction in simulations. Finally, the accuracy of the density matrix estimation is benchmarked on IBM and Quantinuum quantum hardware, featuring distinct qubit-connectivity and employing multiple levels of error mitigation techniques.

Title: Polariton Chern Bands in 2D Photonic Crystals Beyond Dirac Cones
Authors: Xin Xie, Kai Sun, Hui Deng
Abstract: Polaritons, formed by strong light-matter interactions, open new avenues for studying topological phases, where the spatial and time symmetries can be controlled via the light and matter components, respectively. However, most research on topological polaritons has been confined to hexagonal photonic lattices featuring Dirac cones at large wavenumbers. This restricts key topological properties and device performance, including sub-meV gap sizes that hinder further experimental investigations and future applications of polariton Chern insulator systems. In this study, we move beyond the traditional Dirac cone framework and introduce two alternative band structures in photonic crystals (PhCs) as promising platforms for realizing polariton Chern bands: bands with symmetry-protected bound states in the continuum (BICs) and bands with symmetry-protected degeneracies at the $\Gamma$ points. These band structures are prevalent in various PhC lattices and have features crucial for experimental studies. We show examples of higher Chern number bands, more uniform Berry curvature distributions, and an experimentally feasible system capable of achieving a large topological gap. Our findings show the broad applicability of polariton Chern bands in 2D PhCs, provide design principles for enhancing the functionality and performance of topological photonic devices, opening up exciting possibilities for better understanding and using topological physics.

Title: 2D material exciton-polariton transport on 2D photonic crystals
Authors: Xin Xie, Qiuyang Li, Chenxi Liu, Yuze Liu, Chulwon Lee, Kai Sun, Hui Deng
Abstract: Transport of elementary excitations is a fundamental property of 2D semiconductors, important for wide-ranging emergent phenomena and device applications. While exciton transport reported in 2D materials barely exceeds 1-2 $\mu$m, coherent coupling of excitons with photons to form polaritons allows not only greatly enhanced transport length, but also the potential to leverage photonic mode engineering for novel transport properties. However, conventional vertical cavity or waveguide polaritons are difficult to tune or integrate into photonic circuits. Here, we report the transport of transition-metal dichalcogenide polaritons in slab 2D photonic crystals that are highly versatile for tuning, mode-engineering and integration. We show an order-of-magnitude enhancement of the transport length compared to that of bare excitons. We further show the dependence of transport on the polariton dispersion and population dynamics, which we control by varying the photonic crystal design and pumping intensity. Stimulated relaxation observed in the system suggests the potential for forming superfluid polaritons with frictionless transport. These results demonstrate the 2D photonic crystal polariton system as a versatile platform to enhance and manipulate energy transport for novel photonic technologies.

Title: Neural-network-assisted Monte Carlo sampling trained by Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm
Authors: Yuichiro Nakano, Ken N. Okada, Keisuke Fujii
Abstract: Sampling problems are widely regarded as the task for which quantum computers can most readily provide a quantum advantage. Leveraging this feature, the quantum-enhanced Markov chain Monte Carlo [Layden, D. et al., Nature 619, 282-287 (2023)] has been proposed recently, where sampling from a quantum computer is used as a proposal distribution and convergence to a target distribution is accelerated. However, guaranteeing convergence to the target distribution typically forces one to impose restrictive symmetry constraints on the quantum circuit, which makes it hard to design good proposal distributions and prevents making full use of the advantage of a quantum computer. We explore a hybrid quantum-classical MCMC framework that combines a quantum circuit with a generative neural sampler (GNS). The GNS is trained on quantum samples and acts as a classical surrogate to efficiently emulate quantum outputs, thereby lifting circuit constraints. We apply this method to Boltzmann sampling of spin glasses using proposals trained with a QAOA circuit. This approach outperforms conventional methods, showing a $\sim$100$\times$ improvement in spectral gap over uniform proposals. Notably, it maintains similar acceleration even without parameter optimization. These results establish the method as a viable sampling-based quantum algorithm for NISQ devices and highlight its potential for solving practical problems with quantum computation.

Title: Alignment Phase Transition in Socially Driven Motion
Authors: Debasish Sarker, Yi Zhang, Lynn K. Perry, Daniel S. Messinger, Chaoming Song
Abstract: Collective human movement is a hallmark of complex systems, exhibiting emergent order across diverse settings, from pedestrian flows to biological collectives. In high-speed scenarios, alignment interactions ensure efficient flow and navigation. In contrast, alignment in low-speed, socially engaged contexts emerges not from locomotion goals but from interpersonal interaction. Using high-resolution spatial and orientation data from preschool classrooms, we uncover a sharp, distance-dependent transition in pairwise alignment patterns that reflects a spontaneous symmetry breaking between distinct behavioral phases. Below a critical threshold of approximately 0.65\,m, individuals predominantly align side-by-side; beyond this range, face-to-face orientations prevail. We show that this transition arises from a distance-dependent competition among three alignment mechanisms: parallelization, opposition, and reciprocation, whose interplay generates a bifurcation structure in the effective interaction potential. A Fourier-based decomposition of empirical orientation distributions reveals these mechanisms, enabling the construction of a minimal pseudo-potential model that captures the alignment transition as a non-equilibrium phase transition. Monte Carlo simulations using the inferred interaction terms closely reproduce the empirical patterns. These findings establish a quantitative framework for social alignment in low-speed human motion, extending active matter theory to a previously unexplored regime of socially mediated orientation dynamics, with implications for modeling coordination and control in biological collectives and artificial swarms.

Title: Bayes optimal learning of attention-indexed models
Authors: Fabrizio Boncoraglio, Emanuele Troiani, Vittorio Erba, Lenka Zdeborová
Abstract: We introduce the attention-indexed model (AIM), a theoretical framework for analyzing learning in deep attention layers. Inspired by multi-index models, AIM captures how token-level outputs emerge from layered bilinear interactions over high-dimensional embeddings. Unlike prior tractable attention models, AIM allows full-width key and query matrices, aligning more closely with practical transformers. Using tools from statistical mechanics and random matrix theory, we derive closed-form predictions for Bayes-optimal generalization error and identify sharp phase transitions as a function of sample complexity, model width, and sequence length. We propose a matching approximate message passing algorithm and show that gradient descent can reach optimal performance. AIM offers a solvable playground for understanding learning in modern attention architectures.

Title: Understanding synchronization between quantum self-sustained oscillators through coherence generation
Authors: Mohit Kumar, Bijay Kumar Agarwalla
Abstract: Understanding the origin of phase synchronization between quantum self-sustained oscillators has garnered significant interest in recent years. In this work, we study phase synchronization in three settings: between two continuous-variable oscillators, between two arbitrary quantum spins, and within a hybrid setup involving a spin and an oscillator. We derive a simple and general condition on the elements of the joint density matrix that must be satisfied for them to contribute to the relative phase distribution. In particular, we identify the subset of coherence elements in the joint density matrix that serve as key resources for enabling quantum phase synchronization. Our theory is validated against the previously proposed interaction models known to induce synchronization between the self-sustained oscillators. Moreover, our approach offers valuable insights into the relationship between phase synchronization and various information-theoretic measures.

Title: Toward extracting scattering phase shift from integrated correlation functions IV: Coulomb corrections
Authors: Peng Guo, Frank X. Lee
Abstract: The formalism developed in Refs.~\cite{Guo:2023ecc,Guo:2024zal,Guo:2024pvt} that relates the integrated correlation functions for a trapped system to the infinite volume scattering phase shifts through a weighted integral is further extended to include Coulomb interaction between charged particles. The original formalism cannot be applied due to different divergent asymptotic behavior resulting from the long-range nature of the Coulomb force. We show that a modified formula in which the difference of integrated correlation functions between particles interacting with Coulomb plus short-range interaction and with Coulomb interaction alone is free of divergence, and has rapid approach to its infinite volume limit. Using an exactly solvable model, we demonstrate that the short-range potential scattering phase shifts can be reliably extracted from the formula in the presence of Coulomb interaction.

Title: Emergence of thermodynamic functioning regimes from finite coupling between a quantum thermal machine and a load
Authors: Gauthameshwar S., Noufal Jaseem, Dario Poletti
Abstract: Autonomous quantum thermal machines are particularly suited to understand how correlations between thermal baths, a load, and a thermal machine affect the overall thermodynamic functioning of the setup. Here, we show that by tuning the operating temperatures and the magnitude of the coupling between machine and load, the thermal machine can operate in four modes: engine, accelerator, heater, or refrigerator. In particular, we show that as we increase the coupling strength, the engine mode is suppressed, and the refrigerator mode is no longer attainable, leaving the heater as the most pronounced functioning modality, followed by the accelerator. This regime switching can be amplified by quantum effects, such as the bosonic enhancement factor for a harmonic oscillator load, which modifies the effective machine-load coupling, making the thermodynamic functioning sensitive to the initial preparation of the load.

Title: Benchmarking Universal Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials for Real-Time Analysis of Inelastic Neutron Scattering Data
Authors: Bowen Han, Yongqiang Cheng
Abstract: The accurate calculation of phonons and vibrational spectra remains a significant challenge, requiring highly precise evaluations of interatomic forces. Traditional methods based on the quantum description of the electronic structure, while widely used, are computationally expensive and demand substantial expertise. Emerging universal machine learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs) offer a transformative alternative by employing pre-trained neural network surrogates to predict interatomic forces directly from atomic coordinates. This approach dramatically reduces computation time and minimizes the need for technical knowledge. In this paper, we produce a phonon database comprising nearly 5,000 inorganic crystals to benchmark the performance of several leading uMLIPs. We further assess these models in real-world applications by using them to analyze experimental inelastic neutron scattering data collected on a variety of materials. Through detailed comparisons, we identify the strengths and limitations of these uMLIPs, providing insights into their accuracy and suitability for fast calculations of phonons and related properties, as well as for real-time interpretation of neutron scattering spectra. Our findings highlight how the rapid advancement of AI in science is revolutionizing experimental research and data analysis.

Title: NepTrain and NepTrainKit: Automated Active Learning and Visualization Toolkit for Neuroevolution Potentials
Authors: Chengbing Chen, Yutong Li, Rui Zhao, Zhoulin Liu, Zheyong Fan, Gang Tang, Zhiyong Wang
Abstract: As a machine-learned potential, the neuroevolution potential (NEP) method features exceptional computational efficiency and has been successfully applied in materials science. Constructing high-quality training datasets is crucial for developing accurate NEP models. However, the preparation and screening of NEP training datasets remain a bottleneck for broader applications due to their time-consuming, labor-intensive, and resource-intensive nature. In this work, we have developed NepTrain and NepTrainKit, which are dedicated to initializing and managing training datasets to generate high-quality training sets while automating NEP model training. NepTrain is an open-source Python package that features a bond length filtering method to effectively identify and remove non-physical structures from molecular dynamics trajectories, thereby ensuring high-quality training datasets. NepTrainKit is a graphical user interface (GUI) software designed specifically for NEP training datasets, providing functionalities for data editing, visualization, and interactive exploration. It integrates key features such as outlier identification, farthest-point sampling, non-physical structure detection, and configuration type selection. The combination of these tools enables users to process datasets more efficiently and conveniently. Using $\rm CsPbI_3$ as a case study, we demonstrate the complete workflow for training NEP models with NepTrain and further validate the models through materials property predictions. We believe this toolkit will greatly benefit researchers working with machine learning interatomic potentials.

Title: Probing Quantum Spin Systems with Kolmogorov-Arnold Neural Network Quantum States
Authors: Mahmud Ashraf Shamim, Eric Reinhardt, Talal Ahmed Chowdhury, Sergei Gleyzer, Paulo T Araujo
Abstract: Neural Quantum States (NQS) are a class of variational wave functions parametrized by neural networks (NNs) to study quantum many-body systems. In this work, we propose SineKAN, the NQS ansatz based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), to represent quantum mechanical wave functions as nested univariate functions. We show that \sk wavefunction with learnable sinusoidal activation functions can capture the ground state energies, fidelities and various correlation functions of the 1D Transverse-Field Ising model, Anisotropic Heisenberg model, and Antiferromagnetic $J_{1}-J_{2}$ model with different chain lengths. In our study of the $J_1-J_2$ model with $L=100$ sites, we find that the SineKAN model outperforms several previously explored neural quantum state ansätze, including Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), Long Short-Term Memory models (LSTMs), and Feed-Forward Neural Networks (FFCN), when compared to the results obtained from the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm.

Title: A Concurrent Multiscale Framework Coupling Direct Simulation Monte Carlo and Molecular Dynamics
Authors: Tim Linke, Dane Sterbentz, Niels Grønbech-Jensen, Jean-Pierre Delplanque, Jonathan Belof
Abstract: We present a new method to couple the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) algorithm with molecular dynamics (MD). The coupling approach generalizes prior coupling methods using a cell-based decision. The approach is supported by a lifting and restricting operator, which translate length and time scales between DSMC and MD. We verify the framework on basic conservation laws, and demonstrate its usability on a hypersonic flow example. Its accuracy gain is discussed in light of conventional DSMC simulations. Advantages and limitations are discussed, and additional use cases are highlighted.

Title: Violation of Universal Operator Growth Hypothesis in $W_3$ Conformal Field Theories
Authors: Dileep P. Jatkar, Sujoy Mahato, Sukrut Mondkar, Praveen Thalore
Abstract: We show that a large central charge conformal field theory with $W_3$ symmetry exhibits violation of the conjectured operator growth bound if the Liouvillian is modified to incorporate $W_3$ generators. We get 23 classes of Lanczos coefficients, obtained by the action of the Liouvillian on a descendant state. Among these, 10 classes of Lanczos coefficients violate the conjectured upper bound by exhibiting a faster than linear growth with descendant level $N$. Two classes of them have asymptotic growth saturating at $N^2$.

Title: Energies for elastic plates and shells from quadratic-stretch elasticity
Authors: E. Vitral, J. A. Hanna
Abstract: We derive stretching and bending energies for isotropic elastic plates and shells. Through the dimensional reduction of a bulk elastic energy quadratic in Biot strains, we obtain two-dimensional bending energies quadratic in bending measures featuring a bilinear coupling of stretches and geometric curvatures. For plates, the bending measure is invariant under spatial dilations and naturally extends primitive bending strains for straight rods. For shells or naturally-curved rods, the measure is not dilation invariant, and contrasts with previous \emph{ad hoc} postulated forms. The corresponding field equations and boundary conditions feature moments linear in the bending measures, and a decoupling of stretching and bending such that application of a pure moment results in isometric deformation of a unique neutral surface, primitive behaviors in agreement with classical linear response but not displayed by commonly used analytical models. We briefly comment on relations between our energies, those derived from a neo-Hookean bulk energy, and a commonly used discrete model for flat membranes. Although the derivation requires consideration of stretch and rotation fields, the resulting energy and field equations can be expressed entirely in terms of metric and curvature components of deformed and reference surfaces.

Title: Topological holography, quantum criticality, and boundary states
Authors: Sheng-Jie Huang, Meng Cheng
Abstract: Topological holography is a holographic principle that describes the generalized global symmetry of a local quantum system in terms of a topological order in one higher dimension. This framework separates the topological data from the local dynamics of a theory and provides a unified description of the symmetry and duality in gapped and gapless phases of matter. In this work, we develop the topological holographic picture for (1+1)d quantum phases, including both gapped phases as well as a wide range of quantum critical points, including phase transitions between symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases, symmetry enriched quantum critical points, deconfined quantum critical points, and intrinsically gapless SPT phases. Topological holography puts a strong constraint on the emergent symmetry and the anomaly for these critical theories. We show how the partition functions of these critical points can be obtained from dualizing (orbifolding) more familiar critical theories. The topological responses of the defect operators are also discussed in this framework. We further develop a topological holographic picture for conformal boundary states of (1+1)d rational conformal field theories. This framework provides a simple physical picture to understand conformal boundary states and also uncovers the nature of the gapped phases corresponding to the boundary states.

Title: Adiabatic observables and Berry curvatures in insulators and metals
Authors: Raffaele Resta
Abstract: A sharp definition of what "adiabatic" means is given; it is then shown that the time-dependent expectation value of a quantum-mechanical observable in the adiabatic limit can be expressed -- in many cases -- by means of the appropriate Berry curvature. Condensed-matter observables belonging to this class include: Born effective charges in insulators and in metals, quantized Faraday charges in electrolytes, and linear dc conductivities (longitudinal and transverse). Remarkably, the adiabatic limit is well defined even in metals, despite the absence of a spectral gap therein. For all of the above observables the explicit Berry-curvature expressions are derived in a general many-body setting, which also allows for compact and very transparent notations and formulas. Their conversion into band-structure formulas in the independent-electron crystalline case is straightforward.

Title: Quantum dynamics of semiconductor quantum dot Josephson junctions
Authors: Utkan Güngördü, Rusko Ruskov, Silas Hoffman, Kyle Serniak, Andrew J. Kerman, Charles Tahan
Abstract: Josephson junctions constructed from superconductor-semiconductor-superconductor heterostructures have been used to realize a variety of voltage-tunable superconducting quantum devices, including qubits and parametric amplifiers. To date theoretical descriptions of these systems have been restricted to small quantum fluctuations of the junction phase, making them inapplicable to many experiments. In this work we relax this, employing a path-integral formulation where the phase quantum dynamics is obtained self-consistently from an underlying many-body formalism. Our method recovers previously-known results for small phase fluctuations, and predicts new effects outside of that limit: (i) system capacitances undergo a gate-voltage-dependent renormalization; and (ii) an additional charge offset appears for asymmetric junctions. Our main results can be summarized in terms of a single-particle Hamiltonian, which can be directly compared to that of an ordinary Josephson junction. This more general theory could be a first step towards designing new quantum devices that go qualitatively beyond voltage-tunable variants of previously-known circuits.

Title: Merons, hedgehogs and magnetoelectric switching in spiral multiferroics
Authors: Luca Maranzana, Naoto Nagaosa, Sergey Artyukhin
Abstract: In spiral multiferroics, magnetism induces ferroelectricity, thus holding a promise for novel memory devices where an electric field switches magnetic bits. However, such a switching process, in which magnetic domain walls are moved electrically, is still poorly understood. We find multiferroic domain walls containing arrays of meron (half-skyrmion) strings with a plethora of topological defects, which profoundly affect wall dynamics. Minimum energy walls have alternating meron topological charges and move as relativistic massive particles, with velocity limited by the magnon speed. During domain nucleation, walls with non-alternating meron charges appear. Such defects result in a peculiar non-local dynamics where all the spins in the system rotate, and the wall mobility is suppressed. Meron strings possess 0D hedgehog defects, analogous to Bloch points, that pin the wall to the lattice. This fascinating interplay of magnetoelectric switching with a variety of topological defects and non-local spin dynamics opens a new playground for the electric manipulation of spins.

Title: Spectral Multifractality and Emergent Energyscales Across the Many-Body Localisation Transition
Authors: Sthitadhi Roy
Abstract: We present a scaling theory of the many-body localisation transition in terms of emergent, characteristic energyscales. The analysis is based on the decomposition of the eigenstates in the basis of trivially localised states, resolved in the energies of the latter, which we refer to as the spectral decomposition of the eigenstates. The characteristic energyscales emerge when the multifractal properties, or lack thereof, of the spectral decomposition are studied at different scales. These characteristic scales correspond to the ones, above which the spectral decompositions exhibit their global behaviour, namely full ergodicity in the ergodic phase and multifractality in the many-body localised phase. On the other hand, at scales below the characteristic ones, the decomposition in the ergodic phase shows finer (multi)fractal structures whereas in the localised phase, the decomposition picks out well-separated, localised resonant peaks. The scaling of these characteristic energyscales across the many-body localisation transition admits a scaling theory consistent with a Kosterlitz-Thouless type scenario and bears striking resemblances to that of inverse participation ratios of eigenstates.

Title: Higher Hall conductivity from a single wave function: Obstructions to symmetry-preserving gapped edge of (2+1)D topological order
Authors: Ryohei Kobayashi, Taige Wang, Tomohiro Soejima, Roger S. K. Mong, Shinsei Ryu
Abstract: A (2+1)D topological ordered phase with U(1) symmetry may or may not have a symmetric gapped edge state, even if both thermal and electric Hall conductivity are vanishing. It is recently discovered that there are "higher" versions of Hall conductivity valid for fermionic fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states, which obstructs symmetry-preserving gapped edge state beyond thermal and electric Hall conductivity. In this paper, we show that one can extract higher Hall conductivity from a single wave function of an FQH state, by evaluating the expectation value of the "partial rotation" unitary which is a combination of partial spatial rotation and a U(1) phase rotation. This result is verified numerically with the fermionic Laughlin state with $\nu=1/3$, $1/5$, as well as the non-Abelian Moore-Read state. Together with topological entanglement entropy, we prove that the expectation values of the partial rotation completely determines if a bosonic/fermionic Abelian topological order with U(1) symmetry has a symmetry-preserving gappable edge state or not. We also show that thermal and electric Hall conductivity of Abelian topological order can be extracted by partial rotations. Even in non-Abelian FQH states, partial rotation provides the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis type theorem constraining the low-energy spectrum of the bulk-boundary system. The generalization of higher Hall conductivity to the case with Lie group symmetry is also presented.

Title: Some new results for the GHWS model
Authors: Leonardo Reyes
Abstract: Here we outline some new results for the GHWS model which points to a discretization of parameter space into well differentiated collective dynamic states. We argue this can lead to basic processes in parameter space, starting with minimum modelling ingredients: a complex network with a disorder parameter and an excitable dynamics (cellular automata) on it.

Title: Fermion-Vortex Interactions in Axion Electrodynamics
Authors: Saurav Kantha, Amitabha Lahiri
Abstract: A relativistic action for scalar condensate-fermion mixture is considered where both the scalar boson and the fermion fields are coupled to a $U(1)$ gauge field. The dynamics of the gauge field is governed by a linear combination of the Maxwell term, and the Lorentz invariant $\mathbf{E\cdot B}$ term with a constant coefficient $\theta$. We obtain an effective action describing an emergent fermion-fermion interaction and fermion-vortex tube interaction by using the particle-string duality, and find that the $\theta$ term can significantly affect the interaction of fermions and vortices. We also perform a dimensional reduction to show a $\theta$ dependent flux attachment to the itinerant fermions.

Title: Investigating amorphization as a deformation mechanism using a novel phase field model at the mesoscale
Authors: Yuntong Huang, Shuyang Dai, Chuqi Chen, Yang Xiang
Abstract: Amorphization during severe plastic deformation has been observed in various crystalline materials, yet its underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. This study introduces a novel phase-field model at the mesoscale, integrating elastoplastic theory with a deviatoric stress-dependent transformation strain tensor to capture stress-induced amorphization. The model enables quantitative predictions of amorphous phase nucleation and propagation under high stress, resolving distinctive microstructural patterns such as amorphous shear bands. Simulations reveal key phenomena, including avalanche-like amorphization, grain size effects, the Hall-Petch effect, and surface amorphization, consistent with experimental observations. By bridging phase-field methods with elastoplastic theory, this work provides a robust framework for studying amorphization as a deformation mechanism and offers valuable insights for designing materials resistant to extreme mechanical conditions.

Title: Efficient conversion from fermionic Gaussian states to matrix product states
Authors: Tong Liu, Ying-Hai Wu, Hong-Hao Tu, Tao Xiang
Abstract: Fermionic Gaussian states are eigenstates of quadratic Hamiltonians and are widely used in quantum many-body problems. We propose a highly efficient algorithm that converts fermionic Gaussian states to matrix product states. It can be formulated for finite-size systems without translation invariance, but becomes particularly appealing when applied to infinite systems with translation invariance. If the ground states of a topologically ordered system on infinite cylinders are expressed as matrix product states, then the fixed points of the transfer matrix can be harnessed to filter out the anyon eigenbasis, also known as minimally entangled states. This allows for efficient computation of universal properties, such as the entanglement spectrum and modular matrices. The potential of our method is demonstrated by numerical calculations in two chiral spin liquids that have the same topological orders as the bosonic Laughlin and Moore-Read states, respectively. The anyon eigenbasis for the first one has been worked out before and serves as a useful benchmark. The anyon eigenbasis of the second one is, however, not transparent, and its successful construction provides a nontrivial corroboration of our method.

Title: There is Nothing Anomalous about 'Anomalous' Underscreening in Concentrated Electrolytes
Authors: Sophie Baker, Gareth R. Elliott, Erica J. Wanless, Grant B. Webber, Vincent S. J. Craig, Alister J. Page
Abstract: Over the last decade, experimental measurements of electrostatic screening lengths in concentrated electrolytes have exceeded theoretical predictions by orders of magnitude. This disagreement has led to a paradigm in which such screening lengths are referred to as 'anomalous underscreening', while moderate screening lengths - predominantly those predicted by theory and molecular simulation - are referred to as 'normal underscreening'. Herein we use discrete Fourier analysis of the radial charge density obtained from molecular dynamics simulations to confirm the presence of many electrostatic screening modes present at any one time. We present a new approach for extracting screening lengths directly from the bulk charge density that reveals the origins of both normal and anomalous underscreening. These results reconcile a decades-old disagreement between experimental measurements and theoretical predictions of screening lengths in concentrated electrolytes.

Title: Transfer Matrix and Lattice Dilatation Operator for High-Quality Fixed Points in Tensor Network Renormalization Group
Authors: Nikolay Ebel, Tom Kennedy, Slava Rychkov
Abstract: Tensor network renormalization group maps study critical points of 2d lattice models like the Ising model by finding the fixed point of the RG map. In a prior work arXiv:2408.10312 we showed that by adding a rotation to the RG map, the Newton method could be implemented to find an extremely accurate fixed point. For a particular RG map (Gilt-TNR) we studied the spectrum of the Jacobian of the RG map at the fixed point and found good agreement between the eigenvalues corresponding to relevant and marginal operators and their known exact values. In this companion work we use two further methods to extract many more scaling dimensions from this Newton method fixed point, and compare the numerical results with the predictions of conformal field theory (CFT). The first method is the well-known transfer matrix. We introduce some extensions of this method that provide spins of the CFT operators modulo an integer. We find good agreement for the scaling dimensions and spins up to $\Delta=3\frac1 8$. The second method we refer to as the lattice dilatation operator (LDO). This lesser-known method obtains good agreement with CFT up to $\Delta=6$. Moreover, the inclusion of a rotation in the RG map makes it possible to extract spins of the CFT operators modulo 4 from this method. Some of the eigenvalues of the Jacobian of the RG map can come from perturbations associated with total derivative interactions and so are not universal. In some past studies (arXiv:2102.08136, arXiv:2305.09899) such non-universal eigenvalues did not appear in the Jacobian. We explain this surprising result by showing that their RG map has the unusual property that the Jacobian is equivalent to the LDO operator.

Title: Emergence of a Hump in the Cubic Dielectric Response of Glycerol
Authors: Marceau Hénot, François Ladieu
Abstract: We report a direct determination of the cubic dielectric spectra of a realistic polar molecule, glycerol, from molecular dynamic (MD) simulations. From the liquid state to the mildly supercooled regime, we observed the emergence and growth of a hump in the cubic modulus, traditionally associated with collective effects in the dynamics. Its evolution follows that of dynamical correlations probed by the four-point susceptibility and that of the activation energy of the relaxation time. In particular, its appearance at high temperature coincides with the onset of super-activation. We show that, for this system, the shape of cubic spectra is only weakly affected by dipolar cross-correlations. The good agreement with experimental observations, despite the difference in temperature range, demonstrates the relevance of this approach to help get an insight into the intricate effects probed by non-linear dielectric spectroscopy.

Title: Shear stresses in fluid and solid membranes with bending elasticity
Authors: S. Dharmavaram, J. A. Hanna
Abstract: Comparison of a few simple models of fluid and solid membranes illustrates how shear stresses can arise from a bending energy through a coupling between curvature and surface stresses, a feature incidental to the fluid or solid nature of the material. In particular, it is shown how a fluid-like Helfrich bending energy contributes shear stresses, while a related solid-like energy, the correct continuum limit of a Seung-Nelson discrete bending term, produces a stress tensor with purely isotropic tangential part. A distinction is noted between the resistance to tangential flows on the surface and the ability to support tangential stresses. The tangential projection of the divergence of the stress, or the pseudomomentum balance, is viewed in the light of some statements and observations in the literature. Different types of constraints, invariance properties, and shape equations are briefly discussed. The state of a patch of unidirectionally-bent material is connected with prior analyses of the pulling of membrane tethers.

Title: Quantum geometric tensor in systems with fractional band dispersion
Authors: Jamme Omar A. Biscocho, Kristian Hauser A. Villegas
Abstract: We investigate the quantum geometric tensor, which is comprised of the Berry curvature and quantum metric, in a generalized Dirac two-band system with non-integer dispersion $E(\mathbf{k})\sim k^{\alpha}$. Our analysis reveals that this type of dispersion introduces significant and novel effects on quantum band geometry. We calculate the Berry curvature and observe its redistribution in momentum space as \(\alpha\) varies. Notably, despite this redistribution, the change in Chern number across topological transitions remains quantized as an integer, even for non-integer \(\alpha\). We illustrate the physical implications of this redistribution by computing the orbital magnetization. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Berry curvature and quantum metric peak along the regions of momentum space where the energy band exhibits high curvature. While it is well-established that Berry curvature becomes highly concentrated at the band touching points, our findings indicate that they can also accumulate at sharp band corners, away from these band touching points. We further show that while the Berry curvature develops Dirac delta-like peaks away from $\mathbf{k}=0$, the Berry monopole, corresponding to the topological charge, remains located at the origin.

Title: Emergence of Intermediate Range Order in Jammed Packings
Authors: Joseph M. Monti, Ishan Srivastava, Leonardo E. Silbert, A. P. Santos, Jeremy B. Lechman, Gary S. Grest
Abstract: We perform a structural analysis of large scale jammed packings of monodisperse, frictionless and frictional spheres to elucidate structural signatures of the static structure factor in the low-to-intermediate wavenumber ($q$) region. We employ discrete element method simulations containing up to eighty million particles, in which the particle friction coefficient(s), including sliding, rolling, and twisting interactions, are varied. At intermediate $q$ values, corresponding to length scales that lie between that of the nearest neighbor primary peak and the system size, we find the emergence of a prepeak -- a signature of intermediate range order -- that grows with increasing friction. We correlate the emergence of this peak to real space fluctuations in the local particle coordination number, which exhibits a grainy fluctuating field throughout the packing process that is retained in the final, mechanically stable state. While the formation of the prepeak shows varying degrees of robustness to packing protocol changes, our results suggest that preparation history may be used to construct packings with variable large length scale structural properties.

Title: Exact volume-law entangled zero-energy eigenstates in a large class of spin models
Authors: Sashikanta Mohapatra, Sanjay Moudgalya, Ajit C. Balram
Abstract: Exact solutions for excited states in non-integrable quantum Hamiltonians have revealed novel dynamical phenomena that can occur in quantum many-body systems. This work proposes a method to analytically construct a specific set of volume-law-entangled zero-energy exact excited eigenstates in a large class of spin Hamiltonians. In particular, we show that all spin chains that satisfy a simple set of conditions host exact volume-law zero-energy eigenstates in the middle of their spectra. Examples of physically relevant spin chains of this type include the transverse-field Ising model, PXP model, spin-$S$ $XY$ model, and spin-$S$ Kitaev chain. Although these eigenstates are highly atypical in their structure, they are thermal with respect to local observables. Our framework also unifies many recent constructions of volume-law entangled eigenstates in the literature. Finally, we show that a similar construction also generalizes to spin models on graphs in arbitrary dimensions.

Abstract: We revisit the classic Joule-expansion experiments, now with a quantum-degenerate atomic Bose gas. In contrast to the classical-gas experiments, where no temperature change was measured, here we observe and quantitatively explain both cooling and heating effects, which arise, respectively, due to quantum statistics and inter-particle interactions.

Title: Superconductivity-enhanced magnetic field noise
Authors: Shane P. Kelly, Yaroslav Tserkovnyak
Abstract: We consider the stray magnetic field noise outside a two-dimensional superconductor. Our considerations are motivated by recent experiments, which observed an enhancement in the magnetic field noise below the superconducting critical temperature based on the relaxation of diamond nitrogen-vacancy centers. Such enhancement is not captured by the standard two-fluid model for the superconducting state, recently proposed to explain such NV relaxometry experiments. Instead, we show that a microscopic BCS theory captures such an enhancement, and we compare with a similar theory and phenomenon, known as the Hebel-Schlicter peak (or coherence peak), observed in the relaxation of nuclear spins in the material. The primary difference is that the NV probes long-wavelength magnetic noise outside the sample, while the nuclear spin probes local hyperfine noise inside the sample. Accordingly, the noise probed by the NV depends on its height and can probe, in pristine samples, the superfluid coherence length. Finally, we discuss potential avenues for NVs to probe unconventional superconductivity via deviations from the above BCS theory.

Title: Introduction of Additive Particle Theory for Path Integral Approaches
Authors: Ken-ichi Amano
Abstract: Path integral approaches have been used for boson and fermion systems. The path integral approach has been successful in the many-boson system. However, in the many-fermion system, the path integral approach is not feasible due to the sign problem. In this letter, I introduce additive particle (AP) theory in order to generate an approximation method that avoids the sign problem. The AP theory considers one electron as a string polymer, and virtual particles are added into the system. The AP theory is an approximation, but it is constructed to be able to generate the pair distribution function between free electrons and the density of states of the free electrons at an arbitrary temperature. Hence, when the electrostatic interactions are decreased, the AP theory converges to the free electron system. On the other hand, it deviates from the actual system when the electrostatic interactions are increased.

Title: Nonlinear Drift in Feynman-Kac Theory: Preserving Early Probabilistic Insights

Abstract: In 1905, Einstein's theory of Brownian motion supported the molecular basis of the diffusion equation and introduced two complementary viewpoints: a deterministic field description and a probabilistic formulation based on stochastic particle ensembles. The consequences were far-reaching in the development of key concepts of modern physics such as wave-particle duality in quantum mechanics. In the 1940s, Feynman and Kac advanced this framework by casting path integrals within measure theory, defining solutions as mathematical expectations and extending the method to a broad class of differential operators. Despite its influence, applying this deterministic-probabilistic correspondence to flows within confined geometries has remained elusive: how can one recover deterministic streamlines from particles advected by a random velocity that never matches the true flow field? Elegant particle-system models have been devised for collisional plasmas, semiconducting crystals, globular clusters, and biological microswimmers, yet they depart from the original intent of representing the solution as an expectation of sources propagated by a single process. Here, we show that Feynman-Kac's theory can be rigorously extended to nonlinear dynamics with drift, staying true to its probabilistic origin. This yields novel propagator representations and forges a convergence of ideas across applied mathematics, computer graphics, and engineering communities tackling complex geometries.

Title: Expansion into the vacuum of stochastic gases with long-range interactions
Authors: P. L. Krapivsky, Kirone Mallick
Abstract: We study the evolution of a system of many point particles initially concentrated in a small region in $d$ dimensions. Particles undergo overdamped motion caused by pairwise interactions through the long-ranged repulsive $r^{-s}$ potential; each particle is also subject to Brownian noise. When $s<d$, the expansion is governed by non-local hydrodynamic equations. In the one-dimensional case, we deduce self-similar solutions for all $s\in (-2,1)$. The expansion of Coulomb gases remains well-defined in the infinite-particle limit: The density is spatially uniform and inversely proportional to time independent of the spatial dimension.

Title: Impurity strength-temperature phase diagram with phase crystals and competing time-reversal symmetry breaking states in nodal $d$-wave superconductors
Authors: Kevin Marc Seja, Niclas Wall-Wennerdal, Tomas Löfwander, Annica M. Black-Schaffer, Mikael Fogelström, Patric Holmvall
Abstract: Phase crystals are a class of nonuniform superconducting ground states characterized by spontaneous phase gradients of the superconducting order parameter. These phase gradients nonlocally drive periodic currents and magnetic fields, thus breaking both time-reversal symmetry and continuous translational symmetry. The phase crystal instability is generally triggered by negative and inhomogeneous superfluid stiffness. Several scenarios have been identified that can realize phase crystals, especially flat bands at specific edges of unconventional nodal superconductors. Motivated by omnipresent disorder in all materials, we employ the ${t}$-matrix approach within the quasiclassical theory of superconductivity to study the emergence of phase crystals at edges of a nodal $d$-wave superconductor. We quantify the full phase diagram as a function of the impurity scattering energy and the temperature, with full self-consistency in the impurity self energies, the superconducting order parameter, and the vector potential. We find that the phase crystal survives even up to $\sim 40-50\%$ of the superconducting critical impurity strength in both the Born and unitary scattering limits. Finally, we show how mesoscopic finite-size effects induce a competition with a state still breaking time-reversal symmetry but with translationally invariant edge currents.

Title: Optical Properties and Spin States of Inter-layer Carbon Defect Pairs in Hexagonal Boron Nitride: A First-Principles Study
Authors: Ignacio Chacon, Andrea Echeverri, Carlos Cardenas, Francisco Munoz
Abstract: Substitutional carbon defects in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) are prominent single photon emitters (SPEs), and their potential for spin activity ($S\geq1$) is particularly intriguing. While studies have largely focused on intra-layer defects, we employ density functional theory (DFT) to investigate inter-layer dimers of identical carbon species (C$_X$C$_X$). We demonstrate that these C$_X$C$_X$ pairs can exhibit a stable triplet spin state at room temperature when closely spaced (e.g., within 3.5-7.1 Å) across hBN layers. As their separation increases beyond this range (e.g., $>7$ Å), they transition into weakly interacting $S=1/2$ pairs, characterized by singlet-triplet degeneracy. This regime is predicted to result in a very small zero-field splitting for the triplet manifold, offering a potential explanation for certain optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) signals. The zero-phonon line (ZPL) energy of these inter-layer C$_X$C$_X$ pairs is found to be practically monochromatic and within the visible range. Furthermore, we identify specific C$_B$C$_B$ inter-layer configurations exhibiting atypical low-energy phonon replicas due to out-of-plane vibrational coupling, a finding that may clarify the vibronic structure of other hBN emitters, such as the 'yellow emitters'.

Title: Spin-Splitting Magnetoresistance in Altermagnetic RuO2 Thin Films
Authors: Hongyu Chen, Zian Wang, Peixin Qin, Ziang Meng, Xiaorong Zhou, Xiaoning Wang, Li Liu, Guojian Zhao, Zhiyuan Duan, Tianli Zhang, Jinghua Liu, Dingfu Shao, Chengbao Jiang, Zhiqi Liu
Abstract: The recently discovered altermagnets, featured by the exotic correlation of magnetic exchange interaction and alternating crystal environments, have offered exciting cutting-edge opportunities for spintronics. Nevertheless, the altermagnetism of RuO2, one of the earliest-discovered altermagnets, is currently under intense debate. Here we try to resolve this controversy by demonstrating an altermagnetic spin-splitting magnetoresistance (SSMR) effect that is driven by a spin current associated with the giant nonrelativistic spin splitting of an altermagnet. Compared to the spin Hall magnetoresistance induced by a conventional relativistic spin current, the SSMR is characterized by unusual angular dependence with a phase-shift feature underpinned by the Neel-vector orientation and pronounced temperature dependence caused by its susceptibility to electron scattering. Through systematical investigations on the magnetoresistance of (101)-RuO2/Co bilayers, we disentangle a sizable SSMR and hence unveil a Neel vector along [001] direction. Our work not only demonstrates a simple electric avenue to probing the Neel vector of altermagnets, but also indicates long-range magnetic order in thin films of RuO2.

Title: Entanglement as a topological marker in harmonically confined attractive Fermi-Hubbard chains
Authors: Marina Sanino, Isaac Carvalho, Vivian França
Abstract: We investigate the single-site von Neumann entropy along a harmonically confined superfluid chain, as described by the one-dimensional fermionic Hubbard model with strongly attractive interactions. We find that by increasing the confinement (or equivalently the particle filling) the system undergoes a quantum phase transition from a superfluid (SF) to a non-trivial topological insulator (TI) phase, which is characterized by an insulating bulk surrounded by highly entangled superfluid edges. These highly entangled states are found to be robust against perturbations and topologically protected by the particle-hole symmetry, which is locally preserved. We also find a semi-quantitative agreement between entanglement and superconducting order parameter profiles, confirming then that entanglement can be used as a topological marker and an order parameter in these systems. The charge gap not only confirms the SF-TI transition, but also shows that this transition is mediated by a metallic intermediate regime within the bulk. Using the gap we could depict a phase diagram for which the non-trivial topological insulator can be found in such harmonically confined attractive systems.

Title: Topological phase diagram and quantum magnetotransport effects in (Pb,Sn)Se quantum wells with magnetic barriers (Pb,Eu)Se
Authors: Alexander Kazakov, Valentine V. Volobuev, Chang-Woo Cho, Benjamin A. Piot, Zbigniew Adamus, Tomasz Wojciechowski, Tomasz Wojtowicz, Gunther Springholz, Tomasz Dietl
Abstract: In this study, we report here on a successful growth by molecular beam epitaxy of high crystalline quality Pb$_{1-x}$Sn$_{x}$Se:Bi/Pb$_{1-y}$Eu$_{y}$Se QWs with $x = 0.25$ and $y = 0.1$, and on their magnetotransport characterization as a function of the QW thickness between 10 and 50 nm, temperatures down to 300 mK, perpendicular and tilted magnetic fields up to 36 T. The character of weak antilocalization magnetoresistance and universal conductance fluctuations points to a notably long phase coherence length. It is argued that a relatively large magnitude of the dielectric constant of IV-VI compounds suppresses the decoherence by electron-electron scattering. The observation of Shubnikov-de-Haas oscillations and the quantum Hall effect, together with multiband $k\cdot p$ modelling, have enabled us to assess valley degeneracies, the magnitude of strain, subbands effective masses, and the topological phase diagram as a function of the QW thickness. Our results demonstrate that further progress in controlling Sn content, carrier densities, and magnetism in Pb$_{1-x}$Sn$_{x}$Se/Pb$_{1-y}$Eu$_{y}$Se QWs will allow for the exploration of the topologically protected quantized edge transport even in the absence of an external magnetic field.

Title: Investigation of magnetic ordering with spin reorientation transition and optical properties in Dy$_2$CoCrO$_6$ nanomaterials
Authors: M. M. Islam, M. A. Islam, Rana Hossain, M. J. Hosen, M. D. I. Bhuyan
Abstract: This study reports the synthesis and physical properties of polycrystalline Dy$_2$CoCrO$_6$ (DCCO) nanoparticles. Analysis of the powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern using Rietveld refinement showed that the compound crystallizes in an orthorhombic crystal structure with a space group Pbnm. The particle size of approximately 57 nm was confirmed through micrographs obtained from field emission scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) investigations identified a mixed-valence state of Co and Cr cations. Magnetic susceptibility data indicated Curie-Weiss behavior in the temperature range 140-340 K and the onset of antiferromagnetic interactions with a Neel temperature of 119 K. At 31 K, DCCO shows spin reorientation transition from $\Gamma_4$(G$_x$A$_y$F$_z$) to $\Gamma_2$(F$_x$C$_y$G$_z$). Furthermore, room-temperature magnetization measurements demonstrated the antiferromagnetic behavior with weak ferromagnetic interactions at low temperatures. Additionally, DCCO exhibited semiconducting behavior with a direct optical bandgap of 1.97 eV, indicating promise for visible-light-driven energy harvesting and catalytic applications.

Title: Towards understanding structure-function relationships in random fiber networks
Authors: Peerasait Prachaseree, Emma Lejeune
Abstract: Random fiber networks form the structural foundation of numerous biological tissues and engineered materials. From a mechanics perspective, understanding the structure-function relationships of random fiber networks is particularly interesting because when external force is applied to these networks, only a small subset of fibers will actually carry the majority of the load. Specifically, these load-bearing fibers propagate through the network to form load paths, also called force chains. However, the relationship between fiber network geometric structure, force chains, and the overall mechanical behavior of random fiber network structures remains poorly understood. To this end, we implement a finite element model of random fiber networks with geometrically exact beam elements, and use this model to explore random fiber network mechanical behavior. Our focus is twofold. First, we explore the mechanical behavior of single fiber chains and random fiber networks. Second, we propose and validate an interpretable analytical approach to predicting fiber network mechanics from structural information alone. Key findings include insight into the critical strain-stiffening transition point for single fiber chains and fiber networks generated from a Voronoi diagram, and a connection between force chains and the distance-weighted graph shortest paths that arise by treating fiber networks as spatial graph structures. This work marks an important step towards mapping the structure-function relationships of random fiber networks undergoing large deformations. Additionally, with our code distributed under open-source licenses, we hope that future researchers can directly build on our work to address related problems beyond the scope defined here.

Title: Phase-controlled minimal Kitaev chain in multiterminal Josephson junctions
Authors: Samuel D. Escribano, Anders Enevold Dahl, Karsten Flensberg, Yuval Oreg
Abstract: We propose a nanodevice based on multi-terminal Josephson junctions for the creation and detection of poor man's Majorana (PMM) modes. The device consists of a double three-terminal Josephson junction (3TJJ) embedded in a planar semiconductor that engineers a two-site Kitaev chain. We identify the conditions necessary for the emergence of PMM modes by precisely tuning the superconducting phases of the terminals and the inter-junction coupling between the 3TJJs. To validate our findings, we perform numerical simulations that account for disorder in a more general geometry and test experimentally feasible protocols based on conductance measurements to reliably detect these modes. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on magnetic fields, our design eliminates the need for such fields, potentially increasing the energy-level resolution and significantly expanding the range of compatible semiconductor materials, such as Ge-based heterostructures.

Title: Dynamic Modulation of Electronic and Optical Properties in GaN Bilayers by Interlayer Sliding
Authors: Heeju Kim, Gunn Kim
Abstract: In this study, we present a first-principles investigation of the electronic and optical properties of gallium nitride (GaN) bilayers, focusing on the influence of interlayer sliding and spacing. In contrast to the earlier studies on discrete stacking configurations, we explore the dynamic evolution of the properties during transitions between stable stacking arrangements. Using density functional theory calculations, we systematically analyze the impact of these structural variations on the electronic band structure and optical absorption spectra of GaN bilayers. The analysis includes both high-symmetry stacking configurations (AA', AB', and AC') and intermediate states generated by controlled in-plane atomic displacements, thereby providing a comprehensive understanding of the property changes associated with interlayer sliding. The findings of this study provide valuable insights into the potential for tuning the electronic and optical response of two-dimensional GaN for applications in nanoscale photonic and electronic devices, where precise control over interlayer interactions and stacking is crucial.

Title: Interlayer interactions in $\text{La}_3\text{Ni}_2\text{O}_7$ under pressure: from $s^{\pm}$ to $d_{xy}$-wave superconductivity
Authors: Lauro B. Braz, George B. Martins, Luis G. G. V. Dias da Silva
Abstract: We investigate the role of \emph{interlayer} interaction terms in the competition between different superconducting gap symmetries in the bilayer nickelate $\text{La}_3\text{Ni}_2\text{O}_7$ under high pressure. We study a two-layer, two-orbital electron model that encompasses both intra- and interlayer Coulomb interaction terms within the matrix random-phase approximation. We find that interlayer interactions favor a $d_{xy}$-wave superconducting pairing symmetry over the $s^{\pm}$-wave symmetry, which has been found to prevail when interlayer interactions are disregarded. Moreover, our findings indicate that interlayer interactions enhance the interorbital pairing, incorporating contributions from all three electron pockets, arising from both $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital character, resulting in nodes within the gap function (not present in the $s^{\pm}$-wave state) and consequently favoring the $d_{xy}$-wave pairing.

Title: Asymmetric simple exclusion process on a random comb: Transport properties in the stationary state
Authors: Mrinal Sarkar, Shamik Gupta
Abstract: We address the dynamics of interacting particles on a disordered lattice formed by a random comb. The dynamics comprises that of the asymmetric simple exclusion process, whereby motion to nearest-neighour sites that are empty is more likely in the direction of a bias than in the opposite direction. The random comb comprises a backbone lattice from each site of which emanates a branch with a random number of sites. The backbone and the branches run in the direction of the bias. The number of branch sites or alternatively the branch lengths are sampled independently from a common distribution, specifically, an exponential distribution. The system relaxes at long times into a nonequilibrium stationary state. We analyse the stationary-state density of sites across the random comb, and also explore the transport properties, in particular, the stationary-state drift velocity of particles along the backbone. We show that in the stationary state, the density is uniform along the backbone and nonuniform along the branches, decreasing monotonically from the free-end of a branch to its intersection with the backbone. On the other hand, the drift velocity as a function of the bias strength has a non-monotonic dependence, first increasing and then decreasing with increase of bias. However, remarkably, as the particle density increases, the dependence becomes no more non-monotonic. We understand this effect as a consequence of an interplay between biased hopping and hard-core exclusion, whereby sites towards the free end of the branches remain occupied for long times and become effectively non-participatory in the dynamics of the system. This results in an effective reduction of the branch lengths and a motion of the particles that takes place primarily along the backbone.

Title: Anomalous exchange correlation of quasiparticles with entangled Nambu spinors
Authors: Hai-Dong Li, Wei Chen
Abstract: Entanglement of spin degree of freedom can drastically alter the orbital exchange symmetry of electrons, switching their bunching and antibunching behaviors and the resultant current correlations in the Hanbury-Brown-Twiss interferometry. Here, we investigate the exchange correlation of quasiparticles with entanglement encoded in the Nambu spinors, or the electron-hole degree of freedom. In contrast to the conventional correspondence between spin entanglement and current correlation, we find that singlet (triplet) entanglement of Nambu spinors results in suppressed (enhanced) current correlation. This effect arises because the charge degree of freedom itself encodes the entanglement. We propose implementing this phenomenon in the edge states of a quantum Hall system, where the entangled states of the Nambu spinors can be continuously tuned by gate voltages. Our study reveals a novel relationship between entanglement and charge correlations, offering an effective approach for detecting entanglement of Nambu spinors.

Title: Accurate Simulation of the Hubbard Model with Finite Fermionic Projected Entangled Pair States
Authors: Wen-Yuan Liu, Huanchen Zhai, Ruojing Peng, Zheng-Cheng Gu, Garnet Kin-Lic Chan
Abstract: We demonstrate the use of finite-size fermionic projected entangled pair states, in conjunction with variational Monte Carlo, to perform accurate simulations of the ground-state of the 2D Hubbard model. Using bond dimensions of up to $D=28$, we show that we can surpass state-of-the-art DMRG energies that use up to $m=32000$ SU(2) multiplets on 8-leg ladders. We further apply our methodology to $10\times 16$, $12\times 16$ and $16 \times 16$ lattices at $1/8$ hole doping and observe the dimensional crossover between stripe orientations. Our work shows the power of finite-size fermionic tensor networks to resolve the physics of the 2D Hubbard model and related problems.

Title: Sign Changes in Heat, Spin, and Orbital Magnon Transport Coefficients in Kitaev Ferromagnets
Authors: Yannick Höpfner, Ingrid Mertig, Robin R. Neumann
Abstract: Both Kitaev and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions (DMI) are known to promote intrinsic contributions to the magnon Hall effects such as the thermal Hall and the spin Nernst effects in collinear magnets. Previously, it was reported that a sign change in those transversal transport coefficients only appears in the presence of Kitaev interaction, but not for DMI, which qualitatively distinguishes both kinds of spin-anisotropic interactions in ferromagnets. Herein, we systematically study how the magnon-mediated heat, spin, and orbital transport in longitudinal and transverse geometries evolves with a continuously varying Kitaev-to-DMI ratio, but a fixed magnon band structure. We show that several transport coefficients feature temperature-driven sign changes in the presence of Kitaev interaction, which are absent for DMI. In particular, we find a sign change in longitudinal orbital transport, the magnon orbital Seebeck effect, which is absent in the transverse geometry, the magnon orbital Nernst effect. This sets the orbital transport apart from the heat and spin transport, where we only find sign changes promoted by the Kitaev interaction in transverse, but not in the longitudinal geometry.

Title: Mechanisms driving robust high-temperature superconductivity in complex metal hydrides under moderate pressure
Authors: Wendi Zhao, Shumin Guo, Tiancheng Ma, Zhengtao Liu, Chengda Li, Defang Duan, Tian Cui
Abstract: The discovery of near-room-temperature superconductivity in compressed hydrides has sparked intensive research efforts to identify superconducting hydrides stable at low or even ambient pressures. Herein, we demonstrate a new mechanism for achieving robust superconductivity in complex metal hydrides under moderate pressure, using Li3IrH9 as a paradigmatic example. This compound displays unique electronic structural characteristics where the broadening and overlap between antibonding electronic bands of [IrH8]2- and adjacent H- orbitals not only drive the intrinsic metallicity of the hydrogen sublattice, generating hydrogen-dominated electronic states at the Fermi level, but also soften hydrogen-related optical phonon modes, inducing strong electron-phonon coupling that remains robust even under high-pressures. First-principles calculations predict that Li3IrH9 maintains thermodynamic stability at 100 GPa while exhibiting a consistently high Tc exceeding 100 K across a broad pressure range (8-150 GPa). Through high-throughput computational screening, we have identified a new superconducting family based on this structural prototype, including Li3RhH9 (Tc = 124 K at 20 GPa) and Li3CoH9 (Tc = 80 K at 10 GPa). This work provides a new platform and original theoretical insights for the development of complex metal hydride superconductors that exhibit robust high-temperature superconductivity and promising practical applications.

Abstract: Heat transfer is a fundamental property of matter. Research spanning decades has attempted to discover materials with exceptional thermal conductivity, yet the upper limit remains unknown. Using deep learning accelerated crystal structure prediction and first-principles calculation, we systematically explore the thermal conductivity landscape of inorganic crystals. We brute-force over half a million ordered crystalline structures, encompassing an extensive coverage of local energy minima in binary compounds with up to four atoms per primitive cell. We confirm diamond sets the upper bound of thermal conductivity within our search space, very likely also among all stable crystalline solids at ambient conditions. We also identify over 20 novel crystals surpassing silicon in thermal conductivity, validated by density functional theory. These include a semiconductor TaN with ultrahigh thermal conductivity (~900 $\mathrm{W\cdot m^{-1}\cdot K^{-1}}$), and metallic compounds such as MnV that exhibit high lattice and electronic thermal conductivity simultaneously, a distinctive feature not observed before. These results as well as the deep learning-driven screening method, redefine the landscape of thermal transport and establish a large open-access database for future materials discovery.

Title: Modeling crystal defects using defect-informed neural networks
Authors: Ziduo Yang, Xiaoqing Liu, Xiuying Zhang, Pengru Huang, Kostya S. Novoselov, Lei Shen
Abstract: Most AI-for-Materials research to date has focused on ideal crystals, whereas real-world materials inevitably contain defects that play a critical role in modern functional technologies. The defects break geometric symmetry and increase interaction complexity, posing particular challenges for traditional ML models. Here, we introduce Defect-Informed Equivariant Graph Neural Network (DefiNet), a model specifically designed to accurately capture defect-related interactions and geometric configurations in point-defect structures. DefiNet achieves near-DFT-level structural predictions in milliseconds using a single GPU. To validate its accuracy, we perform DFT relaxations using DefiNet-predicted structures as initial configurations and measure the residual ionic steps. For most defect structures, regardless of defect complexity or system size, only 3 ionic steps are required to reach the DFT-level ground state. Finally, comparisons with scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images confirm DefiNet's scalability and extrapolation beyond point defects, positioning it as a valuable tool for defect-focused materials research.

Title: Fixed Points and Universality Classes in Coupled Kardar-Parisi-Zhang Equations
Authors: Dipankar Roy, Abhishek Dhar, Manas Kulkarni, Herbert Spohn
Abstract: We study coupled KPZ equations with three control parameters $X,Y,T$. These equations are used in the context of stretched polymers in a random medium, for the spacetime spin-spin correlator of the isotropic quantum Heisenberg chain, and for exciton-polariton condensates. In an earlier article we investigated merely the diagonal $X=Y$, $T=1$. Then the stationary measure is delta-correlated Gaussian and the dynamical exponent is obtained numerically to be close to $z = \tfrac{3}{2}$. We observed that the scaling functions of the dynamic correlator change smoothly when varying $X$. In this contribution, the analysis is extended to the whole $X$-$Y$-$T$ plane. Solutions are stable only if $XY \geq 0$. Based on numerical simulations, the static correlator still has rapid decay. We argue that the parameter space is foliated into distinct universality classes. They are labeled by $X$ and consist of half-planes parallel to the $Y$-$T$ plane containing the point $(X,X,1)$.

Title: Fixed Point Stability Switches from Attractive to Repulsive at 2d Pomeranchuk/Stoner Instabilities via Field-Theoretical RG
Authors: Han Ma
Abstract: We study an interacting two-flavor fermionic system via field-theoretical functional renormalization group (RG). Each flavor, labeled by $\pm$, has a dispersion of $E^{\pm}=c k^{2\alpha}-\mu^\pm$ with tunable real exponent $\alpha>0$. The effective theory is parametrized by intra-flavor and inter-flavor interactions, preserving global U(1) $\times$ U(1) symmetry, which can be enhanced to U(2). The U(2) symmetric system has a Fermi liquid phase and two possible instabilities, leading to spontaneous spatial rotational or flavor symmetry breaking, known as the Pomeranchuk and Stoner instabilities, respectively. The key discovery of this work is the following. The Stoner instability possesses an RG fixed point that preserves the U(2) symmetry. For $\alpha<1$, this fixed point is attractive, indicating a continuous transition. Conversely, for $\alpha>1$, the fixed point becomes repulsive, and without fine-tuning, there is runaway RG flow, resulting in a discontinuous transition. The U(1) $\times$ U(1) symmetric system, with $\mu^+\neq \mu^-$, exhibits richer physics. This system have two Pomeranchuk instabilities. At one of them, a non-trivial RG fixed point switches its nature from attractive to repulsive as $\alpha$ increases across $1$. Notably, the runaway flow at $\alpha>1$ results in the depletion of a Fermi surface at the transition. Collective modes in these Fermi liquids are also investigated. A universal Fermi surface deformation ratio $\delta\mu^+/\delta\mu^-$ is predicted for $\alpha<1$ at the instability as a continuous transition, which can be observed experimentally.

Title: Electric field tunable spin-orbit gap in a bilayer graphene/WSe$_{2}$ quantum dot
Authors: Hubert Dulisch, David Emmerich, Eike Icking, Katrin Hecker, Samuel Möller, Leonie Müller, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Christian Volk, Christoph Stampfer
Abstract: We report on the investigation of proximity-induced spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in a heterostructure of bilayer graphene (BLG) and tungsten diselenide (WSe$_2$). A BLG quantum dot (QD) in the few-particle regime acts as a sensitive probe for induced SOC. Finite bias and magnetotransport spectroscopy measurements reveal a significantly enhanced SOC that decreases with the applied displacement field, distinguishing it from pristine BLG. Furthermore, our measurements demonstrate a reduced valley $g$-factor at larger displacement fields, consistent with a weaker lateral confinement of the QD. Our findings show evidence of the influence of WSe$_2$ across BLG layers, driven by reduced real-space confinement and increased layer localization of the QD states on the BLG layer distant to the WSe$_2$ at higher displacement fields. This study demonstrates the electrostatic tunability of the spin-orbit gap in BLG/WSe$_2$ heterostructures, which is especially relevant for the field of spintronics and future spin qubit control in BLG QDs.

Title: Control of active field theories at minimal dissipation
Authors: Artur Soriani, Elsen Tjhung, Étienne Fodor, Tomer Markovich
Abstract: Advances in experimental techniques enable the precise manipulation of a large variety of active systems, which constantly dissipate energy to sustain nonequilibrium phenomena without any equilibrium equivalent. To design novel materials out of active systems, an outstanding challenge is to rationalize how material properties can be optimally controlled by applying external perturbations. However, equilibrium thermodynamics is inadequate to guide the control of such nonequilibrium systems. Therefore, there is a dire need for a novel framework to provide a systematic toolbox for the thermodynamic control of active matter. Here, we build an optimization procedure for generic active field theories within a thermodynamically consistent formulation. Central to our approach is the distinction between the protocol heat, which is dissipated only during manipulation, and the total heat, which also accounts for the post-manipulation dissipation. We demonstrate that the latter generically features a global minimum with respect to the protocol duration. We deploy our versatile approach to an active theory of phase separation, and examine the scalings of the optimal protocol duration with respect to activity and system size. Remarkably, we reveal that the landscape of steady-state dissipation regulates the crossover between optimal control strategies for a finite duration.

Title: Microcanonical ensemble out of equilibrium
Authors: Roman Belousov, Jenna Elliott, Florian Berger, Lamberto Rondoni, Anna Erzberger
Abstract: Introduced by Boltzmann under the name "monode," the microcanonical ensemble serves as the fundamental representation of equilibrium thermodynamics in statistical mechanics by counting all possible realizations of a system's states. Ensemble theory connects this idea with probability and information theory, leading to the notion of Shannon-Gibbs entropy and, ultimately, to the principle of maximum caliber describing trajectories of systems--in and out of equilibrium. While the latter phenomenological generalization reproduces many results of nonequilibrium thermodynamics, given a proper choice of observables, its physical justification remains an open area of research. What is the microscopic origin and physical interpretation of this variational approach? What guides the choice of relevant observables? We address these questions by extending Boltzmann's method to a microcanonical caliber principle and counting realizations of a system's trajectories--all assumed equally probable. Maximizing the microcanonical caliber under the imposed constraints, we systematically develop generalized detailed-balance relations, clarify the statistical origins of inhomogeneous transport, and provide an independent derivation of key equations from stochastic thermodynamics. This approach introduces a dynamical ensemble theory for nonequilibrium steady states in spatially extended and active systems. While verifying the equivalence of ensembles, e.g. those of Norton and Thevenin, our framework contests other common assumptions about nonequilibrium regimes, with supporting evidence provided by stochastic simulations. Our theory suggests further connections to the first principles of microscopic dynamics in classical statistical mechanics, which are essential for investigating systems where the necessary conditions for thermodynamic behavior are not satisfied.

Title: Symmetry induced pairing in dark excitonic condensate at finite temperature
Authors: Adham Alkady, Anatoly B. Kuklov
Abstract: Bose Einstein condensate of dark intervalley excitons must be inherently multi-component because of crystalline symmetries. Since valleys hosting such excitons are separated by large quasi-momenta, a minimal inter-component Josephson-type coupling can only be established between pairs of excitons from the time-reversed valleys. As a result, a paired condensate can emerge at finite temperature, that is, the off-diagonal order exists for the pairs from the time-reversed valleys, while the individual valleys are disordered. This prediction follows from the elementary mean field analysis regardless of the dimensionality. However, as Monte Carlo simulations show, no such a phase exists in 3D crystals. Instead, the multi-component condensation proceeds as the Ist order transition from the normal state. The paired phase does exist in 2D for the number of the components $N_v\geq 6$. It forms by Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition from the high temperature (normal) phase. The multi-component condensate appears upon further lowering of temperature.

Title: Compositional disorder in a multicomponent non-reciprocal mixture: stability and patterns
Authors: Laya Parkavousi, Suropriya Saha
Abstract: The mean compositions of individual components can be tuned to control phase behavior in number-conserving passive mixtures. In this work, we investigate the role of variable average density in a system of infinitely many non-reciprocally interacting scalar densities, within the framework of the multi-species non-reciprocal Cahn-Hilliard (NRCH) model. Rather than focusing on specific parameter choices, we study ensembles of systems where the inter-species interaction coefficients and average densities are sampled from probability distributions. We show that non-reciprocity stabilizes the homogeneous mixed state even in the presence of compositional disorder. Using random matrix theory, we derive a general condition for the onset of spinodal instability, which we verify through simulations. Finally, we illustrate the connection between the statistics of the most unstable eigenvalue and the emergent nonlinear dynamics.

Title: Quantum selection of order and dynamic properties of Kitaev-Heisenberg ferromagnet on a triangular lattice
Authors: Kaushal K. Kesharpu, Pavel A. Maksimov
Abstract: Recent interest in monolayer materials motivated a search for two-dimensional ferromagnets with sizable spin-orbit coupling. Magnetic anisotropy of exchange Hamiltonian, induced by spin-orbit coupling, may not only stabilize long-range order, but also in turn can be a source of frustration and accidental degeneracy, which is the case for the Kitaev-Heisenberg model. Here we present an extensive study of ground state and excitations of ferromagnetic anisotropic-exchange Kitaev-Heisenberg model on a triangular lattice using order-by-disorder and augmented spin-wave theory calculations. It is shown that while bond-dependent terms of the model do not affect the ground state classically, quantum fluctuations select preferred magnetization direction of the ferromagnetic state and significantly alter classical phase diagram. Anisotropic terms of the magnetic Hamiltonian also give rise to magnon-magnon interactions that lead to spontaneous decay and spectral renormalization, which we illustrate using non-linear spin-wave theory.

Title: Three regimes of a picosecond magnetoacoustics in ferromagnetic structures
Authors: P. I. Gerevenkov, Ia. A. Mogunov, Ia. A. Filatov, N. S. Gusev, M. V. Sapozhnikov, N. E. Khokhlov, A. M. Kalashnikova
Abstract: The development of magnonics requires energy-efficient methods for generating spin waves and controlling their parameters. Acoustic waves are known to resonantly excite spin waves through magneto-elastic wave formation or to induce non-resonant forced magnetization oscillations. Short acoustic wavepackets enable another unexplored resonant interaction regime -- the Cherenkov radiation of spin waves. This raises a question regarding the criteria and signatures of these three regimes of picosecond this http URL, we use a scanning magneto-optical pump-probe technique to directly observe all three regimes of interaction between laser-driven acoustic and magnetostatic wavepackets in a thin permalloy film and a waveguide fabricated on Si substrate. Direct measurements of the phase velocities reveal the transition from a coupled magneto-elastic wavepacket to Cherenkov-like radiation and the non-resonant regime, controlled by the detuning between magnon and phonon group velocities. The acoustic pulse is found to be affected by the excited magnetization dynamics only in the magneto-elastic regime.

Title: Folded State Dynamics -- A Geometric and Deterministic Origin of Irreversibility
Authors: Patrick BarAvi
Abstract: The emergence of irreversibility in isolated, deterministic systems remains a central challenge in statistical mechanics. Traditional approaches, such as Boltzmann's H-theorem and Lanford's derivation of the Boltzmann equation, rely on probabilistic assumptions and are limited to dilute gases and short timescales. We introduce Folded State Dynamics (FSD), a framework in which irreversibility arises from the geometric structure of phase space in systems with coupled rotational and translational degrees of freedom. In contrast to conventional models with unfolded, weakly coupled modes, FSD exhibits phase space folding, where deterministic coupling induces instability and chaotic mixing. We show that equilibrium states exponentially dominate the accessible phase space volume, while constrained configurations (e.g., pure rotation) occupy measure-zero subsets. This yields a geometric derivation of entropy growth, with reversal probabilities suppressed as Prev and recurrence times Trec, resolving Loschmidt's and Zermelo's objections without coarse-graining or fine-tuning. FSD is further extended to include charged systems (cFSD), where electromagnetic interactions continuously drive phase space folding. FSD thus offers a deterministic and testable mechanism for irreversibility, with implications ranging from confined colloids to the cosmological arrow of time

Title: Dynamic correlations of frustrated quantum spins from high-temperature expansion
Authors: Ruben Burkard, Benedikt Schneider, Björn Sbierski
Abstract: For quantum spin systems in equilibrium, the dynamic structure factor (DSF) is among the most feature-packed experimental observables. However, from a theory perspective it is often hard to simulate in an unbiased and accurate way, especially for frustrated and high-dimensional models at intermediate temperature. We address this challenge by introducing a dynamic extension of the high-temperature expansion as an efficient numerical approach to the DSF for arbitrary lattices. We focus on the nearest-neighbor Heisenberg model and spin-lengths S=1/2 and 1. We present a user-friendly numerical implementation and provide comprehensive benchmarks on spin chains. As applications we treat a variety of frustrated two- and three dimensional antiferromagnets. In particular we shed new light on the anomalous intermediate temperature regime of the S=1/2 triangular lattice model and reproduce the DSF measured recently for a S=1 pyrochlore material.

Title: Holstein mechanism in single-site model with unitary evolution
Authors: Chen-Huan Wu
Abstract: We investigate the Holstein mechanism in a single-electron (one-site) system, where unitary evolution intrinsically involves both fermion and boson operators under nonadiabatic conditions. The resulting unitary dynamics and boson-frequency dependence reveal a quantum phase transition, evidenced by distinct short-time (power-law decay) and long-time (exponential decay) behaviors, which are manifested in the polaronic shift, bosonic energy, and dynamics of reduced density matrix. This observation is consistent with a non-Markovian to Markovian transition.

Abstract: Is it feasible to alter the ground state properties of a material by engineering its electromagnetic environment? Inspired by theoretical predictions, experimental realizations of such cavity-controlled properties without optical excitation are beginning to emerge. Here, we devised and implemented a novel platform to realize cavity-altered materials. Single crystals of hyperbolic van der Waals (vdW) compounds provide a resonant electromagnetic environment with enhanced density of photonic states and superior quality factor. We interfaced hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) with the molecular superconductor $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Cu[N(CN)$_2$]Br ($\kappa$-ET). The frequencies of infrared (IR) hyperbolic modes of hBN match the IR-active carbon-carbon stretching molecular resonance of ($\kappa$-ET) implicated in superconductivity. Nano-optical data supported by first-principles molecular Langevin dynamics simulations confirm resonant coupling between the hBN hyperbolic cavity modes and the carbon-carbon stretching mode in ($\kappa$-ET). Meissner effect measurements via magnetic force microscopy demonstrate a strong suppression of superfluid density near the hBN/($\kappa$-ET) interface. Non-resonant control heterostructures, including RuCl$_3$/($\kappa$-ET) and hBN/$\text{Bi}_2\text{Sr}_2\text{CaCu}_2\text{O}_{8+x}$, do not display the superfluid suppression. These observations suggest that hBN/($\kappa$-ET) realizes a cavity-altered superconducting ground state. This work highlights the potential of dark cavities devoid of external photons for engineering electronic ground-state properties of materials using IR-active phonons.

Title: Generalized many-body exciton g-factors: magnetic hybridization and non-monotonic Rydberg series in monolayer WSe$_2$
Authors: Paulo E. Faria Junior, Daniel Hernangómez-Pérez, Tomer Amit, Jaroslav Fabian, Sivan Refaely-Abramson
Abstract: Magneto-optics of low dimensional semiconductors, such as monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides, offers a vast playground for exploring complex quantum phenomena. However, current ab initio approaches fail to capture important experimental observations related to brightening of excitonic levels and their g-factor dependence. Here, we develop a robust and general first principles framework for many-body exciton g-factors by incorporating off-diagonal terms for the spin and orbital angular momenta of single-particle bands and many-body states for magnetic fields pointing in arbitrary spatial directions. We implement our framework using many-body perturbation theory via the GW-Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) and supplement our analysis with robust symmetry-based models, establishing a fruitful synergy between many-body GW-BSE and group theory. Focusing on the archetypal monolayer WSe$_2$, we accurately reproduce the known results of the low-energy excitons including the Zeeman splitting and the dark/grey exciton brightening. Furthermore, our theory naturally reveals fundamental physical mechanisms of magnetic-field hybridization of higher-energy excitons (s- and p-like) and resolves the long-standing puzzle of the experimentally measured non-monotonic Rydberg series (1s-4s) of exciton g-factors. Our framework offers a comprehensive approach to investigate, rationalize, and predict the non-trivial interplay between magnetic fields, angular momenta, and many-body exciton physics in van der Waals systems.

Title: Uncovering relationships between the electronic self-energy and coupled-cluster doubles theory
Authors: Christopher J. N. Coveney
Abstract: We derive the coupled-cluster doubles (CCD) amplitude equations by introduction of the particle-hole-time decoupled electronic self-energy. The resulting analysis leads to an expression for the ground state correlation energy that is exactly of the form obtained in coupled-cluster doubles theory. We demonstrate the relationship to the ionization potential/electron affinity equation-of-motion coupled-cluster doubles (IP/EA-EOM-CCD) eigenvalue problem by coupling the reverse-time self-energy contributions while maintaining particle-hole separability. The formal relationships established are demonstrated by exact solution of the Hubbard dimer.

Title: Generalized Hall Conductivities in Local Commuting Projector Models: Generalized Symmetries and Protected Surface Modes
Authors: Po-Shen Hsin, Ryohei Kobayashi
Abstract: Hall conductivities are important characterizations of phases of matter. It is known that nonzero Hall conductivities are difficult to realize in local commuting projector lattice models due to no-go theorems in (2+1)D. In this work we construct local commuting projector models in (2+1)D and (3+1)D with nonzero generalized Hall conductivities for ordinary and higher-form continuous symmetries on tensor product Hilbert space of finite local dimension. The model is given by a standard $\mathbb{Z}_N$ toric code, but the symmetries do not admit expression in terms of onsite charge operators. The symmetry do not have local charges or currents on the lattice in the absence of boundaries, but there is still notion of Hall conductivities that coincide with the continuum field theories. We construct protected gapless boundaries of the lattice models using modified Villain formalism. The generalized Hall conductivities are computed by surface currents as well as bulk flux insertion and many body Chern number.

Title: Robustness of topological edge states in alternating spin chains against environment
Authors: Alexander Sattler, Maria Daghofer
Abstract: Both the Haldane spin-$1$ chain and dimerized chains of spin-$1/2$ exhibit topologically protected edge states that are robust against specific perturbations. Recently, such spin chains have been specifically assembled on surfaces and we investigate here the robustness of these edge states against coupling to the surface. Since no physical system can be considered perfectly isolated, it is crucial to examine whether topological robustness is maintained in the presence of environmental coupling. We apply exact diagonalization to a Lindblad master equation that couples an alternating Heisenberg spin chain based on spins $1/2$ to a surface via various jump operators. The robustness of topological states is assessed via the time evolution of quantities such as the ground-state degeneracy, correlation function, entropy, and magnetization of edge states. We investigate chains built from dimers with antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic intra-dimer coupling, which resemble Su-Schrieffer-Heeger and the Haldane models, resp., and assess the impact of $z$-axis anisotropy and longer-ranged couplings. Generally, we find that signatures of topological properties are more robust in Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-like chains than in Haldane-like chains.

Title: Measuring topological invariants of even-dimensional non-Hermitian systems through quench dynamics
Authors: Xiao-Dong Lin, Long Zhang
Abstract: The accurate determination of non-Hermitian (NH) topological invariants plays a central role in the study of NH topological phases. In this work, we propose a general framework for directly measuring NH topological invariants in even-dimensional systems through quench dynamics. Our approach hinges on constructing an auxiliary Hermitian matrix topologically equivalent to the original NH Hamiltonian, enabling topological characterization via reduced-dimensional momentum subspaces called band inversion surfaces (BISs). A key insight lies in the emergence of chiral symmetry in the NH Hamiltonian specifically on BISs -- a critical property that allows extension of the dynamical characterization scheme previously developed for odd-dimensional NH systems with chiral or sublattice symmetry [Lin et al., Phys. Rev. Res. 7, L012060 (2025)]. We show that NH topological invariants can be extracted from the winding patterns of a dynamical field constructed from post-quench spin textures on BISs. We demonstrate our approach through a detailed analysis of NH Chern insulators and then extend the framework to higher even-dimensional systems by introducing second-order BISs for characterization. This work establishes an experimentally accessible protocol for detecting NH topological invariants in quantum platforms.

Title: Simulating Neutral Atom Quantum Systems with Tensor Network States
Authors: James Allen, Matthew Otten, Stephen Gray, Bryan K. Clark
Abstract: In this paper, we describe a tensor network simulation of a neutral atom quantum system under the presence of noise, while introducing a new purity-preserving truncation technique that compromises between the simplicity of the matrix product state and the positivity of the matrix product density operator. We apply this simulation to a near-optimized iteration of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm on a transverse field Ising model in order to investigate the influence of large system sizes on the performance of the algorithm. We find that while circuits with a large number of qubits fail more often under noise that depletes the qubit population, their outputs on a successful measurement are just as robust under Rydberg atom dissipation or qubit dephasing as smaller systems. However, such circuits might not perform as well under coherent multi-qubit errors such as Rydberg atom crosstalk. We also find that the optimized parameters are especially robust to noise, suggesting that a noisier quantum system can be used to find the optimal parameters before switching to a cleaner system for measurements of observables.

Title: Accurate heat currents via reorganised master equation
Authors: Jonas Glatthard, Guillem Aznar-Menargues, José P. Palao, Daniel Alonso, Luis A.Correa
Abstract: The accurate characterisation of energy exchanges between nanoscale quantum systems and their environments is of paramount importance for quantum technologies, and central to quantum thermodynamics. Here, we show that, in order to accurately approximate steady-state heat currents via perturbative master equations, the coupling-induced reorganisation correction to the system's energy must be carefully taken into account. Not doing so, may yield sizeable errors, especially at low, or even moderate temperatures. In particular, we show how a 'reorganised master equation' can produce very accurate estimates for the heat currents when the reorganisation energy is weak and one works with environments with a broad spectrum. Notably, such master equation outperforms its 'non-reorganised' counterpart in the calculation of heat currents, at modelling dynamics, and at correctly capturing equilibration. This is so even if both types of equation are derived to the same order of perturbation theory. Most importantly, working with reorganised master equations does not involve additional complications when compared with alternative approaches. Also, invoking the secular approximation to secure thermodynamic consistency does not compromise their precision.

Title: Delayed phosphate release can highly improve energy efficiency of muscle contraction
Authors: Jiaxiang Xu, Jiangke Tao, Bin Chen
Abstract: While the power stroke of myosin and the release of inorganic phosphate (Pi) play crucial roles in transforming ATP's chemical energy into mechanical work across diverse biological systems, the exact temporal relationship between these events continues to be intensely debated. In this study, from a functional perspective, we computationally investigate the impact of Pi-release kinetics during the power stroke on muscle contraction dynamics. By implementing a mechanics model of the sarcomere unit that comprehensively incorporates the chemomechanical cycle of individual myosin molecules, we successfully replicate a broad range of experimental observations through parameter variation. Our simulation results reveal that delayed Pi-release can significantly enhance energy efficiency during muscle contraction. This work suggests that a gradual Pi-release that is not directly coupled with the lever arm swing may offer a route to adjust the stability of a working myosin on the actin filament, thereby modulating the power stroke to influence muscle contraction.

Title: The index of lattice Dirac operators and $K$-theory
Authors: Shoto Aoki, Hidenori Fukaya, Mikio Furuta, Shinichiroh Matsuo, Tetsuya Onogi, Satoshi Yamaguchi
Abstract: We mathematically show an equality between the index of a Dirac operator on a flat continuum torus and the $\eta$ invariant of a lattice Dirac operator known as the Wilson Dirac operator with a negative mass when the lattice spacing is sufficiently small. Unlike the standard approach, our formulation using $K$-theory does not require modified chiral symmetry on the lattice. We prove that a one-parameter family of continuum massive Dirac operators and the corresponding Wilson Dirac operators belong to the same equivalence class of the $K^1$ group at a finite lattice spacing. Their indices, which are evaluated by the spectral flow or equivalently by the $\eta$ invariant at a finite mass, are proved to be equal.

Title: Risk and cross validation in ridge regression with correlated samples
Authors: Alexander Atanasov, Jacob A. Zavatone-Veth, Cengiz Pehlevan
Abstract: Recent years have seen substantial advances in our understanding of high-dimensional ridge regression, but existing theories assume that training examples are independent. By leveraging techniques from random matrix theory and free probability, we provide sharp asymptotics for the in- and out-of-sample risks of ridge regression when the data points have arbitrary correlations. We demonstrate that in this setting, the generalized cross validation estimator (GCV) fails to correctly predict the out-of-sample risk. However, in the case where the noise residuals have the same correlations as the data points, one can modify the GCV to yield an efficiently-computable unbiased estimator that concentrates in the high-dimensional limit, which we dub CorrGCV. We further extend our asymptotic analysis to the case where the test point has nontrivial correlations with the training set, a setting often encountered in time series forecasting. Assuming knowledge of the correlation structure of the time series, this again yields an extension of the GCV estimator, and sharply characterizes the degree to which such test points yield an overly optimistic prediction of long-time risk. We validate the predictions of our theory across a variety of high dimensional data.

Title: A fluctuation-dissipation theorem perspective on radiative responses to temperature perturbations
Authors: Fabrizio Falasca, Aurora Basinski-Ferris, Laure Zanna, Ming Zhao
Abstract: Radiative forcing drives warming in the Earth system, leading to changes in sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and associated radiative feedbacks. The link between changes in the top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA) net radiative flux and SST patterns, known as the "pattern effect", is typically diagnosed by studying the response of atmosphere-only models to SST perturbations. In this work, we diagnose the pattern effect through response theory, by performing idealized warming perturbation experiments from unperturbed data alone. First, by studying the response at short time scales, where the response is dominated by atmospheric variability, we recover results that agree with the literature. Second, by extending the framework to longer time scales, we capture coupled interactions between the slow ocean component and the atmosphere, yielding a novel "sensitivity map" quantifying the response of the net radiative flux to SST perturbations in the coupled system. Here, feedbacks are captured by a spatiotemporal response operator, rather than time-independent maps as in traditional studies. Both formulations skillfully reconstruct changes in externally forced simulations and provide practical strategies for climate studies. The key distinction lies in their perspectives on climate feedbacks. The first formulation, closely aligned with prediction tasks, follows the traditional view in which slow variables, such as SSTs, exert a one-way influence on fast variables. The second formulation broadens this perspective by incorporating spatiotemporal interactions across state variables. This alternative approach explores how localized SST perturbations can alter the coupled dynamics, leading to temperature changes in remote areas and further impacting the radiative fluxes at later times.

Title: Single nuclear spin detection and control in a van der Waals material
Authors: Xingyu Gao, Sumukh Vaidya, Kejun Li, Zhun Ge, Saakshi Dikshit, Shimin Zhang, Peng Ju, Kunhong Shen, Yuanbin Jin, Yuan Ping, Tongcang Li
Abstract: Optically active spin defects in solids are leading candidates for quantum sensing and quantum networking. Recently, single spin defects were discovered in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), a layered van der Waals (vdW) material. Due to its two-dimensional structure, hBN allows spin defects to be positioned closer to target samples than in three-dimensional crystals, making it ideal for atomic-scale quantum sensing, including nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) of single molecules. However, the chemical structures of these defects remain unknown, and detecting a single nuclear spin with an hBN spin defect has been elusive. In this study, we created single spin defects in hBN using $^{13}$C ion implantation and identified three distinct defect types based on hyperfine interactions. We observed both S=1 and S=1/2 spin states within a single hBN spin defect. We demonstrated atomic-scale NMR and coherent control of individual nuclear spins in a vdW material, with a $\pi$-gate fidelity up to 99.75% at room temperature. By comparing experimental results with density-functional theory calculations, we propose chemical structures for these spin defects. Our work advances the understanding of single spin defects in hBN and provides a pathway to enhance quantum sensing using hBN spin defects with nuclear spins as quantum memories.

Title: Critical Dynamics of Random Surfaces: Time Evolution of Area and Genus
Authors: Christof Schmidhuber
Abstract: Conformal field theories with central charge $c\le1$ on random surfaces have been extensively studied in the past. Here, this discussion is extended from their equilibrium distribution to their critical dynamics. This is motivated by the conjecture that these models describe the time evolution of certain social networks that are self-driven to a critical point. This paper focuses on the dynamics of the overall area and the genus of the surface. The time evolution of the area is shown to follow a Cox Ingersol Ross process. Planar surfaces shrink, while higher genus surfaces grow to a size of order of the inverse cosmological constant. The time evolution of the genus is argued to lead to two different phases, dominated by (i) planar surfaces, and (ii) ``foamy'' surfaces, whose genus diverges. In phase (i), which exhibits critical phenomena, time variations of the order parameter are approximately t-distributed with 4 or more degrees of freedom.

Title: Collectively-modified inter-molecular electron correlations: The connection of polaritonic chemistry and spin glass physics
Authors: Dominik Sidler, Michael Ruggenthaler, Angel Rubio
Abstract: Polaritonic chemistry has garnered increasing attention in recent years due to pioneering experimental results, which show that site- and bond-selective chemistry at room temperature is achievable through strong collective coupling to field fluctuations in optical cavities. Despite these notable experimental strides, the underlying theoretical mechanisms remain unclear. In this focus review, we highlight a fundamental theoretical link between the seemingly unrelated fields of polaritonic chemistry and spin glasses, exploring its profound implications for the theoretical framework of polaritonic chemistry. Specifically, we present a mapping of the dressed many-molecules electronic-structure problem under collective vibrational strong coupling to the spherical Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SSK) model of a spin glass. This mapping uncovers a collectively induced instability of the intermolecular electron correlations, which could provide the long sought-after seed for significant local chemical modifications in polaritonic chemistry. Overall, the qualitative predictions made from the SSK model (e.g., dispersion effects, phase transitions, differently modified bulk and rare event properties, heating,...) agree well with available experimental observations. Our connection paves the way to incorporate, adjust and probe numerous spin glass concepts in polaritonic chemistry, such as modified fluctuation-dissipation relations, (non-equilibrium) aging dynamics, time-reversal symmetry breaking or stochastic resonances. Ultimately, the connection also offers fresh insights into the applicability of spin glass theory beyond condensed matter systems suggesting novel theoretical directions such as spin glasses with explicitly time-dependent (random) interactions.

Title: Quantum thermal machines in BTZ black hole spacetime
Authors: Dimitris Moustos, Obinna Abah
Abstract: We investigate an Otto thermodynamic cycle with a qubit Unruh-DeWitt detector as the working medium, coupled to a massless, conformally coupled scalar quantum field in the Hartle-Hawking vacuum in a (2+1)-dimensional BTZ black hole spacetime. We employ the thermal properties of the field to model heat and cold reservoirs between which the thermal machine operates. Treating the detector as an open quantum system, we employ a master equation to study its finite-time dynamics during each cycle stroke. We evaluate the output performance of the Otto heat engine and refrigerator by computing, respectively, the total work output and the cooling power for each of the Neumann, transparent, and Dirichlet boundary condition cases satisfied by the field at spatial infinity. Furthermore, we evaluate the optimal performance of the thermal machine by analyzing its efficiency at maximum power output and ecological impact. Our study presents a general framework for understanding the finite-time operation of relativistic quantum thermal machines, focusing on their energy optimization.

Abstract: The Superconducting Materials and Systems (SQMS) Center, a DOE National Quantum Information Science Research Center, has conducted a comprehensive and coordinated study using superconducting transmon qubit chips with known performance metrics to identify the underlying materials-level sources of device-to-device performance variation. Following qubit coherence measurements, these qubits of varying base superconducting metals and substrates have been examined with various nondestructive and invasive material characterization techniques at Northwestern University, Ames National Laboratory, and Fermilab as part of a blind study. We find trends in variations of the depth of the etched substrate trench, the thickness of the surface oxide, and the geometry of the sidewall, which when combined, lead to correlations with the T$_1$ lifetime across different devices. In addition, we provide a list of features that varied from device to device, for which the impact on performance requires further studies. Finally, we identify two low-temperature characterization techniques that may potentially serve as proxy tools for qubit measurements. These insights provide materials-oriented solutions to not only reduce performance variations across neighboring devices, but also to engineer and fabricate devices with optimal geometries to achieve performance metrics beyond the state-of-the-art values.

Title: Large time cumulants of the KPZ equation on an interval
Authors: Guillaume Barraquand, Pierre Le Doussal
Abstract: We consider the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation on the interval $[0,L]$ with Neumann type boundary conditions and boundary parameters $u,v$. We show that the $k$-th order cumulant of the height behaves as $c_k(L,u,v)\, t$ in the large time limit $t \to +\infty$, and we compute the coefficients $c_k(L,u,v)$. We obtain an expression for the upper tail large deviation function of the height. We also consider the limit of large $L$, with $u=\tilde u/\sqrt{L}$, $u=\tilde v/\sqrt{L}$, which should give the same quantities for the two parameter family $(\tilde u, \tilde v)$ KPZ fixed point on the interval. We employ two complementary methods. On the one hand we adapt to the interval the replica Bethe ansatz method pioneered by Brunet and Derrida for the periodic case. On the other hand, we perform a scaling limit using previous results available for the open ASEP. The latter method allows to express the cumulants of the KPZ equation in terms a functional equation involving an integral operator.

Title: Extended Tsallis-Cirto entropy for black and white holes
Authors: G.E. Volovik
Abstract: In reference [1] we considered the black hole thermodynamics with the non-extensive entropy. This entropy obeys the composition rule which coincides with the composition rule in the non-extensive Tsallis-Cirto $\delta=2$ statistics. Here we extend this approach to the thermodynamics of white holes. The entropy of the white hole is negative as follows from the rate of macroscopic quantum tunneling from black hole to white hole. The white hole entropy is with the minus sign the entropy of the black hole with the same mass, $S_{\rm WH}(M)=-S_{\rm BH}(M)$. This reflects the anti-symmetry with respect to time reversal, at which the shift vector in the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner formalism changes sign. This symmetry allows one to extend the Tsallis-Chirto entropy by adding a minus sign to the Tsallis-Chirto formula applied to white hole. As a result, the composition rule remains the same, with the only difference being that instead of entropy it contains the entropy modulus. The same non-extensive composition rule is obtained for the entropy of the Reissner-Nordström black hole. This entropy is formed by the positive entropy of the outer horizon and the negative entropy of the inner horizon. The model of the black hole formed by "black hole atoms" with Planck-scale mass is also extended to include the negative entropy of white holes.

Title: Strict advantage of complex quantum theory in a communication task
Authors: Thomas J. Elliott
Abstract: Standard formulations of quantum theory are based on complex numbers: Quantum states can be in superpositions, with weights given by complex probability amplitudes. Motivated by quantum theory promising a range of practical advantages over classical for a multitude of tasks, we investigate how the presence of complex amplitudes in quantum theory can yield operational advantages over counterpart real formulations. We identify a straightforward communication task for which complex quantum theory exhibits a provably lower communication cost than not just any classical approach, but also any approach based on real quantum theory. We certify the necessity of complex quantum theory for optimal approaches to the task through geometric properties of quantum state ensembles that witness the presence of basis-independent complexity. This substantiates a strict operational advantage of complex quantum theory. We discuss the relevance of this finding for quantum advantages in stochastic simulation.

Title: Twisted Partition Functions as Order Parameters
Authors: Jun Maeda, Yuya Tanizaki
Abstract: For quantum field theories with global symmetry, we can study the behavior of the partition function with the background gauge field to diagnose different quantum phases. For the case of discrete symmetries, we find that the symmetry-twisted partition function works as an order parameter that discriminates spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB), symmetry-protected topological (SPT) states, and symmetry-enriched topological (SET) states. We then consider its application to the case of 4d Yang-Mills theory with adjoint matters to understand the relation between the twisted partition function and the Wilson-'t Hooft classification. We also study its behavior for the spontaneously broken U(1) symmetry and interpret the result from the viewpoint of the mixed anomaly with the emergent solitonic symmetry.

Title: Bubble-Burst Synthesis of Ammonia, Amino Acids, and Urea Under Ambient, Catalyst-Free Conditions
Authors: Jerome J. Cuomo, Ian Goodall, C. Richard Guarnieri, Gennaro (Jerry)Cuomo, Stephen Hudak
Abstract: This study introduces a catalyst-free, ambient-temperature method for synthesizing nitrogen-based compounds critical to fertilizer production, including ammonia, urea, ammonium salts, and amino acids. The process relies on bubble-burst-induced microenvironments, where gas bubbles undergo rapid growth and collapse, releasing intense localized energy sufficient to dissociate nitrogen and water molecules. These high-energy zones produce reactive species, including atomic hydrogen (H*) that facilitate nitrogen fixation and drive subsequent chemical transformations without needing catalysts or elevated conditions. Experimental validation using colorimetric assays, Raman spectroscopy, and microscopy confirms the in situ formation of ammonia and its downstream conversion into structurally relevant compounds, including peptide-like assemblies. The system supports reaction tuning through dissolved carbon dioxide (CO2) or organic acids and can be enhanced by low-energy inputs such as UV or ultrasound. Its simplicity, modularity, and ability to operate without external infrastructure offer a practical and scalable platform for decentralized fertilizer generation and sustainable biochemical production.
