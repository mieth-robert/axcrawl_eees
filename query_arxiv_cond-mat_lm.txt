Title: Modeling the time evolution of a camphor rotor perturbed by a stationary camphor source
Authors: Jerzy Gorecki, Yuki Koyano, Hiroyuki Kitahata
Abstract: A self-propelled motion resulting from the dissipation of camphor molecules on the water surface has been attracting scientific attention for more than 200 years. A generally accepted description of the phenomenon includes equations for the object motion coupled with the hydrodynamics of Marangoni flows and the time evolution of camphor surface concentration. The solution of such equations is a numerically complex problem. In recent publications, an alternative approach based on Hamiltonian including the potential term representing Marangoni interactions has been applied to simulate the time evolution of camphor rotors. Such a model represents a significant numerical simplification if compared to the standard description. Here, we comment on the applicability of Hamiltonian approach by applying it to a single camphor rotor perturbed by a camphor disk fixed on the water surface. We demonstrate that in such a case, the approach leads to the results qualitatively different from the experimental ones. Therefore, we doubt in its applicability to describe the time evolution of interacting camphor rotors. We also show that the approximation of the Marangoni forces by a potential gives more realistic results if used together with the equation of motion that includes the hydrodynamic friction. Still, a better agreement with experiments can be obtained by considering an additional equation for the time evolution of camphor surface concentration.

Title: Observing structural disorder induced interacting topological phase in an atom array
Authors: Zongpei Yue, Yu-Feng Mao, Xinhui Liang, Zhen-Xing Hua, Peiyun Ge, Yu-Xin Chao, Kai Li, Chen Jia, Meng Khoon Tey, Yong Xu, Li You
Abstract: Topological phases of matter can appear in noninteracting systems, as in band topology, or interacting systems, such as in spin models, with their defining features typically robust against weak disorder. Intriguingly, disorder itself can also induce topological phases--exemplified by the Anderson topological insulator in noninteracting systems. Experimental studies on disorder induced topology have so far been limited to band topology. Here we report direct observations of structural disorder induced many-body interacting topological phase in an atom array at half-filling, whereby random offsets to tweezer locations forming a lattice implement structural disorder, causing fluctuating long-range dipolar interactions between tweezer confined single atoms. The ground state degeneracy in disordered configurations is detected and compared to a regular lattice. The induced topological phase is also vindicated by the spatially resolved atom-atom correlation functions for different forms of dimer compositions. By probing the quench dynamics of a highly excited state, we observe markedly slower decay of edge spin magnetization in comparison to the bulk spin one, consistent with the presence of topologically protected edge modes in disordered lattices. Our experiments open a new direction for studying the interplay between structural disorder and strongly interacting topological matter in Rydberg atom arrays.

Title: Manipulating the topological spin of Majoranas
Authors: Stijn R. de Wit, Emre Duman, A. Mert Bozkurt, Alexander Brinkman, Inanc Adagideli
Abstract: The non-Abelian exchange statistics of Majorana zero modes make them interesting for both technological applications and fundamental research. Unlike their non-Abelian counterpart, the Abelian contribution $e^{i \theta}$, where $\theta$ is directly related to the Majorana's topological spin, is often neglected. However, the Abelian exchange phase and hence the topological spin can differ from system to system. For vortices in topological superconductors, the Abelian exchange phase is interpreted as an Aharonov-Casher phase arising from a vortex encircling an $e/4$ charge. In this work, we show how this fractional charge and hence the topological spin can be manipulated, introducing an additional knob for braiding operations in topological quantum computing. To probe this effect, we propose a vortex interference experiment that reveals the effect of this fractional charge through measurable shifts in the critical current.

Title: Emergent magnetism and spin liquids in an extended Hubbard description of moiré bilayers
Authors: Zhenhao Song, Urban F. P. Seifert, Leon Balents, Hong-Chen Jiang
Abstract: Motivated by twisted transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), we study an extended Hubbard model with both on-site and off-site repulsive interactions, in which Mott insulating states with concomitant charge order occur at fractional fillings. To resolve the charge ordering as well as the fate of the local moments formed thereby, we perform large-scale density matrix renormalization group calculations on cylindrical geometries for several filling fractions and ranges of interaction strength. Depending on the precise parameter regime, both antiferromagnetically ordered as well as quantum-disordered states are found, with a particularly prominent example being a quantum spin liquid-type ground state on top of charge-ordering with effective Kagomé geometry. We discuss the different mechanisms at play in stabilizing various electronic and magnetic states. The results suggest that moiré TMDs are a promising venue for emergent quantum magnetism of strongly interacting electrons.

Title: Simulating the non-unitary Yang-Lee conformal field theory on the fuzzy sphere
Authors: Ruihua Fan, Junkai Dong, Ashvin Vishwanath
Abstract: The fuzzy sphere method has enjoyed great success in the study of (2+1)-dimensional unitary conformal field theories (CFTs) by regularizing them as quantum Hall transitions on the sphere. Here, we extend this approach to the Yang-Lee CFT-the simplest non-unitary CFT. We use an Ising quantum-Hall ferromagnet Hamiltonian with a transverse field and an imaginary longitudinal field, the latter breaks the Hermiticity of the Hamiltonian and thus the unitarity of the associated quantum field theory. Non-unitary conformal field theories-particularly the Yang-Lee CFT-pose significant challenges to conventional fuzzy sphere approaches. To overcome these obstacles, here we utilize a different method for determining critical points that requires no a priori knowledge of CFT scaling dimensions. Our method instead leverages the state-operator correspondence while utilizing two complementary criteria: the conformality of the energy spectrum and its consistency with conformal perturbation theory. We also discuss a new finite-size scaling on the fuzzy sphere that allows us to extract conformal data more reliably, and compare it with the conventional analysis using the (1+1)-dimensional Yang-Lee problem as an example. Our results show broad agreement with previous Monte-Carlo and conformal bootstrap results. We also uncover one previously unknown primary operator and several operator product expansion coefficients.

Title: Operator Spreading, Duality, and the Noisy Long-Range FKPP Equation
Authors: Tianci Zhou, Éric Brunet, Xiaolin Qi
Abstract: Operator spreading provides a new characterization of quantum chaos beyond the semi-classical limit. There are two complementary views of how the characteristic size of an operator, also known as the butterfly light cone, grows under chaotic quantum time evolution: A discrete stochastic population dynamics or a stochastic reaction-diffusion equation in the continuum. When the interaction decays as a power function of distance, the discrete population dynamics model features superlinear butterfly light cones with stretched exponential or power-law scaling. Its continuum counterpart, a noisy long-range Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piscunov (FKPP) equation, remains less understood. We use a mathematical duality to demonstrate their equivalence through an intermediate model, which replaces the hard local population limit by an equilibrium population. Through an algorithm with no finite size effect, we demonstrate numerically remarkable agreements in their light cone scalings.

Title: Fractional Chern Insulators and Competing States in a Twisted MoTe$_2$ Lattice Model
Authors: Yuchi He, S.H. Simon, S.A. Parameswaran
Abstract: We construct an interacting lattice model for twisted $\mathrm{MoTe}_{2}$ bilayers at a twist angle of approximately 3.7\degree. We use the infinite density matrix renormalization group (iDMRG) in a cylinder geometry to identify a variety of competing integer and fractional Chern insulators and charge density wave (CDW) states that emerge upon the spontaneous breaking of time reversal symmetry by valley polarization. We use finite-size analysis to establish the robustness of Chern insulating states even in geometries that admit competing CDWs, and explore the phase transitions between these states driven by increasing sublattice potential or interaction strength. Our work highlights the crucial role played by direct spin exchange in stabilizing the parent valley-polarized Chern ferromagnet band, and by the mixing with higher bands in destabilizing CIs/FCIs in favor of CDW orders.

Title: Soft Electromechanical Elastomers Impervious to Instability
Authors: Daniel Katusele, Carmel Majidi, Kaushik Dayal, Pradeep Sharma
Abstract: Soft dielectric elastomers that can exhibit extremely large deformations under the action of an electric field enable applications such as soft robotics, biomedical devices, energy harvesting among others. A key impediment in the use of dielectric elastomers is failure through instability mechanisms or dielectric breakdown. In this work, using a group-theory based approach, we provide a closed-form solution to the bifurcation problem of a paradigmatical elastomer actuator and discover an interesting result: at a critical electric field, the elastomer becomes impervious to Treloar-Kearsley instability. This limit is reached prior to the typical dielectric breakdown threshold. Our results thus establish a regime of electrical and mechanical loads where the dielectric elastomer is invulnerable to all common failure modes.

Title: Defects in vibrated monolayers of equilateral triangular prisms
Authors: Jorge Vega, Enrique Velasco, Yuri Martinez-Raton
Abstract: We present experimental results in which a quasimonolayer of grains, shaped as equilateral triangular prisms, is vertically vibrated within circular and square confining cavities. The system exhibits a fluid phase characterized by sixfold orientational order. However, the specific geometries of the cavities frustrate this order, leading to the excitation of topological defects that adhere to topological principles. We analyze the distribution of topological charges of these defects and their evolution as a function of the container geometry. In particular, we find that in the circular cavity, both the number and charge of defects remain constant in the steady-state regime, with only defects of charge $+1$ being excited. In contrast, within the square cavity, with the same topology as the circular cavity, some defects become pinned to the corners of the cavity, developing charges of $+1$ or $+2$. Additionally, free defects with charges of $\pm 1$ can be excited. Notably, dynamic events occur, such as the fusion of two defects or the creation of two defects from a single one. These events are governed by the conservation of total charge within the cavity and give rise to various system configurations, with rapid transitions between them. The observed dynamic fluctuations in topological charge are remarkable, influenced by both particle shape and cavity geometry. This system of vertically vibrated (dissipative) granular monolayers presents a unique and simple platform for studying topological phenomena, with potential implications for topological effects in equilibrium-oriented fluids.

Title: From continuum excitations to sharp magnons via transverse magnetic field in the spin-1/2 Ising-like triangular lattice antiferromagnet Na2BaCo(PO4)2
Authors: Leonie Woodland, Ryutaro Okuma, J. Ross Stewart, Christian Balz, Radu Coldea
Abstract: We report high-resolution inelastic neutron scattering measurements of the excitation spectrum in large single crystals of the spin-1/2 triangular lattice Ising-like antiferromagnet Na2BaCo(PO4)2 in magnetic fields applied transverse to the Ising axis. In the high-field polarized phase above a critical field $B_{C}$ we observe sharp magnons, as expected in the case of no exchange disorder. Through simultaneous fits to the dispersions including data in polarizing field along the Ising axis, we obtain an excellent match to an Ising-like XXZ Hamiltonian and rule out previously proposed Kitaev exchanges. In the intermediate-field phase below $B_{C}$, we observe three dispersive modes, out of which only the lowest energy one is sharp and the others are broad and overlap with continuum scattering. We propose that the broadening effects are due to magnon decays into two-magnon excitations and confirm that such processes are kinematically allowed. The continuum scattering becomes progressively stronger upon lowering field and, at 0.25 T and zero field, it dominates the complete spectrum with no clear evidence for even broadened magnon modes. We discuss the relevance of the continuous manifold of mean-field degenerate ground states of the refined Hamiltonian for capturing the observed spectrum in zero field, and compare the data with the one- and two-magnon spectrum averaged over this manifold. We also propose a model of the interlayer couplings to explain the observed finite interlayer magnetic propagation vector of the zero-field magnetic order; this requires the breaking of the mirror symmetry in the nominal P-3m1 space group and through refinement of x-ray diffraction data on an untwinned single crystal, we indeed confirm a rotation of the CoO6 octahedra around the c-axis, which lowers the symmetry to P-3.

Title: Viscous flow model of ion-induced pattern formation: consistency between theory and experiment
Authors: Tyler P. Evans, Scott A. Norris
Abstract: It is known that ion-irradiation can lead surfaces to spontaneously develop patterns with characteristic length scales on the order of only a few nanometers. Pattern formation typically occurs only for irradiation angles beyond a critical angle, which varies with projectile, target, and irradiation energy. To date, there is no completely unifying physical theory. However, since predictions of the critical angle can be extracted from linear stability analysis of a given model, the ability to explain critical angle selection is a simple but important test of model validity. In this paper, we survey all existing critical angle, wavelength, and in-plane stress data for noble gas broad beam ion-irradiation of silicon and germanium by argon, krypton and xenon at energies from 250eV to 2keV. While neglecting the effects of erosion and redistribution, which are widely regarded as key contributors to ion-induced pattern formation, we find that a viscous flow model is capable of explaining these three types of experimental data simultaneously using only parameters within a physically-reasonable range, and in a manner consistent with the defect kinetics of the amorphous layer. This bolsters the case for viscous flow and stress-driven instabilities as important components of an eventual, unifying model of nanoscale pattern formation under ion bombardment.

Title: Magnetothermal Properties with Sampled Effective Local Field Estimation
Authors: Nicholas Brawand, Nima Leclerc, Emiko Zumbro
Abstract: We introduce a first-principles method for predicting the magnetothermal properties of solid-state materials, which we call Sampled Effective Local Field Estimation. This approach achieves over two orders of magnitude improvement in sample efficiency compared to current state-of-the-art methods, as demonstrated on representative material systems. We validate our predictions against experimental data for well-characterized magnetic materials, showing excellent agreement. The method is fully automated and requires minimal computational resources, making it well suited for integration into high-throughput materials discovery workflows. Our method offers a scalable and accurate predictive framework that can accelerate the design of next-generation materials for magnetic refrigeration, cryogenic cooling, and magnetic memory technologies.

Title: Phase field model for viscous inclusions in anisotropic networks
Authors: Aakanksha Gubbala, Anika M. Jena, Daniel P. Arnold, Sho C. Takatori
Abstract: The growth of viscous two-dimensional lipid domains in contact with a viscoelastic actin network was recently shown to exhibit unusual lipid domain ripening due to the geometry and anisotropy of the actin network [Arnold & Takatori. Langmuir. 40, 26570-26578 (2024)]. In this work, we interpret previous experimental results on lipid membrane-actin composites with a theoretical model that combines the Cahn-Hilliard and Landau-de Gennes liquid crystal theory. In our model, we incorporate fiber-like characteristics of actin filaments and bundles through a nematic order parameter, and elastic anisotropy through cubic nematic gradients. Numerical simulations qualitatively agree with experimental observations, by reproducing the competition between the thermodynamic forces that coarsen lipid domains versus the elastic forces generated by the surrounding actin network that resist domain coarsening. We observe a significant decrease in the growth of domain sizes in the range of $R(t) \sim t^{0.05-0.25}$ for different actin network stiffness, in sharp contrast to the $\sim t^{1/3}$ scaling for diffusive growth of domains in the absence of the actin network. Our findings may serve as a foundation for future developments in modeling elastic ripening in complex systems.

Title: Nodeless Hybridization as Proof of Trivial Topology in Samarium Hexaboride

Abstract: Calculations unanimously predict samarium hexaboride to be a topological Kondo insulator, the first topological insulator driven by strong electron correlation. As of today it appears also experimentally established as the only representative of this material class. Here, we investigate the three-dimensional band structure of SmB$_6$ and show that it is incompatible with a topological Kondo insulator which must have hybridization nodes at high-symmetry points. In addition we clarify the remaining questions concerning the nature of the surface states with new data. We address consequences for the search for correlated topological insulators.

Title: Multiple Scattering of Elastic Waves in Polycrystals
Authors: Anubhav Roy, Christopher M. Kube
Abstract: Elastic waves that propagate in polycrystalline materials attenuate due to scattering of energy out of the primary propagation direction in addition to becoming dispersive in their group and phase velocities. Attenuation and dispersion are modeled through multiple scattering theory to describe the mean displacement field or the mean elastodynamic Green's function. The Green's function is governed by the Dyson equation and was solved previously (Weaver, 1990) by truncating the multiple scattering series at first-order, which is known as the first-order smoothing approximation (FOSA). FOSA allows for multiple scattering but places a restriction on the scattering events such that a scatterer can only be visited once during a particular multiple scattering process. In other words, recurrent scattering between two scatterers is not permitted. In this article, the Dyson equation is solved using the second-order smoothing approximation (SOSA). The SOSA permits scatterers to be visited twice during the multiple scattering process and, thus, provides a more complete picture of the multiple scattering effects on elastic waves. The derivation is valid at all frequencies spanning the Rayleigh, stochastic, and geometric scattering regimes without additional approximations that limit applicability in strongly scattering cases (like the Born approximation). The importance of SOSA is exemplified through analyzing specific weak and strongly scattering polycrystals. Multiple scattering effects contained in SOSA are shown to be important at the beginning of the stochastic scattering regime and are particularly important for transverse (shear) waves. This step forward opens the door for a deeper fundamental understanding of multiple scattering phenomena in polycrystalline materials.

Title: Machine Learning Tool to Analyse Spectroscopic Changes in High-Dimensional Data
Authors: Alberto Martinez-Serra, Gionni Marchetti, Francesco D'Amico, Ivana Fenoglio, Barbara Rossi, Marco P. Monopoli, Giancarlo Franzese
Abstract: Fibrinogen is an abundant protein found in human blood plasma that plays crucial roles in various physiological processes. When nanoparticles (NPs) are introduced into a biological solution, layers of biomolecules form on their surface, creating a corona. Understanding how the structure of the protein evolves into the corona is essential for evaluating the safety and toxicity of nanotechnology. However, the influence of NP properties on protein conformation is not well understood. In this study, we propose a new method that addresses this issue by analyzing multi-component spectral data using Machine Learning (ML). We apply the method to fibrinogen at blood concentrations while interacting with hydrophobic carbon or hydrophilic silicon dioxide NPs, revealing striking differences in the temperature dependence of the protein structure between the two cases. Our unsupervised ML method a) does not suffer from the challenges associated with the curse of dimensionality, and b) simultaneously handles spectral data from various sources. The method provides a deeper understanding of the correlation between protein structure and NP interactions, which could support the development of nanomedical tools to treat various conditions.

Title: Microscopic lattice model for quartic semi-Dirac fermions in two dimensions
Authors: Mohamed M. Elsayed, Valeri N. Kotov
Abstract: We propose a lattice model for the realization of exotic quartic semi-Dirac fermions, i.e. quasiparticles exhibiting a dispersion with quartic momentum dependence in a given direction, and a linear dependence in the perpendicular direction. A tight binding model is employed, allowing for hopping between up to fourth nearest neighbors and anisotropic hopping parameters. In addition, we introduce the effects of electron-electron interactions (both long-range Coulomb, and short range) which are necessary to stabilize the quartic semi-Dirac phase; without interactions the lattice is unstable towards formation of anisotropic Dirac cones.

Title: Band topology and dynamic multiferroicity induced from dynamical Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions in centrosymmetric lattices
Authors: Bowen Ma, Z. D. Wang
Abstract: We develop a theory of a dynamical Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (dDMI) in centrosymmetric crystals by generally considering the vibration of both cations and anions. It gives rise to an antisymmetric spin-lattice coupling, inducing magnon-phonon hybridized topological excitations. Moreover, we find that this dDMI naturally exhibits a magnetoelectric feature, leading to the presence of dynamic multiferroicity with finite toroidal moment distribution in the momentum space. By comparing the toroidal moments with the band skyrmion structure, we reveal the intrinsic connection between band topology and dynamic multiferroicity through the dDMI.

Title: Transient size segregation of binary granular mixtures
Authors: Soniya Kumawat, Anurag Tripathi
Abstract: Transient size segregation of a bi-disperse granular mixture flowing over a periodic chute is studied using DEM simulations and theory. A recently developed particle force-based size segregation model has been shown to successfully predict the steady state behavior of binary granular mixtures [1]. This promising model is used to predict the time-dependent segregation of different size binary mixtures in this work. A one dimensional continuum model is developed to solve the convection-diffusion equation by incorporating a mixture segregation model along with rheological model. The inter-coupling of segregation with rheology is accounted to predict evolution of species concentration. We also investigate the effect of different initial configurations (Large near base (LNB), Small near base (SNB) and well-mixed) on the transient evolution of the flow and segregation. The particle force-based segregation model is able to predict the evolution of the concentration profile for all three initial configurations for smallest size ratio of 1.25. Significant deviations, however, are observable for larger size ratios, suggesting the need to account for the evolution of the velocity field in the model.

Title: General First-Principles Approach to Crystals in Finite Magnetic Fields
Authors: Chengye Lü, Yingwei Chen, Yuzhi Wang, Zhihao Dai, Zhong Fang, Xin-Gao Gong, Quansheng Wu, Hongjun Xiang
Abstract: We introduce a general first-principles methodology for computing electronic structure in a finite uniform magnetic field which allows for an arbitrary rational magnetic flux and nonlocal pseudopotentials, at a comparable time complexity of conventional plane-wave pseudopotential approaches in zero-field conditions. The versatility of this method is demonstrated through comprehensive applications to both molecular and crystalline systems, including calculations of magnetizabilities, magnetically induced currents, and magnetic energy bands. Furthermore, we provide rigorous proofs of two fundamental properties for crystals in uniform magnetic fields: the "strong translational symmetry" and "magnetic bands shift" phenomena.

Title: Protected Symmetrical Superconducting Qubit Based on Quantum Flux Parametron
Authors: Kian Rafati Sajedi, Mojtaba Hosseinpour Choubi, Mehdi Fardmanesh
Abstract: Conventional Quantum Flux Parametrons (QFPs) have historically been used for storing classical bits in Josephson junction-based computers. In this work, we propose a novel QFP-based topology dubbed "Degenerium" qubit, to process and compute quantum information. Degenerium combines principles from the 0-$\pi$ qubit and flux qubit to create ideally degenerate quantum ground states, while significantly simplifying the 0-$\pi$ qubit structure. The symmetrical design of Degenerium enables easier qubit control and fabrication. We demonstrate that due to the inherent symmetry of Degenerium, our designed qubit is insensitive to fabrication-induced variations in critical current ($I_c$) of the Josephson junctions. Our calculations of depolarization and dephasing rates due to charge, flux, and critical current noise sources result in depolarization and dephasing times of 1.25 s and 90 $\mu$s, respectively. Further parameter tuning and optimization is possible to meet specific application demands.

Title: Optically induced spin Hall current in Janus transition-metal dichalcogenides
Authors: Tomoaki Kameda, Katsunori Wakabayashi
Abstract: Monolayer Janus transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), such as WSeTe, exhibit Rashba-type spin-orbit coupling (SOC) due to broken out-of-plane mirror symmetry. Here, we theoretically demonstrate that pure spin Hall currents can be generated under light irradiation based on a tight-binding model. Rashba-type SOC plays a crucial role in determining the spin polarization direction and enhancing the generation efficiency of pure spin Hall currents. Our findings establish Janus TMDCs as promising materials for next-generation optospintronic devices.

Title: Interface-Bound States and Majorana Zero Modes in Lateral Heterostructures of Bi$_2$Se$_3$ and Sb$_2$Te$_3$ with Proximity-Induced Superconductivity
Authors: Yoonkang Kim
Abstract: We present a comprehensive investigation into the emergence of interface-bound states, particularly Majorana zero modes (MZMs), in a lateral heterostructure composed of two three-dimensional topological insulators (TIs), Bi$_2$Se$_3$ and Sb$_2$Te$_3$, under the influence of proximity-induced superconductivity from niobium (Nb) contacts. We develop an advanced two-dimensional Dirac model for the topological surface states (TSS), incorporating spatially varying chemical potentials and s-wave superconducting pairing. Using the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) formalism, we derive analytical solutions for the bound states and compute the local density of states (LDOS) at the interface, revealing zero-energy modes characteristic of MZMs. The topological nature of these states is rigorously analyzed through winding numbers and Pfaffian invariants, and their robustness is explored under various physical perturbations, including gating effects. Our findings highlight the potential of this heterostructure as a platform for topological quantum computing, with detailed predictions for experimental signatures via tunneling spectroscopy.

Title: Doping Topological Dirac Semimetal with magnetic impurities: electronic structure of Mn-doped Cd$_3$As$_2$
Authors: H. Ness, I. Leahy, A. Rice, D. Pashov, K. Alberi, M. van Schilfgaarde
Abstract: The prospect of transforming a Dirac topological semimetal (TSM) into a Weyl TSM phase, following doping by magnetic impurities, is central to TSM applications. The magnetic field from polarized $d$ levels of magnetic impurities produces a field with a sharp local structure. To what extent magnetic impurities act in the same manner as an applied field and what are the effects of such a field on the electronic structure of a Dirac TSM is the subject of this paper. We present electronic structure calculations of bulk Cd$_3$As$_2$ with substitutional doping of Mn impurities in the dilute alloy range. Quasi-particle $GW$ (QS$GW$) ab-initio electronic structure calculations are used in conjunction with $k \cdot p$ model Hamiltonian calculations. As expected, we observe the splitting of the Dirac points into pairs of Weyl points following the doping with Mn. We also show that the electronic structure of Mn-doped Cd$_3$As$_2$ can be emulated by the electronic structure of pristine Cd$_3$As$_2$ with an appropriate external magnetic field. Some properties of the conductivity of bulk Cd$_3$As$_2$ for different magnetic field orientations are also investigated. Our results inform future opportunities for unique device functionality based on band structure tuning not found in conventional magnetic Weyl TSM.

Title: Critical States of Fermions with ${\mathbb{Z}}_2$ Flux Disorder
Authors: Hiranmay Das, Naba P. Nayak, Soumya Bera, Vijay B. Shenoy
Abstract: Motivated by many contemporary problems in condensed matter physics where matter particles experience random gauge fields, we investigate the physics of fermions on a square lattice with $\pi$-flux (that realizes Dirac fermions at low energies), subjected to flux disorder arising from a random ${\mathbb{Z}}_2$ gauge field that results from the presence of flux defects (plaquettes with zero flux). At half-filling, where the system possesses BDI symmetry, we show that a new class of critical phases is realized, with the states at zero energy showing a multifractal character. The multifractal properties depend on the concentration $\mathfrak{c}$ of the $\pi$-flux defects and spatial correlations between the flux defects. These states are characterized by the singularity spectrum, Lyapunov exponents, and transport properties. For any concentration of flux defects, we find that the multi-fractal spectrum shows termination, but $\textit{not freezing}$. We characterize this class of critical states by uncovering a relation between the conductivity and the Lyapunov exponent, which is satisfied by the states irrespective of the concentration or the local correlations between the flux defects. We demonstrate that renormalization group methods, based on perturbing the Dirac point, fail to capture this new class of critical states. This work not only offers new challenges to theory, but is also likely to be useful in understanding a variety of problems where fermions interact with discrete gauge fields.

Title: Fluxon cotunneling in coupled Josephson junctions: Perturbation theory
Authors: Andrew G. Semenov, Alex Latyshev, Andrei D. Zaikin
Abstract: We investigate the effects of fluxon cotunneling and quantum Coulomb drag in a system of two small Josephson junctions coupled by means of mutual capacitance $C_m$. Depending on the value of $C_m$ we identify three different regimes of strong, intermediate and weak coupling. Focusing our attention on the last two regimes we develop a perturbation theory in the interaction and explicitly derive fluxon cotunneling amplitudes at sufficiently small mutual capacitance values. We demonstrate that the Coulomb drag effect survives at any non-zero $C_m$ and evaluate the non-local voltage response that is in general determined by a trade off between two different cotunneling processes. Our predictions can be straightforwardly generalized to bilinear Josephson chains and directly verified in future experiments.

Title: Topological properties of a chain of interacting electrons
Authors: Igor N.Karnaukhov, E. E. Krasovskii
Abstract: Within the framework of a one-dimensional model of interacting electrons, the ground state of an electron liquid is studied. Using the exact solution of the model, the ground state phase diagram and zero-energy Majorana edge functions in a finite chain are calculated. The winding number invariant reflects the topological nature of the electron liquid. The phase diagram includes two topological phases with different winding number invariants, the topologically trivial Mott insulator phase, and three critical phase transition points. Numerical calculations confirm and illustrate the analytical results.

Title: Supersonic Flow Past an Obstacle in a Quasi-Two-Dimensional Lee-Huang-Yang Quantum Fluid
Authors: G. H. dos Santos, L. F. Calazans de Brito, A. Gammal, A. M. Kamchatnov
Abstract: A supersonic flow past an obstacle can generate a rich variety of wave excitations. This paper investigates, both analytically and numerically, two types of excitations generated by the flow of a Lee-Huang-Yang quantum fluid past an obstacle: linear radiation and oblique dark solitons. We show that wave crests of linear radiation can be accurately described by the proper modification of the Kelvin original theory, while the oblique dark soliton solution is obtained analytically by transformation of the 1D soliton solution to the obstacle's reference frame. A comparison between analytical predictions and numerical simulations demonstrates good agreement, validating our theoretical approach.

Title: Self-organization of active rod suspensions on fluid membranes and thin viscous films
Authors: Arijit Mahapatra, Ronit Freeman, Ehssan Nazockdast
Abstract: Many biological processes involve transport and organization of inclusions in thin fluid interfaces. A key aspect of these assemblies is the active dissipative stresses applied from the inclusions to the fluid interface, resulting in long-range active interfacial flows. We study the effect of these active flows on the self-organization of rod-like inclusions in the interface. Specifically, we consider a dilute suspension of Brownian rods of length $L$, embedded in a thin fluid interface of 2D viscosity $\eta_m$ and surrounded on both sides with 3D fluid domains of viscosity $\eta_f$. The momentum transfer from the interfacial flows to the surrounding fluids occurs over length $\ell_0=\eta_m/\eta_f$, known as Saffman-Delbrück length. We use zeroth, first and second moments of Smoluchowski equation to obtain the conservation equations for concentration, polar order and nematic order fields, and use linear stability analysis and continuum simulations to study the dynamic variations of these fields as a function of $L/\ell_0$, the ratio of active to thermal stresses, and the dimensionless self-propulsion velocity of the embedded particles. We find that at sufficiently large activities, the suspensions of active extensile stress (pusher) with no directed motion undergo a finite wavelength nematic ordering, with the length of the ordered domains decreasing with increasing $L/\ell_0$. The ordering transition is hindered with further increases in $L/\ell_0$. In contrast, the suspensions with active contractile stress (puller) remain uniform with variations of activity. We notice that the self-propulsion velocity results in significant concentration fluctuations and changes in the size of the order domains that depend on $L/\ell_0$. Our research highlights the role of hydrodynamic interactions in the self-organization of active inclusions on biological interfaces.

Title: Superradiance Enhanced Light-Matter Interaction in Spatially Ordered Shape and Volume Controlled Single Quantum Dots: Enabling On-Chip Photonic Networks
Authors: Lucas Jordao, Qi Huang, Swarnabha Chattaraj, Siyuan Lu, Jiefei Zhang, Anupam Madhukar
Abstract: On-chip photonic networks require adequately spatially ordered matter-photon interconversion qubit sources with emission figures-of-merit exceeding the requirements that would enable the desired functional response of the network. The mesa-top single quantum dots (MTSQDs) have recently been demonstrated to meet these requirements. The substrate-encoded size-reducing epitaxy (SESRE) approach underpinning the realization of these quantum emitters allows control on the shape, size, and strain (lattice-matched or mismatched) of these epitaxial single quantum dots. We have exploited this unique feature of the MTSQDs to reproducibly create arrays of quantum dots that exhibit single photon superradiance, characteristic of a delicate balance between the confinement potential volume, depth, and the resulting binding energy of the center of mass motion of the exciton and the exciton binding energy. In the exciton's weak confinement regime, direct enhancement of the quantum dot oscillator strength to ~30 is demonstrated for emitters in large arrays. Our findings provide compelling incentive for investigations of the potential of SESRE based tailored MTSQDs of lattice matched and mismatched material combinations for fabricating and studying interconnected networks enabled by these unique matter qubit-light qubit interconversion units.

Title: Observation of returning Thouless pumping
Authors: Zheyu Cheng, Sijie Yue, Yang Long, Wentao Xie, Zixuan Yu, Hau Tian Teo, Y. X. Zhao, Haoran Xue, Baile Zhang
Abstract: Introduced by David Thouless in 1983, Thouless pumping exemplifies topological properties in topological systems, where the transported charge is quantized by the Chern number. Recently, returning Thouless pumping was theoretically proposed, in which quantized charge is pumped during the first half of the cycle but returns to zero in the second half. This mechanism leads to crystalline symmetry-protected delicate topological insulators. Unlike conventional topological bands, a delicate topological band is Wannierizable but not atomically obstructed, which features multicellular Wannier functions extending beyond a single unit cell. Here, by replacing the second dimension with a synthetic dimension, we realize a two-dimensional delicate topological insulator via a set of one-dimensional acoustic crystals with fine-tuned geometric parameters. Through acoustic bands and wavefunction measurements, we directly observe returning Thouless pumping and symmetric multicellular Wannier functions, followed by establishing the bulk-boundary correspondence between sub-Brillouin zone Chern numbers and gapless boundary modes. As enriched by crystalline symmetries, our experimental demonstration of returning Thouless pumping expands the current understanding of topological phases of matter.

Title: Electroforming Kinetics in HfOx/Ti RRAM: Mechanisms Behind Compositional and Thermal Engineering
Authors: Manasa Kaniselvan, Kevin Portner, Donato Francesco Falcone, Valeria Bragaglia, Jente Clarysse, Laura Bégon-Lours, Marko Mladenović, Bert J. Offrein, Mathieu Luisier
Abstract: A critical issue affecting filamentary resistive random access memory (RRAM) cells is the requirement of high voltages during electroforming. Reducing the magnitude of these voltages is of significant interest, as it ensures compatibility with Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) technologies. Previous studies have identified that changing the initial stoichiometry of the switching layer and/or implementing thermal engineering approaches has an influence over the electroforming voltage magnitude, but the exact mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we develop an understanding of how these mechanisms work within a standard a-HfO$_x$/Ti RRAM stack through combining atomistic driven-Kinetic Monte Carlo (d-KMC) simulations with experimental data. By performing device-scale simulations at atomistic resolution, we can precisely model the movements of point defects under applied biases in structurally inhomogeneous materials, which allows us to not only capture finite-size effects but also to understand how conductive filaments grow under different electroforming conditions. Doing atomistic simulations at the device-level also enables us to link simulations of the mechanisms behind conductive filament formation with trends in experimental data with the same material stack. We identify a transition from primarily vertical to lateral ion movement dominating the filamentary growth process in sub-stoichiometric oxides, and differentiate the influence of global and local heating on the morphology of the formed filaments. These different filamentary structures have implications for the dynamic range exhibited by formed devices in subsequent SET/RESET operations. Overall, our results unify the complex ion dynamics in technologically relevant HfO$_x$/Ti-based stacks, and provide guidelines that can be leveraged when fabricating devices.

Title: Magnetization Dependent In-plane Anomalous Hall Effect in a Low-dimensional System
Authors: I-Hsuan Kao, Ravi Kumar Bandapelli, Zhenhong Cui, Shuchen Zhang, Jian Tang, Tiema Qian, Souvik Sasmal, Aalok Tiwari, Mei-Tung Chen, Rahul Rao, Jiahan Li, James H. Edgar, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Ni Ni, Su-Yang Xu, Qiong Ma, Shubhayu Chatterjee, Jyoti Katoch, Simranjeet Singh
Abstract: Anomalous Hall Effect (AHE) response in magnetic systems is typically proportional to an out-of-plane magnetization component because of the restriction imposed by system symmetries, which demands that the magnetization, applied electric field, and induced Hall current are mutually orthogonal to each other. Here, we report experimental realization of an unconventional form of AHE in a low-dimensional heterostructure, wherein the Hall response is not only proportional to the out-of-plane magnetization component but also to the in-plane magnetization component. By interfacing a low-symmetry topological semimetal (TaIrTe4) with the ferromagnetic insulator (Cr2Ge2Te6), we create a low-dimensional magnetic system, where only one mirror symmetry is preserved. We show that as long as the magnetization has a finite component in the mirror plane, this last mirror symmetry is broken, allowing the emergence of an AHE signal proportional to in-plane magnetization. Our experiments, conducted on multiple devices, reveal a gate-voltage-dependent AHE response, suggesting that the underlying mechanisms responsible for the Hall effect in our system can be tuned via electrostatic gating. A minimal microscopic model constrained by the symmetry of the heterostructure shows that both interfacial spin-orbit coupling and time-reversal symmetry breaking via the exchange interaction from magnetization are responsible for the emergence of the in-plane AHE. Our work highlights the importance of system symmetries and exchange interaction in low-dimensional heterostructures for designing novel and tunable Hall effects in layered quantum systems.

Title: Geometric Quantum Thermodynamic Engine under an Isothermal Operation: An Application of a Thouless Pumping
Authors: Ryosuke Yoshii, Hisao Hayakawa
Abstract: We present a geometric formalism for the non-equilibrium thermodynamics of a small system coupled to external isothermal reservoirs as an application of Thouless pumping, where the electrochemical potentials of the reservoirs and parameters in the system's Hamiltonian are adiabatically controlled. By analyzing the quantum master equation for the Anderson model of a quantum dot under the wide-band approximation, we obtain the work and effective efficiency of the thermodynamic engine as functions of the phase difference between the externally controlled electrochemical potentials after the system reaches a geometric cyclic state. Since the entropy production is negligible in adiabatic operations, the process we consider is reversible, analogous to the Carnot cycle.

Title: Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis correlations via non-linear Hydrodynamics
Authors: Jiaozi Wang, Ruchira Mishra, Tian-Hua Yang, Luca V. Delacrétaz, Silvia Pappalardi
Abstract: The thermalizing dynamics of many-body systems is often described through the lens of the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH). ETH postulates that the statistical properties of observables, when expressed in the energy eigenbasis, are described by smooth functions, that also describe correlations among the matrix elements. However, the form of these functions is usually left undetermined. In this work, we investigate the structure of such smooth functions by focusing on their Fourier transform, recently identified as free cumulants. Using non-linear hydrodynamics, we provide a prediction for the late-time behavior of time-ordered free cumulants in the thermodynamic limit. The prediction is further corroborated by large-scale numerical simulations of a non-integrable spin-$1$ Ising model, which exhibits diffusive transport behavior. Good agreement is observed in both infinite and finite-temperature regimes and for a collection of local observables. Our results indicate that the smooth multi-point correlation functions within the ETH framework admit a universal hydrodynamic description at low frequencies.

Title: Ultraslow Growth of Domains in a Random-Field System With Correlated Disorder
Authors: Subhanker Howlader, Prasenjit Das, Manoj Kumar
Abstract: We study domain growth kinetics in a random-field system in the presence of a spatially correlated disorder $h_{i}(\vec r)$ after an instantaneous quench at a finite temperature $T$ from a random initial state corresponding to $T=\infty$. The correlated disorder field $h_{i}(\vec r)$ arises due to the presence of magnetic impurities, decaying spatially in a power-law fashion. We use Glauber spin-flip dynamics to simulate the kinetics at the microscopic level. The system evolves via the formation of ordered magnetic domains. We characterize the morphology of domains using the equal-time correlation function $C(r,t)$ and structure factor $S(k,t)$. In the large-$k$ limit, $S(k, t)$ obeys Porod's law: $S(k, t)\sim k^{-(d+1)}$. The average domain size $L(t)$ asymptotically follows \textit{double logarithmic growth behavior}.

Title: Determining Linker Ratios of Mixed Metal-Organic Frameworks via Magnetic Susceptibility Measurements
Authors: Na Du, Miao Miao Zhao, Xintian Wang, Yan Zhao, Yang Yang, Yu Ying Zhu, Ruo Tong Wang, Peng Ren, Fei Yen
Abstract: Partial replacement of the organic linkers of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) often optimizes their functionalities, however, accurate characterization of their molar ratios in many cases is challenging. This work presents a method of determining such linker ratios via measurements of the magnetic susceptibility of small quantities of powdered samples. The main presumption is taking the diamagnetic and paramagnetic contributions to the molar magnetic susceptibility of the two parent MOFs to be additive. To verify this, four examples are provided with commonly used MOFs to represent the cases when both parent MOFs are either paramagnetic or diamagnetic but with different linkers with the following systems: [MIL-101(Cr)-SO$_3$H]$_{(1-\delta)}$[MIL-101(Cr)-NO$_2$]$_{\delta}$, [EuMOF]$_{(1-\delta)}$[EuPDCA]$_{\delta}$, [UiO-66-COOH]$_{(1-\delta)}$[UiO-66]$_{\delta}$ and [MIL-101(Cr) F Free]$_{(1-\delta)}$[MIL-53(Al)]$_{\delta}$, where 1-$\delta$ : $\delta$ are the ratios to be determined. Depending on whether the systems were strictly paramagnetic, strictly diamagnetic or mixed, the experimental error of $\delta$ ranged between 0.00002 and 0.012, respectively. We expect the presented method to be widely employed since samples only need to be in powdered form and because there is a lack of characterization tools in the area of MOF linker ratios. The presented method is also applicable to resolving the ratios of mixed ordinary paramagnetic systems as well as other types of non-magnetic composite materials such as tapes, zeolites and thin films.

Title: Neuromodulation via Krotov-Hopfield Improves Accuracy and Robustness of RBMs
Authors: Başer Tambaş, A. Levent Subaşı, Alkan Kabakçıoğlu
Abstract: In biological systems, neuromodulation tunes synaptic plasticity based on the internal state of the organism, complementing stimulus-driven Hebbian learning. The algorithm recently proposed by Krotov and Hopfield \cite{krotov_2019} can be utilized to mirror this process in artificial neural networks, where its built-in intra-layer competition and selective inhibition of synaptic updates offer a cost-effective remedy for the lack of lateral connections through a simplified attention mechanism. We demonstrate that KH-modulated RBMs outperform standard (shallow) RBMs in both reconstruction and classification tasks, offering a superior trade-off between generalization performance and model size, with the additional benefit of robustness to weight initialization as well as to overfitting during training.

Title: Spontaneous Enhancement of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya Interaction via Field-Cooling-Induced Interface Engineering in 2D van der Waals Ferromagnetic ternary Tellurides
Authors: Shian Xia, Yan Luo, Iftikhar Ahmed Malik, Xinyi Zhou, Keying Han, Yue Sun, Haoyun Lin, Hanqing Shi, Yingchun Cheng, Vanessa Li Zhang, Yi Du, Sheng Liu, Chao Zhu, Ting Yu
Abstract: The emergence of two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnets has opened new avenues for exploring topological spin textures and their applications in next-generation spintronics. Among these materials, Fe3GaTe2 (FGaT) emerges as a model system due to its room-temperature skyrmion phases, which are stabilized by strong Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI). However, the atomistic origins of DMI in centrosymmetric vdW lattices remain elusive. Here, we report a spontaneous DMI enhancement mechanism driven by FC in FGaT and its analog Fe3GeTe2 (FGeT). Combining Raman spectroscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), we have observed the irreversible precipitation of FeTe2 in annealed FGaT. The resulting FeTe2/FGaT heterostructure is considered to break the symmetry and significantly enhance the DMI. Furthermore, similar phenomenon has been observed in the family ferromagnetic material FGeT as well. Additionally, the precipitation of FeTe2 varies significantly with different thicknesses of FGaT, aligning closely with the reported behavior of skyrmions. This discovery provides new insights into the mechanisms behind the origin of the DMI in ternary tellurides, paving the way for advanced spintronic applications.

Title: Strong Crystalline Thermal Insulating Induced by Extended Antibonding States
Authors: Ruihuan Cheng, Chen Wang, Niuchang Ouyang, Xingchen Shen, Yue Chen
Abstract: Crystalline solids with extreme insulation often exhibit a plateau or even an upward-sloping tail in thermal conductivity above room temperature. Herein, we synthesized a crystalline material AgTl$_2$I$_3$ with an exceptionally low thermal conductivity of 0.21 $\rm W m^{-1} K^{-1}$ at 300 K, which continues to decrease to 0.17 $\rm W m^{-1} K^{-1}$ at 523 K. We adopted an integrated experimental and theoretical approach to reveal the lattice dynamics and thermal transport properties of AgTl$_2$I$_3$. Our results suggest that the Ag-I polyhedron enables extended antibonding states to weaken the chemical bonding, fostering strong lattice anharmonicity driven by the rattling vibrations of Ag atoms and causing lattice softening. Experimental measurements further corroborate the large atomic thermal motions and low sound velocity. These features impede particle-like phonon propagation, and significantly diminish the contribution of wave-like phonon tunneling. This work highlights a strategy for designing thermal insulating materials by leveraging crystal structure and chemical bonding, providing a pathway for advancing the development of thermal insulators.

Title: Surface hopping simulations show valley depolarization driven by exciton-phonon resonance
Authors: Alex Krotz, Roel Tempelaar
Abstract: Monolayer MoS$_2$ has long served as a prototypical material exhibiting valleytronic behavior, yet it remains unclear exactly how phonons induce a valley depolarization of its excitonic states. Here, we apply a mixed quantum--classical simulation framework to study the phonon-induced mechanisms affecting valley polarization at short times. Our framework combines reciprocal-space surface hopping with microscopic models of the quasiparticle band structure as well as the electron-hole and carrier-phonon interactions, parametrized against ab initio calculations, while retaining explicit information on transient phonon occupancies. By means of such occupancies, our simulations show a resonance between the lowest exciton band and the dominant optical phonon branch to largely drive valley depolarization, by activating a Maialle-Silva-Sham mechanism. Resulting valley polarization times are consistent with experimental measurements across temperatures.

Title: Driving electronic features of twisted bilayer zigzag-graphene nanoribbons
Authors: Kevin J. U. Vidarte, A. B. Felix, A. Latgé
Abstract: Novel physical properties have been reported recently by stacking graphene-like systems in different configurations. Here, we explore the nature of emergent localized states at the edges of twisted bilayer graphene nanoribbons. Based on an extended tight-binding Hamiltonian, which includes hopping energy within a wide atomic neighborhood, we investigate the nature of the electronic states responsible for the transport along the four graphene nanoribbon terminals. The emphasis is on discussing the role of the stacking region symmetries, the twisted angle between the crossed zigzag nanoribbons, and also the width of the ribbons in the electronic and transport responses of the four terminals. Our findings show a direct connection between the number of non-equivalent sites on the edge of the stacking region and the localized states, in accordance with reported scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements. Within the parameters explored, the twist angle was revealed to be the most powerful tool to control transport responses in the investigated 4-terminal devices, including special electronic beam splitter phenomena.

Title: Excitons in fractionally-filled moiré superlattices
Authors: Junghwan Kim, Hanan Dery, Dinh Van Tuan
Abstract: Long-range Coulomb forces give rise to correlated insulating states when charge particles populate a moiré superlattice at certain fractional filling factors. Such behavior is characterized by a broken translation symmetry wherein particles spontaneously form a Wigner crystal. Focusing on the experimental findings of Xu et al. [Nature \textbf{587}, 214 (2020)], we present a theory that captures the correlated insulating state of a fractionally-filled moiré superlattice through the energy shift and change in oscillator strength of the exciton absorption resonance. The theory shows that the experimental findings can only be supported if the electrons reside in a charge-ordered state (i.e., electrons are not randomly distributed among the sites of the moiré superlattice). Furthermore, we explain why the energy shifts of exciton resonances are qualitatively different in cases that the superlattice is nearly empty compared with a superlattice whose sites are doubly occupied.

Title: Excited-State Trions in a Quantum Well
Authors: Sourabh Jain, Mikhail Glazov, Ashish Arora
Abstract: We report on the observation of an excited 2s state of a trion in a 4.2 nm wide doped GaAs/Al(0.3)Ga(0.7)As quantum well (QW) using magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) spectroscopy under out-of-plane magnetic fields up to 6 T. This resonance appears slightly below the 2s exciton in energy. Strikingly, the 2s trion is found to be bound only for magnetic fields larger than 1 T. The signature of the 2s trion is absent in the magneto-reflectance spectra, while it is detectable in the MOKE spectra signifying the importance of the powerful technique. Similar to the 1s states, the 2s trion shows an opposite degree of magnetic-field-induced polarization compared to its exciton counterpart, in agreement with our theoretical calculations. This transfer of oscillator strength between the complexes establishes an optical fingerprint of the 2s excited trion.

Title: Probing quantum phase transition in a staggered Bosonic Kitaev chain via layer-resolved localization-delocalization transition
Authors: R. Wang, X. Z. Zhang
Abstract: The bosonic statistics, which allow for macroscopic multi-occupancy of single-particle states, pose significant challenges for analyzing quantum phase transitions in interacting bosonic systems, both analytically and numerically. In this work, we systematically investigate the non-Hermitian Bloch core matrix of a Hermitian staggered bosonic Kitaev chain, formulated within the Nambu framework. We derive explicit analytic conditions for the emergence of exceptional points (EPs) in the $4\times 4$ Bloch core matrix, with each EP marking the onset of complex-conjugate eigenvalue pairs. By mapping the full many-body Hamiltonian onto an effective tight-binding network in Fock-space and introducing layer-resolved inverse participation ratio, we demonstrate that these EPs coincide precisely with sharp localization--delocalization transitions of collective eigenstates. Comprehensive numerical analyses across hopping amplitudes, pairing strengths, and on-site potentials confirm that the EP of effective Hamiltonian universally capture the global many-body phase boundaries. Our results establish an analytically tractable, EP-based criterion for detecting critical behavior in interacting bosonic lattices, with direct relevance to photonic and cold-atom experimental platforms.

Title: Ab-initio density-matrix approach to exciton coherence: phonon scattering, Coulomb interactions and radiative recombination
Authors: Tomer Amit, Guy Vosco, Mauro Del Ben, Sivan Refaely-Abramson
Abstract: Relaxation processes following light excitation in semiconductors are key in materials-based quantum technology applications. These processes are broadly studied in atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), quasi-two-dimensional excitonic semiconductors in which atomistic design allows for tunable excited-state properties, such as relaxation lifetimes and photo-induced coherence. In this work, we present a density-matrix-based approach to compute exciton relaxation within a many-body ab initio perspective. We expand our previously developed Lindblad density-matrix formalism to capture multi-channel electron-hole pair relaxation processes, including phonon and Coulomb scattering as well as radiative recombination, and study their effect on the time-resolved excited-state propagation. Using monolayer MoSe$_2$ as a prototypical example, we examine many-body effects on the time-dependent dynamics of photoactive excitations, exploring how the electron-hole pair interactions are reflected in variations of the excitation energy, spectral signature, and state coherence. Our method supplies a detailed understanding of exciton relaxation mechanisms in realistic materials, offering a previously unexplored pathway to study excited-state dynamics in semiconductors from first principles.

Title: Temperature chaos may emerge many thermodynamic states in spin glasses
Authors: Wenlong Wang
Abstract: We present a large-scale simulation of the three-dimensional and mean-field spin glasses down to a very low but finite temperature. We extrapolate pertinent observables, e.g., the disorder-averaged central weight to zero temperature, finding that many thermodynamic states at a finite temperature and two ground states at zero temperature are fully compatible. While the disorder-averaged central weight monotonically decreases with decreasing temperature, this is far from true for individual samples. This motivates us to link this behaviour with the well-known temperature chaos. At an observing temperature, a sample may or may not have pure state coexistence depending on whether it is undergoing temperature chaos, which is a random process. Therefore, temperature chaos is likely responsible for the emergence of many pure states, providing a natural and intuitive explanation for the coexistence of expensive domain-wall excitations and many pure states at the disorder-averaged level.

Title: Estimating critical disorder strength of an AAH system via thermal response
Authors: Sanchita Nandi, Santanu K. Maiti
Abstract: The Aubry-André-Harper (AAH) model provides a paradigmatic platform to study localization phenomena, where a transition from a conducting to an insulating phase occurs at a critical disorder strength equal to twice the nearest-neighbor hopping amplitude, $2t$. While this transition has been explored extensively through various probes, here we propose a fundamentally new approach based on thermal response. Specifically, we demonstrate that the electronic specific heat exhibits a distinctive signature across the transition, directly reflecting the anomalous evolution of the density of states with disorder strength. Our findings, supported by numerical analysis, establish specific heat measurement as a powerful and sensitive probe for detecting the critical point. This thermal characterization opens a new avenue for exploring disorder-induced phase transitions and paves the way for experimental realization in engineered quantum systems.

Title: Fermi liquid theory of $d$-wave altermagnets: demon modes and Fano-demon states
Authors: Habib Rostami, Johannes Hofmann
Abstract: We develop a Fermi liquid theory of $d$-wave altermagnets and apply it to describe their collective excitation spectrum. We predict that in addition to a conventional undamped plasmon mode, where both spin components oscillate in phase, there is an acoustic plasmon (or {\em demon}) mode with out-of-phase spin dynamics. By analyzing the dynamical structure factor, we reveal a strong dependence of the demon's frequency and spectral weight both on the Landau parameters and on the direction of propagation. Notably, as a function of the propagation angle, we show that the acoustic mode evolves from a {\em hidden state}, which has zero spectral weight in the density excitation spectrum, to a weakly damped propagating demon mode and then to a {\em Fano-demon mixed state}, which is marked by a strong hybridization with particle-hole excitations and a corresponding asymmetric line shape in the structure factor. Our study paves the way for applications of altermagnetic materials in opto-spintronics by harnessing itinerant electron spin oscillations beyond traditional magnon spin waves.

Title: Hydrogen-rich hydrate at high pressures up to 104 GPa

Abstract: Gas hydrates are considered fundamental building blocks of giant icy planets like Neptune and similar exoplanets. The existence of these materials in the interiors of giant icy planets, which are subject to high pressures and temperatures, depends on their stability relative to their constituent components. In this study, we reexamine the structural stability and hydrogen content of hydrogen hydrates, (H2O)(H2)n, up to 104 GPa, focusing on hydrogen-rich materials. Using synchrotron single-crystal X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and first-principles theoretical calculations, we find that the C2-filled ice phase undergoes a transformation to C3-filled ice phase over a broad pressure range of 47 - 104 GPa at room temperature. The C3 phase contains twice as much molecular H2 as the C2 phase. Heating the C2-filled ice above approximately 1500 K induces the transition to the C3 phase at pressures as low as 47 GPa. Upon decompression, this phase remains metastable down to 40 GPa. These findings establish new stability limits for hydrates, with implications for hydrogen storage and the interiors of planetary bodies.

Title: Regimes of optical transparency and instabilities of collinear dielectric ferromagnetic materials in the presence of the dynamic magnetoelectric effect
Authors: Pavel A. Andreev
Abstract: The contribution of the polarization associated with the noncollinear parts of spins in the dielectric permeability tensor of multiferroic materials is considered. As the equilibrium state, we consider the systems of parallel spins, so we have zero equilibrium polarization. Dynamical polarization appears due to the spin evolution via the magnetoelectric coupling. The regime of frequencies, where the refractive index goes to 1 is found for the high (in comparison with the characteristic frequency of the anisotropic energy or the cyclotron frequency) left/right circularly polarized electromagnetic wave propagating parallel to the equilibrium spin direction. Moreover, the signs of the imaginary part of the dielectric permeability, the refractive index, and the frequency show the instability of the parallel spin configuration at the propagation of the linearly polarized electromagnetic wave due to the effective magnetoelectric interaction.

Title: Buckling of residually stressed cylindrical tubes under compression
Authors: Tao Zhang, Luis Dorfmann, Yang Liu
Abstract: We evaluate the loss of stability of axially compressed slender and thick-walled tubes subject to a residual stress distribution. The nonlinear theory of elasticity, when used to analyze the underlying deformation, shows that the residual stress induces preferred directions in the reference configuration. The incremental theory, given in Stroh form, is used to derive an exact bifurcation condition. The critical stretch and the associated critical buckling mode are identified for axisymmetric and asymmetric increments in the deformation. Mode transitions are illustrated as the tube slenderness varies. For slender tubes, Euler buckling is energetically favorable, and the effect of residual stress is negligible. However, for short and thick-walled tubes where barreling mode is dominant, the residual stress significantly affects the buckling behavior and may eliminate barreling instability. We show that, depending on its magnitude and direction, residual stress can either accelerate or delay instability. Phase diagrams for various modes are obtained and provide insight into pattern selection across different tube geometries.

Title: Stabilization of the skyrmion in a hybrid magnetic-superconducting nanostucture
Authors: Julia Kharlan, Mateusz Zelent, Konstantin Guslienko, Vladimir O. Golub, Jaroslaw W. Klos
Abstract: Stabilization of skyrmions in a magnetic material without the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya exchange interaction requires using of an inhomogeneous magnetic field, such as a demagnetization field or an Oersted field. To control and tune the local magnetic field in magnetic material we propose to exploit superconducting nanorings. The field stabilizes the skyrmion through the presence of persistent current induced by the pulses of external field. We analyze the conditions for the stabilization of Neel skyrmion in ferromagnetic layers with out-of-plane anisotropy, as a function of the nanoring size and induced superconducting current. We show that the superconducting current should exceed a critical value for the skyrmion to become stable. The paper presents consistent results from both analytical and micromagnetic calculations for Co and Ga:YIG thin magnetic films.

Title: Optimizing spin polarization in quantum dot vertical-gain structures through pump wavelength selection
Authors: Najm Alhosiny, Sami S. Alharthi, J. Doogan, E. Clarke, T. Ackemann
Abstract: Spintronic applications require an efficient injection of spin-polarized carriers. We study the maximally achievable spin polarization in InAs quantum dots in a vertical-cavity gain structure to be used in telecoms-wavelength vertical-external-cavity surface-emitting lasers via measurement of the Stokes parameter of the photoluminescence emission around 1290 nm. Using five pump wavelengths between 850 and 1070 nm, the observed spin polarization depends strongly on the pump wavelength with the highest polarization of nearly 5% found for excitation at 980 nm. This corresponds to an effective spin lifetime of 40 ps and is attributed to the dominant excitation of heavy holes only.

Title: Unified theory of photovoltaic Hall effect by field- and light-induced Berry curvatures
Authors: Yuta Murotani, Tomohiro Fujimoto, Ryusuke Matsunaga
Abstract: Photovoltaic Hall effect is an interesting platform of Berry curvature engineering by external fields. Floquet engineering aims at generation of light-induced Berry curvature associated with topological phase transition in solids, which may manifest itself as a light-induced anomalous Hall effect. However, recent studies have pointed out an important role of the bias electric field, which adds a field-induced circular photogalvanic effect to the photovoltaic Hall effect. Except for numerical studies, the two mechanisms have been described by different theoretical frameworks, hindering a coherent understanding. Here, we develop a unified theory of the photovoltaic Hall effect capable of describing both mechanisms on an equal footing. We reveal that the bias electric field alters the interband transition dipole moment, transition energy, and intraband velocity, all contributing to the field-induced circular photogalvanic effect in nonmagnetic materials. The first process can be expressed as a manifestation of the electric field-induced Berry curvature. Shift vector plays an essential role in determining the transition energy shift. We also clearly distinguish the anomalous Hall effect by light-dressed states within the density matrix calculation using the length gauge. Our theory unifies a number of nonlinear optical processes in a physically transparent way and reveals their geometric aspect.

Title: Growth of ultra-clean single crystals of RuO2
Authors: Shubhankar Paul, Giordano Mattoni, Hisakazu Matsuki, Thomas Johnson, Chanchal Sow, Shingo Yonezawa, Yoshiteru Maeno
Abstract: We report the details of the growth of ultra-clean single crystals for RuO2, a candidate material for altermagnetism. By using a crystal-growth tube with a necking structure and precisely controlling the conditions of the sublimation transport method, it is possible to control the morphology of the crystals. We obtained crystals in mainly three kinds of morphology: thick plate-like crystals typically 5 x 3 x 2mm3 and up to 10 x 5 x 2mm3 with a large (101) facet, rhombohedral columnar crystals elongating along the [001] direction, and fiber and needle crystals of length up to 8 mm and the width of 0.1-0.4 mm. These crystals show residual resistivity of about 30 nOhmcm and a residual resistivity ratio (RRR) up to 1200. The crystals do not exhibit any signs of magnetic ordering down to low temperatures.

Abstract: Magnetic excitations are important quantum phenomena in magnetic systems and have been widely studied in individual magnetic atoms and molecules as well as their assembled structures over the past few decades. Using scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/S) combined with density functional theory (DFT) and the state-of-the-art ab initio wavefunction calculations, we investigated the properties of a novel dual-core Cr2Br6 molecule, which consists of two Cr ions coupled via superexchange through a single near-90° Cr-Br-Cr scissors bond. Under zero magnetic field, we observed a Fano peak with multi-steps through STS. When an external magnetic field is applied, some steps exhibit additional splitting, while others change little. We find that the Cr2Br6, exhibits a spin-degenerate ground state, and the complex peak splitting arises from the coexistence of vibrational and magnetic excitations in the molecule. Our results reveal rich quantum spin behavior in a well-defined two-core magnetic trihalide complex at the atomic scale, offering not only a minimal model for superexchange-coupled multi-spin quantum excitations but also a possible foundational unit for future molecule-based quantum functionalities.

Title: Generation of magnetic chiral solitons, skyrmions, and hedgehogs with electric fields
Authors: Teruya Nakagawara, Minoru Kanega, Shunsuke C. Furuya, Masahiro Sato
Abstract: Electric-field controls of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions (DMIs) have recently been discussed from the microscopic viewpoint. Since the DMI plays a critical role in generating topological spin textures (TSTs) such as the chiral soliton, the magnetic skyrmion, and the magnetic hedgehog, electric-field controls of these TSTs have become an important issue. This paper shows that such electric-field-induced DMI indeed creates and annihilates TSTs by numerically solving the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation for many-body spin systems at finite temperatures. We show that when a strong electric field is applied in a proper way to one- or two-dimensional ferromagnets, the Hamiltonians are changed into the well-known spin models for the chiral soliton or the skyrmion lattice, and the TST states emerge. We utilize a machine-learning method to count the number of generated TSTs. In the three-dimensional (3D) case, we demonstrate the electric-field induction of a magnetic hedgehog structure as follows: Applying a strong enough electric field along a proper direction to a skyrmion-string state (a triple-$\boldsymbol{q}$ state) at low but finite temperatures, we find that the field-induced DMI can drive a quadruple-$\boldsymbol{q}$ state with hedgehog-antihedgehog pairs. This result indicates that we have succeeded in constructing a simple 3D short-range interacting spin model hosting a magnetic hedgehog structure.

Title: Pseudo-Goldstone Modes at Finite Temperature
Authors: Xiyue Lin, Tao Shi
Abstract: Goldstone's theorem and its extension to pseudo-Goldstone (PG) modes have profound implications across diverse areas of physics, from quantum chromodynamics to quantum magnetism. PG modes emerge from accidental degeneracies lifted by quantum and thermal fluctuations, leading to a finite gap--a phenomenon known as "order by disorder." In this paper, we derive a general curvature formula for the PG gap at finite temperature, applicable to both collinear (e.g., ferromagnets and anti-ferromagnets) and noncollinear magnetic orders (e.g., coplanar orders in frustrated magnetic systems). After validating our formula against known models, we apply it to the XXZ model on the triangular lattice, which hosts coplanar magnetic orders in equilibrium and is relevant to materials such as Na2BaCo(PO4)2 and K2Co(SeO3)2, known for their supersolid phases and giant magnetocaloric effects. Our results reveal a distinct scaling behavior: a linear decrease of the PG gap with temperature, driven by entropy effects from magnon scattering across multiple bands. This stands in stark contrast to the high-temperature scaling recently proposed for systems with a single magnon band. This work establishes a general framework for investigating PG modes at finite temperatures and opens an avenue to explore rich quantum phases and dynamics in frustrated systems with noncollinear magnetic orders.

Title: Superconducting Dome and Quantum Criticality in Two-Dimensional NbO2 Triangular Lattice
Authors: Takuto Soma, Kohei Yoshimatsu, Akira Ohtomo
Abstract: The emergence of superconductivity with strong correlation is one of the most attracted issues in condensed-matter physics, as seen in various unconventional superconductors. Here we show a new strongly correlated superconductor Li1-xNbO2 with rich characteristics such as two-dimensional, geometrically frustrated, and triangular NbO2 lattice and correlated flat-band-like electronic states. We revealed the electronic phase diagram by implementing Li-ion electrochemical cells with LiNbO2 epitaxial films. The Li-ion deintercalation increased the hole-doping level in NbO2 layer, along which a band insulator LiNbO2 underwent to a Fermi-liquid (FL) metal and superconductor associated with non-Fermi liquid (NFL) characters. The evolution of the NFL state coincided with the suppression of the Kondo-singlet formation near the superconducting dome, which linked superconductivity with quantum criticality. The obtained phase diagram involves general aspects of strongly correlated superconductors and bridges the gap between various systems.

Title: Topological surface states induced by magnetic proximity effect in narrow-gap semiconductor alpha-Sn
Authors: Soichiro Fukuoka, Le Duc Anh, Masayuki Ishida, Tomoki Hotta, Takahiro Chiba, Yohei Kota, Masaaki Tanaka
Abstract: The combination of magnetism and topological properties in one material platform is attracting significant attention due to the potential of realizing low power consumption and error-robust electronic devices. Common practice is to start from a topological material with band inversion and incorporates ferromagnetism via chemical doping or magnetic proximity effect (MPE). In this work, we show that a topological material is not necessary and that both ferromagnetism and band inversion can be established simultaneously in a trivial insulating material by MPE from a neighbouring ferromagnetic layer. This novel route is demonstrated using quantum transport measurements and first principles calculations in a heterostructure consisting of 5 nm thick FeOx/1 monolayer of FeAs/ 3 nm thick alpha Sn. The Shubnikov de Haas oscillations show that there is linear band dispersion with high mobility in the heterostructure even though a 3 nm thick alpha Sn single layer is a trivial semiconductor. Furthermore, first principles calculations reveal that band inversion indeed occurs in this heterostructure, suggesting that the observed linear band is a topological surface state within this inverted gap. This work significantly expands the foundation for realizing magnetic topological materials in a myriad of trivial narrow gap semiconductors.

Title: Interplay between timescales governs the residual activity of a harmonically bound active Brownian particle
Authors: Sanatan Halder, Manas Khan
Abstract: Active microparticles in confining potentials manifest complex and intriguing dynamical phenomena, as their activity competes with confinement. The steady-state position distributions of harmonically bound active Brownian particles (HBABPs) exhibit a crossover from Boltzmann-like to bimodal, commonly recognized as passive to active transition, upon variation of the activity and the confinement strength. By studying optically trapped phoretically active Janus colloids, along with simulations and analytical calculations of HBABPs, we provide a comprehensive dynamical description emphasizing the resultant velocity to examine this understanding. Our results establish that the crossover is instead from active to passive-like, and is governed solely by the interplay between the persistence time $\tau_{\rm R}$, and the equilibration time in harmonic potential $\tau_k$. When $\tau_{\rm R} < \tau_k$, despite a Boltzmann-like position distribution, the HBABP retains a substantial resultant or residual active velocity, denoting an activity-dominated regime. In contrast, at $\tau_{\rm R} > \tau_k$, the restoring force fully counterbalances propulsion at a radial distance, where the HBABP exhibits harmonically bound Brownian particle (HBBP)-like dynamics, and the position distribution becomes bimodal. We further provide a quantitative measure of the residual activity, which decreases monotonically with $\tau_{\rm R} / \tau_k$, eventually converging to a nominal value corresponding to HBBP as $\tau_{\rm R} / \tau_k$ exceeds 1, corroborating our conclusions.

Title: Crossed pseudopotential$-$functional calculations made simple: An extended Kohn-Sham framework
Authors: Kuiyu Ye, Jiale Shen, Haitao Liu, Yuanchang Li
Abstract: Modern density-functional-theory (DFT) calculations rely heavily on pseudopotentials, yet their impact on accuracy is barely addressed. In this work, we derive from the Kohn-Sham equation that the use of pseudopotentials invariably introduces a ``dropping" error, which leads to a deviation from the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem. Crossed pseudopotential-functional calculations provide a pragmatic way to balance accuracy and efficiency, enabling the right results for the right reasons. This paradigm goes beyond the (generalized) Kohn-Sham framework, which we name the extended Kohn-Sham framework. We support our assertion with a bandgap study on 54 monovalent-Cu semiconductors. The crossed calculations, compared to consistent ones, not only remove all 11 erroneous metal predictions, but also drastically reduce the mean relative error from 80\% to 20\%. The accuracy even exceeds that of the hybrid functionals and GW due to the role of pseudopotentials in modelling the external potentials of Cu-valence electrons that cannot be compensated by exchange-correlation.

Title: Current-induced Nonequilibrium Phase Transition Accompanied by Giant Gap Reduction in Vanadium Dioxide
Authors: Akitoshi Nakano, Masato Imaizumi, Ichiro Terasaki
Abstract: We investigated nonlinear conduction in bulk single crystals of VO2 with precise temperature control. Two distinct nonequilibrium phenomena were identified: a gradual reduction of the charge gap and a current-induced insulator-metal transition. The electric field required to drive the nonlinear conduction is two to three orders of magnitude smaller than that reported for VO2 thin films or nanobeams, strongly indicating an intrinsic electronic origin rather than a temperature increase due to self heating. Notably, our results suggest that the application of a steady current to the frozen insulating state can induce a nonequilibrium steady-state metallic phase -- effectively melting the electronic ice. This highlights a novel route to controlling electronic states via nonthermal, current-driven mechanisms.

Title: Nitrogen and oxygen transport and reactions during plasma nitridation of zirconium thin films
Authors: Luc Pichon (UP, PPrime [Poitiers]), A. Straboni, T. Girardeau, M. Drouet, P. Widmayer
Abstract: Zirconium nitride (ZrN) is a refractory material with good mechanical and thermal properties. It is therefore a good candidate for hard surface treatment at high temperature. In this work, we report the growth and characterization of ZrN by plasma assisted thermal nitridation of zirconium films in a NH3 atmosphere. The process was monitored by in situ monochromatic ellipsometry and the nitrides grown were profiled and analyzed by Auger electron spectroscopy. By using temperatures in the 700--800___{\textdegree}C range, the material obtained is quite close to ZrN, but, depending on experimental conditions, residual oxygen (impurities) can be easily incorporated by reaction with zirconium. The analysis of the ellipsometric data has shown that the nitridation did not occur by simple growth of nitride on zirconium. Auger profiles confirmed the presence of an oxidized zirconium layer localized between the nitrided surface and the remaining metal. This oxidation was observed to occur preferentially during temperature ramping, that is, in the low temperature regime. At high temperature, nitridation is dominant and the incorporated oxygen is exchanged with nitrogen. Oxygen is then partly rejected by diffusion out of the film through the ZrN surface layer and partly by diffusion in the deep zirconium sublayer. By using these observations, a new model of growth with a layered ZrN/ZrOx/Zr film was used to describe in situ ellipsometric data. By comparing the pure thermal and the plasma treatments, the advantages of the plasma assisted treatment become clearly: complete nitridation of the zirconium layer was achieved and the oxygen amounts in the film were substantially reduced.

Title: Directional entanglement of spin-orbit locked nitrogen-vacancy centers by magnons
Authors: Zhiping Xue, Ji Zou, Chengyuan Cai, Gerrit E. W. Bauer, Tao Yu
Abstract: We address that the stray magnetic field emitted by the excited quantum states of the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers is spin-momentum locked, such that the spin transfer to nearby ferromagnetic nanostructures is unidirectional. This may allow the controlled excitation of propagating magnons by NV centers in diamond. A pair of NV spin qubits exchange virtual magnons in a magnetic nanowire in a chiral manner that leads to directional quantum entanglement. A magnon-based ``quantum-entanglement isolator" should be a useful device in future quantum information technology.

Title: Nonrelativistic Piezomagnetic Effect in an Organic Altermagnet
Authors: Makoto Naka, Yukitoshi Motome, Tsuyoshi Miyazaki, Hitoshi Seo
Abstract: We theoretically study the piezomagnetic effect on the altermagnetic state in $\kappa$-type molecular conductors, focusing on its nonrelativistic mechanism. By introducing shear stress as a monoclinic distortion, we evaluate variations in the effective tight-binding model using first-principles calculations. Using the derived parameters, we investigate the Hubbard model and its effective Heisenberg model on the two-dimensional (distorted) $\kappa$-type lattice within mean-field approximation. We show that the system exhibits the piezomagnetic effect, i.e., a net magnetization induced at finite temperatures in the undoped insulating state and both in the ground state and at finite temperatures upon doping. In a real-space picture, this uniform magnetization arises from the ferrimagnetic spin structure due to inequivalent spin sites induced by lattice distortion. Meanwhile, in a momentum-space picture, it stems from the {\it s}-wave spin splitting of the electron and magnon bands, independent of spin-orbit coupling. We find that this nonrelativistic piezomagnetism remains finite, but becomes smaller in the limit of strong dimerization where the energy gap between the bonding and antibonding orbitals is infinitely large and the {\it d}-wave altermagnetic spin splitting is absent, highlighting the importance of the multi-orbital nature.

Title: Kinetic theory of point vortices at order $1/N$ and $1/N^{2}$
Authors: Jean-Baptiste Fouvry, Pierre-Henri Chavanis
Abstract: We investigate the long-term relaxation of a distribution of $N$ point vortices in two-dimensional hydrodynamics, in the limit of weak collective amplification. Placing ourselves within the limit of an average axisymmetric distribution, we stress the connections with generic long-range interacting systems, whose relaxation is described within angle-action coordinates. In particular, we emphasise the existence of two regimes of relaxation, depending on whether the system's profile of mean angular velocity (frequency) is a non-monotonic [resp. monotonic] function of radius, which we refer to as profile (1) [resp. profile (2)]. For profile (1), relaxation occurs through two-body non-local resonant couplings, i.e. $1/N$ effects, as described by the inhomogeneous Landau equation. For profile (2), the impossibility of such two-body resonances submits the system to a ``kinetic blocking''. Relaxation is then driven by three-body couplings, i.e. $1/N^{2}$ effects, whose associated kinetic equation has only recently been derived. For both regimes, we compare extensively the kinetic predictions with large ensemble of direct $N$-body simulations. In particular, for profile (1), we explore numerically an effect akin to ``resonance broadening'' close to the extremum of the angular velocity profile. Quantitative description of such subtle nonlinear effects will be the topic of future investigations.

Title: Variational Quantum Monte Carlo investigations of the superconducting pairing in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$
Authors: Yi-Qun Liu, Da Wang, Qiang-Hua Wang
Abstract: We investigate the pairing symmetry in the novel superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure by the non-perturbative variational quantum Monte Carlo. Within the bilayer Hubbard model and extended $t-J$ model with two orbitals in the $E_g$ doublet, we find the local strong correlation triggers $s_\pm$-wave Cooper pairing, with sign change of the gap function among the various Fermi pockets, while the $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave pairing is generically disfavored. This is in agreement with the results from functional renormalization group applied in the weak up to moderate correlation limit. We find the 3d$_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbital plays a leading role in the superconducting pairing. We also demonstrate the finite intra-orbital double occupancy even in the strong correlation limit, shedding light on the itinerant versus local moment picture of the electrons in this material.

Title: Unraveling the Reaction Mechanisms in a Chemically Amplified EUV Photoresist from a Combined Theoretical and Experimental Approach
Authors: Laura Galleni, Dhirendra P. Singh, Thierry Conard, Geoffrey Pourtois, Paul van der Heide, John Petersen, Kevin M. Dorney, Michiel J. van Setten
Abstract: Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography has revolutionized high-volume manufacturing of nanoscale components, enabling the production of smaller, denser, and more energy efficient integrated circuit devices. Yet, the use of EUV light results in ionization driven chemistry within the imaging materials of lithography, the photoresists. The complex interplay of ionization, generation of primary and secondary electrons, and the subsequent chemical mechanisms leading to image formation in photoresists has been notoriously difficult to study. In this work, we deploy photoemission spectroscopy with a 92 eV EUV light source combined with first-principles simulations to unravel the chemical changes occurring during exposure in a model chemically amplified photoresist. The results reveal a surprising chemical reaction pathway, namely the EUV-induced breakdown of the photoacid generator (PAG), which is a critical component in the EUV mechanism. This previously unobserved reaction mechanism manifests as changes in intensity of the valence band peaks of the EUV photoemission spectrum, which are linked to degradation of the PAG via an advanced atomistic simulation framework. Our combined experimental and theoretical approach shows that EUV photoemission can simultaneously resolve chemical dynamics and the production of primary and secondary electrons, giving unique insights into the chemical transformation of photoresist materials. Our results pave the way for utilizing accessible, table-top EUV spectroscopy systems for observing EUV photoresist chemical dynamics, with the potential for time-resolved measurements of photoemission processes in the future.

Title: All-optical electric field sensing with nanodiamond-doped polymer thin films
Authors: Roy Styles, Mengke Han, Toon Goris, James Partridge, Brett C. Johnson, Blanca del Rosal, Amanda N. Abraham, Heike Ebendorff-Heidepriem, Brant C. Gibson, Nikolai Dontschuk, Jean-Philippe Tetienne, Philipp Reineck
Abstract: The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center is a photoluminescent defect in diamond that exists in different charge states, NV$^-$ and NV$^0$, that are sensitive to the NV's nanoscale environment. Here, we show that photoluminescence (PL) from NV centers in fluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs) can be employed for all-optical voltage sensing based on electric field-induced NV charge state modulation. More than 95% of FNDs integrated into a capacitor device show a transient increase in NV$^-$ PL intensity of up to 31% within 0.1 ms after application of an external voltage, accompanied by a simultaneous decrease in NV$^0$ PL. The change in NV$^-$ PL increases with increasing applied voltage from 0 to 100 V, corresponding to an electric field of 0 to 625 kV cm$^ {-1}$ in our devices. The electric field sensitivity of a single FND is 19 V cm$^{-1}$ Hz$^ {-1/2}$. We investigate the NV charge state photodynamics on the millisecond timescale and find that the change in NV PL strongly depends on the rate of photoexcitation. We propose a model that qualitatively explains the observed changes in NV PL based on an electric field-induced redistribution of photoexcited electrons from substitutional nitrogen defects to NV centers, leading to a transient conversion of NV$^0$ to NV$^-$ centers upon application of an external voltage. Our results contribute to the development of FNDs as reliable, all-optical, nanoscale electric field sensors in solid-state systems.

Title: Inverse Bauschinger Effect in Active Ultrastable Glasses
Authors: Rashmi Priya, Smarajit Karmakar
Abstract: Memory effects in amorphous materials have been widely studied because of their possible widespread future applications. We show here that ultrastable glasses can exhibit a transient reversible memory effect when subjected to both a local driving force via Run-and-tumble active particles and global shear. We investigate the system's response across different yielding regimes by selectively switching the shear direction at different strains. We analyze how changes in shear direction influence yielding, post-yield behavior, and structural evolution in active amorphous solids. Our model active system exhibits an enhanced anisotropic response, displaying both conventional and inverse Bauschinger effects, depending on the deformation history. The results indicate that activity-induced shear band networks create structural memory, enabling the system to heal upon shear reversal due to the transient nature of this phenomenon. Additionally, we observe that shear softening under cyclic loading produces an irreversible, stable, and less branched network structure with increasing cycles. These findings provide novel insights into how activity and shear collectively contribute to mechanical response, including memory formation in ultrastable disordered systems.

Title: Charge transfer between van der Waals coupled metallic 2D layers
Authors: Bharti Matta, Philipp Rosenzweig, Craig Polley, Ulrich Starke, Kathrin Küster
Abstract: Van der Waals heterostructures have become a rapidly growing field in condensed matter research, offering a platform to engineer novel quantum systems by stacking different two-dimensional (2D) materials. A diverse range of material combinations, including hexagonal boron nitride, transition metal dichalcogenides and graphene, with electronic properties spanning from insulating to semiconducting, metallic, and semimetallic, have been explored to tune the properties of these heterostacks. However, understanding the interactions and charge transfer between the stacked layers remains challenging, particularly when more than two layers are involved. In this study, we investigate the charge transfer in a potassium-adlayer/graphene/lead-monolayer heterostructure stacked on a SiC substrate. Using synchrotron-based angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we analyze the band structure of each layer, focusing on the charge transfer from K to the underlying 2D layers. Since K forms a $(2 \times 2)$ overlayer with respect to graphene, the amount of charge carriers donated by K can be determined. Our findings reveal that adsorption of K not only leads to a significant $n$-doping of the adjacent graphene layer but also to an electron transfer into the Pb monolayer. Remarkably, $\approx 44\%$ of the electrons donated by the K adlayer are transferred into its second nearest neighbouring layer, i.e. Pb, while $\approx 56\%$ remain in the graphene.

Title: Correlated electronic structure of the alternating single-layer bilayer nickelate La$_{5}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{11}$
Authors: Harrison LaBollita, Antia S. Botana
Abstract: The recent discovery of superconductivity under pressure in Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) nickelates has attracted a great deal of attention. Here, using density-functional theory plus dynamical mean-field theory, we study the correlated electronic structure of the latest superconducting member of the family: the alternating single-layer bilayer nickelate La$_{5}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{11}$. Due to its alternating single-layer and bilayer structural motif, this hybrid RP nickelate exhibits layer-selective physics with the single-layer neighboring a Mott instability, rendering the bilayer the dominant contributor to its low-energy physics, both at ambient and high pressure. The electronic structure of La$_{5}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{11}$ ultimately resembles that of the bilayer compound La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$, pointing to the presence of universal features in the family of superconducting RP nickelates. Thus, La$_{5}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{11}$ provides a new platform to disentangle the key degrees of freedom underlying superconductivity in pressurized RP nickelates, underscoring the central role of the bilayer structural motif.

Title: Role of non-reciprocity in spin-wave channeling
Authors: Jean-Paul Adam, Nathalie Bardou, Aurélie Solignac, Joo-Von Kim, Thibaut Devolder
Abstract: The extent to which non-reciprocal waves can be guided in arbitrary directions is an interesting question. We address one aspect of this problem by studying the propagation of acoustic spin waves in a narrow physical conduit made of a synthetic antiferromagnet. Through a combination of Brillouin Light Scattering microscopy and modeling, we demonstrate that even when attempting to guide waves in the reciprocal direction of the material, the system still exhibits strong signatures of non-reciprocity. This includes the excitation of high wavevector waves in the direction perpendicular to the intended channeling, as well as energy transfer in directions that often neither aligns with the physical conduit nor with the symmetry axes of the magnetic properties. These findings have implications for the modeling of propagating wave spectroscopy in non-reciprocal materials and their potential applications.

Title: Empirical approaches to Frohlich excitonic polarons in polar semiconductors with application to 3D halide perovskites
Authors: Jacky Even, Simon Thebaud, Aseem Kshirsagar, Laurent Pedesseau, Marios Zacharias, Claudine Katan
Abstract: Short abstract: The paper reviews the physics of Frohlich excitonic polarons from the viewpoint of empirical approaches with some original developments. Models for excitonic polarons in ionic semiconductors in the spirit of the Lee Low and Pines (LLP) model for free polarons were initiated by Toyozawa and Hermanson and extended by Pollman and Buttner (PB). The dominant electron-hole interaction with the lattice introduced by Frohlich is represented by a long-range effective interaction with a single longitudinal optical polar mode. The properties of the excitonic polarons are characterized by various physical quantities such as effective dielectric constants, effective masses, virtual phonon populations, carrier self-energies and binding energies, and effective electron-hole interactions mediated by the lattice. In 3D perovskites, the excitonic polarons deviate from the simplified picture of weakly interacting (almost free) polarons, with sizeable effects of electron-hole correlations on all the physical properties.

Title: Integrating Machine Learning with Triboelectric Nanogenerators: Optimizing Electrode Materials and Doping Strategies for Intelligent Energy Harves
Authors: Guanping Xu, Zirui Zhao, Zhonglin Wang, Hai-feng Li
Abstract: The integration of machine learning techniques with triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) offers a transformative pathway for optimizing energy harvesting technologies. In this study, we propose a comprehensive framework that utilizes graph neural networks to predict and enhance the performance of TENG electrode materials and doping strategies. By leveraging an extensive dataset of experimental and computational results, the model effectively classifies electrode materials, predicts optimal doping ratios, and establishes robust structure-property relationships. Key findings include a 65.7\% increase in energy density for aluminum-doped PTFE and an 85.7\% improvement for fluorine-doped PTFE, highlighting the critical influence of doping materials and their concentrations. The model further identifies PTFE as a highly effective negative electrode material, achieving a maximum energy density of 1.12~J/cm$^2$ with 7\% silver (Ag) doping when copper (Cu) is used as the positive electrode. This data-driven approach not only accelerates material discovery but also significantly reduces experimental costs, providing novel insights into the fundamental factors influencing TENG performance. The proposed methodology establishes a robust platform for intelligent material design, advancing the development of sustainable energy technologies and self-powered systems.

Title: Morphology and Strain Engineering of Cu-based Materials by Chemical Dealloying for Electrochemical CO Reduction

Abstract: Nanoporous Cu (NPC), synthesized by chemical dealloying of brass, holds significant potential for catalysis of electrochemical CO2 and CO reduction, owing to the optimal binding energy of Cu with *CO and *H intermediates, and the abundance of surface under-coordinated atoms inherent to the nanoporous structure. However, further optimization of NPC morphology and chemistry for CO reduction can only be made possible by understanding the dealloying process. Hence overcoming challenges concerning the direct measurement of atomic scale chemistry and under-coordinated atoms in NPC nano-ligaments is vital. In this study, NPC with tunable ligament sizes between nanometer and micrometer range were synthesized by varying the temperature of Cu20Zn80 (atomic ratio) chemical dealloying in concentrated phosphoric acid. The evolution of chemistry and structure of nano-ligaments during dealloying were probed for the first time using in situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD) and cryo-atom probe tomography (APT) revealing the phase transformations and complex chemistry in nano-ligaments. A method based on the asymmetricity of synchrotron XRD peaks of NPC samples was also proposed to estimate the quantity of under-coordinated atoms on nano-ligaments, as ligament surface strain. Finally, CO reduction using electrochemistry mass spectrometry (EC-MS) demonstrated the promising performance of NPC compared to polycrystalline Cu. An optimal ligament surface strain value was also observed for the CO reduction on NPC, which provides more mechanistic insights into the complicated CO reduction process and an alternative strategy for Cu-based catalysts engineering. This work also shows how the application of synchrotron X-ray diffraction and EC-MS facilitates more efficient and accurate optimization of copper-based catalysts for electrochemical CO reduction.

Title: Thermoelectric processes of quantum normal-superconductor interfaces
Authors: L. Arrachea, A. Braggio, P. Burset, E. J. H. Lee, A. Levy Yeyati, R. Sánchez
Abstract: Superconducting interfaces have recently been demonstrated to contain a rich variety of effects that give rise to sizable thermoelectric responses and unexpected thermal properties, despite traditionally being considered poor thermoelectrics due to their intrinsic electron-hole symmetry. We review different mechanisms driving this response in hybrid normal-superconducting junctions, depending on the dimensionality of the mesoscopic interface. In addition to discussing heat to power conversion, cooling and heat transport, special emphasis is put on physical properties of hybrid devices that can be revealed by the thermoelectric effect.

Title: Interaction Effects on the Electronic Floquet Spectra: Excitonic Effects
Authors: Teng Xiao, Tsan Huang, Changhua Bao, Zhiyuan Sun
Abstract: Floquet engineering of electronic states by light is a central topic in modern experiments. However, the impact of many-body interactions on the single-electron properties remains unclear in this non-equilibrium situation. We propose that interaction effects could be reasonably understood by performing perturbative expansion in both the pump field and the electron-electron interaction when computing physical quantities. As an example, we apply this approach to semiconductors and show analytically that excitonic effects, i.e., effects of electron-hole interaction, lead to dramatic corrections to the single-electron Floquet spectra even when the excitons are only virtually excited by the pump light. We compute these effects in phosphorene and monolayer MoS$_2$ for time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (Tr-ARPES) and ultrafast optical experiments.

Title: Majorana edge modes in one-dimensional Kitaev chain with staggered $p$-wave superconducting pairing
Authors: Xiao-Jue Zhang, Rong Lü, Qi-Bo Zeng
Abstract: We introduce a new type of one-dimensional Kitaev chain with staggered $p$-wave superconducting pairing. We find three physical regimes in this model by tuning the $p$-wave pairing and the chemical potential of the system. In the topologically nontrivial phase, there are two Majorana zero modes localized at the opposite ends of the lattice, which are characterized and protected by nonzero topological invariants. More interestingly, we also find a regime where the system can hold four unprotected nonzero-energy edge modes in the trivial phase, which is analogous to a weak topological phase. The third regime is also trivial but holds no edge modes. The emergence of zero- and nonzero-energy edge modes in the system are analyzed by transforming the lattice model into a ladder consisting of Majorana fermions, where the competition between intra- and inter-leg couplings leads to the rich phase diagram. We further investigate the properties of edge modes under the influences of dissipation, which is represented by introducing a imaginary part in the chemical potential. Our work unveils the exotic properties induced by the staggered $p$-wave pairing and provides a new platform for further exploration of Majorana edge modes.

Title: DiffCrysGen: A Score-Based Diffusion Model for Design of Diverse Inorganic Crystalline Materials
Authors: Sourav Mal, Subhankar Mishra, Prasenjit Sen
Abstract: Crystal structure generation is a foundational challenge in materials discovery, particularly in designing functional inorganic crystalline materials with desired properties. Most existing diffusion-based generative models for crystals rely on complex, hand-crafted priors and modular architectures to separately model atom types, atomic positions, and lattice parameters. These methods often require customized diffusion processes and conditional denoising, which can introduce additional model complexities and inconsistencies. Here we introduce DiffCrysGen, a fully data-driven, score-based diffusion model that jointly learns the distribution of all structural components in crystalline materials. With crystal structure representation as unified 2D matrices, DiffCrysGen bypasses the need for task-specific priors or decoupled modules, enabling end-to-end generation of atom types, fractional coordinates, and lattice parameters within a single framework. Our model learns crystallographic symmetry and chemical validity directly from large-scale datasets, allowing it to scale to complex materials discovery tasks. As a demonstration, we applied DiffCrysGen to the design of rare-earth-free magnetic materials with high saturation magnetization, showing its effectiveness in generating stable, diverse, and property-aligned candidates for sustainable magnet applications.

Title: Unraveling the impact of competing interactions on non-equilibrium colloidal gelation
Authors: Joeri Opdam, Michio Tateno, Hajime Tanaka
Abstract: Competing interactions stabilize exotic mesoscopic structures, yet the microscopic mechanisms by which they influence non-equilibrium processes leading to disordered states remain largely unexplored, despite their critical role in self-assembly across a range of nanomaterials and biological systems. Here, we numerically investigate the structural evolution in charged colloidal model systems, where short-range attractions and long-range repulsions compete. We reveal that these two interaction scales drive sequential ordering within clusters, from tetrahedra motifs to linear aggregates with chiral order. This process disrupts early-stage percolated networks, resulting in reentrant behavior -- a dynamic transition from disordered cluster to network to chiral rigid cluster. On the other hand, the cluster-elastic network boundary in the final state is governed by isostatic percolation, which slows structural rearrangements, preserves branching points, and sustains a long-lived network. The resulting structure consist of rigid Bernal spiral-like branches connected through flexible branching points lacking order. These insights advance our microscopic understanding of out-of-equilibrium ordering driven by competing interactions, particularly phenomena like temporally delayed frustration reflecting different length scales of competing interactions. The mechanisms identified here may play a crucial role in mesoscale self-organization across soft materials, from nanoparticle assemblies to biological gels and cytoskeletal networks. Understanding how competing interactions regulate structure and dynamics could guide the design of adaptive materials with tunable mechanical properties and offer new perspectives on biological processes such as cytoplasmic organization and cellular scaffolding.

Title: Optimized flux single-crystal growth of the quantum spin liquid candidate NdTa$_7$O$_{19}$ and other rare-earth heptatantalates, ErTa$_7$O$_{19}$ and GdTa$_7$O$_{19}$
Authors: Lia Šibav, Matic Lozinšek, Zvonko Jagličić, Tina Arh, Panchanana Khuntia, Andrej Zorko, Mirela Dragomir
Abstract: Single crystals are essential for characterizing a wide range of magnetic states, including exotic ones such as quantum spin liquids. This study reports a flux method for growing single crystals of NdTa$_7$O$_{19}$, the first quantum spin liquid candidate on a triangular spin lattice with dominant Ising like spin correlations. Purple NdTa$_7$O$_{19}$ single crystals with hexagonal morphology were successfully grown using a K$_2$Mo$_3$O$_{10}$-B$_2$O$_3$ flux. With lateral sizes up to 3.5 mm and a thickness up to 2 mm, these are the largest dimensions reported to date. The chemical composition was confirmed by powder and single-crystal X-ray diffraction along with scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Aiming for an accurate determination of the magnetic anisotropy and its effect on the magnetic properties, NdTa$_7$O$_{19}$ crystals were additionally analyzed by magnetic susceptibility, revealing a substantial anisotropy without long-range magnetic ordering down to 2 K. Single crystals of two novel rare-earth heptatantalates, ErTa$_7$O$_{19}$ and GdTa$_7$O$_{19}$, were also grown and their magnetic properties investigated. The magnetic anisotropy of ErTa$_7$O$_{19}$ closely resembles that of isostructural NdTa$_7$O$_{19}$, indicating a possibility of a similar exotic magnetic ground state. In contrast, GdTa$_7$O$_{19}$ shows paramagnetic behavior, consistent with previous results obtained for polycrystalline samples.

Title: Low-energy effective Hamiltonian and end states of an inverted HgTe nanowire
Authors: Rui Li
Abstract: The band inversion transition in a cylindrical HgTe nanowire is inducible via varying the nanowire radius. Here we derive the low-energy effective Hamiltonian describing the band structure of the HgTe nanowire close to the fundamental band gap. Because both the $E_{1}$ and $H_{1}$ subbands have quadratic dependence on $k_{z}$ when the gap closes, we need to consider at least three subbands, i.e., the $E_{1}$, $H_{1}$, and $H_{2}$ subbands, in building the effective Hamiltonian. The resulted effective Hamiltonian is block diagonal and each block is a $3\times3$ matrix. End states are found in the inverted regime when we solve the effective Hamiltonian with open boundary condition.

Title: Beyond the Octupole Approximation in Non-Collinear Antiferromagnetic Thin Films
Authors: Freya Johnson, Jan Zemen, Geri Topore, Michele Shelly Conroy, Shanglong Ning, Jiahao Han, Shunsuke Fukami, Chiara Ciccarelli, Lesley F. Cohen
Abstract: Noncollinear antiferromagnets offer much promise for antiferromagnetic spintronics and neuromorphic applications with a plethora of functional properties surpassing many competing magnetic systems. Films grown on mismatched substrates can relieve strain by the creation of slip-plane defects - and recently we have shown that these defects can manipulate global physical properties important for application. Here we demonstrate that post growth annealing results in near-defect-free, structurally robust films that allow the magnetic order thermal evolution to change as a function of film thickness. Strong spin-lattice coupling ensures that substrate clamping limits the ability of thinner films to transform as they are cooled to low temperature. However, beyond a certain thickness, films no longer suffer this constraint, revealing the extraordinary transformations that provide the pathway for spin to reach the lowest energy state. We show that this transition cannot be explained by the previously established mechanism of spin rotations in the (111) plane, and we calculate that rotations along the chirality-inverting [1-10] direction may be preferable under certain conditions. Our work suggests that chirality inverting rotations in these materials may have been previously overlooked in studies adopting the so-called octupole approximation of the net magnetic moment. This enriches the field of antiferromagnetic spintronics, raising the possibility of device designs with thickness engineered to exploit switching of chirality.

Title: Topological characterization of Hopfions in finite-element micromagnetics
Authors: Louis Gallard, Riccardo Hertel
Abstract: Topological magnetic structures, such as Hopfions, are central to three-dimensional magnetism, but their characterization in complex geometries remains challenging. We introduce a robust finite-element method for calculating the Hopf index in micromagnetic simulations of three-dimensional nanostructures. By employing the Biot-Savart form for the vector potential, our approach ensures gauge-invariant results, even in multiply connected geometries like tori. A novel variance-based correction scheme significantly reduces numerical errors in highly inhomogeneous textures, achieving accurate Hopf index values with fast mesh-dependent convergence. We validate the method using an analytically defined Hopfion structure and demonstrate its ability to detect topological transitions through a simulation of a Hopfion's field-induced destruction into a toron, marked by an abrupt change in the Hopf index. This method enables precise quantification of topological features in complex three-dimensional magnetic textures forming in finite-element micromagnetic simulations, offering a powerful tool for advancing topological magnetism studies in general geometries.

Title: Melting of Charge Density Waves in Low Dimensions
Authors: Jeremy M. Shen, Alex Stangel, Suk Hyun Sung, Ismail El Baggari, Kai Sun, Robert Hovden
Abstract: Charge density waves (CDWs) are collective electronic states that can reshape and melt, even while confined within a rigid atomic crystal. In two dimensions, melting is predicted to be distinct, proceeding through partially ordered nematic and hexatic states that are neither liquid nor crystal. Here we measure and explain how continuous, hexatic melting of incommensurate CDWs occurs in low-dimensional materials. As a CDW is thermally excited, disorder emerges progressively$\unicode{x2013}$initially through smooth elastic deformations that modulate the local wavelength, and subsequently via the nucleation of topological defects. Experimentally, we track three hallmark signatures of CDW melting$\unicode{x2013}$azimuthal superlattice peak broadening, wavevector contraction, and integrated intensity decay.

Title: Oxyfluoride glasses obtained through incorporation of CaF$_2$ into photovoltaic cover glass melts

Abstract: The glass industry has limited options to mitigate its environmental footprint, and the demand for cover glass to produce photovoltaic panels is increasing. Currently, the majority of this special type of glass is not being recycled, and in this work, we propose to reuse it as raw material to obtain oxyfluoride glasses. The incorporation of CaF$_2$ and the increasing Na$_2$CO$_3$ content resulted in a melting temperature of about 1200$^o$C, significantly lower than in soda-lime glasses, which adds up to the environmental benefits of reusing end-of-life cover glass. The obtained samples show high transparency and thermal stability, allowing the cover glass to make up to 80\% of its weight. XRF analysis was employed to determine the elemental composition of the samples, while XRD and Raman indicated that by adding CaF$_2$, the glass network was depolymerized. In situ XRD as a function of temperature showed the formation of a few crystalline phases in these oxyfluoride samples, evidencing that it can be explored as a matrix to obtain different glass-ceramics. The combination of the glass properties indicates that this method and the resulting material can contribute to reducing the environmental impact of the glass industry, by creating new glass or glass-ceramic materials that can be obtained at a reduced temperature compared to the soda-lime glass, while cover glass being the primary raw material could reduce the need to extract minerals from nature.

Title: Gate modulation and interface engineering on Coulomb blockade in open superconducting islands
Authors: Huading Song, Dong Pan, Runan Shang, Zhaoyu Wang, Ke He, Jianhua Zhao, Hao Zhang
Abstract: Mesoscopic Coulomb blockade (MCB) is recognized as a phase-coherent variant of the conventional Coulomb blockade that arises in systems with open contacts. In open quantum dots, MCB is enhanced by a decrease in background conductance. This occurs because the reduction in coupling strength between the quantum dot and the outer reservoir renders the system more closed, thereby facilitating the emergence of conventional Coulomb blockade. In this work, we demonstrate that the MCB in open superconducting islands exhibits an different correlation with coupling strength compared to open quantum dots. Specifically, a decrease in background conductance may result in a weakening of the MCB. This observation indicates that the MCB in superconducting islands originates from the presence of superconducting-normal interfaces.

Title: Explosive growth of bistability in a cavity magnonic system
Authors: Meng-Xia Bi, Huawei Fan, Wenting Wu, Jing-Jing He, Ming-Liang Hu, Xiao-Hong Yan
Abstract: We conduct a theoretical investigation into explosive growth of bistability in a cavity magnonic system incorporating magnetic nonlinearity. In this system, the coupling between the magnon and photon generates the cavity magnon polaritons. When driving the photon-like polariton mode, the bistability can undergo a sudden transition with the increase of the driving power, resulting in an explosive growth of the bistable region by several times. Conversely, driving the magnon-like polariton mode only gives rise to normal bistability. This depends on whether the minimum driving power required to generate the bistability is non-monotonic with respect to the driving frequency. In addition, despite driving only the photon-like polariton mode, the photon- and magnon-like polariton modes can show simultaneous explosive growth of the bistability in microwave transmission, owing to the light-matter interaction. Our research sheds light on the hidden side of the nonlinear cavity magnonic system and provides a potential application for cavity spintronic devices founded on this novel feature.

Title: Unveiling Phonon Contributions to Thermal Transport and the Failure of the Wiedemann-Franz Law in Ruthenium and Tungsten Thin Films
Authors: Md. Rafiqul Islam, Pravin Karna, Niraj Bhatt, Sandip Thakur, Helge Heinrich, Daniel M. Hirt, Saman Zare, Christopher Jezewski, Rinus T.P. Lee, Kandabara Tapily, John T.Gaskins, Colin D. Landon, Sean W. King, Ashutosh Giri, Patrick E. Hopkins
Abstract: Thermal transport in nanoscale interconnects is dominated by intricate electron-phonon interactions and microstructural influences. As copper faces limitations at the nanoscale, tungsten and ruthenium have emerged as promising alternatives due to their substantial phonon contributions to thermal conductivity. Metals with stronger phonon-mediated thermal transport are particularly advantageous in nanoscale architectures, where phonons are less sensitive to size effects than electrons. Here, we show that phonons play a comparable role to electrons in the thermal transport of ruthenium and tungsten thin films, evidenced by deviations from the classical Wiedemann-Franz law. Elevated Lorenz numbers-1.9 and 2.7 times the Sommerfeld value for ruthenium and tungsten, respectively-indicate phonon contributions of 45% and 62% to total thermal conductivity. Comparisons of in-plane thermal conductivity from steady-state thermoreflectance and electron relaxation times from infrared ellipsometry reveal that phonon-mediated transport is insensitive to microstructural variations and scaling. Ultrafast infrared pump-probe measurements show that ruthenium exhibits a higher electron-phonon coupling factor than tungsten, consistent with the differing contributions of carriers to thermal transport. Molecular dynamics simulations and spectral energy density analysis confirm substantial phonon-driven thermal transport and mode-dependent phonon lifetimes. These results offer insights into phonon-driven thermal transport and provide design principles for selecting interconnects with enhanced thermal management.

Title: Hydrogen peroxide electrosynthesis: A comparative study employing Vulcan carbon modification by different MnO2 nanostructures
Authors: João Paulo C Moura, Vanessa S Antonin, Aline B Trench, Mauro C Santos
Abstract: The electrochemical performances of the {\alpha}-MnO2/Vulcan XC-72 and {\delta}-MnO2/Vulcan XC-72 nanostructures in hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) electrosynthesis were compared herein. Both materials were synthesized by a simple hydrothermal route. Their structures and morphologies were analyzed by SEM, HRTEM, XPS, Raman Scattering and XRD, and their ORR electrochemical properties and H2O2 electrosynthesis efficacies were investigated in alkaline NaOH solutions applying the rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) technique. Gas diffusion electrode (GDE) setups in acid media aiming at H2O2 formation were also performed. The 3% {\delta}-MnO2/C and 1% {\alpha}-MnO2/C electrocatalysts were more efficient and selective than pure Vulcan XC-72 through the ORR 2-electron pathway in the RRDE essays. Concerning H2O2 electrogeneration using GDE, the 1% {\alpha}-MnO2/C electrocatalyst displayed better activity, with peroxide accumulation of 402.6 mg/L at -1.9 V (vs Ag/AgCl) after 120 min, 48 % higher than pure Vulcan XC-72 GDE. These results can be ascribed to a synergistic effect between {\alpha}-MnO2 and Vulcan XC-72, as well as oxygen functional acid species improvement, increasing electrocatalytic surface hydrophilicity and enhancing H2O2 electrosynthesis.

Title: Quantum Monte Carlo study of the bond- and site-diluted transverse-field Ising model
Authors: C. Krämer, M. Hörmann, K.P. Schmidt
Abstract: We study the transverse-field Ising model on a square lattice with bond- and site-dilution at zero temperature by stochastic series expansion quantum Monte Carlo simulations. Tuning the transverse field $h$ and the dilution $p$, the quantum phase diagram of both models is explored. Both quantum phase diagrams show long-range order for small $h$ and small $p$. The ordered phase of each is separated from the disordered (quantum) Griffiths phase by second-order phase transitions on two critical lines touching at a multi-critical point. Using Binder ratios we locate quantum critical points with high accuracy. The order-parameter critical exponent $\beta$ and the average correlation-length exponent $\nu_{\mathrm{av}}$ are determined along the critical lines and at the multi-critical points for the first time via finite-size scaling. We find three internally consistent sets of critical exponents and compare them with potentially connected universality classes. The quantum Griffiths phase in the vicinity of the phase transition lines is analyzed through the local susceptibility. Our results indicate that activated scaling occurs not only at the percolation transition, but also at the phase transition line for $p$ smaller than the percolation threshold $p_c$.

Title: Fundamental Understanding of Exposure and Process Chemistry for Enhanced Lithography and Stability of Metal Oxide Resists

Abstract: Metal oxide resists (MORs) have shown great promise for high resolution patterning in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography, with potential for integration into high volume manufacturing. However, MORs have recently been shown to exhibit sensitivity to process conditions and environment, leading to critical dimension (CD) variation. While this variation can be reduced with proper process control, there is little knowledge on how these aspects affect the image formation mechanism. To bridge these knowledge gaps, we deploy a coordinated, fundamentals-focused approach to yield deep insights into MOR exposure and process chemistry. Our results on a model MOR, an n-butyl Sn-Oxo system, reveal how parameters such as exposure dose, post-exposure bake temperature, and atmospheric species influence the image formation mechanism. Our results, and the coordinated approach using correlative spectroscopies, provide a strong foundation for understanding the image formation mechanism in MOR materials with potential to link mechanistic aspects to CD variation.

Title: Design Principles for Realizable Discrete Surface Embeddings in Physical Systems
Authors: Kyungeun Kim, Christian D. Santangelo
Abstract: The isometric embedding of surfaces in three-dimensional space is fundamental to various physical systems, from elastic sheets to programmable materials. While continuous surfaces typically admit unique solutions under suitable boundary conditions, their discrete counterparts-represented as networks of vertices connected by edges-can exhibit multiple distinct embeddings for identical edge lengths. We present a systematic approach to constructing discrete meshes that yield a controlled number of embeddings. By analyzing the relationship between mesh connectivity and embedding multiplicity through rigidity theory, we develop criteria for designing meshes that minimize solution multiplicity. We demonstrate computational methods based on local matrix operations and trilateration techniques, enabling practical implementation for meshes with approximately a thousand vertices. Our analysis provides both theoretical bounds on the number of possible embeddings based on Bézout's theorem and practical guidelines for mesh construction in physical applications. Through numerical simulations, we show that this approach achieves comparable accuracy to traditional minimization methods while offering computational advantages through sequential computation. Importantly, we demonstrate that in cases where a unique smooth solution exists, local fluctuations in reconstructed shapes derived from the computational grid can serve as indicators of insufficient geometric constraints. This work bridges the gap between discrete and continuous embedding problems, providing insights for applications in 4D printing, mechanical meta-materials, and deployable structures.

Title: Effective bands and band-like electron transport in amorphous solids
Authors: Matthew Jankousky, Dimitar Pashov, Ross E. Larsen, Vladimir Dobrosavljevic, Mark van Schilfgaarde, Vladan Stevanovic
Abstract: The localization of electrons caused by atomic disorder is a well-known phenomenon. However, what circumstances allow electrons to remain delocalized and retain band-like characteristics even when the crystal structure is completely absent, as found in certain amorphous solids, is less well understood. To probe this phenomenon, we developed a fully first-principles description of the electronic structure and charge transport in amorphous solids by combining a novel representation of the amorphous state with the state-of-the-art many-body (QSGW) electronic structure theory. Using amorphous In2O3 as an example, we demonstrate the accuracy of our approach in reproducing the band-like nature of the conduction electrons as well as their disorder-limited mobility. Our approach reveals the physical origins responsible for the electron delocalization and the survival of the band dispersions despite the absence of long-range order.

Title: Interplay of localization and topology in disordered dimerized array of Rydberg atoms
Authors: Maksym Prodius, Adith Sai Aramthottil, Jakub Zakrzewski
Abstract: Rydberg tweezer arrays provide a platform for realizing spin-1/2 Hamiltonians with long-range tunnelings decaying according to power-law with the distance. We numerically investigate the effects of positional disorder and dimerization on the properties of excited states in such a one-dimensional system. Our model allows for the continuous tuning of dimerization patterns and disorder strength. We identify different distinct ergodicity-breaking regimes within the parameter space constrained by our geometry. Notably, one of these regimes exhibits a unique feature in which non-trivial symmetry-protected topological (SPT) properties of the ground state extend to a noticeable fraction of states across the entire spectrum. This interplay between localization and SPT makes the system particularly interesting, as localization should help with stabilization of topological excitations, while SPT states contribute to an additional delocalization. Other regions of parameters correspond to more standard nonergodic dynamics resembling many-body localization.

Title: Pyrite Bismuth Telluride Heterojunction for Hybrid Electromagnetic to Thermoelectric Energy Harvesting
Authors: Karthik R, Yiwen Zheng, Caique Campos de Oliveira, Punathil Raman Sreeram, Pedro Alves da Silva Autreto, Aniruddh Vashisth, Chandra Sekhar Tiwary
Abstract: The rapid proliferation of wireless networks and connected devices has led to pervasive electromagnetic (EM) energy dissipation into the environment, an underutilized resource for energy harvesting. Here, we demonstrate a pyrite (FeS$_2$)-bismuth telluride (Bi$_2$Te$_3$) heterojunction that enables hybrid electromagnetic-to-thermoelectric energy conversion. Fabricated via a simple cold-press compaction of powders, the heterojunction forms a Schottky interface at FeS$_2$, facilitating efficient RF absorption and localized heating. This heat is harvested by Bi$_2$Te$_3$ through thermoelectric conversion. Under 35~MHz RF irradiation at 1~W input power, the device achieved a local temperature rise of 46~$^\circ$C and a thermal gradient of 5.5~K across the Bi$_2$Te$_3$, resulting in a peak power density of approximately 13~mW/cm$^2$. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations further elucidate the heat transport behavior and interfacial thermoelectric performance. This work introduces a new class of heterostructures for RF-responsive energy harvesting, offering a scalable route toward self-powered IoT and wireless sensing systems.

Title: Spatio-temporal spin transport from first principles
Authors: Mayada Fadel, Joshua Quinton, Mani Chandra, Mayank Gupta, Yuan Ping, Ravishankar Sundararaman
Abstract: We introduce a computational framework for first-principles density matrix transport within the Wigner function formalism to predict transport of quantum-mechanical degrees of freedom such as spin over long time and length scales. This framework facilitates simulation of spin dynamics and transport from first principles, while accounting for electron-phonon scattering at device length scales. We demonstrate this framework to elucidate the impact of various spin-orbit field profiles, such as Rashba and persistent spin helix, on coherent spin transport in several materials. Using graphene under an electric field as an example to illustrate the impact of electron-phonon scattering on incoherent transport, we show how the transport changes with the strength of scattering. We identify three distinct regimes of incoherent spin transport corresponding to the free induction decay, Dyakonov-Perel and Elliott-Yafet regimes of spin relaxation. In particular, we show that the spin diffusion length is insensitive to the strength of scattering within the Dyakonov-Perel regime.

Title: Mapping of Microstructure Transitions during Rapid Alloy Solidification Using Bayesian-Guided Phase-Field Simulations
Authors: José Mancias, Brent Vela, Juan Flórez-Coronel, Rouhollah Tavakoli, Douglas Allaire, Raymundo Arróyave, Damien Tourret
Abstract: This study addresses microstructure selection mechanisms in rapid solidification, specifically targeting the transition from cellular/dendritic to planar interface morphologies under conditions relevant to additive manufacturing. We use a phase-field model that quantitatively captures solute trapping, kinetic undercooling, and morphological instabilities across a broad range of growth velocities ($V$) and thermal gradients ($G$), and apply it to a binary Fe-Cr alloy, as a surrogate for 316L stainless steel. By combining high-fidelity phase-field simulations with a Gaussian Process-based Bayesian active learning approach, we efficiently map the microstructure transitions in the multi-dimensional space of composition, growth velocity, and temperature gradient. We compare our PF results to classical theories for rapid solidification. The classical KGT model yields an accurate prediction of the value of $G$ above which the interface is planar for any growth velocity. Microstructures transition from dendrites to cells as the temperature gradient increases close to this value of $G$. We also identify the occurrence of unstable "intermediate" microstructures at the border between dendritic and planar at low $G$, in the absence of banding instability in this Fe-Cr alloy. Our results highlight the capabilities of Bayesian-guided PF approaches in exploring complex microstructural transitions in multidimensional parameters spaces, thereby providing a robust computational tool for designing process parameters to achieve targeted microstructures and properties in rapidly solidified metallic alloys.

Title: Non-linear flow of two-dimensional viscous electron fluid in moderate magnetic fields
Authors: P. S. Alekseev, M. A. Semina
Abstract: In two-dimensional (2D) electron systems, the inter-particle interaction can lead to the formation of a viscous electron fluid and realization of the hydrodynamic regime of electron transport. Here a nonlinear model of the electron hydrodynamic transport is constructed based on the accounting of pair correlations in the electron dynamics. When describing these systems within the framework of classical kinetics, such correlations represent subsequent ``extended'' collisions of the same electrons temporarily joined into pairs. We study their influence on stationary magnetotransport for large-amplitude fluid flows in long samples. Current profiles in the nonlinear regime and the corresponding differential magnetoresistance are calculated. Pair correlations lead to a characteristic nonmonotonic dependence of the differential resistance on magnetic field. We compare our results with experimental data on magnetoresistance of 2D electrons in high-purity GaAs quantum wells; our model can be responsible for a part of the observed features of the differential magnetoresistance.

Title: Unraveling Mn intercalation and diffusion in NbSe$_2$ bilayers through DFTB simulations
Authors: Bruno Ipaves, Raphael B. de Oliveira, Guilherme da Silva Lopes Fabris, Matthias Batzill, Douglas S. Galvão
Abstract: Understanding transition metal atoms' intercalation and diffusion behavior in two-dimensional (2D) materials is essential for advancing their potential in spintronics and other emerging technologies. In this study, we used density functional tight binding (DFTB) simulations to investigate the atomic-scale mechanisms of manganese (Mn) intercalation into NbSe$_2$ bilayers. Our results show that Mn prefers intercalated and embedded positions rather than surface adsorption, as cohesive energy calculations indicate enhanced stability in these configurations. Nudged elastic band (NEB) calculations revealed an energy barrier of 0.68 eV for the migration of Mn into the interlayer, comparable to other substrates, suggesting accessible diffusion pathways. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations further demonstrated an intercalation concentration-dependent behavior. Mn atoms initially adsorb on the surface and gradually diffuse inward, resulting in an effective intercalation at higher Mn densities before clustering effects emerge. These results provide helpful insights into the diffusion pathways and stability of Mn atoms within NbSe$_2$ bilayers, consistent with experimental observations and offering a deeper understanding of heteroatom intercalation mechanisms in transition metal dichalcogenides.

Title: Unconventional Fractional Phases in Multi-Band Vortexable Systems
Authors: Siddhartha Sarkar, Xiaohan Wan, Ang-Kun Wu, Shi-Zeng Lin, Kai Sun
Abstract: In this Letter, we study topological flat bands with distinct features that deviate from conventional Landau level behavior. We show that even in the ideal quantum geometry limit, moire flat band systems can exhibit physical phenomena fundamentally different from Landau levels without lattices. In particular, we find new fractional quantum Hall states emerging from multi-band vortexable systems, where multiple exactly flat bands appear at the Fermi energy. While the set of bands as a whole exhibits ideal quantum geometry, individual bands separately lose vortexability, and thus making them very different from a stack of Landau levels. At certain filling fractions, we find fractional states whose Hall conductivity deviates from the filling factor. Through careful numerical and analytical studies, we rule out all known mechanisms--such as fractional quantum Hall crystals or separate filling of trivial and topological bands--as possible explanations. Leveraging the exact solvability of vortexable systems, we use analytic Bloch wavefunctions to uncover the origin of these new fractional states, which arises from the commensurability between the moire unit cell and the magnetic unit cell of an emergent effective magnetic field.

Title: Emerging (2+1)D electrodynamics and topological instanton in pseudo-Hermitian two-level systems
Authors: Kuangyin Deng, Ran Cheng
Abstract: We reveal a hidden electrodynamical structure emerging from a general $2\times2$ pseudo-Hermitian system that exhibits real spectra. Even when the Hamiltonian does not explicitly depend on time, the Berry curvature can be mapped onto a $2+1$ dimensional electromagnetic field arising from an artificial spacetime instanton, in sharp contrast to the Hermitian systems where the Berry curvature is equivalent to the static magnetic field of a magnetic monopole in three spatial dimensions. The instanton appearing as a spacetime singularity carries a topological charge that quantizes the jump of magnetic flux of the Berry curvature at the time origin. Our findings are demonstrated in a simple example related to antiferromagnetic magnons.

Title: Classical symmetry enriched topological orders and distinct monopole charges for dipole-octupole spin ices
Authors: Pengwei Zhao, Gang v. Chen
Abstract: Distinct symmetry enriched topological orders often do not have classical distinctions. Motivated by the recent process on the pyrochlore spin ice materials based on the dipole-octupole doublets, we argue that dipolar spin liquid and octupolar spin liquid can be well differentiated through the magnetic charges of the magnetic monopoles in the classical spin ice regime. It is observed and predicted that, the long-range dipole-dipole interaction renders the magnetic monopole of the dipolar spin ice a finite magnetic charge via the dumbbell picture even in the classical regime. For the octupolar spin ice, however, a zero magnetic charge is expected from this mechanism in the classical regime. We expect this smoking-gun observation to resolve the debate on the nature of Ce$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$, and more broadly, this work may inspire further experiments and thoughts on the Ce-pyrochlore spin liquids, Nd-pyrochlore antiferromagnets, Er-based spinels, and the distinct properties of the emergent quasiparticles in various symmetry enriched topological phases.

Title: Two-step phase transitions in Fe(Se,Te)

Abstract: In the studied crystals of FeSe0.7 Te0.3 , a structural phase transition occurs in two stages. At higher temperatures, the electronic subsystem undergoes a reconstruction, leading to a significant increase in elastoresistance. 77 Se NMR data show an abrupt change in the relaxation rate during this transition. The final transition occurs at a temperature several degrees below and is also accompanied by anomalies in the electronic properties. Thus, in the Fe(Se,Te) series, similarly to the behavior of pure FeSe under pressure, the type of transition changes and intermediate state appear before the structural transition is suppressed. This similarity between the corresponding phase diagrams is explained by the same deformation of the iron coordination environment in Fe(Se,Te) compounds and in FeSe under pressure. Our findings provide new and significant information on the phase diagram of Fe(Se,Te) compounds and in particular suggest the possible existence of a triple point near the quantum critical point.

Title: PtyRAD: A High-performance and Flexible Ptychographic Reconstruction Framework with Automatic Differentiation
Authors: Chia-Hao Lee, Steven E. Zeltmann, Dasol Yoon, Desheng Ma, David A. Muller
Abstract: Electron ptychography has recently achieved unprecedented resolution, offering valuable insights across diverse material systems, including in three dimensions. However, high-quality ptychographic reconstruction is computationally expensive and time consuming, requiring a significant amount of manually tuning even for experts. Additionally, essential tools for ptychographic analysis are often scattered across multiple software packages, with some advanced features available only in costly commercial software like MATLAB. To address these challenges, we introduce PtyRAD, an open-source software framework offers a comprehensive, flexible, and computationally efficient solution for electron ptychography. PtyRAD provides seamless optimization of multiple parameters--such as sample thickness, local tilts, probe positions, and mixed probe and object modes--using gradient-based methods with automatic differentiation (AD). By utilizing PyTorch's highly optimized tensor operations, PtyRAD achieves up to a 17x speedup in reconstruction time compared to existing packages without compromising image quality. In addition, we propose a real-space depth regularization, which avoids wrap-around artifacts and can be useful for twisted two-dimensional (2D) material datasets and vertical heterostructures. Moreover, PtyRAD integrates a Bayesian optimization workflow that streamlines hyperparameter selection. We hope the open-source nature of PtyRAD will foster reproducibility and community-driven development for future advances in ptychographic imaging.

Title: Integrability and Chaos via fractal analysis of Spectral Form Factors: Gaussian approximations and exact results
Authors: Lorenzo Campos Venuti, Jovan Odavić, Alioscia Hamma
Abstract: We establish the mathematical equivalence between the spectral form factor, a quantity used to identify the onset of quantum chaos and scrambling in quantum many-body systems, and the classical problem of statistical characterization of planar random walks. We thus associate to any quantum Hamiltonian a random process on the plane. We set down rigorously the conditions under which such random process becomes a Wiener process in the thermodynamic limit and the associated distribution of the distance from the origin becomes Gaussian. This leads to the well known Gaussian behavior of the spectral form factor for quantum chaotic (non-integrable) models, which we show to be violated at low temperature. For systems with quasi-free spectrum (integrable), instead, the distribution of the SFF is Log-Normal. We compute all the moments of the spectral form factor exactly without resorting to the Gaussian approximation. Assuming degeneracies in the quantum chaotic spectrum we solve the classical problem of random walker taking steps of unequal lengths. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Hausdorff dimension of the frontier of the random walk, defined as the boundary of the unbounded component of the complement, approaches 1 for the integrable Brownian motion, while the non-integrable walk approaches that obtained by the Schramm-Loewner Evolution (SLE) with the fractal dimension $4/3$. Additionally, we numerically show that Bethe Ansatz walkers fall into a category similar to the non-integrable walkers.

Title: RAAC panels can suddenly collapse before any warning of corrosion-induced surface cracking
Authors: E. Korec, P. Grassl, M. Jirasek, H.S. Wong, E. Martínez-Pañeda
Abstract: The collapse of reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete (RAAC) panels has attracted considerable public and academic interest. As detailed experimental data are not yet available and replicating the natural corrosion process requires years or decades, computational modelling is essential to understand under which conditions corrosion remains concealed. The very high porosity of RAAC is widely suspected to be a major contributing factor. However, current corrosion-induced cracking models are known to struggle with capturing the role of concrete porosity. To remedy this critical deficiency, we propose to enrich corrosion-induced cracking modelling with the analytical solution of reactive transport equations governing the precipitation of rust and a porosity-dependent description of diffusivity. With this, the corrosion concealment in RAAC panels is studied computationally for the first time, revealing that RAAC panels can suddenly collapse before any warning of corrosion-induced surface cracking and allowing to map the conditions most likely to result in sudden collapse.

Title: 2D Quon Language: Unifying Framework for Cliffords, Matchgates, and Beyond
Authors: Byungmin Kang, Chen Zhao, Zhengwei Liu, Xun Gao, Soonwon Choi
Abstract: Simulating generic quantum states and dynamics is practically intractable using classical computers. However, certain special classes -- namely Clifford and matchgate circuits -- permit efficient computation. They provide invaluable tools for studying many-body physics, quantum chemistry, and quantum computation. While both play foundational roles across multiple disciplines, the origins of their tractability seem disparate, and their relationship remain unclear. A deeper understanding of such tractable classes could expand their scope and enable a wide range of new applications. In this work, we make progress toward the unified understanding of the Clifford and matchgate -- these two classes are, in fact, distinct special cases of a single underlying structure. Specifically, we introduce the 2D Quon language, which combines Majorana worldlines with their underlying spacetime topology to diagrammatically represent quantum processes and tensor networks. In full generality, the 2D Quon language is universal -- capable of representing arbitrary quantum states, dynamics, or tensor networks -- yet they become especially powerful in describing Clifford and matchgate classes. Each class can be efficiently characterized in a visually recognizable manner using the Quon framework. This capability naturally gives rise to several families of efficiently computable tensor networks introduced in this work: punctured matchgates, hybrid Clifford-matchgate-MPS, and ansatze generated from factories of tractable networks. All of these exhibit high non-Cliffordness, high non-matchgateness, and large bipartite entanglement entropy. We discuss a range of applications of our approach, from recovering well-known results such as the Kramers-Wannier duality and the star-triangle relation of the Ising model, to enabling variational optimization with novel ansatz states.

Title: Ultrastrong Light-Matter Coupling in Materials
Authors: Niclas S. Mueller, Eduardo B. Barros, Stephanie Reich
Abstract: Ultrastrong light-matter coupling has traditionally been studied in optical cavities, where it occurs when the light-matter coupling strength reaches a significant fraction of the transition frequency. This regime fundamentally alters the ground and excited states of the particle-cavity system, unlocking new ways to control its physics and chemistry. However, achieving ultrastrong coupling in engineered cavities remains a major challenge. Here, we show that ultra- and deep-strong coupling naturally occur in bulk materials without the need for external cavities. By analyzing experimental data from over 70 materials, we demonstrate that phonon-, exciton-, and plasmon-polaritons in many solids exhibit ultrastrong coupling, systematically surpassing the coupling strengths achieved in cavity-based systems. To explain this phenomenon, we introduce a dipole lattice model based on a generalized Hopfield Hamiltonian, which unifies photon-matter, matter-matter, and photon-photon interactions. The complete overlap between the photonic and collective dipole modes in the lattice enables ultrastrong coupling, leading to excited-state mixing, radiative decay suppression, and potential phase transitions into collective ground states. Applying our model to real materials, we show that it reproduces light-matter coupling across broad material classes and may underlie structural phase transitions that give rise to emergent phenomena such as ferroelectricity, insulator-to-metal transitions, and exciton condensation. Recognizing ultrastrong coupling as an intrinsic property of solids reshapes our understanding of light-matter interactions and opens new avenues for exploring quantum materials and exotic phases of matter.

Title: Lipidation-induced bacterial cell membrane translocation of star-peptides
Authors: Amal Jayawardena, Andrew Hung, Greg Qiao, Elnaz Hajizadeh
Abstract: The rapid emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria demands development of novel and effective antimicrobial agents. Structurally Nanoengineered Antimicrobial Peptide Polymers (SNAPPs), characterized by their unique star-shaped architecture and potent multivalent interactions, represent a promising solution. This study leverages molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the impact of lipidation on SNAPPs' structural stability, membrane interactions, and antibacterial efficacy. We show that lipidation with hexanoic acid (C6), lauric acid (C12), and stearic acid (C18) enhances the {\alpha}-helical stability of SNAPP arms, facilitating deeper insertion into the hydrophobic core of bacterial membranes. Among the variants, C12-SNAPP exhibits the most significant bilayer disruption, followed by C6-SNAPP, whereas the excessive hydrophobicity of C18-SNAPP leads to pronounced arm back-folding towards the core, reducing its effective interaction with the bilayer and limiting its bactericidal performance. Additionally, potential of mean force (PMF) analysis reveals that lipidation reduces the free energy barrier for translocation through the bilipid membrane compared to non-lipidated SNAPPs. These findings underscore the critical role of lipidation in optimizing SNAPPs for combating MDR pathogens. By fine-tuning lipid chain lengths, this study provides a framework for designing next-generation antimicrobial agents to address the global antibiotic resistance crisis, advancing modern therapeutic strategies.

Title: Efficient Long-Range Machine Learning Force Fields for Liquid and Materials Properties
Authors: John L. Weber, Rishabh D. Guha, Garvit Agarwal, Yujing Wei, Aidan A. Fike, Xiaowei Xie, James Stevenson, Karl Leswing, Mathew D. Halls, Robert Abel, Leif D. Jacobson
Abstract: Machine learning force fields (MLFFs) have emerged as a sophisticated tool for cost-efficient atomistic simulations approaching DFT accuracy, with recent message passing MLFFs able to cover the entire periodic table. We present an invariant message passing MLFF architecture (MPNICE) which iteratively predicts atomic partial charges, including long-range interactions, enabling the prediction of charge-dependent properties while achieving 5-20x faster inference versus models with comparable accuracy. We train direct and delta-learned MPNICE models for organic systems, and benchmark against experimental properties of liquid and solid systems. We also benchmark the energetics of finite systems, contributing a new set of torsion scans with charged species and a new set of DLPNO-CCSD(T) references for the TorsionNet500 benchmark. We additionally train and benchmark MPNICE models for bulk inorganic crystals, focusing on structural ranking and mechanical properties. Finally, we explore multi-task models for both inorganic and organic systems, which exhibit slightly decreased performance on domain-specific tasks but surprising generalization, stably predicting the gas phase structure of $\simeq500$ Pt/Ir organometallic complexes despite never training to organometallic complexes of any kind.

Title: Inverse Design of Broadband Antennas for Terahertz Devices Based on 2D Materials
Authors: M. Lukianov, A. Maevskiy, N. Kazeev, D. Mylnikov, K.S. Novoselov, D.A. Svintsov, A. Ustyuzhanin, D.A. Bandurin
Abstract: Terahertz (THz) technology, a cornerstone of next-generation high-speed communication and sensing, has long been hindered by impedance mismatch challenges that limit device performance and applicability. These challenges become particularly pronounced when ultrasensitive two-dimensional (2D) materials are employed as the device substrate in the THz range, further complicating their integration into real-world applications. Furthermore, conventional antenna designs often fail to provide adequate matching across the extensive THz spectrum. In this work, we tackle these challenges using a procedural generation algorithm to design THz broadband antennas that satisfy specific performance criteria. Namely, the developed inverse design methodology enables customization for the target impedance value, bandwidth, and contact topology requirements. The proposed antenna achieves an improvement of up to 40\% in power transfer efficiency compared to traditional bow-tie antennas under realistic operating conditions. High-fidelity electromagnetic simulations validate these results, confirming the design's practicality for THz applications. This work addresses critical limitations of existing antenna designs and advances the feasibility of high-frequency applications in both communication and sensing.

Title: Interpretable SHAP-bounded Bayesian Optimization for Underwater Acoustic Metamaterial Coating Design
Authors: Hansani Weeratunge, Dominic Robe, Elnaz Hajizadeh
Abstract: We developed an interpretability informed Bayesian optimization framework to optimize underwater acoustic coatings based on polyurethane elastomers with embedded metamaterial features. A data driven model was employed to analyze the relationship between acoustic performance, specifically sound absorption and the corresponding design variables. By leveraging SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), a machine learning interpretability tool, we identified the key parameters influencing the objective function and gained insights into how these parameters affect sound absorption. The insights derived from the SHAP analysis were subsequently used to automatically refine the bounds of the optimization problem automatically, enabling a more targeted and efficient exploration of the design space. The proposed approach was applied to two polyurethane materials with distinct hardness levels, resulting in improved optimal solutions compared to those obtained without SHAP-informed guidance. Notably, these enhancements were achieved without increasing the number of simulation iterations. Our findings demonstrate the potential of SHAP to streamline optimization processes by uncovering hidden parameter relationships and guiding the search toward promising regions of the design space. This work underscores the effectiveness of combining interpretability techniques with Bayesian optimization for the efficient and cost-effective design of underwater acoustic metamaterials under strict computational constraints and can be generalized towards other materials and engineering optimization problems.

Title: Interplay between defects and the non-Hermitian skin effect
Authors: Yin Huang, Wenna Zhang, Yu Zhou, Yuecheng Shen, Georgios Veronis, Wenchen Luo
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) is an intriguing phenomenon in which an extensive number of bulk eigenstates localize at the boundaries of a non-Hermitian system with non-reciprocal hoppings. Here we study the interplay of this effect and a defect in non-reciprocal one-dimensional lattices. We show that the interplay of the NHSE and defects is size-dependent. We demonstrate a novel class of hybrid skin-defect states in finite-size systems resulting from the coupling between the skin and defect states. Next, we consider a single defect in a topologically nontrivial lattice with time-reversal symmetry based on the non-reciprocal Su-Schrieffer-Heeger configuration. We unveil how topologically nontrivial defect states and non-Hermiticity interplay by competing with each other, exhibiting a transition from topologically nontrivial defect states to skin states. In addition, we show that decreasing the defect strength can result in a transition from trivial defect states to skin states. Our work promotes the understanding of the interplay between defects and the NHSE, and especially the importance of the energy spectra of the system with the defect under periodic boundary conditions.

Title: On the validity of the complex Langevin method near the deconfining phase transition in QCD at finite density
Authors: Shoichiro Tsutsui, Yuhma Asano, Yuta Ito, Hideo Matsufuru, Yusuke Namekawa, Jun Nishimura, Shinji Shimasaki, Asato Tsuchiya
Abstract: In our previous paper [JHEP 10 (2020) 144], we found that the complex Langevin (CL) method works for QCD at finite density on the $16^3 \times 32$ lattice in the low-temperature high-density regime within the range $\mu / T = 1.6 - 9.6$ with $\mu$ and $T$ being the quark chemical potential and the temperature, which enabled us to see a clear trend towards the formation of the Fermi sphere. Here we investigate the validity of the CL method on the $24^3 \times 12$ lattice in the deconfined phase near the deconfinement phase transition. As before, we use four-flavor staggered fermions and judge the validity using the criterion based on the probability distribution of the drift term. The spatial extent is $L = (1.3 - 2.7 {\rm ~fm} )> \Lambda_{\rm LQCD}^{-1} \sim 1{\rm ~fm}$, in contrast to our previous study with $L < \Lambda_{\rm LQCD}^{-1}$. We find that the CL method works in a broad region up to $\mu / T = 4.8$, while it starts to fail as we approach the phase boundary due to the singular drift problem, which can be understood qualitatively by extending the Banks-Casher relation to the case at finite density.

Title: Identifying optimal magnetic field configurations for decoherence mitigation of boron vacancies in hexagonal boron nitride
Authors: Basanta Mistri, Saksham Mahajan, Felix Donaldson, Rama K. Kamineni, Siddharth Dhomkar
Abstract: The negatively charged boron vacancy center in 2D hexagonal boron nitride has emerged as a promising quantum sensor. However, its sensitivity is constrained due to ubiquitous nuclear spins in the environment. The nuclear spins, hyperfine coupled with the central electron spin, effectively behave as magnetic field fluctuators, leading to rapid decoherence. Here, we explore the effectiveness of static magnetic field strength and orientation in realizing peculiar subspaces that can lead to enhanced spin coherence. Specifically, using detailed numerical simulations of the spin Hamiltonian, we identify specific field configurations that minimize energy gradients and, consequently, are expected to facilitate decoherence suppression. We also develop an approximate analytical model based on the perturbation theory that accurately predicts these low-gradient subspaces for magnetic fields aligned with the electron spin quantization axis, applicable not only to boron vacancies but to any spin-1 electronic system coupled to nearby nuclear spins. Furthermore, to stimulate experimental validation, we estimate coherence lifetimes as a function of various bias field configurations and demonstrate that significant decoherence suppression can indeed be achieved in certain regions. These findings and the developed methodology offer valuable insights for mitigating decoherence in a low-field regime.

Title: Geometry of Learning -- L2 Phase Transitions in Deep and Shallow Neural Networks
Authors: Ibrahim Talha Ersoy, Karoline Wiesner
Abstract: When neural networks (NNs) are subject to L2 regularization, increasing the regularization strength beyond a certain threshold pushes the model into an under-parameterization regime. This transition manifests as a first-order phase transition in single-hidden-layer NNs and a second-order phase transition in NNs with two or more hidden layers. This paper establishes a unified framework for such transitions by integrating the Ricci curvature of the loss landscape with regularizer-driven deep learning. First, we show that a curvature change-point separates the model-accuracy regimes in the onset of learning and that it is identical to the critical point of the phase transition driven by regularization. Second, we show that for more complex data sets additional phase transitions exist between model accuracies, and that they are again identical to curvature change points in the error landscape. Third, by studying the MNIST data set using a Variational Autoencoder, we demonstrate that the curvature change points identify phase transitions in model accuracy outside the L2 setting. Our framework also offers practical insights for optimizing model performance across various architectures and datasets. By linking geometric features of the error landscape to observable phase transitions, our work paves the way for more informed regularization strategies and potentially new methods for probing the intrinsic structure of neural networks beyond the L2 context.

Title: Spatially Structured Flocking in a Proliferating Population of Self-Propelled Organisms without Explicit Alignment Interactions
Authors: Seiya Takamura, Nen Saito
Abstract: While it is well established that self-propelled particles with alignment interactions can exhibit orientational order, the impact of self-replication and annihilation, which are key characteristics in cellular systems, on spatiotemporal order remains poorly understood. To explore the interplay between self-propulsion and self-replication, we introduce the active Brownian bug (ABB) model, in which self-propelled agents undergo stochastic, density-dependent replication and constant-rate death. Despite the absence of alignment interactions, the system exhibits flocking behavior characterized by high orientational order, while maintaining ordered hexagonal arrays. This emergent order arises from stochastic birth and death processes, offering a novel mechanism for flocking in proliferating cellular populations.

Title: Chern character and Fermi point
Authors: Kyouhei Horie
Abstract: This paper expresses the Chern character for topological K-theory based on the formulation of the family of Fredholm operators, by using the points at which the Fredholm operator becomes singular (Fermi points). In particular, we explain that the odd Chern character can be thought of as a generalization of the spectral flow. As applications, we give elementary proofs of the evenness of the edge index and the bulk-edge correspondence for four-dimensional topological insulators with time-reversal symmetry of class AI.

Title: Test of Quantum Gravity in Optical Magnetometers
Authors: Mitja Fridman, James Maldaner, Gil Porat, Saurya Das
Abstract: In this work, quantum gravity effects, which can potentially be measured in magnetometers through the Larmor frequency of atoms in an external magnetic field, are estimated. It is shown that the thermal motion of atoms can, in principle, produce measurable quantum gravity effects, given the precision of modern magnetometers. If the particle velocities are caused by some other mechanism, such as convection, it is shown that the quantum gravity effects may be observed with the magnetometer's proposed detection threshold. An actual state-of-the-art optical magnetometer experiment is being designed to search for these effects and is described in a companion paper by Maldaner et al. (2023) [1].

Title: Functional renormalization group equations for antisymmetric tensor field models at finite temperature
Authors: Georgii Kalagov
Abstract: Within the framework of the functional renormalization group, we derived the flow equations for the scale-dependent effective action at finite temperature for models involving an antisymmetric rank-2 tensor field. The analysis focuses on scenarios where the vacuum expectation value emerges due to symmetry breaking patterns, specifically $SU(n) \to USp(n)$ and $SO(n) \to SU(n/2)$. The derived equations provide insights into the behavior of these models under varying scales and temperatures, contributing to the understanding of phase transitions in systems with complex symmetry structures.

Title: Surface tension estimation of bubble nuclei in magma using spinodal pressure and nonclassical nucleation theory
Authors: Mizuki Nishiwaki
Abstract: Efforts to estimate the magma decompression rate from the vesicular texture of volcanic products have progressed through the development of theoretical models and laboratory experiments. The theoretical model is based on nucleation theory, with the surface tension between the melt and bubble nucleus being the parameter that most strongly governs nucleation. Since direct estimation of surface tension is difficult, it has been calculated by inverting the bubble number density (BND) from experimental samples using classical or nonclassical nucleation theory formulas. However, in the nonclassical case, which accounts for the supersaturation dependence of surface tension, the pressure at the spinodal limit (where surface tension becomes zero) was previously unknown, necessitating complex mathematical operations. In this study, the spinodal pressure determined from the Gibbs energy curve was substituted into the nonclassical formula by approximating the water-saturated silicate melt as a two-component symmetric regular solution composed of silicate and water. This approach allowed for a more straightforward estimation of surface tension using data from past decompression experiments. Nevertheless, the resulting surface tension values were more scattered than those obtained using the classical formula, suggesting that applying the nonclassical formula to magma vesiculation is not valid at present. Resolving this issue will likely require an integrated understanding of the dependence of surface tension on both supersaturation and bubble radius. Such understanding would enable more accurate estimation of surface tension and contribute to reconciling the discrepancy between theoretical and experimental BND values.

Title: Learning curves theory for hierarchically compositional data with power-law distributed features
Authors: Francesco Cagnetta, Hyunmo Kang, Matthieu Wyart
Abstract: Recent theories suggest that Neural Scaling Laws arise whenever the task is linearly decomposed into power-law distributed units. Alternatively, scaling laws also emerge when data exhibit a hierarchically compositional structure, as is thought to occur in language and images. To unify these views, we consider classification and next-token prediction tasks based on probabilistic context-free grammars -- probabilistic models that generate data via a hierarchy of production rules. For classification, we show that having power-law distributed production rules results in a power-law learning curve with an exponent depending on the rules' distribution and a large multiplicative constant that depends on the hierarchical structure. By contrast, for next-token prediction, the distribution of production rules controls the local details of the learning curve, but not the exponent describing the large-scale behaviour.

Title: Scaling Laws and Representation Learning in Simple Hierarchical Languages: Transformers vs. Convolutional Architectures
Authors: Francesco Cagnetta, Alessandro Favero, Antonio Sclocchi, Matthieu Wyart
Abstract: How do neural language models acquire a language's structure when trained for next-token prediction? We address this question by deriving theoretical scaling laws for neural network performance on synthetic datasets generated by the Random Hierarchy Model (RHM) -- an ensemble of probabilistic context-free grammars designed to capture the hierarchical structure of natural language while remaining analytically tractable. Previously, we developed a theory of representation learning based on data correlations that explains how deep learning models capture the hierarchical structure of the data sequentially, one layer at a time. Here, we extend our theoretical framework to account for architectural differences. In particular, we predict and empirically validate that convolutional networks, whose structure aligns with that of the generative process through locality and weight sharing, enjoy a faster scaling of performance compared to transformer models, which rely on global self-attention mechanisms. This finding clarifies the architectural biases underlying neural scaling laws and highlights how representation learning is shaped by the interaction between model architecture and the statistical properties of data.

Title: Resonant Self-Diffraction of Femtosecond Extreme Ultraviolet Pulses in Cobalt

Nelson, Ettore Paltanin, Jacopo Stefano Pelli-Cresi, Vincent Polewczyk, Dmitriy Ksenzov, Filippo Bencivenga
Abstract: Self-diffraction is a non-collinear four-wave mixing technique well-known in optics. We explore self-diffraction in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) range, taking advantage of intense femtosecond EUV pulses produced by a free electron laser. Two pulses are crossed in a thin cobalt film and their interference results in a spatially periodic electronic excitation. The diffraction of one of the same pulses by the associated refractive index modulation is measured as a function of the EUV wavelength. A sharp peak in the self-diffraction efficiency is observed at the M$_{2,3}$ absorption edge of cobalt at 59 eV and a fine structure is found above the edge. The results are compared with a theoretical model assuming that the excitation results in an increase of the electronic temperature. EUV self-diffraction offers a potentially useful spectroscopy tool and will be instrumental in studying coherent effects in the EUV range.

Title: Enhancement of photon emission rate near QCD critical point
Authors: Yukinao Akamatsu, Masayuki Asakawa, Masaru Hongo, Mikhail Stephanov, Ho-Ung Yee
Abstract: We compute photon emission rate enhancement near the QCD critical point using an effective theory of dynamic critical phenomena and derive a universal photon spectrum. The emission rate scales similarly to conductivity, increasing with the correlation length ($\xi$), diverging at the critical point. The spectrum exhibits $\omega dN_{\gamma}/d^3k \propto \omega^{-1/2}$ in the scaling regime, with the transition occurring at a frequency comparable to shear damping rate $\omega \sim \gamma_{\eta}/\xi^2$, reflecting the nonequilibrium properties of the near-critical liquid.

Title: Compression, Regularity, Randomness and Emergent Structure: Rethinking Physical Complexity in the Data-Driven Era
Authors: Nima Dehghani
Abstract: Complexity science offers a wide range of measures for quantifying unpredictability, structure, and information. Yet, a systematic conceptual organization of these measures is still missing. We present a unified framework that locates statistical, algorithmic, and dynamical measures along three axes (regularity, randomness, and complexity) and situates them in a common conceptual space. We map statistical, algorithmic, and dynamical measures into this conceptual space, discussing their computational accessibility and approximability. This taxonomy reveals the deep challenges posed by uncomputability and highlights the emergence of modern data-driven methods (including autoencoders, latent dynamical models, symbolic regression, and physics-informed neural networks) as pragmatic approximations to classical complexity ideals. Latent spaces emerge as operational arenas where regularity extraction, noise management, and structured compression converge, bridging theoretical foundations with practical modeling in high-dimensional systems. We close by outlining implications for physics-informed AI and AI-guided discovery in complex physical systems, arguing that classical questions of complexity remain central to next-generation scientific modeling.

Title: Unraveling Exciton Trap Dynamics and Nonradiative Loss Pathways in Quantum Dots via Atomistic Simulations
Authors: Bokang Hou, Salvatore Gatto, Samuel L. Rudge, Johan E. Runeson, Michael Thoss, Eran Rabani
Abstract: Surface defects in colloidal quantum dots are a major source of nonradiative losses, yet the microscopic mechanisms underlying exciton trapping and recombination remain elusive. Here, we develop a model Hamiltonian based on atomistic electronic calculations to investigate exciton dynamics in CdSe/CdS core/shell QDs containing a single hole trap introduced by an unpassivated sulfur atom. By systematically varying the defect depth and reorganization energy, we uncover how defect-induced excitonic states mediate energy relaxation pathways. Our simulations reveal that a single localized defect can induce a rich spectrum of excitonic states, leading to multiple dynamical regimes, from slow, energetically off-resonant trapping to fast, cascaded relaxation through in-gap defect states. Crucially, we quantify how defect-induced polaron shifts and exciton-phonon couplings govern the balance between efficient radiative emission and rapid nonradiative decay. These insights clarify the microscopic origin of defect-assisted loss channels and suggest pathways for tailoring QD optoelectronic properties via surface and defect engineering.

Title: Alcohol induced surface charging of colloidal quantum dots for controllable electrophoretic deposition processing
Authors: Jiaming Su, Kai Gu, Qingchen Wang, Kaiying Min, Zhiyuan Gao, Haizheng Zhong
Abstract: In this work, we report an alcohol-induced surface charging route of colloidal QDs to achieve controllable electrophoretic deposition processing. By adding a fixed amounts of alcohols into a preformed quantum dots solution in non-polar solvents, the colloidal quantum dots can be positively charged, and then deposited on negative electrode under applied electric field. The surface charging of PbSe quantum dots was investigated by zeta potential, nuclear magnetic resonance, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and discrete Fourier transform calculations. It was found that the zeta potential of oleate acid capped PbSe QDs increases from +1.6 mV to +13.4 mV with the amount of alcohol solvent increasing. The alcohol-induced zeta potential increasing can be explained to the electron cloud shift of active hydrogen mediated by intermolecular hydrogen bonds between carboxy acid and alcohol. Considering the influence of surface charging of quantum dots on their dispersibility, we describe the microscopic mechanism of alcohol-induced electrophoretic deposition processing. Furthermore, we developed a size-selective separation protocol by controlling alcohol-induced electrophoretic deposition processing.

Title: Analytical gradients of random-phase approximation plus corrections from renormalized single excitations
Authors: Muhammad N. Tahir, Honghui Shang, Xinguo Ren
Abstract: The random-phase approximation (RPA) formulated within the adiabatic connection fluctuation-dissipation framework is a powerful approach to compute the ground-state energies and properties of molecules and materials. Its overall underbinding behavior can be effectively mitigated by a simple correction term, called renormalized single excitation (rSE) correction. Analytical gradient calculations of the RPA energy have become increasingly available, enabling structural relaxations and even molecular dynamics at the RPA level. However, such calculations at the RPA+rSE level have not been reported, due to the lack of the rSE analytical gradient. Here, we present the first formulation and implementation of the analytical gradients of the rSE energy with respect to the nuclear coordinates within an atomic-orbital basis set framework, which allows us to assess the performance of RPA+rSE in determining the molecular geometries and energetics. It is found that the slight overestimation behavior of RPA for small covalently bonded molecules is strengthened by rSE, while such behavior for molecules bonded with purely dispersion interactions is corrected. We further applied the approach to the water clusters, and found that the energy difference between the low-energy isomers of water hexamers is almost unchanged when going from RPA to RPA+rSE geometries. For the bigger WATER27 test set, using the RPA+rSE geometries instead of the RPA ones leads to a slight reduction of the mean absolute error of RPA+rSE from 0.91 kcal/mol to 0.70 kcal/mol, at the complete basis set.

Title: Single-atom imaging of ${}^{173}$Yb in optical tweezers loaded by a five-beam magneto-optical trap
Authors: Omar Abdel Karim, Alessandro Muzi Falconi, Riccardo Panza, Wenliang Liu, Francesco Scazza
Abstract: We report on the trapping and imaging of individual ytterbium atoms in arrays of optical tweezers, loaded from a magneto-optical trap (MOT) formed by only five beams in an orthogonal configuration. In our five-beam MOT, operating on the narrow ${}^1$S${}_0 \rightarrow {}^3$P${}_1$ intercombination transition, gravity balances the radiation pressure of a single upward-directed beam. This approach enables efficient trapping and cooling of the most common ytterbium isotopes (${}^{171}$Yb, ${}^{173}$Yb and ${}^{174}$Yb) to $\lesssim 20\,\mu$K at densities $\sim 10^{11}$ atoms/cm$^3$ within less than one second. This configuration allows for significantly reducing the complexity of the optical setup, potentially benefiting any ytterbium-atom based quantum science platform leveraging single-atom microscopy, from quantum processors to novel optical clocks. We then demonstrate the first single-atom-resolved imaging of the fermionic, large-spin isotope ${}^{173}$Yb ($I=5/2$), employing a two-color imaging scheme that does not rely on magic-wavelength trapping. We achieve a high single-atom imaging fidelity of $99.96(1)\%$ and a large survival probability of $98.5(2)\%$, despite large differential light shifts affecting all nuclear spin sublevels of the excited ${}^3$P${}_1$ state involved in the cooling transition. The demonstrated capabilities will play a key role in future quantum simulations and computing applications with ${}^{173}$Yb arrays.

Title: On the internal architecture of lightweight negative Poisson's ratio (auxetic) metastructures: a review
Authors: Ali Rahimi-Lenji, Mohammad Heidari-Rarani, Mohsen Mirkhalaf, Mohammad Mirkhalaf
Abstract: Development of lightweight materials with enhanced mechanical properties has been a long-standing challenge in science and engineering. Lightweight auxetic metastructures (AMSs) provide attractive solutions to this problem. AMSs' negative Poisson's ratio is a unique characteristic which results in very interesting practical properties such as high energy absorption and improved toughness. Different properties of metastrcutures, including anisotropy, are dependent, in addition to their original material, on the unit cell shape and geometrical features which have very high variations. Over the past few years, researchers have developed AMSs with various unit cells, either introducing new internal architecture or enhancing and optimizing the existing ones. Despite the progress made in this field, there is no comprehensive review of the AMS unit cells. This review describes the cellular AMSs associated with a classified set of metastructures, comprising more than 100 distinct auxetic repetitive unit cells. Besides, achievable range of negative Poisson's ratios are provided for different categories of AMSs. Finally, the future perspective of the research field and potential developments and applications in this field are discussed.

Title: Prethermal discrete time crystals in one-dimensional classical Floquet systems with nearest-neighbor interactions
Authors: Zhuo-Yi Li, Yu-Ran Zhang
Abstract: Prethermal discrete time crystals (PDTCs), an emergent non-equilibrium phase of matter, have been studied in two- and higher-dimensional lattices with nearest-neighbor (NN) interactions and one-dimensional (1D) lattices with long-range interactions. However, different from prethermalization that can be observed in 1D Floquet classical spin systems with NN interactions, classical PDTCs in Floquet 1D systems with only NN interactions have not been proposed before. Here, we demonstrate the emergence of disorder-free PDTCs in 1D Floquet classic spin systems with NN interactions. We show that the thermalization time grows exponentially as the driving frequency increases and depends on the energy density of the initial state, which are two key signatures of PDTCs. The robustness of 1D classical PDTC order is verified by introducing imperfect spin flip operations. The emergence of 1D classical PDTCs can be explained by mapping the 1D classical spin chain with NN interacting to a quantum spin-half system with effective long-range interactions. Our work provides an exploration of quantum characteristics, when considering the classical counterparts of quantum phenomena, and will be helpful for further investigations of both classical and quantum prethermal systems and discrete time-crystalline order.

Title: Optimizing Machine Learning Potentials for Hydroxide Transport: Surprising Efficiency of Single-Concentration Training
Authors: Jonas Hänseroth, Christian Dreßler
Abstract: We investigate the transferability of machine learning interatomic potentials across concentration variations in chemically similar systems, using aqueous potassium hydroxide solutions as a case study. Despite containing identical chemical species (K$^+$, OH$^-$, H$_2$O) across all concentrations, models fine-tuned on specific KOH concentrations exhibit surprisingly poor transferability to others, with force prediction errors increasing dramatically from ~30 meV/A (at training concentration) to ~90 meV/A (at very different concentrations). This reveals a critical limitation when applying such models beyond their training domain, even within chemically homogeneous systems. We demonstrate that strategic selection of training data can substantially overcome these limitations without requiring extensive computational resources. Models fine-tuned on intermediate concentrations (6.26 mol/L) exhibit remarkable transferability across the entire concentration spectrum (0.56-17.98 mol/L), often outperforming more computationally expensive models trained on multiple concentration datasets. This approach enables accurate simulation of hydroxide transport dynamics across varying electrolyte conditions while maintaining near-quantum accuracy. Our simulations further reveal the emergence of hydroxide-hydroxide hydrogen bonding at high concentrations - a phenomenon not explicitly represented in dilute training data but successfully captured by our intermediate-concentration model. This work establishes practical guidelines for developing broadly applicable machine learning force fields with optimal transferability, challenging the assumption that diverse training datasets are always necessary for robust performance in similar chemical environments.

Title: Second-gradient models for incompressible viscous fluids and associated cylindrical flows
Authors: C. Balitactac, C. Rodriguez
Abstract: We introduce second-gradient models for incompressible viscous fluids, building on the framework introduced by Fried and Gurtin. We propose a new and simple constitutive relation for the hyperpressure to ensure that the models are both physically meaningful and mathematically well-posed. The framework is further extended to incorporate pressure-dependent viscosities. We show that for the pressure-dependent viscosity model, the inclusion of second-gradient effects guarantees the ellipticity of the governing pressure equation, in contrast to previous models rooted in classical continuum mechanics. The constant viscosity model is applied to steady cylindrical flows, where explicit solutions are derived under both strong and weak adherence boundary conditions. In each case, we establish convergence of the velocity profiles to the classical Navier-Stokes solutions as the model's characteristic length scales tend to zero.

Title: Flowing from the Ising Model on the Fuzzy Sphere to the 3D Lee-Yang CFT
Authors: Joan Elias Miro, Olivier Delouche
Abstract: We employ the Fuzzy Sphere regulator to study the 3D Lee-Yang CFT. The model is defined by deforming the Ising model on the Fuzzy Sphere via a purely imaginary longitudinal magnetic field. This model undergoes a quantum phase transition, whose critical point we determine and identify with the 3D Lee-Yang CFT. We show how to tune the model and find that the lowest-lying states of the Hamiltonian align well with the expected CFT spectrum. We discuss the Fuzzy Sphere estimates for the scaling dimension $\Delta_\phi$ of the lowest primary operator. Finally, we interpret small deviations from the CFT expectations in terms of the leading irrelevant operators of the Lee-Yang CFT. We show that the Fuzzy Sphere calculations are compatible with the best five-loop $\epsilon$-expansion estimates.

Authors: Luis A. Martinez, Nick Du, Nicholas Materise, Sean O' Kelley, Xian Wu, Gang Qiu, Kang L. Wang, P. Gianpaolo, Tony Low, Dong-Xia Qu
Abstract: Integrated plasmonics is advancing rapidly, enabling a wide range of functionalities to be incorporated onto a single chip. Applications span information processing, computation, quantum sensing, and dark-matter detection. This progress has driven the development of integrated non-reciprocal devices, which are essential for preventing unwanted feedback that can degrade system performance. While non-reciprocal devices have been realized in edge magnetoplasmon materials via classical interference effects, their operation is often complicated by a dependence on input power. Here, we demonstrate that topological circulators utilizing asymmetric coupling offer improved input power range, isolation, and insertion loss. In this configuration, non-reciprocal behavior arises from the coupling between a chiral edge magnetoplasmonic resonator and LC resonators, leading to non-Hermitian dynamics. The coherent photon-plasmon interaction enables a circulator with up to 50 dB of isolation across a broad range of excitation intensities. This is the first experimental demonstration showing that magnetic topological insulators can support the study of chiral plasmonic cavity quantum electrodynamics at radio frequencies, underscoring their potential to enable chip-scale quantum-classical interfaces in superconducting quantum information processing systems.

Title: Analytic theory of dropout regularization
Authors: Francesco Mori, Francesca Mignacco
Abstract: Dropout is a regularization technique widely used in training artificial neural networks to mitigate overfitting. It consists of dynamically deactivating subsets of the network during training to promote more robust representations. Despite its widespread adoption, dropout probabilities are often selected heuristically, and theoretical explanations of its success remain sparse. Here, we analytically study dropout in two-layer neural networks trained with online stochastic gradient descent. In the high-dimensional limit, we derive a set of ordinary differential equations that fully characterize the evolution of the network during training and capture the effects of dropout. We obtain a number of exact results describing the generalization error and the optimal dropout probability at short, intermediate, and long training times. Our analysis shows that dropout reduces detrimental correlations between hidden nodes, mitigates the impact of label noise, and that the optimal dropout probability increases with the level of noise in the data. Our results are validated by extensive numerical simulations.

Title: Mixed state deep thermalization
Authors: Xie-Hang Yu, Wen Wei Ho, Pavel Kos
Abstract: We introduce the notion of the mixed state projected ensemble (MSPE), a collection of mixed states describing a local region of a quantum many-body system, conditioned upon measurements of the complementary region which are incomplete. This constitutes a generalization of the pure state projected ensemble in which measurements are assumed ideal and complete, and which has been shown to tend towards limiting pure state distributions depending only on symmetries of the system, thus representing a new kind of universality in quantum equilibration dubbed deep thermalization. We study the MSPE generated by solvable (1+1)d dual-unitary quantum circuit evolution, and identify the limiting mixed state distributions which emerge at late times depending on the size of the incomplete measurement, which we assume to be lossy, finding that they correspond to certain random density matrix ensembles known in the literature. We also derive the rate of the emergence of such universality. Furthermore, we investigate the quantum information properties of the states composing the ensemble, specifically their capacity to teleport quantum information between the ends of the system. The teleportation fidelity is upper bounded by the quantum conditional entropy, which we find exhibits a sharp transition from zero to maximal when the number of measurements lost matches of that the number of degrees of freedom to be teleported. Our results initiate the first investigation of deep thermalization for mixed state ensembles, which are relevant for present-day quantum simulation experiments wherein measurements are typically not perfect, and also amount to a physical and natural way of sampling from hitherto abstract random density matrix ensembles.

Title: Revisiting the Exact Dynamical Structure Factor of the Heisenberg Antiferromagnetic Model
Authors: A.H. Bougourzi
Abstract: We revisit our initial derivations of the exact 2-spinon $S_2$ and 4-spinon $S_4$ dynamical structure factors (DSF). First we show that the latter derivations had normalization factors that are twice and quadriple the correct ones respectively. This means that $S_2$ contributes not 72% as was previously thought but 36% to the total DSF. We also calculated the contribution of $S_4$ to be between 18% and 20% and not 27% as was calculated by Caux and Hagemans. In fact we show that the latter reference had also the normalization factor twice the correct value and had it done the numeric integrations correctly it would have obtained a contribution between 36% and 40% for $S_4$. Furthermore, we prove that its claim that our initial derivation of $S_4$ was also incorrect in its dependency on the spectral parameters is incorrect because fixing the momentun transfer $k$ up to $2\pi$ as the latter reference did to justify its claim only amounts to mutltiplying the overall factor by 2 because as we will prove in this paper $S_4$ is periodic in $k$ with period $2\pi$. Also in this paper we derive $S_n$ for general $n$ by following a different approach compared to our initial derivation of $S_4$. Although for $S_4$ both the new derivation and the initial one lead to equivalent formulas that are expressed differently, the new form presented in this paper is much more elegant and compact and also reveals new hidden and nontrivial symmetries which substantially simplify the numeric evaluation of $S_4$ and its sum rules. Moreover based on the results of this paper we propose a simple approximation to the total DSF of the Heisenberg model. Finally we comment on how our work might resolve the discrepancy between the exact theoretic results and experiemntal data as reported by Zaliznyak et al.

Title: New experimental evidence for Podkletnov effect
Authors: A.V. Fetisov
Abstract: In the works of E. Podkletnov et al. (for example [Physica C: Superconductivity, 1992, Vol. 203, p. 441]), a unique experiment is described in which a significant reduction in the weight of various test bodies was observed when placed above a rotating disk made of the superconductor YBa2Cu3O6+delta (YBCO); the disk was in the superconducting state (at 20-70 K) and was subjected to an alternating (50 Hz-100 MHz) magnetic field. Numerous attempts to replicate this experiment in other laboratories have been unsuccessful; however, a broad discussion has been initiated regarding the possible nature of the "Podkletnov effect" - the weight loss of objects located above the superconductor. In the present experimental work, results similar to the Podkletnov effect have been obtained, which, however, occur at room temperature. During our experiments, gas-tight containers with the crystal hydrate K2CO3X1.5H2O and dispersed YBCO exhibited a sharp loss of part of their weight during and after 0.5 hours of exposure to a magnetic field with a frequency of 50 MHz. Changes in the weight of various test bodies located in close proximity to the containers were recorded. It was found that these weight changes correlate with the external surface area of the bodies and do not depend on their chemical nature. A dependence of the magnitude of weight changes on the oxygen content in YBCO was obtained, which shows a significant dip in the region where superstructural orderings of the oxygen sublattice exist in the basal plane. This dip coincides in shape with the well-known dip in the dependence of Tc on delta (the "60-K plateau"). The possible connection between these two extraordinary phenomena coexisting in YBCO compounds - inexplicable weight changes and high-temperature superconductivity - is discussed.

Title: Observation of Nagaoka Polarons in a Fermi-Hubbard Quantum Simulator
Authors: Martin Lebrat, Muqing Xu, Lev Haldar Kendrick, Anant Kale, Youqi Gang, Pranav Seetharaman, Ivan Morera, Ehsan Khatami, Eugene Demler, Markus Greiner
Abstract: Quantum interference can deeply alter the nature of many-body phases of matter. In the paradigmatic case of the Hubbard model, Nagaoka famously proved that introducing a single itinerant charge can transform a paramagnetic insulator into a ferromagnet through path interference. However, a microscopic observation of such kinetic magnetism induced by individually imaged dopants has been so far elusive. Here we demonstrate the emergence of Nagaoka polarons in a Hubbard system realized with strongly interacting fermions in a triangular optical lattice. Using quantum gas microscopy, we reveal these polarons as extended ferromagnetic bubbles around particle dopants arising from the local interplay of coherent dopant motion and spin exchange. In contrast, kinetic frustration due to the triangular geometry promotes antiferromagnetic polarons around hole dopants, as proposed by Haerter and Shastry. Our work augurs the exploration of exotic quantum phases driven by charge motion in strongly correlated systems and over sizes that are challenging for numerical simulation.

Title: Free-energy estimates from nonequilibrium trajectories under varying-temperature protocols
Authors: Stephen Whitelam
Abstract: The Jarzynski equality allows the calculation of free-energy differences using values of work measured from nonequilibrium trajectories. The number of trajectories required to accurately estimate free-energy differences in this way grows sharply with the size of work fluctuations, motivating the search for protocols that perform desired transformations with minimum work. However, protocols of this nature can involve varying temperature, to which the Jarzynski equality does not apply. We derive a variant of the Jarzynski equality that applies to varying-temperature protocols, and show that it can have better convergence properties than the standard version of the equality. We derive this modified equality, and the associated fluctuation relation, within the framework of Markovian stochastic dynamics, complementing related derivations done within the framework of Hamiltonian dynamics.

Title: First-Passage Time for Upper Bounds on Fluctuations of Trajectory Observables
Authors: V. V. Ryazanov
Abstract: General upper bounds on fluctuations of trajectory observables were recently obtained. It turned out that the size of fluctuations of dynamical observable is limited from below and from above. For the moment generating function of general upper bounds on the size of fluctuations, the moments (average value and variance) of the size of fluctuations are obtained. A more complex and interesting task is to obtain the first-passage time for process of upper bounds on the moments and first-passage time (FPT) of the observable A, which are obtained by calculating the moments and FPT of the process of upper bound. Characteristic functions, average values and variances of the first-passage time of reaching fluctuations of observables of the trajectory of the Markov chain of positive and negative levels are also obtained. Some general issues of the relationship between the theory of random processes (using the example of the risk theory used) and thermodynamics of trajectories are also considered.

Title: Normal weak eigenstate thermalization
Authors: Patrycja Łydżba, Rafał Świętek, Marcin Mierzejewski, Marcos Rigol, Lev Vidmar
Abstract: Eigenstate thermalization has been numerically shown to occur for few-body observables in a wide range of nonintegrable models. For intensive sums of few-body observables, a weaker version of eigenstate thermalization known as weak eigenstate thermalization has been proved to occur in general. Here, we unveil a stricter weak eigenstate thermalization phenomenon that occurs in quadratic models exhibiting quantum chaos in the single-particle sector (quantum-chaotic quadratic models) and in integrable interacting models. In such models, we argue that few-body observables that have a properly defined system-size independent norm are guaranteed to exhibit at least a polynomially vanishing variance (over the entire many-body energy spectrum) of the diagonal matrix elements, a phenomenon we dub normal weak eigenstate thermalization. We prove that normal weak eigenstate thermalization is a consequence of single-particle eigenstate thermalization, i.e., it can be viewed as a manifestation of quantum chaos at the single-particle level. We report numerical evidence of normal weak eigenstate thermalization for quantum-chaotic quadratic models such as the three-dimensional Anderson model in the delocalized regime and the power-law random banded matrix model, as well as for the integrable interacting spin-1/2 XYZ and XXZ models.

Title: Ferrimagnetism of ultracold fermions in a multi-band Hubbard system
Authors: Martin Lebrat, Anant Kale, Lev Haldar Kendrick, Muqing Xu, Youqi Gang, Alexander Nikolaenko, Pietro M. Bonetti, Subir Sachdev, Markus Greiner
Abstract: Strongly correlated materials feature multiple electronic orbitals which are crucial to accurately understand their many-body properties, from cuprate materials to twisted bilayer graphene. In such multi-band models, quantum interference can lead to dispersionless bands whose large degeneracy gives rise to itinerant magnetism even with weak interactions. Here, we report on signatures of a ferrimagnetic state realized in a Lieb lattice at half-filling, characterized by antialigned magnetic moments with antiferromagnetic correlations, concomitant with a finite spin polarization. We demonstrate their robustness when increasing repulsive interactions from the non-interacting to the Heisenberg regime, and study their emergence when continuously tuning the lattice unit cell from a square to a Lieb geometry. Our work paves the way towards exploring exotic phases in related multi-orbital models such as quantum spin liquids in kagome lattices and heavy fermion behavior in Kondo models.

Title: Fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect in a singular flat band
Authors: Wenqi Yang, Dawei Zhai, Tixuan Tan, Feng-Ren Fan, Zuzhang Lin, Wang Yao
Abstract: In the search of fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) effect, the conventional wisdom is to start from a flat Chern band isolated from the rest of the Hilbert space by band gaps, so that many-body interaction can be projected to a landscape that mimics a Landau level. Singular flat bands (SFB), which share protected touching points with other dispersive bands, represent another type of flat landscapes differing from Landau levels and Chern bands in topological and geometric properties. Here we report the finding of FQAH phases in a SFB, which emerges in the bipartite limit of the nearest-neighbor tight-binding model of twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$. At 1/3 and 2/3 filling of the SFB, FQAH effects are demonstrated using density matrix renormalisation group calculations with all bands, as well as exact diagonalization calculations with the two touching bands. Gapping the band touching can turn the SFB into a nearly flat Chern band, but counter-intuitively this suppresses the FQAH effect, as the gap opening introduces strong inhomogeneity to the quantum geometry. An optical scheme to realize such SFB for cold atoms is provided. Our findings uncover a new arena for the exploration of fractional quantum Hall physics beyond the Landau level and Chern insulator paradigms.

Title: Timescales and necessary conditions for hydrodynamization in one-dimensional Bose gases
Authors: Yicheng Zhang, Yuan Le, David S. Weiss, Marcos Rigol
Abstract: We study the quantum evolution of one-dimensional Bose gases immediately after several variants of high-energy quenches, both theoretically and experimentally. Using the advantages conveyed by the relative simplicity of these nearly integrable many-body systems, we are able to differentiate the behaviors of two distinct but often temporally overlapping processes, hydrodynamization and local prethermalization. We show that the hydrodynamization epoch is itself characterized by two independent timescales, an oscillation period and an observable-dependent damping time. We also show how the existence of a hydrodynamization epoch depends on the exact nature of the high-energy quench. There is a universal character to our findings, which can be applied to the short-time behavior of any interacting many-body quantum system after a sudden high-energy quench. We specifically discuss its potential relevance to heavy-ion collisions.

Title: Ineffectiveness of Formamidine in Suppressing Ultralow Thermal Conductivity in Cubic Hybrid Perovskite FAPbI3
Authors: Jiongzhi Zheng, Zheng Chang, Changpeng Lin, Chongjia Lin, Yanguang Zhou, Baoling Huang, Ruiqiang Guo, Geoffroy Hautier
Abstract: Fundamentally understanding the lattice dynamics and microscopic mechanisms of thermal transport in cubic hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites remains elusive, primarily due to their strong anharmonicity and frequent phase transitions. In this work, we comprehensively investigate the thermal transport behavior in cubic hybrid perovskite FAPbI3, integrating first principles-based anharmonic lattice dynamics with a linearized Wigner transport formula. The Temperature Dependent Effective Potential (TDEP) technique allows us to stabilize the negative soft modes, primarily dominated by organic cations, at finite temperatures in cubic FAPbI3. We then predict an ultra-low thermal conductivity of ~0.63 Wm^(-1) K^(-1) in cubic FAPbI3 at 300 K, with a temperature dependence of T^(-0.740), suggesting a good crystalline nature of phonon transport. Notably, the ultra-low thermal conductivity in cubic FAPbI3 is primarily attributed to the [PbI3]1- units, challenging the conventional focus on organic FA+ cations. This shift in focus is due to the presence of Pb(s)-I(p) anti-bonding sates within the [PbI3]1- units. Furthermore, thermal transport in cubic FAPbI3 is predominantly governed by the particle-like phonon propagation channel across the entire temperature range of 300-500 K, a result of diminished suppression of low-frequency phonons by FA+ cations and large inter-branch spacings. Finally, our findings underscore that the anharmonic force constants are highly temperature-sensitive, leading to underestimations of thermal conductivity when relying on 0-K anharmonic force constants. Our study not only elucidates the microscopic mechanisms of thermal transport in cubic FAPbI3 but also provides a crucial framework for the discovery, design, and understanding of hybrid organic-inorganic compounds with ultra-low thermal conductivity.

Title: Microscopic theory for electron-phonon coupling in twisted bilayer graphene
Authors: Ziyan Zhu, Thomas P. Devereaux
Abstract: The origin of superconductivity in twisted bilayer graphene -- whether phonon-driven or electron-driven -- remains unresolved, in part due to the absence of a quantitative and efficient model for electron-phonon coupling (EPC). In this work, we develop a first-principles-based microscopic theory to calculate EPC in twisted bilayer graphene for arbitrary twist angles without requiring a periodic moiré supercell. Our approach combines a momentum-space continuum model for both electronic and phononic structures with a generalized Eliashberg-McMillan theory beyond the adiabatic approximation. Using this framework, we find that the EPC is strongly enhanced near the magic angle. The superconducting transition temperature induced by low-energy phonons peaks at $1.1^\circ$ around 1 K, and remains finite for a range of angles both below and above the magic angles. We predict that superconductivity persists up to $\sim 1.4^\circ$, where superconductivity has been recently observed despite the dispersive electronic bands. Beyond a large density of states, we identify a key condition for strong EPC: resonance between the electronic bandwidth and the dominant phonon frequencies. We also show that the EPC strength of a specific phonon corresponds to the modification of the moiré potential. In particular, we identify several $\Gamma$-phonon branches that contribute most significantly to the EPC, which are experimentally detectable via Raman spectroscopy.

Title: A method to treat strongly correlated topological superconductors in one and two dimensions
Authors: Kaushal Kumar Kesharpu, Evgenii A. Kochetov, Alvaro Ferraz
Abstract: In the strong electron-electron (e-e) interaction limit each atomic site is constrained to be either empty or singly occupied. One can treat this scenario by fractionalizing the electrons into spin and charge degrees of freedom. We use the coherent state symbols associated with the lowest irreducible representation of the $su(2|1)$ superalgebra spanned by the Hubbard operators to solve the proposed models, as they implicitly take into account both the single particle occupation constraint and the fractionalization of the electrons. As an example, using the proposed method we solve the one dimensional Kitaev chain and two-dimensional BCS-Hubbard model to show the emergence of topological properties. The proposed procedure is quite general and can be used to analyze different lattice Hamiltonian, provided strong e-e correlation excludes doubly occupied states.

Title: Theoretical study on the possibility of high $T_c$ s$\pm$-wave superconductivity in the heavily hole-doped infinite layer nickelates
Authors: Hirofumi Sakakibara, Ryota Mizuno, Masayuki Ochi, Hidetomo Usui, Kazuhiko Kuroki
Abstract: We theoretically propose a possibility of realizing high $T_c$ superconductivity having $s\pm$-wave symmetry in the heavily hole-doped infinite layer nickelates La$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$NiO$_2$. We consider situations where the original $P4/mmm$ symmetry of LaNiO$_2$ is maintained even for a significant amount of Sr substitution by growing thin films on substrates having tetragonal symmetry. Considering such cases is indeed justified by our phonon calculations. For electron configurations somewhat close to $d^8$, the interaction between the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ band and the other $3d$ bands that lie just below the Fermi level results in an enhancement of superconductivity where the sign of the gap function is reversed between the former and the latter bands. The strong enhancement of superconductivity can be attributed to the large energy level offset between $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and other orbitals due to the absence of the apical oxygens, as has been pointed out in previous studies.

Title: Chiral Edge States Emerging on Anyon-Net
Authors: Atsushi Ueda, Kansei Inamura, Kantaro Ohmori
Abstract: We propose a symmetry-based approach to constructing lattice models for chiral topological phases, focusing on non-Abelian anyons. Using a 2+1D version of anyon chains and modular tensor categories(MTCs), we ensure exact MTC symmetry at the microscopic level. Numerical simulations using tensor networks demonstrate chiral edge modes for topological phases with Ising and Fibonacci anyons. Our method contrasts with conventional solvability approaches, providing a new theoretical avenue to explore strongly coupled 2+1D systems, revealing chiral edge states in non-Abelian anyonic systems.

Title: Inter-Layer Correlation of Loop Current Charge Density Wave on the Bilayer Kagomé Lattice
Authors: Jin-Wei Dong, Yu-Han Lin, Ruiqing Fu, Gang Su, Ziqiang Wang, Sen Zhou
Abstract: Loop current order has been suggested as a promising candidate for the spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking $2a_0 \times 2a_0$ charge density wave (CDW) revealed in vanadium-based kagomé metals \avs\ ($A$ = K, Rb, Cs) near van Hove filling $n_\text{vH} = 5/12$. Weak-coupling analyses and mean field calculations have demonstrated that nearest-neighbor Coulomb repulsion $V_1$ and next-nearest-neighbor Coulomb repulsion $V_2$ drives, respectively, real and imaginary bond-ordered CDW, with the latter corresponding to time-reversal symmetry breaking loop current CDW. It is important to understand the inter-layer correlation of these bond-ordered CDWs and its consequences in the bulk kagomé materials. To provide physical insights, we investigate in this paper the $c$-axis stacking of them, loop current CDW in particular, on the minimal bilayer kagomé lattice. The bare susceptibilities for stacking of real and imaginary bond orders are calculated for the free electrons on the bilayer kagomé lattice with inter-layer coupling $t_\perp=0.2t$, which splits the van Hove filling to $n_{+\text{vH}}=4.64/12$ and $n_{-\text{vH}}=5.44/12$. While real and imaginary bond-ordered CDWs are still favored, respectively, by $V_1$ and $V_2$, their inter-layer coupling is sensitive to band filling $n$. They tend to stack symmetrically near $n_{\pm\text{vH}}$ with identical bond orders in the two layers and give rise to a $2a_0 \times 2a_0 \times 1c_0$ CDW. On the other hand, they prefer to stack antisymmetrically around $n_\text{vH}$ with opposite bond orders in the two layers and lead to a $2a_0 \times 2a_0 \times 2c_0$ CDW. The concrete bilayer $t$-$t_\perp$-$V_1$-V$_2$ model is then studied. We obtain the mean-field ground states and determine the inter-layer coupling as a function of band filling at various interactions. The nontrivial topological properties of loop current CDWs are studied ...

Title: Learning efficient erasure protocols for an underdamped memory
Authors: Nicolas Barros, Stephen Whitelam, Sergio Ciliberto, Ludovic Bellon
Abstract: We apply evolutionary reinforcement learning to a simulation model in order to identify efficient time-dependent erasure protocols for a physical realization of a one-bit memory by an underdamped mechanical cantilever. We show that these protocols, when applied to the cantilever in the laboratory, are considerably more efficient than our best hand-designed protocols. The learned protocols allow reliable high-speed erasure by minimizing the heating of the memory during the operation. More generally, the combination of methods used here opens the door to the rational design of efficient protocols for a variety of physics applications.

Title: A note on the deformation of 1D ferromagnetic domain walls due to double exchange interaction with a free electron gas
Authors: K. Seremetas, X. Zotos
Abstract: Using an S-matrix formulation we evaluate the thermodynamic potential and conductance of a Bloch or Néel magnetic wall interacting with a one dimensional free electron gas via a double exchange interaction. The minimization of the elastic magnetic energy plus electronic thermodynamic potential indicates that for chemical potential larger than the magnetic interaction the domain wall is generally deformed to a thin wall, while for magnetic interaction larger than the chemical potential tends towards wide walls. In contrast, for a double wall configuration the deformation is always towards wide walls. For the single as well as the double magnetic wall configurations the conductance monotonically decreases with decreasing wall width. The thermodynamic potential and conductance of Bloch and Néel magnetic domain walls are identical within this prototype model.

Title: Growing length and time scales in activity-mediated glassy dynamics in confluent cell monolayers
Authors: Souvik Sadhukhan, Chandan Dasgupta, Saroj Kumar Nandi
Abstract: Activity-mediated unjamming of a confluent glassy system is crucial for several biological processes, such as embryogenesis and cancer metastasis. During these processes, the cells progressively change their junction properties, characterized by an interaction parameter $p_0$, and become motile. Here, we study the effect of nonequilibrium active fluctuations, in the form of self-propulsion, on the glassy dynamics in a confluent system. We simulate the active Vertex model and use the analytical mode-coupling theory (MCT) to show that the nature of the transition in the presence of activity remains similar to that in a thermal system where the fluctuations are temperature-like. The agreement of the simulation results with the MCT predictions demonstrates that the structure-dynamics feedback mechanism controls the relaxation dynamics. In addition, we present the first computation of a dynamic length scale, $\xi_d$, in confluent systems using finite-size scaling, and show that the growing relaxation time exhibita a power-law dependence on $\xi_d$. Furthermore, unlike particulate glasses, the static length that governs the finite-size scaling of the relaxation time is proportional to $\xi_d$, revealing the unique nature of the glassy dynamics in confluent systems.

Title: Quantum Sensing of Broadband Spin Dynamics and Magnon Transport in Antiferromagnets
Authors: Alex Lee Melendez, Shekhar Das, Francisco Ayala Rodriguez, I-Hsuan Kao, Wenhao Liu, Archibald J. Williams, Bing Lv, Joshua Goldberger, Shubhayu Chatterjee, Simranjeet Singh, P. Chris Hammel
Abstract: Optical detection of magnetic resonance using quantum spin sensors (QSS) provides a spatially local and sensitive technique to probe spin dynamics in magnets. However, its utility as a probe of antiferromagnetic resonance (AFMR) remains an open question. We report the first experimental demonstration of optically detected AFMR in layered van der Waals antiferromagnets (AF) up to frequencies of 24 GHz. We leverage QSS spin relaxation due to low-frequency magnetic field fluctuations arising from collective dynamics of magnons excited by the uniform AFMR mode. First, through AFMR spectroscopy we characterize the intrinsic exchange fields and magnetic anisotropies of the AF. Second, using the localized sensitivity of the QSS we demonstrate magnon transport over tens of micrometers. Finally, we find that optical detection efficiency increases with increasing frequency. This showcases the dual capabilities of QSS as detectors of high frequency magnetization dynamics and magnon transport, paving the way for understanding and controlling the magnetism of antiferromagnets.

Title: Out-of-plane bond-order phase, superconductivity, and their competition in the $t$-$J_\parallel$-$J_\perp$ model: Possible implications for bilayer nickelates
Authors: Matías Bejas, Xianxin Wu, Debmalya Chakraborty, Andreas P. Schnyder, Andrés Greco
Abstract: Almost four decades of intense research have been invested to study the physics of high-T$_c$ cuprate superconductors. The recent discovery of high-T$_c$ superconductivity in pressurized bilayer nickelates and its potential similarities with cuprate superconductors may open a new window to understand this long-standing problem. We have studied the proposed bilayer $t$-$J_\parallel$-$J_\perp$ model [where $J_\parallel$ ($J_\perp$) is the in-plane (out-of-plane) magnetic exchange] in a large-$N$ approach on the basis of the path integral representation for Hubbard operators, which allows to obtain results at mean-field and beyond mean-field level. We find that $J_\perp$ is a candidate for triggering high superconducting $T_c$ values at quarter filling (hole doping $\delta=0.5$) of the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals. Beyond mean-field level, we find a new phase, an out-of-plane bond-order phase (z-BOP), triggered also by $J_\perp$. z-BOP develops below a critical temperature which decreases with increasing doping and vanishes at a quantum critical point below quarter filling. The occurrence of this phase and its competition with superconductivity leads to a superconducting dome-shaped behavior as a function of doping and as a function of $J_\perp$. Qualitative comparisons with the physics of cuprates and the recent literature on the new pressurized nickelates are given along the paper.

Title: Chaotic-Integrable Transition for Disordered Orbital Hatsugai-Kohmoto Model
Authors: Ying-Lin Li, Chen-Te Ma, Po-Yao Chang
Abstract: We have drawn connections between the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model and the multi-orbit Hatsugai-Kohmoto model, emphasizing their similarities and differences regarding chaotic behaviors. The features of the spectral form factor, such as the dip-ramp-plateau structure and the adjacent gap ratio, indicate chaos in the disordered orbital Hatsugai-Kohmoto model. One significant conclusion is that the plateau value of the out-of-time-order correlator, whether in the Hatsugai-Kohmoto model, Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model with two- or four-body interactions, or a disorder-free Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model, does not effectively differentiate between integrable and chaotic phases in many-body systems. This observation suggests a limitation in using out-of-time-order correlator plateau values as a diagnostic tool for chaos. Our exploration of these ideas provides a deeper understanding of how chaos arises in non-Fermi liquid systems and the tools we use to study it. It opens the door to further questions, particularly about whether there are more effective ways to distinguish between chaotic and integrable phases in these complex systems.

Title: Double Splay Nematic Order in Confined Polar Fluids
Authors: Zhongjie Ma, Miao Jiang, Aile Sun, Shengzhu Yi, Jidan Yang, Mingjun Huang, Satoshi Aya, Qi-Huo Wei
Abstract: In this study, we demonstrate that when a ferroelectric nematic is confined between two glass plates coated with ionic polymers, a modulated phase emerges in a narrow temperature range between the nematic and ferroelectric nematic phases. This modulated phase emerges from the nematic phase in a continuous manner and then transforms into the ferroelectric nematic phase via a first-order transition upon cooling. Using optical microscopy, we provide compelling evidence that this modulated phase corresponds to the theoretically predicted double splay nematic phase. In this phase, splay deformations alternate in two orthogonal directions oriented at 45° to the substrate surfaces, creating a modulation wavelength that is twice the thickness of the cell. Our experiments with different ionic coatings reveal that only polymeric cationic coatings effectively promote the formation of this phase, highlighting the critical role of electrical screening. These findings not only confirm the existence of the double splay nematic phase but also provide insights into the distinctive topological defects of this phase in confined geometries.

Title: Inverse Faraday effect in 3d, 4d, and 5d transition metals
Authors: Shashi B. Mishra
Abstract: Using first-principles calculations, we systematically investigate the spin contributions to the inverse Faraday effect (IFE) in transition metals. The IFE depends on the d-electron filling and asymmetry between excited electron and hole spin moments. Our results reveal that even elements with smaller electron magnetic moments, like Os, can exhibit higher IFE due to greater electron-hole asymmetry. Pt shows the highest IFE in the 1-2 eV frequency range, while Os dominates in the 2-4 eV range. In addition, we demonstrate that the IFE of neighboring elements with similar crystal structures (e.g., Ir, Pt, and Au) can be tuned by adjusting their Fermi levels, indicating the importance of d-electron filling on IFE. Finally, we find that the trend in electron (or hole) contributions to the IFE closely follows that of the spin Hall conductivity, however, the total IFE involves more complex interactions.

Title: The Dean-Kawasaki equation and stochastic density functional theory
Authors: Pierre Illien
Abstract: The Dean-Kawasaki (DK) equation, which is at the basis of stochastic density functional theory (SDFT), was proposed in the mid-nineties to describe the evolution of the density of interacting Brownian particles, which can represent a large number of systems such as colloidal suspensions, supercooled liquids, polymer melts, biological molecules, active or chemotactic particles, or ions in solution. This theoretical framework, which can be summarized as a mathematical reformulation of the coupled overdamped Langevin equations that govern the dynamics of the particles, has attracted a significant amount of attention during the past thirty years. In this review, I present the context in which this framework was introduced, and I recall the main assumptions and calculation techniques that are employed to derive the DK equation. Then, in the broader context of statistical mechanics, I show how SDFT is connected to other theories, such fluctuating hydrodynamics, macroscopic fluctuation theory, or mode-coupling theory. The mathematical questions that are raised by the DK equation are presented in a non-specialist language. In the last parts of the review, I show how the original result was extended in several directions, I present the different strategies and approximations that have been employed to solve the DK equation, both analytically and numerically. I finally list the different situations where SDFT was employed to describe the fluctuations of Brownian suspensions, from the physics of active matter to the description of charged particles and electrolytes.

Title: Energy landscape analysis based on the Ising model: Tutorial review
Authors: Naoki Masuda, Saiful Islam, Si Thu Aung, Takamitsu Watanabe
Abstract: We review a class of energy landscape analysis method that uses the Ising model and takes multivariate time series data as input. The method allows one to capture dynamics of the data as trajectories of a ball from one basin to a different basin to yet another, constrained on the energy landscape specified by the estimated Ising model. While this energy landscape analysis has mostly been applied to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from the brain for historical reasons, there are emerging applications outside fMRI data and neuroscience. To inform such applications in various research fields, this review paper provides a detailed tutorial on each step of the analysis, terminologies, concepts underlying the method, and validation, as well as recent developments of extended and related methods.

Title: Dirac points and Weyl phase in a honeycomb altermagnet
Authors: Zhang Meng-Han, Guo Xuan, Dao-Xin Yao
Abstract: We present a graphene derivative displaying novel topological phenomena without the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in a collinear altermagnet. Band degeneracies in spin-split honeycomb antiferromagnets produce unique distribution patterns of Berry curvature and give rise to topological boundary states with unconventional spin textures. The asymmetric Berry curvature due to spin splitting can be created by lifting the degeneracies, which concentrate intensely at Weyl points contributing to carrier dynamics with a large valley Hall effect. The altermagnetism breaks the intrinsic time-reversal symmetry, guaranteeing the formation of pairs of Weyl points associated with the internal spin structure chiralities. We investigate the evolution of Dirac and Weyl crossings, in which topological phase transitions are characterized by the high Chern numbers preserving the non-intersecting flows of Wannier centers over occupied bands. Our results yield unique degeneracy-protected states by leveraging the symmetry constraints, where corresponding experiments are illustrated to demonstrate the potential of advancing valleytronic devices via unconventional topological responses.

Title: Spin density wave and van Hove singularity in the kagome metal CeTi3Bi4

Abstract: Kagome metals with van Hove singularities near the Fermi level can host intriguing quantum phenomena such as chiral loop currents, electronic nematicity, and unconventional superconductivity. However, to our best knowledge, unconventional magnetic states driven by van Hove singularities--like spin-density waves--have not been observed experimentally in kagome metals. Here, we report the magnetic and electronic structure of the layered kagome metal CeTi3Bi4, where Ti kagome electronic structure interacts with a magnetic sublattice of Ce3+ Jeff = 1/2 moments. Neutron diffraction reveals an incommensurate spin-density wave ground state of the Ce3+ moments, coexisting with commensurate antiferromagnetic order across most of the temperature-field phase diagram. The commensurate component is preferentially suppressed by thermal fluctuations and magnetic field, yielding a rich phase diagram involving an intermediate single-Q spin-density wave phase. First-principles calculations and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy identify van Hove singularities near the Fermi level, with the observed magnetic propagation vectors connecting their high density of states, strongly suggesting a van Hove singularity-assisted spin-density wave. These findings establish kagome metals LnTi3Bi4 as a model platform where the characteristic electronic structure of the kagome lattice plays a pivotal role in magnetic order.

Title: Josephson Field Effect Transistors with InAs on Insulator and High Permittivity Gate Dielectrics
Authors: Alessandro Paghi, Laura Borgongino, Sebastiano Battisti, Simone Tortorella, Giacomo Trupiano, Giorgio De Simoni, Elia Strambini, Lucia Sorba, Francesco Giazotto
Abstract: InAs on Insulator (InAsOI) has been recently demonstrated as a promising platform to develop hybrid semiconducting-superconducting Josephson Junctions (JJs) and Josephson Field Effect Transistors (JoFETs). The InAsOI consists of an InAs epilayer grown onto a cryogenic-electrically-insulating InAlAs metamorphic buffer, which allows the electrical decoupling of surface-exposed adjacent devices together with a high critical current density integration. The miniaturization of Si microchips has progressed significantly due to the integration of high permittivity (high-k) gate insulators, allowing an increased gate coupling with the transistor channel with consequent reduced gate operating voltages and leakages. As well as for Si-based FETs, integrating high-k gate insulators with JoFETs promises similar advantages in superconducting electronics. Here, we investigate the gate-tunable electrical properties of InAsOI-based JoFETs featuring different high-k gate insulators, namely, HfO2 and Al2O3. We found that both the ungated and gate-tunable electrical properties of the JoFETs are strongly dependent on the insulator chosen. With both dielectrics, the JoFETs can entirely suppress the switching current and increase the normal state resistance by 10-20 times using negative gate voltages. The HfO2-JoFETs exhibit improved gate-tunable electrical performance compared to those achieved with Al2O3-JoFETs, which is related to the higher permittivity of the insulator. Gate-dependent electrical properties of InAsOI-based JoFETs were evaluated in the temperature range from 50 mK to 1 K. Moreover, under the influence of an out-of-plane magnetic field, JoFETs exhibited an unconventional Fraunhofer diffraction pattern, from which an edge-peaked supercurrent density distribution was calculated.

Title: Polarization and driving force analysis of coherent optical shear phonons in graphite
Authors: Christian Gerbig, Silvio Morgenstern, Ahmed S. Hassanien, Marlene Adrian, Arne Ungeheuer, Thomas Baumert, Arne Senftleben
Abstract: Coherent optical phonons in the degenerate inter-layer shear mode of graphite launched by femtosecond laser pulses were investigated using ultrafast electron diffraction. The collective atomic motion is shown to be polarized in a direction related to the linear polarization of the incoming laser pulse. Using a fit with a generic driven-oscillator model, the lifetime of the oscillator's driving force is determined to 37(30) fs. This is much shorter than the lifetime of excited carriers in graphite but similar to the time scale of the loss of the hot carrier's k-space anisotropy.

Title: Nonperturbative self-consistent electron-phonon spectral functions and transport
Authors: Jae-Mo Lihm, Samuel Poncé
Abstract: Electron-phonon coupling often dominates the electron spectral functions and carrier transport properties. However, studies of this effect in real materials have largely relied on perturbative one-shot methods due to the lack of a first-principles theoretical and computational framework. Here, we present a self-consistent theory and implementation for the nonperturbative calculations of spectral functions and conductivity due to electron-phonon coupling. Applying this method to monolayer InSe, we demonstrate that self-consistency qualitatively affects the spectral function and transport properties compared to state-of-the-art one-shot calculations and allows one to reconcile calculations with angle-resolved photoemission experiments. The developed method can be widely applied to materials with dominant electron-phonon coupling at a moderate computational cost.

Title: Theory of Order-Disorder Phase Transitions Induced by Fluctuations Based on Network Models
Authors: Yonglong Ding
Abstract: Both quantum phase transitions and thermodynamic phase transitions are probably induced by fluctuations, yet the specific mechanism through which fluctuations cause phase transitions remains unclear in existing theories. This paper summarizes different phases into combinations of three types of network structures based on lattice models transformed into network models. These three network structures correspond to ordered, boundary, and disordered conditions, respectively. By utilizing the transformation relationships satisfied by these three network structures and classical probability, this work derive the high-order detailed balance relationships satisfied by strongly correlated systems. Using the high-order detailed balance formula, this work obtain the weights of the maximum entropy network structures in general cases. Consequently, I clearly describe the process of ordered-disordered phase transitions based on fluctuations and provide critical exponents and phase transition points. Finally, I verify this theory using the Ising model in different dimensions, the frustration scenario of the triangular lattice antiferromagnetic Ising model, and the expectation of ground-state energy in the two-dimensional Edwards-Anderson model.

Title: Electronic Structure of Kramers Nodal-Line Semimetal YAuGe and Anomalous Hall Effect Induced by Magnetic Rare-Earth Substitution

Abstract: Nodal-line semimetals are a class of topological materials hosting one dimensional lines of band degeneracy. Kramers nodal-line (KNL) metals/semimetals have recently been theoretically recognized as a class of topological states inherent to all non-centrosymmetric achiral crystal lattices. We investigate the electronic structure of candidate KNL semimetal YAuGe by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and quantum oscillations as well as by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. DFT has revealed that YAuGe hosts KNLs on the G-A-L-M plane of the Brillouin zone, that are protected by the time reversal and mirror-inversion symmetries. Through ARPES and quantum oscillations we identify signatures of hole bands enclosing the G point, and the observed splitting of quantum oscillation frequency with angle is attributed to spin-orbit-coupling-induced band splitting away from the KNLs. Furthermore, we show that the degeneracy of the nodal lines along the G-A line is lifted by the time-reversal-symmetry breaking when the Y is substituted by magnetic R ions (R = rare earth). This becomes a source of Berry curvature and contributes to the anomalous Hall effect in magnetic RAuGe. These findings establish RAuGe as a new class of KNL semimetals offering significant potential for engineering of anomalous magnetotransport properties via magnetic rare-earth substitution.

Title: Nonlinear Hall effect driven by spin-charge-coupled motive force
Authors: Kohei Hattori, Hikaru Watanabe, Ryotaro Arita
Abstract: Parity-time-reversal symmetric ($\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric) magnets have garnered much attention due to their spin-charge coupled dynamics enriched by the parity-symmetry breaking. By real-time simulations, we study how localized spin dynamics can affect the nonlinear Hall effect in $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric magnets. To identify the leading-order term, we derive analytical expressions for the second-order optical response and classify the contributions by considering their transformation properties under $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry. Notably, our results reveal that the sizable contribution is attributed to the mixed dipole effect, which is analogous to the Berry curvature dipole term.

Title: Band representations in Strongly Correlated Settings: The Kitaev Honeycomb Model
Authors: Axel Fünfhaus, Mikel García-Díez, M. G. Vergniory, Thilo Kopp, Stephen M. Winter, Roser Valentí
Abstract: In the study of quantum spin liquids, the Kitaev model plays a pivotal role due to the fact that its ground state is exactly known as well as the fact that it may be realized in strongly frustrated materials such as ${\alpha}$-RuCl${}_3$. While topological insulators and superconductors can be investigated by means of topological band theory -- in particular the topological quantum chemistry (TQC) formalism -- the Kitaev model evades such a treatment, as it is not possible to set up a proper single-particle Green's function for it. We instead associate spin operators with ``orbitals'' that give rise to a band structure. It is thereby possible to analyze the corresponding excitation spectrum engendered by these localized excitations by means of TQC. Special attention is given to the low-energy topological edge mode spectrum. Our work sheds light on the question how the TQC formalism may be generalized to strongly correlated and topologically ordered systems like the Kitaev model.

Title: New Methods for Critical Analysis: Revealing the Simultaneous Existence of Universality Classes in Nontrivial Magnetic Systems
Authors: Harish Chandr Chauhan, Umesh C. Roy, Shovan Dan, A. Thamizhavel, Pintu Das
Abstract: In magnetic systems, the microscopic constituents exhibit power law behavior near the paramagnetic transition temperature, $T_C$. The critical exponents (CEs) associated with the physical quantities that demonstrate singular behavior at $T_C$ illustrate the critical behavior, specifically the range and type of exchange interactions emerging in magnetic systems. However, it is realized that the developed methodologies may not yield accurate values of CEs, especially for magnetic systems with competing interactions, referred to as nontrivial magnetic systems. Currently, no comprehensive method effectively addresses the competing effects of the range of magnetic interactions among the constituent entities emerging in such systems. Additionally, there is no definitive explanation for CE values that do not belong to any single universality class. Here, we present new methodologies for critical analysis aimed at determining both the range of exchange interaction(s) and appropriate values of CEs. Using computational and experimental investigations, we analyze the magnetic behavior of trivial Ni and nontrivial Gd. Our findings demonstrate that (i) the critical behavior remains the same on either side of $T_C$, (ii) the critical behavior associated with local electron moments remains unaffected by the magnetic field, and (iii) in Gd, the critical role of competing interactions becomes evident: local electron moments follow a three-dimensional Ising-type short-range interaction, while itinerant electron moments exhibit a mean-field-type long-range Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction, which weakens under an external magnetic field due to the localization effect on itinerant electrons.

Title: Phase-field modeling of radiation-induced composition redistribution: An application to additively manufactured austenitic Fe-Cr-Ni
Authors: Sourabh Bhagwan Kadambi, Daniel Schwen, Jia-Hong Ke, Lingfeng He, Andrea M. Jokisaari
Abstract: Multicomponent alloys undergoing irradiation damage develop radiation-induced composition redistribution at point defect sinks such as grain boundaries (GBs) and dislocations. Such redistribution results in undesired changes to their mechanical behavior and corrosion resistance. Additively manufactured alloys proposed for future nuclear applications are expected to demonstrate a distinct response to irradiation owing to their unique microstructure with as-solidified dislocation density and chemical microsegregation. To capture the composition redistribution in such systems, we develop a mesoscale model with coupled evolution of atomic and point defect components in the presence of dislocation density, dislocation heterogeneity, and thermodynamic interactions at the GB. The model is parameterized for an FCC Fe-Cr-Ni alloy as a representative system for austenitic stainless steels, and simulations are performed in 1D and 2D as a function of irradiation temperature, dose, dislocation density, and grain size. Radiation-induced segregation (RIS) characterized by Cr depletion and Ni enrichment is predicted at both the GB and the dislocation cell wall, with RIS being lower in magnitude but wider at the cell wall. Strongly biased absorption of self-interstitials by dislocations is found to suppress Ni enrichment but slightly enhance Cr depletion under certain conditions. Thermodynamic segregation at the GB is predicted to be narrower and opposite in sign to RIS for both Cr and Ni. Importantly, non-monotonic segregation is found to occur when both thermodynamic and RIS mechanisms are considered, providing a novel physical interpretation of experimental observations. The model is expected to serve as a key tool in accelerated qualification of irradiated materials.

Title: Phonon-mediated electron attraction in SrTiO$_3$ via the generalized Fröhlich and deformation potential mechanisms
Authors: Christopher J.N. Coveney, Norm M. Tubman, Chih-En Hsu, Andres Montoya-Castillo, Marina R. Filip, Jeffrey B. Neaton, Zhenglu Li, Vojtech Vlcek, Antonios M. Alvertis
Abstract: Superconductivity in doped SrTiO$_3$ was discovered in 1964, the first superconducting transition observed in a doped semiconductor. However, the mechanism of electron pairing in SrTiO$_3$ remains a subject of debate. By developing a theoretical framework to incorporate dynamical lattice screening in the electronic Coulomb interactions of semiconductors and insulators, we demonstrate analytically that linear long-range coupling of electrons to multiple longitudinal optical phonons, described by a generalized Fröhlich mechanism, can result in superconductivity in SrTiO$_3$. Moreover, by combining our theory with first-principles calculations, we reveal an additional attractive interaction between electrons in SrTiO$_3$ due to the deformation potential mechanism, arising from the mixed ionic-covalent character of the Ti-O bond. Our results may have implications for the emergence of phonon-mediated electron attraction and superconductivity in a broad range of materials.

Title: Time-delayed Newton's law of cooling with a finite-rate thermal quench: Impact on the Mpemba and Kovacs effects
Authors: Andrés Santos
Abstract: The Mpemba and Kovacs effects are two notable memory phenomena observed in nonequilibrium relaxation processes. In a recent study [Phys.~Rev.~E \textbf{109}, 044149 (2024)], these effects were analyzed within the framework of the time-delayed Newton's law of cooling under the assumption of instantaneous temperature quenches. Here, the analysis is extended to incorporate finite-rate quenches, characterized by a nonzero quench duration $\sigma$. The results indicate that a genuine Mpemba effect is absent under finite-rate quenches if both samples experience the same thermal environment during the quenching process. However, if $\sigma$ remains sufficiently small, the deviations in the thermal environment stay within an acceptable range, allowing the Mpemba effect to persist with a slightly enhanced magnitude. In contrast, the Kovacs effect is significantly amplified, with the transient hump in the temperature evolution becoming more pronounced as both the waiting time and $\sigma$ increase. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating finite-time effects in nonequilibrium thermal relaxation models and offer a more realistic perspective for experimental studies.

Title: Anderson transition symmetries at the band-edge of a correlated tin monolayer
Authors: Mathieu Lizée, Mohammadmehdi Torkzadeh, François Debontridder, Marie Hervé, Christophe Brun, Tristan Cren
Abstract: The interplay between Anderson localization and Coulomb repulsion reveals deep connections to superconductivity and many-body localization in quantum systems. In this study, we investigate a tin monolayer on silicon, a material known for its Mott and antiferromagnetic behavior, as it undergoes a metal-insulator transition near a band edge. By analyzing spatial correlations of the local density of states (LDOS) using scanning tunneling spectroscopy, we precisely identify the mobility edge and determine its critical exponent as $\nu$ = 0.75 $\pm$ 0.1. We show that both the LDOS distribution functions and the multifractal spectra obey two exact symmetry relations, which are based on the Weyl group symmetry of nonlinear sigma-models. These symmetries hold across the entire transition, from extended to strongly localized states, in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions. Overall, using tunneling spectroscopy maps on a model tin monolayer in combination with numerical models, we connect the localization patterns of disordered electronic systems with their Hamiltonian symmetry class.

Title: Intrinsic exciton transport and recombination in single-crystal lead bromide perovskite
Authors: Zhixuan Bi, Yunfei Bai, Ying Shi, Tao Sun, Heng Wu, Haochen Zhang, Yuhang Cui, Danlei Zhu, Yubin Wang, Miao-Ling Lin, Yaxian Wang, Dongxin Ma, Ping-Heng Tan, Sheng Meng, Qihua Xiong, Luyi Yang
Abstract: Photogenerated carrier transport and recombination in metal halide perovskites are critical to device performance. Despite considerable efforts, sample quality issues and measurement techniques have limited the access to their intrinsic physics. Here, by utilizing high-purity CsPbBr3 single crystals and contact-free transient grating spectroscopy, we directly monitor exciton diffusive transport from 26 to 300 K. As the temperature (T) increases, the carrier mobility ({\mu}) decreases rapidly below 100 K wtih a {\mu}~T^{-3.0} scaling, and then follows a more gradual {\mu}~T^{-1.7} trend at higher temperatures. First-principles calculations perfectly reproduce this experimental trend and reveal that optical phonon scattering governs carrier mobility shifts over the entire temperature range, with a single longitudinal optical mode dominating room-temperature transport. Time-resolved photoluminescence further identifies a substantial increase in exciton radiative lifetime with temperature, attributed to increased exciton population in momentum-dark states caused by phonon scattering. Our findings unambiguously resolve previous theory-experiment discrepancies, providing benchmarks for future optoelectronic design.

Title: Origin of second harmonic generation in non-centrosymmetric crystal structures containing lone-pairs electrons
Authors: Fuming Li, Shilie Pan, Zhihua Yang
Abstract: Material systems with lone-pair electrons have long been a treasure trove in the search for large second harmonic generation effects. Revealing the origin of second harmonic generation in nonlinear optical materials can provide theoretical guidance for the design of new materials. In this work, the origin of second harmonic generation in non-centrosymmetric materials containing lone pair electrons is revealed by analyzing the orbital interactions on the sublattice. Stereochemically inactive Pb 6\textit{s} orbitals with high symmetry in CsPbCO3F contribute less to the second harmonic generation. In contrast, the contribution of stereochemically active Pb 6s orbital in PbB5O7F3 and PbB2O3F2 is more obvious. Significantly, the orbitals of the interaction between lead and oxygen make a very significant contribution because these orbitals are located at the band edge and in non-centrosymmetric sublattices.

Title: Brownian motion and microrheology in complex fluids under periodic boundary conditions
Authors: Yasuya Nakayama
Abstract: We review the theoretical aspects of determining linear rheology using passive microrheology from simulations under periodic boundary conditions (PBC). It is common to impose periodic boundary conditions when evaluating bulk properties by molecular simulation. The Brownian motion of the probe particles is affected by PBCs, and thus their effects must be considered when microrheological analysis is applied to evaluate the dynamic modulus. First, we review the theory of microrheology based on the generalized Langevin equation (GLE) in an unbounded domain. Then, we briefly discuss the effect of periodic boundary conditions on the diffusion coefficient. After that, we explain the effect of PBCs on the mean-square displacement of Brownian particles and their impact on microrheology. The passive microrheology technique under PBCs provides a new approach for rheology evaluation in molecular simulations of complex liquids in addition to the traditional Green--Kubo formula and non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD).

Title: A Fluctuation Theory of Liquid-Phase Solutions: Shear Viscosity
Authors: Yury A. Budkov, Nikolai N. Kalikin, Petr E. Brandyshev
Abstract: Accurately describing liquids and their mixtures beyond equilibrium remains a significant challenge in modern chemical physics and physical chemistry, especially regarding the calculation of transport properties in liquid-phase systems. This paper introduces a phenomenological nonequilibrium theory specifically designed for multicomponent liquid-phase solutions. Our field-theoretical framework, rooted in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics, incorporates quasi-stationary concentration fluctuations that align with equilibrium liquid theory as described by classical density functional theory. This method serves as a phenomenological extension of the established Dean-Kawasaki stochastic density functional theory, enabling the computation of shear viscosity. We apply our approach to derive general formula for the shear viscosity in single-solute solutions. Our findings yield new results and successfully reproduce previously established results for such systems as solutions containing soft-core particles, hard spheres, one-component plasma, and near-critical solutions.

Title: Comparative analysis of methods for calculating Hubbard parameters using cRPA
Authors: Indukuru Ramesh Reddy, M. Kaltak, Bongjae Kim
Abstract: In this study, we present a systematic comparison of various approaches within the constrained random-phase approximation (cRPA) for calculating the Coulomb interaction parameter $U$. While defining the correlated space is straightforward for disentangled bands, the situation is more complex for entangled bands, where different projection schemes from hybridized bands to the target space can yield varying sizes of interaction parameters. We systematically evaluated different methods for calculating the polarizability functions within the correlated space. Furthermore, we analyze how different definitions of the correlated space, often constructed through Wannierization from Kohn-Sham orbitals, defines the orbital localization and play a crucial role in determining the interaction parameter. To illustrate these effects, we consider two sets of representative correlated d-orbital oxides: LiMO$_{2}$ (M = V-Ni) as examples of isolated d-electron systems and SrMO$_{3}$ (M = Mn, Fe, and Co) as cases of entangled d-electron systems. Through this systematic comparison, we provide a detailed analysis of different cRPA methodologies for computing the Hubbard parameters.

Title: Evolution of surface morphology from Stranski Krastanov growth mode to step flow growth mode in InSbBi thin films
Authors: Chandima Kasun Edirisinghe, Anuradha Wijesinghe, Anjali Rathore, Pradip Adhikari, Christopher Rouleau, Joon Sue Lee
Abstract: The incorporation of dilute concentrations of bismuth (Bi) into traditional III V alloys leads to significant reduction in bandgap energy, making InSbBi is a promising candidate for long wavelength infrared photodetection sensors due to its small bandgap (<0.17 eV). Furthermore, InSbBi could serve as a valuable platform for spin dynamics and quantum phenomena due to its strong spin-orbit coupling. Despite its potential, the material quality of InSbBi alloys lags behind that of conventional III V semiconductors, primarily due to the substantial challenges associated with incorporating Bi into InSb and producing high-quality InSbBi with varying Bi compositions. In this study, we address these issues by developing a method for growing smooth InSbBi thin films with tunable Bi incorporation up to 1.81% by the dynamic adjustment of Sb flux and careful control of the interplay between growth temperature and Bi flux using molecular beam epitaxy. This work paves the path for high-quality InSbBi thin films for applications in photodetection, spintronics, and quantum technology.

Title: Control of the magnetic hopfion lattice in helimagnet with the external field and anisotropy
Authors: Konstantin L. Metlov, Artem S. Tarasenko, Yulia A. Bezus, Maksim M. Gordei
Abstract: A generalized micromagnetic model of hopfions in a helimagnet with a two-dimensional (allowing both radial and azimuthal dependence) profile function is considered. Calculations confirm the elliptical stability of hopfions and the previously obtained analytical expression for the upper critical field of their lattice. Dependencies of the hopfion lattice periods on the magnitude of the applied external magnetic field and the uniaxial anisotropy constant of the material are obtained. It is shown that in an anisotropic helimagnet, the hopfion lattice expands in the direction of the anisotropy axis, and the expansion can be controlled by the external field and the uniaxial anisotropy constant.

Title: Non-Abelian Gauge Enhances Self-Healing for Non-Hermitian Su--Schrieffer--Heeger Chain
Authors: Yazhuang Miao, Yiming Zhao, Yong Wang, Jie Qiao, Xiaolong Zhao, Xuexi Yi
Abstract: We investigate a non-Hermitian extension of the Su--Schrieffer--Heeger model that incorporates spin-dependent SU(2) gauge fields, represented by non-Abelian couplings between lattice sites, as well as independent nonreciprocal hopping amplitudes. This framework gives rise to a rich phase structure characterized by complex-energy braiding and tunable non-Hermitian skin effects. By employing the generalized Brillouin zone approach, we analyze the bulk-boundary correspondence and identify topological transitions protected by chiral symmetry. Notably, we demonstrate that non-Abelian gauge fields significantly enhance the dynamical resilience of the system, enabling robust self-healing under a moving scattering potential. These results clarify the role of SU(2) gauge fields in stabilizing non-Hermitian topological phases and indicate that the proposed model can be realized with currently available photonic, atomic, and superconducting experimental platforms.

Abstract: Weyl semimetals have attracted significant interest in condensed matter physics and materials science, due to their unique electronic and topological properties. These characteristics not only deepen our understanding of fundamental quantum phenomena, but also make Weyl semimetals promising candidates for advanced applications in electronics, photonics, and spintronics. This review provides a systematic overview of the field, covering theoretical foundations, material synthesis, engineering strategies, and emerging device applications. We first outline the key theoretical principles and distinctive properties of Weyl semimetals, followed by an examination of recent advancements that enhance their functional versatility. Finally, we discuss the critical challenges hindering their practical implementation and explore future development directions, along with the potential for expanding and enhancing their existing range of applications. By integrating discussions of both opportunities and obstacles, this review offers a balanced perspective on current progress and future directions in Weyl semimetal research.

Title: An all-electrical scheme for valley polarization in graphene
Authors: Sachchidanand Das, Abhiram Soori
Abstract: We propose an all-electrical setup to generate valley polarization in graphene. A finite graphene sheet is connected to two normal metal electrodes each with two terminals along its zigzag edges, while the armchair edges remain free. When a bias is applied to one terminal and the others are grounded, valley polarization emerges due to transverse momentum matching between the graphene and the metal electrodes. Significant valley polarization is achieved when the Fermi wave vector in the metal exceeds half the separation between the \( K \) and \( K' \) valleys in graphene. We analyze how conductance and valley polarization depend on geometric and electronic parameters. While increasing the width enhances both conductance and polarization, increasing the length introduces Fabry--Pérot oscillations and suppresses valley polarization due to enhanced intervalley mixing. We also examine the effects of disorder: on-site disorder in graphene near the Dirac point increases conductance but reduces valley polarization. Finally, we study the impact of imperfect armchair edges and interface roughness, finding that moderate deviations from ideal conditions still yield substantial valley polarization. Our results demonstrate a viable route to electrically controlling valley degrees of freedom in graphene-based devices.

Title: Tunable Topological Phases in Multilayer Graphene Coupled to a Chiral Cavity
Authors: Sayed Ali Akbar Ghorashi, Jennifer Cano, Ceren B. Dag
Abstract: Coupling photonic cavity fields to electronic degrees of freedom in 2D materials introduces an additional control knob to the toolbox of solid-state engineering. Here we demonstrate a subtle competition between cavity frequency and interlayer tunneling in graphene stacks that is responsible for topological phase transitions in light-matter Hilbert space and that cannot be captured by mean-field theory in vacuum. A systematic exploration of multilayer graphene heterostructures and stacking configurations in a chiral tHz cavity reveals that linear dispersion enhances the low-energy cavity-induced topological gap. Furthermore, in bilayer graphene, a displacement field drives the low-energy vacuum band from valley-Chern to Chern insulator, comprising a gate-tunable topological phase transition. Our findings pave the way for future control and engineering of graphene heterostructures with chiral cavity fields.

Title: GPR_calculator: An On-the-Fly Surrogate Model to Accelerate Massive Nudged Elastic Band Calculations
Authors: Isaac Onyango, Byungkyun Kang, Qiang Zhu
Abstract: We present GPR_calculator, a package based on Python and C++ programming languages to build an on-the-fly surrogate model using Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to approximate expensive electronic structure calculations. The key idea is to dynamically train a GPR model during the simulation that can accurately predict energies and forces with uncertainty quantification. When the uncertainty is high, the expensive electronic structure calculation is performed to obtain the ground truth data, which is then used to update the GPR model. To illustrate the power of GPR_calculator, we demonstrate its application in Nudged Elastic Band (NEB) simulations of surface diffusion and reactions, achieving 3-10 times acceleration compared to pure ab initio calculations. The source code is available at this https URL.

Title: Leveraging Modified Ex Situ Tomography Data for Segmentation of In Situ Synchrotron X-Ray Computed Tomography
Authors: Tristan Manchester, Adam Anders, Julio Spadotto, Hannah Eccleston, William Beavan, Hugues Arcis, Brian J. Connolly
Abstract: In situ synchrotron X-ray computed tomography enables dynamic material studies, but automated segmentation remains challenging due to complex imaging artefacts and limited training data. We present a methodology for deep learning-based segmentation by transforming high-quality ex situ laboratory data to train models for binary segmentation of in situ synchrotron data, demonstrated through copper oxide dissolution studies. Using a modified SegFormer architecture, our approach achieves high segmentation performance on unseen data while reducing processing time from hours to seconds per 3D dataset. The method maintains consistent performance over significant morphological changes during experiments, despite training only on static specimens. This methodology can be readily applied to diverse materials systems, accelerating the analysis of time-resolved tomographic data across scientific disciplines.

Title: Neuronal correlations shape the scaling behavior of memory capacity and nonlinear computational capability of recurrent neural networks
Authors: Shotaro Takasu, Toshio Aoyagi
Abstract: Reservoir computing is a powerful framework for real-time information processing, characterized by its high computational ability and quick learning, with applications ranging from machine learning to biological systems. In this paper, we demonstrate that the memory capacity of a reservoir recurrent neural network scales sublinearly with the number of readout neurons. To elucidate this phenomenon, we develop a theoretical framework for analytically deriving memory capacity, attributing the decaying growth of memory capacity to neuronal correlations. In addition, numerical simulations reveal that once memory capacity becomes sublinear, increasing the number of readout neurons successively enables nonlinear processing at progressively higher polynomial orders. Furthermore, our theoretical framework suggests that neuronal correlations govern not only memory capacity but also the sequential growth of nonlinear computational capabilities. Our findings establish a foundation for designing scalable and cost-effective reservoir computing, providing novel insights into the interplay among neuronal correlations, linear memory, and nonlinear processing.

Title: Eppur si muove: Shape of topological defects -- and consequent motion -- in active nematics

Abstract: Topological defects in systems with liquid-crystalline order are crucial in determining their large-scale properties. In active systems, they are known to have properties impossible at equilibrium: for example, $+1/2$ defects in nematically-ordered systems self-propel. While some previous theoretical descriptions relied on assuming that the defect shape remains unperturbed by activity, we show that this assumption can lead to inconsistent predictions. We compute the shape of $-1/2$ defects and show that the one of $+1/2$ is intimately related to their self-propulsion speed. Our analytical predictions are corroborated via numerical simulations of a generic active nematic theory.

Abstract: Altermagnets are a newly identified family of collinear antiferromagnets with momentum-dependent spin-split band structure of non-relativistic origin, derived from spin-group symmetry-protected crystal structures. Among candidate altermagnets, CrSb is attractive for potential applications because of a large spin-splitting near the Fermi level and a high Neel transition temperature of around 700 K. We use molecular beam epitaxy to synthesize CrSb (0001) thin films with thicknesses ranging from 10 nm to 100 nm. Structural characterization, using reflection high energy electron diffraction, scanning transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction, demonstrates the growth of epitaxial films with good crystallinity. Polarized neutron reflectometry shows the absence of any net magnetization, consistent with antiferromagnetic order. In vacuo angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements probe the band structure in a previously unexplored regime of film thickness, down to 10 nm. These ARPES measurements show a three-dimensional momentum-dependent band splitting of up to 0.7 eV with g-wave symmetry, consistent with that seen in prior studies of bulk single crystals. The distinct altermagnetic band structure required for potential spin-transport applications survives down to the 10 nm thin film limit at room temperature.

Title: Statistical mechanical theory of liquid water
Authors: Lakshmanji Verma, Ken A. Dill
Abstract: Water is an unusual liquid. Its thermophysical properties are non-monotonic with temperature T and pressure p. It's not been known how water's behaviors are encoded in its molecules. We give a statistical physics model, Cage Water, which assumes three bonding states: van der Waals, pairwise hydrogen bonding, and multi-body cooperative caging hydrogen bonds. The model is analytical, so very fast to compute, yet it gives excellent agreement with extensive pT experiments. Through readily interpretable substates, Cage Water explains water's liquid anomalies -- including its controversial liquid-liquid supercooling transition -- as simple switchovers among the three bonding types.

Title: Complete suppression of flux instabilities in ramped superconducting magnets with synchronous temperature-modulated Jc
Authors: Cun Xue, Han-Xi Ren, Kai-Wei Cao, Wei Liu, Wen-Tao Zhang, Fang Yang, Guo Yan, You-He Zhou, Pingxiang Zhang
Abstract: Nonlinear multi-field coupling as an intrinsic property of complex physical systems often leads to abrupt and undesired instabilities. For current-ramped high-field Nb3Sn magnets, frequent flux jumps are observed, which easily causes premature quenches and requires prolonged and resource-intensive magnet training process. In this study, we propose a paradigm-shifting methodology framework that achieves complete suppression of thermomagnetic instabilities through synchronized temperature-modulated critical current density (Jc). Through numerical simulations of flux jumps in multifilamentary Nb3Sn wires at various temperatures, we construct thermomagnetic stability diagram in the Ha-T plane. The simulated results are in good agreement with experiments, confirming that the synchronized temperature ramp-down can fully eliminate flux jumps. We reveal the underlying mechanism of enhancing the thermomagnetic stability arises from that synchronized temperature ramp-down can continuously tune both Jc and its slope. Furthermore, we explore the thermomagnetic instabilities of current-ramped superconducting magnets through large-scale GPU-optimized algorithm. The flux jump and quench diagram in the Ia-T plane are obtained. It indicates that the temperature ramp-down can completely suppress flux jumps without compromising Jc at high magnetic fields. Importantly, this method does not require modifications to the superconducting microstructures or fabrication process, offering a practical and broadly applicable solution. The findings not only provide a robust method for stabilizing various superconducting magnet systems, including high-temperature superconducting magnets wound with second-generated (2G) coated tapes, but also suggest a generalizable strategy for controlling instability in other nonlinear non-equilibrium physical systems.

Title: General Hamiltonian description of nonreciprocal interactions
Authors: Yu-Bo Shi, Roderich Moessner, Ricard Alert, Marin Bukov
Abstract: In a vast class of systems, which includes members as diverse as active colloids and bird flocks, interactions do not stem from a potential, and are in general nonreciprocal. Thus, it is not possible to define a conventional energy function, nor to use analytical or numerical tools that rely on it. Here, we overcome these limitations by constructing a Hamiltonian that includes auxiliary degrees of freedom; when subject to a constraint, this Hamiltonian yields the original non-reciprocal dynamics. We show that Glauber dynamics based on the constrained Hamiltonian reproduces the steady states of the original Langevin dynamics, as we explicitly illustrate for dissipative XY spins with vision-cone interactions. Further, the symplectic structure inherent to our construction allows us to apply the well-developed notions of Hamiltonian engineering, which we demonstrate by varying the amplitude of a periodic drive to tune the spin interactions between those of a square and a chain lattice geometry. Overall, our framework for generic nonreciprocal pairwise interactions paves the way for bringing to bear the full conceptual and methodological power of conventional statistical mechanics and Hamiltonian dynamics to nonreciprocal systems.

Title: Engineering Morphologies of Metal Colloidal Assemblies via Colloid Jamming at Liquid-Liquid Interfaces
Authors: Jiyuan Yao, Shuting Xie, Shijian Huang, Weilong Xu, Jiaqin Li, Zhenping Liu, Mingliang Jin, Loes I. Segerink, Lingling Shui, Sergii Pud
Abstract: Self-assemblies, structured via nanoparticles, show promise as materials for advanced applications, like photonic devices, electrochemical energy storage units and catalysis support. Despite observing diverse morphologies, a comprehensive understanding of the formation mechanism remains elusive. In this work, we show that the coordination interaction between metal sulfide nanoparticles (MS NPs) and the fluorosurfactants at the droplet interface influences the morphology during the evaporation-induced self-assembly facilitated by droplet microfluidics. Further investigation into fluorosurfactants with various chemical groups and MS NPs reveals that the strength of coordination interactions significantly influences assembly morphology. The interfacial interactions can be eliminated through coating a SiO2 layer on the metal colloid (M@SiO2 NPs). In addition, we demonstrate that the morphologies of the self-assemblies can be engineered via the coordination interactions between the MS NPs and fluorosurfactants, and by varying the concentrations of MS NPs. Utilizing these interfacial interactions, assemblies with core-shell and homogeneous distribution of binary nanoparticles were constructed. Our findings offer novel insights into the interfacial jamming of nanoparticles at the droplet interface through evaporation-induced self-assembly, and into the design of metal colloidal assemblies with diverse morphologies, crucial for developing novel functional assemblies for catalysis, plasmonic, and porous materials in a controlled manner.

Title: Engineering inter-band coupling in a two-band superconductor by topological defects
Authors: Thomas Gozlinski, Qili Li, Rolf Heid, Oleg Kurnosikov, Alexander Haas, Ryohei Nemoto, Toyo Kazu Yamada, Joerg Schmalian, Wulf Wulfhekel
Abstract: The vast majority of superconductors have more than one Fermi surface, on which the electrons pair below the critical temperature TC, yet their superconducting behavior can be well described by a single-band Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory. This is mostly due to inter-band scattering, especially in superconductors in the dirty limit, rigidly linking the pairing amplitude of the different bands. This effect has severely limited experimental studies of the complex physics of multi-band superconductivity. In this study, we utilize the fact that elementary Pb - as a clean limit system - has two Fermi surfaces that are only weakly coupled by inter-band scattering, allowing the formation of two separate condensates. By studying elementary crystal defects in the form of stacking faults with our millikelvin scanning tunneling microscope, we show how to locally tune inter-band coupling ranging from weak to strong coupling and modify the superconducting order parameters around defects. The experiments critically test the theory of multi-band superconductors and give a route to access a wide range of predicted quantum effects in these systems.

Title: Many-body interference at the onset of chaos
Authors: Eric Brunner, Lukas Pausch, Edoardo G. Carnio, Gabriel Dufour, Alberto Rodríguez, Andreas Buchleitner
Abstract: We unveil the signature of many-body interference across dynamical regimes of the Bose-Hubbard model. Increasing the particles' indistinguishability enhances the temporal fluctuations of few-body observables, with a dramatic amplification at the onset of quantum chaos. By resolving the exchange symmetries of partially distinguishable particles, we explain this amplification as the fingerprint of the initial state's coherences in the eigenbasis.

Title: Martinize2 and Vermouth: Unified Framework for Topology Generation
Authors: Peter C. Kroon, Fabian Grünewald, Jonathan Barnoud, Marco van Tilburg, Chris Brasnett, Paulo C. T. Souza, Tsjerk A. Wassenaar, Siewert-Jan Marrink
Abstract: Ongoing advances in force field and computer hardware development enable the use of molecular dynamics (MD) to simulate increasingly complex systems with the ultimate goal of reaching cellular complexity. At the same time, rational design by high-throughput (HT) simulations is another forefront of MD. In these areas, the Martini coarse-grained force field, especially the latest version (i.e. v3), is being actively explored because it offers an enhanced spatial-temporal resolution. However, the automation tools for preparing simulations with the Martini force field, accompanying the previous version, were not designed for HT simulations or studies of complex cellular systems. Therefore, they become a major limiting factor. To address these shortcomings, we present the open-source Vermouth python library. Vermouth is designed to become the unified framework for developing programs, which prepare, run, and analyze Martini simulations of complex systems. To demonstrate the power of the Vermouth library, the Martinize2 program is showcased as a generalization of the martinize script, originally aimed to set up simulations of proteins. In contrast to the previous version, Martinize2 automatically handles protonation states in proteins and post-translation modifications, offers more options to fine-tune structural biases such as the elastic network (EN), and can convert non-protein molecules such as ligands. Finally, Martinize2 is used in two high-complexity benchmarks. The entire I-TASSER protein template database as well as a subset of 200,000 structures from the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database are converted to CG resolution and we illustrate how the checks on input structure quality can safeguard high-throughput applications.

Title: Degenerate flat bands in twisted bilayer graphene
Authors: Simon Becker, Tristan Humbert, Maciej Zworski
Abstract: We prove that in the chiral limit of the Bistritzer--MacDonald Hamiltonian, there exist magic angles at which the Hamiltonian exhibits flat bands of multiplicity four instead of two. We analyse the structure of Bloch functions associated with the bands of arbitrary multiplicity, compute the corresponding Chern number to be $ -1 $, and show that there exist infinitely many degenerate magic angles for a generic choice of tunnelling potential, including the Bistritzer--MacDonald potential. Moreover, we demonstrate for generic tunnelling potentials flat bands have only twofold or fourfold multiplicities.

Title: Particle exchange statistics beyond fermions and bosons
Authors: Zhiyuan Wang, Kaden R. A. Hazzard
Abstract: It is commonly believed that there are only two types of particle exchange statistics in quantum mechanics, fermions and bosons, with the exception of anyons in two dimension. In principle, a second exception known as parastatistics, which extends outside of two dimensions, has been considered but was believed to be physically equivalent to fermions and bosons. In this paper we show that nontrivial parastatistics inequivalent to either fermions or bosons can exist in physical systems. These new types of identical particles obey generalized exclusion principles, leading to exotic free-particle thermodynamics distinct from any system of free fermions and bosons. We formulate our theory by developing a second quantization of paraparticles, which naturally includes exactly solvable non-interacting theories, and incorporates physical constraints such as locality. We then construct a family of exactly solvable quantum spin models in one and two dimensions where free paraparticles emerge as quasiparticle excitations, and their exchange statistics can be physically observed and is notably distinct from fermions and bosons. This demonstrates the possibility of a new type of quasiparticle in condensed matter systems, and, more speculatively, the potential for previously unconsidered types of elementary particles.

Title: Observation of disorder-induced boundary localization
Authors: Bing-bing Wang, Zheyu Cheng, Hong-yu Zou, Yong Ge, Ke-qi Zhao, Qiao-rui Si, Shou-qi Yuan, Hong-xiang Sun, Haoran Xue, Baile Zhang
Abstract: Bloch wavefunctions in crystals experience localization within the bulk when disorder is introduced, a phenomenon commonly known as Anderson localization. This effect is considered universal, being applicable to all types of waves, quantum or classical. However, the interaction between disorder and topology -- a concept that has profoundly transformed many branches of physics -- necessitates revisiting the original Anderson localization picture. For instance, in the recently discovered topological Anderson insulator, the introduction of disorder induces topological boundary states that can resist localization due to protection from line-gap topology. While line-gap topology applies to both Hermitian and non-Hermitian systems, non-Hermitian systems uniquely exhibit point-gap topology, which has no Hermitian counterparts and leads to the non-Hermitian skin effect. Here, we experimentally demonstrate disorder-induced point-gap topology in a non-Hermitian acoustic crystal. This crystal, with non-Hermitian disorder in nearest-neighbor couplings, exhibits the non-Hermitian skin effect, where all eigenstates localize at a boundary. Interestingly, the boundary where localization occurs -- either the left or right -- depends on the strength of the disorder. As the disorder strength increases, the direction of boundary localization can be reversed. Additionally, we observe a ``bipolar" skin effect, where boundary localization occurs at both the left and right boundaries when disorder is introduced in next-nearest-neighbor couplings. These findings experimentally reveal a non-Hermitian mechanism of disorder-induced localization that goes beyond the conventional framework of Anderson localization.

Title: Realizing non-trivial doublon formation using a quantum computer
Authors: Biswajit Paul, Tapan Mishra
Abstract: Dynamical formation of doublons or onsite repulsively bound pairs of particles on a lattice is a highly non-trivial phenomenon. In this work, we show the signatures of doublon formation in a quantum computer by simulating the continuous time quantum walk in the framework of the one dimensional extended Fermi-Hubbard model. By considering two up-component and one down-component particles initially created at the three neighbouring sites at the middle of the lattice and allowing intra- (inter-) component nearest neighbour (onsite) interactions we show the formation a stable onsite doublon in the quantum walk. The probability of such doublon formation is more (less) if the hopping strength of the down particle is weaker (stronger) compared to the up particle. On the contrary, for an initial doublon along with a free up particle, the stability of the doublon is more prominent than the doublon dissociation in the dynamics irrespective of the hopping asymmetry between the two components. We first numerically obtain the signatures of the stable doublon formation in the dynamics and then observe them using Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices.

Title: Gibbs-preserving operations requiring infinite amount of quantum coherence
Authors: Hiroyasu Tajima, Ryuji Takagi
Abstract: Gibbs-preserving operations have been studied as one of the standard free processes in quantum thermodynamics. Although they admit a simple mathematical structure, their operational significance has been unclear due to the potential hidden cost to implement them using an operatioanlly motivated class of operations, such as thermal operations. Here, we show that this hidden cost can be infinite -- we present a family of Gibbs-preserving operations that cannot be implemented by thermal operations aided by any finite amount of quantum coherence. Our result implies that there are uncountably many Gibbs-preserving operations that require unbounded thermodynamic resources to implement, raising a question about employing Gibbs-preserving operations as available thermodynamics processes. This finding is a consequence of the general lower bounds we provide for the coherence cost of approximately implementing a certain class of Gibbs-preserving operations with a desired accuracy. We find that our lower bound is almost tight, identifying a quantity -- related to the energy change caused by the channel to implement -- as a fundamental quantifier characterizing the coherence cost for the approximate implementation of Gibbs-preserving operations.

Title: From Single Genes to Populations: Quantifying Broken Detailed Balance in Transcription
Authors: James Holehouse
Abstract: Are there thermodynamic or information theoretic constraints governing mRNA expression? Here we use the framework of stochastic thermodynamics to assess detailed balance breaking in transcription. For the canonical two-state model of transcription, we derive exact analytic expressions for the entropy production rate of transcription at steady state, expressions that can be evaluated from knowledge of the kinetic parameters of the two-state model. This allows us to easily evaluate the entropy production rate of thousands of genes across seven datasets of two-state model parameters without needing to evaluate the entropy production rate from trajectory-based computation. A data-driven approach then exposes that most genes avoid parameter regimes associated with large entropy production rates, akin to a mesoscopic version of energy expenditure minimization. Importantly, we show that this is not a thermodynamic phenomenon, since the entropy production rate from the two state gene model provides only a weak bound on the housekeeping energy needed to power transcription. Finally, we show that cell-to-cell variability can make mRNA expression seem more or less irreversible than a ``representative cell'' would imply. Overall, our study presents a theoretical and data-driven approach to uncovering the potential thermodynamic and information theoretic constraints that dictate observed behaviors in transcription.

Title: Cover times with stochastic resetting
Authors: Samantha Linn, Sean D Lawley
Abstract: Cover times quantify the speed of exhaustive search. In this work, we compute exactly the mean cover time associated with a one-dimensional Brownian search under exponentially distributed resetting. We also approximate the moments of cover times of a wide range of stochastic search processes in $d$-dimensional continuous space and on an arbitrary discrete network under frequent stochastic resetting. These results hold for a large class of resetting time distributions and search processes including diffusion and Markov jump processes.

Title: Global decomposition of networks into multiple cores formed by local hubs
Authors: Wonhee Jeong, Unjong Yu, Sang Hoon Lee
Abstract: Networks are ubiquitous in various fields, representing systems where nodes and their interconnections constitute their intricate structures. We introduce a network decomposition scheme to reveal multiscale core-periphery structures lurking inside, using the concept of locally defined nodal hub centrality and edge-pruning techniques built upon it. We demonstrate that the hub-centrality-based edge pruning reveals a series of breaking points in network decomposition, which effectively separates a network into its backbone and shell structures. Our local-edge decomposition method iteratively identifies and removes locally least connected nodes, and uncovers an onion-like hierarchical structure as a result. Compared with the conventional $k$-core decomposition method, our method based on relative information residing in local structures exhibits a clear advantage in terms of discovering locally crucial substructures. As an application of the method, we present a scheme to detect multiple core-periphery structures and the decomposition of coarse-grained supernode networks, by combining the method with the network community detection.

Title: Pfaffian structure of the eigenvector overlap for the symplectic Ginibre ensemble
Authors: Gernot Akemann, Sung-Soo Byun, Kohei Noda
Abstract: We study the integrable structure and scaling limits of the conditioned eigenvector overlap of the symplectic Ginibre ensemble of Gaussian non-Hermitian random matrices with independent quaternion elements. The average of the overlap matrix elements constructed from left and right eigenvectors, conditioned to $x$, are derived in terms of a Pfaffian determinant. Regarded as a two-dimensional Coulomb gas with the Neumann boundary condition along the real axis, it contains a kernel of skew-orthogonal polynomials with respect to the weight function $\omega^{(\mathrm{over})}(z)=|z-\overline{x}|^2(1+|z-x|^2)e^{-2|z|^2}$, including a non-trivial insertion of a point charge. The mean off-diagonal overlap is related to the diagonal (self-)overlap by a transposition, in analogy to the complex Ginibre ensemble. For $x$ conditioned to the real line, extending previous results at $x=0$, we determine the skew-orthogonal polynomials and their skew-kernel with respect to $\omega^{(\mathrm{over})}(z)$. This is done in two steps and involves a Christoffel perturbation of the weight $\omega^{(\mathrm{over})}(z)=|z-\overline{x}|^2\omega^{(\mathrm{pre})}(z)$, by computing first the corresponding quantities for the unperturbed weight $\omega^{(\mathrm{pre})}(z)$. Its kernel is shown to satisfy a differential equation at finite matrix size $N$. This allows us to take different large-$N$ limits, where we distinguish bulk and edge regime along the real axis. The limiting mean diagonal overlaps and corresponding eigenvalue correlation functions of the point processes with respect to $\omega^{(\mathrm{over})}(z)$ are determined. We also examine the effect on the planar orthogonal polynomials when changing the variance in $\omega^{(\mathrm{pre})}(z)$, as this appears in the eigenvector statistics of the complex Ginibre ensemble.

Title: Hopf algebras and solvable unitary circuits
Authors: Zhiyuan Wang
Abstract: Exactly solvable models in quantum many body dynamics provide valuable insights into many interesting physical phenomena, and serve as platforms to rigorously investigate fundamental theoretical questions. Nevertheless, they are extremely rare and existing solvable models and solution techniques have serious limitations. In this paper we introduce a new family of exactly solvable unitary circuits which model quantum many body dynamics in discrete space and time. Unlike many previous solvable models, one can exactly compute the full quantum dynamics initialized from any matrix product state in this new family of models. The time evolution of local observables and correlations, the linear growth of Renyi entanglement entropy, spatiotemporal correlations, and out-of-time-order correlations are all exactly computable. A key property of these models enabling the exact solution is that any time evolved local operator is an exact matrix product operator with finite bond dimension, even at arbitrarily long time, which we prove using the underlying (weak) Hopf algebra structure along with tensor network techniques. We lay down the general framework for the construction and solution of this family of models, and give several explicit examples. In particular, we study in detail a model constructed out of a weak Hopf algebra that is very close to a floquet version of the PXP model, and the exact results we obtain may shed light on the phenomenon of quantum many body scars, and more generally, floquet quantum dynamics in constrained systems.

Title: Observable Measurement-Induced Transitions
Authors: Aleksei Khindanov, Igor L. Aleiner, Lara Faoro, Lev B. Ioffe
Abstract: One of the main postulates of quantum mechanics is that measurements destroy quantum coherence (wave function collapse). Recently it was discovered that in a many-body system dilute local measurements still preserve some coherence across the entire system. As the measurement density is increased, a phase transition occurs that is characterized by the disentanglement of different parts of the system. Unfortunately, this transition is impossible to observe experimentally for macroscopic systems because it requires an exponentially costly full tomography of the many-body wave function or a comparison with the simulation on an oracle classical computer. In this work we report the discovery of another measurement-induced phase transition that can be observed experimentally if quantum dynamics can be reversed. On one side of this phase transition the quantum information encoded in some part of the Hilbert space is fully recovered after the time inversion. On the other side, all quantum information is corrupted. This transition also manifests itself as the change in the behavior of the probability to observe the same measurement outcome in the process that consists of identical blocks repeated many times. In each block the unitary evolution is followed by the measurement. On one side of the transition the probability decreases exponentially with the number of repetitions, on the other it tends to a constant as the number of repetitions is increased. We confirm the existence of the proposed phase transition through numerical simulations of realistic quantum circuits and analytical calculations using an effective random-matrix theory model.

Title: Discrete distributions are learnable from metastable samples
Authors: Abhijith Jayakumar, Andrey Y. Lokhov, Sidhant Misra, Marc Vuffray
Abstract: Physically motivated stochastic dynamics are often used to sample from high-dimensional distributions. However such dynamics often get stuck in specific regions of their state space and mix very slowly to the desired stationary state. This causes such systems to approximately sample from a metastable distribution which is usually quite different from the desired, stationary distribution of the dynamic. We rigorously show that, in the case of multi-variable discrete distributions, the true model describing the stationary distribution can be recovered from samples produced from a metastable distribution under minimal assumptions about the system. This follows from a fundamental observation that the single-variable conditionals of metastable distributions that satisfy a strong metastability condition are on average close to those of the stationary distribution. This holds even when the metastable distribution differs considerably from the true model in terms of global metrics like Kullback-Leibler divergence or total variation distance. This property allows us to learn the true model using a conditional likelihood based estimator, even when the samples come from a metastable distribution concentrated in a small region of the state space. Explicit examples of such metastable states can be constructed from regions that effectively bottleneck the probability flow and cause poor mixing of the Markov chain. For specific cases of binary pairwise undirected graphical models (i.e. Ising models), we extend our results to further rigorously show that data coming from metastable states can be used to learn the parameters of the energy function and recover the structure of the model.

Title: Inhomogeneous SU(2) symmetries in homogeneous integrable U(1) circuits and transport
Authors: Marko Znidaric
Abstract: Symmetries are important for understanding equilibrium as well as nonequilibrium properties like transport. In translationally invariant extended systems one might expect symmetry generators to also be homogeneous. Studying qubit circuits with nearest-neighbor U(1) gates we show that this needs not be the case. We find new inhomogeneous screw SU(2) and ${\rm U}_q({\rm sl}_2)$ symmetries whose generators exhibit a spatial quasi-momentum modulation. They can be viewed as a parameter-dependent generalization of the standard rotational symmetry of the Heisenberg model and can be identified by the Ruelle-Pollicott spectrum of a momentum-resolved propagator. Rich integrability structure is reflected also in transport: picking an arbitrary U(1) gate and varying the gate duration one will transition through different phases, including fractal ballistic transport, Kardar-Parisi-Zhang superdiffusion at the critical manifold that also contains helix states, diffusion, and localization. To correctly explain transport the non-local SU(2) symmetries do not matter, while the inhomogeneous local ones that almost commute with the propagator do.

Title: Omnidirectional shuttling to avoid valley excitations in Si/SiGe quantum wells
Authors: Róbert Németh, Vatsal K. Bandaru, Pedro Alves, Merritt P. Losert, Emma Brann, Owen M. Eskandari, Hudaiba Soomro, Avani Vivrekar, M. A. Eriksson, Mark Friesen
Abstract: Conveyor-mode shuttling is a key approach for implementing intermediate-range coupling between electron-spin qubits in quantum dots. Initial implementations are encouraging; however, long shuttling trajectories are guaranteed to encounter regions of low conduction-band valley energy splittings, due to the presence of random-alloy disorder in Si/SiGe quantum wells. Here, we theoretically explore two schemes for avoiding valley-state excitations at these valley-splitting minima, by allowing the electrons to detour around them. A multichannel shuttling scheme allows electrons to tunnel between parallel channels, while a two-dimensional (2D) shuttler provides full omnidirectional control. Using simulations, we estimate shuttling fidelities in these two schemes, obtaining a clear preference for the 2D shuttler. Based on such encouraging results, we propose a full qubit architecture based on 2D shuttling, which enables all-to-all connectivity within qubit plaquettes and high-fidelity communication between different plaquettes.

Title: Gauging or extending bulk and boundary conformal field theories: Application to bulk and domain wall problem in topological matter and their descriptions by (mock) modular covariant
Authors: Yoshiki Fukusumi
Abstract: We study gauging operations (or group extensions) in (smeared) boundary conformal field theories (BCFTs) and bulk conformal field theories and their applications to various phenomena in topologically ordered systems. We apply the resultant theories to the correspondence between the renormalization group (RG) flow of CFTs and the classification of topological quantum field theories in the testable information of general classes of partition functions. One can obtain the bulk topological properties of $2+1$ dimensional topological ordered phase corresponding to the massive RG flow of $1+1$ dimensional systems, or smeared BCFT. We present an obstruction of mass condensation for smeared BCFT analogous to the Lieb-Shultz-Mattis theorem for noninvertible symmetry. Related to the bulk topological degeneracies in $2+1$ dimensions and quantum phases in $1+1$ dimensions we construct a new series of BCFT. We also investigate the implications of the massless RG flow of $1+1$ dimensional CFT to $2+1$ dimensional topological order which corresponds to the earlier proposal by L. Kong and H. Zheng in [Nucl. Phys. B 966 (2021), 115384], arXiv:1912.01760 closely related to the integer-spin simple current by Schellekens and Gato-Rivera. We study the properties of the product of two CFTs connected by the two kinds of massless flows. The (mock) modular covariants appearing in the analysis seem to contain new ones. By applying the folding trick to the coupled model, we provide a general method to solve the gapped and charged domain wall. One can obtain the general phenomenology of the transportation of anyons through the domain wall. Our work gives a unified direction for the future theoretical and numerical studies of the topological phase based on the established data of classifications of conformal field theories or modular invariants.

Title: Auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo method with seniority-zero trial wave function
Authors: Yuichiro Yoshida, Luca Erhart, Takuma Murokoshi, Rika Nakagawa, Chihiro Mori, Hanae Tagami, Wataru Mizukami
Abstract: We present an approach that uses the doubly occupied configuration interaction (DOCI) wave function as the trial wave function in phaseless auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (ph-AFQMC). DOCI is a seniority-zero method focused on electron pairs. Although DOCI considers much fewer electron configurations than the complete active space (CAS) configuration interaction method, it efficiently captures the static correlation, while the consequent ph-AFQMC recovers the dynamical correlation across all orbitals. We also explore an orbital-optimized version (OO-DOCI) to further improve accuracy. We test this approach on several chemical systems, including single O-H bond breaking in water and polymer additives. In these cases, OO-DOCI-AFQMC closely matches CAS-based ph-AFQMC and even outperforms coupled-cluster singles, doubles, and perturbative triples. However, for strongly correlated systems, such as the carbon dimer and multi-bond dissociation in hydrogen systems and water, the method's accuracy drops. This suggests that seniority-zero space models may be insufficient as trial wave functions in ph-AFQMC for strongly correlated systems, suggesting the need for trial wave functions in an extended space. Despite such a limitation, our study demonstrates that DOCI- and OO-DOCI-based ph-AFQMC can reduce the steep cost of CAS approaches, offering a path to accurate multi-reference calculations for larger, more complex systems.

Title: Excited States of the Uniform Electron Gas
Authors: Pierre-François Loos
Abstract: The uniform electron gas (UEG) is a cornerstone of density-functional theory (DFT) and the foundation of the local-density approximation (LDA), one of the most successful approximations in DFT. In this work, we extend the concept of UEG by introducing excited-state UEGs, systems characterized by a gap at the Fermi surface created by the excitation of electrons near the Fermi level. We report closed-form expressions of the reduced kinetic and exchange energies of these excited-state UEGs as functions of the density and the gap. Additionally, we derive the leading term of the correlation energy in the high-density limit. By incorporating an additional variable representing the degree of excitation into the UEG paradigm, the present work introduces a new framework for constructing local and semi-local state-specific functionals for excited states.

Title: The Ising model as a window on quantum gravity with matter
Authors: Romuald A. Janik
Abstract: We argue that the Ising model CFT can be used to obtain some clear insights into 3D (quantum) gravity with matter. We review arguments for the existence of its holographic description, and concentrate on the time dependence of perturbations of the theory at high temperature, which would correspond to throwing matter into a black hole in the dual picture. Apart from an expected QNM-like exponential damping, we observe a plateau, a burst and a subsequent re-emergence of the whole signal, the latter being apparently at odds with a black hole interpretation. We provide an explanation of this phenomenon in terms of the properties of bulk matter fields interacting with the BTZ black hole and the fact that the geometry/metric is not fundamental but a derived quantity in the Chern-Simons formulation of 3D gravity. This allows for evading the black hole information paradox in the present context.

Title: Universal analytical modeling of coated plasmonic particles
Authors: Nikolai G. Khlebtsov, Sergey V. Zarkov
Abstract: From a structural point of view, plasmonic nanoparticles are always at least two-layer structures with a dielectric layer of stabilizing, targeting, fluorescent, Raman, or other functional molecules. To optimize the optical properties of such bioconjugates, one needs efficient analytical models based on simple physical ideas and with reasonable accuracy comparable to rigorous numerical methods requiring significant computer resources. Recently, we suggested an analytical approach based on a combination of the modal expansion method (MEM) and the dipole equivalence method (DEM). Here, we extend the MEM+DEM approach for particles of various shapes and orientations. To illustrate the possibilities of our method, we calculate extinction and scattering spectra of gold and silver nanorods, nanodiscs, triangle nanoprisms, bicones, and bipyramids with a dielectric coating thickness from 0 to 100 nm. For the main plasmonic peaks, we found excellent agreement between our analytical method and numerical simulations performed with COMSOL, except for some disagreement between MEM and COMSOL solutions for bicones with small rounding radii. To illustrate the application of our method, we prepared 12 AuNR samples using a chemical etching with fine tuning of the LPR over the 1020-580 nm range. By including the CTAB shell in the simulation model, we achieved excellent agreement between the calculated and measured dependence of the LPR peak position on the AuNR aspect ratio. In summary, our method uses the MEM parameters of the original metal particles and does not require additional numerical calculations to build analytical models for bilayered or multilayered conjugates. Due to the simplicity and reasonable accuracy analytical models, they can help apply machine learning to predict various plasmonic responses such as light absorption, scattering, SERS, and metal-enhanced fluorescence.

Title: Silk: A promising natural blend of amino acids for efficient CO2 capture
Authors: Md Sariful Sheikh, Lijie Guo, Qiyuan Chen, Bu Wang
Abstract: In recent years, various nanoporous solid sorbents have drawn significant research interest as promising carbon capture materials. However, the issues of high synthesis cost, limited CO2 adsorption capacity, slow adsorption-desorption kinetics, high sorbent regeneration temperature, and poor operational stability remain challenges to overcome before their practical implementation. In contrast, natural silk-fibroin, a blend of various amino acids, could be a promising material to realize low-cost carbon capture technology due to its amine-like CO2 capture behavior, light weight, natural abundance, scalable processing, and biocompatibility. Here, we present mulberry silk-derived silk-nano-fibroin aerogel that exhibits a high specific surface area and a remarkably high CO2 adsorption capacity (~3.65+-0.18 mmol CO2/gm sorbent at 0.15 atm CO2 and 5 oC), making it competitive with state-of-the-art solid sorbents. The thermogravimetry analysis reveals that the thermal degradation temperature of silk-nano-fibroin aerogel is around 250 °C, significantly higher than conventional amines used for carbon capture. Furthermore, the silk-nano-fibroin-based sorbent demonstrates rapid adsorption-desorption kinetics, complete regeneration at a temperature as low as 60 °C, promising stability over multiple adsorption-desorption cycles, and maintains its adsorption capacity under humid conditions. Overall, this study highlights natural silk's promising carbon capture potential for further exploration.

Title: Kelvin-Wave-Inspired Optical Vortex Excitation in Kerr Nonlinear Media
Authors: Yosuke Minowa, Nobuhiko Yokoshi, Makoto Tsubota
Abstract: We demonstrate a direct one-to-one correspondence between nonlinear optical fields in defocusing Kerr media and wave functions in weakly interacting Bose-Einstein condensates or quantum fluids. Based on this correspondence, we propose the existence of excitations in an optical vortex beam characterized by a helical deformation of its phase singularity core. These excitations are direct analogues of Kelvin waves known in quantum and classical fluid dynamics. We further show that the excitations exhibit two distinct branches, one of which includes a stationary solution. A feasible experimental scheme for generating these excitations is also discussed.

Title: Quantum thermodynamics and semi-definite optimization
Authors: Nana Liu, Michele Minervini, Dhrumil Patel, Mark M. Wilde
Abstract: In quantum thermodynamics, a system is described by a Hamiltonian and a list of non-commuting charges representing conserved quantities like particle number or electric charge, and an important goal is to determine the system's minimum energy in the presence of these conserved charges. In optimization theory, a semi-definite program (SDP) involves a linear objective function optimized over the cone of positive semi-definite operators intersected with an affine space. These problems arise from differing motivations in the physics and optimization communities and are phrased using very different terminology, yet they are essentially identical mathematically. By adopting Jaynes' mindset motivated by quantum thermodynamics, we observe that minimizing free energy in the aforementioned thermodynamics problem, instead of energy, leads to an elegant solution in terms of a dual chemical potential maximization problem that is concave in the chemical potential parameters. As such, one can employ standard (stochastic) gradient ascent methods to find the optimal values of these parameters, and these methods are guaranteed to converge quickly. At low temperature, the minimum free energy provides an excellent approximation for the minimum energy. We then show how this Jaynes-inspired gradient-ascent approach can be used in both first- and second-order classical and hybrid quantum-classical algorithms for minimizing energy, and equivalently, how it can be used for solving SDPs, with guarantees on the runtimes of the algorithms. The approach discussed here is well grounded in quantum thermodynamics and, as such, provides physical motivation underpinning why algorithms published fifty years after Jaynes' seminal work, including the matrix multiplicative weights update method, the matrix exponentiated gradient update method, and their quantum algorithmic generalizations, perform well at solving SDPs.

Title: Extended Tsallis-Cirto entropy for black and white holes
Authors: G.E. Volovik
Abstract: In reference [1] we considered the black hole thermodynamics with the non-extensive entropy. This entropy obeys the composition rule which coincides with the composition rule in the non-extensive Tsallis-Cirto $\delta=2$ statistics. Here we extend this approach to the thermodynamics of white holes. The entropy of the white hole is negative as follows from the rate of macroscopic quantum tunneling from black hole to white hole. The white hole entropy is with the minus sign the entropy of the black hole with the same mass, $S_{\rm WH}(M)=-S_{\rm BH}(M)$. This reflects the anti-symmetry with respect to time reversal, at which the shift vector in the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner formalism changes sign. This symmetry allows one to extend the Tsallis-Chirto entropy by adding a minus sign to the Tsallis-Chirto formula applied to white hole. As a result, the composition rule remains the same, with the only difference being that instead of entropy it contains the entropy modulus. The same non-extensive composition rule is obtained for the entropy of the Reissner-Nordström black hole. This entropy is formed by the positive entropy of the outer horizon and the negative entropy of the inner horizon. The model of the black hole formed by "black hole atoms" with Planck-scale mass is also extended to include the negative entropy of white holes.

Title: Narrowband, angle-stable, and highly efficient polariton organic light emitting diodes employing thermally activated delayed fluorescence
Authors: Andreas Mischok, Simon Lennartz, Vanessa Gruber, Francisco Tenopala-Carmona, Julia Witt, Sabina Hillebrandt, Malte C. Gather
Abstract: Narrowband emission is crucial for next generation optoelectronic devices to satisfy demands for high color brilliance. Microcavities can narrow emission spectra of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) through the creation of resonant standing waves, independent of emitter material, enabling flexibility in molecular and device design. However, they induce a strong angle-dependence of the perceived emission color. Utilizing strong light-matter coupling of cavity photons with the virtually angle-independent exciton, leads to exciton-polariton emission showing reduced linewidths and suppressed angular dispersion if tuned correctly. Creating polaritons in highly efficient materials such as thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules is however difficult as their low oscillator strengths intrinsically disfavor light-matter interaction. Here, we present the successful combination of a highly efficient but intrinsically broadband TADF emitter with a strongly absorbing assistant strong coupling material in a modified microcavity structure. Through optimizing the assistant strong coupling layer architecture, we demonstrate polariton OLEDs with exceptionally narrowband, angle stable emission at external quantum efficiencies above 20% for both bottom- and top-emitting designs, more than doubling the performance of previous record devices. The results pave the way for utilizing polaritonic emission at practical device efficiencies for display applications.
