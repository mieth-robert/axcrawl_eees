Title: Band Structure and Pairing Nature of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ Thin Film at Ambient Pressure
Authors: Zhi-Yan Shao, Yu-Bo Liu, Min Liu, Fan Yang
Abstract: Recently, evidences of superconductivity with onset temperature $T_c$ above the McMillan limit ($\approx 40$ K) have been detected in the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ ultrathin film grown on the LaSrAlO substrate at ambient pressure. This progress makes it possible to investigate the pairing mechanism in the bilayer nickelates through adopting various experimental tools. Here we perform a first-principle density-functional-theory (DFT) based calculation for the band structure of this nickelate superconductor. The obtained band structure is different from that of the pressurized bulk La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ mainly in that the bonding-$d_{z^2}$ band is pushed far ($\approx$ 0.16 eV) below the Fermi level. Taking the low-energy Ni-$(3d_{z^2},3d_{x^2-y^2})$ orbitals placed on the pseudo-tetragonal lattice structure, we construct a 2D bilayer eight-band tight-binding model which well captures the main features of the DFT band structure. Then considering the multi-orbital Hubbard interaction, we adopt the random-phase approximation approach to investigate the pairing symmetry. The obtained spin susceptibility is maximized at the momentum $Q = (0, 0.86\pi)$ in the folded Brillouin zone, induced by Fermi-surface nesting, leading to interlayer antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation in the diagonal double-stripe pattern similar with that reported for the bulk La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. The leading and subleading pairing symmetries are the $s^{\pm}$ and approximate $d_{xy}$, which are nearly degenerate. Our results appeal for experimental verifications.

Title: Effective longitudinal wave through a random distribution of poroelastic spheres in a poroelastic matrix
Authors: Dossou Gnadjro, Amah Séna d'Almeida
Abstract: A random distribution of poroelastic spheres in a poroelastic medium obeying Biot's theory is considered. The scattering coefficients of the fast and the slow waves are computed in the low frequency limit using the sealed pore boundary conditions. Analytical expressions of the effective wavenumbers of the coherent longitudinal waves (fast and slow) are deduced the Rayleigh limit using a generalization of the Linton-Martin (LM) formula to poroelastic medium up to the order two in concentration. Some effective quantities (mass density, bulk modulus) of the heterogeneous media are estimated.

Abstract: Mechanical stress control is becoming one of the major challenges for the future of micro and nanotechnologies. Micro scanning X-ray diffraction is one of the promising techniques that allows stress characterization in such complex structures at sub micron scales. Two types of MEMS structure have been studied: a bilayer cantilever composed of a gold film deposited on poly-silicon and a boron doped silicon bridge. X-ray diffraction results are discussed in view of numerical simulation experiments.

Title: Realization of tilted Dirac-like microwave cone in superconducting circuit lattices
Authors: Amir Youssefi, Ahmad Motavassal, Shingo Kono, Seyed Akbar Jafari, Tobias J. Kippenberg
Abstract: Dirac-like band crossings are paradigms in condensed matter systems to emulate high-energy physics phenomena. They are associated with two aspects: gap and tilting. The ability to design sign-changing gap gives rise to band topology, whereas the tilting of band crossings which is a gateway for large gravity-like effects remains uncharted. In this work, we introduce an experimental platform to realize tilted Dirac-like microwave cone in large-scale superconducting circuit lattices. The direction and magnitude of the tilt can be controlled by engineering the axially preferred second neighbor coupling. We demonstrate three lattices with 731-site LC resonator featuring tilt values of up to 59% of relative difference in the opposite-direction group velocities. This is obtained by reconstructing the density of states (DOS) of measured microwave resonance frequencies. Harnessing the tilt of Dirac-like band crossings lays the foundation for weaving the fabric of an emergent solid-state spacetime.

Title: Enhancing Cell Characterization via Hydrodynamic Compression in Suspended Microchannel Resonators
Authors: Alberto Martin-Perez, Daniel Ramos
Abstract: Microfluidics offer remarkable flexibility for in-flow analyte characterization and can even measure the mechanical properties of biological cells through the application of hydrodynamic forces. In this work, we present a new approach to enhance the performance of nanomechanical resonators featuring integrated microfluidic channels when they are used as cell sensors by means of applying hydrostatic compressions. For this purpose, we have studied analytically how this kind of compressions affects either the mechanical properties of the resonator as well as the analytes. We found that, depending on factors such as device geometry and material composition, the mass limit of detection of the resonator can be reduced while the buoyant mass of the particles is increased when a hydrostatic compression is applied, improving the performance of the sensor. Furthermore, we demonstrate that applying these hydrostatic compressions induces shifts in mass distributions among cell lines with similar physical properties, which not only potentially enhances the ability to differentiate between these lines, but also opens the door to measure the cell's compressibility, a biophysical parameter of interest with practical diagnostic applications.

Title: Pilot study of electrochemical reduction of selected nucleotides and double-stranded DNA at pristine micro-/ultrananocrystalline boron-doped diamond electrodes at very negative potentials
Authors: Michal Augustín, Vlastimil Vyskočil, Ondrej Szabó, Kateřina Aubrechtová Dragounová, Rene Pfeifer, Frank-Michael Matysik, Jiří Barek, Marián Marton, Alexander Kromka
Abstract: Pristine polycrystalline boron-doped diamond electrodes (BDDEs) -- microcrystalline (B-MCDE) and ultrananocrystalline (B-UNCDE) were applied for the electrochemical reduction of several selected purine nucleotides -- Guanosine 5'-monophosphate (GMP), 2'-Deoxyguanosine 5'-monophosphate (dGMP), Adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP), Adenosine 5'-diphosphate (ADP), Adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP), and pyrimidine nucleotides -- Cytidine 5'-monophosphate (CMP), Thymidine 5'-monophosphate (TMP), as well as low-molecular-weight double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) at very negative potentials via linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). Three different types of electrode surfaces were employed -- "H-terminated" B-MCDE (H-B-MCDE) and "O-terminated" B-MCDE/B-UNCDE (O-B-MCDE/O-B-UNCDE). It was found that electrochemical reduction of all tested analytes (except GMP) is possible at H-B-MCDE. On the other hand, electrochemical reduction of all selected analytes (except dsDNA) is possible at O-B-MCDE/O-B-UNCDE. Ambient oxygen and preadsorption step in the manner of incubation of the corresponding sensor in the analyte solution for 30 s had a profound effect on the repeatability of the results and, in the case of H-B-MCDE, also on the magnitude of voltammetric signals and the possibility of electrochemical reduction of dGMP. The use of the proposed sensors and their main advantages and disadvantages for the voltammetric determination of the tested analytes (demonstrated via electrochemical reduction of AMP) in the presence of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is also discussed.

Title: Evaluating Gaussianity of heterogeneous fractional Brownian motion
Authors: Michał Balcerek, Adrian Pacheco-Pozo, Agnieszka Wyłomańska, Diego Krapf
Abstract: Heterogeneous diffusion processes are prevalent in various fields, including the motion of proteins in living cells, the migratory movement of birds and mammals, and finance. These processes are often characterized by time-varying dynamics, where interactions with the environment evolve, and the system undergoes fluctuations in diffusivity. Moreover, in many complex systems anomalous diffusion is observed, where the mean square displacement (MSD) exhibits non-linear scaling with time. Among the models used to describe this phenomenon, fractional Brownian motion (FBM) is a widely applied stochastic process, particularly for systems exhibiting long-range temporal correlations. Although FBM is characterized by Gaussian increments, heterogeneous processes with FBM-like characteristics may deviate from Gaussianity. In this article, we study the non-Gaussian behavior of switching fractional Brownian motion (SFBM), a model in which the diffusivity of the FBM process varies while temporal correlations are maintained. To characterize non-Gaussianity, we evaluate the kurtosis, a common tool used to quantify deviations from the normal distribution. We derive exact expressions for the kurtosis of the considered heterogeneous anomalous diffusion process and investigate how it can identify non-Gaussian behavior. We also compare the kurtosis results with those obtained using the Hellinger distance, a classical measure of divergence between probability density functions. Through both analytical and numerical methods, we demonstrate the potential of kurtosis as a metric for detecting non-Gaussianity in heterogeneous anomalous diffusion processes.

Title: Rubidium intercalation in epitaxial monolayer graphene
Authors: Letizia Ferbel, Stefano Veronesi, Tevfik Onur Mentes, Lars Buß, Antonio Rossi, Neeraj Mishra, Camilla Coletti, Jan Ingo Flege, Andrea Locatelli, Stefan Heun
Abstract: Alkali metal intercalation of graphene layers has been of particular interest due to potential applications in electronics, energy storage, and catalysis. Rubidium (Rb) is one of the largest alkali metals and the one less investigated as intercalant. Here, we report a systematic investigation, with a multi-technique approach, of the phase formation of Rb under epitaxial monolayer graphene on SiC(0001). We explore a wide phase space with two control parameters: the Rb density (i.e., deposition time) and sample temperature (i.e., room- and low-temperature). We reveal the emergence of $(2 \times 2)$ and $(\sqrt{3} \times \sqrt{3})$R30° structures formed by a single alkali metal layer intercalated between monolayer graphene and the interfacial C-rich reconstructed surface, also known as buffer layer. Rb intercalation also results in a strong n-type doping of the graphene layer. Progressively annealing to high temperatures, we first reveal diffusion of Rb atoms which results in the enlargement of intercalated areas. As desorption sets in, intercalated regions progressively shrink and fragment. Eventually, at approximately 600°C the initial surface is retrieved, indicating the reversibility of the intercalation process.

Title: Driving a Quantum Phase Transition at Arbitrary Rate: Exact solution of the Transverse-Field Ising model
Authors: András Grabarits, Federico Balducci, Adolfo del Campo
Abstract: We study the crossing of the quantum phase transition in the transverse-field Ising model after modulating the magnetic field at an arbitrary rate, exploring the critical dynamics from the slow to the sudden quench regime. We do so by analyzing the defect density, the complete kink number distribution, and its cumulants upon completion of a linearized quench. Our analysis relies on the diagonalization of the model using the standard Jordan-Wigner and Fourier transformations, along with the exact solution of the time evolution in each mode in terms of parabolic cylinder functions. The free-fermion nature of the problem dictates that the kink number distribution is associated with independent and distinguishable Bernoulli variables, each with a success probability $p_k$. We employ a combination of convergent and asymptotic series expansions to characterize $p_k$ without restrictions on the driving rate. When the latter is approximated by the Landau-Zener formula, the kink density is described by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism, and higher-order cumulants follow a universal power-law behavior, as recently predicted theoretically and verified in the laboratory. By contrast, for moderate and sudden driving protocols, the cumulants exhibit a nonuniversal behavior that is not monotonic on the driving rate and changes qualitatively with the cumulant order. The kink number statistics remain sub-Poissonian for any driving rate, as revealed by an analysis of the cumulant rations that vary nonmonotonically from the sudden to the slow-driving regime. Thanks to the determination of $p_k$ for an arbitrary rate, our study provides a complete analytical understanding of kink number statistics from the slow driving regime to the sudden quench limit.

Title: Non-contact quantitative measurement of thermal Hall angle and transverse thermal conductivity by lock-in thermography
Authors: Takumi Imamura, Takamasa Hirai, Koichi Oyanagi, Ryo Iguchi, Kenta Takamori, Satoru Kobayashi, Ken-ichi Uchida
Abstract: We propose and demonstrate a non-contact quantitative measurement method for the thermal Hall effect (THE) based on magnetic-field-modulated lock-in thermography. This method enables visualization of THE-induced temperature change and quantitative estimation of the thermal Hall angle $\theta_{\rm THE}$ by applying periodic magnetic fields to a sample and obtaining the first harmonic response of thermal images. By combining this method with LIT-based measurement techniques for the longitudinal thermal conductivity $\kappa_{xx}$, we also quantify the transverse thermal conductivity $\kappa_{xy}$. We validate our measurement methods by estimating $\theta_{\rm THE}$, $\kappa_{xx}$, and $\kappa_{xy}$ in a ferromagnetic Heusler alloy Co$_2$MnGa slab showing large THE.

Title: Frozonium: Freezing Anharmonicity in Floquet Superconducting Circuits
Authors: Keiran Lewellen, Rohit Mukherjee, Haoyu Guo, Saswata Roy, Valla Fatemi, Debanjan Chowdhury
Abstract: Floquet engineering is a powerful method that can be used to modify the properties of interacting many-body Hamiltonians via the application of periodic time-dependent drives. Here we consider the physics of an inductively shunted superconducting Josephson junction in the presence of Floquet drives in the fluxonium regime and beyond, which we dub the frozonium artificial atom. We find that in the vicinity of special ratios of the drive amplitude and frequency, the many-body dynamics can be tuned to that of an effectively linear bosonic oscillator, with additional nonlinear corrections that are suppressed in higher powers of the drive frequency. By analyzing the inverse participation ratios between the time-evolved frozonium wavefunctions and the eigenbasis of a linear oscillator, we demonstrate the ability to achieve a novel dynamical control using a combination of numerical exact diagonalization and Floquet-Magnus expansion. We discuss the physics of resonances between quasi-energy states induced by the drive, and ways to mitigate their effects. We also highlight the enhanced protection of frozonium against external sources of noise present in experimental setups. This work lays the foundation for future applications in quantum memory and bosonic quantum control using superconducting circuits.

Title: Quantitative Theory for Critical Conditions of Like-Charge Attraction Between Polarizable Spheres
Authors: Yanyu Duan, Zecheng Gan
Abstract: Despite extensive experimental and theoretical efforts, a concise quantitative theory to predict the occurrence of like-charge attraction (LCA) between polarizable spheres remains elusive. In this work, we first derive a novel three-point image formula, based on a key observation that connects the classical Neumann's image principle with the incomplete beta function. This approach naturally yields simple yet precise critical conditions for LCA, with a relative discrepancy of less than $1\%$ compared to numerical simulations, validated across diverse parameter settings. The obtained critical conditions may provide physical insights into various processes potentially involving LCA, such as self-assembly, crystallization, and phase separation across different length scales. Additionally, the new image formula is directly applicable to enhance the efficiency of polarizable force field calculations involving polarizable spheres.

Title: Thermalization in Quantum Fluids of Light: A Convection-Diffusion Equation
Authors: Vladislav Yu. Shishkov, Ivan V. Panyukov, Evgeny S. Andrianov, Anton V. Zasedatelev
Abstract: We develop a microscopic theory for the dynamics of quantum fluids of light, deriving an effective kinetic equation in momentum space that takes the form of the convection-diffusion equation. In the particular case of two-dimensional systems with parabolic dispersion, it reduces to the Bateman--Burgers equation. The hydrodynamic analogy unifies nonlinear wave phenomena, such as shock wave formation and turbulence, with non-equilibrium Bose--Einstein condensation of photons and polaritons in optical cavities. We introduce the Reynolds number $(\textit{Re})$ and demonstrate that the condensation threshold corresponds exactly to a critical Reynolds number of unity $(\textit{Re}=1)$, beyond which $(\textit{Re} > 1)$ a shock-like front emerges in the momentum space, characterized by the Bose--Einstein distribution for the particle density in states with high momentum.

Title: Amorphous silicon structures generated using a moment tensor potential and the activation relaxation technique nouveau
Authors: Karim Zongo, Hao Sun, Claudiane Ouellet-Plamondon, Normand Mousseau, Laurent Karim Béland
Abstract: Preparing realistic atom-scale models of amorphous silicon (a-Si) is a decades-old condensed matter physics challenge. Herein, we combine the Activation Relaxation Technique nouveau (ARTn) to a Moment Tensor Potential (MTP) to generate seven a-Si models containing between 216 and 4096 atoms. A thorough analysis of their short-range and medium-range structural properties is performed, alongside assessments of excess energy and mechanical properties. The seven ARTn-MTP models are compared with available experimental data and other high quality a-Si models present in the literature. The seven ARTn-MTP a-Si models are in excellent agreement with available experimental data. Notably, several of our models, including the 216-atom, 512-atom, and 1000-atom a-Si models, exhibit low coordination defects without any traces of crystalline grains. Historically overlooked in previous research, our study underlines the need to assess the validity of the continuous random-network hypothesis for the description of perfect amorphous model by characterizing local crystalline environment and to explore the crystallisation process of a-Si through modelling.

Title: Polymer-based solid-state electrolytes for lithium sulfur batteries
Authors: Praveen Balaji T, Soumyadip Choudhury, Ernesto E. Marinero
Abstract: Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries offer substantial theoretical energy density gains over Li-ion bat-teries, a crucial factor for transportation electrification. In addition, sulfur is an earth-abundant, inexpensive material obtainable from multiple resources; thus, Li-S batteries are envisioned to provide environmentally sustainable solutions to the growing demand for energy storage. A crit-ical roadblock to the realization of commercial Li-S batteries is the formation of polysulfides and their secondary reactions with liquid organic electrolytes, resulting in low coulombic efficiency for charging and fast self-discharge rates. The realization of solid-state electrolytes for Li-S bat-teries provides potential pathways to address the safety concerns of liquid electrolytes and inhib-it the formation of polysulfides and/or prevent their diffusion into the anode electrode. However, current solid-state electrolytes are limited by low ionic conductivity, inadequate electrode inter-facial compatibility, and restricted electrochemical windows. This review discusses the status of polymer-based electrolytes for Li-S batteries, and outlines current methods for their fabrication, their transport characteristics and ongoing research aimed at overcoming material properties hindering the development of all-solid-state Li-S batteries.

Title: Properties of two level systems in current-carrying superconductors
Authors: T. Liu, A. V. Andreev, B. Z. Spivak
Abstract: At low temperatures, the physical properties of disordered solids are dominated by two-level systems (TLS). We show that in disordered superconductors, at sufficiently low frequencies $\omega$, the coupling of TLS to external ac electric fields increases dramatically in the presence of a dc supercurrent. This giant enhancement manifests in all ac linear and nonlinear phenomena. In particular, it leads to a parametric enhancement of the real part of the ac conductivity and, consequently, of the equilibrium current fluctuations. If the distribution of TLS relaxation times is broad, the conductivity is inversely proportional to $\omega$, and the spectrum of the equilibrium current fluctuations takes the form of 1/f noise.

Title: Effects of particle elongation on dense granular flows down a rough inclined plane
Authors: Jixiong Liu, Lu Jing, Thomas Pähtz, Yifei Cui, Gordon G. D. Zhou, Xudong Fu
Abstract: Granular materials in nature are nearly always non-spherical, but particle shape effects in granular flow remain largely elusive. This study uses discrete element method simulations to investigate how elongated particle shapes affect the mobility of dense granular flows down a rough incline. For a range of systematically varied particle length-to-diameter aspect ratios (AR), we run simulations with various flow thicknesses $h$ and slope angles $\theta$ to extract the well-known $h_\textrm{stop}(\theta)$ curves (below which the flow ceases) and the $Fr$-$h/h_\textrm{stop}$ relations following Pouliquen's approach, where $Fr=u/\sqrt{gh}$ is the Froude number, $u$ is the mean flow velocity, and $g$ is the gravitational acceleration. The slope $\beta$ of the $Fr$-$h/h_\textrm{stop}$ relations shows an intriguing S-shaped dependence on AR, with two plateaus at small and large AR, respectively, transitioning with a sharp increase. We understand this S-shaped dependence by examining statistics of particle orientation, alignment, and hindered rotation. We find that the rotation ability of weakly elongated particles ($\textrm{AR}\lesssim1.3$) remains similar to spheres, leading to the first plateau in the $\beta$-AR relation, whereas the effects of particle orientation saturates beyond $\textrm{AR}\approx2.0$, explaining the second plateau. An empirical sigmoidal function is proposed to capture this non-linear dependence. The findings are expected to enhance our understanding of how particle shape affects the flow of granular materials from both the flow- and particle-scale perspectives.

Title: Unified Flow Rule of Undeveloped and Fully Developed Dense Granular Flows Down Rough Inclines
Authors: Yanbin Wu, Thomas Pähtz, Zixiao Guo, Lu Jing, Zhao Duan, Zhiguo He
Abstract: We report on chute measurements of the free-surface velocity $v$ in dense flows of spheres and diverse sands and spheres-sand mixtures down rough inclines. These and previous measurements are inconsistent with standard flow rules, in which the Froude number $v/\sqrt{gh}$ scales linearly with $h/h_s$ or $(\tan\theta/\mu_r)^2h/h_s$, where $\mu_r$ is the dynamic friction coefficient, $h$ the flow thickness, and $h_s(\theta)$ its smallest value that permits a steady, uniform dense flow state at a given inclination angle $\theta$. This is because the characteristic length $L$ a flow needs to fully develop can exceed the chute or travel length $l$ and because neither rule is universal for fully developed flows across granular materials. We use a dimensional analysis motivated by a recent unification of sediment transport to derive a flow rule that solves both problems in accordance with our and previous measurements: $v=v_\infty[1-\exp(-l/L)]^{1/2}$, with $v_\infty\propto\mu_r^{3/2}\left[(\tan\theta-\mu_r)h\right]^{4/3}$ and $L\propto\mu_r^3\left[(\tan\theta-\mu_r)h\right]^{5/3}h$.

Title: Spin-Degenerate Bulk Bands and Topological Surface States of RuO2
Authors: T. Osumi, K. Yamauchi, S. Souma, P. Shubhankar, A. Honma, K. Nakayama, K. Ozawa, M. Kitamura, K. Horiba, H. Kumigashira, C. Bigi, F. Bertran, T. Oguchi, T. Takahashi, Y. Maeno, T. Sato
Abstract: Altermagnets are a novel platform to realize exotic electromagnetic properties distinct from those of conventional ferromagnets and antiferromagnets. We report results of micro-focused angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) on RuO2, of which altermagnetic nature has been under fierce debate. We have elucidated the band structure of the (100), (110) and (101) surfaces of a bulk single crystal. We found that, irrespective of the surface orientation, the experimental band structures obtained by ARPES commonly show a semi-quantitative agreement with the bulk-band calculation for the nonmagnetic phase, but display a severe disagreement with that for the antiferromagnetic phase. Moreover, spin-resolved ARPES signifies a negligible spin polarization for the bulk bands. These results suggest the absence of antiferromagnetism and altermagnetic spin splitting. Furthermore, we identified a flat surface band and a dispersive one near the Fermi level at the (100)/(110) and (101) surfaces, respectively, both of which are attributed to the topological surface states associated with the bulk Dirac nodal lines. The present ARPES results suggest that the crystal-orientation-dependent topological surface/interface states need to be taken into account to properly capture the transport and catalytic characteristics of RuO2.

Title: Magnetic switching of phonon angular momentum in a ferrimagnetic insulator
Authors: Fangliang Wu, Jing Zhou, Song Bao, Liangyue Li, Jinsheng Wen, Yuan Wan, Qi Zhang
Abstract: Phonons, which carry circular atomic motions, offer a new route for mediating angular momentum in solids. However, controlling phonon angular momentum without altering the material's structure or composition remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate the non-volatile switching of angular momentum-carrying phonons by leveraging intrinsic ferrimagnetism in an insulator. We find a pair of chiral phonons with giant energy splitting reaching 20% of the phonon frequency, due to spontaneously broken time-reversal symmetry. With a moderate magnetic field, the phonon angular momentum of the two chiral phonon branches can be switched along with the magnetization. Notably, near the critical temperature, the effective phonon magnetic moment is enhanced, reaching 2.62 Bohr magneton, exceeding the moment of a magnon. A microscopic model based on phonon-magnon coupling accounts for the observations. Furthermore, we identify two types of phononic domains with opposite phonon Zeeman splitting and propose the existence of topologically protected phononic edge modes at domain boundaries. These results demonstrate effective manipulation of chiral phonons with magnetism, and pave the way for engineering chiral phononic domains on the micrometer scale.

Title: Role of Random Interaction Connection in the Order Transition of Active Matter Based on the Vicsek Model
Authors: Ruizhi Jin, Kejun Dong
Abstract: Randomness plays a key role in the order transition of active matter but has not yet been explicitly considered in pairwise interaction connection. In this letter, we introduce the perception rate P into the Vicsek model as the probability of the interaction connections and model the connections as superposition states. We show that with increasing P, the polar order number undergoes an order transition and then saturation. The order transition is a first-order phase transition with band formation, and the effect of P is different from density. The change of the order number is linked with the interaction structure. The order transition, order saturation, and phase separation correspond to different critical changes in the local interaction number. The global interaction structure is further analyzed as a network. The decrease of P is comparable to random edge removal, under which the network experiences modal transitions near the critical points of the order number, and the network exhibits surprising robustness. Our results suggest that random interaction can be a new important factor in active matter models, with potential applications in robotic swarms and social activities.

Title: Multilayered MXenes for future two-dimensional nonvolatile magnetic memories
Authors: P. Kumar, Y. Miura, Y. Kotani, A. Sumiyoshiya, T. Nakamura, Gaurav K. Shukla, S. Isogami
Abstract: MXenes have attracted considerable attention in recent years due to their two-dimensional (2D) layered structure with various functionalities similar to the existing graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides. Aiming to open a new application field for MXenes in the realm of electronic devices such as ultrahigh-integrated magnetic memory, we have developed a spin-orbit torque (SOT) bilayer structure consisting of bare MXene of Cr2N: substrate//Cr2N/[Co/Pt]3/MgO using magnetron sputtering technique. We demonstrate the field-free current-induced magnetization switching (CIMS) in the Hall-cross configuration with the critical current density of ~30 MA/cm2. An attempt to replace the Cr2N layer by the Pt layer leads to the absence of field-free CIMS. As the SOT efficiency increases with increasing the Cr2N thickness, the first-principles calculation predicts the pronounced orbital-Hall conductivity in the out-of-plane component, compared to the spin-Hall conductivity in the Cr2N. X-ray magnetic circular dichroism reveals the out-of-plane uncompensated magnetic moment of Cr in the Cr2N layer at the interface, by contacting with Co in the [Co/Pt]3 ferromagnetic layer. The interfacial spin-filtering-like effect against the out-of-plane polarized spin owing to the uncompensated magnetic moment of Cr might be a possible cause for the field-free CIMS. These results show a significant milestone in the advanced 2D-spintronics, promising low-power and ultrahigh-integration.

Title: Centenary progress from the Nernst theorem to the Nernst statement
Authors: Xiaohang Chen, Shanhe Su, Yinghui Zhou, Jincan Chen
Abstract: It is found from textbooks that there are the different versions of the schematic diagram related to the Nernst equation, and consequently, it leads to some discussion related to the Nernst equation and the discovery of other meaningful schematic diagrams never appearing in literature. It is also found that through the introduction of a new function, the schematic diagram of the Nernst equation in the isothermal process of any thermodynamic system can be generated in a unified way and that the Nernst equation can be re-obtained from the experimental data of low-temperature chemical reactions without any artificial additional assumptions. The results obtained here show clearly that the centenary progress from the Nernst theorem to the Nernst statement is completed.

Title: Microwave-driven synthesis and modification of nanocarbons and hybrids in liquid and solid phases
Authors: Nagaraj Nandihalli
Abstract: Over the past 20 years, nanocarbons have become more significant as nanostructured fillers in composites and, more recently, as functional elements in a brand-new class of hybrid materials. Microwave-assisted synthesis and processing is a burgeoning subject matter in materials research with significant strides in the realm of nanocarbon during the last decade. The review examines recent approaches to producing various nanocarbons using microwaves as energy sources, the characterization of such materials for various applications, and their results. The underlying factors supporting the increased performance of such materials or their composites are analyzed and reaction mechanisms are presented wherever necessary. In particular, the recently developed and verified approaches to produce porous carbon materials, CNTs and fibers, carbon nanospheres, carbon dots, CQDs, reduced graphene oxide, nanocarbon hybrid materials, and the purification and modification of CNTs are discussed. The reduction of graphene oxide and the preparation of graphene derivative hybrids using solid-state and liquid-state routes such as polyopl, mixed solvents, ionic liquids, and microwave-assisted hydrothermal/solvothermal methods are analyzed in detail. In addition, the principles of microwave heating in liquid and solid states, the use of metals particles as arcing agents or catalysts, and carbonaceous materials as internal or external susceptors during synthesis and modifications are presented in detail.

Title: Optimal control for preparing fractional quantum Hall states in optical lattices
Authors: Ling-Na Wu, Xikun Li, Nathan Goldman, Botao Wang
Abstract: Preparing fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states represents a key challenge for quantum simulators. While small Laughlin-type states have been realized by manipulating two atoms or two photons, scaling up these settings to larger ensembles stands as an impractical task using existing methods and protocols. In this work, we propose to use optimal-control methods to substantially accelerate the preparation of small Laughlin-type states, and demonstrate that the resulting protocols are also well suited to realize larger FQH states under realistic preparation times. Our schemes are specifically built on the recent optical-lattice experiment [Leonard et al., Nature (2023)], and consist in optimizing very few control parameters: the tunneling amplitudes and linear gradients along the two directions of the lattice. We demonstrate the robustness of our optimal-control schemes against control errors and disorder, and discuss their advantages over existing preparation methods. Our work paves the way to the efficient realization of strongly-correlated topological states in quantum-engineered systems.

Title: Density of States Calculation of CeO$_2$ Based on VASP
Authors: Ruyi Hou
Abstract: In this study, the Density of States (DOS) of CeO$_2$ was analyzed in detail using the Density Functional Theory (DFT) method based on VASP software. As an important functional material, CeO$_2$ finds wide applications in catalysis, optics, and electronic devices. Through structural optimization, self-consistent electronic calculations, and non-self-consistent calculations, we thoroughly investigated the crystal structure and electronic energy level distribution of CeO$_2$. The lattice parameter optimization results from the structural calculations indicated a stable crystal structure for CeO$_2$. Self-consistent electronic calculations revealed a bandgap of approximately 2.403 eV, with the valence band maximum primarily contributed by O 2p orbitals and the conduction band minimum mainly originating from Ce 4f orbitals. Non-self-consistent calculations further demonstrated the total DOS and partial DOS of CeO$_2$, confirming the significant roles of Ce 4f and O 2p states in its electronic conduction and optical properties. These results not only provide theoretical support for the applications of CeO$_2$ in catalysis and electronic materials but also deepen our understanding of its fundamental electronic structural characteristics, offering guidance for the design and development of novel CeO$_2$-based materials.

Abstract: The Kondo effect is a hallmark of strongly-correlated systems, where an impurity's local degrees of freedom are screened by conduction electrons, forming a many-body singlet. With increasing degrees of freedom in the impurity, theoretical studies face significant challenges in accurately identifying and characterizing the underlying mechanisms that screen the impurity. In this work, we introduce a straightforward yet powerful methodology for identifying the formation of Kondo singlets and their screening mechanisms, by utilizing the numerical renormalization group (NRG) combined with the matrix product states (MPS) technique. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on the single and two-level Anderson impurity models (AIM). Furthermore, we discuss potential generalizations of the method to multichannel and multiorbital Kondo impurities. Harnessing advanced tensor network techniques, our approach extends to complex impurity systems, offering a robust and versatile framework for studying Kondo physics.

Title: Theory of spin magnetization driven by chiral phonons
Authors: Dapeng Yao, Shuichi Murakami
Abstract: We construct a general theory of spin magnetization driven by chiral phonons under an adiabatic process, in which atoms rotate around their equilibrium positions with a low phonon frequency. Here the spin magnetization originates from the modulated electronic states with spin-orbital coupling by atomic rotations. Under the adiabatic approximation, the time-dependent spin magnetization can be calculated by a Berry-phase method. In this paper, we focus on its time average, which is evaluated by assuming that the phonon displacement is small. As a result, the time average of the spin magnetization is concisely formulated in the form of the Berry curvature defined in the phonon-displacement space as an intrinsic property of atomic rotations. Our formula for spin magnetization reflects the chiral nature of phonons, and is convenient for $ab$ $initio$ calculations.

Title: Nanoscale defects and heterogeneous cavitation in water
Authors: Marin Šako, Fabio Staniscia, Roland R. Netz, Emanuel Schneck, Matej Kanduč
Abstract: Cavitation, the formation of vapor bubbles in metastable liquids, is highly sensitive to nanoscale surface defects. Using molecular dynamics simulations and classical nucleation theory, we show that pure water confined within defect-free walls can withstand extreme negative pressures, far beyond those observed experimentally. Hydrophobic surfaces trigger heterogeneous cavitation and lower the cavitation pressure magnitude, but not to experimental levels. Notably, a single nanoscopic surface defect capable of hosting a vapor bubble drastically reduces the tensile strength of water. We find that defects as small as 1-2 nm can act as effective cavitation nuclei, a scale smaller than predicted by simple mechanical stability arguments. This discrepancy arises from stochastic fluctuations of the vapor bubble, which can overcome the kinetic free-energy barrier for cavitation. Our findings show that cavitation is predominantly determined by the largest surface defect rather than the overall defect density, emphasizing the importance of eliminating the largest surface imperfections to enhance stability against cavitation.

Title: Boundary curvature-dependent dynamical trapping of undulating worms
Authors: Sohum Kapadia, Arshad Kudrolli
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of {\it Lumbriculus variegatus} in polygonal chambers and show that the worms align with the boundaries as they move forward and get dynamically trapped at concave corners over prolonged periods of time before escaping. We develop a kinematic model to calculate and describe the evolution of the worm's mean body orientation angle relative to the boundary. Performing simulations with a minimal active elastic dumbbell model, we then show that both the boundary aligning and corner trapping behavior of the worm are captured by steric interactions with the boundaries. The dimensionless ratio of the strength of forward motion and diffusion caused by the worm's undulatory and peristaltic strokes is shown to determine the boundary alignment dynamics and trapping time scales of the worm. The simulations show that that the body angle with the boundary while entering the concave corner is important to the trapping time distributions with shallow angles leading to faster escapes. Our study demonstrates that directed motion and limited angular diffusion can give rise to aggregation which can mimic shelter seeking behavior in slender undulating limbless worms even when thigmotaxis or contact seeking behavior is absent.

Title: Materials design criteria for ultra-high thermoelectric power factors in metals
Authors: Patrizio Graziosi, Kim-Isabelle Mehnert, Rajeev Dutt, Jan-Willem G. Bos, Neophytos Neophytou
Abstract: Metals have high electronic conductivities, but very low Seebeck coefficients, which traditionally make them unsuitable for thermoelectric materials. Recent studies, however, showed that metals can deliver ultra-high thermoelectric power factors (PFs) under certain conditions. In this work, we theoretically examine the electronic structure and electronic transport specifications which allow for such high PFs. Using Boltzmann transport (BTE) simulations and a multi-band electronic structure model, we show that metals with: i) high degree of transport asymmetry between their bands, ii) strong inter-band scattering, and iii) a large degree of band overlap, can provide ultra-high power factors. We show that each of these characteristics adds to the steepness of the transport distribution function of the BTE, which allows for an increase of the Seebeck coefficient to sizable values, simultaneously with an increase in the electrical conductivity. This work generalizes the concept that transport asymmetry (i.e., mixture of energy regions of high and low contributions to the electrical conductivity), through a combination of different band masses, scattering strengths, or energy filtering scenarios, etc., can indeed result in very high thermoelectric power factors, even in the absence of a material bandgap. Under certain conditions, transport asymmetry can over-compensate any performance degradation to the PF due to bipolar conduction and the naturally low Seebeck coefficients that otherwise exist in this class of materials.

Title: Tuning magnetism in graphene nanoribbons via strain and adatoms
Authors: Pablo Moles, Hernán Santos, Francisco Domínguez-Adame, Leonor Chico
Abstract: We investigate the impact of strain and adsorbed H adatoms on the magnetic properties of zigzag graphene nanoribbons (ZGNRs) using a combination of tight-binding and density functional theory methods for both, ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic edge configurations (AFM). Our study reveals that longitudinal strain induces a significant enhancement in the edge magnetic moment, that we attribute to strain-driven modifications in the band structure. In addition, we describe H~adatoms within the tight-binding approach by employing both an unrelaxed vacancy model and the Anderson impurity model. By comparing to density functional theory results, we corroborate that the Anderson impurity model is best suited to describe H adsorption. We then focus on the metallic FM edge configuration of the ZGNRs to better exploit the tuning of its properties. We find that the magnetic configuration of H~adatoms is strongly influenced by the edges, with an AFM coupling between edges and the H~adatom. In fact, the magnetic spatial pattern of the H adatom differs to that found in graphene due to this edge coupling. Importantly, we find robust discrete plateaus of integer magnetic moment as strain is varied in the defected ZGNRs, that we relate to changes in the band structure, namely, a half-metallic character or the opening of a gap. This behavior can be of interest for magnetic applications of carbon-based nanostructures

Title: Surface impedance measurements in superconductors in dc magnetic fields: challenges and relevance to particle physics experiments
Authors: Andrea Alimenti, Nicola Pompeo, Kostiantyn Torokhtii, Enrico Silva
Abstract: Particle physics and radio-frequency (RF) superconductivity have driven each other on since the 1970s. The unique properties of superconductors (SC) have been the enabling keys for the realization of accelerators with always increased performances thanks to the realization of all-superconducting cavities. The use of increasingly pure superconducting coatings for accelerating cavities, with lower and lower RF losses, determined such high-quality factors that the need to operate at low temperatures (below the superconducting transition temperature Tc) was well paid for. Recently, with respect to the path followed by the high frequency superconductivity, a new field opened since SCs are being considered for GHz operation in high dc magnetic fields, and measurements (and optimization) of totally different quantities are needed. The possibility of successfully using SCs in high magnetic fields for these purposes is far from obvious and it depends on the outcome of accurate measurements of usually overlooked quantities.

Title: Experimental models for cohesive granular materials: a review
Authors: Ram Sudhir Sharma, Alban Sauret
Abstract: Granular materials are involved in most industrial and environmental processes, as well as many civil engineering applications. Although significant advances have been made in understanding the statics and dynamics of cohesionless grains over the past decades, most granular systems we encounter often display some adhesive forces between grains. The presence of cohesion has effects at distances substantially larger than the closest neighbors and consequently can greatly modify their overall behavior. While considerable progress has been made in understanding and describing cohesive granular systems through idealized numerical simulations, controlled experiments corroborating and expanding the wide range of behavior remain challenging to perform. In recent years, various experimental approaches have been developed to control inter-particle adhesion that now pave the way to further our understanding of cohesive granular flows. This article reviews different approaches for making particles sticky, controlling their relative stickiness, and thereby studying their granular and bulk mechanics. Some recent experimental studies relying on model cohesive grains are synthesized, and opportunities and perspectives in this field are discussed.

Title: Ordered InAs quantum dots on pre-patterned GaAs (0 0 1) by local oxidation nanolithography
Authors: J. Martín-Sánchez, Y. González, L. González, M. Tello, R. García, D. Granados, J.M. García, F. Briones
Abstract: Ordered InAs quantum dot (QD) arrays have been obtained on pre-patterned GaAs (0 0 1) substrates by atomic force microscopy (AFM) local oxidation nanolithography. Prior to InAs molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) deposition, an ordered square array of nanoholes is formed at the GaAs pre-patterned surface following in situ etching with atomic hydrogen. A low substrate temperature is maintained during the whole process in order to avoid pattern smoothing. Our results show that the density and dimensions of the nanoholes on the GaAs surface determine InAs QD size, nucleation site and InAs dose necessary for their formation. As a function of the geometrical parameters of the nanohole array, we can obtain either ordered 2D arrays of separated QD, closely packed QD or localized areas for QD formation.

Title: Stokes flow in the electronic fluid with odd viscosity
Authors: Yonatan Messica, Alex Levchenko, Dmitri B. Gutman
Abstract: We investigate the Stokes flow around a slowly moving sphere in a fluid with odd viscosity, focusing on a system of electrons in a Weyl semimetal with a single axis of asymmetry arising from broken time-reversal symmetry. We analyze the flow around the sphere, compute the Hall force acting perpendicular to its direction of motion, and study the implications for the Hall resistivity of Weyl semimetals in the hydrodynamic regime.

Title: Is p-Type Doping in SeO2 Feasible?
Authors: Zewen Xiao
Abstract: The significance of p-type transparent oxide semiconductors (TOS) in the semiconductor industry is paramount, driving advancements in optoelectronic technologies for transparent electronic devices with unique properties. The recent discovery of p-type behavior in SeO2 has stirred both interest and confusion in the scientific community. In this Letter, we employ density functional theory calculations to unveil the intrinsic insulating characteristics of SeO2, highlighting substantial challenges in carrier doping. Our electronic structure analyses indicate that the Se 5s2 states are energetically positioned too low to effectively interact with the O 2p orbitals, resulting in a valence band maximum (VBM) primarily dominated by the O 2p orbitals. The deep and localized nature of the VBM in SeO2 limits its potential as a high-mobility p-type TOS. Defect calculations demonstrate that all intrinsic defects in SeO2 exhibit deep transition levels within the bandgap. The Fermi level consistently resides in the mid-gap region, regardless of synthesis conditions. Furthermore, deep intrinsic acceptors and donors exhibit negative formation energies in the n-type and p-type regions, respectively, facilitating their spontaneous formation and impeding external doping efforts. Thus, the reported p-type conductivity in SeO2 samples is unlikely intrinsic and is more plausibly attributed to reduced elemental Se, a well-known p-type semiconductor.

Title: Unveiling an in-plane Hall effect in rutile RuO$_2$ films
Authors: Meng Wang, Jianbing Zhang, Di Tian, Pu Yu, Fumitaka Kagawa
Abstract: The in-plane-magnetic-field-induced Hall effect (IPHE) observed in Weyl semimetals and PT-symmetric antiferromagnets has attracted increasing attention, as it breaks the stereotype that the Hall effect is induced by an out-of-plane magnetic field or magnetization. To date, the IPHE has been discussed mainly for materials with low-symmetry crystal/magnetic point groups. Here, we show that even if symmetry forbids an inherent IPHE that arises from any mechanism, an apparent IPHE can be generated by selecting a low-symmetry crystalline plane for measurement. For rutile RuO$_2$, although its high symmetry forbids an inherent IPHE, films grown along the low-symmetry (1 1 1) and (1 0 1) orientations are found to exhibit a distinct IPHE. The in-plane Hall coefficients are quantitatively reproduced by referring to the out-of-plane Hall coefficients measured for the high-symmetry (1 0 0) and (0 0 1) planes, indicating that the observed IPHE is caused by a superposition of inequivalent out-of-plane Hall effects. Similar behaviour is also observed for paramagnetic rutile systems, indicating the ubiquity of the apparent IPHE in electronic and spintronic devices with low-symmetry crystalline planes.

Title: The anomalous density of states and quasi-localized vibration through homogeneous thermalization of an inhomogeneous elastic system
Authors: Cunyuan Jiang
Abstract: Amorphous solids are dynamically inhomogeneous due to in lack of translational symmetry and hence exhibit vibrational properties different from crystalline solids with anomalous low frequency vibrational density of states (VDOS) and related low temperature thermal properties. However, an interpretation of their origin from basic physical laws is still needed compared with rapidly progressed particle level investigations. In this work, we start with the quasi-equilibrium condition, which requires elastic potential energy to be homogeneously distributed even in an inhomogeneous elastic solid over long time observation. Analytical result shows that the anomalous low frequency VDOS behavior $D(\omega) \propto \omega^4$ can be obtained when the quasi-equilibrium condition is satisfied on an inhomogeneous elastic system. Under high frequency after a crossover depending on the length scale of inhomogeneity, the power law of VDOS is changed to square $D(\omega) \propto \omega^2$ which is Debye's law for crystalline solids. These features agree with recent particle level investigations. Our work suggest that the universal low frequency anomaly of amorphous solids can be considered as a result of homogeneous thermalization.

Title: Interactive Multiscale Modeling to Bridge Atomic Properties and Electrochemical Performance in Li-CO$_2$ Battery Design
Authors: Mohammed Lemaalem, Selva Chandrasekaran Selvaraj, Ilias Papailias, Naveen K. Dandu, Arash Namaeighasemi, Larry A. Curtiss, Amin Salehi-Khojin, Anh T. Ngo
Abstract: Li-CO$_2$ batteries show promise as energy storage solutions, offering high theoretical energy density and CO$_2$ fixation. Their performance relies on the formation and decomposition of Li$_2$CO$_3$/C during discharge and charge cycles, respectively. We used a multiscale modeling framework that integrates Density Functional Theory (DFT), Ab-Initio Molecular Dynamics (AIMD), classical Molecular Dynamics (MD), and Finite Element Analysis (FEA) to investigate atomic and cell-level properties. The Li-CO$_2$ battery consists of a lithium metal anode, an ionic liquid electrolyte, and a carbon cloth porous cathode with a Sb$_{0.67}$Bi$_{1.33}$Te$_3$ catalyst. DFT and AIMD determined the electrical conductivities of Sb$_{0.67}$Bi$_{1.33}$Te$_3$ and Li$_2$CO$_3$ using the Kubo-Greenwood formalism and studied the CO$_2$ reduction mechanism on the cathode catalyst. MD simulations calculated the CO$_2$ diffusion coefficient, Li$^+$ transference number, ionic conductivity, and Li$^+$ solvation structure. The FEA model, incorporating results from atomistic simulations, reproduced experimental voltage-capacity profiles at 1 mA/cm$^2$ and revealed spatio-temporal variations in Li$_2$CO$_3$/C deposition, porosity, and CO$_2$ concentration dependence on discharge rates in the cathode. Accordingly, Li$_2$CO$_3$ can form toroidal and thin film deposits, leading to dispersed and local porosity changes at 0.1 mA/cm$^2$ and 1 mA/cm$^2$, respectively. The capacity decreases exponentially from 81,570 mAh/g at 0.1 mA/cm$^2$ to 6,200 mAh/g at 1 mA/cm$^2$, due to pore clogging that limits CO$_2$ transport to the cathode interior. Therefore, the performance of Li-CO$_2$ batteries can be significantly improved by enhancing CO$_2$ transport, regulating Li$_2$CO$_3$ deposition, and optimizing cathode architecture.

Title: Pseudo-Ising superconductivity induced by $p$-wave magnetism
Authors: Zi-Ting Sun, Xilin Feng, Ying-Ming Xie, Benjamin T. Zhou, Jin-Xin Hu, K. T. Law
Abstract: Unconventional magnetic orders usually interplay with superconductivity in intriguing ways. In this work, we propose that a conventional superconductor in proximity to a compensated $p$-wave magnet exhibits behaviors analogous to those of Ising superconductivity found in transition-metal dichalcogenides, which we refer to as pseudo-Ising superconductivity. The pseudo-Ising superconductivity is characterized by several distinctive features: (i) it stays much more robust under strong $p$-wave magnetism than usual ferromagnetism or $d$-wave altermagnetism, thanks to the apparent time-reversal symmetry in $p$-wave spin splitting; (ii) in the low-temperature regime, a second-order superconducting phase transition occurs at a significantly enhanced in-plane upper critical magnetic field $B_{c2}$; (iii) the supercurrent-carrying state establishes non-vanishing out-of-plane spin magnetization, which is forbidden by symmetry in Rahsba and Ising superconductors. We further propose a spin-orbit-free scheme to realize Majorana zero modes by placing superconducting quantum wires on a $p$-wave magnet. Our work establishes a new form of unconventional superconductivity generated by $p$-wave magnetism.

Title: The stochastic porous medium equation in one dimension
Authors: Maximilien Bernard, Andrei A. Fedorenko, Pierre Le Doussal, Alberto Rosso
Abstract: We study the porous medium equation (PME) in one space dimension in presence of additive non-conservative white noise, and interpreted as a stochastic growth equation for the height field of an interface. We predict the values of the two growth exponents $\alpha$ and $\beta$ using the functional RG. Extensive numerical simulations show agreement with the predicted values for these exponents, however they also show anomalous scaling with an additional "local" exponent $\alpha_{\rm loc}$, as well as multiscaling originating from broad distributions of local height differences. The stationary measure of the stochastic PME is found to be well described by a random walk model, related to a Bessel process. This model allows for several predictions about the multiscaling properties.

Title: Dissipative quantum phase transitions in electrically driven lasers
Authors: Lei-Lei Nian, Yi-Cheng Wang, Jin-Yi Wang, Long Xiong, Jing-Tao Lü
Abstract: Embedding quantum dot circuits into microwave cavities has emerged as a novel platform for controlling photon emission statistics by electrical means. With such a model, we reveal previously undefined quantum phase transitions in electrically driven lasing regimes by breaking the photon gain-loss balance condition. For one-photon interaction, the scaling theory indicates that the system undergoes a continuous phase transition from thermal to coherent photon emissions, consistent with conventional laser physics. Going beyond this, a hidden discontinuous quantum phase transition from superbunched to coherent states in two-photon processes, accompanied by the bistability within a mean-field theory, is predicted. Our prediction, along with its extension to multiphoton processes, represents a key step towards accessing lasing phase transitions.

Title: Odd-parity topological superconductivity in kagome metal RbV$_3$Sb$_5$
Authors: Xilin Feng, Zi-Ting Sun, Ben-Chuan Lin, K. T. Law
Abstract: Kagome superconductors AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A=K, Rb, Cs) have sparked considerable interest due to the presence of several intertwined symmetry-breaking phases within a single material. Recently, hysteresis and reentrant superconductivity were observed experimentally through magnetoresistance measurements in RbV$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$, providing strong evidence of a spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking superconducting state. The unconventional magnetic responses, combined with crystalline symmetry, impose strong constraints on the possible pairing symmetries of the superconducting state. In this work, we propose that RbV$_3$Sb$_5$ is an odd-parity superconductor characterized by spin-polarized Cooper pairs. The hysteresis in magnetoresistance and the reentrant superconductivity can both be explained by the formation and evolution of superconducting domains composed of non-unitary pairing. Considering the nodal properties of the kagome superconductor RbV$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$, it is topological and characterized by Majorana zero modes at its boundary, which can be detected through tunneling experiments.

Title: Thermal conductivity of 3C-SiC from configuration space sampling
Authors: Paweł T. Jochym, Jan Łażewski
Abstract: Cubic silicon carbide phonon thermal conductivity has been calculated using anharmonic phonon analysis. The atomic interaction model was built using displacement-force data obtained with the High Efficiency Configuration Space Sampling (HECSS) technique and density functional theory calculated forces. In the new version of HECSS we replaced the Markov chain scheme of Metropolis-Hastings Monte-Carlo with weighting of the final sampling according to the target distribution. This increased the efficiency of the method and allowed to use -- with appropriate weight -- all generated and ab-initio evaluated samples. The quality of the proposed method is confirmed by the accuracy with which the experimental results taken from the literature were reproduced.

Title: Learning the Electrostatic Response of the Electron Density through a Symmetry-Adapted Vector Field Model
Authors: Mariana Rossi, Kevin Rossi, Alan M. Lewis, Mathieu Salanne, Andrea Grisafi
Abstract: A current challenge in atomistic machine learning is that of efficiently predicting the response of the electron density under electric fields. We address this challenge with symmetry-adapted kernel functions that are specifically derived to account for the rotational symmetry of a three-dimensional vector field. We demonstrate the equivariance of the method on a set of rotated water molecules and show its high efficiency with respect to number of training configurations and features for liquid water and naphthalene crystals. We conclude showcasing applications for relaxed configurations of gold nanoparticles, reproducing the scaling law of the electronic polarizability with size, up to systems with more than 2000 atoms. By deriving a natural extension to equivariant learning models of the electron density, our method provides an accurate and inexpensive strategy to predict the electrostatic response of molecules and materials.

Title: On the correlation between entanglement and the negative sign problem
Authors: Ping Xu, Yang Shen, Yuan-Yao He, Mingpu Qin
Abstract: In this work, we study the correlation between entanglement and the negative sign problem in quantum Monte Carlo for the simulation of low-dimensional strongly correlated quantum many body systems. Entanglement entropy characterizes the difficulty of many-body simulation with tensor network state related methods, while the average sign measures the difficulty in many-body simulation for a variety of quantum Monte Carlo methods. Although there exist cases where one type of method works better than the other, it is desirable to find the possible correlation between entanglement and average sign for general hard strongly correlated systems regarding computational complexity. We take the doped two-dimensional Hubbard model as an example and numerically calculate the doping evolution of both the entanglement in the ground state with Density Matrix Renormalization Group and the average sign in the Auxiliary Field Quantum Monte Carlo simulation at low temperature. The results show that they are indeed correlated. The entanglement entropy (average sign) shows a peak (dip) around 20% doping, indicating that it is the difficult region for both methods. The vicinity of 20% doping is also the most intriguing region in both the Hubbard model and cuprate high-Tc superconductors where competing states with close energy intertwine with each other. Recognizing the correlation between entanglement and average sign provides new insight into our understanding of the difficulty in the simulation of strongly correlated quantum many-body systems.

Title: A large anomalous Hall effect and Weyl nodes in bulk FeNi$_3$: a density functional theory study
Authors: Shivani Thakur, Santu Baidya
Abstract: In this work, we report the study of electronic structure, magnetism, and the existence of Weyl nodes in a pristine bulk FeNi$_{3}$, a member of Fe-Ni inver alloy compounds, known as good metal catalysts with high activity and stability for water splitting for a very long time. Our observation of Weyl points in the bulk FeNi$_{3}$ may lead to a new technology to design highly efficient topological catalysts. While the previous literature \cite{PhysRev.97.304} mainly focused on the thermal and catalytic properties of FeNi$_{3}$ we report the interplay of Fe $d$-Ni $d$ hybridization and spin-orbit coupling give rise to the ferromagnetic Weyl nodes in the bulk FeNi$_{3}$. Our study shows that the ground state of the bulk FeNi$_{3}$ is a Weyl metal with a large number of Weyl nodes at the Fermi energy away from high-symmetry $k$-points. Furthermore, we predict a large intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity of about $10000~S/m$ at the ground state. In addition, we show the existence of Weyl nodes along the high symmetry $k$-points $~0.2eV$ above and $~0.05eV$ below self-consistent Fermi level that may be achieved either by the electron or hole doping, or by external perturbation. In this article, FeNi$_{3}$ has been studied to explore this scenario using first-principles density functional theory and subsequent Wannier90-based tight-binding method. Furthermore, we report the existence of two types of Weyl cones, type-I and type-II, $~0.2eV$ above the Fermi level. Our report provides a realistic material to further explore the intrinsic properties related to Weyl cones, and the spintronic applications.

Title: Revealing the role played by $\alpha$- and $\beta$-relaxation in hydrostatically compressed metallic glasses

Abstract: Any property of metallic glasses is controlled by the microscopic ongoing relaxation processes. While the response of these processes to temperature is well documented, little is known on their pressure dependence, owning to non-trivial experimental challenges. By combining fast differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray diffraction and high-pressure technologies, we identify the origin of a recently discovered pressure-induced rejuvenation in metallic glasses from the different pressure response of the $\alpha$- and $\beta$-relaxation in a series of hydrostatically compressed Vit4 glasses. While the localized $\beta$-relaxation promotes rejuvenation and is associated to a constant looser atomic packing independent of the applied pressure, the collective $\alpha$-relaxation triggers density driven ordering processes promoting the stability. The latter parameter however cannot be solely described by the degree of equilibration reached during the compression, which instead determines the crossover between the two regimes allowing to rescale the corresponding activation energies of the two processes on a master curve.

Title: Frustrated magnetism in antiferromagnetic nonsymmorphic square-net lattice: NdSbSe
Authors: Prabuddha Kant Mishra, Priyanka Nehla, Rishabh Shukla, Rie Umetsu, Ashok Kumar Ganguli
Abstract: Spintronics has emerged as a field of vast applicability, and layered magnetic materials have served as a ground for advancement in this direction. Here, we report the synthesis and detailed magnetic and specific heat studies on NdSbSe, (a ZrSiS-based structure) magnetic topological material. The temperature-dependent magnetization shows the presence of competing magnetic interactions ($T_N<T<150$ K) in addition to a long-range antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering below 4.2~K. In the AFM state, the isothermal magnetization confirms spin reorientation to the critical magnetic field of 40 kOe. Frequency-dependent ac-susceptibility measurements have probed the nonequilibrium dynamics of frustrated magnetic moments (near 150 K). The $\lambda$-like peak at 3.8~K observed in the specific heat shifts to a lower temperature with applied magnetic fields and validates the AFM order. In addition, the specific heat does not exhibit any sign corresponding to the short-range magnetic order near 150 K (spin-glass-like memory effect). In addition, the derived parameters from specific heat suggest the presence of a strong electronic correlation in NdSbSe, resulting in a Kondo-like signature in temperature-dependent resistivity data.

Title: Shot-noise-driven macroscopic vibrations and displacement transduction in quantum tunnel junctions
Authors: Prasanta Kumbhakar, Anusha Shanmugam, Akhileshwar Mishra, Ravi Pant, J L Reno, S Addamane, Madhu Thalakulam
Abstract: Inherent randomness and the resulting stochastic behavior of fundamental particles manifested as quantum noise put a lower bound on measurement imprecision in the quantum measurement process. In addition, the quantum noise imparts decoherence and dephasing to the system being measured, referred to as the measurement back-action. While the microscopic effects of back-action have been observed, macroscopic evidence is a rarity. Here we report a macroscopic display of the back-action of an ultra-sensitive quantum point contact (QPC) electrical amplifier whose transport is defined by the quantum tunneling of electrons. The QPC amplifier, realized on GaAs-AlGaAs heterostructures, coupled to a planar superconducting resonator, operates at a frequency of 2.155 GHz in the shot-noise-limited regime. The shot-noise excitation of the mechanical modes and the resulting piezoelectric polarization enhancing the shot-noise at the mode frequencies form a positive feedback loop between the electrical and mechanical degrees of freedom. While the excitation of the vibrational modes is a display of the macroscopic effects of measurement back-action, the amplitudes of the noise peaks allow us to calibrate the displacement sensitivity of the QPC-resonator systems, which is in the order of 35 fm/SQRT(Hz) range, making it an excellent sensor for ultra-sensitive and fast strain or displacement detection.

Title: Refining Au/Sb alloyed ohmic contacts in undoped Si/SiGe strained quantum wells
Authors: LuckyDonald L Kynshi, Umang Soni, Chithra H Sharma, Shengqiang Zhou and, Madhu Thalakulam
Abstract: Shallow undoped Si/SiGe quantum wells are the leading platforms for hosting quantum processors based on spin-qubits. The ohmic contacts to the electron gas in these systems are accomplished by ion-implantation technique since the conventional Au/Sb alloyed contacts present a rough surface consisting of sharp islands and pits. These sharp protrusions cause electrical discharge across the gate-dielectric between the ohmic contacts and the accumulation-gates causing device break-down. A clear understanding of the surface morphology, elemental, compositional and electrical characterization of the alloyed region would enable one to engineer a smoother post alloyed surface. In this work, we find that the rough surface morphology is a cumulative effect of the Au/Si eutectic reaction and the threading dislocations inherent in the heterostructure. The structural, elemental, and chemical-state analysis show that the inverted pyramidal pits are resulting from the enhanced Au/Si eutectic reaction at the threading dislocations stemming from the heterostructure interface, while, the sharp protrusions causing accumulation gate-leakage are gold-rich precipitations. The protrusions are removed using an aqua regia treatment prior to the deposition of the gate-oxide and gate electrode. Exploiting a Hall bar device, we analyse the mobility and carrier concentration of the undoped Si/SiGe consisting of Au/Sb alloyed contacts down to 1.5 K. The measured mobility ~10^5 cm^2/Vs and carrier concentration of ~10^11/cm^2are comparable to the reported values on similar high-mobility heterostructures confirming the efficacy of our modified Au/Sb alloy technique in accomplishing high-efficiency contacts to undoped Si/SiGe heterostructures.

Title: Superlubric-Locked Transition of Twist Grain Boundaries in 3D Crystals
Authors: Jin Wang, Erio Tosatti
Abstract: Properties of twist grain boundaries (TGB), long known structurally but not tribologically, are simulated under sliding and load, with Au(111) our test case. The load-free TGB moiré is smooth and superlubric at incommensurate twists. Strikingly, load provokes a first-order structural transformation, where the highest energy moiré nodes are removed -- an Aubry-type transition for which we provide a Landau theory and a twist-load phase diagram. Upon frictional sliding, the transformation causes a superlubric-locked transition, with a huge friction jump, and irreversible plastic flow. The predicted phenomena are robust, also recovered in a Lennard-Jones lattice TGB, and not exclusive to gold or to metals.

Title: On the Topological Features of the Helical Phase Transition in MnSi
Authors: S.M. Stishov, A.E. Petrova, A. M. Belemuk
Abstract: Many decades of study have revealed very unusual properties of the helical phase transition in MnSi. This situation is briefly described and illustrated in the present note. As one will be able to see, one peculiarity is that the phase transition point in MnSi is accompanied by extremes of different thermodynamic and kinetic quantities on the high temperature side of the transition, which look similar to a property of 2D systems. The whole situation can be tentatively described as a phase transformation of the helical phase of MnSi to the paramagnetic state, which occurs in two steps, first as a first order phase transition and then following a breakdown of topological objects such as spin vortices.

Title: Ultrahigh interfacial thermal conductance for cooling gallium oxide electronics using cubic boron arsenide
Authors: Wenjiang Zhou, Nianjie Liang, Wei Xiao, Zhaofei Tong, Fei Tian, Bai Song
Abstract: Gallium oxide (Ga$_2$O$_3$) has attracted significant interest for its unique potential especially in power electronics. However, its low and anisotropic thermal conductivity poses a major challenge for heat dissipation. Here, we explore an effective cooling strategy centering on the heterogeneous integration of $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ devices with cubic boron arsenide (cBAs), an emerging material with an ultrahigh thermal conductivity $\kappa$ of ~1300 Wm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$. Machine-learned potentials for representative $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$/cBAs interfaces are trained, enabling accurate and efficient calculation of the interfacial thermal conductance $G$ via nonequilibrium molecular dynamics. At 300 K, remarkable $G$ values of 749$\pm$33 MWm$^{-2}$K$^{-1}$ and 824$\pm$35 MWm$^{-2}$K$^{-1}$ are predicted for Ga-As and O-B bonding across the interface, respectively, which are primarily attributed to the well-matched phonon density of states considering the similar Debye temperatures of $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ and cBAs. Moreover, finite-element simulations directly show a notable device temperature reduction when comparing cBAs with other substrates. The simultaneously ultrahigh $\kappa$ and $G$ highlight cBAs as an ideal substrate for Ga$_2$O$_3$ electronics.

Title: Advancing Atom Probe Tomography of SrTiO$_3$: Measurement Methodology and Impurity Detection Limits
Authors: J. E. Rybak, J. Arlt, B. Gault, C. A. Volkert
Abstract: Strontium titanate (STO) possesses promising properties for applications in thermoelectricity, catalysis, fuel cells, and more, but its performance is highly dependent on stoichiometry and impurity levels. While atom probe tomography (APT) can provide detailed three-dimensional atomic-scale chemical information, STO specimens have been challenging to analyze due to premature specimen fracture. In this study, we show that by applying a thin metal coating to atom probe tips, STO specimens can be analyzed with nearly 100% success. Using this approach, we investigate both undoped STO and 1 at% Nb-doped STO, achieving sufficient sensitivity to detect Nb concentrations as low as 0.7 at%. This work establishes a reliable APT method for high-resolution chemical analysis of STO at the nanoscale.

Title: Grain boundary interstitial segregation in substitutional binary alloys
Authors: Zuoyong Zhang, Chuang Deng
Abstract: Grain boundary (GB) segregation is a powerful approach for optimizing the thermal and mechanical properties of metal alloys. In this study, we report significant GB interstitial segregation in a representative substitutional binary alloy system (Al-Ni) through atomistic simulations, challenging prevailing assumptions in the literature. Our findings show that Ni atoms preferentially segregate to interstitial sites within numerous kite-like GB structures in the Al bicrystals. An intriguing interplanar interstitial segregation pattern was also observed and analyzed. Additionally, interstitial segregation can induce unexpected GB transitions, such as kite transitions and nano-faceting, due to the existence of small interstitial sites. Building upon these observations, we developed a robust method to systematically identify the interstitial candidate sites for accommodating solutes at GBs. This approach combines site detection with structural filtering to produce distributions of interstitial sites that closely match atomistic simulation results. Applied to nanocrystalline alloys, this method enabled the calculation of interstitial segregation energies, significantly improving GB segregation predictions for the Al-Ni system. Furthermore, machine learning models using smooth overlap of atomic positions descriptors successfully predicted per-site interstitial segregation energy. This study highlights the critical role of GB interstitial segregation in advancing our understanding of solute behavior and provides valuable insights for designing next-generation alloys.

Title: One-dimensional confined Rashba states in a two-dimensional Si$_{2}$Bi$_{2}$ induced by vacancy line defects
Authors: Arif Lukmantoro, Edi Suprayoga, Moh. Adhib Ulil Absor
Abstract: Advanced defect engineering techniques have enabled the creation of unique quantum phases from pristine materials. One-dimensional (1D) atomic defects in low-dimensional systems are particularly intriguing due to their distinct quantum properties, such as 1D Rashba states that allow for the generation of nondissipative spin currents, making them ideal for spintronic devices. Using density-functional calculations and model-based symmetry analysis, we report the emergence of 1D Rashba states in a two-dimensional Si$_{2}$Bi$_{2}$ monolayer (ML) with vacancy line defects (VLDs). We show that introducing VLDs in the Si$_{2}$Bi$_{2}$ ML induces 1D confined defect states near the Fermi level, which are strongly localized along the extended defect line. Notably, we observed 1D Rashba spin-split bands in these defect states with significant spin splitting originating mainly from the strong $p-p$ coupling orbitals between Si and Bi atoms near the defect sites. These spin-split defect states exhibit perfectly collinear spin polarization in momentum $\vec{k}$-space, which is oriented perpendicularly to the VLD orientation. Moreover, using $\vec{k}\cdot\vec{p}$ perturbation theory supplemented with symmetry analysis, we show that the 1D Rashba states with collinear spin polarization are enforced by the lowering of symmetry of the VLDs into the $C_{s}$ point group, which retains the $M_{xz}$ mirror symmetry along with the 1D nature of the VLDs. The observed 1D Rashba states in this system protect carriers against spin decoherence and support an exceptionally long spin lifetime, which could be promising for developing highly efficient spintronic devices.

Title: Almost Strong Zero Modes at Finite Temperature
Authors: Niklas Tausendpfund, Aditi Mitra, Matteo Rizzi
Abstract: Interacting fermionic chains exhibit extended regions of topological degeneracy of their ground states as a result of the presence of Majorana or parafermionic zero modes localized at the edges. In the opposite limit of infinite temperature, the corresponding non-integrable spin chains, obtained via generalized Jordan-Wigner mapping, are known to host so-called Almost Strong Zero Modes, which are long-lived with respect to any bulk excitations. Here, we study the fairly unexplored territory that bridges these two extreme cases of zero and infinite temperature. We blend two established techniques for states, the Lanczos series expansion and a tensor network ansatz, uplifting them to the level of operator algebra. This allows us to efficiently simulate large system sizes for arbitrarily long timescales and to extract the temperature-dependent decay rates. We observe that for the Kitaev-Hubbard model, the decay rate of the edge mode depends exponentially on the inverse temperature $\beta$, and on an effective energy scale $\Delta_{\rm eff}$ that is greater than the thermodynamic gap of the system $\Delta$.

Title: Computational statistics of segregation and dislocation activities of hydrogen charged free surfaces and grain boundaries
Authors: Matthew J. Melfi, S. Mohadeseh Taheri-Mousavi
Abstract: Revealing statistics of H-defect interactions provides insights into significant ductility loss due to the particular strain partitioning in H-charged structural alloys. Experimental investigation of these interactions is extremely difficult, labor-intensive, and costly. Here, we used MD and GCMC simulations and studied H-diffusion deformation at polycrystalline scale with atomic resolution efficiently. To study H-free surface interactions, large pillars including all possible angles and planes of free surfaces were modeled. To study H-grain boundary interactions, several polycrystalline models containing comparable statistics of low and high angle grain boundaries were examined. We studied the statistics of H-segregation tendencies based on free surface angles and grain boundary types. Dislocation activities were also classified for these various types and total density and strength were compared and analyzed compared to H-free samples. In the free surface model, it was observed that H was evenly distributed along the model's surface. Although the dislocation density was reduced compared to H-free samples, localized bands of dislocations were produced. Additionally in the polycrystalline samples, it was concluded that H tends to segregate along grain boundaries with misorientation angles less than or equal to 25 degrees. However, specific misorientation angle interactions -- namely $>45$ degrees -- led to increased dislocation density in H-charged samples compared to their H-free counterparts.

Title: Quantum Criticality of Type-I and Critically Tilted Dirac Semimetals
Authors: Huanzhi Hu, Frank Krüger
Abstract: We investigate the universality of an Ising symmetry breaking phase transition of tilted two-dimensional Dirac fermions, in the type-I phase as well as at the Lifshitz transition between a type-I and a type-II semimetal, where the Fermi surface changes from point-like to one with electron and hole pockets that touch at the overtilted Dirac cones. We compute the Landau damping of long-wavelength order parameter fluctuations by tilted Dirac fermions and use the resulting IR propagator as input for a renormalisation-group analysis of the resulting Gross-Neveu-Yukawa field theory. We first demonstrate that the criticality of tilted type-I fermions is controlled by a line of fixed points along which the poles of the renormalised Green function correspond to an untilted Dirac spectrum with varying anisotropy of Fermi velocities. At the phase transition the Lorentz invariance is restored, resulting in the same critical exponents as for conventional Dirac systems. The multicritical point is given by the endpoint of the fixed-point line. It can be approached along any path in parameter space that avoids the fixed point line of the critical type-I semimetal. We show that the critical exponents at the Lifshitz point are different and that Lorentz invariance is broken.

Title: Surface Reconstructions in Thin-Films of Magnetic Topological Insulator MnBi$_2$Te$_4$
Authors: Shahid Sattar, Daniel Hedman, C. M. Canali
Abstract: Understanding the nature of surface states and their exchange gaps in magnetic topological insulator MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ (MBT) thin films is crucial for achieving robust topological Chern and Axion insulating phases where the Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect and the Topological Magneto-electric Effect can be realized. Here, we focus on the rather unexplored issue of how surface reconstructions, which are likely to occur in experiments, influence these properties. Using first-principles calculations together with molecular dynamics simulations accelerated by machine learning force field, we demonstrate that interstitial-2H and peripheral-2H type atomic reconstructions are responsible for modifying the exchange gap and surface characteristics of MBT thin films, with important implications for the topological indices and the nature of quasi one-dimensional side-wall edge states dominating quantum transport. \textcolor{blue}{Specifically, the calculation of the energy landscape and barriers for the proposed surface reconstructions indicates that the interstitial-2H reconstruction is thermodynamically more stable than the peripheral-2H reconstruction. The latter case is also hypothesized as providing a plausible explanation for the Rashba surface states observed} in Angle-Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements. Our analysis provides a theoretical framework to elucidate the nature and effect of reconstructions in MBT thin films, with predictions for the experimental realization of different topological phases.

Title: Spontaneous spatial sorting by cell shape in growing colonies of rod-like bacteria
Authors: Mateusz Ratman, Jimmy Gonzalez Nuñez, Daniel A. Beller
Abstract: Mechanical interactions among cells in a growing microbial colony can significantly influence the colony's spatial genetic structure and, thus, evolutionary outcomes such as the fates of rare mutations. Here, we computationally investigate how this spatial genetic structure changes as a result of heritable phenotypic variations in cell shape. By modeling rod-like bacterial cells as lengthening and dividing circo-rectangles in a 2D Brownian dynamics framework, we simulate the growth of a colony containing two populations with different aspect ratios. Compared to monodisperse colonies, such bidisperse colonies exhibit diminished intermixing between sub-populations when the less elongated cells are too short to nematically order, instead forming large clusters. We find that the cells with longer aspect ratio gradually segregate to the colony periphery. We present evidence that this demixing is related to nematic order in the bulk and to active nematic mixing dynamics near the periphery. These findings are qualitatively robust across different growth rate protocols and initial conditions. Because the periphery is often an advantageous position when nutrients are limited, our results suggest a possible evolutionary selective pressure of mechanical origin that favors large cell aspect ratio.

Title: Bulk-edge correspondence in circular-symmetric models
Authors: Klaus Ziegler
Abstract: We propose a systematic analysis of the eigenfunctions of two-band systems in two dimensions with a circular edge. Our approach is based on an analytic continuation of the wavenumber, which yields a mapping from the bulk modes to the edge modes. Phase relations of the eigenfunctions are described by their mapping onto a three-dimensional field of unit vectors. This mapping is studied in detail for a two-band Laplacian model and a Dirac model. The direction of the unit vector identifies the phase relation of the eigenfunctions and enables us to distinguish between the upper band, the lower band and the edge spectrum. Bulk and edge modes are spectrally separated, which results in two transitions from delocalized bulk modes to localized edge modes. These transitions are accompanied by transitions of the phase relations.

Title: Advances in modeling complex materials: The rise of neuroevolution potentials
Authors: Penghua Ying, Cheng Qian, Rui Zhao, Yanzhou Wang, Feng Ding, Shunda Chen, Zheyong Fan
Abstract: Interatomic potentials are essential for driving molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, directly impacting the reliability of predictions regarding the physical and chemical properties of materials. In recent years, machine-learned potentials (MLPs), trained against first-principles calculations, have become a new paradigm in materials modeling as they provide a desirable balance between accuracy and computational cost. The neuroevolution potential (NEP) approach, implemented in the open-source GPUMD software, has emerged as a promising machine-learned potential, exhibiting impressive accuracy and exceptional computational efficiency. This review provides a comprehensive discussion on the methodological and practical aspects of the NEP approach, along with a detailed comparison with other representative state-of-the-art MLP approaches in terms of training accuracy, property prediction, and computational efficiency. We also demonstrate the application of the NEP approach to perform accurate and efficient MD simulations, addressing complex challenges that traditional force fields typically can not tackle. Key examples include structural properties of liquid and amorphous materials, chemical order in complex alloy systems, phase transitions, surface reconstruction, material growth, primary radiation damage, fracture in two-dimensional materials, nanoscale tribology, and mechanical behavior of compositionally complex alloys under various mechanical loadings. This review concludes with a summary and perspectives on future extensions to further advance this rapidly evolving field.

Title: Control of ferroelectric domain wall dynamics by point defects: Insights from ab initio based simulations
Authors: Sheng-Han Teng, Aris Dimou, Benjamin Udofia, Majid Ghasemi, Markus Stricker, Anna Grünebohm
Abstract: The control of ferroelectric domain walls and their dynamics on the nanoscale becomes increasingly important for advanced nanoelectronics and novel computing schemes. One common approach to tackle this challenge is the pinning of walls by point defects. The fundamental understanding on how different defects influence the wall dynamics is, however, incomplete. In particular, the important class of defect dipoles in acceptor-doped ferroelectrics is currently underrepresented in theoretical work. In this study, we combine molecular dynamics simulations based on an \textit{ab\ initio}-derived effective Hamiltonian and methods from materials informatics, and analyze the impact of these defects on the motion of 180$^{\circ}$ domain walls in tetragonal BaTiO$_3$. We show how these defects can act as local pinning centers and restoring forces on the domain structure. Furthermore, we reveal how walls can flow around sparse defects by nucleation and growth of dipole clusters, and how pinning, roughening and bending of walls depend on the defect distribution. Surprisingly, the interaction between acceptor dopants and walls is short-ranged. We show that the limiting factor for the nucleation processes underlying wall motion is the defect-free area in front of the wall.

Title: Metallicity and Anomalous Hall Effect in Epitaxially-Strained, Atomically-thin RuO2 Films
Authors: Seung Gyo Jeong, Seungjun Lee, Bonnie Lin, Zhifei Yang, In Hyeok Choi, Jin Young Oh, Sehwan Song, Seung wook Lee, Sreejith Nair, Rashmi Choudhary, Juhi Parikh, Sungkyun Park, Woo Seok Choi, Jong Seok Lee, James M. LeBeau, Tony Low, Bharat Jalan
Abstract: The anomalous Hall effect (AHE), a hallmark of time-reversal symmetry breaking, has been reported in rutile RuO2, a debated metallic altermagnetic candidate. Previously, AHE in RuO2 was observed only in strain-relaxed thick films under extremely high magnetic fields (~50 T). Yet, in ultrathin strained films with distinctive anisotropic electronic structures, there are no reports, likely due to disorder and defects suppressing metallicity thus hindering its detection. Here, we demonstrate that ultrathin, fully-strained 2 nm TiO2/t nm RuO2/TiO2 (110) heterostructures, grown by hybrid molecular beam epitaxy, retain metallicity and exhibit a sizeable AHE at a significantly lower magnetic field (< 9 T). Density functional theory calculations reveal that epitaxial strain stabilizes a non-compensated magnetic ground state and reconfigures magnetic ordering in RuO2 (110) thin films. These findings establish ultrathin RuO2 as a platform for strain-engineered magnetism and underscore the transformative potential of epitaxial design in advancing spintronic technologies.

Title: CNN-based TEM image denoising from first principles
Authors: Jinwoong Chae, Sungwook Hong, Sungkyu Kim, Sungroh Yoon, Gunn Kim
Abstract: Transmission electron microscope (TEM) images are often corrupted by noise, hindering their interpretation. To address this issue, we propose a deep learning-based approach using simulated images. Using density functional theory calculations with a set of pseudo-atomic orbital basis sets, we generate highly accurate ground truth images. We introduce four types of noise into these simulations to create realistic training datasets. Each type of noise is then used to train a separate convolutional neural network (CNN) model. Our results show that these CNNs are effective in reducing noise, even when applied to images with different noise levels than those used during training. However, we observe limitations in some cases, particularly in preserving the integrity of circular shapes and avoiding visible artifacts between image patches. To overcome these challenges, we propose alternative training strategies and future research directions. This study provides a valuable framework for training deep learning models for TEM image denoising.

Title: Nonlinear Hall effect driven by spin-charge-coupled motive force
Authors: Kohei Hattori, Hikaru Watanabe, Ryotaro Arita
Abstract: Parity-time-reversal symmetric ($\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric) magnets have garnered much attention due to their spin-charge coupled dynamics enriched by the parity-symmetry breaking. By real-time simulations, we study how localized spin dynamics can affect the nonlinear Hall effect in $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric magnets. To identify the leading-order term, we derive analytical expressions for the second-order optical response and classify the contributions by considering their transformation properties under $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry. Notably, our results reveal that the sizable contribution is attributed to the mixed dipole effect, which is analogous to the Berry curvature dipole term.

Title: Electronic States and Mechanical Behaviors of Phosphorus Carbide Nanotubes -- Structural and Quantum Phase Transitions in a Quasi-one-dimensional Material
Authors: Shivam Sharma, Chenhaoyue Wang, Hsuan Ming Yu, Amartya S. Banerjee
Abstract: Quasi-one-dimensional (1D) materials can manifest exotic electronic properties in manners that are distinct from the bulk phase or other low-dimensional systems. Helical symmetries in such materials -- e.g., nanotubes with intrinsic or applied twist -- can simultaneously lead to strong electronic correlation and anomalous transport behavior. However, these materials remain underexplored, in part due to computational challenges. Using specialized symmetry-adapted first-principles calculations, we show that mono-layer $P_2C_3$ -- identified in a previous letter to possess ``double Kagome bands'' -- exhibits a number of striking properties when rolled up into phosphorous carbide nanotubes ($P_2C_3$NTs). Both armchair and zigzag $P_2C_3$NTs are stable at room temperature and display a degenerate combination of Dirac points and electronic flat bands at the Fermi level. Notably, these flat bands are highly resilient to elastic deformations. Large strains can transform the nanotube structure from honeycomb-kagome to ``brick-wall'', and trigger multiple quantum phase transitions. Edge states in $P_2C_3$NTs, spin-degeneracy lifting induced by vacancies and dopants, and strain-tunable magnetism are also discussed.

Title: High-throughput calculations of two-dimensional auxetic $M_4X_8$ with magnetism, electrocatalysis, and alkali metal battery applications
Authors: Haidi Wang, Wei Lin, Weiduo Zhu, Zhao Chen, Zhongjun Li, Xiaofeng Liu
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials with multifunctional properties, such as negative Poisson's ratio (NPR), magnetism, catalysis, and energy storage capabilities, are of significant interest for advanced applications in flexible electronics, spintronics, catalysis, and lithium-ion batteries. However, the discovery of such materials, particularly in low-dimensional forms, remains a challenge. In this study, we perform high-throughput density-functional theory (DFT) calculations to explore a new class of 2D V-shaped monolayers with remarkable physicochemical properties. Among 18 stable $M_4X_8$ (M = transition metal; X = halogen) compounds, we identify 9 auxetic monolayers, with \ce{Pd4I8} standing out for its exceptionally high NPR of -0.798. Notably, 4 of these materials exhibit half semiconductor properties, while 5 others are bipolar magnetic semiconductors, offering a unique combination of electronic and magnetic behavior. Additionally, these materials demonstrate promising catalytic activity for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER/OER) and show potential as anodes for rechargeable metal-ion batteries, particularly in alkali-ion systems. This work not only expands the family of 2D NPR materials but also introduces new candidates with multifunctional capabilities for a wide range of applications in nanoelectronics, catalysis, and energy storage.

Title: Microscopic evidence of charge- and spin-density waves in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ revealed by $^{139}$La-NQR
Authors: J. Luo, J. Feng, G. Wang, N. N. Wang, J. Dou, A. F. Fang, J. Yang, J. G. Cheng, Guo-qing Zheng, R. Zhou
Abstract: The recent discovery of superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ with a transition temperature $T_c$ close to 80 K at high pressures has attracted significant attention, due particularly to a possible density wave (DW) transition occurring near the superconducting dome. Identifying the type of DW order is crucial for understanding the origin of superconductivity in this system. However, owing to the presence of La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ and other intergrowth phases in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ samples, extracting the intrinsic information from the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ phase is challenging. In this study, we employed $^{139}$La nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) measurements to eliminate the influence of other structural phases in the sample and obtain microscopic insights into the DW transition in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$. Below the DW transition temperature $T_{\rm DW} \sim$ 153K, we observe a distinct splitting in the $\pm$ 5/2 $\leftrightarrow$ $\pm$ 7/2 transition of the NQR resonance peak at the La(2) site, while only a line broadening is seen in the $\pm$ 3/2 $\leftrightarrow$ $\pm$ 5/2 transition peak. Through further analysis of the spectra, we show that the line splitting is due to the unidirectional charge modulation. A magnetic line broadening is also observed below $T_{\rm DW}$, accompanied by a large enhancement of the spin-lattice relaxation rate, indicating the formation of magnetic ordered moments in the DW state. Our results suggest the formation of charge- and spin-density wave order in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ simultaneously, thereby offering critical insights into the electronic correlations in Ni-based superconductors.

Title: The origin of anomalous non-linear microwave absorption in Josephson junction qubits: mysterious nature of two level systems or their dynamic interaction?
Authors: Alexander L. burin
Abstract: Quantum two-level systems (TLSs) commonly found at low temperature in amorphous and disordered materials are responsible for decoherence in superconducting Josephson junction qubits particularly because they absorb energy of coherent qubit oscillations in the microwave frequency range. In planar Josephson resonators with oxide interfaces this absorption is characterized by an anomalously weak loss tangent dependence on the field in the non-linear regime that conflicts with the theoretical expectations and the observations in amorphous dielectrics. It was recently suggested that this anomalous absorption is due to TLS dynamic interactions. Here we show that such interactions cannot lead to the observed loss-tangent field dependence and suggest the alternative explanation assuming that TLS dipole moments $p$ are distributed according to the specific power law $P(p) \propto 1/p^{3-\eta}$ ($0\leq \eta <1$). This assumption, indeed, results in the observed loss tangent behavior. The hypothesis of a power law distribution is supported both by the recent measurements of individual TLS dipole moments and the theoretical model of TLS formation due to the long-range dipole-dipole interaction, thus connecting the anomalous absorption with the possible solution of the long-standing problem of the nature of TLSs.

Title: Spin-phonon coupling and thermal Hall effect in Kitaev spin liquid
Authors: Taekoo Oh, Naoto Nagaosa
Abstract: Kitaev spin liquid (KSL), consisting of the bond direction-dependent spin interactions in the honeycomb lattice, attracts huge attention because of its exact solvability and prospect for applications to quantum computing. An important feature of KSL is the half-quantized thermal Hall conductivity (HQTHC) under the magnetic field perpendicular to the lattice, but HQTHC stands only at low temperatures. Here, in the temperature range beyond the HQTHC regime, we theoretically propose the extrinsic phonon contribution to thermal Hall Effect in KSL via the skew-scattering of chiral phonons by the scalar spin chirality, which was previously studied in Mott insulators. We show the emergence of the scalar spin chirality of fluctuating spins, estimate the emergent field strength and its symmetric form applied to the chiral phonons, and obtain the associated thermal Hall conductivity, which is semi-quantitatively consistent with the existing experiments. This work provides a basic understanding of the role of spin-phonon interactions in strongly correlated systems.

Title: A Machine-Learning Bond-Order Potential for Exploring the Configuration Space of Carbon
Authors: Ikuma Kohata, Kaoru Hisama, Keigo Otsuka, Shigeo Maruyama
Abstract: Construction of transferable machine-learning interatomic potentials with a minimal number of parameters is important for their general applicability. Here, we present a machine-learning interatomic potential with the functional form of the bond-order potential for comprehensive exploration over the configuration space of carbon. The physics-based design of this potential enables robust and accurate description over a wide range of the potential energy surface with a small number of parameters. We demonstrate the versatility of this potential through validations across various tasks, including phonon dispersion calculations, global structure searches for clusters, phase diagram calculations, and enthalpy-volume mappings of local minima structures. We expect that this potential can contribute to the discovery of novel carbon materials.

Title: Overdamped van der Waals Josephson junctions by area engineering
Authors: Annu Anns Sunny, H Choubey, A Khola, S Narayanan, R Bharadwaj, P Gireesan, Madhu Thalakulam
Abstract: Van der Waals (vW) Josephson junctions (JJs) realized by stacking materials such as few-layered NbSe2, offers a new landscape to realize superconducting quantum devices with superior properties owing to its crystalline nature and defect-free junctions. For quantum technology, overdamped JJs are highly sought-after, whose realization demands precise control of junction capacitance by engineering the junction area using microfabrication techniques. NbSe2 is highly reactive and susceptible to damage during microfabrication processes. In this manuscript, we demonstrate both underdamped and overdamped NbSe2-NbSe2 JJs by controlling the junction area. We devise a minimally invasive microfabrication procedure, post-junction formation, to precisely control the junction area. The McCumber parameter characterizing the damping is extracted from the electrical transport measurements down to 130 mK. The results show that our sample fabrication recipe has preserved the material qualities and paved the way for the realization of scalable JJ devices on NbSe2 and similar systems.

Title: Power-efficiency trade-off for finite-time quantum harmonic Otto heat engine via phase-space approach
Authors: Hyun-Myung Chun, Jong-Min Park
Abstract: Thermodynamic constraints impose a trade-off between power and efficiency in heat engines, preventing the simultaneous achievement of high power and high efficiency. For classical microscopic engines, explicit inequalities have been discovered, demonstrating the inherent inevitability of this power-efficiency trade-off. However, extensions of these results to quantum engines have so far been limited to cases of slow operation. In this study, we derive a power-efficiency trade-off relation for a paradigmatic quantum engine operating within a finite time, specifically the Otto cycle of a quantum harmonic oscillator. By utilizing a phase-space approach based on quasi-probability representations, we establish a universal trade-off relation applicable to arbitrary time-dependent protocols during the adiabatic processes. Our results reveal that the power of the quantum engine vanishes as the efficiency approaches the quantum mechanical efficiency bound, which is stricter than the Carnot bound. Furthermore, we identify the conditions under which the upper bound is attained, which indicate maximum power is achieved when the generation of quantum coherence is reduced, and the difference in time durations of the isochoric processes increases. These findings are validated through numerical calculations, which confirm their applicability across various types of protocols for heat engine cycles.

Title: Direct ab initio calculation of magnons in altermagnets: method, spin-space symmetry aspects, and application to MnTe
Authors: L. M. Sandratskii, K. Carva, V. M. Silkin
Abstract: We suggest the method for direct ab initio calculation of magnons in complex collinear magnets. The method is based on the density-functional-theory calculation under two different constraints: one constraint governs the change of the magnetization with respect to the ground state, and the other is the symmetry constraint responsible for the value of the magnon wave vector. The performance of the method is demonstrated by the application to an altermagnet MnTe. An important role in both the formulation and the application of the method play the aspects of generalized symmetry described by the spin-space groups. The symmetry analysis connects in one coherent picture the following three parts of the consideration: (i) the generalized translational symmetry of the magnons as a crucial condition for their efficient ab-initio calculation, (ii) altermagnetic spin-splitting of the electron states in the ground magnetic state, and (iii) chirality splitting of the magnon excitations. It is demonstrated that both the spin splitting of the electron states and the chirality splitting of the magnons have identical patterns in the corresponding wave vector spaces. Since the altermagnetism of MnTe is the consequence of the presence of the Te atoms, an adequate attention is devoted to the symmetry analysis and calculation results for the Te moments induced in the magnon states. The knowledge of the symmetry properties of the Te moments allows to accelerate the numerical convergence of the magnon states and serves as a test for the accuracy of the calculations. To expose the connection between electron band structures of the magnon states of the system and the chirality properties of these states we investigate the transformation of the electron structure in the transition from the collinear ground state to a noncollinear magnon state.

Title: Active chemo-mechanical solitons
Authors: Lev Truskinovsky, Giuseppe Zurlo
Abstract: In many biological systems localized mechanical information is transmitted by mechanically neutral chemical signals. Typical examples include contraction waves in acto-myosin cortex at cellular scale and peristaltic waves at tissue level. In such systems, chemical activity is transformed into mechanical deformation by distributed motor-type mechanisms represented by continuum degrees of freedom. To elucidate the underlying principles of chemo-mechanical coupling, we present in this Letter the simplest example. It involves directional motion of a localized solitary wave in a distributed mechanical system guided by a purely chemical cue. Our main result is that mechanical signals can be driven by chemical activity in a highly efficient manner.

Title: Effect of Te doping in GeSe parent thick film by experimental in situ temperature-dependent structural investigation
Authors: P. Armand (ICGM, UM), R. Escalier (ICGM, UM), G. Silly (ICGM, UM), J. Lizion (ICGM, UM), A. Piarristeguy (ICGM, UM)
Abstract: As-deposited and unencapsulated GeSe$_{1-x}$Te$_x$ ($x = 0, 0.25$) 3-$\mu$m-thick amorphous films on Si(001) were obtained via the co-evaporation technique to study the effect of selenium (Se) substitution for tellurium (Te) on the GeSe parent structure in the function of the heating temperature. In situ, grazing-incidence X-ray scattering (XRS), and fluorescence X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure (XANES) data were collected in isochronal annealing conditions under nitrogen flow. The results show that the onset temperature of crystallization $T_c$ and the crystallized phase symmetry are susceptible to the Te 25 at. % doping. Furthermore, Ge and Se K-edge XANES analyses reveal significant alterations in the local atomic environments surrounding Ge and Se atoms during the transition from the amorphous to the crystalline state. These modifications are accompanied by an observable increase in local structural disorder upon substitution with Te atoms.

Title: A simple magnetic field stabilization technique for atomic Bose-Einstein condensate experiments
Authors: S Tiengo (IOGS), R Eid (IOGS), M Apfel (IOGS), G Brulin (IOGS), T Bourdel (IOGS)
Abstract: We demonstrate a simple magnetic field stabilization technique in a Bose-Einstein condensate experiment. Our technique is based on the precise measurement of the current fluctuations in the main magnetic field coils and amounts to their compensation using an auxiliary coil. It has the advantage of simplicity as compensation is done using a low inductance coil that can be straightforwardly driven at the relevant frequencies (1 kHz). The performances of the different components (power supply, current transducer, electronics...) are precisely characterized. In addition, for optimal stability the ambient magnetic field is also measured and compensated. The magnetic field stability around 57 G is measured by Ramsey spectroscopy of magnetic field sensitive radiofrequency transition between two spin states of potassium 39 and the shot-to-shot fluctuations are reduced to 64(7) $\mu$G rms, i.e. at the 1 x 10 -6 level. In the context of our experiment, this result opens interesting prospects for the study of three-body interactions in Bose-Einstein condensate potassium spin mixtures.

Abstract: Superconductivity in the bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ occurs when the interlayer Ni-O-Ni bond angle becomes straight under pressure, suggesting a strong relationship between the crystal structure and the emergence of superconductivity. In this study, we theoretically propose a way to control the crystal structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ toward the tetragonal symmetry via light irradiation instead of pressure using the idea of nonlinear phononics. Here, resonant optical excitation of an infrared-active (IR) lattice vibration induces a nonlinear Raman-mode displacement through the anharmonic phonon-phonon coupling. We calculate the light-induced phonon dynamics on the anharmonic lattice potential determined by first-principles calculation. We find that the interlayer Ni-O-Ni bond angle gets slightly closer to straight when an appropriate IR mode is selectively excited. Our study suggests that light irradiation can be a promising way for structural control of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.

Title: Band representations in Strongly Correlated Settings: The Kitaev Honeycomb Model
Authors: Axel Fünfhaus, Mikel García-Díez, M. G. Vergniory, Thilo Kopp, Stephen M. Winter, Roser Valentí
Abstract: In the study of quantum spin liquids, the Kitaev model plays a pivotal role due to the fact that its ground state is exactly known as well as the fact that it may be realized in strongly frustrated materials such as ${\alpha}$-RuCl${}_3$. While topological insulators and superconductors can be investigated by means of topological band theory -- in particular the topological quantum chemistry (TQC) formalism -- the Kitaev model evades such a treatment, as it is not possible to set up a proper single-particle Green's function for it. We instead associate spin operators with ``orbitals'' that give rise to a band structure. It is thereby possible to analyze the corresponding excitation spectrum engendered by these localized excitations by means of TQC. Special attention is given to the low-energy topological edge mode spectrum. Our work sheds light on the question how the TQC formalism may be generalized to strongly correlated and topologically ordered systems like the Kitaev model.

Title: Probing Coherences and Itinerant Magnetism in a Dipolar Lattice Gas
Authors: Thomas Lauprêtre, Ana Maria Rey, Laurent Vernac, Bruno Laburthe-Tolra
Abstract: We report on the study of itinerant magnetism of lattice-trapped magnetic atoms, driven by magnetic dipole-dipole interactions, in the low-entropy and close-to-unit filling regime. We have used advanced dynamical decoupling techniques to efficiently suppress the sensitivity to magnetic field fluctuations. We have thus measured the spin coherence of an itinerant spin 3 Bose dipolar gas throughout a quantum phase transition from a superfluid phase to a Mott insulating phase. In the superfluid phase, a metastable ferromagnetic behavior is observed below a dynamical instability which occurs at lattice depths below the phase transition. In the insulating phase, the thermalization towards a paramagnetic state is driven by an interplay between intersite and superexchange interactions.

Title: Influence of coupling symmetries and noise on the critical dynamics of synchronizing oscillator lattices
Authors: Ricardo Gutierrez, Rodolfo Cuerno
Abstract: Recent work has shown that the synchronization process in lattices of self-sustained (phase and limit-cycle) oscillators displays universal scale-invariant behavior previously studied in the physics of surface kinetic roughening. The type of dynamic scaling ansatz which is verified depends on the randomness that occurs in the system, whether it is columnar disorder (quenched noise given by the random assignment of natural frequencies), leading to anomalous scaling, or else time-dependent noise, inducing the more standard Family-Vicsek dynamic scaling ansatz, as in equilibrium critical dynamics. The specific universality class also depends on the coupling function: for a sine function (as in the celebrated Kuramoto model) the critical behavior is that of the Edwards-Wilkinson equation for the corresponding type of randomness, with Gaussian fluctuations around the average growth. In all the other cases investigated, Tracy-Widom fluctuations ensue, associated with the celebrated Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation for rough interfaces. Two questions remain to be addressed in order to complete the picture, however: 1) Is the atypical scaling displayed by the sine coupling preserved if other coupling functions satisfying the same (odd) symmetry are employed (as suggested by continuum approximations and symmetry arguments)? and 2) how does the competition between both types of randomness (which are expected to coexist in experimental settings) affect the nonequilibrium behavior? We address the latter question by numerically characterizing the crossover between thermal-noise and columnar-disorder criticality, and the former by providing evidence confirming that it is the symmetry of the coupling function that sets apart the sine coupling, among other odd-symmetric couplings, due to the absence of Kardar-Parisi-Zhang fluctuations.

Title: Stability and Nucleation of Dipole Strings in Uniaxial Chiral Magnets
Authors: Vladyslav M. Kuchkin, Nikolai S. Kiselev, Andreas Haller, Štefan Liščák, Andreas Michels, Thomas L. Schmidt
Abstract: We report on the stability of the magnetic dipole string (DS), a three-dimensional magnetic texture formed by two coupled Bloch points with opposite topological charges, separated by an equilibrium distance. Previous studies demonstrated the stability of such configurations through geometric confinement or coupling with local perturbations in the magnetization field, such as skyrmion strings or dislocations in helical modulations. Here, we show that, in uniaxial chiral magnets, an isolated DS remains stable in an unperturbed vacuum, thus representing a true three-dimensional soliton. The phase diagram illustrates the stability of the DS embedded in the conical or helical phases across a broad range of material parameters and external magnetic fields. Using the geodesic nudged elastic band method applied to a regularized micromagnetic model, we demonstrate that isolated DSs are protected from collapse by an energy barrier. Stochastic spin-lattice simulations demonstrate that DSs can spontaneously nucleate during in-field annealing. This work aims to stimulate the experimental observation of DSs and further exploration of uniaxial chiral magnets.

Title: Stochastic bubble dynamics in phase-separated scalar active matter
Authors: Mingqi Yan, Erwin Frey, Marcus Müller, Stefan Klumpp
Abstract: In ABP systems, phase separation is accompanied by the emergence of vapor bubbles within liquid domains. Using large-scale particle-based simulations, we study the stochastic dynamics of these bubbles and find that most nucleate, grow, and dissolve within liquid domains. We show that their area dynamics can be described by a Langevin equation with a constant negative drift and noise proportional to the perimeter, fully characterizing bubble area and lifetime statistics. Additionally, we develop a lattice gas model that captures the morphological properties, including the decrease in bubble asphericity with increasing area. These findings provide new insights into phase separation in active matter and highlight limitations in current continuum theories.

Title: Nitrogen-Vacancy Centers in Epitaxial Laterally Overgrown Diamond: Towards Up-scaling of Color Center-based Quantum Technologies
Authors: Nimba Oshnik, Sebastian Westrich, Nina Burmeister, Oliver Roman Opaluch, Lahcene Mehmel, Riadh Issaoui, Alexandre Tallaire, Ovidiu Brinza, Jocelyn Achard, Elke Neu
Abstract: Providing high-quality, single-crystal diamond (SCD) with a large area is desirable for up-scaling quantum technology applications that rely on color centers in diamond. Growth methods aiming to increase the area of SCD are an active research area. Native color centers offer a sensitive probe for local crystal quality in such novel materials e.g., via their reaction to stress. In this work, we investigate individual native nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in SCD layers manufactured via laterally overgrowing hole arrays in a heteroepitaxially grown large-scale substrate. Heteroepitaxy has become a common tool for growing large SCDs; however, achieving the high crystal quality needed for quantum applications remains a challenge. In the overgrown layer, we identify NV centers with spin-decoherence times in the order of hundreds of microseconds, comparable to high-purity homoepitaxial SCD. We quantify the effective crystal strain in different regions of the overgrown layer, indicating a low stress overall and a stress reduction in the diamond layer above the holes.

Title: Influence of the pretreatment anneal on Co germanide Schottky contacts
Authors: L. Lajaunie, M.L. David, F. Pailloux, C. Tromas, E. Simoen, C. Claeys, J.F. Barbot
Abstract: A thin cobalt layer is deposited by electron beam evaporation onto a germanium substrate after an in situ cleaning annealing at 400 or 700 C. The effect of these pretreatments on the Co/Ge Schottky barrier properties and on the germanide formation is investigated by using different techniques. A strong influence of the pre-treatment is observed. The pre-treatment at 700 C removes the native oxide but enhances the diffusion of contaminants. After post-metal deposition annealing, the sample pre-treated at 700 C shows a double layer structure due to interdiffusion, whereas some large isolated islands are present in the sample pre-treated at 400 C.

Title: Laser-driven resonant soft-X-ray scattering for probing picosecond dynamics of nanometre-scale order
Authors: Leonid Lunin, Martin Borchert, Niklas Schneider, Konstanze Korell, Michael Schneider, Dieter Engel, Stefan Eisebitt, Bastian Pfau, Daniel Schick
Abstract: X-ray scattering has been an indispensable tool in advancing our understanding of matter, from the first evidence of the crystal lattice to recent discoveries of nuclei's fastest dynamics. In addition to the lattice, ultrafast resonant elastic scattering of soft X-rays provides a sensitive probe of charge, spin, and orbital order with unparalleled nanometre spatial and femto- to picosecond temporal resolution. However, the full potential of this technique remains largely unexploited due to its high demand on the X-ray source. Only a selected number of instruments at large-scale facilities can deliver the required short-pulsed and wavelength-tunable radiation, rendering laboratory-scale experiments elusive so far. Here, we demonstrate time-resolved X-ray scattering with spectroscopic contrast at a laboratory-based instrument using the soft-X-ray radiation emitted from a laser-driven plasma source. Specifically, we investigate the photo-induced response of magnetic domains emerging in a ferrimagnetic heterostructure with 9$\,$ps temporal resolution. The achieved sensitivity allows for tracking the reorganisation of the domain network on pico- to nanosecond time scales in great detail. This instrumental development and experimental demonstration break new ground for studying material dynamics in a wide range of laterally ordered systems in a flexible laboratory environment.

Title: Geometrical Responses of Generalized Landau Levels: Structure Factor and the Quantized Hall Viscosity
Authors: Carolina Paiva, Jie Wang, Tomoki Ozawa, Bruno Mera
Abstract: We present a new geometric characterization of generalized Landau levels (GLLs). The GLLs are a generalization of Landau levels to non-uniform Berry curvature, and are mathematically defined in terms of a holomorphic curve -- an ideal Kähler band -- and its associated unitary Frenet-Serret moving frame. Here, we find that GLLs are harmonic maps from the Brillouin zone to the complex projective space and they are critical points of the Dirichlet energy functional, as well as the static structure factor up to fourth order. We also find that filled GLLs exhibit quantized Hall viscosity, similar to the ordinary Landau levels. These results establish GLLs as a versatile generalization of Landau levels.

Title: SANS evidence for the dispersion of nanoparticles in W-1Y$_2$O$_3$ and W-1La$_2$O$_3$ processed by hot isostatic pressing
Authors: A. Munoz, J. Martinez, M.A. Monge, B. Savoini, R. Pareja, A. Radulescu
Abstract: The development of dispersion of nanoparticles in the W-1%Y$_2$O$_3$ and W-1%La$_2$O$_3$ (wt%) alloys processed by hot isostatic pressing has been investigated using small angle neutron scattering. The mode values of these centers are found at 10 and 40 nm in W-1%Y$_2$O$_3$, and 15 and 80 nm in W-1%La$_2$O$_3$. The scanning electron microscopy analyses showed the presence of small second phase particles. The contribution of the pore space to the scattering curves has been analyzed using the results obtained for pure W processed following the same procedure used for the alloys, and the porosity measurements of the samples.

Title: Nanostructured thin films of indium oxide nanocrystals confined in alumina matrixes
Authors: A. Bouifoulen, M. Edely, N. Errien, A. Kassiba, A. Outzourhit, M. Makowska-Janusik, N. Gautier, L. Lajaunie, A. Oueriagli
Abstract: Nanocrystals of indium oxide (In$_2$O$_3$) with sizes below 10 nm were prepared in alumina matrixes by using a co-pulverization method. The used substrates such as borosilicate glasses or (100) silicon as well as the substrate temperatures during the deposition process were modified and their effects characterized on the structural and physical properties of alumina-In$_2$O$_3$ films. Complementary investigation methods including X-ray diffraction, optical transmittance in the range 250-1100 nm and transmission electron microscopy were used to analyze the nanostructured films. The crystalline order, morphology and optical responses were monitored as function of the deposition parameters and the post-synthesis annealing. The optimal conditions were found and allow realizing suitable nanostructured films with a major crystalline order of cubic phase for the In$_2$O$_3$ nanocrystals. The optical properties of the films were analyzed and the key parameters such as direct and indirect band gaps were evaluated as function of the synthesis conditions and the crystalline quality of the films.

Title: Navigating the Complexities of Multiple Redox State Interactions in Aqueous Systems
Authors: Shishir Mundra, Mohit Pundir, Barbara Lothenbach, David S. Kammer, Ueli M. Angst
Abstract: Numerous aqueous systems host elements in multiple redox states, with wide ranging implications such as their influence on the formation/dissolution of minerals, water toxicity, and nutrient cycling. To uncover governing mechanisms and complex chemical interactions in aqueous systems, reactive-transport models have increasingly gained importance. However, their predictive capabilities remain limited because existing approaches struggle to accurately account for the full complexities of redox reactions. Here, we develop a reactive-transport framework that leverages recent advancements in thermodynamic modelling, speciation chemistry, and redox kinetics. Distinct from traditional models, we uniquely treat redox kinetics along with transport as transient phenomena, decoupled from Gibbs free energy minimisation. Ensuring ion concentrations are governed by non-equilibrium rate laws, this approach allows predicting the tempo-spatial distribution of speciation and precipitation of species across oxidation states. We illustrate the versatility of our framework through two case studies: manganese speciation in natural waters and the fate of dissolved iron in aqueous/porous media. Our framework significantly enhances the modelling of a diverse range of redox-sensitive environments.

Title: Green's Function Approach to Josephson Dot Dynamics and Application to Quantum Mpemba Effects
Authors: Kateryna Zatsarynna, Andrea Nava, Reinhold Egger, Alex Zazunov
Abstract: We develop a Green's function approach for the nonequilibrium dynamics of multi-level quantum dots coupled to multiple fermionic reservoirs in the presence of a bosonic environment. Our theory is simpler than the Keldysh approach and goes beyond scattering state constructions. In concrete terms, we study Josephson junctions containing a quantum dot and coupled to an electromagnetic environment. In the dot region, spin-orbit interactions, a Zeeman field, and in principle also Coulomb interactions can be included. We then study quantum Mpemba effects, assuming that the average phase difference across the Josephson junction is subject to a rapid quench. For a short singlechannel junction, we show that both types of quantum Mpemba effects allowed in open quantum systems are possible. We also study an intermediate-length junction, where spin-orbit interactions and a Zeeman field are included. Again quantum Mpemba effects are predicted.

Title: The $(2+\delta)$-dimensional theory of the electromechanics of lipid membranes: III. Constitutive models
Authors: Yannick A. D. Omar, Zachary G. Lipel, Kranthi K. Mandadapu
Abstract: This article concludes a three-part series developing a self-consistent theoretical framework of the electromechanics of lipid membranes at the continuum scale. Owing to their small thickness, lipid membranes are commonly modeled as two-dimensional surfaces. However, this approach breaks down when considering their electromechanical behavior as it requires accounting for their thickness. To address this, we developed a dimension reduction procedure in part 1 to derive effective surface theories explicitly capturing the thickness of lipid membranes. We applied this method to dimensionally reduce Gauss' law and the electromechanical balance laws and referred to the resulting theory as $(2+\delta)$-dimensional, where $\delta$ indicates the membrane thickness. However, the $(2+\delta)$-dimensional balance laws derived in part 2 are general, and specific material models are required to specialize them to lipid membranes. In this work, we devise appropriate three-dimensional constitutive models that capture the in-plane fluid and out-of-plane elastic behavior of lipid membranes. The viscous behavior is recovered by a three-dimensional Newtonian fluid model, leading to the same viscous stresses as strictly two-dimensional models. The elastic resistance to bending is recovered by imposing a free energy penalty on local volume changes. While this gives rise to the characteristic bending resistance of lipid membranes, it differs in its higher-order curvature terms from the Canham-Helfrich-Evans theory. Furthermore, motivated by the small mid-surface stretch of lipid membranes, we introduce reactive stresses that enforce mid-surface incompressibility, resulting in an effective surface tension. Finally, we use the constitutive and reactive stresses to derive the equations of motion describing the electromechanics of lipid membranes.

Title: Dynamics of local photoconductivity in GaAs and InP investigated by THz SNOM
Authors: Tinkara Troha, Arvind Singh, Petr Kužel, Hynek Němec
Abstract: Terahertz scanning near-field optical microscope (THz-SNOM) is employed to measure ultrafast evolution of THz conductivity spectra after photoexcitation of GaAs and InP wafers using ultrashort laser pulses. Unlike in GaAs, the THz photoconductivity decay in InP is controlled mainly by the diffusion of electrons away from the photoexcited area, and also by the drift due to band-bending at the surface of the semiconductor. We propose and discuss several general strategies of the analysis of signals measured using THz-SNOM, and we estimate the accuracy of the obtained near-field photoconductivity spectra.

Title: Relaxation times under pulsed ponderomotive forces and the Central Limit Theorem
Authors: Juan-Luis Domenech-Garret
Abstract: We study the relaxation time of a plasma which is perturbed by means of a time-dependent pulsed force. This time pulse is modelled using a Gaussian superposition. During such a pulse two forces are considered: An inhomogeneous oscillating electric force and the corresponding ponderomotive force. The evolution of such an ensemble is driven by the Boltzmann Equation, and the perturbed population is described by a power-law distribution function. In this work, as a new feature, instead the usual techniques the transient between both distributions is analysed using the Central Limit Theorem. This technique, together with the ad hoc solved equation of motion of the charges under this particular system of pulsed forces, allows to find the corresponding expressions relating the time pulse with the relaxation times and the dynamic conditions. Furthermore, numerical estimates are also presented. As a result, we show a persistence effect of excitation at high frequencies, when the initial excitation pulse has already ended. The concatenation of such successive pulses could be of interest, for example, in experimental applications with pulsed lasers.

Title: Andreev spin relaxation time in a shadow-evaporated InAs weak link
Authors: Haoran Lu, David F. Bofill, Zhenhai Sun, Thomas Kanne, Jesper Nygård, Morten Kjaergaard, Valla Fatemi
Abstract: Andreev spin qubits are a new qubit platform that merges superconductivity with semiconductor physics. The mechanisms dominating observed energy relaxation remain unidentified. We report here on three steps taken to address these questions in an InAs nanowire weak link. First, we designed a microwave readout circuit tuned to be directly sensitive to the spin-dependent inductance of the weak link so that higher orbital states are not necessary for readout -- this resulted in larger windows in parameter space in which the spin state properties can be probed. Second, we implemented a successful gap-engineering strategy to mitigate quasiparticle poisoning. Third, the weak link was fabricated by \textit{in situ} shadow evaporation, which has been shown to improve atomic-scale disorder. We show how our design allows characterization of the spin stability and coherence over the full range of magnetic flux and gate voltage of an odd parity bias point. The spin relaxation and dephasing rates are comparable with the best devices previously reported, suggestive that surface atomic-scale disorder and QP poisoning are not linked to spin relaxation in InAs nanowires. Our design strategies are transferrable to novel materials platforms for Andreev qubits such as germanium and carbon.

Title: Mapping the Configuration Space of Half-Heusler Compounds via Subspace Identification for Thermoelectric Materials Discovery
Authors: Angela Pak, Kamil Ciesielski, Maria Wróblewska, Eric S. Toberer, Elif Ertekin
Abstract: Half-Heuslers are a promising family for thermoelectric (TE) applications, yet only a small fraction of their potential chemistries has been experimentally explored. In this work, we introduce a distinct computational high-throughput screening approach designed to identify underexplored yet promising material subspaces, and apply it to half-Heusler thermoelectrics. We analyze 1,126 half-Heuslers satisfying the $``$18 valence electron rule $''$, including 332 predicted to be semiconductors, using electronic structure calculations, semi-empirical transport models, and thermoelectric quality factor $\beta$. Unlike conventional filtering workflows, our approach employs statistical analysis of candidate material groups to uncover trends in their collective behavior, providing robust insights and minimizing reliance on uncertain predictions for individual compounds. Our findings link $n$-type performance to ultra-high mobility at conduction band edges and $p$-type performance to high band degeneracy. Statistical correlations reveal elemental subspaces associated with high $\beta$. We identify two primary (Y- and Zr-containing) and two secondary (Au- and Ir-containing) subspaces that reinforce key physical design principles, making them promising candidates for further exploration. These recommendations align with previous experimental results on yttrium pnictides. Inspired by these insights, we synthesize and characterize rare-earth gold stannides (REAuSn), finding Sc$_{0.5}$Lu$_{0.5}$AuSn to exhibit low thermal conductivity (0.9-2.3 Wm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$ at 650 K). This work demonstrates alternative strategies for high throughput screening when using approximate but unbiased models, and offers predictive tools and design strategies for optimizing half-Heusler chemistries for TE performance.

Title: Imaging signatures of edge currents in a magnetic topological insulator
Authors: G. M. Ferguson, Run Xiao, Anthony R. Richardella, Austin Kaczmarek, Nitin Samarth, Katja C. Nowack
Abstract: Magnetic topological insulators (MTIs) host topologically protected edge states, but the role that these edge states play in electronic transport remains unclear. Using scanning superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) microscopy, we performed local measurements of the current distribution in a quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) insulator at large bias currents, where the quantization of the conductivity tensor breaks down. We find that bulk currents in the channel interior coexist with edge currents at the sample boundary. While the position of the edge current changes with the reversal of the magnetic field, it does not depend on the current direction. To understand our observations, we introduce a model which includes contributions from both the sample magnetization and currents driven by chemical potential gradients. To parameterize our model, we use local measurements of the chemical potential induced changes in the sample magnetization. Our model reveals that the observed edge currents can be understood as changes in the magnetization generated by the electrochemical potential distribution in the sample under bias. Our work underscores the complexity of electronic transport in MTIs and highlights both the value and challenges of using magnetic imaging to disentangle various contributions to the electronic transport signatures.

Title: Quantum confining excitons with electrostatic moir\'e superlattice
Authors: Liuxin Gu, Lifu Zhang, Sam Felsenfeld, Rundong Ma, Suji Park, Houk Jang, Takashi Taniguchi, Kenji Watanabe, You Zhou
Abstract: Quantum confining excitons has been a persistent challenge in the pursuit of strong exciton interactions and quantum light generation. Unlike electrons, which can be readily controlled via electric fields, imposing strong nanoscale potentials on excitons to enable quantum confinement has proven challenging. In this study, we utilize piezoresponse force microscopy to image the domain structures of twisted hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), revealing evidence of strong in-plane electric fields at the domain boundaries. By placing a monolayer MoSe2 only one to two nanometers away from the twisted hBN interface, we observe energy splitting of neutral excitons and Fermi polarons by several millielectronvolts at the moiré domain boundaries. By directly correlating local structural and optical properties, we attribute such observations to excitons confined in a nanoscale one-dimensional electrostatic potential created by the strong in-plane electric fields at the moiré domain boundaries. Intriguingly, this 1D quantum confinement results in pronounced polarization anisotropy in the excitons' reflection and emission, persistent to temperatures as high as ~80 Kelvins. These findings open new avenues for exploring and controlling strongly interacting excitons for classical and quantum optoelectronics.

Title: Atomistic Modeling of Martensitic Phase Transition in Hexamethylbenzene
Authors: Zarif Fahim, Pedro A. Santos-Florez, Qiang Zhu
Abstract: Materials exhibiting a martensitic phase transition are essential for applications in shape memory alloys, actuators and sensors. Hexamethylbenzene (HMB) has long been considered as a classical example of ferroelastic organic crystals since Mnyukh's pioneering work in 1970s. However, the atomistic mechanism underlying this phase transition has never been clarified. In this work, we present a direct molecular dynamics simulation to investigate the phase transition mechanism in HMB. For the first time, we report a simulation results that can accurately reproduce both the transition temperature and hysteresis loop observed in previous experimental studies. By analyzing the MD trajectories, the potential energy surface, we identified that a low-barrier atomic sliding mode along the close-packed (11$\overline{1}$) plane of the low-temperature phase is the key to trigger the phase transition at the critical temperature window. This is further confirmed by the observed continuous softening of shear modulus around the transition window. Our results demonstrate that the integration of various atomistic modeling techniques can provide invaluable insight into the martensitic phase transition mechanisms in organic crystals and guide the development of new organic martensites.

Title: Nanopillar-Driven Antibacterial Surfaces: Elucidating Bactericidal Mechanisms and Engineering Nanostructures for Enhanced Efficacy
Authors: Akash Singh, Yi Zhang, Qing Cao, Yumeng Li
Abstract: Insects like dragonflies and cicadas possess nanoprotusions on their wings that rupture bacterial membranes upon contact, inspiring synthetic antibacterial surfaces mimicking this phenomenon. Designing such biomimetic surfaces requires understanding the mechanical interaction between nanopillars and bacterial membranes. However, the small scales of these interactions pose challenges. Molecular Dynamics simulations offer precise and efficient modeling at these scales. This study presents a coarse-grained membrane model to explore the mechanical responses of gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial membranes to nanopillar arrays. By varying bacterial shapes (spherical and cylindrical), membrane bending rigidity, and loading rates, we identified two distinct failure mechanisms. Low bending rigidity, typical of gram-negative bacteria, leads to tearing near nanopillar tips, contrary to prior assumptions. High bending rigidity, characteristic of gram-positive bacteria, results in puncturing at contact points. Gram-positive bacteria are more resistant, requiring a threefold increase in loading rate for effective piercing. Nanopillar height and spacing also critically impact bactericidal efficacy: greater heights enhance activity beyond a critical threshold, while increased spacing reduces efficacy. This simplified coarse-grained model, representing bacterial membranes with high fidelity, enables cost-effective, full-scale simulations over extended periods. Our findings provide essential insights for optimizing nanopillared surface designs, advancing antibacterial technology through tailored height and spacing configurations.

Title: Double-tough ceramics: Optimization-supported multiscale computational design
Authors: Jian Zhang, Francesco Aiello, Mauro Salazar, Diletta Giuntini
Abstract: To overcome the brittleness limitation of ceramics, various toughening mechanisms have been proposed. Some of the most remarkable, especially for oxides, include the tetragonal-to-monoclinic phase transformation leading to crack shielding in zirconia, and bioinspired brick-and-mortar microstructures fostering crack deflection. It has, however, proven challenging to incorporate both these mechanisms into a single all-ceramic material. In this work, we propose a computational methodology for the design of a material that combines these two toughening strategies, using a multiscale modeling approach that captures both their individual contributions and the overall fracture performance. This is achieved by developing an all-ceramic composite with a brick-and-mortar microstructure, in which the nanocrystalline mortar is transformation-toughened. Key factors influencing phase transformation, such as grain boundary properties, grain orientations, and kinetic coefficients, are analyzed, and the resulting transformation stress-strain behavior is incorporated into the microscale mortar constitutive model. We demonstrate that the synergistic effect of the two toughening mechanisms is achievable, and that it is an extremely effective strategy to boost fracture performance. The influence of brick size, mortar thickness, and properties of the constituent materials is then systematically investigated. Finally, a gradient-free optimization algorithm is employed to identify optimal geometric and material parameters, revealing that longer, thinner bricks with minimal mortar thickness provide the best fracture resistance. Optimal combinations of material properties are identified for given brick sizes and mortar thicknesses.

Title: Quantum-Geometric Spin- and Charge Josephson Diode Effects
Authors: Niklas L. Schulz, Danilo Nikolić, Matthias Eschrig
Abstract: We present a general mechanism for large charge and spin Josephson diode effects in strongly spin-polarized superconductor-ferromagnet hybrid structures with a noncoplanar spin texture, formulated in terms of quantum-geometric phases. We present necessary conditions for this effect to occur, and show numerical results for disordered materials, relevant for applications. We calculate Josephson diode efficiencies for both charge- and spin-diodes and show that a spin-diode efficiency of 100% can be reached. Finally, we present a SQUID device that can switch between nearly pure spin-up and spin-down equal-spin supercurrents across the ferromagnet by reversing the flux. These findings establish functionalities that are absent for coplanar spin textures.

Title: Strain induced topological phase transitions in split and line graphs of bipartite lattices featuring flat bands
Authors: Shivam Sharma, Amartya S. Banerjee
Abstract: In recent years, materials with topological flat bands have attracted significant attention due to their association with extraordinary transport properties and strongly correlated electrons. This includes phenomena such as high-temperature superconductivity, magnetism, Wigner crystallization, and Mott-insulating behavior. Among these systems, two-dimensional (2D) materials are particularly compelling as they can host electronic states with unique band structures, such as dispersionless states alongside linearly dispersive Dirac cones. In this work, we use tight-binding models to comprehensively investigate a class of 2D lattices that generically support flat bands, and focus on the effects of strain on their electronic and topological properties. The studied lattices are constructed within a unifying graph-theoretic framework, whereupon split-graph and line-graph operations on bipartite square and hexagonal lattices are employed to generate new structures. In the absence of strain, the introduction of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) induces a bulk excitation gap, which transforms flat bands into quasi-flat bands with topologically nontrivial characteristics. By tuning system parameters and external strain, we observe the emergence of directional flat bands, and tilted and semi-Dirac cones. Remarkably, all lattices studied show phase transitions among trivial insulating, semimetallic, and topological phases. Our results highlight the potential of strain engineering as a versatile tool for manipulating electronic and topological phases in a wide variety of 2D materials.

Title: Self-aligned multilayered nitrogen vacancy diamond nanoparticles for high spatial resolution magnetometry of microelectronic currents
Authors: Yash Gokhale, Brandon S Coventry, Tsani Rogers, Maya Lines, Anna Vena, Jack Phillips, Tianxiang Zhu, Ilhan Bok, Dariana J. Troche, Mitchell Glodowski, Adam Vareberg, Suyash Bhatt, Alireza Ashtiani, Kevin W. Eliceiri, Aviad Hai
Abstract: Nitrogen Vacancy diamond nanoparticles (NVNPs) are increasingly integrated with methods for optical detection of magnetic resonance (ODMR), providing new opportunities in magnetic characterization that span the visualization of magnetic fields in microelectronic circuits, environmental sensing and biology. However, only a small number of studies utilize aggregates of NVNPs for surface-wide magnetometry being that spin orientations in aggregate NVNPs are inherently misaligned, precluding their use for proper magnetic field detection compared with expensive monocrystalline diamonds. A postprocessing method for layering NVNPs with aligned NV center orientations can potentially facilitate superior NV magnetometry by allowing sensitive detection combined with simplified probe preparation. We present a novel technology for creating densely stacked monolayers of NVNP with inherent interlayer alignment for sensitive measurement of local magnetic field perturbations in microelectronic traces. We establish spatial characteristics of deposited aggregates and demonstrate their ability to capture magnetic dipoles from conducting microwires via ODMR. Our approach forms a novel accessible protocol that can be used for broad applications in micromagnetometry.

Title: Influence of conjugated structure for tunable molecular plasmons in peropyrene and its derivatives
Authors: Haoran Liu, Nan Gao, Yurui Fang
Abstract: Advances in research have sparked an increasing curiosity in understanding the plasmonic excitation properties of molecular-scale systems. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, as the fundamental building blocks of graphene, have been documented to possess plasmonic properties through experimental observations, making them prime candidates for investigation. By doping different elements, the conjugated structure of the molecule can be altered. In this study, the plasmonic excitation properties influenced by conjugated structures in peropyrene and its derivatives are investigated through first-principles calculations that combine the plasmonicity index, generalized plasmonicity index and transition contribution maps. For molecular plasmonic excitation, the conjugated structure can influence the oscillation modes of valence electrons, which is pivotal in yielding distinct field enhancement characteristics. Furthermore, charge doping can lead to a certain degree of alteration in the conjugated structures, and the doping of elements will result in varying degrees of such alteration, thereby initiating different trends in the evolution of plasmonic resonance. This further enhances the tunability of molecular plasmonic resonance. The results provide novel insights into the development and utilization of molecular plasmonic devices in practical applications.

Title: Room-temperature quantum emission from $\mathrm{Cu_{Zn}}$-$\mathrm{V_{S}}$ defects in ZnS:Cu colloidal nanocrystals
Authors: Yossef E. Panfil, Sarah M. Thompson, Gary Chen, Jonah Ng, Cherie R. Kagan, Lee C. Bassett
Abstract: We report room-temperature observations of $\mathrm{Cu_{Zn}}$-$\mathrm{V_{S}}$ quantum emitters in individual ZnS:Cu nanocrystals (NCs). Using time-gated imaging, we isolate the distinct, $\sim$3-$\mu$s-long, red photoluminescence (PL) emission of $\mathrm{Cu_{Zn}}$-$\mathrm{V_{S}}$ defects, enabling their precise identification and statistical characterization. The emitters exhibit distinct blinking and photon antibunching, consistent with individual NCs containing two to four $\mathrm{Cu_{Zn}}$-$\mathrm{V_{S}}$ defects. The quantum emitters' PL spectra show a pronounced blue shift compared to NC dispersions, likely due to photochemical and charging effects. Emission polarization measurements of quantum emitters are consistent with a $\sigma$-character optical dipole transition and the symmetry of the $\mathrm{Cu_{Zn}}$-$\mathrm{V_{S}}$ defect. These observations motivate further investigation of $\mathrm{Cu_{Zn}}$-$\mathrm{V_{S}}$ defects in ZnS NCs for use in quantum technologies.

Title: Repulsive thermal van der Waals interaction in multi-species asymmetric electrolytes driven by external electric fields
Authors: Guangle Du, David S. Dean, Bing Miao, Rudolf Podgornik
Abstract: It is well established that the long-range component of the thermal van der Waals interaction between two semi-infinite dielectrics becomes short-range when an electrolyte is present between them, this is the well known phenomenon of screening. In Phys. Rev. Lett, 133, 238002 (2024) it was shown that for a binary symmetric electrolyte, an electric field parallel to the dielectric boundaries disrupts screening and a long-range thermal repulsive interaction appears. At large applied fields this long-range repulsive interaction can be explained by the fact that the cations and anions have differing average drifts moving in opposite directions, leading to the correlation of charge density fluctuations between the two species to decouple. Here we extend these results to binary electrolytes which are asymmetric as well as electrolytes with more than two ionic species.

Title: The critical role of entropy in glass transition kinetics
Authors: Lijian Song, Meng Gao, Juntao Huo, Li-Min Wang, Yuanzheng Yue, Jun-Qiang Wang
Abstract: Glass transition is a reversible transition that occurs in most amorphous materials. However, the nature of glass transition remains far from being clarified. A key to understand the glass transition is to clarify what determines the glass transition temperature (Tg) and liquid fragility (m). Here the glass transition thermodynamics for 150 different glass-forming systems are studied statistically. It is found that the activation characters in the energy landscape are crucial to precisely portray the glass transition and, in particular, both the activation free energy (G*) and the activation entropy (S*) play critical roles. G* determines Tg, Tg=G*/290+25.5, while S* determines m, m=S*/Rln10+15 with R is gas constant. Based on the Boltzmann definition of entropy, the fragility is an indication of the number of the degeneracy of the evolution paths. This explains why the nano-confined, low-dimension or high-pressured glasses exhibit stronger characteristics, which has been a puzzling phenomenon for a long time.

Title: Development of an uncertainty-aware equation of state for gold
Authors: Lin H. Yang, James A. Gaffney
Abstract: This study introduces a framework that employs Gaussian Processes (GPs) to develop high-fidelity equation of state (EOS) tables, essential for modeling material properties across varying temperatures and pressures. GPs offer a robust predictive modeling approach and are especially adept at handling uncertainties systematically. By integrating Error-in-Variables (EIV) into the GP model, we adeptly navigate uncertainties in both input parameters (like temperature and density) and output variables (including pressure and other thermodynamic properties). Our methodology is demonstrated using first-principles density functional theory (DFT) data for gold, observing its properties over maximum density compression (up to 100 g/cc) and extreme temperatures within the warm dense matter region (reaching 300 eV). Furthermore, we assess the resilience of our uncertainty propagation within the resultant EOS tables under various conditions, including data scarcity and the intrinsic noise of experiments and simulations.

Title: 3D structure and stability prediction of DNA with multi-way junctions in ionic solutions
Authors: Xunxun Wang, Ya-Zhou Shi
Abstract: Understanding the three-dimensional (3D) structure and stability of DNA is fundamental for its biological function and the design of novel drugs. In this study, we introduce an improved coarse-grained (CG) model, incorporating a more refined electrostatic energy term, the replica-exchange Monte Carlo algorithm, and the weighted histogram analysis method. The enhanced model predicts the 3D structures and stability of DNA with multi-way junctions (three-way and four-way) in various ionic environments, going beyond traditional single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). Our model demonstrates remarkable accuracy in predicting the structures of DNAs with multi-way junctions from sequences and offers reliable estimates of their thermal stability across a range of sequences and lengths, with both monovalent and divalent salts. Notably, our analysis of the thermally unfolding pathways reveals that the stability of DNA with multi-way junctions is strongly influenced by the relative stabilities of their unfolded intermediate states, providing key insights into DNA structure-function relationships.

Title: Hybridization induced quantum phase transition in bilayer Hubbard model
Authors: Xun Liu, Mi Jiang
Abstract: Inspired by the recent experimental report on the pressure induced superconductor-insulator transition in cuprate superconductors as well as the superconductivity of the Ruddlesden-Popper-phase La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under high pressure, we systematically investigated the single-orbital bilayer Hubbard model in the regime of large interlayer hybridization to mimic the pressure effects. We map out the phase diagram of interlayer hybridization versus density in the regime of intermediate to strong hybridization. In particular, we found that the sufficiently strong hybridization can destroy the $s^{\pm}$-wave pairing and induces its transition to correlated metallic, pseudogap, and Fermi liquid phases depending on the doping regime. The phase diagram hosted by the bilayer model implies its role as the versatile platform to explore the pressure effects on the two-dimensional to three-dimensional crossover physics of Hubbard-type models.

Title: Evidence of pseudogap and absence of spin magnetism in the time-reversal-symmetry-breaking state of Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$
Authors: Florian Bärtl, Nadia Stegani, Federico Caglieris, Ilya Shipulin, Yongwei Li, Quanxin Hu, Yu Zheng, Chi-Ming Yim, Sven Luther, Jochen Wosnitza, Rajib Sarkar, Hans-Henning Klauss, Julien Garaud, Egor Babaev, Hannes Kühne, Vadim Grinenko
Abstract: Muon-spin-rotation ($\mu$SR) experiments and the observation of a spontaneous Nernst effect indicate time-reversal symmetry breaking (BTRS) at $T_{\rm c}^{\rm Z2}$ above the superconducting transition temperature $T_{\rm c}$ in Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$, with $x\approx0.8$. Further studies have pointed out that BTRS is caused by the formation of a new state of matter associated with the condensation of pairs of electron pairs. Despite exhibiting multiple unconventional effects that warrant further investigation, the electronic spectral properties of this electron quadrupling state remain largely unexplored. Here, we present detailed $^{75}$As nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements of Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$, with $x = 0.77$, which has $T_{\rm c}^{\rm Z2}$ > $T_{\rm c}$ according to measurements of the spontaneous Nernst effect. The NMR data obtained in this work provide the first direct electronic spectral characteristics of the electron quadrupling state by indicating that it evolves from a pseudogap that sets in at $T^*$ well above $T_{\rm c}^{\rm Z2}$. This pseudogap behavior is consistent with $\mu$SR Knight-shift, specific-heat, and transport data indicating the formation of a bound state of electrons. According to a theory of electron quadrupling condensates, such bound-state formations should precede the onset of BTRS correlations between pairs of electron pairs. The second important insight from NMR data is the absence of spin-related magnetism. The temperature dependence of the spin-lattice relaxation rate $1/T_1T$ and the evolution of the NMR linewidth prove the absence of a magnetic transition at $T_{\rm c}^{\rm Z2}$ and rule out even a proximity to some magnetic instability. This indicates that the spontaneous magnetic fields detected in this compound are not caused by spin magnetism but are associated with persistent real-space currents.

Title: Freezing in flat monolayers of soft spherocylinders
Authors: Jaydeep Mandal, Henricus H. Wensink, Prabal K. Maiti
Abstract: Lamellar or smectic phases often have an intricate intralamellar structure that remains scarcely understood from a microscopic viewpoint. In this work, we use molecular dynamics simulations to study the effect of volume exclusion and electrostatic repulsion on the phase transitions of a flat membrane of soft spherocylinders. With increasing rod packing, we identify nematic and solid phases and find that the nematic-crystal phase transition happens at a uniform packing fraction ($\eta_c \approx 0.82$), independent of the spherocylinder aspect ratio. This value is considerably higher than the well-known critical freezing transition of a hard disk fluid ($\eta_c \approx 0.7$) to which one could naively map a system of near-parallel rods with co-planar mass centers. We attribute this difference to a non-vanishing residual orientational entropy per rod. Our findings are corroborated by a simple theory based on a simple microscopic density functional theory of freezing of a two-dimensional rod fluid. Introduction of electrostatic interactions between the rods reduces the lateral compressibility of the monolayer fluid but keeps the positional order unhindered, which in turn maintains the packing fraction at the nematic-crystal transition. The strength of the orientational fluctuations of the individual rods in our membranes exhibits a density scaling that differs from 3D bulk smectics. Our findings contribute to a qualitative understanding of liquid crystal phase stability in strong planar confinement and engage with recent experimental explorations involving nanorods on 2D substrates.

Title: Metamaterials that learn to change shape
Authors: Yao Du, Jonas Veenstra, Ryan van Mastrigt, Corentin Coulais
Abstract: Learning to change shape is a fundamental strategy of adaptation and evolution of living organisms, from bacteria and cells to tissues and animals. Human-made materials can also exhibit advanced shape morphing capabilities, but lack the ability to learn. Here, we build metamaterials that can learn complex shape-changing responses using a contrastive learning scheme. By being shown examples of the target shape changes, our metamaterials are able to learn those shape changes by progressively updating internal learning degrees of freedom -- the local stiffnesses. Unlike traditional materials that are designed once and for all, our metamaterials have the ability to forget and learn new shape changes in sequence, to learn multiple shape changes that break reciprocity, and to learn multistable shape changes, which in turn allows them to perform reflex gripping actions and locomotion. Our findings establish metamaterials as an exciting platform for physical learning, which in turn opens avenues for the use of physical learning to design adaptive materials and robots.

Title: Hybrid Gauge Approach for Accurate Real-Time TDDFT Simulations with Numerical Atomic Orbitals
Authors: Haotian Zhao, Lixin He
Abstract: Ultrafast real-time dynamics are critical for understanding a broad range of physical processes. Real-time time-dependent density functional theory (rt-TDDFT) has emerged as a powerful computational tool for simulating these dynamics, offering insight into untrafast processes and light-matter interactions. In periodic systems, the velocity gauge is essential because it preserves the system's periodicity under an external electric field. Numerical atomic orbitals (NAOs) are widely employed in rt-TDDFT codes due to their efficiency and localized nature. However, directly applying the velocity gauge within the NAO basis set neglects the position-dependent phase variations within atomic orbitals induced by the vector potential, leading to significant computational errors-particularly in current calculations. To resolve this issue, we develop a hybrid gauge that incorporates both the electric field and the vector potential, preserving the essential phase information in atomic orbitals and thereby eliminating these errors. Our benchmark results demonstrate that the hybrid gauge fully resolves the issues encountered with the velocity gauge in NAO-based calculations, providing accurate and reliable results. This algorithm offers a robust framework for future studies on ultrafast dynamics in periodic systems using NAO bases.

Title: Exploiting the presence of chiral spin states in molecular nanomagnets
Authors: Aman Ullah, Ziqi Hu, Alejandro Gaita-Ariño
Abstract: In a three-spin-center system, antiferromagnetic exchange interactions give rise to two ground-state doublets, each state within the doublet exhibiting distinct spin-spectrum chirality. This chirality becomes significant when external perturbations are introduced. We explored, from a theoretical perspective, the presence of spin-chirality in Lanthanide complexes that feature two magnetic centers. The applied electric-potential, couples to the system electric dipole moment ($\mu$), modifying the spin-orbit interaction ($\hat{L}.\hat{S}$). This modification is formally expressed through the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), whose role is to selectively activate one spin state in the doublet pair, as confirmed by computing the scalar spin-chirality ($\chi$). To validate the presence of chiral spin states, we performed spin-dynamics simulations using the Liouville-von Neumann equation within the density matrix formalism. The initial state was prepared as a superposition $1/\sqrt{2}(\rho_{01}+\rho_{10})$, and its time evolution revealed that each state in the doublet acquires a distinct phase, indicating their residence in separate phase spaces. This also demonstrated that the fidelity of the initial prepared state remains stable over an extended period.

Title: A method based on a dual frequency resonator to estimate physical parameters of superconductors from surface impedance measurements in a magnetic field
Authors: Nicola Pompeo, Kostiantyn Torokhtii, Andrea Alimenti, Enrico Silva
Abstract: High frequency applications of superconductors in a dc magnetic field rely on the estimate of the characteristic crossover frequency $\nu_c$ between low and high losses. Customarily, high sensitivity resonant techniques, intrinsically operating at discrete frequencies, are used to estimate $\nu_c$. We exploit here a method based on a dual frequency resonator. We show that single-frequency evaluations of $\nu_c$ lead to heavy underestimations of the superconductor surface resistance. We describe a combined analytical and experimental approach that gives more accurate estimates for $\nu_c$, and additionally allows to test the underlying physical model.

Title: Ferromagnetic resonance in Y3AlFe4O12 garnets
Authors: D. Popadiuk, V. Borynskyi, A. Kravets, Y. Shlapa, S. Solopan, A. Belous, A. Tovstolytkin, V. Korenivski
Abstract: Spin dynamics in Al-substituted yttrium iron garnets is investigated using broadband ferromagnetic resonance measurements in the temperature range T=200-360 K. Using the measured data, the resonance field and linewidth as well as their temperature dependence are determined, with implications for the uniformity and overall quality of the samples prepared via different chemical fabrication routes. These key parameters governing the spin dynamics in the material are important for its applications in high-speed spintronic and magnonic devices.

Title: Basic aspects of ferroelectricity induced by noncollinear alignment of spins
Authors: I. V. Solovyev
Abstract: Basic principles of ferroelectric activity induced by the noncollinear spins are reviewed. There is a fundamental reason why the inversion symmetry can be broken by magnetic order. Such situation occurs when the magnetic order simultaneously involves ferromagnetic ($F$) and antiferromagnetic ($A$) patterns, transforming under the spatial inversion $\mathcal{I}$ and time reversal $\mathcal{T}$ as $\mathcal{I}F=F$ and $\mathcal{IT}A=A$. The incompatibility of these two conditions breaks the inversion symmetry, imposing a constraint on possible dependencies of polarization on directions of spins, which can include only antisymmetric coupling and single-ion anisotropy in the from $\vec{P} = \vec{\boldsymbol{\mathcal{P}}}_{12} [ \boldsymbol{e}_{1} \times \boldsymbol{e}_{2} ] + \boldsymbol{e}_{1} \vec{\mathbb{\Pi}} \boldsymbol{e}_{1} - \boldsymbol{e}_{2} \vec{\mathbb{\Pi}} \boldsymbol{e}_{2}$. $\vec{\boldsymbol{\mathcal{P}}}_{12}$ can be evaluated in the framework of superexchange theory, resulting in $\vec{\boldsymbol{\mathcal{P}}}_{12} \sim \vec{\boldsymbol{r}}_{12}^{\phantom{0}}$, where $\vec{\boldsymbol{r}}_{12}^{\phantom{0}}$ is the part of the position operator produced by the spin-orbit coupling. $\vec{\boldsymbol{r}}_{12}$ remains invariant under $\mathcal{I}$, explaining why noncollinear spins can induce $\vec{P}$ even in the centrosymmetric case. The properties of $\vec{\boldsymbol{r}}_{12}$ are rationalized from the viewpoint of symmetry of the Kramers states. The Katsura-Nagaosa-Balatsky rule $\vec{P} \propto \vec{\epsilon}_{21} \times [\boldsymbol{e}_{1} \times \boldsymbol{e}_{2}]$ ($\vec{\epsilon}_{21}$ being the bond direction) is justified only for relatively high symmetry. The single-ion anisotropy vanishes for the spin 1/2 or if magnetic ions are located in the inversion centers. The properties of known multiferroics are reconsidered from the viewpoint of these principles.

Title: Advanced Spectroscopic Analyses on a:C-H Materials: Revisiting the EELS Characterization and its Coupling with multi-wavelength Raman Spectroscopy
Authors: L. Lajaunie, C. Pardanaud, C. Martin, P. Puech, C. Hu, M. J. Biggs, R. Arenal
Abstract: Hydrogenated amorphous carbon thin films (a:C-H) are very promising materials for numerous applications. The growing of relevance of a:C-H is mainly due to the long-term stability of their outstanding properties. For improving their performances, a full understanding of their local chemistry is highly required. Fifteen years ago, electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS), developed in a transmission electron microscope (TEM), was the technique of choice to extract such kind of quantitative information on these materials. Other optical techniques, as Raman spectroscopy, are now clearly favored by the scientific community. However, they still lack of the spatial resolution offered by TEM-EELS. In addition, nowadays, the complexity of the physics phenomena behind EELS is better known. Here, a:C-H thin films have been isothermally annealed and the evolution of their physical and chemical parameters have been monitored at the local and macroscopic scales. In particular, chemical in-depth inhomogeneities and their origins are highlighted. Furthermore, a novel procedure to extract properly and reliably quantitative chemical information from EEL spectra is presented. Finally, the pertinence of empirical models used by the Raman community is discussed. These works demonstrate the pertinence of the combination of local and macroscopic analyses for a proper study of such complex materials.

Title: Unusual magnetic order, field induced melting and role of spin-lattice coupling in 2D Van der Waals materials: a case study of CrSiTe3
Authors: Smita Gohil, Saswata Halder, Karthik K Iyer, Shankar Ghosh, A. Thamizhavel, Kalobaran Maiti
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) Van der Waals compounds exhibit interesting electronic and magnetic properties due to complex intra-layer and inter-layer interactions, which are of immense importance in realizing exotic physics as well as advanced technology. Various experimental and theoretical studies led to significantly different ground state properties often contrasting each other. Here, we studied a novel 2D material, CrSiTe3 employing magnetic, specific heat and Raman measurements. Experimental results reveal evidence of incipient antiferromagnetism below 1 kOe concomitant to ferromagnetic order at 33 K. Antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic interactions coexists at low field in the temperature regime, 15 - 33 K. Low field data reveal an additional magnetic order below 15 K, which melts on application of external magnetic field and remain dark in the heat capacity data. Raman spectra exhibit anomalies at the magnetic transitions; an evidence of strong spin-lattice coupling. Below 15 K, Eg modes exhibit hardening while Ag modes become significantly softer suggesting weakening of the inter-layer coupling at low temperatures which might be a reason for the unusual magnetic ground state and field induced melting of the magnetic order. These results reveal evidence of exceptional ground state properties linked to spin-lattice coupling and also suggest a pathway to study complex magnetism in such technologically important materials.

Title: Multiterminal Josephson junctions with tunable topological properties
Authors: Panch Ram, Detlef Beckmann, Romain Danneau, Wolfgang Belzig
Abstract: Since the discovery of the Andreev reflection process at normal-metal/superconductor junctions and the corresponding Andreev bound states in superconductor/normal-metal/superconductor junctions, various multiterminal Josephson junctions have been studied to explore many exotic phases of quantum matter, where the formation of Andreev bound states in the normal region account for dissipationless supercurrent and play a central role in determining exotic properties. Recently, an intriguing aspect of the multiterminal Josephson junctions has been proposed to study the topological properties, wherein the Andreev bound states acquire topological characteristics upon tuning the phase differences of superconducting terminals. In this work, we investigate topologically non-trivial phases in four-terminal Josephson junctions based on square and graphene lattices. Additionally, we apply a gating potential that smoothly drives the Andreev bound states from a topologically non-trivial state to a trivial state. Furthermore, we observe that the gating potential in our setup produces the similar physics of the topological Andreev bound states of the double (single) quantum-dot multiterminal Josephson junctions when the gating potential is small (large) compared to the superconducting gap.

Title: Low-Cost 3D printed, Biocompatible Ionic Polymer Membranes for Soft Actuators
Authors: Nils Trümpler, Ryo Kanno, Niu David, Anja Huch, Pham Huy Nguyen, Maksims Jurinovs, Gustav Nyström, Sergejs Gaidukovs, Mirko Kovac
Abstract: Ionic polymer actuators, in essence, consist of ion exchange polymers sandwiched between layers of electrodes. They have recently gained recognition as promising candidates for soft actuators due to their lightweight nature, noise-free operation, and low-driving voltages. However, the materials traditionally utilized to develop them are often not human/environmentally friendly. Thus, to address this issue, researchers have been focusing on developing biocompatible versions of this actuator. Despite this, such actuators still face challenges in achieving high performance, in payload capacity, bending capabilities, and response time. In this paper, we present a biocompatible ionic polymer actuator whose membrane is fully 3D printed utilizing a direct ink writing method. The structure of the printed membranes consists of biodegradable ionic fluid encapsulated within layers of activated carbon polymers. From the microscopic observations of its structure, we confirmed that the ionic polymer is well encapsulated. The actuators can achieve a bending performance of up to 124$^\circ$ (curvature of 0.82 $\text{cm}^{-1}$), which, to our knowledge, is the highest curvature attained by any bending ionic polymer actuator to date. It can operate comfortably up to a 2 Hz driving frequency and can achieve blocked forces of up to 0.76 mN. Our results showcase a promising, high-performing biocompatible ionic polymer actuator, whose membrane can be easily manufactured in a single step using a standard FDM 3D printer. This approach paves the way for creating customized designs for functional soft robotic applications, including human-interactive devices, in the near future.

Title: Nanoscale functionalization of MoS$_2$ monolayers with DNA origami
Authors: Shen Zhao, Zhijie Li, Zsófia Meggyesi, Elisabeth Erber, Christoph Sikeler, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Anvar S. Baimuratov, Tim Liedl, Alexander Högele, Irina V. Martynenko
Abstract: The functionalization of two-dimensional (2D) materials with organic molecules is a promising approach for realizing nanoscale optoelectronic devices with tailored functionalities, such as quantum light generation and p-n junctions. However, achieving control over the molecules' precise positioning on the 2D material remains a significant challenge. Here, we overcome the limitations of solution- and vapor deposition methods and use a DNA origami placement technique to spatially arrange various organic molecules on a chip surface at the single-molecule level with high assembly yields. This versatile method allows for precise patterning of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) with organic molecules, including thiols and fluorescent dyes. We successfully integrated MoS$_2$ monolayers with micron-scale molecule-origami patterns achieving both single photon emission from thiol-induced localized excitons in MoS$_2$ and photoexcitation energy transfer with patterned fluorescent dyes. Our approach offers a pathway for producing complex, tailored 2D inorganic-organic heterostructures with molecular-level control, opening up new possibilities for advanced materials and device design.

Title: On the pseudo-doublet ground state of the non-Kramers compound SrTm2O4 and its frustrated antiferromagnetic interactions
Authors: D. L. Quintero Castro, A. Bhat Kademane, M. Pregelj, R. Toft-Petersen, D. G. Mazzone, G. S. Tucker, C. Salazar Mejia, J. Gronemann, H.-F. Li
Abstract: Here we present experimental evidence of the pseudo-doublet ground state of the non-Kramers compound SrTm2O4, based on specific heat, magnetic entropy and electron paramagnetic resonance. We demonstrate that the two crystallographic Tm3+ sites give rise to distinct single-ion anisotropies, and by extension, SrTm2O4 hosts two magnetic sublattices. Inelastic neutron scattering reveals low-lying dispersing crystal-field excitations, which we modelled using an effective charge model and mean field random phase approximation. The extracted magnetic exchange interactions are both antiferromagnetic and frustrated for both chains. Interchain magnetic exchange interactions are negligible. The strength of the magnetic exchange interactions in relation to the size of crystal field gaps, together with the frustration and low dimensionality, force the system to remain paramagnetic down to the lowest experimentally reachable temperature despite the pseudo-doublet nature of its ground state.

Title: Generalized Bond Polarizability model for more accurate atomistic modeling of Raman spectra
Authors: Atanu Paul, Nagaprasad Reddy Samala, Ilya Grinberg
Abstract: Raman spectroscopy is an important tool for studies of molecules, liquids and solids. While Raman spectra can be obtained theoretically from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, this requires the calculation of the electronic polarizability along the simulation trajectory. First-principles calculations of electronic polarizability are computationally expensive, motivating the development of atomistic models for the evaluation of the changes in the electronic polarizability with the changes in the atomic coordinates of the system. The bond polarizability model (BPM) is one of the oldest and simplest such atomistic models, but cannot reproduce the effects of angular vibrations, leading to inaccurate modeling of Raman spectra. Here, we demonstrate that the generalization of BPM through inclusion of terms for atom pairs that are traditionally considered to be not involved in bonding dramatically improves the accuracy of polarizability modeling and Raman spectra calculations. The generalized BPM (GBPM) reproduces the ab initio polarizability and Raman spectra for a range of tested molecules (SO2, H2S, H2O, NH3, CH4, CH3OH and CH3CH2OH) with high accuracy and also shows significantly improved agreement with ab initio results for the more complex ferroelectric BaTiO3 systems. For liquid water, the anisotropic Raman spectrum derived from atomistic MD simulations using GBPM evaluation of polarizability shows significantly improved agreement with the experimental spectrum compared to the spectrum derived using BPM. Thus, GBPM can be used for the modeling of Raman spectra using large-scale molecular dynamics and provides a good basis for the further development of atomistic polarizability models.

Title: Exploring the Limits of Superconductivity in Metal-Stuffed B-C Clathrates via Ionic Lattice Anharmonicity
Authors: Wenbo Zhao, Ying Sun, Jiaxiang Li, Peng Yuan, Toshiaki Iitaka, Xin Zhong, Hefei Li, Yue-Wen Fang, Hanyu Liu, Ion Errea, Yu Xie
Abstract: Metal-stuffed B-C compounds with sodalite clathrate structure have captured increasing attention due to their predicted exceptional superconductivity above liquid nitrogen temperature at ambient pressure. However, by neglecting the quantum lattice anharmonicity, the existing studies may result in an incomplete understanding of such a lightweight system. Here, using state-of-the-art *ab initio* methods incorporating quantum effects and machine learning potentials, we revisit the properties of a series of $XY\text{B}_{6}\text{C}_{6}$ clathrates where $X$ and $Y$ are metals. Our findings show that ionic quantum and anharmonic effects can harden the $E_g$ and $E_u$ vibrational modes, enabling the dynamical stability of 15 materials previously considered unstable in the harmonic approximation, including materials with previously unreported $(XY)^{1+}$ state, which is demonstrated here to be crucial to reach high critical temperatures. Further calculations based on the isotropic Migdal-Eliashberg equation demonstrate that the $T_c$ values for $\text{KRbB}_{6}\text{C}_{6}$ and $\text{RbB}_{3}\text{C}_{3}$ among these stabilized compounds are 87 and 98 K at 0 and 15 GPa, respectively, both being higher than $T_c$ of 77 K of $\text{KPbB}_{6}\text{C}_{6}$ at the anharmonic level. These record-high $T_c$ values, surpassing liquid nitrogen temperatures, emphasize the importance of anharmonic effects in stabilizing B-C clathrates with large electron-phonon coupling strength and advancing the search for high-$T_c$ superconductivity at (near) ambient pressure.

Title: Unveiling the thermal transport mechanism in compressed plastic crystals assisted by deep potential
Authors: Yangjun Qin, Zhicheng Zong, Junwei Che, Tianhao Li, Haisheng Fang, Nuo Yang
Abstract: The unique properties of plastic crystals highlight their potential for use in solid-state refrigeration. However, their practical applications are limited by thermal hysteresis due to low thermal conductivity. In this study, the effect of compressive strain on the thermal transport properties of plastic crystal [(CH3)4N][FeCl4] was investigated using molecular dynamic simulation with a deep neural network potential. It is found that a 9% strain along [001] direction enhances thermal conductivity sixfold. The underlying mechanisms are analyzed through vibrational density of states, spectral energy densities, and mean square displacements. The enhancement in thermal conductivity is primarily due to increased group velocity and reduced phonon scattering, driven by volume compression within the 0-1 THz. These findings offer theoretical insights for the practical application of plastic crystals in thermal management systems.

Title: Momentum-dependent electron-phonon coupling in cuprates by RIXS: the roles of phonon symmetry and electronic structure
Authors: Maryia Zinouyeva, Rolf Heid, Giacomo Merzoni, Riccardo Arpaia, Nikolai Andreev, Marco Biagi, Nicholas B. Brookes, Daniele Di Castro, Alexei Kalaboukhov, Kurt Kummer, Floriana Lombardi, Leonardo Martinelli, Francesco Rosa, Flora Yakhou-Harris, Lucio Braicovich, Marco Moretti Sala, Paolo G. Radaelli, Giacomo Ghiringhelli
Abstract: The experimental determination of the magnitude and momentum dependence of electron-phonon coupling (EPC) is an outstanding problem in condensed matter physics. Resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) has been previously employed to determine the EPC, since the intensity of phonon peaks in RIXS spectra has been directly related to the underlying EPC strength. In order to assess the limits of validity of such a relation, we compare experimental results and theoretical predictions for several high-T$_c$ superconducting cuprates. Namely, we investigate the intensity of the bond-stretching phonon mode in CaCuO$_2$, La$_2$CuO$_{4+\delta}$, La$_{1.84}$Sr$_{0.16}$CuO$_4$ and YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ along the high symmetry ($\zeta$,0), ($\zeta$,$\zeta$) directions and as a function of the azimuthal angle $\phi$ at fixed modulus of the in-plane momentum $\mathbf{q_\parallel}$. Using two different theoretical approaches for the description of the RIXS scattering from phonons, we find that the $\mathbf{q_\parallel}$-dependence of the RIXS intensity can be largely ascribed to the symmetry of the phonon mode, and that satisfactory prediction of the experimental results cannot be obtained without including realistic details of the electronic structure in the calculations. Regardless of the theoretical model, RIXS provides a reliable momentum dependence of EPC in cuprates and can be used to test advanced theoretical predictions.

Title: A glance to Luttinger liquid and its platforms
Authors: Isabelle Bouchoule, Roberta Citro, Tim Duty, Thierry Giamarchi, Randall G. Hulet, Martin Klanjsek, Edmond Orignac, Bent Weber
Abstract: The concept of a Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) has been established as a fundamental theory for the understanding of one-dimensional quantum systems. Originally formulated as a replacement for Landau's Fermi-liquid theory, which accurately predicts the behaviour of most 3D metals but fails dramatically in 1D, the TLL description applies to a even broader class of 1D systems,including bosons and anyons. After a certain number of theoretical breakthroughs, its descriptive power has now been confirmed experimentally in different experimental platforms. They extend from organic conductors, carbon nanotubes, quantum wires, topological edge states of quantum spin Hall insulators to cold atoms, Josephson junctions, Bose liquids confined within 1D nanocapillaries and spin chains. In the ground state of such systems, quantum fluctuations become correlated on all length scales, but, counter-intuitively, no long-range order exists. In this respect, this review will illustrate the validity of conformal field theory for describing real-world systems, establishing the boundaries for its application and, on the other side will discuss the spectacular demonstration of how the quantum-critical TLL state governs the properties of many-body systems in one dimension.

Title: Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction chirality reversal with ferromagnetic thickness
Authors: Capucine Gueneau, Fatima Ibrahim, Johanna Fischer, Libor Vojáček, Charles-Élie Fillion, Stefania Pizzini, Laurent Ranno, Isabelle Joumard, Stéphane Auffret, Jérôme Faure-Vincent, Claire Baraduc, Mairbek Chshiev, Hélène Béa
Abstract: In ultrathin ferromagnetic films sandwiched between two distinct heavy metal layers or between a heavy metal and an oxide layer, the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) is recognized as being of interfacial origin. Its chirality and strength are determined by the properties of the adjacent heavy metals and the degree of oxidation at the interfaces. Here, we demonstrate that the chirality of the DMI can change solely with variations in the thickness of the ferromagnetic layer - an effect that has not been experimentally observed or explained until now. Our experimental observation in the trilayer system Ta/FeCoB/TaOx is supported by ab initio calculations: they reveal that variations in orbital filling and inter-atomic distances at the interface, driven by the number of ferromagnetic atomic layers, lead to an inversion of DMI chirality. This mechanism takes place for ferromagnetic layers with more than three atomic layers, for which the two interfaces start to be decoupled. We hence propose a new degree of freedom to tune DMI chirality and the associated chiral spin textures by tailoring crystal structure e.g. using strain or surface acoustic waves.

Title: Quantum trajectories and Page-curve entanglement dynamics
Authors: Katha Ganguly, Preethi Gopalakrishnan, Atharva Naik, Bijay Kumar Agarwalla, Manas Kulkarni
Abstract: We consider time dynamics of entanglement entropy between a filled fermionic system and an empty reservoir. We consider scenarios (i) where the system is subjected to a dephasing mechanism and the reservoir is clean, thereby emulating expansion of effectively interacting fermions in vacuum, and (ii) where both the system and the reservoir are subjected to dephasing and thereby enabling us to address how the entanglement between the part of the effectively interacting system and its complement evolves in time. We consider two different kinds of quantum trajectory approaches, namely stochastic unitary unraveling and quantum state diffusion. For both protocols, we observe and characterize the full Page curve-like dynamics for the entanglement entropy. Depending on the protocol and the setup, we observe very distinct characteristics of the Page curve and the associated Page time and Page value. We also compute the number of fermions leaking to the reservoir and the associated current and shed light on their plausible connections with entanglement entropy. Our findings are expected to hold for a wide variety of generic interacting quantum systems.

Title: Floquet engineering of point-gapped topological superconductors
Authors: Xiang Ji, Hao Geng, Naeem Akhtar, Xiaosen Yang
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems exhibit two distinct topological classifications based on their gap structure: line-gap and point-gap topologies. Although point-gap topology is intrinsic to non-Hermitian systems, its systematic construction remains a challenge. Here, we present the Floquet engineering approach for realizing point-gapped topological superconductors. By combining Floquet theory with particle-hole symmetry (PHS), we show that a point gap hosting robust Majorana edge modes emerges at the overlap of Floquet bands with opposite winding numbers. In the thermodynamic limit, even weak non-Hermiticity opens a point gap from a gapless spectrum, driving a topological phase transition and breaking non-Bloch parity-time ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetry. This transition is accompanied by the appearance of the Floquet $Z_2$ skin effect. Furthermore, the point-gapped topological phase and the non-Bloch $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry exhibit size-dependent phenomena driven by the critical skin effect. Our work offers a new pathway for exploring the point-gapped topological phases in non-Hermitian systems.

Title: Orientation dependent transport in junctions formed by $d$-wave altermagnets and $d$-wave superconductors
Authors: Wenjun Zhao, Yuri Fukaya, Pablo Burset, Jorge Cayao, Yukio Tanaka, Bo Lu
Abstract: We investigate de Gennes and Saint-James states and Josephson effect in hybrid junctions based on $d$-wave altermagnet and $d$-wave superconductor. In a normal metal/altermagnet/$d$-wave superconductor junction, we find that the $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-altermagnet can generate de Gennes and Saint-James states in a short junction due to the enhanced mismatch between electron and hole wave vectors, resulting in the vanishing zero-biased conductance peak with pronounced resonance spikes in the subgap conductance spectra. By contrast, the de Gennes and Saint-James states are not found for $d_{xy}$-altermagnet in the short junction but can be formed in the long junction. Moreover, the well-known features such as V-shape conductance for $d_{x^2-y^2}$ pairings and zero-biased conductance peak for $d_{xy}$ pairings are not affected by the strength of $d_{xy}$-altermagnetism in the short junction. We also study the Josephson current-phase relation $I\left( \varphi \right) $ of $d$-wave superconductor/altermagnet/$d$-wave superconductor hybrids, where $\varphi $ is the macroscopic phase difference between two $d$-wave superconductors. In symmetric junctions, we obtain anomalous current phase relation such as a $0$-$\pi$ transition by changing either the orientation or the magnitude of the altermagnetic order parameter and dominant higher Josephson harmonics. Interestingly, we find the first-order Josephson coupling in an asymmetric $ d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-superconductor/altermagnet/$d_{xy}$-superconductor junction when the symmetry of altermagnetic order parameter is neither $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$- nor $ d_{xy}$-wave. We present the symmetry analysis and conclude that the anomalous orientation-dependent current-phase relations are ascribed to the peculiar feature of the altermagnetic spin-splitting field.

Title: Exact solution to the hydrodynamic equation of quantum lattice gases with dephasing noise via classical run-and-tumble processes
Authors: Michele Coppola
Abstract: The average state dynamics of free fermions subject to random projective measurements of local site occupation numbers is governed by a Lindblad equation with dephasing noise. In the continuous limit, the equation of motion for the correlation matrix is mapped to a hydrodynamic equation for the Wigner function, which takes the form of a linear, nonlocal partial differential equation. As a main result, we derive the analytical solution to the hydrodynamic equation using the quasiparticle picture, showing that the Wigner dynamics emerges from stochastic sampling of classical run-and-tumble processes. As an application, we recover the crossover between ballistic and diffusive transport regimes.

Title: Coherent spin dynamics of electrons and holes photogenerated with large kinetic energy in lead halide perovskite crystals
Authors: Evgeny A. Zhukov, Dmitri R. Yakovlev, Erik Kirstein, Nataliia E. Kopteva, Oleh Hordiichuk, Maksym V. Kovalenko, Manfred Bayer
Abstract: The coherent spin dynamics of electrons and holes are studied in a FA0.9Cs0.1PbI2.8Br0.2 perovskite bulk crystal, using time-resolved Kerr ellipticity in a two-color pump-probe scheme. The probe photon energy is tuned to the exciton resonance, while the pump photon energy is detuned from it up to 0.75 eV to higher energies. The spin-oriented electrons and holes photogenerated with significant excess kinetic energy relax into states in vicinity of the band gap, where they undergo Larmor precession in an external magnetic field. At cryogenic temperatures down to 1.6 K, the spin dephasing time reaches the nanosecond range. During energy relaxation, the carrier spin relaxation is inefficient and only happens when the carriers become localized. In experiments with two pump pulses, all-optical control of the amplitudes and phases of the electron and hole spin signals is achieved in the additive regime by varying the intensities of the pump pulses and the time delay between them.

Title: Non-Hermitian wave-packet dynamics and its realization within a non-Hermitian chiral cavity
Authors: Weicen Dong, Qing-Dong Jiang, Matteo Baggioli
Abstract: Topological wave-packet dynamics provide a powerful framework for studying quantum transport in topological materials. However, extending this approach to non-Hermitian quantum systems presents several important challenges, primarily due to ambiguities in defining the Berry phase and the non-unitary evolution of the wave-packets when $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$ symmetry is broken. In this work, we adopt the complex Berry phase definition using the bi-orthogonal formalism and derive the semiclassical equations of motion (EOM) for a wave-packet in a non-Hermitian topological system. Interestingly, we find that the complex Berry curvature introduces both an anomalous velocity and an anomalous force into the semiclassical EOM. To validate the derived EOM, we design a non-Hermitian Haldane model featuring non-reciprocal next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) hopping, where the imbalance in the NNN hopping amplitudes gives rise to an emergent `complex chirality'. We reveal that the real and imaginary components of the complex chirality dictate the signs of both the real and imaginary parts of the complex Berry curvature, as well as the direction and dissipation rate of the edge states. Our analytical findings are confirmed by direct numerical simulations of the wave-packet dynamics. Finally, we suggest a potential experimental realization of this complex Haldane model using a non-Hermitian optical chiral cavity, providing a promising platform for testing our theoretical predictions.

Title: Mesoscopic Collective Dynamics in Liquids and the Dual Model
Authors: Fabio Peluso
Abstract: A microscopic vision is presented of a Dual Model of Liquids from a solid picture. Among the novelties of this model is that it provides quantitative expressions of various extensive thermophysical properties. The introduction of the statistical number of excited degrees of freedom (DoF) allows bypassing the problem of other dual models which are sometimes unable to correctly reproduce the expressions for those thermophysical quantities showing deviations due to the activation or deactivation of internal DoF. The interpretation of the relaxation times is given, their Order of Magnitude calculated and the way in which these times are involved in the different phases of the collective dynamics of liquids is discussed. A comparison is provided with results obtained in the frame of another phononic model of liquids, as well as with the predictions for the viscoelastic transition regions and with systems exhibiting kgap. In the last part of the paper, theoretical insights and experiments are suggested as potential directions for future research and development.

Title: Magnetism in symmetry-enforced nodal-line semimetals
Authors: Andressa R. Medeiros-Silva, Natanael C. Costa, Mariana Malard, Rodrigo G. Pereira, Thereza Paiva
Abstract: Nodal-line semimetals (NLSMs) harbor a variety of novel physical properties owing to the particularities of the band degeneracies that characterize the spectrum of these materials. In symmetry-enforced NLSMs, band degeneracies, being imposed by symmetries, are robust to arbitrarily strong perturbations that preserve the symmetries. We investigate the effects of electron-electron interactions on a recently proposed vacancy-engineered NLSM known as holey graphene. Using mean-field calculations and quantum Monte Carlo simulation, we show that the Hubbard model on the depleted holey-graphene lattice at half-filling exhibits a transition from a NLSM to an insulating antiferromagnetic phase for an arbitrarily weak repulsive interaction $U$. In contrast to the semi-metal-insulator transition in the pristine honeycomb lattice, which occurs at a finite critical value of $U$, in the depleted lattice, the transition at $U=0$ is associated with a van Hove singularity arising from the crossing of accidental nodal lines enforced by symmetry. We also employ linear spin wave theory (LSWT) to the effective Heisenberg model in the strong-coupling limit and obtain the global antiferromagnetic order parameter $m_{\rm AFM} \approx 0.146$. The order parameters from both QMC and LSWT agree quantitatively. Our findings indicate that vacancy engineering offers an effective way to tailor the magnetic properties of quantum materials.

Title: Thermodynamics of driven systems with explicitly broken detailed balance
Authors: Markus Hofer, Jan Korbel, Rudolf Hanel, Stefan Thurner
Abstract: In systems with detailed balance, the stationary distribution and the equilibrium distribution are identical, creating a clear connection between energetic and entropic quantities. Many driven systems violate detailed balance and still pose a challenge for a consistent thermodynamic interpretation. Even steady-state potentials like entropy or free energy are no longer state variables. Here, we use a framework for systems with broken detailed balance, where Boltzmann entropy can be computed while properly taking constraints on state transitions into account. As an illustration, we establish the thermodynamic relations for arbitrarily driven sample space-reducing processes that are non-equilibrium but show steady states. We demonstrate that, despite explicitly broken detailed balance, it remains feasible to define and unambiguously interpret the effective thermodynamic potentials.

Title: Symmetry and Critical Dynamics in Supercooled Liquid Crystals: Insights into the Glass Transition
Authors: Szymon Starzonek, Aleš Iglič, Aleksandra Drozd-Rzoska, Sylwester J. Rzoska
Abstract: This study introduces a modeling approach aimed at elucidating the pivotal role of symmetry in phase transitions, focusing specifically on the isotropic-nematic (I-N) transition characteristic of liquid crystal systems. By leveraging insights from the Ising model and incorporating considerations of topological defects, the transition to the glassy state in rod-like molecular systems in the supercooled state is examined. Through a critical-like analysis of the system's dynamical properties, universality classes directly linked to symmetry are discerned. This paper delves into the role of symmetry in the glass transition, as manifested in the generalized critical relation of configurational entropy $S_C(T)=S_0(1-T_K/T)^n$, where the critical exponent $n$ is intricately tied to the system's symmetry. The determined values of the pseudocritical exponent $n$ exhibit universality across the studied systems and demonstrate excellent agreement with thermodynamic data. Furthermore, the congruence between the dynamic representation, as indicated by the primary relaxation time, and the thermodynamic representation, exemplified by the specific heat capacity, underscores the robustness of the findings. The identification of critical-like behavior and the observation of symmetry breaking during the transition to the glass state suggest its intrinsic thermodynamic nature. This work provides a unified framework for understanding the glass transition, bridging dynamic and thermodynamic perspectives through the lens of symmetry.

Title: Strong phonon-mediated high temperature superconductivity in Li$_2$AuH$_6$ under ambient pressure
Authors: Zhenfeng Ouyang, Bo-Wen Yao, Xiao-Qi Han, Peng-Jie Guo, Ze-Feng Gao, Zhong-Yi Lu
Abstract: We used our developed AI search engine~(InvDesFlow) to perform extensive investigations regarding ambient stable superconducting hydrides. A cubic structure Li$_2$AuH$_6$ with Au-H octahedral motifs is identified to be a candidate. After performing thermodynamical analysis, we provide a feasible route to experimentally synthesize this material via the known LiAu and LiH compounds under ambient pressure. The further first-principles calculations suggest that Li$_2$AuH$_6$ shows a high superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) $\sim$ 140 K under ambient pressure. The H-1$s$ electrons strongly couple with phonon modes of vibrations of Au-H octahedrons as well as vibrations of Li atoms, where the latter is not taken seriously in other previously similar cases. Hence, different from previous claims of searching metallic covalent bonds to find high-$T_c$ superconductors, we emphasize here the importance of those phonon modes with strong electron-phonon coupling (EPC). And we suggest that one can intercalate atoms into binary or ternary hydrides to introduce more potential phonon modes with strong EPC, which is an effective approach to find high-$T_c$ superconductors within multicomponent compounds.

Title: Theory of quantum-geometric charge and spin Josephson diode effects in strongly spin-polarized hybrid structures with noncoplanar spin textures
Authors: Niklas L. Schulz, Danilo Nikolić, Matthias Eschrig
Abstract: We present a systematic study of the spin-resolved Josephson diode effect (JDE) in strongly spin-polarized ferromagnets (sFM) coupled to singlet superconductors (SC) via ferromagnetic insulating interfaces (FI). All metallic parts are described in the framework of the quasiclassical Usadel Green's function theory applicable to diffusive systems. The interfaces are characterized by an S-matrix obtained for a model potential with exchange vectors pointing in an arbitrary direction with respect to the magnetization in the sFM. Our theory predicts a large charge Josephson diode effect with an efficiency exceeding $33\%$ and a perfect spin diode effect with $100\%$ efficiency. To achieve these the following conditions are necessary: (i) a noncoplanar profile of the three magnetization vectors in the system and (ii) different densities of states of spin-$\uparrow$ and spin-$\downarrow$ bands in the sFM achieved by a strong spin polarization. The former gives rise to the quantum-geometric phase, $\Delta\varphi$, that enters the theory in a very similar manner as the superconducting phase difference across the junction, $\Delta\chi$. We perform a harmonic analysis of the Josephson current in both variables and find symmetries between Fourier coefficients allowing an interpretation in terms of transfer processes of multiple equal-spin Cooper pairs across the two ferromagnetic spin bands. We point out the importance of crossed pair transmission processes. Finally, we study a spin-switching effect of an equal-spin supercurrent by reversing the magnetic flux in a SQUID device incorporating the mentioned junction and propose a way for measuring it.

Title: Dynamic Metal-Support Interaction Dictates Cu Nanoparticle Sintering on Al$_2$O$_3$ Surfaces
Authors: Jiayan Xu, Shreeja Das, Amar Deep Pathak, Abhirup Patra, Sharan Shetty, Detlef Hohl, Roberto Car
Abstract: Nanoparticle sintering remains a critical challenge in heterogeneous catalysis. In this work, we present a unified deep potential (DP) model for Cu nanoparticles on three Al$_2$O$_3$ surfaces ($\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$(100), $\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$(110), and $\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$(0001)). Using DP-accelerated simulations, we reveal striking facet-dependent nanoparticle stability and mobility patterns across the three surfaces. The nanoparticles diffuse several times faster on $\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$(0001) than on $\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$(100) at 800 K while expected to be more sluggish based on their larger binding energy at 0 K. Diffusion is facilitated by dynamic metal-support interaction (MSI), where the Al atoms switch out of the surface plane to optimize contact with the nanoparticle and relax back to the plane as the nanoparticle moves away. In contrast, the MSI on $\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$(100) and on $\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$(110) is dominated by more stable and directional Cu-O bonds, consistent with the limited diffusion observed on these surfaces. Our extended long-time MD simulations provide quantitative insights into the sintering processes, showing that the dispersity of nanoparticles (the initial inter-nanoparticle distance) strongly influences coalescence driven by nanoparticle diffusion. We observed that the coalescence of Cu$_{13}$ nanoparticles on $\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$(0001) can occur in a short time (10 ns) at 800 K even with an initial inter-nanoparticle distance increased to 30 Å, while the coalescence on $\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$(100) is inhibited significantly by increasing the initial inter-nanoparticle distance from 15 Å to 30 Å. These findings demonstrate that the dynamics of the supporting surface is crucial to understanding the sintering mechanism and offer guidance for designing sinter-resistant catalysts by engineering the support morphology.

Title: Reply to comment on "Controlled bond expansion for Density Matrix Renormalization Group ground state search at single-site costs"
Authors: Andreas Gleis, Jheng-Wei Li, Jan von Delft
Abstract: We reply to McCulloch and Osborne's recent comment on our manuscript (Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 246402 (2023)) on controlled bond expansion (CBE) for density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) ground state search. We appreciate their suggestion to consider randomized SVD and address their constructive critique on the variational properties of CBE-DMRG. However, we strongly disagree with their proposal to omit the projection to the 2-site tangent space and explain its importance for efficient bond expansion. In particular, in the context of CBE applied to the time-dependent variational principle (TDVP), we show that omitting this projection can lead to avoidable errors. Lastly, we emphasize the complementary roles of 3S mixing and CBE, reiterating our recommendation from Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 246402 (2023) to combine both methods (CBE+$\alpha$). We provide examples to demonstrate the superior efficiency and robustness of CBE+$\alpha$.

Title: Charge-density-wave quantum critical point under pressure in 2$H$-TaSe$_2$

Abstract: Suppressing of an ordered state that competes with superconductivity is one route to enhance superconducting transition temperatures. Whereas the effect of suppressing magnetic states is still not fully understood, materials featuring charge-density waves and superconductivity offer a clearer scenario as both states can be associated with electron-phonon coupling. Metallic transition-metal dichalcogenides are prime examples for such intertwined electron-phonon-driven phases, yet, various compounds do not show the expected interrelation or feature additional mechanisms which makes an unambiguous interpretation difficult. Here, we report high-pressure X-ray diffraction and inelastic X-ray scattering measurements of the prototypical transition-metal dichalcogenide 2$H$-TaSe$_2$ and determine the evolution of the charge-density-wave state and its lattice dynamics up to and beyond its suppression at the critical pressure $p_c = 19.9(1)\,\rm{GPa}$ and at low temperatures. The high quality of our data allows the full refinement of the commensurate charge-density-wave superstructure at low pressure and we find the quantum critical point of the charge-density-wave to be in close vicinity to the reported maximum superconducting transition temperature $T_{sc} = 8.2\,\rm{K}$. $Ab-initio$ calculations corroborate that 2$H$-TaSe$_2$ is a reference example of order-suppressed enhanced superconductivity and can serve as a textbook case to investigate superconductivity near a charge-density-wave quantum critical point.

Title: The Rouse ring chain with attractive harmonic potential of spherical symmetry
Authors: Nail Fatkullin, Carlos Mattea, Kevin Lindt, Siegfried Stapf, Margarita Kruteva
Abstract: We study the static and dynamic properties of a cyclic Rouse chain modified by the inclusion of an effective, spherically symmetric, attracting potential of entropic nature , is the position vector of ring center of mass, is the position vector of the segment with number n, is the Boltzmann constant multiplied on absolute temperature, is a parameter of the potential, square of which is inverse to strength of the potential. It is shown that very weak potentials with , N is the number Kuhn segments in polymer ring, b is the length of Kuhn segment, lead to dramatic compression of the polymer chain whose radius of inertia becomes much smaller compared to the free size At values of the potential parameter of order , is the concentration of Kuhn segments in the melt, the concentration of the intrinsic segments of the polymer ring becomes of order and the state of the polymer ring can be regarded as globular. The terminal relaxation time of the polymer ring turns out to be of the order of , the mean squared displacement of the center of mass of the macromolecule during this time , which can lead to a pseudo plateau for the time dependence of the mean squared displacements of the polymer segments before entering the normal diffusion mode of motion.

Title: Building unconventional magnetic phases on graphene by H atom manipulation: From altermagnets to Lieb ferrimagnets
Authors: B. Viña-Bausá, M. A. García-Blázquez, S. Chourasia, R. Carrasco, D. Expósito, I. Brihuega, J. J. Palacios
Abstract: Engineering all fundamental magnetic phases within a single material platform would mark a significant milestone in materials science and spintronics, reducing complexity and costs in device fabrication by eliminating the need for integrating and interfacing different materials. Here, we demonstrate that graphene can host all non-relativistic magnetic phases-namely, diamagnetism, paramagnetism, ferromagnetism, antiferromagnetism, ferrimagnetism, altermagnetism and fully compensated ferrimagnetism -- by using single hydrogen atoms as building blocks. Through precise manipulation of these atoms by scanning tunneling microscopy, we can experimentally create all such magnetic phases. Their different magnetic character is confirmed by density functional theory and mean-field Hubbard calculations. In particular, we show that the new magnetic paradigm known as altermagnetism can be realized, exhibiting directionally spin-split energy bands coexisting with zero net magnetization due to protecting spatial symmetries. It is furthermore possible to create fully compensated ferrimagnets, lacking these symmetries and therefore presenting unrestricted spin splitting of the bands, with a vanishing net magnetization which in this case is protected by Lieb's theorem. These findings put forward H-functionalized graphene as a versatile platform to design, build and study these new emergent magnetic phases at the atomic scale.

Title: Towards neural reinforcement learning for large deviations in nonequilibrium systems with memory
Authors: Venkata D. Pamulaparthy, Rosemary J. Harris
Abstract: We introduce a reinforcement learning method for a class of non-Markov systems; our approach extends the actor-critic framework given by Rose et al. [New J. Phys. 23 013013 (2021)] for obtaining scaled cumulant generating functions characterizing the fluctuations. The actor-critic is implemented using neural networks; a particular innovation in our method is the use of an additional neural policy for processing memory variables. We demonstrate results for current fluctuations in various memory-dependent models with special focus on semi-Markov systems where the dynamics is controlled by nonexponential interevent waiting time distributions.

Title: Direct imaging of hydrogen-driven dislocation and strain field evolution in a stainless steel grain
Authors: David Yang, Mujan Seif, Guanze He, Kay Song, Adrien Morez, Benjamin de Jager, Ross J. Harder, Wonsuk Cha, Edmund Tarleton, Ian K. Robinson, Felix Hofmann
Abstract: Hydrogen embrittlement (HE) poses a significant challenge to the durability of materials used in hydrogen production and utilization. Disentangling the competing nanoscale mechanisms driving HE often relies on simulations and electron-transparent sample techniques, limiting experimental insights into hydrogen-induced dislocation behavior in bulk materials. This study employs in situ Bragg coherent X-ray diffraction imaging to track three-dimensional dislocation and strain field evolution during hydrogen charging in a bulk grain of austenitic 316 stainless steel. Tracking a single dislocation reveals hydrogen-enhanced mobility and relaxation, consistent with dislocation dynamics simulations. Subsequent observations reveal dislocation unpinning and climb processes, likely driven by osmotic forces. Additionally, nanoscale strain analysis around the dislocation core directly measures hydrogen-induced elastic shielding. These findings experimentally validate theoretical predictions and offer mechanistic insights into hydrogen-driven dislocation behavior, paving the way for the design of HE-resistant materials.

Title: Stability of the $\pi$-Flux Phase for $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ Lattice Gauge Theory Coupled to Fermionic Matter
Authors: Leonardo Goller, Marcello Porta
Abstract: We consider the two-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ Ising gauge theory coupled to fermionic matter. In absence of electric fields, we prove that, at half-filling, the ground state of the gauge theory coincides with the $\pi$-flux phase, associated with magnetic flux equal to $\pi$ in every elementary lattice plaquette, provided the fermionic hopping is large enough. This proves in particular the semimetallic behavior of the ground state of the model. Furthermore, we compute the magnetic susceptibility of the gauge theory, and we prove that it is given by the one of massless $2d$ Dirac fermions, thus rigorously justifying recent numerical computations. The proof is based on reflection positivity and chessboard estimates, and on lattice conservation laws for the computation of the transport coefficient.

Title: Autonomous Microscopy Experiments through Large Language Model Agents
Authors: Indrajeet Mandal, Jitendra Soni, Mohd Zaki, Morten M. Smedskjaer, Katrin Wondraczek, Lothar Wondraczek, Nitya Nand Gosvami, N. M. Anoop Krishnan
Abstract: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has accelerated the development of self-driving laboratories (SDLs) for materials research. Despite their transformative potential, current SDL implementations rely on rigid, predefined protocols that limit their adaptability to dynamic experimental scenarios across different labs. A significant challenge persists in measuring how effectively AI agents can replicate the adaptive decision-making and experimental intuition of expert scientists. Here, we introduce AILA (Artificially Intelligent Lab Assistant), a framework that automates atomic force microscopy (AFM) through LLM-driven agents. Using AFM as an experimental testbed, we develop AFMBench-a comprehensive evaluation suite that challenges AI agents based on language models like GPT-4o and GPT-3.5 to perform tasks spanning the scientific workflow: from experimental design to results analysis. Our systematic assessment shows that state-of-the-art language models struggle even with basic tasks such as documentation retrieval, leading to a significant decline in performance in multi-agent coordination scenarios. Further, we observe that LLMs exhibit a tendency to not adhere to instructions or even divagate to additional tasks beyond the original request, raising serious concerns regarding safety alignment aspects of AI agents for SDLs. Finally, we demonstrate the application of AILA on increasingly complex experiments open-ended experiments: automated AFM calibration, high-resolution feature detection, and mechanical property measurement. Our findings emphasize the necessity for stringent benchmarking protocols before deploying AI agents as laboratory assistants across scientific disciplines.

Title: Using Domain Knowledge with Deep Learning to Solve Applied Inverse Problems
Authors: Qinyi Tian, Winston Lindqwister, Manolis Veveakis, Laura E. Dalton
Abstract: Advancements in deep learning have improved the ability to model complex, nonlinear relationships, such as those encountered in complex material inverse problems. However, the effectiveness of these methods often depends on large datasets, which are not always available. In this study, the incorporation of domain-specific knowledge of mechanical behavior is investigated to evaluate the impact on the predictive performance of the models in data-scarce scenarios. To demonstrate this, stress-strain curves were used to predict key microstructural features of porous materials, and the performance of models trained with and without domain knowledge was compared using five deep learning models: Convolutional Neural Networks, Extreme Gradient Boosting, K-Nearest Neighbors, Long Short-Term Memory, and Random Forest. The results of the models with domain-specific characteristics consistently achieved higher $R^2$ values and improved learning efficiency compared to models without prior knowledge. When the models did not include domain knowledge, the model results revealed meaningful patterns were not recognized, while those enhanced with mechanical insights showed superior feature extraction and predictions. These findings underscore the critical role of domain knowledge in guiding deep learning models, highlighting the need to combine domain expertise with data-driven approaches to achieve reliable and accurate outcomes in materials science and related fields.

Title: Optimal control in phase space applied to minimal-time transfer of thermal atoms in optical traps
Authors: Omar Morandi, Sara Nicoletti, Vladislav Gavryusev, Leonardo Fallani
Abstract: We present an optimal control procedure for the non-adiabatic transport of ultracold neutral thermal atoms in optical tweezers arranged in a one-dimensional array, with focus on reaching minimal transfer time. The particle dynamics are modeled first using a classical approach through the Liouville equation and second through the quantum Wigner equation to include quantum effects. Both methods account for typical experimental noise described as stochastic effects through Fokker-Planck terms. The optimal control process is initialized with a trajectory computed for a single classical particle and determines the phase-space path that minimizes transport time and ensures high transport fidelity to the target trap. This approach provides the fastest and most efficient method for relocating atoms from an initial configuration to a desired target arrangement, minimizing time and energy costs while ensuring high fidelity. Such an approach may be highly valuable to initialize large atom arrays for quantum simulation or computation experiments.

Title: Parent Lindbladians for Matrix Product Density Operators
Authors: Yuhan Liu, Alberto Ruiz-de-Alarcón, Georgios Styliaris, Xiao-Qi Sun, David Pérez-García, J. Ignacio Cirac
Abstract: Understanding quantum phases of matter is a fundamental goal in physics. For pure states, the representatives of phases are the ground states of locally interacting Hamiltonians, which are also renormalization fixed points (RFPs). These RFP states are exactly described by tensor networks. Extending this framework to mixed states, matrix product density operators (MPDOs) which are RFPs are believed to encapsulate mixed-state phases of matter in one dimension. However, it remains an open question whether, by analogy, such MPDO RFPs can be realized as steady states of local Lindbladians. In this work, we resolve this question by analytically constructing parent Lindbladians for MPDO RFPs. These Lindbladians are local, frustration-free, and exhibit minimal steady-state degeneracy. Interestingly, we find that parent Lindbladians possess a rich structure, including non-commutativity for certain classes of RFPs, distinguishing them from their Hamiltonian counterparts.

Title: Ionic Associations and Hydration in the Electrical Double Layer of Water-in-Salt Electrolytes
Authors: Daniel M. Markiewitz, Zachary A. H. Goodwin, Qianlu Zheng, Michael McEldrew, Rosa M. Espinosa-Marzal, Martin Z. Bazant
Abstract: Water-in-Salt-Electrolytes (WiSEs) are an exciting class of concentrated electrolytes finding applications in energy storage devices because of their expanded electrochemical stability window, good conductivity and cation transference number, and fire-extinguishing properties. These distinct properties are thought to originate from the presence of an anion-dominated ionic network and interpenetrating water channels for cation transport, which indicates that associations in WiSEs are crucial to understanding their properties. Currently, associations have mainly been investigated in the bulk, while little attention has been given to the electrolyte structure near electrified interfaces. Here, we develop a theory for the electrical double layer (EDL) of WiSEs, where we consistently account for the thermoreversible associations of species into Cayley tree aggregates. The theory predicts an asymmetric structure of the EDL. At negative voltages, hydrated Li$^+$ dominate and cluster aggregation is initially slightly enhanced before disintegration at larger voltages. At positive voltages when compared to the bulk, clusters are strictly diminished. Performing atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the EDL of WiSE provides EDL data for validation and bulk data for parameterization of our theory. Validating the predictions of our theory against MD showed good qualitative agreement. Furthermore, we performed electrochemical impendence measurements to determine the differential capacitance of the studied LiTFSI WiSE and also found reasonable agreement with our theory. Overall, the developed approach can be used to investigate ionic aggregation and solvation effects in the EDL, which amongst other properties, can be used to understand the pre-cursers for solid-electrolyte interphase formation.

Title: Accurate and thermodynamically consistent hydrogen equation of state for planetary modeling with flow matching
Authors: Hao Xie, Saburo Howard, Guglielmo Mazzola
Abstract: Accurate determination of the equation of state of dense hydrogen is essential for understanding gas giants. Currently, there is still no consensus on methods for calculating its entropy, which play a fundamental role and can result in qualitatively different predictions for Jupiter's interior. Here, we investigate various aspects of entropy calculation for dense hydrogen based on ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. Specifically, we employ the recently developed flow matching method to validate the accuracy of the traditional thermodynamic integration approach. We then clearly identify pitfalls in previous attempts and propose a reliable framework for constructing the hydrogen equation of state, which is accurate and thermodynamically consistent across a wide range of temperature and pressure conditions. This allows us to conclusively address the long-standing discrepancies in Jupiter's adiabat among earlier studies, demonstrating the potential of our approach for providing reliable equations of state of diverse materials.

Title: Electrical and Structural Properties of In-Situ MOCVD Grown Al$_2$O$_3$/$\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ and Al$_2$O$_3$/$\beta$-(Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$)$_2$O$_3$ MOSCAPs
Authors: A F M Anhar Uddin Bhuiyan, Lingyu Meng, Dong Su Yu, Sushovan Dhara, Hsien-Lien Huang, Vijay Gopal Thirupakuzi Vangipuram, Jinwoo Hwang, Siddharth Rajan, Hongping Zhao
Abstract: This study investigates the electrical and structural properties of MOSCAPs with in-situ MOCVD-grown Al$_2$O$_3$ dielectrics on (010) $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ and $\beta$-(Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$)$_2$O$_3$ films. The Al$_2$O$_3$/$\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ MOSCAPs showed a strong dependence on Al$_2$O$_3$ deposition temperature. At 900$^\circ$C, reduced voltage hysteresis ($\sim$0.3 V) and improved reverse breakdown voltage (74.5 V) were observed, with breakdown fields of 5.01 MV/cm in Al$_2$O$_3$ and 4.11 MV/cm in $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$. At 650$^\circ$C, higher hysteresis ($\sim$3.44 V) and lower reverse breakdown voltage (38.8 V) were observed, with breakdown fields of 3.69 MV/cm in Al$_2$O$_3$ and 2.87 MV/cm in $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$. However, forward breakdown fields improved from 5.62 MV/cm (900$^\circ$C) to 7.25 MV/cm (650$^\circ$C). STEM revealed improved crystallinity and sharper interfaces at 900$^\circ$C, enhancing reverse breakdown performance. For Al$_2$O$_3$/$\beta$-(Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$)$_2$O$_3$ MOSCAPs, increasing Al composition ($x$ = 5.5\% to 9.2\%) reduced carrier concentration and improved reverse breakdown fields from 2.55 to 2.90 MV/cm in $\beta$-(Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$)$_2$O$_3$ and 2.41 to 3.13 MV/cm in Al$_2$O$_3$. Forward breakdown fields in Al$_2$O$_3$ improved from 5.0 to 5.4 MV/cm as Al composition increased. STEM confirmed compositional homogeneity and excellent stoichiometry of Al$_2$O$_3$ and $\beta$-(Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$)$_2$O$_3$ layers. These findings highlight the robust electrical performance, high breakdown fields, and structural quality of Al$_2$O$_3$/$\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ and Al$_2$O$_3$/$\beta$-(Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$)$_2$O$_3$ MOSCAPs for high-power applications.

Title: Coevolving aerodynamic and impact ripples on Earth

Abstract: Windblown sand creates multiscale bedforms on Earth, Mars, and other planetary bodies. According to conventional wisdom, decameter-scale dunes and decimeter-scale ripples emerge via distinct mechanisms on Earth: a hydrodynamic instability related to a phase shift between the turbulent flow and the topography, and a granular instability related to a synchronization of hopping grains with the topography. Here, we report the reproducible creation of coevolving centimeter and decimeter-scale ripples on fine-grained monodisperse sand beds in ambient-air and low-pressure wind-tunnels, revealing two adjacent mesoscale growth instabilities. Their morphological traits and our quantitative grain-scale numerical simulations authenticate the smaller structures as impact ripples but point at a hydrodynamic origin for the larger ones. This suggests that the aeolian transport layer would have to partially respond to the topography on a scale comparable to the average hop length, hence faster than previously thought, but consistent with the phase lag of the inferred aeolian sand flux relative to the wind. Hydrodynamic modelling supports the existence of hydrodynamic aerodynamic ripples on Earth, connecting them mechanistically to megaripples and to the debated Martian ripples. We thereby propose a unified framework for mesoscale granular bedforms found across the Solar System.

Abstract: We present MOFA, an open-source generative AI (GenAI) plus simulation workflow for high-throughput generation of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) on large-scale high-performance computing (HPC) systems. MOFA addresses key challenges in integrating GPU-accelerated computing for GPU-intensive GenAI tasks, including distributed training and inference, alongside CPU- and GPU-optimized tasks for screening and filtering AI-generated MOFs using molecular dynamics, density functional theory, and Monte Carlo simulations. These heterogeneous tasks are unified within an online learning framework that optimizes the utilization of available CPU and GPU resources across HPC systems. Performance metrics from a 450-node (14,400 AMD Zen 3 CPUs + 1800 NVIDIA A100 GPUs) supercomputer run demonstrate that MOFA achieves high-throughput generation of novel MOF structures, with CO$_2$ adsorption capacities ranking among the top 10 in the hypothetical MOF (hMOF) dataset. Furthermore, the production of high-quality MOFs exhibits a linear relationship with the number of nodes utilized. The modular architecture of MOFA will facilitate its integration into other scientific applications that dynamically combine GenAI with large-scale simulations.

Title: Molecular laser cooling using serrodynes: Implementation, characterization and prospects
Authors: Felix Kogel, Tatsam Garg, Marian Rockenhäuser, Sebastián A. Morales-Ramírez, Tim Langen
Abstract: An important effort is currently underway to extend optical cycling and laser cooling to more molecular species. Significant challenges arise in particular when multiple nuclear spins give rise to complex, resolved hyperfine spectra, as is the case for several molecular species relevant to precision tests of fundamental symmetries. We provide a detailed introduction to the use of optical spectra generated via serrodyne waveforms to address this complexity. We discuss our experimental implementation of these serrodynes, characterize their properties, and outline procedures to find optimized sideband configurations that generate strong laser cooling forces. We demonstrate the application of these techniques to barium monofluoride molecules and explore their prospects for the cooling of other species relevant to the study of fundamental physics.

Title: Staggered Fermions with Chiral Anomaly Cancellation
Authors: Ling-Xiao Xu
Abstract: We investigate the implications of the quantized vectorial and axial charges in the lattice Hamiltonian of multi-flavor staggered fermions in $(1+1)$ dimensions. These lattice charges coincide with those of the $U(1)_V$ and $U(1)_A$ global symmetries of Dirac fermions in the continuum limit, whose perturbative chiral anomaly matches the non-Abelian Onsager algebra on the lattice. In this note, we focus on the lattice models that flow to continuum quantum field theories of Dirac fermions that are free from the perturbative chiral anomaly between $U(1)_V$ and $U(1)_A$. In a lattice model that flows to two Dirac fermions, we identify quadratic Hamiltonian deformations that can gap the system while fully preserving both the vectorial and axial charges on the lattice. These deformations flow to the usual symmetry-preserving Dirac mass terms in the continuum. Additionally, we propose a lattice model that flows to the chiral fermion $3-4-5-0$ model in the continuum by using these lattice charges, and we discuss the multi-fermion interactions that can generate a mass gap in the paradigm of symmetric mass generation.

Title: Axisymmetric Pushing of a Spherical Cargo using an Active Spherical Janus Motor
Authors: Subramaniam Chembai Ganesh, Jessica S. Rosenberg, Jeffrey F. Morris, Joel Koplik, Charles Maldarelli
Abstract: We analyze the interaction between a self-diffusiophoretic spherical Janus motor and an inert spherical cargo particle in an axisymmetric configuration in the Stokes regime. To study the different configurations of the two spheres and their motions, we develop an analog to the twin multipole approach to numerically determine the axisymmetric stream function for the flow field. We verify the validity and accuracy of this approach using existing literature and COMSOL Multiphysics. We study the effects of the size of the Janus cap, the relative ratio of sizes of the two spheres, and their separation distance on their interactions. For the case of a stationary cargo, we identify the existence of a distinct regime where the Janus motor hovers at a finite separation distance from the cargo and summarize the results using a phase diagram. In the presence of a freely moving cargo, we analyze the steady terminal velocities of the Janus motor and the cargo to identify distinct conditions at which the two spheres can translate with equal velocities while maintaining a finite separation distance.

Title: Entropy and singular-value moments of products of truncated random unitary matrices
Authors: C.W.J. Beenakker
Abstract: Products of truncated unitary matrices, independently and uniformly drawn from the unitary group, can be used to study universal aspects of monitored quantum circuits. The von Neumann entropy of the corresponding density matrix decreases with increasing length $L$ of the product chain, in a way that depends on the matrix dimension $N$ and the truncation depth $\delta N$. Here we study that dependence in the double-scaling limit $L,N\rightarrow\infty$, at fixed ratio $\tau=L\delta N/N$. The entropy reduction crosses over from a linear to a logarithmic dependence on $\tau$ when this parameter crosses unity. The central technical result is an expression for the singular-value moments of the matrix product in terms of the Erlang function from queueing theory.

Title: Hamiltonian Lattice Gauge Theories: emergent properties from Tensor Network methods
Authors: Giovanni Cataldi
Abstract: This thesis develops advanced Tensor Network (TN) methods to address Hamiltonian Lattice Gauge Theories (LGTs), overcoming limitations in real-time dynamics and finite-density regimes. A novel dressed-site formalism is introduced, enabling efficient truncation of gauge fields while preserving gauge invariance for both Abelian and non-Abelian theories. This formalism is successfully applied to SU(2) Yang-Mills LGTs in two dimensions, providing the first TN simulations of this system and revealing critical aspects of its phase diagram and non-equilibrium behavior, such as a Quantum Many-Body (QMB) scarring dynamics. A generalization of the dressed-site formalism is proposed through a new fermion-to-qubit mapping for general lattice fermion theories, revealing powerful for classical and quantum simulations. Numerical innovations, including the use of optimal space-filling curves such as the Hilbert curve to preserve locality in high-dimensional simulations, further enhance the efficiency of these methods. Together with high-performance computing techniques, these advances open current and future development pathways toward optimized, efficient, and faster simulations on scales comparable to Monte Carlo state-of-the-art.

Title: Ultrasonic monitoring of carbonation in Portland cements
Authors: A. Villarreal, P.F.J. Cano-Barrita, F.M. Leon-Martinez, L. Medina, F. Castellanos
Abstract: Chemical reactions resulting from the ingress of carbonates into the cement matrix modify the properties of its pore solution, as well as its pore distribution and size. These changes lead to corrosion of the steel in reinforced concrete. The nature of conventional testing for the estimation of carbonation in cement-based materials is time-consuming and destructive. This paper presents a set of non-destructive ultrasound-based indexes, obtained solely from non-linear and linear analyses of ultrasonic signals, for measuring the carbonation of Portland cement pastes. Class 30RS cement pastes with three water/cement ratios by weight (0.4, 0.5, and 0.6) were considered. Carbonation was carried out for 120 days with a constant CO2 level of 4% by volume under controlled temperature and humidity, considering a unidirectional carbonation, parallel to the longitudinal axis of the samples. The level of carbonation was validated by FTIR measurements. From these analyses, different indexes with high correlation were obtained, estimated only from the ultrasonic signals and as a function of the days of exposure to carbonation, as well as of the percentage of carbonation. Further study is required for the evaluation of the reliability of these promising indexes for the determination of carbonation in cement-based materials.

Title: A Model for Self-Organized Growth, Branching, and Allometric Scaling of the Planarian Gut
Authors: Christian Hanauer, Amrutha Palavalli, Baiqun An, Efe Ilker, Jochen C. Rink, Frank Jülicher
Abstract: The growth and scaling of organs is a fundamental aspect of animal development. However, how organs grow to the right size and shape required by physiological demands, remains largely unknown. Here, we provide a framework combining theory and experiment to study the scaling of branched organs. As a biological model, we focus on the branching morphogenesis of the planarian gut, which is a highly branched organ responsible for the delivery of nutrients. Planarians undergo massive body size changes requiring gut morphology to adapt to these size variations. Our experimental analysis shows that various gut properties scale with organism size according to power laws. We introduce a theoretical framework to understand the growth and scaling of branched organs. Our theory considers the dynamics of the interface between organ and surrounding tissue to be controlled by a morphogen and illustrates how a shape instability of this interface can give rise to the self-organized formation and growth of complex branched patterns. Considering the reaction-diffusion dynamics in a growing domain representative of organismal growth, we show that a wide range of scaling behaviors of the branching pattern emerges from the interplay between interface dynamics and organism growth. Our model can recapitulate the scaling laws of planarian gut morphology that we quantified and also opens new directions for understanding allometric scaling laws in various other branching systems in organisms.

Title: Nonlinear optomechanical systems with quasi-periodic and chaotic dynamics
Authors: A.P. Saiko, G.A. Rusetsky, S.A. Markevich, R. Fedaruk
Abstract: Model optomechanical systems, in which the coupling between an optical field and a mechanical resonator is described by linear, quadratic, and cubic terms in mechanical displacements, are studied. It is shown that under conditions for adiabatic elimination of the cavity field, the dynamics of the mechanical resonator is determined by some effective, generally bistable, potential. The shape of this potential depends on the power of the optical driving field, detuning between the cavity and driving frequencies, the parameters of nonlinear optomechanical interactions and the decay rate of the cavity field. Examples of both periodic and chaotic behavior of the mechanical resonator are illustrated by determining the power spectrum of mechanical oscillations, constructing the corresponding phase portraits and Poincaré maps.

Title: Steady state and mixing of two run-and-tumble particles interacting through jamming and attractive forces
Authors: Leo Hahn (LMBP)
Abstract: We study the long-time behavior of two run-and-tumble particles on the real line subjected to an attractive interaction potential and jamming interactions, which prevent the particles from crossing. We provide the explicit invariant measure, a useful tool for studying clustering phenomena in out-ofequilibrium statistical mechanics, for different tumbling mechanisms and potentials. An important difference with invariant measures of equilibrium systems are Dirac masses on the boundary of the state space, due to the jamming interactions. Qualitative changes in the invariant measure depending on model parameters are also observed, suggesting, like a growing body of evidence, that run-andtumble particle systems can be classified into close-to-equilibrium and strongly out-of-equilibrium models. We also study the relaxation properties of the system, which are linked to the timescale at which clustering emerges from an arbitrary initial configuration. When the interaction potential is linear, we show that the total variation distance to the invariant measure decays exponentially and provide sharp bounds on the decay rate. When the interaction potential is harmonic, we give quantitative exponential bounds in a Wasserstein-type distance.

Title: Hydrodynamic flow field and frictional resistance coefficient of a disk rotating steadily in a compressible fluid layer with odd viscosity on a rigid substrate
Authors: Abdallah Daddi-Moussa-Ider, Yuto Hosaka, Elsen Tjhung, Andrej Vilfan
Abstract: We analyze the hydrodynamics of a rotating disk in a two-dimensional compressible fluid layer with odd viscosity. Unlike conventional fluids, odd viscosity introduces a radial flow component that can be directed either inward or outward, depending on its sign. This phenomenon is expected to significantly impact the hydrodynamic interactions between two rotating disks, potentially causing effective attraction or repulsion depending on the sign of the odd viscosity and the direction of rotation. Furthermore, we calculate the rotational resistance coefficient and find that odd viscosity increases this coefficient, regardless of its sign.

Nelson
Abstract: Systemic drug administration often causes off-target effects limiting the efficacy of advanced therapies. Targeted drug delivery approaches increase local drug concentrations at the diseased site while minimizing systemic drug exposure. We present a magnetically guided microrobotic drug delivery system capable of precise navigation under physiological conditions. This platform integrates a clinical electromagnetic navigation system, a custom-designed release catheter, and a dissolvable capsule for accurate therapeutic delivery. In vitro tests showed precise navigation in human vasculature models, and in vivo experiments confirmed tracking under fluoroscopy and successful navigation in large animal models. The microrobot balances magnetic material concentration, contrast agent loading, and therapeutic drug capacity, enabling effective hosting of therapeutics despite the integration complexity of its components, offering a promising solution for precise targeted drug delivery.

Title: Competition between thermocapillary and solutocapillary flows in thin liquid films
Authors: Darsh Kumar, Pradipta Kumar Panigrahi, Thomas Bickel
Abstract: We investigate the thermocapillary flow in a thin liquid film which is subjected to local heating, in the presence of insoluble surfactants. While surfactant molecules are first advected from warmer to cooler regions, the resulting concentration gradient drives a solutal counterflow in the opposite direction. This competition is theoretically addressed within the lubrication approximation. Assuming small deviations with respect to the mean surfactant concentration, we derive the time evolution equation governing the shape of the interface. Our study reveals that both interfacial deformations and velocities are progressively suppressed as the solutal Marangoni number increases. Our versatile model, adaptable to a range of experimental setups, offers a quantitative tool for understanding the effect of surfactants in thermocapillary-driven systems.

Title: Class Imbalance in Anomaly Detection: Learning from an Exactly Solvable Model
Authors: F.S. Pezzicoli, V. Ros, F.P. Landes, M. Baity-Jesi
Abstract: Class imbalance (CI) is a longstanding problem in machine learning, slowing down training and reducing performances. Although empirical remedies exist, it is often unclear which ones work best and when, due to the lack of an overarching theory. We address a common case of imbalance, that of anomaly (or outlier) detection. We provide a theoretical framework to analyze, interpret and address CI. It is based on an exact solution of the teacher-student perceptron model, through replica theory. Within this framework, one can distinguish several sources of CI: either intrinsic, train or test imbalance. Our analysis reveals that the optimal train imbalance is generally different from 50%, with a non trivial dependence on the intrinsic imbalance, the abundance of data and on the noise in the learning. Moreover, there is a crossover between a small noise training regime where results are independent of the noise level to a high noise regime where performances quickly degrade with noise. Our results challenge some of the conventional wisdom on CI and offer practical guidelines to address it.

Title: Cosmic Large-Scale Structure Formation from Newtonian Particle Dynamics
Authors: Tristan Daus, Elena Kozlikin
Abstract: We present results for the cosmic non-linear density-fluctuation power spectrum based on the analytical formalism developed in [1] which allows us to study cosmic structure formation based on Newtonian particle dynamics in phase-space. This framework provides a field-theory approach to a perturbative solution of the BBGKY-hierarchy where the resulting loop-expansion of the theory introduces a natural truncation criterion. We show that we are able to reproduce structure growth on large scales $k \leq 0.2 \mathrm{h}\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ to very high precision while on small and intermediate scales we find deviations of the order of $10\%$ from current numerical simulations. The results strongly suggest that a significant improvement may be achieved by restructuring the perturbation theory.

Title: Squeezing generation crossing a mean-field critical point: Work statistics, irreversibility and critical fingerprints
Authors: Fernando J. Gómez-Ruiz, Stefano Gherardini, Ricardo Puebla
Abstract: Understanding the dynamical consequences of quantum phase transitions on thermodynamical quantities, such as work statistics and entropy production, is one of the most intriguing aspect of quantum many-body systems, pinpointing the emergence of irreversibility to critical features. In this work, we investigate the critical fingerprints appearing in these key thermodynamical quantities for a mean-field critical system undergoing a finite-time cycle, starting from a thermal state at a generic inverse temperature. In contrast to spatially extended systems, the presence of a mean-field critical point in a finite-time cycle leads to constant irreversible work even in the limit of infinitely slow driving. This links with the fact that a slow finite-time cycle results in a constant amount of squeezing, which enables us to derive analytical expressions for the work statistics and irreversible entropy, depending solely on the mean-field critical exponents and the functional form of the control parameter near the critical point. We find that the probability of observing negative work values, corresponding to negative irreversible entropy, is inversely proportional to the time the system remains near to the critical point, and this trend becomes less pronounced the lower the temperature of the initial thermal state. Finally, we determine the irreversibility traits under squeezing generation at zero-temperature using the relative entropy of coherence.

Title: Ferromagnets from higher $SU(N)$ representations
Authors: Alexios P. Polychronakos, Konstantinos Sfetsos
Abstract: We present a general formalism for deriving the thermodynamics of ferromagnets consisting of "atoms" carrying an arbitrary irreducible representation of $SU(N)$ and coupled through long-range two-body quadratic interactions. Using this formalism, we derive the thermodynamics and phase structure of ferromagnets with atoms in the doubly symmetric or doubly antisymmetric irreducible representations. The symmetric representation leads to a paramagnetic and a ferromagnetic phase with transitions similar to the ones for the fundamental representation studied before. The antisymmetric representation presents qualitatively new features, leading to a paramagnetic and two distinct ferromagnetic phases that can coexist over a range of temperatures, two of them becoming metastable. Our results are relevant to magnetic systems of atoms with reduced symmetry in their interactions compared to the fundamental case.

Authors: Andrei A. Stepanenko, Kseniia S. Chernova, Maxim A. Gorlach
Abstract: Recent technological advances have allowed the fabrication of large arrays of coupled qubits serving as prototypes of quantum processors. However, the optimal control of such systems is notoriously hard, which limits the potential of large-scale quantum systems. Here, we investigate a model problem of quantum state transfer in a large nearest-neighbor-coupled qubit array and derive an optimal control that simultaneously enables maximal fidelity and minimal time of the transfer.

Title: Modeling finite viscoelasticity based on the Green-Naghdi kinematic assumption and generalized strains
Authors: Ju Liu, Chongran Zhao, Jiashen Guan
Abstract: We propose a modeling framework for finite viscoelasticity, inspired by the kinematic assumption made by Green and Naghdi in plasticity. This approach fundamentally differs from the widely used multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient, as the intermediate configuration, a concept that remains debated, becomes unnecessary. The advent of the concept of generalized strains allows the Green-Naghdi assumption to be employed with different strains, offering a flexible mechanism to separate inelastic deformation from total deformation. This leads to a constitutive theory in which the kinematic separation is adjustable and can be calibrated. For quadratic configurational free energy, the framework yields a suite of finite linear viscoelasticity models governed by linear evolution equations. Notably, these models recover established models, including those by Green and Tobolsky (1946) and Simo (1987), when the Seth-Hill strain is chosen with the strain parameter being -2 and 2, respectively. It is also related to the model of Miehe and Keck (2000) when the strain is of the Hencky type. We further extend the approach by adopting coercive strains, which allows us to define an elastic deformation tensor locally. This facilitates modeling the viscous branch using general forms of the configurational free energy, and we construct a micromechanical viscoelastic model as a representative instantiation. The constitutive integration algorithms of the proposed models are detailed. We employ the experimental data of VHB 4910 to examine the proposed models, which demonstrate their effectiveness and potential advantages in the quality of fitting and prediction. Three-dimensional finite element analysis is also conducted to assess the influence of different strains on the viscoelastic behavior.

Title: Large Amplitude Oscillatory Extension (LAOE) of dilute polymer solutions
Authors: Steffen M. Recktenwald, Thomas P. John, Amy Q. Shen, Robert J. Poole, Cláudio P. Fonte, Simon J. Haward
Abstract: This study presents an experimental framework for large amplitude oscillatory extension (LAOE) to investigate nonlinear material properties of complex fluids. Using a microfluidic optimized shape cross-slot extensional rheometer, we generate approximately homogeneous planar extensional flows driven by programmable syringe pumps operating in oscillatory or pulsatile sinusoidal modes. Micro-particle image velocimetry and simultaneous pressure drop measurements are employed to analyze the time-dependent flow field and elastic stress response. For Newtonian fluids, a linear relationship between the applied strain rate and pressure drop is observed across a wide range of oscillation amplitudes and frequencies. In contrast, dilute polymer solutions exhibit significant deviations, with excess pressure drops and divergence between average strain rates along extension and compression axes during the LAOE cycle. By spanning a broad range of Weissenberg and Deborah numbers, we identify unique Lissajous curves and critical conditions for the onset of nonlinearities under oscillatory extension. Numerical simulations, assuming homogeneous flow, underpin the experimental findings, validating the robustness of our microfluidic approach. This study demonstrates the utility of oscillatory extensional flows for probing the nonlinear rheological behavior of soft materials, offering quantitative insights into their extensional properties under nonlinear flow conditions.

Title: Hamiltonian $k$-Locality is the Key Resource for Powerful Quantum Battery Charging
Authors: Anupam Sarkar, Sibasish Ghosh
Abstract: Storing and extracting energy using quantum degrees of freedom is a promising approach to leveraging quantum effects in energy science. Early experimental efforts have already demonstrated its potential to surpass the charging power of existing technologies. In this context, it is crucial to identify the specific quantum effects that can be exploited to design the most efficient quantum batteries and push their performance to the ultimate limit. While entanglement has often been considered a key factor in enhancing charging (or discharging) power, our findings reveal that it is not as critical as previously thought. Instead, three parameters emerge as the most significant in determining the upper bound of instantaneous charging power: the locality of the battery and charger Hamiltonians, and the maximum energy storable in a single unit cell of the battery. To derive this new bound, we have also addressed several open questions previously noted in the literature but lacks an explanation. This bound provides a foundation for designing the most powerful charger-battery systems, where combined optimization of both components offers enhancements that cannot be achieved by manipulating only one of them.

Title: Quantum Dynamics of Dissipative Polarizable Media
Authors: Frank Ernesto Quintela Rodriguez, Piero Lafiosca, Tommaso Giovannini, Chiara Cappelli
Abstract: Classical polarizable approaches have become the gold standard for simulating complex systems and processes in the condensed phase. These methods describe intrinsically dissipative polarizable media, requiring a formal definition within the framework of open quantum systems. We present a Hamiltonian formulation for the quantum dynamics of polarizable sources based on a generalized theory of the damped harmonic oscillator, using pseudo-boson theory to characterize their coherent state dynamics. Exploiting the phase space formulation of quantum mechanics and the integrability of quadratic Hamiltonians, we derive a self-consistent relation for the emitted electric field of the polarizable medium under the semiclassical approximation, based on exact formulas for medium polarization. Finally, we derive the master equation describing the open dynamics of a quantum system interacting with the quantum polarizable medium, along with analytical expressions for correlation functions calculated over arbitrary Gaussian states.

Title: Using Space-Filling Curves and Fractals to Reveal Spatial and Temporal Patterns in Neuroimaging Data
Authors: Jacek Grela, Zbigniew Drogosz, Jakub Janarek, Jeremi K. Ochab, Ignacio Cifre, Ewa Gudowska-Nowak, Maciej A. Nowak, Paweł Oświęcimka, Dante R. Chialvo
Abstract: We present a novel method, Fractal Space-Curve Analysis (FSCA), which combines Space-Filling Curve (SFC) mapping for dimensionality reduction with fractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA). The method is suitable for multidimensional geometrically embedded data, especially for neuroimaging data which is highly correlated temporally and spatially. We conduct extensive feasibility studies on diverse, artificially generated data with known fractal characteristics: the fractional Brownian motion, Cantor sets, and Gaussian processes. We compare the suitability of dimensionality reduction via Hilbert SFC and a data-driven alternative. FSCA is then successfully applied to real-world magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional MRI (fMRI) scans. The method utilizing Hilbert curves is optimized for computational efficiency, proven robust against boundary effects typical in experimental data analysis, and resistant to data sub-sampling. It is able to correctly quantify and discern correlations in both stationary and dynamic two-dimensional images. In MRI Alzheimer's dataset, patients reveal a progression of the disease associated with a systematic decrease of the Hurst exponent. In fMRI recording of breath-holding task, the change in the exponent allows distinguishing different experimental phases. This study introduces a robust method for fractal characterization of spatial and temporal correlations in many types of multidimensional neuroimaging data. Very few assumptions allow it to be generalized to more dimensions than typical for neuroimaging and utilized in other scientific fields. The method can be particularly useful in analyzing fMRI experiments to compute markers of pathological conditions resulting from neurodegeneration. We also showcase its potential for providing insights into brain dynamics in task-related experiments.

Title: Discontinuous phase transition of feature detection in lateral predictive coding
Authors: Zhen-Ye Huang, Weikang Wang, Hai-Jun Zhou
Abstract: The brain adopts the strategy of lateral predictive coding (LPC) to construct optimal internal representations for salient features in input sensory signals to reduce the energetic cost of information transmission. Here we consider the task of distinguishing a non-Gaussian signal by LPC from $(N-1)$ Gaussian background signals of the same magnitude, which is intractable by principal component decomposition. We study the emergence of feature detection function from the perspective of statistical mechanics, and formulate a thermodynamic free energy to implement the tradeoff between energetic cost $E$ and information robustness. We define $E$ as the mean $L_1$-norm of the internal state vectors, and quantify the level of information robustness by an entropy measure $S$. We demonstrate that energy--information tradeoff may induce a discontinuous phase transition of the optimal matrix, from a very weak one with $S \approx 0$ to a functional LPC system with moderate synaptic weights in which a single unit responds selectively to the input non-Gaussian feature with high signal-to-noise ratio.

Title: Evaluating many-body stabilizer R\'enyi entropy by sampling reduced Pauli strings: singularities, volume law, and nonlocal magic
Authors: Yi-Ming Ding, Zhe Wang, Zheng Yan
Abstract: We present a novel quantum Monte Carlo scheme for evaluating the $\alpha$-stabilizer Rényi entropy (SRE) with any integer $\alpha\ge 2$. By interpreting $\alpha$-SRE as a ratio of generalized partition functions, we prove that it can be simulated by sampling reduced Pauli strings within a reduced configuration space. This allows for straightforward computation of the values and derivatives of $\alpha$-SRE using techniques such as reweight-annealing and thermodynamic integration. Moreover, our approach separates the free energy contribution in $\alpha$-SRE, thus the contribution solely from the characteristic function can be studied, which is directly tied to magic. In our applications to the ground states of 1D and 2D transverse field Ising (TFI) model, we reveal that the behavior of $2$-SRE is governed by the interplay between the characteristic function and the free energy contributions, with singularities hidden in both of their derivatives at quantum critical points. This indicates that $\alpha$-SRE does not necessarily exhibit a peak at the quantum critical point for a general many-body system. We also study the volume-law corrections to the ground-state magic. These corrections slightly violate the strict volume law and suggest discontinuity at quantum critical points, which we attribute to the abrupt change of the ground-state magical structure. Our findings suggest that volume-law corrections of magic are stronger diagnostics for criticalities than the full-state magic. Lastly, we study the finite-temperature phase transition of the 2D TFI model, where the $2$-SRE is not a well-defined magic measure. The nonphysical results we obtain also prove the ineffectiveness of $2$-SRE for mixed states. Our method enables scalable and efficient evaluation of $\alpha$-SRE in large-scale quantum systems, providing a powerful tool for exploring the roles of magic in many-body systems.

Title: On the practical applicability of modern DFT functionals for chemical computations. Case study of DM21 applicability for geometry optimization
Authors: Kirill Kulaev, Alexander Ryabov, Michael Medvedev, Evgeny Burnaev, Vladimir Vanovskiy
Abstract: Density functional theory (DFT) is probably the most promising approach for quantum chemistry calculations considering its good balance between calculations precision and speed. In recent years, several neural network-based functionals have been developed for exchange-correlation energy approximation in DFT, DM21 developed by Google Deepmind being the most notable between them. This study focuses on evaluating the efficiency of DM21 functional in predicting molecular geometries, with a focus on the influence of oscillatory behavior in neural network exchange-correlation functionals. We implemented geometry optimization in PySCF for the DM21 functional in geometry optimization problem, compared its performance with traditional functionals, and tested it on various benchmarks. Our findings reveal both the potential and the current challenges of using neural network functionals for geometry optimization in DFT. We propose a solution extending the practical applicability of such functionals and allowing to model new substances with their help.

Title: Magnetic Trampoline Resonators from (La,Sr)MnO3 Single-Crystal Thin Films
Authors: Nicola Manca, Dhavalkumar Mungpara, Leonélio Cichetto Jr., Alejandro E. Plaza, Gianrico Lamura, Alexander Schwarz, Daniele Marré, Luca Pellegrino
Abstract: Micro-electro-mechanical resonators employing a magnetic element have been proposed for magnetic field sensing applications, but the integration of magnetic materials with standard semiconductor compounds is challenging and requires complex fabrication protocols. We present a different approach relying on (La0.7,Sr0.3)MnO3 (LSMO), an oxide compound that works both as structural element for the resonator and functional magnetic layer. Suspended trampolines are realized in a single step process from LSMO thin films and show quality factor up to 60k and fQ products reaching 10$^{10}$ Hz. Their magnetic properties are probed by a SQUID magnetometer and magnetic force microscopy, showing saturation magnetization of 240 kA/m at room temperature and in-plane magnetic domains with coercivity of 2.5 mT. Being entirely made from a magnetic material, these resonators exhibit a larger magnetic interaction volume compared to other solutions, making them ideal candidates as building blocks for high-sensitivity magnetic field sensors.

Title: Apparent violations of the second law in the quantum-classical dynamics of interacting levitated nanoparticles
Authors: Pedro V. Paraguassú, Thiago Guerreiro
Abstract: Random exchanges of energy arise naturally in stochastic systems. As a consequence, apparent violations of the second law of thermodynamics can occur, as it holds true on average. Here we investigate the occurrence of these apparent violations -- termed free lunches -- in a quantum-classical system comprised of levitated nanoparticles exchanging energy via the Coulomb interaction. We consider different initial states for the quantum system, and how these exert work and fluctuations upon the classical particle affecting the probability of free lunches. With that, we initiate the study of hybrid quantum-classical systems through the lens of stochastic thermodynamics.

Title: Decoherence of Schr\"odinger cat states in light of wave/particle duality
Authors: Th. K. Mavrogordatos
Abstract: We challenge the standard picture of decohering Schrödinger cat states as an ensemble average obeying a Lindblad master equation, brought about locally from an irreversible interaction with an environment. We generate self-consistent collections of pure system states correlated with specific environmental records, corresponding to the function of the wave-particle correlator first introduced in Carmichael {\it et al.} [Phys. Rev. Lett. 85, 1855 (2000)]. In the spirit of Carmichael {\it et al.} [Coherent States: Past, Present and Future, pp. 75--91, World Scientific (1994)], we find that the complementary unravelings evince a pronounced disparity when the ``position'' and ``momentum'' of the damped cavity mode -- an explicitly open quantum system -- are measured. Intensity-field correlations may largely deviate from a monotonic decay, while Wigner functions of the cavity state display contrasting manifestations of quantum interference when conditioned on photon counts sampling a continuous photocurrent. In turn, the conditional photodetection events mark the contextual diffusion of both the net charge generated at the homodyne detector, and the electromagnetic field amplitude in the resonator.

Title: Topological and nonlinearity-induced thermalization in a PT-symmetric split-Langevin bath
Authors: Andrew K. Harter, Donald J. Priour Jr., Daniel Sweeney, Avadh Saxena, Yogesh N. Joglekar
Abstract: Open classical systems with balanced, separated gain and loss, called PT-symmetric systems, have been extensively studied over the past decade. Here, we investigate the properties of a uniform, harmonic chain with spatially separated viscous loss and stochastic gain that are only statistically balanced. We show that such a "split Langevin" bath leads to either the absence of thermalization or non-equilibrium steady states with inhomogeneous temperature profile, both of which are understood in terms of normal modes of the chain. With a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain, a canonical model with topological edge modes, we show that the steady-state properties reflect the topological phase of the underlying chain. We also show that nonlinearity stabilizes the amplifying modes in a harmonic chain, thereby leading to thermalization irrespective of the gain and loss locations. Our results expand the pool of possible realizations of non-Hermitian models to the stochastic domain.

Abstract: Magnetic topological insulators (MTIs) are narrow gap semiconductor materials that combine non-trivial band topology and magnetic order. Unlike their nonmagnetic counterparts, MTIs may have some of the surfaces gapped due to breaking the time-reversal symmetry, which enables a number of exotic phenomena having potential applications in spintronics. So far, MTIs have only been created by means of doping nonmagnetic TIs with 3d transition metal elements, however, such an approach leads to strongly inhomogeneous magnetic and electronic properties of these materials, restricting the observation of important effects to very low temperatures. Finding intrinsic MTI, i.e. a stoichiometric well-ordered magnetic compound, could be an ideal solution to these problems, but no such material was observed to date. Here, using density functional theory we predict and further confirm by means of structural, transport, magnetic, angle- and spin-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements the realization of the antiferromagnetic (AFM) TI phase, that is hosted by the van der Waals layered compound MnBi$_2$Te$_4$. An interlayer AFM ordering makes MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ invariant with respect to the combination of the time-reversal ($\Theta$) and primitive-lattice translation ($T_{1/2}$) symmetries, $S = \Theta T_{1/2}$, giving rise to the $Z_2$ topological classification of AFM insulators. We find $Z_2 = 1$ for MnBi$_2$Te$_4$, which confirms its topologically nontrivial nature. The $S$-breaking (0001) surface of MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ exhibits a giant bandgap in the topological surface state as evidenced by ab initio calculations and photoemission measurements. These results culminate almost a decade-long search of an AFMTI, predicted in 2010. Furthermore, MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ is the first intrinsic magnetic TI realized experimentally.

Title: Electrochemically induced switching from antiferromagnetic spin-chain to frustrated spin-glass state in maple-leaf lattice Na2Mn3O7
Authors: Corson Chao, Shivani Srivastava, Ming Lei, Bachu Sravan Kumar, Varun Kamboj, Hari Ramachandran, Zhelong Jiang, Anirudh Adavi, Kevin H. Stone, Mark Asta, Lilia S. Xie, Iwnetim I. Abate
Abstract: We report the electrochemical tuning of magnetic properties in the Na2Mn3O7 maple-leaf lattice (MLL) through ion deintercalation, revealing a switch from the 1D antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin-chain behavior of the S=3/2 MLL structure to frustrated magnetism spin-glass behavior. By utilizing Na deintercalation, we stabilize ferromagnetic (FM) short-range interactions within the original short-range AFM system, creating magnetic frustration within the system beyond that induced from the MLL geometrically frustrated structure, leading to a spin-glass state. Magnetic and structural analyses, combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, demonstrate the near-degeneracy between AFM and FM configurations in Na2Mn3O7, suggesting that the altered lattice distortions and disorder introduced via deintercalation are responsible for the frustrated magnetism. Our findings provide a novel platform for studying low-dimensional magnetism, spin glass behavior, and potential applications in spintronics and computing technologies. This study represents the first observation of an induced spin glass state in MLL materials and is a rare example of electrochemically induced spin glass state, highlighting the critical role of ion intercalation in tuning magnetic interactions.

Title: Data-driven Investigation of Cotton Fabric Behavior Modified by Straight and Zig-Zag Stitches
Authors: Harmony Werth, Kazi Zihan Hossain, Momena Monwar, M. Rashed Khan
Abstract: In this article, we demonstrate a data-driven approach to investigate the behavior of cotton fabric modified by straight and zig-zag stitches. Existing literature in understanding the mechanical behavior of soft materials (e.g., textile-based fibers or fabrics) heavily relies on stress-strain analyses. However, the strain-induced deformation behavior can be further analyzed by taking advantage of data-driven constitutive models. Such an approach reveals intermolecular parameters that can be utilized further in design and development analyses. For that, we exhibit the altered mechanics of base cotton fabric induced by two types of singular stitches (straight and zig-zag). We have sewn simple straight and zig-zag cotton stitches to investigate the mechanics of the base cotton fabrics using uniaxial stress-strain experimental data. Then, we leveraged the constitutive models (i.e., three-network model, TNM) obtained from MCalibration software to reveal eleven intermolecular parameters for data-driven investigations. Our experimental analyses, combined with the data, suggest a 99.99% confidence in assessing the mechanical impact of stitches on cotton fabrics. We have also used distributed strain energy to analyze the mechanics and failure of the base and stitched fabrics. Once adopted, our study may contribute to an improved understanding of the production of smart wearables and e-textiles.

Title: Magneto-nonlinear Hall effect in time-reversal breaking system
Authors: Anwei Zhang, Jun-Won Rhim
Abstract: Magneto-nonlinear Hall effect is known to be intrinsic and requires time-reversal symmetry. Here we show that a new type of magneto-nonlinear Hall effect can occur in the time-reversal breaking materials within the second-order response to in-plane electric and vertical magnetic fields. Such a Hall response is generated by the oscillation of the electromagnetic field and has a quantum origin arising from a geometric quantity associated with the Berry curvature and band velocity. We demonstrate that the massive Dirac model of LaAlO3/LaNiO3/LaAlO3 quantum well can be used to detect this Hall effect. Our work widens the theory of the Hall effect in the time-reversal breaking system by proposing a new kind of nonlinear electromagnetic response.

Title: Triboelectric Charging Model for Particles with Rough Surfaces
Authors: Simon Jantač, Jarmila Pelcová, Jana Sklenářová, Marek Drápela, Holger Grosshans, Juraj Kosek
Abstract: The triboelectric charging of particles depends on the contact area of the particle and the contacting surface. Even though the surface topology determines the real contact area, particle charging models do not account for surface roughness. In this paper, we combine contact mechanics and triboelectrification models to predict the charging of rough particles. First, a laser confocal microscope measured the statistical descriptors of polyethylene (PE) particles surface topology. Then, we descriptors particle surfaces by distributing spheroidal asperities on the smooth particle core until the surface roughness reaches the measured value. The Hertz contact mechanics model predicts the deformation of the asperity-covered particle and the resulting real contact area in dependence on impact velocity. Finally, we introduced the real contact area into the condenser model for triboelectric particle charging. The accuracy of the new model predictions was demonstrated by comparing it to a more complex surface reconstructions that account for the fractal surface topology. Furthermore, the model's predicted particle saturation charges agree well with our shaker experiments and with experimental data in the literature on the charging of plane surfaces. The developed triboelectric charging model for particles with rough surfaces is simple and requires only standard descriptors of the surface topology; thus, it suits large-scale simulations of electrifying powder flows.

Title: Higher-Order Topological Insulators via Momentum-Space Nonsymmorphic Symmetries
Authors: Jinbing Hu, Songlin Zhuang, Yi Yang
Abstract: The topology of the Brillouin zone, foundational in topological physics, is always assumed to be a torus. We theoretically report the construction of Brillouin real projective plane ($\mathrm{RP}^2$) and the appearance of quadrupole insulating phase, which are enabled by momentum-space nonsymmorphic symmetries stemming from $\mathbb{Z}_2$ synthetic gauge fields. We show that the momentum-space nonsymmorphic symmetries quantize bulk polarization and Wannier-sector polarization nonlocally across different momenta, resulting in quantized corner charges and an isotropic binary bulk quadrupole phase diagram, where the phase transition is triggered by a bulk energy gap closing. Under open boundary conditions, the nontrivial bulk quadrupole phase manifests either trivial or nontrivial edge polarization, resulting from the violation of momentum-space nonsymmorphic symmetries under lattice termination. We present a concrete design for the $\mathrm{RP}^2$ quadrupole insulator based on acoustic resonator arrays and discuss its feasibility in optics, mechanics, and electrical circuits. Our results show that deforming the Brillouin manifold creates opportunities for realizing high-order band topology.

Title: Single electron routing in a silicon quantum-dot array
Authors: Takeru Utsugi, Takuma Kuno, Noriyuki Lee, Ryuta Tsuchiya, Toshiyuki Mine, Digh Hisamoto, Shinichi Saito, Hiroyuki Mizuno
Abstract: The ability to transport single electrons on a quantum dot array dramatically increases the freedom in designing quantum computation schemes that can be implemented on solid-state devices. So far, however, routing schemes to precisely control the transport paths of single electrons have yet to be established. Here, we propose a silicon single-electron router that transports pumped electrons along the desired route on the branches of a T-shaped quantum dot array by inputting a synchronous phase-controlled signal to multiple gates. Notably, we show that it is possible to achieve a routing accuracy above 99\% by boosting the accuracy of the electron-transport timing with an assist gate in front of the branching paths. We also evaluated the minimum error rate of routing by the model of electron transport based on the Wigner representation in an energy-time space. The results suggest new possibilities for fast and accurate transport of single electrons on the two-dimensional quantum dot arrays.

Title: Emergent Atomic Environments in Twisted Bilayer Graphene and Their Use in the Prediction of the Vibrational Properties
Authors: Dilara Ickecan, Yunus Emre Okyayli, Erdi Ata Bleda, Dogan Erbahar
Abstract: While Bernal stacked bilayer graphene bears two distinct atom types in its lattice, there exists no analytical framework addressing the number of atomic environments that emerge in twisted bilayer graphene superlattices. Here, we computationally analyze 140 different twisted bilayer superlattices using descriptor functions to study the emergent local environments. Our study reveals that the number of atoms with unique local environments depend on the superlattice size linearly manifesting itself on two distinct lines in accordance with the respective space groups. We then introduce the use of local environments in the investigation of vibrational properties. Local phonon density of states of the atoms with unique local environments are calculated by molecular dynamics simulations and are used to train a machine learning model. This model is used to predict the phonon density of states of twisted bilayer structures. Performance of the trained model is cross validated and discussed thoroughly via different selection of training and test sets. It is shown that the model proves effective in predicting the vibrational properties of any given twisted bilayer structure. Since the generic method presented reaches far beyond twisted bilayer graphene the possible applications ranging from non-periodic structures to strain induced moiré superlattices are also discussed.

Title: Resonance Cascades and Number Theory
Authors: Oleksandr V. Marchukov, Maxim Olshanii
Abstract: In this article, we are interested in situations where the existence of a contiguous cascade of quantum resonant transitions is predicated on the validity of a particular statement in number theory. The setting is a tailored one-atom one-dimensional potential with a prescribed spectrum, under a weak periodic perturbation. The former is, by now, an experimental reality [D. Cassettari, G. Mussardo and A. Trombettoni, PNAS Nexus {\bf 2}, pgac279 (2022)]. As a case study, we look at the following trivial statement: "Any power of $3$ is an integer." Consequently, we "test" this statement in a numerical experiment where we demonstrate an unimpeded upward mobility along an equidistant, $\ln(3)$-spaced subsequence of the energy levels of a potential with a log-natural spectrum, under a frequency $\ln(3)$ time-periodic perturbation. We further show that when we "remove" $9$ from the set of integers -- by excluding the corresponding energy level from the spectrum -- the cascade halts abruptly.

Title: Theory of biexciton-polaritons in transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers
Authors: Andrey Kudlis, Ivan A. Aleksandrov, Mikhail M. Glazov, Ivan A. Shelykh
Abstract: We theoretically investigate a nonlinear optical response of a planar microcavity with an embedded transition metal dicalcogenide monolayer when the energy of a biexcitonic transition is brought in resonance with the energy of a cavity mode. We demonstrate that the emission spectrum of this system strongly depends on an external pump. For small and moderate pumps, we reveal the presence of a doublet in the emission with the corresponding Rabi splitting scaling as a square root of the number of the excitations in the system. Further increase of the pump leads to the reshaping of the spectrum, which demonstrates, at weak damping, the pattern akin a Mollow triplet. An intermediate pumping regime shows a broad irregular spectrum reminiscent of a chaotic dynamics of the system.

Title: Disorder-free Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev models: Integrability and a precursor of chaos
Authors: Soshun Ozaki, Hosho Katsura
Abstract: We introduce two disorder-free variants of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, demonstrate their integrability, and study their static and dynamical properties. Unlike diagrammatic techniques, the integrability of these models allows us to obtain dynamical correlation functions even when the number of Majorana fermions is finite. From the solutions, we find that out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs) in these models exhibit exponential growth at early times, resembling that of quantum chaotic systems, such as those with disorder or external kick terms, despite their large $N$ behavior differing from that of typical chaotic systems. Conversely, our analysis shows no evidence of random-matrix behavior in level statistics or the spectral form factor. Our findings illustrate that the clean versions of the SYK models represent simple but nontrivial examples of disorder-free quantum many-body systems displaying chaos-like behavior of OTOCs.

Title: Geometrothermodynamic description of magnetic materials
Authors: Hernando Quevedo, Maria N. Quevedo, Alberto Sanchez
Abstract: We perform a statistical and geometrothermodynamic analysis of three different models of magnetic materials, namely, the translational free model, the spin model, and the mean-field model. First, we derive the fundamental equation for each model, which is then used as input to compute the metrics of the corresponding equilibrium spaces. Analyzing the corresponding geometrothermodynamic curvatures, we conclude that they can be used to describe thermodynamic interaction, stability conditions, and the phase transition structure of the modeled substances. In all the cases, we reproduce their well-known behavior close to the Curie temperature. Moreover, in the case of the model with spin, we found a curvature singularity which corresponds to a novel transition, where a particular response function diverges, indicating the presence of a second order phase transition, according to Ehrenfest classification.

Title: Magnon spectrum of altermagnets beyond linear spin wave theory: Magnon-magnon interactions via time-dependent matrix product states vs. atomistic spin dynamics
Authors: Federico Garcia-Gaitan, Ali Kefayati, John Q. Xiao, Branislav K. Nikolic
Abstract: The energy-momentum dispersion of magnons, as collective low-energy excitations of magnetic material, is computed from an effective quantum spin Hamiltonian but simplified via linearized Holstein-Primakoff transformations to describe noninteracting magnons. The dispersion produced by such linear spin wave theory (LSWT) is then plotted as ``sharp bands'' of infinitely long-lived quasiparticles. However, magnons are prone to many-body interactions with other quasiparticles -- such as electrons, phonons or other magnons -- which can lead to shifting (i.e., band renormalization) and broadening of ``sharp bands'' as the signature of finite quasiparticle lifetime. The magnon-magnon interactions can be particularly important in antiferromagnets (AFs), and, therefore, possibly in newly classified altermagnets sharing many features of collinear AFs. Here, we employ nonperturbative quantum many-body calculations, via time-dependent matrix product states (TDMPS), to obtain magnon spectral function for RuO$_2$ altermagnet whose effective quantum spin Hamiltonian is put onto 4-leg cylinder. Its upper band is shifted away from upper ``sharp band'' of LSWT, as well as broadened, which is explained as the consequence of {\em hybridization} of the latter with three-magnon continuum. This implies that two-magnon Raman scattering spectra {\em cannot} be computed from LSWT bands, which offers a litmus test for the relevance of magnon-magnon interactions. Finally, we employ atomistic spin dynamics (ASD) simulations, based on classical Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation, to obtain magnon spectrum at finite temperature and/or at a fraction of the cost of TDMPS calculations. Despite including magnon-magnon interactions via nonlinearity of LLG equation, ASD simulations {\em cannot} match the TDMPS-computed magnon spectrum, thereby signaling {\em nonclassical} effects harbored by AFs and altermagnets.

Title: Evolving disorder and chaos enhances the wave speed of elastic waves
Authors: M. Ahumada, L. Trujillo, J. F. Marín
Abstract: Static or frozen disorder, characterised by spatial heterogeneities, influences diverse complex systems, encompassing many-body systems, equilibrium and nonequilibrium states of matter, intricate network topologies, biological systems, and wave-matter interactions. While static disorder has been thoroughly examined, delving into evolving disorder brings increased intricacy to the issue. An example of this complexity is the observation of stochastic acceleration of electromagnetic waves in evolving media, where noisy fluctuations in the propagation medium transfer effective momentum to the wave. Here, we investigate elastic wave propagation in a one-dimensional heterogeneous medium with diagonal disorder. We examine two types of complex elastic materials: one with static disorder, where mass density randomly varies in space, and the other with evolving disorder, featuring random variations in both space and time. Our results indicate that evolving disorder enhances the propagation speed of Gaussian pulses compared to static disorder. Additionally, we demonstrate that the enhanced speed effect also occurs when the medium evolves chaotically rather than randomly over time. The latter establishes that evolving randomness is not a unique prerequisite for observing the enhanced transport of wavefronts, introducing the concept of chaotic speed enhancement of waves in complex media.

Title: Memory in cyclically crumpled sheets
Authors: Amit Dawadi, Arshad Kudrolli
Abstract: We investigate the crumpling of a sheet as it is repeatedly crushed onto itself by rolling it into a cylinder and twisting it axially while allowing the end-to-end length to evolve freely. As deduced from its plastic deformations, the sheet creases and collapses into structures which repeat and sharpen over hundreds of cycles to a remarkable degree before forming new configurations. The observed metastablilty increases with applied cycles leading to recurrent structures over a significant range of loading, but reconfigurations can continue to occur for large enough loading as the creases develop tears. The evolution of the sheet structure as measured by the mean curvature and the total crease length is found to increase logarithmically with cycle number with a rate which increases with degree of compression. We explain the overall extent of creasing using flat folding models, and show the logarithmic growth as being a consequence of individual creases becoming sharper with number of folding cycles, and due to the bifurcation in the curvature field leading to the formation of new creases and folding pathways. Thus, we show that elastoplastic sheets can follow complex folding pathways to form convergent structures after a sufficiently large number of training cycles provided material fatigue remains unimportant.

Title: Topological Optical Pseudospin Injection Beyond Weyl Semimetals
Authors: Suvendu Ghosh, Chuanchang Zeng, A. Taraphder, Jian-Xin Zhu, Snehasish Nandy
Abstract: Photoinduced effects are now reckoned to be important tools to reveal a rich gamut of entrancing physics in topological materials, which are normally inaccessible to conventional probes. Here we investigate one of these intriguing effects, namely, optical pseudospin injection (OPI) beyond ordinary Weyl semimetals (WSMs), specifically in multi-WSMs (mWSMs) and higher-order WSMs. Remarkably, we demonstrate that OPI in mWSMs is independent of the frequency of the light and linearly proportional to the quantized topological charge as a consequence of the inherent band linearity in their dispersions. Interestingly, while the response does not depend on the tilting of a type-I node, it is a decreasing function of the same in type-II mWSMs. We also reveal that the frequency independence can be destroyed either by going beyond a certain cutoff frequency under lattice regularization or by going to a higher-order Weyl phase. The predicted signatures of OPI beyond the ordinary WSM could be experimentally exploited, leading to effective access as well as distinguishing between different nontrivial Weyl topologies.

Title: Quantum many-body scars with unconventional superconducting pairing symmetries via multibody interactions
Authors: Shohei Imai, Naoto Tsuji
Abstract: We present a systematic framework to construct model Hamiltonians that have unconventional superconducting pairing states as exact energy eigenstates, by incorporating multibody interactions (i.e., interactions among more than two particles). The multibody interactions are introduced in a form of the local density-density coupling in such a way that any pair configuration in real space has a constant interaction energy by canceling the two-body and multibody interactions. Our approach is applicable to both spinless and spinful models in any spatial dimensions and on any bipartite lattices, facilitating an exhaustive extension of Yang's $s$-wave $\eta$-pairing state to various other unconventional pairing symmetries ($p$-wave, $d$-wave, $f$-wave, etc.). Particularly, the constructed eigenstates have off-site pairs with finite center-of-mass momentum, which leads to superconducting states with either even-parity and spin-triplet or odd-parity and spin-singlet symmetry. We verify that the two-dimensional spinful Hubbard model on a square lattice with the multibody interactions has the spin-triplet $d$-wave pairing state as an energy eigenstate, which can be regarded as a quantum many-body scar state as evidenced from the numerical analysis of the pair correlation function, entanglement entropy, and level statistics. We also discuss other examples, including spin-triplet $f$-wave pairing states on a honeycomb lattice and spin-singlet $p$-wave pairing states in a one-dimensional chain. These findings open up the possibility of realizing nonequilibrium unconventional superconductivity in a long-lived manner protected against thermalization.

Title: Proximity-induced flipped spin state in synthetic ferrimagnetic Pt/Co/Gd heterolayers
Authors: J. Brandão, P. C. Carvalho, I. P. Miranda, T. J. A. Mori, F. Béron, A. Bergman, H. M. Petrilli, A. B. Klautau, J. C. Cezar
Abstract: To develop new devices based on synthetic ferrimagnetic heterostructures, understanding the material's physical properties is pivotal. Here, the induced magnetic moment (IMM), magnetic exchange coupling, and spin textures are investigated in Pt(1 nm)/Co(1.5 nm)/Gd(1 nm) multilayers using a multiscale approach. The magnitude and direction of the IMM are interpreted in the framework of both X-ray magnetic circular dichroism and density functional theory. The IMM transferred by Co across the Gd paramagnetic thickness leads to a nontrivial flipped spin state (FSS) within the Gd layers, in which their magnetic moments couple antiparallel/parallel with the ferromagnetic Co near/far from the Co/Gd interface, respectively. The FSS depends on the magnetic field, which, on average, reduces the Gd magnetic moment as the field increases. For the Pt, in both Pt/Co and Gd/Pt interfaces, the IMM follows the same direction as the Co magnetic moment, with negligible IMM in the Gd/Pt interface. Additionally, zero-field spin spirals were imaged using scanning transmission X-ray microscopy, whereas micromagnetic simulations were employed to unfold the interactions, stabilizing the ferrimagnetic configurations, where the existence of a sizable Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction is demonstrated to be crucial.

Title: Quasispins of vacancy defects and their interactions in disordered antiferromagnets
Authors: Muhammad Sedik, Shijun Sun, Arthur P. Ramirez, Sergey Syzranov
Abstract: Vacancy defects in disordered magnetic materials are known to act as effective spins, ``quasispins'', in response to an external magnetic field. In the dilute limit, the contributions of such ``quasispins'' to the magnetic susceptibility $\chi_\text{vac}(T)\propto N_\text{vac}/T$ are singular in the limit of low temperatures $T$ and match those of free spins. With increasing the density of vacancies, their interactions may become essential. Motivated by frustrated and quasi-one-dimensional magnetic materials, we study analytically quasispins and their interactions in a generic system that has short-range antiferromagnetic order and lacks long-range order. We predict that if the vacancy defect does not disrupt the short-range antiferromagnetic order around it, the quasispin value matches the value of spins of the magnetic atoms in the material, and the correlators of the quasispins of different vacancies match the spin-spin correlators in the vacancy-free material. We confirm our conclusions by exact calculations for Ising chains with nearest-neighbour and next-to-nearest-neighbour interactions. We also compute the first virial correction to the susceptibility of a magnetic material due to the interactions of vacancy quasispins.

Title: Building Workflows for Interactive Human in the Loop Automated Experiment (hAE) in STEM-EELS
Authors: Utkarsh Pratiush, Kevin M. Roccapriore, Yongtao Liu, Gerd Duscher, Maxim Ziatdinov, Sergei V. Kalinin
Abstract: Exploring the structural, chemical, and physical properties of matter on the nano- and atomic scales has become possible with the recent advances in aberration-corrected electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). However, the current paradigm of STEM-EELS relies on the classical rectangular grid sampling, in which all surface regions are assumed to be of equal a priori interest. This is typically not the case for real-world scenarios, where phenomena of interest are concentrated in a small number of spatial locations. One of foundational problems is the discovery of nanometer- or atomic scale structures having specific signatures in EELS spectra. Here we systematically explore the hyperparameters controlling deep kernel learning (DKL) discovery workflows for STEM-EELS and identify the role of the local structural descriptors and acquisition functions on the experiment progression. In agreement with actual experiment, we observe that for certain parameter combinations the experiment path can be trapped in the local minima. We demonstrate the approaches for monitoring automated experiment in the real and feature space of the system and monitor knowledge acquisition of the DKL model. Based on these, we construct intervention strategies, thus defining human-in the loop automated experiment (hAE). This approach can be further extended to other techniques including 4D STEM and other forms of spectroscopic imaging.

Title: Designing aperiodic to periodic interfaces
Authors: Sam Coates
Abstract: Symmetry sharing facilitates coherent interfaces which can transition from periodic to aperiodic structures. Motivated by the design and construction of such systems, we present hexagonal aperiodic tilings with a single edge-length which can be considered as decorations of a periodic lattice. We introduce these tilings by modifying an existing family of golden-mean trigonal and hexagonal tilings, and discuss their properties in terms of this wider family. Then, we show how the vertices of these new systems can be considered as decorations or sublattice sets of a periodic triangular lattice, before introducing methods to designing coherent aperiodic to periodic interfaces.

Title: Chern Number Tunable Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect in Compensated Antiferromagnets
Authors: Wenhao Liang, Jiaqi An, Zeyu Li, Yafei Ren, Zhenhua Qiao, Qian Niu
Abstract: We propose to realize the quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) in two-dimensional compensated antiferromagnets without net spin magnetization.} We consider antiferromagnetic MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ as a concrete example. \textcolor{blue}{By breaking the parity-time ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetry of even-layer MnBi$_2$Te$_4$, we find that the system can host the QAHE with a nonzero Chern number.} We show that by controlling the antiferromagnetic spin configuration, for example, down/up/up/down that breaks $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry, tetralayer MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ can host a Chern number $\mathcal{C}=-1$. Such spin configuration can be stabilized by pinning the spin orientations of the surfaces. \textcolor{blue}{Furthermore, via tuning the on-site orbital energy and vertical electric fields, we find rich QAHE phases with tunable Chern number of $|\mathcal{C}|=1, 2, 3$. In addition, we reveal that the edge states are layer-selective and primarily locate at the boundaries of the bottom and top layers. Our work not only proposes a scheme to realize Chern number tunable QAHE in antiferromagnets without net spin magnetization, but also provides a platform for layer-selective dissipationless transport devices.

Title: On Nanowire Morphological Instability and Pinch-Off by Surface Electromigration
Authors: Mikhail Khenner
Abstract: Surface diffusion and surface electromigration may lead to a morphological instability of thin solid films and nanowires. In this paper two nonlinear analyses of a morphological instability are developed for a single-crystal cylindrical nanowire that is subjected to an axial current. These treatments extend the conventional linear stability analyses without surface electromigration, that manifest a Rayleigh-Plateau instability. A weakly nonlinear analysis is done slightly above the Rayleigh-Plateau (longwave) instability threshold. It results in a one-dimensional Sivashinsky amplitude equation that describes a blow-up of a surface perturbation amplitude in a finite time. This is a signature of a pinching singularity of a cylinder radius, which leads to a wire separation into a disjoint segments. The time- and electric field-dependent dimensions of the focusing self-similar amplitude profile approaching a blow-up are characterized via the scaling analysis. Also, a weakly nonlinear multi-scale analysis is done at the arbitrary distance above a longwave or a shortwave instability threshold. The time- and electric field-dependent Fourier amplitudes of the major instability modes are derived and characterized.

Title: Neural network based deep learning analysis of semiconductor quantum dot qubits for automated control
Authors: Jacob R. Taylor, Sankar Das Sarma
Abstract: Machine learning offers a largely unexplored avenue for improving noisy disordered devices in physics using automated algorithms. Through simulations that include disorder in physical devices, particularly quantum devices, there is potential to learn about disordered landscapes and subsequently tune devices based on those insights. In this work, we introduce a novel methodology that employs machine learning, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to discern the disorder landscape in the parameters of the disordered extended Hubbard model underlying the semiconductor quantum dot spin qubit architectures. This technique takes advantage of experimentally obtainable charge stability diagrams from neighboring quantum dot pairs, enabling the CNN to accurately identify disorder in each parameter of the extended Hubbard model. Remarkably, our CNN can process site-specific disorder in Hubbard parameters, including variations in hopping constants, on-site potentials (gate voltages), and both intra-site and inter-site Coulomb terms. This advancement facilitates the prediction of spatially dependent disorder across all parameters simultaneously with high accuracy ($R^2>0.994$) and fewer parameter constraints, marking a significant improvement over previous methods that were focused only on analyzing on-site potentials at low coupling. Furthermore, our approach allows for the tuning of five or more quantum dots at a time, effectively addressing the often-overlooked issue of crosstalk. Not only does our method streamline the tuning process, potentially enabling fully automated adjustments, but it also introduces a "no trust" verification method to rigorously validate the neural network's predictions. Ultimately, this work aims to lay the groundwork for generalizing our method to tackle a broad spectrum of physical problems.

Title: Diffusion of valley-coherent dark excitons in a high-angle incommensurate Moir\'e homobilayer
Authors: Arnab Barman Ray, Trevor Ollis, Sethuraj K. R., Anthony Nickolas Vamivakas
Abstract: The last few years have witnessed a surge in interest and research efforts in the field of twistronics, especially in low-angle twisted bilayers of transition metal dichalocogenides. These novel material platforms have been demonstrated to host periodic arrays of excitonic quantum emitters, interlayer excitons with long lifetimes, and exotic many-body states. While much remains to be known and understood about these heterostructures, the field of large-angle, incommensurate bilayers is even less explored. At twist angles larger than a few degrees, the presence of periodicity in these bilayers becomes chaotic, making the systems essentially aperiodic and incommensurate in nature due to the limitations of fabrication techniques. In this work, we demonstrate the emergence of a brightened dark intralayer exciton in twisted n-doped molybdenum diselenide homobilayer. We show that this dark exciton diffuses across the excitation spot more efficiently as compared to bright trions or excitons, reaching diffusion lengths greater than 4 microns. Temperature-dependent spectra provide corroborative evidence and reveal a brightened dark trion. Almost inexplicably, this dark exciton showcases a robust valley coherence, which we attribute to a small mixing of the spin-resolved conduction bands due to an absence of out-of-plane reflection symmetry arising from a strong dielectric contrast. Our results reveal some of the richness of the physics of these large-angle systems while uncovering new opportunities for valleytronic devices that may utilize these more valley-robust "mixed" dark excitons.

Title: Signatures of spinon dynamics and phase structure of dipolar-octupolar quantum spin ices in two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy
Authors: Mark Potts, Roderich Moessner, Owen Benton
Abstract: We study how sharp signatures of fractionalization emerge in nonlinear spectroscopy experiments on spin liquids with separated energy scales. Our model is that of dipolar-octupolar rare earth pyrochlore materials, prime candidates for realising quantum spin ice. This family of three dimensional quantum spin liquids exhibits fractionalization of spin degrees of freedom into spinons charged under an emergent $U(1)$ gauge field. We show that the technique of two dimensional coherent spectroscopy (2DCS) can identify clear signatures of fractionalised spinon dynamics in dipolar-octupolar quantum spin ices. However, at intermediate temperatures, spinon dynamics are heavily constrained in the presence of an incoherent spin background, leading to a broad 2DCS response. At lower temperatures, a sharp signal emerges as the system enters a coherent spin liquid state. This lower temperature signal can in turn distinguish between zero-flux and $\pi$-flux forms of quantum spin ice.

Title: Brightened emission of dark trions in transition-metal dichalcogenide monolayers

Abstract: The optical emission spectra of semiconducting transition-metal dichalcogenide monolayers highlight fascinating recombination processes of charged excitons (trions). When charge tunable WSe$_2$ monolayers are moderately doped with electrons, a strong luminescence peak emerges just below the well-understood spectral lines associated with the recombination of negatively charged bright and dark trions. Despite previous investigations, its origin remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate that this luminescence peak is the result of electron-electron assisted recombination that brightens the dark trion emission. Supporting evidence for this second-order recombination process comes from identifying the brightened emission of positively charged dark trions when the monolayer is electrostatically doped with holes. Remarkably, the discovered hole-hole assisted luminescence peak emerges in the near infrared, about 500 meV below the well-studied spectral region of excitons and trions. In magneto-photoluminescence experiments we find that the $g$-factor of this new transition ($g$ = +4) has an opposite sign compared to the well-known $g$-factor of neutral or charged excitons. This allows us to propose a mechanism of brightening of the positively charged dark trion involving the $\Gamma$ valence band.

Title: Ensemble Inequivalence in Ising Chains with Competing Interactions
Authors: Alessandro Campa, Vahan Hovhannisyan, Stefano Ruffo, Andrea Trombettoni
Abstract: We study the effect of competing interactions on ensemble inequivalence. We consider a one-dimensional Ising model with ferromagnetic mean-field interactions and short-range nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor couplings which can be either ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic. Despite the relative simplicity of the model, our calculations in the microcanonical ensemble reveal a rich phase diagram. The comparison with the corresponding phase diagram in the canonical ensemble shows the presence of phase transition points and lines which are different in the two ensembles. As an example, in a region of the phase diagram where the canonical ensemble shows a critical point and a critical end point, the microcanonical ensemble has an additional critical point and also a triple point. The regions of ensemble inequivalence typically occur at lower temperatures and at larger absolute values of the competing couplings. The presence of two free parameters in the model allows us to obtain a fourth-order critical point, which can be fully characterized by deriving its Landau normal form.

Title: High-temperature threshold of damage of SiC by swift heavy ions
Authors: D.I. Zainutdinov, V.A. Borodin, S.A. Gorbunov, N. Medvedev, R.A. Rymzhanov, M.V. Sorokin, R.A. Voronkov, A.E. Volkov
Abstract: At ambient conditions, SiC is known to be resistant to irradiation with swift heavy ions (SHI) decelerating in the electronic stopping regime. However, there is no experimental data on the SiC irradiation at elevated temperatures. To investigate this problem, we evaluate the stability of SiC to SHI impacts at high temperatures up to 2200 K. We apply the combination of the Monte-Carlo code TREKIS-3, describing excitation of the electronic and atomic systems using temperature-dependent scattering cross-sections, with molecular-dynamic modeling of the lattice response to the excitation. We demonstrate that increasing irradiation temperature increases the energy transferred to the atomic lattice from the excited electronic system. This material heating leads to formation of a stable nanometric damaged core along the trajectory of 710 MeV Bi ion when the irradiation temperature overcomes the threshold of ~1800 K. In this case, a chain of nanometric voids along the ion trajectory forms due to the mass transport from the track core by edge dislocations. Voids of larger sizes appear at higher irradiation temperatures. At lower irradiation temperatures, the damaged regions recrystallize completely within ~100 ps after the ion passage.

Title: Efficient Modelling of Anharmonicity and Quantum Effects in PdCuH$_2$ with Machine Learning Potentials
Authors: Francesco Belli, Eva Zurek
Abstract: Quantum nuclear effects and anharmonicity impact a wide range of functional materials and their properties. One of the most powerful techniques to model these effects is the Stochastic Self-Consistent Harmonic Approximation (SSCHA). Unfortunately, the SSCHA is extremely computationally expensive, prohibiting its routine use. We propose a protocol that pairs machine learning interatomic potentials, which can be tailored for the system at hand via active learning, with the SSCHA. Our method leverages an upscaling procedure that allows for the treatment of supercells of up to thousands of atoms with practically minimal computational effort. The protocol is applied to PdCuH$_x$ ($x = 0-2$) compounds, chosen because previous experimental studies have reported superconducting critical temperatures, $T_\text{c}$s, as high as 17~K at ambient pressures in an unknown hydrogenated PdCu phase. We identify a $P4/mmm$ PdCuH$_2$ structure, which is shown to be dynamically stable only upon the inclusion of quantum fluctuations, as being a key contributor to the measured superconductivity. For this system, our methodology is able to reduce the computational expense for the SSCHA calculations by $\sim$96\%. The proposed protocol opens the door towards the routine inclusion of quantum nuclear motion and anharmonicity in materials discovery.

Title: Constraints on the orbital flux phase in $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ from polar Kerr effect
Authors: Hao-Tian Liu, Junkang Huang, Tao Zhou, Wen Huang
Abstract: The $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A=$ K, Rb, Cs) family of Kagome metals hosts unconventional charge density wave order whose nature is still an open puzzle. Accumulated evidences point to a time-reversal symmetry breaking orbital flux phase that carries loop currents. Such an order may support anomalous Hall effect. However, the polar Kerr effect measurements that probe the a.c. anomalous Hall conductivity seems to have yielded contradictory results. We first argue on symmetry grounds that some previously proposed orbital flux order, most notably the one with Star-of-David distortion, shall not give rise to anomalous Hall or polar Kerr effects. We further take the tri-hexagonal orbital flux phase as an exemplary Kagome flux order that does exhibit anomalous Hall response, and show that the Kerr rotation angle at two relevant experimental optical frequencies generally reaches microradians to sub-milliradians levels. A particularly sharp resonance enhancement is observed at around $\hbar \omega =1$ eV, suggesting exceedingly large Kerr rotation at the corresponding probing frequencies not yet accessed by previous experiments. Our study can help to interpret the Kerr measurements on $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ and to eventually resolve the nature of their CDW order.

Title: Additively manufacturable high-strength aluminum alloys with thermally stable microstructures enabled by hybrid machine learning-based design
Authors: S. Mohadeseh Taheri-Mousavi, Michael Xu, Florian Hengsbach, Clay Houser, Zhaoxuan Ge, Benjamin Glaser, Shaolou Wei, Mikro Schaper, James M. LeBeau, Greg B. Olson, A. John Hart
Abstract: Additively manufactured (AM) aluminum alloys with high strength and thermal stability have broad applications in turbine engines, vacuum pumps, heat exchangers, and many other industrial systems. Employing precipitates with an L1$_2$ structure to block dislocation motions is a widespread strategy to strengthen aluminum. However, to achieve high strength, a high volume fraction of small precipitates is required, and these characteristics are generally mutually exclusive. Here, we show that for certain compositions of Al alloys, L1$_2$ phases initially precipitate as sub-micron metastable ternary phases under the rapid solidification conditions of powder bed AM, yet the subsequent L1$_2$ phases that precipitate during heat treatment of the sample remain at the nanoscale, imparting high strength. For strength to be retained at elevated temperature, these nanoprecipitates must have low coarsening rates. To inversely design the composition of an alloy to have these target microstructural features, we used hybrid calculation of phase diagram (CALPHAD)-based integrated computational materials engineering (ICME) and Bayesian optimization techniques. We tested our approach by designing an Al-Er-Zr-Y-Yb-Ni model alloy, and the selected composition was manufactured in powder form as AM feedstock. The strength of specimens manufactured via laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) from the designed composition is comparable to that of wrought Al 7075, yet without cracking that occurs upon LPBF of Al 7075. After high-temperature (400$^\circ$C) aging the designed alloy is 50% stronger than the strongest known benchmark printable Al alloy.

Title: Orientation reconstruction of transformation $\alpha$ titanium alloys via polarized light microscopy: methodology and assessment
Authors: Amit Singh, Mark Obstalecki, Darren C. Pagan, Michael Glavicic, Matthew Kasemer
Abstract: Emerging microstructural characterization methods have received increased attention owing to their promise of relatively inexpensive and rapid measurement of polycrystalline surface morphology and crystallographic orientations. Among these nascent methods, polarized light microscopy (PLM) is attractive for characterizing alloys comprised of hexagonal crystals, but is hindered by its inability to measure complete crystal orientations. In this study, we explore the potential to reconstruct quasi-deterministic orientations for titanium microstructures characterized via PLM by considering the Burgers orientation relationship between the room temperature $\alpha$ (HCP) phase fibers measured via PLM, and the $\beta$ (BCC) phase orientations of the parent grains present above the transus temperature. We describe this method -- which is capable of narrowing down the orientations to one of four possibilities -- and demonstrate its abilities on idealized computational samples in which the parent $\beta$ microstructure is fully, unambiguously known. We further utilize this method to inform the instantiation of samples for crystal plasticity simulations, and demonstrate the significant improvement in deformation field predictions when utilizing this reconstruction method compared to using results from traditional PLM.

Title: Scaling up a sign-ordered Kitaev chain without magnetic flux control
Authors: Chun-Xiao Liu, Sebastian Miles, Alberto Bordin, Sebastiaan L. D. ten Haaf, Grzegorz P. Mazur, A. Mert Bozkurt, Michael Wimmer
Abstract: Quantum dot-superconductor arrays have emerged as a new and promising material platform for realizing topological Kitaev chains. So far, experiments have implemented a two-site chain with limited protection. Here we propose an experimentally feasible protocol for scaling up the chain in order to enhance the protection of the Majorana zero modes. To this end, we make use of the fact that the relative sign of normal and superconducting hoppings mediated by an Andreev bound state can be changed by electrostatic gates. In this way, our method only relies on the use of individual electrostatic gates on hybrid regions, quantum dots, and tunnel barriers, respectively, without the need for individual magnetic flux control, greatly simplifying the device design. Our work provides guidance for realizing a topologically protected Kitaev chain, which is the building block of error-resilient topological quantum computation.

Title: Probing a quantum spin liquid with equilibrium and nonequilibrium hole dynamics
Authors: J. H. Nyhegn, K. Knakkergaard Nielsen, G. M. Bruun
Abstract: The properties and experimental identification of quantum spin liquids (QSLs) remain an important topic with many fundamental questions. Here, we explore the dynamics of a single charge dopant (hole) in a $t$-$J_{1}$-$J_{2}$ model on a square lattice, which realizes a gapless $\mathbb{Z}_2$ QSL at half filling. Using a field theory approach based on the parton construction, which includes an infinite number of scatterings between the low-energy quasiparticle excitations of the QSL via a self-consistent Born approximation, we calculate both the equilibrium and nonequilibrium properties of the hole for weak and strong interactions. Quasiparticle branches as well as stringlike excitations of the holon are identified, and we furthermore explore the time-dependent spreading of a hole throughout the QSL after it has been injected at a given lattice site. The final ballistic expansion speed is shown to exhibit a nonmonotonic behavior as a quantum phase transition between an antiferromagnetic and the QSL phase is crossed, which is caused by a qualitative change in the fundamental kinematics of the interactions between the hole and the surrounding spins. Our results demonstrate how charge dopants can be used as a quantum probe for QSLs and are directly relevant to optical lattice experiments with single site resolution.

Title: Confinement-induced Majorana modes in a nodal topological superconductor
Authors: Simone Traverso, Niccolò Traverso Ziani, Maura Sassetti, Fernando Dominguez
Abstract: We investigate the topological phase diagram of an extension of the Haldane model with equal spin pairing superconductivity. In two dimensions, we find a topological nodal superconducting phase, which exhibits a chiral Majorana mode propagating along the edges of nanoribbons with cylindrical boundary conditions. This phase is however unstable in a finite two-dimensional rectangular-shaped lattice, yielding corner states close to zero energy in a flake with alternating zigzag and armchair edges. When we reduce one of the dimensions, quantum confinement gaps out the bulk bands faster than the edge states. In this scenario, hybridization between the edge states can then result in Majorana zero modes. Our results hence suggest quantum confinement as a crucial ingredient in building quasi-one-dimensional topological superconducting phases out of two-dimensional nodal topological superconductors. Furthermore, we characterize the emergence of this novel topological phase by means of its topological invariant, coinciding with a quantized conductance of $2 e^2/h$ in a normal-superconducting junction.

Title: A Very Effective and Simple Diffusion Reconstruction for the Diluted Ising Model
Authors: Stefano Bae, Enzo Marinari, Federico Ricci-Tersenghi
Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models are machine learning models that use diffusion processes to learn the probability distribution of high-dimensional data. In recent years, they have become extremely successful in generating multimedia content. However, it is still unknown if such models can be used to generate high-quality datasets of physical models. In this work, we use a Landau-Ginzburg-like diffusion model to infer the distribution of a $2D$ bond-diluted Ising model. Our approach is simple and effective, and we show that the generated samples reproduce correctly the statistical and critical properties of the physical model.

Title: Improved models for ideal Fermi gas and ideal Bose gas using quantum phase space
Authors: Rivo Herivola Manjakamanana Ravelonjato, Ravo Tokiniaina Ranaivoson, Raoelina Andriambololona, Roland Raboanary, Naivo Rabesiranana, Solofoarisina Wilfrid Chrysante
Abstract: In this work, improvements are introduced into the current models of the ideal Fermi gas and the ideal Bose gas by incorporating the quantum nature of phase space, directly linked to the uncertainty principle. These improved models leverage the recently developed concepts of quantum phase space and phase space representation of quantum mechanics. The Hamiltonian operator for a gas particle and its eigenstates are first determined, and quantum statistical mechanics is used to derive the thermodynamic properties of the ideal gas.  Analytic expressions for thermodynamic quantities - including the grand canonical potential, particle number, internal energy, Von Neumann entropy, and pressure are derived, alongside the corresponding thermodynamic equations of state for both bosons and fermions. These corrections are particularly significant at low temperatures and in confined volumes, where quantum effects such as shape and size become prominent. The results also establish a direct link between thermodynamic functions and the quantum statistical variances of momenta.  Importantly, the improved models recover well-known classical relations of the ideal gas in the high-temperature and large-volume limits, ensuring consistency with classical physics. By addressing quantum corrections and their thermodynamic implications, this work provides a foundation for further applications in nanoscale systems, quantum gases, low-temperature physics, utra-cold physics and astrophysics.

Title: Induction of non-Fermi liquids by critical cavity photons at the onset of superradiance
Authors: Ipsita Mandal
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of a non-Fermi liquid (NFL) at a putative quantum critical point signalling the onset of superradiance, in a set-up involving cavity quantum electrodynamics. Although the finiteness of the cavity, being bounded by reflecting mirrors, endows the cavity photons with an effective mass, they become massless at the continuous phase-transition point. We consider the matter part coming from the fermions hopping on a honeycomb lattice near half-filling, featuring doped Dirac cones at two sets of inequivalent valleys. This choice is dictated by the presence of a fermion-boson interaction vertex, which can give rise to Landau damping of the critical bosons, eventually leading to an NFL phase for the fermions. To set up the quantum effective action, we identify the hot-spots of the generically anisotropic (trigonally-warped) Fermi surfaces, which give the sets of points having parallel/antiparallel tangent vectors. The cavity photons act as charge density wave (CDW) order parameters, connecting pairs of hot-spots belonging to the Fermi surface of a single valley. With these ingredients, we set upon identifying NFL phases, using the tools of dimensional regularization and renormalization-group-flow equations. Our final results indicate that stable NFL phases exist in the low-energy limit, for the projections of the flows along the CDW coupling constant.

Title: Exact formula with two dynamically screened electron-phonon couplings for positive phonon-linewidths approximations
Authors: Gianluca Stefanucci, Enrico Perfetto
Abstract: In this paper, we present an exact formula for the phonon linewidths involving only dressed electron-phonon couplings and ensuring the positivity property. The formula is designed to account for both nonadiabatic and correlation effects, and it provides an alternative proof that Density Functional Perturbation Theory calculations of phonon linewidths are not affected by a double counting of screening diagrams. Furthermore, we extend the treatment to nonequilibrium scenarios and offer a rigorous justification for employing the phononic Boltzmann equation.

Title: Non-monotonic constitutive curves and shear banding in dry and wet granular flows
Authors: Christopher Ness, Suzanne M. Fielding
Abstract: We use particle simulations to map comprehensively the shear rheology of dry and wet granular matter comprising particles of finite stiffness, in both fixed pressure and fixed volume protocols. At fixed pressure we find non-monotonic constitutive curves that are shear thinning, whereas at fixed volume we find non-monotonic constitutive curves that are shear thickening. We show that the presence of one non-monotonicity does not imply the other. Instead, there exists a signature in the volume fraction measured under fixed pressure that, when present, ensures non-monotonic constitutive curves at fixed volume. In the context of dry granular flow we show that gradient and vorticity bands arise under fixed pressure and volume respectively, as implied by the constitutive curves. For wet systems our results are consistent with a recent experimental observation of shear thinning at fixed pressure. We furthermore predict discontinuous shear thickening in the absence of critical load friction.

Title: Quantum-metric-induced giant and reversible nonreciprocal transport phenomena in chiral loop-current phases of kagome metals
Authors: Rina Tazai, Youichi Yamakawa, Takahiro Morimoto, Hiroshi Kontani
Abstract: Rich spontaneous symmetry-breaking phenomena with nontrivial quantum geometric properties in metals represent central issues in condensed matter physics. In this context, the emergence of chiral loop-current order, accompanied by time-reversal symmetry-symmetry breaking in various kagome metals, has garnered significant attention. Particularly noteworthy is the giant electrical magnetochiral anisotropy (eMChA) in CsV3Sb5, which provides compelling evidence of time-reversal-symmetry and inversion-symmetry breakings. However, the underlying essence of this observation has remained obscured due to the lack of theoretical understanding. Here, we reveal that the loop-current order causes giant and reversible eMChA coefficient, $\gamma_{eM}$, is proportional to the loop-current-induced orbital magnetization $M_{orb}$ times the lifetime of conduction electrons $\tau$. In kagome metals, the derived $\gamma_{eM}$ is substantial and reversible by minute magnetic fields, due to the large $\tau (\gg a_0/v_{Fermi})$ and the field-induced reversal of $M_{orb}$. By considering the experimentally observed stripe charge-density wave, the loop-current state becomes non-centrosymmetric, thereby giving rise to the eMChA. Surprisingly, the quantum-metric, which defines a fundamental geometric aspect of Bloch wavefunctions, acquires significant momentum dependence in the loop-current phase, resulting in a dramatic enhancement of eMChA by $\sim100$ times. This research not only clarifies the fundamental symmetry-breaking states in kagome metals, but also opens a new path for exploring quantum-metric-induced phenomena arising from exotic quantum phase transitions in strongly correlated metals

Title: Shear banding as a cause of non-monotonic stress relaxation after flow cessation
Authors: Vanessa K. Ward, Suzanne M. Fielding
Abstract: Recent flow cessation experiments on soft materials have shown a counter-intuitive non-monotonic relaxation of the shear stress: following the switch-off of a steady imposed shear flow, the stress initially decays before later increasing again. By simulating the soft glassy rheology model in a form extended to allow steady state shear banding, we show that the presence of shear bands prior to flow cessation can give rise to this phenomenon. We give a mechanistic understanding of the basic physics involved, in terms of (i) the decay of the shear bands after flow cessation, and (ii) the evolution of frustrated local stresses, governed by different time scales for plastic relaxation in each band. In particular, an elastic recoil in the unsheared band gives rise to negative local frustrated stresses, the slow release of which can cause an increase in macroscopic stress. Given that shear banding and frustrated local stresses arise widely across disordered soft solids, we argue that non-monotonic stress relaxation after flow cessation may occur in many different materials.

Title: Unexpected Effects of Disorder on Current Fluctuations in the Symmetric Simple Exclusion Process
Authors: Issei Sakai, Takuma Akimoto
Abstract: We explore how the disorder impacts the current fluctuations in the symmetric simple exclusion process (SSEP) within a heterogeneous environment. First, we analyze the SSEP with a defect site under the periodic boundary conditions. We derive the exact expression for the second moment of the current and observe deviations from that of the homogeneous system. Notably, the second moment of the current shows asymmetric density dependence around a density of 1/2 and surpassing that of the homogeneous system in the low-density region. Furthermore, based on the finding from the SSEP with a defect site, we present an approximate derivation of the second moment of the current in the SSEP on a quenched random energy landscape using a partial-mean-field approach. The second moment of the current is heavily influenced by the energy landscape, revealing unique effects arising from the interplay between the heterogeneous environment and the many-body system. Our findings provide valuable insights that can be applied to control current fluctuations in systems involving the interactions of many particles, such as biological transport.

Title: Unusual energy spectra of matrix product states
Authors: J. Maxwell Silvester, Giuseppe Carleo, Steven R. White
Abstract: In approximate ground states obtained from imaginary-time evolution, the spectrum of the state -- its decomposition into exact energy eigenstates -- falls off exponentially with the energy. Here we consider the energy spectra of approximate matrix product ground states, such as those obtained with the density matrix renormalization group. Despite the high accuracy of these states, contributions to the spectra are roughly constant out to surprisingly high energy, with an increase in the bond dimension reducing the amplitude but not the extent of these high-energy tails. The unusual spectra appear to be a general feature of compressed wavefunctions, independent of boundary or dimensionality, and are also observed in neural network wavefunctions. The unusual spectra can have a strong effect on sampling-based methods, yielding large fluctuations. The energy variance, which can be used to extrapolate observables to eliminate truncation error, is subject to these large fluctuations when sampled. Nevertheless, we devise a sampling-based variance approach which gives excellent and efficient extrapolations.

Title: Superconducting flip-chip devices using indium microspheres on Au-passivated Nb or NbN as under-bump metallization layer
Authors: Achintya Paradkar, Paul Nicaise, Karim Dakroury, Fabian Resare, Witlef Wieczorek
Abstract: Superconducting flip-chip interconnects are crucial for the three-dimensional integration of superconducting circuits in sensing and quantum technology applications. We demonstrate a simplified approach for a superconducting flip-chip device using commercially available indium microspheres and an in-house-built transfer stage for bonding two chips patterned with superconducting thin films. We use a gold-passivated niobium or niobium nitride layer as an under-bump metallization (UBM) layer between an aluminum-based superconducting wiring layer and the indium interconnect. At millikelvin temperatures, our flip-chip assembly can transport a supercurrent with tens of milliamperes, limited by the smallest geometric feature size and critical current density of the UBM layer and not by the indium interconnect. We show that the pressed indium interconnect itself can carry a supercurrent exceeding 1A due to its large size of about 500 micrometer diameter. Our flip-chip assembly does not require electroplating nor patterning of indium. The assembly process does not need a flip-chip bonder and can be realized with a transfer stage using a top chip with transparency or through-vias for alignment. These flip-chip devices can be utilized in applications that require few superconducting interconnects carrying large currents at millikelvin temperatures.

Title: First part of Clausius heat theorem in terms of Noether's theorem
Authors: Aaron Beyen, Christian Maes
Abstract: After Helmholtz, the mechanical foundation of thermodynamics included the First Law $d E = \delta Q + \delta W$, and the first part of the Clausius heat theorem $\delta Q^\text{rev}/T = dS$. The resulting invariance of the entropy $S$ for quasistatic changes in thermally isolated systems invites a connection with Noether's theorem (only established later). In this quest, we continue an idea, first brought up by Wald in black hole thermodynamics and by Sasa $\textit{et al.}$ in various contexts. We follow both Lagrangian and Hamiltonian frameworks, and emphasize the role of Killing equations for deriving a First Law for thermodynamically consistent trajectories, to end up with an expression of ``heat over temperature'' as an exact differential of a Noether charge.

Title: Periodic source of energy-entangled electrons in helical states coupled to a BCS superconductor
Authors: Flavio Ronetti, Bruno Bertin-Johannet, Jérôme Rech, Thibaut Jonckheere, Benoît Grémaud, Laurent Raymond, Thierry Martin
Abstract: We propose a source of purely electronic energy-entangled states implemented in a solid-state system with potential applications in quantum information protocols based on electron flying qubits. The proposed device relies on the standard tools of Electron Quantum Optics (EQO) and exploits entanglement of the Cooper pairs of a BCS superconductor. The latter is coupled via an adjustable quantum point contact to two opposite spin polarized electron wave-guides, which are driven by trains of Lorentzian pulses. This specific choice for the drive is crucial to inject purely electronic entangled-states devoid of spurious electron-hole pairs. In the Andreev regime, a perturbative calculation in the tunnel coupling confirms that entangled electrons states (EES) are generated at the output of the normal side. We introduce a quantity related to charge current cross-correlations which allows one to verify experimentally the entangled nature of the emitted state.

Title: Twin branching in shape memory alloys: a 1D model with energy dissipation effects
Authors: Stanislaw Stupkiewicz, Seyedshoja Amini, Mohsen Rezaee-Hajidehi
Abstract: We develop a 1D model of twin branching in shape memory alloys. The free energy of the branched microstructure comprises the interfacial and elastic strain energy contributions, both expressed in terms of the average twin spacing treated as a continuous function of the position. The total free energy is then minimized, and the corresponding Euler-Lagrange equation is solved numerically using the finite element method. The model can be considered as a continuous counterpart of the recent discrete model of Seiner et al. (2020), and our results show a very good agreement with that model in the entire range of physically relevant parameters. Furthermore, our continuous setting facilitates incorporation of energy dissipation into the model. The effect of rate-independent dissipation on the evolution of the branched microstructure is thus studied. The results show that significant effects on the microstructure and energy of the system are expected only for relatively small domain sizes.

Title: Spinon spin current
Authors: Ren-Bo Wang, Naveen Nishad, Anna Keselman, Leon Balents, Oleg A. Starykh
Abstract: We present the theory of the longitudinal spin Seebeck effect between a Heisenberg spin-1/2 chain and a conductor. The effect consists of the generation of a spin current across the spin chain-conductor interface in response to the temperature difference between the two systems. In this setup, the current is given by the convolution of the local spin susceptibilities of the spin chain and the conductor. We find the spin current to be fully controlled, both in the magnitude and the sign, by the backscattering interaction between spinons, fractionalized spin excitations of the Heisenberg chain. In particular, it vanishes when the spinons form a non-interacting spinon gas. Our analytical results for the local spin susceptibility at the open end of the spin chain are in excellent agreement with numerical DMRG simulations.

Title: Decomposition of metric tensor in thermodynamic geometry in terms of relaxation timescales
Authors: Zhen Li, Yuki Izumida
Abstract: Geometrical methods are extensively applied to thermodynamics including stochastic thermodynamics. In the case of slow-driving linear response regime, a geometrical framework, known as thermodynamic geometry, is established. The key of this framework is the thermodynamic length characterized by a metric tensor defined on the space of controlling variables. As the metric tensor is given in terms of the equilibrium time-correlation functions of the thermodynamic forces, it contains the information of timescales, which may be useful for analyzing the performance of heat engines. In this paper, we show that the metric tensor for underdamped Langevin dynamics can be decomposed in terms of the relaxation times of a system itself, which govern the timescales of the equilibrium time-correlation functions of the thermodynamic forces. As an application of the decomposition of the metric tensor, we demonstrate that it is possible to achieve Carnot efficiency at finite power by taking the vanishing limit of relaxation times without breaking trade-off relations between efficiency and power of heat engines in terms of thermodynamic geometry.

Title: Diffusion of a single colloid on the surface of a giant vesicle and a droplet
Authors: Clément Marque, Gaetano D'Avino, Domenico Larobina, Aude Michel, Ali Abou-Hassan, Antonio Stocco
Abstract: The study of interactions between biomimetic membranes and micron-sized particles is crucial for understanding various biological processes. Here, we control microparticle spontaneous engulfment by giant lipid vesicles by tuning particle surface charge, exploring regimes from negligible to strong adhesion. We focus our attention on dissipative phenomena at the micron- and nano- scales, occurring when a particle is wrapped by a lipid vesicle bilayer or when the particle diffuses at the lipid-monolayer interface of a droplet. For particles wrapped by membrane bilayers, we highlight the influence of the particle penetration depth and the impact of substructures on particle friction. Our work is complemented by hydrodynamic simulations that take into account the effects of the shape of the membrane wrapping the particle and the water gap separating the lipid bilayer membrane from the particle on translational particle drag. We show, however, that a purely hydrodynamic model is not suitable to describe the friction of a particle diffusing at the interface of an aqueous microdroplet in oil, stabilized by a single lipid layer. In hydrodynamic models, dissipation is solely described by the surface shear viscosity of the interface and the bulk fluid viscosity, but in this partial wetting configuration, an additional source of dissipation is required to account for fluctuations at the contact line. Hence, through experimental and numerical studies, we demonstrate that the dissipation contributions for the two geometries are fundamentally different.

Title: Tuning competition between charge order and superconductivity in the square-lattice $t$-$t'$-$J$ model
Authors: Xin Lu, Huaiming Guo, Wei-Qiang Chen, D. N. Sheng, Shou-Shu Gong
Abstract: Recently, a flurry of works have found strong competition between charge density wave (CDW) and superconductivity (SC) in the doped Hubbard and $t$-$J$ models on the square lattice. Interestingly, some recent results suggest that the electron-phonon coupling may suppress CDW order and enhance SC. In this work, we consider the square-lattice Hubbard model with the Holstein or Su-Schrieffer-Heeger electron-phonon coupling at the large-$U$ and antiadiabatic (infinite phonon frequency) limit, which gives an effective $t$-$J$ model with either a density attractive interaction $V$ or a $J_P$ term that contributes a larger spin exchange and a density repulsive interaction. To explore how these effective couplings may suppress CDW and give a SC, we implement the density matrix renormalization group simulation on the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model with $V$ or $J_P$ coupling. We focus on the {\it six-leg} cylinder system with the next-nearest-neighbor hopping $t'$, which hosts partially filled stripe and $d$-wave SC in phase diagram. By tuning $t'/t > 0$ and $V$ or $J_P$, we establish two quantum phase diagrams. In the SC phases, the increased $V$ or $J_P$ coupling can enhance the quasi-long-range SC order, consistent with some previous findings. Nonetheless, no SC emerges when the partially filled stripe phase disappears with increased $V$ or $J_P$. Instead, the system has a transition to either a phase-separation-like regime or a filled stripe phase. On the other hand, with increased $t'/t$, not only the partially filled stripe but the phase separation and filled stripe can also be tuned to SC phase. Our results suggest that although $V$ and $J_P$ couplings may strengthen hole binding, the hole dynamics controlled by $t'/t$ appears to play more crucial role for obtaining a SC in $t$-$J$ model.

Title: Revealing the phonon bottleneck limit in negatively charged CdS quantum dots
Authors: Skylar J. Sherman, Bokang Hou, Matthew J. Coley-O'Rourke, Katherine E. Shulenberger, Lauren Pellows, Eran Rabani, Gordana Dukovic
Abstract: The capture of photoexcited hot electrons in semiconductors before they lose their excess energy to cooling is a long-standing goal in photon energy conversion. Semiconductor nanocrystals have large electron energy spacings that are expected to slow down electron relaxation by phonon emission, but hot electrons in photoexcited nanocrystals nevertheless cool rapidly by energy transfer to holes. This makes the intrinsic phonon-bottleneck limited electron lifetime in nanocrystals elusive. We used a combination of theory and experiments to probe the hot electron dynamics of negatively charged Cadmium Sulfide (CdS) colloidal quantum dots (QDs) in the absence of holes. Experiments found that these hot electrons cooled on a 100 ps timescale. Theoretical simulations predicted that pure phonon-bottleneck limited electron cooling occurs on a similar timescale. This similarity suggests that the experimental measurements reflect the upper limit on hot electron lifetimes in these CdS QDs and the lower limit on the rates of processes that can harvest those hot electrons.

Title: Correlation between unconventional superconductivity and strange metallicity revealed by operando superfluid density measurements
Authors: Ruozhou Zhang, Mingyang Qin, Chenyuan Li, Zhanyi Zhao, Zhongxu Wei, Juan Xu, Xingyu Jiang, Wenxin Cheng, Qiuyan Shi, Xuewei Wang, Jie Yuan, Yangmu Li, Qihong Chen, Tao Xiang, Subir Sachdev, Zi-Xiang Li, Kui Jin, Zhongxian Zhao
Abstract: Strange-metal behavior has been observed in superconductors ranging from cuprates to pressurized nickelates, but its relationship to unconventional superconductivity remains elusive. Here, we perform operando superfluid density measurements on ion-gated FeSe films. We observe for the first time a synchronized evolution of superconducting condensate and the strange-metal phase with electron doping. A linear scaling between zero-temperature superfluid density and the strange-metal resistivity coefficient is further established, which nails down a direct link between the formation of superfluid in the superconducting state and the scattering of carriers in the strange-metal normal state. Remarkably, the scaling also applies for different iron-based and cuprate superconductors despite their distinct electronic structures and pairing symmetries. Such a correlation can be reproduced in a theoretical calculation on the two-dimensional Yukawa-Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model by considering a cooperative effect of quantum critical fluctuation and disorder. These findings indicate a fundamental principle governing superconducting condensation and strange-metal scattering in unconventional superconductors.

Title: Ionic association and Wien effect in 2D confined electrolytes
Authors: Damien Toquer, Lydéric Bocquet, Paul Robin
Abstract: Recent experimental advances in nanofluidics have allowed to explore ion transport across molecular-scale pores, in particular for iontronic applications. Two dimensional nanochannels -- in which a single molecular layer of electrolyte is confined between solid walls -- constitute a unique platform to investigate fluid and ion transport in extreme confinement, highlighting unconventional transport properties. In this work, we study ionic association in 2D nanochannels, and its consequences on non-linear ionic transport, using both molecular dynamics simulations and analytical theory. We show that under sufficient confinement, ions assemble into pairs or larger clusters in a process analogous to a Kosterlitz-Thouless transition, here modified by the dielectric confinement. We further show that the breaking of pairs results in an electric-field dependent conduction, a mechanism usually known as the second Wien effect. However the 2D nature of the system results in non-universal, temperature-dependent, scaling of the conductivity with electric field, leading to ionic coulomb blockade in some regimes. A 2D generalization of the Onsager theory fully accounts for the non-linear transport. These results suggest ways to exploit electrostatic interactions between ions to build new nanofluidic devices.

Title: Performance of Domain-Wall Encoding in Digital Ising Machine
Authors: Shuta Kikuchi, Kotaro Takahashi, Shu Tanaka
Abstract: To tackle combinatorial optimization problems using an Ising machine, the objective function and constraints must be mapped onto a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) model. While QUBO involves binary variables, combinatorial optimization problems frequently include integer variables, which require encoding by binary variables. This process, known as binary-integer encoding, includes various methods, one of which is domain-wall encoding - a recently proposed approach. Experiments on a quantum annealing machine have demonstrated that domain-wall encoding outperforms the commonly used one-hot encoding in terms of objective function value and the probability of obtaining the optimal solution. In a digital Ising machine, domain-wall encoding required less computation time to reach optimal solutions compared to one-hot encoding. However, its practical effectiveness in digital Ising machines remains unclear. To address this uncertainty, the performance of one-hot and domain-wall encoding methods was evaluated on a digital Ising machine using the quadratic knapsack problem (QKP). The comparison focused on the dependency of penalty coefficient and sensitivity to computation time. Domain-wall encoding demonstrated a higher feasible solution rate when relative penalty coefficients for the two constraint terms were adjusted, a strategy not commonly used in previous studies. Additionally, domain-wall encoding obtained higher performance practical evaluation metrics for QKPs with large knapsack capacities compared to one-hot encoding. Furthermore, it was observed to be more sensitive to computation time than one-hot encoding.

Title: Entropy, entanglement and susceptibility of three qubits near quantum criticality
Authors: Bastian Castorene, Francisco J. Peña, Ariel Norambuena, Sergio E. Ulloa, Cristobal Araya, Patricio Vargas
Abstract: This work investigates a system of three entangled qubits within the XXX model, subjected to an external magnetic field in the $z$-direction and incorporating an anisotropy term along the $y$-axis. We explore the thermodynamics of the system by calculating its magnetic susceptibility and analyzing how this quantity encodes information about entanglement. By deriving rigorous bounds for susceptibility, we demonstrate that their violation serves as an entanglement witness. Our results show that anisotropy enhances entanglement, extending the temperature range over which it persists. Additionally, by tracing over the degrees of freedom of two qubits, we examine the reduced density matrix of the remaining qubits and find that its entropy under the influence of the magnetic field can be mapped to an effective thermal bath at $(B,K) > 0$ K.

Title: High-order van Hove singularities and nematic instability in the kagome superconductor CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$
Authors: Bikash Patra, Amrita Mukherjee, Bahadur Singh
Abstract: ATi$_3$Bi$_5$ (A = Cs or Rb) are emerging topological kagome metals that exhibit superconductivity and nematicity without intertwining translational symmetry-breaking charge orders. In this work, we explore the fermiology of their titanium kagome electrons and identify a set of sublattice-pure, high-order van Hove singularities (VHSs) that can suppress charge ordering and enhance electronic correlations and superconductivity. Our calculations of charge susceptibility for kagome bands with both normal and high-order VHSs emphasize the role of these VHSs in driving electronic nematicity in CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$. Additionally, we compute the phonon spectrum and electron-phonon interactions for CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$ under pristine, doped, and kagome-exposed surface conditions, revealing its robustness against structural instabilities while enhancing the superconducting transition temperature. Our work positions ATi$_3$Bi$_5$ as a key platform for investigating superconductivity and electronic nematicity without translational symmetry-breaking states in kagome metals.

Title: Variational formulation of dynamical electronic response functions in presence of nonlocal exchange interactions
Authors: Giovanni Caldarelli, Alberto Guandalini, Francesco Macheda, Francesco Mauri
Abstract: We consider the dynamical electronic response function in theoretical frameworks that include nonlocal exchange interactions, such as the Bethe-Salpeter equation with the frequency independent approximation of the screened interaction, Hartree-Fock, and range-separated Hybrid DFT approaches. Within these pictures, we demonstrate that any time-dependent electronic linear response function allows for a formulation which is variational in the electronic density matrix. To achieve our goal, we consider the usual form of a response function, written in terms of a screened and a bare electronic vertices (`bare-screen'), and perform an exact rewriting in terms of purely screened electronic vertices (`screen-screen'). Within the `screen-screen' formulation, the response function can be written as a stationary point of a functional of the exact density matrix. Further, we show that the imaginary part of any electronic response can be written in the form of a generalized Fermi Golden Rule, by introducing an exact complementary rewriting in terms of vertices related by complex conjugation (`screen*-screen'). The screen-screen formulation can be further extended partitioning the electronic interaction in separate contributions, expressing the response in terms of partially screened electronic vertices (`partial screen-partial screen'), preserving the stationary properties. We numerically validate the effectiveness of our formalism by calculating the optical conductivity of graphene, which exhibits strong excitonic effects. To do so, we solve the Bethe-Salpeter Equation on a tight-binding model, including exchange effects in the response of graphene. Our findings show the advantages of the variationality of the screen-screen formulation over the others both in convergence properties and robustness with density-matrix approximations.

Title: Rational Design Heterobilayers Photocatalysts for Efficient Water Splitting Based on 2D Transition-Metal Dichalcogenide and Their Janus
Authors: Nguyen Tran Gia Bao, Ton Nu Quynh Trang, Nam Thoai, Phan Bach Thang, Vu Thi Hanh Thu, Nguyen Tuan Hung
Abstract: Direct Z-scheme heterobilayers with enhanced redox potential are viewed as promising for solar-driven water splitting, arising from the synergy between intrinsic dipoles in Janus materials and interfacial electric fields across the layers. This study explores 20 two-dimensional Janus transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) heterobilayers for efficient water splitting. Using density-functional theory (DFT) calculations, we screen them based on band gaps and intrinsic electric fields to identify promising candidates, then further assess carrier mobility and surface chemistry to fully evaluate their overall performance. By examining the alignment of synthetic and internal electric fields, we distinguish between Type-I, Type-II, and Z-scheme configurations, enabling the targeted design of optimal photocatalytic materials. Furthermore, we employ the Fröhlich interaction model to quantify the mobility contributions from the longitudinal optical phonon mode, providing detailed insights into how carrier mobility, influenced by phonon scattering, affects photocatalytic performance. Our findings demonstrate the potential of Janus-based Z-scheme systems to overcome existing limitations in photocatalytic water splitting by optimizing the electronic and structural properties of 2D materials, highlighting a viable pathway for advancing clean energy generation through enhanced photocatalytic processes.

Title: Proof of the absence of local conserved quantities in the spin-1 bilinear-biquadratic chain and its anisotropic extensions
Authors: Akihiro Hokkyo, Mizuki Yamaguchi, Yuuya Chiba
Abstract: We provide a complete classification of the integrability and nonintegrability of the spin-1 bilinear-biquadratic model with a uniaxial anisotropic field, which includes the Heisenberg model and the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki model. It is rigorously shown that all systems, except for the known integrable systems, are nonintegrable, meaning that they do not have nontrivial local conserved quantities. In particular, this result guarantees the nonintegrability of the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki model, which is a fundamental assumption for quantum many-body scarring. Furthermore, we give simple necessary conditions for integrability in an extended model of the bilinear-biquadratic model with anisotropic interactions. Our result has accomplished a breakthrough in nonintegrability proofs by expanding their scope to spin-1 systems.

Title: Universal scale-free decay of tracer-bath correlations in $d$-dimensional interacting particle systems
Authors: Davide Venturelli, Pierre Illien, Aurélien Grabsch, Olivier Bénichou
Abstract: Quantifying the correlations between the position of a tagged tracer and the density of surrounding bath particles is crucial for understanding tracer diffusion in interacting particle systems, and for characterizing the response properties of the bath. We address this problem analytically for both hard-core and soft-core interactions, using minimal yet paradigmatic models in $d$ spatial dimensions. In both cases, we derive analytical expressions for the spatial correlation profiles in the reference frame of the tracer. We reveal unexpected universal features in their large-distance behavior, characterized by power-law tails with exponents that depend solely on the spatial dimensionality of the system. Beyond these simple models, we demonstrate the robustness of our results across different regimes using particle-based numerical simulations.

Title: Inter-Event Time Power Laws in Heterogeneous Systems
Authors: Federico Ettori, Timothy J. Sluckin, Paolo Biscari
Abstract: We investigate the dynamic behavior of spin reversal events in the dilute Ising model, focusing on the influence of static disorder introduced by pinned spins. Our Monte Carlo simulations reveal that in a homogeneous, defect-free system, the inter-event time (IET) between local spin flips follows an exponential distribution, characteristic of Poissonian processes. However, in heterogeneous systems where defects are present, we observe a significant departure from this behavior. At high temperatures, the IET exhibits a power-law distribution resulting from the interplay of spins located in varying potential environments, where defect density influences reversal probabilities. At low temperatures, all site classes converge to a unique power-law distribution, regardless of their potential, leading to distinct critical exponents for the high- and low-temperature regimes. This transition from exponential to power-law behavior underscores the critical response features of magnetic systems with defects, suggesting analogies to glassy dynamics. Our findings highlight the complex mechanisms governing spin dynamics in disordered systems, with implications for understanding the universal aspects of relaxation in glassy materials.

Title: Locally Interacting Lattice Bosons: Clustering Theorem, Low-Density Condition and Their Applications
Authors: Xin-Hai Tong, Tomotaka Kuwahara, Zongping Gong
Abstract: In statistical and quantum many-body physics, the correlation function is a fundamental quantity, especially for lattice models described by local Hamiltonians. Away from the phase-transition point, correlation function typically satisfies the clustering property, meaning that the correlation concentrates at short ranges while decays rapidly (exponentially) at long distances. Though the clustering property has been extensively studied for spin and fermion systems, whether a similar result holds for boson systems remains a long-standing open problem. The essential difficulty lies in the infinite Hilbert-space dimension of a boson, in stark contrast to the finite dimension of a spin or fermion. This work is devoted to establishing the boson counterpart of the clustering of correlations at high temperatures, focusing primarily on the canonical Bose-Hubbard model. As a byproduct, we rigorously justify the low-boson-density assumption for the Gibbs state of the Bose-Hubbard type. This assumption is often invoked as a preliminary requirement for proving various rigorous results, including the boson Lieb-Robinson bound. Building on the results above, we show that, at high temperature, the specific heat density can be bounded from above by a constant, and the boson thermal area law holds true. Our achievement is based on the imaginary-time interaction picture, which is expected to have much broader applications to other open problems concerning bosons in statistical and quantum many-body physics.

Title: Scalable amplitude of Sondheimer oscillations in thin cadmium crystals
Authors: Xiaodong Guo, Xiaokang Li, Lingxiao Zhao, Zengwei Zhu, Kamran Behnia
Abstract: Decades ago, Sondheimer discovered that the electric conductivity of metallic crystals hosting ballistic electrons oscillates with magnetic field. These oscillations, periodic in magnetic field with the period proportional to the sample thickness, have been understood in a semi-classical framework. Here, we present a study of longitudinal and transverse conductivity in cadmium single crystals with thickness varying between 12.6 to 475 $\mu$m. When the magnetic field is sufficiently large or the sample sufficiently thick, the amplitude of oscillation falls off as $B^{-4}$ as previously reported. In contrast, the ten first oscillations follow a $B^{-2.5}e^{-B/B_0}$ field dependence and their amplitude is set by the quantum of conductance, the sample thickness, the magnetic length and the Fermi surface geometry. This expression is in disagreement with what was predicted in semi-classical scenarios, which neglect Landau quantization. We argue that the classical/quantum crossover occurs at accessible magnetic fields for states whose Fermi wave-vector is almost parallel to the magnetic field. As a consequence, the intersection between the lowest Landau tube and flat toroids on the Fermi surface induced by confinement give rise to oscillations with a periodicity identical to the semi-classical one. A rigorous theoretical account of our data is missing.

Title: Mean first-passage time at the origin of a run-and-tumble particle with periodic forces
Authors: Pascal Grange, Linglong Yuan
Abstract: We consider a run-and-tumble particle on a half-line with an absorbing target at the origin. The particle has an internal velocity state that switches between two opposite values at Poisson-distributed times. The position of the particle evolves according to an overdamped Langevin dynamics with a spatially-periodic force field such that every point in a given period interval is accessible to the particle. The survival probability of the particle satisfies a backward Fokker--Planck equation, whose Laplace transform yields systems of equations for the moments of the first-passage time of the particle at the origin. The mean first-passage time has already been calculated assuming that the particle exits the system almost surely. We calculate the probability that the particle reaches the origin in a finite time, given its initial position and velocity. We obtain an integral condition on the force, under which the particle has a non-zero survival probability. The conditioned average of the first-passage time at the origin (over the trajectories that reach the origin) is obtained in closed form, both in the latter case and in the case of almost-sure exit. As an application, we consider a piecewise-constant force field that alternates periodically between two opposite values. In the limit where the period is short compared to the mean free path of the particle, the exit probability and the mean first-return time at the origin coincide with the values obtained in the case of an effective constant drift, which we calculate explicitly.

Title: Deep Boundary Perturbations at a Quantum Critical Point
Authors: Shang Liu
Abstract: In this work, we explore an unconventional class of problems in the study of (quantum) critical phenomena, termed "deep boundary criticality". Traditionally, critical systems are analyzed with two types of perturbations: those uniformly distributed throughout the bulk, which can significantly alter the bulk criticality by triggering a nontrivial bulk renormalization group flow, and those confined to a boundary or subdimensional defect, which affect only the boundary or defect condition. Here, we go beyond this paradigm by studying quantum critical systems with boundary perturbations that decay algebraically (following a power law) into the bulk. By continuously varying the decay exponent, such perturbations can transition between having no effect on the bulk and strongly influencing bulk behavior. We investigate this regime using two prototypical models based on (1+1)D massless Dirac fermions. Through a combination of analytical and numerical approaches, we uncover exotic scaling laws in simple observables and observe qualitative changes in model behavior as the decay exponent varies.

Title: Frustrated Spin Systems: History of the Emergence of a Modern Physics
Authors: Hung T. Diep
Abstract: In 1977, Gérard Toulouse has proposed a new concept termed as "frustration" in spin systems. Using this definition, several frustrated models have been created and studied, among them we can mention the Villain's model, the fully frustrated simple cubic lattice, the antiferromagnetic triangular lattice. The former models are systems with mixed ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic bonds, while in the latter containing only an antiferromagnetic interaction, the frustration is caused by the lattice geometry. These frustrated spin systems have novel properties that we will review in this paper. One of the striking aspects is the fact that well-established methods such as the renormalization group fail to deal with the nature of the phase transition in frustrated systems. Investigations of properties of frustrated spin systems have been intensive since the 80's. I myself got involved in several investigations of frustrated spin systems soon after my PhD. I have learned a lot from numerous discussions with Gérard Toulouse. Until today, I am still working on frustrated systems such as skyrmions. In this review, I trace back a number of my works over the years on frustrated spin systems going from exactly solved 2D Ising frustrated models, to XY and Heisenberg 2D and 3D frustrated lattices. At the end I present my latest results on skyrmions resulting from the frustration caused by the competition between the exchange interaction and the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction under an applied magnetic field. A quantum spin-wave theory using the Green's function method is shown and discussed.

Title: Quadrupole gauge theory: anti-Higgs mechanism and elastic dual
Authors: Aleksander Głódkowski, Paweł Matus, Francisco Peña-Benítez, Lazaros Tsaloukidis
Abstract: Motivated by the duality between elasticity and fracton gauge theory, we study an extension of the gauge group that includes the quadrupole moment. Remarkably, we find that spontaneous breaking of the quadrupole symmetry increases the number of massless excitations. This result appears to challenge the well-established paradigm, according to which gauge fields acquire mass through the Higgs mechanism, and the would-be Goldstone bosons are rendered massive. We refer to this phenomenon as the anti-Higgs mechanism. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the quadrupole gauge theory is dual to an exotic class of elastic systems, which we dub incompressible crystals. The anti-Higgs mechanism in the dual theory corresponds to a phase transition from the incompressible crystal state to an ordinary (compressible) solid.

Title: Surface Chemistry-based Continuous Separation of Colloidal Particles via Diffusiophoresis and Diffusioosmosis
Authors: Adnan Chakra, Christina Puijk, Goran T. Vladisavljević, Cécile Cottin-Bizonne, Christophe Pirat, Guido Bolognesi
Abstract: The separation of colloidal particles based solely on their surface properties is a highly challenging task. This study demonstrates that diffusiophoresis and diffusioosmosis enable the continuous separation of carboxylate polystyrene particles with similar sizes and zeta potentials but distinct surface concentrations of carboxyl groups. The particles are exposed to salt concentration gradients generated in a double-junction microfluidic device. Through experimental and theoretical analyses, we demonstrate how the particle dynamics are influenced by their zeta potential sensitivity to the local salt concentration, which in turn is affected by surface conductance effects induced by the surface carboxyl groups. Consequently, colloids with comparable zeta potentials but differing surface concentrations of carboxyl groups can be separated with 100% efficiency. This approach, which employs a simple, easy-to-operate device, has discipline-spanning potential for the continuous separation of colloids distinguished solely by surface properties that influence their zeta potential sensitivities, like roughness, permeability, heterogeneity, and chemical composition.

Title: Probing nonlocal correlations in magnetic rare-earth clusters
Authors: David W. Facemyer, Sergio E. Ulloa
Abstract: Understanding and quantifying entanglement entropy is crucial to characterize the quantum behaviors that drive phenomena in a variety of systems. Rare-earth spin complexes, with their unique magnetic properties, provide fertile ground for exploring these nonlocal correlations. In this work, we study Eu$^{2+}$ ions deposited on a Au(111) substrate, modeling finite clusters of large spin-moments using a Heisenberg Hamiltonian parameterized by first-principles calculations. Our analysis reveals a one-to-one correspondence between structures in the differential conductance profiles and changes in the von Neumann entanglement entropy of bipartite subsystems, influenced by probe-ion separation and applied magnetic fields. Distinct braiding patterns in the conductance profiles are shown to correspond to stepwise changes in the entanglement entropy, providing a new avenue for investigating quantum correlations. These results establish a foundation for experimentally probing and controlling entanglement in lanthanide-based systems, with potential applications in quantum technologies.

Title: Discontinuous Structural Transitions in Fluids with Competing Interactions
Authors: Ana M. Montero, Santos B. Yuste, Andrés Santos, Mariano López de Haro
Abstract: This paper explores how competing interactions in the intermolecular potential of fluids affect their structural transitions. This study employs a versatile potential model with a hard core followed by two constant steps, representing wells or shoulders, analyzed in both one-dimensional (1D) and three-dimensional (3D) systems. Comparing these dimensionalities highlights the effect of confinement on structural transitions. Exact results are derived for 1D systems, while the rational function approximation is used for unconfined 3D fluids. Both scenarios confirm that when the steps are repulsive, the wavelength of the oscillatory decay of the total correlation function evolves with temperature either continuously or discontinuously. In the latter case, a discontinuous oscillation crossover line emerges in the temperature--density plane. For an attractive first step and a repulsive second step, a Fisher--Widom line appears. Although the 1D and 3D results share common features, dimensionality introduces differences: these behaviors occur in distinct temperature ranges, require deeper wells, or become attenuated in 3D. Certain features observed in 1D may vanish in 3D. We conclude that fluids with competing interactions exhibit a rich and intricate pattern of structural transitions, demonstrating the significant influence of dimensionality and interaction features.

Title: A kinetically constrained model exhibiting non-linear diffusion and jamming
Authors: Abhishek Raj, Vadim Oganesyan, Antonello Scardicchio
Abstract: We present a classical kinetically constrained model of interacting particles on a triangular ladder, which displays diffusion and jamming and can be treated by means of a classical-quantum mapping. Interpreted as a theory of interacting fermions, the diffusion coefficient is the inverse of the effective mass of the quasiparticles which can be computed using mean-field theory. At a critical density \r{ho} = 2/3, the model undergoes a dynamical phase transition in which exponentially many configurations become jammed while others remain diffusive. The model can be generalized to two dimensions.

Title: Flexible and Efficient Semi-Empirical DFTB Parameters for Electronic Structure Prediction of 3D, 2D Iodide Perovskites and Heterostructures

Abstract: Density Functional Tight-Binding (DFTB), an approximative approach derived from Density Functional Theory (DFT), has the potential to pave the way for simulations of large periodic or non-periodic systems. We have specifically tailored DFTB parameters to enhance the accuracy of electronic band gap calculations in both 3D and 2D lead-iodide perovskites, at a significantly reduced computational cost relative to state-of-the-art ab initio calculations. Our electronic DFTB parameters allow computing not only the band gap but also effective masses of perovskite materials with reasonable accuracy compared to existing experimental data and state-of-the-art DFT calculations. The electronic band structures of vacancy-ordered and, lead- and iodide- deficient perovskites are also explored. Additionally, we demonstrate the efficiency of DFTB in computing electronic band alignments in perovskite heterostructures. The DFTB-based approach is anticipated to be beneficial for studying large-scale systems such as heterostructures and nanocrystals.

Title: Skyrmion Lattice Manipulation with Electric Currents and Thermal Gradients in MnSi
Authors: N. Chalus, A. W. D. Leishman, R. M. Menezes, G. Longbons, U. Welp, W.-K. Kwok, J. S. White, M. Bartkowiak, R. Cubitt, Y. Liu, E. D. Bauer, M. Janoschek, M. V. Milosevic, M. R. Eskildsen
Abstract: The skyrmion lattice (SkL) in MnSi was studied using small-angle neutron scattering and under the influence of a radial electric current in a Corbino geometry. In response to the applied current, the SkL undergoes an angular reorientation with respect to the MnSi crystal lattice. The reorientation is non-monotonic with increasing current, with the SkL rotating first in one direction and then the other. The SkL reorientation was studied at different sample locations and found to depend on the local current density as inferred from a finite element analysis. The non-monotonic response indicates the presence of two competing effects on the SkL, most likely due to the presence of both radial electric and thermal currents. Such a scenario is supported by micromagnetic simulations, which show how these effects can act constructively or destructively to drive the SkL rotation, depending on the direction of the electric current. In addition, the simulations also suggest how the direction of the skyrmion flow may affect the SkL orientation.

Title: Topological Hall effect in monolayer 1T$^{\prime}$-MoS$_2$
Authors: Mohammad Mortezaei Nobahari, Mahmood Rezaei Roknabadi
Abstract: 1T$^{\prime}$ phase of the monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides has recently attracted attention for its potential in nanoelectronic applications. This study proves the topological behavior of 1T$^{\prime}$-MoS$_2$ using $k.p$ Hamiltonian and linear response theory. The spin texture in momentum space reveals a strong spin-momentum locking with different orientations for the valence and conduction bands. Berry curvature distributions around the Dirac points highlight the influence of $\alpha$ parameter demonstrating a topological phase transition in 1T$^\prime$-MoS$_2$. For $\alpha<1$ the spin Hall conductivity is the only non-zero term, corresponding to a quantum spin Hall insulator (QSHI) phase, while for $\alpha>1$, valley Hall conductivity prevails, indicating a transition to a band insulator (BI). Further analysis explores the spin-valley-resolved Hall conductivity and Chern numbers across varying values of $\alpha$, $V$, and Fermi energy, uncovering regions of trivial topological phases (TTP) and the role of the edge modes. The zero total Nernst coefficient across energy ranges suggests strong cancellation between spin and valley contributions, providing insights into the material's potential for thermoelectric applications and spintronic devices.

Title: Stochastic field effects in a two-state system: symmetry breaking and symmetry restoring
Authors: Sara Oliver-Bonafoux, Raul Toral, Amitabha Chakrabarti
Abstract: We propose a theoretical model that incorporates both a time-varying stochastic field and thermal noise in a two-state system. In analyzing data from numerical simulations, we adopt a detailed microscopic approach that goes beyond the standard calculation of the order parameter. Specifically, we measure the probability distribution of the magnetization as a function of temperature and field strength, and compute the time required for the system to jump from one ordered state to the other. These measurements enable us to probe various ordered states in the system and investigate the symmetry breaking and symmetry restoring phenomena underlying the observed phase behavior.

Title: Infrared properties of two-dimensional $\mathrm{SU}(N)/H$ nonlinear $\sigma$ models at nonzero $\theta$ angles
Authors: Philippe Lecheminant, Yuya Tanizaki, Keisuke Totsuka
Abstract: A general strategy is proposed to explore the low-energy properties of two-dimensional nonlinear $\sigma$ models with $\theta$ terms. We demonstrate its application to nonlinear $\sigma$ models with the target space $\text{SU($N$)}$/H, which include $\mathbb{C}P^{N-1}$, complex Grassmannian manifolds as well as the flag $\text{SU($N$)}/\text{U(1)}^{N-1}$ and $\text{SU($N$)})/\text{SO($N$)}$ manifolds. By analyzing the symmetry and its anomaly content, we realize these nonlinear $\sigma$ models through perturbations added to the SU(N)$_1$ conformal field theory. For the flag-manifold $\text{SU($N$)}/\text{U(1)}^{N-1}$ and $\text{SU($N$)})/\text{SO($N$)}$ models, those perturbations are shown to correspond to the marginal current-current operator with the specific sign which leads to a massless renormalization group flow to the SU(N)$_1$ fixed point. In contrast, a massive regime with a two-fold ground-state degeneracy is found for the $\mathbb{C}P^{N-1}$ ($N >2$) and Grassmannian nonlinear $\sigma$ models at $\theta=\pi$.

Title: Third-Order Exceptional Point in Non-Hermitian Spin-Orbit-Coupled cold atoms
Authors: Yu-Jun Liu, Ka Kwan Pak, Peng Ren, Mengbo Guo, Entong Zhao, Chengdong He, Gyu-Boong Jo
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs) has seen substantial advances in both experiment and theory. However, in quantum systems, higher-order exceptional points remain of great interest and possess numerous intriguing properties yet to be fully explored. Here, we describe a \emph{PT} symmetry-protected three-level non-Hermitian system with the dissipative spin-orbit-coupled (SOC) fermions in which a third-order exceptional point (EP3) emerges when both the eigenvalues and eigenstates of the system collapse into one. The band structure and its spin dynamics are explored for $^{173}$Yb fermions. We highlight the enhanced sensitivity to the external perturbation of EP3 with cubic-root energy dispersion. Additionally, we investigate the second-order exceptional point (EP2) with square-root energy dispersion in a three-level quantum system with the absence of parity symmetry, which proves that the enhanced sensitivity closely relates to the symmetries of the NH system. Furthermore, we analyze the encircling behavior of EP3 in terms of the adiabatic limit and the nonadiabatic dynamics and discover some different results from that of EP2.

Title: Transfer entropy and flow of information in two-skyrmion system
Authors: Tenta Tani, Soma Miki, Hiroki Mori, Minori Goto, Yoshishige Suzuki, Eiiti Tamura
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the flow of information in an interacting two-skyrmion system confined in a box at finite temperature. Using numerical simulations based on the Thiele-Langevin equation, we demonstrate that the skyrmion motion cannot be fully described by the master equation, highlighting the system's simplicity with its nontrivial dynamics. Particularly, due to the chiral motion of skyrmion, we find asymmetric flow of information even in equilibrium, which is demonstrated by the violation of the detailed balance condition. We analyze this novel system using information-theoretical quantities including Shannon entropy, mutual information, and transfer entropy. By the analyses, the physical significance of transfer entropy as a measure of flow of information, which has been overlooked in previous studies, is elucidated. Notably, the peak position of the transfer entropy, as a function of time delay, is found to be independent of the interaction range between the two skyrmions yet dependent on the box size. This peak corresponds to the characteristic time required for changing the skyrmion state: the box size divided by the average velocity of skyrmions. We can understand that the information transmission time consists of the time to obtain mutual information and the time to write the information. Since the unusual asymmetric circulation of information is revealed in this two-skyrmion system, it can be a unique platform for future applications to natural computing using flow of information, including more efficient machine learning algorithm.

Title: Periodically and aperiodically Thue-Morse driven long-range systems: from dynamical localization to slow dynamics
Authors: Vatsana Tiwari, Devendra Singh Bhakuni, Auditya Sharma
Abstract: We investigate the electric-field driven power-law random banded matrix(PLRBM) model where a variation in the power-law exponent $\alpha$ yields a delocalization-to-localization phase transition. We examine the periodically driven PLRBM model with the help of the Floquet operator. The level spacing ratio and the generalized participation ratio of the Floquet Hamiltonian reveal a drive-induced fractal phase accompanied by diffusive transport on the delocalized side of the undriven PLRBM model. On the localized side, the time-periodic model remains localized - the average spacing ratio corresponds to Poisson statistics and logarithmic transport is observed in the dynamics. Extending our analysis to the aperiodic Thue-Morse (TM) driven system, we find that the aperiodically driven clean long-range hopping model (clean counterpart of the PLRBM model) exhibits the phenomenon of \textit{exact dynamical localization} (EDL) on tuning the drive-parameters at special points. The disordered time-aperiodic system shows diffusive transport followed by relaxation to the infinite-temperature state on the delocalized side, and a prethermal plateau with subdiffusion on the localized side. Additionally, we compare this with a quasi-periodically driven AAH model that also undergoes a localization-delocalization transition. Unlike the disordered long-range model, it features a prolonged prethermal plateau followed by subdiffusion to the infinite temperature state, even on the delocalized side.

Title: Cascades in transport and optical conductivity of Twisted Bilayer Graphene
Authors: M.J. Calderón, A. Camjayi, A. Datta, E. Bascones
Abstract: Using a combined Dynamical Mean Field Theory and Hartree (DMFT+H) calculation we study the transport and optical properties of the 8-band heavy fermion model for Twisted Bilayer Graphene (TBG) in the normal state. We find resistive states around integer fillings which resemble the ones observed in transport experiments. From a Drude fitting of the low frequency optical conductivity, we extract a very strongly doping-dependent Drude weight and scattering rate, resetting at the integers. For most dopings, particularly above the integers, the Drude scattering rate is high but notably smaller than that of the local electrons. This highlights the important role of itinerant electrons in the transport properties, despite their limited spectral weight on the flat bands. At far infrared frequencies, the optical conductivity exhibits cascades characterized by highly asymmetric resets of the intensity and oscillations in the interband peak frequencies.

Title: Intrinsic (Axion) Statistical Topological Insulator
Authors: Xi Chen, Fa-Jie Wang, Zhen Bi, Zhi-Da Song
Abstract: Ensembles that respect symmetries on average exhibit richer topological states than those in pure states with exact symmetries, leading to the concept of average symmetry-protected topological states (ASPTs). The free-fermion counterpart of ASPT is the so-called statistical topological insulator (STI) in disordered ensembles. In this work, we demonstrate the existence of intrinsic STI - which has no band insulator correspondence - characterized by the half-quantized magneto-electric polarization $P_3\!=\!\theta/(2\pi)$. A $C_{4}T$ symmetry reverses the sign of $\theta$ angle, hence seems to protect a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ classification of $\theta\!=\!0,\pi$. However, we prove that, if $(C_{4}T)^4 \!=\! 1$, the topological state with $\theta\!=\!\pi$ cannot be realized in band insulators where $C_{4}T$ is exact. Surprisingly, using a real space construction (topological crystal), we find that an STI with $\theta\!=\!\pi$ can arise in Anderson insulators with disorders respecting $C_{4}T$ on average. To illustrate this state, we construct a lattice model and examine its phase diagram using the transfer matrix method up to the largest numerically accessible system size. An STI phase is identified through delocalized surface states and a half-quantized magneto-electric polarization in the bulk. As expected, an unavoidable gapless phase separates the STI from both clean insulators and trivial Anderson insulators, revealing the intrinsic nature of the STI. Moreover, we argue that the intrinsic STI is robust against electron-electron interactions, i.e., interactions cannot open an adiabatic path connecting the STI to a gapped clean system. Thus, our work provides the first intrinsic crystalline ASPT and its lattice realization. We also generalize the discussion to other crystalline symmetries.

Title: Dynamical electron-phonon vertex correction
Authors: Andrea Marini
Abstract: The dynamical screening of the electron--phonon vertex is caused by the retarded oscillations of the electronic charge following the electron--hole scattering with a phonon mode. This retardation induces a frequency dependence of the electron--phonon interaction. Model Hamiltonians and {\em ab--initio} approaches have instilled the idea that this retardation is, in most of the cases, negligible. In this work I demonstrate that the dynamical screening of the electron--phonon vertex cannot be neglected {\em a priori}. By using a perturbative expansion I introduce a controllable and physically sound method to evaluate and include dynamical screening effects. Based on the exact results of the homogeneous electron gas I propose a dynamical vertex correction function $\Gamma_{e-p}(\omega)$ designed to screen the commonly used adiabatic electron--phonon interaction. This function is expressed in terms of adiabatic quantities, that can be easily calculated and used to evaluate the strength of the dynamical corrections, even in realistic materials.

Title: Optimal Estimation of Temperature
Authors: Shaoyong Zhang, Zhaoyu Fei, Xiaoguang Wang
Abstract: Over the past century, the Boltzmann entropy has been widely accepted as the standard definition of entropy for an isolated system. However, it coexists with controversial alternatives, such as the Gibbs entropy. These definitions, including the Boltzmann entropy, exhibit certain inconsistencies, both mathematically and thermodynamically. To address this challenge, we introduce the estimation theory in statistical inference into the study of thermodynamics and statistical physics for finite-sized systems. By regarding the finite-sized system as a thermometer used to measure the temperature of the heat reservoir, we show that optimal estimation of temperature yields the corresponding entropy formula for an isolated system. In the single-sample case, optimal estimation of inverse temperature (or temperature) corresponds to the Boltzmann entropy (or Gibbs entropy). These different definitions of entropy, rather than being contradictory, apply to optimal estimation of different parameters. Furthermore, via the Laplace transform, we identify a complementarity between estimation of temperature and system's energy, a concept suggested by Niels Bohr. We also correct the energy-temperature uncertainty relation, as expressed by the Cramér-Rao bound, in the large-$N$ limit. In the multiple-sample case, we generalize the definitions of both Boltzmann entropy and Gibbs entropy to achieve optimal estimation of temperature, revealing the tight connection between statistical inference and Terrell Hill's nanothermodynamics.

Title: Kitaev Quantum Spin Liquids
Authors: Yuji Matsuda, Takasada Shibauchi, Hae-Young Kee
Abstract: Quantum spin liquids (QSLs) represent exotic states of matter where quantum spins interact strongly yet evade long-range magnetic order down to absolute zero. Characterized by non-local quantum entanglement and resultant fractionalized excitations, QSLs have emerged as a frontier in condensed matter physics, bolstered by the recent identification of several candidate materials. This field holds profound implications for understanding strong correlations, topological order, and emergent phenomena in quantum materials. Among them, the spin-1/2 Kitaev honeycomb model, featuring bond-directional Ising interactions, provides a rare exactly solvable QSL example. Its ground state is a topological QSL, with spin degrees of freedom fractionalized into emergent Majorana fermions. Under an applied magnetic field, the Kitaev QSL transitions to a topologically non-trivial chiral spin liquid state with non-Abelian anyons, offering potential resources for topological quantum computation. The non-Abelian character of these anyons in the Kitaev QSL demonstrates a profound connection to certain topological superconductors and even-denominator fractional quantum Hall states. Since the theoretical prediction that the Kitaev model could manifest in spin-orbit-coupled materials such as honeycomb iridates and ruthenates, research has focused on identifying candidate compounds. In particular, experimental evidence suggests spin fractionalization and topological phenomena akin to the Kitaev model in the spin-orbit Mott insulator $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. However, results and interpretations remain actively debated. This review presents a comprehensive survey of existing studies on Kitaev candidate materials, with a particular focus on $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. Rather than offering conclusive remarks, our aim is to inspire future research by examining several key aspects of the current literature and perspectives.

Title: High order strong-coupling expansion for X-ray absorption on a dynamically screened impurity
Authors: Eva Paprotzki, Martin Eckstein
Abstract: Time-resolved X-ray absorption can reveal the dynamical screening of the local Coulomb interaction in strongly correlated photo-excited materials. Here, we focus on the theoretical prediction of X-ray absorption in the presence of dynamical screening using the strong coupling expansion, i.e., an expansion around the isolated absorption site in terms of the retarded interaction. The evaluation of higher order diagrams is made numerically feasible by an approach based on the decomposition of the retarded interaction into complex exponentials. With this, we evaluate the strong coupling series to third order on an electron-boson model of Holstein type. We demonstrate that in relevant coupling regimes, even low orders of the strong coupling expansion can give a significant correction over the previously used lowest order approximation.

Title: Nonequilibrium effects in spin-torque oscillators
Authors: Pieter M. Gunnink, Tim Ludwig, Alexander Shnirman, Rembert A. Duine
Abstract: One of the cornerstones of spintronics is the application of a spin-transfer torque to a nanomagnet, driving the magnetization of the nanomagnet into a steady-state precession and realizing a spin-torque oscillator. Such a steady state, sustained by a balance between driving and dissipation, could be a textbook example for a nonequilibrium situation. Nevertheless, most theoretical descriptions of spin-torque oscillators simply assume local equilibrium. Here, based on a simple model, we investigate the relevance of nonequilibrium effects in spin-torque oscillators. We use a nonequilibrium Keldysh description, which allows us to treat the effects of spin relaxation, and find that, in the absence of spin relaxation, persistent precessions of the magnetization are not allowed, if magnetic anisotropies are absent. However, introducing spin relaxation enables persistent precessions, where the strength of the spin relaxation has quantitative and qualitative effects on the magnetization dynamics. In the presence of magnetic anisotropy, we find that persistent precessions are allowed even if spin relaxation is absent, but spin relaxation causes a nonlinear relation between the oscillator power and the applied voltage bias. Finally, we consider an alternative spin relaxation mechanism and study the resulting magnetization precessions, highlighting the importance of understanding the exact nature of the relaxation in nanomagnets.

Title: Two-Peak Heat Capacity Accounts for $R\ln(2)$ Entropy and Ground State Access in the Dipole-Octupole Pyrochlore Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$
Authors: E. M. Smith, A. Fitterman, R. Schäfer, B. Placke, A. Woods, S. Lee, S. H.-Y. Huang, S. Sharma, J. Beare, D. Chatterjee, C. Balz, M. B. Stone, A. I. Kolesnikov, A. R. Wildes, E. Kermarrec, G. M. Luke, O. Benton, R. Moessner, R. Movshovich, A. D. Bianchi, B. D. Gaulin
Abstract: We report new magnetic heat capacity measurements of a high quality single crystal of the dipole-octupole pyrochlore Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$ down to a temperature of $T = 0.02$ K, a factor of three lower than those previously reported. These show a two-peaked structure, with a Schottky-like peak at $T_1 \sim 0.065$ K, similar to what is observed in its sister Ce-pyrochlores Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ and Ce$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$. However a second, sharper peak is observed at $T_2 \sim 0.025$ K, which signifies the entrance to its ground state, as even the most abrupt low-temperature extrapolation to $C_P=0$ at $T = 0$ K gives a full accounting of $R\ln(2)$ in entropy, associated with the well isolated pseudospin-1/2 doublet for Ce$^{3+}$ in this environment. The ground state could be conventionally ordered, although theory predicts a much larger anomaly in $C_P$, at much higher temperatures than the measured $T_2$, for expectations from an all-in all-out ground state of the nearest-neighbor XYZ Hamiltonian for Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$. The sharp low-temperature peak could also signify a cross-over from a classical to a quantum spin liquid regime. The diffuse magnetic neutron scattering observed from Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$ at low temperatures between $T_2$ and $T_1$ resembles that observed from Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$, which is well established as a $\pi$-flux quantum spin ice.

Title: Exploring Unique Characteristics in Stark Many-Body Localization
Authors: Chung Po Ching
Abstract: Stark Many-Body Localization (MBL) is a phenomenon observed in quantum systems in the absence of disorder, where the presence of a linear potential, known as the Stark field, causes the localization. Our study aims to provide novel insight into the properties of Stark MBL and to discover unique entanglement characteristics specific to this phenomenon. The phase diagram analysis reveals different behavior with varying interaction strengths. Furthermore, we highlight the influence of domain wall structures on the breakdown of the entanglement entropy of the system. Moreover, the investigation of Out-of-Time-Ordered Correlator (OTOC) behavior demonstrates distinct responses to interactions based on domain wall configurations. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of Stark MBL and offer valuable insights into the entanglement properties of systems subjected to Stark potentials.

Title: How a leak can stop itself
Authors: Caroline D. Tally, Heather E. Kurtz, Rose B. Tchuenkam, Justyn M. Friedler, Katharine E. Jensen
Abstract: Small fluid leaks are common and frequently troublesome. We often consider how to stop a leak, but here we ask a different question: how might a leak stop itself? We experimentally study leaking flow transitions from continuous drainage to spontaneous arrest. High-speed imaging reveals that fluid breakup events generate droplets whose Laplace pressures oppose the leak. Early droplets grow unstably, allowing the leak to continue, but ultimately a final capping droplet equilibrates to a stable spherical cap via lightly damped harmonic oscillations. A total energetic theory incorporating both the potential and kinetic energy of attempted capping droplets shows that inertia plays a key role in the leak-stop mechanism. Further experiments examining the stability of rivulet flow in such a system demonstrate that a transition from continuous to discrete flow is an essential prerequisite in determining when a leak can stop itself.

Title: Entanglement statistics of polymers in a lattice tube and unknotting of 4-plats
Authors: Nicholas R. Beaton, Kai Ishihara, Mahshid Atapour, Jeremy W. Eng, Mariel Vazquez, Koya Shimokawa, Christine E. Soteros
Abstract: The Knot Entropy Conjecture states that the exponential growth rate of the number of $n$-edge lattice polygons with knot-type $K$ is the same as that for unknot polygons. Moreover, the next order growth follows a power law in $n$ with an exponent that increases by one for each prime knot in the knot decomposition of $K$. We provide the first proof of this conjecture by considering knots and non-split links in tube $\mathbb{T}^*$, an $\infty \times 2\times 1$ sublattice of the simple cubic lattice. We establish upper and lower bounds relating the asymptotics of the number of $n$-edge polygons with fixed link-type in $\mathbb{T}^*$ to that of the number of $n$-edge unknots. For the upper bound, we prove that polygons can be unknotted by braid insertions. For the lower bound, we prove a pattern theorem for unknots using information from exact transfer-matrices. This work provides new knot theory results for 4-plats and new combinatorics results for lattice polygons. Connections to modelling polymers such as DNA in nanochannels are highlighted.

Title: Influence of density-dependent diffusion on pattern formation in a refuge
Authors: G. G. Piva, C. Anteneodo
Abstract: We investigate a nonlocal generalization of the Fisher-KPP equation, which incorporates logistic growth and diffusion, for a single species population in a viable patch (refuge). In this framework, diffusion plays an homogenizing role, while nonlocal interactions can destabilize the spatially uniform state, leading to the emergence of spontaneous patterns. Notably, even when the uniform state is stable, spatial perturbations, such as the presence of a refuge, can still induce patterns. These phenomena are well known for environments with constant diffusivity. Our goal is to investigate how the formation of winkles in the population distribution is affected when the diffusivity is density-dependent. Then, we explore scenarios in which diffusivity is sensitive to either rarefaction or overcrowding. We find that state-dependent diffusivity affects the shape and stability of the patterns, potentially leading to either explosive growth or fragmentation of the population distribution, depending on how diffusion reacts to changes in density.

Title: Shattering in Pure Spherical Spin Glasses
Authors: Ahmed El Alaoui, Andrea Montanari, Mark Sellke
Abstract: We prove the existence of a shattered phase within the replica-symmetric phase of the pure spherical $p$-spin models for $p$ sufficiently large. In this phase, we construct a decomposition of the sphere into well-separated small clusters, each of which has exponentially small Gibbs mass, yet which together carry all but an exponentially small fraction of the Gibbs mass. We achieve this via quantitative estimates on the derivative of the Franz--Parisi potential, which measures the Gibbs mass profile around a typical sample. Corollaries on dynamics are derived, in particular we show the two-times correlation function of stationary Langevin dynamics must have an exponentially long plateau. We further show that shattering implies disorder chaos for the Gibbs measure in the optimal transport sense; this is known to imply failure of sampling algorithms which are stable under perturbation in the same metric.

Title: The Cytnx Library for Tensor Networks
Authors: Kai-Hsin Wu, Chang-Teng Lin, Ke Hsu, Hao-Ti Hung, Manuel Schneider, Chia-Min Chung, Ying-Jer Kao, Pochung Chen
Abstract: We introduce a tensor network library designed for classical and quantum physics simulations called Cytnx (pronounced as sci-tens). This library provides almost an identical interface and syntax for both C++ and Python, allowing users to effortlessly switch between two languages. Aiming at a quick learning process for new users of tensor network algorithms, the interfaces resemble the popular Python scientific libraries like NumPy, Scipy, and PyTorch. Not only multiple global Abelian symmetries can be easily defined and implemented, Cytnx also provides a new tool called Network that allows users to store large tensor networks and perform tensor network contractions in an optimal order automatically. With the integration of cuQuantum, tensor calculations can also be executed efficiently on GPUs. We present benchmark results for tensor operations on both devices, CPU and GPU. We also discuss features and higher-level interfaces to be added in the future.

Title: A call for frugal modelling: two case studies involving molecular spin dynamics
Authors: Gerliz M. Gutiérrez-Finol, Aman Ullah, María González-Béjar, Alejandro Gaita-Ariño
Abstract: As scientists living through a climate emergency, we have a responsibility to lead by example, or to at least be consistent with our understanding of the problem. This common goal of reducing the carbon footprint of our work can be approached through a variety of strategies. For theoreticians, this includes not only optimizing algorithms and improving computational efficiency but also adopting a frugal approach to modeling. Here we present and critically illustrate this principle. First, we compare two models of very different level of sophistication which nevertheless yield the same qualitative agreement with an experiment involving electric manipulation of molecular spin qubits while presenting a difference in cost of $>4$ orders of magnitude. As a second stage, an already minimalistic model of the potential use of single-ion magnets to implement a network of probabilistic p-bits, programmed in two different programming languages, is shown to present a difference in cost of a factor of $\simeq 50$. In both examples, the computationally expensive version of the model was the one that was published. As a community, we still have a lot of room for improvement in this direction.

Title: Dephasing Enabled Fast Charging of Quantum Batteries
Authors: Rahul Shastri, Chao Jiang, Guo-Hua Xu, B. Prasanna Venkatesh, Gentaro Watanabe
Abstract: We propose and analyze a universal method to obtain fast charging of a quantum battery by a driven charger system using controlled, pure dephasing of the charger. While the battery displays coherent underdamped oscillations of energy for weak charger dephasing, the quantum Zeno freezing of the charger energy at high dephasing suppresses the rate of transfer of energy to the battery. Choosing an optimum dephasing rate between the regimes leads to a fast charging of the battery. We illustrate our results with the charger and battery modeled by either two-level systems or harmonic oscillators. Apart from the fast charging, the dephasing also renders the charging performance more robust to detuning between the charger, drive, and battery frequencies for the two-level systems case.

Title: Gradient dynamics approach to reactive thin-film hydrodynamics
Authors: Florian Voss, Uwe Thiele
Abstract: Wetting and dewetting dynamics of simple and complex liquids is described by kinetic equations in gradient dynamics form that incorporates the various coupled dissipative processes in a fully thermodynamically consistent manner. After briefly reviewing this, we also review how chemical reactions can be captured by a related gradient dynamics description, assuming detailed balanced mass action type kinetics. Then, we bring both aspects together and discuss mesoscopic reactive thin-film hydrodynamics illustrated by two examples, namely, models for reactive wetting and reactive surfactants. These models can describe the approach to equilibrium but may also be employed to study out-of-equilibrium chemo-mechanical dynamics. In the latter case, one breaks the gradient dynamics form by chemostatting to obtain active systems. In this way, for reactive wetting we recover running drops that are driven by chemically sustained wettability gradients and for drops covered by autocatalytic reactive surfactants we find complex forms of self-propulsion and self-excited oscillations.

Title: Sign problem in tensor network contraction
Authors: Jielun Chen, Jiaqing Jiang, Dominik Hangleiter, Norbert Schuch
Abstract: We investigate how the computational difficulty of contracting tensor networks depends on the sign structure of the tensor entries. Using results from computational complexity, we observe that the approximate contraction of tensor networks with only positive entries has lower complexity. This raises the question how this transition in computational complexity manifests itself in the hardness of different contraction schemes. We pursue this question by studying random tensor networks with varying bias towards positive entries. First, we consider contraction via Monte Carlo sampling, and find that the transition from hard to easy occurs when the entries become predominantly positive; this can be seen as a tensor network manifestation of the Quantum Monte Carlo sign problem. Second, we analyze the commonly used contraction based on boundary tensor networks. Its performance is governed by the amount of correlations (entanglement) in the tensor network. Remarkably, we find that the transition from hard to easy (i.e., from a volume law to a boundary law scaling of entanglement) occurs already for a slight bias towards a positive mean, and the earlier the larger the bond dimension is. This is in contrast to both expectations and the behavior found in Monte Carlo contraction. We gain further insight into this early transition from the study of an effective statmech model. Finally, we investigate the computational difficulty of computing expectation values of tensor network wavefunctions, i.e., PEPS, where we find that the complexity of entanglement-based contraction always remains low. We explain this by providing a local transformation which maps PEPS expectation values to a positive-valued tensor network. This not only provides insight into the origin of the observed boundary law entanglement scaling, but also suggests new approaches towards PEPS contraction based on positive decompositions.

Title: Field-Dependent Metrics and Higher-Form Symmetries in Duality-Invariant Theories of Non-Linear Electrodynamics
Authors: Christian Ferko, Cian Luke Martin
Abstract: We prove that a $4d$ theory of non-linear electrodynamics has equations of motion which are equivalent to those of the Maxwell theory in curved spacetime, but with the usual metric $g_{\mu \nu}$ replaced by a unit-determinant metric $h_{\mu \nu} ( F )$ which is a function of the field strength $F_{\mu \nu}$, if and only if the theory enjoys electric-magnetic duality invariance. Among duality-invariant models, the Modified Maxwell (ModMax) theory is special because the associated metric $h_{\mu \nu} ( F )$ produces identical equations of motion when it is coupled to the Maxwell theory via two different prescriptions which we describe. We use the field-dependent metric perspective to analyze the electric and magnetic $1$-form global symmetries in models of self-dual electrodynamics. This analysis suggests that any duality-invariant theory possesses a set of conserved currents $j^\mu$ which are in one-to-one correspondence with $2$-forms that are harmonic with respect to the field-dependent metric $h_{\mu \nu} ( F )$.

Title: Laser-scanning of induction-melted Al alloys: are they representative of additively manufactured ones?
Authors: Zhaoxuan Ge, Sebastian Calderon, S. Mohadeseh Taheri-Mousavi
Abstract: The bottleneck of alloy design for powder-based additive manufacturing (AM) resides in customized powder production - an expensive and time-consuming process hindering the rapid closed-loop design iterations. This study analyzed an expedited experimental workflow, i.e., multipath laser scanning of induction-melted samples, to mimic rapid solidification of AM to serve as an alternative approach to down-select from the design space. Using Al-Ni-Zr-Er model alloy, comprehensive multi-scale characterizations were performed to compare microstructural features between laser-scanned and laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) samples. Although demonstrating a difference in melt pool geometries, the microstructures in scanning electron microscopy (SEM)- and transmission electron microscopy (TEM)- scale demonstrate a high degree of similarity, in terms of microstructure morphology, grain size, presence of precipitates, and phase distribution. The mechanical performance was evaluated by microhardness tests. The results revealed a 20% reduction in laser-scanned samples compared to LPBF samples, attributed to the thermal history and potential differences in phase fractions. The decreasing trend was also observed in the benchmark alloy showing a 10% absolute error with respect to the model alloy. This study underscores the potential of this workflow to accelerate alloy design in AM by circumventing customized powder production and encourages further exploration across diverse materials and processing parameters.

Title: Cyclic solid-state quantum battery: Thermodynamic characterization and quantum hardware simulation
Authors: Luca Razzoli, Giulia Gemme, Ilia Khomchenko, Maura Sassetti, Henni Ouerdane, Dario Ferraro, Giuliano Benenti
Abstract: We introduce a cyclic quantum battery model, based on an interacting bipartite system, weakly coupled to a thermal bath. The working cycle of the battery consists of four strokes: system thermalization, disconnection of subsystems, ergotropy extraction, and reconnection. The thermal bath acts as a charger in the thermalization stroke, while ergotropy extraction is possible because the ensuing thermal state is no longer passive after the disconnection stroke. Focusing on the case of two interacting qubits, we show that phase coherence, in the presence of non-trivial correlations between the qubits, can be exploited to reach working regimes with efficiency higher than 50% while providing finite ergotropy. Our protocol is illustrated through a simple and feasible circuit model of a cyclic superconducting quantum battery. Furthermore, we simulate the considered cycle on superconducting IBM quantum machines. The good agreement between the theoretical and simulated results strongly suggests that our scheme for cyclic quantum batteries can be successfully realized in superconducting quantum hardware.

Title: Entangling power, gate typicality, and measurement-induced phase transitions
Authors: Sourav Manna, Vaibhav Madhok, Arul Lakshminarayan
Abstract: When subject to a non-local unitary evolution, qubits in a quantum circuit become increasingly entangled. Conversely, measurements applied to individual qubits lead to their disentanglement from the collective system. The extent of entanglement reduction depends on the frequency of local projective measurements. A delicate balance emerges between unitary evolution, which enhances entanglement, and measurements which diminish it. In the thermodynamic limit, there is a phase transition from volume law entanglement to area law entanglement at a critical value of measurement frequency. This phenomenon, occurring in hybrid quantum circuits with both unitary gates and measurements, is termed as measurement-induced phase transition (MIPT). We study the behavior of MIPT in circuits comprising of two qubit unitary gates parameterized by Cartan decomposition. We show that the entangling power and gate typicality of the two-qubit local unitaries employed in the circuit can be used to explain the behavior of global bipartite entanglement the circuit can sustain. When the two qubit gate throughout the circuit is the identity and measurements are the sole driver of the entanglement behavior, we obtain analytical estimate for the entanglement entropy that shows remarkable agreement with numerical simulations. We also find that the entangling power and gate typicality enable the classification of the two-qubit unitaries by different universality classes of phase transitions that can occur in the hybrid circuit. For all unitaries in a particular universality class, the transition from volume to area law of entanglement occurs with same exponent that characterizes the phase transition.

Title: Universal corrections to the superfluid gap in a cold Fermi gas
Authors: Silas R. Beane, Zeno Capatti, Roland C. Farrell
Abstract: A framework for computing the superfluid gap in an effective field theory (EFT) of fermions interacting via momentum-independent contact forces is developed. The leading universal corrections in the EFT are one-loop in-medium effects at the Fermi surface, and reproduce the well-known Gor'kov-Melik-Barkhudarov result. The complete subleading universal corrections are presented here, and include one-loop effects away from the Fermi surface, two-loop in-medium effects, as well as modifications to the fermion propagator. Together, these effects are found to reduce the gap at low densities. Applications to neutron superfluidity in neutron stars are also discussed.

Title: The Role of Superlattice Phonons in Charge Localization Across Quantum Dot Arrays
Authors: Bokang Hou, Matthew Coley-O'Rourke, Uri Banin, Michael Thoss, Eran Rabani
Abstract: Understanding charge transport in semiconductor quantum dot (QD) assemblies is important for developing the next generation of solar cells and light-harvesting devices based on QD technology. One of the key factors that governs the transport in such systems is related to the hybridization between the QDs. Recent experiments have successfully synthesized QD molecules, arrays, and assemblies by directly fusing the QDs, with enhanced hybridization leading to high carrier mobilities and coherent band-like electronic transport. In this work, we theoretically investigate the electron transfer dynamics across a finite CdSe-CdS core-shell QD array, considering up to seven interconnected QDs in one dimension. We find that, even in the absence of structural and size disorder, electron transfer can become localized by the emergent low-frequency superlattice vibrational modes when the connecting neck between QDs is narrow. On the other hand, we also identify a regime where the same vibrational modes facilitate coherent electron transport when the connecting necks are wide. Overall, we elucidate the crucial effects of electronic and superlattice symmetries and their couplings when designing high-mobility devices based on QD superlattices.

Title: Observation of condensed moire exciton polaritons in twisted photonic lattices at room temperature
Authors: Chunzi Xing, Yu Wang, Tobias Schneider, Xiaokun Zhai, Xinzheng Zhang, Zhenyu Xiong, Hao Wu, Yuan Ren, Haitao Dai, Xiao Wang, Anlian Pan, Stefan Schumacher, Xuekai Ma, Tingge Gao
Abstract: Moire lattices attract significant attention in double-layer graphene and TMD layer heterostructures as well as in photonic crystals due to the interesting exotic physics that emerges within these structures. However, direct measurement of the moiré ground, excited states and Bloch bands in twisted photonic lattices is still illusive. In this work we report strong coupling between excitons in CsPbBr3 microplates and moire photonic modes at room temperature. Depending on the coupling strength between the nearest potential sites, we observe staggered moire polariton ground states, excited states and moire polariton bands. Phase locked moire zero (in-phase) states and moire pi (antiphase) states with different spatial distributions are measured. The moire polariton distribution can be tuned into the shape of a parallelogram by controlling the depth and width of the potential in one photonic lattice with another superimposed one fixed. In addition, moire polaritons in twisted 2D honeycomb lattices are also observed. Increasing the pumping density, we realize exciton polariton condensation in the moire potential sites of the 1D/2D twisted lattices with the coherence time of around 1.4 ps. Our work lays the foundation to study coherent moire polariton condensation in twisted photonic lattices at room temperature.

Title: Harnessing the natural resonances of time-varying dispersive interfaces
Authors: Carlo Rizza, Maria Antonietta Vincenti, Giuseppe Castaldi, Alessandra Contestabile, Vincenzo Galdi, Michael Scalora
Abstract: Space-time modulation of electromagnetic parameters offers novel exciting possibilities for advanced field manipulations. In this study, we explore wave scattering from a time-varying interface characterized by a Lorentz-type dispersion with a step-like temporal variation in its parameters. Our findings reveal a new process: an unconventional frequency generation at the natural resonances of the system. Remarkably, this phenomenon enables the coupling of propagating waves to evanescent ones, allowing the direct far-field excitation of surface-wave modes without the mediation of spatial gratings or prisms. These results suggest a novel strategy for designing compact and ultra-fast photonic devices, eliminating the necessity for subwavelength spatial structuring or prolonged temporal modulations.

Title: Network reconstruction may not mean dynamics prediction
Authors: Zhendong Yu, Haiping Huang
Abstract: With an increasing amount of observations on the dynamics of many complex systems, it is required to reveal the underlying mechanisms behind these complex dynamics, which is fundamentally important in many scientific fields such as climate, financial, ecological, and neural systems. The underlying mechanisms are commonly encoded into network structures, e.g., capturing how constituents interact with each other to produce emergent behavior. Here, we address whether a good network reconstruction suggests a good dynamics prediction. The answer is quite dependent on the nature of the supplied (observed) dynamics sequences measured on the complex system. When the dynamics are not chaotic, network reconstruction implies dynamics prediction. In contrast, even if a network can be well reconstructed from the chaotic time series (chaos means that many unstable dynamics states coexist), the prediction of the future dynamics can become impossible as at some future point the prediction error will be amplified. This is explained by using dynamical mean-field theory on a toy model of random recurrent neural networks.

Title: Information geometry approach to quantum stochastic thermodynamics
Authors: Laetitia P. Bettmann, John Goold
Abstract: Recent advancements have revealed new links between information geometry and classical stochastic thermodynamics, particularly through the Fisher information (FI) with respect to time. Recognizing the non-uniqueness of the quantum Fisher metric in Hilbert space, we exploit the fact that any quantum Fisher information (QFI) can be decomposed into a metric-independent incoherent part and a metric-dependent coherent contribution. We demonstrate that the incoherent component of any QFI can be directly linked to entropic acceleration, and for GKSL dynamics with local detailed balance, to the rate of change of generalised thermodynamic forces and entropic flow, paralleling the classical results. Furthermore, we tighten a classical uncertainty relation between the geometric uncertainty of a path in state space and the time-averaged rate of information change and demonstrate that it also holds for quantum systems. We generalise a classical geometric bound on the entropy rate for far-from-equilibrium processes by incorporating a non-negative quantum contribution that arises from the geometric action due to coherent dynamics. Finally, we apply an information-geometric analysis to the recently proposed quantum-thermodynamic Mpemba effect, demonstrating this framework's ability to capture thermodynamic phenomena.

Title: Geometric Formula for 2d Ising Zeros: Examples & Numerics
Authors: Iñaki Garay, Etera R. Livine
Abstract: A geometric formula for the zeros of the partition function of the inhomogeneous 2d Ising model was recently proposed in terms of the angles of 2d triangulations embedded in the flat 3d space. Here we proceed to an analytical check of this formula on the cubic graph, dual to a double pyramid, and provide a thorough numerical check by generating random 2d planar triangulations. Our method is to generate Delaunay triangulations of the 2-sphere then performing random local rescalings. For every 2d triangulations, we compute the corresponding Ising couplings from the triangle angles and the dihedral angles, and check directly that the Ising partition function vanishes for these couplings (and grows in modulus in their neighborhood). In particular, we lift an ambiguity of the original formula on the sign of the dihedral angles and establish a convention in terms of convexity/concavity. Finally, we extend our numerical analysis to 2d toroidal triangulations and show that the geometric formula does not work and will need to be generalized, as originally expected, in order to accommodate for non-trivial topologies.

Title: Quantum jumps in amplitude bistability: tracking a coherent and invertible state localization
Authors: Th. K. Mavrogordatos
Abstract: We investigate the nature of quantum jumps occurring between macroscopic metastable states of light in the open driven Jaynes-Cummings model. We find that, in the limit of zero spontaneous emission considered in [H. J. Carmichael, Phys. Rev. X 5, 031028 (2015)], the jumps from a high-photon state to the vacuum state entail two stages. The first part is coherent and modelled by the localization of a state superposition, in the example of a null-measurement record predicted by quantum trajectory theory. The underlying evolution is mediated by an unstable state (which often splits to a complex of states), identified by the conditioned density matrix and the corresponding quasiprobability distribution of the cavity field. The unstable state subsequently decays to the vacuum to complete the jump. Coherence in the localization allows for inverting the null-measurement photon average about its initial value, to account for the full switch which typically lasts a small fraction of the cavity lifetime. This mechanism is contrasted to the jumps leading from the vacuum to the high-photon state in the bistable signal. Spontaneous emission degrades coherence in the localization, and prolongs the jumps.

Title: From Landau two-fluid model to de Sitter Universe
Authors: G.E. Volovik
Abstract: The condensed matter analogs are useful for consideration of the phenomena related to the quantum vacuum. This is because in condensed matter we know physics both in the infrared and in the ultraviolet limits, while in particle physics and gravity the physics at trans-Planckian scale is unknown. One of the corner stones of the connections between the non-relativistic condensed matter and the modern relativistic theories is the two-fluid hydrodynamics of superfluid helium. The dynamics and thermodynamics of the de Sitter state of the expansion of the Universe bear some features of the multi-fluid system. There are actually three components: the quantum vacuum, the gravitational component and relativistic matter. The expanding de Sitter vacuum serves as the thermal bath with local temperature, which is twice the Gibbons-Hawking temperature related to the cosmological horizon. This local temperature leads to the heating of matter component and the gravitational component. The latter behaves as Zel'dovich stiff matter and represents the dark matter. In equilibrium and in the absence of the conventional matter the positive partial pressure of dark matter compensates the negative partial pressure of quantum vacuum. That is why in the full equilibrium the total pressure is zero. This is similar to the superfluid and normal components in superfluids, which together produce the zero pressure of the liquid in the absence of environment. If one assumes that in dynamics, the gravitational dark matter behaves as the real Zel'dovich stiff matter, one obtains that both components experience the power law decay due to the energy exchange between these components. Then it follows that their values at present time have the correct order of magnitude. We also consider the other problems through the prism of condensed matter physics, including the black holes and Planck constant.

Title: Deformation of Matrix Geometry via Landau Level Evolution
Authors: Kazuki Hasebe
Abstract: We propose a scheme for the construction of deformed matrix geometries using Landau models. The Landau models are practically useful tools to extract matrix geometries. The level projection method however cannot be applied straightforwardly to the Landau models on deformed manifolds, as they do not generally exhibit degenerate energy levels. We overcome this problem by exploiting the idea of spectral flow. Taking a symmetric matrix geometry as a reference point of the spectral flow, we evolve the matrix geometry by deforming the Landau model. In this process, unitarity is automatically preserved. The explicit matrix realization of the coordinates is derived mechanically even for a non-perturbative deformation. We clarify basic properties of the deformed matrix geometries through a concrete analysis of the non-relativistic and relativistic Landau models on expanding two-sphere and elongating ellipsoid. The obtained ellipsoidal matrix geometries show behaviors quantitatively different in each Landau level, but qualitatively similar to their classical counterpart. We also numerically investigate the differences between the ellipsoidal matrix geometry and the fuzzy ellipsoid.

Title: On computational complexity of unitary and state design properties
Authors: Yoshifumi Nakata, Yuki Takeuchi, Martin Kliesch, Andrew Darmawan
Abstract: We investigate unitary and state $t$-designs from a computational complexity perspective. First, we address the problems of computing frame potentials that characterize (approximate) $t$-designs. We present a quantum algorithm for computing frame potentials and establish the following: (1) exact computation can be achieved by a single query to a $\# \textsf{P}$-oracle and is $\# \textsf{P}$-hard; (2) for state vectors, deciding whether the frame potential is larger than or smaller than certain values is $\textsf{BQP}$-complete, provided the promise gap between the two values is inverse-polynomial in the number of qubits; and (3) for both state vectors and unitaries, this promise problem is $\textsf{PP}$-complete if the promise gap is exponentially small. Second, we address the promise problems of determining whether a given set is a good or bad approximation to a $t$-design. We show that this problem is in $\textsf{PP}$ for any constant $t$ and is $\textsf{PP}$-hard for $t=1,2$ and $3$. Remarkably, this remains true even when the set is promised to be either exponentially close to or no closer than a constant to a $1$-design, particularly illustrating that, while unitary and state designs are powerful information resources, it is inherently hard to determine their properties. We further identify the implications of our results across diverse areas, including variational methods for constructing designs, diagnosing quantum chaos through out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs), and exploring emergent designs in Hamiltonian systems.

Title: Proposal for a Bell Test with Entangled Atoms of Different Mass
Authors: X. T. Yan, S. Kannan, Y. S. Athreya, A. G. Truscott, S. S. Hodgman
Abstract: We propose a Bell test experiment using momentum-entangled atom pairs of different masses, specifically metastable helium isotopes 3He* and 4He*, though the method extends to other atom species. Entanglement is generated via collisions, after which the quantum states are manipulated using two independent atom interferometers, enabling precise phase control over each species. Numerical simulations predict a significant violation of Bell's inequality under realistic conditions. This proposal opens a new paradigm to study the intersection of quantum mechanics and gravity.

Title: Circuit Quantisation from First Principles
Authors: Yun-Chih Liao, Ben J. Powell, Thomas M. Stace
Abstract: Superconducting circuit quantisation conventionally starts from classical Euler-Lagrange circuit equations-of-motion. Invoking the correspondence principle yields a canonically quantised circuit description of circuit dynamics over a bosonic Hilbert space. This process has been very successful for describing experiments, but implicitly starts from the classical Ginsberg-Landau (GL) mean field theory for the circuit. Here we employ a different approach which starts from a microscopic fermionic Hamiltonian for interacting electrons, whose ground space is described by the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) many-body wavefuction that underpins conventional superconductivity. We introduce the BCS ground-space as a subspace of the full fermionic Hilbert space, and show that projecting the electronic Hamiltonian onto this subspace yields the standard Hamiltonian terms for Josephson junctions, capacitors and inductors, from which standard quantised circuit models follow. Importantly, this approach does not assume a spontaneously broken symmetry, which is important for quantised circuits that support superpositions of phases, and the phase-charge canonical commutation relations are derived from the underlying fermionic commutation properties, rather than imposed. By expanding the projective subspace, this approach can be extended to describe phenomena outside the BCS ground space, including quasiparticle excitations.

Title: Orthogonal Geometry of Magneto-Optical Kerr Effect Enabled by Magnetization Multipole of Berry Curvature
Authors: Haolin Pan, Han Li, Jixiang Huang, Zheng Liu, Mingyue Fang, Yanan Yuan, Daxiang Liu, Xintong Hu, Wenzhi Peng, Zhenguo Liang, Xiao Chang, Zhigao Sheng, Xianzhe Chen, Lingfei Wang, Qian Li, Peng Li, Qian Niu, Yang Gao, Qinghui Yang, Dazhi Hou
Abstract: The Magneto-Optical Kerr Effect (MOKE) is a fundamental tool in magnetometry, pivotal for advancing research in optics, magnetism, and spintronics as a direct probe of magnetization. Traditional MOKE measurements primarily detect the magnetization components parallel to the Poynting vector, which can only access the magnitude but not the direction of the orthogonal component. In this study, we introduce an orthogonal MOKE geometry in which the Kerr signal detects both the magnitude and direction of the magnetization component perpendicular to the Poynting vector. We demonstrate the broad applicability of this orthogonal geometry through the MOKE measurements in cubic ferromagnets and van der Waals ferromagnet. We theoretically show that the orthogonal MOKE geometry is enabled by the multipolar structure of Berry curvature in the magnetization space, which generally induces a Voigt vector orthogonal to the magnetization, thereby accounting for the unique magnetization angle dependence distinct from conventional MOKE. The establishment of the orthogonal MOKE geometry not only introduces a new paradigm for magneto-optical measurements but also provides a framework for exploring the magnetization multipoles of Berry curvature across the electromagnetic spectrum.

Title: Magnon Blockade with Skyrmion Qubit-Magnon Coupling in a Hybrid Quantum System
Authors: Si-Tong Jin (1), Shi-Wen He (1), Zi-Long Yang (1), Xuanxuan Xin (2), Chong Li (1)
Abstract: Magnon blockade is a fundamental quantum phenomenon for generating single-magnon state, which gradually becomes one of the candidates for quantum information processing. In this paper, we propose a theoretical scheme to generate the magnon blockade in a hybrid system consisting of a YIG micromagnet and a skyrmion. Considering weak probing of the magnon and driving of the skyrmion qubit, the second-order correlation function is analytically derived, and the optimal condition for realizing the magnon blockade is identified. Under the optimal condition, we systematically analyze the behavior of the second-order correlation function $g^{(2)}(0)$ under different parameter regimes. Our analysis shows that with appropriate driving and probing field intensities, the magnon blockade effect can be significantly enhanced, effectively suppressing multi-magnon states and facilitating the generation of high-purity single-magnon states exhibiting pronounced antibunching. Furthermore, we explore the physical mechanisms underlying the magnon blockade, revealing the coexistence and interplay of conventional and unconventional magnon blockade. This scheme provides a versatile all-magnetic platform for generating high purity single-magnon sources.

Title: Streamlined Krylov construction and classification of ergodic Floquet systems
Authors: Nikita Kolganov, Dmitrii A. Trunin
Abstract: We generalize Krylov construction to periodically driven (Floquet) quantum systems using the theory of orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle. Compared to other approaches, our method works faster and maps any quantum dynamics to a one-dimensional tight-binding Krylov chain, which is efficiently simulated on both classical and quantum computers. We also suggest a classification of chaotic and integrable Floquet systems based on the asymptotic behavior of Krylov chain hopping parameters (Verblunsky coefficients). We illustrate this classification with random matrix ensembles, kicked top, and kicked Ising chain.

Title: Structural Changes and Percolation Transition in Networks after Aging Processes
Authors: Ryuho Sekikawa, Hiroshi Watanabe
Abstract: In social networking services, users constantly change, and the network structure changes simultaneously. As the network structure changes, so does the word-of-mouth within it. To study how information transfer on the network changes with the aging of the network, we investigated the relation of the structure and the percolation in the aged networks. We first prepared the Bianconi-Barabási model as the initial network and observed the time evolution of its properties by repeatedly deleting and adding nodes. We introduced two tunable parameters, the deleting parameter $\alpha$ and the adding parameter $\beta$, and observed the aging behavior for the various parameter sets. We found that the network did not reach its steady state depending on the parameters. We also found that when the network is stable, there is a parameter region where the degree distribution changes from power-law to exponential decay. We performed the percolation analyses and found that the behavior of the percolation probability changes simultaneously with changes in the network's structure. This study is expected to help control network structure in steady-state aged networks.

Title: Entanglement transition in a cluster spin chain coupled with free spins
Authors: Kevissen Sellapillay, Laurent Raymond, Alberto D. Verga
Abstract: We investigate the entanglement of a ladder of spins formed by two sublattices, a ''cluster'' chain and the ''environment'', consisting of independent spins, both coupled by an exchange interaction and evolving under a unitary discrete time dynamics. The automaton is defined by the composition of the two body spin swap gate (between sublattices) and the three body cluster interaction. We observe that, depending on the set of coupling constants, the cluster subsystem evolves towards states corresponding to different entanglement phases. In the weak coupling regime the subsystem remains near the topological cluster state. Increasing the coupling strength leads to random states which transform from almost pure to fully mixed, according to the effective number of the environment active degrees of freedom.

Title: Annealed mean-field epidemiological model on scale-free networks with a mitigating factor
Authors: K. M. Kim, M. O. Hase
Abstract: An annealed version of the quenched mean-field model for epidemic spread is introduced and investigated analytically and assisted by numerical calculations. The interaction between individuals follows a prescription that is used to generate a scale-free network, and we have adjusted the number of connections to produce a sparse network. Specifically, the model's behavior near the infection threshold is examined, as well as the behavior of the stationary prevalence and the probability that a connection between individuals encounters an infected one. We found that these functions display a monotonically increasing dependence on the infection rate. Subsequently, a modification that mimics the mitigation in the probability of encountering an infected individual is introduced, following an old idea rooted in the Malthus-Verhulst model. We found that this modification drastically changes the probability that a connection meets an infected individual. However, despite this change, it does not alter the monotonically increasing behavior of the stationary prevalence.

Title: Gapless higher-order topology and corner states in Floquet systems
Authors: Longwen Zhou, Rongtao Wang, Jiaxin Pan
Abstract: Higher-order topological phases (HOTPs) possess localized and symmetry-protected eigenmodes at corners and along hinges in two and three dimensional lattices. The numbers of these topological boundary modes will undergo quantized changes at the critical points between different HOTPs. In this work, we reveal unique higher-order topology induced by time-periodic driving at the critical points of topological phase transitions, which has no equilibrium counterparts and also goes beyond the description of gapped topological matter. Using an alternately coupled Creutz ladder and its Floquet-driven descendants as illustrative examples, we analytically characterize and numerically demonstrate the zero and $\pi$ corner modes that could emerge at the critical points between different Floquet HOTPs. Moreover, we propose a unified scheme of bulk-corner correspondence for both gapless and gapped Floquet HOTPs protected by chiral symmetry in two dimensions. Our work reveals the possibility of corner modes surviving topological transitions in Floquet systems and initializes the study of higher-order Floquet topology at quantum criticality.
