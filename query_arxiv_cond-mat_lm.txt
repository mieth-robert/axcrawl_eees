Title: Heterogeneity dominates irreversibility in random Markov models
Authors: Faheem Mosam, Eric De Giuli
Abstract: We introduce a two-parameter ensemble of random discrete-time Markov models that simultaneously captures critical slowing down and broken detailed balance. Extending a previously studied heterogeneous Markov ensemble, we incorporate correlations between forward and backward transition rates through a single asymmetry parameter $\gamma$, while heterogeneity is controlled by $\epsilon$. Using results from random matrix theory, we identify a critical locus $\epsilon_c(\gamma,N)$ at which relaxation times diverge and spectral universality breaks down. We characterize the behavior of entropy production, predictive information, and relaxation dynamics across the ensemble, showing that many observables depend strongly on heterogeneity but only weakly on asymmetry, except near the symmetric limit. Applying maximum-likelihood inference to human fMRI and EEG data, we find that both modalities operate near the predicted critical locus and occupy a similar region of the $\epsilon-\gamma$ plane, supporting a super-universality of human brain dynamics. While ensemble averages are well captured by the null model, empirical data exhibit substantially enhanced variability, indicating subject-specific structure beyond random expectations. Our results unify criticality and nonequilibrium measures within a single framework and clarify their intertwined role in the analysis of complex biological dynamics.

Title: From Literature to Lab: Closed-Loop Advancement of Perovskite Solar Cells via Domain Knowledge Guided LLM
Authors: Penglei Sun, Shuyan Chen, Xiang Liu, Longhan Zhang, Huajie You, Chang Yan, Yongqi Zhang, Xiaowen Chu, Tong-yi Zhang
Abstract: Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been considered as a next-generation disruptive photovoltaic technology, yet their advancement is constrained by the complexity of perovskite recipe with high-dimensional material and process design space. Despite the impressive general reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs), they struggle with two limitations for application in PSCs: an inability to align general semantics with the perovskite domain knowledge, and an inefficiency in navigating high-dimensional perovskite material and recipe design spaces. To address these limitations, we introduce a domain-knowledge-guided framework PVK-LLM, a specialized model to serve as an expert to bridge general semantics with perovskite domain knowledge. By integrating this domain knowledge into a hierarchical Bayesian Optimization workflow, our approach efficiently navigates the high-dimension design space on a solar cell simulator platform. The domain knowledge resolves cold-start problems while dynamically adapting to simulator feedback. Moreover, in an individual wet-lab experiment aimed at maximizing power conversion efficiency (PCE), our framework autonomously proposes a novel synergistic four-component recipe comprising specialized organic passivation recipe (3MTPAI, PDAI2, EDAI2, and PipDI) which has not been reported in existing literature. This AI-designed recipe effectively achieves a champion PCE value of over 26.0 %, approaching world records achieved through extensive expert trial-and-error. Our approach can effectively enable LLM comprehend the domain knowledge, which can efficiently navigate in a high-dimensional, capable to accelerate the advancement in real-world perovskite as well as other material science development.

Title: Graph--Theoretic Analysis of Phase Optimization Complexity in Variational Wave Functions for Heisenberg Antiferromagnets
Authors: Mahmud Ashraf Shamim, Moshiur Rahman, Mohamed Hibat-Allah, Paulo T Araujo
Abstract: Despite extensive study, the phase structure of the wavefunctions in frustrated Heisenberg antiferromagnets (HAF) is not yet systematically characterized. In this work, we represent the Hilbert space of an HAF as a weighted graph, which we term the Hilbert graph (HG), whose vertices are spin configurations and whose edges are generated by off-diagonal spin-flip terms of the Heisenberg Hamiltonian, with weights set by products of wavefunction amplitudes. Holding the amplitudes fixed and restricting phases to $\mathbb{Z}_2$ values, the phase-dependent variational energy can be recast as a classical Ising antiferromagnet on the HG, so that phase reconstruction of the ground state reduces to a weighted Max-Cut instance. This shows that phase reconstruction HAF is worst-case NP-hard and provides a direct link between wavefunction sign structure and combinatorial optimization.

Title: Incommensurate pair-density-wave correlations in two-leg ladder $t$--$J$--$J_\perp$ model
Authors: Hanbit Oh, Julian May-Mann, Ya-Hui Zhang
Abstract: We report the discovery of a generalized Luther-Emery liquid phase characterized by incommensurate pair-density-wave (iC-PDW) correlations in the two-leg $t$-$J$-$J_\perp$ ladder model. By tuning the potential difference between the legs, we explore the regime of intermediate layer polarization $P$. Combining density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations with bosonization analysis, we identify a spin-gapped phase at finite $P$, where the interlayer and intralayer pair correlations both oscillate, but with distinct periodicities. The interlayer correlations exhibit FFLO-like oscillations, driven by pairing between layers with mismatched Fermi momenta, with a period determined by their momentum difference. In contrast, the intralayer pair correlations arise from the coupling between charges on one layer and spin fluctuations on the opposite layer, with a momentum equal to twice the Fermi momentum of the opposite layer. The iC-PDW state is robust across a wide range of doping and polarization, although finite interlayer hopping eventually destabilizes it toward a state with charge-$4e$ correlations. We conclude by discussing the experimental realization of this model in optical lattice platforms and its relevance to the bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.

Title: Towards $2+1$D quantum electrodynamics on a cold-atom quantum simulator
Authors: Peter Majcen, Jesse J. Osborne, Philipp Hauke, Bing Yang, Simone Montangero, Jad C. Halimeh
Abstract: Cold atoms have become a powerful platform for quantum-simulating lattice gauge theories in higher spatial dimensions. However, such realizations have been restricted to the lowest possible truncations of the gauge field, which limit the connections one can make to lattice quantum electrodynamics. Here, we propose a feasible cold-atom quantum simulator of a $(2+1)$-dimensional U$(1)$ lattice gauge theory in a spin $S=1$ truncation, featuring dynamical matter and gauge fields. We derive a mapping of this theory onto a bosonic computational basis, stabilized by an emergent gauge-protection mechanism through quantum Zeno dynamics. The implementation is based on a single-species Bose--Hubbard model realized in a tilted optical superlattice. This approach requires only moderate experimental resources already available in current ultracold-atom platforms. Using infinite matrix product state simulations, we benchmark real-time dynamics under global quenches. The results demonstrate faithful evolution of the target gauge theory and robust preservation of the gauge constraints. Our work significantly advances the experimental prospects for simulating higher-dimensional lattice gauge theories using larger gauge-field truncations.

Title: Information, Dissipation, and Planckian Optimality
Authors: Debanjan Chowdhury
Abstract: We derive a universal bound on the efficiency with which "dissipated" work can generate distinguishable changes in a quantum many-body state at a finite temperature, as quantified by the quantum Fisher information. The bound follows solely from the analytic structure of equilibrium many-body correlators and is independent of all microscopic details. It takes a frequency-resolved form with a characteristic crossover at the Planckian scale, $\omega_\star\sim k_B T/\hbar$. We find that Planckian scatterers sit at the edge of optimality, displaying maximal relaxation rate before information-dissipation efficiency collapses. This suggests strange metals are not just fast dissipators, but the fastest that remain efficient in generating distinguishability. The bounded quantity can be evaluated directly from optical conductivity measurements in strongly correlated electronic systems, offering a unique window into how dissipation generates distinguishable changes.

Title: Constraints on stability and renormalization group flows in nonequilibrium matter
Authors: Yu-Hsueh Chen, Tarun Grover
Abstract: We derive constraints on renormalization group (RG) flows and stability of phases in nonequilibrium systems using quantum information inequalities. These constraints involve conditional mutual information (CMI), which quantifies correlations between spatially separated regions not mediated by their surroundings. First, assuming CMI is UV finite, we show that the scaling function associated with CMI is monotonic along the RG flow. This implies a non-perturbative stability criterion: a fixed point with smaller CMI cannot be destabilized toward one with larger CMI. Second, we bound the CMI of a convex mixture of states in terms of the CMI of individual components. We use this inequality to infer perturbative stability of spontaneous symmetry breaking states against quantum channels that explicitly break symmetry. We illustrate these constraints through several examples, including decoherence-driven transitions in classical symmetry-broken states, strong-to-weak symmetry breaking criticality in two dimensions, and even transitions in pure quantum states. We also discuss implications for classical nonequilibrium steady states.

Title: Best practices for a proper evaluation and conversion of physical property equations in superconductors: the examples of WHH formulation, Bean model and other cases of interest
Authors: Chiara Tarantini, Evgeny F. Talantsev, Ilaria Pallecchi, Jens Hänisch, Jeffery L. Tallon, David C. Larbalestier
Abstract: In recent years there have been growing concerns about the proper evaluation of physical properties of superconductors, in particular for quantities extracted from magnetic characterizations. Errors can and often do occur due to the following issues: i) several measurement instruments still use Gaussian & cgs-emu units instead of the preferable International System (SI) units; ii) there are decades of valuable publications where, however, equations were expressed in Gaussian & cgs-emu or other unit systems or where constants were normalized to unity, which requires proper understanding and unit conversion in order to correctly evaluate the measured physical quantities; iii) the conversion between unit systems sometimes appears challenging and may not be properly performed. In this paper we will describe how to properly convert physical quantities relevant for the evaluation of magnetic and other properties focusing on the still most used unit systems, SI and Gaussian & cgs-emu. We will provide examples of how to properly verify and understand the physical formulae. We will include examples for the correct method to determine the critical current density Jc of a superconductor from the measurement of its magnetic hysteresis loop through the Bean model, and the correct conversion to SI of the equations for Hc2(T) according to the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) formulation. The goals of this paper are to make the readers aware of the unit conversion issue, to provide useful hands-on tools for proper conversion and to strongly encourage future exclusive use of the SI units and formulae.

Title: Metastability and ripening of multi-component liquid mixtures
Authors: Giacomo Bartolucci, Fabrizio Olmeda
Abstract: Understanding how multi-component liquid mixtures undergo phase separation is central to elucidating biophysical organization in the cell. Here, combining analytical and numerical results, we characterise the dynamics of mixtures with disordered interactions among the components. We first study how two coexisting phases become unstable, leading to multiphase coexistence. We then show that the scaling of droplet radius as $t^{1/3}$ and droplet number as $n^{-2/3}$, characteristic of Ostwald ripening in two dimensions, can be severely delayed. This delay arises from glass-like relaxation and the emergence of long-lived metastable states characterized by different wetting angles.

Title: Josephson Dynamics of 2D Bose-Einstein Condensates in Dual-Core Trap: Homogeneous, Droplet-Droplet, and Vortex-Vortex Regimes
Authors: Sherzod R. Otajonov, Fatkhulla Kh. Abdullaev
Abstract: The dynamics of a two-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate mixture, loaded into a dual-core trap, when beyond-mean-field effects are taken into account, are considered. The effects of quantum fluctuations are described by the Lee-Huang-Yang correction terms in the extended coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations. The spatially uniform and inhomogeneous BEC cases are studied. In the first case, the parameter regimes associated with macroscopic quantum tunnelling, self-trapping, and revival-like localisation dynamics are found. The Josephson oscillation frequencies for both the zero-phase and the $\pi$-phase modes are derived. As the total atom number varies, the dynamics exhibit a nontrivial bifurcation structure: along the zero-phase branch, two pitchfork bifurcations generate bistability and hysteresis, while the $\pi$-phase branch shows a single pitchfork bifurcation. In the second case, the Josephson dynamics for quantum droplets and vortices are investigated. Predictions for the oscillation frequencies of the atomic population between quantum droplets are obtained and fully validated by direct numerical simulations of coupled extended GP equations. The existence of the Andreev-Bashkin nondissipative drag through simulations of droplet-droplet interactions is shown. The Josephson dynamics of vortex states are studied. Vortices with topological charge $S$ and sufficiently small particle number are typically unstable, breaking up into $S+1$ (occasionally $S+2$) fundamental fragments, with the breakup time increasing as the particle number grows. Unstable asymmetric vortices show splitting and/or crescent-like instability. For vortices with sufficiently large norms, long-time simulations confirm robust stability against small perturbations; in this regime, Josephson oscillations and Andreev-Bashkin-type entrainment for vortex states with charges $S=1, 2$, and $3$ are investigated.

Title: Instability of G/M/c queues under stochastic resetting in the interval
Authors: José Giral-Barajas, Paul C. Bressloff
Abstract: Proper management of resources whose arrival and consumption are subject to environmental randomness is an intrinsic process in both natural and artificial systems. This phenomenon can be modeled as a queuing process whose arrival distribution is determined by a search process with stochastic resetting. When the queuing system has a limited number of servers and the search process occurs within a bounded domain, the dynamics of expediting or delaying the search through stochastic resetting interact with the long-term dynamics of the number of resources in the queue. We combine results from queuing theory with those from search processes with stochastic resetting in a bounded domain to obtain regions of the parameter space of the search process that ensure convergence of the number of resources in the queue to a steady state. Furthermore, we find a threshold resetting rate at which the effects of stochastic resetting shift from reducing convergence regions to expanding them. Finally, we demonstrate that this threshold value grows exponentially with the number of servers, making it harder for stochastic resetting to improve the convergence of the queueing system.

Title: Minimal Hamiltonian deformations as bulk probes of effective non-Hermiticity in Dirac materials
Authors: Sergio Pino-Alarcón, Juan Pablo Esparza, Vladimir Juričić
Abstract: Non-Hermitian (NH) Dirac semimetals describe open gain--loss systems, yet at charge neutrality models featuring real spectrum often look Hermitian-like, with NH effects absorbed into renormalized band parameters. Here we show that a response-based diagnostic of effective non-Hermiticity can be formulated using minimal pseudo-Lorentz-symmetry-breaking deformations, which separate observables that remain captured by parameter redefinitions from those that exhibit irreducible NH structure. For a two-dimensional NH Dirac semimetal in the weak-NH, real-spectrum regime, we analyze Dirac-cone tilt and velocity anisotropy and compute representative probes of spectral structure, quantum geometry, optical response, and viscoelasticity at zero temperature. We find that tilt yields an NH-dependent slope of the density of states that cannot be collapsed to a single effective velocity, while velocity anisotropy can be captured by effective-velocity reparametrization. Furthermore, the quantum metric and collisionless optical conductivities provide NH-insensitive benchmarks (with the nonlinear conductivity symmetry selected), whereas the shear viscosity offers a discriminator through its tensor structure. Our results identify minimal deformations and bulk response channels that enable access to effective non-Hermiticity even when the spectrum remains real.

Title: Strong radial electric field scaling near nanoscale conductive filaments and the ReRAM resistive switching mechanism
Authors: Robin Jacobs-Gedrim, William Wahby, Thomas Awe, Patrick Xiao, Melvin Witten, Jacob Martinez-Marez, Kiran Seetala, David Hughart, Alec Talin, Christopher Bennett, Matthew Marinella, Gennadi Bersuker, Sapan Agarwal
Abstract: The physics underlying reset in bipolar resistive memory has been the subject of decades of controversy and has been identified as the primary barrier to resistive memory technology development. This manuscript introduces a nanoscale effect in current carrying conductors, whereby surface charge induced radial electric fields are found to be inversely proportional to the radius of the conductive path. This nanoscale effect is then applied to explain the negative resistance switching (reset) mechanism in filamentary metal oxide resistive switching memory devices (memristors). Previous explanations for the negative resistive switching mechanism state that diffusion constitutes the radial driving mechanism for oxygen ions, and drift under electric fields is restricted to the direction parallel to current flow. This explanation conflicts with retention and microscopy data collected in a subset of devices presented in literature. We demonstrate that the electric field's dependency on the on the radius of a nanoscale conductive path can result in radial fields on the order of 10^5 to 10^6 V/cm at only -1 V bias, sufficient to govern the negative resistance switching mechanism in filamentary metal oxides. By accounting for this nanoscale size effect, long standing anomalous experimental data about the negative (reset) resistance switching mechanism in bipolar filamentary resistive memory devices is finally reconciled. Wide understanding of surface charges and associated electric fields in nanoscale conductive paths could prove important for further scaling of integrated circuits and aid in elucidating many nanoscale phenomena.

Title: Sculpting 2D Crystals via Membrane Contractions before and during Solidification
Authors: Hao Wan, Geunwoong Jeon, Gregory M. Grason, Maria M. Santore
Abstract: When phospholipids crystallize within the otherwise fluid membranes of giant unilamellar vesicles, the resulting molecularly-thin "2D" solids exhibit great variety in their morphology evolution. For instance within membranes containing moderate amounts of the crystallizing component, crystals grow with a fixed morphology depending on vesicle size. Conversely for membranes containing large amounts of the crystallizing species, we find small compact crystals on vesicles of all sizes. However on large vesicles, growing crystals sprout flower petals that lengthen progressively. These behaviors result from two combined mechanisms: First, like other 2D solids, the shear rigidity of phospholipid crystals renders them intolerant to morphologies with non-zero Gaussian curvature. As a result and especially at elevated membrane tension, the cost of bending elasticity is reduced, at the expense of line energy, by the formation of flowers as opposed to compact crystals. Second, the composition-dependent tension rise during cooling relaxes via water permeation of the membrane with a time constant scaling as $R^2$. The amount of crystal formed for a small decrease in temperature determines this composition-dependent increase in stress from thermal contractions versus solidification. Surface Evolver computations motivated using the predicted tension evolution to develop a processing space that maps to experimental observations for initial and growing crystal morphology. Important variable groups are identified, including a scaled ratio of bending to line energy, a vesicle size-independent group for membrane contractions, and a time constant for stress relaxation. Though processing stresses ultimately relax, the crystal morphology persists well beyond the processing window.

Title: Predictive Machine Learning Molecular Dynamics of SEI Formation in Concentrated LiTFSI and LiPF6 Electrolytes for Lithium Metal Batteries
Authors: Syed Mustafa Shah, Mohammed Lemaalem, Anh T. Ngo
Abstract: High-energy-density lithium metal batteries require electrolytes that enable fast ion transport and form a stable solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) to sustain high-rate cycling, a process that remains challenging to capture experimentally. Here, we develop a Deep Potential-based machine learning molecular dynamics (MLMD) framework, trained on extensive ab initio datasets and validated against experimental transport properties, to resolve early-stage SEI nucleation at lithium metal interfaces with quantum accuracy. We find that at the Li-metal interface, 3.5 M LiTFSI/DMC induces spontaneous, thermally activated reduction reactions, yielding rapidly growing thick anion-derived SEIs enriched in O/F-containing species. In contrast, 1.5-2.5 M LiTFSI/DMC and 1 M LiPF6/EMC/DMC/EC form thinner, LiF-dominated interphases with slower growth kinetics. Our modeling results are consistent with experimental observations, where 3.5 M LiTFSI enhances cycling stability and rate capability, while lower concentrations result in weaker passivation. Our MLMD framework efficiently captures the electrolyte transport and early-stage SEI formation mechanisms in LMBs.

Title: Scaling Law for Sequence-Induced Demixing of Compositionally Identical Copolymers
Authors: Artem M. Rumyantsev, Alexey A. Gavrilov
Abstract: The critical incompatibility of polymers with different compositions scales inversely with their length. For instance, a mixture of A and B homopolymers of length $N$ segregates at $\chi_{AB}^{cr} = 2/N$. But what if the difference between the blend components is subtler? We demonstrate that a mixture of AB copolymers with identical composition -- equal amounts of A and B monomers -- but different primary sequences can still phase separate. Incompatibility arises from distinct positional correlations between monomers of different chains. Calculating the Gaussian fluctuation correction to the free energy reveals that critical incompatibility from sequence differences follows a distinct yet universal scaling with chain length, $\chi_{AB}^{cr} \sim 1 / \sqrt{N}$. This power law holds for both regular-sequence and statistical copolymers. A closed-form expression is derived for blends of block-alternating chains. The new theoretical scaling is confirmed by coarse-grained simulations, offering important insights into multiphase coexistence in biomolecular condensates.

Title: Vertical Nb Josephson junctions fabricated by direct metal deposition on both surfaces of freestanding graphene layers
Authors: Yoonkang Kim, Seongbeom Kim, Jeonglyul Kim, Kikyung Jung, Sejin An, Jieun Lee, Hyobin Yoo, Joon Young Park, Gyu-Chul Yi
Abstract: Vertical integration of superconducting electronics requires fabrication strategies that preserve pristine interfaces while accommodating oxidation-sensitive elemental superconductors. However, existing van der Waals-based vertical Josephson junctions largely rely on transfer-based assembly schemes that are incompatible with elemental materials such as niobium (Nb). Here, we introduce a freestanding van der Waals membrane architecture that enables deposition-based fabrication of vertical Josephson junctions through double-sided processing of a single suspended two-dimensional layer. Using multilayer graphene suspended across lithographically defined through-holes in a SiNx membrane, we realize vertical Nb/multilayer graphene/Nb Josephson junctions without ambient exposure of buried interfaces. The resulting devices exhibit clear Josephson coupling, including reproducible supercurrents and a temperature dependence of the critical current consistent with short-junction behaviour. Well-defined magnetic interference patterns governed by the membrane-defined aperture geometry, together with sub-gap features that track a Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS)-like superconducting gap, further confirm the junction quality. This platform establishes a scalable route to vertical superconducting devices based on oxidation-sensitive elemental superconductors and van der Waals materials.

Title: Mean-field behavior of the finite size Ising model near its critical point
Authors: D. Olascoaga-Rodríguez, F. Sastre, V. Romero-Rochín
Abstract: Universality classes encompass the analogous thermodynamic behavior of unlike physical systems, at different spatial dimensions $d$, in the vicinity of their critical point. Critical exponents define these classes, with the Ising model being the outstanding prototype that elucidates the differences from the mean-field category, believed to be valid above a critical dimension only. Here, in apparent striking contradiction to the Ising universality class, we demonstrate that the critical behavior of a finite Ising system of $N$ spins in $d = 3$ obeys mean-field Landau theory in the vicinity of its critical point, with classical critical exponents. Yet, when expressed in terms of the linear size $L$ of the system, the free energy unveils its proper finite-size scaling form, from which the thermodynamic limit critical temperature $T_c$ and the Ising critical exponents $\nu$, $\gamma$ and $\beta$ can be identified. We find that the larger the size $L$, the smaller the mean-field region, shrinking to zero in the thermodynamic limit. These conclusions are achieved via the use of an alternative approach to collect data from a Monte Carlo simulation of a three-dimensional Ising model that allows for the evaluation of the free energy per spin $f = f(T,m;L)$ and of the coexistence curve, or spontaneous magnetization at zero magnetic field, $m_{\rm coex} = m(T;L)$ as functions of temperature $T$ and magnetization per spin $m = M/N$. Our results suggest a revision of the role of mean-field theory in the elucidation of critical phenomena.

Title: Substitutional oxygen as the origin of the 3.5 eV luminescence in hexagonal boron nitride
Authors: Marek Maciaszek
Abstract: Although point defects in hexagonal boron nitride exhibiting single-photon emission attract considerable interest, a broader understanding of defect physics and chemistry in hBN remains limited, potentially hindering further development. Oxygen is among the most common impurities in hBN, and numerous studies have reported a pronounced photoluminescence band centered near 3.5 eV following oxygen incorporation, yet its microscopic origin has remained unresolved. Here, we demonstrate that this emission originates from hole capture by neutral oxygen substituting for nitrogen (ON). The transition mechanism is non-trivial, involving not only a change in charge state but also a substantial structural reconfiguration: the positive and neutral states exhibit markedly different geometries and symmetries. In the neutral state the defect adopts a low-symmetry configuration with out-of-plane displacements of the oxygen and neighboring atoms. The calculated emission energy (3.63 eV) and lineshape are in excellent agreement with experiment.

Title: lrux: Fast low-rank updates of determinants and Pfaffians in JAX
Authors: Ao Chen, Christopher Roth
Abstract: We present lrux, a JAX-based software package for fast low-rank updates of determinants and Pfaffians, targeting the dominant computational bottleneck in various quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithms. The package implements efficient low-rank updates that reduce the cost of successive wavefunction evaluations from $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ to $\mathcal{O}(n^2k)$ when the update rank $k$ is smaller than the dimension $n$ of matrices. Both determinant and Pfaffian updates are supported, together with delayed-update strategies that trade floating-point operations for reduced memory traffic on modern accelerators. lrux natively integrates with JAX transformations such as JIT compilation, vectorization, and automatic differentiation, and supports both real and complex data types. Benchmarks on GPUs demonstrate up to $1000\times$ speedup at large matrix sizes. lrux enables scalable, high-performance evaluation of antisymmetric wavefunctions and is designed as a drop-in component for a wide range of QMC workflows. lrux is available at this https URL.

Title: Multi-wavelength Spin Dynamics of Defects in Hexagonal Boron Nitride
Authors: Ivan Zhigulin, Nicholas P. Sloane, Benjamin Whitefield, Jean-Philippe Tetienne, Mehran Kianinia, Igor Aharonovich
Abstract: Optically addressable solid-state spin defects are essential platforms for quantum sensing and information processing. Recently, single spin defects with combined S = 1 and S = 1/2 spin transitions were discovered in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). In this work we unveil their excitation dynamics. In particular, we study the effects of the excitation wavelength on the spin-dependent fluorescence and the spin dynamics of these peculiar quantum spin defects. We find that changing the excitation wavelength leads to a threefold enhancement in both the optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) contrast and the corresponding magnetic field sensitivity. In addition, we find that the excitation wavelength has a strong impact on the photodynamics of spin complex emitters. Our work presents valuable insights to the mechanistic understanding of spin complex emitters in hBN and highlights the importance of excitation wavelength for optimising their performance in quantum sensing and quantum technologies.

Title: Beyond overcomplication: a linear model suffices to decode hidden structure-property relationships in glasses
Authors: Chenyan Wang, Mouyang Cheng, Ji Chen
Abstract: Establishing reliable and interpretable structure-property relationships in glasses is a longstanding challenge in condensed matter physics. While modern data-driven machine learning techniques have proven highly effective in establishing structure-property correlations, many models are criticized for lacking physical interpretability and being task-specific. In this work, we identify an approximate linear relation between structure profiles and disorder-induced responses of glass properties based on first order perturbation theory. We analytically demonstrate that this relationship holds universally across glassy systems with varying dimensions and distinct interaction types. This robust theoretical relationship motivates the adoption of linear machine learning models, which we show numerically to achieve surprisingly high predictive accuracy for structure-property mapping in a wide variety of glassy materials. We further devise regularization analysis to further enhance the interpretability of our model, bridging the gap between predictive performance and physical insight. Overall, this linear relation establishes a simple yet powerful connection between structural disorder and spectral properties in glasses, opening a new avenue for advancing their studies.

Title: Spin current generation via magnetic skyrmion, bimeron, and meron crystals
Authors: Aoi Kajihara, Shun Okumura, Yukitoshi Motome
Abstract: Spin current offers a promising route toward energy-efficient and high-speed information processing. Developing efficient methods for their generation remains a central challenge in spintronics. Here, we investigate spin current generation via two-dimensional topological spin textures: a skyrmion crystal (SkX) with out-of-plane magnetization, a bimeron crystal (BmX) with in-plane magnetization, and a meron crystal (MX) with zero net magnetization. We show that these distinct spin textures generate spin currents with characteristic spin polarization directions. In the absence of spin--orbit coupling, the SkX and BmX generate spin currents polarized along their magnetization directions, whereas the MX yields no spin current. Upon introducing spin--orbit coupling, while the behavior of the SkX does not qualitatively change, the BmX generates nonzero spin currents in multiple polarization directions. Notably, the MX, despite its zero net magnetization, exhibits a pronounced spin current with out-of-plane spin polarization, driven by an enhanced spin Berry curvature associated with characteristic band degeneracy. We further demonstrate that the electronic and spin transport properties of each texture are governed by their magnetic symmetries. Our results highlight the topological spin textures as efficient sources of spin current even without net magnetization, expanding the design for spintronics devices based on topological magnetic metals.

Title: Transport signatures of topological commensurate off-diagonal Aubry-André-Harper chain
Authors: Arpita Koley
Abstract: We study the interplay between quantum transport and topology in a one-dimensional off-diagonal commensurate Aubry-André-Harper (AAH) chain. The model, formulated within AAH framework, effectively represents a one-dimensional lattice with two competing commensurate modulations, supporting two distinct types of topological edge modes: zero-energy states in the central gapless region and quantum Hall (QH) edge states bridging the gapped bulk bands. These edge modes govern the transport behavior and give rise to sharp variations in transmission across the corresponding gap-closing transitions. A pronounced even-odd effect further emerges, where chains with an odd number of sites exhibit nearly perfect zero-energy transmission at the Dirac points, independent of system-lead coupling, system size, or modulation strength; a robust signature of ballistic transport. To capture the influence of environmental decoherence, we also incorporate Büttiker dephasing probes, which enable a phenomenological description of inelastic scattering and reveal how dephasing modifies, and in some regimes enhances, coherent transport.

Title: Physics-informed acquisition weighting for stoichiometry-constrained Bayesian optimization of oxide thin-film growth
Authors: Yuki K. Wakabayashi, Takuma Otsuka, Yoshiharu Krockenberger, Yoshitaka Taniyasu
Abstract: We present a physics-informed Bayesian optimization (PIBO) with a concise modification to its acquisition function to incorporate the physical prior knowledge. Specifically, this method multiplies the expected improvement (EI) by a weight encoding prior crystal growth physics. When applied to LaAlO3 molecular-beam epitaxy, the weighting function defines a flat stoichiometric window and penalizes off-window proposals, thereby steering the optimization toward physically plausible regions while maintaining controlled exploration. In a closed-loop optimization, relative to the bare EI, which often proposes off-stoichiometric conditions, the weighted EI constrains the search toward stoichiometric regions while retaining sufficient flexibility to explore neighboring conditions, eventually identifying an optimum slightly beyond the stoichiometric window. Within only 15 growth runs, the lattice constant of the grown LaAlO3 film converged to the bulk value, evidencing efficient and rapid optimization for the ideal stoichiometric growth. Because physics knowledge is incorporated solely through the weighting function, the approach requires only minimal modification to standard BO workflows and is readily applicable to other material systems, offering a general and practical route to AI-driven materials synthesis.

Abstract: This work systematically investigates the potential of the hybrid anion semiconductor AgBiSCl2 for photovoltaic and thermoelectric applications, aiming to provide theoretical guidance for high-performance energy conversion devices. Structural analysis reveals favorable ductility and a relatively low Debye temperature. Analysis of interatomic interactions indicates that Ag-S and Ag-Cl bonds are relatively weak, resulting in local structural softness and enhanced lattice anharmonicity. These weak bonds facilitate phonon scattering and give rise to low-frequency localized rattling vibrations primarily associated with Ag atoms, contributing to reduced lattice thermal conductivity.

Upon entering the spin density wave state below 153 K, the $A_{1g}$ channel exhibits an abrupt electronic spectral gap with a clear isosbestic point. In contrast, the $B_{1g}$ and $B_{2g}$ channels are dominated by pronounced two-magnon (2M) excitations, representing an unambiguous signature of incipient Mottness. These 2M signals in both channels constitute direct evidence for two distinct in-plane spin exchange interactions along the Ni-O bonding and its diagonal directions. Calculations based on the spin wave theory further reveal that the 2M mode in the $B_{2g}$ channel arises from the competition between two bond-diagonal antiferromagnetic interactions mediated by nickel $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals. Furthermore, emergent low-energy 2M excitations below 10 meV are found to originate from distinct, weaker spin moments, strongly supporting spin disproportionation. Simultaneously, an anomalous softening of $B_{1g}$ phonons from 280 down to 4.5 K is uncovered, suggesting the presence of an incipient lattice instability leading to checkerboard-type breathing modulations. Collectively, these findings identify a ground state of the bilayer nickelate characterized by competing bond-diagonal interactions, spin disproportionation, and an incipient lattice instability, establishing key ingredients for understanding the mechanism of nickelate superconductivity.

Abstract: Ta4SiTe4 is a one-dimensional van der Waals material that exhibits an exceptionally large thermoelectric power factor below room temperature. However, since this material has been available only in the form of acicular microcrystals, experimental exploration of the electronic properties responsible for its giant thermoelectric performance has long been challenging. In this study, we quantitatively evaluated the one-dimensional electronic nature of Ta4SiTe4 by combining micro-spot angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and transport measurements on focused-ion-beam-processed samples. The angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements reveal anisotropic band dispersions along and perpendicular to the crystallographic c axis. Consistently, transport measurements demonstrate that the resistivity perpendicular to the c axis is approximately five times larger than that along the c axis at 200 K. These results provide direct experimental evidence for the quasi-one-dimensional electronic character of Ta4SiTe4, which underlies its giant thermoelectric response reported previously, and offer fundamental insights into the role of electronic dimensionality in enhancing thermoelectric performance.

Title: CatFlow: Co-generation of Slab-Adsorbate Systems via Flow Matching
Authors: Minkyu Kim, Nayoung Kim, Honghui Kim, Sungsoo Ahn
Abstract: Discovering heterogeneous catalysts tailored for specific reaction intermediates remains a fundamental bottleneck in materials science. While traditional trial-and-error methods and recent generative models have shown promise, they struggle to capture the intrinsic coupling between surface geometry and adsorbate interactions. To address this limitation, we propose CatFlow, a flow matching-based framework for de novo design and structure prediction of heterogeneous catalysts. Our model operates on a primitive cell-based factorized representation of the slab-adsorbate complex, reducing the number of learnable variables by an average of 9.2x while explicitly encoding the surface orientation of the slab-adsorbate interface. Experiments on the Open Catalyst 2020 dataset demonstrate that CatFlow significantly improves the structural fidelity of generated catalysts compared to autoregressive and sequential baselines. Further experiments show that the generated structures accurately capture the adsorption energy distributions of physically plausible interfaces and lie closer to thermodynamic local minima.

Title: Ferroelectricity in Atomically Thin Metallic TaNiTe$_5$ with Ultrahigh Carrier Density
Authors: Zhihua Liu, Shichong Song, Xunqing Yin, Chenhang Xu, Feng Liu, Guohua Wang, Peng Chen, Shengwei Jiang, Chunqiang Xu, Xiaofeng Xu, Weidong Luo, Dong Qian
Abstract: Ferroelectric metals, characterized by the coexistence of ferroelectricity and metallic conductivity, present a fundamental challenge due to the screening effect of free charge carriers on the long-range electric dipole order. Existing strategies to circumvent this obstacle include employing two-dimensional (2D) crystals, where reduced dimensionality and low carrier densities suppress screening, or designing materials of van der Waals (vdW) superlattice with spatially separated and decoupled conductive and nearly insulating ferroelectric layers. Here, we report an alternative paradigm in TaNiTe5, where an ultrahigh carrier density coexists with an out-of-plane ferroelectric order within the same surface monolayer. Using piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM), we observed robust ferroelectric behavior in TaNiTe5 down to single-unit-cell thickness (~1.3 nm) at room temperature. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) gives structural evidence that the ferroelectricity might originate from the vertical displacement of outmost Te atoms on the surface, breaking the inversion symmetry. Concurrently, electrical transport measurements reveal a metallic state with a carrier density on the order of 10$^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$ (or 10$^{22}$ cm$^{-3}$) -- comparable to that of Copper (Cu). Our findings establish a unique platform for exploring the interplay between ferroelectricity and an ultrahigh density of mobile carriers in the 2D limit.

Title: Compact self-matched gyrators using edge magnetoplasmons
Authors: Aldo Tarascio, Yiqi Zhao, Rafael S. Eggli, Taras Patlatiuk, Christian Reichl, Werner Wegscheider, Stefano Bosco, Dominik M. Zumbühl
Abstract: Non-reciprocal microwave components are indispensable in quantum information processing and cryogenic measurement. Conventional implementations, however, are bulky and incompatible with on-chip scalable integration. Recent efforts to develop compact on-chip alternatives often rely on active modulation or complex circuit architectures, which introduce additional losses and degrade performance. We demonstrate the realization of compact, self-impedance-matched gyrators based on edge magnetoplasmons in a two-dimensional electron gas. Gyrators can be used as building blocks for other non-reciprocal elements such as isolators and circulators. Our devices achieve gyration from 0.2 to 2 GHz, tunable by moderate out-of plane magnetic fields below 400 mT, and sub-mm footprint, two orders of magnitude smaller than conventional ferrite-based components. Using an electrode geometry predicted to minimize reflections, we achieve insertion losses as low as 2 to 4 dB. The self-matched design framework we utilize is broadly applicable, and can be implemented in a wide variety of non-reciprocal device architectures.

Title: Branch-and-Bound Tensor Networks for Exact Ground-State Characterization
Authors: Yijia Wang, Xuanzhao Gao, Pan Zhang, Feng Pan, Jinguo Liu
Abstract: Characterizing the ground-state properties of disordered systems, such as spin glasses and combinatorial optimization problems, is fundamental to science and engineering. However, computing exact ground states and counting their degeneracies are generally NP-hard and #P-hard problems, respectively, posing a formidable challenge for exact algorithms. Recently, Tensor Networks methods, which utilize high-dimensional linear algebra and achieve massive hardware parallelization, have emerged as a rapidly developing paradigm for efficiently solving these tasks. Despite their success, these methods are fundamentally constrained by the exponential growth of space complexity, which severely limits their scalability. To address this bottleneck, we introduce the Branch-and-Bound Tensor Network (BBTN) method, which seamlessly integrates the adaptive search framework of branch-and-bound with the efficient contraction of tropical tensor networks, significantly extending the reach of exact algorithms. We show that BBTN significantly surpasses existing state-of-the-art solvers, setting new benchmarks for exact computation. It pushes the boundaries of tractability to previously unreachable scales, enabling exact ground-state counting for $\pm J$ spin glasses up to $64 \times 64$ and solving Maximum Independent Set problems on King's subgraphs up to $100 \times 100$. For hard instances, BBTN dramatically reduces the computational cost of standard Tropical Tensor Networks, compressing years of runtime into minutes. Furthermore, it outperforms leading integer-programming solvers by over 30$\times$, establishing a versatile and scalable framework for solving hard problems in statistical physics and combinatorial optimization.

Title: Ferron-Polaritons in Superconductor/Ferroelectric/Superconductor Heterostructures
Authors: M. Nursagatov, Xiyin Ye, G. A. Bobkov, Tao Yu, I. V. Bobkova
Abstract: We predict the formation of ferron-polariton - a hybrid light-matter quasiparticle arising from the coupling between collective ferroelectric excitations (ferrons) and Swihart photons in a superconductor/ferroelectric/superconductor heterostructure. The coupling provides direct evidence for ferrons and reaches the ultrastrong-coupling regime, with a spectral gap in the terahertz range, orders of magnitude larger than those in magnetic analogues, reflecting the superior strength of electric dipole interactions. Our work establishes superconductor-ferroelectric heterostructures as a novel platform for exploring extreme light-matter coupling and for developing high-speed, ferroelectric-based quantum technologies at terahertz frequencies.

Title: Crystallinity Evolution of MOCVD-Grown $β$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ Films Probed by In Situ HT-XRD under Different Reactor Heights
Authors: Imteaz Rahaman, Botong Li, Bobby G. Duersch, Hunter D. Ellis, Kathy Anderson, Kai Fu
Abstract: The crystallinity of $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ thin films grown by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) is strongly influenced by reactor design and the resulting growth environment. In this work, we investigate the role of reactor height on the crystallinity evolution of MOCVD-grown $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ films by directly comparing long- and short-chamber showerhead configurations. Structural evolution was probed by in situ high-temperature X-ray diffraction (HT-XRD) as the MOCVD-grown films were heated from 25~$^\circ$C to 1100~$^\circ$C. Temperature-dependent XRD reveals a consistent redshift of the $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$~($-201$) reflection after HT-XRD heating and subsequent cooling to room temperature for both reactor geometries, indicating a similar thermally driven strain response. Quantitative rocking-curve analysis shows a non-monotonic temperature dependence of the ($-201$) full width at half maximum (FWHM), with minimum values of approximately 2.03$^\circ$ and 2.72$^\circ$ for the short- and long-chamber films, respectively, reflecting differences in mosaic alignment established during growth. Atomic force microscopy further shows that short-chamber-grown films exhibit smoother surfaces, with root-mean-square roughness values of approximately 7.7~nm before and 7.3~nm after HT-XRD heating, compared to 19.3~nm and 12.3~nm, respectively, for long-chamber-grown films. Overall, these results indicate that reactor height influences the initial crystalline and morphological templates of $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ films and modulates their elevated-temperature structural response, providing practical insights for optimizing MOCVD reactor design for high-quality $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ growth.

Title: Exchange Monte Carlo for continuous-space Path Integral Monte Carlo simulation
Authors: Xun Zhao, Synge Todo
Abstract: We present a novel Exchange Monte Carlo (EMC) method designed for application in continuous-space Path Integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulations at finite temperature. Traditional PIMC methods for bosonic systems suffer from long autocorrelation times, particularly when measuring observables affected by particle permutations, such as the winding number. To address this issue, we introduce an exchange update scheme that facilitates replica transitions between different interaction regimes, significantly accelerating Monte Carlo dynamics-especially for global observables sensitive to permutation effects. Furthermore, we incorporate Stochastic Potential Switching (SPS) to efficiently decompose interactions, substantially enhancing computational efficiency for long-range interatomic pair potentials such as the Lennard-Jones and Aziz potentials.

Title: Higher-Order Topological Superconductivity and Electrically Tunable Majorana Corner Modes in Monolayer MnXPb$_2$ (X=Se, Te)-Pb Heterostructure
Authors: Yongting Shi, Qing Wang, Zhen-Guo Fu, Ping Zhang, Ning Hao
Abstract: Higher-order topological superconductors host Majorana zero modes localized at corners or hinges, providing a promising route toward scalable and controllable Majorana networks without vortices or magnetic flux. Here we propose a symmetry-enforced higher-order topological superconductivity based on antiferromagnetic topological insulators, specifically realized in MnXPb$_2$ (X = Se, Te)-Pb heterostructure. We show that the intrinsic boundary dichotomy-gapless Dirac states protected by an effective time-reversal symmetry on antiferromagnetic edges and magnetic gaps on ferromagnetic edges-naturally generates Majorana corner modes as mass domain walls. Superconducting proximity converts the antiferromagnetic edges into one-dimensional topological superconductors, and the intersections between superconducting and magnetic edges bind Majorana zero modes as mass domain walls. Combining first-principles calculations with a calibrated effective boundary theory, we demonstrate robust corner localization and purely electrical control of Majorana fusion and braiding in a triangular geometry. Our results establish MnXPb$_2$ as experimentally promising platform for electrically programmable Majorana networks in two dimensions.

Title: A Novel Mechanism of Ordering in a Coupled Driven System: Vacancy Induced Phase Separation
Authors: Chandradip Khamrai, Sakuntala Chatterjee
Abstract: We study a coupled driven system where two different species of particles, along with some vacancies or holes, move on a landscape whose shape fluctuates with time. The movement of the particles is guided by the local shape of the landscape, and this shape is also affected by the presence of different particle species. When a particle species push the landscape in the same (opposite) direction of its own motion, it is called an aligned (a reverse) bias. Aligned bias promotes ordering while reverse bias destroys it. In absence of vacancies, the system reduces to previously studied LH model with different kinds of ordered and disordered phases which could be explained as a competition or cooperation between aligned bias and reverse bias. This interplay is expected to remain unaffected even when vacancies are present since vacancies do not impart any kind of bias on the landscape. However, we find presence of vacancies effectively weakens the reverse bias and this significantly changes the outcome of the competition between the two bias types. As a result novel ordered phases emerge which were not seen before. We analytically calculate the new phase boundaries within mean field approximation. We show even when aligned bias is weaker than reverse bias, it is possible to find long range order in the system. We discover two new phases where particle species showing weak aligned bias phase separate and the other species with strong reverse bias stays mixed with the vacancies. We call these phases finite current with partial phase separation (FPPS) and vacancy induced phase separation (VIPS). The landscape beneath the phase separated species takes the form of a macroscopic hill or valley in FPPS phase. But in VIPS phase it has the shape like a plateau whose height scales as square root of system size. The landscape in the remaining part of the system is disordered in both these phases.

Title: Probing Anharmonic and Heterogeneous Carrier Dynamics Across Sublattice Melting in a Minimal Model Superionic Conductor
Authors: Sucharita Niyogi, Takenobu Nakamura, Genki Kobayashi, Yasunobu Ando, Takeshi Kawasaki
Abstract: Despite decades of research, the microscopic origin of sublattice melting and fast ion transport in superionic conductors remains elusive. Here, we introduce a chemically neutral minimal binary model consisting of a rigid host lattice stabilized by short-range steric repulsion and a soft carrier sublattice interacting via long-range Wigner-type forces. This contrast naturally produces distinct melting temperatures and an intermediate sublattice-melting phase in which carriers become fluidlike while the host remains crystalline. Molecular-dynamics simulations identify three dynamical regimes-crystalline, sublattice-melt, and fully molten-marked by sharp changes in diffusivity, structural correlations, and dynamic heterogeneity. Near sublattice melting, carrier motion is strongly anharmonic and spatially heterogeneous, beyond mean-field hopping descriptions. By tuning the density, we demonstrate that sublattice melting can be continuously controlled, establishing a direct link between lattice softness, anharmonicity, and collective ion transport. This work provides a unified microscopic foundation for designing mechanically robust, high-performance superionic conductors operable near ambient conditions.

Title: Huygens' clocks at the microscale
Authors: Yaocheng Li, Ivan Palaia, Jinzi Mac Huang, Antoine Aubret, Jeremie Palacci
Abstract: Weakly coupled oscillators adjust their dynamics to work in unison: they synchronize. This ubiquitous phenomenon is observed for oscillating pendulum, electronic devices, as well as clapping crowds or flashing fireflies. In effect, synchronization constitutes an efficient mean to translate microscopic into large scale dynamics. While broadly studied theoretically, experimental investigations of synchronization of systems at the microscale are limited. Here we devise and study a model system of noisy and "measurably imperfect" colloidal oscillators: autonomous clocks made of an active swimmer revolving around a passive sphere. The distribution of natural frequency of the clock is achieved using passive spheres of various sizes, thus without altering the (phoretic) coupling between clocks. We observe that pairs of oscillators lock phases before slipping and returning to sync, and we characterize the synchronicity of the pair. We rationalize our findings with a stochastic model, formalizing synchronization as a classical Kramers escape problem in an adequate potential. This provides an analytical expression for the rate of synchronization of a pair set by the ratio between differences of natural frequency and environmental noise, and agrees qualitatively with the experiment. Our results set a blueprint for synchronization with micrometric autonomous systems.

Title: Microscopic origin of an exceptionally large phonon thermal Hall effect from charge puddles in a topological insulator
Authors: Rohit Sharma, Yongjian Wang, Yoichi Ando, Achim Rosch, Thomas Lorenz
Abstract: We present the experimental observation of a drastically enhanced thermal Hall effect in the topological insulator material TlBi$_{0.15}$Sb$_{0.85}$Te$_2$. Although heat transport is dominated by phonons, moderate magnetic fields generate a thermal Hall ratio ($\kappa_{xy}/\kappa_{xx}$) above 2\%, an unprecedented value for a nonmagnetic material. The transverse thermal conductivity $\kappa_{xy}$ exhibits a pronounced maximum in fields of a few Tesla. This characteristic field dependence allows us to identify the microscopic origin of the thermal Hall effect in this system. Small densities of charged impurities induce locally conducting regions, so-called charge puddles, within the bulk insulating matrix. Via electron-phonon coupling, these charge puddles imprint a large thermal Hall effect onto the phonons accounting for both the magnitude and the magnetic-field dependence of the observed effect.

Title: Direct observation of propagating spin waves in a spin-Hall nano-oscillator
Authors: Victor H. González, Frank Schulz, Nilamani Behera, Martina Ahlberg, Akash Kumar, Andreas Frisk, Felix Groß, Sven Erik Ilse, Steffen Wittrock, Markus Weigand, Gisela Schütz, Johan Åkerman, Sebastian Wintz
Abstract: Constriction-based spin Hall nano-oscillators (SHNOs) show great promise for application as highly tunable microwave sources with straightforward scalability toward large coupled networks. However, details of the magnetization dynamics within SHNOs have thus far not been addressed experimentally, due to the minute time and length scales involved. In this work, we present direct imaging of the magnetization dynamics within a single CoFeB-based SHNO using time-resolved scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM). Our measurements reveal that the magnon amplitude is the strongest at the two constriction edges, with a pronounced assymetry favoring one edge, and that emitted spin waves exhibit strongly anisotropic propagation. Micromagnetic simulations suggest that grain boundaries and the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) play a key role in both effects. Furthermore, the magnetodynamics changed during the measurement, indicating that the CoFeB/MgO interface may be more susceptible to X-ray induced modifications than previously recognized, challenging its presumed radiation hardness.

Title: Raman response of collective modes in multicomponent superconductors
Authors: Yuki Yamazaki, Takahiro Morimoto
Abstract: We formulate a microscopic theory of the Raman response of superconducting collective modes in multicomponent superconductors. Starting from a general Bogoliubov--de Gennes (BdG) Hamiltonian with a separable pairing interaction, we derive a gauge-invariant expression for the Raman susceptibility, including a long-range Coulomb interaction. The resulting Raman susceptibility is directly computable for an arbitrary BdG Hamiltonian, which contains single- and multiband systems, spin-singlet and triplet order parameters, and time-reversal-symmetric and time-reversal-symmetry-breaking superconducting states. Based on the microscopic coupling between a Raman source field and collective modes, we derive a symmetry selection rule for Raman-active collective modes and show a group-theoretical classification for all crystalline point groups. This classification provides a unified framework based on the ``higher-order Lifshitz-invariant'' to identify Raman-active collective modes such as Leggett mode, Bardasis-Schrieffer (BS) mode, and clapping mode. As an application, we focus on an effective model of the heavy-fermion superconductor UTe$_2$ with a fully gapped multicomponent odd-parity pairing state. We find sharp in-gap Raman resonances below the quasiparticle continuum, which do not correspond to a conventional Leggett mode but arise from the {\it intraband} relative modes between different pairing components.

Title: Electronic Structure and Superconducting Gap of HgBa$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{8+δ}$ Revealed by Laser-Based Angle-Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy
Authors: Taimin Miao, Wenshan Hong, Qinghong Wang, Shanshan Zhang, Bo Liang, Wenpei Zhu, Neng Cai, Mingkai Xu, Shenjin Zhang, Fengfeng Zhang, Feng Yang, Zhimin Wang, Qinjun Peng, Zuyan Xu, Hanqing Mao, Zhihai Zhu, Xintong Li, Guodong Liu, Lin Zhao, Yuan Li, X. J. Zhou
Abstract: The spatially-resolved laser-based high resolution angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements have been performed on the optimally-doped HgBa$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{8+\delta}$ (Hg1223) superconductor with a $T_c$ at 133 K. Two distinct regions are identified on the cleaved surface: the single Fermi surface region where only one Fermi surface is observed, and the double Fermi surface region where two Fermi surface sheets are resolved coming from both the inner (IP) and outer (OP) CuO$_2$ planes. The electronic structure and superconducting gap are measured on both of these two regions. In both cases, the observed electronic states are mainly concentrated near the nodal region. The momentum dependence of superconducting gap deviates from the standard d-wave form. These results indicate that the surface electronic structure of Hg1223 behaves more like that of underdoped cuprates.

Title: Observation of large perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and excessive polar magneto-optical effect in Pt/CoFeB/Ru tri-layer system
Authors: Md Rejaul Karim, Aman Agrahari, Arun Singh Dev, Rakhul Raj, Mohd S Sabir, Arun Jacob Mathew, Joseph Vimal Vas, Yasuhiro Fukuma, V. Raghavendra Reddy, Rohit Medwal
Abstract: Heterostructures comprising ferromagnet (FM) and heavy metals (HM) with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) and interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (iDMI) can host chiral domain walls and topological spin textures, making them highly promising for various spintronics applications. In this paper, we have investigated the magneto-optical properties, the anomalous Hall effect (AHE), and PMA of Pt/CoFeB/Ru multilayers engineered to possess significant iDMI. We utilized the Anomalous Hall effect (AHE), and the polar magneto-optical Kerr effect (p-MOKE), Hall response and the domain wall motion in Pt/CoFeB/Ru-systems. Both MOKE and AHE measurements confirm that the films maintain strong perpendicular magnetization for CoFeB thicknesses below 1.2 nm. The effective magnetic anisotropy K_{\mathrm{eff}} of 0.88 \times 10^6 erg/cm^3 has been achieved without any post-annealing, highlighting the high-quality interface in this multilayer design. The angular dependence of the switching field deviates from the conventional Kondorsky model and is well described using a modified Kondorsky formalism, capturing the role of field-induced domain-wall softening and pinning effects in the reversal process. Furthermore, p-MOKE microscopy imaging during the magnetization reversal process provides detailed insight into domain nucleation and subsequent domain-wall propagation. The observations reveal well-defined, stable magnetic domains that evolve coherently under the applied magnetic field. Such a behavior is expected in the system where interfacial DMI, PMA interact to stabilize the chiral Néel-type domain walls, which are essential for fast, low-power domain-wall motion driven by spin-orbit torques.

Title: A steady-state study of the nonequilibrium properties of realistic materials: Application of the mixed-configuration approximation
Authors: Tommaso Maria Mazzocchi, Markus Aichhorn, Enrico Arrigoni
Abstract: We present the mixed-configuration approximation (MCA) based on the auxiliary master equation approach impurity solver to study multiorbital correlated systems under equilibrium and nonequilibrium conditions within dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT). We benchmark the method for bulk and layered SrVO$_3$ in equilibrium and apply it to a prototypical nonequilibrium geometry in which a voltage bias is applied perpendicular to the layer via reservoirs held at different chemical potentials. For bulk SrVO$_3$, MCA reproduces the metallic state at moderate interaction strengths, but it overestimates the weight of the lower band relative to quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) and fork tensor product state (FTPS) solvers. With respect to QMC and FTPS, MCA yields an earlier metal-to-insulator transition as the electron-electron interaction is increased. In layered SrVO$_3$ at equilibrium, MCA partially captures the orbital polarization in favor of the in-plane $xy$ orbital, although not as strong as in the DMFT-converged results obtained with QMC. However, when performing a one-shot impurity calculation initialized with the DFMT-QMC results, MCA yields orbital occupations which show a stronger charge polarization in favor of orbital $xy$. This suggests that our approach can be used to study multiorbital impurity problems when the focus is to assess properties without performing the full DMFT self-consistent loop. Finally, under applied bias, we observe a pronounced redistribution of orbital occupations, demonstrating that the method captures bias-driven orbital charge transfer in realistic materials in nonequilibrium conditions.

Title: Boundary compliance selects heterogeneous dynamics in shear-thickening suspensions
Authors: Li-Xin Shi, Meng-Fei Hu, Song-Chuan Zhao
Abstract: The mechanical properties of confining boundaries can fundamentally alter the flow behaviour of shear-thickening suspensions. We study a dense cornstarch suspension sheared beneath a viscous silicone-oil layer, using the oil viscosity to tune boundary compliance. Flow visualisation and rheometry reveal two distinct regimes. With compliant boundaries, long-lived heterogeneities emerge via density waves or persistent clusters, maintained by a balance between interface deformation and particle rearrangement. With more resistant confinement, we observe transient jamming events, marked by abrupt spanning of load-bearing structures across the suspension thickness and the emergence of secondary stress waves. The onset stress of these events remains constant at the DST threshold, independent of bounding viscosity. Our results reveal that boundary compliance selects the lifetime and morphology of heterogeneous structures, offering a means to amplify otherwise short-lived microscopic processes and providing new insight into the interplay between shear thickening, shear jamming, and confinement mechanics.

Title: Broken neural scaling laws in materials science
Authors: Max Großmann, Malte Grunert, Erich Runge
Abstract: In materials science, data are scarce and expensive to generate, whether computationally or experimentally. Therefore, it is crucial to identify how model performance scales with dataset size and model capacity to distinguish between data- and model-limited regimes. Neural scaling laws provide a framework for quantifying this behavior and guide the design of materials datasets and machine learning architectures. Here, we investigate neural scaling laws for a paradigmatic materials science task: predicting the dielectric function of metals, a high-dimensional response that governs how solids interact with light. Using over 200,000 dielectric functions from high-throughput ab initio calculations, we study two multi-objective graph neural networks trained to predict the frequency-dependent complex interband dielectric function and the Drude frequency. We observe broken neural scaling laws with respect to dataset size, whereas scaling with the number of model parameters follows a simple power law that rapidly saturates.

Title: Color Centers and Hyperbolic Phonon Polaritons in Hexagonal Boron Nitride: A New Platform for Quantum Optics
Authors: Jie-Cheng Feng, Johannes Eberle, Sambuddha Chattopadhyay, Johannes Knörzer, Eugene Demler, Ataç İmamoğlu
Abstract: Hyperbolic phonon polaritons (HPPs) in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) confine mid-infrared light to deep-subwavelength scales and may offer a powerful route to strong light-matter interactions. Generation and control of HPPs are typically accessed using classical near-field probes, which limits experiments at the quantum level.A complementary frontier in hBN research focuses on color centers: bright, stable, atomically localized emitters that have rapidly emerged as a promising platform for solid-state quantum optics. Here we establish a key connection between these two directions by developing a cavity-QED framework in which a single hBN color center serves as a quantum source of HPPs. We quantify the emitter-HPP interaction and analyze two generation schemes. The first is spontaneous emission into the phonon sideband, which can produce single-HPP events and, in ultrathin slabs, becomes single-mode with an enhanced decay rate. The second is a stimulated Raman process that provides frequency selectivity, tunable conversion rate, and narrowband excitation. This drive launches spatially confined, ray-like HPPs that propagate over micrometer distances. We also outline a two-emitter correlation measurement that can directly test the single-polariton character of these emissions. By connecting color-center quantum optics with hyperbolic polaritonics, our approach enables quantum emitters to act as on-chip quantum sources and controls for HPPs, while HPPs provide long-range channels that couple spatially separated emitters. Together, these capabilities point to a new direction for mid-infrared photonic experiments that unite strong coupling, spectral selectivity, and spatial reach within a single material system.

Title: Questionable van der Waals Epitaxy of Non-Layered Materials on Fluorophlogopite Mica: The Case of ScN
Authors: Susmita Chowdhury, Faezeh Alijan Farzad Lahiji, Mikael Ottoson, Olivier Donzel-Gargand, Robert J. W. Frost, Martin Magnuson, Ganpati Ramanath, Arnaud le Febvrier, Per Eklund
Abstract: Growing stress-free epitaxial films by van der Waals epitaxy (vdWE) is of interest for realizing flexible optoelectronics and energy conversion devices from freestanding materials released from substrates that template epitaxy. Often, vdWE is presumed on substrates with layers held together by vdW bonding, e.g., mica, without sufficient theoretical basis or experimental evidence. Here, in case of NaCl metal nitrides, we demonstrate the thin film growth of single-domain ScN(111) by conventional epitaxy on fluorophlogopite mica(001) by sputter deposition. X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy reveal that the film/substrate epitaxial relationship is specified by [-101](111)ScN||[010](001)mica. The strong dependence of the (111) interplanar spacings with film thickness crystals indicates compressive stress buildup, which rules out the possibility of vdWE. These results are contrary to, and refute, prior claims of vdWE of non-layered metal nitrides on mica. Our findings suggest that conventional epitaxy should be the default assumption for non-layered materials unless conditions for vdWE are explicitly established.

Title: Anomalous thermoelectric and thermal Hall effects in irradiated altermagnets
Authors: Fang Qin, Xiao-Bin Qiang
Abstract: In this study, we show that a $d$-wave altermagnet can be transformed into a Chern insulator by irradiating it with elliptically polarized light from a high-frequency photon beam. We further explore the intrinsic anomalous thermoelectric and thermal Hall effects in light-irradiated altermagnets. At extremely low temperatures, the thermoelectric Hall coefficient, which exhibits a linear temperature dependence for the thermoelectric Hall conductivity, vanishes within the gapped region between the conduction and valence bands. However, it displays peaks and dips at the boundaries of the gap, suggesting that thermoelectric Hall conductivity can be used to probe the bandwidth. Similarly, the low-temperature thermal Hall coefficient, which also shows a linear temperature dependence for the thermal Hall conductivity, becomes quantized in the gapped region between the conduction and valence bands. This quantization indicates that thermal Hall conductivity can serve as a probe for the topological properties of the system.

Title: Orthogonal Superposition Rheometry of soft core-shell microgels
Authors: Panagiota Bogri, Gabriele Pagani, Jan Vermant, Joris Sprakel, George Petekidis
Abstract: The mechanisms of flow in suspensions of soft particles above the glass-transition volume fraction and in the jammed state were probed using Orthogonal Superposition Rheometry (OSR). A small amplitude oscillatory shear flow is superimposed orthogonally onto a steady shear flow, which allows monitoring the viscoelastic spectra of sheared jammed core-shell microgels during flow. The characteristic crossover frequency {\omega}c, deduced from the viscoelastic spectrum, provides information about the shear induced structural relaxation time, which is connected to the microscopic yielding mechanism of cage breaking. The shear rate evolution of the crossover frequency is used to achieve a superposition of all spectra and get a better insight of the flow mechanism. Despite their inherent softness, the hybrid core-shell microgels exhibit similarities with hard sphere-like flow behavior, with the main difference that for the microgels the transition from a glassy to a jammed state introduces a volume fraction dependence of the scaling of {\omega}c with shear rate. We further check the application of the Kramers-Kronig relations on the experimental low strain amplitude OSR data finding a good agreement. Finally, the low frequency response at high strain rates was investigated with open bottom cell geometry and instrumental limits were identified. Based on these limits, we discuss previous OSR data and findings in repulsive and attractive colloidal glasses, and compared them with the current soft particle gels.

Abstract: We present a nematic response function model (NRFM) for fit-free direct extraction of the characteristic time of ultrafast electronic thermalization in iron-based superconductors, materials with electronic nematicity. By combining the NRFM for polarization-dependent pump--probe measurements of electronic nematic response with the two-temperature model (TTM) for sub-picosecond quasiparticle relaxation, we quantify the electronic thermalization timescales and their anisotropy. The nematic response function is modeled as the difference of normalized reflectivity signals, revealing a pronounced sub-picosecond extremum in signal evolution that directly yields the characteristic electronic thermalization time. This method demonstrates that the NRFM is consistent with TTM fits of transient optical response, yielding electronic thermalization time constants on the order of 110--230~fs for the FeSe$_{1-x}$Te$_x$ and Ba(Fe$_{0.92}$Co$_{0.08}$)$_2$As$_2$ thin films. The proposed approach can be applied to any material that exhibits electronic nematicity, providing a powerful tool for direct mapping of the relaxation time in nematic materials, avoiding complex experimental data-fitting procedures.

Title: Vortex formation in the Vicsek model with internal chirality of self-propelling objects
Authors: W. T. Gozdz, A. Ciach
Abstract: Effect of internal chirality on collective motion of large number of active objects is studied by simulations of appropriately modified Vicsek model. We add a fixed angle to the noise and consider small ratios, p, between this angle and the maximal deviation from the average local direction of motion. When the above ratio is p=1/120, the traveling bands observed with the symmetrical noise are destroyed, and small bands moving in different directions appear. Circular rotating flocks of objects with the same orientation are formed for p=1/7.5. Stable vortexes in the stationary state were found from p=1/60 to p=1/20. Velocity autocorrelation function shows equilibrium between the inflow and the outflow to and from the vortex. Long-time evolution is significantly influenced by a temporary trapping of the objects in the vortex. The ballistic behavior for the symmetrical noise changes to the diffusive behavior for the chirality leading to the onset of vortexes.

Title: Suppressed coarsening after an interaction quench in the Holstein chain
Authors: Ho Jang, Gia-Wei Chern
Abstract: We investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics induced by an interaction quench in the semiclassical Holstein model within the Ehrenfest nonadiabatic framework, which describes an isolated hybrid quantum-classical system with strictly conserved total energy. Focusing on the half-filled case, where the equilibrium ground state exhibits commensurate charge-density-wave (CDW) order for any nonzero coupling, we identify three distinct post-quench dynamical regimes as a function of the final electron-phonon coupling: a nonequilibrium metallic state without CDW order, an intermediate regime characterized by slow scale-invariant ordering dynamics, and a frozen CDW state with arrested coarsening and immobile kinks. We analyze the intermediate regime in detail and uncover an unconventional algebraic decay of the kink density, $n \sim t^{-1/3}$, distinct from both ballistic annihilation and diffusive coarsening in classical dissipative systems. We show that this anomalous exponent arises from the hybrid nature of the dynamics: while the lattice evolves deterministically, the electronic degrees of freedom act as an effective internal bath that induces diffusive kink motion without energy dissipation. An effective reaction-diffusion description, incorporating both annihilation and elastic scattering of kinks, quantitatively accounts for the observed scaling behavior. Our results reveal a distinct coarsening mechanism in isolated hybrid systems, demonstrating how internal quantum dynamics can qualitatively reshape defect kinetics far from equilibrium.

Title: The weak and strong disorder regimes in the continuous random field Ising model
Authors: G. O. Heymans, N. F. Svaiter, B. F. Svaiter, A. M. S. Macêdo
Abstract: We present a nonperturbative analysis of the weak- and strong-disorder regimes of the continuous random-field Ising model using the distributional zeta-function method. By performing the quenched-disorder average at the level of the effective action, we derive exact quadratic and interaction terms. In the weak-disorder limit, we show that the infrared structure of the two-point correlation functions yields a decomposition of the physical field into correlated components with distinct scaling dimensions. This mechanism exhibits the characteristic $1/p^4$ behavior, which shifts the upper critical dimension to $d_c^{+}=6$. The universal critical behavior of the RFIM near this dimension is governed by a minimal infrared effective action. In the strong-disorder regime, we obtain an exact diagonal quadratic action with a discrete spectrum of massive modes. Here, the absence of massless modes implies the absence of conventional criticality. The resulting spectral representation of correlation functions converges rapidly and remains well controlled in the infrared regime.

Authors: Pierre Kawak, William F. Drayer, David S. Simmons
Abstract: AMDAT (Amorphous Molecular Dynamics Analysis Toolkit) is an open-source C++ toolkit for post-processing molecular dynamics trajectories, focused on high-performance static and dynamic analyses of amorphous, glassy, and polymer materials, including supercooled liquids and complex fluids. In this paper, we describe AMDAT's design for efficient long-timescale analysis via in-memory trajectory handling and exponential time sampling, and we demonstrate representative workflows for widely used observables such as radial distribution functions, structure factors, intermediate scattering functions, and neighbor correlations.

Title: Low-temperature spin dynamics in LAFO thin films: from cubic anisotropy to TLS-limited coherence
Authors: Srishti Pal, Guanxiong Qu, Hervé M. Carruzzo, Katya Mikhailova, Lerato Takana, Qin Xu, Yuri Suzuki, Clare C. Yu, Gregory D. Fuchs
Abstract: We investigate the low-temperature spin dynamics of epitaxial lithium aluminum ferrite (LAFO) thin films using broadband ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) spectroscopy from 0.44 K to 68 K. The results reveal a crossover from conventional cubic anisotropy-dominated behavior at higher temperatures to pronounced linewidth broadening and higher-order anisotropy contributions at cryogenic temperatures. With the magnetic field oriented along the [100] crystallographic direction, the resonance is well-captured by four-fold in-plane and out-of-plane uniaxial anisotropies. In contrast, measurements with the field along the [110] direction reveal the presence of an unusually large sixth-order cubic anisotropy term that is symmetry-suppressed for [100] but becomes apparent under this field orientation at ultralow temperatures, indicating a substantial modification of the anisotropy landscape. Independent linewidth analysis shows a pronounced peak near 8 K and a subtle monotonic enhancement with decreasing temperatures below 2 K, features consistent with dissipation mediated by a bath of two-level systems (TLS) arising from antisite defects and localized Fe$^{3+}$ moments. Comparison with TLS-based models demonstrates that both exchange-coupled impurities and nearly free paramagnetic centers contribute to the observed damping. Our results establish LAFO as a model ferrite system where disorder-induced TLS limit spin coherence at ultralow temperatures, providing new insights into anisotropy engineering, magnetic relaxation, and the design of ferrimagnetic insulators for coherent magnonics. These findings offer a framework for future optimization of growth conditions.

Title: Topological piezomagnetic effect in two-dimensional Dirac quadrupole altermagnets
Authors: H. Radhakrishnan, B. Bell, C. Ortix, J. W. F. Venderbos
Abstract: Altermagnets provide a natural platform for studying and exploiting piezomagnetism. In this paper, we introduce a class of insulating altermagnets in two dimensions (2D) referred to as Dirac quadrupole altermagnets, and show based on microscopic minimal models that the orbital piezomagnetic polarizability of such altermagnets has a topological contribution described by topological response theory. The essential low-energy electronic structure of Dirac quadrupole altermagnets can be understood from a gapless parent phase (i.e., the Dirac quadrupole semimetal), which has important implications for their response to external fields. Focusing on the strain-induced response, here we demonstrate that the topological piezomagnetic effect is a consequence of the way in which strain affects the Dirac points forming a quadrupole. We consider two microscopic models: a spinless two-band model describing a band inversion of $s$ and $d$ states, and a Lieb lattice model with collinear Néel order. The latter is a prototypical minimal model for altermagnetism in 2D and is realized in a number of recently proposed material compounds, which are discussed.

Title: Giant bubbles of Fisher zeros in the quantum XY chain
Authors: Songtai Lv, Yang Liu, Erhai Zhao, Haiyuan Zou, Tao Xiang
Abstract: We demonstrate an alternative approach based on complex-valued inverse temperature and partition function to probe quantum phases of matter with nontrivial spectra and dynamics. It leverages thermofield dynamics (TFD) to quantitatively characterize quantum and thermal fluctuations, and exploit the correspondence between low-energy excitations and Fisher zeros. Using the quantum XY chain in an external field as a testbed, we show that the oscillatory gap behavior manifests as oscillations in the long-time dynamics of the TFD spectral form factor. We also identify giant bubbles, i.e. large-scale closed lines, of Fisher-zeros near the gapless XX limit. They provide a characteristic energy scale that seems to contradict the predictions of the low energy theory of a featureless Luttinger liquid. We identify this energy scale and relate the motion of these giant bubbles with varying external field to the transfer of spectral weight from high to low energies. The deep connection between Fisher zeros, dynamics, and excitations opens up promising avenues for understanding the unconventional gap behaviors in strongly correlated many-body systems.

Title: Reducing the Computational Cost Scaling of Tensor Network Algorithms via Field-Programmable Gate Array Parallelism
Authors: Songtai Lv, Yang Liang, Rui Zhu, Qibin Zheng, Haiyuan Zou
Abstract: Improving the computational efficiency of quantum many-body calculations from a hardware perspective remains a critical challenge. Although field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) have recently been exploited to improve the computational scaling of algorithms such as Monte Carlo methods, their application to tensor network algorithms is still at an early stage. In this work, we propose a fine-grained parallel tensor network design based on FPGAs to substantially enhance the computational efficiency of two representative tensor network algorithms: the infinite time-evolving block decimation (iTEBD) and the higher-order tensor renormalization group (HOTRG). By employing a quad-tile partitioning strategy to decompose tensor elements and map them onto hardware circuits, our approach effectively translates algorithmic computational complexity into scalable hardware resource utilization, enabling an extremely high degree of parallelism on FPGAs. Compared with conventional CPU-based implementations, our scheme exhibits superior scalability in computation time, reducing the bond-dimension scaling of the computational cost from $O(D_b^3)$ to $O(D_b)$ for iTEBD and from $O(D_b^6)$ to $O(D_b^2)$ for HOTRG. This work provides a theoretical foundation for future hardware implementations of large-scale tensor network computations.

Title: Spontaneous Parity Breaking in Quantum Antiferromagnets on the Triangular Lattice
Authors: Songtai Lv, Yuchen Meng, Haiyuan Zou
Abstract: Frustration on the triangular lattice has long been a source of intriguing and often debated phases in many-body systems. Although symmetry analysis has been employed, the role of the seemingly trivial parity symmetry has received little attention. In this work, we show that phases induced by frustration are systematically shaped by an implicit rule of thumb associated with spontaneous parity breaking. This principle enables us to anticipate and rationalize the regimes and conditions under which nontrivial phases emerge. For the spin-$S$ antiferromagnetic XXZ model, we demonstrate that a controversial parity-broken phase appears only at intermediate values of $S$. In bilayer systems, enhanced frustration leads to additional phases, such as supersolids, whose properties can be classified by their characteristic parity features. Benefiting from our improved tensor network contraction techniques, we confirm these results through large-scale tensor-network calculations. This study offers an alternative viewpoint and a systematic approach for examining the interplay between spin, symmetry, and frustration in many-body systems.

Abstract: Understanding heat transport at the nanometer scale is critical for semiconductor devices, quantum materials, and thermal management of nanostructures, yet direct local measurements of thermal conductivity and heat capacity remain scarce. We developed a laser-excitation system integrated into a scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) for nanoscale thermal transport measurements using ultra-high-resolution electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS). A fiber-coupled laser is introduced via a modified aperture mechanism, enabling flexible holder geometries and large tilt angles without optical elements in the polepiece gap. Synchronization of pulsed laser excitation with an externally gated direct electron detector provides temporal resolution about 50 ns at <10 meV energy resolution. Local temperatures are determined via the principle of detailed balance, and thermal transport parameters are extracted by fitting a forward-time central-space heat diffusion model including radiative losses. For amorphous carbon films, we obtain a thermal conductivity of 1.24 $\frac{W}{m\cdot K}$ and a heat capacity of 821 $\frac{J}{kg\cdot K}$, consistent with literature. This framework enables time-resolved nanoscale measurements of thermal transport in materials and devices.

Title: Measurement-Induced Dynamics of Particles and Quasiparticles in a Bose-Einstein-condensate array
Authors: Huy Nguyen, Yu-Xin Wang, Jacob Taylor
Abstract: Measurement plays a crucial role in a quantum system beyond just learning about the system state: it changes the post-measurement state and hence influences the subsequent time evolution; further, measurement can even create entanglement in the post-measurement conditional state. In this work, we study how careful choice of parameters for a typical measurement process on cold atoms systems -- phase contrast imaging -- has a strong impact on both what the experimentalist observes but also on the backaction the measurement has on the system, including the creation and diffusion of quasiparticles emerging from the quantum many-body dynamics. We focus on the case of a Bose-Einstein-condensate array, in the low-temperature and low-momentum limit. Our theoretical investigation reveals regimes where the imaging light probes either the bare particle or quasiparticle dynamics. Moreover, we find a path to selectively measuring quasiparticle modes directly, as well as controlling over the measurement-induced creation and diffusion of quasiparticles into different momentum states. This lays a foundation for understanding the effects of both experimental approaches for probing many-body systems, but also more speculative directions such as observable consequences of `spontaneous collapse' predictions from novel models of quantum gravity on aspects of the Standard Model.

Title: Geometry and dynamical morphology of growing bacterial colonies
Authors: Benjamin Evert Himberg, Sanghita Sengupta
Abstract: We study non-equilibrium bacterial colony growth using a geometry-first, time-resolved analysis of morphology. From time-lapse microscopy data, we track the coupled evolution of area, perimeter, and boundary-sensitive shape descriptors along the full growth history. We find that non-equilibrium growth can exhibit extended intervals of compact area--perimeter scaling with exponent $\alpha \approx 2$, consistent with growth governed by a single effective geometric length scale, as well as time-localized breakdowns of this scaling during ongoing growth. These breakdowns coincide with transient boundary reorganization while bulk area growth remains sustained. Our results demonstrate that visually distinct morphologies can arise within the same geometric growth regime, and that departures from single-scale behavior reflect intrinsic dynamical restructuring rather than growth arrest. More broadly, this work establishes time-resolved geometry as a coarse-grained framework for identifying when non-equilibrium growth departs from single-scale geometric constraints in living systems.

Title: Broadening the temperature range of blue phases using $azo$ compounds of various molecular geometries assembled from modular "LEGO" molecular units
Authors: Igor A. Gvozdovskyy, Vitalii O. Chornous, Halyna V. Bogatyryova, Oleksandr M. Samoilov, Longin N. Lisetski, Serhiy V. Ryabukhin, Yurii V. Dmytriv, Mykhaylo V. Vovk
Abstract: The temperature range of the blue phases (BPs) formed in highly chiral mixtures based on cholesteryl oleyl carbonate (COC) and the nematic liquid crystal E7 was studied in the presence of various chemical structures. The $azo$ compounds used were of both chiral and achiral nature, and their molecular geometry was modified by substitution of modular "LEGO" molecular units of varying alkyl chain lengths and types of bridging groups, which could substantially affect the mesomorphic properties of the matrix mixture. It was shown that in many cases these dopants effectively broadened the BP temperature range. This effect depends on both the variation in the molecular geometry of the $azo$ compounds and the increase in the $cis$-isomer concentration under UV irradiation. The presence of the $cis$-isomers formed have a stronger impact on broadening the BP temperature range than the initial $trans$-isomers. These results demonstrate that the temperature range of BPs can be precisely controlled via a combination of molecular engineering and $trans$-$cis$ photo-isomerization.

Title: Unravelling the emergence of quantum jumps in a monitored qubit
Authors: Barkay Guttel, Danielle Gov, Noam Netzer, Uri Goldblatt, Sergey Hazanov, Lalit M. Joshi, Alessandro Romito, Yuval Gefen, Parveen Kumar, Kyrylo Snizhko, Fabien Lafont, Serge Rosenblum
Abstract: Quantum jumps, the collapse of a quantum system upon measurement, are among the most striking consequences of observation in quantum mechanics. While recent experiments have revealed the continuous nature of individual jumps, the crossover from coherent dynamics to measurement-dominated behaviour has remained elusive. Here, we tune the measurement strength of a continuously monitored superconducting qubit, and observe that quantum jumps emerge not through a gradual crossover, but via a cascade of three distinct dynamical transitions. The first transition manifests as an exceptional point where coherent oscillations abruptly cease, giving way to jumps towards a stable eigenstate. The second transition marks the onset of dynamical state freezing, where the qubit's dwell time near the eigenstate diverges. A third threshold signals entry into the quantum Zeno regime, where stronger measurement paradoxically suppresses relaxation. Strikingly, we find that decoherence does not blur these transitions but rather fundamentally restructures the dynamical phase diagram, notably inverting their order. These results map measurement-induced transitions in a monitored qubit, revealing that the interplay between coherent driving, measurement, and decoherence gives rise to a hierarchy of distinct dynamical phases.

Title: Emergence of Krylov complexity through quantum walks: An exploration of the quantum origins of complexity
Authors: Dimitrios Patramanis, Watse Sybesma
Abstract: In this work we study the relationship between quantum random walks on graphs and Krylov/spread complexity. We show that the latter's definition naturally emerges through a canonical method of reducing a graph to a chain, on which we can identify the usual Krylov structure. We use this identification to construct families of graphs corresponding to special classes of systems with known complexity features and conversely, to compute Krylov complexity for graphs of physical interest. The two main outcomes are the analytic computation of the Lanczos coefficients for the SYK model for an arbitrary number $q$ of interacting fermions and the complete characterization of Krylov complexity for the hypercube graph in any number of dimensions. The latter serves as the starting point for an in-depth comparison between Krylov and circuit complexities as they purportedly arise in the context of black holes. We find that while under certain conditions Krylov complexity follows the growth and saturation pattern ascribed to such systems, the timescale at which saturation happens can generally be shorter than what is predicted by random unitary circuits, due to the effects of quantum speed-ups commonly occurring when comparing quantum and classical random walks.

Title: Improving 3d Ising OPE Coefficients with Fuzzy Sphere Conformal Generators
Authors: Giulia Fardelli, A. Liam Fitzpatrick, Emanuel Katz
Abstract: We use the $K$ special conformal generator in the Fuzzy sphere setup of the Ising CFT to determine primary states. For $\Delta \lesssim 8$, we recover the known primaries and find several new ones, including in the parity-odd sector. We then use these primaries to compute OPE coefficients. We find that using primaries constructed from special-$K$ allows for better extrapolation of OPE coefficients to the CFT limit, because of the existence of an $O(1)$ gap between primaries and descendants in the spectrum of eigenvalues of $|K|^2$ which protects the primaries from strongly mixing with descendants. We compare the CFT data we obtain with the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis.

Title: Topological frustration and quantum resources
Authors: Alberto Giuseppe Catalano, Gianpaolo Torre, Salvatore Marco Giampaolo, Fabio Franchini
Abstract: Although in general boundary conditions do not affect the bulk properties of a system, some of them are special and defy such expectation. This is the case, for instance, of those inducing geometrical frustration in a classical magnet. Recently, the study of such settings in quantum systems (dubbed topological frustration) has uncovered peculiar features, interesting both from a fundamental and technological point of view. In this work, we present and discuss the behavior of several quantum resources in presence of TF, namely the (disconnected) entanglement entropy and the non-stabilizerness Renyi entropy. We will show that, compared to their non-frustrated counterparts, TF adds a distinct contribution to these resources, due to a stable, delocalized, topological excitation. Remarkably, this contribution can be calculated analytically, due to its similarities with that of a W-state.

Title: Taming multiparty entanglement at measurement-induced phase transitions
Authors: Liuke Lyu, James Allen, Yi Hong Teoh, Roger G Melko, William Witczak-Krempa
Abstract: Measurement-induced phase transitions (MIPT) give rise to novel dynamical states of quantum matter realized by balancing unitary evolution and measurements. We present large-scale numerical simulations of a trapped-ion native MIPT, argued to belong to the universality class described by the Haar non-unitary conformal field theory. First, through a finite-size analysis we obtained the critical measurement rate, and correlation length exponent, which falls close to the percolation value. Second, by leveraging a monotone computable via semi-definite programming, we uncover robust algebraic decay of genuine multiparty entanglement (GME) versus separation for 2, 3, and 4 parties. The corresponding critical exponents are lower-bounded by those of the multiparty mutual information, which we determine up to 4 parties, and conjecture to be (k+2) for k parties. Additionally, we derive lower bounds for both GME and multiparty mutual information.

Title: Optimization of random phase approximation calculations for improved energies of molecules, solids, and surfaces
Authors: Neung-Kyung Yu, Johannes Voss, Andrew J. Medford
Abstract: We present an optimized random phase approximation method (optRPA26) that significantly improves upon conventional RPA. The method employs an empirically constructed hybrid functional to generate DFT orbitals to evaluate the RPA correlation energy, which is then scaled by a constant. Comprehensive benchmarks across molecules, bulk solids, and surface systems demonstrate that optRPA26 consistently achieves high accuracy, with mean absolute errors of 0.05 eV for W4-11 reaction energies, 0.07 eV for cohesive energies, 0.09 eV for metal oxide formation energies, 0.11-0.12 eV for adsorption of small molecules on metals, and 0.06 eV for adsorption on oxides. In addition, optRPA26 correctly captures phase stability in metal oxides and magnetic metals. The optRPA26 approach can be run using standard RPA implementations, highlighting its potential as a general-purpose reference method that can accurately capture covalent, ionic, and metallic, and van der Waals bonding in molecules, solids, and interfaces.

Title: Quantum Sequential Circuits
Authors: D.-S. Wang
Abstract: This work introduces and characterizes quantum sequential circuits (QSCs) as a hardware-oriented paradigm for quantum computing, built upon a novel foundational element termed the quantum transistor. Unlike conventional qubit-based architectures, QSCs employ symmetry-protected topological junctions where quantum gates are encoded as Choi states via channel-state duality and activated through bulk measurements, utilizing ebits to realize the functional analog of feedback loops in classical sequential circuits. This framework establishes a universal model for quantum computation that inherently incorporates memory and temporal sequencing, complementing existing combinational quantum circuit model. Our work advances the conceptual bridge towards a quantum von Neumann architecture, underscoring the potential of hybrid and modular design principles for the development of large-scale, integrated quantum information processors.

Authors: Porhouy Minh, Sapna Sarupria
Abstract: The study by Jung et al. (Jung H, Covino R, Arjun A, et al., Nat Comput Sci. 3:334-345 (2023)) introduced Artificial Intelligence for Molecular Mechanism Discovery (AIMMD), a novel sampling algorithm that integrates machine learning to enhance the efficiency of transition path sampling (TPS). By enabling on-the-fly estimation of the committor probability and simultaneously deriving a human-interpretable reaction coordinate, AIMMD offers a robust framework for elucidating the mechanistic pathways of complex molecular processes. This commentary provides a discussion and critical analysis of the core AIMMD framework, explores its recent extensions, and offers an assessment of the method's potential impact and limitations.

Title: Towards Worst-Case Guarantees with Scale-Aware Interpretability
Authors: Lauren Greenspan, David Berman, Aryeh Brill, Ro Jefferson, Artemy Kolchinsky, Jennifer Lin, Andrew Mack, Anindita Maiti, Fernando E. Rosas, Alexander Stapleton, Lucas Teixeira, Dmitry Vaintrob
Abstract: Neural networks organize information according to the hierarchical, multi-scale structure of natural data. Methods to interpret model internals should be similarly scale-aware, explicitly tracking how features compose across resolutions and guaranteeing bounds on the influence of fine-grained structure that is discarded as irrelevant noise. We posit that the renormalisation framework from physics can meet this need by offering technical tools that can overcome limitations of current methods. Moreover, relevant work from adjacent fields has now matured to a point where scattered research threads can be synthesized into practical, theory-informed tools. To combine these threads in an AI safety context, we propose a unifying research agenda -- \emph{scale-aware interpretability} -- to develop formal machinery and interpretability tools that have robustness and faithfulness properties supported by statistical physics.

Title: Quantum-Inspired Algorithm for Classical Spin Hamiltonians Based on Matrix Product Operators
Authors: Ryo Watanabe, Joseph Tindall, Shohei Miyakoshi, Hiroshi Ueda
Abstract: We propose a tensor-network (TN) approach for solving classical optimization problems that is inspired by spectral filtering and sampling on quantum states. We first shift and scale an Ising Hamiltonian of the cost function so that all eigenvalues become non-negative and the ground states correspond to the the largest eigenvalues, which are then amplified by power iteration. We represent the transformed Hamiltonian as a matrix product operator (MPO) and form an immense power of this object via truncated MPO-MPO contractions, embedding the resulting operator into a matrix product state for sampling in the computational basis. In contrast to the density-matrix renormalization group, our approach provides a straightforward route to systematic improvement by increasing the bond dimension and is better at avoiding local minima. We also study the performance of this power method in the context of a higher-order Ising Hamiltonian on a heavy-hexagonal lattice, making a comparison with simulated annealing. These results highlight the potential of quantum-inspired algorithms for solving optimization problems and provide a baseline for assessing and developing quantum algorithms.

Title: Unified criteria for crystallization in hard-core lattice systems with applications to polyomino fluids and chiral mixtures
Authors: Qidong He
Abstract: We present a unified extension of two sets of criteria for high-fugacity crystallization in hard-core lattice systems developed previously by Jauslin, Lebowitz, and the author. Our new criterion is formulated in terms of the existence of a volume allocation rule with desirable properties, in analogy to the scoring function constructed in Hales' proof of the Kepler conjecture. The proof uses a recent systematic extension of Pirogov--Sinai theory to systems with infinite interactions by Mazel--Stuhl--Suhov. Notably, our result applies to a large class of polyomino models with discrete rotational degrees of freedom and chiral mixtures thereof.

Authors: Kristina Frizyuk, Evgenii Menshikov, Mauro Spera
Abstract: In this paper, we provide an accurate description of geometric phases emerging in simple optical systems -- nanostructures (metaatoms) interacting with vortex beams. We show that this interaction leads to a new class of geometric phase for optical beams, which is different from the geometric phases commonly discussed in structured-light optics. We compare this setting to the usual description of geometric phases for beams and show that the underlying geometry is different.

Title: Quantum statistical functions
Authors: Haruki Emori
Abstract: Statistical functions such as the moment-generating function, characteristic function, cumulant-generating function, and second characteristic function are cornerstone tools in classical statistics and probability theory. They provide a powerful means to analyze the statistical properties of a system and find applications in diverse fields, including statistical physics and field theory. While these functions are ubiquitous in classical theory, a quantum counterpart has remained elusive due to the fundamental hurdle of noncommutativity of operators. The lack of such a framework has obscured the deep connections between standard statistical measures and the non-classical features of quantum mechanics. Here, we establish a comprehensive framework for quantum statistical functions that transcends these limitations, naturally unifying the disparate languages of standard quantum statistics, quasiprobability distributions, and weak values. We show that these functions, defined as expectation values with respect to the purified state, naturally reproduce fundamental quantum statistical quantities like expectation values, variance, and covariance upon differentiation. Crucially, by extending this framework to include the concepts of pre- and post-selection, we define conditional quantum statistical functions that uniquely yield weak values and weak variance. We further demonstrate that multivariable quantum statistical functions, when defined with specific operator orderings, correspond to well-known quasiprobability distributions. Our framework provides a cohesive mathematical structure that not only reproduces standard quantum statistical measures but also incorporates nonclassical features of quantum mechanics, thus laying the foundation for a deeper understanding of quantum statistics.

Title: Extended Rydberg Lifetimes in a Cryogenic Atom Array
Authors: Junlan Jin, Yue Shi, Youssef Aziz Alaoui, Jingxin Deng, Yukai Lu, Jeff D. Thompson, Waseem S. Bakr
Abstract: We report on the realization of a $^{133}$Cs optical tweezer array in a cryogenic blackbody radiation (BBR) environment. By enclosing the array within a 4K radiation shield, we measure long Rydberg lifetimes, up to $406 (36)\,\mu$s for the $55 P_{3/2}$ Rydberg state, a factor of 3.3(3) longer than the room-temperature value. We employ single-photon coupling for coherent manipulation of the ground-Rydberg qubit. We measure a small differential dynamic polarizability of the transition, beneficial for reducing dephasing due to light intensity fluctuations. Our results pave the path for advancing neutral-atom two-qubit gate fidelities as their error budgets become increasingly dominated by $T_1$ relaxation of the ground-Rydberg qubit.

Title: Dissipative Dicke Time Quasicrystals
Authors: Sk Anisur, Sayan Choudhury
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of time quasicrystals (TQCs) in the open Dicke model, subjected to a quasi-periodic Fibonacci drive. TQCs are characterized by a robust sub-harmonic quasi-periodic response that is qualitatively distinct from the external drive. By directly analyzing the dynamics of the system in the thermodynamic limit, we establish the existence of TQC order in this system for a wide parameter regime. Remarkably, we demonstrate that this behavior persists even in the deep quantum regime with only two qubits. We systematically study the dependence of the TQC lifetime, $\tau^{\ast}$, on the number of qubits and demonstrate that $\tau^{\ast}$ increases monotonically with the system size. Our work demonstrates that quasi-periodically driven dissipative quantum systems can serve as a powerful platform for realizing novel non-equilibrium phases of matter.

Title: Buckling mediated by mobile localized elastic excitations
Authors: R. S. Hutton, E. Vitral, E. Hamm, J. A. Hanna
Abstract: Experiments reveal that structural transitions in thin sheets are mediated by the passage of transient and stable mobile localized elastic excitations. These ``crumples'' or ``d-cones'' nucleate, propagate, interact, annihilate, and escape. Much of the dynamics occurs on millisecond time scales. Nucleation sites correspond to regions where generators of the ideal unstretched surface converge. Additional stable intermediate states illustrate two forms of quasistatic inter-crumple interaction through ridges or valleys. These interactions create pairs from which extended patterns may be constructed in larger specimens. The onset of localized transient deformation with increasing sheet size is correlated with a characteristic stable crumple size, whose measured scaling with thickness is consistent with prior theory and experiment for localized elastic features in thin sheets. We offer a new theoretical justification of this scaling.

Title: Extended Landauer-Büttiker Formula for Current through Open Quantum Systems with Gain or Loss
Authors: Chao Yang, Yucheng Wang
Abstract: The Landauer-Büttiker formula, which characterizes the current flowing through a finite region connected to leads, has significantly advanced our understanding of transport. We extend this formula to describe particle and energy currents with gain or loss in the intermediate region by using the Lindblad-Keldysh formalism. Based on the derived formula, several novel effects induced by gain or loss in the current are discussed: the breaking of inversion symmetry in the gain and loss terms or in the system can lead to current generation; the anomalous phenomenon that disorder can induce current generation; the presence of gain and loss makes the thermal and electrical conductances continuous and ensures they follow the Wiedemann-Franz law even outside the energy band; the effect of bond loss-induced skin effect on current. This work deepens and extends our understanding of transport phenomena in open systems.

Title: Characteristic oscillations in frequency-resolved heat dissipation of linear time-delayed Langevin systems: Approach from the violation of the fluctuation-response relation
Authors: Xin Wang, Ruicheng Bao, Naruo Ohga
Abstract: Time-delayed effects are widely present in nature, often accompanied by distinctive nonequilibrium features, such as negative apparent heat dissipation. To elucidate detailed structures of the dissipation, we study the frequency decomposition of the heat dissipation in linear time-delayed Langevin systems. We decompose the heat dissipation into frequency spectrum using the Harada-Sasa equality, which relates the heat dissipation to the violation of the fluctuation-response relation (FRR). We find a characteristic oscillatory behavior in the spectrum, and the oscillation asymptotically decays with an envelope inversely proportional to the frequency in the high-frequency region. Furthermore, the oscillation over the low-frequency region reflects the magnitude and sign of the heat dissipation. We confirm the generality of the results by extending our analysis to systems with multiple delay times. Since the violation of FRR is experimentally accessible, our results suggest an experimental direction for detecting and analyzing detailed characteristics of dissipation in time-delayed systems.

Title: Impact of light-matter coupling strength on the efficiency of microcavity OLEDs: A unified quantum master equation approach
Authors: Olli Siltanen, Kimmo Luoma, Konstantinos S. Daskalakis
Abstract: Controlling light-matter interactions is emerging as a powerful strategy to enhance the performance of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). By embedding the emissive layer in planar microcavities or other modified optical environments, excitons can couple to photonic modes, enabling new regimes of device operation. In the weak-coupling regime, the Purcell effect can accelerate radiative decay, while in the strong-coupling regime, excitons and photons hybridize to form entirely new energy eigenstates with altered dynamics. These effects offer potential solutions to key challenges in OLEDs, such as triplet accumulation and efficiency roll-off, yet demonstrations in the strong-coupling case remain sparse and modest. To systematically understand and optimize photodynamics across the different coupling regimes, we develop a unified quantum master equation model for microcavity OLEDs. The model is then applied to estimate device performance in the different coupling regimes to determine which one is the best.

Title: On the correlation between entanglement and the negative sign problem
Authors: Ping Xu, Yang Shen, Yuan-Yao He, Mingpu Qin
Abstract: In this work, we study the correlation between entanglement and the negative sign problem in quantum Monte Carlo for the simulation of low-dimensional strongly correlated quantum many body systems. Entanglement entropy characterizes the difficulty of many-body simulation with tensor network state related methods, while the average sign measures the difficulty in many-body simulation for a variety of quantum Monte Carlo methods. Although there exist cases where one type of method works better than the other, it is desirable to find the possible correlation between entanglement and average sign for general hard strongly correlated systems regarding computational complexity. We take the doped two-dimensional Hubbard model as an example and numerically calculate the doping evolution of both the entanglement in the ground state with Density Matrix Renormalization Group and the average sign in the Auxiliary Field Quantum Monte Carlo simulation at low temperature. The results show that they are indeed correlated. The entanglement entropy (average sign) shows a peak (dip) around 20% doping, indicating that it is the difficult region for both methods. The vicinity of 20% doping is also the most intriguing region in both the Hubbard model and cuprate high-Tc superconductors where competing states with close energy intertwine with each other. Recognizing the correlation between entanglement and average sign provides new insight into our understanding of the difficulty in the simulation of strongly correlated quantum many-body systems.

Title: A physics-based data-driven model for CO$_2$ gas diffusion electrodes to drive automated laboratories
Authors: Ivan Grega, Félix Therrien, Abhishek Soni, Karry Ocean, Kevan Dettelbach, Ribwar Ahmadi, Mehrdad Mokhtari, Curtis P. Berlinguette, Yoshua Bengio
Abstract: The electrochemical reduction of atmospheric CO$_2$ into high-energy molecules with renewable energy is a promising avenue for energy storage that can take advantage of existing infrastructure especially in areas where sustainable alternatives to fossil fuels do not exist. Automated laboratories are currently being developed and used to optimize the composition and operating conditions of gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs), the device in which this reaction takes place. Improving the efficiency of GDEs is crucial for this technology to become viable. Here we present a modeling framework to efficiently explore the high-dimensional parameter space of GDE designs in an active learning context. At the core of the framework is an uncertainty-aware physics model calibrated with experimental data. The model has the flexibility to capture various input parameter spaces and any carbon products which can be modeled with Tafel kinetics. It is interpretable, and a Gaussian process layer can capture deviations of real data from the function space of the physical model itself. We deploy the model in a simulated active learning setup with real electrochemical data gathered by the AdaCarbon automated laboratory and show that it can be used to efficiently traverse the multi-dimensional parameter space.

Title: Torsional Hall Viscosity of Massive Chern Insulators: Magnetic Field and Momentum Deformations
Authors: Ioannis Matthaiakakis, Weizhen Jia, Raffael L. Klees, David Rodríguez Fernández, Zhuo-Yu Xian, René Meyer, Johanna Erdmenger, Ewelina M. Hankiewicz
Abstract: This work focuses on the non-dissipative, parity-odd spin transport of $(2+1)$-dimensional relativistic electrons, generated by torsion, and the torsional Hall viscosity $\zeta_{\rm H}$. We first determine $\zeta_{\rm H}$ for massive Dirac fermions in the presence of a constant electromagnetic field. We predict that the magnetic field induces a contribution to $\zeta_{\rm H}$ competing with the one originating from the Dirac mass. Moreover, we quantify the impact on $\zeta_{\rm H}$ originating from the band structure deformation quadratic in momentum terms that was proposed by Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang (BHZ). We find that the BHZ deformation substantially enhances $\zeta_{\rm H}$ in magnitude as measured in a domain wall configuration, when compared to the free Dirac fermion result. Nevertheless, the torsional Hall viscosity still discriminates between topologically trivial and non-trivial regimes. Our results, hence, pave the way for a deeper understanding of hydrodynamic spin transport and its possible verification in experiments.

Title: Quantum theory of magnetic octupole in periodic crystals and application to $d$-wave altermagnets
Authors: Takumi Sato, Satoru Hayami
Abstract: Magnetic multipoles have been recognized as order parameters characterizing magnetic structure in solids. Recently, magnetic octupoles have been proposed as the order parameters of time-reversal-symmetry breaking centrosymmetric antiferromagnets exhibiting nonrelativistic spin splitting, which is referred to as ``altermagnet''. However, a gauge-invariant formulation of magnetic octupoles in crystalline solids remains elusive. Here, we present a gauge-invariant expression of spin magnetic octupoles in periodic crystals based on quantum mechanics and thermodynamics, which can be used to quantitatively characterize time-reversal-symmetry breaking antiferromagnets including $d$-wave altermagnets. The allowed physical response tensors are classified beyond symmetry considerations, and direct relationships are established for some of them in insulators at zero temperature. Furthermore, our expression reveals a contribution from an anisotropic magnetic dipole, which has the same symmetry as conventional spin and orbital magnetic dipoles but carries no net magnetization. We discuss the relation between the anisotropic magnetic dipole and the anomalous Hall effect.

Title: Statistics within UV-Visible Absorption Spectrum of Ethanolic Azobenzene
Authors: Eemeli A. Eronen, Johannes Niskanen
Abstract: We report a statistical simulation of the UV--visible absorption spectrum of {\it trans}-azobenzene in ethanol solution. Due to intermolecular interactions, the used explicit solvent environment necessitates accounting for numerous transitions for a spectrum covering the two energetically lowest lines, S$_1$ and S$_2$. Furthermore, the spectrum manifests vast variation as a function of the underlying local structure, in conjunction with previous observations for spectra of liquids in the X-ray regime. We disentangle the complex structure--spectrum relationship using a machine learning-based method known as the emulator-based component analysis. This structural decomposition outperforms commonly used principal component analysis in explained spectral variation and reveals a small subset of latent structural variables responsible for the total spectral variance. Among other structural characteristics, blueshifting of the S$_2$ peak occurs with fewer hydrogen bonds with the ethanol solvent, and a contracted N=N bond within the C--N=N--C bridge. The observed structural dependence of the absorption spectrum thus implies an overrepresentation of certain structural classes after a photoexcitation, potentially significant for the subsequent nuclear dynamics, photophysics, and photochemistry.

Title: Manipulating the topological spin of Majoranas
Authors: Stijn R. de Wit, Emre Duman, A. Mert Bozkurt, Alexander Brinkman, Inanc Adagideli
Abstract: The non-Abelian exchange statistics of Majorana zero modes make them interesting for both technological applications and fundamental research. Unlike their non-Abelian counterpart, the Abelian contribution, $e^{i\theta}$, where $\theta$ is directly related to the Majorana's topological spin, is often neglected. However, the Abelian exchange phase and hence the topological spin can differ from system to system. For vortices in topological superconductors, the Abelian exchange phase is interpreted as an Aharonov-Casher phase arising from a vortex encircling a $e/4$ charge. In this work, we show how this fractional charge, and hence the topological spin, can be manipulated through the control of device geometry, introducing an additional control knob for topological quantum computing. To probe this effect, we propose a vortex interference experiment that reveals the presence of this fractional charge through shifts in the critical current.

Title: Dynamic correlations of frustrated quantum spins from high-temperature expansion
Authors: Ruben Burkard, Benedikt Schneider, Björn Sbierski
Abstract: For quantum spin systems in equilibrium, the dynamic structure factor (DSF) is among the most feature-packed experimental observables. However, from a theory perspective it is often hard to simulate in an unbiased and accurate way, especially for frustrated and high-dimensional models at intermediate temperature. To address this challenge, we compute the DSF from a dynamic extension of the high-temperature expansion to frequency moments. We focus on nearest-neighbor Heisenberg models with spin-lengths S=1/2 and 1. We provide comprehensive benchmarks and consider a variety of frustrated two- and three-dimensional antiferromagnets as applications. In particular we shed new light on the anomalous intermediate temperature regime of the S=1/2 triangular lattice model and reproduce the DSF measured recently for the S=1 pyrochlore material NaCaNi2F7. An open-source numerical implementation for arbitrary lattice geometries is also provided.

Title: How target distributions shape optimal stochastic resetting
Authors: Gregorio García-Valladares, Antonio Prados, Alessandro Manacorda, Carlos A. Plata
Abstract: We investigate the search of a target with a given spatial distribution in a finite one-dimensional domain. The searcher follows Brownian dynamics and is always reset to its initial position when reaching the boundaries of the domain (boundary resetting). In addition, the searcher may be reset to its initial position from any internal point of the domain (bulk resetting). Specifically, we look for the optimal strategy for bulk resetting, i.e., the spatially dependent bulk resetting rate that minimizes the average search time. The best search strategy exhibits a second-order transition from vanishing to nonvanishing bulk resetting when varying the target distribution. The obtained mathematical criteria are further analyzed for different monoparametric families of distributions, which sheds light on the properties that control the optimal strategy for bulk resetting. Our work paves new research lines in the study of search processes, emphasizing the relevance of the target distribution for optimal search strategies, and identifies a successful framework to address these questions.

Title: Room-temperature spin-lifetime anisotropy exceeding 60 in bilayer graphene spin valves proximity coupled to WSe$_2$
Authors: Timo Bisswanger, Anne Schmidt, Frank Volmer, Christoph Stampfer, Bernd Beschoten
Abstract: A spin lifetime anisotropy between in-plane and out-of-plane spins in bilayer graphene (BLG) can be achieved by spin-orbit proximity coupling of graphene to transition metal dichalcogenides. This coupling reduces the in-plane spin lifetime due to proximity-induced spin scattering, while the out-of-plane spin lifetime remains largely unaffected. We show that at room temperature spin lifetime anisotropy exceeds 60 in a bilayer graphene lateral spin valve proximity coupled to WSe$_2$. The out-of-plane spin lifetime of about 250 ps closely matches that of a BLG reference region not in contact with WSe$_2$. In contrast, the estimated in-plane spin lifetime of less than 4 ps leads to a complete suppression of the in-plane spin signal at the ferromagnetic Co/MgO spin detector. The proximity coupling of WSe$_2$ to BLG is particularly promising, as it does not compromise the charge carrier mobility within the graphene channel.

Title: High-temperature series expansion of the dynamic Matsubara spin correlator
Authors: Ruben Burkard, Benedikt Schneider, Björn Sbierski
Abstract: The high-temperature series expansion for quantum spin models is a well-established tool to compute thermodynamic quantities and equal-time spin correlations, in particular for frustrated interactions. We extend the scope of this expansion to the dynamic Matsubara spin-spin correlator and develop an algorithm that yields exact expansion coefficients in the form of rational numbers. We focus on Heisenberg models with a single coupling constant J and spin lengths S=1/2,1. The expansion coefficients up to 12th order in J/T are precomputed on all possible $\sim 10^6$ graphs embeddable in arbitrary lattices and are provided in a repository. This enables calculation of static momentum-resolved susceptibilities for arbitrary site-pairs or wavevectors. We test our results for the antiferromagnetic S=1/2 chain and triangular lattice model. An important application that we discuss in a companion letter is the calculation of real-frequency dynamic structure factors. This is achieved by identifying the high-frequency expansion coefficients of the Matsubara correlator with frequency moments of the spectral function.

Title: Heat dissipation in marginally stable linear time-delayed Langevin systems
Authors: Xin Wang
Abstract: The thermodynamic properties of time-delayed dynamics remain largely unexplored, especially for systems that exhibit asymptotically non-stationary behavior. Here, we investigate heat dissipation in two classes of marginally stable linear time-delayed Langevin dynamics: (i) diffusive criticality, which asymptotically manifests as scaled Brownian diffusion, and (ii) oscillatory criticality, which shows oscillation with diffusive amplitude. By analytical derivations, we find fundamentally different thermodynamic signatures: the average heat dissipation rate asymptotically approaches a constant for diffusive criticality but diverges linearly with oscillations for oscillatory criticality, despite both showing linearly growing variance over time. We discuss in detail how the heat dissipation rate behaves differently as the dynamics asymptotically approaches these two criticality classes from the stable regime. We also numerically study the probability distributions of heat dissipation rates for both types of critical dynamics. Our results demonstrate that non-stationary time-delayed dynamics with similar scaling of variance can yield qualitatively distinct heat dissipation behaviors, depending on the underlying dynamical details. This work provides a concrete foundation for future investigations into thermodynamic properties of general nonlinear time-delayed systems.

Abstract: Flat phonon bands in fluorite ferroelectrics (HfO2 or ZrO2) shrink polar domains laterally to an irreducible half-unit-cell width (0.27 nm) within which the vertical arrangement of dipoles is expected to remain uniform. We report on the direct observation of nonuniform and nearly discrete vertical arrangements of dipoles in ZrO2 thin films consisting of closely spaced head-to-head (HH) and tail-to-tail (TT) charged 180 degree walls, each exhibiting a distinct bulk-like structure. These charged domain walls (CDWs) further compress the irreducibly narrow, laterally stacked domains vertically to a thickness of 1-2.75 nm, yielding in-plane domains with sub-nm2 footprints-among the smallest ever reported for any ferroelectric material. The HH and TT walls form due to their flat longitudinal optical (LO) polar bands and are electrostatically stabilized by bound-charge compensation via interstitial oxygen atoms, which act as natural structural defects at the HH walls. Moreover, these walls are predicted to be conducting and to exhibit ultralow propagation barriers, with HH walls (1.6 meV) being far more mobile than TT walls (22.3 meV), indicating strong potential for low-voltage, domain-wall-based nanoelectronics.

Title: Fabrication of microstructured devices of the unconventional superconductor CeCoIn5 for investigations of isolated grain boundaries
Authors: Sanu Mishra, Sean M. Thomas, Rod Mccabe, Eric D. Bauer, Filip Ronning
Abstract: Grain boundaries are critical for determining the functionality of polycrystalline materials. Here we present on the structural $\&$ transport properties of grain boundaries in the unconventional superconductor CeCoIn$_5$. We provide a detailed recipe for the fabrication of isolated grain boundary devices from of as-grown polycrystalline samples of CeCoIn$_5$. Electron backscattered diffraction imaging of polycrystalline CeCoIn$_5$ samples reveals an abundance of $90^\circ$ misorientation grain boundaries suggesting a preferential nucleation of CeCoIn$_5$ grains with 90$^\circ$ misorientation over a random distribution of grain orientations. Transport measurements across grain boundary devices establish coherence of superconductivity and allows us to establish a lower bound on the critical current density for the grain boundaries. Our work opens new possibilities for fabrication of quantum devices such as Josephson-junctions out of bulk unconventional superconducting materials.

Title: Detecting underlying symmetry-protected topological phases via strange correlators and edge engineering
Authors: Zhe Wang, Longye Lu, Shang-Qiang Ning, Zenan Liu, Yan-Cheng Wang, Zheng Yan, Wenan Guo
Abstract: The vast majority of symmetry-protected topological (SPT) states are difficult to detect, which often leads to their misidentification as ordinary or topologically trivial phases. In this work, we propose a general framework for detecting these hidden topological states. We distinguish the ordinary matter state from the topological phase by exploiting the boundary effects in space (via surface behaviors on engineered edge) and time (via strange correlators) according to the principle of bulk-edge correspondence. As a concrete example, we study the dimerized spin-1/2 Heisenberg model on a square lattice using quantum Monte Carlo simulations, focusing on its paramagnetic dimer phase and edge states. The dimer phase has been widely regarded as topologically trivial due to its gapped edge state on conventional edges. However, the model can also be viewed as two-dimensional antiferromagnetically (AF) coupled usual ladders, which suggests an SPT state adiabatically connected to the one-dimensional Haldane phase. We resolve this puzzle and demonstrate that the dimer phase is indeed a quasi-one-dimensional SPT state by measuring generalized strange correlators introduced in this work and by showing that the nontrivial gapless edge state on a zigzag edge is ferromagnetically ordered, resulting from effective ferromagnetic interactions between degenerate spinons liberated on each side of the cut. Furthermore, we show that the ordered edge state gives rise to an extraordinary surface critical behavior at the (2+1)-dimensional O(3) bulk critical points of the model, which contradicts theoretical predictions based on classical-quantum mapping. Overall, we establish a standard detection method for uncovering topological phases that masquerade as ordinary states of matter.

Title: Tunable multi-magnon Floquet topological edge states
Authors: Ivan Martinez-Berumen, T. Pereg-Barnea, W. A. Coish
Abstract: We show that periodically time-modulating the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) in a two-dimensional magnon insulator may induce a topological phase transition that results in the presence of robust edge modes. To this end, we study a square lattice of spins interacting via an XXZ Heisenberg model with a ferromagnetic longitudinal coupling and antiferromagnetic transverse coupling, as well as the aforementioned time-modulated DMI. The topologically protected edge states of this system are composed of coherent superpositions of single-magnon excitations and two magnon bound states. Furthermore, we show that the chirality of the edge states can be controlled by adjusting the relative phase for the drive on the DMI associated with nearest neighbors in the x and y directions.

Title: Coordinate space representation of a one-dimensional odd-parity pseudopotential
Authors: Marc Camus-Sais, Abel Rojo-Francàs, Grigori E. Astrakharchik, Bruno Juliá-Díaz
Abstract: We propose a discrete-space representation of a one-dimensional zero-range odd-parity pseudopotential. The proposed representation is validated by applying it to the analytically solvable case of two fermions in a harmonic trap and successfully recovering the exact energy spectrum and eigenfunctions. Furthermore, we use the square-well and modified Pöschl--Teller potentials as finite-range representations of the odd-parity interaction and study their convergence to the contact interaction when the range tends to zero. Finally, we perform natural orbital analysis and compute the eigenvalues of the one-body density matrix for different particle numbers, examining their dependence on the one-dimensional scattering length and identifying distinct physical regimes.

Title: Ab initio spin Hamiltonians and magnetism of Ce and Yb triangular-lattice compounds
Authors: Leonid V. Pourovskii, Rafael D. Soares, Alexander Wietek
Abstract: We calculate the crystal-field splitting, ground-state Kramers doublet and intersite exchange interactions within the ground-state doublet manifold using an ab initio Hubbard-I based approach for a representative set of Ce and Yb triangular-lattice compounds. These include the putative quantum spin liquids (QSL) RbCeO$_2$ and YbZn$_2$GaO$_5$ and the antiferromagnets KCeO$_2$ and KCeS$_2$. The calculated nearest-neighbor (NN) couplings are antiferromagnetic and exhibit noticeable anisotropy. The next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) couplings are ferromagnetic in the Ce systems and dominated by classical dipole-dipole interactions in the Yb case. Solving the resulting effective spin-1/2 models by exact diagonalization up to $N=36$ sites, we predict ordered magnetic ground states for all systems, including the two QSL candidates. We explore the phase space of an anisotropic NN + isotropic NNN triangular-lattice model finding that a significant antiferromagnetic NNN coupling is required to stabilize QSL phases, while the NN exchange anisotropy is detrimental to them. Our findings highlight a possibly important role of deviations from the perfect triangular model - like atomic disorder - in real triangular-lattice materials.

Title: Magnetic behavior of $5d^1$ Re-based double perovskite Sr$_2$ZnReO$_6$

Abstract: The subtle interplay between spin-orbit coupling, exchange interactions, and cation ordering can lead to exotic magnetic states in transition-metal ions. We report a comprehensive study of the Re-based (5$d^1$) ordered double perovskite oxide Sr$_2$ZnReO$_6$ combining synchrotron x-ray diffraction (XRD), magnetic susceptibility, muon spin relaxation ($\mu$SR) measurements, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. XRD reveals that Sr$_2$ZnReO$_6$ crystallizes in the monoclinic structure (space group $P2_1/n$) at low temperature. Magnetic susceptibility data indicate a transition below $\sim$13 K, with $M$--$H$ loops showing ferromagnetic-like hysteresis and an unusually high coercive field of 23 kOe at 2 K. Zero-field $\mu$SR measurements detect static and spatially disordered internal fields below $T_M \simeq $ 12 K, consistent with a canted antiferromagnetic ground state determined by detailed DFT and force-theorem in Hubbard-I calculations. The reduced high-temperature effective moment ($\sim0.76~\mu_B$) and very small static moment ($\lesssim 0.2~\mu_B$) derived from $\mu$SR analysis and local-field simulations indicate a decisive role of spin-orbit coupling. Through a combined experimental and computational approach we unambiguously determine the canted antiferromagnetic order in Sr$_2$ZnReO$_6$, showing that a very small ordered moment coexists with an exceptionally large coercivity. These results underscore the crucial role of spin-orbit coupling and orbital ordering, providing new insights into magnetism in 5$d^1$ double perovskites.

Title: Sharp transitions in the spectra of small Frenkel-like excitons for multi-orbital lattice systems
Authors: Man-Yat Chu, Mona Berciu
Abstract: We propose a method for calculating exciton spectra and wavefunctions for model lattice Hamiltonians, based on real-space electron-hole propagators. We verify that our results agree with those of the continuum approximation in the limit of large Wannier excitons, and propose a simple criterion to estimate the exciton size above which the continuum approximation is quantitatively accurate. We then investigate simple one- and two-dimensional multi-orbital lattice models and show that small, Frenkel-like excitons, whose size approaches the lattice constant, can display physics that disagrees with the simplest continuum descriptions (a single-valley quadratic expansion around the minimum gap) not just quantitatively, but qualitatively. Specifically, we identify sharp transitions in the character and momentum of the lowest-energy exciton, enabled by the multi-orbital nature of the lattice models.

Title: Persistent Charge and Spin Currents in a Ferromagnetic Hatano-Nelson Ring
Authors: Sourav Karmakar, Sudin Ganguly, Santanu K. Maiti
Abstract: We investigate persistent charge and spin currents in a ferromagnetic Hatano-Nelson ring with anti-Hermitian intradimer hopping, where non-reciprocal hopping generates a synthetic magnetic flux and drives a non-Hermitian Aharonov-Bohm effect. The system supports both real and imaginary persistent currents, with ferromagnetic spin splitting enabling all three spin-current components, dictated by the orientation of magnetic moments. The currents are computed using the current operator method within a biorthogonal basis. In parallel, the complex band structure is analyzed to uncover the spectral characteristics. We emphasize how the currents evolve across different topological regimes, and how they are influenced by chemical potential, ferromagnetic ordering, finite size, and disorder. Strikingly, disorder can even amplify spin currents, opening powerful new routes for manipulating spin transport in non-Hermitian systems.

Title: Shape-specific fluctuations of an active colloidal interface
Authors: Arvin Subramaniam, Tirthankar Banerjee, Rajesh Singh
Abstract: Motivated by a recently synthesizable class of active interfaces formed by linked self--propelled colloids, we investigate the dynamics and fluctuations of a phoretically (chemically) interacting active interface with roto--translational coupling. We enumerate all steady--state shapes of the interface across parameter space and identify a regime where the interface acquires a finite curvature, leading to a characteristic ''C--shaped'' topology, along with persistent self--propulsion. In this phase, the interface height fluctuations obey Family--Vicsek scaling but with novel exponents: a dynamic exponent $z_h \approx 0.5$, a roughness exponent $\alpha_h \approx 0.9$ and a super--ballistic growth exponent $\beta_h \approx 1.7$. In contrast, the orientational fluctuations of the colloidal monomers exhibit a negative roughness exponent, reflecting a surprising smoothness law, where steady--state fluctuations diminish with increasing system size. Together, these findings point towards a unique non--equilibrium universality class associated with self--propelled interfaces of non--standard shape.

Title: Superconducting Dome in Ionic Liquid Gated Homoepitaxial Strontium Titanate Thin Films
Authors: Sushant Padhye, Jin Yue, Shivasheesh Varshney, Bharat Jalan, David Goldhaber-Gordon, Evgeny Mikheev
Abstract: In this work, we patterned a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) on the surface of a SrTiO$_3$ thin film grown homoepitaxially on SrTiO$_3$ by hybrid molecular beam epitaxy (hMBE). We explored the superconducting dome in this material system by tuning electron density with ionic liquid gating. We found superconducting transitions up to 503 mK near an optimal electron density of approximately 3 $\times$ 10$^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$. This is a meaningful increase from the typical optimal transition near 350 mK in similar 2DEGs on SrTiO$_3$ single crystal substrate surfaces. Systematic tuning of 2DEG electron density revealed a consistent BCS scaling between superconducting critical temperature, coherence length, and electron mean free path. Substantial variation of transition width across the dome was described by a paraconductivity model combining Aslamazov-Larkin and Maki-Thompson contributions.

Title: Yamaji effect in models of underdoped cuprates
Authors: Jing-Yu Zhao, Shubhayu Chatterjee, Subir Sachdev, Ya-Hui Zhang
Abstract: Recent angle-dependent magnetoresistance measurements in underdoped cuprates have revealed compelling evidence for small hole pockets in the pseudogap regime, including observation of the Yamaji effect in HgBa$_2$CuO$_{4+\delta}$ (Chan et al., Nature Physics https://doi.org/10.1038/s41567-025-03032-2 (2025)). A key distinction between theories is their predicted Fermi volumes, measured as fractions of the square lattice Brillouin zone: $p/4$ per pocket for spin density wave (SDW) versus $p/8$ for fractionalized Fermi liquid (FL*), where $p$ is the hole doping. We calculate the $c$-axis magnetoresistance $\rho_{zz}(\theta, \phi)$ within the semiclassical Boltzmann formalism for both states, and using the ancilla layer model (ALM) for FL* in a single-band Hamiltonian. The results from the $\text{FL}^*$ phase show good consistency with current experimental data. Conversely, the results for the SDW phase are highly sensitive to the ordering momentum along the $z$-direction. An ordering vector of $Q = (\pi, \pi, \pi)$ yields predictions that starkly disagree with the experiment. The only possibility for agreement within the SDW scenario is to assume an ordering momentum of $Q = (\pi, \pi, 0)$. However, even in this specific case, the SDW scenario predicts a marginally smaller Yamaji angle at $\phi=0$ than the FL* theory, and a second Yamaji peak near in-plane angle $\phi = 45^\circ$, which was not observed in the experiment. In reality, the Néel ordering vector is likely uncorrelated between adjacent layers, so that there is no coherent interlayer transport of hole-pocket quasiparticles in the SDW scenario, and consequently no Yamaji effect. Our results support the FL* interpretation of Fermi arcs in the pseudogap phase, and establish Yamaji angle measurements as a discriminatory tool between theoretical models.

Title: Chiral gapped states are universally non-topological
Authors: Xiang Li, Ting-Chun Lin, Yahya Alavirad, John McGreevy
Abstract: We propose an operator generalization of the Li-Haldane conjecture regarding the entanglement Hamiltonian of a disk in a 2+1D chiral gapped groundstate. The logic applies to regions with sharp corners, from which we derive several universal properties regarding corner entanglement. These universal properties follow from a set of locally-checkable conditions on the wavefunction. We also define a quantity $(\mathfrak{c}_{\text{tot}})_{\text{min}}$ that reflects the robustness of corner entanglement contributions, and show that it provides an obstruction to a gapped boundary. One reward from our analysis is that we can construct a local gapped Hamiltonian within the same chiral gapped phase from a given wavefunction; we conjecture that it is closer to the low-energy renormalization group fixed point than the original parent Hamiltonian. Our analysis of corner entanglement reveals the emergence of a universal conformal geometry encoded in the entanglement structure of bulk regions of chiral gapped states that is not visible in topological field theory. Our formalism also gives an explanation of the modular commutator formula for the chiral central charge.

Title: Grokking in the Ising Model
Authors: Karolina Hutchison, David Yevick
Abstract: Delayed generalization, termed grokking, in a machine learning calculation occurs when the increase in test accuracy is delayed relative to the training accuracy. This paper examines grokking in the context of a dense neural network trained to classify 2D Ising model configurations into 4 equally spaced energy regions in the presence of weight decay. Partially with the aid of novel PCA-based network layer analysis techniques, the observed behavior is interpreted as a transition from a connected network to a group of sparse subnetworks in which the number of active weights in each layer decreases monotonically with depth. This architecture reduces classification errors resulting from a multiplicity of paths. The final network layers, as in a convolutional neural network, sequentially identify global features of the input classes, which enables generalization to previously unseen patterns.

Title: Average density of Bloch electrons in a homogeneous magnetic field: A second-order response
Authors: Benjamin M. Fregoso
Abstract: We compute the average density of a three-dimensional multiband crystal of arbitrary symmetry, metal or insulator, to first and second order in a weak homogeneous magnetic field. To linear order and for insulators, the density follows the well-known Streda formula, but for metals there is an extra contribution from the orbital magnetic moments at the Fermi surface. To second order the average density depends on several microscopic processes. Among these, the quantum metric tensor plays an important role by generating a pseudo-magnetic moment resulting from the rotation of the Bloch wave functions in the complex projective plane. We also discuss the implications of our results for the volume and pressure. The method we develop is explicitly gauge invariant, considers intraband and interband processes on equal footing, accommodates relaxation processes, and can be readily extended to other observables.

Title: The Plastic Origin of van der Waals material GaGeTe
Authors: Qiao Wang, Ping-An Hu
Abstract: Plastic inorganic semiconductors are promising candidates for high-performance stable flexible electronics. Germanium-based chalcogenide materials are well-known for excellent semiconducting properties, notably superior carrier mobility. However, the intrinsic half-bond nature of metavalent bonds between Ge atoms and chalcogens accounts for their inherent brittleness. Here, we report an ultra-high plasticity germanium-based chalcogenide of GaGeTe. GaGeTe single crystals can sustain a large engineering strain up to 7.5% without fracture. Through a comprehensive multi-scale investigation ranging from macroscopic characterization to atomic-resolution transmission electron microscopy, we reveal that the exceptional plasticity is due to a synergistic effect of interlayer gliding and intralayer lattice distortion. DFT calculations further elucidate the chemical origin. The existence of Ga atoms avoids the formation of brittle metavalent Ge-Te bonds. Instead, a robust honeycomb lattice formed by sp3-hybridized covalent Ga-Te, Ge-Ge, and Ga-Ge bonds preserves high bond strength under large tensile strains in simulations, thereby underpinning the macroscopic plastic behavior. This systematic study on the origin of the plasticity in GaGeTe introduces bond engineering as a potential approach for constructing plastic inorganic semiconductors.

Title: Ion Jump Motion as the Background for Muon Diffusion in Battery Materials Research Using $μ$SR
Authors: Ryosuke Kadono
Abstract: Numerical simulations of muon spin relaxation ($\mu$SR) in ion diffusion were performed using the {\sl extended} Kubo-Toyabe (KT) relaxation function $G_z^{\rm EA}(t)$ that incorporates an Edwards-Anderson type autocorrelation function for the jump motion of ions. The analysis of the generated $\mu$SR spectra using the conventional KT function $G_z^{\rm KT}(t;\Delta_{\rm KT},\nu_{\rm KT})$ (mimicking the previous analysis procedure) suggest that the anomalous peak in the fluctuation rate $\nu_{\rm KT}$ around a specific temperature $T^*$ and associated decrease of the linewidth $\Delta_{\rm KT}$ above $T^*$, often observed in the previous $\mu$SR studies on ion diffusion, originate from the sharp increase in the ion jump rate $\nu_{\rm i}$ against that of the muon $\nu_\mu$ with increasing temperature. This indicates that a more detailed reanalysis of the vintage data using $G_z^{\rm EA}(t)$ is useful for the proper evaluation of $\nu_{\rm i}$ and $\nu_\mu$. Meanwhile, it also suggests that the $\mu$SR results showing no such anomaly convey little information on ion diffusion.

Title: Entropy stabilization and effect of A-site ionic size in bilayer nickelates
Authors: Jia-Yi Lu, Jia-Xin Li, Xin-Yu Zhao, Ya-Nan Zhang, Yi-Qiang Lin, Kai-Xin Ye, Hui-Qiu Yuan, Guang-Han Cao
Abstract: The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under high pressure has sparked a surge of research into Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) nickelates. Currently, stabilizing the bilayer RP phases with smaller $A$-site ions remains a significant challenge. In this work, we have successfully synthesized medium- and high-entropy bilayer nickelates, La$_{1.2}$Pr$_{0.6}$Nd$_{0.6}$Sm$_{0.6}$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ and La$_{0.67}$Pr$_{0.67}$Nd$_{0.67}$Sm$_{0.33}$Eu$_{0.33}$Gd$_{0.33}$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$, by utilizing the concept of configuration entropy stabilization. The high-entropy nickelate exhibits the smallest unit-cell volume and the largest orthorhombic distortion reported to date. The chemical pressure induced by the smaller A-site ions significantly enhances the NiO$_6$ octahedral rotation/distortion and shortens the interlayer Ni-Ni interatomic spacing. Physical property measurements reveal bad electrical conductivity alongside a markedly elevated density-wave transition temperature. Notably, the superconducting transition temperature extrapolated from structural correlations is projected to exceed 100 K. Our work not only demonstrates entropy stabilization of bilayer nickelates, but also reveals the effect of $A$-site-ion size on the crystal structure and physical properties, opening a new pathway for developing nickelate superconductors and tuning their electronic properties.

Title: Non-invertible symmetries and mixed anomalies from conserved current construction in (3+1)D twisted $BF$ topological quantum field theories
Authors: Zhi-Feng Zhang, Yizhou Huang, Qing-Rui Wang, Peng Ye
Abstract: We develop a current-based construction of generalized symmetries in $(3+1)$D twisted $BF$ topological quantum field theories (TQFTs), focusing on intrinsically non-invertible higher-form symmetries and their mixed anomalies. Starting from the equations of motion, we extract conserved currents and exponentiate the corresponding charges to obtain topological symmetry operators. This gives a step-by-step procedure for constructing symmetry operators, fusion, and anomaly diagnostics directly from the continuum action. We focus on twisted $BF$ theories with gauge group $G=\prod_i \mathbb{Z}_{N_i}$ and an $a\wedge a\wedge b$ twist, where $a$'s and $b$ are 1-form and 2-form gauge fields, respectively. These theories realize non-Abelian $(3+1)$D TQFTs supporting Borromean-rings braiding and describe three-dimensional non-Abelian topological orders in condensed matter. For $G=(\mathbb{Z}_2)^3$, a microscopic realization is given by the $\mathbb{D}_4$ Kitaev quantum double model. Two distinct classes of conserved currents emerge: Type-I currents generate invertible higher-form symmetries with group-like fusion, while Type-II currents require additional consistency conditions on gauge-field configurations, leading to intrinsically non-invertible symmetries dressed by projectors. We compute the fusion algebra: invertible operators admit inverses, while non-invertible ones exhibit multi-channel fusion governed by projector fusion. We diagnose mixed anomalies by coupling multiple conserved currents to background gauge fields, revealing two outcomes: anomalies canceled by anomaly inflow from a higher-dimensional theory, and intrinsic gauging obstructions encoded in the $(3+1)$D continuum theory. Overall, our results provide a unified and practical approach for constructing and characterizing higher-form symmetries, which can be extended to more general TQFTs and topological orders.

Title: Klein tunneling in quantum geometric semimetals
Authors: Sang-Hoon Han, Jun-Won Rhim, Chang-geun Oh
Abstract: Klein tunneling stands as a fundamental probe of relativistic quantum transport in two-dimensional materials. We investigate this phenomenon in quadratic band-touching systems, where the Hilbert-Schmidt quantum distance plays a central role in the underlying mechanism. By employing a generic parabolic model, we systematically disentangle the cooperative effects of intrinsic mass asymmetry and tunable quantum geometry. We demonstrate that mass asymmetry sets the overall transmission profile, including the angular distribution and the resonance channels. In contrast, we show that quantum geometry provides a universal parameter that modulates tunneling efficiency by tuning the quantum distance, while leaving the energy dispersion unchanged. Specifically, quantum geometry plays a dual role: it governs the overall transmission amplitude through pseudospin mismatch, while its interplay with Fabry-Perot interference induces observable shifts in resonance angles. Our findings reveal that incorporating quantum geometry alongside band structure is essential for a complete description of quantum transport.

Title: Topological hybridisation of plasmons with ferrimagnetic magnons
Authors: Cooper Finnigan, Mehdi Kargarian, Dmitry K. Efimkin
Abstract: We study the formation of hybrid plasmon-magnon modes in a heterostructure comprising a monolayer semiconductor with strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling -- specifically, Janus transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) -- and an insulating ferrimagnet, such as yttrium iron garnet-based compounds. Using a combined microscopic-macroscopic framework for plasmon-magnon coupling, we show that plasmons and magnons strongly hybridize over both GHz and THz frequency ranges, enabling experimental access well above cryogenic temperatures. Moreover, the developed approach provides an efficient and natural classification of the topology of the hybrid modes, rooted in the phase winding of the plasmon-magnon coupling induced by spin-momentum locking and the associated chiral winding of the electronic spin along the Fermi contours. Finally, we identify experimentally accessible manifestations of the hybridization, such as topological interface modes and an anomalous thermal Hall response.

Title: Realization of a Wigner-Mott insulator in 6R-TaS$_2$ superconductor
Authors: Hongqin Xiao, Geng Li, Yuxuan He, Ke Zhu, Yuhan Ye, Yumeng Li, Lijing Huang, Pucen Xiong, Haitao Yang, Ziqiang Wang, Hong-Jun Gao
Abstract: Wigner-Mott insulating states represent a paradigmatic manifestation of strong electronic correlations, in which long-range Coulomb interactions drive spontaneous charge ordering and enable Mott localization at fractional electronic fillings. Such states have been theoretically proposed to arise from the cooperative interplay between onsite and inter-site Coulomb interactions. However, experimental realizations of the simultaneous microscopic observation of interaction-driven charge order and genuine Mott localization, which are the defining hallmarks of a Wigner-Mott insulator, have remained elusive. Here we report the observation of a Wigner-Mott insulating state in 6R-TaS$_2$ using scanning tunneling microscopy. By locally injecting electrons into the depleted 1T layer, we induce distinct Star-of-David charge-ordered superstructures and realize a cascade of insulating phases. In particular, a $\sqrt{3}\times \sqrt{3}$ charge-ordered superstructure at one-third filling hosts a robust Mott gap despite fractional filling. The spontaneous relaxation from excited states back to the ground state demonstrates that this Wigner-Mott phase is stabilized by the cooperative effects of onsite and inter-site Coulomb interactions. Our results provide direct microscopic evidence for a Wigner-Mott mechanism and establish 6R-TaS$_2$ as a platform for the controlled realization and investigation of Wigner-Mott insulating states.

Title: Tuning the strength of emergent correlations in a Brownian gas via batch resetting
Authors: Gabriele de Mauro, Satya N. Majumdar, Gregory Schehr
Abstract: We study a gas of $N$ diffusing particles on the line subject to batch resetting: at rate $r$, a uniformly random subset of $m$ particles is reset to the origin. Despite the absence of interactions, the dynamics generates a nonequilibrium stationary state (NESS) with long-range correlations. We obtain exact results, both for the NESS and for the time dependence of the correlations, which are valid for arbitrary $m$ and $N$. By varying $m$, the system interpolates between an uncorrelated regime ($m=1$) and the fully synchronous resetting case ($m=N$). For all $1<m<N$, correlations exhibit a non-monotonic time dependence due to the emergence of an intrinsic decorrelation mechanism. In the stationary state, the correlation strength can be tuned by varying $m$, and it displays a transition at a critical value $N_c=6$. Our predictions extend straightforwardly to any spatial dimension $d$ and the critical value $N_c=6$ remains the same in all dimensions. Our predictions are testable in existing experimental setups on optically trapped colloidal particles.

Title: Entanglement Hamiltonians in dissipative free fermions and the time-dependent GGE
Authors: Riccardo Travaglino, Federico Rottoli, Pasquale Calabrese
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of Entanglement Hamiltonians (EHs) in dissipative free-fermionic systems using a recent operator-based formulation of the quasiparticle picture. Focusing on gain and loss dissipation, we study the post-quench evolution and derive explicit expressions for the EH at the ballistic scale. In the long-time and weak-dissipation regime, the EH is shown to take the form of a time-dependent Generalized Gibbs Ensemble (t-GGE), with a structure that is universal across different initial states of the quench protocol. Within this framework, the emergence of the t-GGE is fully accounted for by the quasiparticle picture, and we argue that this description remains valid whenever the Lindbladian admits an appropriate coarse-grained representation.

Title: Electromagnetic Response of a Half-Filled Chern Band near Topological Criticality
Authors: Xinlei Yue, Fabian Pichler, Michael Knap, Ady Stern
Abstract: We evaluate electromagnetic-response observables in a half-filled Chern band, across a topological phase transition between a composite Fermi liquid (CFL) and a Fermi liquid (FL) phase. While a sharp gapped plasma mode exists deep in the CFL phase, we demonstrate that it is damped near the proposed continuous phase transition between CFL and FL. This plasmon-damping phenomenon originates from emergent gauge fields and a Dirac-fermion-like spectrum. Similar features also occur in other continuous deconfined topological phase transitions, such as the Laughlin to superfluid transition in a bosonic system. In particular, this damping behavior extends over a finite range across the phase boundary, and, hence, we expect it to persist even when the transition is weakly first-order. Furthermore, we analyze the behavior of the Drude weight, the wavevector-dependent conductivity, and the chiral mirror effect across these topological phase transitions.

Title: Dynamics of string breaking and revival in a Rydberg atomic chain
Authors: Xin Liu, Han-Chao Chen, Zheng-Yuan Zhang, Jun Zhang, Ya-Jun Wang, Qing Li, Shi-Yao Shao, Bang Liu, Li-Hua Zhang, Dong-Sheng Ding, Bao-Sen Shi
Abstract: String breaking is one of the most representative non-perturbative dynamics processes in confinement theory, typically associated with the creation of particle-antiparticle pairs. In this paper, we take a one-dimensional Rydberg atomic chain to theoretically study the dynamical of finite-length string state. Under different string tension conditions, we find that the string dynamics exhibits two clearly distinguishable evolution characteristics: one is that the string breaks and the system enters a superposition state space containing multiple meson state configurations; the other is localized string dynamics, in which the string undergoes local breaking but can then recombine and return to a state close to the initial structure, with the breaking and recombination processes recurring over a long time scale. Through the analysis of the evolution of different meson state configurations, we visually depict the redistribution of configuration weights during the string breaking process, and reveal the observable recovery characteristics of the string after breaking. Further analysis shows that the enhancement of quantum fluctuations can increase the weight of the double-meson state configurations in the system wave function without changing the dominant dynamical behavior. The above results present a rich picture of string breaking dynamics in a one-dimensional Rydberg atomic chain and provide insights for studying confinement physics and related gauge field theory phenomena on quantum simulation platforms.

Title: Electronic States, Spin-Orbit Coupling and Magnetism in Germanium 60° Dislocations
Authors: Veronica Regazzoni, Fabrizio Rovaris, Anna Marzegalli, Francesco Montalenti, Emilio Scalise
Abstract: Defects in semiconductors have recently attracted renewed interest owing to their potential in novel quantum applications. Here we investigate the electronic and magnetic properties induced by 60° dislocations in Ge. Using large-scale DFT calculations, we determine the band structure for both the shuffle and glide sets in their lowest-energy configurations. We also perform charged-defect calculations to aid in the interpretation of complex photoluminescence spectra observed in epitaxial Ge layers. The band structure for the shuffle set reveals defect-induced dispersive bands localized within the band gap near the {\Gamma} point, whereas for the glide set, we observe strong overlap with the conduction band. Defect-induced band splitting evident away from {\Gamma} reveals Rashba-Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling, an effect previously reported only for screw dislocations. Remarkably, we find evidence that specific dislocation arrangements can stabilize antiferromagnetic ordering with sizable local magnetic moments and considerable exchange splitting between opposite spin states. These results uncover rich physics in Ge dislocations through the combination of spin-orbit coupling and magnetic ordering, potentially enabling novel defect-based functionalities in Ge devices.

Abstract: We propose a renormalization group flow with emergent supersymmetry in two dimensions from a non-Lagrangian theory. The ultraviolet theory does not have supersymmetry while the infrared theory does. We constrain the flow both analytically and numerically (truncated conformal space approach). Analytic constraints include a new spin constraint.

Title: Flux-pump induced degradation of $T_1$ for dissipative cat qubits
Authors: Léon Carde, Pierre Rouchon, Joachim Cohen, Alexandru Petrescu
Abstract: Dissipative stabilization of cat qubits autonomously corrects for bit flip errors by ensuring that reservoir-engineered two-photon losses dominate over other mechanisms inducing phase flip errors. To describe the latter, we derive an effective master equation for an asymmetrically threaded SQUID based superconducting circuit used to stabilize a dissipative cat qubit. We analyze the dressing of relaxation processes under drives in time-dependent Schrieffer-Wolff perturbation theory for weakly anharmonic bosonic degrees of freedom, and in numerically exact Floquet theory. We find that spurious single-photon decay rates can increase under the action of the parametric pump that generates the required interactions for cat-qubit stabilization. Our analysis feeds into mitigation strategies that can inform current experiments, and the methods presented here can be extended to other circuit implementations.

Title: Many-body and QED effects in electron-atom inelastic scattering in EELS
Authors: Ioannis Iatrakis, Valerii Brudanin
Abstract: The elemental composition and electronic structure of materials analyzed by electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) are probed by the inner-shell ionization of atoms. This is a localized process that can be approximated by the scattering of an electron beam from a free atom. We calculate the inelastic differential cross section perturbatively within the framework of quantum electrodynamics (QED). The interaction between the incoming electron and the atom factorizes into a high-energy electron term and the atomic transition current. The matrix elements of the transition current are computed within the relaxed Dirac Hartree Fock method. We analyze the correlation effects arising from the relaxation of the atomic orbitals induced by the creation of a core hole. These effects are particularly relevant in quantum many-body systems and have a significant impact on the shape of the differential cross section near the ionization threshold in EELS spectra. In addition to the continuum, we calculate the discrete excitation spectrum of $\mathrm{DyScO_3}$ using crystal-field multiplet theory. The calculated spectrum shows very good agreement with experimental EELS data.

Title: Exponential quantum speedups for near-term molecular electronic structure methods
Authors: Oskar Leimkuhler, K. Birgitta Whaley
Abstract: We prove classical simulation hardness, under the generalized $\mathsf{P}\neq\mathsf{NP}$ conjecture, for quantum circuit families with applications in near-term chemical ground state estimation. The proof exploits a connection to particle number conserving matchgate circuits with fermionic magic state inputs, which are shown to be universal for quantum computation under post-selection, and are therefore not classically simulable in the worst case, in either the strong (multiplicative) or weak (sampling) sense. We apply this result to quantum non-orthogonal multi-reference methods designed for near-term hardware by ruling out certain dequantization strategies for computing the off-diagonal matrix elements between reference states. We demonstrate these quantum speedups for two choices of ansatz that incorporate both static and dynamic correlations to model the electronic eigenstates of molecular systems: linear combinations of orbital-rotated matrix product states, which are preparable in linear depth, and linear combinations of states prepared by generalized UCCSD circuits of polynomial depth, for which computing the expectation values of local fermionic observables up to a constant additive error is $\mathsf{BQP}$-complete. We discuss the implications for achieving practical quantum advantage in resolving the electronic structure of catalytic systems composed from multivalent transition metal atoms using near-term quantum hardware.

Title: Recovery dynamics of a gap-engineered transmon after a quasiparticle burst
Authors: Heekun Nho, Thomas Connolly, Pavel D. Kurilovich, Spencer Diamond, Charlotte G. L. Bøttcher, Leonid I. Glazman, Michel H. Devoret
Abstract: Ionizing radiation impacts create bursts of quasiparticle density in superconducting qubits. These bursts temporarily degrade qubit coherence which can be detrimental for quantum error correction. Here, we experimentally resolve quasiparticle bursts in 3D gap-engineered transmon qubits by continuously monitoring qubit transitions. Gap engineering allows us to reduce the burst detection rate by a factor of five. This reduction falls four orders of magnitude short of that expected if the quasiparticles were to quickly thermalize to the cryostat temperature. We associate the limited effect of gap engineering with the slow thermalization of the phonons in our chips after the burst.

Title: Universality of noise-induced transitions in nonlinear voter models
Authors: Jaume Llabrés, Maxi San Miguel, Raúl Toral
Abstract: We analyze the universality classes of phase transitions in a variety of nonlinear voter models. By mapping several models with symmetric absorbing states onto a canonical model introduced in previous studies, we confirm that they exhibit a Generalized Voter (GV) transition. We then propose a canonical mean-field model that extends the original formulation by incorporating a noise term that eliminates the absorbing states. This generalization gives rise to a phase diagram featuring two distinct types of phase transitions: a continuous Ising transition and a discontinuous transition we call Modified Generalized Voter (MGV). These two transition lines converge at a tricritical point. We map diverse noisy nonlinear voter models onto this extended canonical form. Using finite-size scaling techniques above and below the upper critical dimension, we show that the continuous transition of these models belongs to the Ising universality class in their respective dimensionality. We also find universal behavior at the tricitical point. Our results provide a unifying framework for classifying phase transitions in stochastic models of opinion dynamics with both nonlinearity and noise.

Title: Dissipative phase transition of interacting non-reciprocal fermions
Authors: Rafael D. Soares, Matteo Brunelli, Marco Schirò
Abstract: While non-reciprocal couplings are ubiquitous in classical systems, their impact on quantum many-body criticality and entanglement remains largely unexplored. Using exact numerical simulations, we study an interacting fermionic chain subject to non-reciprocal gain and loss. We show that the interplay between dissipation and interactions drives a dissipative phase transition, marked by the opening of a many-body gap and a crossover from power-law to exponential relaxation. The weakly-interacting regime displays non-reciprocal signatures, including nonzero currents and directional charge accumulation reminiscent of the skin effect. Notably, despite this localization, quantum trajectories exhibit volume-law entanglement. Finally, reciprocity is dynamically restored above a critical interaction strength.

Title: Replacement-Type Quantum Gates
Authors: Florian Ginzel, Javad Kazemi, Valentin Torggler, Wolfgang Lechner
Abstract: We introduce the paradigm of replacement-type quantum gates. This type of gate introduces input qubits, candidate qubits, and output qubits. The candidate qubits are prepared such, that a displacement conditional on the input qubit results in the targeted output state. Finally, the circuit continues with the output qubits constructed from the candidate qubits instead of the input qubits, thus the name "replacement-type gate". We present examples of replacement-type $X$ and $\mathrm{CNOT}$ gates realized with spin qubits and with neutral atom qubits with error rates predicted near the threshold of the XZZX surface code. By making use of the extended Hilbert space, including the position of the particles, these gates approximately preserve the innate noise bias of the qubits. The gate preserves the noise bias which motivates advanced quantum computer architectures with quantum error correction.

Title: Continuous invariant-based asymmetries of periodic crystals quantify deviations from higher symmetry
Authors: Surya Majumder, Daniel Widdowson, Yury Elkin, Olga Anosova, Andrew I Cooper, Graeme M Day, Vitaliy Kurlin
Abstract: Ideal symmetry is known to break down under almost any noise. One measure of asymmetry in a periodic crystal is the relative multiplicity Z' of geometrically non-equivalent units. However, Z' discontinuously changes under almost any displacement of atoms, which can arbitrarily scale up a primitive cell. This discontinuity was recently resolved by a hierarchy of invariant descriptors that continuously change under all small perturbations. We introduce a Continuous Invariant-based Asymmetry (CIA) to quantify (in physically meaningful Angstroms) the deviation of a periodic crystal from a higher symmetry form. Our experiments on several Crystal Structure Prediction datasets show that about a half of simulated crystals have high values of CIA, while all experimental structures in these datasets have CIA=0. On another hand, many crystals with high values Z' in the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) turned out to be close to more symmetric forms with Z'<=1 due to low values of CIAs.

Title: Modified Langevin noise formalism for multiple quantum emitters in dispersive electromagnetic environments out of equilibrium
Authors: Giovanni Miano, Loris Maria Cangemi, Carlo Forestiere
Abstract: The control of interactions among quantum emitters through nanophotonic structures offers significant opportunities for quantum technologies. However, a rigorous theoretical description of the interaction of multiple quantum emitters with complex, dispersive dielectric objects remains challenging. Here, we introduce an approach based on the modified Langevin noise formalism that unveils the roles of both the noise polarization currents of the dielectrics and the vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field scattered by the dielectrics. This work extends Refs. \cite{miano_quantum_2025} and \cite{miano_spectral_2025} to the general case of an arbitrary number of emitters. The proposed approach allows us to describe the dynamics of the quantum emitters for arbitrary initial quantum states of the electromagnetic environment, consisting of two independent bosonic reservoirs, a medium-assisted reservoir and a scattering-assisted reservoir, each characterized by its own spectral density matrix. Specifically, we examine situations where both reservoirs are initially in thermal quantum states but have different temperatures. Understanding how these reservoirs shape the dynamics of the emitters is crucial for understanding light-matter interactions in complex electromagnetic environments and for improving intrinsic emitter properties within structured environments.

Title: Granite sliding on granite: friction, wear rates, surface topography, and the scale-dependence of rate-state effects
Authors: Sergey V. Sukhomlinov, Martin H. Müser, B.N.J. Persson
Abstract: We study tribological granite-granite contacts as a model for tectonic faulting, combining experiments, theory, and molecular dynamics simulations. The high friction in this system is not dominated by particulate wear or plowing, as frequently assumed, but by cold welding within plastically deformed asperity junctions. We base this conclusion on the observation that wear is repeatedly high after cleaning contacts but decreases as gouge accumulates, while friction shows the opposite trend. Moreover, adding water reduces wear by a factor of ten but barely decreases friction. Thermal and rate-dependent effects-central to most earthquake models-are negligible: friction remains unchanged between -40°C and 20°C, across abrupt velocity steps, and after hours of stationary contact. The absence of rate-state effects in our macroscopic samples is rationalized by the scale-dependence of pre-slip. The evolution of surface topography shows that quartz grains become locally smooth, with height spectra isotropic for wavelength below 10 microns but anisotropic at longer wavelengths, similar to natural faults. The resulting gouge particles have the usual characteristic sizes near 100 nm. Molecular dynamics simulations of a rigid, amorphous silica tip sliding on {\alpha}-quartz reproduce not only similar friction coefficients near unity but also other experimentally observed features, including stress-introduced transitions to phases observed in post-mortem faults, as well as theoretical estimates of local flash temperatures. Additionally, they reveal a marked decrease of interfacial shear strength above 600°C.

Title: Diagonal boundary conditions in critical loop models
Authors: Max Downing, Jesper Lykke Jacobsen, Rongvoram Nivesvivat, Sylvain Ribault, Hubert Saleur
Abstract: In critical loop models, we define diagonal boundaries as boundaries that couple to diagonal fields only. Using analytic bootstrap methods, we show that diagonal boundaries are characterised by one complex parameter, analogous to the boundary cosmological constant in Liouville theory. We determine disc 1-point functions, and write an explicit formula for disc 2-point functions as infinite combinations of conformal blocks. For a discrete subset of values of the boundary parameter, the boundary spectrum becomes discrete, and made of degenerate representations. In such cases, we check our results by numerically bootstrapping disc 2-point functions. We sketch the interpretation of diagonal boundaries in lattice loop models. In particular, a loop can neither end on a diagonal boundary, nor change weight when it touches it. In bulk-to-boundary OPEs, numbers of legs can be conserved, or increase by even numbers.

Title: Single-site dissipation stabilizes a superconducting nonequilibrium steady state in a strongly correlated system
Authors: X. Z. Zhang
Abstract: Can superconducting order be engineered as a robust attractor of open-system dynamics in strongly correlated systems? We demonstrate this possibility by proposing a minimal dissipation-engineering protocol for the particle-hole symmetric Hubbard model. By applying a rotated quantum jump operator, specifically a locally transformed $\eta$-pair lowering operator, on a single lattice site only, we show that the Lindblad evolution autonomously pumps the system from the vacuum into a nonequilibrium steady state (NESS) exhibiting macroscopic $\eta$-pair off-diagonal long-range order (ODLRO). Crucially, this local-to-global synchronization stands in stark contrast to schemes reliant on spatially extensive reservoirs: here, a single local dissipative seed suffices to establish long-range coherence across the entire interacting lattice system. We elucidate the underlying mechanism via three core features: local dark-state selection, the controlled elimination of off-manifold excursions induced by hopping, and a Liouvillian invariant-subspace structure that yields an attractive fixed point with a finite dissipative gap. Furthermore, we systematically classify the stability of this NESS with respect to static disorder, and identify a wide regime in which the superconducting attractor remains robust against Hamiltonian perturbations that preserve the effective subspace structure. We also pinpoint specific perturbations that directly cause dephasing of the $% \eta$-pseudospin coherence and suppress ODLRO. These findings open up a disorder-tolerant pathway for stabilizing superconducting order as a non-thermal attractor through minimal local quantum-jump control.

Title: Simultaneous measurement of Raman and nonlinear optical tensors
Authors: Volodymyr Multian, Luigi Bonacina, Jérémie Teyssier
Abstract: Raman spectroscopy and Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) are complementary, non-destructive techniques that provide rich and distinct insights into the structural and electronic properties of materials. Raman spectroscopy offers detailed information on vibrational modes, phase transitions, temperature, and local stress, while SHG is highly sensitive to symmetry and orientation, particularly in non-centrosymmetric structures. In this work, in addition to combining both techniques, we propose a novel approach to determine the nonlinear optical tensor, leveraging the spatial and ultra-fast temporal offset of a Bessel-Gaussian laser beam at the microscope's focal point.
