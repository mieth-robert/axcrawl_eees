Title: Approximate Approach to Compute Characteristics of Inhomogeneous TASEP with Open Boundaries
Authors: Marina V. Yashina, Alexander G. Tatashev
Abstract: A discrete-time totally asymmetric simple exclusion process on a lattice with open boundaries is considered. There are particles of different types. The type of a particle is characterized by the probability that a particle moves to a vacant site and the probability that a particle occupying the rightmost site departs the system. An approximate approach to compute the particle flow rate and density in sites is proposed. A version of the approach is proposed for an analogous continuous-time process. The accuracy of the approximation is estimated. The approach can be used in traffic models and models of statistical physics.

Title: Generating Arrow of Time from Three-Particle System with Classical Mechanics
Authors: Shuhei Kobayashi
Abstract: This study investigates the mechanical origin of the arrow of time by analyzing a one-dimensional three-particle system with elastic collisions. By mapping the system to a contact between finite heat baths through a thermal wall, we show that the energy exchange follows an exponential relaxation law, even though the underlying equations of motion are time-reversal symmetric. The loss of time-reversal symmetry emerges from the coarse-graining of dynamical variables, specifically the omission of velocity signs in energy representation. This result suggests that the arrow of time originates from information reduction in the transition from microscopic to macroscopic descriptions.

Title: Chimeric states of matter: Meissner effect without superconductivity
Authors: Michael J Landry, Mingda Li
Abstract: Symmetry is central to how we classify phases of matter: solids break spatial translations, superfluids break particle-number conservation, and superconductors "break" gauge symmetry. Mixed anomalies involving higher-form symmetries, however, present a generalization of spontaneous symmetry breaking that admits a wider and more versatile set of possibilities. We introduce chimeric states of matter, in which aspects of broken and unbroken phases coexist. We find that the Meissner effect -- usually regarded as the defining hallmark of superconductivity -- can occur in media that are resistive or even insulating when probed by electric fields. We demonstrate this by constructing an effective field theory of "symmetry chimerization" and propose that Josephson junction networks could provide a laboratory realization. These results broaden the landscape of possible phases of matter, showing that physical media can mix features of symmetry-restored and symmetry-broken states in a single substrate.

Title: The hybrid exact scheme for the simulation of first-passage times of jump-diffusions with time-dependent thresholds
Authors: Sascha Desmettre, Devika Khurana, Amira Meddah
Abstract: The first-passage time is a key concept in stochastic modeling, representing the time at which a process first reaches a specified threshold. In this work, we consider a jump-diffusion (JD) model with a time-dependent threshold, providing a more flexible framework for describing stochastic dynamics. We are interested in the Exact simulation method developed for JD processes with constant thresholds, where the Exact method for pure diffusion is applied between jump intervals. An adaptation of this method to time-dependent thresholds has recently been proposed for a more general stochastic setting. We show that this adaptation can be applied to JD models by establishing a formal correspondence between the two frameworks. A comparative analysis is then performed between the proposed approach and the constant-threshold version in terms of algorithmic structure and computational efficiency. Finally, we show the applicability of the method by predicting neuronal spike times in a JD model driven by two independent Poisson jump mechanisms.

Title: Visualizing interaction-driven restructuring of quantum Hall edge states
Authors: Jiachen Yu, Haotan Han, Kristina G. Wolinski, Ruihua Fan, Amir S. Mohammadi, Tianle Wang, Taige Wang, Liam Cohen, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Andrea F. Young, Michael P. Zaletel, Ali Yazdani
Abstract: Many topological phases host gapless boundary modes that can be dramatically modified by electronic interactions. Even for the long-studied edge modes of quantum Hall phases, forming at the boundaries of two-dimensional (2D) electron systems, the nature of such interaction-induced changes has been elusive. Despite advances made using local probes, key experimental challenges persist: the lack of direct information about the internal structure of edge states on microscopic scales, and complications from edge disorder. Here, we use scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) to image pristine electrostatically defined quantum Hall edge states in graphene with high spatial resolution and demonstrate how correlations dictate the structures of edge channels on both magnetic and atomic length scales. For integer quantum Hall states in the zeroth Landau level, we show that interactions renormalize the edge velocity, dictate the spatial profile for copropagating modes, and induce unexpected edge valley polarization that differ from those of the bulk. While some of our findings can be understood by mean-field theory, others show breakdown of this picture, highlighting the roles of edge fluctuations and inter-channel couplings. We also extend our measurements to spatially resolve the edge state of fractional quantum Hall phases and detect spectroscopic signatures of interactions in this chiral Luttinger liquid. Our study establishes STM as a promising tool for exploring edge physics of the rapidly expanding 2D topological phases, including newly realized fractional Chern insulators.

Title: Constructing a bifunctional platform based on Mn2+-doped Mg2Y8(SiO4)6O2 phosphors for multi-parameter optical thermometry and manometry
Authors: Zhiyu Pei, Shuailing Ma, Maja Szymczak, Lukasz Marciniak, Tian Cui, Laihui Luo, Peng Du
Abstract: Series of the Mn2+-doped Mg2Y8(SiO4)6O2 phosphors were synthesized. Upon excitation at 408 nm, these phosphors exhibited intense orange emission originating from Mn2+, with concentration quenching observed beyond x = 0.07, and they also demonstrated excellent thermal stability. For optical thermometry, two independent parameters, emission band centroid ({\lambda}) and lifetime, were employed as thermal indicators, yielding sensitivities of d{\lambda}/dT = 0.053 nm K-1 and SR = 0.86% K-1, respectively. High-pressure in-situ X-ray diffraction revealed that the phosphors retained structural integrity under compression, accompanied by a progressive lattice contraction. With increasing pressure (0.13-10.89 GPa), a spectral red-shift was observed, corresponding to a pressure sensitivity of d{\lambda}/dp = 4.75 nm GPa-1. Additionally, pressure-dependent shifts in color coordinates allowed the development of a colorimetric manometric response, achieving a relative sensitivity of 3.27% GPa-1. Remarkably, the pressure-induced spectral shift of Mn2+ emission, characterized by low thermal cross-sensitivity, enabled a highly reliable ratiometric manometric strategy, with a relative sensitivity of 72% GPa-1. Notably, the system delivered the highest TIMF reported to date above 3 GPa, peaking at 1940 K GPa-1 at 7 GPa. These results position Mn2+-doped Mg2Y8(SiO4)6O2 phosphors as a highly promising bifunctional material for next-generation, multi-parameter optical sensing applications under extreme conditions.

Title: Transfer learning discovery of molecular modulators for perovskite solar cells
Authors: Haoming Yan, Xinyu Chen, Yanran Wang, Zhengchao Luo, Weizheng Huang, Hongshuai Wang, Peng Chen, Yuzhi Zhang, Weijie Sun, Jinzhuo Wang, Qihuang Gong, Rui Zhu, Lichen Zhao
Abstract: The discovery of effective molecular modulators is essential for advancing perovskite solar cells (PSCs), but the research process is hindered by the vastness of chemical space and the time-consuming and expensive trial-and-error experimental screening. Concurrently, machine learning (ML) offers significant potential for accelerating materials discovery. However, applying ML to PSCs remains a major challenge due to data scarcity and limitations of traditional quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) models. Here, we apply a chemical informed transfer learning framework based on pre-trained deep neural networks, which achieves high accuracy in predicting the molecular modulator's effect on the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs. This framework is established through systematical benchmarking of diverse molecular representations, enabling lowcost and high-throughput virtual screening over 79,043 commercially available molecules. Furthermore, we leverage interpretability techniques to visualize the learned chemical representation and experimentally characterize the resulting modulator-perovskite interactions. The top molecular modulators identified by the framework are subsequently validated experimentally, delivering a remarkably improved champion PCE of 26.91% in PSCs.

Title: Interface-mediated softening and deformation mechanics in amorphous/ amorphous nanolaminates
Authors: Vivek Devulapalli, Fedor F. Klimashin, Manuel Bärtschi, Stephan Waldner, Silvia Schwyn Thöny, Johann Michler, Xavier Maeder
Abstract: Interfaces govern the unique mechanical response of amorphous multilayers. Here, we examine nanoindentation hardness and deformation behaviour of amorphous-amorphous Ta$_2$O$_5$/SiO$_2$ nanolaminates with bilayer thicknesses ranging from 2 nm to 334 nm. Whilst monolithic SiO$_2$ exhibits catastrophic failure through a single dominant shear band, multilayer architectures demonstrate varied deformation mechanisms. Hardness decreases with reduced bilayer thickness, from 7.7 GPa at 334 nm to 5.5 GPa at 2 nm spacing, contrasting with crystalline systems, which strengthen with decreasing spacing. Cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy reveals that fine bilayer spacings promote closely spaced vertical shear bands with bilayer compression, while coarser spacings show fewer, widely spaced shear bands with chemical intermixing. Scanning electron diffraction mapping demonstrates significant densification beneath indents. The high interface density facilitates strain accommodation that prevents catastrophic failure typical of brittle amorphous materials.

Title: Dragging of electric current by hydrodynamic flow at charge neutrality
Authors: Dmitry Zverevich, Alex Levchenko, A. V. Andreev
Abstract: We develop a theory of drag in graphene double layers near charge neutrality. We work in the regime of electron hydrodynamics and account for interlayer correlations of charge puddle disorder. The drag resistivity is expressed in terms of the viscosity, intrinsic conductivity of the electron liquid, and the correlation function of the puddle disorder. The contributions of the interlayer transfer of momentum and energy to drag have opposite signs. This leads to a nonmonotonic dependence of the drag resistivity on the carrier density. For layer-symmetric doping, the drag resistivity changes sign as a function of the carrier density. At interlayer separations shorter than the disorder correlation length, the transconductivity saturates to the disorder-induced enhancement of the intralayer conductivity. We provide quantitative estimates of the effect for Dirac electron liquids in monolayer graphene and bilayer graphene double-layer devices.

Title: Emergent clusters in strongly confined systems
Authors: Pamud Akalanka Bethmage, Ryker Fish, Brennan Sprinkle, Michelle Driscoll
Abstract: Driven suspensions, where energy is input at a particle scale, are a framework for understanding general principles of out-of-equilibrium organization. A large number of simple interacting units can give rise to non-trivial structure and hierarchy. Rotationally driven colloidal particles are a particularly nice model system for exploring this pattern formation, as the dominant interaction between the particles is hydrodynamic. Here, we use experiments and large-scale simulations to explore how strong confinement alters dynamics and emergent structure at the particle scale in these driven suspensions. Surprisingly, we find that large-scale (many times the particle size) density fluctuations emerge as a result of confinement, and that these density fluctuations sensitively depend on the degree of confinement. We extract a characteristic length scale for these fluctuations, demonstrating that the simulations quantitatively reproduce the experimental pattern. Moreover, we show that these density fluctuations are a result of the large-scale recirculating flow generated by the rotating particles inside a sealed chamber. This surprising result shows that even when system boundaries are far away, they can cause qualitative changes to mesoscale structure and ordering.

Title: I. Magnetic, thermal and transport properties of YbCu$_{5-x}$Zn$_x$ alloys
Authors: I. Čurlik, F. Akbar, S. Gabani, M. Giovannini, J. G. Sereni
Abstract: Within the family of cubic YbCu$_4$X compounds ($X$ = Ni, Au and Zn), we have investigated the YbCu$_{5-x}$Zn$_x$ ($1\geq x \geq 0.7$) alloys by means of structural, magnetic, thermal and transport measurements. In the $\tau 1-$ YbCu$_{5-x}$Zn$_x$ (cubic AuBe$_5$ type, $0.7 \leq x \leq 1.5$) structural phase, Yb ion is in its Yb$^{3+}$ magnetic configuration. However, by increasing Zn content the unit cell grows faster than a reference computed as a Cu by Zn atoms substitution, which indicates a shift of Yb ions towards the larger Yb$^{2+}$ configuration. The magnetic behavior confirms such tendency with a clear decrease of the saturation magnetization and effective moment between $x=0.7$ and $x=1$. The specific heat at low temperature shows a logarithmic dependence characteristic for a non-fermi-liquid behavior. The characteristic energies of all studied parameters, including magneto resistivity, show notably low values as an indication that these alloys are close to a quantum critical point, which is approached from the non-magnetic side as the Zn content decreases.

Title: Ambient-Induced Selenium Segregation and Nanoparticle Formation in 2H-HfSe2: An Experimental and Theoretical Study
Authors: Stefany P. Carvalho, Guilherme S. L. Fabris, Ana Carolina F. de Brito, Raphael B. de Oliveira, Wesley Kardex C. de Oliveira, Catalina Ruano-Merchan, Carlos A. R. Costa, Luiz F. Zagonel, Douglas Galvao, Ingrid D. Barcelos
Abstract: We investigate the air-induced degradation of few-layer hafnium diselenide (HfSe$_2$) through combined experimental and theoretical approaches. AFM and SEM reveal the formation of selenium-rich spherical features upon ambient exposure, while EDS confirms Se segregation. \textit{Ab initio} molecular dynamics simulations show that Se atoms migrate to flake edges and that O/O$_2$ exposure leads to selective Hf oxidation, breaking Se--Hf bonds and expelling Se atoms. No stable Se--O bonds are observed, indicating structural reorganization rather than oxidation. These findings emphasize the material's instability in air and the importance of encapsulation for preserving HfSe$_2$ in practical applications. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy confirms the semiconducting character of the nanoparticles, with an electronic bandgap compatible with that of elemental Se. These results highlight the critical role of lattice defects and oxidation dynamics in the degradation process and underscore the need for encapsulation strategies to preserve the integrity of HfSe$_2$-based devices.

Title: Temperature-driven polarization rotation and triclinic phase at morphotropic phase boundary of Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-PbTiO3 crystals
Authors: Alexei A. Bokov, Haiyan Guo, Zuo-Guang Ye
Abstract: Information about the crystal structures in the range of morphotropic phase boundary of ferroelectric perovskite solid solutions is important for understanding their intricate properties which result in wide opportunities for practical applications. However, for the (1-x)Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-xPbTiO3 solid solution system this information is contradictory. Different composition-temperature phase diagrams have been reported for this system in literature based on the investigations of single crystals and ceramics using various experimental techniques. In this work we apply polarized light microscopy (PLM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and dielectric spectroscopy to study the crystal structure and phase transitions in the 0.68Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-0.32PbTiO3 single crystal. We confirm the monoclinic MB symmetry (space group Cm) of the room-temperature phase. According to PLM, it transforms with increasing temperature into a triclinic (Tr) phase rather than the previously reported monoclinic MC or tetragonal phase. XRD data are consistent with the presence of Tr phase. The Tr phase transforms to the monoclinic MC (Pm) phase and then to the cubic phase. Ergodic relaxor behavior is observed above the Curie temperature. The unit cell in the MC phase is pseudotetragonal with the lattice parameters a = b < c and small monoclinic angle. In the MB phase the direction of spontaneous polarization is temperature independent and close to the <111> pseudocubic direction. In the Tr and MC phases it changes with temperature so that near the Curie point it is close to [001] axis. No significant anomalies in the dielectric properties or changes in the domain structure are observed at the MB to Tr and Tr to MC phase transitions. The domain structure changes dramatically when the temperature varies within the Tr phase, causing a sharp change in birefringence.

Title: Impact of Oxygen Plasma Surface Treatment on Photoresist Adhesion in BaTiO3-Based Photonic Device Fabrication
Authors: Weiyou Kong, Weijia Kong, Lukas Chrostowski, Xin Xin
Abstract: Oxygen-plasma pre-cleans are routine before fabrication, but on BaTiO3 thin films we observed catastrophic photoresist lift-off during mild rinsing and sonication. To explain the failure, we combined optical microscopy, EDS, and XPS. EDS showed no meaningful bulk stoichiometry change, whereas XPS revealed a nanometer-scale, plasma-induced shift in surface chemistry: hydroxylation and carbonate formation consistent with a BaCO3-rich interphase at the resist/BaTiO3 boundary. This chemically weak interphase, recreated upon each plasma step and removable by simple solvent cleaning, provides the mechanism for delamination. The key takeaway for practitioners is process guidance: avoid uncritical O2-plasma use on BTO; if cleaning is required, use alternative chemistries (e.g., UV-ozone) or carefully tuned plasma windows that preserve adhesion. More broadly, the study illustrates how lightweight analytics at the surface (correlative microscopy + surface spectroscopy) can pinpoint the root cause of yield-limiting defects in oxide photonics and translate directly into higher-reliability process recipes.

Title: Quasiperiodicity-induced bulk localization with self similarity in non-Hermitian lattices
Authors: Yu-Peng Wang, Chuo-Kai Chang, Ryo Okugawa, Chen-Hsuan Hsu
Abstract: We analyze the localization behavior in a non-Hermitian lattice subject to a quasiperiodic onsite potential. We characterize localization transitions using multiple quantitative indicators, including inverse participation ratio (IPR), eigenstate fractal dimension (EFD), extended eigenstate ratio (EER), and spectral survival ratio. Despite the breaking of self-dual symmetry due to non-Hermiticity, our results reveal the existence of a critical potential strength, with its value increasing linearly with the nearest-neighbor antisymmetric hopping term. On the other hand, the inclusion of longer-range hopping not only enriches the topological properties but also gives rise to novel localization phenomena. In particular, it induces the emergence of mobility edges, as evidenced by both IPR and EFD, along with distinct features in the spectrum fractal dimension, which we extract using the box-counting method applied to the complex energy spectrum. Additionally, we uncover self-similar structures in various quantities, such as EER and complex eigenvalue ratio, as the potential strength varies. These findings highlight important aspects of localization and fractal phenomena in non-Hermitian quasiperiodic systems.

Title: Low-Frequency Noise and Resistive Switching in $β$-Na$_{0.33}$V$_2$O$_5$
Authors: Nitin Kumar, Nicholas Jerla, John Ponis, Sarbajit Banerjee, G. Sambandamurthy
Abstract: The interplay between charge ordering and its manifestation in macroscopic electrical transport in low-dimensional materials is crucial for understanding resistive switching mechanisms. In this study, we investigate the electronic transport and switching behavior of single-crystalline $\beta$-Na$_{0.33}$V$_2$O$_5$, focusing on low-frequency resistance noise dynamics of charge-order-driven resistive switching. Using electrical transport, low frequency noise spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction, we probe electron dynamics across the Na-ion- ordering (IO) and charge-ordering (CO) transitions. Near room temperature, the weak temperature dependence of the noise spectral density points to a dominance of nearest-neighbor polaron hopping. Below IO transition temperature (\( T_{IO} \sim 240 \, \text{K} \)), structural analysis reveals that Na-ions adopt a zig-zag occupancy pattern, breaking the two-fold rotational symmetry and influencing the electronic ground state. Subsequently, a sharp drop in resistance noise below the CO transition temperature (\( T_{CO} \sim 125 \, \text{K} \)) indicates the emergence of correlated electron behavior. Furthermore, application of sufficient electric field leads to the destabilization of the CO state, and a transition to a high-conducting state. The material exhibits distinct resistive switching between 35~K and 110~K, with a resistance change spanning two orders of magnitude, primarily driven by electronic mechanisms rather than Joule heating. These findings provide new insights into charge-order-induced switching and electronic correlations in quasi-one-dimensional systems, with potential applications in cryogenic memory and neuromorphic computing devices owing to the low noise levels in their stable resistive states.

Title: Physics-informed digital twins of brainbots
Authors: Isa Mammadli, Jayant Pande, Martial Noirhomme, Felix Novkoski, Andreas Maier, Nicolas Vandewalle, Ana-Suncana Smith
Abstract: A brainbot is a robotic device powered by a battery-driven motor that induces horizontal vibrations which lead to controlled two-dimensional motion. While the physical design and capabilities of a brainbot have been discussed in previous work, here we present a detailed theoretical analysis of its motion. We show that the various autonomous trajectories executed by a brainbot -- linear, spinning, orbital and helical -- are explained by a kinematic model that ascribes angular and translational velocities to the brainbot's body. This model also uncovers some trajectories that have not so far been observed experimentally. Using this kinematic framework, we present a simulation system that accurately reproduces the experimental trajectories. This can be used to parameterize a digital twin of a brainbot that executes synthetic trajectories that faithfully mimic the required statistical features of the experimental trajectories while being as long as required, such as for machine learning applications.

Title: Absence of magnetic order and magnetic fluctuations in RuO$_{2}$
Authors: Jiabin Song, Chao Mu, Shilin Zhu, Xuebo Zhou, Wei Wu, Yun-ze Long, Jianlin Luo, Zheng Li
Abstract: A novel magnetic class blending ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism, termed altermagnetism, has gained significant attention for its staggered order in coordinate and momentum spaces, time-reversal symmetry-breaking phenomena, and promising applications in spintronics. Ruthenium dioxide (RuO$_{2}$) has been considered a candidate material for altermagnetism, yet the presence of magnetic moments on Ru atoms remains a subject of debate. In this study, we systematically investigated the magnetic properties of RuO$_{2}$ powder using nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) measurements. The NQR spectra show that there is no internal magnetic field. Furthermore, the temperature independence of spin-lattice relaxation rate, $1/T_1T$, proves that there are no magnetic fluctuations. Our results unambiguously demonstrate that Ru atoms in RuO$_{2}$ possess neither static magnetic moments nor fluctuating magnetic moments, and thus RuO$_{2}$ does not possess the magnetic characteristics essential for altermagnetism.

Title: Narrow magneto-optical transitions in Erbium implanted silicon carbide-on-insulator
Authors: Alexey Lyasota, Joshua Bader, Shao Qi Lim, Brett C. Johnson, Jeffrey C. McCallum, Qing Li, Sven Rogge, Stefania Castelletto
Abstract: Solid state spin photon interfaces operating in the near telecom and telecom bands are a key resource for long distance quantum communication and scalable quantum networks. However, their optical transitions often suffer from spectral diffusion that hampers the generation of coherent spin photon entanglement. Here we demonstrate narrow magneto-optical transitions of erbium dopants implanted into thin film silicon carbide (SiC)-on-insulator, a viable platform for industrially scalable quantum networks. Using high-resolution resonant spectroscopy and spectral hole burning at cryogenic temperatures, we reveal sub megahertz homogeneous linewidths and identify two lattice sites that best stabilise the emitters. We further characterise their optical lifetimes and magneto-optical response, establishing erbium doped SiC-on-insulator as a robust and scalable platform for on-chip quantum networks.

Title: Cu-spin Correlation in the Electron-overdoped High-Tc Cuprate Thin Films of La_2-x_Ce_x_CuO_4_ Probed by Low-energy Muons
Authors: S.E. Park, Y. Kawai, A. Suter, H. Okabe, J. G. Nakamura, H. Kuwahara, Z. Salman, T. Prokscha, R. Kadono, T. Adachi
Abstract: We investigated the Cu-spin correlation in the overdoped regime of the electron-doped high-Tc cuprate thin films of La_2-x_Ce_x_CuO_4_, changing the reduction condition from muon spin relaxation using low-energy muons. The Cu-spin correlation developed at low temperatures for optimally reduced films with x=0.13 as well as x=0.17 where the superconductivity was almost suppressed. These results are contrary to those observed in the hole-doped high-Tc cuprates where the development of the antiferromagnetic Cu-spin correlation disappears together with the suppression of superconductivity. The Cu-spin correlation developed at low temperatures in x=0.17 may be understood in terms of antiferromagnetism, but it may be related to a ferromagnetic order recently suggested in the nonsuperconducting heavily overdoped La$_2-x_Ce_x_CuO_4_ with x~0.18.

Title: Elastic and Strain--Tunable Electronic and Optical Properties of La2AlGaO6 Hybrid Perovskite: A First-Principles Study
Authors: Chaithanya Purushottam Bhat, Joyti Dagar, Ashwin K. Godbole, Debashis Bandyopadhyay
Abstract: Perovskite materials, known for their structural versatility and multifunctional properties, continue to draw interest for advanced electronic and optoelectronic applications. In this study, we investigate the elastic and strain--engineered mechanical, electronic properties and optical properties of the orthorhombic La2AlGaO6 (LAGO) hybrid perovskite using first--principles quantum mechanical calculations based on density functional theory (DFT). Structural optimizations were performed using both the local density approximation (LDA) and the generalized gradient approximation (GGA). The mechanical stability of LAGO was confirmed through the Born--Huang criteria, and key elastic constants (C11, C12, C33, C44, and C66) were evaluated. These constants were further used to derive mechanical parameters such as Young's modulus, bulk modulus, shear modulus, Poisson's ratio, Cauchy's pressure, and anisotropic factor, offering insights into the material's ductility, hardness, and elastic anisotropy. Crucially, we explored the influence of biaxial strain on the electronic band structure, DOS/PDOS, and Fermi energy, revealing significant band gap modulation under compressive and tensile strain, and hence, varying the optical properties. The coupling between elastic response and electronic structure highlights LAGO's potential for tunable device applications, where mechanical stimuli can be employed to tailor its electronic functionality.

Title: Improved treatment of relativistic effects in linear augmented plane wave (LAPW) method: application to Ac, Th, ThO2 and UO2
Authors: A. V. Nikolaev, U. N. Kurelchuk, E. V. Tkalya
Abstract: We examine the influence of the relativistic effects within the linear augmented plane wave method (LAPW) with the potential of general shape for solids and suggest a few ways to account them more accurately: (1) we introduce new radial wave functions based on two actual radial solutions of the Dirac equation for j=l-1/2 and j=l+1/2 one-electron states; (2) the canonical LAPW matrix elements for the spherically symmetric component of the potential, assuming non-relativistic radial wave functions, should be corrected; (3) we argue that for a realistic spin-orbit energy splitting of the semicore 6p-states the spin-orbit interaction constant zeta(p) should be calculated with the 6p3/2 radial component; (4) in cases when two j=l +/- 1/2 components are occupied (for example for the 6p states of actinides) the electron density, associated with the small components of valence electrons, can be taken into the calculation scheme. We demonstrate that the new treatment for the relativistic effects is capable to change the equilibrium lattice constant up to 0.15~Å and the bulk modulus up to 26 GPa. We find that the electron density of valence electrons at the nucleus increases by 2.3-4.3 times due to the inclusion of small components, which can be essential for precise description of the potential and density close to the nuclear region, important for nuclear spectroscopies. In contrast to the common believe that in plain band structure treatment UO2 is a metal, we show that in the presence of the spin-orbit coupling UO2 has a small gap of forbidden states (0.2-0.4 eV) at the Fermi level, where the highest occupied and the lowest unoccupied $5f$ bands slightly overlap, as in calculations of the conduction and valence band in solid Ge.

Title: Phase Separation Dynamics and Active Turbulence in a Binary Fluid Mixture
Authors: Sohail Ahmed, Zixiang Lin, Zijie Qu
Abstract: Active matter, encompassing natural systems, converts surrounding energy to sustain autonomous motion, exhibiting unique non-equilibrium behaviors such as active turbulence and motility-induced phase separation (MIPS). In this study, we present a novel two-fluids model considering dynamics of the Cahn-Hilliard (CH) model for phase separation with Beris-Edwards nematohydrodynamics equation for orientational order and two distinct momentum equations for active and passive fluids coupled by viscous drag. A phase field-based lattice Boltzmann method is used to investigate the existence of active turbulence and phase separation in the binary mixture. We analyze micro-phase separated domain under extensile and contractile stresses, long the statistical properties of turbulent flow. Key parameters, like active parameter, tumbling parameter and elastic constant, affect the characteristic scale of flow. Our findings show that the interaction of active stress and two-fluid hydrodynamics leads to complex non-equilibrium pattern formation. This offers insights into biological and synthetic active materials.

Title: Connected correlations in cold atom experiments
Authors: Thomas Chalopin, Igor Ferrier-Barbut, Thierry Lahaye, Antoine Browaeys, David Clément
Abstract: The recent development of single-atom-resolved probes has made full counting statistics measurements accessible in quantum gas experiments. This capability provides access to high-order moments of physical observables, from which cumulants, or equivalently connected correlations, can be precisely determined. Through a selection of recent cold atom experiments, this article illustrates the significance of connected correlations in characterizing ensembles of interacting quantum particles. First, non-zero connected correlations of order n > 2 unambiguously identify non-Gaussian quantum states. Second, connected correlations of order n identify clusters made of n elements whose statistical properties are irreducible to combinations of smaller clusters. The ability to identify such multi-particle clusters offers a an interesting perspective on strongly correlated quantum states of matter at the microscopic scale.

Title: Exact Solution and Correlation Functions of Generalized Double Ising Chains
Authors: Pavel Khrapov, Stepan Shchurenkov
Abstract: In this paper the exact solution and correlation functions for a double-chain Ising model with multi-spin interactions and symmetric Hamiltonian density are obtained. The study employs the transfer matrix method to derive fundamental thermodynamic characteristics of the system. The main results include exact expressions for the partition function, free energy, internal energy, specific heat capacity, magnetization, susceptibility, and entropy in a strip of finite length and in the thermodynamic limit. The work provides explicit formulas for the eigenvalues and shows structure of eigenvectors of the transfer matrix. The expression for magnetization in the thermodynamic limit using components of normalized eigenvector corresponding to the maximum eigenvalue is obtained. A detailed analysis is conducted for a special case of interactions involving all kinds of two- and four-spin interactions. This gives the simplified formula for free energy, it is calculated using the root of quadratic equation. The research reveals properties of the system, including specific features of ground states and phase diagram characteristics. Particular attention is given to the behavior of physical quantities near frustration points and the investigation of spin correlation functions. Plots of physical characteristics, including inverse correlation length, illustrating the obtained results are constructed.

Title: Atomic-Scale Roughness of Freestanding Oxide Membranes Revealed by Electron Ptychography
Authors: Huaicheng Yuan, Yu-Chen Liu, Li-Shu Wang, Zehao Dong, Jan-Chi Yang, Zhen Chen
Abstract: Freestanding oxide films offer significant potential for integrating exotic quantum functionalities with semiconductor technologies. However, their performance is critically limited by surface roughness and interfacial imperfection caused by dangling bonds, which disrupt coherent interactions and suppress quantum phenomena at heterointerfaces. To address the challenge of structural characterization of surfaces and interfaces, we develop a metrological approach achieving atomic-scale precision in mapping the topography of both free surfaces and buried interfaces within ultrathin oxide heterostructures leveraging three-dimensional structures reconstructed from multislice electron ptychography. This method also allows for counting the number of atoms, even including light elements such as oxygen, along the electron trajectory in electron microscopy, leading to the identification of surface termination in oxide films. The planar-view of measurement geometry, allowing for large field-of-view imaging, provides remarkably rich information and high statistics about the atomic-scale structural inhomogeneities in freestanding membranes. This quantitative analysis provides unprecedented capabilities for correlating structural imperfection with quantum device performance, offering critical insights for engineering robust heterointerfaces in next-generation oxide electronics.

Title: Short-time dynamics in phase-ordering kinetics
Authors: Leila Moueddene, Malte Henkel
Abstract: Short-time dynamics in the $2D$ Blume-Capel model, with a non-conserved order-parameter and short-ranged interactions, is analysed. For non-equilibrium dynamics, both at a critical point in the $2D$ Ising universality class and at the tricritical point, we reproduce the values $\Theta=0.190({5})$ and $\Theta=-0.542({5})$, respectively, of the critical initial slip exponent. These agree with more early estimates and with the Janssen-Schaub-Schmittmann scaling relation. In phase-ordering kinetics, after a quench into the ordered phase, we establish the validity of short-time dynamics. In the $2D$ Ising universality class, we find $\Theta=0.39({1})$ in agreement with the scaling relation $\lambda=d-2\Theta$.

Title: Applicability of Electrical Conductivity Ratio Method to Complicated Band Structure and the Carrier Scattering Mechanisms of SnSe
Authors: Pan Ren, Junling Gao, Guiying Xu, Bohang Nan, Tao Guo, Quanxin Yang, Fanchen Meng, Myles McKenna, Jian He, Sitong Niu
Abstract: The electrical conductivity ratio (ECR) method can be used to analyze carrier scattering mechanism (CSM) without the need of magenetic transport measurements. In this work, the applicability of the ECR method in the analysis of complex energy band structures is discussed. Combined with the thermoelectric properties of SnSe, the feasibility using ECR method of ideal single band transport model to study the CSM of semiconductor materials with complicated band structure is studied. The results indicate that ECR method is not only applicable to idea band structure as reported before but also to the complicated band structure. The analysis results of the CSM of single crystal SnSe by ECR method using ideal single-band model agree with the carrier mobility temperature dependence in the nonphase transition temperature range. The CSM along three direction of single crystal SnSe are different because of its anisotropic crystal structure. The difference between dislocation scattering (DS) and charged impurity scattering (CIS) is that DS is always accompanied by polar optical phonon scattering (POP), such as the CSM of SnSe along b axis direction. The difference between CIS and DS can be more easily distinguished by the ECR method than the carrier mobility temperature dependent method. DS and POP might be one of the approaches to improve thermoelectric property because the scattering factor for DS or POP is larger than that of acoustic phonon scattering (APS) and alloy scattering (AS). For polycrystalline SnSe, the carrier scattering mechanisms varies with the crystal structure and the temperature. This indicates that the ECR method can better reflect the variation of carrier scattering mechanisms with temperature compared to the carrier mobility temperature dependence method.

Title: Altermagnetism and Anomalous Transport in Ag$^{2+}$ Fluorides: KAgF$_3$ and K$_2$AgF$_4$
Authors: Xiao Nan Chen, Sining Zhang, Zhengxuan Wang, Minping Zhang, Guangtao Wang
Abstract: Compounds containing Ag$^{2+}$ ion with 4d$^9$ configuration will cause significant Jahn-Teller distortions and orbital ordering. Such orbital order is closely related to the magnetic coupling, according to Goodenough-Kanamori Ruels. Our first-principles calculations reveal that the ground state of KAgF$_3$ exhibits collinear A-type antiferromagnetic (A-AFM) ordering accompanied by C-type orbital ordering. In contrast, K$_2$AgF$_4$ adopts a collinear intralayer antiferromagnetic configuration coupled with ferromagnetic orbital ordering. The A-AFM KAgF$_3$ presents distinct altermagnetic responses, including: (i) prominent anomalous transport effects, such as anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC), anomalous Nernst conductivity (ANC), and thermal anomalous Hall conductivity (TAHC); and (ii) strong magneto-optical responses, manifested through pronounced Kerr and Faraday effects. On the other hand, K$_2$AgF$_4$ behaves as a conventional collinear antiferromagnet preserving $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry, hence precluding the emergence of an anomalous Hall response.

Title: Complex dynamics of nano-oscillators with dual vortex free layers mutually coupled via spin-torques
Authors: Loukas Kokkinos, Joo-Von Kim
Abstract: Spin-torque vortex oscillators (STVOs) have been shown to exhibit rich and complex dynamical regimes, which are strongly dependent on the polarizer's configuration. Here, we give an overview of the dynamics in an STVO comprising two vortex free layers, where each layer serves as a dynamic polarizer for the other, increasing the number of degrees of freedom and therefore, the complexity of the system. The dynamics are studied through extensive micromagnetic simulations, performed using our own implementation of the coupled equations of motion, implemented in the open-source micromagnetics code Mumax3. We explore the roles of relative vortex configurations and layer asymmetry on the current-driven dynamics, and find several complex regimes, including self-modulated gyration, the emergence of C-state dynamics, as well as chaotic transitions between regular gyration and this C-state.

Title: Long-range frustration in Minimal Vertex Cover Problem on random graphs
Authors: Yu-Tao Li, Chun-Yan Zhao, Jin-Hua Zhao
Abstract: A vertex cover on a graph is a set of vertices in which each edge of the graph is adjacent to at least one vertex in the set. The Minimal Vertex Cover (MVC) Problem concerns finding vertex covers with a smallest cardinality. The MVC problem is a typical computationally hard problem among combinatorial optimization on graphs, for which both developing fast algorithms to find solution configurations on graph instances and constructing an analytical theory to estimate their ground-state properties prove to be difficult tasks. Here, by considering the long-range frustration (LRF) among MVC configurations and formulating it into a theoretical framework of a percolation model, we analytically estimate the energy density of MVCs on sparse random graphs only with their degree distributions. We test our framework on some typical random graph models. We show that, when there is a percolation of LRF effect in a graph, our predictions of energy densities are slightly higher than those from a hybrid algorithm of greedy leaf removal (GLR) procedure and survey propagation-guided decimation algorithm on graph instances, and there are still clearly closer to the results from the hybrid algorithm than an analytical theory based on GLR procedure, which ignores LRF effect and underestimates energy densities. Our results show that LRF is a proper mechanism in the formation of complex energy landscape of MVC problem and a theoretical framework of LRF helps to characterize its ground-state properties.

Title: Inverse Purcell Suppression of Decoherence in Majorana Qubits via Environmental Engineering
Authors: Vladimir Toussaint
Abstract: We propose a novel approach for optimizing topological quantum devices: instead of merely isolating qubits from environmental noise, we engineer the environment to actively suppress decoherence. For a Majorana qubit in a topological superconducting wire, we show that coupling via a parity-flipping operator ($\gamma_L$) to a broadband bosonic environment yields a decoherence rate scaling as $\Gamma \propto \rho(\epsilon)/\epsilon$, where $\rho(\epsilon)$ is the environmental density of states at the qubit splitting energy $\epsilon \sim e^{-L/\xi}$. By designing environments with suppressed density of states at low frequencies (e.g., using photonic bandgap materials or Josephson junction arrays), we achieve an ''inverse Purcell effect'' that leads to a suppression factor $F_P \propto (\epsilon/\omega_c)^\alpha$, dramatically reducing decoherence. This provides a quantitative design principle where environmental engineering transforms detrimental noise into a tool for coherence stabilization. Our work establishes environmental engineering as a powerful approach for enhancing topological quantum devices.

Title: Quasi-two-dimensional superconductivity in 1$T$-Ti$_{1-x}$Ta$_x$Se$_2$
Authors: P. Manna, S. Sharma, T. Agarwal, S. Srivastava, P. Mishra, R. P. Singh
Abstract: The emergence of two-dimensional (2D) superconductivity in bulk transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) is a fascinating area of research, as their weak interlayer coupling leads to novel superconducting behavior and offers a rich platform to host nontrivial gap structures and interactions with other electronic orders. In this work, we present a comprehensive study of the superconducting properties of bulk single-crystalline $1T$-Ti$_{1-x}$Ta$_x$Se$_2$ for x = 0.2. Our results confirm the weakly coupled anisotropic superconductivity. Angle-dependent upper critical field measurements and observation of a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition confirm the quasi-2D nature of the superconducting state. These results position $1T$-Ti$_{1-x}$Ta$_x$Se$_2$ as a promising platform for exploring low-dimensional superconducting physics and highlight bulk TMD crystals as a promising platform for realizing intrinsic 2D superconductivity, opening avenues for future quantum applications.

Title: Polariton-induced superconductivity in two-dimensional metals
Authors: Riccardo Riolo, Frank H.L. Koppens, Pablo Jarillo-Herrero, Giacomo Mazza, Allan H. MacDonald, Marco Polini
Abstract: The electronic properties of two-dimensional (2D) metals are altered by changes in their three-dimensional dielectric environment. In this Letter we propose that superconductivity can be induced in a 2D metal by resonant coupling between its plasmonic collective modes and optical phonons in a nearby polar dielectric. Specifically, we predict that relatively high-temperature superconductivity can be induced in bilayer graphene twisted to an angle somewhat larger than the magic value by surrounding it with a THz polar dielectric. Our conclusions are based on numerical solutions of Eliashberg equations for massless Dirac fermions with tunable Fermi velocities and Fermi energies, and can be understood qualitatively in terms of a generalized McMillan formula.

Title: Conventional and practical metallic superconductivity arising from repulsive Coulomb coupling
Authors: Sankar Das Sarma, Jay D. Sau, Yi-Ting Tu
Abstract: A concrete question is discussed: Can there be conventional $s$-wave superconductivity in regular 3D metals, i.e., electrons in a jellium background, interacting via the standard Coulomb coupling? We are interested in 'practical' superconductivity that can in principle be observed in experiments, so the $T=0$ ground state being superconducting is not of interest, or for that matter a $T_c$ which is exponentially small and therefore 'impractical' is also not of interest in the current work. We find that almost any theory based on the BCS-Migdal-Eliashberg paradigm, with some form of screened Coulomb coupling replacing the electron-phonon coupling in the BCS or Eliashberg theory, would uncritically predict absurdly high $T_c\sim100$ K in all metals (including the alkali metals, which are well-described by the jellium model) arising from the unavoidable fact that the Fermi, plasmon, and Coulomb potential energy scales are all $>10^4$ K. Therefore, we conclude, based on reduction ad absurdum, that the violation of the venerable Migdal theorem in this problem is sufficiently disruptive that no significance can be attached to numerous existing theoretical publications in the literature claiming plasmon-induced (or other similar Coulomb coupling-induced) practical SC. Using a careful analysis of the Eliashberg gap equations we find that the superconducting $T_c$ of the 3D electron gas can be reduced below the $\sim1$ K range depending on choices of frequency and momentum cut-off parameters that are introduced to satisfy Migdall's theorem but are apriori unknown. The only believable result is the one discovered sixty years ago by Kohn and Luttinger predicting non-$s$-wave SC arising from Friedel oscillations with exponentially (and unobservably) low $T_c$. We provide several theoretical approaches using both BCS and Eliashberg theories and different screening models to make our point.

Title: Accessing Energetically Restricted Optical Transitions in a Single Free-Base Porphyrin Molecule
Authors: Eve Ammerman, Nils Krane, Bruno Schuler
Abstract: Characterizing the electronic properties of single atoms, molecules, and nanostructures is the hallmark of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Recently, exploration of a complex manifold of nonequilibrium many-body electron configurations has been enabled by the development of STM electroluminescence methods (STML). STML provides access to optical properties of individual molecules through a cascade of relaxation processes between many-body states that obey energy conservation. Insufficient charge attachment energies quench the relaxation cascade via optically excited states, causing even intrinsically bright molecules to remain dark in STML. Here, we leverage substrate work function control and tip-induced gating of the double barrier tunnel junction to induce an energy shift of the ionic transition state of a single free-base tetrabenzoporphyrin (H2TBP) to gain access to optically excited states and bright exciton emission. The experimental observations are validated by a rate equation and polaron model considering the relaxation energy of the NaCl decoupling layer upon charging of the molecule.

Title: The correspondence theory: How supercompatibility conditions, transformations twins, and austenite-martensite interfaces are determined directly from correspondence, metrics and symmetries
Authors: Cyril Cayron
Abstract: The phenomenological theory of martensite crystallography (PTMC) explains the main crystallographic and microstructural features of martensite in shape memory alloys, such as the transformation twins between the martensite variants, and the interfaces between austenite and martensite bi-variant laminates. It also permits to determine which austenite and martensite lattice parameters should be targeted to get supercompatibility, which has driven over the last decades important research and development of new shape memory alloys with low hysteresis and high cyclability. First, we show that the cofactor conditions generally used to define supercompatibility are not necessary because they are redundant with the invariant plane condition. Second, we develop an alternative to the PTMC, called correspondence theory (CT). The mathematical tools of the PTMC come from continuum mechanics (pole decompositions and stretch tensors); they are advantageously replaced here by pure crystallographic tools (metric tensors, group of symmetries and correspondence), which allow direct calculations of the transformation twins and their generic and non-generic characters. A new symmetric matrix, called compatibility of metrics by correspondence (CMC) is also introduced. The supercompatibility condition can now be understood and written as the degeneracy of a quadratic form of the CMC, or geometrically as the degeneracy of double-cone into a double-plane, a plane, or the full space. We also show that for usual martensitic transformations, the different types of habit planes formed by bi-variant laminates can be determined from the CMC matrix, in a more rigorous and efficient way than that proposed by the PTMC. The CT does not differ from the PTMC in its foundations, but is represents a good alternative to understand and calculate the crystallographic properties of martensite in shape memory alloys.

Title: Controlling Vortex Rotation in Dry Active Matter
Authors: Felipe P. S. Júnior, Jorge L. C. Domingos, W. P. Ferreira, F. Q. Potiguar
Abstract: We investigate the rotation of a vortex around a circular obstacle in dry active matter in the presence of M half-circles distributed around the obstacle. To quantify this effect, we define the parameter {\Pi}M , which is the ratio between the mean angular velocity of the controlled vortex and the root-mean-square angular velocity of the isolated vortex. We identify two rotational regimes determined by the obstacle configuration. In the first regime, where {\Pi}M < 0 corresponding to the flat side of the half-circles facing the vortex, the rotation is clockwise. In the second regime ({\Pi}M > 0), it corresponding to the curved sides facing the vortex, the rotation becomes counterclockwise. We further analyze the impact of this control on vortex stability, showing that the configuration of semi-circles can enhance or suppress stability depending on their geometry and distance from the central obstacle. Our results demonstrate a possible setup to control the spontaneous rotation of dry active matter around circular obstacles.

Title: Diode effect in a skyrmion-coupled high-temperature Josephson junction
Authors: Digvijay Singh, Pankaj Sharma, Narayan Mohanta
Abstract: We show that a planar Josephson junction having $d$-wave superconducting regions, with a skyrmion crystal placed underneath, produces a robust gate-tunable superconducting diode effect. The spatially-varying exchange field of the skyrmion crystal breaks both inversion and time-reversal symmetries, leading to an asymmetric current-phase relation with an anomalous phase shift. Our theoretical calculations, obtained using resistively and capacitively shunted junction model combined with Bogoliubov-de Gennes method, reveal that the diode efficiency is largely tunable by controlling external gate voltage and skyrmion radius. Incorporation of a $d$-wave superconductor such as high-$T_c$ Cuprate enables the diode to function at higher operating temperatures. Our results establish a unique and practically-realizable mechanism for devising tunable field-free superconducting diodes based on magnetic texture-superconductor hybrid platforms.

Title: Charged impurity scattering in two-dimensional topological insulators with Mexican-hat dispersion
Authors: Bagun S. Shchamkhalova, Vladimir A. Sablikov
Abstract: Scattering by charged impurities is known to mainly determine transport properties of electrons in modern quantum materials, but it remains poorly studied for materials with Mexican hat dispersion. Due to such nontrivial features as a singular density of states and a ring-shaped Fermi surface, electron-electron interaction and electron transitions between different isoenergetic contours are of key importance in this materials. We show that these factors significantly affect both the spatial profile of the screened potential of Coulomb centers and the dependence of mobility on temperature and electron density. The screened potential is calculated within the random phase approximation. The transport properties are determined without using the usual relaxation time approximation, since the distribution function in energy space is a vector defined by a system of two equations.

Title: Negative dynamic conductance of a quantum wire with unscreened Coulomb interaction
Authors: Bagun S. Shchamkhalova, Vladimir A. Sablikov
Abstract: Dynamic conductance and time-of-flight current instability in a quantum wire connected to electron reservoirs under DC bias voltage are studied in the absence of a gate screening the Coulomb interaction of electrons. Due to a strong electron-electron interaction, dramatic rearrangements of the charge density distribution and the potential landscape in the wire occur at a sufficiently high DC bias voltage. The applied voltage is screened mainly near the cathode contact, and an almost flat potential profile is established in the most of the wire. Thus, the size of the region of a population inversion of electronic states greatly increases, and the band of wave vectors that form unstable modes of electronic waves significantly reduces. As a result, the conditions for the occurrence of the time-of-flight instability are greatly facilitated and the negative dynamic conductivity increases.

Title: Tuning the Electronic Structure of Graphene by Controlling Spatial Confinement
Authors: Mohammadamir Bazrafshan, Thomas. D. Kühne
Abstract: The electronic properties of a material depend on the spatial freedom of the electron wavefunction. A well-known example is graphite, which is a conventional gapless semiconductor, while a single layer of it, graphene, exhibits extremely high electronic conductivity. Nevertheless, graphene ribbons can have different physical properties, such as a tunable band gap, from gapless to large band gap semiconductor. The purpose of this study is to investigate the electronic structure of graphene few-layers composed of a layer of graphene nanoribbons and graphene sheet(s), %\textcolor{blue}{or a Sheebbon}, where quasi-one-dimensional nanoribbons can interact with two-dimensional sheet of graphite. Using the tight-binding model for graphite, we show how different configuration of such heterostructures can affect the electronic structure, in which is different from their components electronic structure. Namely, a gap of ~0.6 eV can be opened in a bilayer configuration composed of a layer of gapless armchair nanoribbon stacked on graphene.

Title: Geomimicry: Emergent Dynamics in Earth-Mediated Complex Materials
Authors: Shravan Pradeep, Emanuela del Gado, Douglas J. Jerolmack, Paulo E. Arratia
Abstract: Soils and sediments are soft, amorphous materials with complex microstructures and mechanical properties, that are also building blocks for industrial materials such as concrete. These Earth-mediated materials evolve under prolonged environmental pressures like mechanical stress, chemical gradients, and biological activity. Here, we introduce geomimicry, a new paradigm for designing sustainable materials by learning from the emergent and adaptive dynamics of Earth-mediated matter. Drawing a parallel to biomimicry, we posit that these geomaterials follow evolutionary design rules, optimizing their structure and function in response to persistent natural forces. Our central argument is that by decoding these rules: primarily through understanding the emergence of novel exotic properties from multiscale interactions between heterogenous components, we can engineer a new class of adaptive, sustainable matter. We propose two complementary approaches here. The top-down approach looks to nature to identify building blocks and map them to functional groups defined by their mechanical (rather than chemical) behaviors, and then examine how environmental training tunes interactions among these groups. The bottom up approach seeks to leverage and test this framework, building earth materials one component at a time under prescribed fluctuating stresses that guide assembly of complex and out-of-equilibrium materials. The goal is to create materials with programmed functionalities, such as erosion resistance or self-healing capabilities. Geomimicry offers a pathway to truly design Earth-mediated circular materials, with potential applications ranging from climate-resilient soils and smart agriculture to new insights into planetary terraforming, fundamentally shifting the focus from static compositions to dynamic, evolving systems that are mediated via their environment.

Title: Ferroelectricity-driven altermagnetism in two-dimensional van der Waals multiferroics
Authors: Bo Zhao, Fu Li, Wei Ren, Hao Wang, Hongbin Zhang
Abstract: Altermagnets (AMs) are a recently identified class of unconventional collinear compensated antiferromagnets that exhibit momentum-dependent spin splitting despite having zero net magnetization. This unconventional magnetic order gives rise to a range of phenomena, including the anomalous Hall effect, chiral magnons, and nonlinear photocurrents. Here, using spin space group (SSG) symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations, we demonstrate an efficient strategy to control altermagnetism in two-dimensional multiferroics through ferroelectric polarization and interlayer sliding. For material realization, we find that monolayer and bilayer FeCuP2S6 exhibit finite spin splitting when ferroelectric sublattices are connected by nonsymmorphic screw-axis operations rather than pure translation or inversion symmetry. Interlayer sliding further enables reversible switching or suppression of spin splitting through modifications of the SSG. Our calculations further reveal that the anomalous Hall response serves as a direct probe of these spin-split states. These findings establish two-dimensional van der Waals multiferroics as promising platforms for realizing electrically controllable altermagnetism and advancing next-generation spintronic and magnetoelectric technologies.

Title: The stability and topological behaviors in lanthanide antiperovskite nitrides: a high-throughput study
Authors: Shuxiang Zhou, Kevin Vallejo, Krzysztof Gofryk
Abstract: Antiperovskite (APV) nitrides exhibit a diverse range of electronic properties, including superconductivity, magnetic effects, and nontrivial topological behaviors. In this study, we propose a new family of APV nitrides by incorporating 4$f$-electron metals, known for strong electron correlations, localized magnetic moments, and spin-orbit coupling, to further explore the unique properties of APVs. A high-throughput density functional theory (DFT) calculation was utilized to identify stable lanthanide APV nitride compounds. To address the challenge of strong electron correlation, we developed a double-screening framework that assumes either a fully itinerant or localized nature of the $f$-electrons during calculations. Using this approach, we systematically identified 37 stable lanthanide APV nitride compounds from both thermodynamic and dynamical perspectives. Furthermore, we report nontrivial topological behaviors observed among these stable lanthanide APV nitride compounds, as computed by DFT. Notably, Dirac and semi-Dirac cones are observed near the Fermi level for Er$_3$TlN. This study opens a pathway to investigate lanthanide APVs, revealing potential novel physical properties by leveraging the rich physics of both APVs and $f$-electrons.

Title: Correspondence Between Ising Machines and Neural Networks
Authors: Andrew G. Moore
Abstract: Computation with the Ising model is central to future computing technologies like quantum annealing, adiabatic quantum computing, and thermodynamic classical computing. Traditionally, computed values have been equated with ground states. This paper generalizes computation with ground states to computation with spin averages, allowing computations to take place at high temperatures. It then introduces a systematic correspondence between Ising devices and neural networks and a simple method to run trained feed-forward neural networks on Ising-type hardware. Finally, a mathematical proof is offered that these implementations are always successful.

Title: A CN complex as an alternative to the T center in Si
Authors: J. K. Nangoi, M. E. Turiansky, C. G. Van de Walle
Abstract: We present a first-principles study of a carbon-nitrogen (CN) impurity complex in silicon as an isoelectronic alternative to the T center [(CCH)$_\mathrm{Si}$]. The latter has been pursued for applications in quantum information science, yet its sensitivity to the presence of hydrogen is still problematic. Our proposed complex has no hydrogen, thereby eliminating this issue. First, we show that the CN complex is stable against decomposition into substitutional and interstitial defects. Next, we show that due to being isoelectronic to the T center, the CN complex has a similar electronic structure, and therefore could be used in similar applications. We assess several low-energy configurations of the CN complex, finding (CN)$_\mathrm{Si}$ to be stable and have the largest Debye-Waller factor. We predict a zero-phonon line (ZPL) of 828 meV (in the telecom S-band) and a radiative lifetime of 4.2 $\mu$s, comparable to the T center. Due to the presence of a bound exciton, choice of the exchange-correlation functional and also supercell-size scaling of the ZPL and transition dipole moment require special scrutiny; we rigorously justify our extrapolation schemes that allow computing values in the dilute limit.

Title: Characterising Atomic-Scale Surface Disorder on 2D Materials Using Neutral Atoms
Authors: Chenyang Zhao, Sam M. Lambrick, Ke Wang, Shaoliang Guan, Aleksandar Radic, David J. Ward, Andrew P. Jardine, Boyao Liu
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), such as MoS2, have the potential to be widely used in electronic devices and sensors due to their high carrier mobility and tunable band structure. In 2D TMD devices, surface and interface cleanness can critically impact the performance and reproducibility. Even sample surfaces prepared under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) can be contaminated, causing disorder. On such samples, trace levels of submonolayer contamination remain largely overlooked, and conventional surface characterisation techniques have limited capability in detecting such adsorbates. Here, we apply scanning helium microscopy (SHeM), a non-destructive and ultra-sensitive technique, to investigate the surface cleanness of 2D MoS2. Our measurements reveal that even minute amounts of adventitious carbon induce atomic-scale disorder across MoS2 surfaces, leading to the disappearance of helium diffraction. By tracking helium reflectivity over time, we quantify the decay of surface order across different microscopic regions and find that flat areas are more susceptible to contamination than regions near edges. These findings highlight the fragility of surface order in 2D materials, even under UHV, and establish SHeM as a powerful tool for non-damaging microscopic 2D material cleanness characterisation. The approach offers a new route to wafer-scale characterisation of 2D material quality.

Title: Detecting active Lévy particles using differential dynamic microscopy
Authors: Mingyang Li, Yu'an Li, H. P. Zhang, Yongfeng Zhao
Abstract: Detecting Lévy flights of cells has been a challenging problem in experiments. The challenge lies in accessing data in spatiotemporal scales across orders of magnitude, which is necessary for reliably extracting a power-law scaling. Differential dynamic microscopy has been shown to be a powerful method that allows one to acquire statistics of cell motion across scales, which is a potentially versatile method for detecting Lévy walks in biological systems. In this article, we extend the differential dynamic microscopy method to self-propelled Lévy particles, whose run-time distribution has a algebraic tail. We validate our protocol using synthetic imaging data and show that a reliable detection of active Lévy particles requires accessing length scales of one order of magnitude larger than its persistence length. Applying the protocol to experimental data of E. coli and E. gracilis, we find that E. coli exhibits no signature of Lévy walks, while E. gracilis is better described as active Lévy particles.

Title: Gate Dielectric Engineering with an Ultrathin Silicon-oxide Interfacial Dipole Layer for Low-Leakage Oxide-Semiconductor Memories
Authors: Fabia F. Athena, Jonathan Hartanto, Matthias Passlack, Jack C. Evans, Jimmy Qin, Didem Dede, Koustav Jana, Shuhan Liu, Tara Peña, Eric Pop, Greg Pitner, Iuliana P. Radu, Paul C. McIntyre, H.-S. Philip Wong
Abstract: We demonstrate a gate dielectric engineering approach leveraging an ultrathin, atomic layer deposited (ALD) silicon oxide interfacial layer (SiL) between the amorphous oxide semiconductor (AOS) channel and the high-k gate dielectric. SiL positively shifts the threshold voltage (V$_T$) of AOS transistors, providing at least four distinct $V_T$ levels with a maximum increase of 500 mV. It achieves stable $V_T$ control without significantly degrading critical device parameters such as mobility, on-state current, all while keeping the process temperature below 225 $^{\circ}$C and requiring no additional heat treatment to activate the dipole. Positive-bias temperature instability tests at 85 $^{\circ}$C indicate a significant reduction in negative $V_{T}$ shifts for SiL-integrated devices, highlighting enhanced reliability. Incorporating this SiL gate stack into two-transistor gain-cell (GC) memory maintains a more stable storage node voltage ($V_{SN}$) (reduces $V_{SN}$ drop by 67\%), by limiting unwanted charge losses. SiL-engineered GCs also reach retention times up to 10,000 s at room temperature and reduce standby leakage current by three orders of magnitude relative to baseline device, substantially lowering refresh energy consumption.

Title: Time Reversal Symmetry Broken Electronic Phases in Thin Films of Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+δ}$
Authors: Sohini Guin, Naresh Shyaga, Jagadish Rajendran, Aryaman Das, Subhransu Kumar Negi, Saisab Bhowmik, Pankaj Bhardwaj, U. Chandni, Dhavala Suri
Abstract: High-temperature superconductors (high-Tc SCs) host a rich landscape of electronic phases encompassing the pseudogap, strange metal, superconducting, antiferromagnetic insulating, and Fermi-liquid regimes. The superconducting phase is notable for non-dissipative electronic functionality at relatively high temperatures. These phases are commonly probed in thermodynamic phase space by varying temperature or current through the sample. They can also be probed by breaking time-reversal symmetry (TRS) with an external magnetic field, which yields transition signatures distinct from those arising solely from temperature or current tuning. Here we show that electron transport in Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ is primarily governed by two-dimensional superconductivity consistent with a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) topological phase transition, as supported by current-voltage characteristics measured under temperature variation; these measurements preserve TRS. In contrast, when an external magnetic field is applied, the superconducting state is consistently preceded by weak antilocalization (WAL), where bound vortex-antivortex pairs dissociate into a normal metallic state through an intermediate localized phase. We further establish that highly disordered films exhibit transport dominated by three-dimensional weak localization, with superconductivity entirely suppressed.

Title: Magneto-Chiral Anisotropy in Josephson Diode Effect of All-Metallic Lateral Junctions with Interfacial Rashba Spin-Orbit Coupling
Authors: Maximilian Mangold, Lorenz Bauriedl, Johanna Berger, Chang Yu-Cheng, Thomas N.G. Meier, Matthias Kronseder, Pertti Hakonen, Christian H. Back, Christoph Strunk, Dhavala Suri
Abstract: We explore the role of interfacial Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) for the Josephson diode effect in all-metal diffusive Josephson junctions. Devices with Fe/Pt and Cu/Pt weak links between Nb leads reveal a Josephson diode effect in an in-plane magnetic field with magneto-chiral anisotropy according to the symmetry of Rashba SOC. The Rashba SOC originates from inversion symmetry breaking at the metal-metal interfaces. A control sample with a plain Cu-layer as weak link exhibits also a finite diode efficiency that, in contrast, is independent of the angle between current and field. The Fraunhofer patterns display an apparent inverted hysteresis which can be traced back to stray fields resulting from the conventional hysteretic vortex pinning in the Nb contacts.

Title: Exchange operation of Majorana zero modes in topological insulator-based Josephson trijunctions

Abstract: Majorana zero modes are anyons obeying non-Abelian exchange statistics distinct from fermions or bosons. While significant progresses have been achieved in the past two decades in searching for these exotic excitations in solid-state systems, their non-Abelian nature remains unverified, as definitive proof requires braiding operations. Here, we report preliminarily experimental advances in creating, manipulating, and exchanging the presumed Majorana zero modes in an envelope-shaped Josephson device composed of multiple trijunctions on a topological insulator surface. We observed the signatures of in-gap states migration consistent with the expectations of the Fu-Kane model, supporting the realization of an exchange operation. This work would establish a critical pathway toward ultimately braiding Majorana zero modes in the Fu-Kane scheme of topological quantum computation.

Title: Instability toward Superconducting Stripe Phase in Altermagnets with Strong Rashba Spin-Orbit Coupling
Authors: Kohei Mukasa, Yusuke Masaki
Abstract: We numerically investigate finite-momentum superconductivity in noncentrosymmetric metallic altermagnets with $d$-wave spin-splitting and strong Rashba-type spin-orbit coupling. Focusing on a stripe phase in which Cooper pairs acquire multiple center-of-mass momenta, we construct phase diagrams that reveal phase boundaries between the stripe phase and a helical phase characterized by a single center-of-mass momentum. Our results show that the stripe phase emerges at low temperatures and exhibits a reentrant behavior as a function of the strength of the altermagnetic splitting. We further analyze the stripe phase within a linearized gap equation, and uncover the mechanism of the pairing formation unique to the stripe phase. This mechanism originates from the anisotropic deformation of the Fermi surfaces induced by the altermagnetic splitting, highlighting the intriguing interplay between the spin-orbit coupling and the altermagnets.

Title: Competition between Glassy Five-Fold Structures and Locally Dense Packing Structures Governs Two-Stage Compaction of Granular Hexapods
Authors: Rudan Luo, Houfei Yuan, Yi Xing, Yeqiang Huang, Jiahao Liu, Wei Huang, Haiyang Lu, Zhuan Ge, Yonglun Jiang, Chengjie Xia, Zhikun Zeng, Yujie Wang
Abstract: Using X-ray tomography, we experimentally investigate the structural evolution of packings composed of 3D-printed hexapod particles, each formed by three mutually orthogonal spherocylinders, during tap-induced compaction. We identify two distinct structural compaction mechanisms: an initial stage dominated by enhanced particle interlocking, which yields local mechanically stable structures through strong geometric entanglement, and a later stage characterized by the formation of dense polytetrahedral aggregates and a sharp increase in the number of five-ring motifs. The emergence of these five-fold symmetric structures indicates that, despite their highly concave geometry, hexapod packings can be effectively treated as hard-sphere-like systems and exhibit similar glass-like disordered configurations. The frustration between local mechanically stable structures and global glassy order suggests a universal organizational principle underlying the structure of uniform and isotropic disordered granular materials.

Title: Optimized mouldboard design for efficient soil inversion using the discrete element method
Authors: Vinay Badewale, Sujith Reddy Jaggannagari, Prasad Avilala, Ratna Kumar Annabattula
Abstract: The design of a mouldboard (MB) plough is critical for achieving efficient soil inversion, which directly impacts soil aeration, weed control, and overall agricultural productivity. In this work, a design modification of the cylindroid-shaped MB plough is proposed, focusing on optimizing its surface profile to enhance performance. The discrete element method is used to simulate the ploughing process and evaluate the performance of the modified plough profile. The modified plough profile is compared against a previously proposed design to assess its impact on soil inversion efficiency, wear reduction, and stress distribution. A novel methodology is introduced to evaluate the plough's performance in soil inversion. The modified design demonstrates superior soil inversion efficiency, with improvements of up to $32.95\%$ in the inversion index for different velocities. The modified design achieves a notable reduction in wear up to $23.7\%$, compared to the original design. Although a slight increase in stress is observed in the modified design due to higher forces, the induced stresses remain well within the permissible limits for the plough material. Overall, the findings highlight the advantages of the modified plough design, including enhanced soil inversion efficiency and reduced wear, underscoring its potential for improved performance in tillage applications. However, the current study is limited to simulation-based analysis without experimental or field validation. Future work will focus on full-scale physical experiments to validate the simulation outcomes and incorporate additional factors such as depth-dependent moisture, soil cohesion, and multi-factor wear models for improved predictive accuracy.

Title: Representation of the Luttinger Liquid with Single Point-like Impurity as a Field Theory for the Phase of Scattering
Authors: V. V. Afonin
Abstract: A new approach describing Luttinger Liquid with point-like impurity as field theory for the phase of scattering is developed. It based on a matching of the electron wave functions at impurity position point. As a result of the approach, an expression for non-local action has been taken. The non-locality of the theory leads to convergence of the observed values in an ultraviolet region. It allows studying conductance of the channel up to electron-electron interaction strength of the order of unit. Expansion of the non-local action in small frequency powers makes possible to develop a new approach to the renormalization group analysis of the problem. This method differs from the "poor man's" approach widely used in solid-state physics. We have shown, in the Luttinger Liquid "poor man's" approach breaks already in two-loop approximation. We analyse the reason of this discrepancy. The qualitative picture of the phenomenon is discussed.

Title: Field-Tunable Anisotropic Fulde-Ferrell Phase in NbSe$_2$/CrSiTe$_3$ Heterostructures
Authors: Jiadian He, Xin-Zhi Li, Chen Xu, Yifan Ding, Yueshen Wu, Jinghui Wang, Peng Dong, Yan-Fang Li, Wei Li, Xiang Zhou, Yanfeng Guo, Yulin Chen, Wen-Yu He, Jun Li
Abstract: The emergence of superconductivity in two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides with strong spin orbit coupling (SOC) has opened new avenues for exploring exotic superconducting states. Here, we report experimental observation of an anisotropic Fulde-Ferrell (FF) phase in few-layer NbSe$_2$/CrSiTe$_3$ heterostructures under in-plane magnetic fields. Through combined magnetoresistance and nonreciprocal transport measurements, we find that due to the couplings from the ferromagnetic CrSiTe$_3$, a half-dome-shaped region emerges in the magnetic field-temperature ($B$-$T$) diagram. Importantly, the half-dome-shaped region exhibits finite second harmonic resistance with in-plane anisotropy, indicating that the superconducting state is an anisotropic FF phase. Through a symmetry analysis combined with mean field calculations, we attribute the emergent anisotropic FF phase to the CrSiTe$_3$ layer induced Rashba SOC and three-fold rotational symmetry breaking. These results demonstrate that heterostructure stacking is a powerful tool for symmetry engineering in superconductors, which can advance the design of quantum devices in atomically thin superconducting materials.

Title: Point-contact enhanced superconductivity in trigonal PtBi2: quest for the origin of high-Tc
Authors: O. E. Kvitnitskaya, L. Harnagea, G. Shipunov, S. Aswartham, V. V. Fisun, D. V. Efremov, B. Büchner, Yu. G. Naidyuk
Abstract: We studied enhanced superconductivity in point contacts (PCs) based on a type-I Weyl semimetal t-PtBi2 using both normal metal (Ag, Cu, Pt) and ferromagnetic (Fe, Co, Ni) tips by measuring the differential resistance dV/dI(V) curves. In most cases, the value of the superconducting critical temperature Tc ranges between 3 and 5 K, which is several times higher than the maximal bulk Tc. At the same time, among dozens of PCs with higher Tc, a few of them reach Tc up to 8 K, including those with both normal and ferromagnetic tips. The critical magnetic field is also highly enhanced in PCs and reaches up to several Tesla. The common reason for the Tc increase may be related to pressure/strain caused at the PC's formation. Moreover, a greater increase in Tc is observed for PCs formed at the edge of the sample flake than for those formed on the plane. The results also reveal that the growth of Tc in PCs based on t-PtBi2 is compatible with ferromagnetism in Fe, Co, and Ni tips, initiating discussion as to the possible non-trivial nature of enhanced superconductivity. Anyway, our findings suggest that t-PtBi2 is a promising candidate for realizing topological superconductivity at more accessible temperatures

Title: Validation of Semi-Empirical xTB Methods for High-Throughput Screening of TADF Emitters: A 747-Molecule Benchmark Study
Authors: Jean-Pierre Tchapet Njafa, Elvira Vanelle Kameni Tcheuffa, Aissatou Maghame, Serge Guy Nana Engo
Abstract: Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters are essential for next-generation, high-efficiency organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), yet their rational design is hampered by the high computational cost of accurate excited-state predictions. Here, we present a comprehensive benchmark study validating semi-empirical extended tight-binding (xTB) methods -- specifically sTDA-xTB and sTD-DFT-xTB -- for the high-throughput screening of TADF materials. Using an unprecedentedly large dataset of \num{747} experimentally characterized emitters, our framework demonstrates a computational cost reduction of over \qty{99}{\percent} compared to conventional TD-DFT, while maintaining strong internal consistency between methods (Pearson $r \approx \num{0.82}$ for \deltaest), validating their utility for relative molecular ranking. Validation against \num{312} experimental \deltaest values reveals a mean absolute error of approximately \qty{0.17}{\electronvolt}, a discrepancy attributed to the vertical approximation inherent to the HTS protocol, underscoring the methods' role in screening rather than quantitative prediction. Through large-scale data analysis, we statistically validate key design principles, confirming the superior performance of Donor-Acceptor-Donor (D-A-D) architectures and identifying an optimal D-A torsional angle range of \qtyrange{50}{90}{\degree} for efficient TADF. Principal Component Analysis reveals that the complex property space is fundamentally low-dimensional, with three components capturing nearly \qty{90}{\percent} of the variance. This work establishes these semi-empirical methods as powerful, cost-effective tools for accelerating TADF discovery and provides a robust set of data-driven design rules and methodological guidelines for the computational materials science community.

Title: Exploring the limit of the Lattice-Bisognano-Wichmann form describing the Entanglement Hamiltonian: A quantum Monte Carlo study
Authors: Siyi Yang, Yi-Ming Ding, Zheng Yan
Abstract: The entanglement Hamiltonian (EH) encapsulates the essential entanglement properties of a quantum many-body system and serves as a powerful theoretical construct. From the EH, one can extract a variety of entanglement quantities, such as entanglement entropies, negativity, and the entanglement spectrum. However, its general analytical form remains largely unknown. While the Bisognano-Wichmann theorem gives an exact EH form for Lorentz-invariant field theories, its validity on lattice systems is limited, especially when Lorentz invariance is absent. In this work, we propose a general scheme based on the lattice-Bisognano-Wichmann (LBW) ansatz and multi-replica-trick quantum Monte Carlo methods to numerically reconstruct the entanglement Hamiltonian in two-dimensional systems and systematically explore its applicability to systems without translational invariance, going beyond the original scope of the primordial Bisognano-Wichmann theorem. Various quantum phases--including gapped and gapless phases, critical points, and phases with either discrete or continuous symmetry breaking--are investigated, demonstrating the versatility of our method in reconstructing entanglement Hamiltonians. Furthermore, we find that when the entanglement boundary of a system is ordinary (i.e., free from surface anomalies), the LBW ansatz provides an accurate approximation well beyond Lorentz-invariant cases. Our work thus establishes a general framework for investigating the analytical structure of entanglement in complex quantum many-body systems.

Title: Minimum Action Principle for Entropy Production Rate of Far-From-Equilibrium Systems
Authors: Atul Tanaji Mohite, Heiko Rieger
Abstract: The Boltzmann distribution connects the energetics of an equilibrium system with its statistical properties, and it is desirable to have a similar principle for non-equilibrium systems. Here, we derive a variational principle for the entropy production rate (EPR) of far-from-equilibrium discrete state systems, relating it to the action for the transition probability measure of discrete state processes. This principle leads to a tighter, non-quadratic formulation of the dissipation function, speed limits, the thermodynamic-kinetic uncertainty relation, the large deviation rate functional, and the fluctuation relation, all within a unified framework of the thermodynamic length. Additionally, the optimal control of non-conservative transition affinities using the underlying geodesic structure is explored, and the corresponding slow-driving and finite-time optimal driving exact protocols are analytically computed. We demonstrate that discontinuous endpoint jumps in optimal protocols are a generic, model-independent physical mechanism that reduces entropy production during finite-time driving of far-from-equilibrium systems.

Title: Thermodynamic Length in Stochastic Thermodynamics of Far-From-Equilibrium Systems: Unification of Fluctuation Relation and Thermodynamic Uncertainty Relation
Authors: Atul Tanaji Mohite, Heiko Rieger
Abstract: The Boltzmann distribution for an equilibrium system constrains the statistics of the system by the energetics. Despite the non-equilibrium generalization of the Boltzmann distribution being studied extensively, a unified framework valid for far-from-equilibrium discrete state systems is lacking. Here, we derive an exact path-integral representation for discrete state processes and represent it using the exponential of the action for stochastic transition dynamics. Solving the variational problem, the effective action is shown to be equal to the inferred entropy production rate (a thermodynamic quantity) and a non-quadratic dissipation function of the thermodynamic length (TL) defined for microscopic stochastic currents (a dynamic quantity). This formulates a far-from-equilibrium analog of the Boltzmann distribution, namely, the minimum action principle. The non-quadratic dissipation function is physically attributed to incorporating non-Gaussian fluctuations or far-from-equilibrium non-conservative driving. Further, an exact large deviation dynamical rate functional is derived. The equivalence of the variational formulation with the information geometric formulation is proved. The non-quadratic TL recovers the non-quadratic thermodynamic-kinetic uncertainty relation (TKUR) and the speed limits, which are tighter than the close-to-equilibrium quadratic formulations. Moreover, if the transition affinities are known, the non-quadratic TL recovers the fluctuation relation (FR). The minimum action principle manifests the non-quadratic TKUR and FR as two faces corresponding to the thermodynamic inference and partial control descriptions, respectively. In addition, the validity of these results is extended to coarse-grained observable currents, strengthening the experimental/numerical applicability of them.

Title: Generalized Finite-time Optimal Control Framework in Stochastic Thermodynamics
Authors: Atul Tanaji Mohite, Heiko Rieger
Abstract: Optimal processes in stochastic thermodynamics are a frontier for understanding the control and design of non-equilibrium systems, with broad practical applications in biology, chemistry, and nanoscale/mesoscale systems. Optimal mass transport theory and thermodynamic geometry have emerged as optimal control methodology, but they are based on slow-driving and close to equilibrium assumptions. An optimal control framework in stochastic thermodynamics for finite time driving is still elusive. Therefore, we solve in this paper an optimal control problem for changing the control parameters of a discrete-state far-from-equilibrium process from an initial to a final value in finite-time. Optimal driving protocols are derived that minimize the total finite-time dissipation cost for the driving process. Our framework reveals that discontinuous endpoint jumps are a generic, model-independent physical mechanism that minimizes the optimal driving entropy production, whose importance is further amplified for far-from-equilibrium systems. The thermodynamic and dynamic physical interpretation and understanding of discontinuous endpoint jumps is formulated. An exact mapping between the finite-time to slow driving optimal control formulation is elucidated, developing the state-of-the-art of optimal mass transport theory and thermodynamic geometry, which has been the current paradigm for studying optimal processes in stochastic thermodynamics that relies on slow driving assumptions. Our framework opens up a plethora of applications to the thermodynamically efficient control of a far-from-equilibrium system in finite-time, which opens up a way to their efficient design principles.

Title: Intrinsic Moiré Higher-Order Topology Beyond Effective Moiré Lattice Models
Authors: Xianliang Zhou, Yifan Gao, Laiyuan Su, Z. F. Wang, Li Huang, Angel Rubio, Zhiwen Shi, Lede Xian
Abstract: Moiré superlattices provide a compelling platform for exploring exotic correlated physics. Electronic interference within these systems often results in flat bands with localized electrons, which are typically described by effective moiré lattice models. While conventional models treat moiré sites as indivisible, analogous to atoms in a crystal, this picture overlooks a crucial distinction: unlike a true atom, a moiré site is composed of tens to thousands of atoms and is therefore spatially divisible. Here, we introduce a universal mechanism rooted in this spatial divisibility to create topological boundary states in moiré materials. Through tight-binding and density functional theory calculations, we demonstrate that cutting a moiré site with a physical boundary induces bulk topological polarization, generating robust boundary states with fractional charges. We further show that when the net edge polarization is canceled, this mechanism drives the system into an intrinsic moiré higher-order topological insulator (mHOTI) phase. As a concrete realization, we predict that twisted bilayer tungsten disulfide ($WS_2$) is a robust mHOTI with experimentally detectable corner states when its boundaries cut through moiré hole sites. Our findings generalize the theoretical framework of moiré higher-order topology, highlight the critical role of edge terminations, and suggest new opportunities for realizing correlated HOTIs and higher-order superconductivity in moiré platforms.

Title: Polaronic-Distortion-Driven Enhancement of Excitonic Auger Recombination in ZnO Nanoparticles
Authors: Fuyong Hua, Zheng Zhang, Zhong Wang, Yang Liu, Changchang Gong, Chunlong Hu, Yinhua Zhou, Wenxi Liang
Abstract: The surface effect and quantum confinement render nanomaterials the optoelectronic properties more susceptible to nonradiative processes than their bulk counterparts. These nonradiative processes usually contain a series of interwoven and competing sub-processes, which are challenging to disentangle. Here, we investigate the structural origin of Auger recombination in ZnO nanoparticles using transient absorption spectroscopy and ultrafast electron diffraction. The photogenerated hot holes are captured by oxygen vacancies through an Auger mechanism, inducing significant local structural distortions around the oxygen vacancy and its neighboring zinc tetrahedron on a sub-picosecond timescale. The recombination of trapped holes accelerates the lattice thermalization and stabilizes the formed small hole polarons. Subsequently, the recombination of localized polarons forms a confined exciton-polaron complex that may account for the long-lived (>7 ns) visible luminescence observed in ZnO nanoparticles. Our findings are potentially applicable to other transition metal oxide nanomaterials, bringing insights for the optimization of their functional properties.

Title: Superlinear Hall angle and carrier mobility from non-Boltzmann magnetotransport in the spatially disordered Yukawa-SYK model on a square lattice
Authors: Davide Valentinis, Jörg Schmalian, Subir Sachdev, Aavishkar A. Patel
Abstract: Exact numerical results for the DC magnetoconductivity tensor of the two-dimensional spatially disordered Yukawa-Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (2D-YSYK) model on a square lattice, at first order in applied perpendicular magnetic field, are obtained from the self-consistent disorder-averaged solution of the 2D-YSYK saddle-point equations. This system describes fermions endowed with a Fermi surface and coupled to a bosonic scalar field through spatially random Yukawa interactions. The resulting local and energy-dependent fermionic self-energies are employed in the Kubo formalism to calculate the longitudinal and Hall conductivities, the Hall coefficient, the carrier mobility, and the cotangent of the Hall angle, at fixed fermion density. From the interplay between YSYK interactions and square-lattice embedding, and the non-Boltzmann frequency-dependent self energies, we find nontrivial evolution of the magnetotransport coefficients as a function of temperature and YSYK interaction strength, notably a superlinear evolution of the Hall-angle cotangent and the inverse carrier mobility with temperature, concomitant with linear-in-temperature resistivity, in an extended crossover regime above the low-temperature Marginal Fermi Liquid (MFL) ground state. Our model and results provide a controlled theoretical framework to interpret linear magnetotransport experiments in strange-metal phases found in strongly correlated solid-state electron systems.

Title: Improved contraction of finite projected entangled pair states
Authors: Markus Scheb
Abstract: We present an improved version of the algorithm contracting and optimizing finite projected entangled pair states (fPEPS) in conjunction with projected entangled pair operators (PEPOs). Our work has two components to it. First, we explain in detail the characteristic contraction patterns that occur in fPEPS calculations and how to slice them such that peak memory occupation remains minimal while ensuring efficient parallel computation. Second, we combine controlled bond expansion [A. Gleis, J.-W. Li, and J. von Delft, Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 246402 (2023)] with randomized singular value decomposition [V. Rokhlin, A. Szlam, and M. Tygert, SIAM J. Matrix Anal. Appl. (2009)] and apply it throughout the fPEPS algorithm. We present benchmark results for the Hubbard model for system sizes up to 8x8 and SU(2) symmetric bond dimension of up to D = 6 for PEPS bonds and $\chi$ = 500 for the environment bonds. Finally, we comment on the state and future of the fPEPS-PEPO framework.

Title: Non Fermi-Liquid Magnetoresistance Oscillations in Quasi-One-Dimensional Conductors
Authors: Andrei G. Lebed
Abstract: We theoretically demonstrate that strong non Fermi-liquid magnetic oscillations of electron-electron scattering time can exist in quasi-one-dimensional (Q1D) conductors under condition of the magnetic breakdown between two open electron orbits. They are shown to be due to electron-electron interactions in a metallic phase under condition of the magnetic breakdown and they are beyond the Fermi-liquid theory. In particular, we consider as example the organic conductor (TMTSF)$_2$ClO$_4$ and perform both analytical and numerical calculations for its known electron spectrum. We also argue that similar oscillations of resistivity can exist in a metallic phase of another Q1D organic conductor - (Per)$_2$Au(mnt)$_2$.

Title: Strongly Forbidden Thermodynamic Oscillations in Quasi-One-Dimensional Conductors
Authors: Andrei G. Lebed
Abstract: We theoretically show that strongly forbidden oscillations of a specific heat have to exist in metallic phases of some quasi-one-dimensional (Q1D) conductors. They appear due to electron-electron interactions under condition of the magnetic breakdown phenomenon between the so-called open interference electron orbits. We argue that such forbidden thermodynamic oscillations can exist in Q1D conductors (TMTSF)$_2$ClO$_4$ and (Per)$_2$Au(mnt)$_2$, where TMTSF stands for tetramethyltetraselenafulvalene, Per is polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon and mnt is mononitrotoluene, and suggest to discover them.

Title: Domain Morphology, Electrocaloric Response, and Negative Capacitance States of Ferroelectric Nanowires Array
Authors: Anna N. Morozovska, Oleksii V. Bereznykov, Maksym V. Strikha, Oleksandr S. Pylypchuk, Zdravko Kutnjak, Eugene A. Eliseev, Dean R. Evans
Abstract: We analyzed the domain morphology, electrocaloric response, and negative capacitance states in a one-dimensional array of uniformly oriented, radial symmetric ferroelectric nanowires, whose spontaneous polarization is normal to their symmetry axis. The wires are densely packed between flat electrodes. Using finite element modeling based on the Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire approach, electrostatics, and elasticity theory, we calculated the distributions of spontaneous polarization, domain structures, electric potential, electric field, dielectric permittivity, and electrocaloric response in the nanowires. Due to size and depolarization effects, the paraelectric and ferroelectric (poly-domain or single-domain) states of the wires can be stable, depending on their radius and the dielectric permittivity of the surrounding medium. It is demonstrated that dipole-dipole interaction between the nanowires determines the stability of the polar (or anti-polar) state in the array when the wire radius is significantly smaller than the critical size of the paraelectric transition in an isolated wire. We reveal that a large region of a mixed state, characterized by poly-domain ferroelectric states with nonzero average polarization inside each wire and zero average polarization of the whole array, can be stable. By selecting the dielectric permittivity of the surrounding medium and the nanowire radius, one can maximize the negative capacitance effect in the capacitor with densely packed wires. It is also possible to achieve maximal enhancement of the electrocaloric response due to size effects in the wires. The underlying physics of the predicted enhancement is the combined action of size effects and the long-range electrostatic interactions between the ferroelectric dipoles in the nanowires and the image charges in the electrodes

Title: Exposing Altermagnetism through Momentum Density Spectroscopy
Authors: Wenhan Chen, Alyn D. N. James, Stephen B. Dugdale
Abstract: Materials which show a strong time-reversal symmetry-breaking response leading to spin-polarization phenomena, in conjunction with antiparallel magnetic alignments producing zero net magnetization, have recently been identified, classified, and been given the name 'altermagnets'. However, measuring and diagnosing possible candidates as altermagnetics still remains a challenge. From the uncertainty of the material being an altermagnet, additional experimental probes are essential to resolve this. Here, we propose using spin-dependent and magnetic momentum density probes such as spin-polarised positron annihilation and revisiting magnetic Compton scattering. By looking at the previously claimed altermagnetic candidates RuO2, CrSb and MnTe, we present theoretical altermagnetic calculations of the experimental quantities measured by these probes. We show that these quantities should produce a measurable signal and unequivocally confirm the altermagnetic state. We also highlight the additional benefits from these probes such as extracting spin-resolved Fermi surfaces which are key for further understanding the nature of the altermagnetic state.

Title: Machine learning descriptors for predicting the high temperature oxidation of refractory complex concentrated alloys
Authors: Akhil Bejjipurapu, Alejandro Strachan, Kenneth H. Sandhage, Michael S. Titus
Abstract: Refractory Complex Concentrated Alloys (RCCAs) can exhibit exceptional high-temperature strength, making such alloys promising candidates for high-temperature structural applications. However, current RCCAs do not possess the high-temperature oxidation resistance required to survive in oxidizing environments for more than a few hours at or above 1000$^\circ$C, without relying primarily on an environmental barrier coating. Here, we present a machine-learning framework designed to predict the oxidation-induced specific mass changes of RCCAs exposed for 24 h at 1000$^\circ$C in air, in order to support the search for oxidation-resistant alloys over a wide range of compositions. A database was constructed of experimental specific mass change data, upon oxidation at 900-1000$^\circ$C for 24 h in air, for 77 compositions comprised of simple elements, binary alloys, and higher-order elemental systems. We then developed a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model with physics-informed descriptors based on oxidation products, capturing the fundamental chemistry of oxide formation and stability. Application of this GPR model to the database yielded a MAE (mean absolute error) test score of 5.78 mg/cm$^2$, which was a significant improvement in accuracy relative to models only utilizing traditional alloy-based descriptors. Our model was used to screen over 5,100 quaternary RCCAs, revealing compositions with significantly lower predicted specific mass changes compared to existing literature sources. Overall, this work establishes a versatile and efficient strategy to accelerate the discovery of next-generation RCCAs with enhanced resistance to extreme environments.

Title: Glass Patterns in Twisted Disordered Crystals
Authors: Aaron Dunbrack
Abstract: Twisting and stacking two copies of a 2D crystal can produce a long-wavelength periodic interference pattern known as a moiré pattern. Performing the same procedure with an aperiodic structure instead generates a single moiré spot at the rotation center, known as a Glass pattern. We explore the implications of these patterns across a variety of models: they allow measurement of microscopic parameters from mesoscopic resistivity measurements; they generate an impurity that modifies the properties of a moiré lattice at the rotation center; and they allow for domain formation in amorphous magnets. These results establish Glass patterns as a generic feature of twisted disordered systems and provide a framework for future theoretical and experimental exploration.

Title: Generative Machine Learning Models for the Deconvolution of Charge Carrier Dynamics in Organic Photovoltaic Cells
Authors: Li Raymond, Salim Flora, Wang Sijin, Wright Brendan
Abstract: Charge carrier dynamics critically affect the efficiency and stability of organic photovoltaic devices, but they are challenging to model with traditional analytical methods. We introduce \b{eta}-Linearly Decoded Latent Ordinary Differential Equations (\b{eta}-LLODE), a machine learning framework that disentangles and reconstructs extraction dynamics from time-resolved charge extraction measurements of P3HT:PCBM cells. This model enables the isolated analysis of the underlying charge carrier behaviour, which was found to be well described by a compressed exponential decay. Furthermore, the learnt interpretable latent space enables simulation, including both interpolation and extrapolation of experimental measurement conditions, offering a predictive tool for solar cell research to support device study and optimisation.

Title: Outstanding figure of merit at high temperature for DFT-based predicted double perovskite oxides, Ba2GaXO6 (X = V, Nb, Ta)
Authors: S. S. Saif, M. M. Hossain, M. A. Ali
Abstract: Thermoelectric materials with a high figure of merit (ZT) are highly demanded for a sustainable solution to the energy crisis. In this study, we have predicted three new double perovskite oxides (DPOs), Ba2GaXO6 (X = V, Nb, Ta), with high ZT values using density functional theory (DFT) calculations and investigated their structural, electronic, thermoelectric, and mechanical properties. The electronic properties, such as electronic band structure, density of states (DOS), and charge density mapping, are used to disclose the conductive nature, chemical bonding within these compounds, which exhibit direct band gaps of 0.924, 2.354, and 3.279 eV for Ba2GaVO6, Ba2GaNbO6, and Ba2GaTaO6, respectively, as calculated using the TB mBJ potential. The thermoelectric performance of the new DPOs, Ba2GaXO6 (X = V, Nb, Ta), was assessed using the BoltzTrap2 code, which yielded outstanding ZT values of 2.36, 1.78, and 1.91 at 1500 K for Ba2GaVO6, Ba2GaNbO6, and Ba2GaTaO6, respectively, indicating their potential for waste heat management. The high ZT values are attributed to an ultra low lattice thermal conductivity, arising from strong scattering of acoustic and optical phonon modes. The changes in thermoelectric parameters with temperature were analyzed and explained.

Title: A nonequilibrium quantum Otto engine enhanced via multi-parameter control
Authors: Raymon S. Watson, Karen V. Kheruntsyan
Abstract: Advances in experimental control of interacting quantum many-body systems with multiple tunable parameters--such as ultracold atomic gases and trapped ions--are driving rapid progress in quantum thermodynamics and enabling the design of quantum thermal machines. In this work, we utilize a sudden quench approximation as a means to investigate the operation of a quantum thermodynamic Otto cycle in which multiple parameters are simultaneously controllable. The method applies universally to many-body systems where such control is available, and therefore provides general principles for investigating their operation as a working medium in quantum thermal machines. We investigate application of this multi-parameter quench protocol in an experimentally realistic one-dimensional Bose gas as the working fluid, with control over both the frequency of an external harmonic trap and the interparticle interaction strength. We derive a general inequality for the net work of this two-parameter Otto cycle, demonstrating that this protocol out-performs its constituent single-parameter Otto cycles when operating as an engine, and additionally implying an enhancement to the coefficient of performance when operating as a refrigerator. Further, we demonstrate that multi-parameter control can exhibit dramatically improved performance of the Otto engine when compared not only to single-parameter constituent quenches but also to the combined effect of its constituent engine cycles.

Title: Novel $H_{\rm c2}$ suppression mechanism in a spin triplet superconductor -- Application to UTe$_2$--
Authors: Kazushige Machida
Abstract: A novel $H_{\rm c2}$ suppression mechanism is theoretically proposed in a spin triplet superconductor (SC) with equal spin pairs. We show that the upper critical field $H_{\rm c2}$ can be reduced from the orbital depairing limit $H^{\rm orb}_{\rm c2}$ to arbitrarily small value, keeping the second order phase transition nature. This mechanism is sharply different from the known Pauli-Clogston limit for a spin singlet SC where the reduction is limited to $\sim$0.3$H^{\rm orb}_{\rm c2}$ with the first order transition when the Maki parameter goes infinity. This novel $H_{\rm c2}$ suppression mechanism is applied to UTe$_2$, which is a prime candidate for a spin triplet SC, to successfully analyze the $H_{\rm c2}$ data for various crystalline orientations both under ambient and applied pressure, and to identify the pairing symmetry. It is concluded that the non-unitary spin triplet state with equal spin pairs is realized in UTe$_2$, namely $(\hat b+i\hat c)k_a$ in $^3$B$_{\rm 3u}$ which is classified under finite spin orbit coupling scheme.

Title: Parastatistics revealed: Peierls phase twists and shifted conformal towers in interacting periodic chains
Authors: D. Schuricht, J. Sirker
Abstract: We consider interacting paraparticle chains with a constant $R$-matrix where the Hamiltonian sums over the internal degrees (flavors) of the paraparticles. For such flavor-blind Hamiltonians we show a general factorization of the Hilbert space into occupation and flavor parts with the Hamiltonian acting non-trivially only on the former. For open boundaries, the spectrum therefore coincides with that of the occupation Hamiltonian $H_{\rm occ}$ with the flavor part merely adding degeneracies. For periodic boundaries, a cyclic reordering of the flavors leads to a separation of $H_{\rm occ}$ into flux sectors at fixed particle number, thus making the parastatistics directly observable in the energy spectrum. For important exemplary cases, $H_{\rm occ}$ reduces to the XXZ chain with flux allowing for an exact solution. In the gapless regime, this solution shows flux-shifted $c=1$ conformal towers in the low-energy spectrum and a temperature-dependent chemical potential in the bulk thermodynamics.

Title: Interference dislocations adjacent to emission spot
Authors: J. R. Leonard, L. H. Fowler-Gerace, Zhiwen Zhou, E. A. Szwed, D. J. Choksy, L. V. Butov
Abstract: We studied interference dislocations (forks) adjacent to an emission spot in an interference pattern. The adjacent interference dislocations are observed in emission of excitons in a monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide and in emission of spatially indirect excitons, also known as interlayer excitons, in a van der Waals heterostructure. The simulations show that the adjacent interference dislocations appear due to the moiré effect in combined interference patterns produced by constituting parts of the emission spot. The adjacent interference dislocations can appear in interference images for various spatially modulated emission patterns.

Authors: Yujie Zhu, Jiaxuan Wu, Anna N. Morozovska, Eugene A. Eliseev, Yulian M. Vysochanskii, Venkatraman Gopalan, Long-Qing Chen, Xufeng Zhang, Wei Zhang, Jia-Mian Hu
Abstract: Coherent ferrons, the quanta of polarization waves, can potentially be hybridized with many other quasiparticles for achieving novel control modalities in quantum communication, computing, and sensing. Here, we theoretically demonstrate a new hybridized state resulting from the strong coupling between fundamental-mode (wavenumber is zero) coherent ferrons and cavity bulk acoustic phonons. Using a van der Waals ferroelectric CuInP2S6 membrane as an example, we predict an ultra-strong ferron-phonon coupling at room temperature, where the coupling strength g_c reaches over 10% of the resonant frequency {\omega}_0. We also predict an in-situ electric-field-driven bistable control of mode-specific ferron-phonon hybridization via ferroelectric switching. We further show that, CuInP2S6 allows for reaching the fundamentally intriguing but challenging deep strong coupling regime (i.e., g_c/{\omega}_0>1) near the ferroelectric-to-paraelectric phase transition. Our findings establish the theoretical basis for exploiting coherent ferrons as a new contender for hybrid quantum system with strong and highly tunable coherent coupling.

Title: Modulation of Quantum Transport in Complex Oxide Heterostructures with Proton Implantation
Authors: Haidong Liang, Ganesh Ji Omar, Kun Han, Andrew A. Bettiol, Zhen Huang, A. Ariando
Abstract: The interfacial electronic properties of complex oxides are governed by a delicate balance between charge transfer, lattice distortions, and electronic correlations, posing a key challenge for controlled tunability in materials research. Here, we demonstrate that proton implantation serves as a precise tool for modulating interfacial transport in SrTiO3-based heterostructures. By introducing protons into the SrTiO3 substrate beneath an amorphous (La,Sr)(Al,Ta)O3 capping layer, we uncover a competition between disorder and charge doping induced by implantation. At low implantation fluences below 1x1015 protons/cm2 (1E15), charge doping dominates, leading to an increase in carrier density and mobility, analogous to electrostatic gating effect. This enables the emergence of quantum transport oscillations at low temperature. Conversely, at higher fluences (above 1E15), disorder scattering prevails, suppressing carrier mobility and inducing an insulating state. The nonmonotonic evolution of transport with implantation fluence underscores the critical interplay between electronic correlations and disorder, offering a new paradigm for the controlled engineering of interfacial quantum states in SrTiO3-based oxide heterostructures.

Title: Rheological Behavior of Colloidal Silica Dispersion: Irreversible Aging and Thixotropy
Authors: Vivek Kumar, Yogesh M. Joshi
Abstract: In this work, we study the rheological behavior of colloidal dispersion of charge-screened nanoparticles of silica suspended in aqueous media that exhibits soft solid-like consistency. We observe that the system shows various characteristics of physical aging wherein it undergoes time evolution of rheological properties such as elastic modulus, relaxation time, and yield stress subsequent to shear melting of the same. Notably, the relaxation time increases more strongly than linearly with time, which is suggestive of hyper-aging dynamics. When considered along with the time-dependent yield stress, this behavior indicates the steady state shear stress-shear rate flow curve to be non-monotonic with a negative slope in a lower shear rate region. Performing shear melting on this system at a later date since the preparation of the dispersion (rest time) results in higher viscosity as well as yield stress, and the corresponding evolution of the elastic modulus shifts to lower times. This implies that physical aging in studied silica dispersion, while reversible over short time scales (of the order of hours), becomes irreversible over longer durations (days) owing to the inability of strong shear to break interparticle bonds that have strengthened over long durations. We also develop a thixotropic structural kinetic model within a time-dependent Maxwell framework that captures the experimentally observed rheological behavior well.

Title: Interaction of moire-induced quantum Hall channels in a locally gated graphene junction
Authors: Won Beom Choi, Myungjin Jeon, K. Watanabe, T. Taniguchi, Joonho Jang
Abstract: Manipulating electron quantum 1D channels is an important element in the field of quantum information due to their ballistic and phase coherence properties. In GaAs and graphene based two dimensional gas systems, these edge channels have been investigated with both integer and fractional quantum Hall effects, contributing to the realization of electron interferometer and anyon braiding. Often, at the p-n junction in the quantum Hall (QH) regime, the presence of a depletion region due to a band gap or the formation of gaps between the zeroth Landau levels (zLL) suppresses interaction between the co-propagating edge channels of opposing doping regimes and helps to preserve the phase coherence of the channels. Here, we observe a new type of p-n junction in hexagonal boron nitride aligned graphene that lacks both the zLL and band gap. In this system, a van Hove singularity (vHS) emerges at the p-n junctions under magnetic fields of several Tesla, owing to the doping inversion near the secondary Dirac point. By fabricating devices with independently tunable global bottom and local top gates, we enable the study of interactions between p-type and n-type QH edge channels through magnetic breakdown associated with the vHS. These findings provide valuable insights into the interactions of superlattice-induced QH edge channels in hBN-aligned graphene.

Title: Orbital magnetization in the Nb-substituted Kagome metal CsV$_3$Sb$_5$

Abstract: This study uses angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to examine the low-temperature electronic structure of Cs(V$_{0.95}$Nb$_{0.05}$)$_3$Sb$_5$, demonstrating that partially substituting V atoms with isoelectronic Nb atoms results in \blue{an increase of the band width} and enhanced gap opening at the Dirac-like crossings due to the resulting chemical pressure. This increases the magnetic circular dichroism signal in the angular distribution (MCDAD) compared to CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, enabling detailed analysis of magnetic circular dichroism in several bands near the Fermi level. These results \blue{substantiate} the predicted coupling of orbital magnetic moments to three van Hove singularities near the Fermi level at M points. Previous studies have observed that Nb doping \blue{lowers the charge density transition temperature} and increases the critical temperature for superconductivity. This article demonstrates that Nb doping concomitantly increases the magnetic circular dichroism signal attributed to orbital moments.

Title: Switchable Polarization in an A-site Deficient Perovskite through Vacancy and Cation Engineering
Authors: Suguru Yoshida, Olivier Hernandez, Jinsuke Miyake, Kei Nakayama, Ryo Ishikawa, Hajime Hojo, Yuichi Ikuhara, Venkatraman Gopalan, Katsuhisa Tanaka, Koji Fujita
Abstract: While defects are unavoidable in crystals and often detrimental to material performance, they can be a key ingredient for inducing functionalities when tailored. Here, we demonstrate that an A-site-deficient perovskite Y$_{1/3}$TaO$_3$ exhibits room-temperature ferroelectricity in a $Pb2_1m$ phase, enabled by ordered vacancies coupled with TaO$_6$ octahedral rotations. Defect-ordered perovskites are frequently trapped in centrosymmetric incommensurate states due to competing structural instabilities; we circumvent this by favoring rotational over polar instability through compositional selection. Unlike canonical improper ferroelectrics that are \textit{ferrielectric}, the vanishing dipoles on vacancy layers in Y$_{1/3}$TaO$_3$ allow for a net ferroelectric alignment of local dipoles, resulting in enhanced polarization. Upon heating, Y$_{1/3}$TaO$_3$ transforms to a paraelectric incommensurate phase at $\simeq$750 K, whose atomic arrangement mirrors the domain topology observed in hybrid improper ferroelectrics. Superspace analysis of the modulated phase reveals a route to improve room-temperature polarization, achieved through epitaxial strain, as confirmed by our lattice-dynamics calculations. This defect-ordering strategy should be generalizable to other improper ferroelectrics, including magnetoelectric multiferroics, providing a pathway to amplify otherwise limited macroscopic polarization.

Title: Local thermodynamic DOS measurement and twist-angle mapping in graphene-hBN superlattices
Authors: Namkyung Lee, Hangyeol Park, Seungwon Jung, Baeksan Jang, Seonyu Lee, Joonho Jang
Abstract: Moiré patterns arising from twisted van der Waals stacks fundamentally reshape their electronic properties, enabling band-structure engineering that has driven rapidly growing interest in this field. In studying electronic properties, however, structural disorder present in real devices often leads to twist-angle inhomogeneity and obscures angle-dependent electronic effects when measured with bulk-averaged measurements. Probes that can access local thermodynamic response of the electronic systems with high sensitivity would be highly valuable. Here, we adopt Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) to locally investigate graphene-hBN superlattices. By additionally modulating the chemical potential of the system, we obtain the inverse compressibility with high signal-to-noise ratio, enabling extraction of the local thermodynamic DOS. From this information, we determine the local twist angle along the device and find that twist-angle deviations are strongly correlated with bubble-induced strain features. Furthermore, by simultaneously tracking the offsets in the contact potential difference and in the net charge, we identify which interface within the heterostructure hosts the trapped bubbles. This capability to identify local electro-chemical environments provides a practical tool for strain-based studies and future device designs utilizing nanoscale engineering in moiré systems.

Title: Large-Area Atomically Flat Monocrystalline Gold Flakes: Recent Advances, Applications, and Future Potential
Authors: Amro O. Sweedan, Kefan Zhang, Muhammad Y. Bashouti, Thorsten Feichtner
Abstract: High aspect ratio oblate polygonal gold crystals - such as triangular and hexagonal platelets - have attracted considerable interest due to their extraordinary physical, chemical, and mechanical properties. Commonly referred to as "gold flakes," these structures exhibit atomically flat surfaces, $\mu$m$^2$ areas with nanometric thickness, and a monocrystalline morphology. Since their first discovery by John Turkevich in 1951, considerable progress has been made in shape-controlled synthesis and large-scale production, unlocking steadily new opportunities for ever more advanced applications. This review explores large-area gold flakes with lateral dimensions spanning from hundreds of nanometers to millimeters, emphasizing their unique properties. We provide a comprehensive overview of key developments, from early discoveries, synthesis approaches, and fabrication techniques to recent breakthroughs. Emphasis is placed on the integration of gold flake as functional building blocks in photonics (e.g., for nanoantennas), sensing, nanoelectronics, biomedicine, and beyond. We conclude with a discussion of emerging roles and future developments of this unique class of materials.

Title: Robust structural superlubricity of twisted graphene bilayer and domain walls between commensurate moiré pattern domains from first-principles calculations
Authors: Irina V. Lebedeva, Andrey M. Popov, Yulia G. Polynskaya, Andrey A. Knizhnik, Sergey A. Vyrko, Nikolai A. Poklonski
Abstract: Twisted graphene layers exhibit extremely low friction for relative sliding. Nevertheless, previous studies suggest that the area contribution to friction for commensurate moiré systems is finite and might restrict macroscopic superlubricity for large layer overlaps. In this paper, we investigate the potential energy surface (PES) for relative displacement of the layers forming moiré patterns (2,1) and (3,1) by accurate density functional theory calculations using the vdW-DF3 functional. The amplitudes of PES corrugations on the order of 0.4 and 0.03 $\mu$eV per atom of one layer, respectively, are obtained. The account of structural relaxation doubles this value for the (2,1) pattern, while causing only minimal changes for the (3,1) pattern. We show that different from aligned graphene layers, for moiré patterns, PES minima and maxima can switch their positions upon changing the interlayer distance. The PES shape is closely described by the first spatial Fourier harmonics both with and without account of structural relaxation. A barrier for relative rotation of the layers to an incommensurate state that can make superlubricity robust is estimated based on the approximated PES. We also derive a set of measurable physical properties related to interlayer interaction including shear mode frequency, shear modulus and static friction force. Furthermore, we predict that it should be possible to observe domain walls separating commensurate domains, each comprising a large number of moiré pattern unit cells, and provide estimates of their characteristics.

Title: Experimental signature of transient symmetry breaking in a cavity superconductor
Authors: Siyu Duan, Jingbo Wu, Xiaoqing Jia, Huabing Wang, Ilya M. Eremin, Götz S. Uhrig, Biaobing Jin, Zhe Wang
Abstract: Transient states of matter far from equilibrium may exhibit physical properties beyond those allowed by the equilibrium-state crystalline symmetries. We explore ultrafast and direct electronic excitations of transient states in a cavity superconductor by using time-resolved terahertz-pump terahertz-probe spectroscopy. Our results show that the strong terahertz field can transiently modify the symmetries of the electronic subsystems via the injection of a transient supercurrent, leading to high-order nonlinear dynamical responses that are not compatible with the equilibrium-state symmetries, which evidences for transient symmetry breaking on the picosecond time scale. Our study also finds that the strong coupling of the superconductor to the designed microcavities enables the sensitive detection of the nonlinear responses associated to the transient symmetry breaking.

Title: Intertwined Hyperferroelectricity, Tunable Multiple Topological Phases and Giant Rashba Effect in Wurtzite LiZnAs
Authors: Saurav Patel, Paras Patel, Shaohui Qiu, Prafulla K. Jha
Abstract: Composite quantum compounds offer a fertile ground for uncovering the complex interrelations between seemingly distinct phenomena in condensed matter physics for advanced nonvolatile and spintronics applications. Beyond topological superconductors and axion insulators, the idea of intertwined Hyperferroelectricity (HyFE), multiple topological phases and Rashba spin-splitting with reversible spin textures represents the local, global and symmetry-driven characteristics of quantum materials, respectively, offering unique pathways for enhanced functionalities. We unveiled a unified framework to achieve this synergy through the presence of crystalline symmetries and spin-orbit coupling in LiZnAs compound using first-principles calculations. HyFE exhibits ability to maintain spontaneous polarization under open-circuit boundary conditions, even with existence of depolarization field while Rashba effect exhibits paradigmatic spin texture in momentum space with tangential vector field. The presence of unstable $A_{2u}(LO)$ mode leads to free energy minimum with significant well depth and polarization of -66 meV and $P_{HyFE} = 0.282~C/m^2$, respectively indicating stable HyFE. The robust HyFE stem from mode-specific effective charges and larger high-frequency dielectric constants. This study also addresses the subtle question of whether critical point of topological phase transition shifts in response to drastically different Rashba spin-splitting values obtained from VASP and WIEN2k. Moreover, biaxial strain (BAS) induced Weyl semimetal (at 3.4% BAS) and topological insulating phase (after 3.4% BAS) is observed with giant Rashba coefficient of 5.91 eV Å and 2.42 eV Å, respectively. Furthermore, switching of bulk polarization leads to spin texture reversal, providing a robust mechanism to leverage spin degrees of freedom in these Hyperferroelectric Rashba topological materials.

Title: Building granular structures with elasto-active systems
Authors: Yuchen Xi, Tom Marzin, P.-T. Brun
Abstract: Natural active systems routinely reshape and reorganize their environments through sustained local interactions. Examples of decentralized collective construction are common in nature, e.g., many insects achieve large-scale constructions through indirect communication. While synthetic realizations of self-organization exist, they typically rely on rigid agents that require some kind of sensors and direct programming to achieve their function. Understanding how soft, deformable active matter navigates and remodels crowded landscapes remains an open challenge. Here we show that connecting rigid microbots to elastic beams yields elasto-active structures that can restructure and adapt to heterogeneous surroundings. We investigate the dynamics of these agents in environments with varying granular densities, rationalizing how they can aggregate or carve the medium through gentle interactions. At low density, the system compacts dispersed obstacles into clusters, a process modeled by a modified Smoluchowski coagulation theory. At high density, our agents carve voids whose size is predicted by a force-limited argument. These results establish a framework for understanding how activity, elasticity, and deformability can influence active navigation and environmental reconfiguration in granular media.

Title: Low-field magnetization processes of hexagonal easy-plane altermagnet $α$-MnTe
Authors: Sahana Rößler, Victoria Ginga, Marcus Schmidt, Yurii Prots, Helge Rosner, Ulrich Burkhardt, Ulrich K. Rößler, Alexander A. Tsirlin
Abstract: Single crystals of $\alpha$-MnTe were synthesized by chemical vapor transport using iodine as the transport reagent. Structural characterization by powder x-ray diffraction confirmed the hexagonal structure (space group P6$_{3}$/mmc). Magnetization $M(T)$ and specific heat $C_p(T)$ measurements revealed an antiferromagnetic phase transition at $T_N \approx307$ K. The magnetic entropy derived from the $C_p(T)$ data is consistent with the $S = 5/2$ spin state of Mn$^{2+}$ ions. Angle- and field-dependent magnetization measurements indicate complex magnetic responses associated with domains, and show an anomaly around 1 T. These features are analyzed using a phenomenological micromagnetic model that includes higher-order anisotropic exchange interactions coupling the weak ferromagnetic component and the antiferromagnetic order parameter. The model captures the generic behavior of magnetic states and demonstrates that the observed uniaxial and unidirectional anisotropies arise from metastable domain configurations and irreversible magnetization processes.

Title: Raman Spectroscopy Insights into the Reorientational Dynamics of Polyanions in Solid Electrolytes
Authors: Jianghai Chen, Yu Yang, Ya Tang, Hong Zhu, Wenqian Chen
Abstract: The interaction between cation diffusion and polyanion rotational dynamics has garnered significant attention, yet characterizing the rotational dynamics of polyanions remains challenging. Previous studies have primarily relied on complex techniques such as Nuclear Magnetic Resonance and Quasi-Elastic Neutron Scattering. In this work, we use ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations and temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy to investigate the reorientational dynamics of the NO2- polyanion in Na3ONO2 and NaNO2. Our findings reveal distinct reorientational behaviors and establish a clear correlation between molecular reorientation and Raman spectral features in polyanion-based solid electrolytes. AIMD simulations show that NO2- rotates easily in Na3ONO2, while its rotational dynamics are hindered in NaNO2. Raman spectroscopy confirms these results, with temperature-dependent shifts in the internal vibrational modes of the polyanion. In Na3ONO2, the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of these modes increases with temperature, while NaNO2 exhibits a constant FWHM until a significant jump at the ordered-disordered phase transition. These insights enhance our understanding of polyanion reorientation and offer a framework for characterizing similar dynamics in other solid electrolytes.

Title: Pd/Cu single atom alloys for catalysis: from single crystalline to nanostructured model systems for highly selective butanol dehydrogenation
Authors: Philipp Haugg, Jan Smyczek, Carsten Schröder, Paul Fröhlich, Paul Kohlmorgen, Stephan Appelfeller, Konstantin Neyman, Swetlana Schauermann
Abstract: Heterogeneous catalysts based on Single Atom Alloys (SAA) play a significant role in numerous technical processes. The fundamental working principles of these systems, however, remain poorly understood, especially the aspects related to the nanoscopic nature of bimetallic particles and the associated structure-reactivity relationships. In this study, we developed for the first time well-defined SAA catalysts consisting of Pd atomically dispersed in Cu nanoparticles prepared under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions on model Al2O3/NiAl(110) support. Employing a unique combination of surface sensitive techniques - scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRAS), molecular beams - and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we performed detailed structural characterization of these systems at the microscopic level. We demonstrate that Pd disperses atomically in Cu nanoparticles and becomes partly negatively charged. Importantly, these Pd/Cu nanostructured systems show an outstanding catalytic performance in selective dehydrogenation of butanol and exhibit 100 % selectivity toward butanal over a broad range of Pd loadings - the property that cannot be reproduced employing simplified single crystalline Pd/Cu(111) counterparts. The developed approach for preparation and characterization of these nanostructured SAA-catalysts lays a foundation for further fundamental-level catalytic studies on this important class of materials and their rational design for practical applications.

Abstract: We introduce an automated workflow for generating non-empirical Wannier-localized optimally-tuned screened range-separated hybrid (WOT-SRSH) functionals. WOT-SRSH functionals have been shown to yield highly accurate fundamental band gaps, band structures, and optical spectra for bulk and 2D semiconductors and insulators. Our workflow automatically and efficiently determines the WOT-SRSH functional parameters for a given crystal structure and composition, approximately enforcing the correct screened long-range Coulomb interaction and an ionization potential ansatz. In contrast to previous manual tuning approaches, our tuning procedure relies on a new search algorithm that only requires a few hybrid functional calculations with minimal user input. We demonstrate our workflow on 23 previously studied semiconductors and insulators, reporting the same high level of accuracy. By automating the tuning process and improving its computational efficiency, the approach outlined here enables applications of the WOT-SRSH functional to compute spectroscopic and optoelectronic properties for a wide range of materials.

Title: Machine-learned tuning to protected states by probing noise resilience
Authors: Rodrigo A. Dourado, Nicolás Martínez-Valero, Jacob Benestad, Martin Leijnse, Jeroen Danon, Rubén Seoane Souto
Abstract: Protected states are promising for quantum technologies due to their intrinsic resilience against noise. However, such states often emerge at discrete points or small regions in parameter space and are thus difficult to find in experiments. In this work, we present a machine-learning method for tuning to protected regimes, based on injecting noise into the system and searching directly for the most noise-resilient configuration. We illustrate this method by considering short quantum dot-based Kitaev chains which we subject to random parameter fluctuations. Using the covariance matrix adaptation evolutionary strategy we minimize the typical resulting ground state splitting, which makes the system converge to a protected configuration with well-separated Majorana bound states. We verify the robustness of our method by considering finite Zeeman fields, electron-electron repulsion, asymmetric couplings, and varying the length of the Kitaev chain. Our work provides a reliable method for tuning to protected states, including but not limited to isolated Majorana bound states.

Title: Explosive connectivity and mechanical rigidity in cubic lattice structures
Authors: Trenton Lau, Gary P. T. Choi
Abstract: We study explosive connectivity and mechanical rigidity in three-dimensional cubic lattice structures under Achlioptas-type product-rule dynamics. Our work combines extensive numerical simulation with the development of a new theoretical framework. For connectivity, we rigorously establish the presence of sublinear-width merger-cascade windows for $k\ge 2$, which drive macroscopic jumps in the order parameter and imply a first-order transition. For rigidity, we discover numerically that for richly-connected hosts, increasing the number of choices $k$ monotonically enhances the efficiency of rigidification. To explain this phenomenon, we propose a theoretical model centered on a conditional progress function that links an edge's local product-rule score to its global mechanical utility. We show that this function becomes non-increasing, thus explaining the observed monotonic efficiency, under two physically-motivated assumptions. Altogether, our work provides new insights into the relationship between local dynamics and global connectivity and rigidity in cubic lattice structures via both theory and computation.

Title: Toward Spectroscopic Accuracy in Quantum Dynamics Simulations with Fourth-Generation High-Dimensional Committee Neural Network Potentials
Authors: Md Omar Faruque, Dil K. Limbu, Nathan London, Mohammad R. Momeni
Abstract: Predictive simulation of vibrational spectra of complex condensed phases and interfaces with thousands of degrees of freedom has long been a challenging task of modern condensed matter theory. In this work, fourth-generation high-dimensional committee neural network potentials (4G-HDCNNPs) are developed for the first time, using active learning and query-by-committee, and introduced to the essential nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) as well as conformational entropy and anharmonicities from path integral (PI) molecular dynamics simulations. Using representative bulk water and air-water interface systems, we demonstrate the accuracy of the developed framework in infrared and vibrational sum frequency generation spectral simulations. Specifically, by seamlessly integrating non-local charge transfer interactions from 4G-HDCNNPs with the NQEs from PI methods, our introduced methodology yields accurate infrared spectra using predicted charges from the 4G-HDCNNP architecture without explicit training of dipole moments. Our vibrational sum frequency generation spectra also illustrate high accuracy for the considered air-water interface system. The introduced framework in this work is general and offers a benchmark tool and a simple, practical paradigm for predictive spectral simulations of complex condensed phases and interfaces, free from empirical parameterizations and/or ad hoc fittings.

Title: High-temperature superconducting Majorana fermions platforms in the layered Kitaev Materials: Case study of $Li_2IrO_3$
Authors: Elnaz Rostampour, Badie Ghavami
Abstract: Recent advances in Kitaev materials have highlighted their potential to host Majorana fermions without or high-temperature of superconductivity. In this research, we propose $Li_2IrO_3$ as a promising High-temperature superconducting platform supporting Majorana edge modes due to its strong spin-orbit coupling, honeycomb lattice structure, and proximity to a quantum spin liquid (QSL) phase. A theoretical and numerical framework based on the Kitaev-Heisenberg Hamiltonian is developed to model spin interactions in $Li_2IrO_3$. Here, the existence of topological zero-energy states is demonstrated, and their signatures in the edge-localized spectral weight are identified. A device concept based on this material is also proposed with potential industrial applications in spintronics, magnetic field sensing, and topological quantum memory.

Title: Current-Gated Orthogonal Superconducting Transistor
Authors: Ruo-Peng Yu, Jin-Xin Hu, Zi-Ting Sun
Abstract: Nonreciprocal charge transport in superconductors enables rectification but is usually limited to the longitudinal direction. In this work, we show that a direct current bias injected off principal axes in two-dimensional anisotropic superconductors converts anisotropy into transverse nonreciprocity, enabling supercurrent diode effect measurement. This is demonstrated within both a Ginzburg-Landau framework and self-consistent mean-field calculations. When the control bias exceeds its critical value, the transverse dissipationless currents can only flow unidirectionally. This mechanism motivates the design of a multi-terminal current-gated orthogonal superconducting transistor (CGOST) and yields simple, bias direction angle-dependent design rules for device optimization. As direct applications, we propose a tunable supercurrent range controller and a half-wave rectifier based on the CGOST. Our findings open new avenues for developing nonreciprocal superconducting electronic devices.

Title: From Wavefunction Sign Structure to Static Correlation
Authors: Matúš Dubecký
Abstract: Static correlation, the breakdown of mean-field theory in correlated many-fermion systems, can be reframed as a quantitative gauge of the fermion-sign problem. The variational energy gap between correlated wavefunctions constrained by mean-field and exact Dirichlet nodes defines a nodal penalty driven by their topological differences. Method-agnostic and dictated solely by the sign structure of the wavefunction, this penalty measures the intrinsic complexity of fermionic correlations. This framework unifies orbital and real-space views and opens a general route toward a rigorous, method-independent decomposition of electron correlation, guiding topology-aware approaches and future node-centric strategies.

Title: Coherent control of Floquet-engineered magnon frequency combs
Authors: Christopher Heins, Amelie Fehrmann, Lukas Körber, Joo-Von Kim, Attila Kákay, Jürgen Fassbender, Katrin Schultheiss, Helmut Schultheiss
Abstract: Frequency combs represent a hallmark of coherence emerging from nonlinear dynamics, where periodic driving organizes energy into a precisely spaced spectral structure. Extending this concept to collective excitations in solids such as magnons, the quanta of spin waves in magnetically ordered materials, offers a powerful route to control energy flow, coherence, and information processing in condensed matter systems. Here, we demonstrate deterministic control of Floquet-engineered magnon frequency combs in magnetic vortices using nanosecond voltage pulses. By tuning the pulse duration and timing, we control the nonlinear energy transfer between magnons and the vortex core, enabling the Floquet-engineered initiation or suppression of magnon frequency combs far below their spontaneous instability threshold. This pulse-programmable interaction allows the vortex to sustain magnon-driven auto-oscillation with high phase stability, or to revert to its static ground state on demand. Our results establish vortex-based magnetic systems as a robust solid-state platform for Floquet engineering, bridging nonlinear spin dynamics with frequency conversion and coherent spin-based quantum devices.

Title: Nonlinear transport fingerprints of tunable Fermi-arc connectivity in magnetic Weyl semimetal Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$
Authors: K. X. Jia, H. C. Li, M. H. Zou, H. Geng, Hua Jiang
Abstract: Fermi arcs in Weyl semimetals provide a unique platform for surface-state engineering, yet di rectly tracking of their evolution under surface tuning remains experimentally challenging. Here we theoretically propose that nonreciprocal charge transport can serve as a direct probe of Fermi arc Lifshitz transitions (FALT). We show that different surface terminations in Co3Sn2S2 can produce f inite and highly tunable second-order nonreciprocal signals, which can be further modulated by adjusting the surface potential. Strikingly, we show that the second-order conductivity exhibits sign changes as the Fermi arc connectivity is tuned across FALT driven by gating or chemical potential variation. This behavior arises from the chiral nature of electron velocities on the Fermi arcs, and is highly sensitive to surface termination and symmetry breaking. Our findings establish nonreciprocal transport as an electrically measurable fingerprint of FALT and propose new strategies that could be directly applied in devices for in situ engineering and detecting transport properties in topological materials.

Title: On the Fibonacci-Lucas Ground State Degeneracies of the One-Dimensional Antiferromagnetic Ising Model at Criticality
Authors: Bastian Castorene, Francisco J. Peña, Patricio Vargas
Abstract: This work examines the one-dimensional antiferromagnetic Ising model in a longitudinal magnetic field, comparing open-chain and closed-ring geometries. At the nontrivial quantum critical point (QCP) $B_{\mathrm{crit}} = B/J = 2$, we perform a microcanonical analysis of the ground-state manifold and explicitly count the number of degenerate configurations. The enumeration reveals that ground states follow the $N$th Fibonacci sequence for open chains and the $N$th Lucas sequence for periodic rings, establishing a clear correspondence between critical degeneracy, topology, and the golden ratio. This combinatorial duality exposes a number-theoretic structure underlying quantum criticality and highlights the role of topological constraints in shaping residual entropy. Beyond its conceptual relevance, the result provides a compact framework for analyzing degeneracy scaling in one-dimensional spin systems and may inform future studies of critical phenomena and quantum thermodynamic devices operating near critical regimes.

Title: Quantum critical behavior of diluted quasi-one-dimensional Ising chains
Authors: Logan Sowadski, Thomas Vojta
Abstract: CoNb$_2$O$_6$ is a unique magnetic material. It features bulk three-dimensional magnetic order at low temperatures, but its quantum critical behavior in a magnetic field is well described by the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising universality class. This behavior is facilitated by the structural arrangement of magnetic Co$^{2+}$ ions in nearly isolated zig-zag chains. In this work, we investigate the effect of random site dilution on the critical properties of such a quasi-one-dimensional quantum Ising system. To this end, we introduce an anisotropic site-diluted three-dimensional transverse-field Ising model. We find that site dilution leads to unconventional activated scaling behavior at the quantum phase transition. Interestingly, the critical exponents of the quantum critical point are in good agreement with those of the disordered three-dimensional transverse-field Ising universality class, despite the strong spatial anisotropy. We discuss the generality our findings as well as implications for experiments.

We observe a \textit{Fano resonance} in the microwave transmission when the driven amplitude of the magnetization is large and the drive frequency $\omega_d$ is close to but not at the ferromagnetic resonance. When the drive frequency is very close to the ferromagnetic resonance, the microwave transmission splits into two absorption dips. We interpret the unexpected Fano resonance by a scattering theory of photons considering the three-magnon interaction between the Kittel magnon and magnon pairs with opposite wave vectors of frequency $\omega_d/2$. The theoretical model suggests that the microwave spectroscopy measures the dynamics of the fluctuation $\delta \hat{\alpha}$ of the Kittel magnon and $\delta\hat{\beta}_{\pm k}$ of the magnon pairs over the driven steady states, which are coupled coherently by the steady-state amplitudes. When the damping of $\delta\hat{\beta}_{\pm k}$ is much smaller than that of $\delta \hat{\alpha}$, the theoretical calculation can well reproduce the observed Fano resonance. Mode fluctuations with a low damping should be useful for quantum information and logic operations in future magnonic devices.

Abstract: Altermagnetism is a recently identified phase with a d, g or i-wave spin symmetry of magnetic ordering. Its discovery opens new research fronts at intersections of magnetism and spintronics with fields ranging from superconductivity to topological and relativistic quantum physics. Here we demonstrate an unconventional relativistic spin polarization in an altermagnet by spin and angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy of electronic bands in single-domain MnTe. The relativis- tic spin-orbit coupling origin is revealed by observing that the alternating momentum-dependent spin polarization is orthogonal to the magnetic-ordering vector. The collinearity, even-parity and time-reversal-odd nature of the demonstrated relativistic spin polarization in the altermagnet is un- paralleled in conventional forms of the relativistic spin polarization. Our experimental results and methodology are supported by non-relativistic spin-symmetry and relativistic magnetic-symmetry analyses, and microscopic ab initio ground-state and photoemission theory.

Title: Phason-driven temperature-dependent transport in moiré graphene
Authors: Alex Boschi, Alejandro Ramos-Alonso, Vaidotas Mišeikis, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Fabio Beltram, Stiven Forti, Antonio Rossi, Camilla Coletti, Rafael M. Fernandes, Héctor Ochoa, Sergio Pezzini
Abstract: The electronic and vibrational properties of 2D materials are dramatically altered by the formation of a moiré superlattice. The lowest-energy phonon modes of the superlattice are two acoustic branches (called phasons) that describe the sliding motion of one layer with respect to the other. Considering their low-energy dispersion and damping, these modes may act as a significant source of scattering for electrons in moiré materials. Here, we investigate temperature-dependent electrical transport in minimally twisted bilayer graphene, a moiré system developing multiple weakly-dispersive electronic bands and a reconstructed lattice structure. We measure a linear-in-temperature resistivity across the band manyfold above $T\sim{10}$ K, preceded by a quadratic temperature dependence. While the linear-in-temperature resistivity is up to two orders of magnitude larger than in monolayer graphene, it is reduced (approximately by a factor of three) with respect to magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene. Moreover, it is modulated by the recursive band filling, with minima located close to the full filling of each band. Comparing our results with a semiclassical transport calculation, we show that the experimental trends are compatible with scattering processes mediated by longitudinal phasons, which dominate the resistivity over the contribution from conventional acoustic phonons of the monolayer. Our findings highlight the close relation between vibrational modes unique to moiré materials and carrier transport therein.

Title: Spontaneous Raman Scattering under Vibrational Strong Coupling: The Critical Role of Polariton Spatial Mode Coherence
Authors: Maxime Dherbécourt, Joël Bellessa, Clémentine Symonds, Guillaume Weick, David Hagenmüller
Abstract: Resonant coupling of a vibration to a cavity mode has been reported to dramatically modify spontaneous Raman scattering, but subsequent studies have produced conflicting results. In this Letter, we develop a microscopic quantum framework that captures the spatial structure of polaritonic modes. In a homogeneously filled cavity, spatial overlap between polaritons and cavity resonances enforces selection rules that suppress the initially reported polaritonic Raman peaks, consistent with most experiments. In contrast, for a quasi-two-dimensional (2d) molecular layer, these rules are lifted, yielding Raman peaks at the polariton energies. Our work clarifies that the Raman response under vibrational strong coupling is determined by cavity-vibration spatial mode overlap and offers a framework for Raman studies of strongly coupled quasi-2d systems.

Title: Critical theory of Pomeranchuk transitions via high-dimensional bosonization
Authors: Zhengfei Hu, Jaychandran Padayasi, Oğuz Türker, Kun Yang
Abstract: We use high-dimensional bosonization to derive an effective field theory that describes the Pomeranchuck transition in isotropic two-dimensional Fermi liquids. We find that the transition is triggered by the softening of an eigenmode that leads to spontaneous Fermi surface distortion. The resultant theory in terms of this critical mode has dynamical critical exponent $z = 2$ and the upper critical dimension is $d_c = 4-z= 2$. As a result the system is at the upper critical dimension in 2D, resulting in a Gaussian fixed point with a marginally irrelevant quartic perturbation.

Title: Emergence of charge-2$e$ bosonic carriers and pseudogaps in the dynamics of residual electrons
Authors: Muhammad Gaffar, Wei Ku
Abstract: Emergence of charge-2$e$ bosonic carriers as tightly bound electrons presents perhaps the simplest route to understand the non-Fermi liquid behaviors widely observed in functional materials. However, such scenario is typically discarded when unbound electrons are observed near the chemical potential. Here, using attractive Hubbard model as a representative example, we demonstrate the emergence of such ''bosonic'' bound pairs in the presence of residual low-energy electrons through determinant quantum Monte Carlo computation of their propagators. Furthermore, above the superfluid temperature the electronic spectral function is found to display a typical non-Fermi liquid behavior, namely a pseudogap near the chemical potential. This study provides the microscopic foundation for scenarios of boson-fermion mixed liquid as effective descriptions for some of the strongly correlated functional materials.

Title: Intrinsic Nonlinear Planar Thermal Hall effect
Authors: Chanchal K. Barman
Abstract: We introduce the intrinsic nonlinear planar thermal Hall effect (NPTHE)-- a dissipationless thermal response proportional to $(\nabla T)^2B$, which arises when the temperature gradient $\nabla T$ and magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$ lie within the same plane. The effect originates from a thermal gradient induced correction to the Berry curvature, characterized by the thermal Berry connection polarizability (TBCP) tensor, leading to a nonlinear transverse heat current independent of scattering time. A symmetry analysis shows that the intrinsic NPTHE is permitted only in noncentrosymmetric crystal point groups lacking horizontal mirror symmetry. Using a tilted Dirac model, we demonstrate that its characteristic angular dependence provides an effective means to control the nonlinear thermal response. Our results establish a new class of quantum geometry driven intrinsic nonlinear thermal transport, offering both a sensitive probe of band geometry and a pathway toward nonlinear thermal functionalities in quantum materials.

Title: Charge disproportionation driven polar magnetic metallic double-layered perovskite Sr$_3$Co$_2$O$_7$
Authors: Hong-Fei Huang, Houssam Sabri, Jiadong Zang, Jie-Xiang Yu
Abstract: Strong coupling among spontaneous structural symmetric breaking, magnetism and metallicity in an intrinsic polar magnetic metal can give rise to novel physical phenomena and holds great promise for applications in spintronics. Here, we elucidate the mechanism of metallic ferroelectricity in the recently discovered polar metal Sr$_3$Co$_2$O$_7$. Our first-principles calculations reveal that both the spontaneous ferroelectric displacements and the metallicity originate from charge disproportionation of Co ions. This is characterized by an inverted ligand-field splitting of the Co $t_2g$ orbitals at one site, while the metallic behavior is preserved by the t$_2g$ orbitals at both sites. The charge disproportionation stabilizes the asymmetric phase Within the framework of the on-site Hubbard U interaction. We thus propose that in related transition metal oxides, charge disproportionation within specific orbitals can concurrently drive metallicity and ferroelectricity, enabling strong coupling between these properties. More remarkably, this mechanism allows for the coexistence of magnetism, as evidenced in Sr$_3$Co$_2$O$_7$. Our findings highlight a promising avenue for realizing polar magnetic metals and provide a new design principle for exploring multifunctional materials.

Title: Comparison between first-principles supercell calculations of polarons and the ab initio polaron equations
Authors: Zhenbang Dai, Donghwan Kim, Jon Lafuente-Bartolome, Feliciano Giustino
Abstract: Polarons are composite quasiparticles formed by excess charges and the accompanying lattice distortions in solids, and play a critical role in transport, optical, and catalytic properties of semiconductors and insulators. The standard approach for calculating polarons from first principles relies on density functional theory and periodic supercells. An alternative approach consists of recasting the calculation of polaron wavefunction, lattice distortion, and energy as a coupled nonlinear eigenvalue problem, using the band structure, phonon dispersions, and the electron-phonon matrix elements as obtained from density functional perturbation theory. Here, we revisit the formal connection between these two approaches, with an emphasis on the handling of self-interaction correction, and we establish a compact formal link between them. We perform a quantitative comparison of these methods for the case of small polarons in the prototypical insulators TiO2, MgO, and LiF. We find that the polaron wavefunctions and lattice distortions obtained from these methods are nearly indistinguishable in all cases, and the formation energies are in good (TiO2) to fair (MgO) agreement. We show that the residual deviations can be ascribed to the neglect of higher-order electron-phonon couplings in the density functional perturbation theory approach.

Title: Capillary and priming pressures control the penetration of yield-stress fluids through non-wetting 2D meshes
Authors: Manon Bourgade, Nicolas Bain, Loïc Vanel, Mathieu Leocmach, Catherine Barentin
Abstract: Forcing hydrophilic fluids through hydrophobic porous solids is a recurrent industrial challenge. If the penetrating fluid is Newtonian, the imposed pressure has to overcome the capillary pressure at the fluid-air interface in a pore. The presence of a yield-stress, however, makes the pressure transfer and the penetration significantly more complex. In this study, we experimentally investigate the forced penetration of a water based yield-stress fluid through a regular hydrophobic mesh under quasi-static conditions, combining quantitative pressure measurements and direct visualisation of the penetration process. We reveal that the penetration is controlled by a competition between the yield-stress and two distinct pressures. The capillary pressure, that dictates the threshold at which the yield-stress fluid penetrates the hydrophobic mesh, and a priming pressure, that controls how the fluid advances through it. The latter corresponds to a pressure drop ensuing a local capillary instability, never reported before. Our findings shine a new light on forced imbibition processes, with direct implications on their fundamental understanding and practical engineering.

Title: Excitons in moiré superlattices with disordered electrons
Authors: Junghwan Kim, Dinh Van Tuan, Hanan Dery
Abstract: Moiré superlattices in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) heterobilayers exhibit various correlated insulating states driven by long-range Coulomb interactions, and these states crucially alter exciton resonances, particularly at fractional fillings. We revisit a theoretical framework to investigate the doping dependence of exciton spectra by extending hydrogenic exciton wavefunctions, systematically analyzing how the 1$s$, 2$s$, and 3$s$ Rydberg states respond to moiré-induced mixing of $s$- and $p$-type orbitals. Notably, while the 1$s$ state remains relatively robust against doping, higher Rydberg excitons show strong redshifts and oscillator-strength quenching near specific fractional fillings. We incorporate both defect-induced quasi-ordering and thermal fluctuations to capture realistic device conditions, employing a large supercell approach. By selectively randomizing a subset of electrons or utilizing classical Monte Carlo simulations, we present direct calculations of exciton spectra under varying defect densities and temperatures. Our results emphasize how even moderate disorder or finite temperature can partially or completely suppress characteristic moiré exciton physics. Especially, we show how the 2$s$ exciton states respond to the phase transition in correlated electron states. This comprehensive picture not only clarifies recent experimental observations but also provides a framework to guide the design of moiré-based optoelectronic devices.

Title: Thermal tuning of dynamic response in Ag-based nanowire networks
Authors: J.I. Diaz Schneider, C. Gomez, C. Acha, P.E. Levy, E.D. Martínez, C.P. Quinteros
Abstract: Self-assembled networks of metallic nanowires (NWs) are being intensively explored as test benches for neuromorphic proposals. In this work, we study the electric transport properties of dense self-assembled networks of Ag-based NWs (AgNWNs) coated with a thin insulating layer, using DC and AC stimuli. The building blocks of this network are the metallic NWs and the NW-NW junctions, either metallic or memristive. In the pristine state, frequency independence of the impedance reveals an over-percolated purely resistive network. A combination of low-temperature annealing and AC stimulus is shown to drastically affect the resistivity of the sample (interpreted as a depopulation of purely metallic junctions), unveiling a rich dynamic response. This procedure triggers the achievement of a capacitive response, which is successfully rationalized using a previously introduced 'two junction model'. Thermal treatment appears to be an indirect strategy to effectively modify the humidity content at the NW-NW intersections and, consequently, enable multiple switching schemes suitable for brain-like processing alternatives.

Title: Superconductivity of bilayer two-orbital Hubbard model for La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ under high pressure
Authors: Wei-Yang Chen, Cui-Qun Chen, Meng Wang, Shou-Shu Gong, Dao-Xin Yao
Abstract: By combining density functional theory (DFT) and density matrix renormalization group calculations, we investigate the unusual pressure dependence of superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) in the nickelate superconductor La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$. Using the hopping integrals and on-site potentials obtained by fitting the DFT band structures, we map a quantum phase diagram of a bilayer two-orbital Hubbard model with increasing pressure in a ladder geometry, which has an intermediate Hubbard repulsion and a Hund's coupling. Near $3/8$ filling, we find a strong spin density wave order, which at $3/8$ filling shows a real-space spin pattern similar to the spin-charge stripe order along a lattice direction. At $21/64$ filling, we find a superconducting phase with interlayer superconductivity (SC) in both the $d_{z^2}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals, as well as in-plane SC in the $d_{z^2}$ orbital. Intriguingly, the SC is weakened with increasing pressure and transits to a Luttinger liquid above $80$ GPa, which qualitatively agrees with the experimental observations of decreasing $T_c$ with increasing pressure and a transition to Fermi liquid above $80$ GPa in La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$. Through a comparative study, we further show that the ratio of interaction to hopping integral, which reduces moderately with increasing pressure, may play a dominant role in the weakening of SC. Our results of this experimentally relevant model not only find a robust SC through suppressing the competing spin density wave order, but also give new insight into the unusual pressure dependence of SC in La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$.

Title: Finite-frequency admittance and noise of a helical edge coupled to a magnet
Authors: Oliver Franke, Paula Koll, Peter G. Silvestrov, Piet W. Brouwer
Abstract: The exchange coupling of the helical edge state of a quantum spin-Hall insulator with an easy-plane magnet has no effect on its DC electrical conductance if the magnet's anisotropy axis is aligned with the spin quantization axis of the helical edge state [Meng et al., Phys. Rev. B 90, 205403 (2014)]. We here calculate the AC conductance $G_V(\omega)$ and the noise power $S_V(\omega)$ in the presence of a DC bias $V$. While both take the universal values $G_V({\omega = 0}) = e^2/h$ and $S_V(\omega = 0) = 4 e^2 k_{\rm B} T/h$ in the zero-frequency limit, $G_V(\omega)$ and $S_V(\omega)$ are quickly suppressed for finite $\omega$, so that low-frequency transport is effectively noiseless.

Title: The Quantum Self-Consistent Harmonic Approximation: A Unified Framework for Quantum Spin System
Authors: G. C. Villela, A. R. Moura
Abstract: The Self-Consistent Harmonic Approximation (SCHA) has been utilized to investigate quantum and thermal phase transitions within magnetic models and, more recently, in spintronic applications. The SCHA methodology involves utilizing simple harmonic Hamiltonians, which are augmented with renormalization parameters that incorporate high-order fluctuations typically overlooked by conventional Linear Spin-Wave (LSW) theories. Although this approach exhibits reasonable accuracy for models defined by large spin values, its reliability diminishes when applied to quantum systems with $S=1/2$. The traditional development of SCHA has incorporated semiclassical assumptions that obscure quantum effects. In this study, we introduce a quantum framework for the SCHA that eliminates the need for semiclassical approximations. Our Quantum Self-Consistent Harmonic Approximation (QSCHA) utilizes the spin coherent states formalism within a fully quantum formulation. Consequently, we derive a novel renormalization parameter that accurately integrates quantum corrections. To assess the efficacy of this new approach, we apply the QSCHA to analyze the critical temperature transitions across various well-documented magnetic models. The findings, combined with the simplified operational procedure relative to other conventional interacting spin-wave methodologies, suggest that QSCHA is a promising tool for advancing research in quantum magnetism and spintronics.

Title: Directional atomic layer etching of lithium niobate using Br-based plasma
Authors: Ivy I. Chen, Mariya Ezzy, Emily Hsue-Chi Shi, Clifford F. Frez, Suraj, Lin Yi, Mahmood Bagheri, James R. Renzas, Alireza Marandi, Frank Greer, Austin J. Minnich
Abstract: Lithium niobate (LiNbO$_3$, LN) is a nonlinear optical material of high interest for integrated photonics with applications ranging from optical communications to quantum information processing. The performance of on-chip devices based on thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) is presently limited by fabrication imperfections such as sidewall surface roughness and geometry inhomogeneities over the chip. Atomic layer etching (ALE) could potentially be used to overcome these difficulties. Although an isotropic ALE process for LN has been reported, performing LN fabrication completely with ALE faces several challenges, including the lack of a directional ALE process for pattern transfer and the redeposition of involatile compounds. Here, we report a directional ALE process for LN consisting of sequential exposures of HBr/BCl$_3$/Ar plasma for surface modification and Ar plasma for removal. The HBr chemistry is found to decrease redeposition compared to F- and Cl-based plasmas, which we attribute to the higher vapor pressures of Br-based products. A grating pattern etched entirely by the process (total etch depth of 220 nm) exhibits no aspect ratio dependent etching (ARDE) down to the smallest tested gap of 150 nm, in contrast to ion milling in which ARDE manifests even at 300 nm gaps for the same etch depth. The HBr plasma chemistry is also found to support an isotropic process consisting of sequential exposures of H$_2$ plasma and HBr/BCl$_3$/Ar plasma. These processes could be used together to perform the complete fabrication process for TFLN devices, eliminating imperfections arising from ion milling.

Title: Quantum Acoustics Demystifies the Strange Metals

Abstract: Phonons have long been thought to be incapable of explaining key phenomena in strange metals, including linear-in-\textit{T} Planckian resistivity from high to very low temperatures. We argue that these conclusions were based on static, perturbative approaches that overlooked essential time-dependent and nonperturbative electron-lattice physics. In fact ``phonons'' are not the best target for discussion, just like ``photons'' are not the best way to think about Maxwell's equations. Quantum optics connects photons and electromagnetism, as developed 60 years ago by Glauber and others. We have been developing the parallel world of quantum acoustics. Far from being only of academic interest, the new tools are rapidly exposing the secrets of the strange metals, revealing strong vibronic (vibration-electronic) interactions playing a crucial role forming polarons and charge density waves, linear-in-$T$ resistivity at the Planckian rate over thousands of degrees, resolution of the Drude peak infrared anomaly, and the absence of a $T^4$ low-temperature resistivity rise in 2D systems, and of a Mott-Ioffe-Regel resistivity saturation. We derive Planckian transport, polarons, CDWs, and pseudogaps from the Fröhlich model. The ``new physics'' has been hiding in this model all along, in the right parameter regime, if it is treated nonperturbatively. In the course of this work we have uncovered the generalization of Anderson localization to dynamic media: a universal Planckian diffusion emerges, a ``ghost'' of Anderson localization. Planckian diffusion is clearly defined and is more fundamental than the popular but elusive, model dependent concept of ``Planckian speed limit''.

Title: Mechanically concealed holes
Authors: Kanka Ghosh, Andreas M. Menzel
Abstract: When a hole is introduced into an elastic material, it will usually act to reduce the overall mechanical stiffness. A general ambition is to investigate whether a stiff shell around the hole can act to maintain the overall mechanical properties. We consider the basic example situation of an isotropic, homogeneous, linearly elastic material loaded uniformly under plane strain for low concentrations of holes. As we demonstrate, the thickness of the shell can be adjusted in a way to maintain the overall stiffness of the system. We derive a corresponding mathematical expression for the thickness of the shell that conceals the hole. Thus, one can work with given materials to mask the presence of the holes. One does not necessarily need to adjust the material parameters and thus materials themselves. Our predictions from linear elasticity continuum theory are extended to atomistic level using molecular dynamics simulations of a model Lennard-Jones solid. Small deviations from linear elasticity theory can be minimized by tuning the hole-to-system size ratio in the molecular dynamics simulations. This extension attests the robustness of our continuum predictions even at atomistic scales. The basic concept is important in the context of light-weight construction.

Title: Simulated outperforms quantum reverse annealing in mean-field models
Authors: Christopher L. Baldwin
Abstract: Adiabatic reverse annealing (ARA) has been proposed as an improvement to conventional quantum annealing for solving optimization problems, in which one takes advantage of an initial guess at the solution to suppress problematic phase transitions. Here we interpret the performance of ARA through its effects on the free energy landscape, and use the intuition gained to introduce a classical analogue to ARA termed ``simulated reverse annealing'' (SRA). This makes it more difficult to claim that ARA provides a quantum advantage in solving a given problem, as not only must ARA succeed but the corresponding SRA must fail. As a solvable example, we analyze how both protocols behave in the infinite-range (non-disordered) $p$-spin model. Through both the thermodynamic phase diagrams and explicit dynamical behavior, we establish that the quantum algorithm has no advantage over its classical counterpart: SRA succeeds not only in every case where ARA does but even in a narrow range of parameters where ARA fails.

Title: How periodic surfaces bend without stretching
Authors: Hussein Nassar, Andrew Weber
Abstract: Many compliant shell mechanisms are periodically corrugated or creased. Being thin, their preferred deformation modes are inextensional, i.e., isometric. Here, we report on a recent characterization of the isometric deformations of periodic surfaces. In a way reminiscent of Gauss theorem, the result builds a constraint that relates the ways in which the periodic surface stretches, effectively but isometrically, to the ways in which it bends and twists. Several examples and use cases are presented.

Abstract: Quantum computers must operate in concert with classical computers to deliver on the promise of quantum advantage for practical problems. To achieve that, it is important to understand how quantum and classical computing can interact together, and how one can characterize the scalability and efficiency of hybrid quantum-classical workflows. So far, early experiments with quantum-centric supercomputing workflows have been limited in scale and complexity. Here, we use a Heron quantum processor deployed on premises with the entire supercomputer Fugaku to perform the largest computation of electronic structure involving quantum and classical high-performance computing. We design a closed-loop workflow between the quantum processors and 152,064 classical nodes of Fugaku, to approximate the electronic structure of chemistry models beyond the reach of exact diagonalization, with accuracy comparable to some all-classical approximation methods. Our work pushes the limits of the integration of quantum and classical high-performance computing, showcasing computational resource orchestration at the largest scale possible for current classical supercomputers.

Title: Approximating Young Measures With Deep Neural Networks
Authors: Rayehe Karimi Mahabadi, Jianfeng Lu, Hossein Salahshoor
Abstract: Parametrized measures (or Young measures) enable to reformulate non-convex variational problems as convex problems at the cost of enlarging the search space from space of functions to space of measures. To benefit from such machinery, we need powerful tools for approximating measures. We develop a deep neural network approximation of Young measures in this paper. The key idea is to write the Young measure as push-forward of Gaussian mea- sures, and reformulate the problem of finding Young measures to finding the corresponding push-forward. We approximate the push-forward map us- ing deep neural networks by encoding the reformulated variational problem in the loss function. After developing the framework, we demonstrate the approach in several numerical examples. We hope this framework and our illustrative computational experiments provide a pathway for approximating Young measures in their wide range of applications from modeling complex microstructure in materials to non-cooperative games.

Title: Confinement inhibits surficial attachment and induces collective behaviors in bacterial colonies
Authors: Vincent Hickl, Gabriel Gmünder, René M. Rossi, Antonia Neels, Qun Ren, Katharina Maniura-Weber, Bruno F. B. Silva
Abstract: Bacterial colonies are a well-known example of living active matter, exhibiting collective behaviors such as nematic alignment and collective motion that play an important role in the spread of microbial infections. While the underlying mechanics of these behaviors have been described in model systems, many open questions remain about how microbial self-organization adapts to the variety of different environments bacteria encounter in natural and clinical settings. Here, using novel imaging and computational analysis techniques, the effects of confinement to 2D on the collective behaviors of pathogenic bacteria are described. Biofilm-forming Pseudomonas aeruginosa are grown on different substrates, either open to the surrounding fluid or confined to a single monolayer between two surfaces. Orientational ordering in the colony, cell morphologies, and trajectories are measured using single-cell segmentation and tracking. Surprisingly, confinement inhibits permanent attachment and induces twitching motility, giving rise to multiple coexisting collective behaviors. This effect is shown to be independent of the confining material and the presence of liquid medium. The nematic alignment and degree of correlation in the cells' trajectories determines how effectively bacteria can invade the space between two surfaces and the 3D structure of the colony after several days. Confinement causes the formation of dynamic cell layers driven by collective motion as well as collective verticalization leading to the formation of densely packed crystalline structures exhibiting long-range order. These results demonstrate the remarkable breadth of collective behaviors exhibited by bacteria in different environments, which must be considered to better understand bacterial colonization of surfaces.

Title: Quantifying the Full Damage Profile of Focused Ion Beams via 4D-STEM Precession Electron Diffraction and PSNR Metrics
Authors: M.G. Masteghin, Z.P. Aslam, A.P. Brown, M.J. Whiting, S.K. Clowes, R.P. Webb, D.C. Cox
Abstract: Focused ion beams (FIBs) are widely used in nanofabrication for applications such as circuit repair, ultra-thin lamella preparation, strain engineering, and quantum device prototyping. Although the lateral spread of the ion beam is often overlooked, it becomes critical in precision tasks such as impurity placement in host substrates, where accurate knowledge of the ion-matter interaction profile is essential. Existing techniques typically characterise only the beam core, where most ions land, thus underestimating the full extent of the point spread function (PSF). In this work, we use four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) to resolve the ion beam tail at defect densities equivalent to $<$0.1 ions nm$^{-2}$. Convergent beam electron diffraction (CBED) patterns were collected in calibration regions with known ion fluence and compared to patterns acquired around static dwell spots exposed to a 30 keV Ga$^{+}$ beam for 1-10 s. Cross-correlation using peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) revealed that 4D-STEM datasets are ultra-sensitive for defect quantification and more robust against scanning artefacts than conventional dark-field imaging. This approach is complementary to image resolution methods enabling a comprehensive profiling of ion-induced damage even at low-dose regimes, offering a more accurate representation of FIB performance and supporting application tailoring beyond the conventional resolution metrics focused solely on the beam core.

Title: Universality in Ionic Three-body Systems Near an Ion-atom Feshbach Resonance
Authors: Jacek Gȩbala, Michał Tomza, José P. D'Incao
Abstract: We calculate the recombination rates into quantum bound channels across a series of ion-atom scattering lengths. Our results confirms the breakdown of the theory of 'van-der-Waals universality' and the effective range theory, both of which fail to describe the recombination rates in ion-atom systems for large scattering lengths. We investigate this phenomenon further -- through calculations we observe the appearance of weakly bound ionic triatomic molecules. We compare the spectrum and lifetimes of these trimers to neutral system and present results indicating that such trimers could be stable with respect to modern experiments.

Title: Transmission Coefficients from Phantom Currents
Authors: Yuma Furuta, Yuya Kusuki, Toshiki Onagi
Abstract: A representative quantity that characterizes the dynamics of conformal interfaces is the transmission coefficient, which is defined through correlation functions of the stress tensor. Typically, this coefficient is complicated and highly dependent on its details. In this work, we introduce a new perspective based on the notion of a ``phantom current''. We have shown that a spin-2 phantom current arising from the folding trick completely determines the transmission coefficient. In particular, when there is a single phantom current, the transmission coefficient is uniquely fixed by its conformal dimension. As a result, our framework provides a unified explanation of known results in minimal models and the free boson, while also yielding concrete predictions for previously unexplored interfaces.

Title: Direct Observation and Optical Manipulation of Exciton-polariton Parametric Scattering Lasing in Temporal
Authors: Junxing Dong, Si Shen, Jingzhuo Wang, Lisheng Wang, Yifan Zhang, Huashan Li, Xianghu Wang, Wei Gao, Yongzheng Fang, Hai Zhu
Abstract: The hybrid light-matter character of exciton-polaritons gives rise to distinct polariton parametric scattering (PPS) process, which holds promise for frontier applications in polaritonic quantum devices. However, the stable excitation and coherent optical manipulation of PPS remain challenging due to scattering bottlenecks and rapid dephasing effect in polariton many-body systems. In this study, we first report the direct observation and optical amplification of non-degenerate intermode PPS lasing at room temperature (RT). The specific polariton branch of strong-coupled nanobelt planar microcavity is resonantly excited by a near-infrared (NIR) femtosecond laser via two-photon absorption (TPA) scheme, and the non-degenerate signal- and idler-states are stimulated. Angle-resolved dispersion patterns clearly reveal the evolution of the pump-, signal-, and idler-states under different excitation powers. Based on our self-constructed ultrafast femtosecond resonant optical trigger set-up, a selective enhancement and modulation of the signal-state is realized. Furthermore, the dynamic measurements of nonlinear signal-state enhancement process demonstrate a sub-picosecond response time (0.4ps), confirming its potential for ultrafast optical manipulation. Our work establishes a platform for exploring TPA-driven PPS laser and provides a novel optical modulation route for polariton-based optoelectronic devices.

Title: Conformal Bootstrap with Duality-Inspired Fusion Rule
Authors: Yu Nakayama, Toshiki Onagi
Abstract: We present the first systematic exploration of conformal field theories (CFTs) possessing fusion rules inspired by categorical (non-invertible) symmetries, using the conformal bootstrap. Specifically, we impose a selection rule motivated by Kramers-Wannier duality and derive bounds on the conformal dimensions $(\Delta_\sigma, \Delta_\epsilon)$ of the lowest-lying $\mathbb{Z}_2$-odd scalar $\sigma$ and $\mathbb{Z}_2$-even scalar $\epsilon$ in dimensions $d=2$ through $d=7$. Our bounds correctly allow the $d=2$ Ising model while excluding the $d=3$ Ising model, demonstrating the effectiveness of the imposed condition. Furthermore, we observe a distinct feature in $d=2$ corresponding to the $\mathcal{M}(8,7)$ minimal model and find non-trivial constraints in $d=3$ ($\Delta_\sigma \gtrsim 0.85$), relevant for theories like QED$_3$. This work opens a new avenue for non-perturbatively probing the vast landscape of CFTs constrained by non-invertible symmetries.

Title: Bubble damping of non-stationary oscillatory flow stabilization in microfluidic systems
Authors: Andreu Benavent-Claró
Abstract: The inherent instability of oscillatory flows presents a significant challenge in microfluidics, impairing performance in different applications from particle detachemnt to organs-on-a-chip. Trapped air inside a microfluidic system passively dampens these fluctuations because of the compressible nature of air. However, a foundational theoretical model that describes this effect has remained elusive. Here, a first-principles model that fully characterizes the effects of a trapped air volume in oscillatory microfluidic flow is derived. The model identifies a dimensionless product as the governing parameter, unifying the interplay between air compressibility and fluidic resistance. It precisely predicts the volume displacement dynamics of the liquid front, which compared with the original flow, it presents amplitude reduction, phase shift, and transient drift. The theoretical framework was validated with different experiments across a broad range of conditions. This work transforms trapped air from a source of unpredictability into a powerful, predictable element for tailoring oscillatory flow stability, providing a rigorous design tool for microfluidic systems.

Title: Quantum dynamics in lattices in presence of bulk dephasing and a localized source
Authors: Tamoghna Ray, Katha Ganguly, Dario Poletti, Manas Kulkarni, Bijay Kumar Agarwalla
Abstract: The aim of this work is to study the dynamics of quantum systems subjected to a localized fermionic source in the presence of bulk dephasing. We consider two classes of one-dimensional lattice systems: (i) a non-interacting lattice with nearest-neighbor and beyond, i.e., long-ranged (power-law) hopping, and (ii) a lattice that is interacting via short-range interactions modeled by a fermionic quartic Hamiltonian. We study the evolution of the local density profile $n_i(t)$ within the system and the growth of the total particle number $N(t)$ in it. For case (i), we provide analytical insights into the dynamics of the nearest-neighbor model using an adiabatic approximation, which relies on assuming faster relaxation of coherences of the single particle density matrix. For case (ii), we perform numerical computations using the time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) algorithm and analyze the density profile and the growth exponent in $N(t)$. Our detailed study reveals an interesting interplay between Hamiltonian dynamics and various environmentally induced mechanisms in open quantum systems, such as local source and bulk dephasing. It brings out rich dynamics, including universal dynamical scaling and anomalous behavior across various time scales and is of relevance to various quantum simulation platforms.

Title: Thermoelastic wave-based logic for mechanically cognitive materials
Authors: Ethan Fort, Mohamed Mousa, Mostafa Nouh
Abstract: Recent advances in metamaterials and fabrication techniques have revived interest in mechanical computing. Contrary to techniques relying on static deformations of buckling beams or origami-based lattices, the integration of wave scattering and mechanical memory presents a promising path toward efficient, low-latency elastoacoustic computing. This work introduces a novel class of multifunctional mechanical computing circuits that leverage the rich dynamics of phononic and locally resonant materials. These circuits incorporate memory-integrated components, realized here via metamaterial cells infused with shape memory alloys which recall stored elastic profiles and trigger specific actions upon thermal activation. A critical advantage of this realization is its synergistic interaction with incident vibroacoustic loads and the inherited high speed of waves, giving it a notable performance edge over recent adaptations of mechanically intelligent systems that employ innately slower mechanisms such as elastomeric shape changes and snap-through bistabilities. Through a proof-of-concept physical implementation, the efficacy and reconfigurability of the wave-based gates are demonstrated via output probes and measured wavefields. Furthermore, the modular design of the fundamental gates can be used as building blocks to construct complex combinational logic circuits, paving the way for sequential logic in wave-based analog computing systems.

Title: Magnetic Materials for Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)
Authors: Max Koehler, Akshata Sangle, Stefan M. Goetz
Abstract: Various coils for transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) are widely available for clinical and research use. These coils are almost all designed as air coils, which require large levels of energy to achieve a given magnetic flux density and in turn electric field strength, whereas in other sectors, such as power electronics or electrical machines, magnetic materials have been used for a long time to achieve higher efficiencies. We tested the impact on the electric and magnetic properties of different soft magnetic materials, including various ferrite cores, laminated sheet materials of nonisotropic corn-oriented silicon-steel, non-oriented silicon-steel, as well as cobalt-iron, and soft magnetic compound powder cores with insulated particles. Every material led to a reduction in coil current and voltage for the same target electric field strength. For the same field energy, every material yielded lower losses. Most common materials saturated already at very low currents. More material in thicker layers could shift the saturation point but at the cost of high weight. Due to their low saturation flux density, ferrites appear unsuitable for the high amplitude requirements of TMS. Laminated sheet materials and powder cores reduce the pulse energy, but the laminated sheet material adds more weight for the same effect than powder cores. Thus, appropriate magnetic materials can reduce the required pulse energy. Saturation flux density is the most relevant parameter, whereas the permeability beyond a certain base level is practically irrelevant. Most importantly, the weight of a magnetic-core coil may always be increased compared to an air coil for the same target field.

Title: Optimal Undulatory Swimming with Constrained Deformation and Actuation Intervals
Authors: Fumiya Tokoro, Hideki Takayama, Shinji Deguchi, Andreas Zöttl, Daiki Matsunaga
Abstract: In nature, many unicellular organisms are able to swim with the help of beating filaments, where local energy input leads to cooperative undulatory beating motion. Here, we investigate by employing reinforcement learning how undulatory microswimmers modeled as a discretized bead-bend-spring filament actuated by torques which are constrained locally. We show that the competition between actively applied torques and intrinsic bending stiffness leads to various optimal beating patterns characterized by distinct frequencies, amplitudes, and wavelengths. Interestingly, the optimum solutions depend on the action interval, i.e.\ the time scale how fast the microswimmer can \rev{change the applied torques} based on its internal state. We show that optimized stiffness- and action-interval-dependent beating is realized by bang-bang solutions of the applied torques with distinct optimum time-periodicity and phase shift between consecutive joints, which we analyze in detail by a systematic study of possible bang-bang wave solution patterns of applied torques. Our work not only sheds light on how efficient beating patterns of biological microswimmers can emerge based on internal and local constraints, but also offers actuation policies for potential artificial elastic microswimmers.

Abstract: We engineer lumped-element superconducting resonators that maximize magnetic coupling to molecular spin qubits, achieving record single-spin couplings up to 100 kHz and collective couplings exceeding 10 MHz. The resonators were made interact with PTMr organic free radicals, model spin systems with $S=1/2$ and a quasi-isotropic $g \simeq 2$, dispersed in polymer matrices. The highest collective spin-photon coupling strengths are attained with resonators having large inductors, which therefore interact with most spins in the molecular ensemble. By contrast, the coupling of each individual spin $G_{1}$ is maximized in resonators having a minimum size inductor, made of a single microwire. The same platform has been used to study spin relaxation and spin coherent dynamics in the dispersive regime, when spins are energetically detuned from the resonator. We find evidences for the Purcell effect, i.e. the photon induced relaxation of those spins that are most strongly coupled to the circuit. The rate of this process has been used to infer the distribution of single spin photon couplings in a given device. For resonators with a 50 nm wide constriction fabricated at the center of its single maximum $G_{1}$ values reach $\sim 100$ kHz. Pumping the spins with strong pulses fed through an independent transmission line induces coherent Rabi oscillations. The spin excitation then proceeds via either direct resonant processes induced by the main pulse frequency or, in the case of square-shaped pulses, via the excitation of the cavity by side frequency components. The latter process measures the cavity mode hybridization with the spins and can be eliminated by using Gaussian shaped pulses. These results establish a scalable route toward integrated molecular-spin quantum processors.

Title: Black hole interiors of homogeneous holographic solids under shear strain
Authors: Yuanceng Xu, Li Li, Wei-Jia Li
Abstract: We investigate the interior of AdS black holes under finite shear strain in a class of holographic axion models, which are widely used to describe strongly-coupled systems with broken translations. We demonstrate that the shear anisotropy necessarily eliminates the inner Cauchy horizon, such that the deformed black hole approaches a space like singularity. The anisotropic effect induced by the axion fields triggers a collapse of the Einstein-Rosen bridge at the would-be Cauchy horizon, accompanied by a rapid change in the anisotropy of the spatial geometry. In addition, for a power-law axion potential, sufficiently large shear deformations give rise to a domain wall solution that includes a Lifshitz like scaling geometry near the boundary as well as a near horizon Kasner epoch with the Kasner exponents determined by the powers of the potential. Finally, we find that the interior dynamics of black holes generally enter an era described by an anisotropic Kasner universe at later interior time. Depending on the form of the potential, they either tend to stable Kasner universes, or exhibit an endless alternation of different Kasner epochs toward the singularity.

Title: New avenues for characterizing individual mineralized collagen fibrils with transmission electron microscopy
Authors: Tatiana Kochetkova, Stephanie M. Ribet, Lilian M. Vogl, Daniele Casari, Rohan Dhall, Philippe K. Zysset, Andrew M. Minor, Peter Schweizer
Abstract: Bone serves as a remarkable example of nature's architectured material with its unique blend of strength and toughness, all at a lightweight design. Given the hierarchical nature of these materials, it is essential to understand the governing mechanisms and organization of its constituents across length scales for bio-inspired structural design. Despite recent advances in transmission electron miscoscopy (TEM) that have allowed us to witness the fascinating arrangement of bone at micro- down to the nano-scale, we are still missing the details about the structural organization and mechanical properties of the main building blocks of bone - mineralized collagen fibrils (MCFs). Here, we propose a novel approach for extracting individual MCFs from nature's model material via a dropcasting procedure. By isolating the MCFs onto TEM-compatible substrates, we visualized the arrangement of organic and mineral phases within the individual MCFs at the nanoscale. Using a 4D-STEM approach, the orientation of individual mineral crystals within the MCFs was examined. Furthermore, we conducted first-of-its-kind in situ tensile experiments, revealing exceptional tensile strains of at least 8%, demonstrating the intricate relationship between structural organization and the mechanical behavior of MCFs. The capabilities of TEM allow us to resolve MCF organization and composition down to the nanoscale level. This new knowledge of the ultrastructure of the bone-building blocks and the proposed sample extraction and in situ mechanical testing opens up new avenues for research into nature's inspired material design.

Title: A Self Propelled Vortex Dipole Model on a Catenoid
Authors: Khushi Banthia, Rickmoy Samanta
Abstract: We investigate vortex dipoles on surfaces of variable negative curvature, focusing on a catenoid of arbitrary throat radius as a concrete example. We construct the effective dynamical system including mutual and geometric self-interaction terms and show that the resulting Hamiltonian dynamics makes dipoles follow catenoid geodesics, in agreement with recent works, Gustafsson (J. Nonlinear Sci. 32, 62, 2022) and by Drivas, Glukhovskiy and Khesin (Int. Math. Res. Not. 2024, 14, 10880-10894). We utilize the symplectic structure to find a conserved momentum map J related to the U(1) symmetry along the azimuthal direction. We verify the conservation of both the Hamiltonian and this momentum for arbitrary throat radius. We then demonstrate direct and exchange scattering of classical vortices on the catenoid, and we contrast this with the collective rotational motion (with azimuthal drift) that arises for chiral pairs. Finally, we build a finite-dipole dynamical system on the catenoid and show that the self-propulsion terms emerge to leading order in the dipole size. This provides a concrete realization, on a curved minimal surface, of the intuitive statement that a finite dipole propels orthogonal to the dipole axis, with a speed modulated by curvature.

Title: Large deviations of spectral determinants of matrix-valued random Schrödinger operators and Dyson Brownian motion in cubic potentials
Authors: Yan Fyodorov, Pierre Le Doussal, Alexander Ossipov
Abstract: We study the moments of $\overline{|\det(H-E)|^q}$ and the associated large deviations of $\log |\det(H-E)|$ where $H$ are random matrix operators involving Laplace operators and random potentials. This includes as a special case Hessians of random elastic manifolds at a generic energy configuration. In one dimension $d=1$ these are $N \times N$ matrix valued random Schrödinger operators and $\log | \det(H-E) | $ is the sum of the $N$ associated Lyapunov exponents. Using a mapping to a stochastic matrix Ricatti equation we make a connection between the spectral properties of these operators and the total $N$ particle current of a Dyson Brownian motion (DBM) in a cubic potential. The latter model was studied by Allez and Dumaz [1] who showed that for $N=+\infty$ it exhibits a sharp transition between a phase with non-zero current and a confined (zero current) phase. We compute the barrier-crossing probability of the DBM at large but finite $N$, which gives an estimate of the exponential tail of the average density of states of a matrix Schrodinger operator below the edge of its spectrum. The barrier behaves as $\sim N (-E)^{3/2}$ at large negative energy and vanishes as $\sim N(E^*-E)^{5/4}$ near the edge. For $q=1$ the present work provides an independent derivation of the total complexity of stationary points for an elastic string embedded in $N$ dimension in presence of disorder.

Title: Binary perceptron computational gap -- a parametric fl RDT view
Authors: Mihailo Stojnic
Abstract: Recent studies suggest that asymmetric binary perceptron (ABP) likely exhibits the so-called statistical-computational gap characterized with the appearance of two phase transitioning constraint density thresholds: \textbf{\emph{(i)}} the \emph{satisfiability threshold} $\alpha_c$, below/above which ABP succeeds/fails to operate as a storage memory; and \textbf{\emph{(ii)}} \emph{algorithmic threshold} $\alpha_a$, below/above which one can/cannot efficiently determine ABP's weight so that it operates as a storage memory. We consider a particular parametric utilization of \emph{fully lifted random duality theory} (fl RDT) [85] and study its potential ABP's algorithmic implications. A remarkable structural parametric change is uncovered as one progresses through fl RDT lifting levels. On the first two levels, the so-called $\c$ sequence -- a key parametric fl RDT component -- is of the (natural) decreasing type. A change of such phenomenology on higher levels is then connected to the $\alpha_c$ -- $\alpha_a$ threshold change. Namely, on the second level concrete numerical values give for the critical constraint density $\alpha=\alpha_c\approx 0.8331$. While progressing through higher levels decreases this estimate, already on the fifth level we observe a satisfactory level of convergence and obtain $\alpha\approx 0.7764$. This allows to draw two striking parallels: \textbf{\emph{(i)}} the obtained constraint density estimate is in a remarkable agrement with range $\alpha\in (0.77,0.78)$ of clustering defragmentation (believed to be responsible for failure of locally improving algorithms) [17,88]; and \textbf{\emph{(ii)}} the observed change of $\c$ sequence phenomenology closely matches the one of the negative Hopfield model for which the existence of efficient algorithms that closely approach similar type of threshold has been demonstrated recently [87].

Title: Fast and Robust Remote Two-Qubit Gates on Distributed Qubits
Authors: Yunan Li, Xi Zhang, Weixin Zhang, Ruonan Guo, Yu Zhang, Xinsheng Tan, Yang Yu
Abstract: Distributed quantum computing offers a potential solution to the complexity of superconducting chip hardware layouts and error correction algorithms. High-quality gates between distributed chips enable the simplification of existing error correction algorithms. This article proposes and demonstrates a remote quantum geometric gate scheme via parametric modulation. Our scheme inherits the intrinsic robustness of geometric phases. Meanwhile, by employing gradient-based optimization algorithms(Adaptive Moment Estimation) from deep learning, we design control waveforms that significantly suppress population leakage. We experimentally realize the rapid remote SWAP and $\sqrt{\text{SWAP}}$ gates with high fidelity, completing operation in about 30 ns. The gate error of SWAP ($\sqrt{\text{SWAP}}$) is 1.16\% (0.91\%) after excluding the effect of energy relaxation. The simulation demonstrate that this scheme can be implemented in the distributed chips connected by cables extending several meters. Our results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed protocol in enabling modular quantum processors, offering a promising path toward the realization of fault-tolerant quantum computation.

Title: A fast and rigorous numerical tool to measure length-scale artifacts in molecular simulations
Authors: Benedikt M. Reible, Nils Liebreich, Carsten Hartmann, Luigi Delle Site
Abstract: The two-sided Bogoliubov inequality for classical and quantum many-body systems is a theorem that provides rigorous bounds on the free-energy cost of partitioning a given system into two or more independent subsystems. This theorem motivates the definition of a quality factor which directly quantifies the degree of statistical-mechanical consistency achieved by a given simulation box size. A major technical merit of the theorem is that, for systems with two-body interactions and a known radial distribution function, the quality factor can be computed by evaluating just two six-dimensional integrals. In this work, we present a numerical algorithm for computing the quality factor and demonstrate its consistency with respect to results in the literature obtained from simulations performed at different box sizes.

Title: Multidimensional Soliton Systems: an Update
Authors: Boris A. Malomed
Abstract: A briefly formulated update of the recently published review [1] on the topic of multidimensional solitons (chiefly, in nonlinear optics and atomic Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs)) is presented. The update briefly summarizes some notable results on this topic that have been reported very recently, and offers a compact outline of the directions of the current experiment and theoretical work in this and related fields. In particular, as concerns newest experimental findings, included are the creation of multiple quantum droplets in prolate BEC, and the observation of expanding toroidal light structures in linear optics. The update of theoretical results includes the analysis of 2D solitons in the optical system with the quadratic nonlinearity and fractional diffraction, and the prediction of stable 3D vortex solitons in various BEC schemes with long-range interactions.

Title: Large spin signal and spin rectification in folded-bilayer graphene
Authors: Md. Anamul Hoque, Zoltán Kovács-Krausz, Bing Zhao, Prasanna Rout, Ivan Vera Marun, Szabolcs Csonka, Péter Makk, Saroj P. Dash
Abstract: Graphene is an exceptional platform for spin-based non-volatile memory, logic, and neuromorphic computing by combining long-distance spin transport with electrical tunability at room temperature. However, advancing beyond passive spin channels requires devices capable of generating large spin signals with efficient rectification capabilities, which are essential for active spintronic components. Here, we demonstrate a folded-bilayer graphene spin-valve device with giant non-local spin signals in the several mV range with pronounced spin-rectification effects. The efficient spin injection creates a giant spin accumulation of 20 meV, and generates a spin-diode effect with an asymmetry of over an order of magnitude between forward and reverse bias conditions. This spin-diode effect arises from the nonlinear coupling between large spin accumulation and the applied electric field. These large spin signals, together with the spin-diode effect, are achieved with folded-bilayer graphene, offering a promising platform for developing active ultrathin two-dimensional spintronic devices.

Title: 2D or not 2D: a "holographic dictionary'' for Lowest Landau Levels
Authors: Gautam Mandal, Ajay Mohan, Rushikesh Suroshe
Abstract: We consider 2D fermions on a plane with a perpendicular magnetic field, described by Landau levels. It is wellknown that, semiclassically, restriction to the lowest Landau levels (LLL) implies two constraints on a 4D phase space, that transforms the 2D coordinate space (x,y) into a 2D phase space, thanks to the non-zero Dirac bracket between x and y. A naive application of Dirac's prescription of quantizing LLL in terms of L2 functions of x (or of y) fails because the wavefunctions are functions of x and y. We are able, however, to construct a 1D QM, sitting differently inside the 2D QM, which describes the LLL physics. The construction includes an exact 1D-2D correspondence between the fermion density \rho(x,y) and the Wigner distribution of the 1D QM. In a suitable large N limit, (a) the Wigner distribution is upper bounded by 1, since a phase space cell can have at most one fermion (Pauli exclusion principle) and (b) the 1D-2D correspondence becomes an identity transformation. (a) and (b) imply an upper bound for the fermion density \rho(x,y). We also explore the entanglement entropy (EE) of subregions of the 2D noncommutative space. It behaves differently from conventional 2D systems as well as conventional 1D systems, falling somewhere between the two. The main new feature of the EE, directly attributable to the noncommutative space, is the absence of a logarithmic dependence on the size of the entangling region, even though there is a Fermi surface. In this paper, instead of working directly with the Landau problem, we consider a more general problem, of 2D fermions in a rotating harmonic trap, which reduces to the Landau problem in a special limit. Among other consequences of the emergent 1D physics, we find that post-quench dynamics of the (generalized) LLL system is computed more simply in 1D terms, which is described by well-developed methods of 2D phase space hydrodynamics.

Title: A Multiscale Framework for In Silico Thrombus Generation and Photoacoustic Simulations
Authors: Hamed Ghodsi, Sara Cardona, Behrooz Fereidoonnezhad, Sophinese Iskander-Rizk
Abstract: Thrombus microstructure plays a critical role in determining the treatment success for thrombus-related diseases such as stroke and deep vein thrombosis. However, no in vivo diagnostic method can fully capture thrombus microstructure yet. Photoacoustic imaging is uniquely positioned to provide information on thrombi composition as it relays optical absorption information from diffuse photons at acoustic propagation depths. Computational modeling enables systematic exploration of microstructural effects on imaging signals, offering insights into developing improved in vivo diagnostic techniques. However, no photoacoustic simulation platform can model microstructural features within centimeter-scale phantoms at reasonable computational cost. Here, we present REFINE, a topology-driven framework for generating in silico thrombi replicating its key replicating their key microstructural traits. REFINE enables controlled, recursive optimization of thrombus topology, making it suitable for accurate photoacoustic modeling and potentially powerful for biomechanical analyses. These digital thrombi are embedded into a multiscale photoacoustic simulation platform that bridges microscale acoustic modeling with macroscale thrombus geometries, enabling efficient and realistic simulation of photoacoustic signal responses. We created unique thrombi microstructure for various compositions and porosities. Our simulation framework effectively links microstructural features to macroscale imaging outcomes, in agreement with previous empirical studies. Our results demonstrate that thrombus microstructure significantly affects photoacoustic spectral responses and can be modeled in silico. These findings highlight that multiscale photoacoustic simulation is a powerful tool for characterizing tissue microstructure and that our framework enables in silico thrombi analysis and diagnostic imaging strategy development

Title: Information bounds the robustness of self-organized systems
Authors: Nicolas Romeo, David G. Martin, Mattia Scandolo, Michel Fruchart, Edwin M. Munro, Vincenzo Vitelli
Abstract: Self-assembled systems, from synthetic nanostructures to developing organisms, are composed of fluctuating units capable of forming robust functional structures despite noise. In this Letter we ask: are there fundamental bounds on the robustness of self-organized nano-systems? By viewing self-organization as noisy encoding, we prove that the positional information capacity of short-range classical systems with discrete states obeys a bound reminiscent of area laws for quantum information. This universal bound can be saturated by fine-tuning transport coefficients. When long-range correlations are present, global constraints reduce the need for fine-tuning by providing effective integral feedback. Our work identifies bio-mimetic principles for the self-assembly of synthetic nanosystems and rationalizes, on purely information-theoretic grounds, why scale separation and hierarchical structures are common motifs in biology.

Title: Initial-State Typicality in Quantum Relaxation
Authors: Ruicheng Bao
Abstract: Relaxation in open quantum systems is fundamental to quantum science and technologies. Yet, the influence of the initial state on relaxation remains a central, largely unanswered question. Here, by systematically characterizing the relaxation behavior of generic initial states, we uncover a typicality phenomenon in high-dimensional open quantum systems: relaxation becomes nearly initial-state-independent as system size increases under verifiable conditions. Crucially, we prove this typicality for thermalization processes above a size-independent temperature. Our findings extend the typicality to open quantum dynamics, in turn identifying a class of systems where two widely used quantities -- the Liouvillian gap and the maximal relaxation time -- merit re-examination. We formalize this with two new concepts: the 'typical strong Mpemba effect' and the 'typical relaxation time'. Beyond these conceptual advances, our results provide practical implications: a scalable route to accelerating relaxation and a typical mixing-time benchmark that complements conventional worst-case metrics for quantum simulations and state preparation.

Title: A Synthesizability-Guided Pipeline for Materials Discovery
Authors: Thorben Prein, Willis O'Leary, Aikaterini Flessa Savvidou, Elchaïma Bourneix, Joonatan E. M. Laulainen
Abstract: Computational materials discovery relies on the generation of plausible crystal structures. The plausibility is typically judged through density functional theory methods which, while typically accurate at zero Kelvin, often favor low-energy structures that are not experimentally accessible. We develop a combined compositional and structural synthesizability score which provides an accurate way of predicting which compounds can actually be synthesized in a laboratory. We use it to evaluate non-synthesized structures from the Materials Project, GNoME, and Alexandria, and identified several hundred highly synthesizable candidates. We then predict synthesis pathways, conduct corresponding experiments, and characterize the products across 16 targets, successfully synthesizing 7 of 16. The entire experimental process was completed in only three days. Our results highlight omissions in lists of known synthesized structures, deliver insights into the practical utility of current materials databases, and showcase the central role synthesizability prediction can play in materials discovery.

Title: Kagome on beta-Sb with valley-hot Berry curvature and tunable intrinsic SHC
Authors: Yang Wang
Abstract: Large-area, single-crystalline antimonene polygonal domains self-assemble on Al(111) at room temperature without forming an interfacial alloy layer by MBE. Beyond the beta-Sb phase,with increasing deposition, once the beta-Sb coverage surpasses a threshold, we observe a previously unreported kagome-Sb overlayer. STM height maps and line profiles track a phase evolution from an enlarged-period honeycomb to a close-packed layer and ultimately a kagome lattice. XPS peak not only shows resolves a time-dependent redistribution of Sb-related components that quantitatively mirrors the STM-observed phase sequence, but also revals the substrate core levels remain unchanged, ruling out interfacial alloying throughout growth. ARPES of beta-Sb resolves a Dirac-like crossing at Gamma around -1.4 eV, in agreement with first-principles calculations. Although beta-Sb is Z2-trivial and the heterostructure is metallic, Wannier-based calculations reveal valley-contrasting Berry-curvature hotspots, yielding an intrinsic spin Hall conductivity that is strongly Fermi-level dependent. These results demonstrate a reproducible kagome-Sb/beta-Sb heterophase interface and uncover a controllable spin-orbit-driven response in a homoelemental 2D system.

Abstract: Extreme pressures and temperatures create conditions that allow even hard and brittle materials to deform plastically. Despite extensive research, the upper limits of flow strength, the resistance to plastic flow, remain uncertain, and the mechanisms driving deformation at the relevant stresses are a subject of debate. Using femtosecond in situ X-ray diffraction experiments and large-scale molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that stacking fault-mediated strengthening enables shock-compressed nano-polycrystalline diamond to achieve a peak flow strength of 107+-5 GPa at a stress of 227+-8 GPa. Our findings show that extreme conditions can unlock unusual strength via mechanisms that can be used as design tools in targeted applications.

Title: Relevance of long-range screening in Mott transition examined via a hydrogen lattice
Authors: Zi-Jian Lang, Sudeshna Sen, Pak Ki Henry Tsang, Kristjan Haule, Vladimir Dobrosavljević, Wei Ku
Abstract: The Mott transition, a metal-insulator transition due to strong electronic interaction, is observed in many materials without an accompanying change of system symmetry. An important open question in Mott's proposal is the role of long-range screening, whose drastic change across the quantum phase transition may self-consistently make the transition more abrupt, toward a first-order one. Here we investigate this effect in a model system of hydrogen atoms in a cubic lattice, using charge self-consistent dynamical mean-field theory that incorporates approximately the long-range interaction within the density functional treatment. We found that the system is well within the charge-transfer regime and that the charge-transfer gap intimately related to the Mott transition closes smoothly instead. This indicates that the long-range screening does not play an essential role in this prototypical example. This finding can be understood from the fact that the obtained insulating phase in this model system is driven by strong local interaction, and the transition is associated with the closing of charge-transfer gap. Contrary to Mott's length scale argument, such energetic competition between kinetic energy and \textit{local} interaction is thus insensitive to long-range screening.

Abstract: A supersolid is a quantum-entangled state of matter exhibiting the dual characteristics of superfluidity and solidity. Theory predicts that hard-core bosons with repulsive interactions on a triangular lattice can form supersolid phases at half filling and near complete filling. Leveraging an exact mapping between bosons and spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ degrees of freedom, we investigate these phases in the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ triangular-lattice antiferromagnet \K212 with exchange constants $J_z = 2.96(2)$~meV and $J_{\perp} = 0.21(3)$~meV. At zero field, neutron diffraction reveals the gradual development for $T<15$~K of quasi-two-dimensional $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ magnetic order with $Z_3$ translational symmetry breaking (solidity) albeit with 44(5)% reduced amplitude at $T=0.3$~K indicating strong quantum fluctuations. These are apparent in equidistant bands of continuum neutron scattering for $\hslash\omega_n\approx n\times J_z$, where $n=0,1,2,3$. The lowest energy ($n=0$) $\bf Q$-dependent continuum has a lower resonant edge and includes a quasi-elastic component at K $(\frac{1}{3}\frac{1}{3})$ consistent with broken $U(1)$ spin rotational symmetry (boson superfluidity). Competing instabilities are apparent in soft albeit finite-energy modes at M $(\frac{1}{2}0)$ and at $\frac{1}{2}$K $(\frac{1}{6}\frac{1}{6})$. For $\bf c$-axis-oriented magnetic fields $17~{\rm T} <\mu_0 H< 21~{\rm T}$ that almost saturate the magnetization, corresponding to nearly filling the lattice with bosons, we find a new phase consistent with a second supersolid. These phases are separated by a pronounced 1/3 magnetization plateau that supports coherent spin waves, from which we determine the spin Hamiltonian.

Title: Single-Ion Sensing in Liquid Using Fluorescent h-BN Point Defects
Authors: Yecun Wu, Kun Xu, Hori Pada Sarker, Takashi Taniguchi, Kenji Watanabe, Frank Abild-Pedersen, Arun Majumdar, Yi Cui, Yan-Kai Tzeng, Steven Chu
Abstract: Understanding the chemical state of individual ions in solutions is crucial for advancing knowledge of complex systems. However, sensing systems at the single-ion level in liquid environments remains a significant challenge. A strategy is introduced that leverages the optical emission properties of point defects in hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) as single ion sensors. The interaction of optically active h-BN defects with ions in solution leads to distinct spectral shifts, enabling precise visualization and analyzing of individual ions. Using Li+ ions in organic electrolytes as a model, spectral shifts exceeding 10 nm were observed upon ion addition. Application of an external electric field further enhanced these shifts to over 40 nm, enabling real-time monitoring of electrical field induced local perturbations of Li+ ions. Through this approach, individual point defects were shown to spectroscopically distinguish ions of varying charges (e.g., Na+, Mg2+, and Al3+) based on their local electrical field, each producing a distinct spectral shift. This platform allows direct sensing of ions and their chemical states in liquid environments, providing insights into subtle interfacial changes at the single-ion level, with measurable spectral shifts detectable at millisecond temporal resolution and at concentrations down to 10 micromolar range. This capability presents potential applications in various fields involving ions in liquids that include battery technology and environmental science.

Title: Diffusive hydrodynamics from long-range correlations
Authors: Friedrich Hübner, Leonardo Biagetti, Jacopo De Nardis, Benjamin Doyon
Abstract: In the hydrodynamic theory, the non-equilibrium dynamics of a many-body system is approximated, at large scales of space and time, by irreversible relaxation to local entropy maximisation. This results in a convective equation corrected by viscous or diffusive terms in a gradient expansion, such as the Navier-Stokes equations. Diffusive terms are evaluated using the Kubo formula, and possibly arising from an emergent noise due to discarded microscopic degrees of freedom. In one dimension of space, diffusive scaling is often broken as noise leads to super-diffusion. But in linearly degenerate hydrodynamics, such as that of integrable models, diffusive behaviors are observed, and it has long be thought that the standard diffusive picture remains valid. In this letter, we show that in such systems, the Navier-Stokes equation breaks down beyond linear response. We demonstrate that diffusive-order corrections do not take the form of a gradient expansion. Instead, they are completely determined by ballistic transport of initial-state fluctuations, and obtained from the non-local two-point correlations recently predicted by the ballistic macroscopic fluctuation theory (BMFT); the resulting hydrodynamic equations are reversible. To do so, we establish a regularised fluctuation theory, putting on a firm basis the recent idea that ballistic transport of initial-state fluctuations determines fluctuations and correlations beyond the Euler scale. This extends the idea of ``diffusion from convection'' previously developed to explain the Kubo formula in integrable systems, to generic non-equilibrium settings.

Title: Geometric Frustration Assisted Kinetic Ferromagnetism in Doped Mott Insulators
Authors: Qianqian Chen, Shuai A. Chen, Zheng Zhu
Abstract: Understanding ferromagnetism mechanism in doped Mott insulators on frustrated lattices remains challenging at intermediate coupling and finite doping. Here, we study the itinerant ferromagnetism and propose its mechanism in doped Mott insulators on a geometrically frustrated triangular lattice. Using large-scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) and unrestricted Hartree-Fock mean-field methods, we reveal that itinerant ferromagnetism appears at intermediate coupling ($10\lesssim U\ll\infty$) near 50% electron doping in the triangular-lattice Hubbard model. By analyzing all microscopic hopping processes, we find that doublon-singlon exchange alone drives the fully polarized ferromagnetism and uncovers the particle-hole asymmetry. We also establish the magnetic phase diagram and compare local spin correlations with recent experiments. Random phase approximation and DMRG calculations consistently confirm that the ferromagnetism persists when $SU(2)$ symmetry is explicitly broken by magnetic anisotropy. These results clarify a microscopic route to itinerant ferromagnetism at intermediate coupling and finite doping in doped Mott insulators.

Title: Entanglement and confinement: A new pairing mechanism in high-T_{C} cuprates
Authors: Felix A. Buot, Roland E. S. Otadoy, Unofre Pili
Abstract: We demonstrate that entanglement and confinement hole pairing (ECHP) is a precise physics of the entanglement framework of the RVB theory of high-Tc cuprates. Our novel strong ECHP mechanism explains the entire phase diagram of both electron and hole-doped cuprates, notably the linearly decreasing T* at the pseudogap, the duality of the spin gap and strange metal phase, the Tc=T* at the optimum doping and the rest of the overdoped regions of the superconducting (SC) dome, the presence of the parallel superconducting stripes in the CuO plane (spin-polarized and spin-unpolarized channels), and the linear-T behavior of the strange metal phase above the overdoped regions of the SC dome. This also explains the experimental spin textures of the cuprates. We refer to our new ECHP model as a resonating entanglement and confinement hole pair (RECHP) theory. Based on RECHP theory, we were able to provide a conceptual and comprehensive qualitative explanation of the entire phase diagram, thus providing the sought-after mechanism responsible for the entire phase diagram of high-Tc cuprates

Title: Interplay of Tilt and Axion Fields in Topological Superconductors: Anisotropy in the Meissner Effect
Authors: Mojtaba Hassani, Zahra Faraei
Abstract: Topological superconductors host gapless surface states that fundamentally alter their electromagnetic response through the axion field term $\theta \vec{E}\cdot\vec{B}$, arising from the topological magnetoelectric effect. In this work, we investigate the electromagnetic properties of a three-dimensional topological Weyl superconductor by leveraging its theoretical mapping to a four-dimensional topological insulator with s-wave superconducting boundaries. By incorporating the tilt of Weyl cones into this model, we demonstrate that the tilt vector $\vec\zeta$ anisotropically modifies the axion field profile near the surface, leading to a tilt-enhanced Meissner effect and anomalous magnetic penetration depths. We show that the magnetic field component perpendicular to the tilt direction exhibits a non-exponential, hypergeometric decay dictated by the interplay between the axion term and $\vec\zeta$, while the parallel component remains largely tilt-insensitive--a hallmark of axion-mediated anisotropy absent in trivial superconductors. Remarkably, all tilt-dependent electromagnetic responses follow a universal scaling law, revealing a fundamental symmetry in the system's behavior. Furthermore, we predict a tilt-dependent planar Hall current at the surface, directly tied to the topological surface states.

Title: Evidence of anisotropic three-dimensional weak-localization in TiSe$_{2}$ nanoflakes
Authors: Xiaocui Wang, Yang Yang, Yongkai Li, Guangtong Liu, Junxi Duan, Zhiwei Wang, Li Lu, Fan Yang
Abstract: TiSe$_2$ is a typical transition-metal dichalcogenide known for its charge-density wave order. In this study, we report the observation of an unusual anisotropic negative magnetoresistance in exfoliated TiSe$_2$ nanoflakes at low temperatures. Unlike the negative magnetoresistance reported in most other transition-metal dichalcogenides, our results cannot be explained by either the conventional two-dimensional weak localization effect or the Kondo effect. A comprehensive analysis of the data suggests that the observed anisotropic negative magnetoresistance in TiSe$_2$ flakes is most likely caused by the three-dimensional weak localization effect. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the phase-coherent transport processes in TiSe$_2$.

Title: Dirac points and Weyl phase in a honeycomb altermagnet
Authors: Zhang Meng-Han, Guo Xuan, Dao-Xin Yao
Abstract: We present unconventional nodal crossings in a two-dimensional (2D) collinear altermagnet, which are enforced by crystal symmetries to lock spin polarization and valley degrees of freedom. The altermagnetism generate nonrelativistic spin-splitting in honeycomb antiferromagnets, guaranteeing novel band degeneracies between bands sharing identical spin configurations yet different sublattices. Inspired by the $XPS_{3}$ (X=Mn, Fe, Ni) materials, we demonstrate distinctive Berry curvature distributions concentrating intensely at Weyl nodes, which further generalize the locking between valleys and Berry curvature. Topological phase transitions are characterized by the high Chern numbers preserving the non-intersecting flows of Wannier centers over occupied bands, where degeneracy lifting contributes to unconventional spin textures to induce the valley Hall effect. Our results yield unique topological nodes via leveraging the crystal symmetry constraints with the intrinsic time-reversal symmetry breaking, where corresponding topological responses enable the potential of advancing spintronics. Our results yield unique topological nodes without the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) achieved by combining crystal symmetry constraints with inherent time-reversal symmetry breaking, whose associated topological responses enable promising applications in spintronics.

Title: Continuous order-to-order quantum phase transitions from fixed-point annihilation
Authors: David Jonas Moser, Lukas Janssen
Abstract: A central concept in the theory of phase transitions beyond the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson paradigm is fractionalization: the formation of new quasiparticles that interact via emergent gauge fields. This concept has been extensively explored in the context of continuous quantum phase transitions between distinct orders that break different symmetries. We propose a mechanism for continuous order-to-order quantum phase transitions that operates independently of fractionalization. This mechanism is based on the collision and annihilation of two renormalization group fixed points: a quantum critical fixed point and an infrared stable fixed point. The annihilation of these fixed points rearranges the flow topology, eliminating the disordered phase associated with the infrared stable fixed point and promoting a second critical fixed point, unaffected by the collision, to a quantum critical point between distinct orders. We argue that this mechanism is relevant to a broad spectrum of physical systems. In particular, it can manifest in Luttinger fermion systems in three spatial dimensions, leading to a continuous quantum phase transition between an antiferromagnetic Weyl semimetal state, which breaks time-reversal symmetry, and a nematic topological insulator, characterized by broken lattice rotational symmetry. This continuous antiferromagnetic-Weyl-to-nematic-insulator transition might be observed in rare-earth pyrochlore iridates $R_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$. Other possible realizations include kagome quantum magnets, quantum impurity models, and quantum chromodynamics with supplemental four-fermion interactions.

Title: Entanglement Hamiltonian and orthogonal polynomials
Authors: Pierre-Antoine Bernard, Riccarda Bonsignori, Viktor Eisler, Gilles Parez, Luc Vinet
Abstract: We study the entanglement Hamiltonian for free-fermion chains with a particular form of inhomogeneity. The hopping amplitudes and chemical potentials are chosen such that the single-particle eigenstates are related to discrete orthogonal polynomials of the Askey scheme. Due to the bispectral properties of these functions, one can construct an operator which commutes exactly with the entanglement Hamiltonian and corresponds to a linear or parabolic deformation of the physical one. We show that this deformation is interpreted as a local inverse temperature and can be obtained in the continuum limit via methods of conformal field theory. Using this prediction, the properly rescaled eigenvalues of the commuting operator are found to provide a very good approximation of the entanglement spectrum and entropy.

Title: Multiferroic Dark Excitonic Mott Insulator in the Breathing-Kagome Lattice Material Nb$_3$Cl$_8$
Authors: Mahtab A. Khan, Naseem Ud Din, Dmitry Skachkov, Dirk R. Englund, Michael N. Leuenberger
Abstract: Flat electronic bands strongly enhance Coulomb interactions and can stabilize unconventional insulating states. Motivated by the recent discovery of flat bands in breathing Kagome lattices, we use first-principles GW--Bethe--Salpeter theory to investigate the excitonic spectrum of single-layer Nb$_3$Cl$_8$. We find a dark spin-triplet Frenkel exciton whose spectral peak lies at negative energy ($-0.14$~eV) relative to the quasiparticle gap, directly signaling a preformed bound state and an excitonic Mott insulating phase potentially stable at room temperature. Bright excitons appear at $0.94$~eV and $1.21$~eV, with ultra-large binding energies of $2.05$~eV and $1.77$~eV. By mapping the low-energy dynamics onto a spin-1 Hubbard model on a triangular lattice, we show that frustrated antiferromagnetic and ferroelectric tendencies naturally emerge. These results identify Nb$_3$Cl$_8$ as a candidate multiferroic dark excitonic insulator, opening a pathway to correlated quantum phases in two dimensions.

Title: Probing the collective excitations of excitonic insulators in an optical cavity
Authors: Elahe Davari, Mehdi Kargarian
Abstract: The light--matter interaction in optical cavities offers a promising ground to create hybrid states and manipulate material properties. In this work, we examine the effect of light-matter coupling in the excitonic insulator phase using a quasi one-dimensional lattice model with two opposite parity orbitals at each site. We show that the model allows for a coupling between the collective phase mode and cavity photons. Our findings reveal that the collective mode of the excitonic state significantly impacts the dispersion of the cavity mode, giving rise to an avoiding band crossing in the photon dispersion. This phenomenon is absent in trivial and topological insulator phases and also in phonon-mediated excitonic insulators, underscoring the unique characteristics of collective excitations in excitonic insulators. Our results demonstrate the significant impact of light-matter interaction on photon propagation in the presence of excitonic collective excitations.

Title: Anomalous Nernst effect in Co thin films under laser irradiation
Authors: Soichiro Mochizuki, Itaru Sugiura, Tetsuya Narushima, Teruo Ono, Takuya Satoh, Kihiro T. Yamada
Abstract: The anomalous Nernst effect (ANE) generates electromotive forces transverse to temperature gradients and has attracted much attention for potential applications into alternative thermoelectric power generators. ANE efficiency is generally characterized by uniform temperature gradients in a steady state prepared by heaters. However, although focusing laser beams on a magnetic film can form much larger temperature gradients, the laser-irradiation method has not been sufficiently considered for quantifying the ANE coefficient due to the difficulty in estimating the localized in-homogeneous temperature gradients. In this study, we present a quantitative study of ANE in Ru(5 nm)/Co($t_{\mathrm{Co}}$) ($t_{\mathrm{Co}}$ = 3, 5, 7, 10, 20, 40, and 60 nm) bilayers on sapphire (0001) substrates by combining a laser irradiation approach with finite-element analysis of temperature gradients under laser excitation. We find that the estimated ANE coefficients are consistent with previously reported values and one independently characterized using a heater. Our results also reveal the advantages of the laser irradiation method over the conventional method using heaters. Intensity-modulated laser beams can create ac temperature gradients as large as approximately 10$^3$ K/mm at a frequency of tens of kilohertz in a micrometer-scale region.

Title: Spin correlations in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ superconducting thin films

Abstract: The discovery of ambient-pressure superconductivity with $T_{c,\text{onset}} > 40$ K in {\LNO} (LNO) thin films grown on the SrLaAlO$_4$ (SLAO) substrate with compressive ($\varepsilon\approx-2\%$) epitaxial strain provides a unique platform for investigating the superconducting mechanisms in nickelate superconductors. Here, we use resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) to unveil the dispersive spin excitations in the LNO/SLAO superconducting thin film and establish the strain dependence of the electronic and spin excitations in LNO thin films with strain ranging from $\varepsilon\approx-2\%$ to $+1.9\%$. Compared with the bulk crystal, the LNO/SLAO thin film (with $\varepsilon\approx-2\%$) exhibits similar $dd$ excitations and spin dynamics with larger bandwidth. By contrast, tensile-strained LNO/SrTiO$_3$ ($\varepsilon \approx +1.9\%$) exhibits a marked suppression of both the spin excitations and the Ni 3{\dz}-derived $dd$ excitations. The strain dependence of the spin excitations reflects significant changes in the interlayer exchange coupling $J_z$, and the diminishing $dd$ excitations in tensile-strained samples indicate weaker Ni 3{\dz}-O 2$p_{z}$ hybridization. This strain evolution of the spin excitations and $J_z$ is attributed to the strain-tuned $c$-axis Ni-O-Ni bond angle $\varphi$, which controls the Ni 3{\dz}-O 2$p_{z}$ hybridization. Since superconductivity is observed only in films grown on SLAO, and spin correlations are enhanced along with the emergence of superconductivity, our results identify $\varphi$ as a key structural lever controlling $J_z$ and provide direct spectroscopic support for interlayer spin-fluctuation-mediated pairing scenarios in bilayer nickelates.

Title: Interaction-induced reentrance of Bose glass and quench dynamics of Bose gases in twisted bilayer and quasicrystal optical lattices
Authors: Shi-Hao Ding, Li-Jun Lang, Qizhong Zhu, Liang He
Abstract: We investigate the ground-state and dynamical properties of ultracold Bose gases in optical lattices with a quasicrystal structure, inspired by recent experiments on twisted bilayer and quasicrystalline optical lattices. The interplay between on-site repulsive interactions and the quasiperiodic potential leads to rich physics. At low filling factors, increasing the interaction strength induces a delocalization effect that transforms a Bose-glass (BG) phase-characterized by disconnected superfluid (SF) regions-into a robust SF phase with a percolated network of SF clusters. This transition is quantitatively identified via the percolation probability. At higher filling factors, we uncover a reentrant behavior: with increasing interaction, the system first changes from BG to SF, but further strengthening reverses the trend, restoring the BG phase. This reentrance originates from an interaction-driven rearrangement of particles, where a percolated SF network fragments into isolated SF islands as repulsion dominates. The quench dynamics show distinct transient features: intraphase quenches cause minor variations in the percolation probability and the inverse participation ratio (IPR), while interphase quenches produce strong responses. In particular, an SF-to-BG quench exhibits an abrupt loss of global SF connectivity, whereas a BG-to-SF quench shows oscillatory percolation and a gradual IPR decrease, stabilizing the SF phase. These results elucidate the competition between quasiperiodicity and interactions in ultracold Bose gases and offer insights relevant to current experiments with twisted bilayer and quasicrystal optical lattices.

Title: Active Turbulence in Shear Thinning Fluid
Authors: Hongyi Bian, Chunhe Li, Zixiang Lin, Jin Zhu, Weijie Chen, Gaojin Li, Yongxiang Huang, Zijie Qu
Abstract: The study of active matter system has critical importance in revealing the physical essence of biological collective behavior. Dense bacterial suspension - a typical biological active matter, exhibits a wide range of phenomenons, among which bacterial turbulence has received extensive interest in recent years. This seemingly chaotic motion is widely studied in Newtonian fluid. However, studies based on complex fluids have predominantly focused on viscoelastic effects, leaving the role of shear-thinning viscosity largely unexplored despite its prevalence in natural bacterial environments like mucus and gastric fluids. Here, we experimentally employed Ficoll and Methocel polymers to study the impacts of various viscosities by Newtonian fluid and shear-thinning effects by Non-Newtonian fluids on bacterial turbulence. We analyzed various physical properties, including energy, enstrophy, etc., and observed that the shear-thinning effect is significantly suppressed in high-concentration bacterial suspensions. While the ordered arrangement of polymer chains under shear flow leads to the microscopic anisotropic viscosity, the suppression is largely attributed to the disruption of polymer chains caused by strong inter bacterial interactions in dense suspensions. To validate this hypothesis, we conducted experiments at a lower bacterial concentration and verified the findings using theoretical calculations based on the modified Resistive Force Theory.

Title: Active wave-particle clusters
Authors: Rahil N. Valani, David M. Paganin
Abstract: Active particles are non-equilibrium entities that uptake energy and convert it into self-propulsion. A dynamically rich class of inertial active particles having features of wave-particle coupling and wave memory are walking/superwalking droplets. Such classical, active wave-particle entities (WPEs) have previously been shown to exhibit hydrodynamic analogs of many single-particle quantum systems. Inspired by the rich dynamics of strongly interacting superwalking droplets in experiments, we numerically investigate the dynamics of WPE clusters using a stroboscopic model. We find that several interacting WPEs self-organize into a stable bound cluster, reminiscent of an atomic nucleus. This active cluster exhibits a rich spectrum of collective excitations, including shape oscillations and chiral rotating modes, akin to vibrational and rotational modes of nuclear excitations, as the spatial extent of the waves and their temporal decay rate (memory) are varied. Dynamically distinct excitation modes create a common time-averaged collective wave field potential, bearing qualitative similarities with the nuclear shell model and the bag model of hadrons. For high memory and rapid spatial decay of waves, the active cluster becomes unstable and disintegrates; however, within a narrow regime of the parameter space, the cluster ejects single particles whose decay statistics follow exponential laws, reminiscent of radioactive nuclear decay. Our study uncovers a rich spectrum of dynamical behaviors in clusters of active particles, opening new avenues for exploring hydrodynamic quantum analogs in active matter systems.

Title: $λ$-Jellium Model for the Anomalous Hall Crystal
Authors: Tomohiro Soejima, Junkai Dong, Ashvin Vishwanath, Daniel E. Parker
Abstract: The jellium model is a paradigmatic problem in condensed matter physics, exhibiting a phase transition between metallic and Wigner crystal phases. However, its vanishing Berry curvature makes it ill-suited for studying recent experimental platforms that combine strong interactions with nontrivial quantum geometry. These experiments inspired the anomalous Hall crystal (AHC) -- a topological variant of the Wigner crystal. The AHC spontaneously breaks continuous translation symmetry but has a nonzero Chern number. In this work, we introduce $\lambda-$jellium, a minimal extension of the two-dimensional jellium model. Its Berry curvature distribution is controlled by a single parameter, $\lambda$, where $\lambda=0$ corresponds to the standard jellium model. This setup facilitates the systematic exploration of Berry curvature's impact on electron crystallization. The phase diagram of this model, established using self-consistent Hartree Fock calculations, reveals several interesting features: (i) The AHC phase occupies a large region of the phase diagram. (ii) Two distinct Wigner crystal phases, the latter enabled by quantum geometry, and two distinct Fermi liquid phases are present. (iii) A continuous phase transition separates the AHC and one of the WC phases. (iv) In some parts of the AHC phase, the lattice geometry is non-triangular, unlike in the classical Wigner crystal. In addition to elucidating the physics of correlated electrons with nonzero Berry curvature, we expect that the simplicity of the model makes it an excellent starting point for more advanced numerical methods.

Title: Is Herbertsmithite far from an ideal antiferromagnet? Ab-initio answer including in-plane Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions and coupling with extra-plane impurities
Authors: Flaurent Heully-Alary, Nadia Ben Amor, Nicolas Suaud, Laura Messio, Coen de Graaf, Nathalie Guihéry
Abstract: Herbertsmithite is known as the archetype of a S=1/2 nearest-neighbor Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the Kagomé lattice, theoretically presumed to be a quantum gapless spin liquid. However, more and more experiments reveal that the model suffers from deviations from the ideal one, evidenced at very low temperatures. This detailed ab initio study focuses on two such deviations that have never been quantitatively calculated: the anisotropic exchange interactions and the Heisenberg exchange with extra-plane magnetic impurities. The Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction is found to have an in-plane component almost three times larger than the out-of-plane component, but typically obviated in theoretical studies. Moreover, it is shown that the extra-plane magnetic impurities have a strong ferromagnetic interaction (minus half the main exchange $J_1$ ) with the Kagomé magnetic sites. Combined with an estimated occurrence of these magnetic impurities of $\sim15\%$, the present results indicate that two-dimensional magnetic models only describe part of the physics.

Title: Two-mode Floquet Redfield quantum master approach for quantum transport
Authors: Vahid Mosallanejad, Wenjie Dou
Abstract: Simultaneous driving by two periodic oscillations yields a practical technique for further engineering quantum systems. For quantum transport through mesoscopic systems driven by two strong periodic terms, a non-perturbative Floquet-based quantum master equation (QME) approach is developed using a set of dissipative time-dependent terms and the reduced density matrix of the system. This work extends our previous Floquet approach for transport through quantum dots (at finite temperature and arbitrary bias) driven periodically by a single frequency. In a pedagogical way, we derive explicit time-dependent dissipative terms. Our theory begins with the derivation of the two-mode Floquet Liouville-von Neumann equation. We then explain the second-order Wangsness-Bloch-Redfield QME with a slightly modified definition of the interaction picture. Subsequently, the two-mode Shirley time evolution formula is applied, allowing for the integration of reservoir dynamics. Consequently, the established formalism has a wide range of applications in open quantum systems driven by two modes in the weak coupling regime. The formalism's potential applications are demonstrated through various examples.

Title: Nagaoka ferromagnetism in semiconductor artificial graphene
Authors: Gökhan Öztarhan, Paweł Potasz, A. D. Güçlü
Abstract: We present the emergence of Nagaoka ferromagnetism in semiconductor-based artificial graphene with realistic Coulomb interaction using high-precision variational and diffusion Monte Carlo methods, complemented by exact diagonalization calculations of the generalized Hubbard model. We analyze models of armchair hexagonal geometries nanopatterned on GaAs quantum wells. Our results reveal a distinct magnetic phase transition driven by the absence/addition of a single electron at half-filling. This form of itinerant magnetism predicted rigorously for Hubbard model remained unascertained in large scale realistic systems. We demonstrate that Coulomb scattering terms play a crucial role in stabilizing Nagaoka ferromagnetism, enabling the observation of the phase transition for system parameters near $U/t \approx 60$.

Title: From Heteropolymer Stiffness Distributions to Effective Homopolymers: A Conformational Analysis of Intrinsically Disordered Proteins
Authors: Yannick Witzky, Friederike Schmid, Arash Nikoubashman
Abstract: Synthetic copolymers and biopolymers, such as polypeptides and double-stranded DNA, often exhibit strong variations in bending stiffness along their contour, which can significantly impact conformational behavior at larger scales. To investigate these effects, we employ a discretized heterogeneous worm-like chain model, where the local persistence lengths are drawn from a Gaussian distribution. In the first part, we develop a theoretical model that maps such heterogeneous chains to homogeneous chains with a single effective persistence length. For uncorrelated disorder, our model predicts that this effective stiffness is systematically smaller than the arithmetic mean of the local persistence lengths, indicating that flexible segments have a bigger influence on the overall chain stiffness than rigid segments. We validate our model predictions using off-lattice Monte Carlo simulations, considering both ideal and self-avoiding chains in good solvent, and find excellent agreement in the regime, where the persistence lengths are on the order of a few bond lengths, consistent with typical values observed in polypeptides. In the second part, we performed simulations using various coarse-grained models of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), finding that the simulated IDPs have similar shapes like the corresponding homogeneous and heterogeneous worm-like chains. However, the IDPs are systematically larger than ideal worm-like chains, yet slightly more compact when excluded volume interactions are considered. We attribute these differences to intramolecular interactions between non-bonded monomers, which our theoretical models do not account for.

Title: Learned Free-Energy Functionals from Pair-Correlation Matching for Dynamical Density Functional Theory
Authors: Karnik Ram, Jacobus Dijkman, René van Roij, Jan-Willem van de Meent, Bernd Ensing, Max Welling, Daniel Cremers
Abstract: Classical density functional theory (cDFT) and dynamical density functional theory (DDFT) are modern statistical mechanical theories for modeling many-body colloidal systems at the one-body density level. The theories hinge on knowing the excess free-energy accurately, which is however not feasible for most practical applications. Dijkman et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 056103 (2025)] recently showed how a neural excess free-energy functional for cDFT can be learned from bulk simulations via pair-correlation matching. In this article, we demonstrate how this same functional can be applied to DDFT, without any retraining, to simulate non-equilibrium overdamped dynamics of inhomogeneous densities. We evaluate this on a 3D Lennard-Jones system with planar geometry under various complex external potentials and observe good agreement of the dynamical densities with those from expensive Brownian dynamic simulations, up to the limit of the adiabatic approximation. We further develop and apply an extension of DDFT based on gradient flows, to a grand-canonical system modeled after breakthrough gas adsorption studies, finding similarly good agreement. Our results demonstrate a practical route for leveraging learned free-energy functionals in DDFT, paving the way for accurate and efficient modeling of many-body non-equilibrium systems.

Title: Quantum Hall Effect without Chern Bands
Authors: Benjamin Michen, Jan Carl Budich
Abstract: The quantum Hall effect was originally observed in a two-dimensional electron gas forming Landau levels when exposed to a strong perpendicular magnetic field and was later generalized to Chern insulators without net magnetization. Here, further extending the realm of the quantum Hall effect, we report on the robust occurrence of an integer quantized transverse conductance at the onset of disorder in a microscopic lattice model, all bands of which are topologically trivial (zero Chern number). We attribute this phenomenon to the energetic separation of nonquantized Berry fluxes within those bands. Adding disorder then nudges the system into a quantum Hall phase from an extended critical regime obtained by placing the Fermi energy within a broad window inside a trivial band. This natural integer-rounding mechanism manifests as the mobility-gap-induced quantization of a nonuniversal Hall conductance. Our results are corroborated by numerical transport simulations and the analysis of two complementary topological markers.

Title: Strong Hilbert space fragmentation and fractons from subsystem and higher-form symmetries
Authors: Charles Stahl, Oliver Hart, Alexey Khudorozhkov, Rahul Nandkishore
Abstract: We introduce a new route to Hilbert space fragmentation in high dimensions leveraging the group-word formalism. We show that taking strongly fragmented models in one dimension and "lifting" to higher dimensions using subsystem symmetries can yield strongly fragmented dynamics in higher dimensions, with subdimensional (e.g., lineonic) excitations. This provides a new route to higher-dimensional strong fragmentation, and also a new route to fractonic behavior. Meanwhile, lifting one-dimensional strongly fragmented models to higher dimensions using higher-form symmetries yields models with topologically robust weak fragmentation. In three or more spatial dimensions, one can also "mix and match" subsystem and higher-form symmetries, leading to canonical fracton models such as X-cube. We speculate that this approach could also yield a new route to non-Abelian fractons. These constructions unify a number of phenomena that have been discussed in the literature, as well as furnishing models with novel properties.

Title: Dynamics of Anyon Clusters in Fractional Quantum Hall Fluids
Authors: Qianhui Xu, Guangyue Ji, Yuzhu Wang, Ha Quang Trung, Bo Yang
Abstract: In fractional quantum Hall fluids, the quasiparticle excitations are anyons with fractional charges and statistics. Effective interactions among the anyons can be induced by either model or realistic electron-electron (e-e) interactions. Without losing the generality, we investigate such phenomena for the Laughlin 1/3 and Moore-Read (MR) non-Abelian phases. Anyons display rich internal dynamics in both cases that will lead to interesting experimental consequences. In particular, bound states of two Laughlin anyons are preferred under short-range e-e interactions, leading to 2e/3 -- instead of e/3 -- effective charge carriers at low temperatures, which have been seen in several experiments. MR phases host two topologically distinct fusion channels: 1 and psi. The different effective interactions of e/4 anyons in the two sectors suggest the vanishing of the degeneracy of fusion channels when the e-e interaction is no longer its model Hamiltonian, in which case different bound states could also appear. This indicates the possibility of energetically manipulating the two types of anyons by tuning the bare e-e interactions. We point out that the results of recently developed high-resolution STM measurements will be affected by the effective anyon interactions, where anyons are clustered together after the tunneling of electrons. The low-lying parts of the local density of states affected by various anyon clusters are simulated for both Abelian and non-Abelian systems with (screened) Coulomb interactions.

Title: Quantum Point Contact with Local Two-body Loss
Authors: Kensuke Kakimoto, Shun Uchino
Abstract: Motivated by recent advances in ultracold atomic gas experiments, we investigate a two-terminal mesoscopic system in which two-body loss occurs locally at the center of a one-dimensional chain. By means of the self-consistent Born approximation in the Keldysh formalism, we uncover mesoscopic current formulas that are experimentally relevant and applicable to the weak dissipation regime. Although these formulas are analogous to those for systems with one-body loss, it turns out that the channel transmittance and loss probability depend on the nonequilibrium occupation at the lossy site. We demonstrate that this occupation dependence leads to a weaker suppression of currents in the presence of two-body loss compared to one-body loss.

Title: Hierarchical Topological States without Dimension Reduction
Authors: Joel R. Pyfrom, Kai Sun, Jihong A. Ma
Abstract: Topological insulators exhibit boundary states protected by bulk band topology, a principle first established in quantum systems and later extended to classical waves, including phononics. Conventionally, an $n$-dimensional bulk with nontrivial topology hosts $(n-1)$-dimensional topologically protected boundary states, which may be further gapped out by breaking the symmetry that protects them, potentially leading to the emergence of $(n-2)$-dimensional, or even lower-dimensional topological states, as in higher-order topological insulators. In this work, we introduce an alternative mechanism for gapping out topological states and forming new topological modes within the resulting gap without further unit-cell symmetry breaking or dimension reduction. Using one- and two-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) models, we show that controlled repositioning of topological domain walls enables the construction of hierarchical unit cells that gap out the original domain-wall states while preserving the underlying symmetry. This process produces higher-hierarchical-level topological states, characterized by a generalized winding number, and can be iterated to realize multiple - potentially infinite - hierarchical levels of topological states. Our approach expands the conventional topological classification and offers a versatile route for engineering complex networks of protected modes in higher dimensions.

Title: Characterizing Spin-Orbit Torques by Tensorial Spin Hall Magnetoresistance
Authors: Hantao Zhang, Ran Cheng
Abstract: Magnetoresistance (MR) provides a crucial tool for experimentally studying spin torques. While MR is well established in the device geometry of the spin Hall effect (SHE), as exemplified by the magnet/heavy-metal heterostructures, its role and manifestation beyond the SHE paradigm remain elusive. We propose a hitherto unknown form of MR where the underlying charge-to-spin conversion and its inverse process violate the simple geometry of the SHE, calling for tensorial descriptions. This MR can generate a series of unique harmonic responses essential for the experimental characterization of unconventional spin-orbit torques in non-SHE materials. We demonstrate these harmonic signals with semimetal WTe$_2$ in mind but the results are not restricted to specific materials.

Title: Bootstrapping Flat-band Superconductors: Rigorous Lower Bounds on Superfluid Stiffness
Authors: Qiang Gao, Zhaoyu Han, Eslam Khalaf
Abstract: The superfluid stiffness fundamentally constrains the transition temperature of superconductors, especially in the strongly coupled regime. However, accurately determining this inherently quantum many-body property in microscopic models remains a significant challenge. In this work, we show how the \textit{quantum many-body bootstrap} framework, specifically the reduced density matrix (RDM) bootstrap, can be leveraged to obtain rigorous lower bounds on the superfluid stiffness in frustration-free interacting models with superconducting ground state. We numerically apply the method to a special class of frustration free models, which are known as quantum geometric nesting models, for flat-band superconductivity, where we uncover a general relation between the stiffness and the pair mass. Going beyond the familiar Hubbard case within this class, we find how additional interactions, notably simple magnetic couplings, can enhance the superfluid stiffness. Furthermore, we find that the RDM bootstrap unexpectedly reveals that the trion-type correlations are essential for bounding the stiffness, offering new insights on the structure of these models. A straightforward generalization of the method can lead to bounds on susceptibilities complementary to variational approaches. Our findings underscore the immense potential of the quantum many-body bootstrap as a powerful tool to derive rigorous bounds on physical quantities beyond energy.

Title: Physical spin torques from exactly constrained exchange-correlation torques
Authors: Jacques K. Desmarais, Kamel Bencheikh, Giovanni Vignale, Stefano Pittalis
Abstract: The problem of capturing physical spin torques in non-collinear magnetic systems has dominated the scene of spin-density functional theory (SDFT) in the last two decades. Progress has been hindered by the fact that the spin torque is directly connected to the divergence of the spin current, a quantity that is {\em extraneous} to SDFT -- thus leading to {\em spurious} exchange-correlation (xc) torques in the spin dynamics. Moreover, SDFT cannot rigorously include vector potentials and spin-orbit couplings. Here, we propose a solution that exploits the U(1)$\times$SU(2)-invariance of the xc energy of SpinCurrent-DFT (SCDFT) -- an exact constraint that is not accessible to SDFT. Non-vanishing xc torques obtained on non-collinear solutions are constrained by the aforementioned exact internal symmetry and do not enter the propagation of the spin magnetization -- i.e., the spin dynamics involve {\em only} the physical currents and physical spin-torques.

Title: Shear flow of frictional spheroids: Comparison between elongated and flattened particles
Authors: Jacopo Bilotto, Martin Trulsson, Jean-François Molinari
Abstract: The rheology of dense granular shear flows is influenced by friction and particle shape. We investigate numerically the impact of non-spherical particle geometries under shear on packing fraction, stress ratios, velocity fluctuations, force distribution, and dissipation mechanisms, for a wide range of inertial numbers, friction coefficients and aspect ratios. We obtain a regime diagram for the dissipation which shows that lentil-like (oblate) particles exhibit an extended sliding regime compared to rice-like (prolate) particles with the same degree of eccentricity. Additionally, we identify non-monotonic behaviour of slightly aspherical particles at low friction, linking it to their higher fluctuating rotational kinetic energy. We find that angular velocity fluctuations are generally reduced when particles align with the flow, except in highly frictional rolling regimes, where fluctuations collapse onto a power-law distribution and motion becomes less correlated. Moreover, for realistic friction coefficients power dissipation tends to concentrate along the major axis aligned with the flow, where slip events are more frequent. We also show that flat particles develop stronger fabric anisotropy than elongated ones, influencing macroscopic stress transmission. These findings provide new insights into the role of particle shape in granular mechanics, with implications for both industrial and geophysical applications.

Title: Growth of Structural Lengthscale in Kob Andersen Binary Mixtures: Role of medium range order
Authors: Sanket Kumawat, Mohit Sharma, Ujjwal Kumar Nandi, Indrajit Tah, Sarika Maitra Bhattacharyya
Abstract: A central and extensively debated question in glass physics concerns whether a single, growing lengthscale fundamentally controls glassy dynamics, particularly in systems lacking obvious structural motifs like the Kob Andersen binary Lennard Jones (KALJ) model. In this work, we investigate structural and dynamical lengthscales in supercooled liquids using KALJ model in two compositions: 80:20 and 60:40. We compute the dynamical lengthscale from displacement displacement correlation functions and observe a consistent growth as temperature decreases. To explore the static counterpart, we use a structural order parameter (SOP) based on the mean field caging potential. While this SOP is known to predict short time dynamics effectively, its bare correlation function reveals minimal spatial growth. Motivated by recent findings that long time dynamics reflect collective rearrangements, we perform spatial coarse graining of the SOP and identify an optimal lengthscale Lmax that maximises structure dynamics correlation. We show that the structural correlation length derived from SOP coarse grained over Lmax exhibits clear growth with cooling and closely tracks the dynamical lengthscale, especially for A particles in the 80:20 mixture and for both A and B particles in the 60:40 system. Our results reconcile the previously observed absence of static length growth in the KALJ model by highlighting the necessity of intermediate range structural descriptors. Furthermore, we find that the particles with larger structural length growth also correspond to species with latent crystallisation tendencies, suggesting a possible link between structural order, dynamics, and incipient crystallisation.

Title: Relaxation dynamics of a mobile impurity injected into a one-dimensional Bose gas
Authors: Saptarshi Majumdar, Aleksandra Petković
Abstract: The nonequilibrium dynamics of an impurity immersed with a finite velocity into a one-dimensional system of weakly interacting bosons is studied within the framework of the time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii equation. We uncover and characterize different regimes of relaxation dynamics. We find that the final impurity velocity remains constant in a large interval of sufficiently big and realistic initial velocities. The underlying physical mechanism is the emission of the dispersive density shock waves that carry away the excess of the initial impurity momentum, while locally the system remains in the same stationary state. In contrast, a heavy impurity with the same coupling constant relaxes differently and the regime of constant final velocity disappears. Furthermore, a fast heavy impurity exhibits damped velocity oscillations in time before reaching a stationary state. This process is accompanied by the oscillations of the local depletion of the boson density around the impurity, until their positions coincide and they continue the motion together. Decreasing the impurity-boson coupling or increasing the strength of repulsion between bosons, the oscillations get amplified. In the case of a heavy impurity with the mass bigger than the critical one, the ground state energy as a function of momentum exhibits cusps and metastable branches. We show that they manifest themselves by a soliton emission, a considerable slowing down of the relaxation, and a change of the impurity direction of motion with respect to the initial one.

Title: Learning the non-Markovian features of subsystem dynamics
Authors: Michele Coppola, Mari Carmen Bañuls, Zala Lenarčič
Abstract: The dynamics of local observables in a quantum many-body system can be formally described in the language of open systems. The problem is that the bath representing the complement of the local subsystem generally does not allow the common simplifications often crucial for such a framework. Leveraging tensor network calculations and optimization tools from machine learning, we extract and characterize the dynamical maps for single- and two-site subsystems embedded in an infinite quantum Ising chain after a global quench. We consider three paradigmatic regimes: integrable critical, integrable non-critical, and chaotic. For each we find the optimal time-local representation of the subsystem dynamics at different times. We explore the properties of the learned time-dependent Liouvillians and whether they can be used to forecast the long-time dynamics of local observables beyond the times accessible through direct quantum many-body numerical simulation. Our procedure naturally suggests a novel measure of non-Markovianity based on the distance between the quasi-exact dynamical map and the closest CP-divisible form and reveals that criticality leads to the closest Markovian representation at large times.

Title: Third harmonic-mediated amplification in TWPA
Authors: E. Rizvanov, S. Kern, P. Neilinger, M. Grajcar
Abstract: In Josephson Traveling-Wave Parametric Amplifiers, higher-order harmonics of the pump tone and its sidebands are commonly present and typically regarded as parasitic. Consequently, most design efforts have focused on suppressing these harmonics. In spite of that, motivated by transient simulations, we extend the coupled-mode theory and demonstrate that, contrary to conventional belief, the third harmonic can enhance amplifier performance, improving both gain and bandwidth. We show that the recently developed plasma oscillation-based amplifier is particularly well-suited for exploiting this effect. Their dispersion relation enables us to observe the phenomenon in transient numerical simulations using JoSIM and WRspice. These simulations reveal improvement of the amplifier's performance, specifically the doubling of the bandwidth and an increase in the gain.

Title: When and How Ultrasound Enhances Nanoparticle Diffusion in Hydrogels: A Stick-and-Release Mechanism
Authors: Pablo M. Blanco, Hedda H. Rønneberg, Rita S. Dias
Abstract: Nanoparticles (NPs) are widely used as drug carriers in cancer therapy due to their ability to accumulate in tumor tissue via the enhanced permeability and retention effect. However, their transport within tumors is often hindered by the dense extracellular matrix, where diffusion dominates. Several studies suggest that ultrasound (US) irradiation can enhance NP diffusion in ECM-mimicking hydrogels, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear, and experimental findings are often contradictory. Here, we use coarse-grained Langevin Dynamics simulations to investigate the conditions under which US can enhance NP diffusion in hydrogels. After validating our simulation framework against an exact analytical solution for NP motion under US in dilute buffer, we systematically explore NP diffusion in hydrogels with varying degrees of NP-network attraction. Our results reveal that acoustic enhancement arises from reduced contact time between NPs and the hydrogel matrix. This effect becomes significant only when NP-hydrogel interactions are sufficiently strong and US pulses are long enough to disrupt these interactions, following a "stick-and-release" mechanism. These findings reconcile previously conflicting experimental observations and explain why acoustic enhancement is observed in some studies but not others. Overall, our study provides a molecular-level explanation for US-enhanced NP diffusion in hydrogels and establishes design principles for optimizing therapeutic US protocols in drug delivery applications.

Title: Exchange-driven self-diffusion of nanoscale crystalline parahydrogen clusters on graphite
Authors: K. M. Kolevski, M. Boninsegni
Abstract: Computer simulations yield evidence of superfluid behavior of nanoscale size clusters of parahydrogen adsorbed on a graphite substrate at low temperature ($T\lesssim 0.25 \text{ K}$). Clusters with a number of molecules between 7 and 12 display concurrent superfluidity and crystalline order, reflecting the corrugation of the substrate. Remarkably, it is found that specific clusters with a number of molecules ranging between 7 and 12 self-diffuse on the surface like free particles, despite the strong pinning effect of the substrate. This effect is underlain by coordinated quantum-mechanical exchanges of groups of identical molecules, i.e., it has no classical counterpart.

Title: Nonextensive Thermodynamics of the Morse Oscillator: Signature and Solid State Application
Authors: Arpita Goswami
Abstract: In this work, we present a detailed thermodynamic analysis of a bound quantum system: the Morse oscillator within the framework of Tsallis nonextensive statistics. Using the property of the bound spectrum (upper bound) of the Morse potential, limited by the bond dissociation energy, we analytically derive the generalized partition function. We present results for both the high- and low-temperature limits. We propose the effective number of accessible states as a measure of nonextensivity. The calculation shows that the nonextensive framework further restricts the number of accessible states. We also derive the generalized internal energy and entropy and examine their dependence on temperature and the nonextensivity parameter \( q \). Numerical results confirm the strong effect of nonextensive behavior in the low-temperature regime (precisely low to moderate temperature), where the ratio of generalized internal energy and internal energy calculated from the Boltzmann Gibbs (BG) formula develops a nontrivial dip structure for \( q < 1 \). Moreover, the generalized specific heat shows the Schottky-type anomaly. We extend our study by deriving the specific heat of solids with BG and Tsallis statistics using the anharmonic energy levels of the Morse oscillator. This study suggests that the Morse oscillator is a solvable and physically meaningful testing ground for exploring the thermodynamics of quantum systems driven by nonextensive statistics, with implications for the vibrational properties of the non-equilibrium molecular thermodynamics (especially diatomic molecules).

Abstract: We investigate GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure membranes with a metasurface made up of a grating of two-dimensional electron system (2DES) strips. Experiments have revealed a strong plasma resonance in the transmission of the metasurface. We have found that a collective effect from the superlattice, along with lateral screening between the strips, leads to the emergence of a new plasmon mode in the metasurface under study. Furthermore, we develop an analytical approach that accurately describes the behavior of the discovered superlattice plasmon mode, providing new insights into the fundamental physics of plasmonic metasurface systems.

Title: Bulk photovoltaic effects in the Haldane model
Authors: Bo-Xin Lin, Hsiu-Chuan Hsu
Abstract: The bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) refers to the direct current generation in a noncentrosymmetric material under illumination and can be applied to solar energy technology. BPVE includes injection and shift currents, led by the change of velocity and displacement of wave packet during optical transitions, respectively. We derive the constraints on the conductivity tensors imposed by mirror-time ($\mathcal{MT}$) symmetry for two-dimensional systems. For the Haldane model, we show that linearly polarized light can induce shift and injection currents. In contrast, circularly polarized light can not induce shift or injection currents, as constrained by the three-fold rotation symmetry. Additionally, due to the presence of $\mathcal{MT}$ symmetry, a separation of responses is shown in the Haldane model. Under linearly polarized light, shift current, allowed by time-reversal symmetry, flows perpendicularly to the injection current, allowed by $\mathcal{MT}$ symmetry. Across the topological phase transition, the injection current does not change sign since the group velocity's sign remains unchanged. On the contrary, shift current shows a sign flip, as a result of band inversion. Furthermore, we calculate quantum geometry, including quantum metric and symplectic connection, to demonstrate the microscopic quantum origin of the BPVE. We found that the vector field of symplectic connection in the Brillouin zone possesses vortices in the topological phase, but not in the trivial phase.

Title: Theoretical Study of Impurity Effects on Superconductivity in UTe2
Authors: Koki Doi, Shingo Haruna, Mutsuki Iwamoto, Takuji Nomura, Hirono Kaneyasu
Abstract: This study investigates the impurity effects on UTe2 within the self-consistent Born approximation using the six-orbital f-d-p model which contains two uranium and tellurium atoms in the minimum unit cell. We analyze the dependence of superconducting transition temperature (Tc) on impurity concentration for various pairing symmetries proposed by experiments and theories. It clarifies that the decrease of Tc significantly depends on which atom sites the impurities reside. Particulalry, the analysis shows that the impurity at U-site has dominant effect on the change of Tc. Then, either the singlet state in the case of magnetic impurities or the triplet states in both non-magnetic and magnetic impurities are consistent with experiments. Thus, this indicates that elucidating the magnetic properties of impurities (i.e. magnetic or non-magnetic) is crucial for identifying the pairing symmetry of UTe2.

Title: Tunable quantum anomalous Hall effect in fullerene monolayers
Authors: Leonard Werner Pingen, Jiaqi Wu, Bo Peng
Abstract: Nearly four decades after its theoretical prediction, the search for material realizations of quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) remains a highly active field of research. Many materials have been predicted to exhibit quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) physics under feasible conditions but the experimental verification remains widely elusive. In this work, we propose an alternative approach towards QAH materials design by engineering customized molecular building blocks. We demonstrate this ansatz for a two-dimensional (2D) honeycomb lattice of C26 fullerenes, which exhibits a ferromagnetic ground state and thus breaks time-reversal symmetry. The molecular system is found to be highly tunable with respect to its magnetic degrees of freedom and applied strain, giving rise to a rich phase diagram with Chern numbers C= +/-2, +/-1, 0. Our proposal offers a versatile platform to realize tunable QAH physics under accessible conditions and provides an experimentally feasible approach for chemical synthesis of molecular networks with QAHE.

Title: Unlocking Doping Effects on Altermagnetism in MnTe: Emergence of Quasi-altermagnetism
Authors: Nayana Devaraj, Anumita Bose, Arindom Das, Md Afsar Reja, Arijit Mandal, Awadhesh Narayan, B. R. K. Nanda
Abstract: Governed by specific symmetries, altermagnetism is an emerging field in condensed matter physics, characterized by unique spin-splitting of the bands in the momentum space co-existing with the compensated magnetization as in antiferromagnets. As crystals can have tailored and unintended defects, it is important to gain insights on how altermagnets are affected by the defects-driven symmetry-breaking which, in turn, can build promising perspectives on potential applications. In this study, considering the widely investigated MnTe as a prototype altermagnet, defects are introduced through substitutional doping to create a large configuration space of spin space groups. With the aid of density functional theory calculations, symmetry analysis, and model studies in this configuration space, we demonstrate the generic presence of spin-split of the antiferromagnetic bands in the momentum space. This is indicative of a wider class of quasi-altermagnetic materials, augmenting the set of ideal altermagnetic systems. Furthermore, we show that while pristine MnTe does not show anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) with out-of-plane magnetization, suitable doping can be carried out to obtain finite and varied AHC. Our predictions of quasi-altermagnetism and doping-driven tailored AHC have the potential to open up as-yet-unexplored directions in this developing field.

Title: Cryogenic performance of field-effect transistors and amplifiers based on selective area grown InAs nanowires
Authors: Giulia Meucci, Dags Olšteins, Damon J. Carrad, Gunjan Nagda, Daria V. Beznasyuk, Christian E. N. Petersen, Sara Martí-Sánchez, Jordi Arbiol, Thomas Sand Jespersen
Abstract: Indium-Arsenide (InAs) nanowire field-effect transistors (NWFETs) are promising platforms for high-speed, low-power nanoelectronics operating at cryogenic conditions, relevant for quantum information processing. We use selective area growth (SAG) of nanowires to realize scalable and planar nanowire device geometries that are compatible with standard semiconductor processing techniques. NWFETs are fabricated and their low temperature characteristics - including ION/IOFF ratios, threshold voltages, sub-threshold slope, interfacial trap density, hysteresis, and mobility - are characterized. The NWFETs operate effectively in integrated circuitry relying on saturation-mode operation. In sub-threshold applications such as amplifiers, we find bandwidths exceeding our cryostat wiring, but the gate hysteresis presents challenges for precise tuning of the amplifier operating point. We discuss the role of crystal imperfections and fabrication processes on the transistor characteristics and propose strategies for further improvements.

Title: Diffusioosmosis of electrolyte solutions in uniformly charged channels
Authors: Evgeny S. Asmolov, Elena F. Silkina, Olga I. Vinogradova
Abstract: When the concentration of electrolyte solution varies along the channel the forces arise that drag the fluid toward the higher or lower concentration region inducing a flow termed diffusio-osmotic. This article investigates a flow that emerges in channels with constant density of surface charge {\sigma} and thin compared to their thickness electrostatic diffuse layers. An equation for the fluid flow rate Q is derived and used to describe analytically the flux of ions, and local potentials and concentrations. This equation, which allows to treat the diffusio-osmotic problems without tedious and time consuming computations, clarifies that the global flow rate is controlled only by the surface charge and concentration drop between the channel ends, and indicates that there always exist two different values of {\sigma} that correspond to a particular Q. Our theory provides a simple explanation of the directions of the fluid flow rate and ionic flux depending on the surface charge and diffusivity of ions, predicts a non-linear concentration distribution along the channel caused by convection, and relates it to the local potential changes by a compact formula. We also present and interpret the variations of the diffusio-osmotic velocity profiles and the apparent slip velocity along the channel and show that the latter is highly non-uniform and could even becomes alternating. The relevance of our results for diffusio-osmotic experiments and for some electrochemistry and membrane science issues is discussed briefly.

Title: Anharmonicity-driven phonon avoided crossing and anomalous thermal transport in nodal-line semimetal ZrSiS
Authors: Xin Jin, Qingqing Zhang, Dengfeng Li, Zhenxiang Cheng, Jianli Wang, Xuewei Lv, Xiaoyuan Zhou, Rui Wang, Xianyong Ding, Peng Yu, Xiaolong Yang
Abstract: Understanding thermal and electrical transport in topological materials is essential for advancing their applications in quantum technologies and energy conversion. Herein, we employ first-principles calculations to systematically investigate phonon and charge transport in the prototypical nodal-line semimetal ZrSiS. The results unveil that anharmonic phonon renormalization results in the pronounced softening of heat-carrying phonons and suppressed lattice thermal conductivity ($\kappa_{\rm L}$). Crucially, anharmonic effects are found to noticeably weaken Zr-S interactions, triggering avoided-crossing behavior of low-frequency optical phonons. The combination of phonon softening and avoided crossing synergistically reduces phonon group velocities, yielding a 16\% suppression in $\kappa_{\rm L}$ along the $c$-axis at room temperature. Contrary to conventional metals, we discover that the lattice contribution to thermal conductivity in ZrSiS is abnormally large, even dominating heat conduction along the $c$-axis. This unusual behavior results in a substantial deviation of the Lorenz number from the Sommerfeld value -- exceeding it by up to threefold -- thereby challenging the validation of standard Wiedemann-Franz law for thermal conductivity estimation. Moreover, our calculations demonstrate that ZrSiS exhibits exceptional electrical conductivity, attributed to its topological electronic Dirac states that account for both high Fermi velocities and weak electron-phonon coupling. This study provides critical insights into the electrical and thermal transport mechanisms in ZrSiS and highlights the importance of anharmonic effects in the lattice dynamics and thermal transport of metallic materials.

Title: Contact Forces in Microgel Suspensions
Authors: Fran Ivan Vrban, Antonio Šiber, Primož Ziherl
Abstract: Within a model where micrometer-size soft colloidal particles are viewed as liquid drops, we theoretically study the contact interaction between them. We compute the exact deformation energy across a broad range of indentations and for various model parameters, and we show that it can be reproduced using truncated superball and spheropolyhedral variational shapes in the attractive and the repulsive regime, respectively. At large surface tensions representative of microgels, this energy is pairwise additive well beyond small indentations and can be approximated by a power-law dependence on indentation with an exponent around 2.

Title: Beyond mean-field effects in Josephson oscillations and self-trapping of Bose-Einstein condensates in two-dimensional dual-core traps
Authors: Sherzod R. Otajonov, Fatkhulla Kh. Abdullaev, Akbar Shermaxmatov
Abstract: We study a binary Bose gas in a symmetric dual-core, pancake-shaped trap, modelled by two linearly coupled two-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equations with Lee-Huang-Yang corrections. Two different cases are considered. First, we consider a spatially uniform condensate, where we identify the domains of parameters for macroscopic quantum tunnelling, self-trapping and localisation revivals. The analytical formulas for the Josephson frequencies in the zero- and $\pi$-phase modes are derived. As the total atom number varies, the system displays a rich bifurcation structure. In the zero-phase, two successive pitchfork bifurcations generate bistability and hysteresis, while the $\pi$-phase exhibits a single pitchfork bifurcation. The second case is when the quantum droplets are in a dual-core trap. Analytical predictions for the oscillation frequencies are derived via a variational approach for the coupled dynamics of quantum droplets, and direct numerical simulations validate the results. We identify critical values of the linear coupling that separate Josephson and self-trapped regimes as the particle number changes. We also found the Andreev-Bashkin superfluid drag effect in numerical simulations of the droplet-droplet interactions in the two-core geometry.

Title: Spin-phonon coupling and isotope-related pseudo-molecule vibrations in layered Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ ferromagnet
Authors: Grzegorz Krasucki, Katarzyna Olkowska-Pucko, Tomasz Woźniak, Mihai I. Sturza, Holger Kohlmann, Adam Babiński, Maciej R. Molas
Abstract: The vibrational structure of chromium germanium telluride (Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$, CGT) is investigated and a strong spin-phonon coupling is revealed. The measured high-resolution Raman scattering (RS) spectra are composed of the 10 Raman-active modes: 5A$_\textrm{g}$ and 5E$_\textrm{g}$, predicted by calculation using the density functional theory and identified using polarization-resolved RS measurements. We also studied the effect of temperature on the RS spectra of CGT from 5~K to 300~K. A strong magneto-phonon coupling in CGT is revealed at temperatures of about 150~K and 60~K, which are associated with the appearance of the local magnetic order in the material and the transition to the complete ferromagnetic phase, respectively. Moreover, a unique shape of the A$_g^5$ mode composed of a set of very narrow Raman peaks is simulated using a model that takes into account vibrations of Ge-Ge pseudo-molecules for various Ge isotopes.

Title: From High-Entropy Ceramics (HECs) to Compositionally Complex Ceramics (CCCs) and Beyond
Authors: Jian Luo
Abstract: Over the past decade, the field of high-entropy ceramics (HECs) has expanded rapidly to encompass a broad range of oxides, borides, silicides, and other ceramic solid solutions. In 2020, we proposed extending the concept of HECs to compositionally complex ceramics (CCCs), where non-equimolar compositions and the presence of long- or short-range order, despite reducing configurational entropy, create new opportunities to tailor and enhance properties, often surpassing those of higher-entropy counterparts. Along this line, several fundamental scientific questions arise. Is the entropy in HECs truly high? Should maximizing entropy always be the goal? In this perspective article, I revisit key concepts and terminologies and highlight emerging directions, including dual-phase CCCs, ultrahigh-entropy phases, and novel processing routes such as ultrafast reactive sintering. I propose that exploring compositional complexity across vast non-equimolar spaces, together with correlated disorder (coupled chemical and structural short-range order), offers an effective strategy for designing ceramics with superior performance.

Title: Predicting Crystal Structures and Ionic Conductivities in Li$_{3}$YCl$_{6-x}$Br$_{x}$ Halide Solid Electrolytes Using a Fine-Tuned Machine Learning Interatomic Potential
Authors: Jonas Böhm, Aurélie Champagne
Abstract: Understanding ionic transport in halide solid electrolytes is essential for advancing next-generation solid-state batteries. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of fine-tuning the Crystal Hamiltonian Graph Network (CHGNet) universal machine learning interatomic potential to accurately predict total energies, relaxed geometries, and lithium-ion dynamics in the ternary halide family Li$_{3}$YCl$_{6-x}$Br$_{x}$ (LYCB). Starting from experimentally refined disordered structures of Li$_{3}$YCl$_{6}$ and Li$_{3}$YBr$_{6}$, we present a strategy for generating ordered structural models through systematic enumeration and energy ranking, providing realistic structural models. These serve as initial configurations for an iterative fine-tuning workflow that integrates molecular dynamics simulations and static density functional theory calculations to achieve near-ab initio accuracy at four orders of magnitude lower computational cost. We further reveal the influence of composition (varied x) on the predicted phase stability and ionic conductivity in LYCB, demonstrating the robustness of our approach for modeling transport properties in complex solid electrolytes.

Title: Optimizing Cross-Domain Transfer for Universal Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials
Authors: Jaesun Kim, Jinmu You, Yutack Park, Yunsung Lim, Yujin Kang, Jisu Kim, Haekwan Jeon, Deokgi Hong, Seung Yul Lee, Saerom Choi, Yongdeok Kim, Jae W. Lee, Seungwu Han
Abstract: Accurate yet transferable machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are essential for accelerating materials and chemical discovery. However, most universal MLIPs overfit to narrow datasets or computational protocols, limiting their reliability across chemical and functional domains. We introduce a transferable multi-domain training strategy that jointly optimizes universal and task-specific parameters through selective regularization, coupled with a domain-bridging set (DBS) that aligns potential-energy surfaces across datasets. Systematic ablation experiments show that small DBS fractions (0.1%) and targeted regularization synergistically enhance out-of-distribution generalization while preserving in-domain fidelity. Trained on fifteen open databases spanning molecules, crystals, and surfaces, our model, SevenNet-Omni, achieves state-of-the-art cross-domain accuracy, including adsorption-energy errors below 0.06 eV on metallic surfaces and 0.1 eV on metal-organic frameworks. Despite containing only 0.5% r$^2$SCAN data, SevenNet-Omni reproduces high-fidelity r$^2$SCAN energetics, demonstrating effective cross-functional transfer from large PBE datasets. This framework offers a scalable route toward universal, transferable MLIPs that bridge quantum-mechanical fidelities and chemical domains.

Authors: Reuben R. W. Wang, John L. Bohn
Abstract: We discuss the influence of collisions on the dynamics of an ultracold gas whose constituents interact via dipolar forces. This dynamics is governed by the elastic scattering cross section of the molecules, which is to some extent under the experimentalist's control. We compare side-by-side several different situations, highlighting their similarities and differences. These situations are collisions between: 1) point dipoles; 2) electric-field-shielded polar molecules; and 3) microwave-shielded polar molecules, including the effect of microwave ellipticity.

Title: Electric Field-Induced Kerr Rotation on Metallic Surfaces
Authors: Farzad Mahfouzi, Mark D. Stiles, Paul M. Haney
Abstract: We use a combination of density functional theory calculations and optical modeling to establish that the electric field-induced Kerr rotation in metallic thin films has contributions from both non-equilibrium orbital moment accumulation (arising from the orbital Edelstein effect) and a heretofore overlooked surface Pockels effect. The Kerr rotation associated with orbital accumulation has been studied in previous works and is largely due to the dc electric field-induced change of the electron distribution function. In contrast, the surface Pockels effect is largely due to the dc field-induced change to the wave functions. Both of these contributions arise from the dual mirror symmetry breaking from the surface and from the dc applied field. Our calculations show that the resulting Kerr rotation is due to the dc electric field modification of the optical conductivity within a couple of nanometers from the surface, consistent with the dependence on the local mirror symmetry breaking at the surface. For thin films of Pt, our calculations show that the relative contributions of the orbital Edelstein and surface Pockels effects are comparable, and that they have different effects on Kerr rotation of $s$ and $p$ polarized light, $\theta_K^s$ and $\theta_K^p$. The orbital Edelstein effect yields similar values of $\theta_K^s$ and $\theta_K^p$, while the surface Pockels effect leads to opposing values of $\theta_K^s$ and $\theta_K^p$.

Title: Excitation of Confined Bulk Plasmons in metallic nanoparticles by penetrating electron beams within a non-local analytical approach
Authors: Mattin Urbieta, Eduardo Ogando, Alberto Rivacoba, Javier Aizpurua, Nerea Zabala
Abstract: Using a linear hydrodynamic model (HDM) we investigate theoretically the interaction between penetrating electron beams and sub-5 nm metallic spherical nanoparticles (NPs), and provide an analytical expression of the electron energy loss (EEL) probability including non-local effects in the response of the confined electron gas. We focus on the characterization of the longitudinal plasmon excitations, or confined bulk plasmons (CBPs), which cannot be addressed within local dielectric frameworks, and show that their excitation is highly sensitive to the impact parameter and kinetic energy of the incident electron beam, as well as to the NP's size. In contrast to the local approach, our decription captures a blueshift of the bulk plasmon envelope (BPE) with decreasing NP size and a blueshift with increasing impact parameter. Moreover, it predicts a threshold impact parameter, or minimum electron path inside the NP, to efficiently activate a set of CBPs. Exploiting the multipolar description of the CBPs we identify the underlying symmetry rules governing their excitation by electron beams, and correlate the observed blueshift of the BPE for increasing impact parameters with the excitation of higher-order CBPs. Dispersion of the CBPs with decreasing NP sizes further increases this impact parameter dependent blueshift of the BPE and also explains the decrease in the impact parameter threshold.

Title: Toward a Deterministic Nucleation Theory for Chirality-Controlled Nanotube Synthesis
Authors: Zhengrong Guo
Abstract: The electronic properties of carbon nanotubes are dictated by their chirality, specified by the integer indices (n,m). The absence of a predictive theory directly linking catalysts to the resulting (n,m) has hindered the controlled synthesis of specific chiralities. Here we narrow this gap through a two-step approach. First, we derive a universal vector sum rule that quantifies the relationship between cap structure and chirality, demonstrating that (n,m) is uniquely determined by the vector sum of the six pentagon coordinates within the cap. The complete set of these coordinates, evaluated across rotationally symmetric lattice frames, fully defines the carbon cap structure. Building on this topological foundation, we establish that chirality is encoded deterministically at nucleation, as perturbations to pentagon positions lead to predictable, quantifiable, and kinetically irreversible shifts in (n,m). By examining existing experimental evidence, we further propose that the preferential formation of $(12,6)$ nanotubes arises from a six-fold symmetric cap with epitaxial matching to the <1,1,1> catalyst facet. Our work provides a theoretical framework that redefines the field, shifting the paradigm from stochastic growth kinetics to deterministic nucleation programming and paving the way toward predictable synthesis.

Title: When Heating Isn't Cooling in Reverse: Nosé-Hoover Thermostat Fluctuations from Equilibrium Symmetry to Nonequilibrium Asymmetry
Authors: Hesam Arabzadeh, Brad Lee Holian
Abstract: Recent laboratory experiments suggest an intrinsic asymmetry between heating and cooling, with heating occurring more efficiently. Two decades earlier, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations had examined a related setup - heating one side of a computational cell while cooling the other via distinct thermostats. We revisit those calculations, recapitulating the underlying theory and showing that earlier MD results already hinted at the observed laboratory asymmetry. Recent realizations of a simple two-dimensional single-particle model, thermostatted in $x$ and $y$ at different temperatures, reproduces key features: at equilibrium, thermostat variables were identical, but under nonequilibrium conditions, the heating variable is weaker than the cooling one. At the same time, MD simulations from four decades ago by Evans and Holian reported a surprising skew in the Nose--Hoover thermostat variable $\xi$ under equilibrium - indicating a statistical bias in energy injection versus extraction. We revisit those results with exact reproduction of their setup. We show that when (1) the center-of-mass velocity is set to zero, (2) integration is done carefully with finite differencing, and (3) sampling is sufficiently long, the distribution of $\xi$ is symmetric and Gaussian with zero mean, as predicted by theory and validated by two independent error estimates. However, in the two-temperature cell, the distribution of thermostat variables become asymmetric, the cold bath requires significantly stronger damping than the hot bath requires anti-damping, with $\langle \xi_x \rangle / \langle \xi_y \rangle = -T_y/T_x$. This exact analytic relation links thermostat effort to thermal bias and the negative rate of change in the entropy of the system. These results identify the microscopic origin of heating-cooling asymmetry as a genuine nonequilibrium effect, consistent with experimental findings.

Title: Generative diffusion modeling protocols for improving the Kikuchi pattern indexing in electron back-scatter diffraction
Authors: Meghraj Prajapat, Alankar Alankar
Abstract: Electron back-scatter diffraction (EBSD) has traditionally relied upon methods such as the Hough transform and dictionary Indexing to interpret diffraction patterns and extract crystallographic orientation. However, these methods encounter significant limitations, particularly when operating at high scanning speeds, where the exposure time per pattern is decreased beyond the operating sensitivity of CCD camera. Hence the signal to noise ratio decreases for the observed pattern which makes the pattern noisy, leading to reduced indexing accuracy. This research work aims to develop generative machine learning models for the post-processing or on-the-fly processing of Kikuchi patterns which are capable of restoring noisy EBSD patterns obtained at high scan speeds. These restored patterns can be used for the determination of crystal orientations to provide reliable indexing results. We compare the performance of such generative models in enhancing the quality of patterns captured at short exposure times (high scan speeds). An interesting observation is that the methodology is not data-hungry as typical machine learning methods.

Title: Characterization of heat transfer in 3D CMOS structures using Sideband Scanning Thermal Wave Microscopy
Authors: Valentin Fonck, Mohammadali Razeghi, Jean Spièce, Phillip Dobson, Jonathan Weaver, George Ridgard, Grayson M. Noah, Pascal Gehring
Abstract: Efficient thermal management is critical for cryogenic CMOS circuits, where local heating can compromise device performance and qubit coherence. Understanding heat flow at the nanoscale in these multilayer architectures requires localized, high-resolution thermal probing techniques capable of accessing buried structures. Here, we introduce a sideband thermal wave detection scheme for Scanning Thermal Microscopy, S-STWM, to probe deeply buried heater structures within CMOS dies. By extracting the phase of propagating thermal waves, this method provides spatially resolved insight into heat dissipation pathways through complex multilayer structures. Our approach enables quantitative evaluation of thermal management strategies, informs the design of cryo-CMOS circuits, and establishes a foundation for in situ thermal characterization under cryogenic operating conditions.

Title: Spin glass phase at zero temperature in the Edwards-Anderson model
Authors: Sourav Chatterjee
Abstract: While the analysis of mean-field spin glass models has seen tremendous progress in the last twenty years, lattice spin glasses have remained largely intractable. This article presents the solutions to a number of questions about the Edwards-Anderson model of short-range spin glasses (in all dimensions) that were raised in the physics literature many years ago. First, it is shown that the ground state is sensitive to small perturbations of the disorder, in the sense that a small amount of noise gives rise to a new ground state that is nearly orthogonal to the old one with respect to the site overlap inner product. Second, it is shown that one can overturn a macroscopic fraction of the spins in the ground state with an energy cost that is negligible compared to the size of the boundary of the overturned region - a feature that is believed to be typical of spin glasses but clearly absent in ferromagnets. The third result is that the boundary of the overturned region in dimension $d$ has fractal dimension strictly greater than $d-1$, confirming a prediction from physics. The fourth result is that the expected size of the critical droplet of a bond grows at least like a power of the volume. The fifth result is that the correlations between bonds in the ground state can decay at most like the inverse of the distance. This contrasts with the random field Ising model, where it has been shown recently that the correlation decays exponentially in distance in dimension two. Taken together, these results comprise the first mathematical proof of glassy behavior in a short-range spin glass model.

Title: Modeling language ideologies for the dynamics of languages in contact
Authors: Pablo Rosillo-Rodes, Maxi San Miguel, David Sanchez
Abstract: In multilingual societies, it is common to encounter different language varieties. Various approaches have been proposed to discuss different mechanisms of language shift. However, current models exploring language shift in languages in contact often overlook the influence of language ideologies. Language ideologies play a crucial role in understanding language usage within a cultural community, encompassing shared beliefs, assumptions, and feelings towards specific language forms. These ideologies shed light on the social perceptions of different language varieties expressed as language attitudes. In this study, we introduce an approach that incorporates language ideologies into a model for contact varieties by considering speaker preferences as a parameter. Our findings highlight the significance of preference in language shift, which can even outweigh the influence of language prestige associated, for example, with a standard variety. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of the degree of interaction between individuals holding opposing preferences on the language shift process. Quite expectedly, our results indicate that when communities with different preferences mix, the coexistence of language varieties becomes less likely. However, variations in the degree of interaction between individuals with contrary preferences notably lead to non-trivial transitions from states of coexistence of varieties to the extinction of a given variety, followed by a return to coexistence, ultimately culminating in the dominance of the previously extinct variety. By studying finite-size effects, we observe that the duration of coexistence states increases exponentially with network size. Ultimately, our work constitutes a quantitative approach to the study of language ideologies in sociolinguistics.

Title: Shortcut-to-Adiabatic Controlled-Phase Gate in Rydberg Atoms
Authors: Luis S. Yagüe Bosch, Tim Ehret, Francesco Petiziol, Ennio Arimondo, Sandro Wimberger
Abstract: A shortcut-to-adiabatic protocol for the realization of a fast and high-fidelity controlled-phase gate in Rydberg atoms is developed. The adiabatic state transfer, driven in the high-blockade limit, is sped up by compensating nonadiabatic transitions via oscillating fields that mimic a counterdiabatic Hamiltonian. High fidelities are obtained in wide parameter regions. The implementation of the bare effective counterdiabatic field, without original adiabatic pulses, enables to bypass gate errors produced by the accumulation of blockade-dependent dynamical phases, making the protocol efficient also at low blockade values. As an application toward quantum algorithms, how the fidelity of the gate impacts the efficiency of a minimal quantum-error correction circuit is analyzed.

Title: Unveiling the Quantum Toroidal Dipole
Authors: Alexandru-Lucian Nastasia, Mircea Dolineanu, Dragos-Victor Anghel
Abstract: The electromagnetic response of matter is governed by three fundamental multipole families: electric, magnetic, and toroidal. While the electric and magnetic are cornerstones of physics, the toroidal dipole (TD) has eluded direct, quantitative measurement for over 60 years. Its far-field signature is masked by the electric dipole, and its behavior in the quantum regime remains largely unexplored. We address this long-standing problem by presenting a complete quantum-mechanical formalism for the TD in a nanostructure and proposing the first spectroscopic method for its direct measurement. We analyze a particle confined to a toroidal manifold subjected to an external current. We demonstrate that the resulting Aharonov-Bohm-like energy shifts in the system's spectrum are directly proportional to the expectation value of the TD operator. The transition energies exhibit a linear dependence on this current, with a quantized slope that directly reveals the change in the TD quantum number between eigenstates. This provides a clear experimental blueprint to unveil, measure, and characterize this elusive third multipole moment and its quantum nature, opening new avenues in quantum metamaterials, nanoscience, and the study of fundamental symmetries.

Title: Identifying Entanglement Phases with Bipartite Projected Ensembles
Authors: Zi-Yong Ge, Franco Nori
Abstract: We introduce bipartite projected ensembles (BPEs) for quantum many-body wave functions, which consist of pure states supported on two local subsystems, with each state associated with the outcome of a projective measurement of the complementary subsystem in a fixed local basis. We demonstrate that the corresponding ensemble-averaged entanglements (EAEs) between two subsystems can effectively identify entanglement phases. In volume-law entangled states, EAE converges to a nonzero value with increasing distance between subsystems. For critical systems, EAE exhibits power-law decay, and it decays exponentially for area-law systems. Thus, entanglement phase transitions can be viewed as a disordered-ordered phase transition. We also apply BPE and EAE to measured random Clifford circuits to probe measurement-induced phase transitions. We show that EAE serves not only as a witness to phase transitions, but also unveils additional critical phenomena properties, including dynamical scaling and surface critical exponents. Our findings provide an alternative approach to diagnosing entanglement laws, thus enhancing the understanding of entanglement phase transitions. Moreover, given the accessibility of measuring EAE in quantum simulators, our results hold promise for impacting quantum simulations.

Title: Strict area law entanglement versus chirality
Authors: Xiang Li, Ting-Chun Lin, John McGreevy, Bowen Shi
Abstract: Chirality is a property of a gapped phase of matter in two spatial dimensions that can be manifested through non-zero thermal or electrical Hall conductance. In this paper, we prove two no-go theorems that forbid such chirality for a quantum state in a finite dimensional local Hilbert space with strict area law entanglement entropies. As a crucial ingredient in the proofs, we introduce a new quantum information-theoretic primitive called instantaneous modular flow, which has many other potential applications.

Title: Noninvertible Symmetry-Resolved Affleck-Ludwig-Cardy Formula and Entanglement Entropy from the Boundary Tube Algebra
Authors: Yichul Choi, Brandon C. Rayhaun, Yunqin Zheng
Abstract: We derive a refined version of the Affleck-Ludwig-Cardy formula for a 1+1d conformal field theory, which controls the asymptotic density of high energy states on an interval transforming under a given representation of a noninvertible global symmetry. We use this to determine the universal leading and sub-leading contributions to the noninvertible symmetry-resolved entanglement entropy of a single interval. As a concrete example, we show that the ground state entanglement Hamiltonian for a single interval in the critical double Ising model enjoys a Kac-Paljutkin $H_8$ Hopf algebra symmetry when the boundary conditions at the entanglement cuts are chosen to preserve the product of two Kramers-Wannier symmetries, and we present the corresponding symmetry-resolved entanglement entropies. Our analysis utilizes recent developments in symmetry topological field theories (SymTFTs).

Title: Neural Entropy
Authors: Akhil Premkumar
Abstract: We explore the connection between deep learning and information theory through the paradigm of diffusion models. A diffusion model converts noise into structured data by reinstating, imperfectly, information that is erased when data was diffused to noise. This information is stored in a neural network during training. We quantify this information by introducing a measure called neural entropy, which is related to the total entropy produced by diffusion. Neural entropy is a function of not just the data distribution, but also the diffusive process itself. Measurements of neural entropy on a few simple image diffusion models reveal that they are extremely efficient at compressing large ensembles of structured data.

Title: Instability of steady-state mixed-state symmetry-protected topological order to strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking
Authors: Jeet Shah, Christopher Fechisin, Yu-Xin Wang, Joseph T. Iosue, James D. Watson, Yan-Qi Wang, Brayden Ware, Alexey V. Gorshkov, Cheng-Ju Lin
Abstract: Recent experimental progress in controlling open quantum systems enables the pursuit of mixed-state nonequilibrium quantum phases. We investigate whether open quantum systems hosting mixed-state symmetry-protected topological states as steady states retain this property under symmetric perturbations. Focusing on the decohered cluster state -- a mixed-state symmetry-protected topological state protected by a combined strong and weak symmetry -- we construct a parent Lindbladian that hosts it as a steady state. This Lindbladian can be mapped onto exactly solvable reaction-diffusion dynamics, even in the presence of certain perturbations, allowing us to solve the parent Lindbladian in detail and reveal previously-unknown steady states. Using both analytical and numerical methods, we find that typical symmetric perturbations cause strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking at arbitrarily small perturbations, destabilize the steady-state mixed-state symmetry-protected topological order. However, when perturbations introduce only weak symmetry defects, the steady-state mixed-state symmetry-protected topological order remains stable. Additionally, we construct a quantum channel which replicates the essential physics of the Lindbladian and can be efficiently simulated using only Clifford gates, Pauli measurements, and feedback.

Title: Quantum vortices leave a macroscopic signature in the normal fluid
Authors: Luca Galantucci, Giorgio Krstulovic, Carlo F Barenghi
Abstract: Recent work has highlighted the remarkable properties of quantum turbulence in superfluid helium II, consisting of a disordered tangle of quantised vortex lines which interact with each other and reconnect when they collide. According to Landau's two-fluid theory, these vortex lines move in a surrounding of thermal excitations called the normal fluid. Until now, the normal fluid has often been considered a passive background which simply provides the vortex lines with a mechanism for dissipating their kinetic energy into heat. Using a model which fully takes into account the two-way interaction between the vortex lines and the normal fluid, here we show numerically that each vortex line creates a macroscopic wake in the normal fluid that can be larger than the average distance between vortex lines; this is surprising, given the microscopic size of the superfluid vortex cores which induce these wakes. We show that in heat transfer experiments, the flow of the normal fluid can therefore be described as the superposition of an imposed uniform flow and wakes generated by the vortex lines, leading to non-classical statistics of the normal fluid velocity. We also argue that this first evidence of independent fluid structures in the thermal excitations postulated by Landau may be at the root of recent, unaccounted for, experimental findings.

Title: E2Former: An Efficient and Equivariant Transformer with Linear-Scaling Tensor Products
Authors: Yunyang Li, Lin Huang, Zhihao Ding, Chu Wang, Xinran Wei, Han Yang, Zun Wang, Chang Liu, Yu Shi, Peiran Jin, Tao Qin, Mark Gerstein, Jia Zhang
Abstract: Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (EGNNs) have demonstrated significant success in modeling microscale systems, including those in chemistry, biology and materials science. However, EGNNs face substantial computational challenges due to the high cost of constructing edge features via spherical tensor products, making them impractical for large-scale systems. To address this limitation, we introduce E2Former, an equivariant and efficient transformer architecture that incorporates the Wigner $6j$ convolution (Wigner $6j$ Conv). By shifting the computational burden from edges to nodes, the Wigner $6j$ Conv reduces the complexity from $O(|\mathcal{E}|)$ to $ O(| \mathcal{V}|)$ while preserving both the model's expressive power and rotational equivariance. We show that this approach achieves a 7x-30x speedup compared to conventional $\mathrm{SO}(3)$ convolutions. Furthermore, our empirical results demonstrate that the derived E2Former mitigates the computational challenges of existing approaches without compromising the ability to capture detailed geometric information. This development could suggest a promising direction for scalable and efficient molecular modeling.

Title: Universal Counterdiabatic Driving
Authors: Stewart Morawetz, Anatoli Polkovnikov
Abstract: Local counterdiabatic (CD) driving provides a systematic way of constructing a control protocol to approximately suppress the excitations resulting from changing some parameter(s) of a quantum system at a finite rate. However, designing CD protocols typically requires knowledge of the original Hamiltonian a priori. In this work, we design local CD driving protocols in Krylov space using only the characteristic local time scales of the system set by e.g. phonon frequencies in materials or Rabi frequencies in superconducting qubit arrays. Surprisingly, we find that convergence of these universal protocols is controlled by the asymptotic high frequency tails of the response functions. This finding hints at a deep connection between the long-time, low frequency response of the system controlling non-adiabatic effects, and the high-frequency response determined by the short-time operator growth and the Krylov complexity, which has been elusive until now.

Title: Relevance of "on" and "off" transitions in quantum pair production experiments
Authors: Álvaro Álvarez-Domínguez, Álvaro Parra-López
Abstract: Analog gravity experiments, such as those realized in Bose-Einstein condensates, often aim at simulating cosmological pair production due to the dynamical expansion of the Universe. However, these experiments have a start and an end, which introduces unavoidable transitions out of and into static regimes that alter the intended expansion profile. We show that the resulting particle spectra can be overwhelmingly dominated by these transition periods, which calls for a careful interpretation of experimental outcomes. In prospective Schwinger effect experiments, by contrast, transition effects do not dominate particle production, and such a reinterpretation may not be necessary.

We demonstrate the capabilities of the package by applying it to some prototypical binary and multicomponent alloys, including high-entropy alloys.

Title: Is Grokking a Computational Glass Relaxation?
Authors: Xiaotian Zhang, Yue Shang, Entao Yang, Ge Zhang
Abstract: Understanding neural network's (NN) generalizability remains a central question in deep learning research. The special phenomenon of grokking, where NNs abruptly generalize long after the training performance reaches a near-perfect level, offers a unique window to investigate the underlying mechanisms of NNs' generalizability. Here we propose an interpretation for grokking by framing it as a computational glass relaxation: viewing NNs as a physical system where parameters are the degrees of freedom and train loss is the system energy, we find memorization process resembles a rapid cooling of liquid into non-equilibrium glassy state at low temperature and the later generalization is like a slow relaxation towards a more stable configuration. This mapping enables us to sample NNs' Boltzmann entropy (states of density) landscape as a function of training loss and test accuracy. Our experiments in transformers on arithmetic tasks suggests that there is NO entropy barrier in the memorization-to-generalization transition of grokking, challenging previous theory that defines grokking as a first-order phase transition. We identify a high-entropy advantage under grokking, an extension of prior work linking entropy to generalizability but much more significant. Inspired by grokking's far-from-equilibrium nature, we develop a toy optimizer WanD based on Wang-landau molecular dynamics, which can eliminate grokking without any constraints and find high-norm generalizing solutions. This provides strictly-defined counterexamples to theory attributing grokking solely to weight norm evolution towards the Goldilocks zone and also suggests new potential ways for optimizer design.

Title: Complex and tunable heating in conformal field theories with structured drives via classical ergodicity breaking
Authors: Liang-Hong Mo, Roderich Moessner, Hongzheng Zhao
Abstract: Emission and absorption of energy are fundamental aspects of non-equilibrium dynamics. The heating induced by driving a many-body system is perhaps the most straightforward diagnostic of the process of equilibration, or the lack thereof. Gapless systems are particularly susceptible to drive-induced heating, and the capacity to control such heating is of experimental importance. Our study addresses this challenge in the framework of conformal field theory (CFT), for which we study families of structured drives up to the aperiodic Thue-Morse sequence. Concretely, we consider a class of spatially inhomogeneous Hamiltonians, where the operator evolution is governed by a non-linear classical dynamical system $\mathcal{K}$. The existence of invariant regions and fixed points of $\mathcal{K}$ leads to different levels of ergodicity breaking. Upon bridging the gap between this dynamical system and the driven CFT, we classify various dynamical phases of matter, including the heating and non-heating phases, as well as a prethermal phase with a controllably slow heating rate. We further generalize the discussion to $\eta-$random multipolar driving, characterized by $\eta-$th order multipolar correlation in time. A ``triply tunable'' parametric dependence of the prethermal lifetime arises as $K^{-2(\eta-\xi)}$, where $K$ quantifies the deviation from the preimages of the fixed points of $\mathcal{K}$, the multipolar order $\eta$, and the order of the preimages $\xi$. Upon sacrificing Hermiticity by considering SU(2) deformed CFTs, we find another non-heating phase with a non-zero measure, inaccessible via purely unitary CFTs. This is underpinned by an emergent compact subspace in the generic $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$ group structure, which we also identify in the transfer matrix in non-Hermitian systems with binary disorder.

Title: Critical Dynamics of Random Surfaces and Multifractal Scaling
Authors: Christof Schmidhuber
Abstract: The critical dynamics of conformal field theories on random surfaces is investigated beyond the previously studied dynamics of the overall area and the genus. It is found that the evolution of the order parameter in physical time performs a generalization of the multifractal random walk. Accordingly, the higher moments of time variations of the order parameter exhibit multifractal scaling. The series of Hurst exponents is computed and illustrated at the examples of the Ising-, 3-state-Potts-, and general minimal models as well as $c=1$ models on a random surface. It is noted that some of these models can replicate the observed multifractal scaling in financial markets.

Title: Trotter transition in BCS pairing dynamics
Authors: Aniket Patra, Emil A. Yuzbashyan, Boris L. Altshuler, Sergej Flach
Abstract: We study universal aspects of thermalization induced by Trotterization, a procedure routinely used in gate-based quantum computation. We use the reduced-BCS model -- quantum integrable with a classically integrable mean-field limit -- where the effects of Trotter chaos are expected to be particularly stark. The resulting Trotterized chaotic dynamics is characterized by its Lyapunov spectrum and rescaled Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy. The chaos quantifiers depend on the Trotterization time step $\tau$. We observe a Trotter transition at a finite step value $\tau_c \approx \sqrt{N}$. While the dynamics is weakly chaotic for time steps $\tau \ll \tau_c$, the regime of large Trotterization steps is characterized by short temporal correlations. We derive two different scaling laws for the two different regimes by numerically fitting the maximum Lyapunov exponent data. The scaling law of the large \(\tau\) limit agrees well with the one derived from the kicked top map. Beyond its relevance to current quantum computers, our work opens new directions -- such as probing observables like the Loschmidt echo, which lie beyond standard mean-field description -- across the Trotter transition we uncover.

Title: Universal roughness and the dynamics of urban expansion
Authors: Ulysse Marquis, Oriol Artime, Riccardo Gallotti, Marc Barthelemy
Abstract: Urban sprawl reshapes cities, yet its quantitative laws remain elusive. Analyzing built-up expansion in 19 cities (1985-2015) with tools from surface growth physics in radial geometry, we reveal anisotropic, branch-like growth and a piecewise linear scaling between area and population. We uncover a robust local roughness exponent $\alpha_{\text{loc}}\approx 0.54$, coexisting with variable $\beta$ and $z$. This unusual coexistence of universal and variable exponents offers a rare empirical testbed for nonequilibrium growth and an empirical basis for modeling urban sprawl.

Title: Correspondence principle, dissipation, and Ginibre ensemble
Authors: David Villaseñor, Hua Yan, Matic Orel, Marko Robnik
Abstract: The correspondence between quantum and classical behavior has been essential since the advent of quantum mechanics. This principle serves as a cornerstone for understanding quantum chaos, which has garnered increased attention due to its strong impact in various theoretical and experimental fields. When dissipation is considered, quantum chaos takes concepts from isolated quantum chaos to link classical chaotic motion with spectral correlations of Ginibre ensembles. This correspondence was first identified in periodically kicked systems with damping, but it has been shown to break down in dissipative atom-photon systems [Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 240404 (2024)]. In this contribution, we revisit the original kicked model and perform a systematic exploration across a broad parameter space, reaching a genuine semiclassical limit. Our results demonstrate that the correspondence principle, as defined through this spectral connection, fails even in this prototypical system. These findings provide conclusive evidence that Ginibre spectral correlations are neither a robust nor a universal diagnostic of dissipative quantum chaos.

Title: Excitonic Coupling and Photon Antibunching in Venus Yellow Fluorescent Protein Dimers: A Lindblad Master Equation Approach
Authors: Ian T. Abrahams
Abstract: Strong excitonic coupling and photon antibunching (AB) have been observed together in Venus yellow fluorescent protein dimers and currently lack a cohesive theoretical explanation. In 2019, Kim et al. demonstrated Davydov splitting in circular dichroism spectra, revealing strong J-like coupling, while antibunched fluorescence emission was confirmed by combined antibunching--fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (AB/FCS fingerprinting). To investigate the implications of this coexistence, Venus dimer population dynamics are modeled within a Lindblad master equation framework, testing its ability to cope with typical FP time and energy values. Simulations predict multiple-femtosecond (fs) decoherence, yielding bright/dark state mixtures consistent with antibunched fluorescence emission at room temperature. Thus, excitonic coupling and photon AB are reconciled without invoking long-lived quantum coherence. However, clear violations of several approximation validity conditions appear imminent, calling for careful modifications to choices of standard system and bath definitions and parameter values.

Title: Vibrational Spectra of Materials and Molecules from Partially-Adiabatic Elevated-Temperature Centroid Molecular Dynamics
Authors: Jorge Castro, George Trenins, Venkat Kapil, Mariana Rossi
Abstract: Centroid molecular dynamics (CMD) incorporates nuclear quantum statistics into the calculation of vibrational spectra. However, when performed in Cartesian coordinates, CMD shows unphysical artifacts in certain vibrational bands, known as the curvature problem. Recent work showed that CMD spectra can be freed from the curvature problem by evolving the ring-polymer centroid on a potential of mean force (PMF) calculated at an elevated temperature ($T_e$-CMD). Here we present a partially-adiabatic implementation of $T_e$-CMD (PA-$T_e$-CMD), which eliminates the need for precomputed PMFs and instead yields the centroid force 'on the fly'. We introduce a two-temperature path-integral Langevin thermostat to achieve a temperature separation between centroid and internal modes of the ring polymer. Because it is paramount that the elevated temperature be chosen as low as possible for a given physical temperature in this formulation, we present a general scheme for its determination. We benchmark PA-$T_e$-CMD against exact vibrational spectra for the isolated water monomer and discuss its performance for challenging anharmonic systems: the carbonic acid fluoride molecule (CAF) and the methylammonium lead iodide perovskite (MAPI). We conclude that PA-$T_e$-CMD mitigates the curvature problem and the steep increase in computational cost with decreasing temperature of conventional path-integral methods. We observe energy leakage from the hot internal modes to high-frequency centroid modes in some cases, which, nevertheless, only compromises the spectral lineshapes at lower temperatures. While an adiabatic setup based on a coarse-grained centroid PMF is still preferable when a good pre-trained PMF can be easily obtained, PA-$T_e$-CMD presents a low-barrier single-shot setup for any system.

Title: Language Native Lightly Structured Databases for Large Language Model Driven Composite Materials Research
Authors: Yuze Liu, Zhaoyuan Zhang, Xiangsheng Zeng, Yihe Zhang, Leping Yu, Lejia Wang, Xi Yu
Abstract: The preparation procedures of materials are often embedded narratively in experimental protocols, research articles, patents, and laboratory notes, and are structured around procedural sequences, causal relationships, and conditional logic. The synthesis of boron nitride nanosheet (BNNS) polymer composites exemplifies this linguistically encoded decision-making system, where the practical experiments involve interdependent multistage and path-dependent processes such as exfoliation, functionalization, and dispersion, each governed by heterogeneous parameters and contextual contingencies, challenging conventional numerical optimization paradigms for experiment design. We reformulate this challenge into a text-reasoning problem through a framework centered on a text-first, lightly structured materials database and large language models (LLMs) as text reasoning engines. We constructed a database that captures evidence-linked narrative excerpts from the literature while normalizing only the minimum necessary entities, attributes, and relations to enable composite retrieval that unifies semantic matching, lexical cues, and explicit value filters. Building on this language-native, provenance-preserving foundation, the LLM operates in two complementary modes: retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), grounding outputs in retrieved evidence modules from the database, and experience-augmented reasoning (EAR), which leverages iteratively trained text guides derived from multi-source literature-based narrative data as external references to inform reasoning and decision-making. Applying this integration-and-reasoning framework, we demonstrate rapid, laboratory-scale optimization of BNNS preparation, highlighting how language-native data combined with LLM-based reasoning can significantly accelerate practical material preparation.

Abstract: We consider the activated random walk particle system, a model of self-organized criticality, on $\mathbb{Z}$ with i.i.d.-Bernoulli initial configuration. We show that at subcritical density, the system's odometer function, which counts the number of actions taken at each site, has a stretched exponential tail. It follows that the expected odometer at each site is finite.

Title: Locating the Ising CFT via the ground-state energy on the fuzzy sphere
Authors: Kay Joerg Wiese
Abstract: We locate the phase-transition line for the Ising model on the fuzzy sphere from a finite-size scaling analysis of its ground-state energy. Our strategy is to write the latter as $E_{GS}(N_m)/N_m = E_{0} + E_1 /N_m + E_{3/2}/N_m^{3/2}+ ...$, and to search for a minimum of $ \chi:=E_{3/2}/E_0$ as a function of the couplings. Conformal perturbation theory predicts that around a CFT, $\chi= \chi_{\rm min} + \sum_i \lambda_i^2 N_m^{-\omega_i} + O(\lambda^3)$, where $\lambda_i$ are the couplings associated to perturbations of operators with dimension $\Delta_i$, and $\omega_i = d-\Delta_i$. This procedure finds the critical curve of [PRX 13 (2023) 021009] and their sweet spot with good precision. Varying two coupling constants allows us to extract the correction-to-scaling exponent $\omega$ associated to the two leading scalars $\epsilon$, and $\epsilon'$. We find similar results when normalizing by the gap to the stress tensor $T$ or first parity-odd operator $\sigma$ instead of $E_0$.

Title: Single Sr Atoms in Optical Tweezer Arrays for Quantum Simulation
Authors: Veronica Giardini, Luca Guariento, Andrea Fantini, Shawn Storm, Massimo Inguscio, Jacopo Catani, Giacomo Cappellini, Vladislav Gavryusev, Leonardo Fallani
Abstract: We report on the realization of a platform for trapping and manipulating individual $^{88}$Sr atoms in optical tweezers. A first cooling stage based on a blue shielded magneto-optical trap (MOT) operating on the $^1S_0$ -> $^1P_1$ transition at 461 nm enables us to trap approximately $4\times 10^6$ atoms at a temperature of 6.8 mK. Further cooling is achieved in a narrow-line red MOT using the $^1S_0$ -> $^3P_1$ intercombination transition at 689 nm, bringing $4\times 10^5$ atoms down to 5 $\mu$K and reaching a density of $\approx 10^{10}$ cm$^{-3}$. Atoms are then loaded into 813 nm tweezer arrays generated by crossed acousto-optic deflectors and tightly focused onto the atoms with a high-numerical-aperture objective. Through light-assisted collision processes we achieve the collisional blockade, which leads to single-atom occupancy with a probability of about $50\%$. The trapped atoms are detected via fluorescence imaging with a fidelity of $99.986(6)\%$, while maintaining a survival probability of $97(2)\%$. The release-and-recapture measurement provides a temperature of $12.92(5)$ $\mu$K for the atoms in the tweezers, and the ultra-high-vacuum environment ensures a vacuum lifetime higher than 7 minutes. These results demonstrate a robust alkaline-earth tweezer platform that combines efficient loading, cooling, and high-fidelity detection, providing the essential building blocks for scalable quantum simulation and quantum information processing with Sr atoms.

Title: Perfect Particle Transmission through Duality Defects
Authors: Atsushi Ueda, Vic Vander Linden, Laurens Lootens, Jutho Haegeman, Paul Fendley, Frank Verstraete
Abstract: We study wavepackets that propagate across (a) topological interfaces in quantum spin systems exhibiting non-invertible symmetries and (b) duality defects coupling dual theories. We demonstrate that the transmission is always perfect, and that a particle traversing the interface is converted into a nonlocal string-like excitation. We give a systematic way of constructing such a defect by identifying its Hilbert space with the virtual bond dimension of the matrix product operator representing defect lines. Our work both gives an operational meaning to topological interfaces, and provides a lattice analogue of recent results solving the monopole paradox in quantum field theory.

Title: How Do Proteins Fold?
Authors: Carlos Bustamante, Christian Kaiser, Erik Lindahl, Robert Sosa, Giovanni Volpe
Abstract: How proteins fold remains a central unsolved problem in biology. While the idea of a folding code embedded in the amino acid sequence was introduced more than 6 decades ago, this code remains undefined. While we now have powerful predictive tools to predict the final native structure of proteins, we still lack a predictive framework for how sequences dictate folding pathways. Two main conceptual models dominate as explanations of folding mechanism: the funnel model, in which folding proceeds through many alternative routes on a rugged, hyperdimensional energy landscape; and the foldon model, which proposes a hierarchical sequence of discrete intermediates. Recent advances on two fronts are now enabling folding studies in unprecedented ways. Powerful experimental approaches; in particular, single-molecule force spectroscopy and hydrogen (deuterium exchange assays) allow time-resolved tracking of the folding process at high resolution. At the same time, computational breakthroughs culminating in algorithms such as AlphaFold have revolutionized static structure prediction, opening opportunities to extend machine learning toward dynamics. Together, these developments mark a turning point: for the first time, we are positioned to resolve how proteins fold, why they misfold, and how this knowledge can be harnessed for biology and medicine.
