Title: Non-Hermitian edge burst of sound
Authors: Hong-Yu Zou, Bing-Bing Wang, Yong Ge, Ke-Qi Zhao, Yu-Qi Chen, Hong-Xiang Sun, Shou-Qi Yuan, Haoran Xue, Baile Zhang
Abstract: Non-Hermitian band topology can give rise to phenomena with no counterparts in Hermitian systems. A well-known example is the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), where Bloch eigenstates localize at a boundary, induced by a nontrivial spectrum winding number. In contrast, recent studies on lossy non-Hermitian lattices have uncovered an unexpected boundary-localized loss probability-a phenomenon that requires not only non-Hermitian band topology but also the closure of the imaginary (dissipative) gap. Here, we demonstrate the non-Hermitian edge burst in a classical-wave metamaterial: a lossy nonreciprocal acoustic crystal. We show that, when the imaginary gap remains closed, edge bursts can occur at the right boundary, left boundary, or both boundaries simultaneously, all under the same non-Hermitian band topology; the latter scenario is known as a bipolar edge burst. The occurrence of each scenario depends on the number and location of the imaginary gap closure points in the eigenenergy spectra. These findings generalize the concept of edge burst from quantum to classical wave systems, establish it as an intrinsic material property, and enrich the physics of the complex interplay between non-Hermitian band topology and other physical properties in non-Hermitian systems.

Title: Three-Dimensional Continuous Multi-Walled Carbon Nanotubes Network-Toughened Diamond Composite
Authors: Jiawei Zhang, Keliang Qiu, Tengfei Xu, Xi Shen, Junkai Li, Fengjiao Li, Richeng Yu, Huiyang Gou, Duanwei He, Liping Wang, Zhongzhou Wang, Guodong Li, Yusheng Zhao, Ke Chen, Fang Hong, Ruifeng Zhang, Xiaohui Yu
Abstract: Enhancing the fracture toughness of diamond while preserving its hardness is a significant challenge. Traditional toughening strategies have primarily focused on modulating the internal microstructural units of diamonds, including adjustments to stacking sequences, faults, nanotwinning, and the incorporation of amorphous phases, collectively referred to as intrinsic toughening. Here, we introduce an extrinsic toughening strategy to develop an unparalleled tough diamond composite with complex and abundant sp2-sp3 bonding interfaces, by incorporating highly dispersed multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) into the gaps of diamond grains to create a three-dimensional (3D) continuous MWCTNs network-toughen heterogeneous structure. The resultant composite exhibits a hardness of approximately 91.6 GPa and a fracture toughness of roughly 36.4 MPa.m1/2, which is six times higher than that of synthetic diamond and even surpasses that of tungsten alloys, surpassing the benefits achievable through intrinsic toughening alone. The remarkable toughening behavior can be attributed to the formation of numerous mixed sp2-sp3 bonding interactions at the 3D continuous network MWCNTs/diamond interfaces, which facilitate efficient energy dissipation. Our 3D continuous network heterogeneous structure design provides an effective approach for enhancing the fracture toughness of superhard materials, offering a new paradigm for the advanced composite ceramics.

Title: No-go theorem for single time-reversal invariant symmetry-protected Dirac fermions in 3+1d
Authors: Lei Gioia, Anton A. Burkov, Taylor L. Hughes
Abstract: We employ a general method, known as anomaly-matching, to derive new no-go theorems of fermionic lattice models. For our main result, we show that time-reversal invariant 3+1d lattice systems (such as Dirac and Weyl semimetals) can never admit a lone low-energy symmetry-protected Dirac fermion (or node), i.e., it must always come in higher muliplets or be fine-tuned. This theorem holds for both non-interacting and interacting systems as long as the electromagnetic $U(1)_{V,{\rm UV}}$ symmetry is a normal subgroup of the microscopic symmetry group $G_{\mathrm{UV}}$; a condition that is ubiquitous in physical $U(1)_{V,{\rm UV}}$ preserving lattice models. To show that our theorems are tight, we also explore both well-known and new systems that are converses of the no-go theorem, obtained by forfeiting certain assumptions such as a broken time-reversal symmetry (magnetic Weyl semimetal), a non-compact non-on-site $U(1)$ (almost local Dirac node model), no-symmetry protection (fine-tuned Dirac semimetal), or multiple low-energy Dirac nodes (time-reversal invariant Weyl and Dirac semimetals). We will also explicitly demonstrate that, while this theorem strictly prohibits single time-reversal invariant symmetry-protected Dirac node, it does allow for other odd numbers of Dirac nodes under certain circumstances, such as three Dirac nodes in the Fu-Kane-Mele diamond lattice model. This is akin to the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem for an odd number of differently-charged chiral fermions, whose lattice realizations are allowed if certain anomaly cancellation conditions are met.

Title: Thermodynamics in a split Hilbert space: Quantum impurity at the edge of a one-dimensional superconductor
Authors: Pradip Kattel, Abay Zhakenov, Natan Andrei
Abstract: We present a thermodynamic description of a single magnetic impurity at the edge of a superconducting wire. The impurity exhibits four phases $\unicode{x2014}$ Kondo, Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) I and II, and local moment $\unicode{x2014}$ a phase diagram richer than in the gapless case, contrary to the expectation that the effects of impurities in gapped hosts are less consequential. We derive the impurity contribution to free energy $F_{\rm imp}(T)$ and entropy in each phase: in Kondo phase, the entropy flows monotonically from $\ln 2$ (UV) to 0 (IR) with critical exponents same as that of the conventional Kondo model; in YSR phases, thermal activation of a midgap bound state produces entropy overshoots above $\ln 2$, saturating to $\ln 2$ at high $T$ and approaching either 0 or $\ln 2$ at low $T$ depending on whether impurity is screened or not; in the local-moment phase the impurity remains effectively decoupled, with entropy near $\ln 2$, with some intermediate-temperature features that progressively fade as $\delta \to 0$. These behaviors, including the entropy overshoots in the YSR and local-moment phases, stem from a splitting of the Hilbert space into distinct excitation towers: one in the Kondo phase, two in YSR~I, and three in YSR~II and the local-moment phase. Resolving these tower structures and thereby going beyond conventional TBA yields closed-form analytic expressions for the impurity contribution to the free energy and entropy across the entire phase diagram.

Title: Thermodynamics in a split Hilbert space: Quantum impurity at the edge of the Heisenberg chain
Authors: Abay Zhakenov, Pradip Kattel, Natan Andrei
Abstract: We study the isotropic spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Heisenberg chain with a single edge-coupled impurity of arbitrary exchange strength $J$. The model exhibits four impurity phases. For antiferromagnetic couplings ($J>0$): a \textit{Kondo phase} at weak $J$, where the impurity is screened by many-body excitations and the impurity entropy decreases monotonically from $\ln 2$ at $T \to \infty$ to $0$ at $T\to 0$; and an \textit{antiferromagnetic bound-mode (ABM) phase} at strong $J$, where the impurity screened by an exponentially localized bound mode drives $S_{\mathrm{imp}}(T)$ nonmonotonically, with undershoots below zero at intermediate temperatures, while tending to $\ln 2$ as $T \to \infty$ and to $0$ as $T \to 0$. For ferromagnetic couplings ($J<0$): a local-moment (LM) phase at weak $|J|$, where the impurity remains unscreened with $S_{\mathrm{imp}}\to \ln 2$ as $T \to 0$ but exhibits shallow undershoots at intermediate scales; and a \textit{ferromagnetic bound-mode (FBM) phase} at strong $|J|$, where $S_{\mathrm{imp}}=\ln 2$ in both UV and IR limits, yet develops an intermediate-temperature undershoot. We provide an analytic understanding of this behavior, showing that the undershoots originate from the fractionalization of the Hilbert space into several towers of states: for antiferromagnetic couplings this occurs only at strong $J$, driven by boundary-localized bound modes, while for ferromagnetic couplings undershoots occur for all $J<0$, becoming deeper with increasing $|J|$ and vanishing as $J\to 0^{-}$. These bound modes screen the impurity. Incorporating the bound modes and edge states provides a complete analytic understanding of this phenomenon and yields closed expressions for the impurity contribution to free energy and entropy that are valid across all phases. These are checked and found to be in excellent agreement with tensor network and exact diagonalization results.

Title: Quantification of mobile ions in perovskite solar cells with thermally activated ion current measurements
Authors: Moritz C. Schmidt, Agustin O. Alvarez, Riccardo Pallotta, Biruk A. Seid, Jeroen J. de Boer, Jarla Thiesbrummel, Felix Lang, Giulia Grancini, Bruno Ehrler
Abstract: Mobile ions play a key role in the degradation of perovskite solar cells, making their quantification essential for enhancing device stability. Various electrical measurements have been applied to characterize mobile ions. However, discerning between different ionic migration processes can be difficult. Furthermore, multiple measurements at different temperatures are usually required to probe different ions and their activation energies. Here, we demonstrate a new characterization technique based on measuring the thermally activated ion current (TAIC) of perovskite solar cells. The method reveals density, diffusion coefficient, and activation energy of mobile ions within a single temperature sweep and offers an intuitive way to distinguish mobile ion species. We apply the TAIC technique to quantify mobile ions of MAPbI3 and triple-cation perovskite solar cells. We find a higher activation energy and a lower diffusion coefficient in the triple-cation devices. TAIC measurements are a simple yet powerful tool to better understand ion migration in perovskite solar cells.

Title: Non-Hermitian Josephson junctions with four Majorana zero modes
Authors: Jorge Cayao, Masatoshi Sato
Abstract: Josephson junctions formed by finite-length topological superconductors host four Majorana zero modes when the phase difference between the superconductors is $\varphi=\pi$ and their length is larger than the Majorana localization length. While this picture is understood in terms of a Hermitian description of isolated junctions, unavoidable transport conditions due to coupling to reservoirs make them open and ground for non-Hermitian effects that still remain largely unexplored. In this work, we investigate the impact of non-Hermiticity on Josephson junctions hosting four Majorana zero modes when they are coupled to normal leads. We demonstrate that, depending on whether inner or outer Majorana zero modes are subjected to non-Hermiticity, Andreev exceptional points can form between lowest (higher energy) Andreev bound states connected by stable zero real energy lines. We further find that the Andreev exceptional points give rise to strong local and nonlocal spectral weights, thus providing a way for their identification via, e.g., conductance measurements. Our findings unveil non-Hermiticity for designing non-Hermitian topological phases and for operating Andreev bound states in Josephson junctions hosting Majorana zero modes.

Title: Nambu Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics II:Reduction of a complex system to a simple one
Authors: So Katagiri, Yoshiki Matsuoka, Akio Sugamoto
Abstract: Non-equilibrium thermodynamics far from equilibrium is investigated in terms of a generalized ``Nambu dynamics'' (termed Nambu non-equilibrium thermodynamics (NNET)); NNET consists of Nambu dynamics with multiple Hamiltonians and an entropy causing dissipation. It is shown that a general complex non-linear non-equilibrium system far from equilibrium can be reduced to a simple NNET, on the basis of an existence proposition of NNET. This proposition is, however, proved only formally, so that there may exist various obstacles to destroy it. Non-equilibrium thermodynamics studied in this article is quite general, including the case in which the product of dynamical and affinity forces forms a higher-order mixed tensor.

Title: Fermi polarons with the finite-range fermion-impurity interactions
Authors: Nikolay Yegovtsev
Abstract: We study a problem of an infinitely heavy impurity introduced into a polarized Fermi gas, which can be solved exactly with the help of Fumi's theorem. We consider the regime of finite-range fermion-impurity interactions beyond the standard $s$-wave scattering regime and investigate how this affects the energy of the polaron. We show how one can account for the effective range effects as well as the contribution from higher angular momentum channels, which are important for the study of ionic and Rydberg polarons. Our findings have relevance for atomic gas mixtures with a large mass imbalance and for the impurities trapped inside the optical tweezers.

Title: Accurate calculation of light rare-earth magnetic anisotropy with density functional theory
Authors: Liqin Ke, R. Flint, Y. Lee
Abstract: Density functional theory (DFT) has long struggled to treat light rare-earth magnetism. We show that this difficulty arises from an overestimate of the $4f$ charge asphericity, and thus the magnetic anisotropy energy, due to the inadequacy of single Slater-determinant representations. We propose an effective solution by combining constrained DFT+U with crystal field theory and a systematic many-body correction to the charge asphericity. We confirm the validity of this combination on TbV$_6$Sn$_6$ and TbCo$_5$, and then show how the many-body correction adjusts the calculated magnetic anisotropy energy of SmCo$_5$ to match experiment. Our method is an efficient DFT-based approach to address light-rare-earth magnetism.

Title: Band gap formation theory: An alternative to the Bragg diffraction model
Authors: Koichi Kajiyama (Tohoku University, NICHe)
Abstract: The band gap, a key concept in solid-state physics, is traditionally explained by the Bragg diffraction of electron waves in the periodic potential of a crystal. Although widely accepted, this framework raises fundamental issues in one-dimensional systems, where Bragg diffraction-which requires multidirectional wave interactions-reduces to simple interference, thus failing to explain band gap formation. In this paper, we introduce an alternative theory that does not rely on Bragg reflection. Using the Schrödinger equation for Bloch waves, we consider the crystal lattice as a discrete set of observation points. This discreteness introduces a sampling-like constraint analogous to the Nyquist frequency in signal processing. We show that when the electron wavenumber changes under a periodic potential while the lattice spacing remains fixed, a band gap naturally emerges as a sampling effect. By constructing an energy diagram that incorporates this effect, we reveal that the band gap originates from both the wavenumber change and the role of the lattice as discrete samplers, leading the energy curve to exhibit translational and mirror symmetries with respect to the Nyquist wavenumber. This approach provides a novel, physically grounded explanation of band gap formation and can be naturally extended to higher dimensions.

Title: Observation of topological switch between Weyl semimetal and third-order topological insulator phases
Authors: Yu-Hong Han, Yi Li, Feng Mei, Liantuan Xiao, Suotang Jia
Abstract: Weyl semimetals and higher-order topological insulators represent two fundamental yet distinct classes of topological matter. While both have been extensively studied in classical-wave systems, their coexistence and controllable transition within a single platform remain largely unexplored. Meanwhile, implementing three-dimensional spin-orbit couplings, which is crucial for realizing a broad class of higher-dimensional topological phases, continues to pose significant experimental challenges. Here, we experimentally realize three-dimensional spin-orbit couplings and demonstrate that tuning the dimerized spin-orbit coupling strength enables both the coexistence of and a controllable switch between Weyl semimetal and third-order topological insulator phases. By engineering a three-dimensional circuit metamaterial, we synthesize the required spin-orbit interactions and observe hallmark signatures of both phases: frequency spectroscopy reveals the Fermi arcs, while local density of states measurements identify the topological corner modes. Interestingly, the corner mode degeneracy doubles compared to that in the canonical Benalcazar-Bernevig-Hughes model, signaling an enriched topological structure. Our study establishes a fundamental connection between two paradigmatic topological phases and paves the way for further exploring spin-orbit-coupling induced exotic higher-dimensional topological phases.

Title: Half-Quantized Hall Metal and Marginal Metal in Disordered Magnetic Topological Insulators
Authors: Shi-Hao Bi, Bo Fu, Shun-Qing Shen
Abstract: A semimagnetic topological insulator -- a heterostructure combining a topological insulator with a ferromagnet -- exhibits a half-quantized Hall effect, characterized by a quantized Hall conductance of $\frac{1}{2}\frac{e^{2}}{h}$ (where $e$ is the elementary charge and $h$ is the Planck constant), which reinforces the established understanding of topological phenomena in condensed matter physics. However, its stability in realistic, disordered systems remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate the robustness of the half-quantized Hall effect in weakly disordered systems, stemming from a single gapless Dirac cone of fermions and coexisting with weak antilocalization due to the $\pi$ Berry phase that suppresses backscattering. Furthermore, we uncover a marginal metallic phase emerging between weak antilocalization and Anderson insulation -- a transition that defies conventional metal-insulator transitions by lacking an isolated critical point -- where both conductance and normalized localization length exhibit scale invariance, independent of system size. The half-quantized Hall metal and the marginal metallic phase challenge existing localization theories and provide insights into disorder-driven topological phase transitions in magnetic topological insulators, opening avenues for exploring quantum materials and next-generation electronic devices.

Title: Theory of superconductivity and mass enhancement near CDW critical point based on Bethe-Salpeter equation method: application to cuprates
Authors: Youichi Yamakawa, Hiroshi Kontani
Abstract: In recent years, charge-channel orders in strongly correlated metals have attracted great attention. Famous examples are the electronic nematic orders in cuprates and iron-based superconductors, and Star-of-David order in kagome metals. Critical phenomena and unconventional superconductivity arising from fluctuations of such charge-channel orders are central issues today; however, the essential role is played by the vertex corrections, which are the many-body effects that are dropped in conventional mean-field type approximations. To solve this difficulty, in this study, we propose the Bethe-Salpeter equation theory to evaluate electron-electron interactions in two dimensional Hubbard models. This method satisfies the criteria of the Baym-Kadanoff conserving approximation. Here, we find that an attractive interaction in the charge channel emerges from the Aslamazov-Larkin vertex corrections that describe the interference processes among spin fluctuations. Applying this method to the square-lattice Hubbard model, we reveal that the cooperation of attractive charge fluctuations and repulsive spin fluctuations yields high-$T_c$ $d$-wave superconductivity together with enhanced effective mass. These results naturally explain the phase diagram of cuprate superconductors, where strong-coupling $d$-wave superconductivity appears near the charge-order quantum critical point. The theory can also be applied to multi-orbital Hubbard models, like iron-based and nickelate superconductors, suggesting broad potential for future applications.

Title: A non-invasive dry-transfer method for fabricating mesoscopic devices on sensitive materials
Authors: Zhongmou Jia, Yiwen Ma, Zhongchen Xu, Xue Yang, Jianfei Xiao, Jiezhong He, Yunteng Shi, Zhiyuan Zhang, Duolin Wang, Sicheng Zhou, Bingbing Tong, Peiling Li, Ziwei Dou, Xiaohui Song, Guangtong Liu, Jie Shen, Zhaozheng Lyu, Youguo Shi, Jiangping Hu, Li Lu, Fanming Qu
Abstract: Many materials with novel or exotic properties are highly sensitive to environmental factors such as air, solvents, and heat, which complicates device fabrication and limits their potential applications. Here, we present a universal submicron fabrication method for mesoscopic devices using a dry-transfer technique, tailored specifically for sensitive materials. This approach utilizes PMMA masks, combined with a water-dissoluble coating as a sacrificial layer, to ensure that sensitive materials are processed without exposure to harmful environmental conditions. The entire fabrication process is carried out in a glove box, employing dry techniques that avoid air, solvents, and heat exposure, culminating in an encapsulation step. We demonstrate the utility of this method by fabricating and characterizing K2Cr3As3 and WTe2 devices, a one- and two-dimensional material, respectively. The results show that our technique preserves the integrity of the materials, provides excellent contact interfaces, and is broadly applicable to a range of sensitive materials.

Title: Giant Anomalous Hall Conductivity and Gilbert Damping in Room-temperature Ferromagnetic Half-Heusler Alloys PtMnBi
Authors: Hong-Xue Jiang, Jia-wan Li, Shi-Bo Zhao, Jie Wang, Yusheng Hou
Abstract: Half-Heusler alloys have emerged as promising candidates for novel spintronic applications due to their exceptional properties including the high Curie temperature (TC) above room temperature and large anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC). In this work, we systematically study the magnetic and electronic properties of PtMnBi in {\alpha}-, \{beta}-, and {\gamma}-phase using first-principles calculations and Monte Carlo simulations. The three phases are found to be ferromagnetic metals. In particular, the {\alpha}-phase PtMnBi shows a high TC up to 802 K and a relatively large Gilbert damping of 0.085. Additionally, the {\gamma}-phase PtMnBi possesses a non-negligible AHC, reaching 203 {\Omega}-1cm-1 at the Fermi level. To evaluate its potential in nanoscale devices, we further investigate the {\alpha}-phase PtMnBi thin films. The Gilbert dampings of {\alpha}-phase PtMnBi thin films varies with film thickness and we attribute this variation to the distinct band structures at the high-symmetry point {\Gamma}, which arise from differences in film thickness. Moreover, the 1-layer (1L) {\alpha}-phase thin film retains robust ferromagnetism (TC = 688 K) and shows enhanced Gilbert damping (0.14) and AHC (1116 {\Omega}-1cm-1) compared to the bulk. Intriguingly, under a 2% in-plane biaxial compressive strain, the Gilbert damping of 1L {\alpha}-phase PtMnBi thin film increases to 0.17 and the AHC reaches 2386 {\Omega}-1cm-1. The coexistence of giant Gilbert damping and large AHC makes {\alpha}-phase PtMnBi a compelling platform for practical spintronic applications, and highlights the potential of half-Heusler alloys in spintronic device design.

Title: Multiband Superconductivity and High Critical Current Density in Entropy Stabilized Nb0.25Ta0.25Ti0.25Zr0.25
Authors: Nikita Sharma, Kuldeep Kargeti, Neha Sharma, Pooja Chourasia, B. Vignolle, Olivier Toulemonde, Tirthankar Chakraborty, S. K. Panda, Sourav Marik
Abstract: High and medium-entropy superconductors with significant intrinsic disorder are a fascinating class of superconductors. Their combination of robust structural integrity, superior mechanical properties, and exceptional irradiation tolerance makes them promising candidates for use in advanced superconducting technologies. Herein, we present a comprehensive theoretical and experimental investigation on the superconductivity of equiatomic entropy-stabilized Nb0.25Ta0.25Ti0.25Zr0.25. The material shows bulk superconductivity (transition temperature = 8K) with a high upper critical field of 11.94T. Interestingly, both the electronic band structure and specific heat data point toward unconventional multiband superconductivity. Our ab initio calculations reveal Dirac-like band crossings close to the Fermi level, with certain degeneracies persisting even in the presence of spin-orbit coupling, suggesting a possible interplay between topological electronic states and the observed unconventional superconductivity. Remarkably, the critical current density exceeds the benchmark of 10^5 A/cm2, surpassing all previously reported as-cast entropy-stabilized superconductors. This high critical current density is likely attributed to strong flux pinning at the grain boundaries, facilitated by extreme intrinsic lattice distortion. Taken together, the demonstrated dynamical stability, excellent metallicity, potential to host unconventional superconductivity, and exceptionally high critical current density highlight the potential of entropy-stabilized alloys as a platform for exploring the confluence of disorder, topology, and unconventional superconductivity.

Title: Intrinsic nonlinear valley Nernst effect
Authors: Xue-Jin Zhang, Jin Cao, Lulu Xiong, Hui Wang, Shen Lai, Cong Xiao, Shengyuan A. Yang
Abstract: We investigate the intrinsic nonlinear valley Nernst effect, which induces a transverse valley current via a second-order thermoelectric response to a longitudinal temperature gradient. The effect arises from the Berry connection polarizability dipole of valley electrons and is permissible in both inversion-symmetric and inversion-asymmetric materials. We demonstrate that the response tensor is connected to the intrinsic nonlinear valley Hall conductivity through a generalized Mott relation, with the two being directly proportional at low temperatures, scaled by the Lorenz number. We elucidate the symmetry constraints governing this effect and develop a theory for its nonlocal measurement, revealing a nonlocal second-harmonic signal with a distinct $\rho^2$ scaling. This signal comprises two scaling terms, with their ratio corresponding to the square of the thermopower normalized by the Lorenz number. Key characteristics are demonstrated using a tilted Dirac model and first-principles calculations on bilayer WTe$_2$. Possible extrinsic contributions and alternative experimental detection methods, e.g., by valley pumping and by nonreciprocal directional dichroism, are discussed. These findings underscore the significance of band quantum geometry on electron dynamics and establish a theoretical foundation for nonlinear valley caloritronics.

Title: Optical Switching of Moiré Chern Ferromagnet
Authors: Xiangbin Cai, Haiyang Pan, Yuzhu Wang, Abdullah Rasmita, Shunshun Yang, Yan Zhao, Wei Wang, Ruihuan Duan, Ruihua He, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Zheng Liu, Jesús Zúñiga Pérez, Bo Yang, Weibo Gao
Abstract: Optical manipulation of quantum matter offers a non-contact, high-precision and fast control. Fractional Chern ferromagnet states in moiré superlattices are promising for topological quantum computing, but an effective optical control protocol has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate robust optical switching of integer and fractional Chern ferromagnets in twisted MoTe2 bilayers using circularly polarized light. Highly efficient optical manipulation of spin orientations in the topological ferromagnet regime is realized at zero field using a pump light power as low as 28 nanowatts per square micrometer. Utilizing this optically induced transition, we also demonstrate magnetic bistate cycling and spatially resolved writing of ferromagnetic domain walls. This work establishes a reliable and efficient optical control scheme for moiré Chern ferromagnets, paving the way for dissipationless spintronics and quantized Chern junction devices.

Title: A phenomenological universal expression for the condensate fraction in strongly-correlated two-dimensional Bose gases
Authors: G.E. Astrakharchik, I.L. Kurbakov, N.A. Asriyan, Yu. E. Lozovik
Abstract: We investigate the relation between non-local and energetic properties in 2D quantum systems of zero-temperature bosons. By analyzing numerous interaction potentials across densities spanning from perturbative to strongly correlated regime, we discover a novel high-precision quantum phenomenological universality: the condensate fraction can be expressed through kinetic energy and quantum energy, defined as total energy relative to classical crystal state. Quantum Monte Carlo simulations accurately validate our analytical expression. Furthermore, we test the obtained relation on the fundamental example of a non-perturbative system, namely, the liquid helium. The proposed relation is relevant to experiments with excitons in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC) materials, as well as ultracold atoms and other quantum systems in reduced dimensionality.

Title: Multi-value Probabilistic Computing with current-controlled Skyrmion Diffusion
Authors: Thomas B. Winkler, Yuean Zhou, Grischa Beneke, Fabian Kammerbauer, Sachin Krishnia, Mario Carpentieri, Davi R. Rodrigues, Mathias Kläui, Johan H. Mentink
Abstract: Magnetic systems are highly promising for implementing probabilistic computing paradigms because of the fitting energy scales and conspicuous non-linearities. While conventional binary probabilistic computing has been realized, implementing more advantageous multi-value probabilistic computing (MPC) remains a challenge. Here, we report the realization of MPC by leveraging the thermally activated diffusion of magnetic skyrmions through an effectively non-flat energy landscape defined by a discrete number of pinning sites. The time-averaged spatial distribution of the diffusing skyrmions directly realizes a discrete probability distribution, which is tunable by current-generated spin-orbit torques, and can be quantified by non-perturbative electrical measurements. Even a very straightforward implementation with global tuning, already allows us to demonstrate the softmax computation - a core function in artificial intelligence. As a key advance, we demonstrate invertible logic without the need to create a network of probabilistic devices, offering major scalability advantages. Our proof of concept can be generalized to multiple skyrmions and can accommodate multiple locally tunable inputs and outputs using magnetic tunnel junctions, potentially enabling the representation of highly complex distribution functions.

Title: Inverse Elastica: A Theoretical Framework for Inverse Design of Morphing Slender Structures
Authors: JiaHao Li, Weicheng Huang, YinBo Zhu, Luxia Yu, Xiaohao Sun, Mingchao Liu, HengAn Wu
Abstract: Inverse design of morphing slender structures with programmable curvature has significant applications in various engineering fields. Most existing studies formulate it as an optimization problem, which requires repeatedly solving the forward equations to identify optimal designs. Such methods, however, are computationally intensive and often susceptible to local minima issues. In contrast, solving the inverse problem theoretically, which can bypass the need for optimizations, is highly efficient yet remains challenging, particularly for cases involving arbitrary boundary conditions (BCs). Here, we develop a systematic theoretical framework, termed inverse elastica, for the direct determination of the undeformed configuration from a target deformed shape along with prescribed BCs. Building upon the classical elastica, inverse elastica is derived by supplementing the geometric equations of undeformed configurations. The framework shows three key features: reduced nonlinearity, solution multiplicity, and inverse loading. These principles are demonstrated through two representative models: an analytical solution for a two-dimensional arc and a numerical continuation study of the inverse loading of a three-dimensional helical spring. Furthermore, we develop a theory-assisted optimization strategy for cases in which the constrains of the undeformed configurations cannot be directly formulated as BCs. Using this strategy, we achieve rational inverse design of complex spatial curves and curve-discretized surfaces with varying Gaussian curvatures. Our theoretical predictions are validated through both discrete elastic rod simulations and experiments.

Title: Atomistic insights into hydrogen migration in IGZO from machine-learning interatomic potential: linking atomic diffusion to device performance
Authors: Hyunsung Cho, Minseok Moon, Jaehoon Kim, Eunkyung Koh, Hyeon-Deuk Kim, Rokyeon Kim, Gyehyun Park, Seungwu Han, Youngho Kang
Abstract: Understanding hydrogen diffusion is critical for improving the reliability and performance of oxide thin-film transistors (TFTs), where hydrogen plays a key role in carrier modulation and bias instability. In this work, we investigate hydrogen diffusion in amorphous IGZO ($a$-IGZO) and $c$-axis aligned crystalline IGZO (CAAC-IGZO) using machine learning interatomic potential molecular dynamics (MLIP-MD) simulations. We construct accurate phase-specific MLIPs by fine-tuning SevenNet-0, a universal pretrained MLIP, and validate the models against a comprehensive dataset covering hydrogen-related configurations and diffusion environments. Hydrogen diffusivity is evaluated over 650--1700 K, revealing enhanced mobility above 750 K in $a$-IGZO due to the glassy matrix, while diffusion at lower temperatures is constrained by the rigid network. Arrhenius extrapolation of the diffusivity indicates that hydrogen in $a$-IGZO can reach the channel/insulator interface within $10^{4}$ seconds at 300--400 K, likely contributing to negative bias stress-induced device degradation. Trajectory analysis reveals that long-range diffusion in $a$-IGZO is enabled by a combination of hydrogen hopping and flipping mechanisms. In CAAC-IGZO, hydrogen exhibits high in-plane diffusivity but severely restricted out-of-plane transport due to a high energy barrier along the $c$-axis. This limited vertical diffusion in CAAC-IGZO suggests minimal impact on bias instability. This work bridges the atomic-level hydrogen transport mechanism and device-level performance in oxide TFTs by leveraging large-scale MLIP-MD simulations.

Title: Ultrafast Spin Accumulations Drive Magnetization Reversal in Multilayers
Authors: Harjinder Singh, Alberto Anadón, Junta Igarashi, Quentin Remy, Stéphane Mangin, Michel Hehn, Jon Gorchon, Gregory Malinowski
Abstract: Engineering and controlling heat and spin transport on the femtosecond time-scale in spintronic devices opens up new ways to manipulate magnetization with unprecedented speed. Yet the underlying reversal mechanisms remain poorly understood due to the challenges of probing ultrafast, non-equilibrium spin dynamics. In this study, we demonstrate that typical magneto-optical experiments can be leveraged to access the time evolution of the spin accumulation generated within a magnetic multilayer following an ultrafast laser excitation. Furthermore, our analysis shows that the final magnetic state of the free-layer in a spin-valve is mainly dictated by the ultrafast dynamics of the reference-layer magnetization. Our results disentangle magnetization and spin transport dynamics within a multilayer stack and identify demagnetization and remagnetization-driven spin accumulation as the key mechanism for all-optical switching. These findings establish new design principles for ultrafast spintronic devices based on tailored spin current engineering.

Title: MnBr$_2$ on the graphene on Ir(110) substrate: growth, structure, and super-moiré
Authors: Affan Safeer, Oktay Güleryüz, Nicolae Atodiresei, Wouter Jolie, Thomas Michely, Jeison Fischer
Abstract: Single-layer MnBr$_2$ is grown on graphene (Gr) supported by Ir(110) and investigated using low-energy electron diffraction, scanning tunneling microscopy, and spectroscopy. The structure and epitaxial relationship with the substrate are systematically characterized. The growth morphology strongly depends on the growth temperature, evolving from fractal to dendritic and eventually to compact dendritic skeletal islands, reflecting changes in the underlying surface diffusion processes. MnBr$_2$ on Gr/Ir(110) constitutes a three-lattice system, giving rise to a super-moiré pattern --a moiré of moirés. Due to the involvement of lattices of differing symmetries and the partial electronic transparency of Gr, a "virtual" moiré formed by MnBr$_2$ and Ir(110) contributes to the super-moiré formation. Ab initio calculations play a crucial role in understanding the complexity of super-moiré. Moreover, the pronounced variation in the apparent height with tunneling conditions for the magnetic insulator is explained based on the measured electronic structure.

Title: Kinetic pathways of coesite densification from metadynamics
Authors: David Vrba, Roman Martoňák
Abstract: We study compression of coesite to pressures above 35 GPa, substantially beyond the equilibrium transition pressure to octahedral phases (8 GPa to stishovite). Experiments at room temperature showed that up to 30 GPa the metastable coesite structure develops only minor displacive changes (coesite-II and coesite-III) while the Si atoms remain 4-coordinated. Beyond 30 GPa, reconstructive transformations start, following different pathways from the complex structure of coesite. Besides amorphization, two different crystalline outcomes were observed. One is formation of defective high-pressure octahedral phases (Hu et al., 2015) and another one is formation of unusual and complex dense phases coesite-IV and coesite-V with Si atoms in 4-fold, 5-fold and 6-fold coordination (Bykova et al., 2018). Capturing these structural transformations computationally represents a challenge. Here we show that employing metadynamics with Si-O coordination number and volume as generic collective variables in combination with a machine-learning based ACE potential (Erhard et al., 2024), one naturally observes all three mentioned pathways, resulting in the phases observed experimentally. We describe the atomistic mechanisms along the transformation pathways. While the pathway to coesite-IV is simpler, the transformation to octahedral phases involves two steps: first, a hcp sublattice of O atoms is formed where Si atoms occupy octahedral positions but the octahedra chains do not form a regular pattern. In the second step, the Si atoms order and the chains develop a more regular arrangement. We predict that the pathway to coesite-IV is preferred at room temperature, while at 600 K the formation of octahedral phases is more likely.

Title: Charge current and phase diagram of the disordered open longer-range Kitaev chain
Authors: Emmanuele G. Cinnirella, Andrea Nava, Domenico Giuliano
Abstract: We compute the disorder averaged dc conductance in the non-equilibrium steady state that sets in between a longer-range Kitaev chain and a metallic lead connected to an external reservoir, as a function of the system parameters and of the disorder strength. From our results, we map out the phase diagram of the disordered chain for different types of disorder and discuss the corresponding effects of the interplay between topology and disorder in the system. To do so, we set up a combined analytical and numerical approach, which is potentially amenable of straightforward generalizations to other disordered topological systems.

Title: Majorana Diagrammatics for Quantum Spin-1/2 Models
Authors: Thibault Noblet, Laura Messio, Riccardo Rossi
Abstract: A diagrammatic formalism for lattices of 1/2 is developed. It is based on an unconstrained mapping between spin and Majorana operators. This allows the use of standard tools of diagrammatic quantum many-body theory without requiring projections. We derive, in particular, the Feynman rules for the expansion around a color-preserving mean-field theory. We then present the numerical results obtained by computing the corrections up to second order for the Heisenberg model in one and two dimensions, showing that perturbative corrections are not only numerically important, but also qualitatively improve the results of mean-field theory. These results pave the way for the use of Majorana diagrammatic tools in theoretical and numerical studies of quantum spin systems.

Title: Search for thermodynamically stable ambient-pressure superconducting hydrides in GNoME database
Authors: Antonio Sanna, Tiago F. T. Cerqueira, Ekin Dogus Cubuk, Ion Errea, Yue-Wen Fang
Abstract: Hydrides are considered to be one of the most promising families of compounds for achieving high temperature superconductivity. However, there are very few experimental reports of ambient-pressure hydride superconductivity, and the superconducting critical temperatures ($T_{\rm c}$) are typically less than 10 K. At the same time several hydrides have been predicted to exhibit superconductivity around 100 K at ambient pressure but in thermodynamically unfavorable phases. In this work we aim at assessing the superconducting properties of thermodynamically stable hydride superconductors at room pressure by investigating the GNoME material database, which has been recently released and includes thousands of thermodynamically stable hydrides. To scan this large material space we have adopted a multi stage approach which combines machine learning for a fast initial evaluation and cutting edge ab initio methods to obtain a reliable estimation of $T_{\rm c}$. Ultimately we have identified 22 cubic thermodynamically stable hydrides with $T_{\rm c}$ above 4.2 K and reach a maximum $T_{\rm c}$ of 17 K. While these critical temperatures are modest in comparison to some recent predictions, the systems where they are found, being stable, are likely to be experimentally accessible and of potential technological relevance.

Title: Regularized Micromagnetic Theory for Bloch Points
Authors: Vladyslav M. Kuchkin, Andreas Haller, Andreas Michels, Thomas L. Schmidt, Nikolai S. Kiselev
Abstract: Magnetic singularities known as Bloch points (BPs) present a fundamental challenge for micromagnetic theory, which is based on the assumption of a fixed magnetization vector length. Due to the divergence of the effective field at a BP, classical micromagnetics fails to adequately describe BP dynamics. To address this issue, we propose a regularized micromagnetic model in which the magnetization vector can vary in length but not exceed a threshold value. More specifically, the magnetization is treated as an order parameter constrained to a S3-sphere. This constraint respects fundamental properties of local spin expectation values in quantum systems. We derive the corresponding regularized Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation and the analogue of the Thiele equation describing the steady motion of spin textures under various external stimuli. We demonstrate the applicability of our theory by modeling the dynamics of several magnetic textures containing BPs, including domain walls in nanowires, chiral bobbers, and magnetic dipolar strings. The presented results extend micromagnetic theory by incorporating a regularized description of BP dynamics.

Title: Emissive perovskite quantum wires in robust nanocontainers
Authors: Bea Botka, Erzsébet Dodony, Ildikó Harsányi, Michael Stratton, János Mózer, Éva Kováts, Katalin Kamarás
Abstract: Light emissive nanostructures were prepared from boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) filled with inorganic lead halide perovskites. BNNTs provide a platform for facile synthesis of high aspect ratio perovskite quantum wires having color-tunable, highly polarized emission. BNNTs form a flexible and robust protective shell around individual nanowires, that mitigate degradation during post-processing for practical applications, while allowing to exploit the emission of the perovskite nanowires due to its optical transparency. The wire diameter can be tuned by choosing appropriate BNNT hosts, giving easy access to the strongly quantum confined diameter range. The individual encapsulated quantum wires can be used as building blocks for nanoscale photonic devices, and to create large-scale flexible assemblies.

Title: Exotic rheology of materials with active rearrangements
Authors: Aondoyima Ioratim-Uba, Tanniemola B. Liverpool, Silke Henkes
Abstract: The flow of biological tissues during development is controlled through the active stresses generated by cells interacting with their mechanical environment in the tissue. Many developmental processes are driven by convergence-extension flows where the tissue has an emergent negative shear modulus and viscosity. This exotic rheology is generated through active T1 transitions where rearrangements are opposite the applied stress direction. Here, we introduce a mean-field elasto-plastic model which shows convergence-extension, based on the Hebraud-Lequeux model, that includes both passive and active elastic elements with opposite stress responses. We find that the introduction of active elements profoundly changes the rheology. Beyond a threshold fraction of active elements, it gives rise to non-monotonic flow curves and negative stresses at positive strain rates. Controlled by the active fraction and the stress diffusion rate, we find both yield stress materials and fluids, with either a positive or negative yield stress or viscosity. These features are characteristic of metamaterials, and highlight how biology uses disordered, active materials with exotic rheology.

Title: Tunable quantum anomalous Hall effect in fullerene monolayers
Authors: Leonard Werner Pingen, Jiaqi Wu, Bo Peng
Abstract: Nearly four decades after its theoretical prediction, the search for material realizations of quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) remains a highly active field of research. Many materials have been predicted to exhibit quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) physics under feasible conditions but the experimental verification remains widely elusive. In this work, we propose an alternative approach towards QAH materials design by engineering customized molecular building blocks. We demonstrate this ansatz for a two-dimensional (2D) honeycomb lattice of C26 fullerenes, which exhibits a ferromagnetic ground state and thus breaks time-reversal symmetry. The molecular system is found to be highly tunable with respect to its magnetic degrees of freedom and applied strain, giving rise to a rich phase diagram with Chern numbers C= +/-2, +/-1, 0. Our proposal offers a versatile platform to realize tunable QAH physics under accessible conditions and provides an experimentally feasible approach for chemical synthesis of molecular networks with QAHE.

Title: Microscale optoelectronic reservoir networks of halide perovskite for in-sensor computing
Authors: Jeroen J. de Boer, Agustin O. Alvarez, Moritz C. Schmidt, Bruno Ehrler
Abstract: Physical reservoir computing is a promising framework for efficient neuromorphic in and near-sensor computing applications. Here, we demonstrate a multimodal optoelectronic reservoir network based on halide perovskite semiconductor devices, capable of processing both voltage and light inputs. The devices consist of micrometer-sized, asymmetric crossbars covered with a MAPbI3 perovskite film. In a network, we simulate the performance by transforming MNIST images and videos based on the NMNIST dataset using 4-bit inputs and training linear readout layers for classification. We demonstrate multimodal networks capable of processing both voltage and light inputs, reaching mean accuracies up to 95.3 p/m 0.1% and 87.8 p/m 0.1% for image and video classification, respectively. We observed only minor deterioration due to measurement noise. The networks significantly outperformed linear classifier references, by 3.1% for images and 14.6% for video. We show that longer retention times benefit classification accuracy for single-mode networks, and give guidelines for choosing optimal experimental parameters. Moreover, the microscale device architecture lends itself well to further downscaling in high-density sensor arrays, making the devices ideal for efficient in-sensor computing.

Title: Multi-origin driven giant planar Hall effect in topological antiferromagnet EuAl2Si2 with tunable spin texture
Authors: Xiangqi Liu, Ziyi Zhu, Yixuan Luo, Zhengyang Li, Bo Bai, Jingcheng Huang, Xia Wang, Chuanying Xi, Li Pi, Guanxiang Du, Leiming Chen, Wenbo Wang, Wei Xia, Yanfeng Guo
Abstract: In topological materials, the planar Hall effect (PHE) is often regarded as a hallmark of profound quantum phenomena-most notably the Adler-Bell-Jackiw chiral anomaly and Berry curvature-rendering it an indispensable tool for deciphering the topological essence of emergent phases. In this study, we delve into the PHE and anisotropic magnetoresistance in the recently discovered layered topological antiferromagnet EuAl2Si2. Our analysis of the robust PHE signal (~3.8 {\mu}{\Omega} cm at 2 K and 8 T) unveils a distinct interplay of mechanisms. While Berry curvature plays a minor role, the dominant contributions stem from classical orbital MR in the field-induced ferromagnetic state and field-suppressed spin fluctuations in the paramagnetic regime. These insights not only position EuAl2Si2-with its highly tunable spin texture-as an exemplary system for probing the intricate coupling between spin configurations and band topology in magnetotransport but also pave the way for designing novel materials with tailored PHE responses, highlighting significant application prospects in quantum sensing, spintronic devices, and topologically protected electronic systems.

Title: Decoupling dynamics and crosslink stability in supramolecular hydrogels using associative exchange
Authors: Pierre Le Bourdonnec, Charafeddine Ferkous, Leo Communal, Luca Cipelletti, Rémi Merindol
Abstract: The design of hydrogels that combine mechanical robustness with dynamic reconfigurability remains a fundamental challenge, as increasing crosslink dissociation rates compromise network integrity. This limitation is addressed through the incorporation of an associative crosslink exchange into DNA-based supramolecular hydrogels, enabling the decoupling of network relaxation behavior from crosslink stability. The hydrogels are constructed from enzyme-synthesized single-stranded DNA that self-assembles via hybridization between complementary domains. These crosslinks can reorganize through dissociative melting or associative strand displacement reaction, yielding networks with tunable relaxation timescales spanning over three orders of magnitude. Rheological measurements and thermodynamic modeling confirm that associative exchange facilitates efficient stress dissipation without diminishing rupture strength or thermal stability. In contrast, dissociative systems inherently trade increased dynamics with mechanical weakening. This decoupling is achieved through the implementation of a catalytic reorganization pathway governed by the composition of the sample, independently of crosslink strength. These findings establish the mechanism of reorganization as a key design parameter for engineering adaptive soft materials that combine resilience and responsiveness.

Title: Nanoscale mechanics and ultralow Friction of natural 2D silicates: Biotite and Rhodonite
Authors: Surbhi Slathia, Manoj Tripathi, Raphael Benjamim de Oliveira, Guilherme da Silva Lopes Fabris, Bruno Ipaves, Raphael Matozo Tromer, Marcelo Lopes Pereira Junior, Gelu Costin, Preeti Lata Mahapatraa, Nicholas R. Glavin, Ajit K. Roy, Venkataramana Gadhamshetty, Douglas Soares Galvao, Alan Dalton, Chandra Sekhar Tiwary
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) silicates have emerged as a promising class of ultrathin materials, expanding the landscape of 2D systems beyond conventional van der Waals crystals. Their unique crystal chemistries and structural anisotropies make them attractive for applications ranging from sensors and flexoelectric devices to drug delivery and catalysis. To unlock their full potential, it is critical to understand their thickness-dependent mechanical properties within the family of 2D silicates. In this study, we investigate the nanomechanical and frictional behaviors of two structurally distinct natural silicates: layered Biotite and chain-structured Rhodonite. Using atomic force microscopy (AFM), we found that Rhodonite exhibits nearly ten times higher adhesion force and modulus response compared to Biotite. Despite this, Biotite demonstrates superior frictional performance, with ultrathin (5 nm) flakes showing a remarkably low coefficient of friction ($\sim 0.6 \times 10^{-3}$) versus Rhodonite ($\sim 3.6 \times 10^{-3}$). To further elucidate interlayer adhesion, density functional theory (DFT) calculations with Hubbard correction were employed. These findings offer valuable insights into the design and selection of 2D silicates for advanced mechanical and tribological applications.

Title: Unlocking Doping Effects on Altermagnetism in MnTe
Authors: Nayana Devaraj, Anumita Bose, Arindom Das, Md Afsar Reja, Arijit Mandal, Awadhesh Narayan, B. R. K. Nanda
Abstract: Governed by specific symmetries, altermagnetism is an emerging field in condensed matter physics, characterized by unique spin-splitting of the bands in the momentum space co-existing with the compensated magnetization as in antiferromagnets. As crystals can have tailored and unintended defects, it is important to gain insights on how altermagnets are affected by the defects-driven symmetry-breaking which, in turn, can build promising perspectives on potential applications. In this study, considering the widely investigated MnTe as a prototype altermagnet, defects are introduced through substitutional doping to create a large configuration space of spin space groups. With the aid of density functional theory calculations, symmetry analysis, and model studies in this configuration space, we demonstrate the generic presence of spin-split of the antiferromagnetic bands in the momentum space. This is indicative of a wider class of quasi-altermagnetic materials, augmenting the set of ideal altermagnetic systems. Furthermore, we show that while pristine MnTe does not show anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) with out-of-plane magnetization, suitable doping can be carried out to obtain finite and varied AHC. Our predictions of quasi-altermagnetism and doping driven tailored AHC have the potential to open up as-yet-unexplored directions in this developing field.

Title: Excitonic skin effect
Authors: Wenhui Xu, Qi Zhou
Abstract: We show that strong interactions combined with band-dependent imaginary vector potentials give rise to boundary localization of particle-hole pairs, which we term the excitonic skin effect. In a bilayer system with layer-specific gain/loss and an in-plane magnetic field, excitons experience a net imaginary vector potential, resulting in directional amplification of particle-hole pairs. Including nearest-neighbor interactions leads to a non-Hermitian bosonic Kitaev model, where the pairing effects grow exponentially with the size of the system, revealing a unique form of critical skin effect in interacting systems. Our framework applies to both atomic and electronic platforms and is directly testable in current experiments. These results also provide a route to explore non-Hermitian analogs of tensor gauge fields.

Title: Tunable multi-magnon Floquet topological edge states
Authors: Ivan Martinez-Berumen, W. A. Coish, T. Pereg-Barnea
Abstract: We show that periodically time-modulating the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) in a two-dimensional magnon insulator may induce a topological phase transition that results in the presence of robust edge modes. To this end, we study a square lattice of spins interacting via an XXZ Heisenberg model with a ferromagnetic longitudinal coupling and antiferromagnetic transverse coupling, as well as the aforementioned time-modulated DMI. The topologically protected edge states of this system are composed of coherent superpositions of single-magnon excitations and two magnon bound states. Furthermore, we show that the chirality of the edge states can be controlled by adjusting the relative phase for the drive on the DMI associated with nearest neighbors in the x and y directions.

Title: Correlated decoherence and thermometry with mobile impurities in a 1D Fermi gas
Authors: Sindre Brattegard, Thomás Fogarty, Thomas Busch, Mark T. Mitchison
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the correlated decoherence dynamics of two mobile impurities trapped within a gas of ultracold fermionic atoms. We use a mean-field approximation to self-consistently describe the effect of impurity-gas collisions on impurity motion, while decoherence of the impurities' internal state is computed exactly within a functional determinant approach. At equilibrium, we find that the impurities undergo bath-induced localisation as the impurity-gas interaction strength is increased. We then study the non-equilibrium dynamics induced by a sudden change of the impurities' internal state, which can be experimentally probed by Ramsey interferometry. Our theoretical approach allows us to investigate the effect of impurity motion on decoherence dynamics, finding strong deviations from the universal behaviour associated with Anderson's orthogonality catastrophe when the mass imbalance between impurity and gas atoms is small. Finally, we show that mobile impurities can be used as thermometers of their environment and that bath-mediated correlations can be beneficial for thermometric performance at low temperatures, even in the presence of non-trivial impurity motion. Our results showcase the interesting open quantum dynamics of mobile impurities dephasing in a common environment, and could help provide more precise temperature estimates of ultracold fermionic mixtures.

Title: Wave coarsening drives time crystallization in active solids
Authors: Jonas Veenstra, Jack Binysh, Vito Seinen, Rutger Naber, Damien Robledo Poisson, Andres Hunt, Wim van Saarloos, Anton Souslov, Corentin Coulais
Abstract: When metals are magnetized, emulsions phase separate, or galaxies cluster, domain walls and patterns form and irremediably coarsen over time. Such coarsening is universally driven by diffusive relaxation toward equilibrium. Here, we discover an inertial counterpart - wave coarsening - in active elastic media, where vibrations emerge and spontaneously grow in wavelength, period, and amplitude, before a globally synchronized state called a time crystal forms. We observe wave coarsening in one- and two-dimensional solids and capture its dynamical scaling. We further arrest the process by breaking momentum conservation and reveal a far-from-equilibrium nonlinear analogue to chiral topological edge modes. Our work unveils the crucial role of symmetries in the formation of time crystals and opens avenues for the control of nonlinear vibrations in active materials.

Title: Anomalous tensorial properties of anisotropic 2D materials
Authors: Elizabeth J. Dresselhaus, Sanjay Govindjee, Kranthi K. Mandadapu
Abstract: Odd transport phenomena -- defined as a flux response orthogonal to an applied gradient -- have been recently observed in isotropic systems, with a multitude of proposed models and experiments to study these effects. Odd transport manifests in tensors that describe linear relations between fluxes and gradients that drive them, particularly when parity and time-reversal symmetries are broken. In this work, we identify such odd properties to be a subset of a broader class of major-symmetry-breaking behaviors, which we term ``anomalous." We develop a classification of anomalous properties described by $2^\mathrm{nd}$ and $4^\mathrm{th}$ order tensors in anisotropic 2D materials that maintain discrete rotational and reflection symmetries, characterized by the 17 wallpaper groups. To this end, we present representation theorems for these tensors, identifying which components are constrained for specific spatial symmetries and thereby allowing materials to be grouped into classes that exhibit anomalous responses or not. We focus our discussion on $2^\mathrm{nd}$ order tensors in the context of electrical resistivity and on $4^\mathrm{th}$ order tensors in the context of viscosity and elasticity. These findings are broadly applicable to the study of novel emergent material properties. To illustrate this, we discuss implications of our findings for two very different 2D materials that have recently garnered attention in condensed matter physics: knitted fabrics and twisted bilayer graphene.

Title: Phase transition properties via partition function zeros: The Blume-Capel ferromagnet revisited
Authors: Leïla Moueddene, Nikolaos G Fytas, Bertrand Berche
Abstract: Since the landmark work of Lee and Yang, locating the zeros of the partition function in the complex magnetic-field plane has become a powerful method for studying phase transitions. Fisher later extended this approach to complex temperatures, and subsequent generalizations introduced other control parameters, such as the crystal field. In previous works [Moueddene et al, J. Stat. Mech. (2024) 023206; Phys. Rev. E 110, 064144 (2024)] we applied this framework to the two- and three-dimensional Blume-Capel model -- a system with a rich phase structure where a second-order critical line meets a first-order line at a tricritical point. We showed that the scaling of Lee-Yang, Fisher, and crystal-field zeros yields accurate critical exponents even for modest lattice sizes. In the present study, we extend this analysis and demonstrate that simulations need not be performed exactly at the nominal transition point to obtain reliable exponent estimates. Strikingly, small system sizes are sufficient, which not only improves methodological efficiency but also advances the broader goal of reducing the carbon footprint of large-scale computational studies.

Abstract: Fast computational method for Hertzian contact theory is proposed. An incremental formula is introduced to calculate the ellipticity of the contact disk when two elastic bodies are in contact. This method can determine the ellipticity with good accuracy in a small number of iterations is reported. This method is also shown to be applicable from the case of a near perfect circle to the case where the major diameter is sufficiently long compared to the minor diameter.

Title: The Binding Energies of Atoms on Amorphous Silicate Dust: A Computational Study
Authors: Kristoffer Hansson, W. M. C. Sameera, Clarke J. Esmerian, Duncan Bossion, Stefan Andersson, Susanne Aalto, Wouter Vlemmings, Kirsten K. Knudsen, Gunnar Nyman
Abstract: Context. We investigate the binding energies of atoms to interstellar dust particles, which play a key role in their growth and evolution, as well as for the chemical reactions on their surfaces. Aims. We aim to compute the binding energies of abundant atoms in the interstellar medium (C, N, O, Mg, Al, Si, S, Ca, Fe, and Ni) to silicate dust. Methods. We used the Geometries, Frequencies, and Non-covalent Interactions Tight Binding (GFN1-xTB) method to compute the binding energies. An FeMgSiO$_4$ periodic surface model, containing 81 local minima on the surface, was used. Results. A range of binding energies was found for each element. The median of the binding energies follows the order Si (14.8 eV) > Al (12.8 eV) > Ca (12.7 eV) > C (9.5 eV) > O (8.1 eV) > N (6.2 eV) > Fe (6.0 eV) > S (5.2 eV) > Mg (2.4 eV). The probability distribution of binding energies for each element except Ca is statistically consistent with a log-normal distribution. Conclusions. In general, Si, Ca, and Al atoms have large binding energies. Thus, these atoms can stay on the silicate dust particles at high temperatures. The binding energies of the other atoms, C, N, O, Mg, S, Fe and Ni, are relatively weak. However, the computed binding energies for these elements are still far stronger than the energies associated with dust temperatures typical of the ambient interstellar medium (ISM), suggesting that silicate grains are generally stable against sublimation. We estimate sublimation temperatures for silicate grains to range from 1600 K to 3000K depending on assumed grain size and lifetime. These binding energies on silicate dust grains, estimated from first principles for the first time, provide invaluable input to models of dust evolution and dust-catalyzed chemical reactions in the interstellar medium.

Title: Optimal Finite-Time Thermodynamics of Effective Two-Level Systems
Authors: Alberto Rolandi
Abstract: The optimization of the conversion of thermal energy into work and the minimization of dissipation for nano- and mesoscopic systems is a complex challenge because of the important role fluctuations play on the dynamics of small systems. We generalize the work of Esposito et al. EPL 89, 20003 (2010) to optimize at all driving speeds the control needed to extract the maximum amount of work from any effective two-level systems. These emerge when one coarse-grains degrees of freedom, which is often unavoidable to obtain "real-world" two-level systems. In particular, we allow even for the system to have underlying quantum dynamics, as long as these allow for a coarse-graining that leads to a Markovian master equation. We analyze the finite-time thermodynamics of these systems and find the thermodynamically optimal protocols, which depend on the size of the coarse-graining needed to obtain a two-level system. Furthermore, we use these results to derive speed-limits for any transformation performed on an effective two-level system.

Title: Entanglement Hamiltonian after a local quench
Authors: Riccarda Bonsignori, Viktor Eisler
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of the entanglement Hamiltonian in a system of one-dimensional free fermions, following a local joining quench of two initially disconnected half-chains in their ground states. Applying techniques of conformal field theory, we obtain a local expression where the left- and right-moving components of the energy density are associated with different weight functions. The results are then compared to numerical calculations for the hopping chain, which requires to consider a proper continuum limit of the lattice entanglement Hamiltonian, obtaining a good agreement with the field-theory prediction.

Title: Quantum Chaos, Thermalization, and Non-locality
Authors: Masataka Matsumoto, Shuta Nakajima, Masahiro Nozaki, Ryosuke Yoshii
Abstract: In this paper, we numerically investigate whether quantum thermalization occurs during the time evolution induced by a non-local Hamiltonian whose spectra exhibit integrability. This non-local and integrable Hamiltonian is constructed by combining two types of integrable Hamiltonians. From the time dependence of entanglement entropy and mutual information, we find that non-locality can evolve the system into the typical state. On the other hand, the time dependence of logarithmic negativity shows that the non-locality can destroy the quantum correlation. These findings suggest that the quantum thermalization induced by the non-local Hamiltonian does not require the quantum chaoticity of the system.

Title: One Rudolf Peierls' surprise: the quantum-to-classical transition in the context of solid-state physics
Authors: Navinder Singh
Abstract: In solid state physics, it is an unsaid (tacit) assumption that the Bloch theorem is applicable to a crystal lattice even if it is of the macroscopic dimensions, provided periodicity is maintained. However, in a realistic situation, electrons in a periodic potential of ions constitute an open quantum system and are subjected to decoherence and dissipation. A natural question arises: up to what distances electrons in a periodic potential can be considered as constituting an effective closed quantum system? And what is the cause of decoherence? To answer some of these questions, the seminal theory of Ovchinnikov and Erikhman of decoherence due to ionic motion is revisited and an oversight of the authors is corrected. Correct conditions for decoherence to occur are worked out. Length scale up to which the motion of ions remains coherent is also calculated. Finally, a realistic physical picture is discussed.

Title: Ultrafast Solvent Dynamics Drives the Formation of the Hydrated Electron in Photoexcited Water
Authors: Gonzalo Díaz Mirón, Cesare Malosso, Solana Di Pino, Colin K. Egan, Diganta Disgupta, Christopher J. Mundy, Ali Hassanali
Abstract: The photophysics and photochemistry associated with irradiating UV light in liquid water is central to numerous physical, chemical and biological processes. One of the key events involved in this process is the generation of the hydrated electron. Despite long study from both experimental and theoretical fronts, a unified understanding of the underlying mechanisms associated with the generation of the solvated electron have remained elusive. Here, using excited-state molecular dynamics simulations of condensed phase photoexcited liquid water, we unravel the key sequence of chemical events leading to the creation of the hydrated electron on the excited state. The process begins through the excitation of electrons localized mostly on specific topological defects in water's hydrogen network which is subsequently followed by two main reaction pathways. The first, leads to the creation of a hydrogen atom culminating in non-radiative decay back to the ground-state within 100 femtoseconds. The second involves a proton coupled electron transfer, giving rise to the formation of the hydronium ion, hydroxyl radical and the hydrated excess electron on the excited-state. This process is facilitated by ultrafast coupled rotational and translational motions of water molecules leading to the formation of water mediated ion-radical pairs in the network. These species can survive on the picosecond timescale and ultimately modulate the emission of visible photons. All in all, our findings provide fresh perspectives into the interpretation of several independent time-dependent spectroscopies measured over the last decades, paving the way for new directions on both theoretical and experimental fronts.

Title: Casimir-Lifshitz interaction between bodies integrated in a micro/nanoelectromechanical quantum damped oscillator
Authors: Yu. S. Barash
Abstract: A theory is proposed for the component of the Casimir-like force that arises between bodies embedded in a macroscopic quantum damped oscillator. When the oscillator's parameters depend on the distance between the bodies, the oscillator-induced Casimir-like force is generally determined by a broad spectral range extending to high frequencies, limited by the frequency dispersion of the damping function. Here it is shown that there is a large class of systems in which the low-frequency range dominates the forces. This allows for the use of the Ohmic approximation, which is crucial for extending the theory to the lumped element description of fluctuation-induced forces in electrical circuits. Estimates of the circuit-induced Casimir-Lifshitz force suggest that under certain conditions it can be identified experimentally due to its dependence on various circuit elements.

Title: Multi-mode Deep Strong Coupling in a Multi Quantum Well Fabry-Perot Cavity
Authors: Lucy Hale, Johan Andberger, Ethan Koskas, Mattias Beck, Giacomo Scalari, Jérôme Faist
Abstract: We present a simple experimental platform to achieve deep-strong coupling using a multi-quantum well ($N = 166$) heterostructure. The heterostructure itself acts as a Fabry-Pérot cavity, such that the photonic modes strongly couple to the cyclotron resonance to form Landau polaritons. Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy reveals vacuum Rabi splitting larger than the mode spacing, resulting in a rich multi-mode polaritonic spectra which is accurately reproduced by an "all-to-all" multi-photonic, multi-electronic Hopfield coupling model. In addition, modeling of the electromagnetic field distribution inside the cavity reveals evidence of light-matter decoupling, even in the asymptotic limit of zero frequency. The system demonstrates a robust platform for exploring extreme coupling regimes and its chiral nature holds potential for chiral cavity and chiral mirror applications.

Title: 4D-Printing Assisted Scaffolds to Form Cardiac Bricks
Authors: Hossein Goodarzi Hosseinabadi
Abstract: Myocardial infarction causes myocardium thinning, fibrosis, and progressive heart failure. Engineered human myocardium (EHM) is tested clinically as a first-in-class product for sustainable remuscularization in patients with advanced heart failure. Current EHM production procedure from iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes and stromal cells, is time consuming and involves thin constructs. Here, I introduce 4D-DLP-printed foldable scaffolds with potential to create modular cylindrical cardiac bricks. This enables self-assembly into thicker and aligned sarcomeres with synchronous contractility mimicking a native myocardium. When optimized and integrated with cryopreservation protocols, the biomanufacturing and biobanking of these cellular building blocks may overcome current EHM limitations and advance translational regenerative therapies for myocardial infarction. The structure-material properties investigations into these new class of life building blocks paves the way for future medical breakthroughs.

Title: Partial Anyon Condensation in the Color Code: A Hamiltonian Approach
Authors: Mohsen Rahmani Haghighi, Mohammad Hossein Zarei
Abstract: Lattice Hamiltonians, which can be tuned between different topological phases, are known as important tools for understanding physical mechanism behind topological phase transitions. In this paper, we introduce a perturbed Color Code Hamiltonian with a rich phase structure which can be well matched to the mechanism of anyon condensation in the Color Code. We consider Color Code model defined on a three-colorable hexagonal lattice and add Ising interactions between spins corresponding to edges of the lattice. We show that Ising interactions play the role of physical factor for condensing anyons in the Color Code. In particular, corresponding to three different colors of edges in the hexagonal lattice, we consider three different coupling parameters. Then, we are able to condense anyons with different colors by tuning power of Ising interactions in the corresponding edges. In particular, we explicitly show that condensation of one type of anyons in the Color Code leads to a phase transition to the Toric Code state. On the other hand, by condensing two types of anyons, we observe a phase transition to a modified version of the Toric Code where partial set of anyons in the Toric Code are condensed and we call it a partially topological phase. Our main method for derivation of the above results is based on a suitable basis transformation on the main Hamiltonian in the sense that our model is mapped onto three decoupled transverse-field Ising models, corresponding to the three colors. We use the above mapping to analyze behavior of string order parameters as non-local indicators of topological order. We introduce three string order parameters that can well characterize different phases of the model. Specifically we give a simple description of the partially condensed phase by using string order parameters.

Title: On-chip wave chaos for photonic extreme learning
Authors: Matthew R. Wilson, Jack A. Smith, Michael J. Strain, Xavier Porte
Abstract: The increase in demand for scalable and energy efficient artificial neural networks has put the focus on novel hardware solutions. Integrated photonics offers a compact, parallel and ultra-fast information processing platform, specially suited for extreme learning machine (ELM) architectures. Here we experimentally demonstrate a chip-scale photonic ELM based on wave chaos interference in a stadium microcavity. By encoding the input information in the wavelength of an external single-frequency tunable laser source, we leverage the high sensitivity to wavelength of injection in such photonic resonators. We fabricate the microcavity with direct laser writing of SU-8 polymer on glass. A scattering wall surrounding the stadium operates as readout layer, collecting the light associated with the cavity's leaky modes. We report uncorrelated and aperiodic behavior in the speckles of the scattering barrier from a high resolution scan of the input wavelength. Finally, we characterize the system's performance at classification in four qualitatively different benchmark tasks. As we can control the number of output nodes of our ELM by measuring different parts of the scattering barrier, we demonstrate the capability to optimize our photonic ELM's readout size to the performance required for each task.

Title: A cryogenic chamber setup for superfluid helium experiments with optical fiber and electrical access
Authors: Alexander R. Korsch, Niccolò Fiaschi, Simon Gröblacher
Abstract: Superfluid helium is a prototypical quantum liquid. As such, it has been a prominent platform for the study of quantum many body physics. More recently, the outstanding mechanical and optical properties of superfluid helium, such as low mechanical dissipation and low optical absorption, have positioned superfluid helium as a promising material platform in applications ranging from dark matter and gravitational wave detection to quantum computation. However, experiments with superfluid helium incur a high barrier to entry as they require incorporation of complex optical and electrical setups within a hermetically sealed cryogenic chamber to confine the superfluid. Here, we report on the design and construction of a helium chamber setup for operation inside a dilution refrigerator at Millikelvin temperatures, featuring electrical and optical fiber access. By incorporating an automated gas handling system, we can precisely control the amount of helium gas inserted into the chamber, rendering our setup particularly promising for experiments with superfluid helium thin films, such as superfluid thin film optomechanics. Using silicon nanophotonic resonators, we demonstrate precise control and in-situ tuning of the thickness of a superfluid helium film on the sub-nanometer level. By making use of the exceptional tunability of the superfluid film thickness, we demonstrate optomechanically induced phonon lasing of phononic crystal cavity third sound modes in the superfluid film and show that the lasing threshold crucially depends on the film thickness. The large internal volume of our chamber (V_chamber = 1l) is adaptable for integration of various optical and electrical measurement and control techniques. Therefore, our setup provides a versatile platform for a variety of experiments in fundamental and applied superfluid helium research.

Title: A Field-Theoretical Paradigm via Hierarchical Coarse-Graining: I. Generalized Mode Theory
Authors: Jaehyeok Jin, Yining Han, Gregory A. Voth
Abstract: Multiscale computer simulations facilitate the efficient exploration of large spatiotemporal scales in chemical and physical systems. However, molecular simulations predominantly rely on particle-based representations, which become computationally prohibitive when applied beyond the molecular scale. Field-theoretical simulations have emerged as an alternative to overcome these limitations. Despite their applicability in mesoscopic simulations, these approaches are typically derived from top-down principles, leaving a gap in the bottom-up derivation of field-theoretical models for targeted molecular systems. This work presents a systematic strategy for constructing statistical field models for molecular liquids from the atomistic level, marking a critical step toward bridging particle-based and field-theoretical modeling techniques. By introducing molecular coarse-grained models as an intermediate step, this hierarchical approach reduces the complexity of the atomistic-to-field-theoretical transformation while preserving important microscopic structural correlations. We systematically derive field-theoretical models in reciprocal space for both canonical and grand canonical ensembles using the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation. By incorporating additional fields for both positive and negative Fourier modes, our generalized mode theory extends the applicability of bottom-up field-theoretical models beyond the conventional Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation, which can be limited to positive Fourier modes. Furthermore, we introduce an efficient perturbative approach for approximating Fourier modes of molecular interactions, reducing computational cost and allowing for integrating complex molecular interactions into the field-theoretic description.

Title: Microscopic Origin of Domain Wall Reconfiguration Dynamics in a Quantum Material via Quantum Simulation
Authors: Jaka Vodeb
Abstract: Understanding how quantum materials relax from metastable states poses a fundamental challenge in condensed matter physics. In the layered dichalcogenide 1T-TaS$_2$, domain-wall-rich polaronic textures evolve toward a uniform ground state through reconfiguration events that exhibit a crossover from thermally activated to temperature-independent behavior-indicative of quantum tunneling. Here, we employ quantum simulation of a two-dimensional transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) with longitudinal bias to uncover the microscopic processes underlying this relaxation. Using a Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, we map the TFIM to a hardcore boson model, revealing that single-polaron tunneling events, rather than collective multi-particle transitions, dominate domain wall motion. A scaling analysis of reconfiguration rates across varying transverse fields $h_x$ shows collapse when temperature is rescaled as $T \to h_x^n T$ with $n \approx 1.2$, confirming the dominance of first- and second-order single-particle processes. This enables us to reconstruct a microscopic relaxation pathway consisting of cyclical polaron leakage followed by cascades of tunneling events. Our results establish quantum simulation as a powerful tool for inferring real-space mechanisms in strongly correlated systems and demonstrate a concrete strategy for bridging effective spin models with the non-equilibrium dynamics of quantum materials.

Title: Klein tunneling in deformed honeycomb-dice lattice: from massless to massive particles
Authors: L. Mandhour, F. Bouhadida
Abstract: We show that under compressive uniaxial deformation of the three-band $\alpha-T_3$ lattice, the Dirac cones move toward each other, merge, and a gap opens, while the flat band remains unchanged. Consequently, the low-energy spectrum transitions from linear to quadratic dispersion, indicating the shift from massless to massive Dirac particles. Here, we theoretically investigate the tunneling properties of particles through a sharp $np$ junction in a deformed $\alpha-T_3$ lattice, focusing on the case where the particle energy is half the junction height. We show that this transition from massless to massive particles leads to a change from omnidirectional total transmission, known as super-Klein tunneling, to omnidirectional total reflection, referred to as anti-super-Klein tunneling, in the case of the dice lattice ($\alpha=1$). For all values of $\alpha$, this transition manifests as a change from conventional Klein tunneling to anti-Klein tunneling.

Title: Extrinsic and Intrinsic Nonlinear Hall Effects across Berry-Dipole Transitions
Authors: Zheng-Yang Zhuang, Zhongbo Yan
Abstract: Three-dimensional Hopf insulators are a class of topological phases beyond the tenfold-way classification. The critical point separating two rotation-invariant Hopf insulator phases with distinct Hopf invariants is quite different from the usual Dirac-type or Weyl-type critical points and uniquely characterized by a quantized Berry dipole. Close to such Berry-dipole transitions, we find that the extrinsic and intrinsic nonlinear Hall conductivity tensors in the weakly doped regime are characterized by two universal functions of the ratio between doping level and bulk energy gap, and are directly proportional to the change in Hopf invariant across the transition. Our work suggests that the nonlinear Hall effects display a general-sense quantized behavior across Berry-dipole transitions, establishing a correspondence between nonlinear Hall effects and Hopf invariant.

Title: On-demand analog space-time in superconducting networks: grey holes, dynamical instability and exceptional points
Authors: Mohammad Atif Javed, Daniel Kruti, Ahmed Kenawy, Tobias Herrig, Christina Koliofoti, Oleksiy Kashuba, Roman-Pascal Riwar
Abstract: There has been considerable effort to mimic analog black holes and wormholes in solid state systems. Lattice realizations in particular present specific challenges. One of those is that event horizons in general have both white and black hole (grey hole) character, a feature guaranteed by the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem. We here explore and extend the capability of superconducting circuit hardware to implement on-demand spacetime geometries on lattices, combining nonreciprocity of gyrators with the nonlinearity of Josephson junctions. We demonstrate the possibility of the metric sharply changing within a single lattice point, thus entering a regime where the modulation of system parameters is "trans-Planckian", and the Hawking temperature ill-defined. Instead of regular Hawking radiation, we find an instability in the form of an exponential burst of charge and phase quantum fluctuations over short time scales - a robust signature even in the presence of an environment. Moreover, we present a loop-hole for the typical black/white hole ambiguity in lattice simulations: exceptional points in the dispersion relation allow for the creation of pure black (or white) hole horizons, at the expense of a radical change in the dynamics of the wormhole interior.

Title: Quantum Zeno Effect in Noisy Integrable Quantum Circuits for Impurity Models
Authors: Yicheng Tang, Pradip Kattel, J. H. Pixley, Natan Andrei
Abstract: We theoretically study the open quantum system dynamics (in the Trotterized limit) of integrable quantum circuits in the presence of onsite dephasing noise with a spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ impurity interacting at the edge. Using a combination of Bethe Ansatz (BA) and exact diagonalization (ED), we study the dynamics of both the bulk and the impurity for the XXX (Heisenberg) and the XX qubit chains in the presence and absence of bulk noise. In the absence of noise, we show that the impurity exhibits two distinct phases, the bound mode phase where the impurity keeps oscillating in time, and the Kondo phase where it decays with Kondo time $t_K$. Turning on the bulk dephasing noise, we find for the two models that in the long time limit in both regimes the quantum Zeno effect takes place where the dynamics of the impurity magnetization slows down as the noise strength $\gamma$ increases. The impurity magnetization in the bound mode regime shows the opposite effect, decaying faster as the noise strength increases for short times ($t \ll 1/\gamma$). We show that the bulk KPZ dynamics of the XXX model is converted to diffusive dynamics as in the XX case studied before by V. Alba, driving both systems to the Zeno effect for the impurity in the long time limit.

Title: Revealing the anisotropic charge-density-wave order of TiSe$_2$ through high harmonic generation
Authors: Lin Zhang, Igor Tyulnev, Lenard Vamos, Julita Poborska, Utso Bhattacharya, Ravindra W. Chhajlany, Tobias Grass, Jens Biegert, Maciej Lewenstein
Abstract: Titanium diselenide (TiSe$_{2}$) is a transition-metal dichalcogenide material that undergoes a charge-density-wave (CDW) transition at $T_{c}\approx 200\,\mathrm{K}$. In a recent experiment [I. Tyulnev {\it et al.}, Commun. Mater. 6, 152 (2025)], the high harmonic generation (HHG) spectra of this material has been studied, which exhibits asymmetric behavior with respect to the polarization angle of the incident light and provides a new perspective to the CDW phase transition. In this work, we work out a theoretical explanation for the experimentally observed behavior of HHG spectra. We propose a simplified phenomenological mean-field model for this material, based on which the HHG spectra is calculated through the time-dependent Schr{\" o}dinger equation. This model correctly describes the measured intensity distribution of the third-, fifth-, and seventh-order harmonic generation as a function of polarization direction and reveals a strong asymmetry due to the anisotropic CDW order in the low temperature phase. Our work provides a basis for applying high harmonic spectroscopy to reveal a new perspective on the nature of CDW orders.

Title: Thermal circuit model for silicon quantum-dot array structures
Authors: Takeru Utsugi, Nobuhiro Kusuno, Takuma Kuno, Noriyuki Lee, Itaru Yanagi, Toshiyuki Mine, Shinichi Saito, Digh Hisamoto, Ryuta Tsuchiya, Hiroyuki Mizuno
Abstract: Temperature rise of qubits due to heating is a critical issue in large-scale quantum computers based on quantum-dot (QD) arrays. This leads to shorter coherence times, induced readout errors, and increased charge noise. Here, we propose a simple thermal circuit model to describe the heating effect on silicon QD array structures. Noting that the QD array is a periodic structure, we represent it as a thermal distributed-element circuit, forming a thermal transmission line. We validate this model by measuring the electron temperature in a QD array device using Coulomb blockade thermometry, finding that the model effectively reproduces experimental results. This simple and scalable model can be used to develop the thermal design of large-scale silicon-based quantum computers.

Title: Resonant Edelstein and inverse-Edelstein effects, charge-to-spin conversion, and spin pumping from chiral-spin modes
Authors: Mojdeh Saleh, Abhishek Kumar, Dmitrii L. Maslov, Saurabh Maiti
Abstract: Spin-orbit coupling in systems with broken inversion symmetry gives rise to the Edelstein effect, which is the spin polarization induced by an electric field or current, and the inverse-Edelstein effect (also known as the spin-galvanic effect), which is the electric current induced by an oscillatory magnetic field or spin polarization. At the same time, an interplay between spin-orbit coupling and electron-electron interaction leads to a special type of collective excitations -- chiral-spin modes -- which are oscillations of spin polarization in the absence of a magnetic field. As a result, both Edelstein and inverse-Edelstein effects exhibit resonances at the frequencies of chiral-spin collective modes. Here, we present a detailed study of the effect of electron correlation on the resonances in Edelstein and inverse-Edelstein effects in a single-valley two-dimensional electron gas and in a multi-valley Dirac system with proximity-induced spin-orbit coupling. While the chiral-spin modes involve both in-plane and out-of-plane oscillations of spins, we show that only the in-plane modes are responsible for the above resonances. In the multi-valley system, electron correlation splits the in-plane modes into two. We study the spectral weight distribution between the two modes over a large parameter space of intra- and inter-valley interactions. Finally, we demonstrate that using the chiral-spin modes one can get a resonant enhancement of charge-to-spin conversion and gain a directional control of the injected spins in the spin-pumping process, both of which are relevant to spintronics.

Title: Twisted gauging and topological sectors in (2+1)d abelian lattice gauge theories
Authors: Bram Vancraeynest-De Cuiper, Clement Delcamp
Abstract: Given a two-dimensional quantum lattice model with an abelian gauge theory interpretation, we investigate a duality operation that amounts to gauging its invertible 1-form symmetry, followed by gauging the resulting 0-form symmetry in a twisted way via a choice of discrete torsion. Using tensor networks, we introduce explicit lattice realisations of the so-called condensation defects, which are obtained by gauging the 1-form symmetry along submanifolds of spacetime, and employ the same calculus to realise the duality operators. By leveraging these tensor network operators, we compute the non-trivial interplay between symmetry-twisted boundary conditions and charge sectors under the duality operation, enabling us to construct isometries relating the dual Hamiltonians. Whenever a lattice gauge theory is left invariant under the duality operation, we explore the possibility of promoting the self-duality to an internal symmetry. We argue that this results in a symmetry structure that encodes the 2-representations of a 2-group.

Title: Pressure suppresses the density wave order in kagome metal LuNb$_6$Sn$_6$
Authors: William R. Meier, David E. Graf, Brenden R. Ortiz, Shirin Mozaffari, David Mandrus
Abstract: Dancing tins pair up, But compressing the framework Thwarts the displacements. The density waves that develop in kagome metals ScV$_{6}$Sn$_{6}$ and LuNb$_{6}$Sn$_{6}$ at low temperature appear to arise from under-filled atomic columns within a V-Sn or Nb-Sn scaffolding. Compressing this network with applied pressure in ScV$_{6}$Sn$_{6}$ suppressed the structural transition temperature by constraining atomic rattling and inhibiting the shifts that define the structural modulation. We predicted that the density wave transition in LuNb$_{6}$Sn$_{6}$ at 68 K would be suppressed by pressure as well. In this brief study, we examine the pressure dependence of the density wave transition by measuring resistance vs temperature up to 2.26 GPa. We found the transition temperature is smoothly depressed and disappears around 1.9 GPa. This result not only addresses our prediction, but strengthens the rattling chains origin of structural instabilities in the HfFe$_{6}$Ge$_{6}$-type kagome metals.

Title: Cartesian Nodal Lines and Magnetic Kramers Weyl Nodes in Spin-Split Antiferromagnets
Authors: Zheng-Yang Zhuang, Di Zhu, Zhigang Wu, Zhongbo Yan
Abstract: When band degeneracy occurs in a spin-split band structure, it gives rise to divergent Berry curvature and distinctive topological boundary states, resulting in a variety of fascinating effects. We show that three-dimensional spin-split antiferromagnets, characterized by symmetry-constrained momentum-dependent spin splitting and zero net magnetization, can host two unique forms of symmetry-protected band degeneracy: Cartesian nodal lines in the absence of spin-orbit coupling, and magnetic Kramers Weyl nodes when spin-orbit coupling is present. Remarkably, these band degeneracies not only produce unique patterns of Berry-curvature distributions but also give rise to topological boundary states with unconventional spin textures. Furthermore, we find that these band degeneracies can lead to strong or even quantized anomalous Hall effects and quantized circular photogalvanic effects under appropriate conditions. Our study suggests that spin-split antiferromagnets provide a fertile ground for exploring unconventional topological phases.

Title: Viscoelastic tensor and hydrodynamics of altermagnets
Authors: A. A. Herasymchuk, E. V. Gorbar, P. O. Sukhachov
Abstract: We calculate the viscoelasticity tensor for altermagnets and formulate the corresponding hydrodynamic equations. The anisotropy of altermagnetic Fermi surfaces allows for additional terms in the viscoelasticity tensor and is manifested in transport properties, including electron and spin flows in a channel and nonlocal responses. In the channel geometry, the altermagnetic spin splitting leads to nontrivial spin density and spin current. Like the electric current, the spin current acquires a Poiseuille profile for no-slip boundary conditions. In nonlocal responses, the altermagnetic anisotropy affects current streamlines and electric potential distributions in the viscous regime. Our results provide signatures of the hydrodynamic transport regime in altermagnets, potentially facilitating its experimental studies and discovery.

Title: Influence of excitation energy on microscopic quantum pathways for ultrafast charge transfer in van der Waals heterostructures
Authors: Niklas Hofmann, Johannes Gradl, Leonard Weigl, Stiven Forti, Camilla Coletti, Isabella Gierz
Abstract: Efficient charge separation in van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures is crucial for optimizing light-harvesting and detection applications. However, precise control over the microscopic pathways governing ultrafast charge transfer remains an open challenge. These pathways are intrinsically linked to charge transfer states with strongly delocalized wave functions that appear at various momenta in the Brillouin zone. Here, we use time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (trARPES) to investigate the possibility of steering carriers through specific charge transfer states in a prototypical WS2-graphene heterostructure. By selectively exciting electron-hole pairs at the K-point and close to the Q-point of WS2 with different pump photon energies, we find that charge separation is faster at higher excitation energies. We attribute this to distinct tunneling mechanisms dictated by the momentum where the initial excitation takes place. Our findings reveal that the microscopic pathways for ultrafast charge transfer in vdW heterostructures are highly sensitive to the excitation energy, an aspect that should be carefully considered when optimizing the performance of optoelectronic devices.

Title: Radiation damage and phase stability of Al$_x$CrCuFeNi$_y$ alloys using a machine-learned interatomic potential
Authors: Aslak Fellman, Jesper Byggmästar, Fredric Granberg, Flyura Djurabekova, Kai Nordlund
Abstract: We develop a machine-learned interatomic potential for AlCrCuFeNi high-entropy alloys (HEA) using a diverse set of structures from density functional theory calculated including magnetic effects. The potential is based on the computationally efficient tabulated version of the Gaussian approximation potential method (tabGAP) and is a general-purpose model for molecular dynamics simulation of the HEA system, with additional emphasis on radiation damage effects. We use the potential to study key properties of AlCrCuFeNi HEAs at different compositions, focusing on the FCC/BCC phase stability. Monte Carlo swapping simulations are performed to understand the stability and segregation of the HEA and reveal clear FeCr and Cu segregation. Close to equiatomic composition, a transition from FCC to BCC is detected, following the valence electron concentration stability rule. Furthermore, we perform overlapping cascade simulations to investigate radiation damage production and tolerance. Different alloy compositions show significant differences in defect concentrations, and all alloy compositions show enrichment of some elements in or around defects. We find that, generally, a lower Al content corresponds to lower defect concentrations during irradiation. Furthermore, clear short-range ordering is observed as a consequence of continued irradiation.

Title: A Matrix Quantum Kinetic Treatment of Impact Ionization in Avalanche Photodiodes
Authors: Sheikh Z. Ahmed, Shafat Shahnewaz, Samiran Ganguly, Joe C Campbell, Avik W. Ghosh
Abstract: Matrix based quantum kinetic simulations have been widely used for the predictive modeling of electronic devices. Inelastic scattering from phonons and electrons are typically treated as higher order processes in these treatments, captured using mean-field approximations. Carrier multiplication in Avalanche Photodiodes (APDs), however, relies entirely on strongly inelastic impact ionization, making electron-electron scattering the dominant term requiring a rigorous, microscopic treatment. We go well beyond the conventional Born approximation for scattering to develop a matrix-based quantum kinetic theory for impact ionization, involving products of multiple Green's functions. Using a model semiconductor in a reverse-biased p-i-n configuration, we show how its calculated non-equilibrium charge distributions show multiplication at dead-space values consistent with energy-momentum conservation. Our matrix approach can be readily generalized to more sophisticated atomistic Hamiltonians, setting the stage for a fully predictive, `first principles' theory of APDs.

Title: Entropic modulation of divalent cation transport
Authors: Yechan Noh, Demian Riccardi, Alex Smolyanitsky
Abstract: Aqueous cations permeate subnanoscale pores by crossing free energy barriers dominated by competing enthalpic contributions from transiently decreased ion-solvent and increased ion-pore electrostatic interactions. This commonly accepted view is rooted in the studies of monovalent cation transport. Divalent cations, however, have significantly higher desolvation costs, requiring considerably larger pores to enable retention of the first hydration shell and subsequently transport. We show that this scenario gives rise to a strong enthalpy-entropy competition. Specifically, the first hydration shell is shown to undergo rotational ordering inside the pore, resulting in a tight transition state. Our results shed light on the basic mechanisms of transport barrier formation for aqueous divalent cations permeating nanoporous 2D membranes.

Title: Advances in Quantum Defect Embedding Theory
Authors: Siyuan Chen, Victor Wen-zhe Yu, Yu Jin, Marco Govoni, Giulia Galli
Abstract: Quantum defect embedding theory (QDET) is a many-body embedding method designed to describe condensed systems with correlated electrons localized within a given region of space, for example spin defects in semiconductors and insulators. Although the QDET approach has been successful in predicting the electronic properties of several point defects, several limitations of the method remain. In this work, we propose multiple advances to the QDET formalism. We derive a double-counting correction that consistently treats the frequency dependence of the screened Coulomb interaction, and we illustrate the effect of including unoccupied orbitals in the active space. In addition, we propose a method to describe hybridization effects between the active space and the environment, and we compare the results of several impurity solvers, providing further insights into improving the reliability and applicability of the method. We present results for defects in diamond and for molecular qubits, including a detailed comparison with experiments.

Title: Multi-band fractional Thouless pumps
Authors: Marius Jürgensen, Jacob Steiner, Gil Refael, Mikael C. Rechtsman
Abstract: Quantization of particle transport lies at the heart of topological physics. In Thouless pumps - dimensionally reduced versions of the integer quantum Hall effect - quantization is dictated by the integer winding of single-band Wannier states. Here, we show that repulsive interactions can drive a transition from an integer- to a fractional-quantized Thouless pump (at fixed integer filling) by stabilizing a crystal of multi-band Wannier states, each with fractional winding. We numerically illustrate the concept in few-particle systems, and show that a dynamical Hartree-Fock ansatz can quantitatively reproduce the pumping phase diagram.

Title: Relaxation dynamics and the free energy near the phase boundary of the 3D kinetic Ising model
Authors: Ranran Guo, Xiaobing Li, Yuming Zhong, Mingmei Xu, Jinghua Fu, Yuanfang Wu
Abstract: We investigate relaxation dynamics along the entire first-order phase transition line by analyzing the time evolution of the free energy landscape in the three-dimensional kinetic Ising model. Near the critical temperature $T_{\rm c}$, the free energy structure is consistent with predictions from Landau-Ginzburg theory. At temperatures far below $T_{\rm c}$, however, fine structures in pre-equilibrium configurations trap random initial states, causing a pronounced delay in equilibration - an effect we identify as ultra-slow relaxation. This phenomenon is characterized by a self-divergence of the relative variance of equilibration times, which we propose as a previously unrecognized hallmark of first-order phase transitions.

Title: Photoinduced dc Hall current in few-layer black phosphorus with a gate-tunable Floquet gap
Authors: Taehun Kim, Hansol Kim, Dongeun Kim, Hongki Min
Abstract: We theoretically explore Floquet engineering in few-layer black phosphorus (fBP) under time-periodic driving. Motivated by the ability of circularly polarized light to induce nontrivial topological states at Dirac nodes, we investigate the emergence of a photoinduced dc Hall effect in the Dirac semimetal phase of fBP. Starting from a low-energy continuum model, we derive the effective Floquet Hamiltonian and analytically calculate the Berry curvature, demonstrating the opening of a topological gap. We also perform lattice-model calculations incorporating a self-consistent Hartree method to compute Floquet band structures and dc Hall conductivity under a perpendicular electric field. Our results reveal that the dc Hall current in fBP can be effectively tuned via a periodic driving field and electrostatic gating.

Title: Creation and Microscopic Origins of Single-Photon Emitters in Transition Metal Dichalcogenides and Hexagonal Boron Nitride
Authors: Amedeo Carbone, Diane-Pernille Bendixen-Fernex de Mongex, Arkady V. Krasheninnikov, Martijn Wubs, Alexander Huck, Thomas W. Hansen, Alexander W. Holleitner, Nicolas Stenger, Christoph Kastl
Abstract: We highlight recent advances in the controlled creation of single-photon emitters in van der Waals materials and in the understanding of their atomistic origin. We focus on quantum emitters created in monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenide semiconductors, which provide spectrally sharp single-photon emission at cryogenic temperatures, and the ones in insulating hBN, which provide bright and stable single-photon emission up to room temperature. After introducing the different classes of quantum emitters in terms of band-structure properties, we review the defect creation methods based on electron and ion irradiation as well as local strain engineering and plasma treatments. A main focus of the review is put on discussing the microscopic origin of the quantum emitters as revealed by various experimental platforms, including optical and scanning probe methods.

Title: Hamiltonian Learning of Triplon Excitations in an Artificial Nanoscale Molecular Quantum Magnet
Authors: Rouven Koch, Robert Drost, Peter Liljeroth, Jose L. Lado
Abstract: Extracting the Hamiltonian parameters of nanoscale quantum magnets from experimental measurements is a significant challenge in quantum matter. Here we establish a machine learning strategy to extract the parameters of a spin Hamiltonian from inelastic spectroscopy with scanning tunneling microscopy, and we demonstrate this methodology experimentally with an artificial nanoscale molecular magnet based on cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPC) molecules on NbSe$_2$. We show that this technique allows us to extract the Hamiltonian parameters of a quantum magnet from the differential conductance, including the substrate-induced spatial variation of the exchange couplings. Our methodology leverages a machine learning algorithm trained on exact quantum many-body simulations with tensor networks of finite quantum magnets, leading to a methodology that predicts the Hamiltonian parameters of CoPC quantum magnets of arbitrary size. Our results demonstrate how quantum many-body methods and machine learning enable us to learn a microscopic description of nanoscale quantum many-body systems with scanning tunneling spectroscopy.

Title: Inferring activity from the flow field around active colloidal particles using deep learning
Authors: Aditya Mohapatra, Aditya Kumar, Mayurakshi Deb, Siddharth Dhomkar, Rajesh Singh
Abstract: Active colloidal particles create flow around them due to non-equilibrium process on their surfaces. In this paper, we infer the activity of such colloidal particles from the flow field created by them via deep learning. We first explain our method for one active particle, inferring the $2s$ mode (or the stresslet) and the $3t$ mode (or the source dipole) from the flow field data, along with the position and orientation of the particle. We then apply the method to a system of many active particles. We find excellent agreements between the predictions and the true values of activity. Our method presents a principled way to predict arbitrary activity from the flow field created by active particles.

Title: Colloidal nanoparticles in cholesteric liquid crystals: Bulk properties, biaxiality and untwisting
Authors: Prabakaran Rajamanickam, Fatimah Almutari, Apala Majumdar
Abstract: We study the effects of colloidal nanoparticles (NPs) in cholesteric liquid crystal samples in the dilute limit, in a Landau-de Gennes theoretical framework. The effects of the suspended NPs are captured by a homogenized energy, as outlined in [7]. For spatially homogeneous samples, we explicitly compute the critical points and minimizers of the modified Landau-de Gennes energy and show that the presence of NP eliminates the first-order isotropic-nematic phase transition, stabilises elusive biaxial phases over some temperature ranges, and that the symmetry of the NP boundary conditions or surface treatments dictates the bulk equilibrium phase at high temperatures. We also numerically demonstrate structural transitions from twisted helical director profiles to untwisted director profiles, in cholesteric-filled channel geometries, driven by the collective effects of the NPs and increasing temperature. These transitions are reversible upon lowering the temperature in sufficiently large domains, where thermal hysteresis can also be observed. This behaviour opens interesting avenues for tuning the optical properties of confined, nano-doped cholesteric systems.

Title: Coarsening Kinetics in Active Model B+: Macroscale and Microscale Phase Separation
Authors: Pradeep Kumar Yadav, Shradha Mishra, Sanjay Puri
Abstract: We perform a comprehensive numerical investigation of the coarsening kinetics of active Brownian particles modeled by the {\it Active Model B+} (AMB+). This model was introduced by Tjhung et al. [Phys. Rev. X {\bf 8}, 031080 (2018)] and is a generalization of Model B for a conserved order parameter, with two additional activity terms. These terms correspond to rotation-free current (of strength $\lambda$) and rotational current (of strength $\xi$). We find that the presence of rotational current $(\xi \neq 0)$ significantly affects growth kinetics. Depending on the parameter values, AMB+ exhibits either {\it macroscale phase separation} (MPS) or {\it microscale phase separation} ($\mu$PS). We present detailed results for the kinetics of MPS and $\mu$PS in AMB+ with critical composition.

Title: Protein Drift-Diffusion in Membranes with Non-equilibrium Fluctuations arising from Gradients in Concentration or Temperature
Authors: D. Jasuja, P. J. Atzberger
Abstract: We investigate proteins within heterogeneous cell membranes where non-equilibrium phenomena arises from spatial variations in concentration and temperature. We develop simulation methods building on non-equilibrium statistical mechanics to obtain stochastic hybrid continuum-discrete descriptions which track individual protein dynamics, spatially varying concentration fluctuations, and thermal exchanges. We investigate biological mechanisms for protein positioning and patterning within membranes and factors in thermal gradient sensing. We also study the kinetics of Brownian motion of particles with temperature variations within energy landscapes arising from heterogeneous microstructures within membranes. The introduced approaches provide self-consistent models for studying biophysical mechanisms involving the drift-diffusion dynamics of individual proteins and energy exchanges and fluctuations between the thermal and mechanical parts of the system. The methods also can be used for studying related non-equilibrium effects in other biological systems and soft materials.

Title: Quantum theory of nonlinear electromagnetic response
Authors: Anwei Zhang, C. M. Wang
Abstract: In recent years, the investigation of nonlinear electromagnetic responses has received significant attention due to its potential for elucidating the quantum properties of matter. Although remarkable progress has been achieved in developing quantum theories of nonlinear responses to electric field, a comprehensive quantum theory framework that systematically addresses nonlinear responses to both electric and magnetic fields has yet to be thoroughly discussed. Here, we present a systematic quantum theory of nonlinear electromagnetic response using the Matsubara Green's function approach, which explicitly incorporates the wave vector dependence of external electromagnetic fields. We provide diagrammatic representation and reveal the general properties of transport coefficients. We apply our theory to second-order responses, deriving the nonlinear Hall effects and magneto-nonlinear Hall effects in both time-reversal symmetric and time-reversal breaking systems. These effects stem from diverse quantum geometric quantities. Additionally, we analyze the contributions arising from the Zeeman interaction. Our work presents a unified quantum theory of nonlinear electromagnetic response, paving the way for further exploration of novel phenomena in this field.

Title: Atomically clean free-standing two-dimensional materials through heating in ultra-high vacuum
Authors: Philipp Irschik, David Lamprecht, Shrirang Chokappa, Clemens Mangler, Carsten Speckmann, Thuy An Bui, Manuel Längle, Lado Filipovic, Jani Kotakoski
Abstract: Surface contamination not only influences but in some cases even dominates the measured properties of two-dimensional materials. Although different cleaning methods are often used for contamination removal, commonly used spectroscopic cleanliness assessment methods can leave the level of achieved cleanliness ambiguous. Despite two decades of research on 2D materials, the true cleanliness of the used samples is often left open to interpretation. In this work, freestanding monolayer graphene and hexagonal boron nitride are annealed at different temperatures in a custom-built ultra-high vacuum heating chamber, connected to a scanning transmission electron microscope via a vacuum transfer line, enabling atomically resolved cleanliness characterization as a function of annealing temperature, while eliminating the introduction of airborne contamination during sample transport. While annealing at 200 °C already reduces contamination significantly, it is not until 400 °C or higher, where over 90% of the free-standing monolayer areas are atomically clean. At this point, further contamination removal is mainly limited by defects in the material and metal contamination introduced during the sample transfer or growth. The achieved large, atomically clean areas can then be used for further nanoscale engineering steps or device processing, facilitating interaction with the material rather than contamination.

Title: Light-Wave Engineering for Selective Polarization of a Single $\mathbf{Q}$ Valley in Transition Metal Dichalcogenides
Authors: Youngjae Kim
Abstract: The selective control of specific momentum valleys lies at the core of valleytronics, a field that has thus far focused primarily on the $\mathbf{K}$ and $\mathbf{K'}$ valleys in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). However, direct optical access to other low-lying yet conventionally inaccessible valleys such as the sixfold degenerate $\mathbf{Q}$ valleys has remained an outstanding challenge, fundamentally limiting the exploitation of the full valley degree of freedom for information processing. Here, we theoretically introduce an emergent light-wave valley selection rule that enables deterministic and high fidelity excitation of any single $\mathbf{Q}$ valley in monolayer TMDs. By coherently combining a circularly polarized pump pulse with a linearly polarized driver pulse, we engineer distinct quantum pathways that unambiguously excited electrons into a targeted $\mathbf{Q}$ valley, completely decoupled from the conventional $\mathbf{K}/\mathbf{K'}$ valleys. This all-optical scheme achieves near-unity ($\sim$100\%) valley polarization across an exceptionally broad ultrafast window, from the terahertz ($10^{12}$~Hz) to petahertz ($10^{15}$~Hz) regimes, enabling single $\mathbf{Q}$ valley polarization on femtosecond timescales. Our findings establish a new paradigm of light-wave quantum metrology in valleytronics, unlocking the $\mathbf{Q}$-valley subspace for scalable multi-state valley information processing.

Title: Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction Enhanced by Synergetic Interactions among Photon Phonon and Molecule
Authors: Chen Sun, Yimin Xuan
Abstract: Photocatalytic CO2 reduction is limited by inefficient CO2 activation and poor solar spectrum utilization. Here, we discovered and revealed the vibration coupling mechanism among photons, phonons, and molecules, which remarkably enhances photocatalytic catalysis of CO2 into fuels. We designed the nitrogen-doped Cu2O-based catalyst loaded onto the quartz optical substrate. The N-doping Cu2O converts linearly geometry of adsorbed CO2 molecules, which efficiently lowers the activation barrier and facilitates CO2 dissociation. Once the Cu-based catalyst is combined with a micro-pillar quartz film, the system induces vibrational strong coupling (VSC) between the asymmetric CO2 stretching mode and surface phonon polariton resonances. These resonances arise from the photothermal conversion of incident solar photons on the micro-pillars. The resonant coupling phenomena were further verified by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy using Synchrotron Radiation Source (SRS), which directly confirmed the interactions between molecular vibrations and photonic-phononic modes. The synergetic functions originated from this hybrid architecture achieve a CO yield of 167.7 umol h-1 g-1 under pure water conditions, which is the highest reported yield for Cu2O-based photocatalysts with 46% enhancement over non-VSC systems. This work uncovers a novel photo-thermal mechanism. It further provides a new strategy to control bond activation in photocatalytic CO2 conversion through light-vibration-matter coupling.

Title: Symmetry-induced magnetism in fullerene monolayers
Authors: Jiaqi Wu, Leonard Werner Pingen, Timothy K. Dickens, Bo Peng
Abstract: Using molecular orbital theory, we introduce magnetism in pure-carbon, charge-neutral fullerene monolayers which are otherwise non-magnetic. By controlling either molecular or lattice symmetry, we can realise highly-tuneable magnetic fullerene monolayers. We demonstrate a general design principle based on group theory analysis and explain the origin of magnetism using two representative systems with $S_4$ and $C_3$ molecular symmetries. Moreover, for building blocks that lack appropriate molecular symmetry, we can enforce crystalline symmetry to induce magnetism as well. Finally, we discuss the experimental feasibility of realising our proposed magnetic fullerene monolayers by examining a previously synthesised C$_{60}$ system. Our work opens a new direction in introducing magnetism in non-magnetic building blocks by enforcing either molecular or lattice symmetry.

Title: Odd-Parity Altermagnetism Originated from Orbital Orders
Authors: Zheng-Yang Zhuang, Di Zhu, Dongling Liu, Zhigang Wu, Zhongbo Yan
Abstract: Odd-parity spin-splitting plays a central role in spintronics and unconventional superconductivity, yet its microscopic realization in collinear magnetic systems remains elusive. We propose a general symmetry-based strategy for realizing odd-parity altermagnetism by stacking two noncentrosymmetric monolayers in an interlayer antiferromagnetic configuration and applying an in-plane layer-flip operation. In this setting, odd-parity spin-splitting originates from nonrelativistic orbital orders rather than spin-orbit coupling, and is protected by an effective time-reversal symmetry despite the explicit time-reversal symmetry being broken. By exploiting lattice symmetries, our framework enables the realization of both $p$- and $f$-wave altermagnets. The resulting models generically host quantum spin Hall insulator phases, featuring topologically protected helical edge states and quantized spin Hall conductance. Our work expands the landscape of altermagnetic phases and opens a pathway toward spintronics and unconventional superconductivity in altermagnetic systems.

Title: Striking Similarities in Dynamics and Vibrations of 2D Quasicrystals and Supercooled Liquids
Authors: Edwin A. Bedolla-Montiel, Marjolein Dijkstra
Abstract: We investigate the interplay between structure and dynamics in two structurally distinct two-dimensional systems: a dodecagonal quasicrystal (DDQC) and a supercooled binary liquid. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we uncover striking dynamical similarities despite their fundamentally different structural organizations. Both systems exhibit pronounced dynamic heterogeneities, as evidenced by the cage-trapping plateaus in the mean-squared displacement and the pronounced peaks in the non-Gaussian parameter. In both cases, we observe a strong correlation between local structural order and dynamic propensity, indicating similar structure-dynamics relationships, albeit driven by distinct microscopic mechanisms. Despite these parallels, their vibrational properties diverge: the DDQC exhibits multiple peaks linked to phason dynamics, while the supercooled liquid displays a characteristic boson peak. Analysis of vibrational eigenmodes shows that both systems exhibit extended modes at low frequencies. At high frequencies, however, the DDQC maintains a higher density of topological defects, reflecting its quasi-long-range order. Finally, we contextualize these findings by comparing both systems to a square crystal. While the dynamics appears similar across all three systems, the vibrational and topological features clearly distinguish the DDQC and glass from the crystalline state. These results underscore a surprising universality in dynamical behavior across structurally diverse systems and provide new insights into how structural organization shapes motion in soft-matter systems.

Title: Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations and planar Hall effect in HfTe2
Authors: Qixuan Li, Gangjian Jin, Nannan Tang, Bin Wang, Bing Shen, Donghui Guo, Dingyong Zhong, Huakun Zuo, Huichao Wang
Abstract: Layered transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMD) HfTe2 is a topological semimetal candidate with increasing attentions recently. The map of the Fermi surface is of interest and importance to understand its properties. Here we present a study of Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations and planar Hall effect (PHE) in HfTe2. The single crystals grown by flux method show the largest unsaturated magnetoresistance (MR) effect of 1.1*104 % at 14 T and 2 K. The angle-resolved SdH oscillations reveal that the Fermi surface consists of three pockets with different anisotropy. In addition, we observe PHE and anisotropic MR (AMR) effect in the material for a wide temperature range. The effective mass, carrier density and quantum transport mobility are quantified in the system, and the Berry phase is discussed. Our work provides crucial insights into the electronic structure and the Fermi surface of the semimetal.

Title: On the role played by electrons in the stress-strain curves of ideal crystalline solids
Authors: Margherita Marsili, Elisa Damiani, Davide Dalle Ave, Gabriele Losi, M. Clelia Righi
Abstract: The mechanical properties of a solid, which relate its deformation to external applied forces, are key factors in enabling or disabling the use of an otherwise optimal material in any application, strongly influencing also its service lifetime. Intrinsic crystal deformation mechanisms, investigated experimentally on single crystals with low dislocation densities, have been studied theoretically through atomistic simulations, mainly focusing on lattice-induced instabilities. Here, instead, we employ density functional theory and a thermodynamic analysis to probe and analyze the way in which the electronic charge of crystalline solids (Cu, Al and diamond) responds to uniaxial strain and affects their mechanical properties. Indeed, despite the very simple nature of our models, and in the presence of minimal atomic displacements, we find that the stress strain curves of Cu and Al deviate from a simple linear elastic behavior. Within a thermodynamics perspective, the features of such curves can be interpreted in terms of first and second order phase transitions, which originate from Van-Hove singularities of the electronic density of states crossing the Fermi level and electron redistribution within the solid, respectively.

Title: Generalized Charges, Part II: Non-Invertible Symmetries and the Symmetry TFT
Authors: Lakshya Bhardwaj, Sakura Schafer-Nameki
Abstract: Consider a d-dimensional quantum field theory (QFT) $\mathfrak{T}$, with a generalized symmetry $\mathcal{S}$, which may or may not be invertible. We study the action of $\mathcal{S}$ on generalized or $q$-charges, i.e. $q$-dimensional operators. The main result of this paper is that $q$-charges are characterized in terms of the topological defects of the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) of $\mathcal{S}$, also known as the ``Sandwich Construction''. The SymTFT is a $(d+1)$-dimensional topological field theory, which encodes the symmetry $\mathcal{S}$ and the physical theory in terms of its boundary conditions. Our proposal applies quite generally to any finite symmetry $\mathcal{S}$, including non-invertible, categorical symmetries. Mathematically, the topological defects of the SymTFT form the Drinfeld Center of the symmetry category $\mathcal{S}$. Applied to invertible symmetries, we recover the result of Part I of this series of papers. After providing general arguments for the identification of $q$-charges with the topological defects of the SymTFT, we develop this program in detail for QFTs in 2d (for general fusion category symmetries) and 3d (for fusion 2-category symmetries).

Title: Strong coupling non-Markovian quantum thermodynamics of a finite-bath system
Authors: Devvrat Tiwari, Baibhab Bose, Subhashish Banerjee
Abstract: The focus is on understanding the quantum thermodynamics of strongly coupled non-Markovian quantum systems. To this end, a non-trivial, non-Markovian model of a central spin surrounded by a spin bath is taken up, and its exact evolution is derived for arbitrary system-bath couplings. The fundamental quantum thermodynamic quantities, such as system and bath internal energies, work, heat, entropy production, and ergotropy, are calculated using the dynamics and original system (bath) Hamiltonian. An explicit expression for the work, a mismatch between the system and bath internal energies, is derived. The thermodynamic entropy of the system at thermal equilibrium is studied using the Hamiltonian of mean force in the strong coupling regime. The role of a canonical Hamiltonian in calculating the above thermodynamic quantities, a recently developed technique, is also investigated. Further, an interesting observation relevant to the spin bath acting as a charger is made in a scenario where the central spin is envisaged as a quantum battery.

Title: Effects of background rotation and anisotropy in the holographic description of type-II superconductors
Authors: Jhony A. Herrera-Mendoza, Alfredo Herrera-Aguilar, Daniel F. Higuita-Borja, Julio A. Méndez-Zavaleta, Felipe Pérez-Rodríguez, Jia-Xin Yin
Abstract: The present work concerns the detailed construction of a holographic model for a type-II s-wave superconductor defined on a 5-dimensional anisotropic rotating black hole. We examine the role of rotation and anisotropy on the properties of the superconductor model focusing on the condensate and the AC conductivity, for which we obtain closed formulas, using both analytical and numerical methods. The results reveal that the rotation is responsible for the appearance of a peak and for introducing an exponentially vanishing behavior in the high-frequency limit of the real component of the AC conductivity. Such a behavior aligns with that observed in high-temperature superconductor models and experiments, where the peak and vanishing behavior result from quasiparticle damping, suggesting a relation between the {\it rotation of a black hole} and {\it quasiparticle damping effects} due to impurities or defects in a superconducting material. This relation supplements the holographic dictionary of the gravity/Condensed Matter Theory correspondence. In addition, we provide a detailed construction of the vortex lattice presented in arXiv:2208.05988 and study its behavior as a function of an external uniform magnetic field. Once again, it is shown that the vortex lattice can be continuously deformed along with a change in the vortex population by virtue of the magnetic field, providing a promising avenue for holographically modeling the vortex lattice deformations observed in experimental studies with superconducting materials. As a concrete example, we describe both the vortex lattice deformation and the increment of the vortex population under the action of an external magnetic field in the LiFeAs type-II superconductor. These effects supplement those previously found for the FeSe type-II superconductor studied in arXiv:2208.05988.

Title: Design nearly optimal quantum algorithm for linear differential equations via Lindbladians
Authors: Zhong-Xia Shang, Naixu Guo, Dong An, Qi Zhao
Abstract: Solving linear ordinary differential equations (ODE) is one of the most promising applications for quantum computers to demonstrate exponential advantages. The challenge of designing a quantum ODE algorithm is how to embed non-unitary dynamics into intrinsically unitary quantum circuits. In this work, we propose a new quantum algorithm for solving ODEs by harnessing open quantum systems. Specifically, we propose a novel technique called non-diagonal density matrix encoding, which leverages the inherent non-unitary dynamics of Lindbladians to encode general linear ODEs into the non-diagonal blocks of density matrices. This framework enables us to design quantum algorithms with both theoretical simplicity and high performance. Combined with the state-of-the-art quantum Lindbladian simulation algorithms, our algorithm can outperform all existing quantum ODE algorithms and achieve near-optimal dependence on all parameters under a plausible input model. We also give applications of our algorithm including the Gibbs state preparations and the partition function estimations.

Title: Universal non-Hermitian transport in disordered systems
Authors: Bo Li, Chuan Chen, Zhong Wang
Abstract: In disordered Hermitian systems, localization of energy eigenstates prohibits wave propagation. In non-Hermitian systems, however, wave propagation is possible even when the eigenstates of Hamiltonian are exponentially localized by disorders. We find in this regime that non-Hermitian wave propagation exhibits novel universal scaling behaviors without Hermitian counterpart. Furthermore, our theory demonstrates how the tail of imaginary-part density of states dictates wave propagation in the long-time limit. Specifically, for the three typical classes, namely the Gaussian, the uniform, and the linear imaginary-part density of states, we obtain logarithmically suppressed sub-ballistic transport, and two types of subdiffusion with exponents that depend only on spatial dimensions, respectively. Our work highlights the fundamental differences between Hermitian and non-Hermitian Anderson localization, and uncovers unique universality in non-Hermitian wave propagation.

Title: Efficient Qubit Calibration by Binary-Search Hamiltonian Tracking

Abstract: We present and experimentally implement a real-time protocol for calibrating the frequency of a resonantly driven qubit, achieving exponential scaling in calibration precision with the number of measurements, up to the limit imposed by decoherence. The real-time processing capabilities of a classical controller dynamically generate adaptive probing sequences for qubit-frequency estimation. Each probing evolution time and drive frequency are calculated to divide the prior probability distribution into two branches, following a locally optimal strategy that mimics a conventional binary search. The scheme does not require repeated measurements at the same setting, as it accounts for state preparation and measurement errors. Its use of a parametrized probability distribution favors numerical accuracy and computational speed. We show the efficacy of the algorithm by stabilizing a flux-tunable transmon qubit, leading to improved coherence and gate fidelity. As benchmarked by gate-set tomography, the field-programmable gate array (FPGA) powered control electronics partially mitigates non-Markovian noise, which is detrimental to quantum error correction. The mitigation is achieved by dynamically updating and feeding forward the qubit frequency. Our protocol highlights the importance of feedback in improving the calibration and stability of qubits subject to drift and can be readily applied to other qubit platforms.

Title: Quantum theory of surface lattice resonances
Authors: Michael Reitz, Stephan van den Wildenberg, Arghadip Koner, George C. Schatz, Joel Yuen-Zhou
Abstract: The collective interactions of nanoparticles arranged in periodic structures give rise to high-$Q$ in-plane diffractive modes known as surface lattice resonances (SLRs). While these resonances and their broader implications have been extensively studied within the framework of classical electrodynamics and linear response theory, a quantum optical theory capable of describing the dynamics of these structures, especially in the presence of material nonlinearities, beyond the use of \textit{ad hoc} few-mode approximations is largely missing. To this end, we consider here a lattice of metallic nanoparticles coupled to the background electromagnetic field and derive the quantum input-output relations within the electric dipole approximation. As a first application, we discuss coupling of the nanoparticle array to an external array of emitters and illustrate how the formalism can be extended to molecular optomechanics. Specifically, we show how the high $Q$-factors provided by SLRs can facilitate coupling between the nanoparticle array and collective vibrational modes. Finally, we examine a scenario in which the metallic nanoparticles themselves are replaced with saturable excitonic emitters, illustrating how the nonlinearity of the emitters can be used to switch the SLR condition between different electronic transitions. We further show, using a perturbative approach that explicitly accounts for population dynamics, how the resulting switching dynamics can be observed and characterized in pump-probe experiments. Our work provides a seamless framework to rigorously model SLR phenomena with quantum emitters without resorting to phenomenological treatments of either the electromagnetic environment or the material degrees of freedom.

Title: Breaking coexistence: Zealotry vs. nonlinear social impact
Authors: Christopher R. Kitching, Lucía S. Ramirez, Maxi San Miguel, Tobias Galla
Abstract: We study how zealotry and nonlinear social impact affect consensus formation in the nonlinear voter model, evolutionary games, and the partisan voter model. In all three models, consensus is an absorbing state in finite populations, while coexistence is a possible outcome of the deterministic dynamics. We show that sufficiently strong zealotry, i.e. the presence of agents who never change state, can drive infinite populations to consensus in all three models. However, while evolutionary games and the partisan voter model permit zealotry-induced consensus for all values of their model parameters, the nonlinear voter model does not. Central to this difference is the shape of the social impact function, which quantifies how the influence of a group scales with size, and is therefore a measure of majority and minority effects. We derive general conditions relating the slope of this function at small group sizes to the local stability of consensus. Sublinear impact favours minorities and can override zealotry to prevent consensus, whereas superlinear impact promotes majorities and therefore facilitates consensus. We extend the analysis to finite populations, exploring the time-to-consensus, and the shape of quasi-stationary distributions.

Title: Local Learning Rules for Out-of-Equilibrium Physical Generative Models
Authors: Cyrill Bösch, Geoffrey Roeder, Marc Serra-Garcia, Ryan P. Adams
Abstract: We show that the out-of-equilibrium driving protocol of score-based generative models (SGMs) can be learned via local learning rules. The gradient with respect to the parameters of the driving protocol is computed directly from force measurements or from observed system dynamics. As a demonstration, we implement an SGM in a network of driven, nonlinear, overdamped oscillators coupled to a thermal bath. We first apply it to the problem of sampling from a mixture of two Gaussians in 2D. Finally, we train a 12x12 oscillator network on the MNIST dataset to generate images of handwritten digits 0 and 1.

Title: Quantum i.i.d. Steady States in Open Many-Body Systems
Authors: Takanao Ishii, Masahito Ueda
Abstract: Understanding how a quantum many-body state is maintained stably as a nonequilibrium steady state is of fundamental and practical importance for exploration and exploitation of open quantum systems. We establish a general equivalent condition for an open quantum many-body system governed by the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad dynamics under local drive and/or dissipation to have a quantum independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) steady state. We present a sufficient condition for a system to have a quantum i.i.d. steady state by identifying a set of operators that commute with arbitrary quantum i.i.d. states. In particular, a set of quantum i.i.d. states is found to be an invariant subset of time evolution superoperators for systems that satisfy the sufficient condition. These findings not only identify a class of models with exactly solvable steady states but also lead to a no-go theorem that precludes quantum entanglement and spatial correlations in a broad class of quantum many-body steady states in a dissipative environment.

Title: Competing color superconductivity and color Kondo effect in quark matter
Authors: Pradip Kattel, Abay Zhakenov, Natan Andrei
Abstract: The competition between bulk color superconductivity and the localized screening of a heavy quark impurity, analogous to the Kondo effect, leads to a rich spectrum of phenomena in dense quark matter. We investigate this competition at the edge of a superconducting quark bulk, where both the superconducting gap and the Kondo scale are dynamically generated in a tractable toy model. Utilizing the exact Bethe Ansatz method, we elucidate the resulting boundary physics. We identify distinct regimes characterized by either multi-particle Kondo screening or an unscreened local moment. Crucially, we also uncover a novel intermediate phase featuring impurity screening through a single-particle bound state formed within the superconducting gap. The toy model presented in this work highlights the complex interplay between dynamically generated bulk properties and boundary impurities in extreme QCD environments, offering potential insights into phenomena occurring in heavy-ion collisions and compact stars.

Abstract: We study a lattice fermion model with antiferromagnetic interactions on the three-dimensional cubic lattice. The hopping term of the Hamiltonian has a Weyl-type dispersion. We prove that the model has reflection positivity. Moreover, by relying on the property, we prove the existence of the antiferromagnetic long-range order at low temperatures in a strong coupling regime.

Title: CrystalDiT: A Diffusion Transformer for Crystal Generation
Authors: Xiaohan Yi, Guikun Xu, Xi Xiao, Zhong Zhang, Liu Liu, Yatao Bian, Peilin Zhao
Abstract: We present CrystalDiT, a diffusion transformer for crystal structure generation that achieves state-of-the-art performance by challenging the trend of architectural complexity. Instead of intricate, multi-stream designs, CrystalDiT employs a unified transformer that imposes a powerful inductive bias: treating lattice and atomic properties as a single, interdependent system. Combined with a periodic table-based atomic representation and a balanced training strategy, our approach achieves 9.62% SUN (Stable, Unique, Novel) rate on MP-20, substantially outperforming recent methods including FlowMM (4.38%) and MatterGen (3.42%). Notably, CrystalDiT generates 63.28% unique and novel structures while maintaining comparable stability rates, demonstrating that architectural simplicity can be more effective than complexity for materials discovery. Our results suggest that in data-limited scientific domains, carefully designed simple architectures outperform sophisticated alternatives that are prone to overfitting.

Edgar, Jörg Evers, Olga Kocharovskaya, Ralf Röhlsberger, Yuri Shvyd'ko
Abstract: The $^{45}$Sc nuclear transition from the ground to the isomeric state at 12.389~keV, with a lifetime of 0.46~s, exhibits an extraordinarily narrow natural width of 1.4~feV and a quality factor $\simeq 10^{19}$ -- surpassing those of the most precise atomic clocks -- making $^{45}$Sc a compelling platform for advanced metrology and nuclear clocks. Here we investigate how closely the spectral width and quality factor of the solid-state $^{45}$Sc resonance can approach these natural limits. Using the European X-ray Free-Electron Laser, we confirm the isomer's lifetime via time-delayed incoherent $K_{\alpha,\beta}$ fluorescence and observe previously unreported elastic fluorescence, yielding a partial internal conversion coefficient of 390(60). The absence of a clear nuclear forward scattering signal beyond a 2-ms delay implies environmental broadening of at least $500~\Gamma_{0}$ under experimental conditions, placing bounds on solid-state decoherence mechanisms. These findings set new experimental benchmarks for solid-state nuclear clock development.

Title: Tsunami Solitons Emerging from Superconducting Gap
Authors: Daisuke A. Takahashi
Abstract: We propose a classical integrable system exhibiting the tsunami-like solitons with rocky-desert-like disordered stationary background. One of the Lax operators describing this system is interpretable as a Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian in parity-mixed superconductor. The family of integrable equations is generated from this seed operator by Krichever's method, whose pure $s$-wave limit includes the coupled Schrödinger-Boussinesq hierarchy applied to plasma physics. A linearly unstable finite background with superconducting gap supports the tsunami-soliton solution, where the propagation of the step structure turns back at a certain moment, accompanied with the oscillation on the opposite side. In addition, the equation allows inhomogeneous stationary solutions with arbitrary number of bumps at arbitrary positions, which we coin \textit{the KdV rocks}. In the Zakharov-Shabat scheme, the tsunami solitons are created from the Bogoliubov quasiparticles in energy gap and the KdV rocks from normal electrons/holes. The unexpected large space of stationary solutions comes from the non-coprime Lax pair and the multi-valued Baker-Akhiezer functions on the Riemann surface, formulated in terms of higher-rank holomorphic bundles by Krichever and Novikov. Furthermore, the concept of \textit{isodispersive phases} is introduced to characterize quasiperiodic multi-tsunami backgrounds and consider its classification.
