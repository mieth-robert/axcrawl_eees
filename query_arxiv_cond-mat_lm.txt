Title: Toward fast, accurate and robust AI prediction of ground states in rotating BEC
Authors: Zhizhong Kong, Jerry Zhijian Yang, Cheng Yuan, Xiaofei Zhao
Abstract: We propose an unsupervised deep learning approach for computing the ground state (GS) of rotating Bose-Einstein condensation. To minimize the energy under a mass constraint, our approach introduces two key and novel ingredients: a normalized loss function that exactly enforces the mass constraint, and a training strategy named virtual rotation acceleration that is essential for avoiding local minima and guiding the learning process to the correct quantized vortex phase. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the proposed approach as an effective and accurate method to predict GS across physical conditions--from slow to fast rotation and from isotropic to anisotropic confinement. Through further distillation, we establish a unified operator network capable of efficiently generalizing physical parameters across different phases. It enables rapid GS predictions while correctly capturing phase transitions and is applied for inverse problems.

Title: Parametric Instabilities of Correlated Quantum Matter
Authors: Gal Shavit, Gil Refael
Abstract: Strongly correlated quantum materials exhibit a rich landscape of ordered phases with highly tunable properties, making them an intriguing platform for exploring non-equilibrium phenomena. A key to many of these phases is collective bosonic excitations, encoding fluctuations of the underlying order. In this work, we develop a general theoretical framework for parametric driving of such modes, whereby periodic modulation of microscopic parameters generates resonant two-boson processes. We show that the feasibility and strength of this drive depend sensitively on whether the targeted parameter alters the properties of the bosonic excitations vacuum, linking potential parametric instabilities directly to the fidelity susceptibility of the ground state. The driving facilitates nonthermal melting of the parent orders, as well as stabilization of novel steady states with experimentally distinct signatures. Through microscopic case-studies of correlated electronic systems, we identify promising driving knobs, highlight the role of quantum geometry in the collective modes susceptibility, and propose realistic experimental probes. Collective excitations are a powerful resource for steering correlated phases out of equilibrium, and will likely have several applications in quantum science. Our work provides the toolbox for controlling these excitations.

Title: Non-Reciprocal Zone Boundary Magnon Propagation in Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$
Authors: Tobias Weber, Niclas Heinsdorf, Michal Stekiel, Paul Steffens, Andreas Schnyder, Christian Pfleiderer
Abstract: Inelastic neutron scattering in the chiral magnet Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$ reveals strong non-reciprocal effects on magnon propagation at the boundary of the nuclear Brillouin zone. The non-reciprocal response is strongest at a central position between the zone corner and edge mid-point. We explain these results using an effective linear spin-wave model. While directional effects in chiral magnets have so far only been known to exist at low momenta close to the center of the Brillouin zone, the present study shows that non-reciprocity persists at the highest possible reduced momenta. The observed magnons show very little damping within the limits of our experimental resolution, making them of great interest for the fundamental research on compact, high-frequency magnonic applications.

Title: High-speed antiferromagnetic domain walls driven by coherent spin waves
Authors: Kyle L. Seyler, Hantao Zhang, Daniel Van Beveren, Costel R. Rotundu, Young S. Lee, Ran Cheng, David Hsieh
Abstract: The ability to rapidly manipulate domain walls (DWs) in magnetic materials is key to developing novel high-speed spintronic memory and computing devices. Antiferromagnetic (AFM) materials present a particularly promising platform due to their robustness against stray fields and their potential for exceptional DW velocities. Among various proposed driving mechanisms, coherent spin waves could potentially propel AFM DWs to the magnon group velocity while minimizing dissipation from Joule heating. However, experimental realization has remained elusive due to the dual challenges of generating coherent AFM spin waves near isolated mobile AFM DWs and simultaneously measuring high-speed DW dynamics. Here we experimentally realize an approach where ultrafast laser pulses generate coherent spin waves that drive AFM DWs and develop a technique to directly map the spatiotemporal DW dynamics. Using the room-temperature AFM insulator Sr$_2$Cu$_3$O$_4$Cl$_2$, we observe AFM DW motion with record-high velocities up to ~50 km/s. Remarkably, the direction of DW propagation is controllable through both the pump laser helicity and the sign of the DW winding number. This bidirectional control can be theoretically explained, and numerically reproduced, by the DW dynamics induced by coherent spin waves of the in-plane magnon mode - a phenomenon unique to magnets with an easy-plane anisotropy. Our work uncovers a novel DW propulsion mechanism that is generalizable to a wide range of AFM materials, unlocking new opportunities for ultrafast coherent AFM spintronics.

Title: Superconductivity in the two-dimensional Hubbard model revealed by neural quantum states
Authors: Christopher Roth, Ao Chen, Anirvan Sengupta, Antoine Georges
Abstract: Whether the ground state of the square lattice Hubbard model exhibits superconductivity re- mains a major open question, central to understanding high temperature cuprate superconductors and ultra-cold fermions in optical lattices. Numerical studies have found evidence for stripe-ordered states and superconductivity at strong coupling but the phase diagram remains controversial. Here, we show that one can resolve the subtle energetics of metallic, superconducting, and stripe phases using a new class of neural quantum state (NQS) wavefunctions that extend hidden fermion de- terminant states to Pfaffians. We simulate several hundred electrons using fast Pfaffian algorithms allowing us to measure off-diagonal long range order. At strong coupling and low hole-doping, we find that a non-superconducting filled stripe phase prevails, while superconductivity coexisting with partially-filled stripes is stabilized by a negative next neighbor hopping t-prime, with |t-prime| > 0.1. At larger doping levels, we introduce momentum-space correlation functions to mitigate finite size effects that arise from weakly-bound pairs. These provide evidence for uniform d-wave superconductivity at U = 4, even when t-prime = 0. Our results highlight the potential of NQS approaches, and provide a fresh perspective on superconductivity in the square lattice Hubbard model.

Title: Magnetic structure evolution and magnetoelastic coupling across the spin reorientation transition in TmCrO3
Authors: Vishesh Sharma, Gaurav Gautam, Poonam Yadav, Chin-Wei Wang, Kaya Wei, N. P. Lalla, Theo Siegrist, Shivani Sharma
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of the magnetic structure evolution across the spin reorientation transition in orthorhombic (Pnma) TmCrO3. Magnetic susceptibility reveals canted antiferromagnetic (CAFM) ordering at T_N = 125 K, two compensation points (T_comp1 and T_comp2), followed by magnetization reversal with a magnetic susceptibility minimum between T_comp1 and T_comp2. Heat capacity shows a sharp lambda-type transition at T_N, associated with the long-range antiferromagnetic ordering of Cr, followed by a broad feature near 9 K. Neutron powder diffraction (NPD) establishes the Pn'm'a (Gamma2) magnetic structure below T_N. A gradual change in magnetic structure occurs during the spin-reorientation (SRO) transition below 30 K, where the magnetic symmetry transforms from Pn'm'a (Gamma2) to Pn'ma' (Gamma4) phase. However, below the SRO, neither Gamma2 nor Gamma4 alone adequately fit the intensity of magnetic reflections. A satisfactory refinement is achieved using the monoclinic subgroup P21'/c', derived from a combination of Gamma2 and Gamma4. The gradual SRO of Tm and Cr moments across the compensation regime is consistent with the magnetic symmetry P21'/c'. Furthermore, the ordered moments of Cr and Tm in TmCrO3 exhibit a complex, non-monotonic temperature dependence, with the Tm sublattice driving the spin-reorientation transition near the compensation point. Anomalies in the lattice parameters reveal strong magnetoelastic coupling, linking structural distortions to the SRO.

Title: Hidden symmetry-breaking in a kagome Ising ferromagnet

Abstract: Kagome metals can host unconventional electronic phenomena that emerge from their frustrated lattice geometry and associated band topology. Correlated electronic orders, such as charge-density waves and superconductivity, are observed to intertwine with subtle time-reversal symmetry breaking whose microscopic origin is not currently understood. Here, we provide evidence for such time-reversal symmetry breaking in the kagome metal TbV$_6$Sn$_6$ arising from staggered magnetic moments within the kagome layers. TbV$_6$Sn$_6$ consists of metallic V kagome layers separated by Tb triangular layers that host Ising ferromagnetic order. Deep in the ferromagnetic state, the Tb Ising doublet ground state should display a single, dispersionless spin-flip excitation. Instead, inelastic neutron scattering reveals two sharp excitations associated with inequivalent Tb sites, demonstrating that a symmetry-broken phase coexists with Ising ferromagnetism. No additional structural or magnetic phase transitions are detected, and first-principles calculations rule out lattice distortions as the origin of the splitting. We attribute this effect to time-reversal symmetry breaking encoded by small V moments that couple to the Tb sublattice and leave a measurable spectral fingerprint. Our results establish rare-earth local moment spectroscopy as a sensitive probe of subtle broken symmetries and highlight an unexpected interplay between kagome magnetism and rare-earth local moment magnetism.

Title: Nanorod Pair Complexes Manipulated via Magnetic Casimir Forces
Authors: S Pal, L. M. Woods, C. Persson, I. Brevik, U. De Giovannini, M. Boström
Abstract: Controlling nanoscale interactions to suppress aggregation from short-range attractive forces is a key problem in nanoengineering. Here, we demonstrate a route to modulate Casmir-Lifshitz interactions between anisotropic nanoparticles with the magnetic fluids. By semi-classical quantum electrodynamics, we study ground state dispersion forces for cylindrical dielectric nanorods made of polystyrene (PS), and zinc oxide (ZnO) embedded in toluene-based host media with gold-coated magnetite nanoparticles and also predict magnetic contributions to the non-retarded excited state interaction. The variation in magnetic permeability enables tuning between repulsive and attractive interaction and a thermally unstable and measurable magnetic Casimir traps are predicted between a pair of ZnO-PS nanoparticles whose equilibrium position can be modulated over an order of magnitude with a small variation in the size of the magnetite nanoparticle. This provides an alternative magnetic Casimir-effect pathway to reversibly tune quantum electromagnetic forces at the nanoscale for assembly and enhancement of colloidal stability.

Title: Topological Metal-Insulator Transition within the Ferromagnetic state

Abstract: A major challenge in condensed matter physics is integrating topological phenomena with correlated electron physics to leverage both types of states for next-generation quantum devices. Metal-insulator transitions (MITs) are central to bridging these two domains while simultaneously serving as 'on-off' switches for electronic states. Here, we demonstrate how the prototypical material of K2Cr8O16 undergoes a ferromagnetic MIT accompanied by a change in band topology. Through inelastic x-ray and neutron scattering experiments combined with first-principles theoretical calculations, we demonstrate that this transition is not driven by a Peierls mechanism, given the lack of phonon softening. Instead, we establish the transition as a topological MIT within the ferromagnetic phase (topological-FM-MIT) with potential axionic properties, where electron correlations play a key role in stabilizing the insulating state. This work pioneers the discovery of a topological-FM-MIT and represents a fundamentally new class of topological phase transitions, revealing a unique pathway through which magnetism, topology, and electronic correlations interact.

Title: Random initial data and average shock time in the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou chain
Authors: Matteo Gallone, Ricardo Grande, Antonio Ponno, Stefano Ruffo, Erwan Druais
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou chain with long-wavelength random initial data. When the energy per particle is small, thermal equilibrium is not reached on a fast timescale and the system enters prethermalization. The formation of the prethermal state is characterized by the development of a Burgers-type shock and the onset of a turbulent-like spectrum with a time dependent exponent $\zeta(t)$ in the inertial range. We perform a significant step forward by demonstrating that these features are robust under generic long-wavelength random initial conditions. By employing advanced probabilistic techniques inspired by the works of Dudley and Talagrand, we derive a sharp asymptotic expression for the average shock time in the thermodynamic limit. For large $p$, this time scales as $(p \sqrt{\log p})^{-1}$, where $p$ is the number of excited modes proving that it is an intensive quantity up to a logarithmic correction in the size of the system.

Title: Control of Spontaneous Orientation Polarization in Organic Semiconductors: The Role of Molecular Structure and Film Growth Conditions
Authors: Albin Cakaj, Markus Schmid, Alexander Hofmann, Wolfgang Brütting
Abstract: Spontaneous orientation polarization (SOP) occurs when molecules with a finite permanent dipole moment are grown as thin films by physical vapor deposition and their alignment is such that a net non-zero polarization remains. We discuss how SOP in organic semiconductors can be controlled by the design of molecules as well as the film growth conditions and discuss its relevance in organic light-emitting devices.

Title: The pseudogap and strange metal states in the square-lattice Hubbard model: a comprehensive study
Authors: Arata Tanaka
Abstract: To clarify the origin of the pseudogap and strange metal states as well as their mutual relationship in cuprate superconductors, a comprehensive study on the spectral function, Fermi surface, resistivity and dynamical spin susceptivity of the Hubbard model on the square lattice has been conducted by means of the ladder dual-fermion approximation with an electron self-energy correction. It is found that the appearance of these two states requires that the characteristic hole concentration below which the Mott-Heisenberg and Slater mechanisms of electron localization occurs $p_{\rm MS}$ nearly coincides with the hole concentration where the Van Hove singularity (VHS) point is placed at the vicinity of the Fermi level. When this condition is met the VHS point is pined at which the nesting condition of the antiferromagnetic (AFM) fluctuation is fulfilled almost everywhere on the Fermi surface in wide range of the hole concentration in a metallic state, i.e., the strange metal state. The spin fluctuation of the strange metal state is nearly quantum critical and the dynamical spin susceptivity is well described by overdamped spin wave having the $\omega/T$ scaling with the relaxation rate at the Planckian limit. Because of these distinctive features of the strange metal state, the $k$ dependence of scattering rate of electrons is small and electrons behave as the marginal Fermi liquid, resulting in $T$-linear resistivity. In contrast, the pseudogap state is magnetically in the renormalized classical regime and the pseudogap is formed near the X point where the nesting condition of the short-range AFM order is fulfilled.

Title: Fusion of two critical points and accelerated phase dynamics in orientational ternary mixtures
Authors: Hiroshi Yokota
Abstract: Motivated by intracellular phase separation, we theoretically investigate how molecular orientation and multi-component nature affect phase behavior. We construct a minimal model for a ternary mixture composed of isotropic (I), anisotropic (A), and solvent (s) components by combining the Flory-Huggins and Maier-Saupe theories. We obtain two main results from evaluating the phase behavior and the time evolution of the density fields. First, for certain interaction parameters, two distinct binodal lines appear in the plane of the volume fractions of the I- and A-components, and merge through their respective critical points. Second, rapid droplet formation emerges due to a weakly first-order phase transition, characterized by a discontinuity of the spinodal surface. The first result indicates the possibility of continuous transformation between the two phase-separated states. The second result suggests that anisotropic molecules can regulate phase separation kinetics. These findings might be physically general beyond biological systems.

Title: Short-range order influences H distribution in Fe-Ni-Cr austenitic stainless steels
Authors: Tianyu Su, Brian J. Blankenau, Namhoon Kim, Kshitij Vijayvargia, Petros Sofronis, Jessica A. Krogstad, Elif Ertekin
Abstract: Hydrogen embrittlement (HE) in austenitic stainless steels is advanced by hydrogen enhanced localized plasticity (HELP), typically accompanied by a transition from homogeneous to localized slip. Short-range order (SRO) in face-centered cubic (FCC) alloys is known to promote slip planarity, and recent studies suggest that H may amplify this localization behavior linked to inherent SRO. However, the manner in which the introduction of H affects SRO properties and, conversely, the manner that pre-existing SRO may affect H behavior, are not fully understood. In this work, a spin cluster expansion model combined with Monte Carlo simulation is employed to study the interplay between H and SRO in Fe-Ni-Cr alloys. Chemical order is quantified using Warren-Cowley SRO parameters, and the model predictions are validated against experimental data. We find that the presence of H only slightly alters the intrinsic ordering preference of the Fe-Ni-Cr alloys. As temperature decreases and the alloy evolves from disordered to ordered thermodynamic states, distinct H-metal correlations emerge. In particular, H-Ni and H-Cr pairs exhibit stronger ordering tendencies than H-Fe pairs, suggesting a selective affinity of H for certain atomic environments. On the other hand, we also find that compared to random alloys, when pre-existing SRO is present, it significantly affects the resulting H distribution by promoting local H enrichment in SRO domains. Such SRO-driven local H accumulation may facilitate slip localization and contribute to the early onset of embrittlement. These findings provide thermodynamic and structural insights into the interaction between H and SRO in austenitic stainless steels, highlighting possible implications on how the interaction between HELP and SRO brings about hydrogen embrittlement in austenitic stainless steels.

Title: Compliant Mechanisms for Invertible Poisson's Ratio and Tunable Stiffness in Cell Culture Substrates
Authors: Manu Sebastian, Sreenath Balakrishnan, Safvan Palathingal
Abstract: The mechanical environment of a substrate plays a key role in influencing the behavior of adherent biological cells. Traditional tunable substrates have limitations as their mechanical properties cannot be dynamically altered in-situ during cell culture. We present an alternate approach by using compliant mechanisms that enable realization of tunable substrate properties, specifically, invertible Poisson's ratio and tunable stiffness. These mechanisms transition between positive and negative Poisson's effects with tunable magnitude through a bistable Engaging-Disengaging Compliant Mechanism (EDCM). EDCM allows stiffness between two points of the substrate to switch between zero and theoretically infinite. In the stiffened state, lateral deformation reverses under a constant axial load, while in the zero-stiffness state, the deformation direction remains outward as that of re-entrant structure. EDCM in conjunction with an offset mechanism also allows tuning of the effective stiffness of the entire mechanism. We present analytical models correlating geometric parameters to displacement ratios in both bistable states and through illustrative design cases, demonstrate their potential for designing dynamic and reconfigurable cell culture substrates.

Title: A Dual-Memory Ferroelectric Transistor Emulating Synaptic Metaplasticity for High-Speed Reservoir Computing
Authors: Yifan Wang, Muhammad Sakib Shahriar, Salma Soliman, Noah Vaillancourt, Lance Fernandes, Andrea Padovani, Asif Islam Khan, Md Sakib Hasan, Raisul Islam
Abstract: The exponential growth of edge artificial intelligence demands material-focused solutions to overcome energy consumption and latency limitations when processing real-time temporal data. Physical reservoir computing (PRC) offers an energy-efficient paradigm but faces challenges due to limited device scalability and reconfigurability. Additionally, reservoir and readout layers require memory of different timescales, short-term and long-term respectively - a material challenge hindering CMOS-compatible implementations. This work demonstrates a CMOS-compatible ferroelectric transistor using hafnium-zirconium-oxide (HZO) and silicon, enabling dual-memory operation. This system exhibits non-volatile long-term memory (LTM) from ferroelectric HZO polarization and volatile short-term memory (STM) from engineered non-quasi-static (NQS) channel-charge relaxation driven by gate-source/drain overlap capacitance. Ferroelectric polarization acts as non-volatile programming of volatile dynamics: by modulating threshold voltage, the ferroelectric state deterministically switches the NQS time constant and computational behavior between paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) and depression (PPD). This establishes a generalizable material-design principle applicable to diverse ferroelectric-semiconductor heterostructures, extending beyond silicon to oxide semiconductors and heterogeneously-integrated systems. The device solves second-order nonlinear tasks with 3.69 x 10^-3 normalized error using only 16 reservoir states - ~5x reduction - achieving 20 us response time (~1000x faster) and 1.5 x 10^-7 J energy consumption, providing an immediately manufacturable pathway for neuromorphic hardware and energy-efficient edge intelligence.

Title: Inhomogeneous dynamic state in the double trillium lattice antiferromagnet KBaFe$_2$(PO$_4$)$_3$
Authors: S. J. Sebastian, S. S. Islam, R. Kolay, S. Mohanty, Q. P. Ding, Y. Skourski, J. Sichelschmidt, M. Baenitz, Jonas A. Krieger, T. J. Hicken, H. Luetkens, A. A. Tsirlin, Y. Furukawa, R. Nath
Abstract: The three-dimensional (3D) magnet KBaFe$_2$(PO$_4$)$_3$ hosts a double-trillium lattice of Fe$^{3+}$ (spin, $S=5/2$) ions offering a prototypical platform to study the frustration induced effects in 3D. Through magnetization, specific heat, $^{31}$P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and muon spin relaxation ($\mu$SR) experiments, supported by first principles calculations, we uncover an unconventional ground state. Despite strong antiferromagnetic interactions with a large Curie-Weiss temperature $\theta_{\rm CW} = -70(2)$ K, no magnetic long-range order is observed down to 30 mK. Below $T^{\ast}\simeq 3.5$ K, the NMR linewidth becomes nearly field-independent and the spin-spin relaxation rate $1/T_2$ saturates, accompanied by an inhomogeneous distribution of transverse nuclear magnetization $M_{xy}$. The latter indicates the emergence of short-range dynamical correlations, which was further corroborated by a robust and field-insensitive broad maximum in specific heat. In $\mu$SR, we detect neither a static internal field nor spin freezing; instead the relaxation remains dynamic and is best described by two coexisting dynamic relaxation channels: a dominant fast (sporadic) channel and a slower Markovian component. Their differing weights and fluctuation rates suggest microscopic inhomogeneity in spin dynamics. Altogether, KBaFe$_2$(PO$_4$)$_3$ exemplifies a rare high-spin stochiometric 3D antiferromagnet that evades ordering and instead fosters a mosaic of spin dynamics driven by strong geometric frustration intrinsic to the trillium lattice.

Title: Gradient flow and Bogomolny bounds for quantum metric actions
Authors: T. Fukui
Abstract: We formulate gradient flow dynamics generated by two natural actions of the quantum metric for an isolated set of Bloch bands. Specializing to two spatial dimensions, we derive Bogomolny-type lower bounds that relate these actions to the Chern number and show that the bounds are saturated by (anti-)holomorphic projector configurations. Along the flows, the actions decrease monotonically while the Chern number is conserved, giving a constructive route to simplify models within a fixed topological phase toward canonical, low-complexity representatives.

Title: Mesoscopic Correlations in Aqueous Alkylamine Mixtures Between Molecular and Micro Emulsions
Authors: Aurelien Perera
Abstract: Understanding how molecular correlations give rise to mesoscale organization is central to the physics of complex fluids such as hydrogen-bonded mixtures. In this work, we develop a mesoscale bridge formalism that connects the site-site Ornstein-Zernike (SSOZ) framework to the field theoretical Teubner-Strey (TS) approach. This bridge highlights how local orientational correlations, typically lost in the SSOZ closure, reemerge as effective long-range components at the mesoscale. The resulting theory provides a unified description of density fluctuations spanning molecular to mesoscopic length scales. The approach is illustrated using X-ray scattering spectra from simulated and experimental hydrogen-bonded fluids, showing that the TS representation captures the essential features of the mesoscale structure. Beyond this specific application, the proposed formalism offers a general route to interpret the structural crossover between microscopic interactions and collective mesoscale organization in complex fluids, including aqueous and amphiphilic systems.

Title: Persistently Non-Gaussian Metastable Liquids
Authors: Vinay Vaibhav, Tamoghna Das, Suman Dutta
Abstract: Particles undergoing Fickian diffusion within smooth energy landscapes exhibit Gaussian statistics. However, this Gaussian behavior is often elusive in complex liquids, where particle dynamics within spontaneously fluctuating or spatio-temporally heterogeneous environments lead to a breakdown of ergodicity and time-reversal symmetry. This is usually caused by extreme particle movements or sudden dynamical arrest. Such situations are prevalent in dense metastable liquids exhibiting slow flow or cooperative movements, facilitated by cage-breaking. We investigate the dynamics of glassy systems driven by either thermal, external, or environmental fluctuations. Despite their differences, our findings reveal that particle motion is universally affected by large deviations, resulting in non-Gaussian tails persisting over multiple decades in time. We further discuss the underlying dynamical aspects.

Title: Angular Patterns of Photoluminescence in Quantum Dot Spherical Superparticles Mediated by Whispering-Gallery Modes
Authors: Yu. E. Geints
Abstract: Quantum dot superparticles are a specific class of metamaterials created through the self-assembly of nanometer semiconductor quantum dots into organized micro-scale structures, such as microspheres. Superparticles exhibit unique optical, chemical, and electronic properties. These properties are not merely the sum of the constituent quantum dots but rather bear the signature of the collective behavior of the nanoscale building blocks. In particular, assembling an ensemble of quantum dots into a super-sphere allows them to function as a single, high-quality optical resonator. This structure efficiently confines the emission from the pump-excited quantum dots via whispering gallery modes. The emissive properties of such a superparticle resonator remain an area of active investigation. Using numerical simulation, we study the angular structure of the photoluminescence from superparticles of various sizes and architectures formed from CdS quantum dots. We show that, in general, the angular distribution of the SP emission is characterized by strong asymmetry, with a maximum in the backward direction relative to the incident pump beam. In contrast, this asymmetry is virtually absent in the forward and side-scattering directions. The excitation of resonant modes in the superparticle enhances the emission intensity and reduces the degree of its backward asymmetry. Furthermore, coating the CdS quantum dot particle with a silicon dioxide layer increases the probability of exciting field resonances in such a core-shell superparticle.

Title: High and Magnetic-field-dependent Surface Carriers Mobility in 3D Topological Insulators without Bulk States
Authors: M. V. Pugachev, A. E. Borisov, A. V. Shupletsov, V. O. Sakhin, E. F. Kukovitsky, A. Yu. Kuntsevich
Abstract: By applying the conventional two-liquid model to the magnetoresistivity tensor, we reveal a record-high carrier mobility for surface states in tetradymite topological insulators ($\sim$ 20000 cm$^2$/Vs) in both bulk crystals and thin flakes of Sn-Bi$_{1.1}$Sb$_{0.9}$Te$_2$S. Bulk crystals of this 3D topological insulator exhibit a transition from bulk to surface-dominated conductivity below 100 K, whereas in thin flakes, bulk conductivity is suppressed at even higher temperatures. Our data therefore suggest that a key ingredient for elevated mobility is the absence of bulk carriers at the Fermi level. A fingerprint of the high-mobility carriers, i.e a steep low-field magnetoresistance along with a strong Hall effect nonlinearity below 1 T, signifies the presence of at least two surface-related carrier species, even when bulk states are frozen out. To explain the magnetoresistance and the Hall effect in a wider range of magnetic fields ($>1$ T), one must assume that the carrier mobility drops with the field. The influence of Zeeman splitting on mobility and the contribution of anomalous Hall conductivity provide a much better description of the magnetoresistance and the nonlinearity of the Hall coefficient. Our data call for a revision of the surface state mobility in 3D topological insulators.

Title: Implementation and application of a DFT$+U$$+V$ approach within the all-electron FLAPW method
Authors: Wejdan Beida, Gustav Bihlmayer, Christoph Friedrich, Gregor Michalicek, Daniel Wortmann, Stefan Blügel
Abstract: We present an implementation of the density-functional theory DFT$+U$$+V$ formalism within the all-electron full-potential linearized augmented-plane-wave (FLAPW) method as implemented in the FLEUR code. The DFT$+U$$+V$ formalism extends DFT, supplemented by the onsite Coulomb interaction $U$, to address local correlation effects in localized states by incorporating intersite Coulomb interaction terms $V$. It holds promise for improving charge and bond disproportionation, charge and orbital ordering, charge density wave formation, charge transfer, and the intersite correlation resulting from hybridization between states of neighboring sites in a solid. $U$ and $V$ parameters are obtained from first principles using the constrained random-phase approximation (cRPA) employing two different atom basis representations to project the screened Coulomb interaction: the Wannier and the muffin-tin basis functions. We investigate in detail the impact of the $V$ term for typical covalently bonded materials like graphene, for bulk semiconductors such as silicon and germanium, and for charge-transfer insulators like NiO. Our results demonstrate an improvement in accuracy of specific properties across these systems, providing a framework for describing materials with different interaction regimes. We compare our DFT$+U$$+V$ results using our cRPA parameter sets with (i) previous DFT$+U$$+V$ calculation employing pseudopotential approximations, (ii) with experimental results and (iii) with our $GW$ results.

Title: On the decay of spatial correlations in the Tonks gas
Authors: Ana M. Montero, Andrés Santos
Abstract: We provide an alternative derivation of the asymptotic behavior of the radial distribution function $g(r)$ for the one-dimensional Tonks gas at high packing fractions, recently analyzed by Bouzar and Messina [Phys. Rev. E 112, L042105 (2025)]. Our approach is based on the Laplace representation of $g(r)$ and pole analysis. By identifying the poles and residues of the Laplace transform in the limit of small void fraction, we obtain an exact representation of $g(r)$ in terms of the Jacobi elliptic theta function $\theta_3$. This representation is shown to be essentially equivalent to the Gaussian superposition found by Bouzar and Messina through the Poisson summation formula, but offers a more compact form that naturally reveals the two asymptotic regimes governing the oscillatory decay toward unity: an algebraic decay at intermediate distances and an exponential decay at large distances. Our method complements the original analysis by connecting the spatial oscillations directly to the pole structure in Laplace space.

Title: Tuning Stability of AB3-Type Alloys by Suppressing Magnetism
Authors: Hung Ba Tran, Toyoto Sato, Ryuhei Sato, Hiroyuki Saitoh, Shin-ichi Orimo, Hao Li
Abstract: Hydrogen is a promising clean energy carrier, yet effective and reversible storage remains challenging. AB3-type intermetallic alloys are promising for solid-state hydrogen storage due to intermediate thermodynamic stability and rapid hydrogen uptake. Optimizing stability and gravimetric density is hindered by competing thermodynamic and magnetic effects. Here, we analyze AB3 compounds (A = Ca, Y, Mg; B = Co, Ni) and ternary alloys CaxYyMg1-x-yB3 using first-principles calculations and Monte Carlo simulations. We find a direct correlation between formation energy and total magnetic moment that dictates alloy stability, explaining the trade-off in hydrogen storage. In Co-rich systems with large lattice volumes, formation energy rises with magnetization, showing magnetism as the dominant factor. Mg-rich compositions achieve high gravimetric densities, but strong magnetism destabilizes the system, requiring Y substitution to suppress magnetic moments. Replacing Co with Ni weakens magnetism: YNi3 is nonmagnetic, while CaNi3 and MgNi3 are weakly polarized, allowing thermodynamic stability across compositions. Notably, CaMg2Ni9 combines high theoretical capacity (3.32 wt%) with good reversibility. Mg-rich Ni-based alloys are predicted to offer negative formation energies with the highest gravimetric densities (up to 3.40 wt%). These results show that controlling magnetism via transition-metal substitution is key to overcoming the stability-capacity trade-off in AB3 hydrogen storage materials.

Title: Attosecond-resolved coherent control of zone-folded acoustic phonons in silicon carbide
Authors: Hiromu Matsumoto, Tsukasa Maruhashi, Yosuke Kayanuma, Yadong Han, Jianbo Hu, Kazutaka G. Nakamura
Abstract: Zone-folded acoustic phonons (6 THz) in 4H silicon carbide (SiC) have been coherently excited using a femtosecond near-infrared pulse and measured through transient reflectivity with a pump and probe protocol. Their amplitude is coherently controlled with 300-attoseconds precision and the results show interference fringe patterns due to electronic and phonon interference. The results are well reproduced by a model calculation with two electronic and phonon levels and an impulsive stimulated Raman process. Using the model, we obtain the analytical form of the coherent control scheme at an off-resonant condition.

Title: Localization transitions in an open quasiperiodic ladder

Abstract: We investigate localization transition in an open quasiperiodic ladder where the quasiperiodicity is described by the Aubry-André-Harper model. While previous studies have shown that higher-order hopping or constrained quasiperiodic potentials can induce a mixed-phase zone in one dimension, we demonstrate that the dissipation can induce mixed phase zone in a one dimensional nearest-neighbor system without imposing any explicit constraints on the quasiperiodic potential or hopping param- eter. Our approach exploits an exact correspondence between the eigenspectrum of the Liouvillian superoperator and that of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, valid for quadratic fermionic systems un- der linear dissipation. Using third quantization approach within Majorana fermionic representation, we analyze two dissipation configurations: alternating gain and loss at every site, and at alternate sites under balanced and imbalanced conditions. By computing the inverse and normalized partici- pation ratios, we show that dissipation can drive the system into three distinct phases: delocalizd, mixed, and localized. Notably, the mixed-phase zone is absent for balanced dissipation at every site but emerges upon introducing imbalance, while for alternate site dissipation it appears in both balanced and imbalanced cases. Furthermore, the critical points and the width of the mixed-phase window can be selectively tuned by varying the dissipation strength. These findings reveal that the dissipation plays a decisive role in reshaping localization transitions in quasiperiodic systems, offering new insight into the interplay between non-Hermitian effects and quasiperiodic order.

Title: Non-destructive 3D characterization of microtextured regions in the bulk of Ti-6Al-4V alloy
Authors: Mads Carlsen, Xiaohan Zeng, Haixing Fang, Moritz Frewein, Tilman A. Grünewald, Joao Quinta da Fonseca, Wolfgang Ludwig
Abstract: In this study we present spatially resolved texture and orientation maps from a cube-shaped sample of Ti-6Al-4V alloy, reconstructed by means of texture tomography (TT). Unlike grain resolved 3DXRD techniques which require "spotty" diffraction patterns, TT can reconstruct local (voxelized) orientation distribution function (ODFs) from continuous diffraction patterns collected in a 3D scanning procedure. Reconstructions of the same sample, scanned in two different settings and subsequent EBSD analysis parallel to one of the sample faces show excellent mutual agreement and validate the single-axis data collection and reconstruction procedure for this class of materials. The reconstruction reveals the presence and the 3D shape of several micro-textured regions, showing a sharp unimodal texture of the $\alpha$-phase with a clear link of the orientation and spatial alignment of these zones to the rolling, transverse and normal directions of the rolled material.

Title: Confinement-induced collective motion in suspensions of run-and-tumble particles
Authors: José Martín-Roca, Daniel Escobar Ortiz, Chantal Valeriani, Horacio Serna
Abstract: Collective motion is ubiquitous in active systems at all length and time scales. The mechanisms behind such collective motion usually are alignment interactions between active particles, effective alignment after collisions between agents or symmetry-breaking fluctuations induced by passive species in active suspensions. In this article, we introduce a new type of collective motion in the shape of a traveling band induced purely by confinement, where no explicit or effective alignment are prescribed among active agents. We study a suspension of run-and-tumble particles confined in microchannels comprising asymmetric boundaries: one flat wall and one array of funnel-like obstacles. We study the phase behavior of the confined active suspension upon changes in the packing fraction and the persistence length to define the stability region of the traveling band. We characterize the traveling band structurally and dynamically and study its stability with respect to the tilt angle of the obstacles. Lastly, we describe the mechanism of motion of the band, which resembles the tracked locomotion of some heavy vehicles like tractors, finding that a counter-flux of active particles in the lower part of the band, explained in terms of source-sink and vacancy diffusion mechanisms, is the facilitator of the traveling band and sustains its motion. We name this new collective phenomenon confinement-induced tracked locomotion

Title: (Dis-)appearance of liquid-liquid phase transitions in a heterogeneous activated patchy particle model and experiment
Authors: Furio Surfaro, Peixuan Liang, Hadra Banks, Fajun Zhang, Frank Schreiber, Martin Oettel
Abstract: The ion-activated patchy particle model is an important theoretical framework to investigate the phase be- haviour of globular proteins in the presence of multivalent ions. In this work, we study and highlight the influence of patch heterogeneity on the extension, appearance and disappearance of the liquid-liquid coexis- tence region of the phase diagram. We demonstrate that within this model the binding energy between salt ions and patches of different type is a key factor in determining the phase behavior. Specifically, we show under which conditions liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) in these systems can appear or disappear for varying binding energy and ion-mediated attraction energy between ion-occupied and unoccupied patches. In particular we address the influence of the patch type dependence of these energies on the (dis)appearance of LLPS. These results rationalize our new results on ion-dependent liquid-liquid phase separation in solutions of bovine serum albumine with trivalent cations. In comparison with models with non-activated patches, where the gas-liquid transition disappears when the number of patches approaches two, we find the complementary mechanism that ions may shift the attractions from stronger to weaker patches (with an accompanying disappearance of the transition), if their binding energy to the patches changes. The results have implications for the understanding of charge-driven LLPS in biological systems and its suppression.

Title: On the Role of Interlayer Electrons on the Frictional Behavior of Two-Dimensional Electrides
Authors: Jingcheng Qi, Giuliana Materzanini, Gian-Marco Rignanese, Maria Clelia Righi, Junjie Wang
Abstract: Friction accounts for up to 30% of global energy consumption, underscoring the urgent need for superlubricity in advanced materials. Two-dimensional (2D) electrides are layered materials with cationic layers separated by 2D confined electrons that act as anions. This study reveals the unique frictional properties of these compounds and the underlying mechanisms. We establish that interlayer friction correlates with the cationic charges and sliding-induced charge redistribution. Remarkably, the 2D electride Ba2N stands out for its lower interlayer friction than graphene, despite its stronger interlayer adhesion, defying conventional tribological understanding. This anomalous behavior arises from electron redistribution as the dominant energy dissipation pathway. Combining ab initio calculations and deep potential molecular dynamics (DPMD) simulations, we show that incommensurate twisted interfaces (2° < {\theta} < 58°) in Ba2N achieve structural superlubricity by suppressing out-of-plane buckling and energy corrugation. Notably, a critical normal load of 2.3 GPa enables barrier-free sliding in commensurate Ba2N ({\theta} = 0°), with an ultralow shear-to-load ratio of 0.001, suggesting the potential for superlubricity. Moreover, electron doping effectively reduces interlayer friction by controllably modulating stacking energies in 2D electrides. These findings establish 2D electrides as a transformative platform for energy-efficient tribology, enabling scalable superlubricity through twist engineering, load adaptation, or electrostatic gating. Our work advances the fundamental understanding of electron-mediated friction, with Ba2N serving a model system for cost-effective, high-performance material design.

Title: Suppression of magnetism in Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ under external pressure
Authors: A. Chmeruk, D. Jones, R. Balducci, J. Ebad-Allah, F. Beiuşeanu, F. Schilberth, M. A. Kassem, U. Schade, A. Veber, L. Puskar, Y. Tabata, T. Waki, H. Nakamura, C. A. Kuntscher, A. Östlin, L. Chioncel
Abstract: The ability to control the magnetic state provides a powerful means to tune the underlying band topology, enabling transitions between distinct electronic phases and the emergence of novel quantum phenomena. In this work, we address the evolution of ferromagnetic state upon applying external pressures up to 10.8~GPa using a combined experimental and theoretical study. The standard \emph{ab initio} Density Functional Theory computation including ionic relaxations grossly overestimates the unit cell magnetization as a function of pressure. In our theoretical analysis we identify two possible mechanisms to remedy this shortcoming. Matching the experimental observations is achieved by a symmetry-preserving adjustment of the sulfur atoms position within the unit cell. Alternatively, we explore various combinations of the exchange and correlation parts of the effective potential which reproduce the experimental magnetization, the structural parameters and the measured optical conductivity spectra. Thus, the pressure-dependent behavior of magnetization demands a careful theoretical treatment and analysis of theoretical and experimental data.

Title: Prediction of the three-phase coexistence line of the ethane hydrate from molecular simulation
Authors: Paula Gómez-Álvarez, Miguel J. Torrejón, Jesús Algaba, Felipe J. Blas
Abstract: We investigate the three-phase coexistence line of ethane (C$_2$H$_6$) hydrate through molecular dynamics simulations using the direct coexistence approach. In this framework, C$_2$H$_6$ sI hydrate, aqueous, and pure guest phases are constructed within a single simulation box, allowing us to monitor their mutual stability. From the temporal evolution of the potential energy, we identify the equilibrium temperature (T$_3$) at which all three phases coexist, across pressures ranging from 1000 to 4000 bar, in accordance with available experimental data. Simulations are performed with the GROMACS package (version 2016, double precision) in the $NPT$ ensemble. Water and C$_2$H$_6$ molecules are represented using the TIP4P/Ice and TraPPE-UA models, respectively, while unlike non-bonded interactions are computed with the Lorentz-Berthelot combining rule. Dispersive Lennard-Jones and Coulomb interactions are truncated at 1.6 nm, with long-range Coulombic contributions treated via Particle-Mesh Ewald summation. The predicted three-phase coexistence line shows excellent agreement with experimental measurements within the investigated pressure range. These results demonstrate the suitability of the direct coexistence methodology, combined with established molecular models, for reproducing hydrate dissociation behavior in systems that have received little prior computational attention.

Title: Carrier-envelope phase control of ultrafast photocurrents in layered MoS$_2$
Authors: Johannes Schmuck, Björn Sinz, Nina Pettinger, Sergey Zherebtsov, Alexander W. Holleitner
Abstract: We demonstrate carrier-envelope-phase (CEP)-controlled photocurrents in mono-, bi-, and tri-layer MoS$_2$ driven by few-cycle laser pulses. The photocurrent in the two-terminal devices scales quadratically with the field amplitude, indicating perturbative carrier dynamics in the weak-field regime distinct from strong-field tunnelling. Our results extend light-field-sensitive current control from bulk dielectrics, semiconductors, and graphene to two-dimensional transition-metal dichalcogenides, highlighting their potential for electric-field sensitive optoelectronics.

Title: Coherence enhanced by detrained oscillators: Breaking $π$-reflection symmetry
Authors: Hyunsuk Hong, Jae Sung Lee, Hyunggyu Park
Abstract: We study a generalized Kuramoto model in which each oscillator carries two coupled phase variables, representing a minimal swarmalator system. Assuming perfect correlation between the intrinsic frequencies associated with each phase variable, we identify a novel dynamic mode characterized by bounded oscillatory motion that breaks the $\pi$-reflection symmetry. This symmetry breaking enhances global coherence and gives rise to a non-trivial mixed state, marked by distinct degrees of ordering in each variable. Numerical simulations confirm our analytic predictions for the full phase diagram, including the nature of transition. Our results reveal a fundamental mechanism through which detrained (dynamic) oscillators can promote global synchronization, offering broad insights into coupled dynamical systems beyond the classical Kuramoto paradigm.

Title: Control of ultrafast excitonic shift current induced THz emission efficiency of layered MoS2 crystals
Authors: Neetesh Dhakar, Sunil Kumar
Abstract: Following the ultrafast photoexcitation of a semiconductor, it embodies competing dynamics among photocarriers, many-body transient states of highly energetic excitons, and electron-hole liquid. Here, we show that femtosecond optical pulse excitation induces transient excitonic shift current contributing to stronger THz emission from a single crystalline bulk MoS2 at low temperatures. The control of dominating excitonic shift current is elucidated from excitation density dependent experiments at varying temperatures. A strong decrease in the excitonic contribution beyond a critical fluence of 150microJ/cm^2 is observed at a very low temperature of 20K. This behavior suggests the formation of a new quantum condensate, i.e., the electron-hole liquid, in the regime when the exciton density is overwhelmingly large that the average spacing between exciton pairs is comparable to the exciton radius. Furthermore, the exciton density dependent THz emission at varying temperatures is consistent with the Varshni model and the crystal Debye temperature of 260K.

Title: High-Winding-Number Zero-Energy Edge States in Rhombohedral-Stacked Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Multilayers
Authors: Feng Lu, Ao Zhou, Shujie Cheng, Gao Xianlong
Abstract: We study the topological properties of rhombohedral-stacked N-layer Su-Schrieffer-Heeger networks with interlayer coupling. We find that these systems exhibit $2N$-fold degenerate zero-energy edge states with winding number $W=N$, providing a direct route to high-winding-number topological phases where $W$ equals the layer number. Using effective Hamiltonian theory and Zak phase calculations, we demonstrate that the winding number scales linearly with $N$ through a layer-by-layer topological amplification mechanism. We introduce the Wigner entropy as a novel detection method for these edge states, showing that topological boundary states exhibit significantly enhanced Wigner entropy compared to bulk states. Our results establish rhombohedral stacking as a systematic approach for engineering high-winding-number topological insulators with potential applications in quantum information processing.

Title: Growth-Controlled Twinning and Magnetic Anisotropy in CeSb$_2$
Authors: Jan T. Weber (1 and 2), Kristin Kliemt (1), Sergey L. Bud'ko (2 and 3), Paul C. Canfield (2 and 3), Cornelius Krellner (1) ((1) Kristall- und Materiallabor, Physikalisches Institut, Goethe-Universität Frankfurt, Germany, (2) Ames National Laboratory, U.S. DOE, Ames, USA, (3) Department of Physics and Astronomy, Iowa State University, Ames, USA)
Abstract: Cerium diantimonide (CeSb$_2$) is a layered heavy-fermion Kondo lattice material that hosts complex magnetism and pressure-induced superconductivity. The interpretation of its in-plane anisotropy has remained unsettled due to structural twinning, which superimposes orthogonal magnetic responses. Here we combine controlled crystal growth with magnetization and rotational magnetometry to disentangle the effects of twinning. Nearly untwinned high-quality single crystals reveal the intrinsic in-plane anisotropy: the in-plane easy axis saturates at $M_{\text{easy}}(4~\text{T}) \approx 1.8~\mu_{\text{B}}$/Ce, while the in-plane hard axis magnetization is strongly suppressed, nearly linear, and comparable to the out-of-plane response. These results resolve long-standing discrepancies in reported magnetic measurements, in which in-plane metamagnetic transition fields and saturation magnetization varied significantly across previous studies. Growth experiments demonstrate that avoiding the proposed $\alpha$-$\beta$ structural transition $-$ through Sb-rich flux and slower cooling $-$ systematically reduces twinning. However, powder X-ray diffraction and differential thermal analysis measurements show no clear evidence of a distinct $\beta$ phase. Our results establish a consistent magnetic phase diagram and provide essential constraints for crystal-electric field models, enabling a clearer understanding of the interplay between anisotropic magnetism and unconventional superconductivity in CeSb$_2$.

Title: Non-linear spin wave theory in the strong easy-axis limit of the triangular XXZ model
Authors: Achille Mauri, Siebe Roose, Frédéric Mila
Abstract: Motivated by recent experimental studies, we investigate the spectrum of the nearest-neighbour triangular XXZ model within the $1/S$ expansion, in the limit in which the exchange couplings present a strong easy-axis anisotropy $J_{xy}/J_{zz} \ll 1$. We show that in the limit in which $1/S \to 0$ and $J_{xy} \to 0$ at fixed $V = J_{zz}/(S J_{xy})$, the triangular spin model can be reduced to an effective boson model with quartic interactions on the honeycomb lattice. This effective model interpolates between a spin-wave ($V \to 0$) and a strong-coupling limit ($V \to \infty$), and encodes in a simple framework the regimes discussed by Kleine et al. [Z. Phys. B Condens. Matter 86, 405 (1992); 87, 103 (1992)]. For zero field, the classical ground state of the model presents an accidental degeneracy, which has a particularly simple form and which can be expressed in terms of a simple symmetry of the classical energy. The model thus offers a particularly transparent realization of a theory with quantum order-by-disorder and a pseudo-Goldstone mode. We analyze the spectrum at zero magnetic field by calculating the self-energy at one-loop order, using a self-consistent renormalization of the gap and the energy scale. Within the self-consistent approximation considered here, the corrections present a complex evolution as a function of $V$. We discuss the one-loop corrections in comparison with the spectrum observed experimentally in K$_{2}$Co(SeO$_{3}$)$_{2}$.

Title: Quasi-amorphous crystal
Authors: Oguz Umut Salman, Aylin Ahadi, Lev Truskinovsky
Abstract: Brittle plastic yielding is a salient feature of well-annealed glassy materials. Here we show that the same behavior is characteristic of perfect crystals after they experience mechanically driven elastic instability leading to massive nucleation of dislocations. We argue that such 'preparation' effectively converts an atomic configuration from crystalline to quasi-amorphous. To understand the nature of the subsequent mechanical response, which is reminiscent of quasi-brittle yielding we study an athermal model 2D crystal subjected to quasistatic loading. We show that the intermittent pre- and post-yield dislocation avalanches exhibit power law statistics with matching exponents. The computed value of these exponents is indicative of marginal stability.

Abstract: Recent advances in the manipulation of complex oxide layers, particularly the fabrication of atomically thin cuprate superconducting films via molecular beam epitaxy, have revealed new ways in which nanoscale engineering can govern superconductivity and its interwoven electronic orders. In parallel, the creation of twisted cuprate heterostructures through cryogenic stacking techniques marks a pivotal step forward, exploiting cuprate superconductors to deepen our understanding of exotic quantum states and propel next-generation quantum technologies. This review explores over three decades of research in the emerging field of cuprate twistronics, examining both experimental breakthroughs and theoretical progress. It also highlights the methodologies poised to surmount the outstanding challenges in leveraging these complex quantum materials, underscoring their potential to expand the frontiers of quantum science and technology.

Title: Ferroelectric Order and Enhanced Interfacial Superconductivity in Lightly-Doped Quantum Paraelectric KTa$_{1-x}$Nb$_x$O$_3$
Authors: F. Yang, L. Q. Chen
Abstract: Ferroelectric quantum criticality in perovskite oxides offers a fertile ground for emergent collective phenomena. Here we develop a first-principles-inspired quantum-statistics-based theoretical analysis of the ferroelectric order and interfacial superconductivity in lightly-doped quantum paraelectric, niobium (Nb)-doped KTaO$_3$. We demonstrate that local distortions induced by the doped Nb atoms beyond its quantum critical composition induce a long-range ferroelectric order. The predicted dielectric properties quantitatively agree with the experimental measurements over the entire temperature range from the symmetry-broken ferroelectric phase across the phase transition to the paraelectric region. As the same soft phonon mode that governs dielectric behavior provides the essential pairing channel for interfacial superconductivity of KTaO$_3$, we predict a pronounced enhancement of this superconductivity on (111) surface when the system is tuned to its quantum-critical composition via Nb doping, providing a concrete avenue for experimental verification. This finding establishes ferroelectric quantum criticality as a unique design principle for engineering enhanced superconductivity and discovering emergent quantum phases in polar oxide heterostructures, explicitly suggesting that similar materials-tuning strategies (e.g., epitaxial strain) could be exploited to enhance superconductivity in quantum paraelectric systems.

Title: Effect of W in Cu-Zr-W thin films: Molecular dynamics simulations and experimental verification
Authors: Hassan Ataalite, Jiri Houska, Deepika Thakur, Michaela Cervena, Petr Zeman
Abstract: We investigate the effects of W incorporation into Cu-Zr thin film metallic glasses using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations combined with magnetron sputtering. All studies are carried out in the whole range of W concentrations (0 to 100 at. %) and the MD studies also in a wide range of incident energies (1 to 500 eV) and deposition angles (0 to 60°). Calculated X-ray diffractograms, packing factor, short-range order (bonding fractions and coordination numbers), medium-range order (network ring and common neighbor statistics) and stress are correlated with measured X-ray diffractograms and properties (hardness, hardness/Young's modulus ratio and elastic recovery). The simulations explain the experimental results at the atomic level and provide a lot of information that is not available experimentally. Special attention is paid to non-monotonic dependencies on the elemental composition and incident energy. Collectively, the results explain the role of W in modifying the structure and improving the mechanical performance of Cu-Zr metallic glasses, predict optimum compositions which maximize some of the mechanical properties, and contribute to the development of advanced materials for various applications.

Title: Sliding properties of Transition Metal Dichalcogenide bilayers
Authors: Pier Luigi Silvestrelli, S. Subashchandrabose, Alberto Ambrosetti, Maria Clelia Righi
Abstract: Transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are valuable as solid lubricants because of their layered structure, which allows for easy shearing along the basal planes. Using Density Functional Theory (DFT) we conducted a first-principles study of the sliding properties of several TMD bilayers: MoS$_2$, MoTe$_2$, WS$_2$, WSe$_2$, VS$_2$, VSe$_2$, TaS$_2$, TaSe$_2$, TiS$_2$, TiSe$_2$, HfS$_2$, ZrS$_2$, MoS$_2$WS$_2$, MoS$_2$VS$_2$. Given the crucial role of van der Waals (vdW) interactions in accurately describing the interlayer interactions in TMD bilayers, we employed vdW-corrected DFT functionals. Our research confirms the dominance of vdW effects by estimating the fraction of interlayer binding energy attributable to these interactions. We also examined how the choice of different vdW-corrected DFT functionals might influence quantitative results. Using MoS$_2$ as a reference TMD bilayer system, we found that most other TMD bilayers studied exhibit stronger interlayer bonds and greater corrugation. However, TiSe$_2$ shows a profile similar to MoS$_2$, while, interestingly, TiS$_2$, VS$_2$, and ZrS$_2$ are characterized by weaker bonding and lower corrugation than MoS$_2$. We explored relationships between various properties of TMD bilayers, with a particular focus on potential connections between tribological and electronic properties often characteristic of solid interfaces. To this end, we evaluated adhesion energies, work of separation, charge density redistributions in interface regions, differential charge densities, and corrugation. While corrugation and thus resistance to sliding generally tends to increase with the size of the chalcogen element and is typically proportional to the adhesion energy, the relationships between other structural, energetic, and electronic properties do not follow a single, well-defined trend.

Title: Machine-learning interatomic potential for AlN for epitaxial simulation
Authors: Nicholas Taormina, Emir Bilgili, Jason Gibson, Richard Hennig, Simon Phillpot, Youping Chen
Abstract: A machine learned interatomic potential for AlN was developed using the ultra-fast force field (UF3) methodology. A strong agreement with density functional theory calculations in predicting key structural and mechanical properties, including lattice constants, elastic constants, cohesive energy, and surface energies has been demonstrated. The potential was also shown to accurately reproduce the experimentally observed atomic core structure of edge dislocations. Most significantly, it reproduced the experimentally observed wurtzite crystal structure in the overlayer during homoepitaxial growth of AlN on wurtzite AlN, something that prior potentials failed to achieve. Additionally, the potential reproduced the experimentally observed layer-by-layer growth mode in the epilayer. The combination of accuracy, transferability, and computational speed afforded by the UF3 framework thus makes large-scale, atomistic simulations of epitaxial growth of AlN feasible.

Title: Cooling of electrons via superconducting tunnel junctions and their arrays exhibiting nodal lines
Authors: Linus Aliani, Viktoriia Kornich
Abstract: We study theoretically a process of cooling electrons using a superconducting tunnel junction with a $\pi$ phase difference and a usual insulator or a ferroelectric in-between, and an array of such junctions with ferroelectric layers in-between. These setups have a complex structure of entropy due to nodal lines, where the density of states can be divergent or larger than for a free electron gas at a chemical potential level. We consider a small current running from the bath of electrons through the setup, where electrons have to have higher entropy, and thus remove heat from the bath.

Title: Revealing the Hidden Third Dimension of Point Defects in Two-Dimensional MXenes
Authors: Grace Guinan, Michelle A. Smeaton, Brian C. Wyatt, Steven Goldy, Hilary Egan, Andrew Glaws, Garritt J. Tucker, Babak Anasori, Steven R. Spurgeon
Abstract: Point defects govern many important functional properties of two-dimensional (2D) materials. However, resolving the three-dimensional (3D) arrangement of these defects in multi-layer 2D materials remains a fundamental challenge, hindering rational defect engineering. Here, we overcome this limitation using an artificial intelligence-guided electron microscopy workflow to map the 3D topology and clustering of atomic vacancies in Ti$_3$C$_2$T$_X$ MXene. Our approach reconstructs the 3D coordinates of vacancies across hundreds of thousands of lattice sites, generating robust statistical insight into their distribution that can be correlated with specific synthesis pathways. This large-scale data enables us to classify a hierarchy of defect structures--from isolated vacancies to nanopores--revealing their preferred formation and interaction mechanisms, as corroborated by molecular dynamics simulations. This work provides a generalizable framework for understanding and ultimately controlling point defects across large volumes, paving the way for the rational design of defect-engineered functional 2D materials.

Title: D-Wave Phonon Angular Momentum Texture in Altermagnets by Magnon-Phonon-Hybridization
Authors: Hannah Bendin, Alexander Mook, Ingrid Mertig, Robin R. Neumann
Abstract: In altermagnets, the magnon bands are anisotropically spin-split in reciprocal space without relativistic or dipolar spin-spin interactions. In this work, we theoretically study magnons and phonons coupled by spin-lattice interaction in a two-dimensional square-lattice $d$-wave altermagnet. We show that phonon-chirality-selective magnon-phonon hybridization can be caused by interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction leading to the emergence of hybrid quasiparticles that possess finite phonon angular momentum. These hybrid quasiparticles are called magnon polarons and consist of spin-polarized magnons and chiral phonons. Their phonon angular momentum texture follows the $d$-wave character of the magnon spin texture opening up the possibility of phononic counterparts to the electronic response effects in altermagnets, such as a \emph{phonon angular momentum splitter effect}, i.e., the generation of a transverse phonon angular momentum current induced by a temperature gradient -- the bosonic analogue of the spin-splitter effect.

Title: Identification of Empirical Constitutive Models for Age-Hardenable Aluminium Alloy and High-Chromium Martensitic Steel Using Symbolic Regression
Authors: Evgeniya Kabliman, Gabriel Kronberger
Abstract: Process-structure-property relationships are fundamental in materials science and engineering and are key to the development of new and improved materials. Symbolic regression serves as a powerful tool for uncovering mathematical models that describe these relationships. It can automatically generate equations to predict material behaviour under specific manufacturing conditions and optimize performance characteristics such as strength and elasticity. The present work illustrates how symbolic regression can derive constitutive models that describe the behaviour of various metallic alloys during plastic deformation. Constitutive modelling is a mathematical framework for understanding the relationship between stress and strain in materials under different loading conditions. In this study, two materials (age-hardenable aluminium alloy and high-chromium martensitic steel) and two different testing methods (compression and tension) are considered to obtain the required stress-strain data. The results highlight the benefits of using symbolic regression while also discussing potential challenges.

Title: Critical temperatures of two dimensional magnets beyond linear spin wave theory: application to CrI$_3$, MPS$_3$ (M=Ni, Mn, Fe) and CrSBr
Authors: Varun Rajeev Pavizhakumari, Thomas Olsen
Abstract: Magnetic anisotropy is crucial for sustaining long range magnetic order in two-dimensional materials (2D) and must be taken into account by any approximate scheme for calculating critical temperatures. While 2D ferromagnets have received significant attention with regard to predicting Curie temperatures, the treatment of 2D anti-ferromagnetism has largely been restricted to classical approaches, which typically underestimate Néel temperatures. The concept of anti-ferromagnetism can be regarded as a special case of single-$Q$ magnetic order, and for such systems the critical temperature can be calculated from the magnon dispersion using either Holstein-Primakoff (HP) bosonization or Green's function-based Random Phase Approximation (RPA). Here, we study the effects of single-ion anisotropy in general single-$Q$ systems in both the HP and RPA methods. In the case of RPA, we generalize the approach to include the Callen Decoupling (CD) correction, which has previously been shown to yield good agreement with experimental Curie temperatures for 2D ferromagnets. We compare the calculated critical temperatures of CrI$_3$ (uniaxial ferromagnet), MPS$_3$ (M=Ni, Mn, Fe) (uniaxial anti-ferromagnets) and CrSBr (triaxial ferromagnet) monolayers with experimental values and find that the Green's function-based methods are much more reliable than HP and that the CD decoupling appears to be more accurate than RPA if the single-ion anisotropy is large.

Title: Porous-B$_{18}$: An Ideal Topological Semimetal with Symmetry-Enforced Orthogonal Nodal-Line and Nodal-Surface States
Authors: Xiao-jing Gao, Yanfeng Ge, Yan Gao
Abstract: Topological semimetals (TSMs) featuring symmetry-protected band degeneracies have attracted considerable attention due to their exotic quantum properties and potential applications. While nodal line (NL) and nodal surface (NS) semimetals have been extensively studied, the realization of a material where both NL and NS coexist and are intertwined, particularly with an ideal electronic band structure, remains a significant challenge. Here, we predict via first-principles calculations and symmetry analysis a metastable boron allotrope, Porous-B$_{18}$ (space group $P6_3/m$, No.~176), as a pristine TSM hosting a NS and two straight NLs near the Fermi level. The structure, a honeycomb-like porous 3D framework, exhibits excellent dynamical, thermal (stable up to 1000~K), and mechanical stability. Its electronic band structure is remarkably clean: only the highest valence band (HVB) and the lowest conduction band (LCB) cross linearly within a large energy window of 1.84~eV, free from trivial-band interference. The nodal surface lies on the $k_z = \pm \pi$ planes, protected by combined time-reversal symmetry ($T$) and twofold screw-rotational symmetry ($S_{2z}$), yielding a full-plane Kramers-like degeneracy. The two nodal lines along $K$--$H$ and $K'$--$H'$ are protected by inversion and time-reversal symmetries, carry a quantized Berry phase of $\pm \pi$, and connect orthogonally to the nodal surface, forming an intertwined nodal network. Drumhead surface states on the $(1\bar{1}0)$ surface further confirm the nontrivial topology. Porous-B$_{18}$ thus provides an ideal platform for investigating the interplay between nodal-line and nodal-surface fermions and exploring novel quantum transport phenomena.

Title: Synergetic Enhancement on Bulk and Grain Boundary Ionic Conduction of Mg Doped High-Entropy NASICON-Type Solid Electrolyte for Solid-State Na+ Batteries by Spray Flame Synthesis
Authors: Tianyi Wu, Yiyang Zhang, Zhu Fang, Shuting Lei, Xing Jin, Shuiqing Li
Abstract: All-solid-state sodium batteries represent a promising next-generation energy storage technology, owing to cost-effectiveness and enhanced safety. Among solid electrolytes for solid-state sodium batteries, NASICON-structured Na3Zr2Si2PO12 has emerged as a predominant candidate. However, its widespread implementation remains limited by suboptimal ionic conductivity in both bulk and grain boundary regions. In this study, we demonstrate a novel approach utilizing swirling spray flame synthesis to produce Mg-doped NASICON solid electrolyte nanoparticles. This method facilitates efficient doping and homogeneous mixing for scalable production, resulting in core-shell non-NASICON structures with nano-scale high-entropy mixing. Notably, the atomic migration distances achieved by flame synthesis are significantly reduced compared to conventional solid-state reactions, thereby enabling reactive sintering to preserve high sinterability of nanoparticles during post-treatment processes. High-temperature sintering yields dense NASICON-structured solid electrolytes. Among those, Mg0.25NZSP exhibits an optimal ionic conductivity of 1.91 mS/cm at room temperature and an activation energy of 0.200 eV. The enhancement mechanism can be attributed to incorporation into the NASICON phase and formation of a secondary phase. The low-melting-point secondary phase significantly improves grain boundary contact to enhance grain boundary conductivity. The process achieves simultaneous enhancement of both bulk and grain boundary conduction through a single-step procedure. Comparative analysis of sintering temperatures and ionic conductivities among NASICON solid electrolytes synthesized via different methods demonstrates flame-synthesized nanoparticles offer superior performance and reduced post-treatment costs, owing to their exceptional nano-scale sinterability and uniform elemental distribution.

Abstract: Soft lubricated contacts exhibit complex interfacial behaviours governed by the coupled effects of multiscale surface roughness and non-linear fluid-solid interactions. Accurately capturing this interplay across thin-film flows is challenging due to the strong synergy between contact mechanics and hydrodynamic flow, spanning over various spatiotemporal scales. Here, we develop a rigorous computational framework to simulate the frictional behaviour of soft lubricated interfaces; its modularity and the use of optimal solvers provides solutions for realistic configurations in lubrication regimes ranging from direct solid contact to complete fluid separation. Surface roughness is described via Persson's statistical theory as well as a deterministic Conjugate Gradient with Fast Fourier Transform (CG-FFT) approach, while limitations associated with classical half-space models are addressed by developing the Reduced Stiffness Method (RSM) to rigorously model pressure-induced surface responses. The integrated framework captures the full evolution of frictional behaviour, validated against experiments on rough elastomer-glass interfaces, revealing how surface roughness and material compliance together drive the transition from solid contact to fluid-mediated sliding. The developed approach establishes a robust and versatile simulation tool for analysing a plethora of soft interfacial systems shaped by fluid-solid interactions, with potential applications including but not limited to biomechanics, soft robotics and microfluidic systems.

Title: Kinetic Inductance of Few-Layer NbSe$_2$ in the Two-Dimensional Limit

Niedzielski, Kyle Serniak, Mollie E. Schwartz, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Philip Kim, Riccardo Comin, Jeffrey A. Grover, Terry P. Orlando, Pablo Jarillo-Herrero, William D. Oliver
Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) superconductors remain superconducting down to the monolayer limit, enabling the exploration of emergent physical phenomena and functionality driven by reduced dimensionality. Here, we report the characterization of the kinetic inductance of atomically thin NbSe$_2$, a two-dimensional van der Waals superconductor, using superconducting coplanar waveguides and microwave measurement techniques familiar to circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED). The kinetic inductance scales inversely with the number of NbSe$_2$ layers, reaching 1.2 nH/$\Box$ in the monolayer limit. Furthermore, the measured kinetic inductance exhibits a thickness-dependent crossover from clean- to dirty-limit behavior, with enhanced dirty-limit contributions emerging in the ultra-thin regime. These effects are likely driven by increased surface scattering, multi-band superconductivity, and geometric confinement. Additionally, the self-Kerr nonlinearity of the NbSe$_2$ films ranges from $K/2\pi$ = -0.008 to -14.7 Hz/photon, indicating its strong potential in applications requiring compact, nearly linear, high-inductance superconducting quantum devices and detectors. The fabrication and characterization techniques demonstrated here are extensible to the investigation of other two-dimensional superconductors.

Title: Phase behaviour and dynamical features of a two-dimensional binary mixture of active/passive spherical particles
Authors: Diego Rogel Rodriguez, Francisco Alarcon, Raul Martinez, Jorge Ramirez, Chantal Valeriani
Abstract: In this work we have characterized the phase behaviour and the dynamics of bidimensional mixtures of active and passive Brownian particles. We have evaluated state diagrams at several concentrations of the passive components finding that, while passive agents tend to hinder phase separation, active agents force crystal-like structures on passive colloids. In order to study how passive particles affect the dynamics of the mixture, we have computed the long-time diffusion coefficient of each species, concluding that active particles induce activity and super-diffusive behaviour on passive ones. Interestingly, at the density at which the system enters a MIPS state the active particles' diffusivity shows an inflection point and the passive particles' one goes through a maximum, due to the change in the dynamics of the active components, as shown in the displacement's probability distribution function.

Title: Polarization Controlled Supercurrent in Ferroelectric Josephson Junction
Authors: Yaozu Tang, Mazhar N. Ali, Gerrit E. W. Bauer, Yaroslav M. Blanter
Abstract: Josephson junctions are essential devices in superconducting electronics and quantum computing hardware. Here we predict electrical control of the supercurrent in composite superconductor-insulator-ferroelectric-insulator-superconductor (S-I-FE-I-S) Josephson junctions. Inversion symmetry broken by unequal dielectric barrier thicknesses and/or potentials converts ferroelectric polarization reversal into a substantial change of the critical current. With a WKB tunneling model we obtain non-volatile switching of the critical current with on-off efficiency up to 0.9 for physically realistic parameters. This can be achieved by optimizing the thicknesses and potential barriers of the insulating layers, as well as the thickness and dielectric constant of the ferroelectric layer. We also derive a compact linear expression for the critical current valid for small polarizations. Our results identify ferroelectric Josephson junctions as electrically programmable superconducting current switches for cryogenic memory and logic applications.

Title: Microscopy of cavity-induced density-wave ordering in ultracold gases
Authors: Tabea Bühler, Aurélien Fabre, Gaia Bolognini, Zeyang Xue, Timo Zwettler, Giulia Del Pace, Jean-Philippe Brantut
Abstract: We demonstrate high-resolution in-situ imaging of density-wave ordering induced by cavity-mediated interactions in a unitary Fermi gas. We observe long-range spatial correlations throughout the formation of density waves, both for adiabatic preparation and following a quench, with a pattern controlled by the cavity mode structure. Our single-shot microscopic images together with the real-time readout of the cavity photons provide access to atom-photon correlations. We use this capability to investigate order fluctuations as a function of time following a quench and to directly confirm the correspondence between optical and atomic observables. Our system opens rich perspectives, from local patterning to correlation measurements in long-range interacting quantum gases.

Title: Interband pairing as the origin of the sublattice dichotomy in monolayer FeSe/SrTiO_3
Authors: Zhipeng Xu, Shengshan Qin, Kun Jiang, Jiangping Hu
Abstract: Sublattice dichotomy in monolayer FeSe/SrTiO$_3$, signaling the breaking of symmetries exchanging the two Fe sublattices, has recently been reported. We propose that interband pairing serves as the origin of this di- chotomy, regardless of whether the symmetry is broken in the normal state or in the pairing state. If symmetry breaking occurs in the normal state, the Fermi surfaces are sublattice-polarized, and the intersublattice d-wave pairing naturally acts as interband pairing, reproducing the observed dichotomy in the spectra. Alternatively, if symmetry breaking takes place in the pairing state, it manifests as the coexistence of intraband and interband pairing, with the constraint that interband pairings share the same sign while intraband pairings carry opposite signs. In both cases, interband pairing is indispensable, establishing it as a key ingredient for understanding superconductivity in monolayer FeSe/SrTiO$_3$.

Title: The Role of Elastic Anisotropy in Active Nematics
Authors: Alexander J. H. Houston
Abstract: We analyse the effect of anisotropy in elastic constants on the hydrodynamics of active nematics. Building on the multipole framework for a single elastic constant, we determine the leading effect of elastic anisotropy on the active response of generic distortions. The key findings are a new active torque, proportional to the anisotropy, in response to monopole distortions, and modifications to the propulsion of dipoles in both the direction of motion and changes in speed of up to 50\%. For point defects in two dimensions we find that, despite the large morphological changes in the director field, elastic anisotropy has only a minor impact on their hydrodynamics, with the self-propulsion speed of $+1/2$ defects lowered by less than 5\%. Finally, we determine the elastic torques exerted on defect pairs due to elastic anisotropy.

Title: Low-Field Ferroelectricity in 10 nm AlBScN Thin Films
Authors: Xiaolei Tong, Pedram Yousefian, Ziyi Wang, Meenakshi A. Saravanan, Rajeev Kumar Rai, Giovanni Esteves, Eric A. Stach, Roy H. Olsson III
Abstract: Ferroelectric aluminum scandium nitride (Al1-xScxN, AlScN) offers CMOS-compatible integration but suffers from high coercive fields and leakage currents that hinder thickness scaling. Further reduction in thickness is essential for low-voltage embedded nonvolatile memory applications. Boron incorporation into AlScN (AlBScN) suppresses leakage current in films down to 40 nm, yet its ferroelectric characteristics in ultrathin films remains unexplored. This letter demonstrates robust ferroelectric switching in 10 nm sputtered AlBScN capacitors with a low coercive field and approximately two orders of magnitude lower leakage than AlScN. Notably, ferroelectric switching was observed at 2.2 MV/cm in capacitance-voltage measurements, and symmetric polarization reversal occurred near 4.6 MV/cm in positive-up-negative-down (PUND) measurements using 2 {\mu}s pulses. Moreover, Weibull analysis revealed a breakdown-to-coercive-field ratio (EBD/Ec) of ~2.2. These findings demonstrated AlBScN as a promising candidate for CMOS back-end-of-line (BEOL) compatible ferroelectric applications with improved energy consumption and reduced leakage current.

Title: Information Thermodynamics in a Quantum Dot Szilard Engine - Experimentally Investigating Fluctuation Theorems and Thermodynamic Uncertainty Relations
Authors: David Barker, Sebastian Lehmann, Kimberly A. Dick, Peter Samuelsson, Ville Maisi, Patrick P. Potts
Abstract: In Szilard's engine, measurement and feedback allows to extract work from an equilibrium environment, a process otherwise forbidden by the laws of thermodynamics. Recent theoretical developments have established fluctuation theorems and thermodynamic uncertainty relations that constrain the fluctuations in Szilard's engine. These relations rely on auxiliary experimental protocols known as backward experiments. Here, we experimentally investigate the thermodynamics of Szilard's engine by implementing two distinct types of backward experiments. We verify and compare the corresponding fluctuation theorems and thermodynamic uncertainty relations associated with each protocol. Our results reveal that the entropy production inferable from measurement may serve as a more relevant quantifier of information than the widely used mutual information.

Title: Steady-states and response functions of the periodically driven O(N) scalar field theory
Authors: Oriana K. Diessel, Subir Sachdev, Pietro M. Bonetti
Abstract: We investigate the phase diagram of a relativistic, parametrically driven O($N$)-symmetric theory coupled to a Markovian thermal bath. Our analysis reveals a rich variety of phases, including both uniform and spatially modulated symmetry-broken states, some of which feature an order parameter oscillating at half the drive frequency. When coupled to a background electromagnetic potential, these phases exhibit a Meissner effect, in the sense that the photon acquires a mass term. However, if the order parameter oscillates around a sufficiently small value, a fraction of an externally applied magnetic field can penetrate the sample in the form of a standing wave. We dub this property a \textit{Meissner polariton}, that is, a collective mode resulting from the hybridization of light with order parameter oscillations. Furthermore, near the onset of symmetry breaking, strong fluctuations give rise to a superconducting-like response even in the absence of a Meissner effect or of a Meissner polariton. Our results are relevant to experiments on light-induced orders, particularly superconductivity.

Title: Comment on CFT in AdS and boundary RG flows: O(1/N) Result
Authors: Kaoru Ohno, Yutaka Okabe
Abstract: In a recent paper [JHEP 11 (2020) 118], S. Giombi and H. Khanchandani studied the 1/N expansion of the O(N) model in semi-infinite space within the framework of conformal field theory in anti-de Sitter space. They presented a series expansion for the O(1/N) correction to the boundary anomalous dimension in the case of the ordinary transition. Although they were unable to sum the series or simplify its form analytically, they demonstrated numerically that their result matches our earlier, simple analytic expression given in Prog. Theor. Phys. 70 (1983) 1226. In this paper, we show that their series expansion is in fact exactly equivalent to our original expression. However, since the final formula in eq. (4.57) of their paper, which is expressed in terms of two different 3F2 functions, cannot produce the correct values, we derive the correct formulae involving two 3F2 functions in the Appendices. We comment on the similarity and difference between their analysis and ours in the cases of the ordinary and special transitions, and present full details of deriving the anomalous dimension for all the cases including the extraordinary transition, which were not written in our earlier paper.

Title: Analytically Optimising Muon Diffusion Experiments with Fisher information
Authors: Alex Sampson, Peter J. Baker, Lucas Wilkins, John M. Wilkinson
Abstract: One of the key challenges in performing muon experiments is knowing which temperatures and applied fields to measure at, and how many muon decays should be measured at each temperature/field combination to get the most useful dataset. We have developed a technique using Fisher information which, for a given muon asymmetry function, can analytically calculate the number of muon decays required to obtain a given error on the parameters of the asymmetry model. Here, we report on the results of our project, in particular applying our methodology to the problem of knowing the best choice of applied longitudinal fields for ionic diffusion experiments.

Title: Wave-crests around obstacles in odd viscous liquids
Authors: E. Kirkinis, A. Levchenko
Abstract: The values of liquid odd-viscosity coefficients remain largely unknown, with only a single experimental measurement reported to date [Nature Physics 15, 1188 (2019)]. In this work, inspired by the well-known consequences of dispersion surfaces in classical liquids from the work of Lighthill, we theoretically determine the shapes of constant-phase wave crests formed around obstacles moving at constant velocity in two- and three-dimensional odd viscous liquids, which may or may not undergo rigid rotation. From this analysis, we derive parametric relations that the odd-viscosity coefficients must satisfy, providing a framework for their experimental determination.

Title: Emergent Decoherence Dynamics in Doubly Disordered Spin Networks
Authors: Cooper M. Selco, Christian Bengs, Chaitali Shah, Zhuorui Zhang, Ashok Ajoy
Abstract: Elucidating the emergence of irreversible macroscopic laws from reversible quantum many-body dynamics is a question of broad importance across all quantum science. Many-body decoherence plays a key role in this transition, yet connecting microscopic dynamics to emergent macroscopic behavior remains challenging. Here, in a doubly disordered electron-nuclear spin network, we uncover an emergent decoherence law for nuclear polarization, $e^{-\sqrt{R_{p}t}}e^{-R_{d}t}$, that is robust across broad parameter regimes. We trace its microscopic origins to two interdependent decoherence channels: long-range interactions mediated by the electron network and spin transport within the nuclear network exhibiting anomalous, sub-diffusive dynamics. We demonstrate the capacity to control--and even eliminate--either channel individually through a combination of Floquet engineering and (optical) environment modulation. We find that disorder, typically viewed as detrimental, here proves protective, generating isolated electron-free clusters that localize polarization and prolong coherence lifetimes. These findings establish a microscopic framework for manipulating decoherence pathways and suggests engineered disorder as a new design principle for realizing long-lived quantum memories and sensors.

Title: Deep generative priors for robust and efficient electron ptychography
Authors: Arthur R. C. McCray, Stephanie M. Ribet, Georgios Varnavides, Colin Ophus
Abstract: Electron ptychography enables dose-efficient atomic-resolution imaging, but conventional reconstruction algorithms suffer from noise sensitivity, slow convergence, and extensive manual hyperparameter tuning for regularization, especially in three-dimensional multislice reconstructions. We introduce a deep generative prior (DGP) framework for electron ptychography that uses the implicit regularization of convolutional neural networks to address these challenges. Two DGPs parameterize the complex-valued sample and probe within an automatic-differentiation mixed-state multislice forward model. Compared to pixel-based reconstructions, DGPs offer four key advantages: (i) greater noise robustness and improved information limits at low dose; (ii) markedly faster convergence, especially at low spatial frequencies; (iii) improved depth regularization; and (iv) minimal user-specified regularization. The DGP framework promotes spatial coherence and suppresses high-frequency noise without extensive tuning, and a pre-training strategy stabilizes reconstructions. Our results establish DGP-enabled ptychography as a robust approach that reduces expertise barriers and computational cost, delivering robust, high-resolution imaging across diverse materials and biological systems.

Title: Silicon-photonic optomechanical magnetometer
Authors: Fernando Gottardo, Banjamin J. Carey, Nathaniel Bawden, Glen I. Harris, Hamish Greenall, Erick Romero, Douglas Bulla, James S. Bennett, Scott Foster, Warwick P. Bowen
Abstract: Optomechanical sensors enable exquisitely sensitive force measurements, with emerging applications across quantum technologies, standards, fundamental science, and engineering. Magnetometry is among the most promising applications, where chip-scale optomechanical sensors offer high sensitivity without the cryogenics or magnetic shielding required by competing technologies. However, lack of compatibility with integrated photonics and electronics has posed a major barrier. Here we introduce silicon-on-insulator optomechanical magnetometers to address this barrier. A new post-release lithography process enables high-quality metallisation of released mechanical structures, overcoming the incompatibility between silicon-on-insulator fabrication and functional magnetic films. This allows us to employ photonic-crystal cavities that enhance motion-to-optical signal transduction by over an order of magnitude. The resulting devices achieve magnetic field sensitivity of 800 pT Hz^-1/2, three orders of magnitude beyond previous waveguide-integrated designs. The advances we report provide a path towards high-performance, room temperature and chip-integrated magnetometers for applications ranging from biomedical imaging and navigation to resource exploration.

Title: Coherence in the Leak and Storage Kurtosis control Ergotropy in Quantum Batteries
Authors: Bitap Raj Thakuria, Trishna Kalita, Manash Jyoti Sarmah, Himangshu Prabal Goswami
Abstract: We introduce a cavity-coupled finite quantum system which can act as a quantum battery by harnessing noise induced coherences. We apply the methodology of full counting statistics to capture higher-order fluctuations of quanta exchange in the storage station. Together with the thermodynamic parameters, the fluctuations constitute a training platform for unsupervised as well as supervised learning models in predicting ergotropy. We identify a minimal predictive feature set from the battery's operating parameters that can classify the ergotropy into different regimes with great this http URL results show that the usual quantum and thermodynamic variables are inadequate for the purpose of identifying high ergotropy regimes in isolation. Rather, it is the kurtosis of quanta exchange in the storage and the noise-induced coherence in the leakage mode that become the dominant quantities in controlling the magnitude of ergotropy.

Title: Mixed-state phase structure of gauge-Higgs subsystem codes under logical-preserving decoherence
Authors: Yoshihito Kuno, Ikuo Ichinose
Abstract: Some of lattice-gauge-theory models, in particular gauge-Higgs model (GHM), can be regarded and work as a subsystem code. This work studies the effect of local-gauge-symmetric decoherence on the GHM from the perspective of the subsystem code. We clarify the global phase diagram of the subsystem code. In particular, the decoherence induces an unconventional critical mixed state, where the logical information is preserved but the rest of the system exhibits mixed state criticality. For a fixed point, the decohered subsystem code is understood by the ``gauging out" prescription. By mapping the GHM to the toric code subject to decoherence, we can understand the properties of the subsystem code. We further discuss and investigate the robustness of the logical space of the subsystem code. Although this kind of subsystem code can be produced by using any bulk mixed state in the GHM, its robustness is a subtle problem due to the mixed critical gauge qubits. We consider some specific unitary for examining the robustness of the stored quantum information. For dynamical unitary perturbations described by interactions between the logical qubit and gauge qubits, the deformation of the subsystem code drastically depends on the initial mixed state of the gauge qubits.

Title: Second-Harmonic Magnetoacoustic Ultrasound from Magnetic Nanoparticles under Radiofrequency Electromagnetic Fields
Authors: R. Marqués-Gómez, J. Melchor, A.C. Moreno Maldonado, C. Marquina, G. Goya, M. R. Ibarra, G. Rus
Abstract: We report experimental evidence of mechanical wave generation by magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) under radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (EMFs, 65mT, 800 kHz, at 100ms bursts) in the ultrasonic (US) frequency range. We developed an experimental setup to detect the second harmonic (SH) signal under isothermal conditions. This SH-US signal was observed only in samples containing MNPs and consequently originated from the EMF interaction on samples containing MNPs. These findings suggest that US generation due to magneto-acoustic interaction in the MNPs could be responsible for the cell damage induced by EMF in cells containing MNPs without increasing the temperature. Experiments performed on magnetically aligned MNP clusters in gelatin significantly enhance the amplitude of the SH signal compared to non-aligned samples. This phenomenon could pave the way for new theoretical and practical approaches as for 'in vivo' magnetoacoustics theragnostic.

Title: Soap Film Drainage Under Tunable Gravity Using a Centrifugal Thin Film Balance
Authors: Antoine Monier, Kévin Gutierrez, Cyrille Claudet, Franck Celestini, Christophe Brouzet, Christophe Raufaste
Abstract: Surface bubbles are an abundant source of aerosols, with important implications for climate processes. In this context, we investigate the stability and thinning dynamics of soap films under effective gravity fields. Experiments are performed using a centrifugal thin-film balance capable of generating accelerations from 0.2 up to 100 times standard gravity, combined with thin-film interferometry to obtain time-resolved thickness maps. Across all experimental conditions, the drainage dynamics are shown to be governed by capillary suction and marginal regeneration-a mechanism in which thick regions of the film are continuously replaced by thin film elements (TFEs) formed at the meniscus. We consistently recover a thickness ratio of 0.8 - 0.9 between the TFEs and the adjacent film, in agreement with previous observations under standard gravity. The measured thinning rates also follow the predicted scaling laws. We identified that gravity has three distinct effects: (i) it induces a strong stretching of the initial film, extending well beyond the linear-elastic regime; (ii) it controls the meniscus size, and thereby the amplitude of the capillary suction and the drainage rate; and (iii) it reveals an inertia-to-viscous transition in the motion of TFEs within the film. These results are supported by theoretical modeling and highlight the robustness of marginal regeneration and capillary-driven drainage under extreme gravity conditions.

Title: Geometric Categories for Continuous Gauging
Authors: Devon Stockall, Matthew Yu
Abstract: We present a unified categorical framework which encodes gauging of continuous and finite symmetries in arbitrary spacetime dimension. We show that electric symmetry breaking, resulting from the addition of charged matter, is implemented by this gauging procedure, and identify electric and magnetic symmetries expected in $G$-gauge theory. We work with geometric categories, i.e. categories internal to stacks. This allows us to extend (de)equivariantization of fusion categories to continuous groups, construct a functorial SymTFT and boundaries for this theory, and compute the relevant categories of endomorphisms and Drinfeld centers.

Title: Fidelity sweet spot in transmon qubit rings under strong connectivity noise
Authors: Quan Fu, Xin Wang, Rui Xiong
Abstract: We investigate the fidelity of quantum operations in transmon qubit systems, focusing on both SWAP and general gate operations. Our results reveal a distinct fidelity sweet spot that emerges even under strong noise, indicating that optimal circuit depth can enhance gate performance. We further demonstrate that specific initial states, particularly those with favorable symmetry or entanglement structure, yield higher fidelity, reaching levels compatible with quantum error-correction thresholds. Finally, we introduce a supervised machine-learning framework capable of predicting the positions of fidelity sweet spots, enabling efficient optimization of circuit durations across different device configurations.

Title: Exact Results for the Spectrum of the Ising Conformal Field Theory
Authors: Oleg Antipin, Jahmall Bersini, Jacob Hafjall, Giulia Muco, Francesco Sannino
Abstract: We develop a semiclassical framework to determine scaling dimensions of neutral composite operators in scalar conformal field theories. For the critical Ising $\lambda\phi^4$ theory in $d=4-\epsilon$, we obtain the full spectrum of composite operators built out of $n$ fields transforming in the traceless-symmetric Lorentz representations to next-to-leading order in the double-scaling limit $n\rightarrow \infty$ and $\lambda \rightarrow 0$ with $\lambda n$ fixed. At any given order the semiclassical expansion resums an infinite number of Feynman diagrams. Combining our results with existing perturbative computations further yields the complete five-loop scaling dimensions in the $\epsilon$-expansion for the family of $\phi^n$ operators. Finally, in three dimensions the next-to-leading order semiclassical results supersede any other existing methodology for $n \gtrsim \mathcal{O}(10)$.

Title: Remanent crustal strain on Mars in non-poikilitic olivine of NWA 7721
Authors: Yaozhu Li, Szilvia Kalácska, Phil McCausland, Roberta L. Flemming, Callum Hetherington, Bo Zhao, Can Yildirim, Carsten Detlefs
Abstract: We present a multiscale microstructural analysis of olivine from the non-poikilitic lithology of the poikilitic shergottite NWA 7721, using dark-field X-ray microscopy (DFXM), electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), and context in situ 2D micro-XRD. A single olivine crystal contains two distinct subgrain populations. Type 1 subgrains are fine (1-5 micrometers), randomly oriented, and nearly strain-free, whereas Type 2 subgrains are coarse (greater than 30 micrometers), aligned, and strongly strained. Layered DFXM data reveal slip-band features in Type 2 that are absent in Type 1. We interpret Type 1 as products of shock-induced recrystallization, whereas Type 2 preserves remnants of a highly deformed parent grain. This bimodal microstructure, not observed in other Martian meteorites including the paired NWA 1950 and ALH A77005, points to a heterogeneous response to impact influenced by pre-existing strain in the olivine grain. We propose that NWA 7721 olivine experienced substantial crustal or magmatic stress before impact. The subsequent shock wave imposed a rapid load-release cycle that mobilized dislocations and produced low-angle boundaries in Type 2, while driving recrystallization of Type 1. Grain-growth constraints limit the post-shock heating duration to approximately 2.3 s, consistent with rapid quenching. These results provide the first evidence that non-poikilitic olivine in NWA 7721 preserves dynamic crustal deformation on Mars in the Late Amazonian.

Title: Thermodynamic blocking in self-gravitating systems
Authors: Barnabás Deme, Jean-Baptiste Fouvry
Abstract: Building upon a thermodynamic formalism, we show that self-gravitating systems in hydrostatic equilibrium with a uniform density are maximal entropy states when submitted to perturbations which are slow on dynamical timescale. We coin this phenomenon "thermodynamic blocking", given its similarity with the more general "kinetic blocking". This result underlines the importance of the thermodynamic formalism which proves useful when kinetic equations break down.

Title: Quantum annealing for lattice models with competing long-range interactions
Authors: Jan Alexander Koziol, Kai Phillip Schmidt
Abstract: We use superconducting qubit quantum annealing devices to determine the ground state of Ising models with algebraically decaying competing long-range interactions in the thermodynamic limit. This is enabled by a unit-cell-based optimization scheme, in which the finite optimizations on each unit cell are performed using commercial quantum annealing hardware. To demonstrate the capabilities of the approach, we choose three exemplary problems relevant for other quantum simulation platforms and material science: (i) the calculation of devil's staircases of magnetization plateaux of the long-range Ising model in a longitudinal field on the triangular lattice, motivated by atomic and molecular quantum simulators; (ii) the evaluation of the ground state of the same model on the Kagome lattice in the absence of a field, motivated by artificial spin ice metamaterials; (iii) the study of models with additional few-nearest-neighbor interactions relevant for frustrated Ising compounds with potential long-range interactions. The approach discussed in this work provides a useful and realistic application of existing quantum annealing technology, applicable across many research areas in which lattice problems with resummable long-range interactions are relevant.

Title: Anomaly induced transport from symmetry breaking in holography
Authors: Ashis Tamang, Nishal Rai, Karl Landsteiner, Eugenio Megias
Abstract: We study the transport properties of relativistic fluids induced by quantum anomalies in presence of explicit symmetry breaking. To this end we consider a holographic Einstein-Maxwell model in 5 dimensions with pure gauge and a mixed gauge-gravitational Chern-Simons terms, coupled with a scalar field. To study the chiral vortical effects and the energy transport sector, apart from the chiral magnetic effects, we have considered the full backreaction of the gauge field on the metric. We have studied the anomalous effects by using Kubo formulae involving correlators of the charged currents and the energy current. Our findings reveal that, in the presence of explicit symmetry breaking, anomaly-induced transport phenomena can extend beyond anomalous currents and affect non-anomalous sectors as well. In particular, we find that all the conductivities display a distinct sensitivity to the mass parameter controlling the symmetry breaking, thus reflecting the interplay between anomaly coefficients and explicit symmetry breaking terms. These findings highlight the role played by pure gauge and mixed gauge-gravitational anomalies in holographic transport, and their importance for strongly coupled systems with broken symmetries.

Title: Stacking and the triviality of invertible phases
Authors: Sven Bachmann, Alan Getz, Pieter Naaijkens, Naomi Wray
Abstract: We study the superselection sectors of two quantum lattice systems stacked onto each other in the operator algebraic framework. We show in particular that all irreducible sectors of a stacked system are unitarily equivalent to a product of irreducible sectors of the factors. This naturally leads to a faithful functor between the categories for each system and the category of the stacked system. We construct an intermediate `product' category which we then show is equivalent to the stacked system category. As a consequence, the sectors associated with an invertible state are trivial, namely, invertible states support no anyonic quasi-particles.

Title: Comparison of Two Optimization Methods for a Rydberg Quantum Gate
Authors: Luis S. Yagüe Bosch, Sandro Wimberger
Abstract: A shortcut-to-adiabaticity is compared with a numerically optimized protocol for implementing a high-fidelity quantum gate on Rydberg atoms. The counterdiabatic method offers an analytical framework for accelerating high-fidelity gates by mimicking the time evolution of a counterdiabatic Hamiltonian using fast-oscillating fields. This approach is contrasted with a numerically optimized gate designed using the Boulder Opal platform. The numerically optimized gate achieves higher fidelities while demonstrating robustness against errors similar to that of the effective counterdiabatic gate. The study serves as an example of the performance of analytic shortcut-to-adiabatic-inspired protocols compared to brute-force numerical optimization techniques for state-of-the-art quantum computing platforms. It stresses the important role played by constraints on the optimized pulses in time and in amplitude that are crucial in determining the quality of the optimization method.

Title: Comment on "Role of Matter Interactions in Superradiant Phenomena"
Authors: Max Hörmann, Anja Langheld, Jonas Leibig, Andreas Schellenberger, Kai Phillip Schmidt
Abstract: Recently, Mendonça et al. [arXiv:2503.04961] investigated the Dicke-XXZ model and the Dicke-Ising model. For the latter model, their calculated quantum phase diagram contradicts claims about the existence of an intermediate phase with superradiant and antiferromagnetic order and the change in order of some phase transition lines, observed in other studies. In this comment we demonstrate that both features are indeed present in the Dicke-Ising model for the investigated parameter range in [arXiv:2503.04961].

Title: Design boosters: from constant-time quantum chaos to $\infty$-designs and beyond
Authors: Soumik Ghosh, Arjun Mirani, Yihui Quek, Michelle Xu
Abstract: We study a counterintuitive property of 'conditioning' on the result of measuring a subsystem of a quantum state: such conditioning can boost design quality, at the cost of increased system size. We work in the setting of deep thermalization from many-body physics: starting from a bipartite state on a global system $(A,B)$ drawn from a $k$-design, we measure system $B$ in the computational basis, keep the outcome and examine the state that remains in system $A$, approximating the overall ensemble (the 'projected ensemble') by a $k'$-design. We ask: how does the design quality change due to this procedure, or how does $k'$ compare to $k$? We give the first rigorous example of unitary dynamics generating a state such that, projection at very early (constant) times can boost design randomness. These dynamics are those of quantum chaos, modeled by the evolution of a Hamiltonian drawn from the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE). We show that, even though a state generated by such dynamics at constant time only forms a $k=\mathcal{O}(1)$ design, the projected ensemble is Haar-random (or a $k'=\infty$ design) in the thermodynamic limit (i.e. when $N_B=\infty$). This phenomenon persists even with weaker and more physically realistic assumptions; our results can be appropriately applied to non-GUE Hamiltonians that nevertheless show likely chaotic signatures in their eigenbases. Moreover, we show that with no assumption on how the global state was generated, a $k$-design experiences a degradation in design quality to $k' = \lfloor k/2 \rfloor$. This improves upon best prior results on the deep thermalization of designs. Together, our contributions argue for design boosting as a result of chaos and showcase a novel mechanism to generate good designs.

Title: Bootstrapping Euclidean Two-point Correlators
Authors: Minjae Cho, Barak Gabai, Henry W. Lin, Jessica Yeh, Zechuan Zheng
Abstract: We develop a bootstrap approach to Euclidean two-point correlators, in the thermal or ground state of quantum mechanical systems. We formulate the problem of bounding the two-point correlator as a semidefinite programming problem, subject to the constraints of reflection positivity, the Heisenberg equations of motion, and the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger condition or ground-state positivity. In the dual formulation, the Heisenberg equations of motion become "inequalities of motion" on the Lagrange multipliers that enforce the constraints. This enables us to derive rigorous bounds on continuous-time two-point correlators using a finite-dimensional semidefinite or polynomial matrix program. We illustrate this method by bootstrapping the two-point correlators of the ungauged one-matrix quantum mechanics, from which we extract the spectrum and matrix elements of the low-lying adjoint states. Along the way, we provide a new derivation of the energy-entropy balance inequality and establish a connection between the high-temperature two-point correlator bootstrap and the matrix integral bootstrap.

Title: Fluctuation amplification engineering in multimode Raman-cavity systems
Authors: H. P. Ojeda Collado, Ludwig Mathey
Abstract: Parametric amplification is a key ingredient of a wide range of phenomena, from the classical to the quantum domain. Although such phenomena have been demonstrated in non-equilibrium settings, their use for fluctuation engineering has been put forth in Raman-cavity hybrids only recently. In this work, we generalize fluctuation engineering to a multi-mode scenario in which multiple Raman-active modes interact nonlinearly with multiple cavity modes. We demonstrate the emergence of resonant and non-resonant collective fluctuations that can be non-reciprocally controlled by engineering the band dispersion of photons and phonons. As an example we show how Raman fluctuations can be selectively attenuated by tuning the photonic bandgap or even nonresonantly amplified, in marked contrast to the single-mode scenario. We also identify a regime in which the amplification of cavity fluctuations in a specific mode is boosted, surpassing a $\sqrt{N}$ scaling with increasing number of $N$ Raman and cavity modes. Our study reveals the key role of multi-mode interactions on fluctuations in nonlinear cavity-matter hybrids. Noise engineering through different photon and phonon dispersions, as demonstrated here, could be leveraged for the design of novel quantum sensing platforms and advanced spectroscopy in the THz regime.

Title: Reconstructed Electronic Structure in 2D vdW 1T-Ta$S_2$ for Quantum Sensing and Information Science
Authors: S. K. Behera, P. C. Ramamurthy
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are a class of two-dimensional (2D) layered materials that exhibit a diverse range of electronic structures, including charge density waves (CDWs) that can lead to insulating, semiconducting, metallic, and even superconducting phases. While the formation of CDWs in these systems has been recognized in early research [Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 156401 (2022); Nat. Phys. 11, 328 (2015)], the underlying mechanisms driving the commensurate CDW (CCDW) phase remain largely unexplored. CCDWs typically originate from factors such as perfect Fermi surface nesting and/or electron-phonon coupling, causing the divergence of the chiral electronic structure. However, in the case of layered 2D TMD materials with CCDW phases, the significance of reconstructed electronic structures resulting from periodic lattice distortions (PLD) and photoemission matrix element effects in the CCDW instability needs to be visualized. This study focuses on computationally accessible CCDW phases in 1T-Ta$S_2$, a prototypical TMD with a rich CDW phase diagram, aiming to understand the origins of CCDW phases. The insights gained from this investigation have the potential to advance the application of 2D materials in next-generation electronics, quantum sensing and information science.

Title: Optical and transport properties of NbN thin films revisited
Authors: Samuel Kern, Pavol Neilinger, Magdaléna Poláčková, Martin Baránek, Tomáš Plecenik, Tomáš Roch, Miroslav Grajcar
Abstract: Highly disordered NbN thin films exhibit promising superconducting and optical properties. Despite extensive study, discrepancies in its basic electronic properties persist. Analysis of the optical conductivity of disordered ultra-thin NbN films, obtained from spectroscopic ellipsometry by standard Drude-Lorentz model, provides inconsistent parameters. We argue that this discrepancy arise from neglecting the presence of quantum corrections to conductivity in the IR range. To resolve this matter, we propose a modification to the Drude-Lorentz model, incorporating quantum corrections. The parameters obtained from the modified model are consistent not only with transport and superconducting measurements but also with ab initio calculations. The revisited values describing conduction electrons, which differ significantly from commonly adopted ones, are the electron relaxation rate $\Gamma\approx1.8~\textrm{eV}/\hbar$, the Fermi velocity $v_F \approx 0.7 \times 10^{6}~\textrm{ms}^{-1}$ and the electron density of states $N(E_F)=2~$states of both spins/eV/$V_{\textrm{f.u.}}$.

Title: Ferromagnetic CrBr$_3$-Induced Graphene Spintronics
Authors: S. K. Behera, P. C. Ramamurthy
Abstract: Our proposed spin valve prototype showcases a sophisticated design featuring a two-dimensional graphene bilayer positioned between layers of ${CrBr}_3$ ferromagnetic insulators. In this model, proximity coupling plays a pivotal role, influencing the magnetization orientations of the graphene layers and significantly impacting the \textit{in-plane} conductivity of the ${CrBr}_3$ layers. In this present work, we position the graphene bilayer between two layers of the ferromagnetic insulator ${CrBr}_3$ to establish this configuration. Using density functional theory, we conduct detailed computations to analyze the electronic structure of this sandwiched system. Our findings reveal a notable finite gap at specific \textit{k}-points, particularly evident in the antiparallel configuration of the magnetizations. This finding represents a significant advancement in spintronics, underscoring the potential of our spin valve prototype to drive innovation in electronic device technologies.

Title: The geometry of jamming algorithms in the random Lorentz gas
Authors: Giampaolo Folena, Patrick Charbonneau, Peter K. Morse, Rafael Díaz Hernández Rojas, Federico Ricci-Tersenghi
Abstract: Deterministic optimization algorithms unequivocally partition a complex energy landscape in inherent structures (ISs) and their respective basins of attraction. Can these basins be defined solely through geometric principles? This question is paramount to understanding hard sphere jamming, a key model of disordered matter. We here address the issue by proposing a geometric class of gradient descent-like algorithms, which we use to study a system in the hard-sphere universality class, the random Lorentz gas. The statistics of the resulting ISs is found to be strictly inherited from those of Poisson-Voronoi tessellations. The landscape roughness is further found to give rise to a hierarchical organization of ISs, which various algorithms explore differently. In particular, greedy and reluctant schemes tend to favor ISs of markedly different densities. The resulting ISs nevertheless robustly exhibit a universal force distribution, thus confirming the geometric nature of the jamming universality class. Along the way, the physical origin of a dynamical Gardner transition is identified.

Title: Nature of quantum criticality in the Ising ferromagnet TbV$_6$Sn$_6$
Authors: Tianxiong Han, R. D. McKenzie, Joanna Blawat, Tyler J. Slade, Bing Li, Y. Lee, D. M. Pajerowski, John Singleton, Paul C. Canfield, Liqin Ke, Ross McDonald, Rebecca Flint, R. J. McQueeney
Abstract: TbV$_6$Sn$_6$ is a topological metal where ferromagnetic Tb ions with strong uniaxial magnetic anisotropy interact with V kagome layers. Inelastic neutron scattering (INS) measurements show that the Tb ions adopt an Ising doublet ground state. Here, we consider whether a transverse magnetic field can drive TbV$_6$Sn$_6$ toward a quantum critical point, providing a rare example of transverse-field Ising criticality in a metallic compound. High-field magnetization measurements reveal a first-order-like spin-reorientation transition at 25.6 T. Our INS-based magnetic model finds that this is caused by an avoided crossing of an excited-state singlet with the ground-state doublet. Surprisingly, our model predicts that quantum critical and tricritical points are accessible within the range of experimentally determined model parameters and may be reached by varying the direction of an applied magnetic field.

Title: Symmetry and Topology of Monitored Quantum Dynamics
Authors: Zhenyu Xiao, Kohei Kawabata
Abstract: The interplay between unitary dynamics and quantum measurements induces diverse phenomena in open quantum systems with no counterparts in closed quantum systems at equilibrium. Here, we generally classify Kraus operators and their effective non-Hermitian dynamical generators, thereby establishing the tenfold classification for symmetry and topology of monitored free fermions. Our classification elucidates the role of topology in measurement-induced phase transitions and identifies potential topological terms in the corresponding nonlinear sigma models. Furthermore, we establish the bulk-boundary correspondence in monitored quantum dynamics: nontrivial topology in spacetime manifests itself as topologically nontrivial steady states and gapless boundary states in Lyapunov spectra, such as Lyapunov zero modes and chiral edge modes, leading to the topologically protected slowdown of dynamical purification.

Using this result, we give a unified derivation of the performance of a wide variety of high-dimensional linear models trained with stochastic gradient descent. This includes high-dimensional linear regression, kernel regression, and linear random feature models. Our results include previously known asymptotics as well as novel ones.

Title: From Light-Cone to Supersonic Propagation of Correlations by Competing Short- and Long-Range Couplings
Authors: Catalin-Mihai Halati, Ameneh Sheikhan, Giovanna Morigi, Corinna Kollath, Simon B. Jäger
Abstract: We investigate the dynamical spreading of correlations in many-body quantum systems with competing short- and global-range couplings. We monitor the non-equilibrium dynamics of the correlations following a quench, showing that for strong short-range couplings the propagation of correlations is dominated at short and intermediate distances by a causal, light-cone, dynamics, resembling the purely short-range quantum systems. However, the interplay of short- and global-range couplings leads to a crossover between space-time regions in which the light-cone persists to regions where a supersonic, distance-independent, spreading of the correlations occurs. We identify the important ingredients needed for capturing the supersonic spreading and demonstrate our findings in systems of interacting bosonic atoms, in which the global range coupling is realized by a coupling to a cavity light field, or atomic long-range interactions, respectively. We show that our results hold in both one and two dimensions and in the presence of dissipation. Furthermore, we characterize the short time power-law scaling of the distance-independent growth of the density-density correlations.

Title: A control variate method for threshold crossing probabilities of plastic deformation driven by transient coloured noise
Authors: Harry L.F. Ip, Charlie Mathey, Laurent Mertz, Jonathan J. Wylie
Abstract: We propose a hybrid method combining partial differential equation (PDE) and Monte Carlo (MC) techniques to obtain efficient estimates of statistics for plastic deformation related to kinematic hardening models driven by transient coloured noise. Our approach employs a control variate strategy inspired by [CPAM, 75 (3), 455-492, 2022] and relies on a class of PDEs with non-standard boundary conditions, which we derive here. The solutions of those PDEs represent the statistics of models driven by transient white noise and are significantly easier to solve than the coloured noise version. Our approach uses a coupling between the white-noise-driven process and the coloured-noise-driven process, yielding a variance-reduced estimator through control variate techniques. We apply our method to threshold-crossing probabilities, which are used as failure criteria known as ultimate and serviceability limit states under non-stationary excitation. Our contribution provides solid grounds for such calculations and is significantly more computationally efficient in terms of variance reduction compared to standard MC simulations.

Title: X-ray particle tracking velocimetry for steady-state rheological characterization: Case study of a complex polymer melt flow in material extrusion additive manufacturing
Authors: Julian Kattinger, Stefan Hiemer, Mike Kornely, Julian Ehrler, Phi-Long Chung, Christian Bonten, Marc Kreutzbruck
Abstract: We introduce X-ray Particle Tracking Velocimetry (XPTV) as a promising method to quantitatively resolve the velocity field and associated rheological information of polymer melt flow within the nozzle of a fused filament fabrication (FFF) printer. Employing tungsten powder as tracer particles embedded within a polymer filament, we investigate melt flow dynamics through an aluminum nozzle in a custom setup comparable to commercial printers. The velocity profiles obtained via XPTV reveal significant deviations from classical Newtonian flow, highlighting complex heterogeneous and non-isothermal behavior within the melt. From these measurements, we determine the local infinitesimal strain rate tensor and correlate flow-induced non-Newtonian effects to spatially varying temperature distributions, reflecting incomplete thermal homogenization within the nozzle. We complement the experiments with computational fluid dynamics simulations of the flow inside the printing nozzle, incorporating filament melting through an enthalpy-porosity formulation and treating the air-polymer melt interface using a two-phase approach. The simulated velocity profiles agree closely with the XPTV measurements across the investigated operating conditions, supporting the experimental interpretation. Our findings demonstrate the capability of XPTV to quantify both velocity fields and rheological properties, underscoring its potential as a tool for investigating opaque polymer melt flows in additive manufacturing, industrial processing, and rheology. To our knowledge, this is the first application of XPTV to polymer melt rheology. It enables measurements that are inaccessible to conventional optical methods.

Title: Two-dimensional Indium Oxide at the Epitaxial Graphene/SiC Interface: Synthesis, Structure, Properties, and Devices

Auker, Ke Wang, Mehmet Z. Baykara, Vincent Meunier, Nabil Bassim, Adri C.T. van Duin, Vincent H. Crespi, Joshua A. Robinson
Abstract: High-quality two-dimensional (2D) dielectrics are crucial for fabricating 2D/3D hybrid vertical electronic devices such as metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) based Schottky diodes and hot electron transistors, the production of which is constrained by the scarcity of bulk layered wide bandgap semiconductors. In this research, we present the synthesis of a new 2D dielectric, monolayer InO2, which differs in stoichiometry from its bulk form, over a large area (>300 um2) by intercalating at the epitaxial graphene (EG)/SiC interface. By adjusting the lateral size of graphene through optical lithography prior to the intercalation, we tune the thickness of InO2 where predominantly (~85%) monolayer InO2 is formed. The preference for monolayer formation of InO2 is explained using ReaxFF reactive molecular dynamics and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Additionally, the band gap of InO2 is calculated to be 4.1 eV, differing from its bulk form (2.7 eV). Furthermore, MOS-based Schottky diode measurements on InO2 intercalated EG/n-SiC demonstrate that the EG/n-SiC junction transforms from ohmic to a Schottky junction upon intercalation, with a barrier height of 0.87 eV and a rectification ratio of ~10^5. These findings introduce a new addition to the 2D dielectric family, showing significant potential for monolayer InO2 to be used as a barrier in vertical electronic devices.

Title: Stacking-orientation and twist-angle control on integer and fractional Chern insulators in moiré rhombohedral graphene

Abstract: Rhombohedral-stacked multilayer graphene aligned with hexagonal boron nitride has emerged as an excellent platform for investigating exotic quantum phenomena arising from the interplay between electron correlations and nontrivial topology. However, the microscopic mechanism governing the emergence of both the integer and fractional Chern insulator states in this system remains an open question. In this work, we systematically investigate the electrical transport properties of RMG/hBN moiré devices with controlled alignment orientations and twist angles. We demonstrate that alignment orientation strongly modulates correlated phenomena in the moiré-proximal regime, while having negligible influence on the formation of integer and fractional Chern insulators in the moiré-distant regime. Instead, the moiré periodicity, tuned by the twist angle, serves as the key parameter controlling the stability of these correlated topological states in the moiré-distant regime. Furthermore, in the moiré-proximal regime of one specific alignment, we observe anomalous Hall effect and a variety of competing phases near {\nu} = 1, including integer Chern insulator states, extended Chern insulator states, and trivial insulators, whose stability is highly sensitive to both the applied displacement electric field and magnetic field. Our results underscore the critical role of stacking-alignment and twist-angle engineering in exploring novel quantum states based on rhombohedral-stacked multilayer graphene moiré systems.

Title: Leveraging high fluence and low pressure for pulsed laser deposition of high-mobility $γ$-Al$_2$O$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ heterostructure growth
Authors: Thor Hvid-Olsen, Christina Hoegfeldt, Amit Chanda, Alessandro Palliotto, Dae-Sung Park, Thomas Sand Jespersen, Felix Trier
Abstract: High-mobility oxide heterostructures could be applied for high-frequency devices, transparent conductors, and spin-orbit logic devices. SrTiO$_3$ is one of the most studied oxide substrate materials for heterostructures. To date, the highest SrTiO3-based charge carrier mobility at 2 K was measured in the interfacial 2-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) of $\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$/SrTiO$_3$. The formation mechanism and origin of the high electron mobility are not yet fully understood. This investigation presents a successful growth protocol to synthesise high mobility $\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interfaces, and a description of the underlying growth optimisation. Furthermore, indicative features of high-mobility $\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$/SrTiO$_3$, including the room-temperature sheet resistance, are presented. Signs of epitaxial and crystalline growth are found in a high-mobility sample ($\mu^{10K} = 1.6 \times 10^4 \mathrm{cm}^2/\mathrm{Vs}$). Outlining the growth mechanisms and comparing 40 samples, indicates that high-fluence ($F > 3\mathrm{J}/\mathrm{cm}^2$) and low pressure ($P \approx 1 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{mbar}$) are essential growth parameters for high-mobility $\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interfaces. $\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$ having single-element cations allows higher laser fluences during growth, compared to thin films with multi-element cations such as LaAlO$_3$, without causing stoichiometric imbalances.

Title: Quantum transport in nitrogen-doped nanoporous graphenes
Authors: Gaetano Calogero, Isaac Alcón, Alan E. Anaya Morales, Nick Papior, Pol Febrer, Aron W. Cummings, Miguel Pruneda, Stephan Roche, Mads Brandbyge
Abstract: Bottom-up on-surface synthesized nanoporous graphenes (NPGs), realized as 2D arrays of laterally covalently bonded $\pi$-conjugated graphene nanoribbons (GNRs), are a family of carbon nanomaterials that are receiving increasing attention for nanoelectronics and biosensing. Recently, a so-called hybrid-NPG (hNPG) is synthesized, featuring an alternating sequence of doped and non-doped GNRs, resulting in a band staggering effect in its electronic structure. Such a feature is appealing for photo-catalysis, photovoltaics and even carbon nanocircuitry. However, to date, little is known about the transport properties of hNPG and its derivatives, which is key for most applications. Here, via Green's functions simulations, the quantum transport properties of hNPGs are studied. It is found that injected carriers in hNPG spread laterally through a number of GNRs, though such spreading may take place exclusively through GNRs of one type (doped or non-doped). A simple model is proposed to discern the key parameters determining the electronic propagation in hNPGs and explore alternative hNPG designs to control the spreading/confinement and anisotropy of charge transport in these systems. For one such design, it is found that it is possible to send directed electric signals with sub-nanometer precision for as long as one micrometer - a result first reported for any NPG.

Title: A time-reversal invariant vortex in topological superconductors and gravitational $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topology
Authors: Kazuki Yamamoto, Naoto Kan, Hidenori Fukaya
Abstract: We study a time-reversal invariant vortex, namely a spin vortex, in helical superconductors by focusing on its emergent gravitational structure. The topology of the time-reversal invariant vortex is classified by a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant: helical Majorana zero modes appear at the vortex core when the winding number is odd, while no such zero modes exist when it is even. We provide a formal mapping to the theory of gravity to describe this $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological structure. Identifying a superconducting order parameter as a vielbein in the theory of gravity, we explicitly convert the Bogoliubov-de-Genne Hamiltonian into the Dirac Hamiltonian coupled to a nontrivial gravitational field. Then we find that a gravitational curvature is induced at the vortex core, with its total flux quantized in integer multiples of $\pi$, reflecting the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topology. Although the curvature vanishes everywhere except at the vortex core, the energy spectrum remains sensitive to the total curvature flux, owing to the gravitational Aharonov-Bohm effect. We further demonstrate that our gravitational framework can be applied to the topological phase transition driven by the vortex-linking precess in three- dimensional helical superconductors such as the He-B phase.

Title: Three-dimensional spinless Euler insulators with rotational symmetry
Authors: Manabu Sato, Shingo Kobayashi, Motoaki Hirayama, Akira Furusaki
Abstract: The Euler class is a $\mathbb{Z}$-valued topological invariant that characterizes a pair of real bands in a two-dimensional Brillouin zone. One of the symmetries that permits its definition is $C_{2z}T$, where $C_{2z}$ denotes a twofold rotation about the $z$ axis and $T$ denotes time-reversal symmetry. Here, we study three-dimensional spinless insulators characterized by the Euler class, focusing on the case where additional $C_{4z}$ or $C_{6z}$ rotational symmetry is present, and investigate the relationship between the Euler class of the occupied bands and their rotation eigenvalues. We first consider two-dimensional systems and clarify the transformation rules for the real Berry connection and curvature under point group operations, using the corresponding sewing matrices. Applying these rules to $C_{4z}$ and $C_{6z}$ operations, we obtain explicit formulas that relate the Euler class to the rotation eigenvalues at high-symmetry points. We then extend our analysis to three-dimensional systems, focusing on the difference in the Euler class between the two $C_{2z}T$-invariant planes. We derive analytic expressions that relate the difference in the Euler class to two types of representation-protected invariants and analyze their phase transitions. We further construct tight-binding models and perform numerical calculations to support our analysis and elucidate the bulk-boundary correspondence.

Title: Generalized symmetry enriched criticality in (3+1)d
Authors: Benjamin Moy
Abstract: We construct two classes of continuous phase transitions in 3+1 dimensions between gapped phases that break distinct generalized global symmetries. Our analysis focuses on $SU(N)/\mathbb{Z}_N$ gauge theory coupled to $N_f$ flavors of Majorana fermions in the adjoint representation. For $N$ even and sufficiently large odd $N_f$, upon imposing time-reversal symmetry and an $SO(N_f)$ flavor symmetry, the massless theory realizes a quantum critical point between a gapped phase in which a $\mathbb{Z}_N$ one-form symmetry is completely broken and a phase where it is broken to $\mathbb{Z}_2$, leading to $\mathbb{Z}_{N/2}$ topological order. We characterize the possible patterns of symmetry fractionalization in these phases and provide an explicit lattice model that exhibits the transition. The critical point has an enhanced symmetry, which includes non-invertible analogues of time-reversal symmetry. Enforcing a non-invertible time-reversal symmetry and the $SO(N_f)$ flavor symmetry, for $N$ and $N_f$ both odd, we demonstrate that this critical point can appear between a topologically ordered phase and a phase that spontaneously breaks the non-invertible time-reversal symmetry, furnishing an analogue of deconfined quantum criticality for generalized symmetries.

Title: Proximity-induced flat bands and topological properties in a decorated diamond chain
Authors: K Shivanand Thakur, Vihodi Theuno, Amrita Mukherjee, Biplab Pal
Abstract: In the present study, we propose a unique scheme to generate and control multiple flat bands in a decorated diamond chain by using a strain-induced proximity effect between the diagonal sites of each diamond plaquette. This is in complete contrast to the conventional diamond chain, in which the interplay between the lattice topology and an external magnetic flux leads to an extreme localization of the single-particle states, producing the flat bands in the energy spectrum. Such a strain-induced proximity effect will enable us to systematically control one of the diagonal hoppings in the decorated diamond chain, which will lead to the formation of both gapless and gapped flat bands in the energy spectrum. These gapless or gapped flat bands have been corroborated by the computation of the compact localized states amplitude distribution as well as the density of states of the system using a real space calculation. We have also shown that these flat bands are robust against the introduction of small amounts of random onsite disorder in the system. In addition to this, we have also classified the nontrivial topological properties of the system by calculating the winding numbers and edge states for the gapped energy spectrum. These findings could be easily realized experimentally using the laser-induced photonic lattice platforms.

Title: Third-order strong-coupling impurity solver for real-frequency DMFT: Accurate spectral functions for antiferromagnetic and photo-doped states
Authors: Lei Geng, Aaram J. Kim, Philipp Werner
Abstract: We present a real-frequency third-order strong-coupling impurity solver which employs quantics tensor cross interpolation (QTCI) for an efficient evaluation of the diagram weights. Applying the method to dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) calculations of the single-band Hubbard model on the Bethe lattice, we clarify the interaction and temperature range in which the third-order approach yields accurate results. Since the calculations are implemented on the real-time/frequency axis, the detailed structure of spectral functions can be obtained without analytical continuation, as we demonstrate with examples for paramagnetic, antiferromagnetic and photo-doped states. Our work establishes a viable path toward high-order, real-frequency impurity solvers for both equilibrium and non-equilibrium DMFT studies.

Title: On the criticality of the configuration-space statistical geometry
Authors: Yu-Jing Liu, Wen-Yu Su, Yong-Feng Yang, Nvsen Ma, Chen Cheng
Abstract: While phases and phase transitions are conventionally described by local order parameters in real space, we present a unified framework characterizing the phase transition through the geometry of configuration space defined by the statistics of pairwise distances $r_H$ between configurations. Focusing on the concrete example of Ising spins, we establish crucial analytical links between this geometry and fundamental real-space observables, i.e., the magnetization and two-point spin correlation functions. This link unveils the universal scaling law in the configuration space: the standard deviation of the normalized distances exhibits universal criticality as $\sqrt{\mathrm{Var}(r_H)}\sim L^{-2\beta/\nu}$, provided that the system possesses zero magnetization and satisfies $4\beta/\nu < d$. We validate this scaling with stochastic series expansion quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the transverse-field Ising model(TFIM). Furthermore, we propose configuration-space diagnostics that go beyond local real-space observables. First, the distribution probability $P(r_H)$ parameterized by the transverse field $h$ forms a one-dimensional manifold. Information-geometric analyses, particularly the Fisher information defined on this manifold, successfully pinpoint the TFIM phase transition, regardless of the measurement basis. Second, for the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Heisenberg model, a parity index derived from $P(r_H)$ successfully characterizes the symmetry-protected topological phase and its transition. Our work establishes configuration space geometry as a novel perspective on quantum criticality, revealing how macroscopic universal phenomena are encoded within its global statistical features.

Title: Revisiting the access conductance of a nanopore in a charged membrane
Authors: Holly C. M. Baldock, David M. Huang
Abstract: Electric-field-driven electrolyte transport through nanoporous membranes is important for applications including osmotic power generation, sensing and iontronics. We derive an analytical equation in the Debye--Hückel regime and a semi-analytical equation for arbitrary surface potentials for the electric-field-driven electric current through a pore in an ultrathin membrane, which predict scaling with fractional powers of the pore size and Debye length. We show that our theory for arbitrary electric potentials accurately quantifies the ionic conductance through an ultrathin membrane in finite-element method numerical simulations for a wide range of parameters, and generalizes a widely used theory for the access electrical conductance of a membrane nanopore to a broader range of conditions. Our theory predicts that fractional scaling of the ionic conductance with electrolyte concentration at low concentrations is an intrinsic property of charged ultrathin membranes and also occurs for thicker membranes for which the access contribution to the conductance dominates, which could help to explain experimental observations of this widely debated phenomenon.

Title: Electric-Field Control of Josephson Oscillations in Dipolar Bose-Einstein Condensates
Authors: David Galvez-Poblete, Roberto E. Troncoso, Guillermo Romero, Alvaro S. Nunez, Sebastian Allende
Abstract: We study the dynamic behavior of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) with dipolar interactions when the influence of external electric fields affects the coherent tunneling properties. Here, we propose a tunable platform based on BECs where Josephson oscillations can be engineered and modulated through external electric fields. We develop a theoretical and numerical frame-work that reveals how electric fields affect intercondensate tunneling, phase dynamics, and collective excitations. By employing a coupled set of Gross-Pitaevskii equations with adiabatic elimination of excited states, we demonstrate field-induced tuning of Josephson frequencies and a transition from contact to dipole-dominated regimes. These findings corroborate theoretical predictions about the sensitivity of dipolar BECs to external fields and deepen our understanding of quantum coherence and tunneling in long-range interacting quantum systems.

Title: Intrinsic defect intolerance in the ultra-pure metal PtSn$_4$
Authors: Samikshya Sahu, Dong Chen, Niclas Heinsdorf, Ashley N. Warner, Markus Altthaler, Ashutosh K. Singh, Douglas A. Bonn, Sarah A. Burke, Alannah M. Hallas
Abstract: Ultra-pure materials are highly valued as model systems for the study of intrinsic physics. Frequently, however, the crystal growth of such pristine samples requires significant optimization. PtSn$_4$ is a rare example of a material that naturally forms with a very low concentration of crystalline defects. Here, we investigate the origin of its low defect levels using a combination of electrical resistivity measurements, computational modeling, and scanning tunneling microscopy imaging. While typical flux-grown crystals of PtSn$_4$ can have residual resistivity ratios (RRRs) that exceed 1000, we show that even at the most extreme formation speeds, the RRR cannot be suppressed below 100. This aversion to defect formation extends to both the Pt and Sn sublattices, which contribute with equal weight to the conduction properties. Direct local imaging with scanning tunneling microscopy further substantiates the rarity of point defects, while the prohibitive energetic cost of forming a defect is demonstrated through density functional theory calculations. Taken together, our results establish PtSn$_4$ as an intrinsically defect-intolerant material, making it an ideal platform to study other properties of interest, including extreme magnetoresistance and topology.

Title: Ge as an orbitronic platform: giant orbital Hall effect
Authors: James H. Cullen, Zhanning Wang, Dimitrie Culcer
Abstract: State-of-the-art developments in magnetic devices rely on manufacturing faster, more efficient memory elements. A significant development in this direction has been the discovery of orbital torques, which employ the orbital angular momentum of Bloch electrons to switch the magnetisation of an adjacent ferromagnet, and has motivated the search for orbitronic materials displaying strong orbital dynamics exemplified, by the orbital Hall effect (OHE). In this work we propose Ge, as an optimal orbitronic platform. We demonstrate that holes in bulk Ge exhibit a giant OHE, exceeding that of the bulk states of topological insulators, and exceeding the spin-Hall effect by four orders of magnitude. The calculation is performed within the framework of the Luttinger model and the modern theory of orbital magnetisation, while incorporating recently-discovered quantum corrections to the OHE. Our study constitutes a fundamental milestone in applying the modern theory to a system with inversion symmetry. Moreover, we argue that bulk Ge serves as an ideal testbed for the orbital torque resulting from a charge current, since the spin- and orbital-Edelstein effects in Ge are forbidden by symmetry. Our results provide a blueprint for producing strong orbital torques in magnetic devices with Ge, guiding future experimental work in this direction.

Title: Magnetoelectric Switching of Magnetic Order in Rhombohedral Graphene
Authors: Kilian Krötzsch, Arsen Herasymchuk, Yaroslav Zhumagulov, Arnaud Magrez, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Sergei G. Sharapov, Oleg V. Yazyev, Mitali Banerjee
Abstract: A finite Hall conductance under zero magnetic field implies time reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking due to magnetic order. In rhombohedral stacked multilayer graphene, the angular momentum that breaks TRS can result from the orbital degree of freedom at the $K$ and $K'$ valleys. This leads to valley polarization and occupation-dependent anomalous Hall resistance (AHR) due to the chirality in Berry curvature at the valleys. We report magnetoelectric control of orbital magnetic order in crystalline rhombohedral hexalayer graphene (R6G), achieved without the introduction of a moiré superlattice. At moderate displacement fields and low carrier densities, we observe a non-volatile and hysteretic AHR that can be electrically toggled by sweeping either the carrier density or the displacement field. Upon the application of small perpendicular magnetic fields, the system reveals a characteristic double sign reversal of the AHR, indicating a competition between distinct magnetic ground states. This interplay between valley polarization and electric and magnetic field tuning demonstrates the rich multiferroic behavior of R6G. Our findings present crystalline R6G as a minimal, tunable platform for studying symmetry-breaking phases and magnetic order in flat-band systems, offering insights into the coupling between electronic structure and magnetoelectric response.

Title: Retardance of lab grown diamond substrates as a function of thickness: momentum-drift random walk model
Authors: Thanh Tran, Phuong Vo, Thomas Sheppard, Timothy Grotjohn, Paul Quayle
Abstract: This work studies the correlation between mean retardance and thickness of diamond substrates grown homoepitaxially via microwave plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (MPCVD). We measure the retardance of a diamond substrate in two orientations: perpendicular and parallel to the growth direction. Our experimental results demonstrate that the correlation between mean retardance and thickness differs for these orientations. When measured perpendicular to the growth direction, the mean retardance is approximately proportional to the square root of the substrate thickness. In contrast, when measured parallel to the growth direction, we observe a generally higher mean retardance and an approximately linear correlation with thickness. This anisotropy arises not from differences in stress magnitude but from differences in the interlayer correlation of the principal stress axes, as evidenced by correlation coefficients between the azimuth angles of consecutive layers in the diamond crystal. To simulate the integrated retardance of diamond wafers, we propose a two-dimensional random walk model with momentum drift, which captures the diamond crystal tendency to preserve the azimuth angle across the samples. By optimizing the momentum factor, we show that the model can closely match experimental data. The momentum factor is found higher along the growth direction, which is consistent with the calculated correlation coefficients. Furthermore, both the model and experiments indicate that retardance-to-thickness ratios of thin samples converge toward similar base retardances in both orientations. These findings establish a quantitative framework for interpreting birefringence in diamond substrates, with implications for material selection and development in thermal management, quantum sensing, high-power electronics, and optical applications.

Title: Encoding a topological gauge theory on a ring-shaped Raman-coupled Bose gas
Authors: Claudio Iacovelli, Josep Cabedo, Leticia Tarruell, Alessio Celi
Abstract: Topological gauge theories constitute a framework for understanding strongly correlated quantum matter in terms of weakly interacting composite degrees of freedom. Their topological properties become evident when these theories are realized on a space of non-trivial topology. Here, we propose a scheme to realize a one-dimensional topological gauge theory, the chiral BF theory, on a ring geometry. We obtain such a theory by dimensionally reducing Chern-Simons theory on a disk to the so-called chiral BF theory defined on the ring. Then, we encode the theory into a Hamiltonian with a coupling between angular momentum and density, and we propose and numerically benchmark its realization in an optically-dressed Bose gas confined in a ring-shaped trap. There, the topological properties of the underlying theory manifest themselves through a magnetic flux variable that is density-dependent. We quantify such density-dependent magnetic flux in terms of the ground-state angular momentum and the chiral properties of the system through a Bogoliubov analysis. Our proposal enables the observation of the interplay between the topology of the theory and that of the space.

Title: Predicting the future with magnons
Authors: Zeling Xiong, Christopher Heins, Thibaut Devolder, Fabian Kammerbauer, Mathias Kläui, Jürgen Fassbender, Helmut Schultheiss, Katrin Schultheiss
Abstract: Forecasting complex, chaotic signals is a central challenge across science and technology, with implications ranging from secure communications to climate modeling. Here we demonstrate that magnons - the collective spin excitations in magnetically ordered materials - can serve as an efficient physical reservoir for predicting such dynamics. Using a magnetic microdisk in the vortex state as a magnon-scattering reservoir, we show that intrinsic nonlinear interactions transform a simple microwave input into a high-dimensional spectral output suitable for reservoir computing, in particular, for time series predictions. Trained on the Mackey-Glass benchmark, which generates a cyclic yet aperiodic time series widely used to test machine-learning models, the system achieves accurate and reliable predictions that rival state-of-the-art physical reservoirs. We further identify key design principles: spectral resolution governs the trade-off between dimensionality and accuracy, while combining multiple device geometries systematically improves performance. These results establish magnonics as a promising platform for unconventional computing, offering a path toward scalable and CMOS-compatible hardware for real-time prediction tasks.

Title: deGennes-Suzuki-Kubo Quantum Ising Mean Field Dynamics: Applications to Quantum Hysteresis, Heat Engines and Annealing
Authors: Soumyaditya Das, Soumyajyoti Biswas, Muktish Acharyya, Bikas K. Chakrabarti
Abstract: We briefly review the early development of the mean-field dynamics for cooperatively interacting quantum many-body systems, mapped to pseudo-spin (Ising-like) systems. We start with (Anderson, 1958) pseudo-spin mapping of the BCS (1957) Hamiltonian of superconductivity, reducing it to a mean-field Hamiltonian of XY (or effectively Ising) model in a transverse field. Then we get the mean-field estimate for the equilibrium gap in the ground state energy at different temperatures (gap disappearing at the transition temperature), which fits Landau's (1949) phenomenological theory of superfluidity. We then present in detail a general dynamical extension (for non-equilibrium cases) of the mean-field theory of quantum Ising systems (in a transverse field), following de Gennes' (1963) decomposition of the mean field into orthogonal classical cooperative (longitudinal) component and the quantum (transverse) component, with each component following Suzuki--Kubo (1968) mean-field dynamics. Next we discuss its applications to quantum hysteresis in Ising magnets (in presence of an oscillating transverse field), to quantum heat engines (employing transverse Ising model as working fluid), and to the quantum annealing of the Sherrington--Kirkpatrick (1975) spin glass by tuning down (to zero) the transverse field, which provides a very fast computational algorithm leading to ground state energy values converging to the best known analytic estimate for the model. Finally, we summarize the main results obtained and conclude about the effectiveness of the de Gennes--Suzuki--Kubo mean-field equations for the study of various dynamical aspects of quantum condensed matter systems.

Title: All-Altermagnetic Tunnel Junction of RuO2/NiF2/RuO2
Authors: Long Zhang, Guangxin Ni, Xuehao Wu, Guoying Gao
Abstract: Emerging altermagnets offer a promising avenue for spintronics, yet their integration into magnetic tunnel junctions has been hindered by reliance on ferromagnetic electrodes (introducing stray fields) or by limited functionality (non-tunable magnetoresistance without spin filtering). Here, we propose an all-altermagnetic tunnel junction (AAMTJ) paradigm composed exclusively of altermagnets - exemplified by experimentally feasible RuO2/NiF2/RuO2. Giant tunneling magnetoresistances of 11,704%, 2,496% and 1,892%, and high spin-filtering of ~90% are achieved. This architecture unlocks tunable multistate magnetoresistance and spin filtering via magnetization control of the electrodes and barrier, stemming from their synergistic and antagonistic alignments of momentum-dependent altermagnetic spin-splitting. Our AAMTJ inherently exhibits low consumption and zero stray field, with nonrelativistic spin splitting and vanishing magnetic moment, combining the advantages of both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic tunnel junctions. This AAMTJ paradigm provides a practically versatile platform to realize the revolutionarily potential of altermagnets for reconfigurable magnetic memory devices.

Title: Toward a Deterministic Nucleation Theory for Chirality-Controlled Nanotube Synthesis
Authors: Zhengrong Guo
Abstract: The electronic properties of carbon nanotubes are governed by their chirality, specified by the integer indices (n,m). While chirality-controlled synthesis has achieved notable successes, theoretical understanding remains predominantly focused on post-nucleation growth. Two fundamental obstacles impede deeper insight: the absence of a clear description of nucleation cap topology and its connection to tube chirality, and an incomplete understanding of atomic-level mechanisms governing templated cap formation. Here we address these challenges directly. First, we develop a mathematically rigorous topological framework for carbon networks that provides both a concise definition of cap structures and a quantitative relationship between cap architecture and chirality-the vector sum rule. Second, contrary to conventional perspectives attributing chirality enrichment to edge matching during growth, we demonstrate that chirality is deterministically encoded during nucleation through selective formation of specific cap structures on catalyst surfaces. For the specific case of (12,6) nanotubes, we show that their enrichment arises from a six-fold symmetric cap with epitaxial matching to catalyst facets. Our deterministic nucleation theory not only provides a coherent explanation for chirality enrichment but also elucidates its pattern in chirality space. This work establishes a theoretical framework that redefines the field, shifting the paradigm from stochastic growth kinetics to deterministic nucleation programming and paving the way toward predictable synthesis.

Title: Coupling between vibration and Luttinger liquid in mechanical nanowires
Authors: Zeyu Rao, Yue-Xin Huang, Guang-Can Guo, Ming Gong
Abstract: The vibration of the mechanical nanowire coupled to photons via photon pressure and coupled to charges via the capacity has been widely explored in experiments in the past decades. This system is electrically neutral, thus its coupling to the other degrees of freedom is always challenging. Here, we show that the vibration can slightly change the nanowire length and the associated Fermi velocity, which leads to coupling between vibration and Luttinger liquid. We consider the transverse and longitudinal vibrations of the nanowires, showing that the transverse vibration is much more significant than the longitudinal vibration, which can be measured through the sizable frequency shift. We predict an instability of the vibration induced by this coupling when the frequency becomes negative at a critical temperature for the transverse vibrations in nanowires with low Fermi energy, which can be reached by tuning the chemical potential and magnetic field. The time-dependent oscillation of the conductance, which directly measures the Luttinger parameter, can provide evidence for this coupling. Our theory offers a new mechanism for exploring the coupling between the vibration and the electronic excitations, which may lead to intriguing applications in cooling and controlling the mechanical oscillators with currents.

Title: Probing Topological Phases in a Strongly Correlated Ladder Model via Entanglement
Authors: Aminul Hussain, Nisa Ara, Rudranil Basu, Sudeshna Sen
Abstract: The interplay between non-trivial band topology and strong electronic correlations is a central challenge in modern condensed matter physics. We investigate this competition on a two-leg ladder model with a p-wave-like hybridisation between the legs. This model hosts a symmetry-protected topological phase in its non-interacting limit. Using the density-matrix renormalisation group algorithm, we compute the comprehensive quantum phase diagram in the presence of a repulsive inter-leg density-density interaction. Our analysis, based on entanglement entropy and the entanglement spectrum, reveals a fascinating dichotomy in the stability of the topological phase. We find a non-trivial change in the value of the edge entanglement entropy as we include interaction. Furthermore, we find that the phase boundary separating a trivial insulator phase and a topological one with winding number two remains robustly pinned at its non-interacting location, irrespective of the interaction strength. Variation of the effective conformal field theory's central charge near the critical line explains the robustness of the gap. In contrast, the transition to an insulating phase with winding number one is heavily renormalised, with the critical line shifting significantly as the interaction increases. By successfully mapping the phase diagram and identifying the distinct behaviours of the phase boundaries, our work clarifies how interactions can selectively preserve or destroy different aspects of a topological phase.

Title: Local thermodynamic DOS measurement and twist-angle mapping in graphene-hBN superlattices
Authors: Namkyung Lee, Hangyeol Park, Seungwon Jung, Baeksan Jang, Seonyu Lee, Joonho Jang
Abstract: Moiré patterns arising from twisted van der Waals stacks fundamentally reshape their electronic properties, enabling band-structure engineering that has driven rapidly growing interest in this field. In studying electronic properties, however, structural disorder present in real devices often leads to twist-angle inhomogeneity and obscures angle-dependent electronic effects when measured with bulk-averaged measurements. Probes that can access local thermodynamic response of the electronic systems with high sensitivity would be highly valuable. Here, we adopt Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) to locally investigate graphene-hBN superlattices. By additionally modulating the chemical potential of the system, we obtain the inverse compressibility with high signal-to-noise ratio, enabling extraction of the local thermodynamic DOS. From this information, we determine the local twist angle along the device and find that twist-angle deviations are strongly correlated with bubble-induced strain features. Furthermore, by simultaneously tracking the offsets in the contact potential difference and in the net charge, we identify which interface within the heterostructure hosts the trapped bubbles. This capability to identify local electro-chemical environments provides a practical tool for strain-based studies and future device designs utilizing nanoscale engineering in moiré systems.

Title: Controlled generation of 3D vortices in driven atomic Josephson junctions
Authors: Vijay Pal Singh, Ludwig Mathey, Herwig Ott, Luigi Amico
Abstract: We propose an ac-driven atomic Josephson junction as a clean and tunable source of three dimensional (3D) solitary waves in quantum fluids. Depending on the height of the junction barrier, the emitted excitations appear as vortex rings at low velocity or vorticity-free rarefaction pulses near the sound velocity, thus spanning the complete Jones-Roberts family of solitons. The Shapiro-step phenomenon renders the emission deterministic: on the first, second, third Shapiro steps, the junction ejects one, two, and three solitary excitations per drive cycle. This enables controlled generation of single- and multi-excitation configurations, allowing detailed studies of the full crossover between vortex rings and rarefaction pulses and their interaction dynamics. In particular, deterministic multi-ring emission provides insights into leapfrogging dynamics of two and three coaxial rings and their decay via boundary-assisted, sound-mediated processes. This ac-driven protocol establishes a compact and reproducible platform for generating, classifying, and controlling 3D solitonic excitations, paving the way for precision studies of nonlinear vortex dynamics, dissipation, and quantum turbulence in trapped superfluids.

Title: Chiral Cavity Control of the Interlayer Exciton Energy Spectrum
Authors: Jonathan Sanchez-Lopez, Ze-Xun Lin, Di Luo, Prineha narang
Abstract: Heterostructures of two-dimensional materials offer a versatile platform to study light-matter interactions of electron and hole gases. By separating electron and hole layers with an insulator long-lived electron-hole bound states known as interlayer excitons can form. We predict that by placing an interlayer exciton in a time-reversal-symmetry-breaking chiral cavity the energy spectrum of an interlayer exciton can be reordered. As a consequence of this reordering the ground state of the interlayer exciton can be driven from an s-orbital to a p-orbital, effectively changing the symmetry of the electron-hole pair. We present a phase diagram showing the couplings and separations required for a p-orbital excitonic ground state where we predict that larger interlayer separations require higher cavity couplings. We expect these results to be relevant for angular-momentum-tunable, single photon emission physics.

Title: The number of spanning trees as an indicator of critical phenomena: When Kirchhoff meets Ising
Authors: Roberto da Silva, Henrique A. Fernandes, Paulo G. Freitas, Sebastian Gonçalves, E. V. Stock, A. Alves
Abstract: Visibility graphs are spatial interpretations of time series. When derived from the time evolution of physical systems, the graphs associated with such series may exhibit properties that can reflect aspects such as ergodicity, criticality, or other dynamical behaviors. It is important to describe how the criticality of a system is manifested in the structure of the corresponding graphs or, in a particular way, in the spectra of certain matrices constructed from them. In this paper, we show how the critical behavior of an Ising spin system manifests in the spectra of the adjacency and Laplacian matrices constructed from an ensemble of time evolutions simulated via Monte Carlo (MC) Markov Chains, even for small systems and short MC steps. In particular, we show that the number of spanning trees -- or its logarithm -- , which represents a kind of \emph{structural entropy} or \emph{topological complexity} here obtained from Kirchhoff's theorem, can, in an alternative way, describe the criticality of the spin system. These findings parallel those obtained from the spectra of correlation matrices, which similarly encode signatures of critical and chaotic behavior.

Title: Ultrafast symmetry modulation and induced magnetic excitation in the Kagome metal RbV3Sb5
Authors: Mengxue Guan, Xiaodong Zhou, Jingyi Duan, Chaoxi Cui, Wei Jiang, Zeying Zhang, Binhua Zhang, Zhengwei Nie, Xun Shi, Zhiwei Wang, Yugui Yao
Abstract: Light-matter interaction in frustrated Kagome metals enables access to hidden quantum states, yet the microscopic origin of symmetry breaking under ultrafast excitation remains elusive. Here, we uncover a microscopic mechanism for laser-induced symmetry breaking in RbV3Sb5 through first-principles real-time simulations. Selective excitation of a single-QM phonon mode dynamically breaks both rotational and time-reversal symmetries within the 2X2X1 charge density wave (CDW) superlattice. The resulting anisotropic lattice distortion lifts geometric frustration and stabilizes a nonequilibrium ferrimagnetic phase, accompanied by a sizable intrinsic anomalous Hall effect. Distinct from prior interpretations based on orbital antiferromagnetism or extrinsic perturbations, our findings reveal a spin-driven pathway for symmetry breaking under strong optical fields. These results provide a microscopic foundation for exploring how spin, lattice and charge degrees of freedom are intertwined in nonequilibrium correlated states.

Title: The Microscopic Structure of Stacking Faults in Sr$_2$NaNb$_5$O$_{15}$
Authors: Robin Sjökvist, Yining Xie, Zabeada Aslam, Andy P. Brown, Nicholas C. Bristowe, Mark S. Senn, Richard Beanland
Abstract: Stacking faults and other topological defects in ferroics can have a significant influence on the electronic and mechanical properties of the material. Here, regular stacking faults in the tetragonal tungsten bronze material Sr$_2$NaNb$_5$O$_{15}$ are investigated through transmission electron microscopy, symmetry mode analysis and machine-learned force-field calculations. It is shown that the faults, with a fault vector of $\frac{1}{4}[\bar{2}12]_o$, annihilate in sets of four in the material, owing to the $\frac{1}{4}$ unit cell displacement along the b-axis. The four resulting domains emerge as four possible directions of the S$_3$ order parameter, related to NbO$_6$ octahedral tilts in the material. Force-field calculations reveal that the stacking faults are likely placed at positions where the octahedra in neighbouring domains have similar magnitudes of rotation, and that the estimated stacking fault energy is 46 mJ/m$^2$. The investigation shows that the stacking faults have a significant local effect on the polar modes present in the structure, and therefore could affect the ferroelectric properties.

Title: A Fast, Accurate, and Reactive Equivariant Foundation Potential
Authors: Tsz Wai Ko, Runze Liu, Adesh Rohan Mishra, Zihan Yu, Ji Qi, Shyue Ping Ong
Abstract: Electrostatics govern charge transfer and reactivity in materials. Yet, most foundation potentials (FPs) either do not explicitly model such interactions or pay a prohibitive scaling penalty to do so. Here, we introduce charge-equilibrated TensorNet (QET), an equivariant, charge-aware architecture that attains linear scaling with system size via an analytically solvable charge-equilibration scheme. We demonstrate that a trained QET FP matches state-of-the-art FPs on standard materials property benchmarks but delivers qualitatively different predictions in systems dominated by charge transfer. The QET FP reproduces the correct structure and density of the NaCl-CaCl2 ionic liquid, which charge-agnostic FPs miss. We further show that a fine-tuned QET captures reactive processes at the Li/Li6PS5Cl solid-electrolyte interface and supports simulations under applied electrochemical potentials. These results remove a fundamental constraint in the atomistic simulation of accurate electrostatics at scale and establish a general, data-driven framework for charge-aware FPs with transformative applications in energy storage, catalysis, and beyond.

Title: Eigenvalue and pseudospectrum processes generated by nonnormal Toeplitz matrices with rank 1 perturbations
Authors: Saori Morimoto, Makoto Katori, Tomoyuki Shirai
Abstract: We introduce two kinds of matrix-valued dynamical processes generated by nonnormal Toeplitz matrices with the additive rank 1 perturbations $\delta J$, where $\delta \in {\mathbb{C}}$ and $J$ is the all-ones matrix. For each process, first we report the complicated motion of the numerically obtained eigenvalues. Then we derive the specific equation which determines the motion of non-zero simple eigenvalues and clarifies the time-dependence of degeneracy of the zero-eigenvalue $\lambda_0=0$. Comparison with the solutions of this equation, it is concluded that the numerically observed non-zero eigenvalues distributing around $\lambda_0$ are the exact eigenvalues not of the original system, but of the system perturbed by uncontrolled rounding errors of computer. The complex domain in which the eigenvalues of randomly perturbed system are distributed is identified with the pseudospectrum including $\lambda_0$ of the original system with $\delta J$. We characterize the pseudospectrum processes using the symbol curves of the corresponding nonnormal Toeplitz operators without $\delta J$. We report new phenomena in our second model such that at each time the outermost closed simple curve cut out from the symbol curve is realized as the exact eigenvalues, but the inner part of symbol curve is reduced in size and embedded in the pseudospectrum including $\lambda_0$. Such separation of exact simple eigenvalues and a degenerated eigenvalue associated with pseudospectrum will be meaningful for numerical analysis, since the former is stable and robust, but the latter is highly sensitive and unstable with respective to perturbations. The present study will be related to the pseudospectra approaches to non-Hermitian systems developed in quantum physics

Title: Natural gradient and parameter estimation for quantum Boltzmann machines
Authors: Dhrumil Patel, Mark M. Wilde
Abstract: Thermal states play a fundamental role in various areas of physics, and they are becoming increasingly important in quantum information science, with applications related to semi-definite programming, quantum Boltzmann machine learning, Hamiltonian learning, and the related task of estimating the parameters of a Hamiltonian. Here we establish formulas underlying the basic geometry of parameterized thermal states, and we delineate quantum algorithms for estimating the values of these formulas. More specifically, we establish formulas for the Fisher--Bures and Kubo--Mori information matrices of parameterized thermal states, and our quantum algorithms for estimating their matrix elements involve a combination of classical sampling, Hamiltonian simulation, and the Hadamard test. These results have applications in developing a natural gradient descent algorithm for quantum Boltzmann machine learning, which takes into account the geometry of thermal states, and in establishing fundamental limitations on the ability to estimate the parameters of a Hamiltonian, when given access to thermal-state samples. For the latter task, and for the special case of estimating a single parameter, we sketch an algorithm that realizes a measurement that is asymptotically optimal for the estimation task. We finally stress that the natural gradient descent algorithm developed here can be used for any machine learning problem that employs the quantum Boltzmann machine ansatz.

Title: Generalized Eigenspaces and Pseudospectra of Nonnormal and Defective Matrix-Valued Dynamical Systems
Authors: Saori Morimoto, Makoto Katori, Tomoyuki Shirai
Abstract: We consider nonnormal matrix-valued dynamical systems with discrete time. For an eigenvalue of matrix, the number of times it appears as a root of the characteristic polynomial is called the algebraic multiplicity. On the other hand, the geometric multiplicity is the dimension of the linear space of eigenvectors associated with that eigenvalue. If the former exceeds the latter, then the eigenvalue is said to be defective and the matrix becomes nondiagonalizable by any similarity transformation. The discrete-time of our dynamics is identified with the geometric multiplicity of the zero eigenvalue $\lambda_0=0$. Its algebraic multiplicity takes about half of the matrix size at $t=1$ and increases stepwise in time, which keeps excess to the geometric multiplicity until their coincidence at the final time. Our model exhibits relaxation processes from far-from-normal to near-normal matrices, in which the defectivity of $\lambda_0$ is recovering in time. We show that such processes are realized as size reductions of pseudospectrum including $\lambda_0$. Here the pseudospectra are the domains on the complex plane which are not necessarily exact spectra but in which the resolvent of matrix takes extremely large values. The defective eigenvalue $\lambda_0$ is sensitive to perturbation and the eigenvalues of the perturbed systems are distributed densely in the pseudospectrum including $\lambda_0$. By constructing generalized eigenspace for $\lambda_0$, we give the Jordan block decomposition for the resolvent of matrix and characterize the pseudospectrum dynamics. Numerical study of the systems perturbed by Gaussian random matrices supports the validity of the present analysis.

Title: Sub-Doppler cooling, state preparation, and optical trapping of a triel atom
Authors: Putian Li, Xianquan Yu, Seth Hew Peng Chew, Jinchao Mo, Tiangao Lu, Travis L. Nicholson
Abstract: Ultracold gases of atoms from Main Group III (Group 13) of the Periodic Table, also known as "triel elements," have great potential for a new generation of quantum matter experiments. The first magneto-optical trap of a triel element (indium) was recently realized, but more progress is needed before a triel is ready for modern ultracold quantum science experiments in optical traps. Reaching this regime typically requires atoms that are cooled to the 10 uK level or below, prepared in pure quantum states, and confined in a laser field. Here we report the achievement of all three of these milestones in atomic indium. First, we perform polarization gradient cooling of an indium gas to 15 uK. Second, we spin polarize the gas into a single hyperfine sublevel of either the $5P_{1/2}$ indium ground state or the $5P_{3/2}$ metastable state. Third, we trap indium in a 1064 nm optical lattice, achieving a 3 s trap lifetime. With these results, indium is now a candidate for a next generation quantum research platform.

Title: CaF+CaF interactions in the ground and excited electronic states: implications for collisional losses
Authors: Dibyendu Sardar, Marcin Gronowski, Michał Tomza, John L. Bohn
Abstract: Accurate \textit{ab initio} potential energy surfaces are essential to understand and predict collisional outcomes in ultracold molecular systems. In this study, we explore the intermolecular interactions between two laser-cooled CaF molecules, both in their ground and excited electronic states, aiming to understand the mechanisms behind the observed collisional losses on the non-reactive, spin-polarized surface of the CaF+CaF system. Using state-of-the-art \textit{ab initio} methods, we compute twelve electronic states of the Ca$_2$F$_2$ complex within the rigid rotor approximation applied to CaF. Calculating the potential energy surfaces for the excited electronic states of Ca$_2$F$_2$ is challenging and computationally expensive. Our approach employs the multireference configuration interaction method, restricted to single and double excitations, along with a reasonably large active space to ensure the convergence in the excited states. We also compute the spin-orbit coupling between the ground state and the lowest spin-polarized triplet state, as well as the spin-spin coupling within the lowest triplet state (1) $^3\mathrm{A}'$. Additionally, we determine the electric transition dipole moments for the (1) $^3\mathrm{A}'$-(2) $^3\mathrm{A}'$ and (1) $^3\mathrm{A}'$-(1) $^3\mathrm{A}''$ transitions. Notably, we find that the lowest spin-polarized state (1) $^3\mathrm{A}'$, shifted by 1064 nm of laser light from the optical dipole trap, intersects several electronically excited states. Finally, by analyzing the potential energy surfaces, we discuss two plausible pathways that may account for the observed collisional losses on the spin-polarized surface of the CaF+CaF system.

Title: Spatially Correlated Noise Induces Transitions from the Diffusive to Ballistic Regime in Fluids
Authors: Sijie Huang, Ayush Saurabh, Steve Presse
Abstract: We investigate the fluctuating incompressible Navier--Stokes equation driven by spatially correlated noise, characterized by a single length scale, and constructed to preserve thermal equilibrium through the corresponding fluctuation--dissipation relation. Numerical simulations reveal that a tracer particle's mean-squared displacement (MSD) depends monotonically on the correlation length \(\ell\) and the correlation strength \(\beta\). Intuitively, increasing \(\ell\) enhances MSD and induces the emergence of an early-time ballistic regime, because a larger correlation length slows viscous momentum diffusion. Counterintuitively, decreasing \(\beta\) also increases the MSD, because a weaker correlation strength decelerates fluid momentum diffusion. Thus, the emergence or suppression of the ballistic regime stems from the competition between momentum correlation and viscous dissipation. We further show that spatial correlation introduces nonlocal momentum diffusion in the hydrodynamic equation, reminiscent of the slow dynamics in glassy and other disordered systems.

Title: Multi-loop spectra in general scalar EFTs and CFTs
Authors: Johan Henriksson, Franz Herzog, Stefanos R. Kousvos, Jasper Roosmale Nepveu
Abstract: We consider the most general effective field theory (EFT) Lagrangian with scalar fields and derivatives, and renormalise it to substantially higher loop order than existing results in the literature. EFT Lagrangians have phenomenological applications, for example by encoding corrections to the Standard Model from unknown new physics. At the same time, scalar EFTs capture the spectrum of Wilson--Fisher conformal field theories (CFTs) in $4-\varepsilon$ dimensions. Our results are enabled by a more efficient version of the $R^*$ method for renormalisation, in which the IR divergences are subtracted via a small-momentum asymptotic expansion. In particular, we renormalise the most general set of composite operators up to engineering dimension six and Lorentz rank two. We exhibit direct applications of our results to Ising ($Z_2$), $O(n)$, and hypercubic ($S_n \ltimes (Z_2)^n$) CFTs, relevant for a plethora of real-world critical phenomena. The computed scaling dimensions agree well with known non-perturbative results, and they lead to new predictions where such results do not yet exist. We thereby expand the understanding of generic EFTs and open new possibilities in diverse fields, such as the numerical conformal bootstrap.

Title: Universal Frequency Correlations and Recurrence Statistics of Complex Impedance Matrices
Authors: Nadav Shaibe, Jared Erb, Thomas M. Antonsen, Steven M. Anlage
Abstract: Linear electromagnetic wave scattering systems can be characterized by an impedance matrix that relates the voltages and currents at the ports of the system. When the system size becomes greater than the wavelength of the fields involved, the impedance matrix becomes a complicated function of the details of the system, in which case a statistical model, such as the Random Coupling Model (RCM) becomes useful. The statistics of the elements of the RCM impedance matrix depend on the excitation frequency, the spectral density of the modes of the enclosed system volume, the average loss factor (Q^{-1}) of the system, and the properties of the coupling ports as given by their radiation impedances. In this paper, properties of the elements of impedance matrices are explored numerically and experimentally. These include the two point frequency correlation functions for the complex impedance of elements and the expected difference in frequencies between which impedance values are approximately repeated. Universal scaling arguments are then given for these quantities, hence these results are generic for all sufficiently complicated scattering systems, including acoustic and optical systems. The experimental data presented in this paper come from microwave graphs, billiards, and three-dimensional cavities with embedded tunable perturbers such as metasurfaces. The data is found to be in generally good agreement with the predictions for the two point frequency correlations and the frequency interval for successive repetitions of impedance matrix elements values.

Title: A continuous invariant-based asymmetry of a periodic crystal quantifies its deviation from higher symmetry
Authors: Surya Majumder, Daniel Widdowson, Yury Elkin, Olga Anosova, Andrew I Cooper, Graeme M Day, Vitaliy Kurlin
Abstract: Ideal symmetry is known to break down under almost any noise. One measure of asymmetry in a periodic crystal is the relative multiplicity Z' of geometrically non-equivalent units. However, Z' discontinuously changes under almost any displacement of atoms, which can arbitrarily scale up a primitive cell. This discontinuity was recently resolved by a hierarchy of invariant descriptors that continuously change under all small perturbations. We introduce a Continuous Invariant-based Asymmetry (CIA) to quantify (in physically meaningful Angstroms) the deviation of a periodic crystal from a higher symmetry form. Our experiments on Crystal Structure Prediction datasets show that many simulated crystals may be non-synthesisable not only due to high energy but also due to high CIA values, which are much faster to compute. On another hand, many crystals with high Z' values in the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) turned out to be close to more symmetric forms with Z'<=1 due to low CIA values.

Title: Critical Dynamics of Superfluids
Authors: Aristomenis Donos, Polydoros Kailidis
Abstract: We use standard techniques of hydrodynamics to construct a relativistic effective field theory for the low energy dynamics of nearly critical superfluids. In an appropriate non-relativistic limit, our theory predicts an additional coefficient when compared and contrasted to earlier work of Khalatnikov and Lebedev. In addition, we provide an alternative derivation of the same effective theory, using the Keldysh-Schwinger framework for non-equilibrium systems. Finally, we comment on the comparison with the results of an appropriate holographic computation presented in a companion paper. This provides further evidence in support of the theory we propose and confirms the existence of the extra coefficient we identified.
