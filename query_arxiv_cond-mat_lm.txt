Title: A Century of Bose-Einstein Condensation
Authors: Nick P. Proukakis
Abstract: Bose-Einstein Condensation is a phenomenon at the heart of many of the past century's most intriguing and fundamental manifestations, such as superfluidity and superconductivity. It was discovered theoretically some 100 years ago, and unequivocally experimentally demonstrated in the context of weakly interacting gases 30 years ago. Since then, it has spawned a revolution in our understanding of fundamental phases of matter and collective quantum dynamics extending across all physical scales and energies, with unforeseen implications and the potential for envisaged quantum technological applications.

Title: Designing artificial zinc phosphate tribofilms with tailored mechanical properties by altering the chain length
Authors: Sebastian Lellig, Subisha Balakumar, Peter Schweizer, Eva P. Mayer, Simon Evertz, Marcus Hans, Damian M. Holzapfel, Yin Du, Qing Zhou, Martin Dienwiebel, Johann Michler, Jochen M. Schneider
Abstract: Zinc dialkyldithiophosphate (ZDDP), as the most prominent lubrication additive, forms tribofilms consisting primarily of zinc phosphate glasses containing sulfides. As sulfur is linked to environmental concerns, sulfur-free zinc phosphate coatings have been sputtered from a Zn3(PO4)2 target and investigated here. Based on the bridging to non-bridging oxygen ratio, determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), the as deposited coatings are classified as metaphosphates. As the annealing temperature is increased, the chain lengths are reduced, as witnessed by XPS data indicated by a loss of phosphorus and oxygen of the coating surface, likely due to hydrolysis with water from the atmosphere. Transmission electron microscopy energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy line scans show that the XPS-revealed composition change of the coating surface upon annealing occurs over the whole thickness of the coating. This alteration in composition and chain length reductions causes a rise in hardness, reduced Young's modulus, and wear resistance. Therefore, the properties of the artificial zinc phosphate tribofilms can be tailored via a thermally stimulated composition change, causing an alternation in chain length from meta- to orthophosphate and thereby enabling the design of coatings with desired mechanical properties.

Title: The Hamiltonian mechanics of exotic particles
Authors: Andrea Amoretti, Daniel K. Brattan, Luca Martinoia
Abstract: We develop Hamiltonian mechanics on Aristotelian manifolds, which lack local boost symmetry and admit absolute time and space structures. We construct invariant phase space dynamics, define free Hamiltonians, and establish a generalized Liouville theorem. Conserved quantities are identified via lifted Killing vectors. Extending to kinetic theory, we show that the charge current and stress tensor reproduce ideal hydrodynamics at leading order, with the ideal gas law emerging universally. Our framework provides a geometric and dynamical foundation for systems where boost invariance is absent, with applications including but not limited to: condensed matter, active matter and optimization dynamics.

Title: Room-Temperature Disorder-Driven Nonlinear Transport in Topological Materials
Authors: Rhonald Burgos Atencia, Shanshan Liu, Kian Ping Loh, Dimitrie Culcer
Abstract: Recent experiments have reported nonlinear signals in topological materials up to room temperature. Here we show that this response stems from extrinsic spin-orbit contributions to \textit{both} impurity and phonon scattering. While skew scattering dominates at low temperatures, the side jump contribution $\propto \tau/\tau_\beta$, where $\tau$, $\tau_\beta$ are the momentum and skew scattering times respectively. Consequently side jump exhibits a weak temperature dependence and remains sizable at room temperature. Our results provide a roadmap for engineering nonlinear transport at ambient conditions.

Title: Spin Currents in Rashba Altermagnets: From Equilibrium to Nonlinear Regimes
Authors: Priyadarshini Kapri
Abstract: We investigate equilibrium (background), linear, and nonlinear spin currents in two-dimensional Rashba spin-orbit coupled altermagnet systems, using a modified spin current operator that includes anomalous velocity from non-zero Berry curvature. The background spin current, stemming from spin-orbit coupling and modulated by the altermagnet term ($t_j$), exhibits in-plane polarization, increases linearly with Fermi energy ($\epsilon_F$), and is enhanced by both the altermagnet ($t_j$) and the Rashba parameter ($\lambda$). Linear spin current is always transverse with out-of-plane polarization and can be viewed as Spin Hall current, primarily driven by band velocity, with $t_j$ enabling a band-induced contribution (previously absent in simple Rashba systems ($t_j=0$)). This highlights altermagnet system as a promising source of spin Hall current generation. For linear spin Hall current, its band contribution's magnitude increases linearly with $\epsilon_F$, while the magnitude of anomalous component saturates at higher $\epsilon_F$. Further, the magnitude of spin Hall current is enhanced by $t_j$ but reduced by $\lambda$. Nonlinear spin currents feature both longitudinal and transverse components with in-plane polarization. Both the nonlinear longitudinal spin current from band velocity and the nonlinear transverse spin current from anomalous velocity initially decrease with $\epsilon_F$ before saturating at higher $\epsilon_F$. Importantly, $t_j$ reduces these currents while $\lambda$ enhances them. Meanwhile, the nonlinear transverse current from band velocity increases and then saturates with $\epsilon_F$, enhanced by $\lambda$ and showing non-monotonic variation with $t_j$. These findings highlight the tunability of spin current behavior through Rashba and altermagnet parameters, offering insights for spintronic applications.

Title: Weyl semimetal engineering by symmetry control in NiTe$_2$
Authors: Marcos G. O. Junior, Augusto L. Ara√∫jo, Emmanuel V. C. Lopes, Tome M. Schmidt
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the emergence of Weyl points in an inversion symmetry-breaking 1T-NiTe$_2$ system. Through first-principles calculations based on the density functional theory combined with tight-binding methods, distinct number of Weyl crossings arise under an appropriate symmetry breaking. We identify three sets of Weyl points by breaking the inversion symmetry in NiTe$_2$, resulting in a total of 28 Weyl crossings. The first set comes from the Dirac semimetal, whereas the other two additional sets depend on the weight of the symmetry breaking. The topological characteristics of the Weyl semimetals have been investigated by computing the evolution of Wannier charge centers, providing their chiralities. Additionally, the bulk-boundary correspondence has been shown by computing the Fermi arcs. Our results provide a way for manipulating and creating distinct sets of Weyl points with appropriate external control, which can be valuable for applications in Weyltronics.

Title: AutoSAS: a new human-aside-the-loop paradigm for automated SAS fitting for high throughput and autonomous experimentation
Authors: Duncan R. Sutherland, Rachel Ford, Yun Liu, Tyler B. Martin, Peter A. Beaucage
Abstract: The advancement of artificial-intelligence driven autonomous experiments demands physics-based modeling and decision-making processes, not only to improve the accuracy of the experimental trajectory but also to increase trust by allowing transparent human-machine collaboration. High-quality structural characterization techniques (e.g., X-ray, neutron, or static light scattering) are a particularly relevant example of this need: they provide invaluable information but are challenging to analyze without expert oversight. Here, we introduce AutoSAS, a novel framework for human-aside-the-loop automated data classification. AutoSAS leverages human-defined candidate models, high-throughput combinatorial fitting, and information-theoretic model selection to generate both classification results and quantitative structural descriptors. We implement AutoSAS in an open-source package designed for use with the Autonomous Formulation Laboratory (AFL) for X-ray and neutron scattering-based optimization of multicomponent liquid formulations. In a first application, we leveraged a set of expert defined candidate models to classify, refine the structure, and track transformations in a model injectable drug carrier system. We evaluated four model selection methods and benchmarked them against an optimized machine learning classifier and the best approach was one that balanced quality of the fit and complexity of the model. AutoSAS not only corroborated the critical micelle concentration boundary identified in previous experiments but also discovered a second structural transition boundary not identified by the previous methods. These results demonstrate the potential of AutoSAS to enhance autonomous experimental workflows by providing robust, interpretable model selection, paving the way for more reliable and insightful structural characterization in complex formulations.

Title: Atomic-scale insights on grain boundary segregation in a cathode battery material
Authors: Inger-Emma Nylund, Elise R. Eilertsen, Constantinos A. Hatzoglou, Kaja Eggen Aune, Ruben Bj√∏rge, Antonius T. J. van Helvoort, Ann Mari Svensson, Paraskevas Kontis
Abstract: The grain boundary segregation of the Co-free pristine spinel LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 cathode material has been studied by transmission electron microscopy and atom probe tomography. The segregation of Mn and the depletion of Ni at grain boundaries was observed by electron energy loss spectroscopy. These observations were also confirmed by atom probe tomography at other grain boundaries, which also revealed segregation of O and depletion of Li at grain boundaries. In addition, both methods revealed the occurrence of grain boundary segregation of Na, which is an impurity. Finally, segregation of O and Mn and a depletion of Li are also observed at dislocations. This observation has the potential to provide further support for the segregation behavior at the grain boundaries of this cathode material. These near-atomic-scale observations provide new insights that can be used to improve the synthesis and efficiency of Li-ion battery materials.

Title: Evolution of charge correlations in the hole-doped kagome superconductor CsV$_{3-x}$Ti$_x$Sb$_5$
Authors: Ganesh Pokharel, Canxun Zhang, Evgeny Redekop, Brenden R. Ortiz, Andrea N. Capa Salinas, Sarah Schwarz, Steven J. Gomez Alvarado, Suchismita Sarker, Andrea F. Young, Stephen D. Wilson
Abstract: The interplay between superconductivity and charge correlations in the kagome metal CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ can be tuned by external perturbations such as doping or pressure. Here we present a study of charge correlations and superconductivity upon hole doping via Ti substitution on the V kagome sites in CsV$_{3-x}$Ti$_x$Sb$_5$ via synchrotron x-ray diffraction and scanning SQUID measurements. While the superconducting phase, as viewed via the vortex structure, remains conventional and unchanged across the phase diagram, the nature of charge correlations evolves as a function of hole-doping from the first superconducting dome into the second superconducting dome. For Ti doping in the first superconducting dome, competing $2\times 2 \times 2$ and $2\times 2 \times 4$ supercells form within the charge density wave state and are suppressed rapidly with carrier substitution. In the second superconducting dome, no charge correlations are detected. Comparing these results to those observed for CsV$_3$Sb$_{5-x}$Sn$_x$ suggests important differences between hole doping via chemical substitution on the V and Sb sites, particularly in the disorder potential associated with each dopant.

Title: Movable Dirac Points with Ferroelectrics: Kink States and Berry Curvature Dipoles
Authors: Konstantin S. Denisov, Yuntian Liu, Igor ≈Ωutiƒá
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) Dirac states and Dirac points with linear dispersion are the hallmark of graphene, topological insulators, semimetals, and superconductors. Lowering a symmetry by the ferroelectric polarization opens the gap in Dirac points and introduces finite Berry curvature. Combining this with Dirac points detached from high symmetry points of the Brillouin zone offers additional ways to tailor topological properties. We explore this concept by studying topological phenomena emerging in 2D materials with movable Dirac points and broken out-of-plane mirror reflection. The resulting topological kink states and Berry curvature dipoles are changed by movable 2D Dirac points with experimental signatures in electrical conductance and second-harmonic nonlinear Hall conductivity. We identify materials platforms where our predictions can be realized and support that with the first-principles results for Cl$_2$Rh$_2$S$_2$-GeS junction.

Title: Mechanically Interlocked Polymers in Dilute Solution under Shear and Extensional Flows: A Brownian Dynamics Study
Authors: Ali Seyedi, Alex Albaugh
Abstract: Mechanically interlocked polymers (MIPs) are a novel class of polymer structures in which the components are connected by mechanical bonds instead of covalent bonds. We measure the single-molecule rheological properties of polyrotaxanes, daisy chains, and polycatenanes under steady shear and steady uniaxial extension using coarse-grained Brownian dynamics simulations with hydrodynamic interactions. We obtain key rheological features, including tumbling dynamics, molecular extension, stress, and viscosity. By systematically varying structural features, we demonstrate how MIP topology governs flow response. Compared to linear polymers, all three MIP architectures exhibit enhanced tumbling in shear flow and lower normal stress differences in extensional flow. While polyrotaxanes show higher shear and extensional viscosities, polycatenanes and daisy chains have lower viscosities. In extensional flow, polyrotaxanes and polycatenanes extend earlier than linear polymers. We find that mechanical bonds suppress shear thinning and alter the coil-stretch transition observed in linear polymers. These effects arise from the mechanically bonded rings in MIPs, which expand the polymer profile in gradient direction and increase backbone stiffness due to ring-backbone repulsions. This study provides key insights into MIP flow properties, providing the foundation for their systematic development in engineering applications.

Title: Resolving Andreev spin qubits in germanium-based Josephson junctions
Authors: Silas Hoffman, Charles Tahan
Abstract: Andreev spin qubits (ASQs) are a promising platform for quantum information processing which benefit from both the small footprint of semiconducting spin qubits and the long range connectivity of superconducting qubits. While state-of-the-art experiments have developed ASQs in InAs nanowires, these realizations are coherence-time limited by nuclear magnetic noise which cannot be removed by isotopic purification. In Ge-based Josephson junctions, which can be isotopically purified, Andreev states have been experimentally observed but spin-resolved Andreev states remain elusive. Here, we theoretically demonstrate that the geometry of the Josephson junction can limit the qubit frequency to values below typical experimental temperatures and render the ASQ effectively invisible. ASQs could be experimentally resolved by judiciously choosing the geometry of the junction and filling of the underlying Ge. Our comprehensive study of ASQ frequency on in situ and ex situ experimentally controllable parameters provides design guidance of Ge-based Josephson junctions and paves the way towards realization of high-coherence ASQs.

Title: Disorder enhanced ferromagnetic polaron formation -- and the test case of Europium Oxide
Authors: Tanmoy Mondal, Pinaki Majumdar
Abstract: Europium Oxide (EuO), a low carrier density local moment ferromagnet, shows a wide variety of transport behaviour depending on preparative conditions. Some samples have a moderate resistivity with a modest peak near $T_c$ while others show a huge peak in resistivity followed by insulating high temperature behaviour. These features have been known for decades and have been attributed to the presence of magnetic polarons in a disordered background. Actual attempts at a theory, however, reduce the problem either to a single trapped electron or to an averaged picture where the spatial physics of polarons is lost. The difficulty stems from having to handle electronic states in a magnetically fluctuating, structurally disordered background. Via an explicit real space calculation in two dimensions, we examine the interplay of disorder induced localisation and magnetic polaron formation and show how the resistivity trends in EuO could emerge from increasing impurity concentration. We estimate the polaron size in the disordered medium, establish the presence of a pseudogap near $T_c$, predict a crossover to incoherent, non Drude, optical response with growing disorder and temperature, and track the polaron `delocalisation' with increasing magnetic field.

Title: Evolutionary chemical learning in dimerization networks
Authors: Alexei V. Tkachenko, Bortolo Matteo Mognetti, Sergei Maslov
Abstract: We present a novel framework for chemical learning based on Competitive Dimerization Networks (CDNs) - systems in which multiple molecular species, e.g. proteins or DNA/RNA oligomers, reversibly bind to form dimers. We show that these networks can be trained in vitro through directed evolution, enabling the implementation of complex learning tasks such as multiclass classification without digital hardware or explicit parameter tuning. Each molecular species functions analogously to a neuron, with binding affinities acting as tunable synaptic weights. A training protocol involving mutation, selection, and amplification of DNA-based components allows CDNs to robustly discriminate among noisy input patterns. The resulting classifiers exhibit strong output contrast and high mutual information between input and output, especially when guided by a contrast-enhancing loss function. Comparative analysis with in silico gradient descent training reveals closely correlated performance. These results establish CDNs as a promising platform for analog physical computation, bridging synthetic biology and machine learning, and advancing the development of adaptive, energy-efficient molecular computing systems.

Title: Structural Inhomogeneities and Suppressed Magneto-Structural Coupling in Mn-Substituted GeCo2O4
Authors: Shivani Sharma, Pooja Jain, Benny Schundelmier, Chin-Wei Wang, Poonam Yadav, Adrienn Maria Szucs, Kaya Wei, N. P. Lalla, Theo Siegrist
Abstract: A comprehensive study of Ge1-xMnxCo2O4 (GMCO) system was conducted using neutron powder diffraction (NPD), x-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning electron microscopy, magnetometry, and heat capacity measurements. Comparative analysis with GeCo2O4 (GCO) highlights the influence of Mn substitution on the crystal and magnetic structure at low temperature. Surprisingly, phase separation is observed in GMCO with a targeted nominal composition of Ge0.5Mn0.5Co2O4. SEM/EDX analysis reveals that the sample predominantly consists of a Mn-rich primary phase with approximate stoichiometry Mn0.74Ge0.18Co2O4, along with a minor Ge-rich secondary phase of composition Ge0.91Mn0.19Co2O4. Although both GCO and GMCO crystallize in cubic symmetry at room temperature, a substantial difference in low-temperature structural properties has been observed. Magnetic and heat capacity data indicate ferrimagnetic ordering in the Mn-rich phase near TC = 108 K, while the Ge-rich phase exhibits antiferromagnetic order at TN = 22 K in GMCO. Analysis of heat capacity data reveals that the estimated magnetic entropy amounts to only 63% of the theoretical value expected in GMCO. A collinear ferrimagnetic arrangement is observed in the Mn rich phase below the magnetic ordering temperature, characterized by antiparallel spins of the Mn at A site and Co at B site along the c-direction. At 5 K, the refined magnetic moments are 2.31(3) for MnA and 1.82(3) uB for CoB in the Mn rich ferrimagnetic phase. The magnetic structure at 5 K in the Ge rich secondary phase is identical to the antiferromagnetic structure of the parent compound GeCo2O4. The refined value of the CoB moment in this phase at 5 K is 2.53(3) uB.

Title: The phenomenological renormalization group in neuronal models near criticality
Authors: Kaio F. R. Nascimento, Daniel M. Castro, Gustavo G. Cambrainha, Mauro Copelli
Abstract: The phenomenological renormalization group (PRG) has been applied to the study of scaleinvariant phenomena in neuronal data, providing evidence for critical phenomena in the brain. However, it remains unclear how reliably these observed signatures indicate genuine critical behavior, as it is not well established how close to criticality a system must be for them to emerge. Here, we rely on neuronal models with known critical points to investigate under which conditions the PRG procedure yields consistent results. We discuss how the time-binning step of data preprocessing can crucially affect the final results, and propose a data-driven method to adapt the time bin in order to circumvent this issue. Under these conditions, the PRG method only detects scaling behavior in neuronal models within a very narrow range of the critical point, lending credence to the conclusions drawn from PRG results in experimental data.

Title: Emergence of Chern metal in a moir√© Kondo lattice
Authors: Wenjin Zhao, Zui Tao, Yichi Zhang, Bowen Shen, Zhongdong Han, Patrick Kn√ºppel, Yihang Zeng, Zhengchao Xia, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Jie Shan, Kin Fai Mak
Abstract: A Chern metal is a two-dimensional metallic state of matter carrying chiral edge states. It can emerge as a doped Chern insulator, but theoretical studies have also predicted its emergence near a Kondo breakdown separating a metallic chiral spin liquid and a heavy Fermi liquid in a frustrated lattice. To date, the latter exotic scenario has not been realized. Here, we report the observation of a Chern metal at the onset of the magnetic Kondo breakdown in a frustrated moir√© Kondo lattice--angle-aligned MoTe2/WSe2 bilayers. The state is compressible and is manifested by a nearly quantized Hall resistance but a finite longitudinal resistance that arises from a bad metallic bulk. The state also separates an itinerant and a heavy Fermi liquid and appears far away from the band inversion critical point of the material, thus ruling out its origin from simply doping a Chern insulator. We demonstrate the presence of a chiral edge state by nonlocal transport measurements and current-induced quantum anomalous Hall breakdown. Magnetic circular dichroism measurements further reveal a magnetization plateau for the Chern metal before a metamagnetic transition at the Kondo breakdown. Our results open an opportunity for moir√© engineering of exotic quantum phases of matter through the close interplay between band topology and Kondo interactions.

Title: Electronic nematic normal and superconducting state in electron-doped copper-oxide superconductors
Authors: J.Y. Shen, G.F. Chen, Y.C. Zhang, G.Y. Xi, J.Y. He, X.B. Cheng, J. Wu
Abstract: The similarities and differences between hole- and electron-doped cuprates are central to studies of high-temperature superconductivity. While electronic nematicity is found to be pervasive in hole-doped cuprates, iron-based superconductors, and other unconventional superconductors, evidence for electronic nematicity in electron-doped cuprates remains elusive. Here, we discover that the normal state of electron-doped Sr0.9La0.1CuO2 (SLCO) is nematic by the angle-resolved resistivity (ARR) method and the uncovered ground state at zero temperature is also nematic when superconductivity is suppressed by an applied magnetic field. As we deliberately change the substrate from tetragonal KTaO3(001) (KTO) to orthorhombic GdScO3(110) (GSO), the nematic director of SLCO is pinned by the epitaxial strain but the nematic amplitude remains roughly the same, implying that the nematicity originates from electron-electron correlations. The nematicity is significantly enhanced by the presence of superconducting fluctuations and its amplitude increases appreciably as the effective doping level of SLCO is lowered from optimal to underdoped. Thus, electronic nematicity is intrinsic to high-temperature superconductors regardless of differences in the structural and electronic configurations corresponding to hole or electron doping.

Title: Asymmetric Diffusion of Chiral Skyrmions
Authors: X. Zhang, C. Reichhardt, C.J.O. Reichhardt, Y. Zhou, Y. Xu, M. Mochizuki
Abstract: Brownian dynamics of chiral matter in chiral environment may give rise to emergent phenomena that could not be observed in achiral environment. Here, we report the asymmetric diffusion of chiral skyrmions in two chambers separated by a chiral gate. The topology-determined Brownian gyromotion of skyrmions could lead to effective interactions between skyrmions and chamber walls with a sense of clockwise or counter-clockwise rotation. By fabricating a chiral gate separating two chambers, skyrmions could demonstrate asymmetric diffusion through the gate to approach a nonequilibrium state before reaching the thermal equilibrium. We focus on the asymmetric diffusion of skyrmions that depends on the gate chirality and opening width. Although the simulated diffusion of skyrmions is affected by the skyrmion density, which varies with time due to the diffusion and annihilation, the simulated outcomes are generally in line with simple theories assuming time-independent diffusion rates. Our results uncover asymmetric diffusive behaviors of chiral skyrmions interacting with chiral nanostructures, which will appeal to the wide audience interested in hard condensed matter systems, magnetism, active matter, and statistical physics.

Title: Misfit layered superconductor (PbSe)1.14(NbSe2)3 with possible layer-selective FFLO state
Authors: Yuki M. Itahashi, Yamato Nohara, Michiya Chazono, Hideki Matsuoka, Koichiro Arioka, Tetsuya Nomoto, Yoshimitsu Kohama, Youichi Yanase, Yoshihiro Iwasa, Kaya Kobayashi
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) superconductors are known for their novel emergent phenomena, however, lack of experimental probes beyond resistivity has hindered further exploration of diverse superconducting states. Bulk 2D superconductors, with superconducting layers separated by non-superconducting layers, offer a unique opportunity to break this limit. Here, we synthesized a single crystal of misfit layered compound (PbSe)1.14(NbSe2)3, composed of alternately stacked tri-layer NbSe2 and non-superconducting block layers with incompatible unit cells. Due to its unique structure, 2D Ising superconductivity is maintained even in a bulk form. Resistivity and tunnel diode oscillator measurements reveal two distinct superconducting phases in magnetic field vs. temperature phase diagram. Combined with the theoretical analysis, the high-magnetic-field phase is identified as a layer-selective Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) phase, where Ising and finite-q superconductivity are mixed due to the tri-layer structure. Bulk 2D superconductors with misfit structure offer a novel opportunity for understanding of 2D superconductivity through bulk measurements and interlayer engineering.

Title: Compositional fluctuations and polymorph selection in crystallization of model soft colloids
Authors: Abhilasha Kumari, Gadha Ramesh, Debasish Koner, Rakesh S. Singh, Mantu Santra
Abstract: Understanding polymorph selection in atomic and molecular systems and its control through thermodynamic conditions and external factors (such as seed characteristics) is fundamental to the design of targeted materials and holds great significance in materials sciences. In this work, using Monte Carlo simulations on the Gaussian Core Model and Hard-Core Yukawa colloidal systems, we investigated the control of polymorph selection and explored the underlying mechanisms by tuning thermodynamic parameters. We demonstrate that by carefully modifying the free energy landscape to render the globally stable face-centered cubic (FCC) phase metastable with respect to the body-centered cubic (BCC) phase, the polymorphic identity of particles transitions from FCC-dominated to BCC-dominated via an intermediate regime where both phases nucleate -- either selectively or competitively -- giving rise to a critical-like composition fluctuation of the growing solid-like cluster during the nucleation process. We further probed the critical solid-like cluster compositions, especially in the vicinity of the triple point where the three phases coexist, and observed an interpenetrating arrangement of FCC- and BCC-like particles rather than a commonly observed non-classical core-shell-like two-step nucleation scenario. In addition, we investigated the polymorph selection signatures encoded in local structural fluctuations of the metastable fluid using a machine learning approach based on structural descriptors derived from persistent homology, a topological data analysis method. We believe that the insights gained from this work have the potential to add to the ongoing efforts to control crystallization pathways to obtain the desired functional material.

Title: Resolving Phonons in Superconductor Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+Œ¥ at Sub-Unit-Cell Resolution
Authors: Xiaowen Zhang, Jiade Li, Xiaoyue Gao, Ruochen Shi, Bo Han, Xiaomei Li, Jinlong Du, Jinsheng Wen, Genda Gu, Shichong Wang, Wentao Zhang, Peng Gao
Abstract: The role of phonons in cuprates remains controversial, with their complex lattice structure complicating the investigation. Here, we identify phonon modes originating from charge reservoir and superconducting layers of Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+{\delta} using sub-unit-cell resolved electron energy loss spectroscopy in a scanning transmission electron microscope. We reveal several phonon modes exhibiting layer-specific localization: ~78 meV in-plane modes localized in the CuO2 planes, ~42 meV hybrid (in-plane and out-of-plane) modes in the CuO2 planes, and ~38 meV hybrid modes in the BiO layers. We also observe a periodic modulation of phonon frequencies induced by the superstructure, spatially correlating with the superconducting gap variation. Our findings offer new insights into the electron-phonon coupling in cuprates, fostering deeper exploration of the microscopic linkage between lattice dynamics and superconductivity.

Title: Singular flat bands in three dimensions: Landau level spreading, quantum geometry, and Weyl reconstruction
Authors: Takuto Kawakami, Yuji Igarashi, Mikito Koshino
Abstract: We theoretically investigate three-dimensional singular flat band systems, focusing on their quantum geometric properties and response to external magnetic fields. As a representative example, we study the pyrochlore lattice, which hosts a pair of degenerate flat bands touching a dispersive band. We derive a three-orbital effective continuum model that captures the essential features near the band-touching point. Within this framework, we identify the point-like topological singularity on a planar manifold defined by the degenerate flat band eigenvectors. This singularity strongly influences the quantum geometry and results in a characteristic Landau level structure, where the levels spread over a finite energy range. We show that this structure reflects the underlying band reconstruction due to the orbital Zeeman effect, which lifts the flat band degeneracy and induces the Weyl-semimetal-like dispersion near the singularity. Our analysis reveals that the range of Landau level spreading is proportional to the quantum metric of each Zeeman-split band. We further demonstrate that adding a small dispersion via longer-range . Finally, we show that our approach extends naturally to systems with higher orbital angular momentum, indicating the robustness of these features in a broad class of three-dimensional flat band models.

Title: Enhancing gate control and mitigating short channel effects in 20-50 nm channel length single-gate amorphous oxide Thin Film Transistors
Authors: Chankeun Yoon, Yuchen Zhou, Ananth Dodabalapur
Abstract: Field-effect transistors (FETs) with single gates are adversely affected by short channel effects such as drain-induced barrier lowering (DIBL) and increases in the magnitude of sub-threshold swing as the channel length is reduced. Dual-gate and gate-all-around geometries are often employed to improve gate control in very short channel length transistors. This can introduce significant process complexity to the device fabrication compared to single-gate transistors. It is shown in this paper that substantial reductions in short channel effects are possible in single-gate field-effect transistors with indium gallium zinc oxide semiconductor channels by modifying the design of the source and drain electrodes to possess an array of tapered tips which are designated as nanospike electrodes. 20-25 nm channel length FETs with nanospike electrodes have DIBL and other key metrics that are comparable to those in much larger (70-80 nm) channel length FETs with a conventional source/drain electrode design. These improvements stem from better gate control near the source and drain electrode tips due to the shape of these electrodes. These bottom gate FETs had a gate insulator consisting of 9 nm thick Al2O3 and independent Ni gates. This design approach is expected to be very helpful for a variety of semiconductor technologies being considered for back-end-of-line (BEOL) applications.

Title: Hetero-Orbital Two-Component Fractional Quantum Hall States in Bilayer Graphene
Authors: Ke Huang, Ajit C. Balram, Hailong Fu, Chengqi Guo, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Jainendra K. Jain, Jun Zhu
Abstract: A two-dimensional electron system exposed to a strong magnetic field produces a plethora of strongly interacting fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states, the complex topological orders of which are revealed through exotic emergent particles, such as composite fermions, fractionally charged Abelian and non-Abelian anyons. Much insight has been gained by the study of multi-component FQH states, where spin and pseudospin indices of the electron contribute additional correlation. Traditional multi-component FQH states develop in situations where the components share the same orbital states and the resulting interactions are pseudospin independent; this homo-orbital nature was also crucial to their theoretical understanding. Here, we study "hetero-orbital" two-component FQH states, in which the orbital index is part of the pseudospin, rendering the multi-component interactions strongly SU(2) anisotropic in the pseudospin space. Such states, obtained in bilayer graphene at the isospin transition between N = 0 and N = 1 electron Landau levels, are markedly different from previous homo-orbital two-component FQH states. In particular, we observe strikingly different behaviors for the parallel-flux and reverse-flux composite fermion states, and an anomalously strong two-component 2/5 state over a wide range of magnetic field before it abruptly disappears at a high field. Our findings, combined with detailed theoretical calculations, reveal the surprising robustness of the hetero-orbital FQH effects, significantly enriching our understanding of FQH physics in this novel regime.

Title: Breakdown of the Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem in Kinetic Ising Models
Authors: Parbati Saha, Sanjay Puri, Varsha Banerjee
Abstract: Out-of-equilibrium dynamics, even in the simplest spin models, is still not well understood. The celebrated {\it fluctuation dissipation theorem} (FDT) does not hold for non-equilibrium systems. In this context, Cugliandolo and Kurchan introduced a generalized FDT which elucidates the non-equilibrium evolution as a composition of {\it time sectors} corresponding to different {\it effective temperatures}. We address these evaluations in the $d=2$ long-range Ising model (LRIM), which surprisingly still has many lessons to teach. In particular, we investigate how interactions and conservation laws affect the non-equilibrium dynamics that is initiated by coarsening experiments. Quantifying the deviations from FDT in terms of $T_{eff}$, we find different aging scenarios for short- and long-range IM with non-conserved (Glauber) dynamics and conserved (Kawasaki) dynamics.

Title: Isostructural electronic transition in MoS$_2$ probed by solid-state high harmonic generation spectroscopy
Authors: Bailey R. Nebgen, Victor Chang Lee, Jacob A. Spies, Randy M. Sterbentz, Craig P. Schwartz, Dean Smith, Diana Y. Qiu, Michael W. Zuerch
Abstract: Studying materials under extreme pressure in diamond anvil cells (DACs) is key to discovering new states of matter, yet no method currently allows the direct measurement of the electronic structure in this environment. Solid-state high harmonic generation (sHHG) offers a new all-optical window into the electronic structure of materials. We demonstrate sHHG spectroscopy inside a DAC by probing $2H$-MoS$_2$, up to 30 GPa, revealing a pressure-induced crossover of the lowest direct bandgap from the $\textbf{K}$-point to the $\Gamma$-point. This transition manifests as a sharp minimum in harmonic intensity and a 30¬∞ rotation of the sHHG polarization anisotropy, despite the absence of a structural phase change. First-principles simulations attribute these features to interference between competing excitation pathways at distinct points in the Brillouin zone. Our results establish sHHG as a sensitive probe of electronic transitions at high pressure, enabling access to quantum phenomena that evade detection by conventional techniques.

Title: Non-Hermitian topological electric circuits with projective symmetry
Authors: Wenjie Zhang, Yuting Yang, Xiaopeng Shen, Liwei Shi, Zhi Hong Hang
Abstract: Non-Hermitian topological insulators have attracted considerable attention due to their distinctive energy band characteristics and promising applications. Here, we systematically investigate non-Hermitian M√∂bius insulators and graphene-like topological semimetals from the projected symmetry and realize their corresponding topological phenomena in an electric circuit-based framework. By introducing a nonreciprocal hopping term consisting of negative impedance converters into a two-dimensional electric circuit, we establish an experimental platform that effectively demonstrates that introducing non-Hermitian terms significantly enhances the energy localization of topological edge states, which originate from the non-Hermitian skin effect. Furthermore, a thorough comparison of experimental measurements with numerical simulations validates the robustness and reliability of our electric circuit structure. This work not only reveals the physical properties of non-Hermitian topological materials but also provides valuable theoretical and experimental guidance for the implementation of topological circuits and the design of radiofrequency devices in the future.

Title: Controlling energy delivery with bistable nanostructures
Authors: Andreas Ehrmann, Carl P. Goodrich
Abstract: Countless biological processes are fueled by energy-rich molecules like ATP and GTP that supply energy with extreme efficiency. However, designing similar energy-delivery schemes from the bottom up, essential for the development of powered nanostructures and other {\it de novo} machinery, presents a significant challenge: how can an energy-rich structure be stable in solution yet still deliver this energy at precisely the right time? In this paper, we present a purely physical mechanism that solves this challenge, facilitating energy transfer akin to ATP hydrolysis, yet occurring between synthetic nanostructures without any biochemical interactions. This targeted energy delivery is achieved by exploiting a differentiable state-based model to balance the energy profiles that govern the structural transitions in the two nanostructures, creating a combined relaxation pathway with minimal barriers that facilitates energy delivery. We verify the effectiveness and robustness of this mechanism through Molecular Dynamics simulations, demonstrating that a bath of the high-energy structures can systematically and repeatedly drive the target structure out of equilibrium, enabling it to perform tasks. As the mechanism operates only through explicit physical forces without any biochemistry or internal state variables, our results present generic and far-reaching design principles, setting the stage for the next generation of synthetic nanomachines.

Title: Noncentrosymmetric High-Temperature Superconductivity in doped $d^9$ Multiferroics
Authors: Hu Zhang
Abstract: Multiferroics with $d^9$ electronic configurations, such as $SnCuO_2$, $PbCuO_2$, and $BiNiO_2$, exhibit coexisting antiferromagnetic order and ferroelectricity. Motivated by the fundamental link between symmetry breaking, strong electron correlations, and unconventional superconductivity, we propose a materials design strategy targeting noncentrosymmetric high-temperature superconductors through chemical doping of engineered $d^9$ multiferroics. This approach bridges two phenomena: (i) the coexistence of antiferromagnetism and ferroelectricity in correlated insulators, and (ii) the emergence of superconductivity in doped Mott/charge-transfer systems.

Title: Random organization criticality with long-range hydrodynamic interactions
Authors: Tristan Jocteur, Cesare Nardini, Eric Bertin, Romain Mari
Abstract: Driven soft athermal systems may display a reversible-irreversible transition between an absorbing, arrested state and an active phase where a steady-state dynamics sets in. A paradigmatic example consists in cyclically sheared suspensions under stroboscopic observation, for which in absence of contacts during a shear cycle particle trajectories are reversible and the stroboscopic dynamics is frozen, while contacts lead to diffusive stroboscopic motion. The Random Organization Model (ROM), which is a minimal model of the transition, shows a transition which falls into the Conserved Directed Percolation (CDP) universality class. However, the ROM ignores hydrodynamic interactions between suspended particles, which make contacts a source of long-range mechanical noise that in turn can create new contacts. Here, we generalize the ROM to include long-range interactions decaying like inverse power laws of the distance. Critical properties continuously depend on the decay exponent when it is smaller than the space dimension. Upon increasing the interaction range, the transition turns convex (that is, with an order parameter exponent $\beta > 1$), fluctuations turn from diverging to vanishing, and hyperuniformity at the transition disappears. We rationalize this critical behavior using a local mean-field model describing how particle contacts are created via mechanical noise, showing that diffusive motion induced by long-range interactions becomes dominant for slowly-decaying interactions.

Title: Unraveling structural and magnetic information during growth of nanocrystalline SrFe12O19
Authors: Cecilia Granados-Miralles, Matilde Saura-M√∫zquiz, Espen D. B√∏jesen, Kirsten M. √ò. Jensen, Henrik L. Andersen, Mogens Christensen
Abstract: The hydrothermal synthesis of magnetic strontium hexaferrite (SrFe12O19) nanocrystallites was followed in situ using synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction. For all the studied temperatures, the formation of SrFe12O19 happened through an intermediate crystalline phase, identified as the so-called six-line ferrihydrite (FeOOH). The presence of FeOOH has been overlooked in previous studies on hydrothermally synthesized SrFe12O19, despite the phase having a non-trivial influence on the magnetic properties of the final material. The chemical synthesis was successfully reproduced ex situ in a custom-designed batch-type reactor that resembles the experimental conditions of the in situ setup, while allowing larger quantities of material to be produced. The agreement in phase composition between the two studies reveals comparability between both experimental setups. Hexagonal platelet morphology is confirmed for SrFe12O19 combining Rietveld refinements of powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) data with transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Room temperature magnetization curves were measured on the nanopowders prepared ex situ. The magnetic properties are discussed in the context of the influence of phase composition and crystallite size.

Title: Doping dependence of the low temperature planar carrier density in overdoped YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-Œ¥}$
Authors: Rebecca Nicholls, Roemer Hinlopen, Jake Ayres, Tommy Kotte, Tobias Forster, Joonbum Park, Jeremy Sourd, Antony Carrington, Nigel Hussey
Abstract: Whether a quantum critical point (QCP) demarcates the end of the pseudogap (PG) regime in hole-doped cuprates at a singular doping level $p^* \approx 0.19$ remains an open question. A crucial part of this puzzle is how the carrier density predicted by electronic structure calculations is recovered for $p > p^*$. Here, we use magnetic fields up to 67 T to suppress superconductivity down to 50 K, allowing simultaneous measurement of the low-temperature Hall number $n_{\mathrm{H}}$ and the in-plane resistivity anisotropy $\rho_a/\rho_b$ in overdoped Y$_{1-x}$Ca$_x$Ba$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ single crystals. We confirm a previous finding [Badoux et al., Nature 531, 210 (2016)] that $n_{\mathrm{H}}$(50 K) exhibits a sharp increase below $p^*$. Using the measured resistivity anisotropy, we extract the planar carrier density $n_{\mathrm{pl}} = n_{\mathrm{H}} (\rho_a/\rho_b)^{-1}$. The doping dependence of $n_{\mathrm{pl}}$(50 K) reveals two key findings: (i) at optimal doping, $n_{\mathrm{pl}} \approx p$, and (ii) the sharp rise in $n_{\mathrm{H}}(p)$ is softened such that the full Fermi volume ($n_{\mathrm{pl}} = 1 + p$) is only partially recovered at $p^*$. This result disfavors a conventional QCP scenario in which the PG endpoint corresponds to a reconstructed Fermi surface.

Title: Coupling Anisotropic Curvature and Nematic Order: Mechanisms of Membrane Shape Remodeling
Authors: Yoav Ravid, Samo Peniƒç, Luka Mesarec, Nir S. Gov, Veronika Kralj-Igliƒç, Ale≈° Igliƒç, Mitja Drab
Abstract: This study theoretically investigates how anisotropic curved membrane components (CMCs) control vesicle morphology through curvature sensing, nematic alignment, topological defects, and volume constraints. By comparing arc-shaped and saddle-shaped CMCs, we identify a rich spectrum of steady-state phases. For fully CMC-covered vesicles, arc-shaped components drive a pearling-to-cylinder transition as nematic interactions strengthen, while on partially CMC-covered vesicles, the saddle-shaped CMCs stabilize necks between the convex regions of bare membrane. We map the steady-state shapes of vesicles partially covered by arc-like and saddle-shaped CMCs, exposing how different vesicle shapes depend on the interplay between nematic interactions and volume constraints, revealing several novel phases. By investigating the in-plane nematic field, we find that topological defects consistently localize to high-curvature regions, revealing how intrinsic and deviatoric curvature effects cooperate in membrane remodeling. These findings establish a unified framework for understanding how proteins and lipid domains with anisotropic intrinsic curvature shape cellular structures -- from organelle morphogenesis to global cell shape.

Title: Scaling and Universality at Noisy Quench Dynamical Quantum Phase Transitions
Authors: Saeid Ansari, R. Jafari, Alireza Akbari, Mehdi Abdi
Abstract: Dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) have been studied in the extended XY model under both noiseless and noisy linear driven staggered field cases. In the time-independent staggered field case, the model exhibits a single critical point where the transition occurs from the spin-liquid phase to the antiferromagnetic phase. In the noiseless ramp case, unlike the transverse field XY model where DQPT always occurs for a quench crossing the single critical point, there is a critical sweep velocity above which the kinks corresponding to a DQPT are completely removed. Furthermore, in this case there are only two critical modes whose excitation probability is one-half. In the presence of a Gaussian white noise, we find that this critical sweep velocity decreases by increasing the noise strength, and scales linearly with the square of the noise intensity. A surprising result occurs when the noise intensity and sweep velocity are about the same order of magnitude, the number of critical modes is significantly increased, signalling a region with multiple critical modes. Furthermore, our findings indicate that the scaling of the dynamical free energy near the DQPTs time is the same for both noiseless and noisy ramp quenches.

Title: Dynamical Phase diagram of the Quantum Ising model with Cluster Interaction Under Noisy and Noiseless Driven field
Authors: Sasan Kheiri, R. Jafari, S. Mahdavifar, Ehsan Nedaaee Oskoee, Alireza Akbari
Abstract: In most lattice models, gap closing typically occurs at high-symmetry points in the Brillouin zone. In the transverse field Ising model with cluster interaction, besides the gap closing at high-symmetry points, the gap closing at the quantum phase transition between paramagnetic and cluster phases of the model can be moved by tuning the strength of the cluster interaction. We take advantage of this property to examine the nonequilibrium dynamics of the model in the framework of dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) after a noiseless and noisy ramp of the transverse magnetic field. The numerical results show that DQPTs always happen if the starting or ending point of the quench field is restricted between two critical points. In other ways, there is always critical sweep velocity above which DQPTs disappear. Our finding reveals that noise modifies drastically the dynamical phase diagram of the model. We find that the critical sweep velocity decreases by enhancing the noise intensity and scales linearly with the square of noise intensity for weak and strong noise. Moreover, the region with multi-critical modes induced in the dynamical phase diagram by noise. The sweep velocity under which the system enters the multi-critical modes (MCMs) region increases by enhancing the noise and scales linearly with the square of noise intensity

Title: Reconfigurable three dimensional magnetic nanoarchitectures
Authors: Sabri Koraltan, Fabrizio Porrati, Robert Kraft, Sven Barth, Markus Weigand, Claas Abert, Dieter Suess, Michael Huth, Sebastian Wintz
Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) nanomagnetism is a rapidly developing field within magnetic materials research, where exploiting the third dimension unlocks opportunities for innovative applications in areas such as sensing, data storage, and neuromorphic computing. Among various fabrication techniques, focused electron beam-induced deposition (FEBID) offers high flexibility in creating complex 3D nanostructures with sub-100 nm resolution. A key challenge in the development of 3D nanomagnets is the ability to locally control the magnetic configuration, which is essential to achieve desired functionalities. In this work, the magnetization reversal mechanism of a three-dimensional nanoarchitecture fabricated using focused electron beam-induced deposition is investigated by combining direct observation via scanning transmission X-ray microscopy with finite element micromagnetic simulations. In particular, our investigation shows that the magnetization of the components of a three-dimensional Co3 Fe tetrapod can be reversed individually and sequentially. Finally, it is demonstrated that complete control and reconfigurability of the system can be achieved by tuning the direction of the applied magnetic field.

Title: A Spintronic Battery with Reversible Modulation of Spin Polarization through Li Charge/Discharge: A First Principles Computational Modelling Case Study for an Antiperovskite System
Authors: Sk Mujaffer Hossain, Vinila Bedekara, Priyanka Yadavb, Ram Janay Chudhary, Satishchandra Ogale
Abstract: A key notion defining the progress of the emergent fields of modern electronics, renewable energy, and smart systems is charge storage, which is primarily embodied in various battery chemistries and systems. In addition to the charge property, the electron also has the spin property, which is exploited in the field of spintronics to access novel magnetically controlled device actions that are not accessible to conventional electronics. An interesting question is whether the two can be fruitfully integrated into a single device concept to expand the horizon of device design and applications. Herein, we present a combined experimental and theoretical study of virgin and lithiated conducting intermetallic anti-perovskite with nominal stoichiometry represented as LixFe3SnC (x = 1, 2, 3, 4) to establish the principle of reversible and concurrent charge and spin polarization storage that can be aptly christened as Iono-Spintronics, representing a notion of a spintronic battery. The experimental results, however, showed that lithiation turns the system into a biphasic state comprised of tin-lithium alloy (due to the high affinity of Sn for Li) along with lithiated Fe3C. The process exhibits multiple cyclability (rechargeability).

Title: Cyclically sheared colloidal gels: structural change and delayed failure time
Authors: Himangsu Bhaumik, James E. Hallett, Tanniemola B. Liverpool, Robert L. Jack, C. Patrick Royall
Abstract: We present experiments and simulations on cyclically sheared colloidal gels, and probe their behaviour on several different length scales. The shearing induces structural changes in the experimental gel, changing particles' neighborhoods and reorganizing the mesoscopic pores. These results are mirrored in computer simulations of a model gel-former, which show how the material evolves down the energy landscape under shearing, for small strains. By systematic variation of simulation parameters, we characterise the structural and mechanical changes that take place under shear, including both yielding and strain-hardening. We simulate creeping flow under constant shear stress, for gels that were previously subject to cyclic shear, showing that strain-hardening also increases gel stability. This response depends on the orientation of the applied shear stress, revealing that the cyclic shear imprints anisotropic structural features into the gel.

Title: Thermodynamic control of non-equilibrium systems
Authors: Dana Kamp, Karel Proesmans
Abstract: We study the thermodynamic cost associated with driving systems between different non-equilibrium steady states. In particular, we combine a linear-response framework for non-equilibrium Markov systems with Lagrangian techniques to minimize the dissipation associated with driving processes. We then apply our framework to a simple toy model. Our results show several remarkable properties for the optimal protocol, such as diverging parameters and finite entropy production in the slow-driving limit.

Title: Polarization switching on the open surfaces of the wurtzite ferroelectric nitrides: ferroelectric subsystems and electrochemical reactivity
Authors: Yongtao Liu, Anton V. Ievlev, Eugene A. Eliseev, Nana Sun, Kazuki Okamoto, Hiroshi Funakubo, Anna N. Morozovska, Sergei Kalinin
Abstract: Binary ferroelectric nitrides are promising materials for information technologies and power electronics. However, polarization switching in these materials is highly unusual. From the structural perspective, polarization reversal is associated with the change of the effective polarity at the surfaces and interfaces from N-to-M terminated, suggesting strong coupling between ferroelectric and chemical phenomena. Phenomenologically, macroscopic studies demonstrate the presence of complex time dependent phenomena including wake-up. Here, we explore the polarization switching using the multidimensional high-resolution piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) and spectroscopy, detecting both the evolution of induced ferroelectric domain, electromechanical response, and surface deformation during first-order reversal curve measurements. We demonstrate the presence of two weakly coupled ferroelectric subsystems and the bias-induced electrochemical reactivity. The observed behaviors are very similar to the recent studies of other wurtzite system but additionally include electrochemical reactivity, suggesting the universality of these behaviors for the wurtzite binary ferroelectrics. These studies suggest potential of high-resolution multimodal PFM spectroscopies to resolve complex coupled polarization dynamics in materials. Furthermore, these PFM based studies are fully consistent with the recent electron microscopy observations of the shark-teeth like ferroelectric domains in nitrides. Hence, we believe that these studies establish the universal phenomenological picture of polarization switching in binary wurtzite.

Title: Signature of current-induced nuclear spin polarization in (Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_{x}$)$_2$Te$_3$
Authors: Sofie K√∂lling, ƒ∞nan√ß Adagideli, Alexander Brinkman
Abstract: In systems with spin-momentum locking, such as the surface states of three-dimensional topological insulators, a charge current is spin-polarized and spin-flip interactions between electron and nuclear spins can transfer this polarization to the nuclear spin system. When a nonzero bias voltage is applied, the nuclear polarization reaches a steady-state value. This polarization emerges as an effective in-plane magnetic field acting on electrons, called the Overhauser field, which causes an offset in-plane magnetoresistance perpendicular to the current, visible in experiments. The in-plane offset is measured in the three-dimensional topological insulator \bsttight, and the magnitude of the magnetic field offset is compared to the Overhauser field. We attribute the observed magnetic field offset to current-induced nuclear polarization in \bsttight, which forms an important step towards experimentally realizing an entropic inductor.

Title: From Attraction to Repulsion: Emergent Interactions in Harmonically Coupled Active Binary System
Authors: Ritwick Sarkar, Sreya Chatterjee, Urna Basu
Abstract: We investigate the emergent interactions between two active Brownian particles coupled by an attractive harmonic potential and in contact with a thermal reservoir. By analyzing the stationary distribution of their separation, we demonstrate that the effective interaction can be either attractive or repulsive, depending on the interplay between activity, coupling strength, and temperature. Notably, we find that an effective short-range repulsion emerges in the strong and moderate-coupling regimes, when the temperature is below some threshold value, which we characterize analytically. In the strong-coupling regime, the repulsion emerges due to the difference in the self-propulsion speeds of the particles. We also compute the short-time position distribution of the centroid of the coupled particles, which shows strongly non-Gaussian fluctuations at low temperatures.

Title: Multisubband Plasmons in InAs/GaSb Broken Gap Quantum Well
Authors: Wojciech Julian Pasek, Soufiane Hajji, Oussama Tata, Laurent Cerutti, Fernando Gonzalez-posada Flores, Simon Hurand, Abdelouahed El Fatimy, Thierry Taliercio
Abstract: Multi-subband plasmon (MSP) modes in heavily doped InAs/GaSb broken-gap quantum wells grown via molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) are investigated. An $8$-band $\vec{k} \cdot \vec{p}$ semiclassical model accurately predicts ellipsometric spectra, reflecting strong subband hybridization and non-parabolicity. In contrast, single-band plasmon models show qualitative discrepancies with experiment, even with adjusted effective masses. These findings highlight the potential of broken-gap wells for quantum technologies leveraging interband coupling and wavefunction hybridization.

Title: In situ growth of a type-II ZnO/ZnS heterostructure:From stability to band-offset
Authors: P. R. A de Oliveira, I. Coelho, G. Felix, P. Venezuela, F. Stavale
Abstract: We have successfully obtained a ZnO/ZnS heterostructure by heating a ZnS(001) single crystal in a controlled impurities-free oxygen atmosphere. Combining X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and atomic force microscopy (AFM), we explore the stability, electronic structure, and morphology of that interface. Our XPS measurements reveal a binding energy shift of the core-level peaks, indicating a band-bending effect due to the formation of a hybrid ZnO/ZnS interface. In addition, AFM measurements show that exposure of ZnS single-crystal to an oxygen atmosphere leads to the formation of ZnO/ZnS-like islands. Interestingly, our band-offset estimation suggest a type-II heterostructure arrangement with suitable electronic edges positions that turn ZnO/ZnS heterostructure a promising platform for catalytic applications, particularly hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions.

Title: Absorbance marker: Detection of quantum geometry and spread of Wannier function in disordered 2D semiconductors
Authors: Luis F. C√°rdenas-Castillo, Shuai Zhang, Fernando L. Freire Jr., Wei Chen
Abstract: The optical absorbance of 2D semiconductors is generalized to individual lattice sites through the topological marker formalism, yielding an absorbance marker. This marker allows to investigate the atomic scale variation of absorbance caused by impurities, thereby quantifies the influence of disorder on the quantum geometry and the spread of Wannier functions of valence band states. Applying this marker to transition metal dichalcogenides reveals a very localized suppression of absorbance caused by potential impurities, rendering a reduction of absorbance in the macroscopic scale proportional to the impurity density, in good agreement with the experimental results of plasma-treated WS$_{2}$.

Title: Thermal Conductivity Of Monolayer Hexagonal Boron Nitride: Four-Phonon Scattering And Quantum Sampling Effects
Authors: Jos√© Pedro Alvarinhas Batista, Matthieu J. Verstraete, Alo√Øs Castellano
Abstract: Monolayer hexagonal boron nitride is a prototypical planar 2-dimensional system material and has been the subject of many investigations of its exceptional vibrational, spectroscopic and transport properties. The lattice thermal conductivity remains quite uncertain, with theoretical and experimental reports varying between 218 and 1060 Wm-1K-1. It has a strong temperature evolution and is sensitive to strain effects and isotope concentrations. While the impact of isotope scattering has been widely studied and is well understood, nuclear quantum effects and 4-phonon scattering have so far been neglected. Monolayer hexagonal boron nitride is composed of light elements, and further has its 3-phonon scattering phase space restricted by mirror plane symmetry, so these effects may be of similar order as isotope scattering, and would lead to a completely different understanding of the fundamental processes limiting the lattice thermal conductivity for this system. In this work, we use both classical and path-integral molecular dynamics, in conjunction with the Temperature Dependent Effective Potential method, to compute temperature-dependent renormalized phonons including isotope scattering, 3-phonon scattering, 4-phonon scattering and nuclear quantum effects. We show the impact of the latter two on the lattice thermal conductivity for a large temperature range, as well as their impact on the phonon lifetimes. Overall, our work provides a robust framework for calculations of the lattice thermal conductivity in solids, providing quantitative improvements and physical understanding that help explain the variety of results found in the literature.

Title: Coarsening Kinetics in Active Model B+: Macroscale and Microscale Phase Separation
Authors: Pradeep Kumar Yadav, Shradha Mishra, Sanjay Puri
Abstract: We perform a comprehensive numerical investigation of the coarsening kinetics of active Brownian particles modeled by the {\it Active Model B+} (AMB+). This model was introduced by Tjhung et al. [Phys. Rev. X {\bf 8}, 031080 (2018)] and is a generalization of Model B for a conserved order parameter, with two additional activity terms. These terms correspond to rotation-free current (of strength $\lambda$) and rotational current (of strength $\xi$). We find that the presence of rotational current $(\xi \neq 0)$ significantly affects growth kinetics. Depending on the parameter values, AMB+ exhibits either {\it macroscale phase separation} (MPS) or {\it microscale phase separation} ($\mu$PS). We present detailed results for the kinetics of MPS and $\mu$PS in AMB+ with critical composition.

Title: Super-diffusive sub-picosecond extraction of hot carriers in black phosphorous
Authors: Katsumasa Yoshioka, Taro Wakamura, Takuya Okamoto, Norio Kumada
Abstract: Harvesting hot carriers before they lose energy to the lattice is a critical route toward surpassing the conventional thermodynamic limit in optical-to-electrical (O-E) conversion. However, photocurrent from such hot carriers has remained challenging to directly detect because they equilibrate on picosecond timescales, outpacing conventional electronic measurement. Here, by employing terahertz electronics with sub-picosecond temporal resolution, we directly monitor hot-carrier-driven O-E conversion in black phosphorus (BP). Photoexcitation near the metal contact under zero source-drain bias generates an ultrafast photocurrent with a decay time of ~400 fs, orders of magnitude faster than the typical sub-nanosecond energy relaxation in BP, demonstrating a measured 3 dB bandwidth of 260 GHz with an intrinsic limit of ~600 GHz. Notably, this photocurrent flows via energetic holes toward the contact electrode, regardless of the equilibrium carrier type, revealing a super-diffusive hot-carrier extraction mechanism. Furthermore, we show that the ultrafast hot-carrier contribution can coexist with the much slower cold-carrier contribution based on the photovoltaic effect, demonstrating that hot carriers can be harvested without discarding lower-energy carriers. These findings highlight the potential of sub-picosecond hot-carrier extraction to expand the O-E conversion bandwidth without sacrificing efficiency, bridging fundamental hot-carrier physics with ultrahigh-speed technological applications.

Title: Translation symmetry restoration in integrable systems: the noninteracting case
Authors: Molly Gibbins, Adam Smith, Bruno Bertini
Abstract: The study of symmetry restoration has recently emerged as a fruitful means to extract high-level information on the relaxation of quantum many-body systems. This revealed, for instance, the surprising 'quantum Mpemba effect' that occurs when a symmetry is restored more rapidly when the initial configuration is less symmetric. While the restoration of internal symmetries has been investigated intensively, however, the one of spatial symmetries has only been considered recently in the context of random unitary circuits. Here we present a complementary study of translation symmetry restoration in integrable systems. Specifically, we consider non-interacting spinless fermions on the lattice prepared in non-equilibrium states invariant only under $\nu>1$ lattice shifts and follow the restoration of one-site shift invariance. We do so by measuring the Frobenius distance between the state on a subsystem, and its symmetrised counterpart. We compute the latter exactly, using standard Gaussian methods, and formulate a quasiparticle picture -- involving multiplets of $\nu$ correlated quasiparticles -- to describe analytically its asymptotic behaviour. We show that, differently from random unitary circuits where symmetry restoration occurs abruptly for times proportional to the subsystem size, here symmetry is restored smoothly and over timescales of the order of the subsystem size squared. Interestingly, we also show that, in contrast to the case of continuous internal symmetries, the quasiparticle picture does not provide a quantitative description of discrete translation symmetry restoration and that the latter process goes beyond the hydrodynamic description. Our results can directly be extended to higher dimensions.

Title: Hydrodynamic theory of wetting by active particles
Authors: Noah Grodzinski, Robert L. Jack, Michael E. Cates
Abstract: The accumulation of self-propelled particles on repulsive barriers is a widely observed feature in active matter. Despite being implicated in a broad range of biological processes, from biofilm formation to cytoskeletal movement, wetting of surfaces by active particles remains poorly understood. In this work, we study this active wetting by considering a model comprising an active lattice gas, interacting with a permeable barrier under periodic boundary conditions, for which an exact hydrodynamic description is possible. Our model eliminates dynamical noise while retaining microscopic fidelity, enabling a precise characterisation of steady-states and their transitions. We demonstrate that the accumulation of active particles is remarkably similar to equilibrium wetting, and that active wetting transitions retain all the salient characteristics of equilibrium critical wetting - despite fundamental differences in underlying microscopic dynamics. Additionally, we uncover a ratchet mechanism on permeable barriers in active systems, and demonstrate that this gives rise to steady-state currents and a novel transition pathway in active wetting. Our results provide an intrinsically nonequilibrium framework in which to study active wetting, and precisely demonstrate the connection to equilibrium wetting - while clarifying how differences in microscopic dynamics give rise to novel macroscopic behaviour.

Title: 250 Magnetic Tunnel Junctions-Based Probabilistic Ising Machine
Authors: Shuhan Yang, Andrea Grimaldi, Youwei Bao, Eleonora Raimondo, Jia Si, Giovanni Finocchio, Hyunsoo Yang
Abstract: In combinatorial optimization, probabilistic Ising machines (PIMs) have gained significant attention for their acceleration of Monte Carlo sampling with the potential to reduce time-to-solution in finding approximate ground states. However, to be viable in real applications, further improvements in scalability and energy efficiency are necessary. One of the promising paths toward achieving this objective is the development of a co-design approach combining different technology layers including device, circuits and algorithms. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a fully connected PIM architecture based on 250 spin-transfer torque magnetic tunnel junctions (STT-MTJs), interfaced with an FPGA. Our computing approach integrates STT-MTJ-based tunable true random number generators with advanced annealing techniques, enabling the solution of problems with any topology and size. For sparsely connected graphs, the massive parallel architecture of our PIM enables a cluster parallel update method that overcomes the serial limitations of Gibbs sampling, leading to a 10 times acceleration without hardware changes. Furthermore, we prove experimentally that the simulated quantum annealing boosts solution quality 20 times over conventional simulated annealing while also increasing robustness to MTJ variability. Short pulse switching measurements indicate that STT-MTJ-based PIMs can potentially be 10 times faster and 10 times more energy-efficient than graphic processing units, which paves the way for future large-scale, high-performance, and energy-efficient unconventional computing hardware implementations.

Title: Uncertainty in AI-driven Monte Carlo simulations
Authors: Dimitrios Tzivrailis, Alberto Rosso, Eiji Kawasaki
Abstract: In the study of complex systems, evaluating physical observables often requires sampling representative configurations via Monte Carlo techniques. These methods rely on repeated evaluations of the system's energy and force fields, which can become computationally expensive, particularly in the presence of long-range interactions. To accelerate these simulations, deep learning models are increasingly employed as surrogate functions to approximate the energy landscape or force fields. However, such models introduce epistemic uncertainty in their predictions, which may propagate through the sampling process and affect the system's macroscopic behavior. In this work, we present the Penalty Ensemble Method (PEM) to quantify epistemic uncertainty and mitigate its impact on Monte Carlo sampling. Our approach introduces an uncertainty-aware modification of the Metropolis acceptance rule, which increases the rejection probability in regions of high uncertainty, thereby enhancing the reliability of the simulation outcomes.

Title: Anomalous diffusion for mass transport phenomena II: Subdiffusion in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)
Authors: Nathaniel G. Hermann, Dmitry A. Markov, M. Shane Hutson
Abstract: Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is a glassy polymer widely used in biomedical engineering, namely in microfluidics applications. However, PDMS is known to interact with hydrophobic chemicals. This interaction is exacerbated at the scale of microfluidics, making careful modeling of in-device concentrations vital for PDMS-based microfluidic devices. While it has been previously reported that many chemicals diffuse through PDMS, here we report that diffusion in PDMS is anomalous, i.e. characterized by nonlinear, subdiffusive mean-squared displacements (MSD). We show that this anomalous diffusion can be modeled in the framework of stretched-time fractional diffusion, and report the transport parameters for a set of fluorescent tracer dyes. Depending on the device geometry and protocol, this anomalous behavior may have a significant impact, specifically in regards to cross-talk between microfluidic channels.

Title: Mutual effect of charge- and number-density correlations in ionic liquids and concentrated electrolytes
Authors: O. Patsahan, A. Ciach
Abstract: Correlation functions in concentrated ionic systems are studied within the mesoscopic theory at the level of the Gaussian approximation. The previously neglected fluctuation contribution to the inverse charge-charge correlation function is taken into account to verify the accuracy of the previous results. We calculate the correlation lengths and the amplitudes and show that the fluctuation contribution does not lead to significant changes of the results. We also derive necessary conditions for the presence of both, the oscillatory and the monotonic decays of the charge-charge correlations that must be satisfied by the noncoulombic contributions to the inverse charge-charge correlation function. At the level of the Gaussian approximation, these conditions are not satisfied. Extension of the theory beyond the Gaussian approximation is necessary to verify whether the asymptotic decay of the charge-charge correlations is monotonous or oscillatory, as suggested by the surface force apparatus or by the SAXS experiments, respectively.

Title: Predicting the response of structurally altered and asymmetrical networks
Authors: Melvyn Tyloo
Abstract: We investigate how the response of coupled dynamical systems is modified due to a structural alteration of the interaction. The majority of the literature focuses on additive perturbations and symmetrical interaction networks. Here, we consider the challenging problem of multiplicative perturbations and asymmetrical interaction coupling. We introduce a framework to approximate the averaged response at each network node for general structural perturbations, including non-normal and asymmetrical ones. Our findings indicate that both the asymmetry and non-normality of the structural perturbation impact the global and local responses at different orders in time. We propose a set of matrices to identify the nodes whose response is affected the most by the structural alteration.

Title: Replica RISM molecular solvation theory for electric double layer in nanoporous materials
Authors: A. Kovalenko
Abstract: Applications of 3D-RISM-KH molecular solvation theory range from solvation energy of small molecules to phase behavior of polymers and biomolecules. It predicts the molecular mechanisms of chemical and biomolecular systems. Replica RISM-KH-VM molecular solvation theory predicts and explains the structure, thermodynamics, and electrochemistry of electrolyte solutions sorbed in a nanoporous material. It was tested on nanoporous carbon supercapacitors with aqueous electrolyte and nanoporous electrosorption cells. The mechanisms in these systems are steered by the electric double layer potential drop across the Stern layer at the nanopores surface and the Gouy-Chapman layer averaged over the nanoporous material, the osmotic term due to the ionic concentrations difference in the two nanoporous electrodes and in the electrolyte solution outside, and the solvation chemical potentials of sorbed ions averaged over the nanoporous material. The latter strongly depends on chemical specificity of ions, solvent, surface functional groups, and steric effects for solvated ions confined in nanopores.

Title: Liquid-gas state regularities as a manifestation of global isomorphism with the Ising model
Authors: L. A. Bulavin, V. L. Kulinskii, A. M. Katts, A. M. Maslechko
Abstract: Liquid-gas equilibrium is considered using the global isomorphism with the Ising-like (lattice gas) model. Such an approach assumes the existence of the order parameter in terms of which the symmetry of binodal is restored not only in the vicinity of the critical point (critical isomorphism) but also globally in the whole coexistence region. We show how the empirical law of the rectilinear density diameter of the liquid-gas binodal allows us to derive a rather simple form of the isomorphism transformation between the fluid and lattice gas model of Ising-type. The relations for critical parameters which follow from such isomorphism are tested on a variety of fluid systems, both real and model ones. Moreover, we consider the phase equilibrium in polymer solutions and the Flory $\theta$-point as the extreme state of such equilibrium within our approach. The most crucial testing in 2D case is using the Onsager exact solution of the Ising model, and we represent the results of our approach to the calculation of critical point parameters of monolayers for noble gases and the surface tension.

Title: Towards construction of microscopic model for smart coating of a solid surface
Authors: O. Pizio
Abstract: The density functional approach for classical associating fluids is used to explore the wetting phase diagrams for model systems consisting of water and graphite-like solid surfaces chemically modified by a small amount of grafted chain molecules. The water-like fluid model is adopted from the work of Clark et al. [Mol. Phys., 104, 3561 (2006)]. It very well describes the bulk water vapor-liquid coexistence. Each chain molecule consists of tangentially bonded hard sphere segments. We focus on the investigation of the growth of water film on such complex substrates and exploration of the wetting behavior. For grafted monomers, the prewetting phase diagrams are similar to the diagrams for water on a non-modified solid surface. However, for grafted trimers and pentamers, a physically much richer behavior is observed and analyzed. Trends of the behavior of the wetting temperature and the prewetting critical temperature on the grafting density and water-segments attraction are discussed in detail.

Abstract: The prospect of achieving fault-tolerant quantum computing with semiconductor spin qubits in Si/SiGe heterostructures relies on the integration of a large number of identical devices, a feat achievable through a scalable (Bi)CMOS manufacturing approach. To this end, both the gate stack and the Si/SiGe heterostructure must be of high quality, exhibiting uniformity across the wafer and consistent performance across multiple fabrication runs. Here, we report a comprehensive investigation of Si/SiGe heterostructures and gate stacks, fabricated in an industry-standard 200 mm BiCMOS pilot line. We evaluate the homogeneity and reproducibility by probing the properties of the two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in the shallow silicon quantum well through magnetotransport characterization of Hall bar-shaped field-effect transistors at 1.5 K. Across all the probed wafers, we observe minimal variation of the 2DEG properties, with an average maximum mobility of $(4.25\pm0.17)\times 10^{5}$ cm$^{2}$/Vs and low percolation carrier density of $(5.9\pm0.18)\times 10^{10}$ cm$^{-2}$ evidencing low disorder potential in the quantum well. The observed narrow statistical distribution of the transport properties highlights the reproducibility and the stability of the fabrication process. Furthermore, wafer-scale characterization of a selected individual wafer evidenced the homogeneity of the device performances across the wafer area. Based on these findings, we conclude that our material and processes provide a suitable platform for the development of scalable, Si/SiGe-based quantum devices.

Title: Extending the capillary wave model to include the effect of bending rigidity: X-ray reflection and diffuse scattering
Authors: Chen Shen, Honghu Zhang, Beate Kl√∂sgen, Benjamin M. Ocko
Abstract: The surface roughness of a thin film at a liquid interface exhibits contributions of thermally excited fluctuations. This thermal roughness depends on temperature (T), surface tension ($\gamma$) and elastic material properties, specifically the bending modulus ($\kappa$) of the film. A non-zero $\kappa$ suppresses the thermal roughness at small length scales compared to an interface with zero $\kappa$, as expressed by the power spectral density (PSD) of the thermal roughness. The description of the X-ray scattering of the standard Capillary Wave Model (CWM), that is valid for zero $\kappa$, is extended to include the effect of $\kappa$. The extended CWM (eCWM) provides a single analytical form for both the specular XRR and the diffuse scattering around the specular reflection, and recovers the expression of the CWM at its zero $\kappa$ limit. This new theoretical approach enables the use of single-shot grazing incidence X-ray off-specular scattering (GIXOS) measurements for characterizing the structure of thin films on a liquid surface. The eCWM analysis approach decouples the thermal roughness factor from the surface scattering signal, providing direct access to the intrinsic surface-normal structure of the film and its bending modulus. Moreover, the eCWM facilitates the calculation of reflectivity at any desired resolution (pseudo XRR approach). The transformation into pseudo XRR provides the benefit of using widely available XRR software to perform GIXOS analysis. The extended range of the vertical scattering vector (Qz) available with the GIXOS-pseudo XRR approach allows for a higher spatial resolution than with conventional XRR. Experimental results are presented for various lipid systems, showing strong agreement between conventional specular XRR and pseudo XRR methods. This agreement validates the proposed approach and highlights its utility for analyzing soft, thin films.

Title: Complex single-site magnetism and magnetotransport in single-crystalline Gd$_{2}$AlSi$_{3}$
Authors: Ram Kumar, Shanta R. Saha, Jarryd Horn, A. Ikeda, Danila Sokratov, Yash Anand, Prathum Saraf, Ryan Dorman, E. Hemley, K. K. Iyer, Johnpierre Paglione
Abstract: We present a detailed investigation of single-crystal samples of the magnetic compound Gd$_{2}$AlSi$_{3}$, which crystallizes in the $\alpha$-ThSi$_2$ type tetragonal structure. We report the temperature and magnetic field dependence of the magnetic susceptibility, magnetization, heat capacity, electrical resistivity, and magnetoresistance for magnetic fields applied along both the tetragonal $c$-axis and in the basal $ab$-plane. X-ray diffraction measurements confirm a centrosymmetric, $I4_{1}/amd$ space group of the crystal structure. Despite single-site occupancy of the Gd position in this tetragonal structure, we identify two successive antiferromagnetic phase transitions at Ne√©l temperatures 32~K and 23~K via magnetic susceptibility, heat capacity and transport measurements, as well as a complex magnetic interaction with a magnetic anisotropy that plays an important role in the direction-dependent transport response. Our identification of multiple magnetic phases in Gd$_{2}$AlSi$_{3}$, where Gd is the only magnetic species, helps to elucidate the field-induced skyrmionic behavior in the Gd-based intermetallic compounds.

Title: Zigzag antiferromagnets in the SU(3) Hubbard model on the square lattice
Authors: Stijn V. Kleijweg, Philippe Corboz
Abstract: SU(N) Hubbard models exhibit a rich variety of phases, which may be realized through quantum simulation with ultracold atomic gases in optical lattices. In this work we study the Mott insulating phases of the SU(3) Hubbard model at 1/3-filling using infinite projected entangled-pair states, optimized with both imaginary time evolution and variational optimization. In the limit of strong interactions we reproduce the antiferromagnetic 3-sublattice ordered state previously identified in the SU(3) Heisenberg model. At intermediate interaction strength we find antiferromagnetic states exhibiting zigzag patterns of different lengths, in agreement with previous Hartree-Fock and constrained-path auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo calculations. We study the color order parameter and energy anisotropy, which are discontinuous across the phase transitions. Finally, we analyze the different energy contributions in two competing phases, identifying low-energy bonds at the corners of the zigzag that help stabilize the zigzag states.

Title: High-fidelity collisional quantum gates with fermionic atoms
Authors: Petar Bojoviƒá, Timon Hilker, Si Wang, Johannes Obermeyer, Marnix Barendregt, Dorothee Tell, Thomas Chalopin, Philipp M. Preiss, Immanuel Bloch, Titus Franz
Abstract: Quantum simulations of electronic structure and strongly correlated quantum phases are widely regarded as among the most promising applications of quantum computing. These simulations require the accurate implementation of motion and entanglement of fermionic particles. Instead of the commonly applied costly mapping to qubits, fermionic quantum computers offer the prospect of directly implementing electronic structure problems. Ultracold neutral atoms have emerged as a powerful platform for spin-based quantum computing, but quantum information can also be processed via the motion of bosonic or fermionic atoms offering a distinct advantage by intrinsically conserving crucial symmetries like electron number. Here we demonstrate collisional entangling gates with fidelities up to 99.75(6)% and lifetimes of Bell states beyond $10\,s$ via the control of fermionic atoms in an optical superlattice. Using quantum gas microscopy, we characterize both spin-exchange and pair-tunneling gates locally, and realize a robust, composite pair-exchange gate, a key building block for quantum chemistry simulations. Our results enable the preparation of complex quantum states and advanced readout protocols for a new class of scalable analog-digital hybrid quantum simulators. Once combined with local addressing, they mark a key step towards a fully digital fermionic quantum computer based on the controlled motion and entanglement of fermionic neutral atoms.

Title: High-efficiency WSe$_2$ photovoltaics enabled by ultra-clean van der Waals contacts

Abstract: Layered transition metal dichalcogenide semiconductors are interesting for photovoltaics owing to their high solar absorbance and efficient carrier diffusion. Tungsten diselenide (WSe$_2$), in particular, has emerged as a promising solar cell absorber. However, defective metal-semiconductor interfaces have restricted the power conversion efficiency (PCE) to approximately 6%. Here we report WSe$_2$ photovoltaics with a record-high PCE of approximately 11% enabled by ultra-clean indium/gold (In/Au) van der Waals (vdW) contacts. Using grid-patterned top vdW electrodes, we demonstrate near-ideal diodes with a record-high on/off ratio of $1.0\times 10^9$. Open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 571 +/- 9 mV, record-high short-circuit current density (JSC) of 27.19 +/- 0.45 mA cm$^{-2}$ -- approaching the theoretical limit (34.5 mA cm$^{-2}$) -- and fill factor of 69.2 +/- 0.7% resulting in PCE of 10.8 +/- 0.2% under 1-Sun illumination on large active area (approximately 0.13x0.13 mm$^2$) devices have been realised. The excellent device performance is consistent with the high external quantum efficiency (up to approximately 93%) measured across a broad spectral range of 500-830 nm. Our results suggest that ultra-clean vdW contacts on WSe$_2$ enable high-efficiency photovoltaics and form the foundation for further optimisation.

Title: Repulsive particle interactions enable selective information processing at cellular interfaces
Authors: Jenna Elliott, Hiral Shah, Roman Belousov, Gautam Dey, Anna Erzberger
Abstract: Living systems relay information across membrane interfaces to coordinate compartment functions. We identify a physical mechanism for selective information transmission that arises from the sigmoidal response of surface-bound particle densities to spatial features of adjacent external structures. This mechanism implements a form of spatial thresholding, enabling the binary classification of external cues. Expansion microscopy measurements of nuclear pore complex distributions in S. arctica show signatures of such physical thresholding.

Title: Quantum simulation of fermionic non-Abelian lattice gauge theories in $(2+1)$D with built-in gauge protection
Authors: Gaia De Paciani, Lukas Homeier, Jad C. Halimeh, Monika Aidelsburger, Fabian Grusdt
Abstract: Recent advancements in the field of quantum simulation have significantly expanded the potential for applications, particularly in the context of lattice gauge theories (LGTs). Maintaining gauge invariance throughout a simulation remains a central challenge, especially for large-scale non-Abelian LGTs with dynamical matter, which are particularly complex in terms of engineering for experiments. Gauge-symmetry breaking is inevitable in established rishon-based schemes for alkaline-earth-like atoms (AELAs) and controlling the magnitude of its effect is an open challenge. Here, we first construct a minimal model to quantum simulate non-Abelian LGTs ensuring that the gauge constraints are met and explicitly derive their unambiguous non-Abelian nature. Second, we present a proposal for a novel gauge protection scheme using native interactions in AELAs enabling the simulation of toy models of non-Abelian $U(2)$ LGTs with dynamical fermionic matter in $(2+1)$ dimensions on large scales. Due to the simplicity of the gauge protection mechanism, based on a Zeeman shift in combination with superexchange interactions, our scheme can be naturally included in other rishon-based quantum simulation protocols. Third, we extend our approach to a fully scalable, hybrid digital-analog simulator for $U(N)$ LGTs based on Rydberg AELA with variable rishon number. The proposed general mechanism for gauge protection provides a promising path towards the long-awaited simulation of non-Abelian LGTs relevant to particle physics.

Title: Fully Tunable Strong Spin-Orbit Interactions in Light Hole Germanium Quantum Channels
Authors: Patrick Del Vecchio, Stefano Bosco, Daniel Loss, Oussama Moutanabbir
Abstract: Spin-orbit interaction (SOI) is a fundamental component for electrically driven spin qubits and hybrid superconducting-semiconducting systems. In particular, Rashba SOI (RSOI) is a key mechanism enabling all-electrical spin manipulation schemes. However, in common planar systems, RSOI is weak because of the small mixing between heavy holes (HH) and light holes (LH), and instead relies on complex strain and interface phenomena that are hard to reliably harness in experiment. Here, MOS-like epitaxial Ge on relaxed \GeSn{} is introduced and shown to exhibit an inherently large, highly gate-tunable RSOI that is compatible with both spin qubits and hybrid devices. This large RSOI is a consequence of the LH-like ground state in Ge. Notably, the built-in asymmetry of the device causes the RSOI to completely vanish at specific gate fields, effectively acting as an on/off SOI switch. The LH $g$-tensor is less anisotropic than that of state-of-the-art HH qubits, alleviating precise magnetic field orientation requirements. The large in-plane $g$-factor also facilitates the integration of superconductors. Moreover, the out-of-plane $g$-factor is strongly gate-tunable and completely vanishes at specific gate fields. Thus, this material system combines the large RSOI with the scalability of planar devices, paving the way towards robust spin qubit applications and enabling access to new regimes of complex spin physics.

Title: Universal cooling of quantum systems via randomized measurements
Authors: Josias Langbehn, George Mouloudakis, Emma King, Rapha√´l Menu, Igor Gornyi, Giovanna Morigi, Yuval Gefen, Christiane P. Koch
Abstract: It is generally believed that the design of cooling protocols requires knowledge of the system's spectrum. In contrast, cooling processes in nature occur whenever the system is coupled to a cold bath. But how does nature know how to cool quantum systems? Here we address this question by mimicking a natural cold bath with a reservoir of "meter" qubits that are initialized in their ground state and interact with the system sequentially for a specified time before being discarded. This protocol is equivalent to quantum measurements without keeping the measurement readouts. We show that a quantum system can be cooled without prior knowledge of the system's details when the interactions between the system and the meters, as well as the level splittings of the meters, are chosen randomly. For sufficiently small interaction strengths and long interaction times, the rotating-wave approximation becomes valid, ensuring that resonant energy-exchange processes, which lead to cooling, dominate over heating. This demonstrates that robust and scalable cooling of complex quantum systems can be achieved through generic, structure-independent protocols. Our findings thus offer a versatile universal framework for engineering, controlling, and manipulating quantum matter far from equilibrium, in particular, for the purposes of quantum information processing and quantum simulations.

Title: Probing Hilbert space fragmentation using controlled dephasing
Authors: Dominik Vuina, Robin Sch√§fer, David M. Long, Anushya Chandran
Abstract: Dynamical constraints in many-body quantum systems can lead to Hilbert space fragmentation, wherein the system's evolution is restricted to small subspaces of Hilbert space called Krylov sectors. However, unitary dynamics within individual sectors may also be slow or non-ergodic, which limits experiments' ability to measure the properties of the entire sector. We show that additional controlled dephasing reliably mixes the system within a single Krylov sector, and that simple observables can differentiate these sectors. For example, in the strongly interacting XXZ chain with dephasing, the spin imbalance between even and odd sublattices distinguishes sectors. For appropriate choices of initial states, the imbalance begins positive, decays to a negative minimum value at intermediate times, and eventually returns to zero. The minimum reflects the average imbalance of the Krylov sector associated to the initial state. We compute the size of the minimum analytically in the limit of strong interactions, and validate our results with simulations at experimentally relevant interaction strengths.

Title: Connecting phases of matter to the flatness of the loss landscape in analog variational quantum algorithms
Authors: Kasidit Srimahajariyapong, Supanut Thanasilp, Thiparat Chotibut
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) promise near-term quantum advantage, yet parametrized quantum states commonly built from the digital gate-based approach often suffer from scalability issues such as barren plateaus, where the loss landscape becomes flat. We study an analog VQA ans√§tze composed of $M$ quenches of a disordered Ising chain, whose dynamics is native to several quantum simulation platforms. By tuning the disorder strength we place each quench in either a thermalized phase or a many-body-localized (MBL) phase and analyse (i) the ans√§tze's expressivity and (ii) the scaling of loss variance. Numerics shows that both phases reach maximal expressivity at large $M$, but barren plateaus emerge at far smaller $M$ in the thermalized phase than in the MBL phase. Exploiting this gap, we propose an MBL initialisation strategy: initialise the ans√§tze in the MBL regime at intermediate quench $M$, enabling an initial trainability while retaining sufficient expressivity for subsequent optimization. The results link quantum phases of matter and VQA trainability, and provide practical guidelines for scaling analog-hardware VQAs.

Title: Dynamical quantum phase transition with divergent multipartite entanglement
Authors: Jie Chen, Ricardo Costa de Almeida, Hendrik Weimer
Abstract: We investigate the nonequilibrium quench dynamics of the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model in both integrable and nonintegrable regimes. In particular, we report on a novel type of dynamical quantum phase transition (DQPT) that is characterized by a divergent multipartite entanglement at critical times in the post-quench dynamics. We quantify the multipartite entanglement of the state by the quantum Fisher information and demonstrate that the DQPT belongs to a different universality class than the ground-state phase transition. Furthermore, we perform a spectral analysis of the DQPT and demonstrate that it is a genuine nonequilibrium transition arising from the constructive interference of excited states of the system during the many-body dynamics. Finally, we discuss potential experimental realizations in Rydberg platforms as well as applications in the context of quantum metrology.

Title: Non-coalescence and in-plane momentum generation in sessile droplet clusters
Authors: Gopal Chandra Pal, Cheuk Wing Edmond Lam, Chander Shekhar Sharma
Abstract: Intuitively, droplets in proximity merge when brought into contact. However, under certain conditions, they may not coalesce due to the entrapment of an interstitial gas film. Droplet non-coalescence has so far been observed in various scenarios, such as during interactions between droplets moving with relative bulk velocity, droplets with opposite charges and size differences, and Leidenfrost droplets due to continuous vapor generation. Although non-coalescence has been reported for droplets of various fluids and sizes, non-coalescence for water droplets has been reported only for grazing collisions of large droplets (diameter >2 mm) moving with high bulk velocity. Here, we report non-coalescence between water droplets over a wide range of droplet diameters, without the presence of any charges, surfactants, fluid property gradients, any additional vapor generation, or bulk droplet velocities. Such non-coalescence manifests in sessile droplet clusters on water repellant surfaces. When any two droplets in a cluster coalesce, they do not necessarily trigger further coalescence with other neighbouring droplets in the cluster. Further, depending on the initial geometric arrangement of droplets, such non-coalescence results in significant lateral momentum generation and consequently, spontaneous in-plane self-propulsion of participating droplets. The energy conversion efficiency of this process reaches as high as 9% for most closely packed clusters of 3 droplets and increases further with increase in the number of participating droplets. Further, this phenomenon can manifest for droplets as small as 200 {\mu}m in diameter formed during condensation. The resulting self-propulsion of such small droplets reveals a new pathway for passive droplet removal and surface renewal during dropwise condensation on superhydrophobic surfaces, critical in multiple applications.

Title: ReLCP: Scalable Complementarity-Based Collision Resolution for Smooth Rigid Bodies
Authors: Bryce Palmer, Hasan Metin Aktulga, Tong Gao
Abstract: We present a complementarity-based collision resolution algorithm for smooth, non-spherical, rigid bodies. Unlike discrete surface representation approaches, which approximate surfaces using discrete elements (e.g., tessellations or sub-spheres) with constraints between nearby faces, edges, nodes, or sub-objects, our algorithm solves a recursively generated linear complementarity problem (ReLCP) to adaptively identify potential collision locations during the collision resolution procedure. Despite adaptively and in contrast to Newton-esque schemes, we prove conditions under which the resulting solution exists and the center of mass translational and rotational dynamics are unique. Our ReLCP also converges to classical LCP-based collision resolution for sufficiently small timesteps. Because increasing the surface resolution in discrete representation methods necessitates subdividing geometry into finer elements -- leading to a super-linear increase in the number of collision constraints -- these approaches scale poorly with increased surface resolution. In contrast, our adaptive ReLCP framework begins with a single constraint per pair of nearby bodies and introduces new constraints only when unconstrained motion would lead to overlap, circumventing the oversampling required by discrete methods. By requiring one to two orders of magnitude fewer collision constraints to achieve the same surface resolution, we observe 10-100x speedup in densely packed applications. We validate our ReLCP method against multisphere and single-constraint methods, comparing convergence in a two-ellipsoid collision test, scalability and performance in a compacting ellipsoid suspension and growing bacterial colony, and stability in a taut chainmail network, highlighting our ability to achieve high-fidelity surface representations without suffering from poor scalability or artificial surface roughness.

Title: Resonant helical dichroism in twisted dielectric metastructures
Authors: Yiyuan Wang, Chi Li, Haoyi Yu, Stefan A. Maier, Jinhui Shi, Haoran Ren, Kirill Koshelev
Abstract: Circular dichroism, arising from interactions with light fields of opposite spin angular momentum, has become a fundamental tool for molecular characterization. Meanwhile, helical dichroism (HD) - the dichroic response to vortex beams carrying opposite orbital angular momentum (OAM) - offers an alternative approach for probing chiral molecules and photonic structures. Previous demonstrations of HD have been limited to non-resonant light-matter interactions with chiral micro- and nanostructures, leaving the realization of resonance helical dichroism largely unexplored. Here, we present the design and implementation of twisted dielectric metastructures, composed of an array of rotated silicon trimer nanostructures harnessing nonlocal photonic modes with a high quality factor of several dozen that enable strong resonant HD for OAM values up to $10$. We experimentally demonstrate resonantly enhanced HD for strongly focused OAM beams with the magnitude of topological charges from $1$ to $3$. Our findings pave the way for resonant nanophotonics involving OAM beams, unlocking the full potential of structured light for applications in molecular sensing, optical imaging, nonlinear optics, and optical data storage.

Title: Detecting local topology with the spectral localizer
Authors: Alexander Cerjan, Hermann Schulz-Baldes
Abstract: The spectral localizer is a predictive framework for the computation of topological invariants of natural and artificial materials. Here, three crucial improvements on the criterion for the validity of the framework are reported: first, merely a properly defined local spectral gap of the Hamiltonian is required, second, only relative bounds on the Hamiltonian and its noncommutative derivative are relevant, and, third, the numerical constant in a tapering estimate is improved. These developments further stress the local nature of the spectral localizer framework, enabling more precise predictions in heterostructures, aperiodic, and disordered systems. Moreover, these results strengthen the bounds on the spectral localizer's spectral flow when crossing topological phase boundaries.

Title: Turbulent stretching of dumbbells with hydrodynamic interactions: an analytical study
Authors: Jason R. Picardo, Dario Vincenzi
Abstract: We study the stretching of an elastic dumbbell in a turbulent flow, with the aim of understanding and quantifying the effect of hydrodynamic interactions (HI) between the beads of the dumbbell. Adopting the Batchelor-Kraichnan model for the flow, we derive a Fokker-Planck equation and solve it analytically to obtain the probability distribution of the dumbbell's extension. Using different formulations of the HI tensor, we find that HI preferentially enhances the stretching of stiff dumbbells, i.e., those with a small Weissenberg number. We also evaluate the averaging approximations commonly used to simplify the description of HI effects; the consistently-averaged approximation shows that HI result in a less-pronounced coil-stretch transition in chaotic flows. Finally, we confirm the relevance of our analytical results by a comparison with Brownian dynamics simulations of dumbbells transported in a direct numerical simulation of homogeneous isotropic turbulence.

Title: A novel approach for converting spatio-temporal series into complex networks
Authors: G.Cigdem Yalcin, M.Berk Onder
Abstract: This study aims to offer a new perspective on complex network representation of real-world systems. Currently, the most well-known transformation algorithms in the literature treat each data point in a time series as a node and transform the time series into a network. In this study, we present a new approach converting spatio-temporal series into a complex network. We focus on studying this transformation by grounding it in the context of physics , with the aim of adapting it to real-world problems, which often manifest as complex systems across various domains. We introduce the Gravitational Graph (GG) algorithm, which is grounded in the concept of gravitational force from fundamental physics. We consider air pollution concentrations, which represent a global environmental health risk, as an example of a complex environmental system, and apply the GG algorithm to particulate matter of 10 microns (PM10) recorded by 21 air quality monitoring stations located in various regions of Istanbul, Turkiye. While the GG algorithm allows for the conversion of spatio-temporal series -- rather than time series -- into networks, it also enables the analysis of the statistical properties and characteristics of the converted networks, thereby uncovering hidden relationships and dependencies that may not be apparent in the original time series.

Title: Active viscoelastic condensates provide controllable mechanical anchor points
Authors: Oliver W. Paulin, J√∫lia Garcia-Baucells, Luise Zieger, Sebastian Aland, Alexander Dammermann, David Zwicker
Abstract: Many biological materials must couple mechanical strength with the ability to rapidly self-assemble at a specific location. In particular, biomolecular condensates readily self-assemble via phase separation, but may also need to resist external forces to fulfil their function. Spatial localisation of condensate formation can be controlled by active cores that preferentially drive the production of condensate material at a particular point, while resistance to external forces can be facilitated by viscoelastic material properties. To investigate the interplay of these two processes, we develop a continuum model of viscoelastic growth around an active core. We find that viscoelastic stresses restrict condensate growth, but also impart resistance to deformation. We investigate the effect of different incorporation schemes on growth dynamics, and test the influence of mechanical properties on condensate strength. Finally, we compare the predictions of our model to experimental data from centrosomes in C. elegans embryos, identifying a parameter regime in which rapid growth can be combined with appropriate mechanical strength, and studying how strain-dependent material incorporation may lead to isotropic growth of scaffold material. Our results provide general design principles for other materials that must reconcile rapid, localised self-assembly with mechanical strength, such as focal adhesions.

Title: Dynamically Dressed States of a Quantum Four-Level System
Authors: Carolin Calcagno, Friedrich Sbresny, Thomas K. Bracht, Sang Kyu Kim, Eduardo Zubizarreta Casalengua, Katarina Boos, William Rauhaus, Hubert Riedl, Jonathan J. Finley, Doris E. Reiter, Kai M√ºller
Abstract: In this work, we experimentally and theoretically study the dressed-state emission of the biexciton-exciton cascade in a semiconductor quantum dot under pulsed, resonant, two-photon excitation. Building on the well-characterized steady-state dressed emission of the four-level system, we examine its dynamic counterpart under pulsed, resonant excitation, addressing both experimental observations and theoretical modeling. Here we report several sidebands emerging from the biexciton-to-exciton transition, whose number and spectral width depend on the excitation pulse duration and the effective pulse area, while no sidebands emerge from the exciton-to-ground-state transition. Since the biexciton state population follows a nonlinear pulse area function, sidebands with a small spectral nonlinearity result. Detuning- and time-dependent measurements provide deeper insight into the emission properties of the dressed states. They show that side peak emission only occurs in the presence of the excitation pulse. Moreover, when the system is excited by a Gaussian-shaped laser pulse, side peak emission takes place sequentially.

Title: Promoting Fluctuation Theorems into Covariant Forms
Authors: Ji-Hui Pei, Jin-Fu Chen, H. T. Quan
Abstract: The principle of covariance, a cornerstone of modern physics, asserts the equivalence of all inertial frames of reference. Fluctuation theorems, as extensions of the second law of thermodynamics, establish universal connections between irreversibility and fluctuation in terms of stochastic thermodynamic quantities. However, these relations typically assume that both the thermodynamic system and the heat bath are at rest with respect to the observer, thereby failing to satisfy the principle of covariance. In this study, by introducing covariant work and heat that incorporate both energy-related and momentum-related components, we promote fluctuation theorems into covariant forms applicable to moving thermodynamic systems and moving heat baths. We illustrate this framework with two examples: the work statistics of a relativistic stochastic field and the heat statistics of a relativistic Brownian motion. Although our study is carried out in the context of special relativity, the results can be extended to the nonrelativistic limit. Our work combines the principle of covariance and fluctuation theorems into a coherent framework and may have applications in the study of thermodynamics relevant to cosmic microwave background as well as the radiative heat transfer and noncontact friction between relatively moving bodies.

Title: Electron correlations in the kagome flat band metal $\rm CsCr_3Sb_5$
Authors: Fang Xie, Yuan Fang, Ying Li, Yuefei Huang, Lei Chen, Chandan Setty, Shouvik Sur, Boris Yakobson, Roser Valent√≠, Qimiao Si
Abstract: Kagome metals offer a unique platform for investigating robust electron-correlation effects because of their lattice geometry, flat bands and multi-orbital nature. In the cases with active flat bands, recent theoretical studies have pointed to a rich phase diagram that contains not only electronic orders but also quantum criticality. Very recently, $\rm CsCr_3Sb_5$ has emerged as a strong candidate for exploring such new physics. Here, using effective tight-binding models obtained from ab initio calculations, we study the effects of electronic correlations and symmetries on the electronic structure of $\rm CsCr_3 Sb_5$. The effective tight-binding model and Fermi surface comprise multiple Cr-$d$ orbitals and Sb-$p$ orbitals. The introduction of Hubbard-Kanamori interactions leads to orbital-selective band renormalization dominated by the $d_{xz}$ band, concurrently producing emergent flat bands very close to the Fermi level. Our analysis sets the stage for further investigations into the electronic properties of $\rm CsCr_3Sb_5$, including electronic orders, quantum criticality and unconventional superconductivity, which promise to shed much new light into the electronic materials with frustrated lattices and bring about new connections with the correlation physics of a variety of strongly correlated systems.

Title: Skyrmion-vortex hybrid and spin wave solutions in superconducting ferromagnets
Authors: Shantonu Mukherjee, Amitabha Lahiri
Abstract: The coexistence of Ferromagnetism and superconductivity in so called ferromagnetic superconductors is an intriguing phenomenon which may lead to novel physical effects as well as applications. Here in this work we have explored the interplay of topological excitations, namely vortices and skyrmions, in ferromagnetic superconductors using a field theoretic description of such systems. In particular, numerical solutions for the continuous spin field compatible to a given vortex profile are determined in absence and presence of a Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) term. The solutions show that the spin configuration is like a skyrmion but intertwined with the vortex structure -- the radius of the the skyrmion-like solution depends on the penetration depth and also the polarity of the skyrmion depends on the sign of the winding number. Thus our solution describes a topological structure: namely a skyrmion-vortex composite. We have also determined the spin wave solutions in such systems in presence and absence of a vortex. In absence of vortex frequency and wave vector satisfy a cubic equation which leads to various interesting features. In particular, we have shown that in the low frequency regime the minimum in dispersion relation shifts from $k=0$ to a non zero $k$ value depending on the parameters. We also discuss the nature of spin wave dispersion in the $\omega \sim \Tilde{m}$ regime which shows a similar pattern in the dispersion curve. The group velocity of the spin wave would change it's sign across such a minimum which is unique to FMSC. Also, the spin wave modes around the local minimum looks like roton mode in superfluid and hence called a magnetic roton. In presence of a vortex, the spin wave amplitude is shown to vary spatially such that the profile looks like that of a N√©el Skyrmion. Possible experimental signature of both solutions are also discussed.

Title: Strong Field Optical Hall Effect in 2D Weyl Semimetal
Authors: M. Umar Farooq, Arqum Hashmi, Mizuki Tani, Kazuhiro Yabana, Kenichi L. Ishikawa, Li Huang, Tomohito Otobe
Abstract: The study of interplay between the geometric nature of Bloch electrons and transverse responses under strong field offers new opportunities for optoelectronic applications. Here, we present a comprehensive study of the strong-field response of Weyl Dirac nodes in bilayer T'-WTe2 using time-dependent first-principles formalism. The electron dynamics is explored focusing on the mid-infrared frequency, ranging from the perturbative to nonperturbative regime. In the nonperturbative regime, the high-harmonic generation (HHG) spectra under a strong field clearly exhibit a plateau and energy cutoffs for both longitudinal and anomalous Hall (transverse) currents, with the latter being due to the large interband Berry curvature of the Weyl-Dirac semimetal. For the longitudinal harmonics, the intraband contributions increase with intensity, resulting in a complex interplay between interband polarization and intraband motions. Remarkably, if we take a comprehensive all-band perspective enabled by time-dependent density functional calculations, the anomalous Hall responses are purely attributed to the interband processes, even in the nonperturbative regime, thus Hall HHG can be crucial to understand the carrier dynamics. Our findings suggest that HHG associated with the ultrafast strong-field driven electron dynamics holds immense potential for exploring the nonlinear high Hall responses in Weyl semimetal.

Title: Origin of unexpected weak Gilbert damping in the LSMO/Pt bilayer system
Authors: Pritam Das, Pushpendra Gupta, Seung-Cheol Lee, Subhankar Bedanta, Satadeep Bhattacharjee
Abstract: We present a first-principles and semiclassical analysis of the puzzling observation that a La$_{0.7}$Sr$_{0.3}$MnO$_3$ (LSMO) thin film exhibits larger Gilbert damping than an LSMO/Pt bilayer, contrary to conventional spin-pumping expectations. Density-functional theory with Wannier interpolation yields an intrinsic damping for LSMO, which is smaller than that of LSMO/Pt, indicating that the observed high damping in LSMO must be extrinsic. Motivated by the self-induced inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE) reported by Gupta et al [Phys. Rev. B 109, 014437 (2024)], we show that LSMO's large spin Hall angle (~0.093) and low longitudinal conductivity facilitate efficient spin-to-charge conversion, enhancing damping. In contrast, Pt capping in LSMO/Pt increases longitudinal conductivity and suppresses interfacial spin Hall angle to 0.007, reducing spin-pumping-induced damping. A Valet-Fert analysis of the spin accumulation yields the spin-diffusion length in Pt and a finite anti-damping spin-orbit torque coefficient. Our findings reconcile the anomalous damping hierarchy and offer design rules for low-loss manganite heterostructures.

Title: Proposal for realizing quantum-spin systems on a two-dimensional square lattice with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction by the Floquet engineering using Rydberg atoms
Authors: Hiroki Kuji, Masaya Kunimi, Tetsuro Nikuni
Abstract: We theoretically propose a method for implementing the Hamiltonian incorporating Heisenberg and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions within Rydberg atoms arranged in a two-dimensional square lattice, utilizing Floquet engineering. In our scheme, we use both global and local operations of the spins. The global operations can be realized by applying the microwave and the local operations can be realized by the locally addressing lasers, which yields the ac-Stark shift. Since our engineered Hamiltonian contains bond-dependent DM interactions, we expect the emergence of quantum skyrmions in the ground state.

Title: Antichiral surface states and Su-Schrieffer-Heeger physics in rutile altermagnets
Authors: Sopheak Sorn
Abstract: We study surface states and domain wall bound states in altermagnets using a rutile-lattice tight-binding model of electrons coupled to a N√©el order. We discover that two symmetry-protected Weyl nodal lines in the bulk band structure can give rise to unconventional anti-chiral surface states -- surface states from opposite surfaces propagate in a \emph{parallel} manner, as opposed to the anti-parallel manner for the more conventional chiral surface states. We also find that the anti-chiral surface states can be turned into chiral surface states upon changing the surface termination. The origin of the surface states, the dependence on the surface termination, and key features of domain wall bound states are explained using a map from the altermagnet to a family of a modified Su-Schrieffer-Heeger(SSH) chain and the associated bulk-boundary correspondence. Our work reveals rutile altermagnets as a promising candidate among very few quantum materials that can support anti-chiral surface states.

Abstract: Recent advances in semiconductor spin qubits have achieved linear arrays exceeding ten qubits. Moving to two-dimensional (2D) qubit arrays is a critical next step to advance towards fault-tolerant implementations, but it poses substantial fabrication challenges, particularly because enabling control of nearest-neighbor entanglement requires the incorporation of interstitial exchange gates between quantum dots in the qubit architecture. In this work, we present a 2D array of silicon metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) quantum dots with tunable interdot coupling between all adjacent dots. The device is characterized at 4.2 K, where we demonstrate the formation and isolation of double-dot and triple-dot configurations. We show control of all nearest-neighbor tunnel couplings spanning up to 30 decades per volt through the interstitial exchange gates and use advanced modeling tools to estimate the exchange interactions that could be realized among qubits in this architecture. These results represent a significant step towards the development of 2D MOS quantum processors compatible with foundry manufacturing techniques.

Title: Classical Annealing of Sherrington-Kirkpatrick Spin Glass Using Suzuki-Kubo Mean-field Ising Dynamics
Authors: Soumyaditya Das, Soumyajyoti Biswas, Bikas K. Chakrabarti
Abstract: We propose and demonstrate numerically a fast classical annealing scheme for the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) spin glass model, employing the Suzuki-Kubo meanfield Ising dynamics (supplemented by a modified Thouless-Anderson-Palmer reaction field). The resultant dynamics, starting from any arbitrary paramagnetic phase (with local magnetizations $m_i=\pm 1$ for the $i^{th}$ spin, and the global magnetization $m=0$), takes the system quickly to an appropriate state with small local values of magnetization ($m_i$) commensurate with the (frustrated) interactions. As the temperature decreases with the annealing, the configuration practically remains (in an effective adiabatic way) close to a low energy configuration as the magnitudes of $m_i$'s and the spin glass order parameter $q$ grow to unity. While the configuration reached by the procedure is not the ground state, for an $N$-spin SK model (with $N$ up to 10000) the deviation in the energy per spin $E^0_N - E^0$ found by the annealing procedure scales as $N^{-2/3}$, with $E^0 = -0.7629\pm 0.0002$, suggesting that in the thermodynamic limit the energy per spin of the low energy configurations converges to the ground state of the SK model (analytical estimate being $E^0 =-0.7631667265 \dots$), fluctuation $\sigma_N $ in $E^0_N$ decreases as $\sim N^{-3/4}$ and the annealing time $\tau_N \sim N$, making this protocol highly efficient in estimating the ground state of the SK model.

Title: Microscopic evidence of charge- and spin-density waves in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-Œ¥}$ revealed by $^{139}$La-NQR
Authors: J. Luo, J. Feng, G. Wang, N. N. Wang, J. Dou, A. F. Fang, J. Yang, J. G. Cheng, Guo-qing Zheng, R. Zhou
Abstract: The recent discovery of superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ with a transition temperature $T_c$ close to 80 K at high pressures has attracted significant attention, due particularly to a possible density wave (DW) transition occurring near the superconducting dome. Identifying the type of DW order is crucial for understanding the origin of superconductivity in this system. However, owing to the presence of La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ and other intergrowth phases in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ samples, extracting the intrinsic information from the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ phase is challenging. In this study, we employed $^{139}$La nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) measurements to eliminate the influence of other structural phases in the sample and obtain microscopic insights into the DW transition in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$. Below the DW transition temperature $T_{\rm DW} \sim$ 153K, we observe a distinct splitting in the $\pm$ 5/2 $\leftrightarrow$ $\pm$ 7/2 transition of the NQR resonance peak at the La(2) site, while only a line broadening is seen in the $\pm$ 3/2 $\leftrightarrow$ $\pm$ 5/2 transition peak. Through further analysis of the spectra, we show that the line splitting is due to a unidirectional charge modulation. A magnetic line broadening is also observed below $T_{\rm DW}$, accompanied by a large enhancement of the spin-lattice relaxation rate, indicating the formation of magnetically ordered moments in the DW state. Our results suggest a simultaneous formation of charge- and spin-density wave order in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ , thereby offering critical insights into the electronic correlations in Ni-based superconductors.

Title: Giant orbital Hall effect due to the bulk states of 3D topological insulators
Authors: James H. Cullen, Hong Liu, Dimitrie Culcer
Abstract: The highly efficient torques generated by 3D topological insulators make them a favourable platform for faster and more efficient magnetic memory devices. Recently, research into harnessing orbital angular momentum in orbital torques has received significant attention. Here we study the orbital Hall effect in topological insulators. We find that the bulk states give rise to a sizeable orbital Hall effect that is up to 3 orders of magnitude larger than the spin Hall effect in topological insulators. This is partially because the orbital angular momentum that each conduction electron carries is up to an order of magnitude larger than the $\hbar/2$ carried by its spin. Our results imply that the large torques measured in topological insulator/ferromagnet devices can be further enhanced through careful engineering of the heterostructure to optimise orbital-to-spin conversion.

Title: Layer-Resolved Quantum Transport in Twisted Bilayer Graphene: Counterflow and Machine Learning Predictions
Authors: Matheus H. Gobbo Kuhn, L. A. Silva, D. A. Bahamon
Abstract: The layer-resolved quantum transport response of a twisted bilayer graphene device is investigated by driving a current through the bottom layer and measuring the induced voltage in the top layer. Devices with four- and eight-layer differentiated contacts were analyzed, revealing that in a nanoribbon geometry (four contacts), a longitudinal counterflow current emerges in the top layer, while in a square-junction configuration (eight contacts), this counterflow is accompanied by a transverse, or Hall, component. These effects persist despite weak coupling to contacts, onsite disorder, lattice relaxation and variations in device size. The observed counterflow response indicates a circulating interlayer current, which generates an in-plane magnetic moment excited by the injected current. Finally, due to the intricate relationship between the electrical layer response, energy, and twist angle, a clusterized machine learning model was trained, validated, and tested to predict various conductances.

Title: Superconducting phenomena in systems with unconventional magnets
Authors: Yuri Fukaya, Bo Lu, Keiji Yada, Yukio Tanaka, Jorge Cayao
Abstract: In this work we review the recent advances on superconducting phenomena in junctions formed by superconductors and unconventional magnets. Conventional magnets, such as ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, are characterized by broken time-reversal symmetry but only ferromagnets produce a finite net magnetization due to parallel spin alignment and spin-split bands in momentum. Very recently, a new type of magnets has been reported and here we refer to them as \emph{unconventional magnets} because they exhibit special properties of both ferromagnets and antiferromagnets: they exhibit zero net magnetization (like antiferromagnets) and a nonrelativistic spin splitting of energy bands (like ferromagnets), both leading to anisotropic spin-polarized Fermi surfaces. An interesting property of unconventional magnets is that their magnetic order can be even or odd with respect to momentum, where \emph{$d$-wave altermagnets} and \emph{$p$-wave magnets} are the most representative examples. In this regard, $d$-wave altermagnets and $p$-wave magnets are seen as counterparts in magnetism of the unconventional $d$- and $p$-wave superconducting states, respectively. While the impact of conventional magnetism on superconductivity has been largely studied, the combination of unconventional magnets and superconductivity has only lately attracted considerably attention. This work provides a comprehensive review of the recent progress on the interplay between superconductivity and unconventional magnets. In particular, we focus on the fundamental emerging superconducting phenomena and also discuss the potential implications towards quantum applications.

Title: Topological descriptors for the electron density of inorganic solids
Authors: Nathan J. Szymanski, Alexander Smith, Prodromos Daoutidis, Christopher J. Bartel
Abstract: Descriptors play an important role in data-driven materials design. While most descriptors of crystalline materials emphasize structure and composition, they often neglect the electron density - a complex yet fundamental quantity that governs material properties. Here, we introduce Betti curves as topological descriptors that compress electron densities into compact representations. Derived from persistent homology, Betti curves capture bonding characteristics by encoding components, cycles, and voids across varied electron density thresholds. Machine learning models trained on Betti curves outperform those trained on raw electron densities by an average of 33 percentage points in classifying structure prototypes, predicting thermodynamic stability, and distinguishing metals from non-metals. Shannon entropy calculations reveal that Betti curves retain comparable information content to electron density while requiring two orders of magnitude less data. By combining expressive power with compact representation, Betti curves highlight the potential of topological data analysis to advance materials design.

Title: Deconfined quantum criticality in a frustrated Haldane chain with single-ion anisotropy
Authors: Niels T. Pronk, Bowy M. La Rivi√®re, Natalia Chepiga
Abstract: We report a phase diagram of the antiferromagnetic spin-1 chain with nearest-neighbor Heisenberg and three-site interactions in the presence of single-ion anisotropy. We show that the Gaussian and Ising transitions that separate the topological Haldane phase from the two anisotropic phases eventually fuse into a higher symmetry point characterized by the Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) SU(2)$_2$ critical theory providing a lattice realization of the conformal embedding. On the other side of the WZW multi-critical point, the Ising critical line reappears together with the eight-vertex transition. This transition is a one-dimensional realization of a deconfined quantum criticality separating the dimerized and Ising antiferromagnetic phases - two ordered phases with incompatible order parameters.

Title: Variational solution of the superconducting Anderson impurity model and the band-edge singularity phenomena
Authors: Teodor Iliƒçin, Rok ≈Ωitko
Abstract: We propose a set of variational wavefunctions for the sub-gap spin-doublet and spin-singlet eigenstates of the particle-hole symmetric superconducting Anderson impurity model. The wavefunctions include up to two Bogoliubov quasiparticles in the continuum which is necessary to correctly capture the weak-coupling asymptotics in all parameter regimes. The eigenvalue problems reduce to solving transcendental equations. We investigate how the lowest singlet state evolves with increasing charge repulsion $U$, transitioning from a proximitized state (a superposition of empty and doubly occupied impurity orbitals, corresponding to an Andreev bound state) to a local moment that is Kondo screened by Bogoliubov quasiparticles (Yu-Shiba-Rusinov state). This change occurs for $U = 2\Delta$, where $\Delta$ is the BCS gap. At this point, the band-edge effects make the eigenenergy scale in a singular way as $\Gamma^{2/3}$, where $\Gamma$ is the hybridization strength. Away from this special point, regular $\Gamma$-linear behavior is recovered, but only for $\Gamma \lesssim (U/2-\Delta)^2/\Delta$. The singular behavior thus extends over a broad range of parameters, including those relevant for some quantum devices in current use. The singular state is an equal-superposition state with maximal fluctuations between the local impurity charge configurations. Accurately capturing the band-edge singularity requires a continuum model, and it cannot be correctly described by discrete (truncated) models such as the zero-bandwidth approximation or the superconducting atomic limit. We determine the region of parameter space where the second spin-singlet state exists: in addition to the whole $U<2\Delta$ ABS region, it also includes a small part of the $U>2\Delta$ YSR region for finite values of $\Gamma$, as long as some ABS wavefunction component is admixed.

Title: Grotthuss-type oxygen hole polaron transport in desodiated Na$_{2}$Mn$_3$O$_7$
Authors: Ming Lei, Iwnetim I. Abate
Abstract: Polarons are quasiparticles that arise from the coupling of electrons or holes with ionic vibrations in polarizable materials. Typically, they are either localized at a single atomic site or delocalized over multiple sites. However, after the desodiation of Na$_{2}$Mn$_{3}$O$_{7}$, we identify a rare split-hole polaron, where a single hole is shared between two adjacent oxygen atoms rather than fully localized or delocalized. We present a density functional theory (DFT) study on the migration and transport properties of these oxygen hole polarons in NaMn$_{3}$O$_{7}$ and Na$_{1.5}$Mn$_{3}$O$_{7}$. Our calculations reveal that the split polaron configuration near a sodium vacancy is the ground state, while the localized polaron acts as the transition state. Migration occurs via a stepwise charge transfer mechanism along the $b$-axis, where the split-hole polaron transitions through a localized hole state. This transport behavior closely resembles the Grotthuss mechanism, which describes proton transport in H$_{2}$O. We compute the polaron mobility as $\mu$ = 1.37 $\times$ 10$^{-5}$ cm$^2$/(V$\cdot$s) with an energy barrier of 242 meV. Using the Mulliken-Hush theory, we determine the electronic coupling parameter $V_{AB}$ = 0.87 eV. A similar migration mechanism is observed in Na$_{1.5}$Mn$_{3}$O$_{7}$, where the split polaron remains more stable than in the localized state. This study provides the first theoretical investigation of split-hole polaron migration, offering new insights into the charge transport of exotic polaronic species in materials with implications for a wide range of functional materials including battery cathodes, thermoelectrics, photocatalysts, and next-generation optoelectronic devices.

Title: Roton Superconductivity from Loop-Current Chern Metal on the Kagome Lattice
Authors: Zhan Wang, Keyu Zeng, Ziqiang Wang
Abstract: Motivated by the evidence for time-reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking in nonmagnetic kagome metals AV3Sb5, a novel electronic order of persistent orbital loop-current (LC) has been proposed for the observed charge density wave (CDW) state. The LC order and its impact on the succeeding superconducting (SC) state are central to the new physics of the kagome materials. We show that the LC order fundamentally changes the pairing instability and the SC state, leading to an extraordinary topological superconductor, dubbed as a roton superconductor. In the single-orbital model on the kagome lattice, the LC-CDW state is a Chern metal near van Hove filling with a partially filled Chern band hosting 3 Chern Fermi pockets (CFPs). Cooper pairing of quasiparticles on the CFPs generates 3 SC components coupled by complex Josephson couplings induced by the TRS breaking LC. Due to the discrete quantum geometry associated with the 3-fold rotation and sublattice permutation, a small LC produces a large Josephson phase that drives the leading SC instability to the roton superconductor where the relative phases of the 3 SC components are locked at 120¬∞, forming an emergent vortex-antivortex lattice with pair density modulations. Properties of the roton superconductor include topological chiral edge states carrying nonzero electric currents, fractional 1/3 vortex excitations and charge-6e Cooper pair triplets that are immune to the internal chiral phase fluctuations. We discuss these SC properties in connection to recent experimental evidence for TRS breaking chiral SC state in kagome superconductors, exhibiting pair density modulations, zero-field SC diode effect, and charge-6e flux quantization. These findings are also relevant for the interplay between the orbital-driven quantum anomalous Hall and SC states in other systems, e.g. the graphene and transition metal dichalcogenide based quantum materials.

Title: Graphene Enhanced Resonant Raman Spectroscopy of Gallium Nitride Nanocrystals

Abstract: The scattering of lattice excitations (phonons) with the photoexcited charge carriers is of a major concern in optoelectronic devices. Here, the resonant Raman scattering will be utilized to study an exciton-phonon interaction in GaN nanocrystals, further enhanced by the underlying graphene. Raman spectroscopy using various excitation energies shows how the exciton-phonon interaction behaves, unveiling the scattering strength. The origin of the interaction is in the condition of resonance, which is directly observed in the temperature resolved spectra. Most importantly, the underlying graphene strongly enhances the coupling of phonons and excitons. Consequently, an enhanced resonant Raman spectrum of GaN nanocrystals possessing clearly observable phonon overtones up to the 4th order has been obtained. It has been demonstrated that the responsible effect is the electron transfer between nanocrystals and the underlying graphene. The utilization of such an increased coupling effect can be beneficial for a study of the charge carrier scattering in semiconducting nanomaterials, analysis of their crystal quality, improvement of sensor sensitivity and in the subsequent development of new-generation optoelectronic devices.

Title: Ab initio molecular dynamics of paramagnetic uranium mononitride (UN) using disordered local moments
Authors: Mohamed AbdulHameed, Benjamin Beeler
Abstract: This work presents an investigation of the thermophysical properties of paramagnetic uranium mononitride (UN) using ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations combined with the disordered local moment (DLM) approach. This methodology accurately captures the high-temperature paramagnetic state of UN, addressing the limitations of standard density functional theory (DFT) models. The AIMD+DLM model consistently predicts a cubic crystal structure for UN across all considered temperatures, aligning with experimental observations of its paramagnetic phase. Key thermophysical properties, including the lattice parameter and specific heat capacity, are computed and compared to experimental data. The calculated lattice parameter is somewhat underestimated relative to the empirical correlation, consistent with prior studies modeling UN as a ferromagnetic (FM) or antiferromagnetic (AFM) material. The specific heat capacity exhibits overestimation at low temperatures (300--500 K) and slight underestimation at higher temperatures, while closely following the experimental trend. These results highlight the accuracy and utility of the AIMD+DLM framework in modeling paramagnetic materials, which can offer insights into the influence of the magnetic state on the behavior of nuclear fuels at high temperatures.

Title: All-optical electric field sensing with nanodiamond-doped polymer thin films
Authors: Roy Styles, Mengke Han, Toon Goris, James Partridge, Brett C. Johnson, Blanca del Rosal, Amanda N. Abraham, Heike Ebendorff-Heidepriem, Brant C. Gibson, Nikolai Dontschuk, Jean-Philippe Tetienne, Philipp Reineck
Abstract: The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center is a photoluminescent defect in diamond that exists in different charge states, NV$^-$ and NV$^0$, that are sensitive to the NV's nanoscale environment. Here, we show that photoluminescence (PL) from NV centers in fluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs) can be employed for all-optical voltage sensing based on electric field-induced NV charge state modulation. More than 95% of FNDs integrated into a capacitor device show a transient increase in NV$^-$ PL intensity of up to 31% within 0.1 ms after application of an external voltage, accompanied by a simultaneous decrease in NV$^0$ PL. The change in NV$^-$ PL increases with increasing applied voltage from 0 to 100 V, corresponding to an electric field of 0 to 625 kV cm$^ {-1}$ in our devices. The electric field sensitivity of a single FND is 19 V cm$^{-1}$ Hz$^ {-1/2}$. We investigate the NV charge state photodynamics on the millisecond timescale and find that the change in NV PL strongly depends on the rate of photoexcitation. We propose a model that qualitatively explains the observed changes in NV PL based on an electric field-induced redistribution of photoexcited electrons from substitutional nitrogen defects to NV centers, leading to a transient conversion of NV$^0$ to NV$^-$ centers upon application of an external voltage. Our results contribute to the development of FNDs as reliable, all-optical, nanoscale electric field sensors in solid-state systems.

Title: The Two-Fluid Theory for Superfluid Hydrodynamics and Rotational Motion
Authors: Phil Attard
Abstract: The two-fluid theory for superfluid hydrodynamics is derived from the fountain pressure result that condensed bosons move at constant entropy and are driven by the chemical potential gradient. Explicit results for $^4$He show that the superfluid has vorticity, which is consistent with measured data but inconsistent with Landau's principle that superfluid flow is irrotational.

Abstract: Complex chalcogenides in the $M$PS$_3$ family of materials ($M$ = Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni) display remarkably different phase progressions depending upon the metal center orbital filling, character of the P-P linkage, and size of the van der Waals gap. There is also a stacking pattern and spin state difference between the lighter and heavier transition metal-containing systems that places CoPS$_3$ at the nexus of these activities. Despite these unique properties, this compound is under-explored. Here, we bring together Raman scattering spectroscopy and infrared absorption spectroscopy with X-ray techniques to identify a structural component to the 119 K magnetic ordering transition as well as a remarkable lower temperature set of magnon-phonon pairs that engage in avoided crossings along with a magnetic scattering continuum that correlates with phonon lifetime effects. These findings point to strong spin-phonon entanglement as well as opportunities to control these effects under external stimuli.

Title: Searching for topological semi-complete bandgap in elastic truss lattices
Authors: Yiran Hao, Dong Liu, Liyou Luo, Jialu Mu, Hanyu Wang, Zibo Liu, Jensen Li, Zhihong Zhu, Qinghua Guo, Biao Yang
Abstract: Gapless topological phases have attracted significant interest across both quantum and classical systems owing to their novel physics and promising applications. However, the search for ideal gapless topological nodes inside a clear bandgap is still lacking in elastic systems. The degenerate points are always hidden in the trivial bulk bands due to the intricate elastic modes involved. Here, we find a topological semi-complete bandgap in a three-dimensional elastic truss lattice by tuning a supporting rod, which exhibits a complete bandgap except for the inevitable topological degenerate points. Furthermore, we experimentally map the topological semi-complete bandgap and the inside nontrivial surface state arcs with a scanning laser vibrometer. The introduced scheme provides a systematic approach for the idealization of semi-complete bandgaps and thus may significantly advance the practical utility of topological phases in mechanical engineering domains.

Title: Eigenstate Thermalization and its breakdown in Quantum Spin Chains with Inhomogeneous Interactions
Authors: Ding-Zu Wang, Hao Zhu, Jian Cui, Javier Arg√ºello-Luengo, Maciej Lewenstein, Guo-Feng Zhang, Piotr Sierant, Shi-Ju Ran
Abstract: The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) is a successful theory that establishes the criteria for ergodicity and thermalization in isolated quantum many-body systems. In this work, we investigate the thermalization properties of spin-$ 1/2 $ XXZ chain with linearly-inhomogeneous interactions. We demonstrate that introduction of the inhomogeneous interactions leads to an onset of quantum chaos and thermalization, which, however, becomes inhibited for sufficiently strong inhomogeneity. To exhibit ETH, and to display its breakdown upon varying the strength of interactions, we probe statistics of energy levels and properties of matrix elements of local observables in eigenstates of the inhomogeneous XXZ spin chain. Moreover, we investigate the dynamics of the entanglement entropy and the survival probability which further evidence the thermalization and its breakdown in the considered model. We outline a way to experimentally realize the XXZ chain with linearly-inhomogeneous interactions in systems of ultracold atoms. Our results highlight a mechanism of emergence of ETH due to insertion of inhomogeneities in an otherwise integrable system and illustrate the arrest of quantum dynamics in presence of strong interactions.

Abstract: All-optical logic has the potential to overcome the operation speed barrier that has persisted in electronic circuits for two decades. However, the development of scalable architectures has been prevented so far by the lack of materials with sufficiently strong nonlinear interactions needed to realize compact and efficient ultrafast all-optical switches with optical gain. Microcavities with embedded organic material in the strong light-matter interaction regime have recently enabled all-optical transistors operating at room temperature with picosecond switching times. However, the vertical cavity geometry, which is predominantly used in polaritonics, is not suitable for complex circuits with on-chip coupled transistors. Here, by leveraging state-of-the-art silicon photonics technology, we have achieved exciton-polariton condensation at ambient conditions in fully integrated high-index contrast sub-wavelength grating microcavities filled with a pi-conjugated polymer as optically active material. We demonstrate ultrafast all-optical transistor action by coupling two resonators and utilizing seeded polariton condensation. With a device area as small as 2x2 um^2, we realize picosecond switching and amplification up to 60x, with extinction ratio up to 8:1. This compact ultrafast transistor device with in-plane integration is a key component for a scalable platform for all-optical logic circuits that could operate two orders of magnitude faster than electronic ones.

Title: Finding ground states of a square Newman-Moore lattice with sides equal to a Mersenne number using the Rule 60 cellular automaton
Authors: Jon√°s Carmona-P√≠rez, Adrian J. Peguero, Vanja Dunjko, Maxim Olshanii, Joanna Ruhl
Abstract: We offer detailed proofs of some properties of the Rule 60 cellular automaton on a ring with a Mersenne number circumference. We then use these properties to define a propagator, and demonstrate its use to construct all the ground state configurations of the classical Newman-Moore model on a square lattice of the same size. In this particular case, the number of ground states is equal to half of the available spin configurations in any given row of the lattice.

Title: Towards scalable bound-to-resonance extrapolations for few- and many-body systems
Authors: Nuwan Yapa, Sebastian K√∂nig, K√©vin Fossez
Abstract: In open quantum many-body systems, the theoretical description of resonant states of many particles strongly coupled to the continuum can be challenging. Such states are commonplace in, for example, exotic nuclei and hadrons, and can reveal important information about the underlying forces at play in these systems. In this work, we demonstrate that the complex-augmented eigenvector continuation (CA-EC) method, originally formulated for the two-body problem with uniform complex scaling, can reliably perform bound-to-resonance extrapolations for genuine three-body resonances having no bound subsystems. We first establish that three-body bound-to-resonance extrapolations are possible by benchmarking different few-body approaches, and we provide arguments to explain how the extrapolation works in the many-body case. We furthermore pave the way towards scalable resonance extrapolations in many-body systems by showing that the CA-EC method also works in the Berggren basis, studying a realistic application using the Gamow shell model.

Title: Preventing overfitting in infrared ellipsometry using temperature dependence: fused silica as a case study
Authors: Shenwei Yin, Jin-Woo Cho, Demeng Feng, Hongyan Mei, Tanuj Kumar, Chenghao Wan, Yeonghoon Jin, Minjeong Kim, Mikhail A. Kats
Abstract: Fitting oscillator models to variable-angle spectroscopic ellipsometry (VASE) data can lead to non-unique, unphysical results. We demonstrate using temperature-dependent trends to prevent overfitting and ensure model physicality. As a case study, we performed mid-infrared VASE measurements on fused silica (SiO2) of various grades, from room temperature to 600 ¬∞C. We fitted oscillator models independently at each temperature, and confirmed the model's physical validity by observing the expected monotonic trends in vibrational oscillator parameters. Using this technique, we generated a highly accurate dataset for the temperature-dependent complex refractive index of fused silica for modeling mid-infrared optical components such as thermal emitters.

Title: Precision bounds for multiple currents in open quantum systems
Authors: Saulo V. Moreira, Marco Radaelli, Alessandro Candeloro, Felix C. Binder, Mark T. Mitchison
Abstract: Thermodynamic (TUR) and kinetic (KUR) uncertainty relations are fundamental bounds constraining the fluctuations of current observables in classical, non-equilibrium systems. Several works have verified, however, violations of these classical bounds in open quantum systems, motivating the derivation of new quantum TURs and KURs that account for the role of quantum coherence. Here, we go one step further by deriving multidimensional KUR and TUR for multiple observables in open quantum systems undergoing Markovian dynamics. Our derivation exploits a multi-parameter metrology approach, in which the Fisher information matrix plays a central role. Crucially, our bounds are tighter than previously derived quantum TURs and KURs for single observables, precisely because they incorporate correlations between multiple observables. We also find an intriguing quantum signature of correlations that is captured by the off-diagonal element of the Fisher information matrix, which vanishes for classical stochastic dynamics. By considering two examples, namely a coherently driven qubit system and the three-level maser, we demonstrate that the multidimensional quantum KUR bound can even be saturated when the observables are perfectly correlated.

Title: Fault-tolerant quantum simulation of generalized Hubbard models
Authors: Andreas Juul Bay-Smidt, Frederik Ravn Klausen, Christoph S√ºnderhauf, R√≥bert Izs√°k, Gemma C. Solomon, Nick S. Blunt
Abstract: Quantum simulations of strongly interacting fermionic systems, such as those described by the Hubbard model, are promising candidates for useful early fault-tolerant quantum computing applications. This paper presents Tile Trotterization, a generalization of plaquette Trotterization (PLAQ), which uses a set of tiles to construct Trotter decompositions of arbitrary lattice Hubbard models. The Tile Trotterization scheme also enables the simulation of more complex models, including the extended Hubbard model. We improve previous Hubbard model commutator bounds, further provide tight commutator bounds for periodic extended Hubbard models, and demonstrate the use of tensor network methods for this task. We consider applications of Tile Trotterization to simulate hexagonal lattice Hubbard models and compare the resource requirements of Tile Trotterization for performing quantum phase estimation to a qubitization-based approach, demonstrating that Tile Trotterization scales more efficiently with system size. These advancements significantly broaden the potential applications of early fault-tolerant quantum computers to models of practical interest in materials research and organic chemistry.

Title: Measuring Decoherence Due to Quantum Vacuum Fluctuations
Authors: Anirudh Gundhi, Hendrik Ulbricht
Abstract: The interaction of a particle with vacuum fluctuations--which theoretically exist even in the complete absence of matter--can lead to observable irreversible decoherence if it were possible to switch on and off the particle charge suddenly. We compute the leading order decoherence effect for such a scenario and propose an experimental setup for its detection. Such a measurement might provide further insights into the nature of vacuum fluctuations and a novel precision test for the decoherence theory.

Title: Non-Markovianity of subsystem dynamics in isolated quantum many-body systems
Authors: Aditya Banerjee
Abstract: It is believed that an isolated and far-from-equilibrium quantum many-body system should try to attain equilibrium via a mechanism whereby any given subsystem acts as an open quantum system that is coupled to an environment, which is the complementary part of the full system, and undergoes a complicated equilibration process such that all the subsystems in the long-time limit attain equilibrium states compatible with the global equilibrium state. This picture begs the question whether the dynamics of any given subsystem is Markovian (monotonic loss of information and memory) or non-Markovian. In this work, by numerically probing the dynamical behaviour of the quantum distances between $\textit{temporally-separated}$ states of small subsystems, we reveal the telltale signatures of (non-)Markovianity of the dynamics of subsystems of an isolated quantum spin system brought in the far-from-equilibrium regime, exemplified with the mixed-field Ising spin chain quenched between parameter regimes deep inside its magnetically ordered and disordered regimes. Additionally, remarkably systematic behaviour is seen in a measure of classical distances between the quantum states of the considered subsystems. These features strongly depend on the direction of quenching in the parameter space, with paramagnetic-to-ferromagnetic quenches offering considerably stronger signatures of subsystem non-Markovianity, for which we offer heuristic arguments.

Title: Diverse Topology Optimization using Modulated Neural Fields
Authors: Andreas Radler, Eric Volkmann, Johannes Brandstetter, Arturs Berzins
Abstract: Topology optimization (TO) is a family of computational methods that derive near-optimal geometries from formal problem descriptions. Despite their success, established TO methods are limited to generating single solutions, restricting the exploration of alternative designs. To address this limitation, we introduce Topology Optimization using Modulated Neural Fields (TOM) - a data-free method that trains a neural network to generate structurally compliant shapes and explores diverse solutions through an explicit diversity constraint. The network is trained with a solver-in-the-loop, optimizing the material distribution in each iteration. The trained model produces diverse shapes that closely adhere to the design requirements. We validate TOM on 2D and 3D TO problems. Our results show that TOM generates more diverse solutions than any previous method, all while maintaining near-optimality and without relying on a dataset. These findings open new avenues for engineering and design, offering enhanced flexibility and innovation in structural optimization.

Title: Efficient optimization of neural network backflow for ab-initio quantum chemistry
Authors: An-Jun Liu, Bryan K. Clark
Abstract: The ground state of second-quantized quantum chemistry Hamiltonians is key to determining molecular properties. Neural quantum states (NQS) offer flexible and expressive wavefunction ansatze for this task but face two main challenges: highly peaked ground-state wavefunctions hinder efficient sampling, and local energy evaluations scale quartically with system size, incurring significant computational costs. In this work, we overcome these challenges by introducing a suite of algorithmic enhancements, which includes efficient periodic compact subspace construction, truncated local energy evaluations, improved stochastic sampling, and physics-informed modifications. Applying these techniques to the neural network backflow (NNBF) ansatz, we demonstrate significant gains in both accuracy and scalability. Our enhanced method surpasses traditional quantum chemistry methods like CCSD and CCSD(T), outperforms other NQS approaches, and achieves competitive energies with state-of-the-art ab initio techniques such as HCI, ASCI, FCIQMC, and DMRG. A series of ablation and comparative studies quantifies the contribution of each enhancement to the observed improvements in accuracy and efficiency. Furthermore, we investigate the representational capacity of the ansatz, finding that its performance correlates with the inverse participation ratio (IPR), with more delocalized states being more challenging to approximate.

Title: Path integral spin dynamics with exchange and external field
Authors: Thomas Nussle, Stam Nicolis, Iason Sofos, Joseph Barker
Abstract: In this work, we propose a path integral-inspired formalism for computing the quantum thermal expectation values of spin systems, when subject to magnetic fields that can be time-dependent and can accommodate the presence of Heisenberg exchange interactions between the spins. This is done by deriving an effective magnetic field from the quantum partition function of the system to use in classical atomistic spin dynamics simulations and generalises the formalism presented in our previous work [Phys. Rev. Research 5, 043075 (2023)]. In special cases where the effective field can be computed exactly we compare our results with exact/numerical diagonalisation methods for both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic coupling. We show that our method works well across a large temperature range and can reproduce quantum expectation values for antiferromagnetic coupling which is usually not possible with classical models.

Title: Localization in the Dirac spectrum and gauge-field topology
Authors: Claudio Bonanno, Matteo Giordano
Abstract: We study localization of the low Dirac modes in 3+1 dimensional pure $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ gauge theory at zero and nonzero imaginary $\theta$ angle, with the aim of better characterizing the relation between low-mode localization and topological features of gauge theories. We show that the mobility edge observed in the deconfined phase at $\theta=0$ is present also at nonzero $\theta$, appearing exactly at the deconfinement transition. We find that the mobility edge is affected by topology only indirectly, through its effects on the ordering of the Polyakov loop. Moreover, the change in the mobility edge is strongly correlated with the change in the Polyakov-loop expectation value, both as one moves along the critical line, and as one departs from it toward higher temperatures. This further strengthens the connection between low-mode localization and deconfinement, showing in particular the key role played by the ordering of the Polyakov loop.

Title: Plasmon-interband hybridization and anomalous production of hot electrons in aluminum nanoantennas

Abstract: Strong coupling typically occurs between two separate objects or between an object and its environment (such as an atom and a cavity). However, it can also occur between two different excitations within the same object, a situation that has been much less studied. In this study, we observe strong coupling between localized surface plasmon resonances and the interband transition in aluminum nanorods, as evidenced by optical spectroscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy, and corroborated with numerical simulations. Strong coupling is observed between the interband transition and multiple orders of the surface plasmon mode, including dark ones. We also obtain experimental maps of the hybrid modes at the nanoscale. In each case, the associated Rabi energy, which corresponds to the energy splitting between the two polaritonic branches, is obtained. Finally, a dedicated numerical model was employed to calculate the hot electron generation rate in the nanorods. The calculations demonstrate that efficient generation of hot electrons can be achieved in the near-infrared region, when the interband transition is strongly coupled with a plasmon resonance. This high generation rate stems from the hybrid nature of the mode, as its plasmonic component provides a high absorption cross-section, while the IT part ensures efficient conversion to hot electrons. Consequently, aluminum nanorods represent an efficient source of hot electrons in the visible and near-infrared regions, with potential applications in local photochemistry, photodetection, and solar energy harvesting.

Title: Beyond Robertson-Schr√∂dinger: A General Uncertainty Relation Unveiling Hidden Noncommutative Trade-offs
Authors: Gen Kimura, Aina Mayumi, Hiromichi Ohno, Jaeha Lee, Dariusz Chru≈õci≈Ñski
Abstract: We report a universal strengthening of the Robertson-Schr\''odinger uncertainty relation, revealing a previously overlooked trade-off of genuinely quantum origin, particularly as the state becomes more mixed. Remarkably, this generalized bound supplements the standard commutator term and the covariance term with an additional positive contribution that depends on the commutator of observables. The relation also rigorously proves and extends a conjectured uncertainty relation previously proposed in [Phys. Rev. A 110, 062215 (2024)]. For two-level quantum systems, the inequality becomes an exact equality for any state and any pair of observables, establishing that the bound is tight in the strongest possible sense.

Title: Quasiparticle-induced decoherence of a driven superconducting qubit
Authors: Mykola Kishmar, Pavel D. Kurilovich, Andrey Klots, Thomas Connolly, Igor L. Aleiner, Vladislav D. Kurilovich
Abstract: We develop a theory for two quasiparticle-induced decoherence mechanisms of a driven superconducting qubit. In the first mechanism, an existing quasiparticle (QP) tunnels across the qubit's Josephson junction while simultaneously absorbing a qubit excitation and one (or several) photons from the drive. In the second mechanism, a qubit transition occurs during the non-linear absorption process converting multiple drive quanta into a pair of new QPs. Both mechanisms can remain significant in gap engineered qubits whose coherence is insensitive to QPs without the drive. Our theory establishes a fundamental limitation on fidelity of the microwave qubit operations, such as readout and gates, stemming from QPs.
