Title: Origin of pressure-induced anomalies in the nodal-line ferrimagnet Mn$_3$Si$_2$Te$_6$
Authors: Varun Venkatasubramanian, Makoto Shimizu, Daniel Guterding, Harald O. Jeschke
Abstract: A pressure-induced insulator-to-metal transition (IMT) has recently been discovered in the nodal-line ferrimagnet Mn$_3$Si$_2$Te$_6$. The electronic phase transition is accompanied by anomalies in the magnetic ordering temperature and the anomalous Hall conductivity, which peak at or near the critical pressure of the IMT. We perform density functional theory (DFT) calculations as a function of pressure to reveal the driving factors behind the IMT and the magnetic anomalies in Mn$_3$Si$_2$Te$_6$. We extract Heisenberg Hamiltonians as a function of pressure based on our DFT calculations. Our classical Monte Carlo simulations for these Hamiltonians yield ordering temperatures and magnetic ordering patterns, in agreement with the experimental data. Although we can accurately explain the evolution of magnetism with pressure, it seems that the anomalous Hall conductivity in Mn$_3$Si$_2$Te$_6$ cannot be accounted for by intrinsic contributions alone.

Title: SU(4) Kondo Lattice in Semiconductor Moiré Materials
Authors: Sunghoon Kim
Abstract: Motivated by recent advances in transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) moiré materials, we propose TMD moiré multilayers as a platform for realizing an approximately SU(4)-symmetric triangular Kondo lattice, generalizing the concept of the double quantum dot model. Our model extends the conventional Kondo lattice by incorporating a three-site exchange of SU(4) local moments, which drives spontaneous time-reversal and lattice symmetry breaking. Using a parton mean-field approach, we map out the phase diagram as a function of three-site exchange and hole doping. In the Kondo-unscreened regime, we identify Mott insulating phases, including bond-ordered states and a chiral spin liquid. With increasing doping, Kondo hybridization gives rise to a heavy Fermi liquid that exhibits distinct patterns of lattice symmetry breaking, with or without topological responses. We conclude with directions for future study.

Title: Localization and topological signatures under periodic twisting
Authors: James Walkling, Antonio Štrkalj, F. Nur Ünal
Abstract: We theoretically explore a dynamical generalization of the Aubry-André model in two dimensions formed by superimposing two square-lattice potentials. Motivated by the rich physics emerging at different twist angles between the two lattices at equilibrium, we introduce periodic twisting by continuously rotating one of the lattices with respect to the other in the plane. We demonstrate that the distinct time-dependent twisting in this system gives rise to an intricate form of periodic multi-frequency driving that changes with the distance from the rotation axis. We find that the incommensurate nature of the potential no longer plays the pivotal role as it does in the static case. Rather, the tunneling can be understood in terms of a local, spatially varying dynamical localization effect, which we show to yield ring-shaped states localized within the bulk that have interesting transport signatures. Quantifying the eigenstates with the Bott index and local Chern marker, we find that there is a zoo of states with non-trivial topological signatures, the most ubiquitous of which result in relatively uniform ring-shaped regions of the Chern marker. We investigate the origin of these effects from various angles and identify that hybridization between different delocalized ring states plays a vital role. Lastly, we discuss possible experimental realizations in quantum simulation settings. Our results open a new avenue of investigation with periodic twisting inducing a spatially varying multi-frequency drive.

Title: Obtaining the Spectral Function of Moiré Graphene Heavy-Fermions Using Iterative Perturbation Theory
Authors: Dumitru Călugăru, Haoyu Hu, Lorenzo Crippa, Gautam Rai, Nicolas Regnault, Tim O. Wehling, Roser Valentí, Giorgio Sangiovanni, B. Andrei Bernevig
Abstract: The spectral functions of twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) in the absence of strain have recently been investigated in both the symmetric and symmetry-broken phases using dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT). The theoretically predicted Mott-Hubbard bands and gapless semimetallic state at half-filling have since been confirmed experimentally. Here, we develop several second-order perturbation theory approaches to the topological heavy-fermion (THF) model of TBG and twisted symmetric trilayer graphene (TSTG). In the symmetric phase, we adapt, implement, and benchmark an iterative perturbation theory (IPT) impurity solver within DMFT, enabling computationally efficient yet accurate spectral function calculations. We present momentum- and energy-resolved spectra over a broad range of temperatures and fillings for both symmetric and symmetry-broken states. In addition, we derive analytic expressions for the spectral function within the ``Hubbard-I'' approximation of the THF model and, as expected, find that while it provides a tractable description of Mott physics, it does not capture the low-energy Kondo peak or the finite lifetime broadening of the bands. Our methodology can be extended to include strain, lattice relaxation, and parameter variations, thereby allowing systematic predictions of TBG and TSTG spectral properties across a wide range of physical regimes. Because our perturbative approaches are far less computationally intensive than DMFT with numerically exact impurity solvers, they can be used to efficiently benchmark and scan extensive phase diagrams of the THF parameters, paving the way for full DMFT analyses of the TBG spectral function in the presence of strain and relaxation.

Title: Instability of Laughlin FQH liquids into gapless power-law correlated states with continuous exponents in ideal Chern bands: rigorous results from plasma mapping
Authors: Saranyo Moitra, Inti Sodemann Villadiego
Abstract: We investigate the fate of Laughlin's wave-function in ideal Chern bands which can be mapped to generalized zero Landau levels in spatially dependent magnetic fields. By exploiting its exact mapping onto a classical Coulomb gas and leveraging previous results of one-component plasmas in nonuniform neutralizing backgrounds, we demonstrate that the ideal Laughlin wave-function undergoes a phase transition from its well-known fully gapped topologically ordered plasma state into a power-law correlated dielectric state even for the fixed filling of $1/3$, as the magnetic field becomes increasingly more inhomogeneous. This dielectric state is gapless even though it does not spontaneously break translational symmetry. Remarkably, for a fixed filling $\nu=1/m$, the exponent governing density correlations in this state changes continuously as a function of the degree of spatial inhomogeneity of the magnetic field, and can range from $4$ near a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition to the plasma state, up to $2 m$ in the limit of fields generated by point solenoids.

Title: Structures of group-15 elemental solids from an effective boundary theory
Authors: Ashland Knowles, R. Ganesh
Abstract: We present an effective description for the crystal structures of pnictogen elemental solids. In these materials, each atom contains three valence electrons in $p$ orbitals. They are shared between neighbouring atoms to form valence bonds. We propose a trivalent network model on the simple cubic lattice. As a generalization of a dimer model, we impose a constraint that three dimers must touch every site. We argue that intra-orbital Coulomb repulsion prohibits the formation of two adjacent, parallel dimers. This leads to a tripod-like local configuration at every site. More importantly, it forces every line of the cubic lattice to have alternating dimers and blanks. There is no dynamics as dimers cannot be locally rearranged. A bulk-boundary mapping emerges whereby bonds in the interior are fully described by Ising variables on three bounding planes -- a simple example of holography that may be realized in real materials. To describe the energetics of bonding, we formulate a minimal model in terms of boundary Ising spins. Symmetries reduce the problem to that of three identical, independent, two-dimensional Ising models. An antiferromagnetic Ising-ground-state corresponds to the A7 structure seen in antimony and grey arsenic. An antiferromagnetic phase within a bilayer describes the structure of phosphorene. By stacking such bilayers, we obtain the A17 structure of black phosphorus. The stripe phase of the Ising models describes the cubic gauche structure of nitrogen. As a testable signature, we demonstrate that single impurities will induce long-ranged domain walls.

Title: Cyclo-Graphyne: A Highly Porous and Semimetallic 2D Carbon Allotrope with Dirac Cones
Authors: Jhionathan de Lima, Cristiano Francisco Woellner
Abstract: We present a comprehensive characterization of Cyclo-graphyne (CGY), an emerging 2D carbon allotrope with a porous structure of sp/sp$^2$-hybridized carbon atoms. Using density functional theory, we systematically investigate its structural, energetic, dynamical, thermal, electronic, mechanical, optical, and vibrational properties. The calculated cohesive and formation energies are both comparable to those of other synthesized graphynes, confirming its energetic viability. Phonon dispersion calculations confirm its dynamical stability, while ab initio molecular dynamics simulations indicate thermal stability up to at least 1000 K. Electronic results reveal that CGY is a semimetal with an ultranarrow band gap and features two Dirac cones in its electronic structure. Mechanically, CGY is highly compliant and isotropic, exhibiting a Young's modulus an order of magnitude lower than that of graphene. The optical spectrum reveals strong ultraviolet absorption and infrared reflectivity with an isotropic response, while the vibrational spectra show distinct Raman peaks and rich infrared activity. These properties position CGY as a promising candidate for future applications in areas such as gas capture and separation, flexible nanoelectronics, and optoelectronics.

Title: The Frenkel line and the pseudogap: an analogy between classical and electronic fluids
Authors: J. Fournier, P.-O. Downey, O. Gingras, C.-D. Hébert, M. Charlebois, A.-M. S. Tremblay
Abstract: Asymptotically close to critical end-points of first-order transitions, maxima in thermodynamic quantities occur along a line called the Widom line, a concept first introduced in classical fluids. This concept has been extended to strongly correlated electronic fluids in the context of the Mott transition. Namely, upon increasing interaction strength in the Hubbard model at half-filling, one finds a first-order Mott metal-insulator transition with a critical end-point at high temperature above which a number of crossover lines are observable. Using the dynamical cluster approximation for the triangular-lattice Hubbard model, we compute the Frenkel line, another concept borrowed from classical fluids, useful to define a sharp crossover between the pseudogap and the correlated Fermi liquid. The Frenkel line in the electron fluid is defined by the appearance of back-scattering when entering the pseudogap. The signature of back-scattering is the existence of a negative value in the time-domain optical conductivity.

Title: All-magnonic neurons for analog artificial neural networks
Authors: David Breitbach, Moritz Bechberger, Hanadi Mortada, Björn Heinz, Roman Verba, Qi Wang, Carsten Dubs, Mario Carpentieri, Giovanni Finocchio, Davi Rodrigues, Alexandre Abbass Hamadeh, Philipp Pirro
Abstract: Analog neuromorphic hardware is gaining traction as conventional digital systems struggle to keep pace with the growing energy and scalability demands of modern neural networks. Here, we present analog, fully magnonic, artificial neurons, which exploit a nonlinear magnon excitation mechanism based on the nonlinear magnonic frequency shift. This yields a sharp trigger response and tunable fading memory, as well as synaptic connections to other neurons via propagating magnons. Using micro-focused Brillouin light scattering spectroscopy on a Gallium-substituted yttrium iron garnet thin film, we show multi-neuron triggering, cascadability, and multi-input integration across interconnected neurons. Finally, we implement the experimentally verified neuron activation function in a neural network simulation, yielding high classification accuracy on standard benchmarks. The results establish all-magnonic neurons as promising devices for scalable, low-power, wave-based neuromorphic computing, highlighting their potential as building blocks for future physical neural networks.

Title: Interplay of Rashba and valley-Zeeman splittings in weak localization of spin-orbit coupled graphene
Authors: L. E. Golub
Abstract: Weak localization theory is developed for graphene heterostructures with transition metal dichalcogenides and topological insulators where the Rashba and valey-Zeeman spin-splittings of the energy spectrum are large enough. The anomalous magnetoresistance in low fields caused by weak localization is calculated. It is shown that the valley-Zeeman splitting has no effect on weak localization in the absence of Rashba splitting but it results in the change of the magnetoconductivity sign in the Rashba-coupled graphene. Inter-valley scattering also affects the quantum correction to the conductivity resulting in its sign reversal. Analytical expressions are obtained for the anomalous magnetoconductivity at arbitrary relations between the Rashba and valley-Zeeman splittings as well as the inter-valley scattering rates.

Title: Nonthermal magnetization pathways in photoexcited semiconductors
Authors: Giovanni Marini
Abstract: The stabilization of long-range magnetic order in nominally non-magnetic semi- conductors using femtosecond light pulses is an exciting yet experimentally challenging goal. Theoretical studies indicate that certain non-magnetic semi- conductors can exhibit transient magnetic instabilities following above-gap laser excitation, but the dynamical pathways leading to these states remain largely unexplored. In this work, I introduce a minimal real-time spin-orbital model and identify the fundamental microscopic mechanisms that enable the emergence of a transient magnetic order. I then discuss the relevance of these findings for real materials employing a phenomenological time-dependent Ginzburg- Landau model. Finally, I analyze the strengths and limitations of current first-principles methodologies for investigating dynamically induced broken- symmetry states in the light of the present results.

Title: Quantifying the reactivity of isolated LixSi domains in Si anodes using operando NMR
Authors: Evelyna Wang, Marco-Tulio F. Rodrigues, Baris Key
Abstract: The use of Si anodes can greatly improve the energy density of Li-ion batteries. However, understanding and mitigation of calendar aging remains a barrier to commercialization. In this short report, we utilize operando Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to detect and quantify lithium silicides (LixSi) as they form and react within Si anodes in pouch cells during calendar aging. We provide direct experimental evidence of complex aging phenomena in the Si anodes, including both SEI growth and dissolution during storage. Formation of electrochemically isolated LixSi is also observed, as indicated by the partial persistence of highly lithiated phases after the cell is discharged. Remarkably, we show that these isolated domains can themselves self-discharge over time, suggesting that their detection can be challenging in post-mortem studies. Finally, we show that aging outcomes depend heavily on the type of silicon particles contained within the electrode, and that certain surface coatings can help decrease the reactivity between lithium silicides and the electrolyte.

Title: Maze-solving with density-driven swarms
Authors: Esther María Zamora Sánchez, Sébastien Billès, Paul-Henry Glinel, Nicolas Bredeche, Raphaël Candelier
Abstract: We propose a new kind of collective motion where swarms of simple agents are able to find and fix the solution of two-dimensional mazes. The model consists of active memoryless particles interacting exclusively via short-ranged perception of local density and orientations. This system generates traveling density waves when constrained in one dimension, and self-organized swarms exploring local branches in two-dimensional mazes. Depending on a single kinetic parameter, the swarms can develop large tails and further gain long-term persistence, which ultimately allows them to robustly solve mazes of virtually any kind and size. By systematic exploration of the parameter space, we show that there exists a fast solving regime where the resolution time is linear in number of squares, hence making it an efficient maze-solving algorithm. Our model represents a new class of active systems with unprecedented contrast between the minimality of the processed information and the complexity of the resolved task, which is of prime importance for the interpretation and modeling of collective intelligence in living systems as well as for the design of future swarms of active particles and robots.

Title: Spin currents in crystals with spin-orbit coupling: multi-band effects in an effective Hamiltonian formalism
Authors: K. V. Samokhin, M. Sigrist, M. H. Fischer
Abstract: When focusing on a few essential bands in an effective description of a material to calculate observable quantities, the respective operators have to be adjusted accordingly. Ignoring contributions arising from integrating out remote bands can lead to qualitatively wrong results. We present a detailed analysis of the interband mixing effects on spin currents. Specifically, we calculate the intrinsic spin current in a time-reversal invariant noncentrosymmetric crystal in the presence of electron-lattice spin-orbit coupling. Starting from formally exact microscopic expressions, we derive the spin current operator restricted to one or more essential bands by iterative elimination of the contributions from distant bands. We show that the standard definition of the spin current operator in terms of the group velocity obtained from an effective band Hamiltonian cannot be justified using a microscopic theory. The modified expression for the spin current operator contains additional terms, which dominate the equilibrium spin current in a uniform crystal. We show that the magnitude of these additional terms can considerably exceed the spin current obtained using the standard definition.

Title: Incommensurate magnetic order drives singular angular magnetoresistance in a Weyl semimetal
Authors: X. Yao, P. Chen, R. Verma, X. Zhao, H.-Y. Yang, L. DeBeer-Schmitt, A. A. Aczel, C.-M. Wu, D. Alba Venero, T. Ohhara, K. Munakata, M. Takahashi, Y. Noda, A. Bansil, B. Singh, P. Nikolić, F. Tafti, J. Gaudet
Abstract: We demonstrate that a multi-$\mathbf{k}$ incommensurate magnetic state in the Weyl semimetal CeAlGe gives rise to singular angular magnetoresistance (SAMR), an electrical-transport signature that detects the magnetic-field direction with exceptional precision. In contrast, the sister compound CeAlSi shows neither multi-$\mathbf{k}$ order nor SAMR. Both phenomena emerge upon $\sim57\%$ Ge substitution in CeAlSi$_{1-x}$Ge$_x$ and coincide with electronic-structure changes that soften the single-ion in-plane anisotropy and enhance Weyl-mediated magnetic interactions. These results reveal a direct connection between band topology, electronic transport, and collective magnetism in Weyl semimetals.

Title: Er$_\mathrm{Al}$:Al$_2$O$_3$ for Telecom-Band Photonics: Electronic Structure and Optical Properties
Authors: Mahtab A. Khan, Jayden D. Craft, Hari P. Paudel, Yuhua Duan, Dirk R. Englund, Michael N. Leuenberger
Abstract: Er-doped Al$_2$O$_3$ is a promising host for telecom-band integrated photonics. Here we combine ab initio calculations with a symmetry-resolved analysis to elucidate substitutional Er on the Al site (Er$_\mathrm{Al}$) in $\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$. First-principles relaxations confirm the structural stability of Er$_\mathrm{Al}$. We then use the local trigonal crystal-field symmetry to classify the Er-derived impurity levels by irreducible representations and to derive polarization-resolved electric-dipole selection rules, explicitly identifying the symmetry-allowed $f$\textendash$d$ hybridization channels. Kubo--Greenwood absorption spectra computed from Kohn--Sham states quantitatively corroborate these symmetry predictions. Furthermore, we connect the calculated intra-$4f$ line strengths to Judd--Ofelt theory, clarifying the role of $4f$\textendash$5d$ admixture in enabling optical activity. Notably, we predict a characteristic absorption near $1.47~\mu\mathrm{m}$ (telecom band), relevant for on-chip amplification and emission. To our knowledge, a symmetry-resolved first-principles treatment of Er:Al$_2$O$_3$ with an explicit Judd--Ofelt interpretation has not been reported, providing a transferable framework for tailoring rare-earth dopants in wide-band-gap oxides for integrated photonics. Our results for the optical spectra are in good agreement with experimental data.

Title: Observation via spin Seebeck effect of macroscopic magnetic transport from emergent magnetic monopoles
Authors: Nan Tang, Stephan Glamsch, Aisha Aqeel, Ludwig Scheuchenpflug, Michael Schulze, Christoph Liebald, Daniel Rytz, Christo Guguschev, Manfred Albrecht, Philipp Gegenwart
Abstract: Magnetic monopoles, elusive in high-energy physics, have been realised as emergent quasiparticles in solid-state systems, where their unique properties hold promise for novel spintronic applications. Magnetic monopoles have been invoked in diverse platforms, including skyrmion lattices, chiral magnets, soft ferromagnets, aritifical nanomagnets. Yet, a demonstration of their role in magnetic transport has remained elusive. Here, we report such an observation via the spin Seebeck effect in the bulk insulating pyrochlore oxide, spin ice $\mathrm{Dy_2Ti_2O_7}$. By applying a thermal gradient perpendicular to a $[111]$-oriented magnetic field, we detect a transverse spin Seebeck voltage marked by a dominant peak at the onset of monopole proliferation, accompanied by a secondary feature and frequency-dependent behavior. Our findings establish a direct link between monopole dynamics and magnetic transport in an insulating medium, establishing a new pathway for probing fractionalized excitations and advancing towards novel spintronic applications.

Title: Generation of pure, spin polarized, and unpolarized charge currents at the few cycle limit of circularly polarized light
Authors: Deepika Gill, Sangeeta Sharma, Sam Shallcross
Abstract: In certain members of the transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) family, laser pulses of oppositely circularly polarized light excite electrons of opposite spin. Here we show that in the few cycle limit such pulses generate not only a spin density excitation, but also a spin current excitation. Employing the example of the TMDC WSe$_2$ we show that pure spin currents, the flow of spin in the absence of net charge flow, 100% spin polarized currents, and charge currents are all accessible and controllable by tuning the amplitude of ~ 5 femtosecond gap tuned light pulses. Underpinning this physics is a symmetry lowering of the valley charge excitation from C3 at long duration to C2 in the few cycle limit, imbuing the excitation with net current. Our results both highlight the emergence of a rich light-spin current coupling at ultrafast times in the TMDC family, as well presenting a route to the all-optical generation of pure spin currents.

Title: Localized Excitons and Landau-Level Mixing in Time-Reversal Symmetric Pairs of Chern Bands
Authors: Guopeng Xu, Nemin Wei, Inti Sodemann Villadiego, Chunli Huang
Abstract: We study Landau-level mixing in a time-reversal-symmetric Hamiltonian composed of two sets of Landau levels with opposite magnetic field, relevant to moiré minibands in twisted homobilayer transition-metal dichalcogenides in the adiabatic limit, where electrons in opposite valleys have flat Chern bands with opposite Chern numbers. Strong spin-orbit coupling polarizes spins in opposite directions in opposite valleys, separating Coulomb interactions into like-spin ($V^{\uparrow\uparrow}$) and opposite-spin ($V^{\uparrow\downarrow}$). Using degenerate perturbation theory, we compute Landau-level mixing corrections to $V^{\uparrow\uparrow}$ and $V^{\uparrow\downarrow}$ for different filling fractions. In the lowest Landau level, screening exhibits an even-odd effect: $V^{\uparrow\uparrow}$ is reduced more strongly than $V^{\uparrow\downarrow}$ in even-$m$ angular momentum Haldane pseudopotential and less strongly in odd-$m$ angular momentum ones. In the first Landau level, the short-range part ($m=0,1$) of $V^{\uparrow\downarrow}$ is reduced comparably to $V^{\uparrow\uparrow}$, while the strongest spin anisotropy appears in the $m=2$ pseudopotential. These novel short-range spin correlations have important implications for candidate correlated phases of fractional quantum spin Hall insulators. A distinctive feature of this time-reversal-symmetric Hamiltonian, absent in conventional quantum Hall systems, is that spin-flip excitations form localized quasiparticles. We compute their excitation spectrum and predict a non-monotonic dependence of the ordering temperature of Chern ferromagnetism in MoTe$_2$ on the Landau-level mixing parameter.

Title: Magnetic penetration depth in topological superconductors: Effect of Majorana surface states and application for UTe$_2$
Authors: Kazuki Akuzawa, Jushin Tei, Ryoi Ohashi, Satoshi Fujimoto, Takeshi Mizushima
Abstract: In this study, we examine how the orbital degrees of freedom of electrons and Majorana surface states influence the magnetic penetration depth in the superconductor UTe$_2$. We use a model involving two orbital electrons and consider superconducting states classified into irreducible representations of the $D_{2h}$ crystal symmetry: $A_{u}$, $B_{1u}$, $B_{2u}$, and $B_{3u}$. We first show that in bulk nodal superconductors, such as the $B_{2u}$ state, the magnetic penetration depth for the screening current along the antinodal direction exhibits a $T^2$ dependence, which significantly deviates from $T^4$ expected from conventional theory. This anomalous exponent is attributed to quasiparticle contributions around the point nodes to the inter-orbital paramagnetic current. We then explore the roles of surface states. The fully gapped $A_{u}$ state hosts Majorana surface states with cone-shaped dispersions, while Majorana Fermi arcs appear in the other pairing states. We demonstrate that when the ratio of magnetic penetration depth to coherence length ($\kappa$) is small, the Majorana cone in the $A_u$ state significantly contributes to the paramagnetic current, leading to the $T^3$ dependence of the penetration depth. In the other states hosting Majorana arcs, the penetration depth exhibits anisotropic power-law behavior, such as $T^2$ ($T^3$) for the screening current flowing along the dispersive (dispersionless) direction of Majorana arcs. Therefore, in low-$\kappa$ type-II superconductors, the signals of Majorana surface states may be detectable through penetration depth measurements. As $\kappa$ increases and approaches the type-II limit, however, the impact of Majorana surface states diminishes, and the temperature dependence is determined by bulk quasiparticle excitations instead of surface states.

Title: Influence of La-doping on the magnetic properties of the two-dimensional spin-gapped system SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$
Authors: Lia Šibav, Tilen Knaflič, Graham King, Zvonko Jagličić, Maja Koblar, Kirill Yu. Povarov, Sergei Zvyagin, Denis Arčon, Mirela Dragomir
Abstract: Aliovalent doping of the two-dimensional dimer antiferromagnet SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$ has long been proposed as a potential route toward realizing resonating valence bond (RVB) superconductivity in this system; however, experimental progress has remained limited. This study explores the effects of La doping on the ground state of SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$ and reports the first flux growth of Sr$_{1-x}$La$_x$Cu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$ single crystals with nominal doping levels up to $x$ = 0.15. Powder X-ray diffraction and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy confirm the successful incorporation of La on the Sr sites within the tetragonal $I\bar{4}2m$ structure, although the effective doping was limited to approximately 50% of the nominal concentration. La doping induces systematic changes in the magnetic properties, with a reduction of the effective spin gap $\Delta$ from ~28.2K to ~20.3 K at $x$ = 0.15, as determined from low-temperature magnetic susceptibility. X-band electron spin resonance measurements reveal the emergence of unpaired Cu$^{2+}$ spins in La-doped SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$ single crystals, which develop antiferromagnetic correlations below ~5.5 K. These findings corroborate the breaking of the local spin dimers induced by La doping. Despite this, no superconductivity is observed across the entire doping range studied. The present study demonstrates that at low doping levels, electron doping locally destabilizes the spin-singlet ground state in SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$, while the intrinsic spin dynamics of the dimer lattice remain largely preserved.

Title: Spin-Axis Dynamic Locking
Authors: Lv Zhiheng, Ma Dengpan, Cai Jiangtao, Xing Yan, Liu Zhifeng
Abstract: The all-electric realization of high spin polarization and efficient charge-to-spin remains a fundamental challenge in spintronics. We report a spin-axis dynamic locking (SADL) effect in altermagnets that enables fully spin-polarized axial currents: an inplane electric field along one axis drives a pure spin-up current, whereas along the orthogonal axis, it generates a pure spin-down current. Notably, a diagonal field produces a pure transverse spin current with 100% charge-to-spin conversion efficiency. This originates from extremely anisotropic sublattice hopping in a 2D altermagnetic lattice, forming a "tent state" with flat bands and orthogonal Fermi contours. Our firstprinciples calculations demonstrate SADL in a broad class of altermagnetic semiconductors (e.g., 2D Cr2WSe4 monolayer and synthesized 3D (BaF)2Mn2Se2O crystal). These materials provide ideal platforms for gate-tunable, all-electrical spintronics, enabling reconfigurable devices whose spin state is controlled solely by the orientation of an applied electric field.

Title: Zero-field Anomalous Hall Effect in Bulk Single Crystal Mn3Ir
Authors: Xin Gu, Ruoqi Wang, Bo Zhao, Haofu Wen, Kunquan Hong, Shijun Yuan, Taishi Chen, Jinlan Wang
Abstract: The L1_2-phase non-collinear antiferromagnet (AFM) Mn_3Ir has emerged as a pioneering platform for realizing the zero-field anomalous Hall effect (AHE), thereby catalyzing rapid advances in antiferromagnetic spintronics. Despite its significant potential, experimental investigations of the intrinsic magnetic and electronic properties of Mn_3Ir have been greatly hindered by the formidable challenges in growing bulk single crystals. Here, we report the growth of stoichiometric Mn_3Ir bulk single crystals and their characterization in terms of magnetization and the AHE. Using a high-throughput flux method, we obtained (111)-oriented hexagonal Mn_3Ir single crystals. A small AHE signal was detected, which we attribute to the coexistence of A- and B-type antiferromagnetic domains that mutually cancel the net AHE response. Our results reveal key aspects of the intrinsic magnetic properties and AHE in bulk Mn_3Ir, providing a critical material platform for the development of advanced spintronic devices.

Title: Active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particle under stochastic resetting
Authors: Uma Shankari, Mamata Sahoo
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of an inertial active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) particle in the presence of stochastic resetting. Using renewal approach, we compute the mean square displacement (MSD) and position probability distribution functions both in the overdamped and underdamped regimes. In contrast to the normal active OU particle, the MSD of an active OU particle with resetting displays an initial diffusive and long-time or steady-state non-diffusive behavior. The steady-state MSD gets suppressed with an increase in the resetting rate and approaches zero for an infinitely large resetting rate. Moreover, it has a nonmonotonic impact on the duration of activity. For an intermediate range of activity time, the steady-state MSD is enhanced, allowing the particle to explore a larger region, thereby increasing the probability of encountering a wide-spread target. Moreover, when the particle is suspended in a viscoelastic medium characterized by the presence of finite memory, the MSD interestingly develops an intermediate-time plateau and the plateau depends on the strength of the viscoelasticity and the viscoelastic relaxation time. With an increase in strength of the viscoelasticity, the width of the plateau increases and the MSD suppresses. In addition, slow viscoelastic relaxation makes memory effects weaker and hence the intermediate plateau disappears and steady state MSD gets enhanced, implying low strength and longer persistence of memory are beneficial for a wide spread target search. Similarly, for slow resetting, the intermediate plateau is more distinct, whereas fast resetting results in the system approaching steady state faster, overcoming the intermediate plateau in MSD. This emerging behavior might be due to the complex interplay between the resetting mechanism, activity, and memory effects. Finally, our analytical results are in good agreement with numerical simulation.

Title: Direct measurement of coherent nodal and antinodal dynamics in underdoped Bi-2212
Authors: Rishabh Mishra, Jonathan O. Tollerud, Paolo Franceschini, Nikolas Stavrias, Fabio Boschini, Genda Gu, Andrea Damascelli, Daniele Fausti, Jared H. Cole, Claudio Giannetti, Jeffrey A. Davis
Abstract: The physics of strongly correlated materials is deeply rooted in electron interactions and their coupling to low-energy excitations. Unraveling the competing and cooperative nature of these interactions is crucial for connecting microscopic mechanisms to the emergence of exotic macroscopic behavior, such as high-temperature superconductivity. Here we show that polarization-resolved multidimensional coherent spectroscopy (MDCS) is able to selectively drive and measure coherent Raman excitations in different parts of the Fermi surface, where the superconducting gap vanishes or is the largest (respectively called Nodal and Antinodal region) in underdoped Bi-2212. Our evidence reveal that in the superconducting phase, the energy of Raman excitations in the nodal region is anti-correlated with the energy of electronic excitations at $\sim$1.6~eV, and both maintain coherence for over 44~fs. In contrast, excitations in the antinodal region show significantly faster decoherence ($<$18~fs) and no measurable correlations. Importantly, this long-lived coherence is specific to the superconducting phase and vanishes in the pseudogap and normal phases. This anti-correlation reveals a coherent link between the transition energy associated with the many body Cu-O bands and the energy of electronic Raman modes that map to the near-nodal superconducting gap. The different coherent dynamics of the nodal and antinodal excitations in the superconducting phase suggest that nodal fluctuations are protected from dissipation associated with scattering from antiferromagnetic fluctuations and may be relevant to sustaining the quantum coherent behaviour associated with high temperature superconductivity.

Title: Strain-Tuned Optical Properties of a Two-Dimensional Hexagonal Lattice: Exploiting Saddle Degrees of Freedom and Saddle Filtering Effects
Authors: Phusit Nualpijit, Bumned Soodchomshom
Abstract: The deformation of hexagonal lattices has attracted considerable attention due to its promising applications in straintronics. This study employs the tight-binding model to investigate the anisotropic spectrum, where electronic transport can be manipulated by the degree of deformation. The longitudinal conductivities, light transmittance, and absorbance are analyzed, revealing enhancement along one direction and suppression along the other. The findings indicate that the direction and magnitude of strain can be determined by measuring transmittance and absorbance, showing significant deviations from the unstrained condition. Furthermore, a strong absorbance is observed due to the interband transition of electrons near the M-point saddles, linked to van Hove singularities for specific values of nearest and next-nearest hoping energy. The unexpected characteristics of saddle polarization-analogous to valley polarization at K- and K'-become particularly prominent when strain affects the selection of M-point saddle. Notably, the demonstration indicates that a highly efficient M-point saddle filtering effect takes place, induced by linearly polarized light. This model paves the way for exploring the optical properties of anisotropic hexagonal lattices, such as black phosphorus and borophene oxide. These results also open a pathway to strain-programmable optoelectronic devices, such as polarization-selective photodetectors, tunable absorbers, and ultrathin optical filters.

Title: Optical properties of RCd3P3 (R: Ce or La) compounds: Insulator-metal transition induced by displacement of atoms in the unit cell
Authors: Jaekyung Jang, Yu-Seong Seo, Jeonghun Lee, Eundeok Mun, Jungseek Hwang
Abstract: We examined the electronic structures and optical properties of single crystals of RCd3P3 (R = Ce or La). Our first-principles analysis indicates that CeCd3P3 and LaCd3P3 exhibit semiconductor characteristics with narrow energy gaps of approximately 0.51 and 0.70 eV, respectively. Notably, a slight displacement of the Cd and P atoms within the unit cell significantly transforms the electronic structure from insulating to metallic state. Optical spectroscopy of both compounds reveals a metallic state with a low charge carrier density, suggesting a finite density of states at the Fermi level. A comparison between the theoretical electronic structures and experimental optical properties elucidates the observed metallic behavior. Additionally, the notable modification of the infrared-active phonons strongly indicates a structural phase transition in these compounds. Our findings also suggest that CeCd3P3 serves as a suitable platform for investigating the photoinduced Kondo effect due to its metallic ground state with limited charge carriers.

Title: Optical properties of popular dielectric substrate materials in a wide spectral range from far-infrared to ultraviolet
Authors: Minjae Kim, Hong Gu Lee, Jungseek Hwang
Abstract: We investigated the optical properties of 13 different dielectric materials (slide glass, quartz, Al2O3 (c-cut), DyScO3 (110), KTaO3 (001), LaAlO3 (001), (LaAlO3)0.3-(Sr2AlTaO6)0.7 (001) (LSAT), MgF2 (100), MgO (100), SiC, SrTiO3 (001), TbScO3 (110), and TiO2). The single-bounce reflectance spectra of the bulk samples were measured using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and monochromatic spectrometers across a wide spectral range, from far infrared to ultraviolet (80-50,000 cm-1). Using the Kramers-Kronig analysis, we obtained the optical conductivity and dielectric function of the dielectric materials from their measured reflectance spectra. Moreover, we measured the transmittance spectra of the materials to obtain their bandgaps. We fitted the measured reflectance spectra using the Lorentz model to obtain phononic structures. Each dielectric material exhibits unique phononic structures and optical bandgaps, associated with the composition and crystal structure of the material. The observed optical properties of these dielectric materials provide valuable information for the optical analysis of thin films grown on them.

Title: Exceptional-point-induced dynamic sensitivity to particle-number parity
Authors: J. Y. Liu-Sun, Z. Song
Abstract: As an exclusive feature of a non-Hermitian system, the existence of exceptional points (EPs) depends not only on the details of the Hamiltonian but also on the particle-number filling and the particle statistics. In this paper, we study many-particle EPs in a Bose Hubbard chain with two end-site resonant imaginary potentials. Starting from a single-particle coalescing eigenstate, we construct $n$-particle condensate eigenstates for the cases with zero and infinite $U$. Compared with the free bosonic case, where the $ n $-particle condensate eigenstate is an $(n+1)$-th-order coalescing state, the hardcore-boson counterpart is a second-order coalescing state for odd $n$ , while it is not for even $n$. The difference in particle-number parity results in distinct quenching dynamics of the condensate states, highlighting the role of parity in system behavior. Our finding may stimulate research on the dynamic sensitivity to particle-number parity.

Title: A scaling law for large-deformation contact in soft materials
Authors: Tong Mu, Shizhuo Weng, Changhong Linghu, Ruozhang Li, Jingyi Yu, Zhonghao Xu, Yingjie Fu, Lin Yang, Domenico Campolo, Yanju Liu, Jinsong Leng, K. Jimmy Hsia, Huajian Gao
Abstract: Compression of soft bodies is central to biology, materials science, and robotics, yet existing contact theories break down at large deformations. Here, we develop a general framework for soft-body compression by extending the method of dimensionality reduction into the nonlinear regime. Analytical solutions for contact force and radius are derived and validated against finite element simulations and experiments on canonical geometries (cone, hemisphere, cylinder), achieving high accuracy up to 50% compression. From this framework emerges a universal scaling law that unifies the nonlinear force-displacement response across diverse shapes and even irregular soft objects such as gummy candies. Leveraging this principle, we design a vision-based tactile sensor that reconstructs real-time pressure maps and enables delicate robotic manipulation of fragile items. By bridging nonlinear contact mechanics with practical sensing, this work both advances fundamental understanding of large-strain mechanics and opens a route to robust tactile technologies for soft robotics and biomedical applications.

Title: Large Anomalous and Topological Hall Effect and Nernst Effect in a Dirac Kagome Magnet Fe3Ge
Authors: Chunqiang Xu, Shuvankar Gupta, Hengxin Tan, Hyeonhu Bae, Olajumoke Oluwatobiloba Emmanuel, Mingyu Xu, Yan Wu, Xiaofeng Xu, Pengpeng Zhang, Weiwei Xie, Binghai Yan, Xianglin Ke
Abstract: The search for kagome magnets with unconventional magnetic and electronic properties has gained significant attention in recent years. We report the magnetic, electronic, and thermoelectric properties of Fe3Ge single crystals, where the Fe atoms form a slightly distorted kagome lattice. Fe3Ge exhibits a large anomalous Hall effect and anomalous Nernst effect. The anomalous transverse thermoelectric conductivity reaches about 4.6 A m^-1 K^-1, exceeding values reported for conventional ferromagnets and most topological ferromagnets. First-principles calculations indicate that these transport responses are primarily governed by intrinsic mechanisms, highlighting the dominant role of Berry curvature arising from massive Dirac gaps in momentum space. In addition, we observe a topological Hall resistivity of about 0.9 microOhm cm and a topological Nernst coefficient of 1.2 microvolt K^-1, which are attributed to the Berry phase associated with field-induced scalar spin chirality. These findings demonstrate the combined influence of Berry phases in both momentum and real space, establishing Fe3Ge as a promising candidate for room-temperature transverse thermoelectric applications.

Title: A closed-loop AI framework for hypothesis-driven and interpretable materials design
Authors: Kangyu Ji, Tianran Liu, Fang Sheng, Shaun Tan, Moungi Bawendi, Tonio Buonassisi
Abstract: Scientific hypothesis generation is central to materials discovery, yet current approaches often emphasize either conceptual (idea-to-data) reasoning or data-driven (data-to-idea) analysis, rarely achieving an effective integration of both. Here, we present a generalizable active learning workflow that integrates top-down, theory-driven hypothesis generation, guided by a large language model. This is complemented by bottom-up, data-driven hypothesis testing through a root-cause association study. We demonstrate this approach through the design of equimolar quinary-cation two-dimensional perovskite, a chemically complex system with over 850,000 possible cation combinations. In the top-down component, the large language model drives closed-loop optimization by proposing candidates that are likely to achieve phase purity, leveraging domain knowledge and chain-of-thought reasoning. With each iteration, the model identifies an increasing number of near phase-pure compositions, sampling less than 0.004% of the design space. In parallel, the bottom-up association study identifies molecular features with statistically significant influences on phase purity. The integration of these approaches enables the convergence of conceptual and statistical hypotheses, leading to generalizable and rational design rules for phase-pure quinary-cation two-dimensional perovskites. As a proof of concept, we applied the optimized phase-pure quinary-cation two-dimensional perovskite film as a surface capping layer in perovskite solar cells, achieving good performance and stability. Our framework enables the development of interpretable and generalizable design rules that are applicable to a wide range of optimization processes within complex design spaces, providing a foundational strategy for rational, scalable, and efficient materials discovery.

Title: Octahedral dynamics and local symmetry in hybrid perovskite FAPbI3 under thermal excitation
Authors: H. Joshi, K. C. Bhamu, A. Shankar, Rana Biswas, M. Wlazło
Abstract: Density Functional Theory (DFT) and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations have been employed to investigate the evolution of local motifs within the tetragonal phase of FAPbI3 under thermal excitation. Our results reveal a distinct broadening in the distribution of PbI6 octahedral volumes with increasing temperature, indicating a gradual breakdown of symmetry and emergence of diverse local environments. These octahedral volume distortions are primarily driven by the dynamic behaviour of the FA cation leading to softening of PbI6 octahedra, evident from calculated mean octahedral volume and Pb-I-Pb bond angles. The examination of electronic structure confirmed that this dynamic structural phenomenon is directly responsible for the change in fundamental band gap value, highlighting the role of PbI6 octahedra in modifying and modulating the electronic properties in FAPbI3. The results demonstrate the microscopic origin of thermally induced dynamical behaviour to the macroscopic electronic properties and underscore the pivotal role of local motifs in hybrid perovskites.

Title: Quaternary crystals CdZnTeSe: Growth via the vertical Bridgman method with different compositions of raw materials
Authors: S.V. Naydenov, O.K. Kapustnyk, I.M. Pritula, D.S. Sofronov, I.S. Terzin, N.O. Kovalenko
Abstract: Indium-doped semiconductor crystals CdZnTeSe with several different compositions of raw materials were grown via the vertical Bridgman method under high-pressure argon. For the first time, these crystals were obtained via a combined method from a mixture of simple and binary starting components. A theoretical analysis of the permissible reactions for obtaining multicomponent CdZnTeSe crystals from different compositions of starting materials was performed. The homogeneity of the distribution of the atomic composition and electrical resistance (in the dark and under illumination) of the obtained crystals was studied. Crystals grown via the new combined method presented the best homogeneity of composition and electrophysical properties.

Title: Beyond Bloch: A Theoretical Blueprint for Conjugated Polymer Optoelectronics
Authors: Miguel Lagos, Miguel Kiwi, Rodrigo Paredes
Abstract: Conjugated polymers are experiencing a surge of renewed interest due to their promising applications in various organic electronic devices. These include organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), field-effect transistors (FETs), and organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices, among many others. Their appeal stems from distinct advantages they hold over traditional inorganic semiconductors. Unlike inorganic semiconductors, where electrons are often considered to be in delocalized, free, or quasi-free states (as described by Bloch's theory), electrons in conjugated polymers behave differently. They are strongly coupled within highly localized $\sigma$ or $\pi$-orbitals and interact significantly with the ionic cores. This means they are far from the idealized delocalized states presumed by Bloch's theory approaches. Consequently, after nearly a century of applying Bloch's theory to the electronic transport properties of inorganic materials, there is a clear need for a new theoretical framework to explain efficient charge transport in these organic solids. Our presented model addresses this need by incorporating crucial electron-electron interactions. Specifically, it accounts for both intra-site interactions and interactions between the $\pi$-states located at alternating sites along the polymer chain. This framework provides a many-body charge conduction mechanism and explains the semiconducting properties of the undoped material. A significant outcome of our model is the prediction of two novel flat bands of excited bonding states. Intriguingly, these states obey Bose--Einstein statistics and facilitate charge transport. Furthermore, our model accurately reproduces experimental data, providing an excellent fit for measured UV-Vis absorption and electroluminescent spectra.

Title: A basis-free, octonionic criterion for Weyl points in solids
Authors: Christian Tantardini
Abstract: Conventional diagnostics of Weyl points -- Berry flux on small spheres and $k \cdot p$ linearization -- are topologically sound but depend on user choices (sphere center and radius, gauge smoothing, charting, and local frame transport) that introduce algorithmic arbitrariness in first-principles workflows. We propose a \emph{local, basis-free} criterion built from the octonionic structure on $\mathbb{R}^7$. From a smooth two-band projector we construct a unit octonion field and its octonionic connection; contracting three directional derivatives with the $\mathrm{G}_2$--invariant three-form yields a pseudoscalar density whose sign equals the Weyl chirality. A vanishing octonionic associator at leading order certifies that the local problem closes inside an associative (quaternionic) three-plane, while a nonzero density identifies a Weyl point. The construction is invariant under $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ gauge changes of the two-band subspace and under $\mathrm{G}_2$ rotations of its completion, and it eliminates enclosing surfaces and gauge-seam choices. In the linear regime we prove equivalence with the conventional diagnostics (Chern charge on a small sphere and $\mathrm{sgn}\det v$). We outline a practical algorithm compatible with Wannier tight-binding Hamiltonians and provide self-consistency checks based on stencil refinement and the associator norm. The \emph{octonionic Weyl point criterion} streamlines chirality assignment in high-throughput searches and offers an intrinsic warning signal in the presence of band entanglement or proximity to multi-fold touchings.

Title: Spin defects in hexagonal boron nitride as two-dimensional strain sensors
Authors: Z. Mu, Z. Zhang, J. Fraunié, C. Robert, G. Seine, B. Gil, G. Cassabois, V. Jacques
Abstract: Lattice deformation is a powerful way to engineer the properties of two-dimensional (2D) materials, making their precise measurement an important challenge for both fundamental science and technological applications. Here, we demonstrate that boron-vacancy (V$_\text{B}^-$) color centers in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) enable quantitative strain sensing with sub-micrometer spatial resolution. Using this approach, we precisely quantify the strain-induced shift of the E$_{\rm 2g}$ Raman mode in a hBN flake under uniaxial stress, establishing V$_\text{B}^-$ centers as a new tool for strain metrology in van der Waals heterostructures. Beyond strain sensing, our work also highlights the unique multimodal sensing functionalities offered by V$_\text{B}^-$ centers, which will be valuable for future studies of strain-engineered 2D materials.

Title: Chemically Active Liquid Bridges Generate Repulsive Forces
Authors: Noah Ziethen, Frieder Johannsen, David Zwicker
Abstract: Droplets help organize cells by compartmentalizing biomolecules and by mediating mechanical interactions. When bridging two structures, such droplets generate capillary forces, which depend on surface properties and distance. While the forces exerted by passive liquid bridges are well understood, the role of active chemical reactions, which are often present in biological droplets, remains unclear. To elucidate this case, we study a single liquid bridge with continuous chemical turnover. These reactions control the bridge radius and lead to purely repulsive forces-contrasting with the typically attractive forces in passive systems. Our results reveal how chemical activity can fundamentally alter forces generated by liquid bridges, which could be exploited by cells.

Title: Signature of chiral superconducting order parameter evidenced in mesoscopic superconductors
Authors: Xiaoying Xu, Wei Qin, Yuelin Shen, Zixuan Huang, Zhuoya Zhou, Zirao Wang, Yufan Li
Abstract: Chiral superconductivity is a novel superconducting phase characterized by order parameters that break the time-reversal symmetry, endowing the state with a definite handedness. Unlike conventional superconductors, the Cooper pairs in a chiral superconductor carry nonzero orbital angular momentum. Through coupling with an external magnetic field, the finite angular momentum of the Cooper pair modulates the temperature-magnetic field phase boundary in a distinctive way, which could serve as an experimental signature of the chiral superconducting state. Here we demonstrate that the chiral signature can be detected in mesoscopic superconducting rings of $\beta$-Bi$_2$Pd, manifesting as a linear-in-field modulation of the critical temperature in the Little-Parks effect. Our findings establish a new experimental method for detecting the chiral superconductivity.

Title: Asymmetrical Defect Sink Behaviour of HCP/BCC Zr/Nb Multilayer Interfaces: Bubble-Denuded Zones at Nb Layers

Abstract: Radiation induced helium bubble formation poses a major challenge to the structural integrity of materials in nuclear energy systems. In this study, we investigate defect evolution and He behavior in ZrNb nanoscale metallic multilayers with immiscible BCC and HCP interfaces, irradiated with 80 keV He ions. For comparison, single crystal Nb and polycrystalline Zr were also irradiated under identical conditions to serve as reference materials. Using cross sectional TEM, SIMS, STEM EELS, nanoindentation, Doppler Broadening Positron Annihilation Spectroscopy, Positron Annihilation Lifetime Spectroscopy, and atomistic simulations, we reveal a highly asymmetric damage response across the multilayer interfaces. Zr layers exhibit larger He bubbles, higher swelling, and greater helium retention while Nb layers develop bubble-denuded zones exclusively around the interfaces, where bubble nucleation is strongly suppressed and swelling is limited. This asymmetry arises from differences in atomic transport properties DFT calculations show lower migration barriers for vacancies and He atoms in Nb, enabling efficient defect migration and recombination at interfaces, whereas Zr retains defects due to higher migration barriers. EELS and DBS PALS measurements confirm bubble densities and the presence of sub-nanometer open volumes. Compared to monolithic samples, the ZrNb multilayers exhibit lower irradiation induced hardening and reduced He retention. These findings highlight the role of interfaces in driving asymmetric radiation damage and demonstrate the effectiveness of BCC Nb layers in mitigating defect growth. Overall, ZrNb multilayers are established as a superior alternative to conventional single and polycrystalline materials for extreme irradiation environments.

Title: Complex Frequency Fingerprint: Interacting Driven Non-Hermitian Skin Effect
Authors: Zhesen Yang, Zihan Wang, Juntao Huang, Zijian Zheng, Jiangping Hu
Abstract: The excitation properties of quantum many-body systems are encoded in their response functions. These functions define an associated response Hamiltonian, which is intrinsically non-Hermitian due to the dissipative nature of retarded responses, even in closed systems. By analyzing its eigenvalues and eigenstates, one obtains a unique characterization of the system, referred to as the complex frequency fingerprint. Using this framework, we demonstrate that interactions alone can give rise to both point-gap topology and the non-Hermitian skin effect. Unlike the dissipation-induced skin effect, this interaction-driven phenomenon exhibits pronounced frequency dependence. We further introduce a complex-frequency density of states framework that distinctly separates non-Hermitian skin modes from topological edge modes.

Title: Quantum-to-classical transition and H-theorem in surface diffusion
Authors: E. E. Torres-Miyares, S. Miret-Artés
Abstract: In this work, surface diffusion is studied with a different perspective by showing how the corresponding open dynamics is transformed when passing, in a continuous and smooth way, from a pure quantum regime to a full classical regime; the so-called quantum-to-classical transition. This continuous process is carried out from the Liouville-von Neumann equation by scaling Planck's constant. For this goal, the Brownian motion of an adsorbate on a flat surface is analyzed in order to show how this transition takes place. In particular, this open dynamics is studied from the master equation for the reduced density matrix within the Caldeira-Leggett formalism; in particular, the two extreme time behaviors, the ballistic and diffusive motions. It is also shown that the origin of the ballistic motion is different for the quantum and classical regimes. In this scenario, the corresponding Gaussian function for the intermediate scattering function is governed by the thermal velocity in the classical regime versus the initial spreading velocity of the wave packet for the quantum regime, leading to speak of classical and quantum ideal gas, respectively. Finally, in the diffusive regime, and starting from the Chudley-Elliott model, the quantum-to-classical transition is also discussed in terms of the well-known H-function for three surface temperatures in the diffusion of H and D on a Pt(111) surface. The main goal in this analysis is if one can discriminate the irreversibility coming from tunneling and thermal activation diffusion.

Title: Interacting-cluster spin liquids with robust flat bands evolving into higher-rank half-moon phases and topological Lifshitz transitions
Authors: Naïmo Davier, Ludovic D.C. Jaubert
Abstract: Classical spin liquids are disordered magnetic phases, governed by local constraints that often give rise to flat-band ground states. When constraints take the form of a zero-divergence field within a cluster of spins, the spin liquid is often described by an emergent Coulomb gauge theory. Here we introduce an interaction $\eta$ between these clusters of spins which compete with the zero-divergence field. Using a framework embracing both the connectivity matrices of graph theory and the topology of band structures, we develop a generic theory of interacting-cluster Hamiltonians. We show how flat bands remain at zero energy up to finite interaction $\eta$, until a dispersive band becomes negative, stabilizing a spiral spin liquid with a hypersurface of ground-state manifold in reciprocal space. This hypersurface serves as a mold for the apparition of the half-moon patterns in the equal-time structure factor. Our generic approach enables to extend the notion of half moons to the perturbation of higher-rank Coulomb fields and pinch-line spin liquids. In particular, multi-fold half moons appear when unconventional gauge charges, such as potential fractons, are stabilized in the ground state. Finally, half-moon phases can be tuned across the equivalent of a Lifshitz transition, when the hypersurface manifold changes topology.

Title: Sub-nanosecond heat-based logic, writing and reset in an antiferromagnetic magnetoresistive memory
Authors: M. Surynek, A. Farkas, J. Zubac, P. Kubascik, K. Olejnik, F. Krizek, L. Nadvornik, T. Ostatnicky, R.P. Campion, V. Novak, T. Jungwirth, P. Nemec
Abstract: Thermal logic aims to create thermal counterparts to electronic circuits. In this work, we investigate experimentally the response of an analog memory device based on a thin film of an antiferromagnetic metal CuMnAs to bursts of heat pulses generated by the absorption of femtosecond laser pulses at room ambient temperature. When a threshold temperature in the heat-based short-term memory of the device is exceeded, the output of the in-memory logic operations is transferred within the same device to a long-term memory, where it can be retrieved at macroscopic times. The long-term memory is based on magnetoresistive switching from a reference low-resistive uniform magnetic state to high-resistive metastable nanofragmented magnetic states. The in-memory heat-based logic operations and the conversion of the outputs into the electrically-readable long-term magnetoresistive memory were performed at sub-nanosecond time scales, making them compatible with the GHz frequencies of standard electronics. Finally, we demonstrate the possibility of rapidly resetting the long-term memory to the reference low-resistive state by heat pulses.

Title: Giant optical anisotropy in CrSBr from giant exciton oscillator strength

Abstract: The interplay between dimensionality and electronic correlations in van der Waals (vdW) materials offers a powerful toolkit for engineering light-matter interactions at the nanoscale. Excitons, bound electron-hole pairs, are central to this endeavor, yet maximizing their oscillator strength, which dictates the interaction cross-section, remains a challenge. Conventional wisdom suggests a trade-off, where the observable oscillator strength often decreases in strongly bound systems due to population dynamics. Here, we unveil a colossal oscillator strength associated with the quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) excitons in the layered magnetic semiconductor CrSBr, which fundamentally defies this established scaling law. Through comprehensive optical characterization and ab initio calculations, we establish that this anomalous enhancement originates directly from the reduced dimensionality, which enforces an increased electron-hole wavefunction overlap. Moreover, we find a close connection between fundamental exciton and local spin fluctuations that contribute to the opening of the gap in the electronic spectrum. The resulting optical anisotropy shows a giant in-plane birefringence (Delta_n = 1.45) and profoundly anisotropic waveguiding, which we directly visualize using nano-optical imaging. Leveraging this extreme response, we realize a true zero-order quarter-wave plate with an unprecedented wavelength-to-thickness ratio (lambda/t) exceeding 3.4, surpassing the limits of current miniaturization technologies, including state-of-the-art metasurfaces. Our findings underscore the profound impact of dimensionality engineering in magnetic vdW materials for realizing novel regimes of light-matter coupling and developing next-generation ultracompact photonic architectures.

Title: Spectroscopic Evidence for Electron-Boson Coupling in Half-metallic CrO2

Abstract: We report the electronic structure of the half-metal ferromagnet CrO2 by means of high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). The observed clear Fermi surface (FS) and band dispersion are in good agreement with the previous reports. Moreover, the ARPES band dispersion reveals a distinct kink structure around 68 meV, providing the first evidence from the electronic structure for the elementary excitations in CrO2. The energy scale of this feature is comparable to the Debye temperature and the A1g phonon mode, suggesting the electron-phonon interaction. From the detailed analysis, we have extracted the self-energy and found two characteristic structures in the real part of the self-energy. Assuming the existence of the electron-magnon interaction as well as the electron-phonon interaction, we have simulated the line shape for the real and imaginary parts of the self-energy and reproduced the ARPES intensity. Our spectral findings demonstrate the renormalized quasiparticle (QP) dynamics in CrO2 and provide valuable insights into the fundamental many-body interactions governing half-metallic ferromagnets.

Title: Chemistry and physics of layered oxychalcogenides containing an anti-cuprate type square lattice
Authors: Nicola Kelly
Abstract: There has been significant recent interest in layered solid-state materials containing an [M2O] square lattice layer (M = transition metal), particularly because [M2O] is the anti-type of the [CuO2] planes in the layered cuprate superconductors. In addition to the superconducting titanium oxypnictides, the [M2O] anti-cuprate layer also occurs in a wide range of layered oxychalcogenide compounds with M spanning early (Ti, V) to later transition metals (Mn, Co, Fe). The chalcogenide in question - which sandwiches the anti-cuprate layer - may be S, Se or Te, and in combination with a wide range of intervening "spacer" layers, many different structural families have been investigated. This review surveys the structures and physical properties of all these oxychalcogenide materials and relates these properties to their common anti-cuprate square lattice [M2O] layer. It is organised around the different oxidation states of the metal ion M, in order to explore the effects of the electronic configuration of M on the physical properties of each compound as a whole. A key part of the review highlights the use of soft-chemical modifications to alter physical properties of these materials, in the synthesis of novel van der Waals materials and other metastable compounds. Future avenues for these materials in the bulk, few- and single-layer limits are discussed.

Title: Nanoscale Strain Evolution and Grain Boundary-Mediated Defect Sink Behavior in Irradiated SiC: Insights from N-PED and DFT
Authors: Nabil Daghbouj, Ahmed.T. AlMotasem, Jan. Duchoňb, Bingsheng. Li, Mohamed. Bensalem, Frans. Munnik, Xin Ou, Anna. Macková, William.J. Weber, Tomas. Polcara
Abstract: Understanding irradiation-induced strain in silicon carbide (SiC) is essential for designing radiation-tolerant ceramic materials. However, conventional methods often fail to resolve nanoscale strain gradients, especially in polycrystalline forms. In this study, we employ nano-beam precession electron diffraction (N-PED) to perform high-resolution, multi-directional strain mapping in both single-crystal 4H-SiC and polycrystalline {\alpha}-SiC subjected to helium and hydrogen ion irradiation. The high-resolution X-ray diffraction (HR-XRD) simulations of He + H irradiated single-crystal 4H-SiC closely match the strain profiles obtained from N-PED, demonstrating the reliability and accuracy of the N-PED method. In He-irradiated polycrystalline {\alpha}-SiC at high temperatures, a bubble-depleted zone (BDZ) near the grain boundary (GB) reveals that GBs act as active sinks for irradiation-induced defects. N-PED further shows strain amplification localized at the GBs, reaching up to 2.5%, along with strain relief within the BDZ. To explain this behavior, density functional theory (DFT) calculations of binding and migration energies indicate a strong tendency for Si, C, and He atoms to segregate toward the GB core. This segregation reduces the availability of vacancies to accommodate He atoms and leads to local strain relaxation near the GB. Furthermore, first-principles tensile simulations reveal that Si and C interstitials mitigate He-induced GB embrittlement. Charge density and DOS analyses link this effect to the bonding characteristics between point defects and neighboring atoms at GB. These insights underscore the importance of grain boundary engineering in enhancing radiation tolerance of SiC for nuclear and space applications.

Title: Ultrasound response to time-reversal symmetry breaking below the superconducting phase transition
Authors: Chris Halcrow, Paul Leask, Egor Babaev
Abstract: Ultrasound attenuation is a powerful probe of symmetry-breaking phenomena in superconductors. In this work, we develop a framework to model the ultrasound response of multi-component superconductors undergoing a time-reversal symmetry breaking transition below the superconducting phase transition. By coupling the elastic strain of the crystal lattice to the superconducting order parameters through group-theoretical analysis of tetragonal crystals, we classify how different symmetry channels contribute to the ultrasound signal. Using a two-component Ginzburg--Landau theory, we analyze the temperature dependence of sound velocity across both superconducting and time-reversal symmetry breaking transitions for several cases, including $(A_{1g}, A_{1g})$, $(A_{2g}, B_{1g})$, and $E_g$ representations. Our results demonstrate that ultrasound measurements are highly sensitive to the presence of bilinear Josephson couplings and can distinguish between different realizations of the superconducting state. We further show how external strain can significantly alter the ultrasound response in systems breaking time reversal symmetry.

Title: Magnetic Ordering in Moiré Graphene Multilayers from a Continuum Hartree+U Approach
Authors: Christopher T. S. Cheung, Valerio Vitale, Lennart Klebl, Ammon Fischer, Dante M. Kennes, Arash A. Mostofi, Johannes Lischner, Zachary A. H. Goodwin
Abstract: Recently, symmetry-broken ground states, such as correlated insulating states, magnetic order and superconductivity, have been discovered in twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG) and twisted trilayer graphene (tTLG) near the so-called magic-angle. Understanding the magnetic order in these systems is challenging, as atomistic methods become extremely expensive near the magic angle and continuum approaches fail to capture important atomistic details. In this work, we develop a self-consistent approach based on a continuum model that incorporates both short-ranged Hubbard interactions and long-ranged Coulomb interactions, therefore allowing efficient exploration of magnetic order in moiré graphene multilayers. With this approach, we perform a systematic analysis of the magnetic phase diagram of tBLG as a function of doping level and twist angle, near the magic angle. We find that the results are consistent with previous perturbative atomistic Hartree+U calculations. Furthermore, we predict stable magnetic orders for the tTLG. We found that the magnetic orders are similar to those in tBLG for small values of on-site repulsion. In the future, the developed method can be utilized to investigate magnetic ordering tendencies from short-range exchange interactions in other moiré graphene multilayers as a function of doping, twist angle, screening environment, among other variables.

Abstract: Disorder in frustrated quantum systems can critically influence their magnetic ground states and drive exotic correlated behavior. In the $S = \frac{1}{2}$ system ktenasite, Cu$_\text{2.7}$Zn$_\text{2.3}$(SO$_\text{4}$)$_\text{2}$(OH)$_\text{6}\cdot$6H$_\text{2}$O, we show that structural disorder drives an unexpected dimensional crossover and stabilizes a rare coexistence of distinct magnetic states. Neutron diffraction reveals significant Cu/Zn mixing at the Cu2 site, which tunes the Cu$^{2+}$ sublattice from a two-dimensional scalene-distorted triangular lattice into a one-dimensional spin-chain network. Magnetic susceptibility, neutron diffraction, ac susceptibility, and specific heat measurements collectively indicate magnetic duality: a coexistence of incommensurate long-range magnetic order below $T_\text{N} = 4\,$K and a cluster spin-glass state with $T_\text{f} = 3.28\,$K at $\nu = 10\,$Hz. Our findings highlight ktenasite as a rare platform where structural disorder tunes the effective dimensionality and stabilizes coexisting ordered and glassy magnetic phases, offering a unique opportunity to explore the interplay of frustration, disorder, and dimensional crossover in quantum magnets.

Title: Size-dependent critical localization
Authors: Hui-Qiang Liang, Linhu Li, Guo-Fu Xu
Abstract: Studying critical states in quasiperiodic systems is of great importance in localization physics. Previously identified critical states share a common characteristic: they exhibit persistent critical features in the thermodynamic limit. In this Letter, we predict an exotic type of critical state, termed size-dependent critical states, which exhibit a fundamentally distinct behavior. Specifically, they display critical localization signatures only at finite sizes, but transition to Anderson localization in the thermodynamic limit. We establish that the physical origin of size-dependent critical states lies in the synergistic interplay between local non-reciprocal domain wall and NHSE. By revealing a critical phase that challenges the established paradigm of critical localization, our work opens new avenues for exploring localization phenomena in quasiperiodic systems.

Title: A Methodological Study on Data Representation for Machine Learning Modelling of Thermal Conductivity of Rare-Earth Oxides
Authors: Amiya Chowdhury, Acacio Rincón Romero, Eduardo Aguilar-Bejarano, Halar Memon, Grazziela Figueredo, Tanvir Hussain
Abstract: Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modelling is widely employed in materials sci- ence to predict properties of interest and extract useful descriptors for measured properties. In thermal barrier coatings (TBC), QSAR can significantly shorten the experimental discovery cycle, which can take years. Although machine learning methods are commonly employed for QSAR, their performance depends on the data quality and how instances are represented. Traditional, hand-crafted descriptors based on known material properties are limited to represent materials that share the same basic crystal structure, limited the size of the dataset. By contrast, graph neural networks offer a more expressive representation, encoding atomic positions and bonds in the crystal lattice. In this study, we compare Random Forest (RF) and Gaussian Process (GP) models trained on hand-crafted descriptors from the literature with graph-based representations for high-entropy, rare-earth pyrochlore oxides using the Crystal Graph Convolutional Neural Network (CGCNN). Two different types of augmentation methods are also explored to account for the limited data size, one of which is only applicable to graph-based representations. Our findings show that the CGCNN model substantially outperforms the RF and GP models, underscoring the potential of graph-based representations for enhanced QSAR modelling in TBC research.

Title: Intrinsic-perturbation induced anomalous higher-order boundary states in non-Hermitian systems
Authors: Hui-Qiang Liang, Zuxuan Ou, Linhu Li, Guo-Fu Xu
Abstract: The behavior of higher-order boundary states in non-Hermitian systems is elusive and thereby finding the mechanism behind these states is both essential and significant. Here, we uncover a novel mechanism that induces anomalous higher-order boundary states. The mechanism originates from the sensitivity of the non-normal boundary Hamiltonian to intrinsic perturbations, where intrinsic perturbations here refer to the influence of the bulk on the topological boundaries. Based on the mechanism, we reveal a new kind of phase transition, i.e., the transition between hybrid skin-topological states and scale-free topological boundary states. We also find that scale-free topological boundary states exhibit size-dependent spectra, influencing the existence of higher-order topological boundary states. Unlike conventional hybrid skin-topological states or higher-order non-Hermitian skin effect, the above two kinds of anomalous higher-order boundary states exhibit size-dependent characteristics. Our work opens a new horizon for the control of higher-order boundary states and topological properties of non-Hermitian systems.

Title: BatchTNMC: Efficient sampling of two-dimensional spin glasses using tensor network Monte Carlo
Authors: Tao Chen, Jingtong Zhang, Jing Liu, Youjin Deng, Pan Zhang
Abstract: Efficient sampling of two-dimensional statistical physics systems remains a central challenge in computational statistical physics. Traditional Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, including cluster algorithms, provide only partial solutions, as their efficiency collapses for large systems in the presence of frustration and quenched disorder. The recently proposed Tensor Network Monte Carlo (TNMC) method offers a promising alternative, yet its original implementation suffers from inefficiencies due to the lack of scalable parallel sampling. In this work, we introduce BatchTNMC, a GPU-optimized and parallelized implementation of TNMC tailored for large-scale simulations of two-dimensional spin glasses. By leveraging batch processing and parallel sampling across multiple disorder realizations, our implementation achieves speedups of up to five orders of magnitude compared with the original serial scheme. Benchmarking on two-dimensional spin glasses demonstrates dramatic gains in efficiency: for instance, on a single GPU, BatchTNMC concurrently produces 1000 uncorrelated and unbiased samples across 1000 disorder realizations on $1024\times 1024$ lattices in just 3.3 hours, with an acceptance probability of 37%. These results establish BatchTNMC as a scalable and powerful computational framework for the study of two-dimensional disordered spin glass systems.

Title: Contraction waves in pulsating active liquids: From pacemaker to aster dynamics
Authors: Tirthankar Banerjee, Thibault Desaleux, Jonas Ranft, Étienne Fodor
Abstract: We propose a hydrodynamic theory to examine the emergence of contraction waves in dense active liquids composed of pulsating deformable particles. Our theory couples the liquid density with a chemical phase that determines the periodic deformation of the particles. This mechanochemical coupling regulates the interplay between the flow induced by local deformation, and the resistance to pulsation stemming from steric interaction. We show that this interplay leads the emergent contraction waves to spontaneously organize into a packing of pacemakers. We reveal that the dynamics of these pacemakers is governed by a complex feedback between slow and fast topological defects that form asters in velocity flows. In fact, our defect analysis is a versatile platform for investigating the self-organization of waves in a wide range of contractile systems. Our results shed light on the key mechanisms that control the rich phenomenology of pulsating liquids, with relevance for biological systems such as tissues made of confluent pulsating cells.

Title: Angular momentum of vortex-core Majorana zero modes
Authors: Giulia Venditti, Christophe Berthod, Louk Rademaker
Abstract: Majorana zero modes (MZMs) are highly sought-after states with a possible application in quantum computation. Here, we show that vortex-core MZMs can carry a nontrivial angular momentum. This establishes new `flavors' of Majorana modes, independent of the Chern classification of topological superconductors. The MZM angular momentum is explicitly calculated for a microscopic model of a $d+id$ superconductor placed on a three-dimensional topological insulator ($d+id+\phantom{}$Dirac model) using both exact diagonalization and the Chebyshev expansion. We classify all possible quantum numbers of MZMs depending on the windings of the order parameter and underlying normal state. The topological protection of the MZM is set by the bulk gap, quasiparticle poisoning by trivial in-gap states, and its localization length. All these severely limit the stability of MZMs in the $d+id+\phantom{}$Dirac model, in contrast to earlier claims. Nevertheless, the possibility of having different flavors of MZM - in the form of angular momentum or something else - can provide a unique path forward for the study of MZMs.

Title: Layer controlled orbital selective Mott transition in monolayer nickelate

Abstract: Dimensionality and electronic correlations are crucial elements of many quantum material properties. An example is the change of the electronic structure accompanied by the loss of quasiparticles when a metal is reduced from three dimensions to a lower dimension, where the Coulomb interaction between carriers becomes poorly screened. Here, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), we report an orbital-selective decoherence of spectral density in the perovskite nickelate LaNiO3 towards the monolayer limit. The spectral weight of the dz2 band vanishes much faster than that of the dx2-y2 band as the thickness of the LaNiO3 layer is decreased to a single unit cell, indicating a stronger correlation effect for the former upon dimensional confinement. Dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) calculations show an orbital-selective Mott transition largely due to the localization of dz2 electrons along the c axis in the monolayer limit. This orbital-selective correlation effect underpins many macroscopic properties of nickelates, such as metal-to-insulator transition and superconductivity, where most theories are built upon a dx2-y2-dz2 two-band model.

Title: Anharmonicity-driven phonon avoided crossing and anomalous thermal transport in nodal-line semimetal ZrSiS
Authors: Xin Jin, Qingqing Zhang, Dengfeng Li, Zhenxiang Cheng, Jianli Wang, Xuewei Lv, Xiaoyuan Zhou, Rui Wang, Xianyong Ding, Peng Yu, Xiaolong Yang
Abstract: Understanding thermal and electrical transport in topological materials is essential for advancing their applications in quantum technologies and energy conversion. Herein, we employ first-principles calculations to systematically investigate phonon and charge transport in the prototypical nodal-line semimetal ZrSiS. The results unveil that anharmonic phonon renormalization results in the pronounced softening of heat-carrying phonons and suppressed lattice thermal conductivity ($\kappa_{\rm L}$). Crucially, anharmonic effects are found to noticeably weaken Zr-S interactions, triggering avoided-crossing behavior of low-frequency optical phonons. The combination of phonon softening and avoided crossing synergistically reduces phonon group velocities, yielding a 16\% suppression in $\kappa_{\rm L}$ along the $c$-axis at room temperature. Contrary to conventional metals, we discover that the lattice contribution to thermal conductivity in ZrSiS is abnormally large, even dominating heat conduction along the $c$-axis. This unusual behavior results in a substantial deviation of the Lorenz number from the Sommerfeld value -- exceeding it by up to threefold -- thereby challenging the validation of standard Wiedemann-Franz law for thermal conductivity estimation. Moreover, our calculations demonstrate that ZrSiS exhibits exceptional electrical conductivity, attributed to its topological electronic Dirac states that accounts for both high Fermi velocities and weak electron-phonon coupling. This study provides critical insights into the electrical and thermal transport mechanisms in ZrSiS and highlights the importance of anharmonic effects in the lattice dynamics and thermal transport of metallic materials.

Title: Trends in the electronic structure of borophene polymorphs
Authors: Alam Osorio, Lucia Reining, Francesco Sottile
Abstract: Borophene is a two-dimensional material made out of boron atoms only. It exhibits polymorphism and different allotropes can be studied in terms of a rigid electronic structure, where only the occupation of the states change with the respect to the number of electrons available in the system (self-doping). In this work we selected a set of representative borophene polymorphs ($\delta_3$, $\delta_5$, $\delta_6$, $\beta_{12}$ $\alpha_1$, $\alpha'$, $\alpha'$-Bilayer) and studied the shared features of their electronic structures and the limitations of this model. Our work revealed the appearance of defect-like states in some polymorphs when related to a parent rigid electronic structure, and bonding/antibonding monolayer-like states in the $\alpha'$-Bilayer. Moreover, we show how the buckling of $\delta_6$ and $\alpha'$ can act as a tuning parameter, enabling semimetallicity, Dirac cones, and nesting of the Fermi surface. In light of their promises for exotic but also useful behavior, we expect our work to foster the interest in larger and more complex borophene structures.

Title: First principles and scanning tunneling spectroscopical evidences for thermodynamically stable "on-top" sulfur divacancy in monolayer WS$_{2}$
Authors: Weiru Chen, John C. Thomas, Yihuang Xiong, Zhuohang Yu, Da Zhou, Shalini Kumari, Zhongwei Dai, Joshua A. Robinson, Mauricio Terrones, Archana Raja, Sinéad Griffin, Alexander Weber-Bargioni, Geoffroy Hautier
Abstract: Chalcogen vacancies in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), such as WS$_{2}$, play a crucial role in various applications ranging from optoelectronics and catalysis to quantum information science (QIS), making their identification and control essential. This study focuses on WS$_{2}$ single vacancy and vacancy pairs. Using first principles computations, we investigate their thermodynamic stabilities and electronic structures. We identify an "on-top" divacancy configuration where two vacancies sit on top of each other to be the only energetically stable complex with a binding energy of 160 meV. We compute a small difference in electronic structure with a shift of the unoccupied state by 140 meV for the divacancy complex and observe electronic state shift during Scanning Tunneling Spectroscopy of a series of vacancy in WS$_2$ providing spectroscopical evidence for the presence of this defect.

Title: Exploring Cation Selection and Disorder within Entropy-Driven $A_{6}B_{2}$O$_{17}$ ($A$=Zr/Hf, $B$=Nb/Ta) Oxides
Authors: Jacob T. Sivak, R. Jackson Spurling, Jon-Paul Maria, Susan B. Sinnott
Abstract: We investigate the local atomic and electronic structure, thermodynamic stability, and defect chemistry of $A_{6}B_{2}$O$_{17}$ ($A$ = Zr/Hf, $B$ = Nb/Ta) oxides using first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations. We examine both ordered unit cells as well as fully disordered special quasirandom structures to clearly discern the effects of cation disorder. Structural predictions align closely with previous experimental results and follow established ionic radii trends. The electronic structure is strongly dependent on $B$-cation species: $A_{6}$Ta$_{2}$O$_{17}$ compositions have ~30% larger band gaps than their $A_{6}$Nb$_{2}$O$_{17}$ counterparts. Defect chemistry is similar for all compositions, with anion vacancies being more energetically favorable than corresponding cation defects. All explored $A_{6}B_{2}$O$_{17}$ compositions are enthalpically unstable with respect to their $A$O$_{2}$ and $B_{2}$O$_{5}$ competing oxides and are therefore classified as entropy-stabilized materials, supporting prior experimental results. The pronounced agreement between our disordered supercell predictions with experimental measurements indicates all explored $A_{6}B_{2}$O$_{17}$ compositions contain substantial cation disorder across all 6-, 7-, and 8-coordinated sites. Our findings collectively provide a fundamental understanding of the $A_{6}B_{2}$O$_{17}$ material family through DFT calculations, establishing a framework for future compositional tuning to engineer targeted material properties.

Title: Re-emergent superconducting state with broken time-reversal symmetry under uniaxial stress
Authors: Anton Talkachov, Egor Babaev
Abstract: We study conditions of the appearance of \$U(1) \times \mathbb{Z}_2\$ superconducting states that spontaneously break time-reversal symmetry (BTRS) on a square lattice as a function of applied stress. We focus on the spin-singlet s+id state. Calculations show that if critical temperatures coincide at zero stress they exhibit linear kink and no kink otherwise. We find that in general, the microscopic calculations show a complex phase diagram, for example, non-monotonic behavior of BTRS transition. Another beyond-Ginzburg-Landau theory result is that \$U(1)\$ critical temperature can decrease under compressional strain for small Poisson ratio materials. In the second part of the paper we consider effects of boundaries and finiteness of the sample on the strain-induced splitting of \$T_c^{U(1)}\$ and \$T_c^{\mathbb{Z}_2}\$ transitions. A finite sample has BTRS boundary states with persistent superconducting currents over a wide range of band filling. Overall, the BTRS dome occupies a larger band filling--temperature phase space region for a mesoscopic sample with [110] surface compared to an infinite system. Hence, the presence of boundaries helps to stabilize the BTRS phase.

Title: Thermoelectric quantum oscillations and Zeeman splitting in topological Dirac semimetal BaAl$_{4}$
Authors: P. R. Mandal, Kefeng Wang, Tarapada Sarkar, Prathum Saraf, Danila Sokratov, Johnpierre Paglione
Abstract: Three-dimensional topological semimetals hosting Dirac or Weyl fermions are a new kind of materials class in which conduction and valence bands cross each other. Such materials harbor a nontrivial Berry phase, which is an additional geometrical phase factor arising along the path of an adiabatic surface and can give rise to experimentally measurable quantities such as an anomalous Hall component. Here we report a systematic study of quantum oscillations of thermoelectric power in single crystals of the topological Dirac nodal-line semimetal BaAl$_{4}$. We show that the thermoelectric power (TEP) is a sensitive probe of the multiple oscillation frequencies in this material, with two of these frequencies shown to originate from the three-dimensional Dirac band. The detected Berry phase provides evidence of the angular dependence and non-trivial state under high magnetic fields. We also have probed the signatures of Zeeman splitting, from which we have extracted the Landé $g$-factor for this system, providing further insight into the non-trivial topology of this family of materials.

Title: Statistics and morphologies of stable droplets in scalar active fluids
Authors: Kathrin Hertäg, Joshua F. Robinson, Thomas Speck
Abstract: Conventional phase segregation is controlled by a positive interfacial tension, which implies that the system relaxes towards a state in which the interfacial area (or length) is minimized, typically manifesting as a single droplet that grows with the system size. Intriguingly, the extension of the underlying Model B paradigm by two non-potential terms (Active Model B+) is able to describe the stable coexistence of many finite droplets. Here we numerical study Active Model B+ in the vicinity of the transition between a single droplet (macrophase segregation) and multiple droplets (microphase segregation). Our results show that, although noise shifts transitions, the overall agreement with the mean-field theoretical predictions is very good. We find a strong correlation of droplet properties with a single parameter that determines the number, density, and the fractal dimension of droplets. Deeper inside the droplet phase we observe another transition to a hexagonal lattice of regular droplets.

Title: Optical probing of charge traps in organic field-effect transistors
Authors: Dean Kos, Marta Mas-Torrent
Abstract: We report spatially resolved optical probing of charge traps in organic field-effect transistors using focussed laser illumination. By scanning a 635 nm laser across the transistor channel and simultaneously acquiring transfer characteristics, we observe persistent, localised shifts in transistor turn-on voltage correlated with illumination dose and position, with negligible impact on field-effect mobility. The effect is strongest 5-10 um from the source electrode and requires a drain-to-source scan direction with sub-10 um step size. Kelvin probe force microscopy confirms trapped negative charges along the scan path, consistent with exciton dissociation and electron trapping near the semiconductor-dielectric interface. The phenomenon is reproducible across multiple device geometries and organic semiconductors, including TMTES-pentacene, TIPS-pentacene, and diF-TES-ADT. These findings enable direct mapping of trap distributions and suggest new strategies for trap engineering, threshold voltage tuning, and development of organic optoelectronic memories.

Title: Detachment limited interlayer transport processes during SrTiO3 pulsed laser epitaxy
Authors: Jeffrey G. Ulbrandt, Xiaozhi Zhang, Randall L. Headrick
Abstract: Pulsed laser epitaxial growth is characterized by high instantaneous deposition rates that leads to the nucleation of transient islands, both on surface terraces, and on top of stable islands formed during previous deposition pulses. We report results from combined in-situ X-ray reflectivity and kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulations. Specular reflectivity monitors interlayer transport, while diffuse scattering reveals the evolution of in-plane length scales, both during the recovery time between individual laser pulses and over multiple deposited layers. The initial stage after each laser pulse is faster than the temporal resolution of the experiment, while subsequent recovery occurs over seconds. The results suggest that transient islands on top of stable two-dimensional islands form immediately after the deposition pulse, and then ripen via detachment and diffusion, leading to the slower component. kMC simulations show that the detachment energy barrier plays a dominant role in determining the recovery time constant.

Title: Orbital-Selective Band Structure Evolution in BaFe$_{2-x}$M$_x$As$_2$ (M = Cr, Co, Cu, Ru and Mn) Probed by Polarization-Dependent ARPES
Authors: K. R. Pakuszewski, M. R. Cantarino, I. Romanenko, A. P. Machado, M. M. Piva, G. S. Freitas, H. B. Pizzi, F. A. Garcia, P. G. Pagliuso, C. Adriano
Abstract: We present a systematic study of the evolution of the band structure in the Fe-based superconductor family BaFe$_{2-x}$M$_x$As$_2$ (M = Cr, Co, Cu, Ru and Mn) using polarization-dependent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). Low-substituted samples, with comparable spin-density wave transition temperatures ($T_\text{SDW}$), were chosen to facilitate controlled comparisons. The sizes of the central hole pockets ($\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$) remain largely unchanged across different substitutions, showing no clear correlation with either $T_\text{SDW}$ or the As height relative to the Fe planes. However, subtle trends are observed: a modest increase in the size of the $\eta_\text{X}$ electron pocket correlates with the suppression of $T_\text{SDW}$. Furthermore, the contraction of the $\eta_\text{X}$ pocket appears to be linked to an increase in the As height relative to the Fe planes. Our results suggest that the suppression of $T_\text{SDW}$ is primarily driven by changes in the Fe-As bond length, with the effect being more pronounced in electronic states with planar character. These findings provide insight into the electronic structure of BaFe$_{2-x}$M$_x$As$_2$.

Title: First principles band structure of interacting phosphorus and boron/aluminum $δ$-doped layers in silicon
Authors: Quinn T. Campbell, Andrew D. Baczewski, Shashank Misra, Evan M. Anderson
Abstract: Silicon can be heavily doped with phosphorus in a single atomic layer (a $\delta$ layer), significantly altering the electronic structure of the conduction bands within the material. Recent progress has also made it possible to further dope silicon with acceptor-based $\delta$ layers using either boron or aluminum, making it feasible to create devices with interacting $\delta$ layers with opposite polarity. It is not known, however, how these $\delta$ layers will interact, particularly at small separation distances. Using Density Functional Theory, we calculate the electronic structure of a phosphorus-based $\delta$ layer interacting with a boron or aluminum $\delta$ layer, varying the distances between the $\delta$ layers. At separations 10 Å and smaller, the dopant potentials overlap and largely cancel each other out, leading to an electronic structure closely mimicking bulk silicon. At separations greater than 10 Å, the two layers behave independently of one another, forming a p-n diode with an intrinsic layer taking the place of the depletion region. One mechanism for charge transfer between $\delta$ layers at larger distances could be tunneling, where we see a greater than 3\% probability for tunneling between a phosphorus and boron layer at 20 Å separation. This tunneling rate exceeds what would be seen for a standard silicon 1.1 eV triangular barrier, indicating that the interaction between delta layers creates enhanced tunneling at larger separation distances compared to a traditional junction. These calculations provide a foundation for the design of silicon-based electronics based on interacting $\delta$ layers.

Title: Atomistic mechanisms of oxidation and chlorine corrosion in Ni-based superalloys: The role of boron and light interstitial segregation
Authors: Tyler D. Doležal, Rodrigo Freitas, Ju Li
Abstract: Hybrid Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations were used to investigate the interaction of light interstitials in multi-element Ni-based alloys. We show that light interstitials such as boron and oxygen fundamentally alter interfacial chemistry by reshaping alloy-element distribution and segregation. Oxygen adsorption drove boron migration from the grain boundary to the free surface, where it co-enriched with Cr, Fe, and Mo and formed BO3 trigonal motifs embedded within mixed-metal oxide networks. Oxygen also promoted M-O-M chain formation, including Nb2O5 clusters at the free surface. In the absence of oxygen, boron segregated to the grain boundary, altering local metal chemistry and underscoring a dynamic, environment-sensitive behavior. Following chlorine exposure, the oxidized surfaces retained strong O-mediated connectivity while forming new Cl-M associations, particularly with Nb and Cr, and exhibited further surface enrichment in Cr, Fe, and Mo. High-temperature MD simulations revealed a dynamic tug-of-war: chlorine exerted upward pull and disrupted weakly anchored sites, while Nb- and BO3-rich oxide motifs resisted deformation. A new stabilization mechanism was identified in which subsurface boron atoms anchored overlying Cr centers, suppressing their mobility and mitigating chlorine-driven displacement. These results demonstrate boron's dual role as a modifier of alloy-element segregation and a stabilizer of oxide networks, and identify Nb as a key element in reinforcing cohesion under halogen attack. More broadly, this study highlights the need to track light interstitial cross-talk and solute migration under reactive conditions, offering atomistic criteria for designing corrosion-resistant surface chemistries in Ni-based superalloys exposed to halogenated or oxidative environments.

Title: High temperature superconductivity with giant pressure effect in 3D networks of boron doped ultra-thin carbon nanotubes in the pores of ZSM-5 zeolite
Authors: Yibo Wang, Tsin Hei Koo, Runqing Huang, Yat Hei Ng, Timothée Tianyu Lortz, Ting Zhang, Wai Ming Chan, Yuxiao Hou, Jie Pan, Rolf Lortz, Ning Wan, Ping Sheng
Abstract: We have fabricated three-dimensional (3D) networks of ultrathin carbon nanotubes (CNTs) within the ~5-Angstrom diameter pores of zeolite ZSM-5 crystals using the chemical vapour deposition (CVD) process. The 1D electronic characteristics of ultrathin CNTs are characterized by van Hove singularities in the density of states. Boron doping was strategically employed to tune the Fermi energy near a van Hove singularity, which is supported by extensive ab-initio calculations, while the 3D network structure ensures the formation of a phase-coherent bulk superconducting state under a 1D to 3D crossover. We report characteristic signatures of superconductivity using four complementary experimental methods: magnetization, specific heat, resistivity, and point-contact spectroscopy, all consistently support a critical temperature Tc at ambient conditions ranging from 220 to 250 K. In particular, point-contact spectroscopy revealed a multigap nature of superconductivity with a large ~30 meV leading gap, in rough agreement with the prediction of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory of superconductivity. The differential conductance response displays a particle-hole symmetry and is tuneable between the tunnelling and Andreev limits via the transparency of the contact, as uniquely expected for a superconductor. Preliminary experiments also reveal a giant pressure effect which increases the Tc above the ambient temperature.

Title: Photo-Induced Enhancement of Critical Temperature in a Phase Competing Spin-Fermion System
Authors: Sankha Subhra Bakshi
Abstract: Ultrafast optical excitation is known to destabilize long-range order in correlated systems, yet experiments have also reported the emergence of metastable phases, in some cases with enhanced critical temperatures. The microscopic origin of such light-induced stabilization remains unresolved. Here we investigate this problem within a minimal spin-fermion framework: a double-exchange model at half filling, augmented by ferromagnetic superexchange on a square lattice. In equilibrium, at half-filling the ordering temperature is set by the competition between kinetic-energy-driven antiferromagnetism and superexchange-induced ferromagnetism. Using quantum Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert-Brown dynamics for localized spins combined with mean-field evolution of itinerant electrons, we demonstrate a nonthermal mechanism for stabilizing ordered phases. Photoexcitation creates a long-lived nonequilibrium carrier population that resists thermalization and reshapes the low-energy landscape, converting kinetic-energy-driven antiferromagnetism into ferromagnetism and enhancing the critical temperature. While model-specific, our results reveal a general microscopic pathway by which light can tip the balance between competing orders, suggesting routes toward optically engineered magnetism, charge-density-wave order, and superconductivity.

Title: Extending Sample Persistence Variable Reduction for Constrained Combinatorial Optimization Problems
Authors: Shunta Ide, Shuta Kikuchi, Shu Tanaka
Abstract: Constrained combinatorial optimization problems (CCOPs) are challenging to solve due to the exponential growth of the solution space. When tackled with Ising machines, constraints are typically enforced by the penalty function method, whose coefficients must be carefully tuned to balance feasibility and objective quality. Variable-reduction techniques such as sample persistence variable reduction (SPVAR) can mitigate hardware limitations of Ising machines, yet their behavior on CCOPs remains insufficiently understood. Building on our prior proposal, we extend and comprehensively evaluate multi-penalty SPVAR (MP-SPVAR), which fixes variables using solution persistence aggregated across multiple penalty coefficients. Experiments on benchmark problems, including the quadratic assignment problem and the quadratic knapsack problem, demonstrate that MP-SPVAR attains higher feasible-solution ratios while matching or improving approximation ratios relative to the conventional SPVAR algorithm. An examination of low-energy states under small penalties clarifies when feasibility degrades and how encoding choices affect the trade-off between solution quality and feasibility. These results position MP-SPVAR as a practical variable-reduction strategy for CCOPs and lay a foundation for systematic penalty tuning, broader problem classes, and integration with quantum-inspired optimization hardware as well as quantum algorithms.

Title: Molecular Insights into Caprock Integrity of Subsurface Hydrogen Storage: Perspective on Hydrogen-induced Swelling and Mechanical Response
Authors: Mehdi Ghasemi, Mohamad Ali Ghafari, Masoud Babaei, Valentina Erastova
Abstract: The geological storage of hydrogen (H_2) requires reliable long-term caprock sealing, yet the nanoscale interactions between H_2 and clay minerals remain critically underexplored despite their importance for storage security. This lack of understanding has limited the ability to predict mechanical stability and leakage risks in H_2 storage formations. Using molecular simulations, this study investigates the swelling behavior and mechanical properties of sodium montmorillonite (Mt), a common smectite clay, under varying hydration states and interlayer H_2 contents. Results show that H_2 accelerates hydration-state transitions, narrows the stability window of crystalline swelling, and promotes asymmetric plume formation in confined interlayers. H_2 alters cation and water coordination, thereby weakening Na^+--Mt electrostatic interactions and modulating H-bond networks at the interface and in the bulk. Mechanical analysis reveals pronounced anisotropy in Mt. In-plane stiffness is mainly governed by basal spacing expansion, whereas out-of-plane stiffness is highly sensitive to the initial presence of water or H_2, which weaken interlayer cohesion. Tensile and compressive strengths in the in-plane directions follow in-plane stiffness trends, while the out-of-plane tensile strength is governed by Mt--water H-bonds. The presence of H_2 further promotes Mt sheets separation by disrupting nanoscale liquid bridges. Collectively, these results provide the first atomistic-scale evidence that intercalated H_2 reshapes swelling energetics, elastic anisotropy, and failure pathways in Mt, highlighting critical nanoscale mechanisms that may compromise caprock integrity during underground H_2 storage.

Title: Quantum oscillations between excitonic and quantum spin Hall insulators in moiré WSe2
Authors: Zhongdong Han, Yiyu Xia, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Kin Fai Mak, Jie Shan
Abstract: Quantum spin Hall insulators (QSHIs) and excitonic insulators (EIs) are prototypical topological and correlated states of matter, respectively. The topological phase transition between the two has attracted much theoretical interest but experimental studies have been hindered by the availability of tunable materials that can access such a transition. Here, by utilizing the interaction-enhanced g-factor and the flat moiré bands in twisted bilayer WSe2 (tWSe2), we realize tunable electron-like and hole-like Landau levels (LLs) in the opposite valleys of tWSe2 under a perpendicular magnetic field. At half-band-filling, which corresponds to electron-hole charge neutrality, periodic oscillations between QSHIs (for fully filled LLs) and EIs (for half-filled LLs) are observed due to the interplay between the cyclotron energy and the intervalley correlation; QSHIs with up to four pairs of helical edge states can be resolved. We further analyze the effect of Fermi surface nesting on the stability of EIs via electric field-tuning of the moiré band structure. Our results demonstrate a novel QSHI-to-EI topological phase transition and provide a comprehensive understanding of the fermiology of tWSe2.

Title: Supersolid light in a semiconductor microcavity
Authors: J. L. Figueiredo, J. T. Mendonça, H. Terças
Abstract: Supersolidity - simultaneous superfluid flow and crystalline order - has been realized in quantum atomic systems but remains unexplored in purely photonic platforms operating at weak light-matter coupling. We predict a supersolid phase of light in a plasma-filled optical microcavity, where photons acquire effective mass and interact via nonlocal, plasma-mediated nonlinearities. By deriving a Gross-Pitaevskii equation with a tunable photon-photon interaction kernel, we show that under coherent driving the cavity light field can spontaneously crystallize into a supersolid lattice via modulational instability. Crucially, this supersolid arises from a weak photon-electron coupling enabled by virtual electronic transitions, and it does not require hybrid polariton formation. Using doped semiconductor microcavities, we identify feasible conditions (electron densities $\sim 10^{10}- 10^{11}~\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$ and optical intensities $\sim 10^{2}-10^{4}~\mathrm{W/cm}^{2}$) for experimental realization. This work establishes plasmonic cavities as a platform for correlated photonic matter with emergent quantum order.

Title: Bootstrapping transport in the Drude-Kadanoff-Martin model
Authors: Subham Dutta Chowdhury, Sean A. Hartnoll, Aditya Hebbar, Ruby Khondaker
Abstract: The Drude-Kadanoff-Martin model is a simple low energy and long wavelength description of charge transport, parameterised by the current relaxation timescale $\tau$, charge diffusivity $D$ and charge compressibility $\chi$. We obtain sharp constraints on these parameters in terms of the microscopic energy and length scales of any underlying lattice model with local and bounded interactions. Our primary tools are upper bounds on the retarded Green's function for the charge density in such a setting. We first note that the Drude-Kadanoff-Martin model cannot pertain at microscopic energy scales because it is inconsistent with the exponential suppression of spectral weight at the highest frequencies in a lattice model. Secondly, under the assumption that the low energy dynamics is captured by the model, we obtain a lower bound on the collective mean free path $\ell \equiv \sqrt{\tau D}$. This bound is shown to imply a version of the Mott-Ioffe-Regel bound: systems with $\ell$ much shorter than the lattice length scale cannot have conventional Drude peaks.

Title: Training the classification capability of large-scale quantum cellular automata
Authors: Mario Boneberg, Simon Kochsiek, Gabriele Perfetto, Igor Lesanovsky
Abstract: In the vicinity of a phase transition ergodicity can be broken. Here, different initial many-body configurations evolve towards one of several fixed points, which are macroscopically distinguishable through an order parameter. This mechanism enables state classification in quantum cellular automata and feed-forward quantum neural networks. We demonstrate that this capability can be efficiently learned from training data even in extremely high-dimensional state spaces. We illustrate this using a quantum cellular automaton that allows binary classification, which is closely connected to the dynamics of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric Ising model with local interactions and dissipation. This approach can be generalized beyond binary classification and offers a natural framework for exploring the link between emergent many-body phenomena and the interpretation of data processing capabilities in the context of quantum machine learning.

Title: Eigenstate Thermalization in 1+1-Dimensional SU(2) Lattice Gauge Theory Coupled with Dynamical Fermions
Authors: Diptarka Das, Lukas Ebner, Saurabh V. Kadam, Indrakshi Raychowdhury, Andreas Schäfer, Xiaojun Yao
Abstract: We test the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) in 1+1-dimensional SU(2) lattice gauge theory (LGT) with one flavor of dynamical fermions. Using the loop-string-hadron framework of the LGT with a bosonic cut-off, we exactly diagonalize the Hamiltonian for finite size systems and calculate matrix elements (MEs) in the eigenbasis for both local and non-local operators. We analyze different indicators to identify the parameter space for quantum chaos at finite lattice sizes and investigate how the ETH behavior emerges in both the diagonal and off-diagonal MEs. Our investigations allow us to study various time scales of thermalization and the emergence of random matrix behavior, and highlight the interplays of the several diagnostics with each other. Furthermore, from the off-diagonal MEs, we extract a smooth function that is closely related to the spectral function for both local and non-local operators. We find numerical evidence of the spectral gap and the memory peak in the non-local operator case. Finally, we investigate aspects of subsystem ETH in the lattice gauge theory and identify certain features in the subsystem reduced density matrix that are unique to gauge theories.

Title: Emergent topology of optimal networks for synchrony
Authors: Guram Mikaberidze, Dane Taylor
Abstract: Real-world networks, whether shaped by evolution or intelligent design, are typically optimized for some functionality while adhering to physical, geometric, or budget constraints. Yet, theoretical and computational tools for identifying such optimal structures remain limited. We develop a gradient-based optimization framework to identify synchrony-optimal weighted networks under a constrained coupling budget. The resulting networks exhibit a combination of counterintuitive features: they are sparse, bipartite, elongated, and extremely monophilic (i.e., the neighbors of any given node are highly similar to one another while differing from the node itself). These computational findings are matched by a "constructive" theory for optimal networks; a nonlinear differential equation identifies the optimal pairing of nodes for edges, whereas a variational principle prescribes optimal node-strength allocation. The resulting dynamics provably lack the traditional synchronization threshold; instead, as the budget exceeds a calculable critical value, the system becomes globally phase-locked, exhibiting critical scaling at the transition. Our results have broad implications for real-world systems including power grids, neuromorphic computing, and coupled oscillator technologies.

Title: Chiral Color Code : Single-shot error correction for exotic topological order
Authors: Dongjin Lee, Beni Yoshida
Abstract: We present a family of simple three-dimensional stabilizer codes, called the chiral color codes, that realize fermionic and chiral topological orders. In the qubit case, the code realizes the topological phase of a single copy of the fermionic toric code. For qudit systems with local dimension $d$, the model features a chiral parameter $\alpha$ and realizes 3D topological phases characterized by $\mathbb{Z}_d^{(\alpha)}$ anyon theories with anomalous chiral surface topological order. On closed manifolds, the code has a unique ground state after removing bulk transparent fermions or bosons. Furthermore, we prove that the bulk is short-range entangled (for odd $d$, coprime $\alpha$) by constructing an explicit local quantum channel that prepares the ground state. The chiral color codes are constructed within the gauge color code, and hence inherit its fault-tolerant features: they admit single-shot error correction and allow code switching to other stabilizer color codes. These properties position the chiral color codes as particularly useful platforms for realizing and manipulating fermions and chiral anyons.

Title: A scalable route to first-order response properties with correlated sampling phaseless auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo
Authors: Leon Otis, Sri Gudivada, Marvin Friede, James Shee
Abstract: To make useful connections with experimental measurements, correlated electronic structure theories must accurately predict chemical properties in addition to energies. We present a finite-difference based algorithm to compute first-order response properties with phaseless auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (ph-AFQMC) that relies on a branching correlated sampling approach. Focusing on electric dipole moments, we show that mean-field trial wave functions are sufficient to obtain high accuracy relative to CCSD(T) and experimental measurements for a set of 21 molecules, ranging in size from 2 to 18 atoms in their equilibrium geometries. As with energies, the quality of predicted dipole moments can be systematically improved with the use of correlated trial wave functions, even (or especially) in strongly correlated regimes. We show that the challenges faced by low-order perturbation theories in predicting the dipole moment of hydrogen fluoride across its dissociation coordinate are overcome with ph-AFQMC when using relatively simple trials. The key advantage of our approach over those previously reported for ph-AFQMC is its scalability to large system sizes with a phaseless bias no worse than that of a typical ground-state energy calculation; we routinely converge dipole moments for systems with more than one thousand basis functions.

Title: Quantum chaos and pole skipping in two-dimensional conformal perturbation theory
Authors: Curtis T. Asplund, Sebastian Fischetti, Alexandra Miller, David M. Ramirez
Abstract: We analyze pole skipping in two-dimensional field theories perturbed away from conformality by a relevant deformation. The leading-order correction to the retarded Green's function can be formally computed in conformal perturbation theory, though it results in singular expressions. We suggest a natural interpretation of these expressions and compute the resulting Green's function to leading nontrivial order in the deformation. As a check of our results, we compare the skipped poles we find to the butterfly velocity obtained from a holographic gravitational dual perturbed by a massive scalar field; we find precise agreement. We comment on extensions to subleading order, where agreement with holographic expectations would no longer be expected.

Title: Impact of Nitrogen and Oxygen Interstitials on Niobium SRF Cavity Performance
Authors: Hannah Hu, Young-Kee Kim, Jaeyel Lee, Daniel Bafia
Abstract: Superconducting radio-frequency (SRF) cavities are the leading technology for highly efficient particle acceleration, and their performance can be significantly enhanced through the controlled introduction of interstitial impurities into bulk niobium. Nitrogen doping has demonstrated a substantial reduction in surface resistance losses, which improves the quality factor of the cavities. More recently, oxygen doping has emerged as a promising alternative, demonstrating comparable reductions in surface resistance. In this study, we combine cavity measurements on \SI{1.3}{GHz} niobium SRF cavities subjected to a range of nitrogen- and oxygen-based treatments with material characterizations performed on cavity cutouts processed under identical conditions. This approach allows us to quantitatively assess the contribution of each impurity to the reduction of surface resistance. We find that nitrogen is ten times more effective than oxygen in reducing surface resistance at \SI{16}{MV/m}. We propose a model to explain this variation, suggesting that nitrogen more effectively traps hydrogen, thus suppressing the formation of niobium hydrides within the RF penetration layer and enabling an improved superconducting gap.

Title: Interaction Topological Transformer for Multiscale Learning in Porous Materials
Authors: Dong Chen, Jian Liu, Chun-Long Chen, Guo-Wei Wei
Abstract: Porous materials exhibit vast structural diversity and support critical applications in gas storage, separations, and catalysis. However, predictive modeling remains challenging due to the multiscale nature of structure-property relationships, where performance is governed by both local chemical environments and global pore-network topology. These complexities, combined with sparse and unevenly distributed labeled data, hinder generalization across material families. We propose the Interaction Topological Transformer (ITT), a unified data-efficient framework that leverages novel interaction topology to capture materials information across multiple scales and multiple levels, including structural, elemental, atomic, and pairwise-elemental organization. ITT extracts scale-aware features that reflect both compositional and relational structure within complex porous frameworks, and integrates them through a built-in Transformer architecture that supports joint reasoning across scales. Trained using a two-stage strategy, i.e., self-supervised pretraining on 0.6 million unlabeled structures followed by supervised fine-tuning, ITT achieves state-of-the-art, accurate, and transferable predictions for adsorption, transport, and stability properties. This framework provides a principled and scalable path for learning-guided discovery in structurally and chemically diverse porous materials.

Title: Overcoming limitations on gate fidelity in noisy static exchange-coupled surface qubits
Authors: Hoang-Anh Le, Saba Taherpour, Denis Janković, Christoph Wolf
Abstract: Recent experiments demonstrated that the spin state of individual atoms on surfaces can be quantum-coherently controlled through all-electric electron spin resonance. By constructing interacting arrays of atoms this results in an atomic-scale qubit platform. However, the static exchange coupling between qubits, limited lifetime and polarization of the initial state, impose significant limits on high-fidelity quantum control. We address this issue using open quantum systems simulation and quantum optimal control theory. We demonstrate the conditions under which high-fidelity operations ($\mathcal{F} \gtrsim 0.9$) are feasible in this qubit platform, and show how the Krotov method of quantum optimal control theory adapts to specific noise sources to outperform the conventional Rabi drivings. Finally, we re-examine the experimental setup used in the initial demonstration of this qubit platform and propose optimized experimental designs to maximize gate fidelity in this platform.

Abstract: Superfluorescence, a cooperative emission phenomenon arising from the coherent coupling of excited dipoles, has historically been observed under optical excitation in carefully engineered quantum systems. Here, we report the first observation of superfluorescence triggered by ionizing radiation in lead-halide perovskite nanocrystal (NC) superlattices. Using CsPbBr3 NC superlattices with long-range structural and electronic order, we demonstrate that secondary electrons generated by high-energy photons can induce efficient cooperative emission bursts characteristic of superfluorescence with unprecedented scintillation lifetime of ~40 ps, thereby introducing a new class of coherent scintillating metamaterials. Side-by-side optical and scintillation measurements reveal a direct analogy between ionizing and intense optical excitation, both leading to high excitonic densities that result in superfluorescent emission, even at mild, technologically accessible cryogenic temperatures. The discovery that incoherent, stochastic ionization cascades can seed coherent many-body optical responses with radiatively accelerated luminescence and large Stokes shifts establishes a pathway toward ultrafast, reabsorption-free, quantum-ordered nanotechnological scintillators, paving the way for the future development of radiation detectors based on quantum technologies for advanced radiation detection applications.

Title: Soft X-ray Ptychography with SOPHIE: Guide and Instrumentation
Authors: Tim A. Butcher, Simone Finizio, Lars Heller, Nicholas W. Phillips, Blagoj Sarafimov, Carlos A. F. Vaz, Armin Kleibert, Benjamin Watts, Mirko Holler, Jörg Raabe
Abstract: Soft X-ray ptychography is becoming a key synchrotron microscopy technique in the fields of condensed matter physics, chemistry, environmental and life sciences. Its attractiveness across broad disciplinary fields is owed to the favorable combination of high spatial resolution and strong contrast mechanisms. The SOft X-ray Ptychography Highly Integrated Endstation (SOPHIE) at the Swiss Light Source (SLS) was developed to accommodate soft X-ray ptychography experiments requiring high spatial resolution, in addition to high chemical and ferroic sensitivities. An introduction to soft X-ray ptychography with SOPHIE aimed at prospective users is provided. Furthermore, an overview of the instrumentation of SOPHIE is given along with an example of the imaging capabilities, which demonstrate the achievement of a sub-5 nm spatial resolution at a photon energy of 706 eV.

Title: Magnon-photon coupling in the YIG-based disk and ring microcavities
Authors: S.S. Demirchyan, D.M. Krichevsky, V.I. Belotelov
Abstract: Optomagnonic dielectric resonators offer a promising platform for the bidirectional conversion of microwave and optical photons at the single quantum level. Current implementation of such a conversion lacks from low magneto-optical interaction strength, limiting its practical utilization in quantum technologies. The main bottleneck is the small spatial overlap between optical and magnon modes. Here, we show that utilization of a disk and ring geometries notably increases the mode overlap. We analyze the interaction volume of optical whispering gallery and magnon Kittel modes inside yttrium iron garnet disk and ring microcavities of various sizes and found a significant improvement in modes coupling up to $\sim4.5~kHz$ . Maximal theoretical conversion efficiency for small disks with radius $5~\mu m$ can reach unity for optimal optical power $\sim100~\mu W$, which is experimentally feasible. Strategies for further improvements of interactions are discussed.

Title: Non-Lagrangian phases of matter from Wilsonian renormalization of 3D Wess-Zumino-Witten theory on Stiefel manifolds
Authors: Shouryya Ray
Abstract: I study the renormalization of D-dimensional level-k Wess-Zumino-Witten theory with Stiefel-manifold target space $\mathrm{St}_{N,N-D-1} \cong \mathrm{SO}(N)/\mathrm{SO}(D+1)$, with a particular focus on $D = 3$. I investigate in particular whether such a theory admits IR-stable fixed points of the renormalization group flow. Such fixed points have been suggested to describe conformal phases of matter that do not have a known dual (super-)renormalizable Lagrangian for $N \geq 7$ in $D = 3$. They are hence of interest both from the point of view of quantum phases of matter as well as pure field theory. The $D$-dimensional expressions enable the computation, by analytic computation, of beta functions in $D = 2 + \epsilon$, at least to first non-trivial order. In $D = 2$, a stable fixed point is found, serving a generalization of the famed $\mathrm{SU}(2)_k$ Wess-Zumino-Witten conformal field theory; it annihilates in $D = 2 + \epsilon$ with an unstable fixed point which splits off from the Gaussian one for $\epsilon > 0$. Although the story is thus qualitatively similar to that of SO(5) deconfined (pseudo-)criticality, for $N \geqslant 6$, the annihilation appears to occur only for $\epsilon > 1$, suggesting the existence of a stable phase in $D = 3$. Comparisons of the scaling dimension of the lowest singlet operator are made with known results for $N = 6$, which is dual to QED$_3$ with $N_\mathrm{f} = 4$ fermion flavors. The predictions for the $N = 7$ Stiefel liquid represent to my knowledge the first computation of this kind for a Wess-Zumino-Witten theory without a known gauge theory dual.

Title: High harmonic generation from a Bose-Einstein condensate
Authors: Philipp Stammer
Abstract: Lasers provide intense coherent radiation, essential to cool and trap atoms into a Bose-Einstein condensate or can alternatively drive the non-linear dynamics of high-order harmonic generation. Yet, these two fundamental processes remained of independent consideration. Here, we connect matter waves at ultracold temperatures with radiation bursts on the ultrafast attosecond timescale. We do this by exploring high harmonic generation from a Bose-Einstein condensate.

Abstract: A quantum electrodynamical time-dependent density functional theory framework is applied to describe strongly coupled light--matter interactions in cavity environments. The formalism utilizes a tensor product approach, coupling real-space electronic wave functions with Fock space photonic states. Various molecular systems serve as test cases to examine how coupling parameters and cavity frequencies affect molecular geometry, polaritonic spectra, and intermolecular binding.

Title: Impact of Static Disorder and Dephasing on Quantum Transport in LH1-RC Models
Authors: Stephon Alexander, Roger Andrews, Oliver Fox, Sarben Sarkar
Abstract: We numerically study excitation transfer in an artificial LH1--RC complex -- an $N$-site donor ring coupled to a central acceptor -- driven by a narrowband optical mode and evolved under a Lindblad master equation with loss and dephasing. In the absence of disorder, the light-driven system exhibits a tall, narrow on-resonance efficiency peak (near unity for our parameters); dephasing lowers and narrows this peak without shifting its position. Off resonance, the efficiency shows environmentally assisted transport with a clear non-monotonic dependence on dephasing and a finite optimum. Under static disorder, two regimes emerge: photon--ring coupling and diagonal energetic disorder mix the drive into dark ring modes, activate dissipative channels, and depress efficiency over a detuning window, whereas intra-ring coupling disorder has a much smaller impact in the tested range; increasing the intra-ring coupling $g$ moves dark-mode crossings away from the operating detuning and restores near-peak performance. In the ordered, symmetric, single-excitation, narrowband limit we \emph{analytically derive} closed-form transfer efficiencies by projecting onto the $k{=}0$ bright mode and solving the photon--bright mode--acceptor trimer via a Laplace/linear-algebra (determinant) formula; these expressions include a probability-conservation identity $\eta + \sum_k L_k = 1$ that benchmarks the simulations and quantitatively predicts the resonant line shape and its dephasing-induced narrowing. A minimal ring toy model further reproduces coherent trapping and its relief by moderate dephasing (ENAQT). These analytics are exact in the ordered limit and serve as mechanistic guides outside this limit, yielding practical design rules for robust, bio-inspired light-harvesting devices.

Title: Sodium-Decorated Ennea-Graphene: A Novel 2D Carbon Allotrope for High-Capacity Hydrogen Storage
Authors: Bill D. Aparicio Huacarpuma, José A. S. Laranjeira, Nicolas F. Martins, Julio R. Sambrano, Fábio L. Lopes de Mendonça, Alexandre C. Dias, Luiz A. Ribeiro Junior
Abstract: The development of safe, efficient, and reversible hydrogen storage materials is critical for advancing hydrogen-based energy technologies and achieving carbon-neutral goals. Ennea-Graphene, a new 2D carbon allotrope made of 4-, 5-, 6-, and mainly 9-membered carbon rings (nonagons), is introduced via Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. Phonon dispersion and ab initio molecular dynamics demonstrate that the monolayer is mechanically and dynamically stable at 300 K, as no imaginary modes are detected. The pristine system further exhibits metallic-like electronic behavior. The material exhibits high in-plane stiffness (Young modulus of 255 N/m). Sodium adsorption at the centers of the nonagonal rings is energetically favorable, with a binding energy of approximately -1.56 eV, leading to the formation of the Na@Ennea-Graphene complex. The calculated H2 adsorption energies range from -0.15 eV to -0.18 eV. The Na-decorated structure demonstrates excellent hydrogen storage performance, reversibly adsorbing up to four H2 molecules per Na atom (8.8 wt\% H2). This capacity surpasses the U.S. Department of Energy's 2025 target for onboard hydrogen storage materials. The adsorbed H2 remains molecular (H-H bond of 0.76~Å) and can be released under near-ambient conditions, as verified by 300 K ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. These findings position sodium-decorated Ennea-Graphene as a promising nanomaterial for next-generation hydrogen storage technologies.

Title: Bayesian Neural Networks versus deep ensembles for uncertainty quantification in machine learning interatomic potentials
Authors: Riccardo Farris, Emanuele Telari, Nongnuch Artrith, Konstantin Neyman, Albert Bruix
Abstract: Neural-network-based machine learning interatomic potentials have emerged as powerful tools for predicting atomic energies and forces, enabling accurate and efficient simulations in atomistic modeling. A key limitation of traditional deep learning approaches, however, is their inability to provide reliable estimates of predictive uncertainty. Such uncertainty quantification is critical for assessing model reliability, especially in materials science, where often the model is applied on out-of-distribution data. Different strategies have been proposed to address this challenge, with deep ensembles and Bayesian neural networks being among the most widely used. In this work, we introduce an implementation of Bayesian neural networks with variational inference in the aenet-PyTorch framework. To evaluate their applicability to machine learning interatomic potentials, we systematically compare the performance of variational BNNs and deep ensembles on a dataset of 7,815 TiO$_{2}$ structures. The models are trained on both the full dataset and a subset to assess how variations in data representation influence predictive accuracy and uncertainty estimation. This analysis provides insights into the strengths and limitations of each approach, offering practical guidance for the development of uncertainty-aware machine learning interatomic potentials.

Title: Non-equilibrium Dynamics of Two-level Systems directly after Cryogenic Alternating Bias
Authors: V. Iaia, E. S. Joseph, S. Im, N. Hagopian, S. O'Kelley, C. Kim, N. Materise, S. Patra, V. Lordi, M. A. Eriksson, P. M. Voyles, K. G. Ray, Y. J. Rosen
Abstract: Two-level systems (TLSs) are tunneling states commonly found in amorphous materials that electrically couple to qubits, resonators, and vibrational modes in materials, leading to energy loss in those systems. Recent studies suggest that applying a large alternating electric field changes the oxide structure, potentially improving the performance of qubits and resonators. In this study, we probe the effect of alternating bias at cryogenic temperatures on TLS dynamics within amorphous oxide parallel-plate capacitors operating in the strongly coupled regime. We bias the TLSs in the capacitors using an electric field. This allows us to spectroscopically image TLSs and extract their densities and dipole moments. When an in-situ alternating bias is applied, the steady-state spectra from the standard TLS model disappear. Post-alternating bias TLS spectroscopy reveals transient behavior, in which the TLS frequency fluctuates on the order of minutes. Thermal cycling above 10 K reverses these effects, restoring the TLS spectrum to its original state, indicating a reversible mechanism. Importantly, the intrinsic loss tangent of the LC oscillator remains unchanged before and after the application of the alternating bias. We propose that the disappearance of the steady-state spectrum are caused by non-equilibrium energy build up from strain in the oxide film introduced by the pulsed voltage bias sequence. Understanding this non-equilibrium energy could inform future models of time-dependent TLS dynamics.

Title: Analytical results for large-$N_c$ scalar QCD$_2$
Authors: Pavel Meshcheriakov
Abstract: We study large-$N_c$ scalar QCD$_2$, a $1+1$-dimensional confining gauge theory with fundamental scalar quarks, whose meson spectrum is governed by a Bethe-Salpeter equation structurally parallel to the 't Hooft equation. Exploiting this structural analogy, we develop a nonperturbative analytic framework, based on integrability and inspired by the Fateev-Lukyanov-Zamolodchikov (FLZ) method, originally devised for the 't Hooft model and later extended in our previous works. Notably, the same Bethe-Salpeter equation also arises in the description of interchain mesons in the doubled Ising model coupled via a spin-spin interaction term. Within the FLZ approach, we find spectral sums and derive a systematic large-$n$ WKB expansion for the meson spectrum. The analytic results reproduce the expected behavior in key asymptotic regimes, such as the near-critical limit $m\to g/\sqrt{\pi}$ and the heavy-quark regime $m\gg g$, and are in good agreement with numerical data. Finally, by analytically continuing the mass parameter into the complex plane, we uncover two infinite families of singularities where individual mesons become massless, suggesting a hidden connection to nontrivial Conformal Field Theories.

Title: Active stop and go motion: a strategy to improve spatial exploration and survival
Authors: Fernando Peruani, Debasish Chaudhuri
Abstract: We consider active Brownian particles that intermittently switch between active and inactive states. Such behavior is ubiquitous at all scales, from bacteria to animals and in artificial active systems. We derive exact expressions for key transport properties, including velocity autocorrelations and diffusion coefficients, and demonstrate that particle dispersion is highly sensitive to minute details, such as whether the memory of active orientation is retained across a stop event. Extending the model to include minimal metabolic dynamics, we show that the average survival time of the particle is maximized at (i)~an optimal stopping frequency and (ii)~a non-trivial optimal diffusivity, which itself depends on the stopping frequency.

Title: Broken detailed balance in driven macroscopic capillary self-assembly
Authors: Stuart J. Thomson, Jack-William Barotta, Daniel M. Harris
Abstract: Macroscopic objects supported by surface tension at the fluid interface can self-assemble through the action of capillary forces arising from interfacial deformations. The resulting self-assembled structures are typically ordered but remain trapped in one of potentially many metastable states in the capillary energy landscape in the absence of external forces. In contrast, microscopic colloidal systems leverage both thermal and active fluctuations to overcome energy barriers, enabling transitions between microstates of the system. We herein utilize supercritical Faraday waves to drive structural rearrangements between metastable states of few-particle clusters of millimetric spheres bound by capillary attractions at the fluid interface. By tracking all microstate transitions experimentally, we find that the system is endowed with a non-zero entropy production rate reflecting broken detailed balance and the system's departure from equilibrium. Our experimental results are in quantitative agreement with simulations of a many-body active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model, pointing to universal features of active and driven self-assembly across scales. These findings invite a corresponding investigation at the microscale using colloids that are themselves active or are placed in a wider class of athermal environments such as bacterial baths.

Title: Time-tronics: from temporal printed circuit board to quantum computer
Authors: Krzysztof Giergiel, Peter Hannaford, Krzysztof Sacha
Abstract: Time crystalline structures can be created in periodically driven systems. They are temporal lattices which can reveal different condensed matter behaviours ranging from Anderson localization in time to temporal analogues of many-body localization or topological insulators. However, the potential practical applications of time crystalline structures have yet to be explored. Here, we pave the way for time-tronics where temporal lattices are like printed circuit boards for realization of a broad range of quantum devices. The elements of these devices can correspond to structures of dimensions higher than three and can be arbitrarily connected and reconfigured at any moment. Moreover, our approach allows for the construction of a quantum computer, enabling quantum gate operations for all possible pairs of qubits. Our findings indicate that the limitations faced in building devices using conventional spatial crystals can be overcome by adopting crystalline structures in time.

Title: Domain Wall Networks as Skyrmion Crystals in Chiral Magnets
Authors: Seungho Lee, Toshiaki Fujimori, Muneto Nitta, Se Kwon Kim
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the ground states of a chiral magnet with a square anisotropy and show that it supports domain wall networks as stable ground states. A domain wall junction in the domain wall network turns out to be a skyrmion with half topological charge and, therefore, the found domain wall network has a second topological nature, a skyrmion crystal. More specifically, we present a ground-state phase diagram of the chiral magnet with varying anisotropy parameters consisting of skyrmion lattices, chiral soliton lattices, and ferromagnetic states. In the presence of the square anisotropy, the skyrmion crystal forms a domain wall network. The size of domains in the domain wall network is shown to be tunable by an external magnetic field, offering a way to realize experimentally detectable domain wall networks.

Abstract: We study point impurities in non-relativistic quantum field theories, with a focus on scale-invariant fixed points. We establish the framework of conformal defects in Schrödinger field theories and their correspondence to many-body states in a harmonic trap. We discuss a multi-critical quantization of the one-body wave function induced by an impurity, with examples of free and unitary Fermi gases. Our results can potentially be tested in experimental setups.

Title: Emergent Weyl-like points in periodically modulated systems
Authors: Fang Qin, Rui Chen
Abstract: We investigate a three-dimensional (3D) topological phase resembling a Weyl semimetal, modulated by a periodic potential and engineered through Floquet dynamics. This system is constructed by stacking two-dimensional Chern insulators and hosts Weyl-like points defined in the parameter space $(k_x, k_y, z)$, distinct from conventional Weyl points in momentum space $(k_x, k_y, k_z)$. The Weyl-semimetal-like phase exhibits characteristics akin to those of Weyl semimetals, including linear dispersion near the Weyl-like points, nontrivial bulk topology, the presence of Fermi arcs connecting the Weyl-like points, and the Berry monopoles. Unlike traditional Weyl semimetals, these features manifest in real space rather than momentum space. Furthermore, we calculate the local density of states, the layer Hall conductance, and the total 3D Hall conductivity, demonstrating that the Weyl-semimetal-like phase remains stable under weak and moderate interlayer couplings. The influence of disorder is also examined: Beyond a critical disorder strength, the Weyl-like points destabilize and the topological phase collapses. Moreover, by computing the Floquet Chern number, we demonstrate that the locations of the Weyl-like points can be tuned via high-frequency laser pumping. Finally, we show that both type-I and II Weyl-like behaviors can arise in a tilted Weyl-like model.

Title: Evidence for Mott Gap Softening Coinciding with Spin Correlations Collapse in a-RuCl3
Authors: Wei Yue, Xiaohu Zheng, Chongli Yang, Kun Peng, Rui-Rui Du
Abstract: The Mott insulator a-RuCl3, featuring the intertwined interplay of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and Kitaev spin correlations, provides an unparalleled platform for probing quantum many-body physics. Using scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS), we compare temperature-dependent dI/dV spectra between in-situ grown monolayers and exfoliated bulk samples. Both systems exhibit pronounced Mott gap softening near 110 K, manifested by spectral weight transfer from Hubbard bands toward the Fermi level, resulting in low-energy correlated charge delocalization. Although this gap softening coincides with Kitaev paramagnetic and structural phase transitions in bulk crystals, monolayer studies provide compelling insights. By eliminating structural phase transition in monolayer sample, we suggest that spin correlations, rather than Coulomb interactions alone, may govern charge dynamics within the Mott-Hubbard framework, challenging conventional Mott-Hubbard paradigms. These results resolve a long-standing controversy regarding the Mott gap magnitude in a-RuCl3 and experimentally confirm the critical role of spin correlations in Mott physics.

Abstract: We propose a thermodynamically based approach for constructing effective rate-type constitutive relations describing finite deformations of metamaterials. The effective constitutive relations are formulated as \emph{second-order} in time rate-type Eulerian constitutive relations between only the Cauchy stress tensor, the Hencky strain tensor and objective time derivatives thereof. In particular, there is no need to introduce additional quantities or concepts such as ``micro-level deformation'',``micromorphic continua'', ``enriched continua'', or elastic solids with frequency dependent material properties. The linearisation of the proposed fully nonlinear (finite deformations) constitutive relations leads, in Fourier space, to the same constitutive relations as those commonly used in theories based on the concepts of frequency dependent density and/or stiffness. From this perspective the proposed constitutive relations reproduce the behaviour predicted by the frequency dependent density and/or stiffness models, but yet they work with constant -- that is motion independent -- material properties. Finally, we argue that the proposed fully nonlinear (finite deformations) second-order in time rate-type constitutive relations do not fall into traditional classes of models for elastic solids (hyperelastic solids/Green elastic solids, first-order in time hypoelastic solids), and that the proposed constitutive relations embody a \emph{new} class of constitutive relations characterising elastic solids.

Title: Mixed-wet percolation on a dual square lattice
Authors: Jnana Ranjan Das, Santanu Sinha, Alex Hansen, Sitangshu B. Santra
Abstract: We present a percolation model that is inspired by recent works on immiscible two-phase flow in a mixed-wet porous medium made of a mixture of grains with two different wettability properties. The percolation model is constructed on a dual lattice where the sites on the primal lattice represent the grains of the porous medium, and the bonds on the dual lattice represent the pores in between the grains. The bonds on the dual lattice are occupied based on the two adjacent sites on the primal lattice, which represent the pores where the capillary forces average to zero. The spanning cluster of the bonds, therefore, represents the flow network through which the two immiscible fluids can flow without facing any capillary barrier. It turns out to be a percolation transition of the perimeters of a site percolation problem. We study the geometrical properties at the criticality of the perimeter system numerically. A scaling theory is developed for these properties, and their scaling relations with the respective density parameters are studied. We also verified their finite-size scaling relations. Though the site clusters and their perimeters look very different compared to ordinary percolation, the singular behaviour of the associated geometrical properties remains unchanged. The critical exponents are found to be those of the ordinary percolation.

Title: Spectral properties of disordered insulating lattice under nonlinear electric field
Authors: Kunal Mozumdar, Herbert F. Fotso, Jong E. Han (University at Buffalo, SUNY, Buffalo, NY)
Abstract: Quenched disorder in a solid state system can result in Anderson localization, where electrons are exponentially localized and the system behaves like an insulator. By solving exactly a disordered electronic lattice model out of equilibrium, we investigate the effect of a DC electric field on Anderson localization in an open system, and provide a minimal platform to study disorder-nonequilibrium interplay in electronic lattice systems. We perform steady-state Keldysh Green's function calculations on an infinite lattice with a finite-range of disorder-active region that are coupled to fermion reservoirs. Our solutions out of a fully electronic model verify Mott's temperature scaling of the variable-range-hopping transport and the Lifshitz tail, well-corroborated by the coherent-potential approximation. We further reveal that a nonequilibrium electronic lattice creates a statistical evolution that shows a counterintuitive shift of the distribution edge in the opposite direction of the band edge. The rich evolution of non-thermal statistics highlights the importance of an explicit band structure and the impurity correlations in strong nonequilibrium theories.

Title: Disorder-induced Diffusion Transport in Flat-band Systems with Quantum Metric
Authors: Chun Wang Chau, Tian Xiang, Shuai A. Chen, K. T. Law
Abstract: Our previous understanding of transport in disordered system depends on the assumption that there is a well-defined Fermi velocity. The Fermi velocity determines important length scales in the system such as the diffusion length and localization length. However, nearly flat band materials with vanishing Fermi velocity, it is uncertain how to understand the disorder effects and what quantities determine the characteristic length scales in the system. In the clean limit, it is expected that the bulk transport is absent. In this work, we demonstrate, with a 1D Lieb lattice, that disorder can induce diffusion transport in a flat-band system with finite quantum metric. As disorder increases, the bulk transmission channels are activated, and the conductance reaches a maximum before decays inversely with disorder strength. Importantly, via the calculation of the wave-packet dynamics numerically, we show that the quantum metric determines the diffusion length of the system. Analytically, we show that the interplay between the disorder and quantum geometry gives rise to an effective Fermi velocity, as captured by the self-consistent Born approximation. The diffusion coefficient is identified from the Bethe-Salpeter equation under the ladder approximation. Our results reveal a disorder-driven delocalization mechanism in flat-band systems with finite quantum metric which cannot be understood by well-established theories of quantum diffusion. Our theory is important for understanding the disorder effects and transport properties of flat band materials such as twisted bilayer graphene which are current under intense investigation.

Title: A quantum monomer-dimer model on Penrose tilings
Authors: Jeet Shah, Gautam Nambiar, Alexey V. Gorshkov, Victor Galitski
Abstract: We define a quantum monomer-dimer model in the space of maximal dimer coverings of quasicrystalline Penrose tilings. Since Penrose tilings do not admit perfect dimer coverings, as shown by F. Flicker et al., PRX 10, 011005 (2020), monomers are necessarily present in our model. The model features a frustration-free Rokhsar-Kivelson (RK) point where the ground state is a uniform superposition of all the exponentially many maximal dimer coverings, despite the presence of a finite density of monomers. We map our model to a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory with matter and calculate various correlators to characterize the phase of the system at the RK point using classical Monte Carlo calculations. Specifically, we compute the dimer-dimer and vison-vison correlators, as well as open Wilson lines and closed Wilson loops corresponding to the monomers and the visons. We find that both the dimer-dimer and vison-vison correlators decay exponentially with distance. The open Wilson lines and closed Wilson loops decay exponentially with the same correlation length, indicating that the gauge theory is in the confined phase, which implies that the system is likely in an ordered phase.

Title: $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ Fermi-Hubbard gas with three-body losses: symmetries and dark states
Authors: Alice Marché, Alberto Nardin, Hosho Katsura, Leonardo Mazza
Abstract: We study an $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ invariant Fermi-Hubbard gas undergoing on-site three-body losses. The model presents eight independent strong symmetries preventing the complete depletion of the gas. By making use of a basis of semi-standard Young tableaux states, we reveal the presence of a rich phenomenology of stationary states. We classify the latter according to the irreducible representation of $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ to which they belong. We finally discuss the presence of three-particle stationary states that are not protected by the $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ symmetry.

Title: Electron transport in disordered insulating lattice under nonlinear electric field
Authors: Kunal Mozumdar, Herbert F. Fotso, Jong E. Han
Abstract: Transport in disordered systems often occurs via the variable range hopping (VRH) in the dilute carrier density limit, where electrons hop between randomly distributed localized levels. We study the nonequilibrium transport by a uniform DC electric field on a one-dimensional insulating tight-binding chain with the on-site disorder, using a disordered-lattice calculation and the coherent potential approximation. We develop a theory of electric-field-assisted variable range hopping as a mechanism for nonlinear transport in a disordered chain. Our disordered-lattice calculations of the electron propagation distance and the electron mobility determine the range of the variable range hopping as $\Delta < W \lesssim 2\Delta$ in the gap $\Delta$. We further propose a nonlinear scaling of the conductivity by an electric field by extending Mott's variable range hopping. The nonlinear conductivity of an electronic lattice model follows the scaling law $\sigma(E) \propto \exp[-(E_0/E)^{\nu}]$ with the exponent $\nu = 1/3$ in one dimension for the VRH. We also discuss the experimental relevance of temperature-dependent nonlinear current-voltage relation.

Title: Automated evaluation of imaginary time strong coupling diagrams by sum-of-exponentials hybridization fitting
Authors: Zhen Huang, Denis Golež, Hugo U. R. Strand, Jason Kaye
Abstract: We present an efficient separation of variables algorithm for the evaluation of imaginary time Feynman diagrams appearing in the bold pseudo-particle strong coupling expansion of the Anderson impurity model. The algorithm uses a fitting method based on AAA rational approximation and numerical optimization to obtain a sum-of-exponentials expansion of the hybridization function, which is then used to decompose the diagrams. A diagrammatic formulation of the algorithm leads to an automated procedure for diagrams of arbitrary order and topology. We also present methods of stabilizing the self-consistent solution of the pseudo-particle Dyson equation. The result is a low-cost and high-order accurate impurity solver for quantum embedding methods using general multi-orbital hybridization functions at low temperatures, appropriate for low-to-intermediate expansion orders. In addition to other benchmark examples, we use our solver to perform a dynamical mean-field theory study of a minimal model of the strongly correlated compound Ca$_2$RuO$_4$, describing the anti-ferromagnetic transition and the in- and out-of-plane anisotropy induced by spin-orbit coupling.

Title: Effects of Stirring Time on Formation of Microplastics Fragmented from Photo-aged Polypropylene
Authors: Kazuya Haremaki, Takumitsu Kida, Yusuke Koide, Takashi Uneyama, Yuichi Masubuchi, Takato Ishida
Abstract: This paper examines the evolution of microplastic (MP) size distributions fragmented from photo-aged polypropylene (PP) in stirred water. PP specimens fragmented into MPs with their size of 1-30 um after UV irradiation and stirring in laboratory settings. These laboratory-fragmented MPs were dispersed into the water during the stirring process. A series of MP size distributions was analyzed from optical microscope images of obtained MPs. The MP size distribution was described by an exponential function in the short stirring time domain, whereas it changed to a power-law function as the stirring time increased. The fragmentation rate of MPs and nanoplastics (NPs) decreased with increasing stirring time. The obtained MP exhibited higher crystallinity than the photo-aged PP specimen after stirring. This result implies that MP fragmentation, as observed under controlled laboratory conditions, is related with the chemi-crystallization of PP.

Title: Chiral order emergence driven by quenched disorder
Authors: Coraline Letouzé, Pascal Viot, Laura Messio
Abstract: Quenched disorder can destroy magnetic order, for example when a random field is applied in a 2-dimensional Ising model. Even when an order exists in the presence of quenched disorder, it is usually only the survival of the order of the clean model. We present here a surprising phenomenon where an order emerges, driven by quenched disorder. This order has nothing in common with the order present in the clean model. This type of \textit{order by disorder} differs from the usual thermal or quantum one. The classical $J_1-J_3$ Heisenberg model on the kagome lattice is studied by parallel tempering Monte Carlo simulations, with site dilution. After analyzing the effect of a few vacancies on the ground state, favoring non-coplanar configurations, we show the emergence of a low-temperature chiral phase and the progressive destruction of the collinear $q=4$ Potts order, the only order present in the absence of vacancies.

Title: Electron-Phonon Coupling Mediated by Fröhlich Interaction in Rb2SnBr6 Perovskite
Authors: C. C. S. Soares, J. S. Rodríguez-Hernández, Bruno P. Silva, Mayra A. P. Gómez, V. S. Neto, A. P. Ayala, C.W.A. Paschoal
Abstract: Due to their well-suited optoelectronic properties, metal halide perovskites are emerging semiconductor materials with potential applications in solar cells, detectors, and light-emitting diodes. Beyond the traditional 3D perovskites, low-dimensional counterparts have more attractive effects such as excitonic emissions and quantum confinements that are enhanced by the reduced dimensionality, which involve the Electron-Phonon Coupling (EPC). Such phenomenon, which comprehends the interaction between charge carriers and lattice vibrations, usually strongly impacts the photoluminescence (PL) response in low-dimensional frameworks. In this paper, we investigated the intrinsic EPC onto low-temperature PL of the zero-dimensional (0D) Rb2SnBr6 perovskite. Temperature-dependent PL measurements, complemented by various characterization techniques and theoretical calculations, revealed broadband emission with a significant Stokes shift attributed to self-trapped excitons (STEs). The Fröhlich mechanism, mediated by interactions between excitonic charge carriers and longitudinal optical (LO) phonons, primarily accounts for the emission broadening through phonon-assisted radiative recombination. The EPC strength was evaluated through the Huang-Rhys factor S=34, confirming strong correlations between electronic and vibrational properties and supporting the STE emission assumption. The possible mechanism of STE formation was evaluated by the Fröhlich parameter {\alpha} of 1.94 for electrons and 4.73 for holes, which points out a major contribution of the hole-polaron quasi-particle on exciton trapping. Our findings give insights regarding the influence of EPC in 0D perovskites and STE formation, which leads to the assessment of Rb2SnBr6 for light-harvesting applications.

Title: Strain-Induced Enhancement of Spin Pumping in Pt/YIG Bilayers
Authors: Lara M. Solis, Santiago J. Carreira, Javier Gómez, Alejandro Butera, María Abellán, Carlos García, Fernando Bonetto, Paolo Vavassori, Javier Briático, Laura B. Steren, Myriam H. Aguirre
Abstract: Enhancing spin-to-charge (S$\rightarrow$C) conversion efficiency remains a key challenge in spintronic materials research. In this work we investigate the effect of substrate-induced strains onto the S$\rightarrow$C efficiency. On one hand, we analyze strains-induced magnetic anisotropies in yttrium iron garnet (Y$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$, YIG) by comparing the magnetic and structural properties of YIG films grown on Gd$_3$Ga$_5$O$_{12}$ (GGG) and (CaGd)$_3$(MgZrGa)$_5$O$_{12}$ (SGGG) substrates. Differences in lattice mismatch - YIG//GGG ($\eta = -0.06 \%$) and YIG//SGGG ($\eta = -0.83 \%$) - lead to out-of-plane tensile strains in the first case and unexpected compressive strain in the latter. On the other hand, we study the spin injection efficiency on Pt/YIG bilayers evaluated by the Inverse Spin Hall Effect (ISHE). We find that the resulting perpendicular magnetic anisotropy in YIG//SGGG, while not dominant over shape anisotropy, correlates with enhanced ISHE signals as observed in Spin Pumping Ferromagnetic Resonance (SP-FMR) and Spin Seebeck effect (SSE) experiments. Strain engineering proves effective in enhancing spin-to-charge conversion, providing insight into the design of efficient spintronic devices.

Title: Direct Evidence of Metal-Ligand Redox in Li-ion Battery Positive Electrodes

Abstract: Describing Li-ion battery positive electrodes in terms of distinct transition metal or oxygen redox regimes can lead to confusion in understanding metal-ligand hybridisation, oxygen dimerisation, and degradation. There is a pressing need to study the electronic structure of these materials and determine the role each cation and anion plays in charge compensation. Here, we employ transition metal L-edge X-ray Resonance Photoemission Spectroscopy in conjunction with Single Impurity Anderson models, Self-consistent Real Space Multiple Scattering spectral simulations, and Dynamical Mean-Field theory calculations to directly evaluate the redox mechanisms in (de-)lithiated battery electrodes. This approach reconciles the redox description of two canonical cathodes -- LiMn$_{0.6}$Fe$_{0.4}$PO$_{4}$ and LiNiO$_{2}$ -- in terms of varying degrees of charge transfer using the established Zaanen-Sawatzky-Allen framework, common to condensed matter physics. In LiMn$_{0.6}$Fe$_{0.4}$PO$_{4}$, the absence of charge transfer means capacity arises due to the depopulation of metal $\textit{3d}$ states, i.e. conventional metal redox. Whereas, in LiNiO$_{2}$, charge transfer dominates and redox occurs through the formation and elimination of ligand hole states. This work clarifies the role of oxygen in Ni-rich system and provides a framework to explain how capacity can be extracted from oxygen-dominated states in highly covalent systems without needing to invoke dimerisation.

Title: Fractionalized fermionic multicriticality in anisotropic Kitaev spin-orbital liquids
Authors: Max Fornoville, Lukas Janssen
Abstract: We study the low-temperature phase diagram of quantum Kitaev-Heisenberg spin-orbital models with XXZ anisotropy on the honeycomb lattice. Within a parton mean-field theory, we identify three different quantum phases, distinguished by their symmetries. Besides a disordered spin-orbital liquid with unbroken U(1) x Z2 spin rotational symmetry, there are two orbital liquid phases characterized by spin long-range order. In these phases, the spin rotational symmetry is spontaneously broken down to residual U(1) and Z2 symmetries, respectively. The symmetric spin-orbital liquid features three flavors of linearly dispersing gapless Majorana fermions. In the symmetry-broken phases, one of the three Majorana excitations remains gapless, while the other two acquire a band gap. The transitions from the symmetric to the symmetry-broken phases are continuous and fall into the fractionalized Gross-Neveu-Z2* and Gross-Neveu-SO(2)* universality classes, respectively. The transition between the ordered phases is discontinuous. Using a renormalization group analysis based on the epsilon expansion, we demonstrate that the triple point in the phase diagram features fractionalized fermionic multicriticality with emergent SO(3) symmetry.

Title: Revisiting the epitaxial Si$_3$N$_4$ crystalline cap on AlGaN/GaN via evolutionary structure search
Authors: Xin Chen, Xin Luo, Duo Wang, Xu Cheng, Peng Cui
Abstract: In our recent experimental work (Appl. Phys. Lett. 125, 122109 (2024)), we observed that crystalline Si$_3$N$_4$ cap layers a few nanometers thick can form in situ on GaN surfaces. Compared with amorphous SiO$_2$ and Al$_2$O$_3$ caps, these crystalline caps yield cleaner GaN/Si$_3$N$_4$ interfaces with fewer defects and improved device performance. These observations raise two questions: why does Si$_3$N$_4$ away from the interface become amorphous as the cap thickens, and what is the actual crystal structure of the interfacial Si$_3$N$_4$? Previous work proposed a defect-wurtzite (DW) model constructed heuristically from $\beta$-Si$_3$N$_4$ and the AlGaN lattice constants, but this model is significantly higher in energy than $\beta$-Si$_3$N$_4$ and disagrees with experiment in both interlayer spacings and electronic gap. Using a systematic structure-search approach under in-plane lattice constraints commensurate with AlGaN, we identify a lower-energy configuration, denoted Lam-Si$_3$N$_4$, with quasi-two-dimensional (laminar) stacking normal to the interface. Under AlGaN-matched metrics, Lam-Si$_3$N$_4$ is about 60 meV/atom more stable than DW-Si$_3$N$_4$ and reproduces the experimentally observed interlayer spacings more closely. The substantial lattice mismatch explains amorphization when the crystalline cap grows far from the interface. Upon full relaxation, both DW- and Lam-Si$_3$N$_4$ exhibit wide $\sim$4 eV band gaps. Under AlGaN constraints, the DW gap collapses to $\sim$1.88 eV whereas Lam-Si$_3$N$_4$ maintains a larger $\sim$2.70 eV gap (for reference, PBE gaps: GaN 1.73 eV, AlN 4.05 eV). The wider gap and improved structural match of Lam-Si$_3$N$_4$ rationalize the superior capping performance and provide guidance for optimizing AlGaN/GaN device encapsulation.

Title: Itinerant ferromagnetism in an SU(3) Fermi-Hubbard model at finite temperatures: A dynamical mean-field theory study
Authors: Juntaro Fujii, Kazuki Yamamoto, Akihisa Koga
Abstract: We investigate an SU(3) Fermi-Hubbard model on a hypercubic lattice at finite temperatures, combining dynamical mean-field theory with continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo simulations. Taking strong correlations into account carefully, we find a ferromagnetically ordered state, in which one of the three components becomes dominant, when holes are doped away from one-third filling. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this ferromagnetically ordered phase undergoes a first-order transition to a paramagnetic state. We clarify the stability of the ferromagnetically ordered state against interaction strength, hole doping, and temperatures. The relevance of generalized Nagaoka ferromagnetism is also addressed, by comparing the results on the Bethe lattice.

Title: Subsystem localization
Authors: Arpita Goswami, Pallabi Chatterjee, Ranjan Modak, Shaon Sahoo
Abstract: We consider a ladder system where one leg, referred to as the ``bath", is governed by an Aubry-André (AA) type Hamiltonian, while the other leg, termed the ``subsystem", follows a standard tight-binding Hamiltonian. We investigate the localization properties in the subsystem induced by its coupling to the bath. For the coupling strength larger than a critical value ($t'>t'_c$), the analysis of the static properties shows that there are three distinct phases as the AA potential strength $V$ is varied: a fully delocalized phase at low $V$, a localized phase at intermediate $V$, and a weakly delocalized (fractal) phase at large $V$. The fractal phase also appears in a narrow region along the boundary between the delocalized and localized phases. An analysis of the projected wavepacket dynamics in the subsystem shows that the delocalized phase exhibits a ballistic behavior, whereas the weakly delocalized phase is subdiffusive. Interestingly, the narrow fractal phase shows a super- to subdiffusive behavior as we go from the delocalized to localized phase. When $t'<t'_c$, the intermediate localized phase disappears, and we find a delocalized (ballistic) phase at low $V$ and a weakly delocalized (subdiffusive) phase at large $V$. Between those two phases, there is also an anomalous crossover regime where the system can be super- or subdiffusive. Beyond the ballistic phase observed at low $V$, we also identify a superdiffusive regime emerging in the limit $t'/V \ll 1$, which continuously approaches the ballistic behavior as $t' \to 0$. Finally, in some limiting scenario, we also establish a mapping between our ladder system and a well-studied one-dimensional generalized Aubry-André (GAA) model.

Title: 1D Transition Metal Oxide Chains as a Challenging Model for Ab Initio Calculations
Authors: Jila Amini, Mojtaba Alaei, Stefano de Gironcoli
Abstract: Providing highly simplified models of strongly correlated electronic systems that challenge {\it ab initio} calculations can serve as a valuable testing ground to improve these methods. In this study, we present a comprehensive study of the structural, magnetic, and electronic properties of one-dimensional transition metal mono-oxide chains (VO, CrO, MnO, FeO, CoO, and NiO) using density functional theory (DFT), DFT+$U$, and coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) calculations. The Hubbard $U$ parameter for DFT+$U$ is determined using the linear response theory. In all systems studied except MnO, the presence of multiple local minima -- primarily due to the electronic degrees of freedom associated with the d-orbitals -- leads to significant challenges for DFT, DFT+U, and Hartree-Fock methods in finding the global minimum in ab initio calculations. Our results indicate that the antiferromagnetic (AFM) state is energetically favored for all chains, except CrO, when using DFT+$U$ and PBE. We analyze the electronic band structures and find that while the PBE approximation often predicts metallic or half-metallic ground states for the ferromagnetic (FM) state, DFT+$U$ approach successfully opens band gaps, correctly predicting insulating behavior in all cases. Furthermore, we compared the energy differences between the AFM and FM states using DFT+$U$ and CCSD for CrO, MnO, FeO, CoO and NiO. Our findings indicate that CCSD predicts larger energy differences in some cases compared to DFT+$U$, suggesting that the Hubbard $U$ parameter obtained through linear response theory may be overestimated when used to calculate energy differences between different magnetic states. For CrO, CCSD predicts an AFM ground state, in contrast to the predictions from DFT+$U$ and PBE methods.

Title: Thermoelectric energy conversion in molecular junctions out of equilibrium
Authors: R. Tuovinen, Y. Pavlyukh
Abstract: Understanding time-resolved quantum transport is crucial for developing next-generation quantum technologies, particularly in nano- and molecular junctions subjected to time-dependent perturbations. Traditional steady-state approaches to quantum transport are not designed to capture the transient dynamics necessary for controlling electronic behavior at ultrafast time scales. In this work, we present a non-equilibrium Green's function formalism, within the recently-developed iterated generalized Kadanoff-Baym ansatz ($i$GKBA), to study thermoelectric quantum transport beyond the wide-band limit approximation (WBLA). We employ the Meir-Wingreen formula for both charge and energy currents and analyze the transition from Lorentzian line-width functions to the WBLA, identifying unphysical divergences in the latter. Our results highlight the importance of finite-bandwidth effects and demonstrate the efficiency of the $i$GKBA approach in modeling time-resolved thermoelectric transport, also providing benchmark comparisons against the full Kadanoff-Baym theory. We exemplify the developed theory in the calculation of time-resolved thermopower and thermoelectric energy conversion efficiency in a cyclobutadiene molecular junction.

Title: Tuning spin-density separation via finite-range interactions: Dimensionality-driven signatures in dynamic structure factors
Authors: Xiaoran Ye, Yi Zhang, Ziheng Zhou, Zhaoxin Liang
Abstract: Spin-density (charge) separation, marked by distinct propagation velocities of spin and density excitations, epitomizes strong correlations, historically confined to one-dimensional (1D) systems. The recent experimental work of S. Dhar, B. Wang, M. Horvath, et al. Nature 642, 53 (2025), using a weakly interacting 3D Bose-Einstein condensate of $^{133}$Cs atoms confined in a 2D optical lattice to realize spin-density separation and demonstrate boson anyonization, motivates a deeper exploration into how dimensionality and interactions govern quantum correlations. In this work, we investigate this in two-component bosonic mixtures with finite-range interactions, probing 1D and 3D dynamics. Using path integral effective field theory within the one-loop approximation, we derive analytical expressions for zero-temperature ground-state energy and quantum depletion, seamlessly recovering contact interaction results in the contact limit. By crafting an effective action for decoupled density and spin modes, we compute dynamic structure factors (DSFs), revealing how finite-range interactions sculpt spin-density separation. A pivotal finding is the dimensionality-driven divergence in DSF peak dynamics: in 1D, peaks ascend to higher frequencies with increasing interaction strength, yielding sharp responses; in 3D, peaks descend to lower frequencies, with broader density wave profiles. These insights highlight dimensionality's critical role in collective excitations and provide a robust theoretical blueprint for probing interaction-driven quantum phenomena via Bragg spectroscopy, paving new pathways for exploring dimensionally tuned quantum correlations in ultracold quantum gases.

Title: Wealth Thermalization Hypothesis and Social Networks
Authors: Klaus M. Frahm, Dima L. Shepelyansky
Abstract: In 1955 Fermi, Pasta, Ulam and Tsingou performed first numerical studies with the aim to obtain the thermalization in a chain of nonlinear oscillators from dynamical equations of motion. This model happend to have several specific features and the dynamical thermalization was established only later in other studies. In this work we study more generic models based on Random Matrix Theory and social networks with a nonlinear perturbation leading to dynamical thermalization above a certain chaos border. These systems have two integrals of motion being total energy and norm so that the theoretical Rayleigh-Jeans thermal distribution depends on temperature and chemical potential. We introduce the wealth thermalization hypothesis according to which the society wealth is associated with energy in the Rayleigh-Jeans distribution. At relatively small values of total wealth or energy there is a formation of the Rayleigh-Jeans condensate, well studied in physical systems such as multimode optical fibers. This condensation leads to a huge fraction of poor households at low wealth and a small oligarchic fraction which monopolizes a dominant fraction of total wealth thus generating a strong inequality in human society. We show that this thermalization gives a good description of real data of Lorenz curves of US, UK, the whole world and capitalization of companies at Stock Exchange of New York SE (NYSE), London and Hong Kong. It is also shown that above a chaos border the dynamical Rayleigh-Jeans thermalization takes place also in social networks with the Lorenz curves being similar to those of wealth distribution in world countries. Possible actions for inequality reduction are briefly discussed.

Title: Enhanced thermoelectric effects in a driven one-dimensional system
Authors: C. X. Zhang, Alessandro Braggio, Alessandro Romito, Fabio Taddei
Abstract: We investigate the thermoelectric properties of a one-dimensional quantum system in the presence of an external driving. We employ Floquet scattering theory to calculate linear-response stationary thermoelectric figures of merit in a single-channel conductor subjected to a periodically varying delta-like potential barrier. We also include a step barrier in one of the leads as a model of a nanoscale inhomogeneous semiconducting system. In the absence of a step barrier, we found that external driving can significantly enhance the Seebeck coefficient, particularly at low temperatures, with a relative increase of up to 200% at high frequencies compared to the static case. In the presence of a step barrier, we found that the thermoelectric Onsager coefficient for the driven case is also enhanced compared to the static case, with a significant photon-assisted effect at low temperatures when the chemical potential is within the semiconductor's gap. Our results demonstrate that external driving can be used to tune and enhance the thermoelectric capabilities of low-electron-density nanodevices.

Title: Noninvertible symmetry and topological holography for modulated SPT in one dimension
Authors: Jintae Kim, Yizhi You, Jung Hoon Han
Abstract: We examine noninvertible symmetry (NIS) in one-dimensional (1D) symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases protected by dipolar and exponential-charge symmetries, which are two key examples of modulated SPT (MSPT). To set the stage, we first study NIS in the $\mathbb{Z}_N \times \mathbb{Z}_N$ cluster model, extending previous work on the $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ case. For each symmetry type (charge, dipole, exponential), we explicitly construct the noninvertible Kramers-Wannier (KW) and Kennedy-Tasaki (KT) transformations, revealing dual models with spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB). The resulting symmetry group structure of the SSB model is rich enough that it allows the identification of other SSB models with the same symmetry. Using these alternative SSB models and KT duality, we generate novel MSPT phases distinct from those associated with the standard decorated domain wall picture, and confirm their distinctiveness by projective symmetry analyses at their interfaces. Additionally, we establish a topological-holographic correspondence by identifying the 2D bulk theories-two coupled layers of toric codes (charge), anisotropic dipolar toric codes (dipole), and exponentially modulated toric codes (exponential)-whose boundaries host the respective 1D MSPT phases.

Title: Thermal relaxation and the complete set of second order transport coefficients for the unitary Fermi gas from kinetic theory
Authors: Christian Hall, Thomas Schaefer
Abstract: We compute the complete set of second order transport coefficients of the unitary Fermi gas, a dilute gas of spin 1/2 particles interacting via an $s$-wave interaction tuned to infinite scattering length. The calculation is based on kinetic theory and the Chapman-Enskog method at second order in the Knudsen expansion. We take into account the exact two-body collision integral. We extend previous results on second order coefficients related to shear stress by including terms related to heat flow and gradients of the fugacity. We confirm that the thermal relaxation time is given by the simple estimate $\tau_\kappa = \kappa m/(c_PT)$ even if the full collision kernel is taken into account. Here, $\kappa$ is the thermal conductivity, $m$ is the mass of the particles, $c_P$ is the specific heat at constant pressure, and $T$ is the temperature.

Title: Ex Situ Fabrication of Superconducting Nanostructures for Low-Temperature STM
Authors: Adrian Greichgauer, Roozbeh Yazdanpanah, Alexey Taskin, Oliver Breunig, Yoichi Ando, Jens Brede
Abstract: Nanofabrication of topological insulator (TI) devices is essential for accessing edge and interface states, but conventional lithography and etching compromise the atomically clean surfaces required for scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/STS). We demonstrate a fabrication strategy that combines ex situ lithographic patterning with in situ ultrahigh-vacuum cleaving and flipping, yielding atomically clean, nanopatterned TI-superconductor heterostructures suitable for STM/STS. In Design I, nanoribbons were defined by etching trenches into a TI film and capping with Nb. This enabled spectroscopy on large areas, although edge quality was limited by etch debris. In Design II, local thinning defined buried nanoribbons within a continuous TI film, producing pristine planar surfaces. STM/STS revealed well-developed superconducting gaps in the surrounding film, with suppressed gaps on the nanoribbons, consistent with vertical proximity coupling. This approach establishes a reproducible pathway for high-resolution STM/STS studies of proximitized nanostructures, providing a scalable platform for exploring topological superconductivity.

Title: Thermal transport and the impact of hydrogen adsorption in Linde Type A zeolitic imidazolate frameworks
Authors: Hyunseok Oh, Taeyong Kim
Abstract: Thermal transport in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) is of practical interest in diverse applications such as gas storage and separations, since insufficient heat dissipation can lead to detrimental effects. Despite investigations, influence of molecular infiltration on the heat transport remains unclear in many of MOFs due to poor understanding of mechanisms governing heat conductions. Here, we report molecular dynamics investigations of thermal transport properties in zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs). We investigated Linde Type A topological ZIFs (ZIF-lta) exhibiting exceptionally low thermal conductivity with unusual trend of temperature dependence deviating from many crystalline materials, despite long-range crystalline order in them. We demonstrate that heat is predominantly carried by phonons with mean free paths comparable to their wavelengths, analogous to diffusons in amorphous solids owing to strong anharmonicity caused by complexity of unit cell consisting of a large number of metal centers. We further show that adsorbed hydrogen molecules increase thermal conductivity of ZIFs, mainly contributed by additional vibrational modes, as a result of gas-gas or gas-framework interactions. Our work advances fundamental understanding into the thermal transport in MOFs and suggests a means to engineer heat conduction via gas infiltrations.

Title: A Non-Local Orientation Field Phase-Field Model for Misorientation- and Inclination- Dependent Grain Boundaries
Authors: Xiao Han, Axel van de Walle
Abstract: We propose to incorporate grain boundary (GB) anisotropy in phase-field modeling by extending the standard partial differential equations formulation to include a non-local functional of an orientation field. Regardless of the number of grains in the simulation, the model uses a single orientation field and incorporates grain misorientation and inclination information obtained from sampling the orientation field at optimized locations in the vicinity of the grain boundary. The formalism enables simple and precise tuning of GB energy anisotropy while avoiding an extensive fitting procedure. The functional includes an explicit GB anisotropy function to control the GB energy as a function of both misorientation and inclination. The model is validated by reproducing the linear grain growth rate, Wulff shapes with varying misorientations and anisotropic coefficients, and analytical equilibrium dihedral angles at triple junctions. Polycrystalline simulations demonstrate grain growth, coalescence, triple junction behavior, and the influence of anisotropy on grain morphology.

Title: SO(n) Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki states as conformal boundary states of integrable SU(n) spin chains
Authors: Yueshui Zhang, Ying-Hai Wu, Meng Cheng, Hong-Hao Tu
Abstract: We construct a class of conformal boundary states in the $\mathrm{SU}(n)_1$ Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) conformal field theory (CFT) using the symmetry embedding $\mathrm{Spin}(n)_2 \subset \mathrm{SU}(n)_1$. These boundary states are beyond the standard Cardy construction and possess $\mathrm{SO}(n)$ symmetry. The $\mathrm{SU}(n)$ Uimin-Lai-Sutherland (ULS) spin chains, which realize the $\mathrm{SU}(n)_1$ WZW model on the lattice, allow us to identify these boundary states as the ground states of the $\mathrm{SO}(n)$ Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki spin chains. Using the integrability of the $\mathrm{SU}(n)$ ULS model, we analytically compute the corresponding Affleck-Ludwig boundary entropy using exact overlap formulas. Our results unveil intriguing connections between exotic boundary states in CFT and integrable lattice models, thus providing deep insights into the interplay of symmetry, integrability, and boundary critical phenomena.

Title: Role of electron-electron interactions in $M$-valley twisted transition metal dichalcogenides
Authors: Christophe De Beule, Liangtao Peng, E. J. Mele, Shaffique Adam
Abstract: We investigate the role of long-range Coulomb interactions in $M$-valley moirés using the self-consistent Hartree-Fock approximation. This platform was recently proposed [Nature 643, 376 (2025) and arXiv:2411.18828 (2024)] as a new class of experimentally realizable moiré materials using twisted transition metal dichalcogenides homobilayers with the 1T structure. While these seminal studies considered the noninteracting theory without an electric displacement field, this work shows that both electron-electron interactions at finite doping and an interlayer bias strongly modify the moiré bands. For small twists ($\lesssim 5^\circ$) the density of states versus filling and interlayer bias displays qualitatively different behavior for twisting near aligned ($0^\circ$) and antialigned ($60^\circ$) stacking with tunable Van Hove singularities (VHSs). Moreover, interactions pin the VHS to the Fermi energy over a finite range of doping both at zero and finite bias depending on the stacking type, an effect known to enhance both superconductivity and strongly correlated states. At half filling, we obtain the phase diagram as a function of interaction strength, interlayer bias, and twist angle. We find a competition driven by band mixing between an isotropic ferromagnet and an antiferromagnet that are nearly degenerate over a wide range of experimentally accessible parameters. Our work demonstrates that correlated states in $M$-valley 1T tTMDs can be strongly tuned in situ both by applying an electric displacement field and by electron doping.

Title: Constrained Random Phase Approximation: the spectral method
Authors: Merzuk Kaltak, Alexander Hampel, Martin Schlipf, Indukuru Ramesh Reddy, Bongjae Kim, Georg Kresse
Abstract: We present a constrained Random Phase Approximation (cRPA) method, termed spectral cRPA (s-cRPA), and compare it to established cRPA approaches for Scandium and Copper by varying the 3d shell filling. The s-cRPA method generally produces larger Hubbard U interaction values compared to conventional approaches. When applied to the realistic system CaFeO$_3$ , s-cRPA yields interaction parameters that align more closely with those required within DFT+U to reproduce the experimentally observed insulating state, addressing the metallic behaviour predicted by standard density functionals. We examine the issue of negative interaction values encountered in the projec- tor cRPA method for filled d-shells. We show that s-cRPA provides improved numerical stability by preserving electron number conservation, a constraint that is violated in the projector cRPA method. The s-cRPA approach addresses some limitations of standard cRPA methods, particularly the tendency to underestimate U values, suggesting its potential utility for the community. Addi- tionally, we have enhanced our implementation to include computation of multi-centre interactions for analysing spatial decay and developed an efficient low-scaling variant employing a compressed Matsubara grid to obtain full frequency-dependent interactions.

Title: Classification of Magnetism and Altermagnetism in Quasicrystals
Authors: Zhi-Yan Shao, Chen Lu, Zhiming Pan, Yu-Bo Liu, Fan Yang
Abstract: Altermagnetism (AM), an unconventional magnetic phase characterized by zero net magnetism protected by symmetry(s) other than parity-time ($\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$) and a resulting spin-split band, has been studied exclusively in crystalline materials. Here, we extend the framework of AM to quasicrystals (QCs). We start from a comparison between the Néel state on the square lattice and that on a $D_4$-symmetric Thue-Morse QC, with both belonging to the same $d$-wave irreducible representation (IRRP) of the $D_4$ point group. Consequently, while the former is antiferromagnetism (AFM) protected by the combined $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$ and translational symmetry, the lack of translational symmetry in the latter breaks the $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$ symmetry, and the additional mirror or rotation symmetry protects AM. This example suggests that AM is more common in QCs than in crystals and can be easily explored through a point-group symmetry-based classification. Therefore, we classify magnetic phases in 2D $D_n$-symmetric QCs without spin-orbit coupling, by using IRRPs of $D_n$. Consequently, the identity IRRP represents ferromagnetism, the inversion-odd 1D IRRPs for twice-of-odd $n$ represent AFM, and all the remaining 1D IRRPs represent AM, protected by either mirror or rotation symmetry. We further take the Hubbard model to verify this result in various QCs with different symmetries. Our work highlights the QC as a natural platform where AM is common among magnetic phases.

Title: Transitioning from Silicon to Carbon Nanotube based transistors
Authors: Suhas Suresh Bharadwaj, Reuben Thomas Thovelil, Rohith Chembattammal, Sradha Mishra, Sunit Sahoo, Himnish Dave, Karthik S., Kabir Jaisinghani
Abstract: Carbon Nanotubes have shown to be an attractive option in the race to find a replacement to silicon-based transistors, due to its high electrical conductivity, extraordinary mechanical strength, and thermal conductivity. However, challenges with regards to controlling the purity and chirality of CNTs have raised doubts if the mass production of these transistors are even viable. This paper explores the challenges of scalability and proposes methods such as Liquid and Gas phase oxidative methods and microwave heating to tackle the problem of metal impurities found within CNTs and the methods of Catalyst Engineering and Chemical Vapor Deposition to control the chirality of CNTs. It also suggests techniques such as Lithography, Screen Printing and Stack Engineering to facilitate the large-scale production of CNT transistors. This paper also attempts to explore the methods of Laser Ablation and Arc Discharge that allows for the synthesis of CNTs of pure quality and high yield further facilitating the rise of mass production of CNT transistors. The feasibility and challenges relating to the integration of CNT transistors with already pre-existing circuitry was also investigated and the methods of annealing and potassium doping were studied and analyzed. The main aim of this paper is providing a comprehensive guide to allow for the mass production and rapid integration of CNT transistors into the semi-conductor market.

Title: Giant Splitting of Folded Dirac Bands in Kekulé-ordered Graphene with Eu Intercalation
Authors: Xiaodong Qiu, Tongshuai Zhu, Zhenjie Fan, Kaili Wang, Yuyang Mu, Bin Yang, Di Wu, Haijun Zhang, Can Wang, Huaiqiang Wang, Yi Zhang
Abstract: Kekulé-ordered graphene on SiC realized by intercalating two-dimensional metal layers offers a versatile platform for exploring intriguing quantum states and phenomena. Here, we achieve the intercalation of $(\mathrm{\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}})\mathit{R}30^\circ$-ordered Eu layer between epitaxial graphene and SiC substrate, realizing a Kekulé graphene with large local magnetic moments of intercalated Eu atoms. Combining angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we revealed that the Kekul{é} order folds the Dirac cones of graphene from the corners to the Brillouin zone center via intervalley scattering, forming the replica Dirac bands with gap opening. More intriguingly, the Dirac fermions in the replica Dirac bands show a strong exchange coupling with the localized magnetic moments of Eu $4f$ orbitals, resulting in a giant splitting of the folded Dirac bands. The observation of strong coupling between Dirac fermions and local magnetic moments of Eu $4f$ electrons via Kekulé order pave a new way for generating Dirac band splitting in graphene, advancing the potential applications of Kekulé-ordered graphene in spintronics, as well as exploring intriguing physical properties and correlation states for quantum technology.

Title: Exact large deviations and emergent long-range correlations in sequential quantum East circuits
Authors: Jimin Li, Bruno Bertini, Juan P. Garrahan, Robert L. Jack
Abstract: Exploiting quantum measurements is a promising route for preparation of correlated quantum states. We use methods from large deviation theory to solve this problem exactly for a specific system: the deterministic quantum East circuit with boundary measurements. We show that conditioning on measurement outcomes generates a long-range correlated state, despite typical trajectories being trivial. We derive the channel that optimally realizes the rare measurement trajectories, and establish a formal connection with the Petz recovery (time-reversal) map. We compute one- and two-point correlation functions in the conditioned state, revealing finite two-body correlations at arbitrarily large separations, and an underlying fractal structure, related to the Sierpiński triangle. These results demonstrate explicitly how boundary measurements can be used to control bulk properties of a quantum system.

Title: Improving the efficiency of finite-time memory erasure with potential barrier shaping
Authors: Vipul Rai, Moupriya Das
Abstract: Erasure of the binary memory, 0 or 1, is an essential step for digital computation as it involves irreversible logic operations. In the classical case, the erasure of a bit of memory is accompanied by the evolution of a minimum amount of heat set by the Landauer bound kTln2, which can be achieved in the asymptotic limit. However, the erasure of memory needs to be completed within a finite time for practical and effective computational processes. It is observed that the higher the speed of erasure, the greater the amount of heat released, which leads to unfavorable environmental conditions. Therefore, this is a fundamental challenge to reduce the evolved heat related to finite-time memory erasure. In the present work, we address this crucial aspect in the field of information thermodynamics, where the two memory states correspond to the two wells of a bistable potential, as in the conventional cases. However, the potential is asymmetric in terms of the width of the two wells. Moreover, the two memory states are separated by a barrier that is asymmetric in structure. We examine in detail the effect of the degree of asymmetry on the success rate of the erasure process and the work done or heat released associated with it. We find that the asymmetry in the potential barrier partitioning the two memory states plays a very significant role in improving the efficiency of the erasure process, in view of the success rate and the thermodynamic costs. We retrieve the approach towards the Landauer limit in terms of the energetics involved with the erasure mechanism under the symmetric setup.

Title: The self-assembly behavior of a diblock copolymer/homopolymer induced by Janus nanorods
Authors: Y. Q. Guo, J. Liu, H. R. He, N. Wu, J. J. Zhang
Abstract: We employ cell dynamics simulation based on the CH/BD model to investigate the self-assembly behavior of a mixed system consisting of diblock copolymers (AB), homopolymers (C), and Janus nanorods. The results indicate that, at different component ratios, the mixed system undergoes various phase transitions with an increasing number of nanorods. Specifically, when the homopolymer component is 0.40, the mixed system transitions from a disordered structure to a parallel lamellar structure, subsequently to a tilted layered structure, and ultimately to a perpendicular lamellar structure as the number of nanorods increases. To explore this phenomenon in greater depth, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of domain sizes and pattern evolution. Additionally, we investigate the effects of the repulsive interaction strength between polymers, wetting strength, length of nanorods, and degree of asymmetry on the self-assembly behavior of the mixed system. This research provides significant theoretical and experimental insights for the preparation of novel nanomaterials.

Title: Algebraic solution and thermodynamic properties of graphene in the presence of minimal length
Authors: J. Gbètoho, F. A. Dossa, G. Y. H. Avossevou
Abstract: Graphene is a zero-gap semiconductor, where the electrons propagating inside are described by the ultra-relativistic Dirac equation normally reserved for very high energy massless particles. In this work, we show that graphene under a magnetic field in the presence of a minimal length has a hidden $su(1,1)$ symmetry. This symmetry allows us to construct the spectrum algebraically. In fact, a generalized uncertainty relation, leading to a non-zero minimum uncertainty on the position, would be closer to physical reality and allow us to control or create bound states in graphene. Using the partition function based on the Epstein zeta function, the thermodynamic properties are well determined. We find that the Dulong-Petit law is verified and the heat capacity is independent of the deformation parameter.

Title: Thermodynamic relation for the systems with inhomogeneous distribution of particles
Authors: A. P. Rebesh, B. I. Lev, A. G. Zagorodny
Abstract: For the system with inhomogeneous distribution of macroscopic parameters we obtain thermodynamic relation which depends on the spatial point (coordinate). In our approach, to obtain such a relation we use the basic ideas of the method of nonequilibrium statistical operator combined with the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation. First of all, we define the thermodynamic relation for the system with homogeneous distribution of particles. Possible behavior peculiarities of systems with different character of interaction in nonequilibrium case are predicted. By saddle-point method we find the dominant contributions to the partition function and obtain all thermodynamic parameters of the systems with different character of interaction. The formations of saddle state in all systems of interacting particles at different temperatures and particle distributions have the same physical nature and therefore they can be described in the same way. We consider the systems with attractive and repulsive interactions as well as self-gravitating systems.

Title: Beyond conventional half-metals: gapless states and spin gapless semiconducting behavior in X$_2$MnGa (X = Ti, Ir) Heusler compounds
Authors: N. Bouteldja, N. Hacini, I. Ouadha, H. Rached
Abstract: The search for high-performance spintronic materials motivates the exploration of Heusler alloys with unconventional electronic properties. Using density functional theory with Hubbard correction (DFT+$U$, $U = 4$ eV), we investigate X$_2$MnGa (X = Ti, Ir) alloys, which stabilize in the ferromagnetic L2$_1$-type structure with strong thermodynamic stability. Electronic structure calculations reveal contrasting behaviors: Ti$_2$MnGa transitions from a metallic L2$_1$-type phase to a spin gapless semiconductor (SGS) in the XA-type, while Ir$_2$MnGa exhibits gapless half-metallicity behavior in the L2$_1$-type but becomes half-metallic in the XA-type. The magnetic properties are governed by spd hybridization between Mn-3$d$ and X-$d$/Ga-$p$ states, which stabilizes ferromagnetism and tailors electronic states near the Fermi level. The Hubbard $U$ correction proves essential for accurately describing the correlated Mn-3$d$ electrons. These alloys combine structural stability with tunable electronic and magnetic properties, offering a promising platform for spin-polarized transport in next-generation spintronic devices.

Title: Origin of Reverse Size Effect in Ferroelectric Hafnia Thin Films
Authors: Tianyuan Zhu, Shi Liu
Abstract: The persistence of ferroelectricity in ultrathin HfO$_2$ films challenges conventional theories, particularly given the paradoxical observation that the out-of-plane lattice spacing increases with decreasing thickness. We resolve this puzzle by revealing that this anomalous lattice expansion is counterintuitively coupled to suppressed out-of-plane polarization. First-principles calculations combined with analytical modeling identify two mechanisms behind this expansion: a negative longitudinal piezoelectric response to the residual depolarization field and a positive surface stress that becomes significant at reduced thickness. Their interplay quantitatively reproduces the experimentally observed lattice expansion. Furthermore, (111)-oriented HfO$_2$ films can support out-of-plane polarization even under open-circuit conditions, in contrast to (001) films that stabilize a nonpolar ground state. This behavior points to the emergence of orientation-induced hyperferroelectricity, an unrecognized mechanism that enables polarization persistence through orientation engineering without electrode screening. The principle also extends to perovskite ferroelectrics such as PbTiO$_3$, offering a strategy to eliminate critical thickness limits by selecting appropriate film orientations. As a practical pathway to device integration, we also identify the two-dimensional electride Ca$_2$N as a near-ideal electrode that fully restores the ferroelectric properties of HfO$_2$ in ultrathin capacitors.

Title: Phase stability and structural properties of the K$_{x}$Ca$_{1-x}$N novel ferromagnetic alloy from first-principles
Authors: K. Larbaoui, A. Lakdja, G. Bassou
Abstract: We study the structural properties and phase stability of the K$_{x}$Ca$_{1-x}$N alloy using the regular-solution model based on the total energy of the mixing. The pseudopotential approach was used along with PBE functional of Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE). We investigated the bond-lengths distribution as a function of composition $x$. We also predicted the phase separation of the two partially miscible components and calculated the enthalpy $\Delta H$ using the interaction parameter $\Omega$. We observe an asymmetry about $x=0.46$ in the phase diagram due to the $x$-dependant interaction parameter $\Omega=12.69-1.32x$ kcal/mole. The equilibrium solubility limit, known as the miscibility gap is found to be around 3033 K.

Title: The influence of dimensional crossover on phase transitions and critical phenomena in condensed systems
Authors: O. V. Chalyi, E. V. Zaitseva
Abstract: This article is aimed at studying the effects of the dimensional crossover (DC) on physical properties of condensed systems near phase transition and critical points. Here we consider the following problems: (1) the theoretical provisions that allow to study the effect of spatial confinement on DC near phase transition and critical points; (2) the study of DC in condensed systems with the Ginzburg number $\mathrm{Gi} <1$, where fluctuation effects are described in different ways at the fluctuation, regular and intermediate (crossover) regions; (3) two types of DC were investigated: (a) a decrease in the linear dimensions $L$ to the values of the correlation length of the order parameter fluctuations leads to the conversion of the dependence on thermodynamic variable into a dependence on linear sizes of 3D systems, as well as (b) a further decrease in linear sizes $L$ the 3D-2D or 3D-1D DC happens depending on slitlike or cylindrical geometry, which is determined by the value of the lower crossover dimensionality $d_{\rm LCD}$; (4) it is proposed to extend the known equalities for critical exponents by using the Mandelbrot formula for fractal dimension $D_f$ as a critical exponent; (5) the influence of 3D-2D DC on the characteristics of the fine structure of the molecular light scattering (MLS) spectrum is studied.

Title: Zero-energy resonances in ultracold hydrogen sticking to liquid helium films of finite thickness
Authors: R. Karakhanyan, A. Voronin, V. Nesvizhevsky, A. Semakin, S. Vasiliev
Abstract: We investigated quantum states of ultracold hydrogen atoms in a combined potential comprising the H-He film interaction in the presence of a substrate and the Earth gravitational field. We show that the shift and width of the gravitational quantum states are determined by the complex scattering length for the H-He film-substrate potential. We demonstrate that for specific helium film thicknesses above a substrate, zero-energy resonances occur if the combined potential supports a bound state exactly at the threshold. This effect leads to a complete restructuring of the bound states spectrum. The dynamics of gravitational levels as a function of the van der Waals interaction depth controlled by the helium film thickness is analyzed. It reveals the critical thicknesses at about 6.1 and 1.8 nm, at which resonances appear in the case of the conductive substrate. With imaginary integral operators, we incorporate non-perturbatively the inelastic effects originating from the ripplon coupling. The inelastic effects show dramatic changes in the sticking-coefficient behavior near the critical points. The enhanced sticking coefficients provide a probe for studying critical phenomena and measuring atom-surface interaction parameters with unprecedented sensitivity.

Title: A causality-based divide-and-conquer algorithm for nonequilibrium Green's function calculations with quantics tensor trains
Authors: Ken Inayoshi, Maksymilian Środa, Anna Kauch, Philipp Werner, Hiroshi Shinaoka
Abstract: We propose a causality-based divide-and-conquer algorithm for nonequilibrium Green's function calculations with quantics tensor trains. This algorithm enables stable and efficient extensions of the simulated time domain by exploiting the causality of Green's functions. We apply this approach within the framework of nonequilibrium dynamical mean-field theory to the simulation of quench dynamics in symmetry-broken phases, where long-time simulations are often required to capture slow relaxation dynamics. We demonstrate that our algorithm allows to extend the simulated time domain without a significant increase in the cost of storing the Green's function.

Title: Accurate measurement of energy relaxation via flux-flow instability
Authors: E. M. Baeva, N. A. Titova, M. A. Kirsanova, S.A. Evlashin, A. V. Semenov, D. Yu. Vodolazov, A. I. Kolbatova, G.N. Goltsman
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate flux-flow instability (FFI) in a superconducting single-crystal titanium nitride (TiN) film with negligible volume pinning. By studying the critical current density in 12-nm thick TiN strips of varying widths, we accurately identify the experimental parameters at which the FFI regime occurs. A comprehensive analysis of critical velocity measurements allows us to determine the quasiparticle energy relaxation time, $\tau_E$. By comparing our results with the $\tau_E$ values obtained from other experimental methods, we gain insight into the dominant microscopic process that governs quasiparticle relaxation within the vortex core in TiN. This mechanism is driven by an increase in quasiparticle temperature relative to phonons, rather than by quasiparticles leaving the core. Our findings indicate that $\tau_E$ can be accurately determined through FFI measurements.

Title: Interpretable Nanoporous Materials Design with Symmetry-Aware Networks
Authors: Zhenhao Zhou, Salman Bin Kashif, Jin-Hu Dou, Chris Wolverton, Kaihang Shi, Tao Deng, Zhenpeng Yao
Abstract: Nanoporous materials hold promise for diverse sustainable applications, yet their vast chemical space poses challenges for efficient design. Machine learning offers a compelling pathway to accelerate the exploration, but existing models lack either interpretability or fidelity for elucidating the correlation between crystal geometry and property. Here, we report a three-dimensional periodic space sampling method that decomposes large nanoporous structures into local geometrical sites for combined property prediction and site-wise contribution quantification. Trained with a constructed database and retrieved datasets, our model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and data efficiency for property prediction on gas storage, separation, and electrical conduction. Meanwhile, this approach enables the interpretation of the prediction and allows for accurate identification of significant local sites for targeted properties. Through identifying transferable high-performance sites across diverse nanoporous frameworks, our model paves the way for interpretable, symmetry-aware nanoporous materials design, which is extensible to other materials, like molecular crystals and beyond.

Title: Symplectic Quantization: numerical results for the Feynman propagator on a 1+1 lattice and the theoretical relation with Quantum Field Theory
Authors: Martina Giachello, Francesco Scardino, Giacomo Gradenigo
Abstract: We present here the first lattice simulation of symplectic quantization, a new functional approach to quantum field theory which allows to define an algorithm to numerically sample the quantum fluctuations of fields directly in Minkowski space-time, at variance with all other present approaches. Symplectic quantization is characterized by a Hamiltonian deterministic dynamics evolving with respect to an additional time parameter $\tau$ analogous to the fictious time of stochastic quantization. The difference between stochastic quantization and the present approach is that the former is well defined only for Euclidean field theories, while the latter allows to sample the causal structure of space-time. In this work we present the numerical study of a real scalar field theory on a 1+1 space-time lattice with a $\lambda\phi^4$ interaction. We find that for $\lambda\ll1$ the two-point correlation function obtained numerically reproduces qualitatively well the shape of the free Feynman propagator. Within symplectic quantization the expectation values over quantum fluctuations are computed as dynamical averages along the dynamics in $\tau$, in force of a natural ergodic hypothesis connecting Hamiltonian dynamics with a generalized microcanonical ensemble. Analytically, we prove that this microcanonical ensemble, in the continuum limit, is equivalent to a canonical-like one where the probability density of field configurations is $P[\phi]\propto\exp(zS[\phi]/\hbar)$. The results from our simulations correspond to the value $z=1$ of the parameter in the canonical weight, which in this case is a well-defined probability density for field configurations in causal space-time, provided that a lower bounded interaction potential is considered. The form proposed for $P[\phi]$ suggests that our theory can be connected to ordinary quantum field theory by analytic continuation in the complex-$z$ plane.

Title: Isothermal spheres from grand partition functions in nonextensive statistical mechanics
Authors: Nahomi Kan, Takuya Maki, Kiyoshi Shiraishi
Abstract: We analytically study isothermal spheres in the light of nonextensive statistical mechanics. The equations for the isothermal spheres are derived from the grand partition function of the gravitating particle system in the Tsallis statistical mechanics. The effect of nonextensive statistics appears in relatively dense state, which appears at the center of the isothermal sphere. The stability of the isothermal sphere in the general relativistic system is found to be sensitive to the parameter q in the Tsallis statistics.

Title: Thermal response of the Nieh-Yan term
Authors: Carlos Hoyos, Niko Jokela, José Manuel Penin
Abstract: We reinterpret the Nieh-Yan (NY) anomaly using holography, finding that the U(1) axial symmetry remains unbroken and the axial current coupling to an external gauge field is conserved. Instead, the anomaly arises from a breakdown of Hodge duality relations between fermion bilinears due to symmetry constraints on one-form currents. We show that the axial response associated with the NY term is distinct from the chiral vortical effect and exhibits a characteristic $T^2$ dependence. Torsion-induced axial transport decouples spin and axial charge dynamics, thereby clarifying the physical significance of the NY anomaly and motivating further field-theoretic and holographic studies.

Title: Local fermion-to-qudit mappings: a practical recipe for four-level systems
Authors: Rodolfo Carobene, Stefano Barison, Andrea Giachero, Jannes Nys
Abstract: In this paper, we present a new set of local fermion-to-qudit mappings for simulating fermionic lattice systems. We focus on the use of multi-level qudits, specifically ququarts. Traditional mappings, such as the Jordan-Wigner transformation (JWT), while useful, often result in non-local operators that scale unfavorably with system size. To address these challenges, we introduce mappings that efficiently localize fermionic operators on qudits, reducing the non-locality and operator weights associated with JWT. We propose one mapping for spinless fermions and two mappings for spinful fermions, comparing their performance in terms of qudit-weight, circuit depth, and gate complexity. By leveraging the extended local Hilbert space of qudits, we show that these mappings enable more efficient quantum simulations in terms of two-qudit gates, reducing hardware requirements without increasing computational complexity. We validate our approach by simulating prototypical models such as the spinless t-V model and the Fermi-Hubbard model in two dimensions, using Trotterized time evolution. Our results highlight the potential of qudit-based quantum simulations in achieving scalability and efficiency for fermionic systems on near-term quantum devices.

Title: Rapid optimal work extraction from a quantum-dot information engine
Authors: Kushagra Aggarwal, Alberto Rolandi, Yikai Yang, Joseph Hickie, Daniel Jirovec, Andrea Ballabio, Daniel Chrastina, Giovanni Isella, Mark T. Mitchison, Martí Perarnau-Llobet, Natalia Ares
Abstract: The conversion of thermal energy into work is usually more efficient in the slow-driving regime, where the power output is vanishingly small. Efficient work extraction for fast driving protocols remains an outstanding challenge at the nanoscale, where fluctuations play a significant role. In this Letter, we use a quantum-dot Szilard engine to extract work from thermal fluctuations with maximum efficiency over two decades of driving speed. We design and implement a family of optimised protocols ranging from the slow- to the fast-driving regime, and measure the engine's efficiency as well as the mean and variance of its power output in each case. These optimised protocols exhibit significant improvements in power and efficiency compared to the naive approach. Our results also show that, when optimising for efficiency, boosting the power output of a Szilard engine inevitably comes at the cost of increased power fluctuations.

Title: A topological theory for qLDPC: non-Clifford gates and magic state fountain on homological product codes with constant rate and beyond the $N^{1/3}$ distance barrier
Authors: Guanyu Zhu
Abstract: We develop a topological theory for fault-tolerant quantum computation in quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes. We show that there exist hidden simplicial or CW complex structures encoding the topological data for all qLDPC and CSS codes obtained from product construction by generalizing the Freedman-Hastings code-to-manifold mapping. This is achieved by building manifolds from the Tanner graphs of the skeleton classical or quantum codes, which further form a product manifold and an associated thickened product code defined on its triangulation. One can further deformation retract the manifold back to a CW complex which supports a non-topological code with minimal overhead suitable for near-term implementation. Both types of codes admit cohomology operations including cup product which can induce non-Clifford gates. When applying this mapping to a 3D hypergraph product code obtained from the product of 3 copies of good classical expander codes, we obtain non-Clifford logical CCZ gates via constant depth circuits on a code with constant stabilizer weight $w=O(1)$, constant rate $K=\Theta(N)$, and polynomial distance $D=\Omega(N^{1/3})$. When applied to logical CCZ on 3D homological product codes consisting of the product of a pair of good quantum and classical LDPC codes, we can further improve the distance to $D=\Omega(\sqrt{N})$ exceeding the $N^{1/3}$ distance barrier implied by the Bravyi-König bound for conventional topological codes with the aid of non-Euclidean geometries. Our work suggests that it is feasible to apply native logical non-Clifford gates on qLDPC codes or directly inject high-fidelity magic states as resources ('magic state fountain') without the distillation process. For the homological product construction, the fountain can inject $\Theta(\sqrt{N})$ magic states in parallel in a single round.

Title: Twin-Polaritons: Classical versus Quantum Features in Polaritonic Spectra
Authors: Iren Simko, Norah M. Hoffmann
Abstract: Understanding whether a polaritonic phenomenon is fundamentally quantum or classical is essential for building accurate theoretical models and guiding experimental design. Here, we address this question in the context of polaritonic spectra, and report an intriguing new feature: the twin-polariton, an additional splitting beyond the primary resonant polariton splitting, originating from vacuum field fluctuations. We show that the twin-polariton persists in the many-molecule limit under permutationally symmetrical initial-state constraint and that it follows the same linear dependence on coupling strength as the primary polariton splitting. This establishes a novel mechanism by which a quantum feature (the twin-polariton) can be tuned through a classical one (the primary polariton), offering new opportunities to probe and control the fundamental nature of polaritonic systems.

Title: Universal Dynamics with Globally Controlled Analog Quantum Simulators
Authors: Hong-Ye Hu, Abigail McClain Gomez, Liyuan Chen, Aaron Trowbridge, Andy J. Goldschmidt, Zachary Manchester, Frederic T. Chong, Arthur Jaffe, Susanne F. Yelin
Abstract: Analog quantum simulators with global control fields have emerged as powerful platforms for exploring complex quantum phenomena. Recent breakthroughs, such as the coherent control of thousands of atoms, highlight the growing potential for quantum applications at scale. Despite these advances, a fundamental theoretical question remains unresolved: to what extent can such systems realize universal quantum dynamics under global control? Here we establish a necessary and sufficient condition for universal quantum computation using only global pulse control, proving that a broad class of analog quantum simulators is, in fact, universal. We further extend this framework to fermionic and bosonic systems, including modern platforms such as ultracold atoms in optical superlattices. Crucially, to connect the theoretical possibility with experimental reality, we introduce a new control technique into the experiment - direct quantum optimal control. This method enables the synthesis of complex effective Hamiltonians and allows us to incorporate realistic hardware constraints. To show its practical power, we experimentally engineer three-body interactions outside the blockade regime and demonstrate topological dynamics on a Rydberg atom array. Using the new control framework, we overcome key experimental challenges, including hardware limitations and atom position fluctuations in the non-blockade regime, by identifying smooth, short-duration pulses that achieve high-fidelity dynamics. Experimental measurements reveal dynamical signatures of symmetry-protected-topological edge modes, confirming both the expressivity and feasibility of our approach. Our work opens a new avenue for quantum simulation beyond native hardware Hamiltonians, enabling the engineering of effective multi-body interactions and advancing the frontier of quantum information processing with globally-controlled analog platforms.

Title: Optimal Finite-Time Thermodynamics of Effective Two-Level Systems
Authors: Alberto Rolandi
Abstract: The optimization of the conversion of thermal energy into work and the minimization of dissipation for nano- and mesoscopic systems is a complex challenge because of the important role fluctuations play on the dynamics of small systems. We generalize the work of Esposito et al. EPL 89, 20003 (2010) to optimize at all driving speeds the control needed to extract the maximum amount of work from any effective two-level systems. These emerge when one coarse-grains degrees of freedom, which is often unavoidable to obtain "real-world" two-level systems. In particular, we allow even for the system to have underlying quantum dynamics, as long as these allow for a coarse-graining that leads to a Markovian master equation. We analyze the finite-time thermodynamics of these systems and find the thermodynamically optimal protocols, which depend on the size of the coarse-graining needed to obtain a two-level system. Furthermore, we use these results to derive speed-limits for any transformation performed on an effective two-level system.

Title: Quantum Tomography of Suspended Carbon Nanotubes
Authors: Jialiang Chang, Nicholas Pietrzak, Cristian Staii
Abstract: We present an all-mechanical protocol for coherent control and full quantum-state reconstruction of the fundamental flexural mode of a suspended carbon nanotube (CNT). Calibrated impulses from a nearby atomic force microscope (AFM) tip serve a dual role: they implement mechanical pi/2 rotations for Ramsey interferometry and realize phase-space displacements for Wigner function tomography via displaced-parity sampling. The same actuator thus unifies control and tomography while avoiding optical heating and eliminating on-chip microwave drive lines at the resonator. We derive explicit control pulse sequences and a master-equation description that map measured signals onto the energy-relaxation and phase-coherence times, as well as onto parity-based quantum signatures, including negative regions of the Wigner function. The approach is compatible with several readout modalities: direct AFM deflection, dispersive coupling to a Cooper-pair box, and dispersive microwave cavity probing. Together, these techniques provide complete access to populations, coherence, and parity within a single device architecture. This minimal scheme provides a practical route to all-mechanical quantum control and state-resolved characterization of decoherence in mesoscopic mechanical systems.

Title: Response of a classical mesoscopic oscillator to a two-level quantum system
Authors: Felipe Sobrero, Luca Abrahão, Thiago Guerreiro, Pedro V. Paraguassú
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of a classical mechanical oscillator coupled to the simplest quantum system, a single qubit. The qubit's influence manifests as deterministic and stochastic forces, highly dependent on its initial quantum state, imprinting unique measurable quantum-induced signatures onto the oscillator's response. The present results suggest a pathway to quantum state reconstruction through classical noise spectroscopy, with potential applications to mesoscopic optomechanical experiments, quantum metrology, and tabletop tests of the quantum nature of gravity.

Title: A scalable method for cavity-enhanced solid-state quantum sensors
Authors: Daniel J. Tibben, Roy Styles, David A. Broadway, Jean-Philippe Tetienne, Daniel E. Gómez, Philipp Reineck
Abstract: Photoluminescent color centers in diamond and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) are powerful nanoscale solid-state quantum sensors that are explored in a plethora of quantum technologies. Methods for integrating them into macroscopic structures that improve their sensitivity and enable their large-scale deployment are highly sought after. Here, we demonstrate cavity-enhanced photoluminescence (PL) of fluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs) and hBN nanoparticles (NPs) embedded in polymer-based thin-film optical cavities on the centimeter scale. The cavity resonances efficiently modulate the spectral PL peak position of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in FNDs across the NV PL spectrum and lead to an up to 2.9-fold Purcell-enhancement of the NV PL decay rate. The brightness of hBN NPs increases by up to a factor of three and the PL decay rate is enhanced by up to 13-fold inside the cavities. Finally, we find a 4.8 times improved magnetic field sensitivity of 20 nm FNDs in thin-film cavities due to cavity-enhanced optically detected magnetic resonance contrast and PL brightness. Our study demonstrates a low-cost and scalable method for the fabrication of quantum sensor-doped thin-film cavities, which is an important step toward the development of advanced quantum sensing technologies.

Title: On the role of water activity on the formation of a protein-rich coffee ring in an evaporating multicomponent drop
Authors: Javier Martínez-Puig, Gianluca D'Agostino, Ana Oña, Javier Rodríguez-Rodríguez
Abstract: The coffee-ring effect is a universal feature of evaporating sessile droplets with pinned contact line, wherein solutes or particles are advected to the droplet's edge due to evaporation-driven flows. While existing models have successfully described this phenomenon in particle-laden droplets, they often assume that hydrodynamics are decoupled from solute transport. This assumption breaks down in complex fluids, such as protein or polymeric solutions, where the solute can influence evaporation through changes in water activity. Here, we investigate model respiratory droplets primarily composed of water, salt, and a type of the glycoprotein mucin. Using fluorescence microscopy, we observe the formation of a well-defined protein ring at the droplet edge as water evaporates. The growth and morphology of this ring exhibit a strong dependence on ambient relative humidity ($H_r$), revealing dynamics that existing models cannot capture. Specifically, we find that protein accumulation at the edge is governed by the feedback between local solute concentration and evaporation rate. To account for this, we develop a minimal theoretical model based on the lubrication approximation, incorporating the coupling between hydrodynamics and solute transport through the evaporation rate. Our framework reproduces key features of the experimental observations and suggests a physical basis for the $H_r$-dependent stability and infectivity of respiratory droplets containing viruses.

Title: Stabilizer Rényi Entropy and its Transition in the Coupled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev Model
Authors: Pengfei Zhang, Shuyan Zhou, Ning Sun
Abstract: Quantum entanglement and quantum magic are two distinct fundamental resources that enable quantum systems to exhibit complex phenomena beyond the capabilities of classical computer simulations. While quantum entanglement has been extensively used to characterize both equilibrium and dynamical phases, the study of quantum magic, typically quantified by the stabilizer Rényi entropy (SRE), remains largely limited to numerical simulations of moderate system sizes. In this Letter, we establish a general framework for analyzing the SRE in solvable Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) models in the large-$N$ limit, which enables the application of the saddle-point approximation. Applying this method to the Maldacena-Qi coupled SYK model, we identify a series of first-order transitions of the SRE as the temperature is tuned. In particular, we uncover an intrinsic transition of the SRE that cannot be detected through thermodynamic quantities. We also discuss the theoretical understanding of the SRE in both the high-temperature and low-temperature limits. Our results pave the way for studying the SRE in strongly correlated fermionic systems in the thermodynamic limit and suggest a new class of transitions for which the SRE serves as an order parameter.
