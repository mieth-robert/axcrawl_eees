Title: Coexistence of superconductivity and excitonic pairing in a doped-biased double-layer system
Authors: V. Apinyan, M. Sahakyan
Abstract: The subject of the present study is the double-layer square-lattice system with the intralayer phonon modulations. We investigate the superconducting and excitonic pairings, as well as their coexistence, as functions of various physical parameters in the system. These parameters include temperature, intralayer and interlayer Coulomb interactions, the electron-phonon coupling parameter, doping and the applied electric field. The existence of superconductivity is demonstrated by considering the influence of intralayer phonons on the total charge density leading to the modification of the total energy of the electrons. Our results provides insights into the long-standing problem of the mechanism of superconductivity in high-$T_c$ cuprate superconductors.

Title: Quasiparticle Variational Quantum Eigensolver
Authors: Saavanth Velury, Yuxuan Wang
Abstract: We propose a momentum-space based variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) framework for simulating quasiparticle excitations in interacting quantum many-body systems on near-term quantum devices. Leveraging translational invariance and other symmetries of the Hamiltonian, we reconstruct the momentum-resolved quasiparticle excitation spectrum through targeted simulation of low-lying excited states using VQE. We construct a translationally symmetric variational ansatz designed to evolve a free-fermion particle-hole excited state with definite momentum $q$ to an excited state of the interacting system at the same momentum, employing a fermionic fast Fourier transform (FFFT) circuit coupled to a Hamiltonian Variational Ansatz (HVA) circuit. Even though the particle number is not explicitly conserved in the variational ansatz, the correct quasiparticle state is reached by energetic optimization. We benchmark the performance of the proposed VQE implementation on the XXZ Hamiltonian, which maps onto the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid in the fermionic representation. Our numerical results show that VQE can capture the low-lying excitation spectrum of the bosonic quasiparticle/two-spinon dispersion of this model at various interaction strengths. We estimate the renormalized velocity of the quasiparticles by calculating the slope of the dispersion near zero momentum using the VQE-optimized energies at different system sizes, and demonstrate that it closely matches theoretical results obtained from Bethe ansatz. Finally, we highlight extensions of our proposed VQE implementation to simulate quasiparticles in other interacting quantum many-body systems.

Title: Liouvillian topology and non-reciprocal dynamics in open Floquet chains
Authors: Florian Koch, Yu-Min Hu, Jan Carl Budich
Abstract: Open quantum systems far from thermal equilibrium can exhibit remarkable physical phenomena including topological properties without a direct equilibrium counterpart. Along these lines, in periodically driven dissipative systems within the effective non-Hermitian (NH) Hamiltonian approximation spectral winding numbers have been linked to intriguing nonreciprocal transport properties. Here, going beyond an NH Hamiltonian description, we introduce and study a microscopic lattice model of a driven open quantum system described by a Markovian quantum master equation, which exhibits the mentioned spectral winding within a NH approximation. By encompassing quantum jump processes in the topological analysis, we uncover a distinct \emph{jump-induced} topological phase, which qualitatively corresponds to the richer non-reciprocal transport properties of the fully quantum model. In addition, we find that the NH skin effect, i.e.~the accumulation of a macroscopic number of eigenstates at one end of the system, is already visible in the transient dynamics even for systems with periodic boundary conditions. Our results exemplify the subtle correspondence between NH topological properties and physical manifestations of Liouvillian topological properties in open quantum systems, thus providing a theoretical framework towards understanding unidirectional transport in quantum dissipative Floquet dynamics.

Title: Excited states from local effective Hamiltonians of matrix product states and their entanglement spectrum transition
Authors: Denise Cocchiarella, Mingru Yang, Yueshui Zhang, Mari Carmen Bañuls, Hong-Hao Tu, Yuhan Liu
Abstract: Solving excited states is a challenging task for interacting systems. For one-dimensional critical systems, however, excited states can be directly accessed from the eigenvectors of the local effective Hamiltonian that is constructed from the ground state obtained by variational matrix product state (MPS) optimization. Despite its numerical success, the theoretical mechanism underlying this method has remained largely unexplored. In this work, we provide a conformal field theory (CFT) perspective that helps elucidate this connection. The key insight is that this construction effectively uses a truncated basis of ground-state Schmidt vectors to represent excited states, where the contribution of each Schmidt vector can be expressed as a CFT correlation function and shown to decay with increasing Schmidt index. The CFT analysis further predicts an entanglement-spectrum transition of excited states as the ratio of the subsystem size to the total system size is varied. Our numerical results support this picture and demonstrate a reorganization of the entanglement spectrum into distinct conformal towers as this ratio changes.

Title: Landau-Lifshitz-Bloch simulations of the magnetocaloric effect in continuous ferromagnetic-paramagnetic transitions
Authors: Luis M. Moreno-Ramírez, Luis Sánchez-Tejerina, Óscar Alejos, Victorino Franco, Víctor Raposo
Abstract: The usefulness of modeling magnetocaloric materials expands from the understanding of their behavior to the prediction of new materials, playing a fundamental role in the optimization of their performance. In contrast with other areas of magnetic materials research, micromagnetic simulations of magnetocaloric materials are scarce due to the difficulty of modeling the material in the vicinity of the transition. To solve this limitation, we propose the use of micromagnetic simulations based on the Landau-Lifshitz-Bloch equation to study the magnetocaloric effect of a ferromagnetic material around its Curie transition. Following our proposed methodology, we obtain reliable isothermal entropy change curves for both monocrystalline and polycrystalline configurations, where we consider different anisotropic contributions. The robustness of the method was evaluated, yielding results that agreed with previous experimental and theoretical observations. Our study shows that micromagnetic simulations are a powerful tool for analyzing magnetocaloric materials with complex microstructures.

Title: Tungsten doping-induced phase transition in CVD-grown MoS2 bilayers
Authors: Ana Senkić, Rachael Keneipp, Petra Ivatović, Namrata Pradeep, Vincent Meunier, Marko Kralj, Marija Drndić, Nataša Vujičić
Abstract: Controlling the crystal phase of two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) is essential for tailoring their optical and electronic properties. While phase transitions in monolayer TMDs and semiconductor-to-metal conversions have been widely studied, structural transitions between semiconducting polytypes - particularly in bilayer (2L) systems - remain underexplored. Here, we demonstrate a W doping-induced phase transition from non-centrosymmetric AA stacking to centrosymmetric AB' in 2L MoS2 synthesized by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Using polarization-resolved second harmonic generation (SHG) and low-frequency Raman spectroscopy, we identify a phase transition correlated with increasing tungsten (W) concentration. The dilute W-doped 2L system exhibits a vanishing SHG signal and a stiffening of the layer-breathing (LB) vibrational mode, in contrast to undoped samples with strong SHG and a softer LB mode. Aberration corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (AC-STEM) demonstrates the spatial distribution of W concentration and associated structural changes. These findings highlight W-doping as an effective strategy for inducing phase transitions in 2L TMDs, opening new possibilities for engineered heterostructures, phase-controlled device applications or as a source of single photon emitters.

Title: Light-Induced Lattice Coherence and Emission Enhancement in PTM-Passivated CsSnI3 Perovskites
Authors: Thomas Y. Adams, Bruce Barrios, Michael Ziegenfus, Hui Cai, Sayantani Ghosh
Abstract: Metal halide perovskites continue to lead in optoelectronic applications, but the toxicity of lead has driven efforts to identify environmentally benign alternatives. Cesium tin iodide is one such, with a direct bandgap and near-infrared emission, though its performance is limited by instability. We show that phthalimide (PTM) passivation during single crystal growth enhances optical output and ambient stability. Under continuous excitation, PTM-passivated microscale crystals show up to a nearly one order of magnitude increase in photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield, accompanied by reversible sharpening of a low-frequency Raman mode associated with Cs rattling. This reveals dynamic, light-induced lattice reordering that passivates trap states and enhances radiative recombination. Mechanical grinding yields nanocrystals with redshifted, narrowed PL, consistent with a relaxed polymorph and reduced inhomogeneous broadening. Despite increased surface area, PTM remains effective in preserving near-infrared emission in nanocrystals as well. Power-dependent PL reveals distinct carrier dynamics, where microcrystals show redshift due to bandgap renormalization, while nanocrystals show blueshift and elevated carrier temperatures (300 to 1900 K), consistent with hot-carrier recombination. Extended illumination reveals reversible optical changes, including PL modulation, reflecting dynamic light-matter interactions and evolving defect landscapes. These results identify PTM-passivated Cesium tin iodide as an ideal platform for probing morphology-dependent carrier relaxation and light-induced vibrational coherence in lead-free perovskites.

Title: Fabrication of A Dual Gated Mirror Symmetric Twisted Trilayer Graphene Device to Study Superconductivity
Authors: Ahmed Shaikh, Phanibhusan Singha Mahapatra, Eva Y. Andrei
Abstract: Though research on graphene by itself has waned, the interest in moire materials, materials made with stacked layers of graphene with a rotational twist between the layers, has exploded in popularity. These layered devices show a key feature, flat bands. Flat bands localize electrons, which in turn leads to the expression of correlated states such as Mott insulators, superconductivity, and more. A key property of these devices is that their 2D nature allows us to tune them in situ, effectively allowing us to change the device's electronic properties. This powerful ability greatly reduces the time and money required to study superconductivity. The superconductivity in these systems seems to be similar to high-temperature superconductors such as cuprates, giving us a path towards studying high-temperature superconductivity. The fabrication of these devices is nontrivial, and thus we detail one general way to create these layered devices to give maximal tunability.

Title: Glass Viscosity Curvature from Constraint-Driven Actualization: A Physical Parity with the Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann Relation
Authors: Debra S. Gavant, Christian E. Precker
Abstract: The Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann (VFT) equation empirically describes the super-Arrhenius viscosity of glass-forming liquids; however, its divergence at a finite temperature $T_{0}$ lacks a clear physical basis. Here, a formulation derived from Dynamic Present Theory (DP$\Phi$) and its Continuous Present Actualization (CPA) framework is tested: a CPA Rate modulated by a temperature-dependent Constraint Load $C(T)$, the CPA + Constraint (CPA + C) model. This formulation was evaluated across three canonical datasets: ortho-terphenyl (OTP) measurements from Laughlin and Uhlmann (1972) and Plazek et al. (1994), and glycerol-water mixtures from Kumar et al. (1994). Across all evaluated systems, the CPA + C formulation demonstrated statistical parity with the VFT model ($R^{2} > 0.99$), reproducing the viscosity curve by more than 14 orders of magnitude. Unlike the VFT equation, this approach derives the nonlinear curvature from a physically interpretable mechanism: the increase in configurational constraint as the system approaches a CPA Lock-In threshold. These findings indicate that the residual noise observed in simpler models represents an actual physical signal, which the CPA + C model effectively isolates. This suggests that the VFT's empirical success originates from its implicit capture of an underlying constraint-driven dynamic, providing a physically interpretable foundation for one of the most enduring phenomenological equations in materials science.

Title: Reentrant Landau Levels in a Dirac topological insulator
Authors: C. Kaufmann Ribeiro, J. C. Mutch, Q. Jiang, J. P. Ayres-Sims, K. Rubi, C. A. Mizzi, E. A. Peterson, D. Bulmash, J. Singleton, N. Harrison, P. F. S. Rosa, J.-X. Zhu, J.-H. Chu, J. Larrea Jimenez, S. M. Thomas, J. C. Palmstrom
Abstract: The quantum limit, where magnetic fields confine carriers to the lowest Landau level, is predicted to host exotic quantum phases arising from strengthened electronic correlations, reduced dimensionality, and increased degeneracy. We report a novel quantization regime realized in the ultra-quantum limit of the narrow-gap Dirac insulator ZrTe5, marked by anomalous magnetoresistance oscillations. These oscillations, measured in ZrTe5 single crystals down to 700 mK and up to 60 T, are distinctly non-1/B periodic and persist for magnetic fields well beyond the quantum limit. In this regime, the competition between Zeeman and cyclotron energies drives a nonlinear evolution and back-bending of Landau levels, causing low-index levels to re-cross the Fermi energy at high fields. This mechanism departs from the standard Lifshitz-Kosevich description and provides a framework to describe how the electronic structure in topological Dirac insulators evolves beyond the quantum limit.

Title: Magnetic Properties of the Quasi-1D Magnesium Lanthanide Borates Mg$Ln$B$_5$O$_{10}$
Authors: Lachlan G. M. Rooney, Siân E. Dutton, Nicola D. Kelly
Abstract: Lanthanide borates are widely studied for their optical and magnetic properties. A wide variety of structures are known with 3, 2, 1 and 0 dimensional connectivity of lanthanide ions. Here, we explore Mg$Ln$B$_5$O$_{10}$, with a quasi-1D arrangement of the $Ln$ ions. Polycrystalline samples of Mg$Ln$B$_5$O$_{10}$ ($Ln$ = La, Pr, Nd, Sm--Er) were synthesised with high purity via a sol-gel method. Powder X-ray diffraction data confirmed the reported monoclinic space group ($P2_1/c$). The magnetic $Ln^{3+}$ ions in Mg$Ln$B$_5$O$_{10}$ form relatively isolated zig-zag chains parallel to the $b$ axis. Magnetic susceptibility and isothermal magnetisation were measured: all samples except $Ln=$ (Eu, Sm) fit the Curie-Weiss Law in isothermal magnetisation at high temperatures, in broad agreement with theoretical expectations. $Ln =$ (Nd, Tb, Dy, Ho) exhibit signatures characteristic of Ising spin saturation, implying single ion anisotropy, while Gd exhibits characteristics of Heisenberg spins. Estimation of magnetic interactions suggests that Mg$Ln$B$_5$O$_{10}$ are candidate materials for quasi-1D magnetism. The magnetocaloric entropy change was also calculated, with MgGdB$_5$O$_{10}$ showing promise for application to solid-state refrigeration at liquid helium temperatures.

Title: Breakdown of adiabaticity in topological quantum liquids
Authors: Carola Ciaramelletti, Daniel Arrufat-Vicente, Simone Paganelli, Nicolo Defenu
Abstract: We study the temporal behavior of topological quantum fluids with strong long-range couplings under slow external perturbations, whose rate $\delta$ approaches the quasi-static limit $\delta\to 0$. As expected, due to strong long-range interactions, the system lies in the mean-field universality and the density of defects for drives across the quantum critical point is adiabatic $n_{\rm exc}\propto \delta^{2}$. However, if the drive is instead terminated precisely at the edge of the topological non-trivial phase, the number of generated excitations becomes extensive $n_{\rm exc}\propto O(1)$. This result fundamentally breaks the established universal behavior observed in local topological quantum fluids and demonstrates a novel mechanism for the breakdown of adiabaticity in fermionic systems with strong long-range interactions.

Title: Glassy polymers' strain-hardening moduli scale with their statistical-segment volumes
Authors: Robert S. Hoy
Abstract: Using molecular dynamics simulations, we show that a widely-accepted theoretical prediction for glassy-polymeric strain hardening moduli ($G_R \propto \rho_e$, where $\rho_e$ is the entanglement density) fails badly for semiflexible polymers with $N_e \lesssim 4C_\infty$. By postulating that the length, energy and strain scales controlling $G_R$ are the Kuhn length $\ell_K$ and statistical segment length $b = \sqrt{\ell_0 \ell_K}$ (where $\ell_0$ is the backbone bond length), the intermonomer binding energy $u_0$, and the incremental elastic strain $S_{\rm c}$ required to activate Kuhn-segment-scale plastic rearrangements, we develop a scaling theory predicting that $G_R = S_{\rm c}(u_0/\ell_0^3) b^3$ in the athermal limit. This prediction agrees quantitatively (semi-quantitatively) with simulated $G_R$ values for both flexible and semiflexible polymer glasses subjected to athermal uniaxial-stress extension (constant-volume simple shear), over a range of $\ell_K/\ell_0$ that is wider than that spanned by real systems.

Title: Zero-temperature dynamics of the spherical model with non-reciprocal interactions
Authors: Daniel A. Stariolo (1), Fernando L. Metz (2) ((1) Universidade Federal Fluminense, Instituto de Física, 24210-346 Niterói, RJ, Brazil, (2) Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Instituto de Física, 91501-970 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil)
Abstract: We analytically solve the zero-temperature dynamics of the spherical model with non-reciprocal random interactions drawn from the real elliptic ensemble of random matrices, where a single parameter $\eta$ continuously interpolates between purely symmetric ($\eta=1$) and purely antisymmetric ($\eta=-1$) couplings. We show that the two-time correlation and response functions depend on both times in the presence of non-reciprocal interactions, reflecting the breakdown of time-translation invariance and the absence of equilibrium at long times. Nevertheless, the long-time relaxation of the two-time observables is governed by exponential decays, in contrast to the slow, power-law relaxation characteristic of the model with purely symmetric interactions. We further show that, when the interactions present antisymmetric correlations of strength $\eta <0$, there is a time scale $\tau(\eta)$ above which the dynamics undergoes a transition to an oscillatory regime where the two-time observables display periodic oscillations with an exponentially decaying amplitude. Overall, our results give a detailed account of the dynamics of the spherical model with non-reciprocal interactions at zero temperature, providing a benchmark for the study of complex systems with nonlinear and asymmetric interactions.

Title: Computer Simulation of Gel Formation in Colloidal Systems of Sticky Rods
Authors: Johannes Krotz
Abstract: We develop and validate a simulation framework for colloidal gelation. We first reproduce the benchmark results of Santos, Campanella, and Carignano for spherical, gel-forming particles, then extend the methodology to more complex systems of ``sticky'' spherocylindrical rods interacting via a Kihara-like potential. Using comprehensive parameter sweeps documented for reproducibility, we analyze the emergence of porous, percolating networks and conduct a topological characterization of the resulting microstructures. This characterization leverages Early TDA to extract multiscale connectivity features and to define topology-driven metrics for automated comparison between simulations and experiments. Our simulations reveal a clear dependence of network formation on rod aspect ratio and particle density, consistent with established theory and, to our knowledge, not previously demonstrated for spherocylindrical colloids with Kihara-type interactions. Rheological probing of the simulated systems shows signatures characteristic of gels, which supports the structural analysis. We further compare our computational results with experimental data obtained on Bastian Trepka's gels collected by Jacob Steindl. Although these first comparisons indicate that the present model is not yet sufficient to quantitatively describe those specific gelled systems, the agreement in qualitative trends and the robustness of our tools suggest strong potential. Overall, the work demonstrates functional, extensible methods for simulating gelation in rod-based colloids, provides topological data analysis based metrics that can aid automated comparison between experiments and simulations, and outlines several promising directions for future refinement and application.

Title: Accelerated Materials Discovery through Cost-Aware Bayesian Optimization of Real-World Indentation Workflows
Authors: Vivek Chawla, Stephen Puplampu, Haochen Zhu, Philip D. Rack, Dayakar Penumadu, Sergei Kalinin
Abstract: Accelerating the discovery of mechanical properties in combinatorial materials requires autonomous experimentation that accounts for both instrument behavior and experimental cost. Here, an automated nanoindentation (AE-NI) framework is developed and validated for adaptive mechanical mapping of combinatorial thin-film libraries. The method integrates heteroskedastic Gaussian-process modeling with cost-aware Bayesian optimization to dynamically select indentation locations and hold times, minimizing total testing time while preserving measurement accuracy. A detailed emulator and cost model capture the intrinsic penalties associated with lateral motion, drift stabilization, and reconfiguration-factors often neglected in conventional active-learning approaches. To prevent kernel-length-scale collapse caused by disparate time scales, a hierarchical meta-testing workflow combining local grid and global exploration is introduced. Implementation of the workflow is shown on a experimental Ta-Ti-Hf-Zr thin-film library. The proposed framework achieves nearly a thirty-fold improvement in property-mapping efficiency relative to grid-based indentation, demonstrating that incorporating cost and drift models into probabilistic planning substantially improves performance. This study establishes a generalizable strategy for optimizing experimental workflows in autonomous materials characterization and can be extended to other high-precision, drift-limited instruments.

Title: Energy-Dependent Magnetic Modifications in HOPG via Microbeam Scanning
Authors: Ram Kumar, Aditya H. Kelkar, Neeraj Shukla, Paras Poswal, Sheshmani Singh
Abstract: Medium-energy ion irradiation is a promising technique for inducing magnetism in materials with partially filled d or f electron bands. This approach enables precise control over the density and spatial distribution of irradiation-induced defects, which play a crucial role in modifying the electronic and magnetic properties of the system. The primary objective of this experiment was to investigate the influence of ion energy variation on the magnetic properties of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG). To achieve this, HOPG samples were irradiated with protons 1-3 MeV and carbon ions 600 keV - 2 MeV. A significant change in the magnetic moment was observed with respect to the irradiation energy for both ion species. The effect of energy variation was analyzed using a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) and SRIM simulations. The results demonstrate that ion-beam-induced magnetic ordering strongly depends on both the ion species and the beam energy. Magnetic measurements were performed with varying irradiation energies, showing that carbon ion irradiation produces a higher degree of magnetic ordering compared to proton irradiation at the same dose. The maximum magnetization was obtained at 1.2 MeV carbon ion irradiation. SRIM simulations confirm that carbon ions create a greater number of lattice defects than proton ions, which correlates with the enhanced magnetic response.

Title: Cusped Electrical Conductivity in Spin-1 Chiral Fermion Systems Arising from Multifold Band Degeneracy
Authors: Risako Kikuchi, Junya Endo, Ai Yamakage
Abstract: The energy-dependent electrical conductivity in spin-1 chiral fermion systems with disorder is studied using the self-consistent Born approximation. A distinct cusp-like feature appears at an energy different from the band-crossing point, arising from the multifold band-crossing structure formed by the Dirac and trivial bands. The energy position of the cusp and the corresponding value of the electrical conductivity are found to depend sensitively on both the impurity scattering strength and the curvature of the trivial band. These findings demonstrate the critical role of multifold band crossings and disorder-induced broadening of energy levels in determining the transport properties, offering theoretical insight into the unconventional conductivity behavior observed in topological semimetals hosting spin-1 chiral fermions.

Title: Giant Nonlinear Photon-Drag Currents in Centrosymmetric Moiré Bilayers
Authors: Zhuocheng Lu, Zhuang Qian, Zhichao Guo, Likun Shi, Shi Liu, Hua Wang, Kai Chang
Abstract: We present a unified microscopic theory of nonlinear photon-drag currents, formulated within a geometric-loop framework that provides both transparent quantum-geometric interpretation and numerical tractability. In this picture, the photon-drag shift current corresponds to the dipole moment of the geometric loop, while the photon-drag injection current arises from the same loop weighted by a band velocity difference. We apply the theory to an exact continuum model of twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) with ab initio accuracy. Remarkably, an in-plane wavevector only a few times larger than that of free-space photons already produces sizable photon-drag currents in centrosymmetric TBG, comparable to photogalvanic responses in typical noncentrosymmetric two-dimensional materials. These currents are broadly tunable by twist angle, photon wavevector, and light polarization. Our results establish a quantum geometric framework for nonlinear photon-drag phenomena and highlight moiré bilayers as promising platforms for large, highly tunable optoelectronic responses.

Title: Pair scattering from time-modulated impurity in the Bose-Hubbard model
Authors: Neda Ahmadi, Ameneh Sheikhan, Corinna Kollath
Abstract: We investigate scattering phenomena in a one-dimensional attractive Bose-Hubbard model with a time-periodically modulated impurity. We analyze both single-particle and pair (doublon) transmission, exploring a range of interaction strengths and drive amplitudes. Our exact numerical results reveal excellent quantitative agreement with analytical predictions in the high-frequency limit. At intermediate and weak attractive interactions, we observe significant pair dissociation and the emergence of dynamically localized single-particle modes. These features are reminiscent of Floquet Bound States in the Continuum (BICs). These findings provide new avenues for engineering controllable quantum transport and localized states in ultracold atom experiments.

Title: Unconventional Geometric Phase in Twisted Junction of Cuprates
Authors: Zhigang Song, Kai Chang
Abstract: Originally introduced in optics, the Pancharatnam-Berry phase is a general concept of geometric phase defined for any two interfering polarization states. In electronic systems, however, its counterpart has long been overlooked due to the absence of electron polarization. Here, using large-scale first-principles calculations, we investigate the electronic structure of twisted bilayer Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8. We find spontaneous spin polarization and the emergence of hidden flat bands at the interface between atomic layers. Most notably, we discover an unconventional geometric phase analogous to the Pancharatnam-Berry phase in optics. This electronic geometric phase exerts opposite effects on superconducting currents of opposite chirality, enabling twisted cuprates to act as a filter for chiral superconducting current-even if the ground state itself is non-chiral.

Title: Low-to-mid Al content ($x\sim$ 0-0.56) Al$_x$In$_{1-x}$N layers deposited on Si(100) by radio-frequency sputtering
Authors: R. Blasco, S. Valdueza-Felip, D. Montero, M. Sun, J. Olea, F. B. Naranjo
Abstract: Radio-frequency (RF) sputtering is a low-cost technique for the deposition of large-area single-phase AlInN on silicon layers with application in photovoltaic devices. Here, the effect of the Al mole fraction x from 0 to 0.56 on the structural, morphological, electrical, and optical properties of $n$ Al$_x$In$_{1-x}$N layers deposited at 550 $^\circ$C on p-Si(100) by RF sputtering is studied. X-ray diffraction data show a wurtzite structure oriented along the c-axis in all samples, where the full width at half maximum of the rocking curve around the InN (0002) diffraction peak decreases from $\sim 9^\circ$ to $\sim 3^\circ$ while incorporating Al to the AlInN layer. The rootmean-square surface roughness, estimated from atomic force microscopy, evolves from 20 nm for InN to 1.5 nm for Al$_{0.56}$In$_{0.44}$N. Low-temperature photoluminescence spectra show a blueshift of the emission energy from 1.59 eV (779 nm) for InN to 1.82 eV (681 nm) for Al$_{0.35}$In$_{0.65}$N according to the Al content rise. Hall effect measurements of Al$_x$In$_{1-x}$N ($0<x <0.35$) on sapphire samples grown simultaneously point to a residual n-type carrier concentration in the 1021 cm$^{-3}$ range. The developed n-AlInN/p-Si junctions present promising material properties to explore their performance operating as solar cell devices.

Title: New insights into the magnetism of DyCo$_{5}$
Authors: Alena Vishina, Konstantin Skokov, Hiroki Tsuchiura, Patrik Thunström, Alex Aubert, Oliver Gutfleisch, Olle Eriksson, Heike C. Herper
Abstract: In this work, we present the first magnetization measurements of DyCo$_5$ single crystals in magnetic fields up to 14 T, spanning a temperature range up to 600 K. Our investigation reveals several unique features, including a significant magnetization anisotropy and an observed minimum in spontaneous magnetization near the compensation point, phenomena not previously reported. This work also uncovers the complex magnetic behavior of DyCo$_5$, with a pronounced interplay between the Dy and Co sublattices, each exhibiting distinct temperature-dependent magnetic properties. The combination of dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT), atomistic spin-dynamics (ASD) simulations, and the Effective Spin Model (ESM) for rare-earth compounds successfully explains the experimental data across both low and high temperatures. Our theoretical approach not only explains the observed magnetic anisotropy and the behavior near the compensation temperature but also successfully reproduces key experimental features such as the saturation behavior at high fields and the evolution of the magnetic moment at different temperatures.

Title: Electron Hydrodynamics: Viscosity Tensor and effects of a Magnetic field
Authors: Anubhav Srivastava, Subroto Mukerjee
Abstract: Transport due to electrons in ultra-clean two dimensional systems can be hydrodynamic in nature with the momentum of the electrons being conserved in the bulk. This hydrodynamic behavior coupled with effects of Berry curvature arising from band structure can give rise to novel vortical transport coefficients relating the stress tensor to gradients in the electrostatic potential and temperature. These coefficients have been calculated in the absence of a magnetic field and have been shown to depend only on the equilibrium distribution function~\cite{Chadha_Mukerjee2024}. In this paper, we first obtain an expression for the viscosity tensor and show that the Berry curvature generates odd components of the viscosity tensor arising from the intrinsic angular momentum of the Bloch wavepackets. We calculate the viscosity tensor for a two-dimensional microscopic model of tilted Dirac cones. We next obtain the vortical coefficients and the viscosity tensor in the presence of a magnetic field and extend the Onsager relations for them to include both the magnetic field and the Berry curvature. We show that the field dependence of the coefficients manifests itself in the non-equilibrium part of the distribution function and calculate them to second order in the electron-electron scattering time. We explicitly show that the expressions we obtain are consistent with the Onsager relations.

Title: A topological field-effect memristor

Abstract: Overcoming the limitations of the von Neumann architecture requires new computational paradigms capable of solving complex problems efficiently. Quantum and neuromorphic computing rely on unconventional materials and device functionalities, yet achieving resilience to imperfections and reliable operation remains a major challenge. This has motivated growing interest in topological materials that provide robust and low-power operation while preserving coherence. However, integrating coherent topological transport with non-volatile memory functionality in a single reconfigurable device has remained challenging. In this work, we demonstrate a topological field-effect memristor based on inverted InAs/GaInSb/InAs trilayer quantum wells operating in the quantum spin Hall regime. The intrinsic floating-gate behavior allows one to reconfigure the transistor functionality into memristive functionality with broad electric-field tunability. Unlike other memristor implementations, one resistance state is governed entirely by dissipationless, coherent transport through helical edge channels, while the other arises from incoherent bulk conduction. By combining electrically tunable coherent and incoherent transport with memory functionality, our device realizes a prototypical topological electronic element that integrates coherent transport and adaptive memristive behavior, paving the way for hybrid quantum-neuromorphic architectures.

Title: Effect of temperature and excitation power on down-conversion process in Tb3+/Yb3+-activated silica-hafnia glass-ceramic films
Authors: S. E. Amrani, M. Sun, S. Valdueza-Felip, F. B. Naranjo, M. R. Britel, M. Ferrari, A. Bouajaj
Abstract: Transparent glass ceramics, when activated by rare earth ions, are excellent photonic materials. Regarding photonic glass-ceramics based on silicates, hafnia and silica in a binary system has proved to be an excellent matrix to incorporate rare earth ions in the hafnia nanocrystals, resulting in important luminescence enhancement and, consequently, allowing a large spectrum of critical applications. Here we will focus on the downconversion mechanism driven by the couple Tb3+/Yb3+, largely exploited in photovoltaic systems. The research presented here has been performed on 70SiO2-30HfO2 silica-hafnia glass-ceramic films activated with 19 % rare earth ions: [Tb + Yb]/[Si + Hf] = 19 %. Two main results will be discussed: (a) the intensity and the broadening of the Yb3+ emission band at 975 nm were found to be temperature-dependent, as shown in the figure; (b) the energy transfer mechanism Tb3+ >> Yb3+ will be discussed, referring to the mechanisms that have been proposed in the literature. In relation to the latter topic, the power dependence spectra for the luminescence of Yb3+: 2F5/2 >> 2F7/2 will be discussed.

Abstract: Defect spectroscopy in two-dimensional (2D) field-effect transistors (FETs) requires device architectures that suppress contact and disorder artifacts while preserving intrinsic carrier dynamics. Here, we demonstrate ReS$_2$-hBN FETs with few-layer graphene (FLG) van der Waals contacts that form nearly barrier-free interfaces, enabling intrinsic transport in ReS$_2$, an anisotropic, low-symmetry TMDC rarely exhibiting disorder-free behavior. The clean ReS$_2$-FLG platform allows direct observation of random telegraph noise (RTN) even in micron-scale channels, manifested as discrete two-level current fluctuations between 90-150 K arising from stochastic trapping at localized hBN defect sites. With increasing temperature, the RTN evolves into a 1/f spectrum as multiple traps activate. Statistical analysis of RTN amplitudes and capture-emission kinetics identifies substitutional carbon-related centers in hBN as dominant defects. These findings establish a generalizable approach for probing dielectric-origin defect dynamics in intrinsically conducting, low-symmetry 2D semiconductors.

Title: Anyon Quasilocalization in a Quasicrystalline Toric Code
Authors: Soumya Sur, Mohammad Saad, Adhip Agarwala
Abstract: An exactly solvable model of a quantum spin liquid on a quasicrystal, akin to Kitaev's honeycomb model, was introduced in Kim \textit{et al.}, \href{this https URL}{\text{Phys. Rev. B} \textbf{110}, 214438 (2024)}. It was shown that in contrast to the translationally invariant models, such a spin liquid stabilizes a gapped ground state with a finite irrational flux density. In this work, we analyze the strong bond-anisotropic limit of the model and demonstrate that the aperiodic lattice geometry naturally generates a hierarchy of exponentially separated coupling constants in the resulting toric code Hamiltonian. Furthermore, a perturbative magnetic field leads to anomalous localization properties where an anyonic excitation sequentially delocalizes over subsets of sites forming equipotential contours in the quasicrystal. In addition, certain background flux configurations, together with the underlying geometry, give rise to strictly localized eigenstates that remain decoupled from the rest of the spectrum. Using numerical studies, we uncover the key mechanisms responsible for this unconventional localization behavior. Our study highlights that topologically ordered phases, in the presence of geometrical constraints can lead to highly anomalous localization properties of fractionalized charges.

Title: Enhanced Efficiency of Intermediate-Band Semiconductor Solar Cells Embedded with Quantum Dot Superlattices
Authors: Naira Petrosyan, Lilit Yeganyan, Aram Manaselyan, Vram Mughnetsyan, Vidar Gudmundsson, Albert Kirakosyan
Abstract: We present a multiscale approach for modeling an intermediate-band solar cell based on a GaAs-GaAlAs quantum dot superlattice of cubic symmetry. Our framework combines high-accuracy theoretical calculations of the superlattice band structure and miniband-related absorption coefficient with experimentally determined interband absorption data. The quantum-mechanically derived absorption spectrum is incorporated into a drift-diffusion transport model in COMSOL Multiphysics, where key processes, including thermal and radiative recombination, are taken into account. This integrated methodology enables realistic modeling of device performance. Our results identify an optimal superlattice constant of 14 nm, yielding a maximum solar cell efficiency of 13.3 percent. Further increase in the superlattice constant enhances the miniband-related absorption peak but reduces the generation rate in the n-type region, resulting in a net efficiency decrease. The proposed approach, integrating theoretical, experimental, and computational components, provides a reliable framework for assessing solar cells based on quantum dot superlattices.

Title: Probing Boundary Spins in the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-Hubbard model
Authors: Armando A. Aligia, Alejandro M. Lobos, Lucila Peralta Gavensky, Claudio J. Gazza
Abstract: Studying boundary excitations provides a powerful approach to probe correlations in topological phases. We propose that localized spins near the ends of a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-Hubbard chain embedded in an insulating environment can be detected experimentally using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) combined with electron spin resonance (ESR). When the STM tip is in the contact regime, the tip-end-spin coupling realizes an effective Anderson impurity problem, giving rise to a Kondo peak at low bias. Spatially resolving the Kondo resonance width as the STM tip approaches the chain ends provides an indirect yet clear signature of these localized spins. To support this proposal, we use density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) to calculate the spin gap and spin projection of end states for chains of various lengths and interaction strengths $U$ at half-filling. In the non-interacting limit ($U=0$), we derive simple analytical expressions that reproduce the numerical results for sufficiently long chains. We also discuss how the correlated phase of the isolated chain is characterized by boundary zeros in its single-particle Green's function, and briefly comment on their localization properties in relation to the boundary spins.

Title: Tunable Kondo effect in a bilayer graphene quantum channel
Authors: Josep Ingla-Aynés, Serhii Volosheniuk, Talieh S. Ghiasi, Angelika Knothe, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Vladimir I. Fal'ko, Herre S. J. van der Zant
Abstract: The interaction between itinerant electrons and localized spins is key to a wide range of electronic phenomena. Of particular interest is the regime where the interacting electrons exhibit both spin and valley degeneracy, resulting in SU(4) Kondo physics. However, this regime is challenging to realize in typical mesoscopic systems because it requires a strong interaction between electrons, resulting in a Kondo temperature ($T_\mathrm{K}$) significantly larger than the spin and valley splittings. Here, we present conductance measurements of a quantum point contact (QPC) in bilayer graphene (BLG). Beyond the expected quantized conductance plateaus, which reflect spin and valley degeneracy, we observe an additional subband, known as `0.7 anomaly' exhibiting signatures of Kondo physics and a $T_\mathrm{K}$ ranging from approximately 0.5 up to 2.4 K at zero magnetic field, corresponding to Kondo energies between 40 and 200 $\mu$eV. Given that the spin-orbit splitting in BLG is between 40 and 80 $\mu$eV, we argue that these results are consistent with a transition between four-fold degenerate SU(4) and two-fold degenerate spin-valley locked SU(2) Kondo effects. Furthermore, we break the valley degeneracy of the lowest subband by an out-of-plane magnetic field and show that Kondo signatures remain present, indicating a transition from SU(4) to a valley-polarized SU(2) Kondo effect, and showing the versatility of BLG QPCs for exploring many-body effects.

Title: Ferroelectric Switchable Topological Magnon Hall Effect in Type-I Multiferroics
Authors: Quanchao Du, Jinlian Lu, Xueqing Wan, Zhenlong Zhang, Zhijun Jiang
Abstract: Electric control of magnetism at room temperature is crucial for developing next-generation, low-power spintronic devices. However, the intrinsic incompatibility between ferroelectricity and magnetism in crystal symmetry, along with the absence of strong magnetoelectric coupling mechanisms, continues to pose major challenges. In this work, we propose a general theoretical framework for magnon manipulation based on ferroelectric polarization switching in two-dimensional multiferroics. Taking monolayer multiferroics $\mbox{Ti}_{2}\mbox{F}_{3}$ as an example, our calculations demonstrate that ferroelectric switching can significantly modulate spin exchanges, thereby enabling nonvolatile and reversible electric control of the magnons. More importantly, the ferroelectric polarization reversal leads to a sign change in the Berry curvature, ensuring effective control over the valley Hall and nonlinear Hall response of magnons. This study provides a new way for realizing low-power and electrically controllable magnonic devices.

Title: Coexistence of unconventional spin-orbit torque and in-plane Hall effect in a single ferromagnetic layer

Abstract: The symmetry of a material fundamentally governs its spin transport properties. While unconventional spin transport phenomena have been predominantly explored in low-symmetry systems (e.g., $C_{1v}$ symmetry), high-symmetry crystals--which constitute the majority of industry-compatible materials--are generally expected to exhibit only conventional spin-transport behavior. Here, we report the coexistence of two unconventional spin transport effects, the crystal spin-orbit torque (CSOT) and the crystal in-plane Hall effect (CIHE), in a CoPt single ferromagnetic layer with $C_{3v}$ symmetry. Leveraging the CSOT, we achieve nearly 100% field-free perpendicular magnetization switching in a 6 nm CoPt layer at room temperature. Simultaneously, the CIHE observed in this material exhibits nearly identical dependencies on both current angle and growth temperature as the CSOT. Symmetry analysis confirms that both effects share a common physical origin. Our work not only establishes CoPt as a high-performance spin-orbit material, but also demonstrates that unconventional spin transport can be realized in high-symmetry systems, thereby opening a broad pathway for their application in practical spintronics.

Title: Simulated Annealing for Quadratic and Higher-Order Unconstrained Integer Optimization
Authors: Kohei Suzuki
Abstract: Simulated annealing (SA) is a key algorithm for solving combinatorial optimization problems, which model numerous real-world systems. While SA is commonly used to solve quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problems, many practical problems are more naturally formulated using integer variables. We therefore study quadratic and higher-order unconstrained integer optimization (QUIO and HUIO) problems, which generalize QUBO by allowing integer-valued variables and higher-order interactions. Conventional approaches often convert these problems into QUBO formulations through binary encoding and the reduction of higher-order terms. Such conversions, however, greatly increase the number of variables and interactions, resulting in long computation times and, for large-scale problems, even making the conversion itself a dominant computational bottleneck. To overcome this limitation, we propose an efficient framework that directly applies SA to QUIO and HUIO problems without converting them into QUBO. Within this framework, we introduce an optimal-transition Metropolis method, designed to improve efficiency when the variable bounds are wide, and evaluate its performance alongside the conventional Metropolis and heat bath methods. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed direct approach achieves higher efficiency and solution quality than the conventional QUBO-based formulation and reveal the practical advantages of the optimal-transition Metropolis method. The algorithm developed in this study is available as part of the open-source library OpenJij, which provides a Python interface with a C++ backend.

Title: Molecular insight on ultra-confined ionic transport in wetting films: the key role of friction
Authors: Aymeric Allemand, Anne-Laure Biance, Christophe Ybert, Laurent Joly
Abstract: Nanofluidic transport is ubiquitous in natural systems from extra-cellular communication in biology to geological phenomena, and promotes the emergence of new technologies such as energy harvesting and water desalination. While experimental access to ultraconfined fluids has advanced rapidly, their behavior challenges conventional theoretical descriptions based on Poisson-Boltzmann theory or the Stokes equation whose possible extension remains an open question. In this work, we use molecular dynamics simulations to investigate ionic transport within wetting films of water confined on silica surfaces down to the sub-nanometer scale. We then analyze these results using a simple one-dimensional theoretical framework. Remarkably, we show that this model remains valid even at confinement close to the molecular scale. Our results reveal that the dynamic of ion plays a key role in ionic transports, through ion adsorption at the water-silica interface. Adsorbed cations do not participate in ionic conduction, but instead generate molecular-scale roughness and transmit additional frictional forces to the substrate. This mechanism produces an apparent viscosity increase in electrostatically driven flows, reaching up to four times the bulk value in the case of potassium. Our findings highlight the critical role of interfacial ion adsorption in nanoscale hydrodynamics and provide new insights for interpreting experiments and designing nanofluidic systems.

Title: Numerical study of the effect of the relative mobilities of chemical components on the Non solvent induced phase separation process for membrane elaboration
Authors: Abderraouf Bounjad, Aoran Wu, Cyril Chevarin, Patrick Guenoun, Florent Mallogi, Jean-Pierre Mericq, Charaff Merzougui, Denis Bouyer, Hervé Henry
Abstract: The filtration membranes are often elaborated through a phase separation process where a polymer rich phase and a polymer poor phase spontaneously form through spinodal decomposition. One process that is still not well understood from a theoretical point of view is the Non-Solvent induced phase separation where a thermodynamically stable film of a a polymer mixture is put in contact with a bad solvent of the polymer. The invasion of the film by this non-solvent drives the film out of stability and leads to spinodal decomposition. During this phase separation polymer poor and polymer rich regions form. In this article we present a numerical study of the effect of kinetic coefficients: namely the relative mobilities of polymer and solvent/non-solvent on the observed patterns. Using 2D numerical simulations of the ternary Cahn-Hilliard model we show that for a given thermodynamic landscape, this parameter has dramatic effects: depending on its value phase separation can be observed or not. We also show that it can affect the nature of the observed pattern. In addition analysing 3D simulations we analyse the final pattern using a quantitative indicator of its connectivity and show that for a wide range of initial composition of the film the final pattern is bicontinuous. We also quantify the transport properties of both polymer rich and polymer poor domains.

Title: Altermagnetic Flatband-Driven Fermi Surface Geometry for Giant Tunneling Magnetoresistance
Authors: Xingyue Yang, Shibo Fang, Zongmeng Yang, Pin Ho, Jing Lu, Yee Sin Ang
Abstract: Altermagnetism, characterized by zero net magnetization and symmetry-protected spin-split band structures, has recently emerged as a promising platform for spintronics. In altermagnetic tunnel junctions (AMTJs), the suppression of tunneling in the antiparallel configuration relies on the mismatch between spin-polarized conduction channels in momentum space. However, ideal nonoverlapping spin-polarized Fermi surfaces are rarely found in bulk altermagnets. Motivated by the critical influence of Fermi surface geometry on tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR), we investigate three experimentally synthesized altermagnets -- bulk $\mathrm{V_2Te_2O}$, $\mathrm{RbV_2Te_2O}$, and $\mathrm{KV_2Se_2O}$ -- to elucidate how flatband-driven Fermi surfaces minimize spin-channel overlap and boost AMTJ performance. Notably, $\mathrm{RbV_2Te_2O}$ and $\mathrm{KV_2Se_2O}$ host flat altermagnetic Fermi sheets, which confine spin degeneracy to minimal arc-like or nodal-like regions. Such Fermi surface geometry drastically reduces spin overlap, resulting in an unprecedented intrinsic TMR well over $10^3\%$ in the $\mathrm{KV_2Se_2O}$-based AMTJ. Incorporating an insulating barrier further enhances the TMR to $\sim10^5\%$, surpassing most conventional MTJs. These results not only establish $\mathrm{KV_2Se_2O}$ as a compelling candidate AMTJ material, but also highlight the critical role of flatband Fermi surface geometry in achieving high-performance altermagnetic-spintronic device technology.

Title: Polyampholyte model of ion clusters: double-layer interactions in the presence of dissociated simple salt
Authors: David Ribar, Clifford E Woodward, Jan Forsman
Abstract: We explore interactions between equally charged surfaces, in the presence of simple salt and either neutral or monovalently charged polyampholytes. We consider the possibility of using these charged polymers as crude models of ion clusters. The latter have been hypothesised to form in concentrated aqueous salt solutions, and are possibly related to anomalous underscreening. This phenomenon usually manifests itself by unexpectedly strong and long-ranged effective forces at very high ionic strengths. If ion clusters are formed, they are expected to carry at most a weak net charge. Keeping this in mind, we investigate how polyampholyte chains mediate interactions between charged surfaces. A significant amount of simple salt is also present, in most cases. We highlight that if the charges of the polyampholytes are unevenly distributed, there is a polarisation response that in turn can generate very strong and long-ranged surface forces, even at rather high concentrations of simple salt. Aside from their possible relevance to ion clusters and underscreening phenomena, these results also suggest the possibility of tailoring synthetic polyampholytes, in order to regulate colloidal stability.

Title: Unveiling the degeneracy of bound magnon crystals from magnetic and thermodynamic features of the spin-1/2 Heisenberg octahedral chain
Authors: Jozef Strecka, Michal Nemcik
Abstract: Magnetic, thermodynamic, and magnetocaloric properties of a spin-1/2 Heisenberg octahedral chain with three distinct exchange interactions are investigated in an external magnetic field using the variational method, extended localized-magnon approach, and exact diagonalization. Variational arguments rigorously establish two distinct fragmented phases in the frustrated regime. In the former phase all four spins of each square plaquette form a collective plaquette singlet, whereas in the latter phase two dimer singlets are formed along diagonals of each square plaquette. These bound two-magnon states, supplemented with three localized one-magnon states, enable us to elaborate a generalized localized-magnon theory that is applicable in a frustrated regime across the entire field range as confirmed by comparison with exact diagonalization data. The concept of localized magnons provides a consistent description of low-temperature magnetization curves featuring intermediate one-fifth and three-fifths plateaus, which intersect each other at temperature-independent crossing points determined by the relative degeneracies of competing bound-magnon phases. Field variations of the specific heat reveal a pronounced double-peak structure near each field-driven transition with peak heights depending on the relative degeneracies of the respective bound-magnon states. Our results demonstrate that the system supports highly efficient cooling via adiabatic demagnetization, making it a promising candidate for magnetocaloric refrigeration.

Title: DoS Dos and Don'ts
Authors: Lucas Warwaruk, Konstantinos Zinelis, Randy H. Ewoldt, Christopher W. Macosko, Gareth H. McKinley
Abstract: Dripping-onto-Substrate (DoS) rheometry is a well-established method for measuring the extensional rheology of low-viscosity liquids. However, clear guidelines on the capabilities and limitations of the technique are lacking. In the present work, we define operational limits for measuring a transient extensional viscosity directly from observation of the rate of filament thinning, as well as model-based bounds on calculating a viscosity $\eta$ and extensional relaxation time $\tau_E$ of a liquid using DoS. Dilute solutions of polyethylene oxide (PEO) and polyacrylamide (PAM) are used to probe the lower limit of measurable $\tau_E$, demonstrating that values as low as 0.1 ms can be resolved, provided (a) the intrinsic Deborah number (based on the ratio of the relaxation time and the Rayleigh breakup time scale) is $De \geq \mathcal{O}(0.1)$ and (b) an instrumental constraint related to spatial and temporal resolution is satisfied. This instrumental constraint is quantified through a new metric we define as the \textit{filament capture rate}, a ``figure of merit'' (expressed in Hz) that can be used to quantify the number of data points within the elasto-capillary regime that are available for extraction of $\tau_E$. We also investigate the sensitivity to other experimental parameters including variations in nozzle radius and Bond number ($Bo$). Across the tested range ($0.2 < Bo < 0.7$), extensional relaxation times for the same fluid vary by less than $\pm16$ \%; however, experiments with low viscosity fluids at $Bo > 0.5$ exhibit damped gravitational oscillations that affect early-time dynamics. Collectively, these results provide a quantitative roadmap for reliable DoS rheometry and affirm its use for measuring sub-millisecond relaxation times in weakly elastic fluids.

Title: Critical BKT dynamics in the archetypal 2D spin system Ba$_2$CuSi$_2$O$_6$Cl$_2$
Authors: K. M. Ranjith, Maxime Dupont, Steffen Krämer, Sylvain Capponi, Edmond Orignac, Nicolas Laflorencie, Nobuyuki Kurita, Hidekazu Tanaka, Mladen Horvatić
Abstract: We study the spin dynamics in the quasi-2D spin-$1/2$ dimer compound Ba$_2$CuSi$_2$O$_6$Cl$_2$, which exhibits a magnetic field-induced Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of triplons. Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spin-lattice relaxation rate ($T_1^{-1}$) measurements combined with large-scale quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations, we investigate critical fluctuations across the field-temperature phase diagram. Bridging the behavior observed in 1D and 3D systems, the $T_1^{-1}$ relaxation rate shows a pronounced peak extending well above the Néel temperature $T_N$, indicating strong two-dimensional Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT)-type fluctuations. A quantitative match between experimental and theoretical BEC phase boundaries validates an effective XXZ model. The study determines the intrinsic BKT transition temperature $T_{\mathrm{BKT}}$ from QMC, revealing a nearly field-independent $T_{\mathrm{BKT}}/T_N \approx 0.74$. Scaling analysis of the relaxation rate shows critical exponents consistent with 2D universality, and a narrow temperature window is identified where 2D physics dominates. These findings establish Ba$_2$CuSi$_2$O$_6$Cl$_2$ as a model system for exploring BKT dynamics in quantum magnets.

Title: Building 3D superconductor-based Josephson junctions using a via transfer approach
Authors: Cequn Li, Le Yi, Kalana D. Halanayake, Jessica L. Thompson, Yingdong Guan, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Zhiqiang Mao, Danielle Reifsnyder Hickey, Morteza Kayyalha, Jun Zhu
Abstract: The coupling of superconductivity to unconventional materials may lead to novel quantum states and potential applications. Controlling the quality of the superconductor-normal metal interface is of crucial importance to the understanding and engineering of the superconducting proximity effect. In many cases, conventional lithography-based deposition methods introduce undesirable effects. Using the concept of via contact and dry transfer, we have constructed smooth, van der Waals-like contact between 3D superconducting NbN/Pd and graphene with low contact resistance of approximately 130 $\Omega \cdot \mu m$. Gate-tunable supercurrent, Fraunhofer pattern, and Andreev reflections are observed, the properties of which can be understood using an induced superconducting gap $\Delta$' in this planar contact geometry. We discuss potential mechanisms impacting the magnitude of $\Delta$' and suggest ways of further increasing the proximity coupling. This gentle, lithography-free contacting method can be applied to air- and damage-sensitive surfaces to engineer novel superconducting heterostructures.

Title: Non-Hermitian impurity problem
Authors: E. T. Kokkinakis, I. Komis, K. G. Makris, E. N. Economou
Abstract: The problem of a single Hermitian impurity has long served as a cornerstone in condensed matter physics, offering fundamental insights into the mechanisms of Anderson localization. Yet, despite the increased interest in the spectral and localization properties of non-Hermitian lattices with defects, the non-Hermitian extension of the single impurity problem remains largely unexplored. In this work, we investigate the role of a single complex impurity in one-, two-, and three-dimensional infinite tight-binding lattices. Our study reveals a series of counterintuitive phenomena, including regions where localization vanishes and re-emerges as the impurity strength varies. Next, we study the corresponding finite-sized lattices, which are highly relevant to experimental realizations in readily accessible photonic platforms, revealing a variety of exotic features, such as scale-free localized states, exceptional points, and peculiar cross-shaped localized eigenstates, whose profiles deviate from the conventional exponential localization. This work paves the way for future studies on transport phenomena in non-Hermitian disordered lattices.

Title: Crystal Growth and Physical Properties of Orthorhombic Kagome Lattice Magnets $R$Fe$_6$Ge$_6$ ($R$=Y, Tb, Dy)

Abstract: Kagome magnets represent a promising class of materials that exhibit intriguing electronic and magnetic properties, and they have recently garnered significant attention. While most kagome-lattice compounds are hexagonal, here we report the single-crystal growth and physical property measurements of similar compounds $R$Fe$_6$Ge$_6$ ($R$ = Y, Dy, Tb), which crystallize in an orthorhombic structure. The structure can be derived from a hexagonal prototype $R$Fe$_3$Ge$_2$ by replacing every other $R$ atom with a covalent Ge$_2$ dimer. Ordering of the latter makes the structure orthorhombic the kagome net slightly distorted, and the three Fe sites formally inequivalent. The iron and rare-earth sublattices order independently: the Fe moments order above 400 K having, with ferromagnetic Kagome planes stacked antiferromagnetically, while the rare-earth moments order below 9 K. While TbFe$_6$Ge$_6$ exhibits a single magnetic ordering transition associated with the Tb atoms, DyFe$_6$Ge$_6$ shows two distinct magnetic phase transitions, which are strongly influenced by crystal electric field effects on the Dy$^{3+}$ ions. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that the ferromagnetic ordering of the Fe planes is driven by a high density of states at the Fermi energy. They also reveals three dramatically different structural energy scales: $R$ and Ge$_2$ form alternating 1D chains perpendicular to the kagome planes, and violating this alternation incurs a huge energy cost. Aligning these chains is less costly, and actual 2D order of anti-aligned chains costs very little. These compounds represent a unique class of materials, offering new possibilities to investigate the interplay between the distinct crystal lattice geometry and the underlying electronic and magnetic properties.

Title: Momentum-Resolved Electronic Structure and Orbital Hybridization in the Layered Antiferromagnet CrPS$_4$
Authors: Lasse Sternemann, David Maximilian Janas, Eshan Banerjee, Richard Leven, Jonah Elias Nitschke, Marco Marino, Leon Becker, Ahmet Can Ademoğlu, Frithjof Anders, Stefan Tappertzhofen, Mirko Cinchetti
Abstract: Chromium thiophosphate (CrPS$_4$) is a layered two-dimensional antiferromagnetic semiconductor exhibiting intriguing spintronic and magneto-optical properties, yet its electronic band structure has remained experimentally uncharacterized. Here, we employ momentum-resolved photoemission spectroscopy above and below the Néel temperature, complemented by density functional theory with Hubbard U corrections (DFT+U), to reveal a valence band dominated by Cr $3d$ and S $3p$ states with a ligand-to-metal charge-transfer band gap. We identify weakly hybridized t$_{2g}$ orbitals responsible for magnetic ordering and strongly hybridized e$_{g}$ orbitals that relax dipole selection rules, enabling optically active orbital transitions. These findings establish a foundational understanding of CrPS$_4$'s electronic structure, providing a benchmark for theoretical models and informing future investigations into its orbital physics and potential device applications.

Title: Breakdown of chiral anomaly and emergent phases in Weyl semimetals under orbital magnetic fields
Authors: Faruk Abdulla, Anna Keselman, Daniel Podolsky
Abstract: An external orbital magnetic field applied perpendicular to the separation vector of a pair of Weyl points can couple them and induce a gap in the electronic spectrum. In this work, we investigate the gap-opening behavior in the presence of a lattice, revealing rich phenomenology absent in the continuum picture. Specifically, we address the emergence of layered Chern insulating states, examining how the anisotropy of the Weyl cone dispersion influences the sequence of phase transitions, and establishing connections to the continuum limit. We analyze the evolution of surface Fermi-arc states across these regimes, highlighting their distinct behaviors during the gap-opening transitions.

Title: Measuring Anyonic Exchange Phases Using Two-Dimensional Coherent Spectroscopy
Authors: Nico Kirchner, Wonjune Choi, Frank Pollmann
Abstract: Identifying experimental signatures of anyons, which exhibit fractional exchange statistics, remains a central challenge in the study of two-dimensional topologically ordered systems. Previous theoretical work has shown that the threshold behavior in linear response spectroscopy can reveal the fractional exchange statistics between an anyon and its antiparticle. In this work, we extend this framework to nonlinear, two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy. We demonstrate by analyzing time-ordered four-point correlation functions that the threshold behavior of nonlinear response functions encodes the fractional statistics between general pairs of anyons that can combine to any composite topological charge. This feature in particular provides a powerful probe for unambiguously distinguishing non-Abelian anyons, which can form multiple composite charges with distinct nontrivial braid statistics. Our approach is validated using numerical simulations that are consistent with the correct fractional exchange statistics for both the Abelian anyons in the toric code and non-Abelian Ising anyons.

Title: Flat band surface state superconductivity in thick rhombohedral graphene

Abstract: Rhombohedral multilayer graphene has recently emerged as a rich platform for studying correlation driven magnetic, topological and superconducting states. While most experimental efforts have focused on devices with N$\leq 9$ layers, the electronic structure of thick rhombohedral graphene features flat-band surface states even in the infinite layer limit. Here, we use layer resolved capacitance measurements to directly detect these surface states for $N\approx 13$ layer rhombohedral graphene devices. Using electronic transport and local magnetometry, we find that the surface states host a variety of ferromagnetic phases, including both valley imbalanced quarter metals and broad regimes of density in which the system spontaneously spin polarizes. We observe several superconducting states localized to a single surface state. These superconductors appear on the unpolarized side of the density-tuned spin transitions, and show strong violations of the Pauli limit consistent with a dominant attractive interaction in the spin-triplet, valley-singlet pairing channel. In contrast to previous studies of rhombohedral multilayers, however, we find that superconductivity can persist to zero displacement field where the system is inversion symmetric. Energetic considerations suggest that superconductivity in this regime is described by the existence of two independent surface superconductors coupled via tunneling through the insulating single crystal graphite bulk.

Title: Empirical universality and non-universality of local dynamics in the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model
Authors: Grace Liu, Dmitriy Kunisky
Abstract: Several recent works have aimed to design algorithms for optimizing the Hamiltonians of spin glass models from statistical physics. While Montanari (2018) eventually gave a sophisticated message-passing algorithm to do this nearly optimally for the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model, Parisi (2003) observed earlier that a simple yet unusual algorithm seems to perform just as well: perform local reluctant search, repeatedly making the local adjustment improving the objective function by the smallest possible amount. This is in contrast to the more intuitive local greedy search that repeatedly makes the local adjustment improving the objective by the largest possible amount. We study empirically how the performance of these algorithms depends on the distribution of entries of the coupling matrix in the SK model. We find evidence that, while the runtime of greedy search enjoys universality over a broad range of distributions, the runtime of reluctant search surprisingly is not universal, sometimes depending quite sensitively on the entry distribution. We propose that one mechanism leading to this non-universality is a change in the behavior of reluctant search when the couplings have discrete support on an evenly-spaced grid, and give experimental results supporting this proposal and investigating other properties of a distribution that might affect the performance of reluctant search.

Title: Triple point in a cell fluid model with effective temperature-dependent attraction
Authors: M.P. Kozlovskii, O.A. Dobush, R.V. Romanik, I.V. Pylyuk, M.A. Shpot
Abstract: We study a cell fluid model of a many-particle system with Curie-Weiss-type interaction potential. It is considered as an open system in a fixed volume partitioned into a large number of congruent cubic cells. The interaction potential comprises two competing components: a global uniform attraction acting between all particle pairs in the volume and a short-range repulsion between particles occupying the same cell. Previous studies have established that this model admits an exact solution, exhibits multiple critical points, and undergoes a sequence of first-order phase transitions. Despite variations in the interaction strengths, no triple point appears as long as these parameters remain fixed. We demonstrate that incorporating effective {temperature-dependent} attractive interactions fundamentally alters the phase behavior of the cell model. This modification preserves the model's exact solvability while resulting in the emergence of a triple point in the phase diagram.

Title: Origin of large topological Hall effect in the EuCd$_2$Sb$_2$ antiferromagnet
Authors: Faheem Gul, Orest Pavlosiuk, Tetiana Romanova, Dariusz Kaczorowski, Piotr Wiśniewski
Abstract: We study the origin of large topological Hall effect in the single-crystalline EuCd$_2$Sb$_2$, which orders antiferromagnetically at the Néel temperature $T_{\rm N}=7.4$ K. Measurements of magnetoresistance and Hall resistivity disclose anomalies that evolve with temperature and magnetic field, closely tracking the magnetization process. Analysis of these data identifies three possible mechanisms responsible for the enhanced Berry curvature driving the observed topological Hall effect. Below and above $T_{\rm N}$, Weyl states are the main sources of large momentum-space Berry curvature, though their formation mechanisms differ in these two temperature ranges. Below $T_{\rm N}$, breaking of $C_{3}$ symmetry generates Dirac points that split into Weyl nodes in applied magnetic field, whereas above $T_{\rm N}$, strong spin fluctuations can induce Weyl states. The third contribution, which occurs below $T_{\rm N}$, arises from scalar spin chirality developing within antiferromagnetic domain walls, which generates a real-space Berry curvature.

Title: Minimalist machine-learned interatomic potentials can predict complex structural behaviors accurately
Authors: Iñigo Robredo-Magro, Binayak Mukherjee, Hugo Aramberri, Jorge Íñiguez-González
Abstract: The past decade has witnessed a spectacular development of machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs), to the extent that they are already the approach of choice for most atomistic simulation studies not requiring an explicit treatment of electrons. Typical MLIP usage guidelines emphasize the need for exhaustive training sets and warn against applying the models to situations not considered in the corresponding training space. This restricts the scope of MLIPs to interpolative calculations, essentially denying the possibility of using them to discover new phenomena in a serendipitous way. While there are reasons to be cautious, here we adopt a more sanguine view and challenge the predictive power of two representative and widely available MLIP approaches. We work with minimalist training sets that rely on little prior knowledge of the investigated materials. We show that the resulting models -- for which we adopt modest/default choices of the defining hyperparameters -- are very successful in predicting non-trivial structural effects (competing polymorphs, energy barriers for structural transformations, occurrence of non-trivial topologies) in a way that is qualitatively and quasi-quantitatively correct. Our results thus suggest an expanded scope of modern MLIP approaches, evidencing that somewhat trivial -- and easy to compute -- models can be an effective tool for the discovery of novel and complex physical phenomena.

Title: Evolution of inhomogeneities in two-dimensional disordered superconductors in a magnetic field
Authors: Poulami Sarkar, Jhinhwan Lee, Hae-Ryong Park, Anushree Dutta, Amit Ghosal
Abstract: Emerging granularity in superconducting films by tuning disorder is a well-studied topic, both theoretically and experimentally. However, the orbital magnetic field generates a vortex lattice and contributes to the formation of periodic inhomogeneities. Here, we study superconducting films in the simultaneous presence of disorder and a magnetic field, examining how inhomogeneities in various superconducting correlations evolve under these two perturbations. By performing scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) on thin films of \ce{Sr2VO_{3-\text{x}}FeAs} layer structures under both zero and finite orbital magnetic fields, we report impressive similarities between our theoretical results and the experimental findings. Our results have strong implications for identifying the nature of vortices in disordered superconductors, demonstrating a crossover from Abrikosov to Josephson character with increasing disorder, and provide predictive guidance for interpreting STS and current mapping data in complex superconductors.

Title: A path to high temperature superconductivity via strong short range repulsion in spin polarized band
Authors: Zhiyu Dong, Patrick A. Lee
Abstract: We consider a two dimensional metal that is spin polarized and with strongly repulsive interaction. The interaction is short-ranged and controlled by a screening plane located a distance $d$ away. We consider the case where $d$ is less than the unit cell spacing $a$. We show that due to Pauli exclusion, a controlled expansion is possible despite the strong repulsion, and in many cases results in pairing. We demonstrate this for a tight-binding model on a triangular lattice with nearest neighbor repulsion. We also treat a second model on the triangular lattice with Wannier orbitals with size comparable to $a$. In this case we find $f$-wave pairing with order unity pairing strength, potentially leading to high $T_c$.

Title: Fast and Continuous Detection of Single Microwave Photons via Photo-assisted Quasiparticle Tunneling to a Superconducting Island
Authors: Julien Basset, Ognjen Stanisavljević, Julien Gabelli, Marco Aprili, Jérôme Estève
Abstract: We demonstrate a single-photon detector operating in the microwave domain, based on photo-assisted quasiparticle tunneling events that poison a superconducting island. The detection relies on continuously monitoring the island's charge parity using microwave reflectometry. This scheme achieves 10% detection efficiency with sub 50 ns time resolution and short dead time 1 microsecond, for microwave photons at 10 GHz. The detector features three junctions connected to a superconducting island, which together carry out photoelectric conversion and charge readout. The enhanced light-matter coupling, crucial to photon to quasiparticle conversion, is provided by a granular aluminum-based high-impedance microwave resonator. The time resolved detection of itinerant microwave photon opens up new perspectives in quantum sensing, microwave quantum optics, readout of superconducting qubits and mesoscopic physics.

Title: Thermalization of exact quantum many-body scars in spin-1 XY chain under perturbations
Authors: Himadri Halder
Abstract: Quantum many-body scars are special eigenstates that violate the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis while residing at finite energy density along with thermalizing eigenstates. The spin-1 XY model is known to host a family of such exceptional states originating from long-lived quasiparticle excitations that exhibit anomalously low entanglement entropy and long-time periodic revivals, resulting in weak ergodicity breaking. We study the stability of these scarred states against typical U(1) symmetry preserving perturbations in the XY chain. While perturbation theory can describe the deformed scar states at small system sizes, finite-size scaling of the perturbation matrix elements indicates that the scars ultimately thermalize in larger chains. Nonetheless, we demonstrate that the long-range order associated with the scars decays under the perturbation, and we estimate the relaxation timescale of oscillatory dynamics in certain local observables to be of order $\lambda^{-2}$, where $\lambda$ is the perturbation strength.

Title: Antagonistic impact of thermal expansion and phonon anharmonicity on the phonon-limited resistivity of elemental metals from first principles
Authors: Ao Wang, Junwen Yin, Félix Antoine Goudreault, Michel Côté, Olle Hellman, Samuel Poncé
Abstract: Understanding electrical resistivity in metals remains a central challenge in quantifying charge transport at finite temperature. % Current first-principles calculations based on the Boltzmann transport equation often match experiments, yet they almost always neglect the effect of thermal expansion and phonon anharmonicity. % We show that both effects exert an opposite impact on electron-phonon coupling and on electrical resistivity. % Thermal expansion enhances the coupling and leads to overestimation of resistivity, whereas anharmonic effects reduce it. % By explicitly incorporating both effects, we establish a more complete description of resistivity in elemental metals, demonstrated here for Pb, Nb, and Al.

Title: Frustration driven magnetic correlations in the spin-$5/2$ triangular lattice antiferromagnet RbFe(HPO$_{3}$)$_{2}$
Authors: V. Nagpal, Sebin J. Sebastian, Surya P. Patra, S. Shibash, Q.-P. Ding, Y. Furukawa, R. Nath
Abstract: A detailed study of the structural and magnetic properties of a spin-$5/2$ triangular lattice antiferromagnet RbFe(HPO$_{3}$)$_{2}$ is presented using x-ray diffraction, magnetization, heat capacity, and $^{31}$P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments on a polycrystalline sample. The crystal structure features an equilateral triangular lattice of Fe$^{3+}$ ions. The thermodynamic measurements reveal the onset of a magnetic long-range order at $T_{\rm N1} \simeq 7.8$ K in zero-field, followed by another low temperature field induced ordering at $T_{\rm N2}$ in higher fields. The transition at $T_{\rm N1}$ is further confirmed from the NMR spin lattice relaxation measurements. The value of the frustration ratio ($f \simeq 7$) implies moderate spin frustration in the compound. The $^{31}$P NMR spectra exhibit two distinct spectral lines corresponding to two inequivalent phosphorus sites (P1 and P2), consistent with the crystal structure. The P1 site is strongly coupled with an isotropic hyperfine coupling of $A_{\rm hf}^{\rm iso} = 0.55(2)$ T/$\mu_{\rm B}$ while the P2 site is weakly coupled with $A_{\rm hf}^{\rm iso} = 0.25(3)$ T/$\mu_{\rm B}$ with the Fe$^{3+}$ ions. The magnetic susceptibility and NMR shift data are described well assuming a spin-$5/2$ isotropic triangular lattice antiferromagnetic model with an average exchange coupling of $J/k_{\rm B} = 2.8(2)$ K. Below $T_{\rm N1}$, the spectra evolve into a nearly rectangular powder pattern, indicating a commensurate antiferromagnetic type order. The $^{31}$P spin-lattice relaxation rate well below $T_{\rm N1}$ follows a $T^3$ temperature dependence, implying a two-magnon Raman scattering mechanism in the ordered state. Three well-defined phase regimes are clearly ascertained in the $H-T$ phase diagram, reflecting a weak magnetic anisotropy in the compound.

Title: Efficient prediction of topological superlattice bands with spin-orbit coupling
Authors: M. Nabil Y. Lhachemi, Valentin Crépel, Jennifer Cano
Abstract: We develop a symmetry indicator framework to efficiently predict the topology of superlattice-induced minibands with spin-orbit coupling. Our algorithm requires input only from the parent material before the superlattice is applied. The simplification arises by assuming a perturbatively weak superlattice potential; however, our results extend beyond the perturbative regime as long as the superlattice-induced gaps remain open. We first consider a time-reversal- and inversion-symmetric system subject to a weak superlattice potential and derive a compact formula for the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant of the lowest miniband. We then extend to time-reversal breaking systems and compute the Chern number. We apply our theory to selected transition metal dichalcogenides, HgTe/CdTe quantum wells, and thin films of three-dimensional topological insulators and Dirac semimetals. We find topological superlattice bands can arise even from non-topological materials, broadening the pool of candidates for realizing topological flat bands. Our theory predicts which geometry and periodicity of superlattice will yield topological bands for a given material, providing a clear guiding principle for designing topological superlattice heterostructures.

Title: Fractional Chern insulator edges: crystalline effects and optical measurements
Authors: Yan-Qi Wang, Johannes Motruk, Andrey Grankin, Mohammad Hafezi
Abstract: Edge states of chiral topologically ordered phases are commonly described by chiral Luttinger liquids, effective theories that are exact only in the hydrodynamic limit. Motivated by recent bulk observations of fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) in two-dimensional materials and by synthetic realizations in ultracold atoms, we revisit this framework and quantify deviations from the hydrodynamic limit due to lattice effects. Using a combination of analytical arguments and numerical simulations, we disentangle universal from nonuniversal edge properties. We outline experimental probes in excitonic FCIs and in ultracold atom systems, and in particular propose time-resolved edge spectroscopy to directly access the predicted exponents and velocities.

Title: Catalytic Resonance Theory: Kinetics and Frequency Response of Light-Promoted Catalysis
Authors: Paul J Dauenhauer
Abstract: The illumination of catalytic surfaces with a continuous or pulsed stream of photons dynamically modulates surface chemistry for faster rates, higher conversion, or product selectivity control. To establish fundamental principles of dynamic photon-modulated catalysis, the photocatalytic conversion of a generic surface reaction was simulated to understand the kinetic implications of an independent stream of photons promoting surface product desorption. Simulations were conducted via the microkinetic model and kinetic Monte Carlo methods for the scenarios of a Poisson distribution, constant spacing between photons, and coordinated on/off pulsing of photon sources. The time-averaged photocatalytic rate at differential conditions for varying photon flux and temperatures indicated three kinetic regimes described by product thermal desorption control, surface reaction control, and an intermediate kinetic regime with a zero slope Arrhenius plot, consistent with a degree of rate control dominated by the photon arrival frequency (i.e., per-site photon flux). The maximum photocatalytic rate occurred orders of magnitude above the Sabatier limit at the resonance frequency, identified as the photon arrival frequency that matched the surface reaction rate constant. Non-equilibrium photocatalytic conversion occurred when the rate of photon-promoted product desorption was comparable to the rate of thermal product desorption. Results indicated the general utility of photon-promoted catalysis, with negligible benefit for rate enhancement and quantum yield with photon source pulsing or chopping due to the inherent dynamic nature of photons from light sources.

Title: Magnetically induced Josephson nano-diodes in field-resilient superconducting microwave circuits
Authors: Benedikt Wilde, Mohamad Kazouini, Timo Kern, Kevin Uhl, Christoph Füger, Dieter Koelle, Reinhold Kleiner, Daniel Bothner
Abstract: The development of nonlinear and frequency-tunable superconducting microwave circuits for operation in large magnetic fields is of high relevance for hybrid quantum systems such as spin resonance spectrometers, microwave quantum magnonics, dark matter axion detectors or flux-mediated optomechanics. With these exciting perspectives in mind, we investigate niobium-based circuits with integrated nano-constriction quantum interferometers in magnetic in-plane fields up to several hundred mT. Our experiments reveal an unexpected and pronounced field-induced asymmetry in the bias-flux response of the circuits, which is demonstrated to originate from a field-induced Josephson-diode effect within the nano-constrictions and which considerably enhances the circuit figures of merit in a magnetic field. An intuitive macroscopic Josephson-diode model attributes the effect to inhomogeneous constriction properties and provides us with the diode current-phase relation as a function of the in-plane field. Finally, we demonstrate that in the diode-state the circuit Kerr nonlinearity is bimodal in frequency, not only eliminating alternative explanations for the bias-flux-asymmetries but also being potentially useful for quantum circuit applications. Overall, our report underlines that niobium nano-constriction circuits belong to the most promising candidates for high-field hybrid quantum systems and reveals the untapped potential of combining Josephson nano-diodes with microwave quantum circuits.

Title: Time Evolution of Multi-Party Entanglement Signals
Authors: Vijay Balasubramanian, Hanzhi Jiang, Simon F. Ross
Abstract: We study the real-time dynamics of multi-party entanglement signals in chaotic quantum many-body systems including but not necessarily restricted to holographic conformal field theories. We find that scrambling dynamics generates multiparty entanglement with rich structure including: (a) qualitatively different dynamical behaviours for different signals, likely reflecting different dynamics for different kinds of entanglement patterns, (b) discontinuities indicating dynamical phase transitions in the entanglement structure, (c) transient and non-monotonic multiparty entanglement, and (d) periods during which the extensive entanglement of some regions is entirely multipartite. Our main technical tool is the membrane theory of entanglement dynamics.

Title: Hybrid-spin decoupling for noise-resilient DC quantum sensing
Authors: So Chigusa, Masashi Hazumi, Ernst David Herbschleb, Yuichiro Matsuzaki, Norikazu Mizuochi, Kazunori Nakayama
Abstract: The excellent sensitivities of quantum sensors are a double-edged sword: minuscule quantities can be observed, but any undesired signal acts as noise. This is challenging when detecting quantities that are obscured by such noise. Decoupling sequences improve coherence times and hence sensitivities, though only AC signals in narrow frequency bands are distinguishable. Alternatively, comagnetometers operate gaseous spin mixtures at high temperatures in the self-compensating regime to counteract slowly varying noise. These are applied with great success in various exotic spin-interaction searches. Here, we propose a method that decouples specific DC fields from DC and AC magnetic noise. It requires any spin cluster where the effect on each individual spin is different for the target field and local magnetic fields, which allows for a different approach compared to comagnetometers. The presented method has several key advantages, including an orders-of-magnitude increase in noise frequencies to which we are resistant. We explore electron-spin nuclear-spin pairs in nitrogen-vacancy centres in diamond, with a focus on their merit for light dark-matter searches. Other applications include gradient sensing, quantum memory, and gyroscopes.

Title: Adiabatic reverse annealing is robust to low-temperature decoherence
Authors: An Le, Christopher L. Baldwin
Abstract: Adiabatic reverse annealing (ARA) is an improvement to conventional quantum annealing (QA) that uses an initial guess at the desired ground state to circumvent problematic phase transitions. Despite encouraging results in the closed-system setting, Ref. [1] has suggested on the basis of numerical simulations that ARA may lose its advantage in the presence of decoherence. Here, we revisit this problem from a more analytical perspective. Using the $p$-spin model as a solvable example, together with the adiabatic master equation to describe the effects of the environment (valid at weak coupling), we show that ARA can in fact succeed in open systems but that the temperature of the environment plays a key role. We first demonstrate that, in the adiabatic limit, the system will follow the instantaneous equilibrium state as long as the protocol does not pass through any (finite-temperature) phase transitions. Given this, there are two distinct mechanisms by which ARA can break down at high temperature: either there are no paths that avoid transitions, or the equilibrium state itself is disordered. When the temperature is sufficiently low that neither of these occur, then ARA succeeds. Remarkably, there are even situations in which the environment benefits ARA: we find parameter values for which no transition-avoiding paths exist at zero temperature but such paths appear at non-zero temperature.

Title: Scalable Quantum Computational Science: A Perspective from Block-Encodings and Polynomial Transformations
Authors: Kevin J. Joven, Elin Ranjan Das, Joel Bierman, Aishwarya Majumdar, Masoud Hakimi Heris, Yuan Liu
Abstract: Significant developments made in quantum hardware and error correction recently have been driving quantum computing towards practical utility. However, gaps remain between abstract quantum algorithmic development and practical applications in computational sciences. In this Perspective article, we propose several properties that scalable quantum computational science methods should possess. We further discuss how block-encodings and polynomial transformations can potentially serve as a unified framework with the desired properties. We present recent advancements on these topics including construction and assembly of block-encodings, and various generalizations of quantum signal processing (QSP) algorithms to perform polynomial transformations. We also highlight the scalability of QSP methods on parallel and distributed quantum architectures. Promising applications in simulation and observable estimation in chemistry, physics, and optimization problems are presented. We hope this Perspective serves as a gentle introduction of state-of-the-art quantum algorithms to the computational science community, and inspires future development on scalable quantum computational science methodologies that bridge theory and practice.

Title: Conserved quantities enable the quantum Mpemba effect in weakly open systems
Authors: Iris Ulčakar, Rustem Sharipov, Gianluca Lagnese, Zala Lenarčič
Abstract: Observation of the quantum Mpemba effect has spurred much interest in its enabling conditions and its relation to the classical counterpart. Here, we consider weakly open many-body quantum systems initialized in different thermal states and examine when the initially farther state relaxes to the (non-equilibrium) steady state faster. We claim that the number of conserved quantities in the unitary part plays a crucial role: the Mpemba effect is possible only when the Hamiltonian commutes with other extensive operators or is integrable. The reason lies in the dynamical evolution happening in spaces of different dimensions. When energy is the only approximately conserved quantity, dissipation pushes the dynamics within a single-parameter manifold of different thermal states. In contrast, for Hamiltonians with several conserved quantities, the dynamics drift in the multi-dimensional space of generalized Gibbs ensembles, whose distance to the steady state is less trivial. We provide numerical results for large system sizes using tensor networks and free-fermion techniques, thereby supporting our claim.

Title: EFT meets CFT: Multiloop renormalization of higher-dimensional operators in general $\boldsymbol{ϕ^4}$ theories
Authors: Johan Henriksson, Stefanos R. Kousvos, Jasper Roosmale Nepveu
Abstract: The renormalization of composite operators is a fundamental aspect of quantum field theory, relevant for the description of phase transitions and high energy phenomenology. We calculate the anomalous dimensions of a large set of operators in any scalar $\phi^4$ theory in $d=4-\varepsilon$ dimensions, up to five loops in most cases. The results have applications in both effective field theory (EFT) and conformal field theory (CFT). As an EFT application, we extract the five-loop renormalization group (RG) equations of the Higgs sector of the Standard Model EFT at dimension six, and up to two loops at dimension eight, aligning our operator basis with custodial symmetry violation. Additionally, for CFT, by resumming the $\varepsilon$-expanded results at the fixed-point, we determine the entire low-lying spectrum (i.e. up to dimension six and Lorentz rank two) of the Ising, $O(n)$ and hypercubic scalar CFTs. Our work enables future conformal bootstrap studies for numerous theories of interest. We include introductions to EFT and CFT, and we illustrate our method and the structure in RG mixing matrices in several illuminating examples, which may also be of general interest. All results in the general theory are publicly available and we describe a systematic path towards applying them to more complicated CFTs.

Title: A permutation-based power series representation of the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula
Authors: Joseph M. Jones, M. W. Long
Abstract: The Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula was recently resummed exactly in one variable, and left as a power series in the other (Moodie and Long 2021 J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 54 015208). The coefficients of the power series were provided as a sum of products of three hyperbolic functions that are analogous to the familiar commutator expansion. We find a new form of the power series coefficients that is a linear combination of just one of the hyperbolic functions. This linear combination can be understood through elementary permutations of the arguments of the hyperbolic function. We use generating functions and hyperbolic identities to relate the representations. The permutation representation is radically different to previously known structures in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula and naturally supersedes the previous power series representation for future use, in our opinion. It also allows us to prove a set of intriguing marching identities that are useful in physical applications and were discovered in the initial work.

Title: Broadband telecom single-photon emissions from InAs/InP quantum dots grown by MOVPE droplet epitaxy
Authors: Shichen Zhang, Li Liu, Kai Guo, Xingli Mu, Yuanfei Gao, Junqi Liu, Fengqi Liu, Quanyong Lu, Zhiliang Yuan
Abstract: The development of quantum materials for single-photon emission is crucial for the advancement of quantum information technology. Although significant advancement has been witnessed in recent years for single photon sources in near infrared band ({\lambda}~700-1000 nm), several challenges have yet to be addressed for ideal single photon emission at the telecommunication band. In this study, we present a droplet-epitaxy strategy for O-band to C-band single-photon source based semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) using metal-organic vapor-phase epitaxy (MOVPE). Via investigating the growth conditions of the epitaxial process, we have successfully synthesized InAs/InP QDs with narrow emission lines spanning a broad spectral range of {\lambda}~1200-1600 nm. The morphological and optical properties of the samples were characterized using atomic force microscopy and micro photoluminescence spectroscopy. The recorded single-photon purity of a plain QD structure reaches (g(2)(0) = 0.16), with a radiative recombination lifetime as short as 1.5 ns. This work provides a crucial platform for future research on integrated microcavity enhancement techniques and coupled QDs with other quantum photonics in the telecom bands, offering significant prospects for quantum network applications.

Title: Spectroscopy on a single nonlinear mode recognizes quantum states
Authors: Wouter Verstraelen, Stanisław Świerczewski, Andrzej Opala, Andrew Haky, Matteo Gadani, Huawen Xu, Oleksandr Kyriienko, Michał Matuszewski, Alberto Bramati, Timothy C.H. Liew
Abstract: Characterising optical quantum states is essential for the development of quantum technologies. While traditional approaches to perform full quantum state tomography are often experimentally demanding, neuromorphic architectures may provide an effective alternative. In this work, we demonstrate how a quantum nonlinear driven-dissipative mode is sufficient to act as a quantum reservoir. By analyzing the occupations at different frequencies in the emission spectrum, a linear regression suffices in many cases to recognize the relevant parameters of incident squeezed states. Beyond highlighting the general potential of this approach under continuous driving, we illustrate its effectiveness in an explicit nontrivial example where the source is a degenerate optical parametric oscillator (OPO), coupled to a nonlinear polariton microcavity.

Title: Quantum Jump Approach for Photosynthetic Energy Transfer with Chemical Reaction and Fluorescence Loss
Authors: Rui Li, Yi Li, Kai-Ya Zhang, Qing Ai
Abstract: Recently, the coherent modified Redfield theory (CMRT) has been widely used to simulate the excitation-energy-transfer (EET) processes in photosynthetic systems. However, the numerical simulation of the CMRT is computationally expensive when dealing with large-scale systems, e.g. photosystem I (PSI) and II (PSII). On the other hand, the chemical reaction and fluorescence loss traditionally treated by the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian approach may result in significantly error in a wide range of parameters. To address these issues, we introduce a quantum jump approach (QJA) based on the CMRT to simulate the evolution of photosynthetic complexes including both the chemical reaction and fluorescence loss. The QJA shows higher accuracy and efficiency in simulating the EET processes. The QJA-CMRT approach may provide a powerful tool to design and optimize artificial photosynthetic systems, which benefits future innovation in the field of energy.

Title: The Scrooge ensemble in many-body quantum systems
Authors: Max McGinley, Thomas Schuster
Abstract: In many physical settings, the statistical properties of quantum states are thought to be described by the Scrooge ensemble, a more structured generalization of the Haar ensemble. In this work, we prove several key results on the properties and complexity of Scrooge-random states in macroscopic quantum systems, and provide a general-purpose calculus for evaluating their moments. A key theme of our results is a separation between universal random fluctuations in non-local properties and exponential concentration of all local properties. Implications for device benchmarking, sampling advantages beyond random circuits, quantum complexity growth, and the physical origin of Scrooge-random states are discussed.

Title: Ferroelectric Nematic Liquid Crystals as Charge Boosters for Triboelectric Nanogenerators
Authors: Jia-Yao Ye, Susanta Chakraborty, Karthick Subramani, Xing-Zhou Tang, Yan-Nan Xie, Bing-Xiang Li
Abstract: Driven by growing demand for clean energy, triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) have emerged as promising self-powered systems, yet achieving high charge density remains a critical challenge. In polymer dielectrics, triboelectricity can be further amplified by incorporating high-dielectric and polar materials for functional adaptability. Conventional dielectrics, including liquid crystals (LCs), offer limited improvement for triboelectrification, whereas the breakthrough ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals (NF-LCs), with giant spontaneous polarization and high dielectric constant, act as highly effective charge boosters. Here, we introduce NF-LC (DIO) as a functional filler in a PVDF-based TENG. Increasing DIO content progressively grows the electroactive phase and effective polarization in PVDF and defines a marked improvement in TENGs electrical performances through favourable dipolar alignment and strengthened charge-trap effects. The optimized composite film achieves an impressive open-circuit voltage of 1.1 kV, short-circuit current of 50 micro Amp, and power density of 110 W/m2 - seven times higher than pure PVDF. The device exhibits excellent charge-storage capability, powers over 500 LEDs without power management. This work establishes NF-LC-based TENGs as a new platform for high-performance self-powered energy harvesting, linking soft matter physics with applied energy technology.

Title: Basic cell for a quantum microwave router
Authors: Evgeniya Mutsenik, Aidar Sultanov, Leonie Kaczmarek, Matthias Schmelz, Gregor Oelsner, Ronny Stolz, Evgeni Ilichev
Abstract: We report the first experimental realization of a scalable basic cell for quantum routing, enabling coherent control and exchange of microwave photons between two spatially separated superconducting waveguides coupled via a single transmon qubit. The cell was characterized at 10 mK with an average input signal of approximately 1 photon at approximately 6 GHz, and with the qubit biased to its optimal point to minimize sensitivity to external magnetic fluctuations. By combining steady-state and time-domain measurements, we reconstructed the key parameters of the system, including qubit relaxation and dephasing, waveguide-qubit couplings, and cross-waveguide photon transfer efficiency. The observed performance is consistent with a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian formalism and demonstrates clear limits set by flux bias, temperature, and photon number, in agreement with flux- and temperature-induced dephasing models. Crucially, the cell operates reliably at the single-photon level, and in the high-photon regime we directly observe photon dressing induced by the qubit. These results establish a versatile platform for studying open quantum system phenomena and pave the way for scalable implementations of quantum routing and network nodes.

Title: Aspects of quantum geometry in photonic time crystals
Authors: Karthik Subramaniam Eswaran, Ali Emami Kopaei, Krzysztof Sacha
Abstract: We develop a geometric description of quantum light in photonic time crystals on the SU(1,1) coherent-state manifold. In a projective picture, the evolution of each mode appears as a Möbius isometry on the Poincaré disk, where topologies of trajectories distinguish stable, unstable, and critical regimes. The geometric phase is related to the hyperbolic area enclosed by cyclic paths in the complex projective Hilbert space. This framework offers an intuitive view of stability and topology in quantum photonic time crystals.

Title: Robust detection of an entanglement transition in the projective transverse field Ising model
Authors: Felix Roser, Etienne M. Springer, Hans Peter Büchler, Nicolai Lang
Abstract: We propose a scalable and noise-resilient protocol for the detection of the entanglement transition in a projective version of the transverse field Ising model. Entanglement transitions are experimentally difficult to observe due to the inherent randomness of projective measurements and noise in large-scale experimental settings. Our approach combines error correction algorithms with classical shadow tomography to overcome both problems. This allows for experimentally accessible upper and lower bounds on the entanglement transition without postselection or full state tomography. These bounds remain robust under noise and their sharpness is a measure of the noise rate.

Title: Circulation of Elites in an Adaptive Network Model
Authors: Alexander Jochim, Stefan Bornholdt
Abstract: Societies experience politically stable and unstable phases along history, whereas political power is usually passed to new elite groups by these changes. Structural dynamics of the elites in a society have been proposed to be one of the core drivers shaping long term behavior. As current models and data are rather macroscopic, the emergence of macroscopic behavior from microscopic dynamics is largely unclear. Here, we introduce an adaptive network model of directed links representing political power and competing political ideas, based on local dynamical rules, only. The model is based on two socially motivated behaviors: the cumulative advantage effect of political power and intra-elite conflict. We observe punctuated equilibria as an emergent behavior and find a phase transition towards a disordered phase. We define an advance warning measure for elite collapse and find that the states of only a few largest nodes are suitable as a proxy with predictive information.

Title: Local equations for the generalized Lotka-Volterra model on sparse asymmetric graphs
Authors: David Machado, Pietro Valigi, Tommaso Tonolo, Maria Chiara Angelini
Abstract: Real ecosystems are characterized by sparse and asymmetric interactions, posing a major challenge to theoretical analysis. We introduce a new method to study the generalized Lotka-Volterra model with stochastic dynamics on sparse graphs. By deriving local Fokker-Planck equations and employing a mean-field closure, we can efficiently compute stationary states for both symmetric and asymmetric interactions. We validate our approach by comparing the results with the direct integration of the dynamical equations and by reproducing known results and, for the first time, we map the phase diagram for sparse asymmetric networks. Our framework provides a versatile tool for exploring stability in realistic ecological communities and can be generalized to applications in different contexts, such as economics and evolutionary game theory.

Title: Noise Electrometry of Polar and Dielectric Materials
Authors: Rahul Sahay, Pavel A. Volkov, Satcher Hsieh, Eric Parsonnet, Lane W. Martin, Ramamoorthy Ramesh, Norman Y. Yao, Shubhayu Chatterjee
Abstract: A qubit sensor with an electric dipole moment acquires an additional contribution to its depolarization rate when it is placed in the vicinity of a polar or dielectric material as a consequence of electrical noise arising from polarization fluctuations in the latter. Here, we characterize this relaxation rate as a function of experimentally tunable parameters such as sample-probe distance, probe-frequency, and temperature, and demonstrate that it offers a window into dielectric properties of insulating materials over a wide range of frequencies and length scales. We discuss the experimental feasibility of our proposal and illustrate its ability to probe a variety of phenomena, ranging from collective polar excitations to phase transitions and disorder-dominated physics in relaxor ferroelectrics. Our proposal paves the way for a novel table-top probe of polar and dielectric materials in a parameter regime complementary to existing tools and techniques.

Title: Deep learning-based computational method for soft matter dynamics: Deep Onsager-Machlup method
Authors: Zhihao Li, Boyi Zou, Haiqin Wang, Jian Su, Dong Wang, Xinpeng Xu
Abstract: A deep learning-based computational method is proposed for soft matter dynamics -- the deep Onsager-Machlup method (DOMM). It combines the brute forces of deep neural networks (DNNs) with the fundamental physics principle -- Onsager-Machlup variational principle (OMVP). In the DOMM, the trial solution to the dynamics is constructed by DNNs that allow us to explore a rich and complex set of admissible functions. It outperforms the Ritz-type variational method where one has to impose carefully-chosen trial functions. This capability endows the DOMM with the potential to solve rather complex problems in soft matter dynamics that involve multiple physics with multiple slow variables, multiple scales, and multiple dissipative processes. Actually, the DOMM can be regarded as an extension of the deep Ritz method (DRM) developed by E and Yu that uses DNNs to solve static problems in physics. In this work, as the first step, we focus on the validation of the DOMM as a useful computational method by using it to solve several typical soft matter dynamic problems: particle diffusion in dilute solutions, and two-phase dynamics with and without hydrodynamics. The predicted results agree very well with the analytical solution or numerical solution from traditional computational methods. These results show the accuracy and convergence of DOMM and justify it as an alternative computational method for solving soft matter dynamics.

Title: Nonequilibrium Bound for Canonical Nonlinearity Under Single-Shot Work
Authors: Koretaka Yuge, Yutaro Sakamoto
Abstract: For classical discrete systems under constant composition (specifically substitutional alloys), canonical average acts as a map from a set of many-body interatomic interactions to a set of configuration in thermodynamic equilibrium, which is generally nonlinear. In terms of the configurational geometry (i.e., information about configurational density of states), the nonlinearity has been measured as special vector on configuration space, which is extended to Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence on statistical manifold. Although they successfully provide new insight into how the geometry of lattice characterizes the nonlinearity, their application is essentially restricted to thermodynamic equilibrium. Based on the resource theory (especially, thermo-majorization), we here extend the applicability of the nonlinearity to nonequilibrium states obtained through single-shot work on Gibbs state. We reveal that the extended nonlinearity for nonequilibrium state is bounded from upper by the information about Renyi divergences for equilibrium states in between practical and linear systems, and temperature and work.

Title: Validity of the Fröhlich model for a mobile impurity in a Bose-Einstein condensate
Authors: Jonas Lampart, Arnaud Triay
Abstract: We analyze the many-body Hamiltonian describing a mobile impurity immersed in a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). Using exact unitary transformations and rigorous error estimates, we show the validity of the Bogoliubov-Fröhlich Hamiltonian for the Bose polaron in the regime of moderately strong, repulsive interactions with a dilute BEC. Moreover, we calculate analytically the universal logarithmic correction to the ground state energy that arises from an impurity mediated phonon-phonon interaction.

Title: Efficient Spin Transfer in WTe2/Fe3GeTe2 van der Waals Heterostructure Enabled by Direct Interlayer p-Orbital Hybridization
Authors: H. L. Ning, M. Q. Dong, X. Zhang, J. S. Huang, B. Liu, Zhi-Xin Guo, Y. Dong
Abstract: Recent experiments have demonstrated efficient spin transfer across layers in the van der Waals heterostructure composed of WTe2 and Fe3GeTe2, signaling a potential breakthrough in developing all-van der Waals spin-orbit torque devices. However, the reasons behind the unusually high interlayer spin transparency observed, despite the weak van der Waals interactions between layers, remain unclear. In this study, we employ density functional theory and the non-equilibrium Green's function method to explore this phenomenon. We find that the efficient cross-layer spin transfer arises from direct hybridization of p-orbitals between tellurium atoms at the interface. This interlayer orbital hybridization lowers the electronic potential barrier and significantly modifies the spin-polarized electronic structure of Fe3GeTe2. Consequently, an effective channel for spin-polarized transport is established between WTe2 and Fe3GeTe2, leading to high interlayer spin transparency. Combining this enhanced spin transparency with the large spin Hall angle of WTe2 explains the high spin-orbit torque efficiency observed experimentally. Furthermore, we predict that applying a gate voltage can further increase this efficiency. Our findings offer a pathway for designing high-performance, all-van der Waals spin-orbit torque devices.

Title: Statistical physics analysis of graph neural networks: Approaching optimality in the contextual stochastic block model
Authors: O. Duranthon, L. Zdeborová
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are designed to process data associated with graphs. They are finding an increasing range of applications; however, as with other modern machine learning techniques, their theoretical understanding is limited. GNNs can encounter difficulties in gathering information from nodes that are far apart by iterated aggregation steps. This situation is partly caused by so-called oversmoothing; and overcoming it is one of the practically motivated challenges. We consider the situation where information is aggregated by multiple steps of convolution, leading to graph convolutional networks (GCNs). We analyze the generalization performance of a basic GCN, trained for node classification on data generated by the contextual stochastic block model. We predict its asymptotic performance by deriving the free energy of the problem, using the replica method, in the high-dimensional limit. Calling depth the number of convolutional steps, we show the importance of going to large depth to approach the Bayes-optimality. We detail how the architecture of the GCN has to scale with the depth to avoid oversmoothing. The resulting large depth limit can be close to the Bayes-optimality and leads to a continuous GCN. Technically, we tackle this continuous limit via an approach that resembles dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) with constraints at the initial and final times. An expansion around large regularization allows us to solve the corresponding equations for the performance of the deep GCN. This promising tool may contribute to the analysis of further deep neural networks.

Title: Method for rapid estimation of the energy-time covariance matrix of single electrons
Authors: Wanki Park, Chanuk Yang, Young-Seok Ghee, Hyung Kook Choi, Bum-Kyu Kim, Myung-Ho Bae
Abstract: The ability to emit and control single electrons in a dynamical manner enables their use in electron quantum optics and sensing. To characterize the electron states emitted with energy far above the Fermi energy, a dynamic barrier has been used. In this work, we extract the energy-time covariance matrix of single electrons by analyzing the energy variance obtained from the transconductance through the dynamic barrier. This method enables efficient and precise characterization of electron states, especially when a sinusoidal waveform is used. An effective phase-space area and the elliptical distribution are constructed from the covariance matrix and qualitatively compared with the distribution reconstructed from a tomographic method. The area constrained by the uncertainty relation serves as a measure of proximity to the quantum limit. Our results demonstrate an efficient method for characterizing electron states, paving the way for their application in quantum technologies.

Title: Observation of Topological Hall Effect in Synthetic Antiferromagnetic Skyrmion System
Authors: Xinbao Geng, Guanqi Li, Zhongxiang Zhang, Wenjing Hu, Wenjing Zhong, Xiaoming Xiong, Yongbing Xu, Zhendong Chen, Junlin Wang, Xiangyu Zheng, Jing Wu
Abstract: Synthetic antiferromagnetic (SAF) skyrmions have emerged as promising candidates for next-generation high-speed and highly integrated spintronic devices, owing to their exceptional properties such as high driving velocity, nanoscale dimensions, and the absence of the skyrmion Hall effect. In this work, we report the observation of the topological Hall effect in both compensated and non-compensated synthetic antiferromagnetic skyrmion systems based on [Pt/Co/Ru]2 bilayers. The antiferromagnetic skyrmions are demonstrated to be robust in these synthetic antiferromagnets under zero-field. Our first principal calculations and micromagnetic simulations demonstrate that the formation of the antiferromagnetic skyrmions are due to nonuniformity of RKKY coupling associated with the proximity effect induced magnetic moments in the Pt and Ru layers. The skyrmions in the Pt and Ru layers adjacent to the Co layers lead to the observed topological Hall effect. This work not only provides insight into the effect of the magnetic proximity effect and RKKY coupling to the SAF skyrmions, but also an effective detection method for the SAF skyrmion systems, thereby laying a foundation for the practical application of antiferromagnetic skyrmions in spintronic devices.

Title: A General Approach to the Shape Transition of Run-and-Tumble Particles: The 1D PDMP Framework for Invariant Measure Regularity
Authors: Leo Hahn
Abstract: Run-and-tumble particles (RTPs) have emerged as a paradigmatic example for studying nonequilibrium phenomena in statistical mechanics. The invariant measure of a wide class of RTPs subjected to a potential possesses a density that is continuous at high tumble rates but exhibits divergences at low ones. This key feature, known as shape transition, constitutes a qualitative indicator of the relative closeness (continuous density) or strong deviation (diverging density) from the equilibrium setting. Furthermore, the points at which the density diverges correspond to the configurations where the system spends most of its time in the low tumble rate regime. Building on and extending existing results concerning the regularity of the invariant measure of one-dimensional dynamical systems with random switching, we show how to characterize the shape transition even in situations where the invariant measure cannot be computed explicitly. Our analysis confirms shape transition as a robust, general feature of RTPs subjected to a potential. We also refine the regularity theory for the invariant measure of one-dimensional dynamical systems with random switching.

Title: A Heuristic Study of Temperature: Quantum Circuitry in Thermal Systems
Authors: HongZheng Liu, YiNuo Tian, Zhiyue Wu
Abstract: The singularities prevalent in classical thermodynamics largely stem from the "postulate of equal a priori probabilities" neglecting the physical constraints imposed by computational complexity. This paper introduces Complexity Window Thermodynamics (CWT), a framework that characterizes the observer's "ignorance" via a finite complexity budget, thereby naturally smoothing out singular behaviors associated with phase transitions and negative temperatures within this window. We derive a generalized First Law of Thermodynamics driven by a complexity generation potential, which incorporates "information processing work," and demonstrate a universal action-time bound constraining the growth of complexity. CWT not only offers a unified perspective on critical phenomena in condensed matter and the black hole information problem but also suggests that the total generatable complexity of the universe is comparable in order of magnitude to its holographic entropy. Thus, it paves a new pathway for a resource-theoretic unification of thermodynamics, quantum computation, and gravity.

Title: Dissipationless tune-out trapping for a lanthanide-alkali quantum gas mixture
Authors: Alexandre De Martino, Florian Kiesel, Jonas Auch, Kirill Karpov, Christian Gross
Abstract: Quantum gas mixtures offer a wide field of research, ranging from few-body physics of impurities to many-body physics with emergent long-range interactions and ultracold molecular gases. Achieving precision control of mixtures is much harder than for single-component gases and, consequently, the respective techniques are less developed. Here we report on a decisive step forward in this direction by realizing dissipationless and fully differential optical control of the motional degrees of freedom of one of the species without affecting the other. This is achieved in a novel Bose-Fermi mixture with extreme mass imbalance, erbium-166 and lithium-6. Our experiments pave the way to a new generation of precision many-body experiments with quantum gas mixtures with unprecedented long lifetimes and low temperatures.

Title: Unifying renormalized and bare viscosity in two-dimensional molecular dynamics simulations
Authors: Kazuma Yokota, Masato Itami, Shin-ichi Sasa
Abstract: Fluctuating hydrodynamics provides a framework connecting mesoscopic fluctuations with macroscopic transport behavior. To bridge mesoscopic and macroscopic transport from microscopic dynamics, we introduce a wavenumber-dependent viscosity, defined via the equilibrium correlation of time-averaged Fourier components of the fine-grained shear stress field, as a finite-wavevector extension of the Green--Kubo formula. Two-dimensional molecular dynamics simulations reveal its small-wavenumber divergence characteristic of the renormalized viscosity, while its large-wavenumber behavior determines the bare viscosity, thereby establishing a link between mesoscopic and macroscopic transport based on microscopic dynamics.

Title: Impact of electronic correlations on the superconductivity of high-pressure CeH$_9$
Authors: Siyu Chen, Yao Wei, Bartomeu Monserrat, Jan M. Tomczak, Samuel Poncé
Abstract: Rare-earth superhydrides have attracted considerable attention because of their high critical superconducting temperature under extreme pressures. They are known to have localized valence electrons, implying strong electronic correlations. However, such many-body effects are rarely included in first-principles studies of rare-earth superhydrides because of the complexity of their high-pressure phases. In this work, we use a combined density functional theory and dynamical mean-field theory approach to study both electrons and phonons in the prototypical rare-earth superhydride CeH$_9$, shedding light on the impact of electronic correlations on its critical temperature for phonon-mediated superconductivity. Our findings indicate that electronic correlations result in a larger electronic density at the Fermi level, a bigger superconducting gap, and softer vibrational modes associated with hydrogen atoms. Together, the inclusion of these correlation signatures increases the Migdal-Eliashberg superconducting critical temperature from 47 K to 96 K, close to the measured 95 K. Our results reconcile experimental observations and theoretical predictions for CeH$_9$ and herald a path towards the quantitative modeling of phonon-mediated superconductivity for interacting electron systems.

Title: External magnetic field suppression of carbon diffusion in iron
Authors: Luke J. Wirth, Dallas R. Trinkle (Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Illinois, USA)
Abstract: External magnetic fields reduce diffusion of carbon in BCC iron, but the physical mechanism is not understood. Using DFT calculations with magnetic moments sampled from a Heisenberg model, we calculate diffusivities of carbon in iron at high temperatures and with field. Our model reproduces the measured suppression of diffusivity from field. We find that increasing magnetic disorder flattens the electron density of states compared with the ferromagnetic case, which distorts the octahedral cages around carbon, lowering the activation barrier to diffusion; an applied field reverses these trends.

Title: Higher Chern bands in helical homotrilayer transition metal dichalcogenides
Authors: Jungho Daniel Choi, Nicolás Morales-Durán, Yves H. Kwan, Andrew J. Millis, Nicolas Regnault, Daniele Guerci
Abstract: We propose helically twisted homotrilayer transition metal dichalcogenides as a platform for realizing correlated topological phases of matter with higher and tunable Chern numbers. We show that a clear separation of scales emerges for small twist angles, allowing us to derive a low-energy continuum model that captures the physics within moiré-scale domains. We identify regimes of twist angle and displacement field for which the highest-lying hole band is isolated from other bands and is topological with $K$-valley Chern number $C=-2$. We demonstrate that varying the displacement field can induce a transition from $C=-2$ to $C=-1$, as well as from a topologically trivial band to a $C=-1$ band. We derive an effective tight-binding description for a high-symmetry stacking domain which is valid for a wide range of twist angles, and we show that the $C=-2$ band can remain stable at filling fraction $\nu=-1$ in the presence of interactions in Hartree-Fock calculations.

Title: Re-entrant unconventional superconductivity induced by rare-earth substitution in Nd1-xEuxNiO2 thin films
Authors: Dung Vu, Hangoo Lee, Daniele Nicoletti, Wenzheng Wei, Zheting Jin, Dmitry V. Chichinadze, Michele Buzzi, Wenxin Li, Xinhao Yang, Rongting Wu, Christopher A. Mizzi, Tiema Qian, Boris Maiorov, Alexey Suslov, Yu He, Cyprian Lewandowski, Sohrab Ismail-Beigi, Frederick Walker, Andrea Cavalleri, Charles Ahn
Abstract: High temperature superconductivity is typically associated with strong coupling and a large superconducting gap, yet these characteristics have not been demonstrated in the nickelates. Here, we provide experimental evidence that Eu substitution in the spacer layer of Nd1-xEuxNiO2 (NENO) thin films enhances the superconducting gap, driving the system toward a strong-coupling regime. This is accompanied by a magnetic-exchange-driven magnetic-field-enhanced superconductivity. We investigate the upper critical magnetic field, Hc2, and superconducting gap of superconducting NENO thin films with x=0.2 to 0.35. Magnetoresistance measurements reveal magnetic-field-enhanced superconductivity in NENO films. We interpret this phenomenon as a result of interaction between magnetic Eu ions and superconducting states in the Ni dx2-y2 orbital. The upper critical magnetic field strongly violates the weak-coupling Pauli limit. Infrared spectroscopy confirms a large gap-to-Tc ratio $2 \Delta k_B T_c \approx 5 - 6$, indicating a stronger coupling pairing mechanism in NENO relative to the Sr-doped NdNiO2. The substitution of Eu in the rare-earth layer provides a method to modify the superconducting gap in Nd-based nickelates, an essential factor in engineering high-Tc superconductivity in infinite-layer nickelates.

Title: Speeding up Brownian escape via intermediate finite potential barriers
Authors: Vishwajeet Kumar, Ohad Shpielberg, Arnab Pal
Abstract: The mean first-passage time (MFPT) for a Brownian particle to surmount a potential barrier of height $\Delta U$ is a fundamental quantity governing a wide array of physical and chemical processes. According to the Arrhenius Law, the MFPT typically grows exponentially with increasing barrier height, reflecting the rarity of thermally activated escape events. In this work, we demonstrate that the MFPT can be significantly reduced by reshaping the original single-barrier potential into a structured energy landscape comprising multiple intermediate barriers of lower heights, while keeping the total barrier height $\Delta U$ unchanged. Furthermore, this counterintuitive result holds across both linear and nonlinear potential profiles. Our findings suggest that tailoring the energy landscape -- by introducing well-placed intermediate barriers -- can serve as an effective control strategy to accelerate thermally activated transitions. These predictions are amenable to experimental validation using optical trapping techniques.

Title: Exchange tensors, generalized RKKY interactions, and magnetization dynamics in heterostructures of ferromagnets and topological insulators
Authors: Christian Svingen Johnsen, Asle Sudbø
Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical analysis of magnetic heterostructures composed of ferromagnetic (FM) layers interfaced with three-dimensional topological insulators (TIs). Integrating out the topological surface states and computing the spin determinant to second order in spins, we derive the effective generalized Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) exchange interactions mediated by topological surface states. These interactions inherently incorporate spin-momentum locking and anisotropic spin susceptibilities stemming from the Dirac-like dispersion of the TI surface electrons. The analysis reveals that the interplay between the spin-orbit coupling intrinsic to the TI and the magnetization in the FM layer induces highly nonlocal and retarded, chiral, and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM)-like contributions to the effective spin Hamiltonian. Furthermore, the spin dynamics is studied through a derivation of the LLG equation for this problem. The induced interactions renormalize many of the FM's intrinsic properties, but a new term in the LLG equation is induced that is related to the rate of change of the magnetization's curl, which is relevant to skyrmion dynamics. The magnon dispersion exhibits modifications due to the TI-mediated interactions, including a softened inertial spin-wave mode and tunable magnon gaps, sensitive to a tunable chemical potential and interfacial exchange coupling strength. The results also apply to finite temperatures. They elucidate topologically induced magnetic phenomena and pave the way for engineering exotic spin textures, such as skyrmions and chiral domain walls, in TI-FM hybrid systems with tunable interactions.

Title: Domain Boundaries in a Metallic Distortive Polar Metal

Abstract: Polar metals are an underexplored material class combining two properties that are typically incompatible, namely a polar crystal structure and reasonable electrical conductivity. These intriguing materials offer a unique combination of properties, potentially relevant to optoelectronics, catalysis, memory devices, among other applications. The distortive polar metal (DPM) subclass forms through a symmetry-lifting phase transformation into a non-centrosymmetric polar crystal structure. In the process, domains with uniform geometric polar directions form, oftentimes separated by domain boundaries with polarity discontinuities arranged in "charged" head-to-head (H-H) or tail-to-tail (T-T) morphologies. To date, only metallic oxide DPM microstructures have been studied. Here we reveal, in the intermetallic DPM Mn$_{5}$Al$_{8}$, different surface interactions and electron transfer reactivity at domain boundaries depending on their H-H or T-T character. Variable surface reactivity suggests localized changes in electronic work functions due to an increase (H-H) or decrease (T-T) in the electronic density of states. These findings suggest that metallic DPMs may offer functionalizable domain boundaries and deserve increased attention, given that they allow tunable chemistries and various thermomechanical processing or transformation protocols. Ultimately, this study proposes unconventional metal physics, propelling the discovery and design of advanced electronic materials and devices.

Title: Ferroelectricity-driven altermagnetism in two-dimensional van der Waals multiferroics
Authors: Bo Zhao, Fu Li, Wei Ren, Hao Wang, Hongbin Zhang
Abstract: Altermagnets (AMs) are a recently identified class of unconventional collinear compensated antiferromagnets that exhibit momentum-dependent spin splitting despite having zero net magnetization. This unconventional magnetic order gives rise to a range of phenomena, including the anomalous Hall effect, chiral magnons, and nonlinear photocurrents. Here, using spin space group (SSG) symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations, we demonstrate an efficient strategy to control altermagnetism in two-dimensional multiferroics through ferroelectric polarization and interlayer sliding. For material realization, we find that monolayer and bilayer FeCuP2S6 exhibit finite spin splitting when ferroelectric sublattices are connected by nonsymmorphic screw-axis operations rather than pure translation or inversion symmetry. Interlayer sliding further enables reversible switching or suppression of spin splitting through modifications of the SSG. Our calculations further reveal that the anomalous Hall response serves as a direct probe of these spin-split states. These findings establish two-dimensional van der Waals multiferroics as promising platforms for realizing electrically controllable altermagnetism and advancing next-generation spintronic and magnetoelectric technologies.

Title: On the supra-linear storage in dense networks of grid and place cells
Authors: Adriano Barra, Martino S. Centonze, Michela Marra Solazzo, Daniele Tantari
Abstract: Place-cell networks, typically forced to pairwise synaptic interactions, are widely studied as models of cognitive maps: such models, however, share a severely limited storage capacity, scaling linearly with network size and with a very small critical storage. This limitation is a challenge for navigation in 3-dimensional space because, oversimplifying, if encoding motion along a one-dimensional trajectory embedded in 2-dimensions requires $O(K)$ patterns (interpreted as bins), extending this to a 2-dimensional manifold embedded in a 3-dimensional space -- yet preserving the same resolution -- requires roughly $O(K^2)$ patterns, namely a supra-linear amount of patterns. In these regards, dense Hebbian architectures, where higher-order neural assemblies mediate memory retrieval, display much larger capacities and are increasingly recognized as biologically plausible, but have never linked to place cells so far. Here we propose a minimal two-layer model, with place cells building a layer and leaving the other layer populated by neural units that account for the internal representations (so to qualitatively resemble grid cells in the MEC of mammals): crucially, by assuming that each place cell interacts with pairs of grid cells, we show how such a model is formally equivalent to a dense Battaglia-Treves-like Hebbian network of grid cells only endowed with four-body interactions. By studying its emergent computational properties by means of statistical mechanics of disordered systems, we prove -- analytically -- that such effective higher-order assemblies (constructed under the guise of biological plausibility) can support supra-linear storage of continuous attractors; furthermore, we prove -- numerically -- that the present neural network is capable of recognition and navigation on general surfaces embedded in a 3-dimensional space.

Title: Electrical conductivity of randomly placed linear wires: a mean field approach
Authors: Yuri Yu. Tarasevich, Andrei V. Eserkepov, Irina V. Vodolazskaya
Abstract: Using the mean-field approximation, a formula for the effective electrical conductivity of a two-dimensional system of randomly arranged conducting sticks with a given orientation distribution was obtained. Both the resistance of the sticks themselves and the resistance of the contacts between them were taken into account. The accuracy in the resulting formula was analyzed. A comparison of the theoretical predictions of mean-field approach with the results of direct electrical conductivity calculations for several model orientation distributions describing systems with crossed sticks demonstrated good agreement. Our study showed that cross-alignment of nanowires should lead to a decreasing in the electrical conductivity compared to electrodes with isotropically arranged nanowires. We suppose that the widely used model with zero-width sticks is quite acceptable for systems of cross-aligned nanowires, but overestimates their connectivity in isotropic systems. Thus, the enhancement of the electrical conductivity of conducting films with cross-aligned nanowires may be due to a significant difference in the network topology.

Title: Accelerated Prediction of Temperature-Dependent Lattice Thermal Conductivity via Ensembled Machine Learning Models
Authors: Piyush Paliwal, Aftab Alam
Abstract: Lattice thermal conductivity ($\kappa_L$) is a key physical property governing heat transport in solids, with direct relevance to thermoelectrics, thermal barrier coatings, and heat management applications. However, while experimental determination of $\kappa_L$ is challenging, its theoretical calculation via ab initio methods particularly using density functional theory (DFT) is computationally intensive, often more demanding than electronic transport calculations by an order of magnitude. In this work, we present a machine learning (ML) approach to predict $\kappa_L$ with DFT-level accuracy over a wide temperature range (100-1000 K). Among various models trained on DFT-calculated data obtained from literature, the Extra Trees Regressor (ETR) yielded the best performance on log-scaled $\kappa_L$, achieving an average $R^2$ of 0.9994 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.0466 $W\,m^{-1}\,K^{-1}$. The ETR model also generalized well to twelve previously unseen (randomly chosen) low and high $\kappa_L$ compounds with diverse space group symmetries, reaching an $R^2$ of 0.961 against DFT benchmarks. Notably, the model excels in predicting $\kappa_L$ for both low- and high-symmetry compounds, enabling efficient high-throughput screening. We also demonstrate this capability by screening ultralow and ultrahigh $\kappa_L$ candidates among 960 half-Heusler compounds and 60,000 ICSD compounds from the AFLOW database. This result shows reliability of model developed for screening of potential thermoelectric materials. At the end, we have tested model's prediction ability on systems that have experimental $\kappa_L$ available that shows model's ability to search material that has desirable experimental $\kappa_L$ for thermoelectric applications.

Title: Pressure-Induced B1 to B2 Phase Transition in CeN Studied by ab initio Correlation Matrix Renormalization Theory Calculations
Authors: Jun Liu, Jianhua Zhang, Yongxin Yao, Kai-Ming Ho, Cai-Zhuang Wang
Abstract: We apply correlation matrix renormalization theory (CMRT) to cerium nitride (CeN) under pressure. For B1 (NaCl-type) phase, CMRT gives an equation of state consistent with ambient pressure experiments. It produces electronic density-of-state (DOS) characterized by a sharp 4f quasi-particle resonance peak pinned at the Fermi level and two subbands formed by strong hybridization between the localized Ce-4f electrons and the itinerant Ce-5d and N-2p electrons below the Fermi level, consistent with XPS experiments. Upon compression, CMRT predicts a first-order B1 to B2 (CsCl-type) transition with ~11% volume collapse in agreement with experiments. Across the transition, the 4f spectral weight broadens, the 4f orbital occupancy increases, and the hybridization with conduction states enhances, signaling a crossover from partially localized to more itinerant 4f behavior. These features are in excellent agreement with experimental observations, demonstrating that CMRT provides a parameter-free description and prediction of correlation-driven structural and electronic transitions in rare-earth compounds.

Title: Moiré-induced gapped phases in twisted nodal superconductors
Authors: Kevin P. Lucht, J. H. Pixley, Pavel A. Volkov
Abstract: We demonstrate the emergence of gapped phases driven by the moiré superlattice that trivialize the topological states in twisted nodal superconductors. The effect arises from umklapp tunneling between non-adjacent Dirac points in momentum space close to specific twist angles or chemical potentials, determined by the Fermi surface geometry. We confirm the robustness of the non-topological phase against interactions with self-consistent calculations and show that this gap competes with the previously predicted topological gapped phases, leading to topological phase transitions. These transitions were overlooked in prior literature, signifying the necessity of modifying the phase diagrams of topological phases exhibited in twisted nodal superconductors with and without an interlayer current. We also estimate the relevant twist angles and discuss experimental signatures, focusing on twisted Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$

Title: Noise-induced resonant acceleration of a charge in an intermittent magnetic field: an exact solution for ergodic and non-ergodic fluctuations
Authors: Gerardo Aquino, Mauro Bologna
Abstract: We study the diffusion of a charged particle in a magnetic field subject to stochastic dichotomous fluctuations. The associated induced electric field gives rise to non-trivial dynamical regimes. In particular, when the mean magnetic field vanishes, the particle remains confined within a finite radius, regardless of the fluctuation statistics. For a non-zero mean field, we shows, using a density approach for Poissonian fluctuations, that the particle undergoes an exponential regime of accelerated diffusion. Crucially and more generally, adopting a trajectory-based formalism, we derive an exact analytical solution valid for arbitrary waiting-time distributions, including non-Poissonian and non-ergodic cases. Even rare, abrupt field reversal are shown to trigger exponential acceleration of the particle's diffusion. We demonstrate that this behaviour stems from noise exciting resonance bands present for periodic fluctuations, and we propose noise-induced resonant acceleration as a robust and efficient charge acceleration mechanism, potentially more effective than Fermi's classic model for cosmic acceleration.

Title: Neural optimization of the most probable paths of 3D active Brownian particles
Authors: Bin Zheng, Zhongqiang Xiong, Changhao Li, Zhanglin Hou, Ziluo Zhang, Xinpeng Xu, Li-Shing Lin, Kenta Ishimoto, Kento Yasuda, Shigeyuki Komura
Abstract: We develop a variational neural-network framework to determine the most probable path (MPP) of a 3D active Brownian particle (ABP) by directly minimizing the Onsager-Machlup integral (OMI). To obtain the OMI, we use the Onsager-Machlup variational principle for active systems and construct the Rayleighian of the ABP by including its active power. This approach reveals geometric transitions of the MPP from in-plane I- and U-shaped paths to 3D helical paths as the final time and net displacement are varied. We also demonstrate that the initial and final boundary conditions have a significant impact on the MPPs. Our results show that neural optimization combined with the Onsager-Machlup variational principle provides an efficient and versatile framework for exploring optimal transition pathways in active and nonequilibrium systems.

Title: Quasiparticle states of hexagonal BN: A van der Waals density functional study
Authors: Raul Quintero-Monsebaiz, Per Hyldgaard
Abstract: We compute and track the impact of truly nonlocal-correlation effects on the quasi-particle (QP) band-structure of hexagonal boron-nitride (h-BN) systems. To that end, we start with the consistent-exchange vdW-DF-cx version [PRB 89, 035412 (2014)] of the van der Waals density functional (vdW-DF) method [JPCM 39, 390001 (2020)] for exchange-correlation (XC) functional design and enforce piece-wise linearity in the energy changes with partial charging, using the Koopmans-integer (KI) DFT framework [JCTC 19, 7079 (2023)]. Our approach and results (denoted KI-CX) extends present-standard use of KI DFT (denoted KI-PBE as it is based on the semilocal PBE [PRL 77, 3865 (1996)] XC functional) to capture, for example, the impact of the interlayer coupling on the QPs. We contrast KI-CX and KI-PBE results for the QP band-structure and compare with both $GW$ calculations and experimental observations of the (direct and indirect) QP gaps. We find that KI-CX brings improvements in the h-BN QP energy description and generally agrees with $GW$ studies.

Title: The critical O(N) CFT: Methods and conformal data
Authors: Johan Henriksson
Abstract: The critical $O(N)$ CFT in spacetime dimensions $2 < d < 4$ is one of the most important examples of a conformal field theory, with the Ising CFT at $N=1$, $2 \leq d < 4$, as a notable special case. Apart from numerous physical applications, it serves frequently as a concrete testing ground for new approaches and techniques based on conformal symmetry. In the perturbative limits - the $4-\varepsilon$ expansion, the large $N$ expansion and the $2+\tilde\epsilon$ expansion - a lot of conformal data have been computed over the years. In this report, we give an overview of the critical $O(N)$ CFT, including some methods to study it, and present a large collection of conformal data. The data, extracted from the literature and supplemented by many additional computations of order $\varepsilon$ anomalous dimensions, are made available through an ancillary data file.

Title: Estimating Global Input Relevance and Enforcing Sparse Representations with a Scalable Spectral Neural Network Approach
Authors: Lorenzo Chicchi, Lorenzo Buffoni, Diego Febbe, Lorenzo Giambagli, Raffaele Marino, Duccio Fanelli
Abstract: In machine learning practice it is often useful to identify relevant input features. Isolating key input elements, ranked according their respective degree of relevance, can help to elaborate on the process of decision making. Here, we propose a novel method to estimate the relative importance of the input components for a Deep Neural Network. This is achieved by leveraging on a spectral re-parametrization of the optimization process. Eigenvalues associated to input nodes provide in fact a robust proxy to gauge the relevance of the supplied entry features. Notably, the spectral features ranking is performed automatically, as a byproduct of the network training, with no additional processing to be carried out. Moreover, by leveraging on the regularization of the eigenvalues, it is possible to enforce solutions making use of a minimum subset of the input components, increasing the explainability of the model and providing sparse input representations. The technique is compared to the most common methods in the literature and is successfully challenged against both synthetic and real data.

Title: Entanglement behavior and localization properties in monitored fermion systems
Authors: Giulia Piccitto, Giuliano Chiriacò, Davide Rossini, Angelo Russomanno
Abstract: We study the asymptotic bipartite entanglement in various integrable and nonintegrable models of monitored fermions. We find that, for the integrable cases, the entanglement versus the system size is well fitted, over more than one order of magnitude, by a function interpolating between a linear and a power-law behavior. Up to the sizes we are able to reach, a logarithmic growth of the entanglement can be also captured by the same fit with a very small power-law exponent. We thus propose a characterization of the various entanglement phases using the fitting parameters. For the nonintegrable cases, as the staggered t-V and the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) models, the numerics prevents us from spanning different orders of magnitude in the size, therefore we fit the asymptotic entanglement versus the measurement strength and then look at the scaling with the size of the fitting parameters. We find two different behaviors: for the SYK we observe a volume-law growth, while for the t-V model some traces of an entanglement transition emerge. In the latter models, we study the localization properties in the Hilbert space through the inverse participation ratio, finding an anomalous delocalization with no relation with the entanglement properties. Finally, we show that our function fits very well the fermionic logarithmic negativity of a quadratic model in ladder geometry with stroboscopic projective measurements.

Title: Topological Phase Transition and Geometrical Frustration in Fourier Photonic Simulator
Authors: Yuxuan Sun, Weiru Fan, Xingqi Xu, Da-Wei Wang, Hai-Qing Lin
Abstract: XY models with continuous spin orientation play a pivotal role in understanding topological phase transitions and emergent frustration phenomena, such as superconducting and superfluid phase transitions. However, the complex energy landscapes arising from frustrated lattice geometries and competing spin interactions make these models computationally intractable. To address this challenge, we design a programmable photonic spin simulator capable of emulating XY models with tunable lattice geometries and spin couplings, allowing systematic exploration of their statistical behavior. We experimentally observe the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition in a square-lattice XY model with nearest-neighbor interactions, accurately determining its critical temperature. Expanding to frustrated systems, we implement the approach in triangular and honeycomb lattices, uncovering sophisticated phase transitions and frustration effects, which are consistent with theoretical predictions. This versatile platform opens avenues for probing unexplored XY model phenomena across diverse geometries and interaction schemes, with potential applications in solving complex optimization and machine learning problems.

Title: Transfer of quantum-enhanced information through a many-body system
Authors: Piotr Wysocki, Marcin Płodzień, Jan Chwedeńczuk
Abstract: Forthcoming quantum devices will require high-fidelity information transfer across a many-body system. We formulate the criterion for lossless signal propagation and show that a single qubit can play the role of an antenna, collecting large amounts of information from a complex system. We derive the condition under which the antenna, far from the source and embedded in a many-body interacting medium, can still collect the complete information. A striking feature of this setup is that a single qubit antenna can receive even the full signal amplified by the entanglement of the source. As a consequence, the recovery of this information can be performed with simple single-qubit operations on the antenna (which we fully characterize) rather than with multi-qubit measurements of the source. Finally, we discuss the control of the system parameters necessary for lossless signal propagation. A method discussed here could improve the precision of quantum devices and simplify metrological protocols.

Title: High-temperature partition functions and classical simulatability of long-range quantum systems
Authors: Jorge Sánchez-Segovia, Jan T. Schneider, Álvaro M. Alhambra
Abstract: Long-range quantum systems, in which the interactions decay as $1/r^{\alpha}$, are of increasing interest due to the variety of experimental set-ups in which they naturally appear. Motivated by this, we study fundamental properties of long-range spin systems in thermal equilibrium, focusing on the weak regime of $ \alpha>D$. Our main result is a proof of analiticity of their partition functions at high temperatures, which allows us to construct a classical algorithm with sub-exponential runtime $\exp(\mathcal{O}(\log^2(N/\epsilon)))$ that approximates the log-partition function to small additive error $\epsilon$. As by-products, we establish the equivalence of ensembles and the Gaussianity of the density of states, which we verify numerically in both the weak and strong long-range regimes. This also yields constraints on the appearance of various classes of phase transitions, including thermal, dynamical and excited-state ones. Our main technical contribution is the extension to the quantum long-range regime of the convergence criterion for cluster expansions of Kotecký and Preiss.

Title: Nuclear Spin-Mediated Relaxation Mechanisms of the V$_{B}^-$ Center in hBN
Authors: Chanaprom Cholsuk, Tobias Vogl, Viktor Ivády
Abstract: The negatively charged boron vacancy $V_B^-$ defect in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has recently emerged as a promising spin qubit for sensing due to its high-temperature spin control and versatile integration into van der Waals structures. While extensive experiments have explored their coherence properties, much less is known about the spin relaxation time $T_1$ and its control-parameter dependence. In this work, we develop a parameter-free spin dynamics model based on the cluster-expansion technique to investigate $T_1$ relaxation mechanisms at low temperature. Our results reveal that the $V_B^-$ center constitutes a strongly coupled electron spin-nuclear spin core, which necessitates the inclusion of the coherent dynamics and derived memory effects of the three nearest-neighbor nitrogen nuclear spins. Using this framework, this work closely reproduces the experimentally observed $T_1$ time at $B = 90\,\mathrm{G}$ and further predicts the $T_1$ dependence on external magnetic field in the $0 \le B \le 2000\,\mathrm{G}$ interval, when the spin relaxation is predominantly driven by electron-nuclear and nuclear-nuclear flip-flop processes mediated by hyperfine and dipolar interactions. This study establishes a reliable and scalable approach for describing $T_1$ relaxation in $V_B^-$ centers and offers microscopic insights to support future developments in nuclear-spin-based quantum technologies.

Title: Complexity in multi-qubit and many-body systems
Authors: Imre Varga
Abstract: Characterizing complexity and criticality in quantum systems requires diagnostics that are both computationally tractable and physically insightful. We introduce a measure of quantum state complexity for n-qubit systems, defined as the divergence between the Shannon or von Neumann entropy of the computational basis distribution and the second-order Rényi entropy. This quantity is particularly powerful as the latter Rényi entropy is directly related to state purity, linear entropy, and the inverse participation ratio, providing a clear physical grounding. While other Rényi orders could be used, the second order offers a deep and established connection to these key physical quantities. We first validate the measure in canonical noise channels, showing it peaks at the boundary between quantum and classical regimes. We then demonstrate its power in many-body physics. For systems exhibiting a many-body localization transition - including deformed random matrix ensembles and a disordered Heisenberg spin chain - the complexity measure reliably signals the crossover from integrable/localized to quantum-chaotic/ergodic phases. Crucially, the maximum complexity occurs in the non-ergodic yet extended states at the transition, precisely capturing the critical region where the system is neither fully localized nor thermalized. Furthermore, within the chaotic phase, the measure correlates with the survival probability of local excitations, revealing a spectrum of thermalization properties. Our results establish that the entropic complexity is a simple, versatile, and effective probe for identifying nontrivial quantum regimes and transitions giving a new and alternative insight into such systems.

Title: Numerically "exact" charge transport dynamics in a dissipative electron-phonon model rationalizing the success of the transient localization scenario
Authors: Veljko Janković
Abstract: Optical conductivity in molecular semiconductors is suppressed in the terahertz region, featuring the displaced Drude peak that reflects carriers' transient localization (TL) by slow intermolecular vibrations. Meanwhile, recent computations in minimal models evidence optical-conductivity enhancements below the characteristic vibrational frequency, which cannot be captured by the TL phenomenology. These models assume that the carrier's hopping amplitude is modulated by a single undamped vibration. The modulation is, however, by many low-frequency modes, whose net effect can be approximated using a few effective damped oscillators. Here, we employ the dissipaton equations of motion (DEOM) method to compute the finite-temperature real-time current autocorrelation function in a one-dimensional model with Brownian-oscillator spectral density of nonlocal carrier-phonon interaction. We exploit the dissipaton algebra to handle the phonon-assisted current, reduce the method's computational requirements by working in momentum space, and confirm that numerically stable transport dynamics are virtually independent of a specific DEOM closing scheme. With increasing damping, we find that DEOM optical-conductivity profiles become increasingly qualitatively similar to TL predictions. For parameters representative of room-temperature hole transport in single-crystal rubrene, we conclude that the TL phenomenology is established already in the underdamped-oscillator regime. Reasonable variations in the damping constant weakly affect the carrier mobility, which remains within experimental bounds. Overall, our results strongly suggest that optical-conductivity enhancements at very low frequencies are artifacts of the assumed delta-like phonon spectrum and rationalize the success of the TL phenomenology in describing experimental data.

Title: Genuine multi-entropy, dihedral invariants and Lifshitz theory
Authors: Clément Berthière, Paul Gaudin
Abstract: Multi-invariants are local-unitary invariants of state replicas introduced as potential probes of multipartite entanglement and correlations in quantum many-body systems. In this paper, we investigate two multi-invariants for tripartite pure states, namely multi-entropy and dihedral invariant. We compute the (genuine) multi-entropy for Lifshitz groundstates, and obtain its analytical continuation to noninteger values of Rényi index. We show that the genuine multi-entropy can be expressed in terms of mutual information and logarithmic negativity, a relation that also holds for stabilizer states. For general tripartite pure states, we demonstrate that dihedral invariants are related to Rényi reflected entropies. In particular, we show that the dihedral permutations of replicas are equivalent to the reflected construction, or alternatively to the realignment of density matrices.

Title: Theory for the spectral splitting exponent of exceptional points
Authors: Shu-Xuan Wang, Zhongbo Yan
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs), singularities in non-Hermitian systems where eigenvalues and eigenstates coalesce, exhibit a dramatically enhanced response to perturbations compared to Hermitian degeneracies. This makes them exceptional candidates for sensing applications. The spectral splitting of an $N$th-order EP scales with perturbation strength $\epsilon$ over a wide range, from $\epsilon$ to $\epsilon^{1/N}$. Although the exact scaling exponent can be determined in principle by solving the characteristic equation, this approach becomes analytically intractable for large $N$ and often fails to yield useful physical insight. In this work, we develop a theory to directly predict the scaling exponent from the matrix positions of the perturbation. By using the Jordan block structure of the unperturbed Hamiltonian, we show that the splitting exponent can be analytically determined when the matrix positions of the perturbation satisfy some specific conditions. Our analytical framework provides a useful design principle for engineering perturbations to achieve a desired spectral response, facilitating the development of EP-based sensors.

Title: How LLMs Learn to Reason: A Complex Network Perspective
Authors: Sihan Hu, Xiansheng Cai, Yuan Huang, Zhiyuan Yao, Linfeng Zhang, Pan Zhang, Youjin Deng, Kun Chen
Abstract: Training large language models with Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) exhibits a set of distinctive and puzzling behaviors that remain poorly understood, including a two-stage learning curve, a V-shaped response-length trajectory, and a pronounced vulnerability to catastrophic forgetting. In this work, we propose that these behaviors are emergent collective phenomena governed not by neural implementation details, but by the topological evolution of the latent reasoning graph in semantic space. By demonstrating a dynamical isomorphism between a 1.5B-parameter LLM and a minimal Concept Network Model (CoNet), we trace the causal source to the self-organization of a sparse concept web pinned to an average degree of two. This geometric perspective provides a unified physical explanation for the observed anomalies: the V-shaped trajectory tracks the evolution from parallel local skill optimization to global network integration; catastrophic forgetting stems from the topological disconnection of critical ``trunk'' edges; and policy collapse arises from the accumulation of sequential transitions at the web's leaf nodes, where broad exploration abruptly freezes into rigid, high-reward trajectories. Identifying a ``maximally frustrated state'' at the transition between learning stages, we propose Annealed-RLVR, a principled algorithm that injects a targeted SFT ``heating'' step to resolve this topological bottleneck. Experiments confirm that this theory-driven intervention outperforms standard RLVR on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution benchmarks (including Minerva and AIME). By recasting RLVR from black-box optimization into a predictable process of structural self-organization, our work provides a new physical intuition for engineering the emergent reasoning capabilities of future AI systems.

Title: From single-particle to many-body chaos in Yukawa--SYK: theory and a cavity-QED proposal
Authors: David Pascual Solis, Alex Windey, Soumik Bandyopadhyay, Andrea Legramandi, Philipp Hauke
Abstract: Understanding how quantum systems transition from integrable to fully chaotic behavior remains a central open problem in physics. The Sachdev--Ye--Kitaev (SYK) model provides a paradigmatic framework for studying many-body chaos and holography, yet it captures only the strongly correlated limit, leaving intermediate regimes unexplored. Here, we investigate the Yukawa--SYK (YSYK) model, where bosonic fields mediate random fermionic interactions, and demonstrate that it naturally bridges single-particle and many-body chaos. Using spectral and dynamical chaos markers, we perform a comprehensive finite-size characterization of the YSYK model. We show that the interaction strength acts as a tunable control parameter interpolating between the SYK$_2$ and SYK$_4$ limits, and introduce a framework enabling direct and quantitative comparison with these benchmark models. In the intermediate regimes, we uncover distinct dynamical regimes marked by partial ergodicity breaking, prethermalization plateaus, and incomplete scrambling. Finally, we propose a feasible optical-cavity implementation of the YSYK model using ultra-cold atoms. Our results establish the YSYK model as a unifying platform connecting single-particle and many-body chaos, paving the way for experimental observation of these phenomena.
