Title: Pair density modulation from glide symmetry breaking and nematic superconductivity
Authors: Micha≈Ç Papaj, Lingyuan Kong, Stevan Nadj-Perge, Patrick A. Lee
Abstract: Pair density modulation is a superconducting state, recently observed in exfoliated iron-based superconductor flakes, in which the superconducting gap oscillates strongly with the same periodicity as the underlying crystalline lattice. We propose a microscopic model that explains this modulation through a combination of glide-mirror symmetry breaking and the emergence of nematic superconductivity. The first ingredient results in a sublattice texture on the Fermi surface, which is aligned with the anisotropic superconducting gap of the nematic $s_\pm+d$ state. This gives rise to distinctive gap maxima and minima located on the two inequivalent iron sublattices while still being a zero-momentum pairing state. We discuss how further investigation of such modulations can give insight into the nature of the superconducting pairing, such as the signs of the order parameters and visualization of a phase transition to a mixed two-component state using local probes.

Title: Geometrically Frustrated Quadrupoles on the Pyrochlore Lattice and Generalized Spin Liquids
Authors: Kristian Tyn Kai Chung, Sylvain Petit, Julien Robert, Paul McClarty
Abstract: As an instance of geometrical frustration with non-magnetic degrees of freedom, we explore the physics of local spin $S\geq 1$ moments on the pyrochlore lattice that interact via pure quadrupolar couplings. In the presence of spin-orbit coupling, there are nine allowed couplings between nearest neighbor quadrupoles. We determine the semi-classical phases and survey the phase diagram of the model. One may view the Hamiltonian as being composed of two copies of the well-studied dipolar model with couplings between the copies, and we find that each easy-plane dipolar phase has two quadrupolar counterparts. As geometrical frustration is important over broad swathes of the parameter space, there are many classical quadrupolar liquids and regions with order-by-disorder selection of discrete states. Order-by-disorder with quadrupoles admits cubic terms in the Landau theory whose effects appear in Monte Carlo simulations and flavor wave calculations for fixed spin $S$. We showcase a number of examples of quadrupolar spin liquids, including one realizing a rank-3 symmetric tensor gauge theory exhibiting 6-fold pinch point singularities. We discuss remarkable differences between the quadrupolar physics of different spin quantum number. We also discuss connections to the non-Kramers rare earth pyrochlore materials.

Title: Topological Phase Transition under Infinite Randomness
Authors: Saikat Mondal, Adhip Agarwala
Abstract: In clean and weakly disordered systems, topological and trivial phases having a finite bulk energy gap can transit to each other via a quantum critical point. In presence of strong disorder, both the nature of the phases and the associated criticality can fundamentally change. Here we investigate topological properties of a strongly disordered fermionic chain where the bond couplings are drawn from normal probability distributions which are defined by characteristic standard deviations. Using numerical strong disorder renormalization group methods along with analytical techniques, we show that the competition between fluctuation scales renders both the trivial and topological phases gapless with Griffiths like rare regions. Moreover, the transition between these phases is solely governed by the fluctuation scales, rather than the means, rendering the critical behavior to be determined by an infinite randomness fixed point with an irrational central charge. Our work points to a host of novel topological phases and atypical topological phase transitions which can be realized in systems under strong disorder.

Title: Error-resilient Reversal of Quantum Chaotic Dynamics Enabled by Scramblons
Authors: Yu-Chen Li, Tian-Gang Zhou, Shengyu Zhang, Ze Wu, Liqiang Zhao, Haochuan Yin, Xiaoxue An, Hui Zhai, Pengfei Zhang, Xinhua Peng
Abstract: The emergence of the arrow of time in quantum many-body systems stems from the inherent tendency of Hamiltonian evolution to scramble quantum information and increase entanglement. While, in principle, one might counteract this temporal directionality by engineering a perfectly inverted Hamiltonian to reverse entanglement growth, such a scenario is fundamentally unstable because even minor imperfections in the backward evolution can be exponentially amplified, a hallmark of quantum many-body chaos. Therefore, successfully reversing quantum many-body dynamics demands a deep understanding of the underlying structure of quantum information scrambling and chaotic dynamics. Here, by using solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance on a macroscopic ensemble of randomly interacting spins, we measure the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC) and validate key predictions of scramblon theory, a universal theoretical framework for information scrambling. Crucially, this theory enables us to isolate and mitigate errors in the OTOC caused by imperfections in the backward evolution. As a result, this protocol uncovers the anticipated exponential behavior of quantum many-body chaos and extracts the quantum Lyapunov exponent in a many-body experimental system for the first time. Our results push the fundamental limits of dynamical reversibility of complex quantum systems, with implications for quantum simulation and metrology.

Title: Zero Temperature Dynamics of Ising Systems on Hypercubes
Authors: Ruixin Chen, Jonathan Machta, Charles M. Newman, Daniel L. Stein
Abstract: We study the zero-temperature Glauber dynamics of homogeneous Ising ferromagnets on hypercubes, as their dimension d varies. We investigate the asymptotic (d goes to infinity and time t goes to infinity) behavior of various quantities on hypercubes, such as the final magnetization, the probability for the system to enter a ground state, etc. Our numerical studies are carried out using a uniformly random initial state but with the constraint that the initial magnetization is zero. The final states can be divided into three categories: ground states, frozen states, and blinker states. We use the notion of a k-core to describe the geometry of the frozen states and give an exponential lower bound for the number of frozen states in terms of d. Blinker states -- which exist only in even d -- are final states containing at least one blinker (a permanently flipping spin). Blinker states can have rich local structures; we give explicit constructions for configurations that contain blinkers and prove that the lowest possible dimension for blinker configurations is d = 8. We also study the 'Nature vs. Nurture' problem on hypercubes, asking how much the final state depends on the information contained in the initial configuration, and how much depends on the realization of the dynamical evolution. Finally, we provide several conjectures and suggest some open problems based on the numerical results.

Title: Modeling Finite Deformations in Alloying Electrodes -- A Closer Look at Cracks and Pores During Phase Transformation
Authors: Delin Zhang, Yu-Cheng Lai, Kodi Thurber, Kai Smith, Johanna N. Weker, Sarah Tolbert, Ananya Renuka Balakrishna
Abstract: Nanostructured electrodes with voids or interconnected pores accommodate large volume changes, shorten ion diffusion pathways, and enhance the structural reversibility of alloying electrodes. While these nanoporous features improve the performance of architected electrodes over bulk electrodes, they also act as geometric irregularities that localize and concentrate internal stresses. In this work, we investigate the hierarchical interplay between phase boundaries and nanoporous features at the microstructural scale and their collective role in mitigating chemo-mechanical failure at the engineering scale. Using Sb$\to$Li$_2$Sb$\to$Li$_3$Sb as a model system, we develop a continuum framework coupling lithium diffusion and reaction kinetics with the finite deformation of alloying electrodes. We analytically show that large volume changes in the Sb$\rightarrow$Li$_2$Sb transformation induce fracture, which nanoporous geometries can mitigate. Building on this, we develop a micromechanical model using a hyper-elastic neo-Hookean material law to predict the deformations accompanying the Li$_2$Sb$\to$Li$_3$Sb transformation. Our results reveal how diffusion and reaction kinetics shape phase boundary morphology, identify crack geometries likely to propagate, and show how carefully architected electrodes relieve stresses. These findings highlight critical design principles to optimize electrode lifespan and demonstrate a potential application of our continuum model as an electrode design tool.

Title: Boron Fullerenes: From Theoretical Predictions to Experimental Reality
Authors: Nevill Gonzalez Szwacki
Abstract: We present a comprehensive first-principles investigation of boron fullerenes and two-dimensional boron sheets, unified under a coordination-based framework. By classifying over a dozen boron nanostructures, including B$_{12}$, B$_{40}$, B$_{65}$, B$_{80}$, and B$_{92}$, according to their local atomic environments (4-, 5-, and 6-fold coordination), we identify clear trends in structural stability, electronic properties, and magnetism. A universal energetic scaling relation $E_c(n) = a/n^b + E_c^{sheet}$ (with $b \approx 1$) captures the convergence of fullerene cohesive energies toward those of 2D boron phases. Notably, we establish one-to-one structural correspondences between select cages and experimentally accessible borophenes: B$_{40}$ mirrors the $\chi_3$-sheet, B$_{65}$ the $\beta_{12}$-sheet, B$_{80}$ the $\alpha$-sheet, and B$_{92}$ the $bt$-sheet. These clusters also exhibit large HOMO-LUMO gaps (e.g., $E_g = 1.78$ eV for B$_{40}$, 1.14 eV for B$_{92}$), contrasting with the metallicity of their 2D counterparts and, in the case of B$_{65}$, spontaneous spin polarization ($M = 3 \, \mu_B$). Our findings provide a predictive strategy for designing boron nanostructures by leveraging coordination fingerprints, and are further validated by the recent experimental synthesis of the B$_{80}$ cage. This work bridges zero- and two-dimensional boron chemistry, offering a roadmap for the future synthesis and application of boron-based materials.

Title: Epitaxial Stabilization and Emergent Charge Order in Copper Selenide Thin Films
Authors: B. M. Sharif (1), B. Theunissen (1), C. Westbrook (1), T. Steele (2), S. Choudhuri (1), R. Baumbach (1), S. Savrasov (2), D. Lederman (1) ((1) Department of Physics, University of California, Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA, USA and Materials Science and Engineering Program, University of California, Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA, USA (2) Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of California, Davis, Davis, CA, USA)
Abstract: We demonstrate epitaxial growth of copper selenide (Cu$_{2-x}$Se) thin films in both cubic and rhombohedral phases, achieved via molecular beam epitaxy on Al$_2$O$_3$ (001) substrates. Remarkably, the high-temperature cubic phase -- which in bulk transforms into the rhombohedral structure below 400 K -- is stabilized at room temperature and below, well outside its bulk equilibrium stability range. In the cubic phase films, temperature-dependent electrical transport reveals a pronounced, hysteretic resistivity peak near 140 K, accompanied by unit cell doubling along the [111] direction, as observed by x-ray diffraction, which are hallmarks of a charge density wave (CDW) transition. First-principles calculations show strong Fermi surface nesting in the cubic phase, consistent with the observed CDW instability. In contrast, the rhombohedral films exhibit suppressed nesting and no structural modulation. These results not only unambiguously identify a previously unreported CDW in Cu$_{2-x}$Se thin films, but also establish an epitaxial platform for tuning emergent electronic phases via strain and interface engineering.

Title: Algorithms for variational Monte Carlo calculations of fermion PEPS in the swap gates formulation
Authors: Yantao Wu, Zhehao Dai
Abstract: In recent years, the variational Monte Carlo (VMC) calculations of projected entangled pair states (PEPS) has emerged as a competitive method for computing the ground states of many-body quantum systems. This method is particularly important for fermion systems where sign problems are abundant. We derive and explain the algorithms for the VMC calculations of fermion PEPS in the swap gates formulation. It is the purpose of this paper to be as concise and precise as possible. Diagramatic tensor notation is used whenever possible to serve this purpose. As a separate result, we prove the detailed balance of sequential sampling of tensor networks.

Title: Static friction of liquid marbles
Authors: Yui Takai, Kei Mukoyama, Pritam Kumar Roy, Guillaume Lagubeau, David Qu√©r√©, Samuel Poincloux, Timoth√©e Mouterde
Abstract: Liquid marbles, droplets coated with a granular layer, are highly mobile as particles prevent capillary adhesion with the substrate. Yet, they exhibit static friction due to their granular shell, which resists rolling until it yields. This friction depends on the shell geometry and increases exponentially with grain density, indicating a logistic dependence of interparticle compressive forces on surface coverage, confirmed by yielding measurements in granular rafts. These results reveal the shell's dual role, and establish liquid marbles as a model system for probing granular raft mechanics.

Title: Strong thermoelectric response of nanoconfined weak electrolytes
Authors: Rajkumar Sarma, Steffen Hardt
Abstract: When dissolved, weak electrolytes only partially dissociate into ions in a temperature-dependent process. We show herein that such incomplete dissociation yields an enormous thermoelectric response in an electrolyte-filled nanochannel along which a temperature gradient is applied. For this purpose, an extended version of the Nernst-Planck equations is developed that takes into account the temperature-dependent dissociation-association equilibrium. The results indicate that in this way, Seebeck coefficients can be achieved that outperform all previously reported values.

Title: Quantum dot energy levels in bilayer graphene: Exact and approximate study
Authors: G. Giavaras
Abstract: In bilayer graphene the exact energy levels of quantum dots can be derived from the four-component continuum Hamiltonian. Here, we study the quantum dot energy levels with approximate equations and compare them with the exact levels. The starting point of our approach is the four-component continuum model and the quantum dot is defined by a continuous potential well in a uniform magnetic field. Using some simple arguments we demonstrate realistic regimes where approximate quantum dot equations can be derived. Interestingly these approximate equations can be solved semi-analytically, in the same context as a single-component Schr√∂dinger equation. The approximate equations provide valuable insight into the physics with minimal numerical effort compared with the four-component quantum dot model. We show that the approximate quantum dot energy levels agree very well with the exact levels in a broad range of parameters and find realistic regimes where the relative error is vanishingly small.

Title: Highly anisotropic spin transport in ultrathin black phosphorus
Authors: Luke Cording, Jiawei Liu, Jun You Tan, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Ahmet Avsar, Barbaros √ñzyilmaz
Abstract: In anisotropic crystals, the direction-dependent effective mass of carriers can have a profound impact on spin transport dynamics. The puckered crystal structure of black phosphorus (BP) leads to direction-dependent charge transport and optical response, suggesting that it is an ideal system for studying anisotropic spin transport. To this end, we fabricate and characterize high mobility encapsulated ultrathin BP-based spin-valves in four-terminal geometry. Our measurements show that in-plane spin-lifetimes are strongly gate tunable and exceed one nanosecond. Through high out-of-plane magnetic fields, we observe a five-fold enhancement in the out-of-plane spin signal case compared to in-plane and estimate a colossal spin lifetime anisotropy of ~ 6. This finding is further confirmed by Oblique Hanle measurements. Additionally, we estimate an in-plane spin-lifetime anisotropy ratio of up to 1.8. Our observation of strongly anisotropic spin transport along three orthogonal axes in this pristine material could be exploited to realize directionally tunable spin transport.

Title: Observation of Berry Curvature-Enhanced Anomalous Photo-Nernst Effect in Magnetic Weyl Semimetal
Authors: Zipu Fan, Jinying Yang, Yuchun Chen, Ning Zhao, Xiao Zhuo, Chang Xu, Dehong Yang, Jun Zhou, Jinluo Cheng, Enke Liu, Dong Sun
Abstract: The anomalous Nernst effect is the thermoelectric counterpart of the anomalous Hall effect, which can emerge in magnetic materials or topological materials without magnetic field. Such effect is critical to both fundamental topological physics and various application fields, including energy harvesting, spintronics and optoelectronics. In this work, we observe the anomalous photo-Nernst effect, which use light excitation to generate temperature gradients for the thermoelectric response. Our experiments reveal a pronounced edge photocurrent response in magnetic Weyl semimetal Co3Sn2S2 under zero magnetic field, originating from the anomalous photo-Nernst effect. The pronounced photo-Nernst current benefits from the exceptional properties of Co3Sn2S2, including the large thermoelectric coefficient, topologically enhanced anomalous response of Weyl bands and the Shockley-Ramo nature of long-range photocurrent generation. Furthermore, by comparing the nominal anomalous Nernst coefficient under different wavelength excitations, we observe a clear enhancement in the mid-infrared region, originating from the topological contribution from the large Berry curvature of Weyl bands. Our results reveal the interplay among light, magnetism, and topological order in magnetic Weyl semimetals, which not only offers insights for fundamental physics but also advances potential applications in quantum devices.

Title: Majorana zero modes are the edge modes?
Authors: Vijay Pathak, Vaishnav Mallya, Sujit Sarkar
Abstract: Topological phases are typically characterised by a topological invariant: winding number, which indicates the number of zero modes expected in a given phase. However, the winding number alone does not capture the qualitative differences between the modes within the same topological phase. In this work, we present an analytical solution for the zero-energy modes across various regimes of the phase diagram; a result that, to our knowledge, has not been reported previously in the literature. Through this solution, we characterise edge modes coexisting in a single phase and systematically classify them based on their spatial behaviour. Our analysis also identifies parameter regions where one or both zero modes are perfectly localised at the system edges. Finite and infinite systems were compared based on their spatial characteristics of zero modes. In addition, we provide a detailed analytical treatment of the characteristic equation, demonstrating that its roots offer further insight into the nature of the topological phase transitions. The whole study is based on a one-dimensional quantum Ising chain with long range interactions.

Title: High mechanical strength Si anode synthesis with interlayer bonded expanded graphite structure for lithium-ion batteries
Authors: Wenhui Lai, Jong Hak Lee, Lu Shi, Yuqing Liu, Yanhui Pu, Yong Kang Ong, Carlos Limpo, Ting Xiong, Yifan Rao, Chorng Haur Sow, Barbaros √ñzyilmaz
Abstract: Despite advancements in silicon-based anodes for high-capacity lithium-ion batteries, their widespread commercial adoption is still hindered by significant volume expansion during cycling, especially at high active mass loadings crucial for practical use. The root of these challenges lies in the mechanical instability of the material, which subsequently leads to the structural failure of the electrode. Here, we present a novel synthesis of a composite combining expanded graphite and silicon nanoparticles. This composite features a unique interlayer-bonded graphite structure, achieved through the application of a modified spark plasma sintering method. Notably, this innovative structure not only facilitates efficient ion and electron transport but also provides exceptional mechanical strength (Vickers hardness: up to 658 MPa, Young's modulus: 11.6 GPa). This strength effectively accommodates silicon expansion, resulting in an impressive areal capacity of 2.9 mA h cm-2 (736 mA h g-1) and a steady cycle life (93% after 100 cycles). Such outstanding performance is paired with features appropriate for large-scale industrial production of silicon batteries, such as active mass loading of at least 3.9 mg cm-2, a high-tap density electrode material of 1.68 g cm-3 (secondary clusters: 1.12 g cm-3), and a production yield of up to 1 kg per day.

Title: Crystallization of Chiral Active Brownian Particles at Low Densities
Authors: Kangeun Jeong, Yuta Kuroda, Yuki Asatani, Takeshi Kawasaki, Kunimasa Miyazaki
Abstract: Chiral active matter is a variant of active matter systems in which the motion of the constituent particles violates mirror symmetry. In this letter, we simulate two-dimensional chiral Active Brownian Particles, the simplest chiral model in which each particle undergoes circular motion, and show that the system crystallizes at low densities well below the melting point of the equilibrium counterpart. Crystallization is only possible if the orbital radius is long enough to align the circulating particles, but short enough for neighboring particles to avoid collisions. Of course, the system must be driven sufficiently far from equilibrium, since chirality cannot affect thermodynamic properties in classical equilibrium systems. The fluid-crystal phase diagram shows a re-entrant melting transition as a function of the radius of the circles. We show that at least one of the two transitions follows the same two-step melting scenario as in equilibrium systems.

Title: Lack-of-fit reduction in the path-integral formalism
Authors: Katerina Mlada, Michal Pavelka, Vaclav Klika
Abstract: We present a reformulation of the lack-of-fit reduction in non-equilibrium thermodynamics using the path-integral formalism. The reformulation is based on the Onsager-Machlup variational principle, and it allows us to minimize the action while keeping only thermodynamically relevant solutions. The reduced evolution consists of a Hamiltonian vector field and a gradient flow. The reformulation is illustrated on the Kac-Zwanzig model, where we show how irreversibility emerges from purely Hamiltonian evolution by ignoring some degrees of freedom. We also show how to generalize the Fisher information matrix and Kullback-Leibler divergence between two probability distributions to the case when the two distributions are related by the principle of maximum entropy, even in the case when the entropy is not of Boltzmann-Gibbs type (for instance Tsallis-Havrda-Charvat).

Title: Interfacial reconstruction effects in insulating double perovskite Nd$_2$NiMnO$_6$/SrTiO$_3$ and Nd$_2$NiMnO$_6$/NdGaO$_3$ thin films
Authors: Nandana Bhattacharya, Ranjan Kumar Patel, Siddharth Kumar, Prithwijit Mandal, Jyotirmay Maity, Christoph Klewe, Zhan Zhang, Hua Zhou, Srimanta Middey
Abstract: Ferromagnetic insulating (FMI) double perovskite oxides (DPOs) $A_2BB'$O$_6$ with near-room-temperature Curie temperatures are promising candidates for ambient-temperature spintronics applications. To realize their potential, epitaxial stabilization of DPO films and understanding the effect of multiple broken symmetries across the film/substrate interface are crucial. This study investigates ultrathin films of the FMI Nd$_2$NiMnO$_6$ (NNMO) grown on SrTiO$_3$ (STO) and NdGaO$_3$ (NGO) substrates. By comparing growth on these substrates, we examine the influence of polarity and structural symmetry mismatches, which are absent in the NGO system. The interface exhibits immeasurable resistance in both cases. Using synchrotron X-ray diffraction, we show that films have three octahedral rotational domains because of the structural symmetry mismatch with the STO substrate. Furthermore, our coherent Bragg rod analysis of specular X-ray diffraction reveals a significant modification of the out-of-plane lattice parameter within a few unit cells at the film/substrate interface and the surface. This arises from polarity compensation and surface symmetry breaking, respectively. These structural alterations influence the Mn orbital symmetry, a dependence that we further confirm through X-ray linear dichroism measurements. Since the ferromagnetism in insulating DPOs is mediated by orbital-dependent superexchange interactions [Phys. Rev. Lett. 100, 186402 (2008)], our study provides a framework for understanding the evolution of magnetism in ultrathin geometry.

Title: Two-dimensional transition metal selenides family M2Se: A platform for superconductivity, band topology, and charge density waves
Authors: Shu-Xiang Qiao, Kai-Yue Jiang, Yu-Lin Han, Na Jiao, Ying-Jie Chen, Hong-Yan Lu, Ping Zhang
Abstract: MXenes and MBenes, which are two-dimensional (2D) transition metal carbides/nitrides and borides, have been extensively studied for their impressive properties. Recently, we reported a family of transition metal sulfides MSene (M2S) with rich properties [Phys. Rev. B 111, L041404 (2025)], it is worth studying whether selenides with similar structure also have rich properties. In this work, through high-throughput screening, we present a novel family of 2D transition metal selenides, M2Se. In this family, there are fifty-eight candidate materials, of which ten are stable and metallic. Notably, eight exhibit superconductivity, among which four are superconducting topological metals. Besides, eight show charge density wave (CDW) behavior, among which five also exhibit antiferromagnetism. It is revealed that CDW originates from electron-phonon coupling rather than Fermi surface nesting. Moreover, strain can be applied to regulate the competition between CDW and superconductivity. Our findings reveal the rich properties of superconductivity, band topology, CDW, and magnetism in M2Se, providing a new platform for the controllable integration of multifunctional quantum states.

Title: Staggered nonlinear spin generations in centrosymmetric altermagnets under electric current
Authors: Jie Zhang, Ruijing Fang, Zhichao Zhou, Xiao Li
Abstract: Current-induced spin generations are of significant importance for electrically controllable magnetization. Due to symmetry constraints, linear spin generation is absent in centrosymmetric magnets and nonlinear contributions become crucial. However, nonlinear spin generations have few examples in centrosymmetric compensated magnets with opposite-spin sublattices, which hinders electric control of associated magnetization. Here, we study nonlinear spin generations in altermagnets with opposite-spin sublattices. In a square altermagnetic model, both staggered and uniform nonlinear spin generations appear at opposite-spin sublattices. They vary as the magnetization direction rotates, with emerging out-of-plane components that can be utilized in perpendicular magnetization switching of high-density storage devices. By first-principles calculations, out-of-plane, staggered nonlinear spin generations are found to be considerable in a typical altermagnet, Fe$_2$Se$_2$O monolayer. Our findings provide opportunities for electrically manipulating magnetization and designing energy-efficient magnetic devices based on compensated magnets.

Title: Graphene structure modification under tritium exposure: 3H chemisorption dominates over defect formation by \b{eta}-radiation
Authors: Alexandra Becker, Genrich Zeller, Holger Lippold, Ismail Eren, Lara Rkaya M√ºller, Paul Chekhonin, Agnieszka Beata Kuc, Magnus Schl√∂sser, Cornelius Fischer
Abstract: Potential structural modifications of graphene exposed to gaseous tritium are important for membrane-based hydrogen isotope separation. Such modifications cannot be explained by electron irradiation alone. Instead, tritiation, caused by the tritium radicals remaining after the decay, is the primary effect causing the modification of the graphene surface, as confirmed by confocal Raman spectroscopy. The effect of the interaction of tritium atoms with the graphene surface exceeds that of electron irradiation at the average energy of the beta particles (5.7 keV). Compared to previously investigated high electron doses in the absence of tritium, remarkably low concentrations of tritium already induce a significant amount of sp3- and vacancy-type defects at short exposure times. Our findings are supported by molecular dynamics simulations of graphene bombardment with tritium atoms. As a consequence, tritium saturation of graphene may alter its permeability for hydrogen isotopes, thus affecting potential applications.

Title: Anomalous Bulk Current in Quantum Hall Systems with an Expanding Edge
Authors: Yuuki Sugiyama, Tokiro Numasawa
Abstract: Understanding topological phases of matter is essential for advancing both the fundamental theory and practical applications of condensed matter physics. Recently, a theoretical framework for a quantum Hall system with an expanding edge state was proposed [Phys. Rev. D {\bf 105}, 105009 (2022)], revealing the existence of an energy flux analogous to Hawking radiation on the edge. Motivated by this work, we extend the analysis to a model of a $(2+1)$-dimensional spacetime that includes both the bulk and edge regions. Due to the presence of bulk and edges, we demonstrate that the covariant form of the gravitational anomaly appears on the edge via the anomaly-inflow mechanism. Then, we investigate the energy flux on the edge from the viewpoint of gravitational anomalies, such as covariant gravitational and Weyl anomalies. We also find that, due to the conservation of energy and momentum in the entire system, the presence of anomalous currents on the expanding edge induces non-trivial currents in the bulk originating from the expansion of the edge.

Title: Computational study of geometry, electronic structure and low-lying excited states of linear T-graphene quantum dots
Authors: Arifa Nazir, Alok Shukla
Abstract: A few years ago, by means of first-principles calculations, Enyashin et al.(2011) proposed several novel monolayers of carbon containing rings other than hexagons. One of those monolayers containing tetragons and octagons was investigated later in detail by Liu et al.(2012) who called it T-graphene, and found that it exists both in strictly planar and buckled forms, with the planar structure being metallic in nature. Given the fact that Kotakoski et al.(2011) had already found experimental evidence of 1D carbon structures containing tetragons and octagons, we decided to investigate finite linear fragments of T-graphene, with the strictly planar structures, referred to as T-graphene quantum dots (TQDs). In order to avoid the dangling bonds in the finite T-graphene fragments, we considered the edges to be saturated by hydrogen atoms. We first optimized the geometries of the considered TQDs using a first-principles density-functional theory (DFT) methodology, followed by calculations of their linear optical absorption spectra using the time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) approach. Given the fact that strictly planar T-graphene structures will have $\sigma$-$\pi$ separation with the $\pi$ electrons near the Fermi level, we also parameterized an effective $\pi$-electron Hamiltonian for TQDs, similar to the Pariser-Parr-Pople model for $\pi$-conjugated molecules. We further used the effective Hamiltonian to perform high-order electron-correlated calculations using the configuration interaction (CI) approach to compute the optical absorption spectra of TQDs, and also their singlet-triplet gaps. The symmetry analysis reveals that TQDs are photoluminescent materials. Moreover, in all the TQDs HOMO-LUMO transition is optically forbidden, the optical gaps of these molecules are quite large, suggesting the intriguing possibility of the fission of a singlet optical exciton into several triplet excitons.

Title: Thermal excitation of flexoelectricity in silicon
Authors: Lingtong Lv, Qianqian Ma, Kailu Wang, Xin Wen, Shengping Shen
Abstract: Flexoelectricity, an electromechanical coupling between strain gradient and polarization, offers a promising dimension to enrich silicon-based devices. Although the flexoelectricity of silicon is known, some fundamental aspects remain ambiguous, such as the discrepancy between experimental results and theoretical predictions, the influence of doping concentration, and the role of the bandgap. Here, we measured the flexoelectricity of intrinsic and heavily doped Si over the temperature range of 223 -473 K. The flexoelectric coefficient is of 2.6 {\mu}C/m and barely varies with temperature in doped silicon, while in intrinsic silicon it varies by nearly two orders of magnitude from 15.2 nC/m to 1.8 {\mu}C/m as temperature increases. We show that their different temperature dependencies correspond to the temperature-insensitive donor ionization in doped silicon and the temperature-sensitive intrinsic excitation in intrinsic silicon, with the latter captured by a quantitative relationship between flexoelectricity, temperature and bandgap. Furthermore, similar experimental results on germanium (Ge) suggest the universality of this relationship in first-generation semiconductors. These findings would offer valuable reference for developing Si-based electromechanical devices, as well as understanding the strain-gradient effects on semiconductor band structures (flexoelectronics).

Title: Transport Evidence for Wigner Crystals in Monolayer MoTe2
Authors: Mingjie Zhang, Zhenyu Wang, Yifan Jiang, Yaotian Liu, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Song Liu, Shiming Lei, Yongqing Li, Yang Xu
Abstract: The crystallization of charge carriers, dubbed the Wigner crystal, is anticipated at low densities in clean two-dimensional electronic systems (2DES). While there has been extensive investigation across diverse platforms, probing spontaneous charge and spin ordering is hindered by disorder effects and limited interaction energies. Here, we report transport evidence for Wigner crystals with antiferromagnetic exchange interactions in high-quality, hexagonal boron nitride encapsulated monolayer MoTe2, a system that achieves a large interaction parameter (r_s) at proper hole densities. A density-tuned metal-insulator transition (MIT) occurring at 3.1E10^11 cm-2 (corresponding to r_s~32) and pronounced nonlinear charge transport in the insulating regime at low temperatures signify the formation of Wigner crystals. Thermal melting of the crystalline phase is observed below approximately 2 K via temperature-dependent nonlinear transport. Magnetoresistance measurements further reveal a substantial enhancement of spin susceptibility as approaching the MIT. The temperature dependence of spin susceptibility in the Wigner crystal phase closely follows the Curie-Weiss law, with the extracted negative Weiss constant illustrating antiferromagnetic exchange interactions. Furthermore, we have found the system exhibits metallic-like differential resistivity under finite DC bias, possibly indicating the existence of a non-equilibrium coherent state in the depinning of Wigner crystals. Our observations establish monolayer MoTe2 as a promising platform for exploring magnetic and dynamic properties of Wigner crystals.

Abstract: Equilibrium propagation provides an exact method to compute the gradient of a cost function from the response to external forcing. These algorithms, in conjunction with local updates to the system parameters, may enable mechanical and electronic systems to autonomously acquire complex functionality. We extend these methods to damped dynamical systems operating in the linear regime by introducing an effective action, whose extremum corresponds to the periodic steady state. The condition of applicability is that the response function is symmetric, which is fulfilled by damped Newtonian dynamics and RLC networks. We demonstrate the viability of our method in those systems and explore novel functionality such as classifying temporal sound signals. Our work opens the door to intelligent materials that process dynamical signals, enabling temporal computations, passive and active sensors, and materials that act as frequency-dependent filters.

Title: Superconducting bistability in floating Al islands of hybrid Al/InAs nanowires
Authors: E.V. Shpagina, E.S. Tikhonov, D. Ruhstorfer, G. Koblmueller, V.S. Khrapai
Abstract: We investigate a non-equilibrium aspect of the current-driven superconducting-normal phase transition in floating Al islands of epitaxial full-shell Al/InAs nanowires. Within a transition region discontinuous voltage jumps and hysteretic behaviour of the I-V characteristics are observed, associated with the destruction and recovery of the superconducting order parameter in the island. The strength of the two features varies strongly in different devices in a mutually correlated way and can be suppressed by a small magnetic field. Numerical calculation explains this behaviour in terms of a tiny non-equilibrium correction to the electronic energy distribution at low energies. The experiment demonstrates a critical failure of a two-temperature non-equilibrium model of the superconductor-normal transition in floating islands of hybrid nanowire devices.

Title: Beyond Constant-Temperature Reservoirs: A Stirling Cycle with Constant Heat-Generation Rate
Authors: Xinshu Xia, Hongbo Huang, Hui Dong
Abstract: Conventional heat-engine models typically assume two heat reservoirs at fixed temperatures. In contrast, radioisotope power systems introduce a fundamentally different paradigm in which the hot sources supply heat at a constant generation rate rather than maintaining a constant temperature. We develop a theoretical framework for finite-time heat engines operating between constant heat-generation-rate hot sources and constant-temperature cold reservoirs. A universal proportion between average output power and efficiency is established, independent of the specific cycle configuration or working substance. As a representative case, we analyze a finite-time Stirling cycle employing a tailored control protocol that maintains the working substance at constant temperatures during the quasi-isothermal processes. An intrinsic oscillatory behavior emerges in the temperature dynamics of the hot source, reflecting the interplay between heat accumulation and release. We further quantify the long-term decline in engine performance resulting from radioactive decay and demonstrate its impact over the system's operational lifespan. This work establishes a new theoretical prototype for heat engines and shall provide guidings for the analysis and design of radioisotope power systems.

Title: Shape-determined kinetic pathways in two-dimensional solid-solid phase transitions
Authors: Ruijian Zhu, Yi Peng, Yanting Wang
Abstract: Solid-solid phase transitions are ubiquitous in nature, but the kinetic pathway of anisotropic particle systems remains elusive, where the coupling between translational and rotational motions plays a critical role in various kinetic processes. Here we investigate this problem by molecular dynamics simulation for two-dimensional ball-stick polygon systems, where pentagon, hexagon, and octagon systems all undergo an isostructural solid-solid phase transition. During heating, the translational motion exhibits merely a homogeneous expansion, whereas the time evolution of body-orientation is shape-determined. The local defects of body-orientation self-organize into a vague stripe for pentagon, a random pattern for hexagon, while a distinct stripe for octagon. The underlying kinetic pathway of octagon satisfies the quasi-equilibrium assumption, while that of hexagon and pentagon is dominated by translational motion and by rotational motion, respectively. This diversity is originated from different kinetic coupling modes determined by the anisotropy of molecules, and can affect the phase transition rates. The reverse process in terms of cooling follows the same mechanism, but the kinetic pathways are more diverse attributed to the possible kinetic traps. Our findings not only promote the theoretical understanding of microscopic kinetics of solid-solid phase transitions but also provide direct guidance for the rational design of materials utilizing desired kinetic features.

Title: Multiscale modeling of hydrogen diffusion in iron considering the effect of dislocations
Authors: Gonzalo √Ålvarez, √Ålvaro Ridruejo, Javier Segurado
Abstract: Modeling hydrogen diffusion and its absorption in traps is a fundamental first step towards the understanding and prediction of hydrogen embrittlement. In this study, a multiscale approach which includes DFT simulations, OkMC, and phase-field dislocations, is developed to study the movement of hydrogen atoms in alpha-iron crystals containing dislocations. At the nanoscale the interaction energies of hydrogen on different sites of the iron lattice are studied using DFT. At the microscale, this information is used to feed a lattice object kinetic Monte Carlo code (OKMC) which aims to evolve the arrangement of a large set of hydrogen atoms into the iron lattice considering point defects and the presence of dislocations. At the continuum level, an array of dislocations is introduced using a phase-field approach to accurately consider their elastic fields and core regions. The OKMC model includes both the chemical energies of H and vacancies and the elastic interactions between these point defects and the dislocations. The elastic interaction is obtained by an FFT-based approach which allows a very efficient computation of the elastic microfields created by the defects in an anisotropic medium. The framework has been used to obtain the diffusivity tensor of hydrogen as a function of the external stress state, temperature, and the presence of dislocations. It has been found that dislocations strongly affect the diffusivity tensor by breaking its isotropy and reducing its value by the effect of the microstresses around the dislocations.

Title: Interplay of magnetic ordering and charge transport in a distorted ScAl$_3$C$_3$-type GdZn$_3$As$_3$
Authors: Zhiyu Zhou, Xiyu Chen, Jia-Yi Lu, Junchao Zhang, Xiong Luo, Guang-Han Cao, Shuai Dong, Zhi-Cheng Wang
Abstract: We present the synthesis and characterization of GdZn$_3$As$_3$, a previously unreported variant of the $RM_3X_3$ family ($R$ = lanthanides; $M$ = Zn, Cd; $X$ = P, As), prepared in both single-crystal and polycrystalline forms. Unlike other $RM_3X_3$ compounds that crystallize in undistorted hexagonal structures, GdZn$_3$As$_3$ adopts a distorted ScAl$_3$C$_3$-type orthorhombic structure with $Cmcm$ space group. Magnetic measurements demonstrate that GdZn$_3$As$_3$ undergoes a ferromagnetic transition at the Curie temperature ($T_{\mathrm{C}}$) of 6.3~K, which is unique among known $RM_3X_3$ materials. This magnetic transition is further confirmed by specific heat and electrical resistivity measurements. GdZn$_3$As$_3$ displays metallic behavior with a pronounced resistivity peak near $T_{\mathrm{C}}$, which is strongly suppressed by magnetic fields, leading to significant negative magnetoresistance. Hall effect measurements reveal a low carrier density and a clear nonlinear anomalous Hall effect in GdZn$_3$As$_3$. Furthermore, both specific heat and resistivity data suggest the presence of additional magnetic transition(s) below $T_{\mathrm{C}}$, requiring further investigation. These results demonstrate that GdZn$_3$As$_3$ possesses distinct structural, magnetic, and electronic transport properties within the $RM_3X_3$ family, establishing it as an exceptional platform for investigating competing magnetic interactions in low-carrier-density rare-earth triangular-lattice systems.

Title: Phonon spectra and vibrational heat capacity of quasi-one-dimensional structures formed by rare gas atoms on the surface of carbon nanotube bundles
Authors: E. V. Manzhelii (1), S. B. Feodosyev (1), I. A. Gospodarev (1) ((1) B. Verkin Institute for Low Temperature Physics and Engineering of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, Kharkiv, Ukraine)
Abstract: The features of phonon spectra and their effect on the vibrational heat capacity of linear chains of inert gas atoms adsorbed onto a substrate, which is the surface of nanotubes bound to a nanobundle. The influence of the substrate results both in a shift of the lower limit of the chain spectrum from zero, and in mechanical stress in the chain (its extension or compression) also. It is shown that in the case of a compressed chain, the non-central interaction between atoms is negative (repulsive), it results in a shift of the lower boundary of the spectrum of transverse vibrations to low frequencies and to a shortening of the part of the specific heat temperature dependence in which this dependence is close to exponential. Heterogeneity of the nanobundle structure can cause a change in the distances between atoms of the chain. It is shown both and analytically and numerically, that as a result of it, discrete levels with frequencies both above and below the quasi-continuous spectrum band can appear in the phonon spectrum of the chain. The discrete levels with frequencies below the quasi-continuous spectrum band lead to a further shortening of the temperature interval at which the temperature dependence of the specific heat is close to the exponential one.

Title: Conditions for thermoelectric power factor improvements upon band alignment in complex bandstructure materials
Authors: Saff E Awal Akhtar, Neophytos Neophytou
Abstract: Band alignment (or band convergence) is a strategy suggested to provide improvements in the thermoelectric power factor (PF) of materials with complex bandstructures. The addition of more bands at the energy region that contributes to transport, can provide more conducting paths and could improve the electrical conductivity and PF of a material. However, this can lead to increased inter-valley scattering, which will tend to degrade the conductivity. Using the Boltzmann Transport Equation (BTE) and a multi-band model, we theoretically investigate the conditions under which band alignment can improve the PF. We show that PF improvements are realized when intra-band scattering between the aligned bands dominates over inter-band scattering, with larger improvements reached when a light-band is brought into alignment. In the more realistic scenario of intra-and inter-band scattering co-existence, we show that in the light band alignment case, possibilities of PF improvement are present even down to the level where the intra- and inter-band scattering are of similar strength. For heavy band alignment this tolerance is weaker, and weaker inter-band scattering is necessary to realize PF improvements. On the other hand, when inter-band scattering dominates, it is not possible to realize any PF improvements upon band alignment, irrespective of bringing a light or a heavy band into alignment. Overall, to realize PF improvements upon band alignment, the valleys that are brought into alignment need to be as electrically conducting as possible compared to the lower energy base valleys and interact as little as possible with those.

Title: Scalable and Tunable In-Plane Ge/Si(001) Nanowires Grown by Molecular Beam Epitaxy
Authors: Jian-Huan Wang, Ming Ming, Ding-Ming Huang, Jie-Yin Zhang, Yi Luo, Bin-Xiao Fu, Yi-Xin Chu, Yuan Yao, Hongqi Xu, Jian-Jun Zhang
Abstract: Germanium nanostructures offer significant potential in developing advanced integrated circuit and disruptive quantum technologies, yet achieving both scalability and high carrier mobility remains a challenge in materials science. Here, we report an original low-temperature epitaxial method for growth of site-controlled in-plane germanium nanowires with high hole mobility by molecular beam epitaxy. By reducing the growth temperature, we effectively suppress Si-Ge interdiffusion, ensuring pure germanium composition within the nanowires while preserving their high crystalline quality. The method employs pre-patterned ridges on strain-relaxed Si$_{0.75}$Ge$_{0.25}$/Si(001) substrates as tailored templates, enabling control over the position, length, spacing and cross-sectional shape of the nanowires. Electrical measurements of field-effect devices made from as-grown germanium nanowires show that the nanowires are of hole conduction with mobility exceeding 7000 cm$^{2}$/Vs at 2-20 K. The method paves a way for fabrication of scalable germanium nanowire networks, providing a reliable platform for the developments of high-performance nanoelectronics and multi-qubit chips.

Title: Visualizing intercalation effects in 2D materials using AFM based techniques
Authors: Karmen Kapustiƒá, Cosme G. Ayani, Borna Pieliƒá, Kate≈ôina Plevov√°, ≈†imun Mandiƒá, Iva ≈†rut Rakiƒá
Abstract: Intercalation of two dimensional materials, particularly transition metal dichalcogenides, is a noninvasive way to modify electronic, optical and structural properties of these materials. However, research of these atomic-scale phenomena usually relies on using Ultra High Vacuum techniques which is time consuming, expensive and spatially limited. Here we utilize Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) based techniques to visualize local structural and electronic changes of the MoS2 on graphene on Ir(111), caused by sulfur intercalation. AFM topography reveals structural changes, while phase imaging and mechanical measurements show reduced Young's modulus and adhesion. Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy highlights variations in surface potential and work function, aligning with intercalation signatures, while Photoinduced Force Microscopy detects enhanced optical response in intercalated regions. These results demonstrate the efficacy of AFM based techniques in mapping intercalation, offering insights into tailoring 2D materials electronic and optical properties. This work underscores the potential of AFM techniques for advanced material characterization and the development of 2D material applications.

Title: High-Frequency and Microwave Magnetic Properties of Ni0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 Spinel Ferrite Ceramics
Authors: M. Kempa, V. Bovtun, V. Kukhar, S. Solopan, A. Belous, O. Vyunov, Y. Yakymenko, S. Kamba
Abstract: Magnetic properties of the Ni0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 (NZF) spinel ferrite ceramics were studied over a broad frequency range (1 MHz - 50 GHz). Between 10 MHz and 2 GHz, strong temperature-dependent resonance-like magnetic permeability dispersion was observed and attributed to the magnetic domain-wall dynamics. It is responsible for the high magnetic losses, absorption and shielding ability of NZF, and provides high nonlinearity and tunability of the permeability under a weak magnetic field. The attenuation constant of NZF is comparable to those of dielectric-conductor composites and giant permittivity materials. In the microwave range (2-50 GHz), three magnetic excitations dependent on a weak magnetic field were revealed and related to magnons. The lowest-frequency magnon (<10 GHz) is attributed to the natural ferromagnetic resonance, two others are excited between 28 and 44 GHz. Interaction of the magnons and magneto-dielectric resonance modes with electromagnetic waves provides high absorption and shielding efficiency in the GHz range, including 5G and 6G communication frequencies.

Title: Rabi oscillations with close-range quantum vortex states
Authors: Sam Patrick
Abstract: Quantum vortices separated through distances much larger than their core size interact via their long-range velocity field. At smaller separations, however, the influence of the core's compressibility strongly influences the vortex dynamics. Using the example of a compact ring of five vortices, it is shown that close-range effects lead to a new (slower) state of orbital motion which is not predicted by the usual long-range theory. This secondary state can be created starting from the usual orbital state by modulating the interaction strength to induce Rabi oscillations between the states.

Title: Quantized and nonquantized Hall response in topological Hatsugai-Kohmoto systems
Authors: Thibaut Desort, Mark O. Goerbig, Corentin Morice
Abstract: We explore the robustness of Hall conductivity quantization in several insulating systems, exhibiting one scenario where the quantization is not preserved. Specifically, we apply the Kubo formula to topological models with the Hatsugai-Kohmoto interaction. Starting from the many-body degeneracy induced by this interaction in the topological Kane-Mele model, we consider Zeeman fields to select specific states within the ground-state manifold that reveal a non-quantized Hall response, precisely for the case with a Zeeman field diagonal in the bands of the Kane-Mele model. From a physical point of view, this term may mimic a ferromagnetic order that arises naturally when couplings beyond the Hatsugai-Kohmoto interaction are taken into account.

Title: Theoretical study on ambient pressure superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films : structural analysis, model construction, and robustness of $s\pm$-wave pairing
Authors: Kensei Ushio, Shu Kamiyama, Yuto Hoshi, Ryota Mizuno, Masayuki Ochi, Kazuhiko Kuroki, Hirofumi Sakakibara
Abstract: We theoretically study ambient pressure superconductivity in thin films of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. We construct model Hamiltonians adopting the crystal structure theoretically determined by fixing the in-plane lattice constant to those substrates examined in the experiment. We also construct a model based on the experimentally determined lattice structure. To the models obtained, we apply the fluctuation exchange approximation, which takes into account the full momentum and frequency dependencies of the Green function and the pairing interaction. We find that the electronic structure, including the presence/absence of the so-called $\gamma$-pocket (the Fermi surface originating from the top of the $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ bonding band) depends on the crystal structure adopted and/or the presence/absence of $+U$ correction in the band structure calculation. Nonetheless, $s\pm$-wave pairing symmetry remains robust regardless of these details in the band structure. The robustness of the $s\pm$-wave pairing mainly owes to the large sign changing superconducting gap function of the $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ bands around $(k_x,k_y)=(0,0)$ and $(k_x,k_y)=(\pi,\pi)$, which originates from the finite energy spin fluctuations. On the other hand, $T_c$ being halved from that of the pressurized bulk can only be understood by adopting the model with small $|t_\perp|$ derived from the experimentally determined crystal structure, at least within the present FLEX approach, although there may remain some other possibilities beyond this approach for the origin of the reduced $T_c$.

Title: A direct dispersive signature of Pauli spin blockade

Abstract: Pauli Spin Blockade (PSB) is a key paradigm in semiconductor nanostructures and gives access to the spin physics. We report the direct observation of PSB with gate-dispersive reflectometry on double quantum dots with source-drain bias. The reservoir charge transitions are strongly modulated, turning on and off when entering and leaving the blockaded region, consistent with a simple model. Seen with holes in Ge and Si, the effects are enhanced with larger bias voltage and suppressed by magnetic field. This work lays the foundation for fast probing of spin physics and minimally invasive spin readout.

Title: High-temperature helical edge states in BiSbTeSe$_2$/graphene van der Waals heterostructure

Abstract: Van der Waals heterostructures have been used to tailor atomic layers into various artificial materials through interactions at heterointerfaces. The interplay between the band gap created by the band folding of the interfacial potential and the band inversion driven by enhanced spin-orbit interaction (SOI) through band hybridization enables us to realize a two-dimensional topological insulator (2D-TI). Here we report the realization of graphene 2D-TIs by epitaxial growth of three-dimensional topological insulator (3D-TI) BiSbTeSe$_2$ ultrathin films on graphene. By increasing the BiSbTeSe$_2$ thickness from 2 nm to 9 nm to enhance SOI on graphene, the electronic state is altered from the trivial Kekul${√©}$ insulator to the 2D-TI. The nonlocal transport reveals the helical edge conduction which survives up to 200 K at maximum. Our graphene 2D-TI is stable, easy to make electrical contacts, and of high quality. It offers various applications including spin-current conversion and platforms for Majorana fermions in junctions to superconductors.

Title: Analytical solution of coupled self--consistency and linearised Usadel equations for the dirty finite--sized superconductor at critical temperature
Authors: S.S. Seidov, N.G. Pugach
Abstract: In this manuscript we analytically investigate the linearised Usadel equation and the self--consistency equation, defining the critical temperature of the superconducting phase transition of a finite--sized superconductor in the dirty limit. This is a system of coupled differential and integral equations for the anomalous Green function and the order parameter of the superconductor. The formal solution of the system is found for the general case of the linearised boundary conditions, reducing the solution to the solution of an eigenvalue problem. The latter defines the critical temperature of the superconducting phase transition and the spatial distributions of the anomalous Green function and the order parameter.

Title: Micromagnetic structure of oxidized magnetite nanoparticles: sharp structural versus diffuse magnetic interface
Authors: Elizabeth M. Jefremovas, Michael P. Adams, Luc√≠a Gandarias, Lourdes Marcano, Javier Alonso, Andreas Michels, Jonathan Leliaert
Abstract: The oxidation of magnetite to maghemite is a naturally occurring process that leads to the degradation of the magnetic properties of magnetite nanoparticles. Despite being systematically observed with traditional macroscopic magnetization measurement techniques, a detailed understanding of this process at the microscale is still missing. In this study, we track the evolution of the magnetic structure of magnetite nanoparticles during their oxidation to maghemite through numerical micromagnetic simulations. To capture realistic interparticle effects, we incorporate dipolar interactions by modeling the nanoparticles arranged in chains. Our computational results are benchmarked against experimental data from magnetotactic bacteria, studied over a time scale of years. To resolve the magnetization at the interface between both oxide phases, we propose spin-polarized small-angle neutron scattering (SANS), an experimental technique capable of probing magnetization textures at nanometer length scales. By analyzing the pair-distance distribution function extracted from SANS, we identify distinct signatures of magnetic disorder. Specifically, our findings suggest that the magnetization from the non-oxidized core region varies smoothly across the (structurally sharp) interface into the oxidized shell. The existence of such a diffuse magnetic interface may account for the superior magnetic properties of partially oxidized magnetite nanoparticles compared to fully converted maghemite samples.

Title: Anomalous Energy Injection in Turbulent Neutron Star Cores
Authors: Anirudh Sivakumar, Pankaj Kumar Mishra, Ahmad A. Hujeirat, Paulsamy Muruganandam
Abstract: Neutron star glitches -- sudden increases in rotational frequency -- are thought to result from angular momentum transfer via quantized vortices in the superfluid core. Using a two-dimensional rotating atomic Bose-Einstein condensate with phenomenological damping and a pinning potential to mimic the crust, we model the dynamics underlying these events. Our simulations reveal a transient Kolmogorov-like turbulent cascade ($k^{-5/3}$) that transitions to a Vinen-like scaling ($k^{-1}$). We identify an anomalous secondary injection mechanism driven primarily by quantum pressure, which sustains turbulent fluctuations in pulsar glitches. By tuning the damping coefficient $\gamma$, we determine an optimal regime for energy transfer. These findings provide a robust analogy for neutron star glitch phenomena and offer new insights into turbulence in extreme astrophysical environments.

Title: Direct Observation of Hot Spots in Ferroelectric Domain Wall Devices by Scanning Thermal Microscopy
Authors: Lindsey R. Lynch, J. Marty Gregg, Amit Kumar, Kristina M. Holsgrove, Raymond G. P. McQuaid
Abstract: Ferroelectric domain wall devices offer a promising route to low voltage, reconfigurable nanoelectronics by confining currents to nanoscale conducting interfaces within an insulating bulk. However, resistive heating due to domain wall conduction still remains unexplored. Here, we employ scanning thermal microscopy to directly image hot spots in thin-film lithium niobate domain wall devices. Piezoresponse force microscopy shows that the hot spots correlate with nanodomain structure and thermal mapping reveals surface temperature rises of up to ~ 20 K, levels that are unlikely to negatively affect device performance. This is due to the moderate conductivity of domain walls, their voltage-tunable erasure, and distributed current pathways, which inherently limit power dissipation and peak temperatures. Finite element electrothermal modelling indicates that domain walls behave as pseudo-planar heat sources, distinct from filament-based models. These findings highlight the potential for domain wall devices as an energy-efficient, thermally stable platform for emerging memory and logic applications.

Title: On the temperature of an active nematic
Authors: Jay Armas, Akash Jain, Ruben Lier
Abstract: We employ a novel hydrodynamic framework for active matter coupled to an environment to study the local temperature of an active nematic, assuming proximity to thermal equilibrium. We show that, due to the mechanosensitivity of fuel consumption, linearized temperature correlations in a homogeneous active nematic steady state remain unaffected by activity. However, we demonstrate that local shearing and twisting cause a confined active nematic undergoing a spontaneous flow transition to develop a distinctive inhomogeneous temperature profile, serving as a thermal signature of activity.

Title: Modeling phase transformations in Mn-rich disordered rocksalt cathodes with charge-informed machine-learning interatomic potentials
Authors: Peichen Zhong, Bowen Deng, Shashwat Anand, Tara Mishra, Gerbrand Ceder
Abstract: Mn-rich disordered rocksalt (DRX) cathode materials exhibit a phase transformation from a disordered to a partially disordered spinel-like structure ($\delta$-phase) during electrochemical cycling. In this computational study, we used charge-informed molecular dynamics with a fine-tuned CHGNet foundation potential to investigate the phase transformation in Li$_{x}$Mn$_{0.8}$Ti$_{0.1}$O$_{1.9}$F$_{0.1}$. Our results indicate that transition metal migration occurs and reorders to form the spinel-like ordering in an FCC anion framework. The transformed structure contains a higher concentration of non-transition metal (0-TM) face-sharing channels, which are known to improve Li transport kinetics. Analysis of the Mn valence distribution suggests that the appearance of tetrahedral Mn$^{2+}$ is a consequence of spinel-like ordering, rather than the trigger for cation migration as previously believed. Calculated equilibrium intercalation voltage profiles demonstrate that the $\delta$-phase, unlike the ordered spinel, exhibits solid-solution signatures during the 0-TM to Li$_{\text{tet}}$ conversion reaction. A higher Li capacity is obtained than in the DRX phase. This study provides atomic insights into solid-state phase transformation and its relation to experimental electrochemistry, highlighting the potential of charge-informed machine learning interatomic potentials for understanding complex oxide materials.

Title: Depinning and activated motion of chiral self-propelled robots
Authors: Juan Pablo Carrillo-Mora, Adri√† Garc√©s, Demian Levis
Abstract: We study experimentally, numerically and analytically, the dynamics of a chiral active particle (cm-sized robots), pulled at a constant translational velocity. We show that the system can be mapped to a Brownian particle driven across a periodic potential landscape, and thus exhibits a rotational depinning transition in the noiseless limit, giving rise to a creep regime in the presence of rotational diffusion. We show that a simple model of chiral, self-aligning, active particles accurately describes such dynamics. The steady-state distribution and escape times from local potential barriers, corresponding to long-lived orientations of the particles, can be computed exactly within the model and is in excellent agreement with both experiments and particle-based simulations, with no fitting parameters. Our work thus consolidates such self-propelled robots as a model system for the study of chiral active matter, and highlights the interesting dynamics arising from the interplay between external and internal driving forces in the presence of a self-aligning torque.

Title: Floquet operator dynamics and orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle
Authors: Hsiu-Chung Yeh, Aditi Mitra
Abstract: Operator spreading under stroboscopic time evolution due to a unitary is studied. An operator Krylov space is constructed and related to orthogonal polynomials on a unit circle (OPUC), as well as to the Krylov space of the edge operator of the Floquet transverse field Ising model with inhomogeneous couplings (ITFIM). The Verblunsky coefficients in the OPUC representation are related to the Krylov angles parameterizing the ITFIM. The relations between the OPUC and spectral functions are summarized and several applications are presented. These include derivation of analytic expressions for the OPUC for persistent $m$-periodic dynamics, and the numerical construction of the OPUC for autocorrelations of the homogeneous Floquet-Ising model as well as the $Z_3$ clock model. The numerically obtained Krylov angles of the $Z_3$ clock model with long-lived period tripled autocorrelations show a spatial periodicity of six, and this observation is used to develop an analytically solvable model for the ITFIM that mimics this behavior.

Title: Tunable lower critical fractal dimension for a non-equilibrium phase transition
Authors: Mattheus Burkhard, Luca Giacomelli, Cristiano Ciuti
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the role of spatial dimension and driving frequency in a non-equilibrium phase transition of a driven-dissipative interacting bosonic system. In this setting, spatial dimension is dictated by the shape of the external driving field. We consider both homogeneous driving configurations, which correspond to standard integer-dimensional systems, and fractal driving patterns, which give rise to a non-integer Hausdorff dimension for the spatial density. The onset of criticality is characterized by critical slowing down in the excited density dynamics as the system asymptotically approaches the steady state, signaling the closing of the Liouvillian frequency gap. We show that the lower critical dimension -- below which the non-equilibrium phase transition ceases to occur -- can be controlled continuously by the frequency detuning of the driving field.

Title: Reducing Self-Interaction Error in Transition-Metal Oxides with Different Exact-Exchange Fractions for Energy and Density
Authors: Harshan Reddy Gopidi, Ruiqi Zhang, Yanyong Wang, Abhirup Patra, Jianwei Sun, Adrienn Ruzsinszky, John P. Perdew, Pieremanuele Canepa
Abstract: DFT is vital for materials discovery, and at the base of extensive molecular and materials databases, chemical reaction predictions, and machine learning potentials. The widespread use of DFT in chemistry and materials science aims for "chemical accuracy," but this is limited by the unknown exchange and correlation (XC) functional. A meta-GGA, the restored regularized strongly constrained and appropriately normed, r r2SCAN XC functional, fulfils 17 exact constraints of the XC energy. r2SCAN still appears inadequate at predicting material properties of strongly correlated compounds. Inaccuracies of r2SCAN arise from functional and density-driven errors, linked to the self-interaction error. We introduce a new method, r2SCANY@r2SCANX, for simulating transition metal oxides accurately. r2SCANY@r2SCANX utilizes different fractions of exact exchange: X to set the electronic density, and Y to set the energy density functional approximation. r2SCANY@r2SCANX addresses functional-driven and density-driven inaccuracies. Using just one or two universal parameters, r2SCANY@r2SCANX enhances the r2SCAN predictions of the properties of 18 correlated oxides, outperforming the highly parameterized DFT+U method. The O2 overbinding in r2SCAN (~0.3 eV/O2) reduces to just ~0.03 eV/O$_2$ with any X in r2SCAN10@r2SCANX. Uncertainties for oxide oxidation energies and magnetic moments are reduced by r2SCAN10@r2SCAN50, minimizing r2SCAN density-driven errors. The computationally efficient r2SCAN10@r2SCAN is nearly as accurate as the hybrid r2SCAN10 for oxidation energies. Thus, accurate energy differences can be achieved by rate-limiting self-consistent iterations and geometry optimizations with the efficient r2SCAN. Subsequently, expensive hybrid functionals can be applied in a fast-to-execute single post-self-consistent calculation, as in r2SCAN10@r2SCAN, which is 10 to 300 times faster than r2SCAN10.

Title: Artificial Symmetry Breaking by Self-Interaction Error
Authors: Lin Hou, Cody Woods, Yanyong Wang, Jorge Vega Bazantes, Ruiqi Zhang, Shimin Zhang, Erik Alfredo Perez Caro, Yuan Ping, Timo Lebeda, Jianwei Sun
Abstract: Symmetry is a cornerstone of quantum mechanics and materials theory, underpinning the classification of electronic states and the emergence of complex phenomena such as magnetism and superconductivity. While symmetry breaking in density functional theory can reveal strong electron correlation, it may also arise spuriously from self-interaction error (SIE), an intrinsic flaw in many approximate exchange-correlation functionals. In this work, we present clear evidence that SIE alone can induce artificial symmetry breaking, even in the absence of strong correlation. Using a family of one-electron, multi-nuclear-center systems \( \mathrm{H}^+_{n \times \frac{+2}{n}}(R) \), we show that typical semilocal density functionals exhibit symmetry-breaking localization as system size increases, deviating from the exact, symmetry-preserving Hartree-Fock solution. We further demonstrate that this localization error contrasts with the well-known delocalization error of semilocal density functionals and design a semilocal density functional that avoids the artifact. Finally, we illustrate the real-world relevance of this effect in the \ch{Ti_{Zn}v_O} defect in ZnO, where a semilocal density functional breaks the $C_{3v}$ symmetry while a hybrid density functional preserves it. These findings highlight the need for improved functional design to prevent spurious symmetry breaking in both model and real materials.

Title: First High-Throughput Evaluation of Dark Matter Detector Materials
Authors: Sin√©ad M. Griffin, Yonit Hochberg, Benjamin V. Lehmann, Rotem Ovadia, Kristin A. Persson, Bethany A. Suter, Ruo Xi Yang, Wayne Zhao
Abstract: We perform the first high-throughput search and evaluation of materials that can serve as excellent low-mass dark matter detectors. Using properties of close to one thousand materials from the Materials Project database, we project the sensitivity in dark matter parameter space for experiments constructed from each material, including both absorption and scattering processes between dark matter and electrons. Using the anisotropic materials in the dataset, we further compute the level of daily modulation in interaction rates and the resulting directional sensitivities, highlighting materials with prospects to detect the dark matter wind. Our methods provide the basic tools for the data-driven design of dark matter detectors, and our findings lay the groundwork for the next generation of highly optimized direct searches for dark matter as light as the keV scale.

Authors: Zhiyin Tu, Violet Workman, Gaurav Bahl, Alicia J. Koll√°r
Abstract: Synthetic materials that emulate tight-binding Hamiltonians have enabled a wide range of advances in topological and non-Hermitian physics. A crucial requirement in such systems is the engineering of non-reciprocal couplings and synthetic magnetic fields. More broadly, the development of these capabilities in a manner compatible with quantum-coherent degrees of freedom remains an outstanding challenge, particularly for superconducting circuits, which are highly sensitive to magnetic fields. Here we demonstrate that pure gyration -- a non-reciprocal coupling with exactly matched magnitude but non-reciprocal $\pi$ phase contrast -- can be realized between degenerate states using only spatio-temporal modulation. Our experiments are performed using microwave superconducting resonators that are modulated using dc-SQUID arrays. We first show the existence of continuous exceptional surfaces in modulation parameter space where coupling with arbitrarily-large magnitude contrast can be achieved, with robust volumes of $\pi$ phase contrast contained within. We then demonstrate that intersection of these volumes necessarily gives rise to new continuous surfaces in parameter space where pure gyration is achieved. With this we experimentally demonstrate $>58$ dB isolation and the first on-chip gyrator with only superconducting circuit elements. Our method is fully agnostic to physical implementation (classical or quantum) or frequency range and paves the way to large-scale non-reciprocal metamaterials.

Title: Nonabelian ferromagnets with three-body interactions
Authors: Alexios P. Polychronakos, Konstantinos Sfetsos
Abstract: We study the thermodynamics of nonabelian ferromagnets consisting of atoms in the fundamental representation of $SU(N)$ and interacting with two-body and three-body interactions. An intricate phase structure emerges, depending on the relative strength and sign of the two-body and three-body coupling constants. In the case where two-body interactions are ferromagnetic and three-body ones are antiferromagnetic, we uncover a rich cascade of phase transitions, the appearance of phases with two distinct polarization directions being the most striking novel feature. Our results are relevant to magnetic systems where higher-body interactions cannot be neglected.

Title: Holography for bulk-boundary local topological order
Authors: Corey Jones, Pieter Naaijkens, David Penneys
Abstract: In our previous article [arXiv:2307.12552], we introduced local topological order (LTO) axioms for quantum spin systems which allowed us to define a physical boundary manifested by a net of boundary algebras in one dimension lower. This gives a formal setting for topological holography, where the braided tensor category of DHR bimodules of the physical boundary algebra captures the bulk topological order. In this article, we extend the LTO axioms to quantum spin systems equipped with a topological boundary, again producing a physical boundary algebra for the bulk-boundary system, whose category of (topological) boundary DHR bimodules recovers the topological boundary order. We perform this analysis in explicit detail for Levin-Wen and Walker-Wang bulk-boundary systems. Along the way, we introduce a 2D braided categorical net of algebras built from a unitary braided fusion category (UBFC). Such nets arise as boundary algebras of Walker-Wang models. We consider the canonical state on this braided categorical net corresponding to the standard topological boundary for the Walker-Wang model. Interestingly, in this state, the cone von Neumann algebras are type I with finite dimensional centers, in contrast with the type II and III cone von Neumann algebras from the Levin-Wen models studied in [arXiv:2307.12552]. Their superselection sectors recover the underlying unitary category of our UBFC, and we conjecture the superselection category also captures the fusion and braiding.

Title: Ensemble nonlinear optical learner by electrically tunable linear scattering
Authors: Tunan Xia, Cheng-Kuan Wu, Duan-Yi Guo, Lidan Zhang, Bofeng Liu, Tsung-Hsien Lin, Xingjie Ni, Iam-Choon Khoo, Zhiwen Liu
Abstract: Recent progress in effective nonlinearity, achieved by exploiting multiple scatterings within the linear optical regime, has been demonstrated to be a promising approach to enable nonlinear optical processing without relying on actual material nonlinearity. Here we introduce an ensemble nonlinear optical learner, via electrically tunable linear scattering in a liquid-crystal-polymer composite film under low optical power and low applied electrical voltages. We demonstrate, through several image classification tasks, that by combining inference results from an ensemble of nonlinear optical learners realized at different applied voltages, the ensemble optical learning significantly outperforms the classification performance of individual processors. With very low-level optical power and electrical voltage requirements, and ease in reconfiguration simply by varying applied voltages, the ensemble nonlinear optical learning offers a cost-effective and flexible way to improve computing performance and enhance inference accuracy.

Title: Gear-based Metamaterials for Extraordinary Bandgap Tunability
Authors: Xin Fang, Jihong Wen, Dianlong Yu, Peter Gumbsch, Huajian Gao
Abstract: Metamaterials can be engineered with tunable bandgaps to adapt to dynamic and complex environments, particularly for controlling elastic waves and vibration. However, achieving wide-range, seamless, reversible, in-situ and robust tunability remains challenging and often impractical due to limitations in bandgap mechanisms and design principles. Here, we introduce gear-based metamaterials with unprecedented bandgap tunability. Our approach leverages Taiji planetary gear systems as variable-frequency local resonators, which allows the metamaterial to seamlessly modulate its bandgap's center frequency by 3-7 times (e.g. shifting from 250-430 Hz to 1400-2000 Hz), surpassing existing methods. Notably, this is achieved without pre-deformation or major changes to its static stiffness in the wave propagation direction, ensuring robust in-situ tunability and smooth control even under heavy static loads. This enables adaptable wave manipulation for versatile smart platforms.

Title: Slip-flow theory for thermo-osmosis based on a kinetic model with near-wall potential
Authors: Tetsuro Tsuji, Koichiro Takita, Satoshi Taguchi
Abstract: In this paper, thermal-slip coefficients in slip boundary conditions of the Stokes equation are derived using the generalized slip-flow theory, with special interest in the role of near-wall potential in micro- and nanoscale flows. As the model of fluids and fluid-solid interaction, we employ the model Boltzmann equation for dilute gases and the diffuse-reflection boundaries with near-wall potential, respectively. It is found that, when the mean free path of gas molecules and the effective range of potential are of the same order of magnitude, the thermal-slip boundary condition can be derived in the near-continuum limit. In the derived slip-flow theory, the thermal-slip coefficient and the boundary-layer corrections (i.e., Knudsen-layer corrections) are determined by solving the kinetic boundary-layer problems (i.e., Knudsen-layer problems) that include external-force terms and inhomogeneous terms both driven by the potential. As the application of the slip-flow theory, thermo-osmosis between two parallel plates with uniform temperature gradients is analyzed. The results of the slip-flow theory are validated by comparing them with those of the direct numerical analysis of the same problem. Furthermore, it is found that thermo-osmosis and thermal slip on the plates are significantly affected by the features of the near-wall potential; even the gas-flow direction can be reversed when the near-wall potential is repulsive. Such a flow reversal is qualitatively similar to thermo-osmosis in liquids reported in existing molecular dynamics simulation.

Title: Thermal transport characteristics of impinging ferrofluid droplets in the presence of a magnetic field
Authors: Ram Krishna Shah
Abstract: Droplet interactions with solid surfaces are fundamental to natural phenomena and hold significant commercial relevance across diverse applications. While the impingement dynamics of conventional aqueous droplets on solid substrates are well-characterized, the behavior of non-aqueous droplets, particularly those influenced by external force fields like electric or magnetic fields, remains a less explored domain. This study addresses this gap by investigating the impact of a magnetic field on the impingement dynamics of ferrofluid droplets on a heated solid surface. Ferrofluids are unique colloidal suspensions of magnetic nanoparticles within a non-magnetic carrier fluid, enabling external manipulation of their dynamic properties through magnetic forces. The application of a magnetic field introduces an attractive force within the ferrofluid, fundamentally altering the droplet's spreading behavior and, consequently, its transport characteristics upon impact. Our findings reveal a substantial increase in both the maximum spreading diameter and the contact time between the droplet and the substrate, directly leading to enhanced thermal transport efficiency. Furthermore, the magnetic force effectively suppresses droplet bounce-off from hydrophobic surfaces. These critical parameters can be precisely controlled by adjusting the strength of the induced magnetic force. Such interactions can be used in the design of thermal switches and thermal management systems. The multi-physics interactions of magnetic fields, fluid flow, interface tracking, and heat transfer within the multiphase system are computationally modelled to examine the effect of Weber number and contact angle on maximum spreading and associated heat transfer characteristics.

Title: Trion quantum coherence in site-controlled pyramidal InGaAs quantum dots
Authors: R. A. Barcan, I. Samaras, K. Barr, G. Juska, E. Pelucchi, K. G. Lagoudakis
Abstract: Deterministically positioned pyramidal InGaAs quantum dots (QDs) exhibit exceptional quantum properties, making them highly promising candidates for scalable on-chip quantum information processing. In this work, we investigate the coherent dynamics of positively charged excitons under the influence of strong magnetic fields in the Faraday configuration. Pyramidal quantum dots exhibit a fourfold splitting of the charged excitons even in the Faraday configuration, giving rise to an optically addressable double-{\Lambda} system akin to self-assembled quantum dots in oblique magnetic fields. Here, we investigate ultrafast complete coherent control of the trion to ground state transition utilizing advanced optical resonant excitation techniques and we observe quantum coherence over timescales that are similar to other prominent quantum dot platforms. These results pave the way towards establishing site-controlled pyramidal InGaAs QDs as scalable platforms for quantum information processing, expanding the reach of coherent control to new quantum systems.

Title: Electrically-gated laser-induced spin dynamics in magneto-electric iron garnet at room temperature
Authors: T.T. Gareev, N.E. Khokhlov, L.K√∂rber, A. P. Pyatakov, A. V. Kimel
Abstract: Ultrafast pump-probe imaging reveals that the efficiency of optical excitation of coherent spins waves in epitaxial iron garnet films can be effectively controlled by an external electric field at room temperature. Although a femtosecond laser pulse alone does not excite any pronounced coherent spin oscillations, an electrical gating with the field of 0.5 MV/m dramatically changes the outcome in a laser-induced launching of spin waves. The effect, demonstrated under room-temperature conditions, is estimated to be orders of magnitude larger than in magnetic van der Waals semiconductors observed at 10 K. This electrical gating of laser-induced spin dynamics enriches opto-magnonics with a new tool and thus opens up a new avenue in fundamental and applied magnonics research.

Title: Controlling Casimir Effect in Networks
Authors: Tian-Ming Zhao, Rong-Xin Miao
Abstract: Networks have played a pivotal role in physics, mathematics, and biology, propelling the recent revolution in artificial intelligence. This paper studies quantum field theories on networks and proposes a novel junction condition on the node. The junction condition is consistent with energy conservation in the sense that the total energy flow into the node is zero. As an application, we explore the Casimir effect on networks. Remarkably, the Casimir force on one edge can be changed from attractive to repulsive by adjusting the lengths of the other edges, providing a straightforward way to control the Casimir effect. We begin by discussing the Casimir effect for $(1+1)$-dimensional free massless scalars on a simple network. We then extend this discussion to various types of networks and higher dimensions. Finally, we offer brief comments on some open questions.

Title: Robust Tripartite Entanglement Generation via Correlated Noise in Spin Qubits
Authors: Sander Driessen, Ji Zou, Even Thingstad, Jelena Klinovaja, Daniel Loss
Abstract: We investigate the generation of genuine tripartite entanglement in a triangular spin-qubit system due to spatially correlated noise. In particular, we demonstrate how the formation of a highly entangled dark state -- a W state -- enables robust, long-lived tripartite entanglement. Surprisingly, we find that environmentally induced coherent coupling does not play a crucial role in sustaining this entanglement. This contrasts sharply with the two-qubit case, where the induced coupling significantly influences the entanglement dynamics. Furthermore, we explore two promising approaches to enhance the tripartite entanglement by steering the system towards the dark state: post-selection and coherent driving. Our findings offer a robust method for generating high-fidelity tripartite entangled states with potential applications in quantum computation.

Title: Comparison between Causal and Acausal Diffusion: a Schwinger-Keldysh Effective Field Theory Perspective
Authors: Navid Abbasi, Matthias Kaminski, Dirk H. Rischke
Abstract: In Fick's time-honored theory of diffusion, the system responds instantaneously to external perturbations, resulting in acausal behavior. Maxwell-Cattaneo theory addresses this issue by introducing a relaxation time, rendering the diffusion process causal. We focus on systems where this relaxation time is comparable to the diffusion time and significantly larger than the relaxation times of all other non-conserved operators. In such systems, late-time diffusion is influenced by this relaxation process, leading to a theory of quasi-diffusion. Using the Schwinger-Keldysh Effective Field Theory (SK-EFT) framework, we compare the theories of diffusion and quasi-diffusion by analyzing the real-time dynamics of correlation functions both in linear response and at one-loop order. In particular, we show that the one-loop corrections in the causal (quasi-diffusion) theory, in both the underdamped and the overdamped cases, are governed by two universal functions. In the overdamped case, the behavior mirrors that of the acausal (diffusion) theory, which has recently been applied for precision tests of SK-EFT in diffusive systems. We suggest that our results in the underdamped limit can also be used for precision tests in quasi-diffusive systems.

Title: Two-Loop Turbulent Helical Magnetohydrodynamics: Large-Scale Dynamo and Energy Spectrum
Authors: Michal Hnatiƒç, Tom√°≈° Luƒçivjansk√Ω, Luk√°≈° Mi≈æi≈°in, Yurii Molotkov, Andrei Ovsiannikov
Abstract: We present a two-loop field-theoretic analysis of incompressible helical magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) in fully developed stationary turbulence. A key feature of helical MHD is the appearance of an infrared-unstable ``mass-like'' term in the loop diagrams of the magnetic response function. Physically, this term corresponds to the relevant perturbation of the Joule damping, proportional to $\boldsymbol{\nabla} \times \boldsymbol{b}$ ($\boldsymbol{b} =$ magnetic field). Its presence destabilizes the trivial ground state $\langle \boldsymbol{b} \rangle = 0$ and forces us to look for a mechanism for stabilizing the system. We show that such stabilization can be achieved in two ways: (i) by introducing into induction equation an external mass-like parameter that precisely cancels these dangerous loop corrections (kinematic regime), or (ii) via spontaneous breaking of the rotational symmetry, leading to a new ground state with nonzero large-scale magnetic field (turbulent dynamo regime). For the latter case, we study the two-loop correction to the spontaneously generated magnetic field and demonstrate that Goldstone-like corrections to Alfv√©n modes along with some other anisotropic structures arise. Our results also confirm that the emergent mean magnetic field leads to a steeper slope of the magnetic energy spectrum, $-11/3 + 2\gamma_{b\star}$ (with $\gamma_{b\star} = -0.1039 - 0.4202\rho^2$, for $|\rho| \leqslant 1$ as the degree of helicity), compared to the Kolmogorov velocity spectrum of $-11/3$, thereby breaking equipartition.

Title: How to use quantum computers for biomolecular free energies

Harrow, Anders Krogh, Troy Van Voorhis, Kresten Lindorff-Larsen, Gemma Solomon, Markus Reiher, Matthias Christandl
Abstract: Free energy calculations are at the heart of physics-based analyses of biochemical processes. They allow us to quantify molecular recognition mechanisms, which determine a wide range of biological phenomena from how cells send and receive signals to how pharmaceutical compounds can be used to treat diseases. Quantitative and predictive free energy calculations require computational models that accurately capture both the varied and intricate electronic interactions between molecules as well as the entropic contributions from motions of these molecules and their aqueous environment. However, accurate quantum-mechanical energies and forces can only be obtained for small atomistic models, not for large biomacromolecules. Here, we demonstrate how to consistently link accurate quantum-mechanical data obtained for substructures to the overall potential energy of biomolecular complexes by machine learning in an integrated algorithm. We do so using a two-fold quantum embedding strategy where the innermost quantum cores are treated at a very high level of accuracy. We demonstrate the viability of this approach for the molecular recognition of a ruthenium-based anticancer drug by its protein target, applying traditional quantum chemical methods. As such methods scale unfavorable with system size, we analyze requirements for quantum computers to provide highly accurate energies that impact the resulting free energies. Once the requirements are met, our computational pipeline FreeQuantum is able to make efficient use of the quantum computed energies, thereby enabling quantum computing enhanced modeling of biochemical processes. This approach combines the exponential speedups of quantum computers for simulating interacting electrons with modern classical simulation techniques that incorporate machine learning to model large molecules.

Title: Quantum master equation for nanoelectromechanical systems beyond the wide-band limit
Authors: Sofia Sevitz, Federico Cerisola, Janet Anders
Abstract: Coupling the vibrations of an oscillator to electronic transport is a key building block for nanoelectromechanical systems. They describe many nanoscale electrical components such as molecular junctions. Inspired by recent experimental developments, we derive a quantum master equation that describes nanoelectromechanical systems in a generally overlooked situation: when the electronic transport is slower than the natural frequency of the oscillator. Here, a semi-classical model is no longer valid and we develop the missing fully quantum approach. Moreover, we go beyond the wide-band limit and study the consequence of maintaining energy dependent tunneling rates, which are required to describe effects found in real devices. To benchmark our results, we compare with numerically exact results obtained with the hierarchical equations of motion method, and find overall good agreements in the experimentally accessible steady state regime. Furthermore, we derive from the microscopic model a ready to use particle current expression that replicates features already observed experimentally.

Title: Probing the Physical Reality of Projective Measurements
Authors: Leonard Werner Pingen, Mattia Moroder, Sebastian Paeckel
Abstract: We propose a protocol to test whether the postulate of a measurement acting as an instantaneous projection onto an eigenstate of the measurement apparatus is compatible with physical reality. This approach is solely based on repeated measurements of local quantities with frequencies that are within reach of analog quantum simulation platforms, for instance Rydberg atom arrays or ultracold gases in optical lattices. Crucially, we also develop a continuous description of a quantum measurement finding that its repeated-measurement statistics (RMS) drastically differ from the projective case. This description is based on very general assumptions about quantum systems, most importantly maintaining continuous dynamics of the coherent part of the state. Our findings imply that the significantly different measurement statistics in the collapse-free description should be qualitatively replicated by any modification of standard quantum theory that is lacking explicit wave-function collapses.

Title: Lost in Retraining: Roaming the Parameter Space of Exponential Families Under Closed-Loop Learning
Authors: Fariba Jangjoo, Matteo Marsili, Yasser Roudi
Abstract: Closed-loop learning is the process of repeatedly estimating a model from data generated from the model itself. It is receiving great attention due to the possibility that large neural network models may, in the future, be primarily trained with data generated by artificial neural networks themselves. We study this process for models that belong to exponential families, deriving equations of motions that govern the dynamics of the parameters. We show that maximum likelihood estimation of the parameters endows sufficient statistics with the martingale property and that as a result the process converges to absorbing states that amplify initial biases present in the data. However, we show that this outcome may be prevented by polluting the data with an infinitesimal fraction of data points generated from a fixed model, by relying on maximum a posteriori estimation or by introducing regularisation. Furthermore, we show that the asymptotic behavior of the dynamics is not reparametrisation invariant.

Abstract: Neutral atoms are a promising platform for quantum science, enabling advances in areas ranging from quantum simulations and computation to metrology, atomic clocks and quantum networking. While atom losses typically limit these systems to a pulsed mode, continuous operation could significantly enhance cycle rates, remove bottlenecks in metrology, and enable deep-circuit quantum evolution through quantum error correction. Here we demonstrate an experimental architecture for high-rate, continuous reloading and operation of a large-scale atom array system while realizing coherent storage and manipulation of quantum information. Our approach utilizes a series of two optical lattice conveyor belts to transport atom reservoirs into the science region, where atoms are repeatedly extracted into optical tweezers without affecting the coherence of qubits stored nearby. Using a reloading rate of 300,000 atoms in tweezers per second, we create over 30,000 initialized qubits per second, which we leverage to assemble and maintain an array of over 3,000 atoms for more than two hours. Furthermore, we demonstrate persistent refilling of the array with atomic qubits in either a spin-polarized or a coherent superposition state while preserving the quantum state of stored qubits. Our results pave the way for realization of large-scale continuously operated atomic clocks, sensors, and fault-tolerant quantum computers.

Abstract: Quantum error correction (QEC) is believed to be essential for the realization of large-scale quantum computers. However, due to the complexity of operating on the encoded `logical' qubits, understanding the physical principles for building fault-tolerant quantum devices and combining them into efficient architectures is an outstanding scientific challenge. Here we utilize reconfigurable arrays of up to 448 neutral atoms to implement all key elements of a universal, fault-tolerant quantum processing architecture and experimentally explore their underlying working mechanisms. We first employ surface codes to study how repeated QEC suppresses errors, demonstrating 2.14(13)x below-threshold performance in a four-round characterization circuit by leveraging atom loss detection and machine learning decoding. We then investigate logical entanglement using transversal gates and lattice surgery, and extend it to universal logic through transversal teleportation with 3D [[15,1,3]] codes, enabling arbitrary-angle synthesis with logarithmic overhead. Finally, we develop mid-circuit qubit re-use, increasing experimental cycle rates by two orders of magnitude and enabling deep-circuit protocols with dozens of logical qubits and hundreds of logical teleportations with [[7,1,3]] and high-rate [[16,6,4]] codes while maintaining constant internal entropy. Our experiments reveal key principles for efficient architecture design, involving the interplay between quantum logic and entropy removal, judiciously using physical entanglement in logic gates and magic state generation, and leveraging teleportations for universality and physical qubit reset. These results establish foundations for scalable, universal error-corrected processing and its practical implementation with neutral atom systems.

Title: Buckyballs directly probe inter-valley coherence in moire heterostructures
Authors: Tamaghna Hazra
Abstract: Moire materials like twisted bilayer graphene have emerged as a rich playground of strongly correlated physics, where the effect of interactions can be drastically enhanced by tuning the non-interacting density of states via twist angle. A key feature of bilayer graphene at small twist angles is that the two valleys of graphene are effectively decoupled at the non-interacting level, leading to an emergent U(1) symmetry corresponding to the conservation of valley-charge. Theoretical studies invariably find that short-ranged interactions tend to break this symmetry, leading to inter-valley coherence (IVC). Here, I propose an experimental signature of IVC order by coupling with a closely related system where valley-mixing is guaranteed - the pentagonal disclinations of graphene. Such disclinations are naturally found in fullerenes. The tunneling current between twisted bilayer graphene and an appropriately oriented large buckyball has a sharp signature of the onset of IVC order. Successfully integrating these fullerenes in a scanning tunneling microscope would allow spatial resolution of the IVC order parameter on a sub-moire scale. Experimentally constraining the broken symmetries and order parameters in the multitude of emerging correlated insulators is a crucial first step to understanding the superconductivity that develops on doping these exotic `normal' states.

Title: Memory-induced long-range order in dynamical systems
Authors: C. Sipling, Y.-H. Zhang, M. Di Ventra
Abstract: Time non-locality, or memory, is a non-equilibrium property shared by all physical systems. Here, we show that memory is sufficient to induce a phase of spatial long-range order (LRO) even if the system's primary dynamical variables are coupled locally. This occurs when the memory degrees of freedom have slower dynamics than the primary degrees of freedom. In addition, such an LRO phase is non-perturbative, and can be understood through the lens of a correlated percolation transition of the fast degrees of freedom mediated by memory. When the two degrees of freedom have comparable time scales, the length of the effective long-range interaction shortens. We exemplify this behavior with a model of locally coupled spins and a single dynamic memory variable, but our analysis is sufficiently general to suggest that memory could induce a phase of LRO in a much wider variety of physical systems.

Title: Standard model of electromagnetism and chirality in crystals
Authors: R. Winkler, U. Z√ºlicke
Abstract: We present a general, systematic theory of electromagnetism and chirality in crystalline solids. Symmetry is its basic guiding principle, enabling us to consider macroscopic multipole densities without reference to any specific microscopic configurations. We use a formal analogy between space inversion $i$ and time inversion $\theta$ to identify two complementary, comprehensive classifications of crystals, based on five categories of electric and magnetic multipole order--called polarizations--and five categories of chirality. The five categories of polarizations (parapolar, electropolar, magnetopolar, antimagnetopolar, and multipolar) embody the ways in which electromagnetic multipole order can be realized in solids, thus expanding the familiar notion of electric dipolarization in ferroelectrics and magnetization in ferromagnets to higher-order multipole densities. The five categories of chirality (parachiral, electrochiral, magnetochiral, antimagnetochiral, and multichiral) extend the notion of enantiomorphism--conventionally associated with the lack of spatial mirror symmetries--to include all possibilities for creating non-superposable images by applying the inversions $i$, $\theta$, and $i\theta$. In particular, multichiral systems lack all inversion symmetries and thus have four different enantiomorphs. Each category of chirality arises from particular superpositions of electric and magnetic multipole densities. Jointly, the categories of polarizations and chirality yield a classification of all 122 magnetic point groups into 12 types that exhibit distinct physical properties and are identifiable by characteristic features in the electronic band structure that we elucidate in detail. The classification makes the formal equivalence of $i$, $\theta$, and $i\theta$ explicit and reveals striking correspondences between apparently dissimilar systems and their physical properties.

Title: Droplets of Bosons at a Narrow Resonance
Authors: Ke Wang, Thimo Preis, Dam Thanh Son
Abstract: We consider bosons interacting through a narrow $s$-wave resonance. Such a resonance is characterized by an infinite scattering length and a large and negative effective range $r_0$. We argue that any number $N\ge3$ of bosons can form a self-bound cluster with the binding energy per particle increasing as $N^2$ for $1\ll N\ll (-r_0/a_\text{bg})^{1/2}$, where $a_\text{bg}$ is the background scattering length (between atoms and molecules). In the opposite limit $N\gg (-r_0/a_\text{bg})^{1/2}$, bosons form droplets with binding energy per particle saturating to a constant value independent of the particle number. The stability of clusters and droplets when the interaction is detuned from the resonance is also studied.

Title: Universal coherent atom-molecule oscillations in the dynamics of the unitary Bose gas near a narrow Feshbach resonance
Authors: Ke Wang, Zhendong Zhang, Shu Nagata, Zhiqiang Wang, K. Levin
Abstract: Quench experiments on a unitary Bose gas around a broad Feshbach resonance have led to the discovery of universal dynamics. This universality is manifested in the measured atomic momentum distributions where, asymptotically, a quasi-equilibrated metastable state is found in which both the momentum distribution and the time scales are determined by the particle density. In this paper we present counterpart studies but for the case of a very narrow Feshbach resonance of $^{133}$Cs atoms having a width of 8.3 mG. In dramatic contrast to the behavior reported earlier, a rapid quench of an atomic condensate to unitarity is observed to ultimately lead to coherent oscillations involving dynamically produced condensed and non-condensed molecules and atoms. The same characteristic frequency, determined by the Feshbach coupling, is observed in all types of particles. To understand these quench dynamics and how these different particle species are created, we develop a beyond Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov dynamical framework including a new type of cross correlation between atoms and molecules. This leads to a quantitative consistency with the measured frequency. Our results, which can be applied to the general class of bosonic superfluids associated with narrow Feshbach resonances, establish a new paradigm for universal dynamics dominated by quantum many-body interactions.

Title: Alteration of Topology in Quantum Phase Transitions via Symmetry Enrichment
Authors: Gabriel Rein, Marcin Raczkowski, Zhenjiu Wang, Toshihiro Sato, Fakher F. Assaad
Abstract: Topology plays a cardinal role in explaining phases and quantum phase transitions beyond the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson paradigm. In this study, we formulate a set of models of Dirac fermions in 2+1 dimensions with SU($N$)$\times$SU(2)$\times$U(1) symmetry that have the potential to host critical points described by field theories with topological terms. For $N=2$ it shows a rich phase diagram containing semimetallic, quantum spin Hall insulating, Kekul√© valence bond solid and s-wave superconducting phases and features multiple Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson phase transitions driven by interaction strength. At $N=1$ a deconfined quantum critical point is observed. At $N=2$ one expects the critical theory to correspond to a level 2 Wess-Zumino-Witten theory in 2+1 dimensions. Here the numerical results however show a strong first order transition. Another transition can be governed by a topological $\theta$-term which is rendered irrelevant for even values of $N$ thus leading to Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson behaviour.

Title: Tracking the Morphological Evolution of Neuronal Dendrites by First-Passage Analysis
Authors: Fabian H. Kreten, Barbara A. Niemeyer, Ludger Santen, Reza Shaebani
Abstract: A high degree of structural complexity arises in dynamic neuronal dendrites due to extensive branching patterns and diverse spine morphologies, which enable the nervous system to adjust function, construct complex input pathways and thereby enhance the computational power of the system. Owing to the determinant role of dendrite morphology in the functionality of the nervous system, recognition of pathological changes due to neurodegenerative disorders is of crucial importance. We show that the statistical analysis of a temporary signal generated by cargos that have diffusively passed through the complex dendritic structure yields vital information about dendrite morphology. As a feasible scenario, we propose engineering mRNA-carrying multilamellar liposomes to diffusively reach the soma and release mRNAs, which are translated into a specific protein upon encountering ribosomes. The concentration of this protein over a large population of neurons can be externally measured, as a detectable temporary signal. Using a stochastic coarse-grained approach for first-passage through dendrites, we connect the key morphological properties affected by neurodegenerative diseases -- including the density and size of spines, the extent of the tree, and the segmental increase of dendrite diameter towards soma -- to the characteristics of the evolving signal. Thus, we establish a direct link between the dendrite morphology and the statistical characteristics of the detectable signal. Our approach provides a fast noninvasive measurement technique to indirectly extract vital information about the morphological evolution of dendrites in the course of neurodegenerative disease progression.

Title: Intrinsic Thermal Hall Effect in Mott Insulators
Authors: Jixun K. Ding, Emily Z. Zhang, Wen O. Wang, Tessa Cookmeyer, Brian Moritz, Yong Baek Kim, Thomas P. Devereaux
Abstract: In light of recent experimental data indicating a substantial thermal Hall effect in square lattice antiferromagnetic Mott insulators, we investigate whether a simple Mott insulator can sustain a finite thermal Hall effect. We verify that the answer is "no" if one performs calculations within a spin-only low-energy effective spin model with non-interacting magnons. However, by performing determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we show the single-band $t$-$t'$-$U$ Hubbard model coupled to an orbital magnetic field does support a finite thermal Hall effect when $t' \neq 0$ and $B \neq 0$ in the Mott insulating phase. We argue that the (carrier agnostic) necessary conditions for observing a finite thermal Hall effect are time-reversal and particle-hole symmetry breaking. By considering magnon-magnon scattering using a semi-classical Boltzmann analysis, we illustrate a physical mechanism by which finite transverse thermal conductivity may arise, consistent with our symmetry argument and numerical results. Our results contradict the conventional wisdom that square and triangular lattices with SU(2) symmetry do not support a finite thermal Hall effect and call for a critical re-examination of thermal Hall effect data in insulating magnets, as the magnon contribution should not be excluded a priori.

Title: Non-Stationary Critical Phenomena: Expanding The Critical Point
Authors: Richard E. Spinney, Richard G. Morris
Abstract: A prototypical model of symmetry-broken active matter -- biased quorum-sensing active particles (bQSAPs) -- is used to extend notions of dynamic critical phenomena to the paradigmatic setting of driven transport, where characteristic behaviours are nonstationary and involve persistent fluxes. To do so, we construct an effective field theory with a single order-parameter -- a nonstationary analogue of active Model B -- that reflects the fact that different properties of bQSAPs can only be interpreted in terms of passive thermodynamics in appropriately chosen inertial frames. This codifies the movement of phase boundaries due to nonequilibrium fluxes between coexisting bulk phases in terms of a difference in effective chemical potentials and therefore an {\it unequal} tangent construction on a bulk free energy density. The result is both an anomalous form of coarsening and, more generally, an exotic phase structure; binodals are permitted to cross spinodal lines so that criticality is no longer constrained to a single point. Instead, criticality, with exponents that are seemingly unchanged from symmetric QSAPs, is shown to exist along a line that marks the entry to an otherwise forbidden region of phase space. The interior of this region is not critical in the conventional sense, but retains certain features of criticality, which we term pseudo-critical. Whilst an inability to satisfy a Ginzburg criterion implies that fluctuations remain relevant at macroscopic scales, finite-wavenumber fluctuations grow at finite rates and exhibit non-trivial dispersion relations. The interplay between the growth of fluctuations and the speed at which they move relative to the bulk results in distinct regimes of micro- and meso-phase separation.

Title: Two apparently different interfacial stress formulations constructed from the diffuse interface free energy model
Authors: Takeshi Omori
Abstract: To express the capillary stress in the diffuse interface method, there are two different formulations in the literature: one formulation is proportional to the density and the other is to the density gradient. Confusingly, these two apparently different formulations both have been widely used for the same purpose without much attention in the difference. In the present study, we theoretically show that only the latter represents the capillary stress and the former represents the stress due to the non-equilibrium irreversible process in the fluid. The formulations are analyzed not only for the one-component fluid but also for the multi-component fluid. In the prediction of the incompressible flow of one-component fluids, the two formulations turn out to give the identical velocity field, but not the pressure field even in this case.

Title: Global thermodynamics for isothermal fluids under gravity
Authors: Naoko Nakagawa, Shin-ichi Sasa, Takamichi Hirao, Tsuyoshi Shiina, Kyosuke Tachi, Akira Yoshida
Abstract: We develop a formulation of global thermodynamics for equilibrium systems under the influence of gravity. The free energy for simple fluids is extended to include a dependence on $(T, V, N, mgL)$, where $L$ represents the vertical system length in the direction of gravity. A central idea in this formulation is to uniquely fix the reference point of the gravitational potential, ensuring a consistent thermodynamic framework. Using this framework, we derive the probability density of thermodynamic quantities, which allows us to define a variational function for determining equilibrium liquid-gas coexistence under gravity. The resulting free energy landscape, derived from the variational function, reveals the local stability of liquid-gas configurations. Specifically, the liquid phase resides at the lower portion of the system due to gravity, while the inverted configuration (with liquid on top) is also locally stable in this landscape. Furthermore, we characterize the transition between these liquid-gas configurations as a first-order phase transition using the thermodynamic free energy of $(T,V,N,mgL)$. Finally, we validate the predictions of global thermodynamics through molecular dynamics simulations, demonstrating the applicability and accuracy of the proposed framework.

Title: Measurement-Induced Phase Transition in State Estimation of Chaotic Systems and the Directed Polymer
Authors: Federico Gerbino, Guido Giachetti, Pierre Le Doussal, Andrea De Luca
Abstract: We introduce a solvable model of a measurement-induced phase transition (MIPT) in a deterministic but chaotic dynamical system with a positive Lyapunov exponent. In this setup, an observer only has a probabilistic description of the system but mitigates chaos-induced uncertainty through repeated measurements. Using a minimal representation via a branching tree, we map this problem to the directed polymer (DP) model on the Cayley tree, although in a regime dominated by rare events. By studying the Shannon entropy of the probability distribution estimated by the observer, we demonstrate a phase transition distinguishing a chaotic phase with reduced Lyapunov exponent from a strong-measurement phase where uncertainty remains bounded. Remarkably, the location of the MIPT transition coincides with the freezing transition of the DP, although the critical properties differ. We provide an exact, universal scaling function describing the entropy growth in the critical regime. Numerical simulations confirm our theoretical predictions, highlighting a simple yet powerful framework to explore measurement-induced transitions in classical chaotic systems.

Title: Design and benchmarks for emulating Kondo dynamics on a quantum chip
Authors: Soumyadeep Sarma, Jukka I. V√§yrynen, Elio J. K√∂nig
Abstract: Motivated by recent advances in digital quantum simulation and the overall prospective of solving correlated many-electron problems using quantum algorithms, we design a gate-based quantum circuit that emulates the dynamics of the Kondo impurity model. We numerically determine the impurity magnetization, entanglement between impurity and fermionic sites and energy as a function of time (i.e.~circuit depth) for various initial states and find universal long-time dynamics. We complement the numerical simulations for moderate system size with an asymptotically exact analytical solution that is effective in the limit of large system sizes and for starting states corresponding to a filled Fermi sea. This work opens up the perspective of studying the dynamics of electronic quantum many-body states on quantum chips of the NISQ era.

Title: Simultaneous achievement of large anomalous Nernst effect and reduced thermal conductivity in sintered polycrystalline topological Heusler ferromagnets
Authors: Koichi Oyanagi, Hossein Sepehri-Amin, Kenta Takamori, Terumasa Tadano, Takumi Imamura, Ren Nagasawa, Krishnan Mahalingam, Takamasa Hirai, Fuyuki Ando, Yuya Sakuraba, Satoru Kobayashi, Ken-ichi Uchida
Abstract: This study reports the observation of the large anomalous Nernst effect in polycrystalline ferromagnetic Co$_{2}$MnGa (CMG) slabs prepared by a spark plasma sintering method. By optimizing the sintering conditions, the anomalous Nernst coefficient reaches ~7.5 $\mu$V K$^{-1}$ at room temperature, comparable to the highest value reported in the single-crystalline CMG slabs. Owing to the sizable anomalous Nernst coefficient and reduced thermal conductivity, the dimensionless figure of merit in our optimized CMG slab shows the record-high value of ~8$\times$10$^{-4}$ at room temperature. With the aid of the nano/microstructure characterization and first-principles phonon calculation, this study discusses the dependence of the transport properties on the degree of crystalline ordering and morphology of crystal-domain boundaries in the sintered CMG slabs. The results reveal a potential of polycrystalline topological materials for transverse thermoelectric applications, enabling the construction of large-scale modules.

Title: WyckoffDiff -- A Generative Diffusion Model for Crystal Symmetry
Authors: Filip Ekstr√∂m Kelvinius, Oskar B. Andersson, Abhijith S. Parackal, Dong Qian, Rickard Armiento, Fredrik Lindsten
Abstract: Crystalline materials often exhibit a high level of symmetry. However, most generative models do not account for symmetry, but rather model each atom without any constraints on its position or element. We propose a generative model, Wyckoff Diffusion (WyckoffDiff), which generates symmetry-based descriptions of crystals. This is enabled by considering a crystal structure representation that encodes all symmetry, and we design a novel neural network architecture which enables using this representation inside a discrete generative model framework. In addition to respecting symmetry by construction, the discrete nature of our model enables fast generation. We additionally present a new metric, Fr√©chet Wrenformer Distance, which captures the symmetry aspects of the materials generated, and we benchmark WyckoffDiff against recently proposed generative models for crystal generation. As a proof-of-concept study, we use WyckoffDiff to find new materials below the convex hull of thermodynamical stability.

Title: Real-space representation of the second Chern number
Authors: T. Shiina, F. Hamano, T. Fukui
Abstract: We extend Kitaev's real-space formulation of the first Chern number to the second Chern number and establish a computational framework for its evaluation. To test its validity, we apply the derived formula to the disordered Wilson-Dirac model and analyze its ability to capture topological properties in the presence of disorder. Our results demonstrate that the real-space approach provides a viable method for characterizing higher-dimensional topological phases beyond momentum-space formulations.

Title: Superconductivity in doped planar Dirac insulators: A renormalization group study
Authors: Sk Asrap Murshed, Sanjib Kumar Das, Bitan Roy
Abstract: From a leading-order unbiased renormalization group analysis we here showcase the emergence of superconductivity (including the topological ones) from purely repulsive electron-electron interactions in two-dimensional doped Dirac insulators, featuring a Fermi surface. In the absence of chemical doping, such systems describe quantum anomalous or spin Hall and normal insulators. Otherwise a simply connected Fermi surface becomes annular deep inside the topological regime. By considering all symmetry allowed repulsive local four-fermion interactions, we show that the nature of the resulting superconducting states at low temperature follows certain Clifford algebraic selection rules, irrespective of the underlying Fermi surface topology. Within the framework of a microscopic Hubbard model, on-site repulsion among fermions with opposite orbitals (spin projections) typically favors topological $p$-wave (conventional $s$-wave) pairing. Theoretically predicted superconductivity can in principle be observed in experiments once the promising candidate materials for quantum anomalous and spin Hall insulators are doped to foster Fermi surfaces.

Title: Ionic-bond-driven atom-bridged room-temperature Cooper pairing in cuprates and nickelates: a theoretical framework supported by 32 experimental evidences
Authors: Jun-jie Shi, Yao-hui Zhu
Abstract: Unlike ordinary conductors and semiconductors, which conduct electricity through individual electrons, superconductors usually conduct electricity through pairs of electrons, known as Cooper pairs. Even after 4 decades of intense study, no one knows what holds electrons together in complex high-$T_\mathrm{c}$ cuprates and nickelates. Here, targeting the critical challenge of the pairing mechanism behind high-$T_\mathrm{c}$ superconductivity in oxides, we create a new theoretical framework by standing on the foundation of the chemical-bond$\rightarrow$structure$\rightarrow$property relationship. Considering the dominance of eV-scale ionic bonding, affinity of O$^-$ (1.46 eV) and O$^{2-}$ (-8.08 eV) and large second ionization energy ($\sim$10-20 eV) of metal atoms, we propose a groundbreaking idea of electron e$^-$ (hole h$^+$) pairing bridged by oxygen O (metal M) atoms, i.e., the ionic-bond-driven e$^-$-O-e$^-$ (h$^+$-M-h$^+$) itinerant Cooper pairing, by following the principle of "tracing electron footprints to explore pairing mechanisms". Its correctness and universality are confirmed by 32 diverse experimental evidences, especially, the STM topographic image combining with small Cooper-pair size. Any other sub-eV and covalent-binding pairing mechanisms would be doubtful. Our findings resolve a 40-year puzzle of the microscopic mechanism for high-$T_\mathrm{c}$ superconductivity and validate the feasibility of room-temperature carrier-pairing in ionic-bonded superconductors, bringing the dream of room-temperature superconductivity one step closer.

Title: 3D variational autoencoder for fingerprinting microstructure volume elements
Authors: Michael D. White, Michael D. Atkinson, Adam J. Plowman, Pratheek Shanthraj
Abstract: Microstructure quantification is an important step towards establishing structure-property relationships in materials. Machine learning-based image processing methods have been shown to outperform conventional image processing techniques and are increasingly applied to microstructure quantification tasks. In this work, we present a 3D variational autoencoder (VAE) for encoding microstructure volume elements (VEs) comprising voxelated crystallographic orientation data. Crystal symmetries in the orientation space are accounted for by mapping to the crystallographic fundamental zone as a preprocessing step, which allows for a continuous loss function to be used and improves the training convergence rate. The VAE is then used to encode a training set of VEs with an equiaxed polycrystalline microstructure with random texture. Accurate reconstructions are achieved with a relative average misorientation error of 3x10^-2 on the test dataset, for a continuous latent space with dimension 256. We show that the model generalises well to microstructures with textures, grain sizes and aspect ratios outside the training distribution. Structure-property relationships are explored through using the training set of VEs as initial configurations in various crystal plasticity (CP) simulations. Microstructural fingerprints extracted from the VAE, which parameterise the VEs in a low-dimensional latent space, are stored alongside the volume-averaged stress response, at each strain increment, to uniaxial tensile deformation from CP simulations. This is then used to train a fully connected neural network mapping the input fingerprint to the resulting stress response, which acts as a surrogate model for the CP simulation. The fingerprint-based surrogate model is shown to accurately predict the microstructural dependence in the CP stress response, with a relative mean-squared error of 2.75 MPa on unseen test data.

Title: Effective and asymptotic scaling in a one-dimensional billiard problem
Authors: T. Holovatch, Yu. Kozitsky, K. Pilorz, Yu. Holovatch
Abstract: The emergence of power laws that govern the large-time dynamics of a one-dimensional billiard of $N$ point particles is analysed. In the initial state, the resting particles are placed in the positive half-line $x\geqslant 0$ at equal distances. Their masses alternate between two distinct values. The dynamics is initialized by giving the leftmost particle a positive velocity. Due to elastic inter-particle collisions, the whole system gradually comes into motion, filling both right-hand and left-hand half-lines. As shown by [Chakraborti S., Dhar A., Krapivsky P., SciPost Phys., 2022, 13, 074], an inherent feature of such a billiard is the emergence of two different modes: the shock wave that propagates in $x\geqslant 0$ and the splash region in $x<0$. Moreover, the behaviour of the relevant observables is characterized by universal asymptotic power-law dependencies. In view of the finite size of the system and of finite observation times, these dependencies only start to acquire a universal character. To analyse them, we set up molecular dynamics simulations using the concept of effective scaling exponents, familiar in the theory of continuous phase transitions. We present results for the effective exponents that govern the large-time behaviour of the shock-wave front, the number of collisions, the energies and momentum of different modes and analyse their tendency to approach corresponding universal values.

Title: Thermodynamic interpretation to Stochastic Fisher Information and Single-Trajectory Speed Limits
Authors: Pedro B. Melo, Fernando Iemini, Diogo O. Soares-Pinto, S√≠lvio M. Duarte Queir√≥s, Welles A. M. Morgado
Abstract: The Fisher information (FI) metric is a Riemannian metric that allows a geometric treatment of stochastic thermodynamics, introducing the possibility of computing thermodynamic lengths and deviations from equilibrium. At the trajectory level, a related quantity can be introduced, the stochastic Fisher information (SFI), which on average, is equivalent to the FI. In this work, we discuss two fundamental questions regarding the SFI; namely, (i) what is the thermodynamic interpretation to the SFI, and (ii) are there any trajectory-level thermodynamic bounds . We find that, contrary to previous results in the literature for the FI, the thermodynamic interpretation of the SFI depends only on the entropy produced by the system and on the thermodynamic force. Moreover, we find that the SFI allows one to derive single-trajectory speed limits, which we demonstrate to hold for a Brownian particle under a saturating drive force and a Brownian particle under a decreasing drive force. From the ensemble of single-trajectory bounds, one can derive a hierarchy of average speed limits that are always less tight than the one derived from the FI. We test our results for speed limits on the adopted models and find that the hierarchy of average speed limits is respected and that the single-trajectory speed limits behave qualitatively similar to the average and stochastic speed limits, with some trajectories achieving velocities higher than the tightest average bound whenever it does not saturate. Our results open avenues for the exploration of uncertainty relations at the trajectory level.

Title: Characterizing the embedded states of a fluorescent probe within a lipid bilayer using molecular dynamics simulations
Authors: Ryo Okabe, Natsuumi Ito, Yuya Matsubara, Nozomi Morishita Watanabe, Hiroshi Umakoshi, Kento Kasahara, Nobuyuki Matubayasi
Abstract: The physicochemical properties of lipid bilayers (membranes) are closely associated with various cellular functions and are often evaluated using absorption and fluorescence spectroscopies. For instance, by employing fluorescent probes that exhibit spectra reflective of the surrounding membrane environment, one can estimate the membrane polarity. Thus, elucidating how such probes are embedded within the membranes would be beneficial for enabling a deeper interpretation of the spectra. Here, we apply molecular dynamics (MD) simulation with an enhanced sampling method to investigate the embedded state of 6-propionyl-2-dimethylaminonaphthalene (Prodan) within a membrane composed of 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC), as well as its variation upon the addition of ethanol as a cosolvent to the aqueous phase. In the absence of ethanol, it is found that the bulky moieties of Prodan (propionyl and dimethylamine groups) prefer to be oriented toward the membrane center owing to the voids existing near the center. The structural change in the membrane induced by the addition of ethanol causes a reduction in the void population near the center, resulting in a diminished orientation preference of Prodan.

Title: Weak localization as probe of spin-orbit-induced spin-split bands in bilayer graphene proximity coupled to WSe$_2$
Authors: E. Icking, F. W√∂rtche, A.W. Cummings, A. W√∂rtche, K. Watanabe, T. Taniguchi, C. Volk, B. Beschoten, C. Stampfer
Abstract: Proximity coupling of bilayer graphene (BLG) to transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) offers a promising route to engineer gate-tunable spin-orbit coupling (SOC) while preserving BLG's exceptional electronic properties. This tunability arises from the layer-asymmetric electronic structure of gapped BLG, where SOC acts predominantly on the layer in contact with the TMD. Here, we present high-quality BLG/WSe$_2$ devices with a proximity-induced SOC gap and excellent electrostatic control. Operating in a quasi-ballistic regime, our double-gated heterostructures allow to form gate-defined p-n-p cavities and show clear weak anti-localization (WAL) features consistent with Rashba-type SOC. At lower hole densities, a transition to weak localization (WL) is observed, signaling transport through a single spin-split valence band. These findings - in agreement with calculations - provide direct spectroscopic evidence of proximity-induced spin-split band in BLG and underscore the potential of BLG/TMD heterostructures for spintronics and spin-based quantum technologies.

Title: Probing the semiconductor-to-dirac semimetal transition in Na-Sb-Bi alloys with x-ray Compton scattering

Abstract: We discuss electron redistribution during the semiconductor-to-Dirac semimetal transition in Na-Sb-Bi alloys using x-ray Compton scattering experiments combined with first-principles electronic structure modeling. A robust signature of the semiconductor-to-Dirac semimetal transition is identified in the spherically averaged Compton profile. We demonstrate how the number of electrons involved in this transition can be estimated to provide a novel descriptor for quantifying the strength of spin-orbit coupling responsible for driving the transition. The associated theoretical deviation of the Born charge of Na in Na$_3$Bi from the expected ionic charge of +1 is found to be consistent with the corresponding experimental value of about 10%. Our study also shows the sensitivity of the Compton scattering technique toward capturing the spillover of Bi 6p relativistic states onto Na sites.

Title: Pressure-Driven Metallicity in √Öngstr√∂m-Thickness 2D Bismuth and Layer-Selective Ohmic Contact to MoS2
Authors: Shuhua Wang, Shibo Fang, Qiang Li, Yunliang Yue, Zongmeng Yang, Xiaotian Sun, Jing Lu, Chit Siong Lau, L. K. Ang, Lain-Jong Li, Yee Sin Ang
Abstract: Recent fabrication of two-dimensional (2D) metallic bismuth (Bi) via van der Waals (vdW) squeezing method opens a new avenue to ultrascaling metallic materials into the √•ngstr√∂m-thickness regime [Nature 639, 354 (2025)]. However, freestanding 2D Bi is typically known to exhibit a semiconducting phase [Nature 617, 67 (2023), Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 236801 (2023)], which contradicts with the experimentally observed metallicity in vdW-squeezed 2D Bi. Here we show that such discrepancy originates from the pressure-induced buckled-to-flat structural transition in 2D Bi, which changes the electronic structure from semiconducting to metallic phases. Based on the experimentally fabricated MoS2-Bi-MoS2 trilayer heterostructure, we demonstrate the concept of layer-selective Ohmic contact in which one MoS2 layer forms Ohmic contact to the sandwiched Bi monolayer while the opposite MoS2 layer exhibits a Schottky barrier. The Ohmic contact can be switched between the two sandwiching MoS2 monolayers by changing the polarity of an external gate field, thus enabling charge to be spatially injected into different MoS2 layers. The layer-selective Ohmic contact proposed here represents a layertronic generalization of metal/semiconductor contact, paving a way towards layertronic device application.

Title: A consistent description of the kinetic processes of electrolyte ion transport in a dynamic porous medium
Authors: P. P. Kostrobij, B. M. Markovych, O. V. Viznovych, M. V. Tokarchuk
Abstract: The consistent description of kinetic and hydrodynamic processes is applied to the study of ion transport processes in the ionic solution-porous medium system. A system of equations is obtained for the nonequilibrium single-ion distribution function, the nonequilibrium average value of the energy density of the interaction of solution ions, and the nonequilibrium average value of the number density of particles in a porous medium. Using the fractional calculus technique, a generalized diffusion equation of the Cattaneo type in fractional derivatives is obtained to describe the processes of subdiffusion of particles in a porous medium.

Title: Elastic properties of fluid mercury across the metal-nonmetal transition: Ab initio simulation study
Authors: T. Bryk, O. Bakai, A. P. Seitsonen
Abstract: We report an ab initio molecular dynamics study of fluid mercury at temperature 1750 K in the range of densities 7-13.5 g/cm$^3$. Along this isothermal line we performed an analysis of total charge fluctuations, which make evidence of neutral atom-like screening in fluid Hg for densities less than 9.25 g/cm$^3$, which practically coincides with the emergence of the gap in electronic density of states. High-frequency shear modulus, high-frequency and adiabatic speeds of sound, shear viscosity, Maxwell relaxation time and dispersion of collective excitations are analyzed as a function of density along the isothermal line.

Title: Tunable corner states in topological insulators with long-range hoppings and diverse shapes
Authors: Fang Qin, Rui Chen
Abstract: In this work, we develop a theoretical framework for the control of corner modes in higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs) featuring long-range hoppings and diverse geometries, enabling precise tunability of their spatial positions. First, we demonstrate that the locations of corner states can be finely tuned by varying long-range hoppings in a circular HOTI, as revealed by a detailed edge theory analysis and the condition of vanishing Dirac mass. Moreover, we show that long-range hoppings along different directions (e.g., $x$ and $y$) have distinct effects on the positioning of corner states. Second, we investigate HOTIs with various polygonal geometries and find that the presence and location of corner modes depend sensitively on the shape. In particular, a corner hosts a localized mode if the Dirac masses of its two adjacent edges have opposite signs, while no corner mode emerges if the masses share the same sign. Our findings offer a versatile approach for the controlled manipulation of corner modes in HOTIs, opening new avenues for the design and implementation of higher-order topological materials.

Title: On the diffusion of hard sphere fluids in disordered porous media: New extended Enskog theory description
Authors: M. F. Holovko, M. Ya. Korvatska
Abstract: We proposed a new extended version of Enskog theory for the description of the self-diffusion coefficient of a colloidal hard-sphere fluid adsorbed in a matrix of disordered hard-sphere obstacles. In a considered approach instead of contact values of the fluid-fluid and fluid-matrix pair distribution functions, we introduced by input the new functions that include the dependence on the fraction of the volume free from matrix particles and from fluid particles trapped by matrix particles. It is shown that the introduction of this free volume fraction by the Fermi-like distribution leads to the best agreement between theoretical predictions and computer simulation results [Chang R., Jagannathan K., Yethiraj A., Phys. Rev. E, 2004, 69, 051101].

Title: Mutual effect of charge- and number-density correlations in ionic liquids and concentrated electrolytes
Authors: O. Patsahan, A. Ciach
Abstract: Correlation functions in concentrated ionic systems are studied within the mesoscopic theory at the level of the Gaussian approximation. The previously neglected fluctuation contribution to the inverse charge-charge correlation function is taken into account to verify the accuracy of the previous results. We calculate the correlation lengths and the amplitudes and show that the fluctuation contribution does not lead to significant changes of the results. We also derive necessary conditions for the presence of both, the oscillatory and the monotonic decays of the charge-charge correlations that must be satisfied by the noncoulombic contributions to the inverse charge-charge correlation function. At the level of the Gaussian approximation, these conditions are not satisfied. Extension of the theory beyond the Gaussian approximation is necessary to verify whether the asymptotic decay of the charge-charge correlations is monotonous or oscillatory, as suggested by the surface force apparatus or by the SAXS experiments, respectively.

Title: Replica RISM molecular solvation theory for electric double layer in nanoporous materials
Authors: A. Kovalenko
Abstract: Applications of 3D-RISM-KH molecular solvation theory range from solvation energy of small molecules to phase behavior of polymers and biomolecules. It predicts the molecular mechanisms of chemical and biomolecular systems. Replica RISM-KH-VM molecular solvation theory predicts and explains the structure, thermodynamics, and electrochemistry of electrolyte solutions sorbed in a nanoporous material. It was tested on nanoporous carbon supercapacitors with aqueous electrolyte and nanoporous electrosorption cells. The mechanisms in these systems are steered by the electric double layer potential drop across the Stern layer at the nanopores surface and the Gouy-Chapman layer averaged over the nanoporous material, the osmotic term due to the ionic concentrations difference in the two nanoporous electrodes and in the electrolyte solution outside, and the solvation chemical potentials of sorbed ions averaged over the nanoporous material. The latter strongly depends on chemical specificity of ions, solvent, surface functional groups, and steric effects for solvated ions confined in nanopores.

Title: Liquid-gas state regularities as a manifestation of global isomorphism with the Ising model
Authors: L. A. Bulavin, V. L. Kulinskii, A. M. Katts, A. M. Maslechko
Abstract: Liquid-gas equilibrium is considered using the global isomorphism with the Ising-like (lattice gas) model. Such an approach assumes the existence of the order parameter in terms of which the symmetry of binodal is restored not only in the vicinity of the critical point (critical isomorphism) but also globally in the whole coexistence region. We show how the empirical law of the rectilinear density diameter of the liquid-gas binodal allows us to derive a rather simple form of the isomorphism transformation between the fluid and lattice gas model of Ising-type. The relations for critical parameters which follow from such isomorphism are tested on a variety of fluid systems, both real and model ones. Moreover, we consider the phase equilibrium in polymer solutions and the Flory $\theta$-point as the extreme state of such equilibrium within our approach. The most crucial testing in 2D case is using the Onsager exact solution of the Ising model, and we represent the results of our approach to the calculation of critical point parameters of monolayers for noble gases and the surface tension.

Title: Towards construction of microscopic model for smart coating of a solid surface
Authors: O. Pizio
Abstract: The density functional approach for classical associating fluids is used to explore the wetting phase diagrams for model systems consisting of water and graphite-like solid surfaces chemically modified by a small amount of grafted chain molecules. The water-like fluid model is adopted from the work of Clark et al. [Mol. Phys., 104, 3561 (2006)]. It very well describes the bulk water vapor-liquid coexistence. Each chain molecule consists of tangentially bonded hard sphere segments. We focus on the investigation of the growth of water film on such complex substrates and exploration of the wetting behavior. For grafted monomers, the prewetting phase diagrams are similar to the diagrams for water on a non-modified solid surface. However, for grafted trimers and pentamers, a physically much richer behavior is observed and analyzed. Trends of the behavior of the wetting temperature and the prewetting critical temperature on the grafting density and water-segments attraction are discussed in detail.

Title: Microcanonical simulated annealing: Massively parallel Monte Carlo simulations with sporadic random-number generation

Abstract: Numerical simulations of models and theories that describe complex experimental systems $\unicode{x2014}$in fields like high-energy and condensed-matter physics$\unicode{x2014}$ are becoming increasingly important. Examples include lattice gauge theories, which can describe, among others, quantum chromodynamics (the Standard Model description of strong interactions between elementary particles), and spin-glass systems. Beyond fundamental research, these computational methods also find practical applications, among many others, in optimization, finance, and complex biological problems. However, Monte Carlo simulations, an important subcategory of these methods, are plagued by a major drawback: they are extremely greedy for (pseudo) random numbers. The total fraction of computer time dedicated to random-number generation increases as the hardware grows more sophisticated, and can get prohibitive for special-purpose computing platforms. We propose here a general-purpose microcanonical simulated annealing (MicSA) formalism that dramatically reduces such a burden. The algorithm is fully adapted to a massively parallel computation, as we show in the particularly demanding benchmark of the three-dimensional Ising spin glass. We carry out very stringent numerical tests of the new algorithm by comparing our results, obtained on GPUs, with high-precision standard (i.e., random-number-greedy) simulations performed on the Janus II custom-built supercomputer. In those cases where thermal equilibrium is reachable (i.e., in the paramagnetic phase), both simulations reach compatible values. More significantly, barring short-time corrections, a simple time rescaling suffices to map the MicSA off-equilibrium dynamics onto the results obtained with standard simulations.

Title: Statistical theory of charged particle systems including triple bound states -- and the Collaboration Lviv-Rostock
Authors: W. Ebeling
Abstract: Honoring the hundredth anniversary of the birthday of Ihor R. Yuknovskii we analyze new developments in the statistical thermodynamics of Coulomb systems. The basic idea of this work is to demonstrate that the exponential potential used in the first papers of Yukhnovskii is an appropriate reference system for a description of classical and quantum charged particle systems. We briefly discuss the collaboration between the groups of Ihor R. Yuknovskii in Lviv and G√ºnter Kelbg in Rostock and analyze several approaches based on pair correlation functions and cluster expansion in the classical as well as in the quantum case. Finally, we discuss the progress in the statistical description of bound states of three particles as in helium plasmas and in MgCl$_2$-solutions in the classical case and present new results regarding the influence of three-particle bound states. In particular, we give new expressions for the cluster integrals and the mass action functions of helium atoms and ionic triple associates as well as for the equation of state (EoS).

Abstract: We investigate the effect of the excluded volume of surfactant ligands on the shape of incipient quantum dots (QDs) to which they are attached. We consider a model in which ligands are represented by hard-sphere particles that are bound to the surface of a nanoparticle (NC) that is cast in the shape of a prism. It is found in Monte Carlo simulations that the ensemble of relevant NC conformations consists of a small number of specific states that take on the form of nanoplates and nanorods. The shape of these states can be well described by the derived theoretical models. At increasing ligand density, the free energy of different states is seen to be approximately the same, suggesting that excluded volume interactions among ligands acts to narrow down the conformational space accessible to an NC without creating a statistical preference for any particular configuration.

Title: Method of canonical transformations in the theory of quantum gases interacting with radiation
Authors: M. S. Bulakhov, A. S. Peletminskii, P. P. Kostrobij, I. A. Ryzha, Yu. V. Slyusarenko
Abstract: An approach to the theoretical study of effects and phenomena in quantum gases interacting with radiation is proposed. The approach is based on a modification of the canonical transformation method, which was once used to diagonalize Hamiltonians describing the interaction of electrons with phonons in a solid. The capabilities of the method are demonstrated by studying the influence of photons on the spectral characteristics of atoms of quantum gases interacting with radiation. Within the framework of the developed approach, the effect of "dressing" atoms of quantum gases by a cloud of virtual photons is investigated and expressions for the energy characteristics of such dressed atoms - quasiparticles are obtained. The problem of defining the concept of the effective mass of such quasiparticles is discussed.

Title: Topological characterization of magnon-polaron bands and thermal Hall conductivity in a frustrated kagome antiferromagnet
Authors: Shreya Debnath, Kuntal Bhattacharyya, Saurabh Basu
Abstract: Spin-phonon coupling and its efficacy in inducing multiple topological phase transitions in a frustrated kagome antiferromagnet have been rare in literature. To this end, we study the ramifications of invoking optical phonons in such a system via two different coupling mechanisms, namely, a local and a non-local one, which are distinct in their microscopic origin. In case of the local spin-phonon coupling, a single phonon mode affects the magnetic interactions, whereas in the non-local case, two neighbouring phonon modes are involved in the energy renormalization, and it would be worthwhile to compare and contrast between the two. To tackle these phonons, we propose an analytic approach involving a canonical spin-Peierls transformation applied to magnons. The formalism renders a hybridization between the magnons and the phonon modes, yielding magnon-polaron quasiparticles. In both the coupling regimes, validations for the topological signatures are systematically derived from the bulk and edge spectral properties of the magnon-polaron bands that are characterized by their corresponding Chern numbers. Thereafter, we investigate transitions from one topological phase to another solely via tuning the spin-phonon coupling strength. Moreover, these transitions significantly impact the behavior of the thermal Hall conductivity that aids in discerning distinct topological phases. Additionally, the explicit dependencies on the temperature and the external magnetic field are explored in inducing topological phase transitions associated with the magnon-polaron bands. Thus, our work serves as an ideal platform to probe the interplay of frustrated magnetism and polaronic physics.

Title: SeWS/bilayer-SiC heterojunction: An S-scheme photocatalyst with high visible-light absorption, excellent carrier mobility and adjustable band gap
Authors: Liuzhu Yang, Wenhui Wan, Zhicui Wang, Qiuyue Ma, Yanfeng Ge, Yong Liu
Abstract: Vertically stacked heterojunctions have garnered significant attention for their tunable electronic structures and photocatalytic performance, making them promising candidates for next-generation nanodevices. Using first-principles calculations, we systematically investigate the electronic structure, optical characteristics, and charge transfer of WSSe/SiC heterojunctions. Our results reveal that SeWS/monolayer-SiC, SeWS/bilayer-SiC, and SWSe/monolayer-SiC exhibit type-II band alignment, whereas SWSe/bilayer-SiC displays type-I alignment. Notably, SeWS/bilayer-SiC possesses a direct bandgap, in contrast to the indirect bandgaps of the other three configurations. Remarkably, the SeWS/bilayer-SiC heterojunction demonstrates a high absorption coefficient ($10^{5}~\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$) in the visible range and exhibits exceptional anisotropy in carrier transport, with an outstanding hole mobility of $9.58 \times 10^{3}~\mathrm{cm}^{2}\,\mathrm{V}^{-1}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ along the Y-direction. Furthermore, combining thermodynamic stability with an S-scheme charge transfer mechanism, this system exhibits superior redox capability for photocatalytic water splitting, achieving a high hydrogen evolution efficiency of 22.15%, which surpasses the commercial viability threshold (10\%). Furthermore, we demonstrate effective band gap modulation via external electric fields and biaxial strains, with optical absorption coefficients exhibiting strong strain dependence. This work provides fundamental insights into the design of WSSe/SiC heterojunctions for high-efficiency photocatalytic and tunable photodetector applications.

Title: Very strong coupling limit of Eliashberg-McMillan theory and the upper limit for superconducting transition temperature
Authors: M.V. Sadovskii
Abstract: We present a brief review of some recent work on the problem of highest achievable temperature of superconducting transition $T_c$ in electron-phonon systems. The discovery of record-breaking values of $T_c$ in quite a number of hydrides under high pressure was an impressive demonstration of capabilities of electron-phonon mechanism of Cooper pairing. This lead to an increased interest on possible limitations of Eliashberg-McMillan theory as the main theory of superconductivity in a system of electrons and phonons. We shall consider some basic conclusions following from this theory and present some remarks on the limit of very strong electron-phonon coupling. We shall discuss possible limitations on the value of the coupling constant related to possible lattice and specific heat instability and conclude that within the stable metallic phase the effective pairing constant may acquire very large values. We discuss some bounds for $T_c$ derived in the strong coupling limit and propose an elementary estimate of an upper limit for $T_c$, expressed via combination of fundamental physical constants. Finally we also briefly discuss some pessimistic estimates for $T_c$ of metallic hydrogen obtained in ``jellium'' model.

Title: Resonances of recurrence time of monitored quantum walks
Authors: Ruoyu Yin, Qingyuan Wang, Sabine Tornow, Eli Barkai
Abstract: The recurrence time is the time a process first returns to its initial state. Using quantum walks on a graph, the recurrence time is defined through stroboscopic monitoring of the arrival of the particle to a node of the system. When the time interval between repeated measurements is tuned in such a way that eigenvalues of the unitary become degenerate, the mean recurrence time exhibits resonances. These resonances imply faster mean recurrence times, which were recorded on quantum computers. The resonance broadening is captured by a restart uncertainty relation [R. Yin, Q. Wang, S. Tornow, E. Barkai, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 122, e2402912121 (2025)]. To ensure a comprehensive analysis, we extend our investigation to include the impact of system size on the widened resonances, showing how the connectivity and energy spectrum structure of a system influence the restart uncertainty relation. Breaking the symmetry of the system, for example time-reversal symmetry breaking with a magnetic flux applied to a ring, removes the degeneracy of the eigenvalues of the unitary, hence modifying the mean recurrence time and the widening of the transitions, and this effect is studied in detail. The width of resonances studied here is related to the finite time resolution of relevant experiments on quantum computers, and to the restart paradigm.

Title: Plasmon-induced coherence, exciton-induced transparency and Fano interference for hybrid plasmonic systems in strong coupling regime
Authors: Zoe Scott, Shafi Muhammad, Tigran V. Shahbazyan
Abstract: We present an analytical model describing the transition to strong coupling regime for an ensemble of emitters resonantly coupled to a localized surface plasmon in a metal-dielectric structure. The response of a hybrid system to an external field is determined by two distinct mechanisms involving collective states of emitters interacting with the plasmon mode. First is the near-field coupling between the bright collective state and the plasmon mode which underpins energy exchange between the system components and gives rise to exciton-induced transparency minimum in scattering spectra in the weak coupling regime and to emergence of polaritonic bands as the system transitions to strong coupling regime. The second mechanism is the Fano interference between the plasmon dipole moment and plasmon-induced dipole moment of bright collective state as the hybrid system interacts with the radiation field. The latter mechanism is greatly facilitated by plasmon-induced coherence in a system with characteristic size below the diffraction limit as the individual emitters comprising the collective state are driven by same alternating plasmon near field and therefore all oscillate in phase. This cooperative effect leads to scaling of the Fano asymmetry parameter and of the Fano function amplitude with the ensemble size and therefore it strongly affects the shape of scattering spectra for large ensembles. Specifically, with increasing emitters numbers, the Fano interference leads to a spectral weight shift towards the lower energy polaritonic band.

Title: Duality between controllability and observability for target control and estimation in networks
Authors: Arthur N. Montanari, Chao Duan, Adilson E. Motter
Abstract: Output controllability and functional observability are properties that enable, respectively, the control and estimation of part of the state vector. These notions are of utmost importance in applications to high-dimensional systems, such as large-scale networks, in which only a target subset of variables (nodes) is sought to be controlled or estimated. Although the duality between full-state controllability and observability is well established, the characterization of the duality between their generalized counterparts remains an outstanding problem. Here, we establish both the weak and the strong duality between output controllability and functional observability. Specifically, we show that functional observability of a system implies output controllability of a dual system (weak duality), and that under a certain geometric condition the converse holds (strong duality). As an application of the strong duality, we derive a necessary and sufficient condition for target control via static feedback. This allow us to establish a separation principle between the design of target controllers and the design of functional observers in closed-loop systems. These results generalize the classical duality and separation principles in modern control theory.

Title: Quantum circuits with free fermions in disguise
Authors: Bal√°zs Pozsgay, Kohei Fukai
Abstract: Recently multiple families of spin chain models were found, which have a free fermionic spectrum,even though they are not solvable by a Jordan-Wigner transformation. Instead, the free fermions emerge as a result of a rather intricate construction. In this work we consider the quantum circuit formulation of the problem. We construct circuits using local unitary gates built from the terms in the local Hamiltonians of the respective models, and ask the question: which circuit geometries (sequence of gates) lead to a free fermionic spectrum? Our main example is the 4-fermion model of Fendley, where we construct free fermionic circuits with various geometries. In certain cases we prove the free fermionic nature, while for other geometries we confirm it numerically. Surprisingly, we find that many standard brickwork circuits are not free fermionic, but we identify certain symmetric constructions which are. We also consider a recent generalization of the 4-fermion model and obtain the factorization of its transfer matrix, and subsequently derive a free-fermionic circuit for this case as well.

Title: On the Popov-Belevitch-Hautus tests for functional observability and output controllability
Authors: Arthur N. Montanari, Chao Duan, Adilson E. Motter
Abstract: Functional observability and output controllability are properties that establish the conditions for the partial estimation and partial control of the system state, respectively. In the special case of full-state observability and controllability, the Popov-Belevitch-Hautus (PBH) tests provide conditions for the properties to hold based on the system eigenspace. Generalizations of the PBH test have been recently proposed for functional observability and output controllability, but thus far have only been proven valid for diagonalizable systems. Here, we rigorously establish the generalized PBH test for functional observability, extending its validity to a broader class of systems using Jordan decomposition. Likewise, we determine the class of systems under which the generalized PBH test is sufficient and necessary for output controllability. These results have immediate implications for observer and controller design, pole assignment, and optimal placement of sensors and drivers.

Title: Autonomous Stabilization of Floquet States Using Static Dissipation
Authors: Martin Ritter, David M. Long, Qianao Yue, Anushya Chandran, Alicia J. Koll√°r
Abstract: Floquet engineering, in which the properties of a quantum system are modified through the application of strong periodic drives, is an indispensable tool in atomic and condensed matter systems. However, it is inevitably limited by intrinsic heating processes. We describe a simple autonomous scheme, which exploits a static coupling between the driven system and a lossy auxiliary, to cool large classes of Floquet systems into desired states. We present experimental and theoretical evidence for the stabilization of a chosen quasienergy state in a strongly modulated transmon qubit coupled to an auxiliary microwave cavity with fixed frequency and photon loss. The scheme naturally extends to Floquet systems with multiple degrees of freedom. As an example, we demonstrate the stabilization of topological photon pumping in a driven cavity-QED system numerically. The coupling to the auxiliary cavity increases the average photon current and the fidelity of non-classical states, such as high photon number Fock states, that can be prepared in the system cavity.

Title: Topologically protected Bell-cat states in a simple spin model
Authors: B. Lajci, D. H. J. O'Dell, J. Mumford
Abstract: We consider the topological properties of the so-called central spin model that consists of $N$ identical spins coupled to a single distinguishable central spin which arises in physical systems such as circuit-QED and bosonic Josephson junctions coupled to an impurity atom. The model closely corresponds to the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model except that the chain of sites in the SSH model is replaced by a chain of states in Fock space specifying the magnetization. We find that the model accommodates topologically protected eigenstates that are `Bell-cat' states consisting of a Schr√∂dinger cat state of the $N$ spins that is maximally entangled with the central spin, and show how this state can be adiabatically created and moved along the chain by driving the central spin. The Bell-cat states are visualized by plotting their Wigner function and we explore their robustness against random noise by solving the master equation for the density matrix. We also explain the essential topological difference between identical spins and the excitations of a bosonic mode.

Title: Analytic 3D vector non-uniform Fourier crystal optics in arbitrary $\bar{\bar{\varepsilon}}$ dielectric
Authors: Chenzhu Xie, Yong Zhang
Abstract: To find a suitable framework for nonlinear crystal optics(NCO), we have revisited linear crystal optics(LCO). At the methodological level, three widely used plane wave bases are compared in terms of eigenanalysis in reciprocal space and light field propagation in real space. Inspired by complex ray tracing, we expand M.V. Berry \& M.R. Dennis's 2003 uniform plane wave model to non-uniform Fourier crystal optics and ultimately derive the explicit form of its 3$\times$2 transition matrix, bridging the two major branches of crystal optics in reciprocal space, where either ray direction $\hat{k}$ or spatial frequency $\bar{k}_{\mathrm{\rho}}$ serves as the input variable. Using this model, we create the material-matrix tetrahedral compass to conduct a detailed analysis of how the four fundamental characteristics of materials (linear/circular birefringence/dichroism) influence the eigensystems of the vector electric field in two-dimensional spatial frequency $\bar{k}_{\mathrm{\rho}}$ domain and its distribution in three-dimensional $\bar{r}$ space with a crystal-2f configuration. Along this journey, we have uncovered new territories in LCO in both real and reciprocal space, such as infinite singularities arranged in disk-, ring-, and crescent-like shapes, ``L shorelines'' resembling hearts, generalized haunting theorem, double conical refraction, and optical knots it induces. We also present our model's early applications in focal engineering and NCO. As the opening chapter in a trilogy, this work connects crystal optics, Fourier optics, and nonlinear optics, while integrating theoretical, computational, and experimental physics, advancing all six domains.

Title: Optimal qubit-mediated quantum heat transfer via noncommuting operators and strong coupling effects
Authors: Marlon Brenes, Jakub Garwo≈Ça, Dvira Segal
Abstract: Heat transfer in quantum systems is a current topic of interest due to emerging quantum technologies that attempt to miniaturize engines and examine fundamental aspects of thermodynamics. In this work, we consider heat transfer between two thermal reservoirs in which a central spin degree of freedom mediates the process. Our objective is to identify the system-bath coupling operators that maximize heat transfer at arbitrary system-bath coupling strengths. By employing a Markovian embedding method in the form of the reaction-coordinate mapping, we study numerically heat transfer at arbitrary system-bath coupling energy and for general system-bath coupling operators between the baths and the central qubit system. We find a stark contrast in the conditions required for optimal heat transfer depending on whether the system is weakly or strongly coupled to the heat baths. In the weak-coupling regime, optimal heat transfer requires identical coupling operators that facilitate maximum sequential transport, resonant with the central qubit. In contrast, in the strong-coupling regime, noncommuting system-bath coupling operators between the hot and cold reservoirs are necessary to achieve optimal heat transfer. We further employ the Effective Hamiltonian theory and gain partial analytical insights into the observed phenomena. We discuss the limitations of this approximate method in capturing the behavior of the heat current for noncommuting coupling operators, calling for its future extensions to capture transport properties in systems with general interaction Hamiltonians.

Title: Characterizing phase transitions and criticality in non-Hermitian extensions of the XY model
Authors: D. C. Liu, Murray T. Batchelor
Abstract: In this work we study non-Hermitian extensions of the paradigmatic spin-1/2 XY chain in a magnetic field. Using the mapping of the model to free fermion form, we provide analytical insights into the energy spectrum of the non-Hermitian model and establish an intrinsic connection between the quasienergies and topological invariants. We also use exact diagonalization as a supplementary method to examine the performance of biorthogonal-based expectation values. Our results confirm that the theoretical analysis is consistent with the numerical results, with the extended phase diagram determined via the analytical solution and the critical behavior of the fidelity and entanglement. The entanglement transition goes hand in hand with the non-Hermitian topological phase transition. Like the Hermitian case, we analyze the critical behavior using finite-size scaling. Our results show that non-Hermiticity can induce the system into a new universality class with unusual critical exponent. We also emphasize the ability of the Loschmidt echo to characterize potential phase transitions and introduce the average of the Loschmidt echo to describe phase transitions in non-Hermitian systems.

Title: Membrane phononic crystals for high-Qm mechanical defect modes in piezoelectric aluminum nitride
Authors: Anastasiia Ciers, Laurentius Radit Nindito, Alexander Jung, Hannes Pfeifer, Armin Dadgar, Andre Strittmatter, Witlef Wieczorek
Abstract: Nanomechanical resonators with exceptionally low dissipation are advancing mechanics-based sensors and quantum technologies. The key for these advances is the engineering of localized phononic modes that are well-isolated from the environment, i.e., that exhibit a high mechanical quality factor, Qm. Membrane phononic crystals fabricated from strained thin films can realize high-Qm single or multiple localized phononic defect modes at MHz frequencies. These defect modes can be efficiently interfaced with out-of-plane light or coupled to a microwave quantum circuit, enabling readout and control of their motion. When membrane phononic crystals are fabricated from a crystalline film, they could offer built-in functionality. We demonstrate a membrane phononic crystal realized in a strained 90 nm-thin film of aluminum nitride (AlN), which is a crystalline piezoelectric material. We engineer a high-Qm localized phononic defect mode at 1.8 MHz with a Qxf-product of 1.5x10^13 Hz at room temperature. In future devices, the built-in piezoelectricity of AlN can be utilized for direct coupling to qubits or in-situ tuning of mechanical mode frequencies, defect mode couplings, or acoustic bandgaps, which can be used as building blocks of tunable phononic circuits or low-noise sensors.

Title: Block-corrected Modularity for Community Detection
Authors: Hasti Narimanzadeh, Takayuki Hiraoka, Mikko Kivel√§
Abstract: Unknown node attributes in complex networks may introduce community structures that are important to distinguish from those driven by known attributes. We propose a block-corrected modularity that discounts given block structures present in the network to reveal communities masked by them. We show analytically how the proposed modularity finds the community structure driven by an unknown attribute in a simple network model. Further, we observe that the block-corrected modularity finds the underlying community structure on a number of simple synthetic network models while methods using different null models fail. We develop an efficient spectral method as well as two Louvain-inspired fine-tuning algorithms to maximize the proposed modularity and demonstrate their performance on several synthetic network models. Finally, we assess our methodology on various real-world citation networks built using the OpenAlex data by correcting for the temporal citation patterns.

Title: Medusa 84 SiH -- A novel high Selectivity Electron Beam Resist for Diamond Quantum Technologies
Authors: Oliver Roman Opaluch, Sebastian Westrich, Nimba Oshnik, Philipp Fuchs, Jan Fait, Sandra Wolff, Harry Biller, Mandy Sendel, Christoph Becher, Elke Neu
Abstract: We investigate the novel electron beam resist Medusa 84 SiH by Allresist GmbH (Germany) for nanostructuring of single crystal diamond and its effects on the spin properties of nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in nanopillars as prototypes for photonic structures. We find contrast curves comparable to those of resists previously used for this task (Hydrogensilsequioxane FOx). We present a minimum selectivity for diamond etching of 6$\pm$1. Using an adhesion-promoting silicon interlayer enables fabrication yields of up to 98\%. We measure $T_2$ times of up to $\sim$25 $\mu$s before and after processing, demonstrating that the manufactured structures are usable for diamond-based quantum sensing.

Title: Preparing Code States via Seed-Entangler-Enriched Sequential Quantum Circuits: Application to Tetra-Digit Topological Error-Correcting Codes
Authors: Yu-Tao Hu, Meng-Yuan Li, Peng Ye
Abstract: We introduce a unified and efficient quantum circuit framework, termed the \emph{Seed-Entangler-Enriched Sequential Quantum Circuit} (SEESQC) to prepare quantum states in code space of topological error-correcting codes. Specifically, we apply SEESQC to prepare code states of Tetra-Digit models -- a broad class of long-range entangled stabilizer codes indexed by a four-digit parameter. These models are not rare but encompass Toric Codes across arbitrary dimensions and subsume the X-cube fracton code as special cases. Featuring a hierarchical structure of generalized entanglement renormalization group, many Tetra-Digit models host spatially extended excitations (e.g., loops, membranes, and exotic non-manifold objects) with constrained mobility and deformability, and exhibit system-size-dependent ground state degeneracies that scale exponentially with a polynomial in linear sizes. In this work, we first graphically and algebraically demonstrate quantum circuits for computational basis states, before generalizing to broader cases. Central to this framework is a key ingredient termed the \emph{seed-entangler} acting on a small number of qubits termed \textit{seeds}, enabling a systematic scheme to achieve arbitrary code states. Remarkably, the number of available seeds equals the number of logical qubits for the constructed examples, which leaves plenty of room for future investigation in theoretical physics, mathematics and quantum information science. With experimental feasibility via synthetic dimensions in modern quantum simulators, this framework transcends spatial dimensions, bridges liquid and non-liquid states, unifies gapped phases governed by distinct entanglement renormalization group schemes, and offers a pathway toward engineering topological phases and manipulating logical qubits.

Title: Acceleration Theorem for Low-Dimensional Electron Systems with Off-Diagonal Effective Mass Components
Authors: Nobuya Mori, Hajime Tanaka, Jo Okada
Abstract: The motion of electrons under homogeneously applied electric fields in low-dimensional systems with non-zero off-diagonal effective mass (ODEM) is studied. The equation describing the time evolution of a probability coefficient of finding an electron in a subband is derived using the Krieger-Iafrate theory in the effective mass approximation. It is shown that an electron can change subbands during free flight due to the ODEM-induced inter-subband transitions. By introducing an effective dispersion defined as a weighted average of the subband dispersions, it is also shown that the initial acceleration of an electron effectively follows the bulk dispersion relation. The results obtained suggest that the transport properties of the quantized systems when many subbands are occupied in the weak confinement limit approach the values one would find without considering the quantization.

Title: Yang-Mills flows for multilayered graphene
Authors: Vasilii Iugov, Nikita Nekrasov
Abstract: We clarify the origin of magic angles in twisted multilayered graphene using Yang-Mills flows in two dimensions. We relate the effective Hamiltonian describing the electrons in the multilayered graphene to the ${\bar\partial}_{A}$ operator on a two dimensional torus coupled to an $SU(N)$ gauge field. Despite the absence of a characteristic class such as $c_{1}$ relevant for the quantum Hall effect, we show that there are topological invariants associated with the zero modes occuring in a family of Hamiltonians. The flatbands in the spectrum of the effective Hamiltonian are associated with Yang-Mills connections, studied by this http URL and this http URL long time ago. The emergent $U(1)$ magnetic field with nonzero flux is presumably responsible for the observed Hall effect in the absence of (external) magnetic field. We provide a numeric algorithm transforming the original single-particle Hamiltonian to the direct sum of ${\bar\partial}_{A}$ operators coupled to abelian gauge fields with non-zero $c_1$'s. Our perspective gives a simple bound for magic angles: if the gauge field $A({\alpha})$ is such that the YM energy $\Vert F_{A({\alpha})} \Vert^2$ is smaller than that of $U(1)$ magnetic flux embedded into $SU(2)$, then $\alpha$ is not magic.

Title: Simulating Heterogeneity within Elastic and Inelastic Discrete Mechanical Models
Authors: Jan Raisinger, Qiwei Zhang, John E. Bolander, Jan Eli√°≈°
Abstract: Two approaches to incorporate heterogeneity in discrete models are compared. In the first, standard approach, the heterogeneity is dictated by geometrical structure of the discrete system. In the second approach, the heterogeneity is imposed by randomizing material parameters of the contacts between the rigid bodies. A similar randomization strategy is often adopted in continuous homogeneous models. The study investigates both the elastic and fracture behaviors of these model types, and compares their local and macroscale responses. It is found that the stress oscillations present in the standard discrete models built on heterogeneous geometric structures cannot be replicated by randomization of the elastically homogeneous discrete system. The marginal distributions and dependencies between the stress tensor components cannot be adequately matched. Therefore, there is a fundamental difference between these two views on discrete models. The numerical experiments performed in the paper showed that an identical response can be achieved at the macroscale by tuning the material parameters. However, the local behavior, fracturing, and internal dependencies are quite different. These findings provide insight into the potential for controlled random assignment of heterogeneity in homogeneous models. They also demonstrate the need for experimental data capable of verifying the correctness of such an approach.

Title: Physics-informed Neural Networks Enable High Fidelity Shear Wave Viscoelastography across Multiple organs
Authors: Ziying Yin, Yuxi Guo, Jiayi Pu, Yuxuan Jiang, Shiyu Ma, Guo-Yang Li, Yanping Cao
Abstract: Tissue viscoelasticity has been recognized as a crucial biomechanical indicator for disease diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring. Conventional shear wave elastography techniques depend on dispersion analysis and face fundamental limitations in clinical scenarios. Particularly, limited wave propagation data with low signal-to-noise ratios, along with challenges in discriminating between dual dispersion sources stemming from viscoelasticity and finite tissue dimensions, pose great difficulties for extracting dispersion relation. In this study, we introduce SWVE-Net, a framework for shear wave viscoelasticity imaging based on a physics-informed neural network (PINN). SWVE-Net circumvents dispersion analysis by directly incorporating the viscoelasticity wave motion equation into the loss functions of the PINN. Finite element simulations reveal that SWVE-Net quantifies viscosity parameters within a wide range (0.15-1.5 Pa*s), even for samples just a few millimeters in size, where substantial wave reflections and dispersion occur. Ex vivo experiments demonstrate its applicability across various organs, including brain, liver, kidney, and spleen, each with distinct viscoelasticity. In in vivo human trials on breast and skeletal muscle tissues, SWVE-Net reliably assesses viscoelastic properties with standard deviation-to-mean ratios below 15%, highlighting robustness under real-world constraints. SWVE-Net overcomes the core limitations of conventional elastography and enables reliable viscoelastic characterization where traditional methods fall short. It holds promise for applications such as grading hepatic lipid accumulation, detecting myocardial infarction boundaries, and distinguishing malignant from benign tumors.

Title: Disturbing news about the $d=2+Œµ$ expansion
Authors: Fabiana De Cesare, Slava Rychkov
Abstract: The $O(N)$ Non-Linear Sigma Model (NLSM) in $d=2+\epsilon$ has long been conjectured to describe the same conformal field theory (CFT) as the Wilson-Fisher (WF) $O(N)$ fixed point obtained from the $\lambda(\phi^2)^2$ model in $d=4-\epsilon$. In this work, we put this conjecture into question, building on the recent observation [Jones (2024)] that the NLSM CFT possesses a protected operator with dimension $N-1$, which is instead absent in the WF $O(N)$ CFT. We investigate the possibility of lifting this operator via multiplet recombination - the only known mechanism that could resolve this mismatch while preserving a connection between the two theories. We also explore an alternative scenario in which the NLSM $O(N)$ fixed point in $d=2+\epsilon$ is not continuously connected to the WF $O(N)$ CFT, and instead corresponds to a different universality class. For $N=3$, this could be related to the hedgehog-suppressed critical point, which describes the N√©el-VBS phase transition in 3D.

Title: Probing Quantum Spin Systems with Kolmogorov-Arnold Neural Network Quantum States
Authors: Mahmud Ashraf Shamim, Eric A F Reinhardt, Talal Ahmed Chowdhury, Sergei Gleyzer, Paulo T Araujo
Abstract: Neural Quantum States (NQS) are a class of variational wave functions parametrized by neural networks (NNs) to study quantum many-body systems. In this work, we propose \texttt{SineKAN}, a NQS \textit{ansatz} based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), to represent quantum mechanical wave functions as nested univariate functions. We show that \texttt{SineKAN} wavefunction with learnable sinusoidal activation functions can capture the ground state energies, fidelities and various correlation functions of the one dimensional Transverse-Field Ising model, Anisotropic Heisenberg model, and Antiferromagnetic $J_{1}-J_{2}$ model with different chain lengths. In our study of the $J_1-J_2$ model with $L=100$ sites, we find that the \texttt{SineKAN} model outperforms several previously explored neural quantum state \textit{ans√§tze}, including Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), Long Short-Term Memory models (LSTMs), and Multi-layer Perceptrons (MLP) \textit{a.k.a.} Feed Forward Neural Networks, when compared to the results obtained from the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm. We find that \texttt{SineKAN} models can be trained to high precisions and accuracies with minimal computational costs.

Title: Strongly Coupled Exciton--Hyperbolic-phonon-polariton Hybridized States in hBN-encapsulated Biased Bilayer Graphene
Authors: Tomer Eini, N. M. R. Peres, Yarden Mazor, Itai Epstein
Abstract: Excitons in biased bilayer graphene are electrically tunable optical excitations residing in the mid-infrared (MIR) spectral range, where intrinsic optical transitions are typically scarce. Such a tunable material system with an excitonic response offer a rare platform for exploring light-matter interactions and optical hybridization of quasiparticles residing in the long wavelength spectrum. In this work, we demonstrate that when the bilayer is encapsulated in hexagonal-boron-nitride (hBN)-a material supporting optical phonons and hyperbolic-phonon-polaritons (HPhPs) in the MIR-the excitons can be tuned into resonance with the HPhP modes. We find that the overlap in energy and momentum of the two MIR quasiparticles facilitate the formation of multiple strongly coupled hybridized exciton-HPhP states. Using an electromagnetic transmission line model, we derive the dispersion relations of the hybridized states and show that they are highly affected and can be manipulated by the symmetry of the system, determining the hybridization selection rules. Our results establish a general tunable MIR platform for engineering strongly coupled quasiparticle states in biased graphene systems, opening new directions for studying and controlling light-matter interactions in the long-wavelength regime.

Title: Adaptive quantum dynamics with the time-dependent variational Monte Carlo method
Authors: Raffaele Salioni, Rocco Martinazzo, Davide Emilio Galli, Christian Apostoli
Abstract: We introduce an extension of the time-dependent variational Monte Carlo (tVMC) method that adaptively controls the expressivity of the variational quantum state during the simulation. This adaptive tVMC approach addresses numerical instabilities that arise when the variational ansatz is overparameterized or contains redundant degrees of freedom. Building on the concept of the local-in-time error (LITE), a measure of the deviation between variational and exact evolution, we introduce a procedure to quantify each parameter's contribution to reducing the LITE, using only quantities already computed in standard tVMC simulations. These relevance estimates guide the selective evolution of only the most significant parameters at each time step, while maintaining a prescribed level of accuracy. We benchmark the algorithm on quantum quenches in the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model using both spin-Jastrow and restricted Boltzmann machine wave functions, with an emphasis on overparameterized regimes. The adaptive scheme significantly improves numerical stability and reduces the need for strong regularization, enabling reliable simulations with highly expressive variational ans√§tze.

Title: Multi-parameter isospectral Fokker-Planck equations
Authors: Choon-Lin Ho
Abstract: From a given Fokker-Planck equation, a multi-parameter deformed partner Fokker-Planck equation is constructed. This is done by first deleting a set of eigenstates of the original FPE by the multi-step Darboux-Crum transformation, and then reinstating the eigen-energy levels by the reverse Darboux-Crum transformation. Extension to fractional Fokker-Planck equation is briefly discussed. A recent study of the one-parameter isospectral FPE applied to black hole in the thermal potential approach is commented.

Title: Voltage-Induced Oxidation for Enhanced Purity and Reproducibility of Quantum Emission in Monolayer 2D Materials

Abstract: We report a voltage-induced oxidation technique using conductive atomic force microscopy to enhance the single-photon purity and reproducibility of quantum emitters in monolayer tung-sten diselenide (WSe2). By applying a controlled electric field across a monolayer WSe2/poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-trifluoroethylene) (P(VDF-TrFE)) on a silicon substrate, localized oxidation is induced around nanoindented emitter sites in the WSe2. This treatment selectively suppresses defect-bound exciton emissions while preserving emission from pristine regions within the indentations. Photoluminescence and second-order correlation measurements at 18 K demonstrate a substantial increase in single-photon purity when comparing emitters from untreated and voltage-treated regions. Emitters from untreated regions showed average values of g2(0) near or above the 0.5 threshold. In contrast, emitters from voltage-treated regions exhibited g2(0) values consistently below 0.14, with most falling near 0.05, demonstrating high-purity single-photon emission well below the g2(0) < 0.5 threshold. This enhancement results from the oxidation-induced suppression of spurious luminescence from the area around the quantum emitter site that is spectrally degenerate with the single-photon wavelength. This approach offers nonvolatile, spatially selective control over the emitter environment without degrading the emission intensity, improving both purity and stability. It provides a scalable route for integrating high-quality quantum emitters in two-dimensional materials into photonic platforms. Integration with spectral tuning strategies such as strain engineering, local dielectric patterning, or electrostatic gating could further enable deterministic, wavelength-selective single-photon sources for advanced quantum photonic applications
